[20:53] sweet Holy Spirit go with them Lord God
[20:56] do Your Divine will we pray
[20:59] in Jesus name
[21:01] amen amen God bless you bless you ever
[21:06] visit welcome very welcome maybe you can
[21:09] have your seat for a minute we're just
[21:10] thrilled to have our brother Zachary
[21:12] with us and he's going to share some
[21:15] testimonies it's actually the first time
[21:17] I got to meet him fellowshiping because
[21:19] he ministered when we were in Central
[21:22] America when I was done and and you know
[21:26] just in our fellowship was really
[21:29] beautiful about our brother Zachary he's
[21:32] going to share just some testimony is he
[21:35] will go
[21:36] places that you won't go and he's went
[21:40] places that I probably wouldn't
[21:43] go amen and you know we have our camp
[21:46] meeing a lot of people are start to send
[21:48] information in about our camp in August
[21:50] and you know we had a few Believers that
[21:53] that uh our camp meeting is a camping
[21:55] camp meeting it's a tent and shed camp
[21:58] meeting and you know some me people
[22:01] would mention about you know that was
[22:02] pretty tough sleeping on a tent for one
[22:06] night you know over 50% of the world
[22:09] lives like that our brothers actor went
[22:12] to places that's their standard
[22:13] equipment you know they they live that's
[22:16] their life and their world Amen and you
[22:19] know he was just sharing testimonies it
[22:20] was just amazing beautiful you know when
[22:23] he mentioned something last
[22:26] night and I I pray to God that this
[22:30] wouldn't be true but he said you know in
[22:34] our world we have Christ in our life but
[22:37] he said in their world Christ is their
[22:39] life it's a huge difference and if
[22:42] you're a minister and you go preach
[22:43] there and you preach here you'll know it
[22:45] just like that because Christ is their
[22:47] life but for us sadly because of riches
[22:51] Christ is just in our life and I pray
[22:54] that that will will you know God can
[22:56] change that change me and it's a huge
[22:59] difference amen but we just welcome our
[23:00] brother and just look forward to what
[23:02] God will share with us this morning amen
[23:04] amen God bless you
[23:11] brother with you this morning thank you
[23:13] musicians I appreciate you being a part
[23:17] of the service that way it's a blessing
[23:20] you know uh many places you go there
[23:24] there is no there is no music outside of
[23:26] what you can put together with your
[23:28] voice
[23:29] but that's still
[23:30] good and it's not the uh the instrument
[23:33] so much as the heart that God's Desiring
[23:36] to hear but uh uh when I was here last
[23:39] it was in December um in January I did
[23:41] get to go to India on a trip there um
[23:45] and uh so I I'll share with you a few
[23:47] things from the trip there and um we
[23:51] went to we went to the the northern part
[23:54] of India and we got to the city area and
[23:57] we met up with a brother there that I've
[23:59] I've been I've been over there for about
[24:01] 10 years visiting and so I said i' I'd
[24:04] like to go sometime to these outlying
[24:06] areas well you surprise me sorry some
[24:09] Hometown folk here um and it just really
[24:12] surprised me to uh to meet the uh or to
[24:16] go and and see that area and and I said
[24:18] you know I'd love to go and I I told him
[24:20] how I'd got the opportunity to travel to
[24:22] some areas where uh uh we'd been out in
[24:25] the bush really and you know you've got
[24:27] your backpack and a water filter and a
[24:29] hammock and you're just going back in
[24:30] there by horseback and Riverboat and
[24:32] things and so I'd said you know I'm I'm
[24:35] I'm okay I'm comfortable with going to
[24:36] these outlying areas where you've been
[24:38] doing this Outreach work for the last
[24:40] you know 5 six years and so he said well
[24:42] if you want to go you know let's let's
[24:44] plan a trip so we did and and we we got
[24:47] back in there and you know it's it's a
[24:49] very persecuted area um one of my
[24:52] indicators were when we were packing up
[24:54] he says don't bring your Bible I was
[24:56] like all right and uh that was one of
[24:59] the first indicators of how persecuted
[25:02] the area is and we get to the airport
[25:04] and he says when we get close cover your
[25:06] face and I'm like I don't know what
[25:08] close is I've never been to this area
[25:10] like when when do I know to do that you
[25:12] know and and it ended up not being U you
[25:14] know any problems but like we got there
[25:17] and and um you know one of the man men
[25:20] we were sitting there on the porch with
[25:21] drinking tea he just got out of jail the
[25:23] day before that for preaching the gospel
[25:25] and and you know they're they're very
[25:27] pressured they it's it's a very tight
[25:29] tribal community and so it's it's kind
[25:32] of like a really tight family and an
[25:34] outsider like you know a few years ago
[25:36] if you came in in a vehicle uh they were
[25:39] likely to throw rocks on the vehicle if
[25:40] they didn't recognize it because that's
[25:42] an outsider and if you're an outsider
[25:44] they really don't like you and so we
[25:47] kind of just you know keep a low profile
[25:49] the church is not what I would call an
[25:50] underground church but they just they
[25:52] just kind of keep a low profile and uh
[25:56] but we got to go to some areas there
[25:58] where you know they don't have running
[25:59] water uh they you know if you need to
[26:01] use a bathroom you have to go find a
[26:02] tree out there in the morning somewhere
[26:04] and it's so it's a little different but
[26:05] for me I enjoy camping I I I just
[26:08] literally enjoy it so it's not a a great
[26:10] sacrifice for me but uh it's definitely
[26:13] pretty remote but you you find there the
[26:16] one area we went the pastor he was
[26:18] illiterate many of the people are
[26:20] illiterate they they can't they can't
[26:22] read and even if they could read in many
[26:25] of those areas there's no Bible in their
[26:26] language
[26:29] and you know you're talking to him and
[26:32] I'm just thinking you've been a pastor
[26:34] for years and you can't read like
[26:35] doesn't that break the rules or
[26:36] something like like how's that working
[26:39] and so you start you know is what we
[26:40] call a bit of a paradigm shift you start
[26:42] looking at things from a different
[26:44] perspect you're like wait a minute Peter
[26:46] and John were ignorant and unlearned men
[26:49] they couldn't sign their own name but
[26:51] they'd been with Jesus and you began to
[26:53] think what does it mean to be a
[26:54] Christian what does this really mean and
[26:57] and I I I began to talk to this this
[26:59] pastor there about his his his
[27:02] experiences and and how he became a
[27:04] pastor and they came out of the Hindu
[27:05] religion there and and he found out
[27:07] about Jesus and he found out that there
[27:09] was a living God and he began to pray
[27:12] and he seen God answer
[27:14] prayer and so then he would pray for
[27:16] somebody in the village and they would
[27:18] be healed and they would be delivered
[27:19] and he says this is Jesus he's the
[27:21] Living God the Hindu gods are not real
[27:23] and they'd come to his church which was
[27:26] his house and so they he talked to them
[27:28] about the Lord and and that's how the
[27:30] church was established and the the the
[27:32] little they have a porch there and they
[27:34] built a little wooden uh uh shelter over
[27:37] top of it and the way that was done was
[27:40] because there was a man that was a
[27:41] raging Maniac just completely a manic
[27:43] person uh possessed and and his family
[27:46] dragged him over there to where the
[27:48] brother was and asked him for prayer and
[27:51] he prayed for him and he was completely
[27:52] set free wow and that man happened to be
[27:54] a carpenter and he was so thankful to be
[27:56] in his right mind again that he built
[27:58] him a shelter for his church and so that
[28:01] the whole church it was not built out of
[28:04] the the the intellectual Theology of man
[28:07] it was built off of the reality that
[28:09] there's a living God and uh when when
[28:12] the brother you know so you're thinking
[28:14] well how do you work with people like
[28:15] this how do you share the gospel with
[28:17] them how do you because there's you know
[28:20] with that kind of a a position there's a
[28:22] lot of things and an understanding that
[28:24] they don't have there's a lot of
[28:25] teaching that they really don't have
[28:27] because you can't even read you know can
[28:29] you imagine being a pastor and not being
[28:30] able to write any notes down for your
[28:32] service you know there's just a lot of
[28:33] challenges there and and so I was like
[28:36] well how do how are you sharing the
[28:38] message with them how is this you know
[28:39] being done when you can't even show them
[28:41] out of the Bible where it's true because
[28:43] they can't even read the Bible and he
[28:44] said well um I came to this area and he
[28:47] says years ago his wife the pastor's
[28:49] wife had had a vision or or dream that
[28:52] there would be a man come from Punjab
[28:54] and when he would come he would have the
[28:56] truth and they would have to listen to
[28:58] what he had to say and so one day when
[29:00] the missionary brother I was traveling
[29:02] with when he got there he walks up to
[29:04] the village and she says husband that's
[29:06] the man he has the truth
[29:09] hallelujah so the the foundation of that
[29:12] church is the
[29:14] Supernatural and I was thinking about
[29:17] you know how much how much greater of a
[29:19] position is it to as a as a missionary
[29:21] to work with somebody that knows God by
[29:24] theology or knows him by experience I'll
[29:28] take an illiterate man who knows that
[29:30] there's a living God anytime over
[29:32] somebody who's steeped in seminary
[29:34] Theology and he sits there and argues
[29:36] with you about the supernatural God
[29:38] because he doesn't know him amen and so
[29:42] that was uh just a real interesting
[29:44] experience and and a humbling one to to
[29:47] realize what we have we have a Bible in
[29:51] our language we have the ability to read
[29:54] it do you know how blessed you are to
[29:57] have that OPP opportunity and do you
[29:59] know how neglected that opportunity is
[30:02] Left
[30:03] Behind we've been given a message the
[30:05] revealed word of God in this hour in our
[30:10] language and you talk to many people and
[30:13] they don't even know what it's about
[30:15] right I met a man there and he was
[30:17] sitting on the porch there's just
[30:19] something about it you're sitting on
[30:20] this porch it's a house made out of just
[30:23] uh bricks that they make there in the
[30:25] the local area and there's no running
[30:27] water just a box of a house and and
[30:30] you're you're there and you can hear the
[30:31] jungle sounds out behind you and the and
[30:33] the The Jackal howling out in the the
[30:35] mountain there and and there's a man
[30:37] standing there and he's got he's just
[30:39] this old man he's he's got this kind of
[30:41] ragged clothes not ragged but just wore
[30:43] out you know and and he's talking to me
[30:45] says you know years ago when I accepted
[30:47] Christ he says my family my brothers
[30:50] they came and they beat me nearly to
[30:52] death they dropped me off at the
[30:54] hospital and and the doctors looked at
[30:56] me and said just leave him alone he'll
[30:58] die and they didn't care cuzz he wasn't
[31:00] a Hindu anymore right and he was sitting
[31:03] there and and he realized the doctors
[31:05] weren't going to help him nobody was
[31:07] going to help him and so he began to
[31:09] pray he said Lord Jesus you're my savior
[31:12] but I need a
[31:14] Healer he began to pray and he says Lord
[31:17] I ask that you would heal me and I asked
[31:19] that someday I would get to meet my
[31:21] family from around the world right
[31:25] because he found that his his local
[31:26] family they didn't like him anymore more
[31:28] they cast him out they wanted to destroy
[31:30] him and so he was asking Lord I want to
[31:33] meet my Christian family that's from
[31:35] around the world so he was laying there
[31:37] and he just began to pray and they just
[31:40] ignored him and after a couple days he
[31:44] stood up and he walked out of that
[31:47] hospital and they could not believe that
[31:49] it was possible for a man to do that who
[31:51] had been in that condition and he he
[31:53] unbuttoned his shirt and he's like you
[31:54] see here this shoulder was totally
[31:56] broken he says but look it's healed now
[31:59] and uh he was just he was so excited and
[32:02] he says and and I've all I've prayed for
[32:03] years I wanted to meet my Christian
[32:05] family from around the world he says and
[32:07] now you're here he says and I met you
[32:11] and he says I I I feel like I can depart
[32:13] in peace because my eyes have seen
[32:16] itow and you know there's such a you
[32:19] know you just just going there and
[32:21] standing there and and being with these
[32:23] people who they don't you know they they
[32:27] might not have a lot of worldly riches
[32:29] they might not have a lot of Earthly
[32:30] possessions but they just have such a
[32:33] sincere heart for God and it it's just I
[32:37] just love it I love being able to go
[32:39] there and and just to show the
[32:40] fellowship to let them know they're part
[32:43] of a body there's a bride of Jesus
[32:45] Christ from around the world and I I
[32:47] remember one time being back in the
[32:48] jungles of hondur Honduras one time and
[32:51] and I was drawing in the map and using
[32:53] my broken Spanish to explain to them
[32:55] that there's Believers of the message
[32:57] over here here in Ohio there's Believers
[32:59] of the message over here in India I was
[33:02] like you're over here but way over here
[33:04] I've been way back in there people just
[33:06] like you and I've been over here to
[33:07] Africa and down here and and there
[33:10] there's Believers just like you here and
[33:12] up here in Asia and over here in Europe
[33:14] and begin to draw that picture and
[33:16] they're isolated way back in this jungle
[33:18] but their eyes just begin to get so big
[33:20] they say you've seen it I'm like yes
[33:22] I've been there there is Believers just
[33:24] like you all around the world you're
[33:26] part of a body and it begins to break
[33:29] them out of this this isolation complex
[33:31] that I'm all alone and uh you know the
[33:34] the real cure for that is is getting to
[33:36] the other side when you find out that
[33:37] we're really part of a body from around
[33:39] the world but you know it's just I I
[33:42] enjoy going those places the people they
[33:44] have such needs and when you can't
[33:46] afford a doctor and that's not an option
[33:50] you go to the great
[33:52] physician and when you're not just
[33:54] holding in your back pocket well I'll
[33:56] I'll go get prayed for but you know if
[33:57] that doesn't work and then I'm going to
[33:58] go to the doctor you know which there's
[34:00] nothing wrong with doctors but when
[34:02] that's not an option your only option is
[34:05] getting in contact with almighty God you
[34:09] see a lot of the supernatural take place
[34:10] over there you see God move in in
[34:13] tremendous ways because that they're
[34:15] that's their only hope and they they
[34:18] come and they're under such expectation
[34:19] you know this you know this brother he
[34:21] came from across the world and all these
[34:23] different things so I think God's just
[34:24] going to meet me here and when they come
[34:26] with that expectation
[34:29] God just moves in such a tremendous way
[34:32] and uh you know and so it's really good
[34:34] to see the the Revival in the hearts of
[34:36] the people around the world and and you
[34:38] know but you know I it's not just in
[34:40] foreign countries where God moves you
[34:42] know just the other day we were in
[34:44] church and the pastor there was
[34:46] preaching about uh the atmosphere and
[34:48] how when the atmosphere is right the
[34:50] supernatural takes place when when that
[34:53] pool of Bethesda when it was getting
[34:55] stirred up when that water was stirred
[34:56] and the spirit of God was moving if you
[34:58] got into that atmosphere if you got into
[35:01] that place you could be touched by the
[35:03] healing power of God and there's a
[35:05] brother sitting right behind me in
[35:06] church and he's had back pain for three
[35:09] years and it's just been uh just just a
[35:11] constant burning pain there in his upper
[35:13] back and as uh brother Wayne was
[35:15] preaching all of a sudden his back just
[35:17] popped right in that atmosphere and that
[35:20] pain completely left his back right
[35:22] there and uh his wife had vertigo and so
[35:25] he said well sister let's go up for
[35:27] prayer and so they went up for prayer
[35:28] that that uh night and the next day she
[35:31] was completely free from that vertigo
[35:33] she'd had for months and uh a brother uh
[35:37] have you ever had brother Isaac Hatfield
[35:38] up here no okay great put him on the
[35:41] list but he's a he's a real good young
[35:45] he's a young Minister but uh just real
[35:47] good brother and he was just speaking
[35:49] about Balman Gilead there's a Balman
[35:52] Gilead and just preaching the word that
[35:55] there's a Balman Gilead and there's a
[35:57] sister there that's been struggling with
[35:59] postpartum depression and and my wife
[36:01] went through that and it's it's a real
[36:03] it's a real hard thing it's a just a
[36:05] real dark time and challenging you you
[36:06] don't know which way is up and which
[36:08] way's down you're so instable and you
[36:10] know brother brandom said that uh he
[36:12] said that nervousness a nervousness a
[36:15] nervous Spirit those things he says it's
[36:17] actually worse than
[36:18] cancer which if you've never dealt with
[36:21] something like that you don't understand
[36:23] that but he says it's worse than cancer
[36:26] and and this sister she came came up and
[36:27] she just ask asking for
[36:29] prayer and she was completely set free
[36:32] right
[36:33] there and I want to testify that there
[36:37] is a bomb in Gilead there is a living
[36:39] God and he's not just in India he's not
[36:41] just in Africa although I've seen him
[36:44] there but you know just recently I was
[36:46] up in a little place in Canada and the
[36:47] people came with expectation and I'll
[36:50] tell you how that went after the
[36:52] service but God is a living God and I'd
[36:56] like to just uh stand to our feet this
[36:58] morning and take a a portion of
[37:00] scripture here out of Romans the 8th
[37:02] chapter uh Romans 8 and
[37:08] 11 just good to be here uh with
[37:11] Believers thank you Jesus and uh I I
[37:14] want to ask you what do you believe is
[37:19] possible thank you Lord don't don't
[37:22] limit my
[37:24] God in Romans the 8th chapter in verse
[37:26] 11 says but if the spirit of him that
[37:30] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[37:34] you he that raised up Christ from the
[37:37] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[37:41] bodies Hallelujah by his spirit that
[37:44] dwelleth in you let's just pray this
[37:48] morning Heavenly Father we have need of
[37:51] that quickening power here this morning
[37:53] Lord Lord we're Desiring that our
[37:55] Earthly bodies Lord these flesh
[37:57] Tabernacles would be taken control of by
[38:00] the power of the Holy Spirit and we're
[38:02] asking that you would speak your word to
[38:04] the hearts of your children this morning
[38:06] Lord and and Lord any need that would be
[38:08] here father whether it would be
[38:10] spiritual Lord whether it would be
[38:11] physical whether it would be Financial
[38:13] whatever that need would be Lord you are
[38:16] the god that supplieth all our needs and
[38:19] so I ask this morning that you would
[38:20] have freedom and liberty to move Among
[38:23] Us just speak to our hearts may you open
[38:25] up your word and may it not just
[38:28] intellectual Lord but may it be divine
[38:30] revelation is my prayer Lord in the name
[38:32] of Jesus Christ amen can be seated this
[38:37] morning I I I want to also read a
[38:40] portion of scripture from uh Ezekiel 37
[38:45] just uh I want to speak about that
[38:47] quickening power and also uh tying that
[38:51] in with the bride's Revival but in
[38:53] Ezekiel 37:1 it says the hand of the
[38:56] Lord was upon me and carried me out in
[38:58] the spirit of the Lord and set me down
[39:00] in the midst of the valley which was
[39:02] full of Bones and caused me to pass by
[39:05] them round about and behold there were
[39:07] very many in the open Valley and lo they
[39:10] were very dry and he said unto me son of
[39:14] man can these bones
[39:17] live and I answered oh Lord God thou
[39:22] knowest we're just going to move through
[39:24] that uh portion of scripture a little
[39:26] bit here through the service but I I
[39:28] want to just uh I'm kind of torn between
[39:31] uh you know as a minister you'll you'll
[39:32] you'll have a thought but then you'll
[39:34] you'll see something and I've been just
[39:35] looking at quickening Power and how many
[39:37] have have heard that sermon it is the
[39:39] rising of the sun yes tremendous sermon
[39:42] and you go into there and that sermon
[39:44] and Easter seal brother just really
[39:46] begins to bring out a lot of this about
[39:48] the quickening power which is the holy
[39:50] spirit but he begins to bring it out in
[39:52] a way because the word Quicken means to
[39:54] make alive it speaks of a seed that was
[39:58] planted and then it's derz It's Made
[40:00] Alive it speaks of something that was
[40:02] was was dead or or at the point of death
[40:05] and it's revived back to life it's it's
[40:08] a power that brings life and and the the
[40:12] devil he does not care how religious you
[40:15] are no you could be as religious as you
[40:17] could be you could have all of the
[40:19] knowledge you could quote all of the
[40:21] word which the devil can do but if you
[40:23] miss that life you're finished
[40:27] you you could you could have all the
[40:28] religion but if you miss the life you
[40:30] aren't coming out in any Resurrection
[40:32] you must have that quickening power you
[40:34] must be born again and and so if if you
[40:38] go into that sermon uh the rising of the
[40:40] sun brother brandom he he takes a lot of
[40:43] time explaining mechanics and Dynamics
[40:46] and he shows how if you could get a car
[40:48] and and you could uh what kind of car
[40:50] would you say we should pick this
[40:51] morning you have a car you like is there
[40:53] somebody here that's a car fanatic you
[40:55] know likes you know likes particular
[40:56] cars
[40:58] Camaro a Camaro all right so we get this
[41:00] Camaro and and we get it and it's a
[41:02] bright red color all right so we get
[41:04] this bright red Camaro and and we get it
[41:06] and we put you know nice leather seats
[41:08] in it it's just a beautiful beautiful
[41:10] vehicle we got all these things here all
[41:11] of the parts are in place the mechanics
[41:13] are just right you got the mechanics
[41:16] there you got the all the machineries in
[41:18] order and then you fill it up with a
[41:20] high power gasoline that's all wonderful
[41:22] that's all tremendous that is the
[41:24] mechanics and those things have to be
[41:26] there you get that there and it's all
[41:28] ready to go but brother R says if you
[41:31] miss that
[41:33] spark if you miss that quickening power
[41:36] he says all of that doesn't matter
[41:38] because no matter how much mechanics you
[41:40] have there how much teaching of the word
[41:42] how much theology how and it's good it's
[41:45] correct it's in its right position but
[41:47] if you miss the quickening power he says
[41:49] that gasoline might as well be water
[41:51] because there'll never be a release of
[41:53] the power to move that vehicle down the
[41:56] road to take that command arrow and lift
[41:57] the front tires off the ground just take
[41:59] off going if that power is never
[42:02] released what does it
[42:04] matter we might as well be
[42:07] Catholics true if there ain't going to
[42:09] be no life cuz they're dead
[42:13] anyway he says here we've the gasoline
[42:16] represents the word and it's the truth
[42:18] but without the spirit it won't move he
[42:22] says we have put too much stress on the
[42:25] mechanics and nothing on the dynamic it
[42:29] needs the dynamic power of God the
[42:31] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[42:34] the church to manifest and to bring to
[42:36] pass that this is gasoline we have
[42:41] received a message and it is gasoline
[42:43] there is incredible power in it but if
[42:46] you do not get that quickening power to
[42:48] strike that message word in your
[42:51] heart what good is it going to do you it
[42:54] might be in a gasoline can well it could
[42:56] still be water but the only proof of it
[42:59] is you know I could tell you this
[43:01] morning that I've got a container of
[43:03] gasoline here and and it's got a lot of
[43:05] power and I could tell you all about the
[43:07] power in this this this bottle right
[43:09] here Y and you might have some questions
[43:12] about it that's fine you know we could
[43:15] we could argue about it we could discuss
[43:16] it but you know there's a real easy way
[43:18] to settle
[43:19] it you can say oh well I believe this
[43:22] and I believe that and you know I don't
[43:24] believe God heals anymore and I you know
[43:26] you could have this whole disc
[43:27] discussion but I tell you what you take
[43:29] that quickening power you take a match
[43:31] and you put it to that water right there
[43:33] and you'll find out there ain't no power
[43:35] in
[43:36] it you'll find out it's water but if you
[43:39] get gasoline in this same container and
[43:42] you take and you put that match to it I
[43:45] don't care if it was the smallest child
[43:47] in here that did it there would still be
[43:49] a release of power it's not about the
[43:52] person it's not about the individual
[43:53] when you connect the Dynamics and the
[43:56] mechanics together the power of God is
[43:59] released in your
[44:02] life and I feel like many times uh I'm
[44:07] I'm studying this right now and I want
[44:08] to study a little bit more but I've seen
[44:10] that a many of the times when the
[44:13] quickening power comes it actually comes
[44:17] in Revelation and so you have the word
[44:20] of God and he says you know by my
[44:22] stripes you're healed that is the word
[44:24] of God we know it's the word of God now
[44:26] that's that's mechanics it's sitting
[44:28] there it's the truth we believe it it's
[44:30] right and it's in its right position he
[44:32] is my healer I believe it that's right
[44:35] but as long as that sits there as
[44:37] something that's just general knowledge
[44:41] it's for somebody
[44:43] somewhere doesn't do you no good it's
[44:46] not going to move down the road but when
[44:48] that thing that says by his stripes I am
[44:50] healed he was wounded for my
[44:51] transgressions he was bruised for my
[44:53] iniquities by his stripes I am healed
[44:55] when that becomes to go from just a head
[44:57] knowledge of something that's been told
[44:59] you when the Holy Spirit comes down and
[45:01] quickens it it's revealed in your heart
[45:05] and now when you have a revelation what
[45:07] is faith faith is a revelation and when
[45:10] you've got a revelation about Divine
[45:11] Healing for you personally Jesus Christ
[45:13] is the Healer there is no other he says
[45:16] that bless the Lord oh my soul and
[45:17] forget not all his benefits who Health
[45:20] all thy
[45:21] diseases now who's that for well you
[45:24] know my grandma she was healed of cancer
[45:26] and I'm thaning for that and that was
[45:28] good for
[45:29] Grandma my grandpa he just had a he's 86
[45:34] now he just had a a heart failure and a
[45:35] heart attack and and and and God raised
[45:38] him up they they didn't he was dead dead
[45:40] and and my my uncle he grabbed a hold of
[45:42] him started working on his heart and
[45:44] they were able to get him back to life
[45:46] and and he recovered ex he had a great
[45:48] recovery right and that was the the Lord
[45:51] there's only one Healer that was the
[45:52] Lord healing my grandpa I'm thankful for
[45:54] that but you know a few more years he's
[45:56] going to CR over it's just you know way
[45:58] the life works and and and and so I'm
[46:00] thankful for grandpa that God healed him
[46:02] I'm thankful for Grandma but I've got
[46:06] needs there's things in my life and I'm
[46:08] thankful for what he did for them I'm
[46:10] thankful for what he did over here I'm
[46:11] thankful for what he did for the brother
[46:13] with back pain in church I'm thankful
[46:15] what he did for the sister with
[46:16] depression I'm thankful for that but
[46:18] it's for them and that's good but I need
[46:21] a personal revelation about healing for
[46:23] me because I have needs and as long long
[46:27] as it's just mechanics you could quote
[46:29] every quote you could read every
[46:31] scripture about and I'm just referencing
[46:32] healing but there's there's plenty of
[46:34] promises there's plenty of things in the
[46:36] word of God you could come right down to
[46:38] to the Rapture you say well the Rapture
[46:39] is for the bride well hold
[46:42] on you're saying it's for this person
[46:44] you're saying it's for Grandpa you're
[46:45] saying it's for the pastor you need a
[46:47] revelation you need a revelation that
[46:49] your name's on the book and you're a
[46:50] part of that you got to have a personal
[46:52] understanding and when that personal
[46:54] revelation comes to you now there's a
[46:56] power there yes when it's when it's not
[46:58] just you know I believe that you know
[47:00] the the the prophet was a Son of God and
[47:03] and he had the power of God and he and
[47:04] he did that's wonderful but when you get
[47:07] a personal revelation that I'm a part of
[47:09] this now there's a power in your life
[47:12] not just the Revelation the prophet had
[47:14] but now it's a revelation in your life
[47:16] and there's a power there's something
[47:17] that backs that up with an authority and
[47:19] and and and just recently uh last year
[47:22] I've had I've had migraines for 30 years
[47:25] and and just I've always strugg that I
[47:27] think I might have shared this but you
[47:29] know I I've struggled with that for
[47:30] years and the Lord actually told me 10
[47:32] years ago when I asked him I was like is
[47:34] this supposed to be here or not like did
[47:36] you put this in my life for a reason and
[47:38] he said no you can be healed I said
[47:40] wonderful Hallelujah and I saids I can
[47:42] be healed I can be healed and I kept
[47:44] leaving it at
[47:49] can and then the Lord just began to deal
[47:51] with me am in a service where the
[47:53] brother was preaching about fear yeah
[47:56] says why are you
[47:58] afraid to say this
[48:01] day this is when I'm going to accept it
[48:03] this is when I'm going to receive it and
[48:05] I realized I was afraid to step out and
[48:08] stand on a promise to God I knew it by
[48:10] the word and I knew it by direction of
[48:12] God to my heart that said it was for me
[48:14] and yet for 10 more years I had sat
[48:17] there with migraine headaches because I
[48:19] was afraid to say today and I realized I
[48:21] was actually waiting for me to be so
[48:23] good that God just rewarded me with
[48:25] healing right right I was waiting for
[48:28] for me to do something that was so
[48:29] wonderful he says I'm I just decided
[48:31] today I'm going to bless
[48:33] you you see Divine Healing isn't based
[48:36] off of how God's feeling about you it's
[48:39] off of a promise he said that he would
[48:43] heal you and if you will believe it if
[48:45] you will have faith you will receive it
[48:47] and so I realized that it's not based
[48:49] off of my works it's not based off of my
[48:51] Merit it's based off of his promise and
[48:53] I said all right then I'm going to stand
[48:55] on that promise I'm going to stand here
[48:57] and I'm going to confess that I'm Healed
[48:59] I'm going to believe that I'm Healed I'm
[49:01] going to testify that I'm Healed because
[49:03] it's something that I believe with all
[49:05] of my heart and I'm not going to push it
[49:07] off for another 50
[49:09] years and so I I had prayer that night
[49:12] and and I said brother there was a
[49:13] brother actually that just been healed
[49:14] of migraines I said sit down here I said
[49:16] what's this verse say it says where any
[49:17] to agree on any one thing it shall be
[49:20] done for them I said so you agree with
[49:22] me and it's going to be done and we
[49:24] prayed together and and I said I told my
[49:26] wife wife on the way home I says I've
[49:28] I've accepted my healing from migraines
[49:31] this night I says now I might NE I might
[49:34] have my migrain for another 25 years
[49:36] like Abraham did waiting for the promise
[49:38] I says or I I never have another one in
[49:40] my life I says but that does not change
[49:42] the fact that I am
[49:44] healed so I took the next opportunity I
[49:47] had to go and and and uh run around a
[49:50] lot playing a game of basketball and get
[49:51] overheated which would which is what
[49:53] would trigger a migraine and so I went
[49:55] and did that because I said I want to
[49:57] find out you know I want to I don't want
[49:58] to just sit around say well I don't want
[50:00] to do that that might cause a
[50:01] migraine because I'm Healed and so I ran
[50:04] around and I played basketball and
[50:06] couple hours later I was bent over a
[50:08] trash can vomiting and saying thank you
[50:10] Lord for healing
[50:11] me because it's not based off of how I
[50:14] feel it's not based off of my condition
[50:16] it's based off of a promise of God that
[50:18] has nothing to do with these five senses
[50:21] and so I just kept confessing that I
[50:22] kept standing on that and and after a
[50:24] few months we'd went up to a a meeting
[50:27] up in Virginia and they were going to
[50:29] have a prayer line that night and they'
[50:30] asked me to help in the prayer line with
[50:32] the people and I was like well you know
[50:35] this could be a little bit rough cuz
[50:37] I've got this migraine today I I was
[50:39] that whole day that migraine and
[50:40] headache been building up and I was like
[50:42] well you know I'm going to be going up
[50:43] there to help somebody through the
[50:45] prayer line and maybe carry them out of
[50:47] the building and or tent in that case
[50:49] and and I was like and I'm going to be
[50:51] you know this pounding migr I was like
[50:53] well if I have to carry somebody out and
[50:54] then go over to the hill and vomit and
[50:56] come back in and help somebody else I'm
[50:57] going to do it because I believe that
[50:59] I'm Healed I've testified that I'm
[51:01] Healed I'm going to act like I'm Healed
[51:03] I am not going to give way to this
[51:05] attack of the devil and so I I walked up
[51:08] you know the brother was preaching on
[51:09] Jehovah Rafa Jehovah the Healer and I
[51:12] was I was back in the back saying amen
[51:14] and then you know just when you have a
[51:16] real migraine like that it just pounds
[51:17] into your you just wse from it but I was
[51:19] like I'm Amen to the word anyway I am
[51:22] not going to knck down to the devil I
[51:24] don't have to and so the brother was and
[51:27] and when they called that prayer line
[51:28] for all the brothers to come up I went
[51:29] up to the prayer line and I was standing
[51:31] there and all of a sudden I realized
[51:33] that migraine had left it had vanished
[51:36] migraines don't do that they don't just
[51:37] disappear like that and and and from
[51:39] that day to this my body has been
[51:43] healed but it it was something that had
[51:45] to be a personal revelation it had to be
[51:48] something not just God Is A Healer but
[51:50] he's my healer and he's the Healer of my
[51:53] migraines and I can stand here today and
[51:55] say I don't have that
[51:57] anymore now but if it just stays in the
[52:01] word of God the power is there oh the
[52:04] power is in the gasoline it's real and
[52:06] it's there and we've got the the message
[52:08] that has get got the mechanics and put
[52:10] them together properly we don't have the
[52:12] wheel attached to the to the to the
[52:14] ceiling we don't have the muffler
[52:16] attached to the steering wheel like we
[52:17] don't have all this chaos that they have
[52:19] in denominations God gave us a message
[52:21] to rightly put that mechanics together
[52:24] and then he showed us what the mechanics
[52:26] and the Dynamics together will do and it
[52:29] will bring manifested Sons and
[52:34] Daughters no matter how much the rising
[52:36] of the sun here no matter how much the
[52:38] mechanics proves to be right there has
[52:41] got to be a Dynamics to make it work and
[52:44] that's what he proved that's Hallelujah
[52:47] that's what Easter proved he wasn't only
[52:50] the word but he was God himself the
[52:53] Dynamics in the word
[52:57] oh we we have you know we have the word
[53:00] and that is essential you can't if you
[53:02] don't have the mechanics you ain't got
[53:04] going to be able to to get anything to
[53:06] happen but when you've got the mechanics
[53:08] which we have received and if you have
[53:11] received it and receive the correct
[53:13] teaching of the mechanics you know cuz
[53:15] you know you could sit in a message
[53:16] church and you could still have the you
[53:18] know the hubcaps you know on your
[53:20] windshield you know it doesn't mean that
[53:21] you've accepted it but when you accept
[53:23] the correct you know teaching on how
[53:25] that vehicle goes together and how those
[53:27] mechanics run together when you've
[53:29] received that you're in position for the
[53:32] full power of the Dynamics to make that
[53:35] vehicle move down the
[53:38] road but without him which was the
[53:43] resurrected Lord
[53:45] Jesus it ain't going to do nothing
[53:49] right
[53:51] now brother brandom talks about this
[53:54] this bride's Revival and and how you
[53:57] know as a young person I I hear
[53:58] different people talk about it and be
[54:00] like oh well you know you know this
[54:02] person's got the bride's Revival or you
[54:04] know the bride's Revival is over here in
[54:05] the seven Thunders or the bride's
[54:07] Revival and I I'd hear these different
[54:08] things and I'm like well I'm not exactly
[54:11] sure what they're talking about and
[54:12] things but you know as time went on I
[54:14] had a little bit of opportunity to to
[54:16] read some different things and and
[54:18] here's something here in the third seal
[54:20] and don't you have to notice this is
[54:23] actually in the seals that he's saying
[54:24] this cuz it's so striking when you get
[54:26] the whole picture but he said uh he said
[54:28] they've got millions and millions of
[54:30] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[54:33] now Revival is life right that's uh you
[54:37] take somebody that's on the point of
[54:38] death and they revive what happened well
[54:41] they came back to life he says but no
[54:44] Revival nowhere and he says the bride
[54:46] hasn't had a Revival yet see there's
[54:48] been no Revival there's no manifestation
[54:50] of God stir the bride yet he says we're
[54:53] looking for it and now a lot of people
[54:55] have taken that and they're like well
[54:57] you know someday off in the Millennium
[54:59] we're going to have a Revival but you're
[55:01] missing the picture he says he says
[55:04] we're looking for it it will take those
[55:06] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[55:09] wake her up now if you know what the
[55:11] seven Thunders are it's kind of ironic
[55:13] that he says this in the Seven Seals now
[55:16] he says he will send it he promised it
[55:18] now watch now she was dead right now
[55:24] that that that right there that
[55:25] statement right there people have taken
[55:27] it and they've run off in a lot of
[55:29] directions that aren't actually in align
[55:32] with the word if you'll stop and realize
[55:34] it but one of the major problems is the
[55:37] people they look for the bride's Revival
[55:40] to be carnal right they look for the
[55:43] bride's Revival to be glorifying man
[55:46] right that's right it it won't be
[55:48] glorifying man it'll be glorifying God
[55:51] it won't be glorifying a church or an
[55:53] individual or a Ministry it will be glor
[55:56] in God and and so this bride's Revival
[55:59] if we could step back and we could look
[56:01] at you know how God has moved in the
[56:03] past and and we look at the Mary and how
[56:07] you know we we read that a virgin shall
[56:09] conceive and she'll bring forth the son
[56:10] and it's going to be the Messiah and
[56:12] Emanuel is going to be here and and so
[56:14] in our minds we would think well you
[56:16] know here's Mary and and the way we
[56:18] would interpret the story would that you
[56:21] know the the newspapers had front lines
[56:23] that you know Mary has been found she
[56:26] was the Virgin that God had
[56:28] predestinated and for ordained and and
[56:30] she has conceived and the Messiah is
[56:32] coming soon and and all the priests are
[56:34] excited to to meet the coming King and
[56:36] and there was angels that told the
[56:38] message and let everybody know what was
[56:40] happening and and Mary's friends they're
[56:42] just so happy to be identified like I'm
[56:44] a friend of Mary like she's the one you
[56:46] know and and uh they're just you know
[56:47] it's such an honor to be associate way
[56:49] with her and and and it's it's just you
[56:51] know incredible times are happening that
[56:54] that would make sense from our Earthly
[56:56] perspective of the greatest event that
[56:58] had happened on the face of the Earth
[57:00] since it had been
[57:02] created but what was the reality yeah no
[57:06] one knew about it no one Joseph the
[57:10] predestinated one who was supposed to be
[57:12] there with Mary to take care of Jesus in
[57:15] his his young
[57:16] childhood he didn't even catch
[57:20] it he he couldn't believe it he's like
[57:22] that he was a Believer Joseph was a
[57:25] believer and yet it was a little hard
[57:28] for him to accept until an angel came to
[57:31] him and said listen you know this is
[57:33] actually according to the scripture
[57:34] everything's all right don't get worked
[57:36] up and and and he and he accepted it and
[57:39] and Mary's friends they weren't honored
[57:42] to be associated with her no they were
[57:47] ashamed they said you heard what
[57:49] happened to Mary you know she's she's
[57:51] claiming that it's this great spiritual
[57:53] thing but I mean I mean we're not naive
[57:58] and you know when the angel came to Mary
[58:01] she didn't even understand
[58:03] it but she said be it unto me according
[58:06] to that
[58:07] word God does things so differently than
[58:11] the ways of man God's ways are not the
[58:14] ways of man his ways are so much
[58:16] different he hides himself in Simplicity
[58:19] he does things in such a way that it
[58:21] would stumble the educated and the
[58:23] intelligent and and and he does it in a
[58:25] way that it would seem
[58:27] ridiculous but it's
[58:30] God the prophet here in in uh the church
[58:33] ages he says there's a great shaking
[58:35] amongst the elect great powerful things
[58:37] going on but the world knows nothing of
[58:40] it and he says how they're they're
[58:42] thinking for like television programs
[58:44] and million-dollar buildings and this is
[58:46] what they think would be a great move of
[58:48] God no he says what man calls foolish
[58:52] God calls great and what man calls great
[58:54] God calls foolish
[58:56] amen and uh there was a man Matson Bose
[59:00] he came from New York to Chicago and he
[59:02] had a desire he says he says I came here
[59:05] God put it on my heart and I've desired
[59:07] to see Chicago get a great shaking and
[59:10] brother Braham says to him your great
[59:11] desire has been fulfilled only I don't
[59:14] believe you understand it this man's
[59:17] desire his whole purpose in life to see
[59:19] Chicago shaken and he doesn't even
[59:22] understand when it happens right and
[59:25] again another place he says Joseph
[59:27] you've seen Chicago get its last call
[59:29] that's right and God honored you done
[59:32] just exactly what he said getting the
[59:35] bride ready that's what it
[59:37] is you see it wasn't all of Chicago that
[59:40] was ordained to be a part of that bride
[59:42] but there was just a couple of them
[59:44] there in that entire city of Chicago
[59:46] that mats and Bose had gathered together
[59:48] and he called in God's Prophet to bring
[59:50] the message to them and that people
[59:53] receiving that message getting ready for
[59:54] that Rapture out of all of Chicago that
[59:57] was the great shaking of Chicago right
[1:00:00] one or two
[1:00:02] people but look at God's economy you
[1:00:05] know how many people did God bring out
[1:00:07] of Sodom yeah yeah and that was great
[1:00:11] Angelic move you know how many thousands
[1:00:14] were up there with
[1:00:16] Abraham no just Abraham sitting by
[1:00:18] himself and his wife back in the tent
[1:00:21] laughing what we would think would be
[1:00:23] the great you know Elohim has come down
[1:00:26] the son of man is being revealed all of
[1:00:28] these things and and it's it's the Great
[1:00:30] Mighty God meeting with
[1:00:32] Abraham no one understood it right amen
[1:00:37] like God does things in a way that human
[1:00:41] thinking misses
[1:00:43] it over here in uh in time evangelism he
[1:00:47] says uh he's talking about how uh he
[1:00:50] says according to Malachi 4 is to bring
[1:00:52] them back well he says now we're going
[1:00:55] to the end right here by saying this the
[1:00:57] end time message is to get the bride
[1:01:00] ready and prepared for the Rapture
[1:01:03] according to Malik for is to bring back
[1:01:05] to the faith that was once delivered to
[1:01:07] the Saints bring them back to the faith
[1:01:09] of the fathers the Pentecostal part in
[1:01:11] the restoration time I will restore
[1:01:14] saith the Lord that's real event in time
[1:01:17] evangelism the Turning of the hearts
[1:01:19] back to the Pentecostal foundation of
[1:01:22] the church not Aza street but back to
[1:01:24] the foundation of what happened on the
[1:01:27] day of Pentecost when the quickening
[1:01:29] power came down and people were
[1:01:31] transformed now that's the that's the
[1:01:34] restoration that's supposed to happen
[1:01:35] it's through the ministry of Malachi 4
[1:01:38] and so that if you if you look at this
[1:01:41] this is that Revival this is the great
[1:01:43] thing that's supposed to happen getting
[1:01:45] a bride ready for a Rapture that's the
[1:01:47] great thing that's the great move that's
[1:01:49] the thing that's that's Shaking All
[1:01:51] heavens and earth but you know if if if
[1:01:54] if you're not a part of that bride come
[1:01:56] on it might not mean anything to you
[1:01:59] thank you Lord Ezekiel 37 and4 and he
[1:02:02] says again he said unto me prophesy upon
[1:02:05] these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry
[1:02:08] Bones hear the word of the
[1:02:10] Lord how can bones hear they ain't got
[1:02:14] no brain they ain't got no intellect
[1:02:16] those brain bones or those ear bones
[1:02:18] have fallen long ago but you see there
[1:02:20] was a prophecy going forth and if
[1:02:22] there's a prophecy going forth there's
[1:02:24] going to be something to respond to
[1:02:26] because prophecy is not a man speaking
[1:02:30] prophecy is not the words of a man
[1:02:33] prophecy is the word of God spoken
[1:02:35] through a human vessel and Hallelujah
[1:02:40] many people don't recognize this picture
[1:02:42] because they think it's a picture of
[1:02:44] brother brandham now this is no more a
[1:02:46] picture of brother brandham than it is a
[1:02:47] picture of a tie right now there's a tie
[1:02:49] in the picture certainly and there's a
[1:02:52] suit in the picture certainly but this
[1:02:54] is not a picture of William brandom this
[1:02:56] is a picture of the pillar of fire that
[1:02:58] led the children out of Egypt this is a
[1:03:00] picture of the pillar of fire that met
[1:03:02] Paul on the road to Damascus that is
[1:03:04] what this picture is about now he was
[1:03:06] pleased to be identified with that
[1:03:08] prophet he was pleased to have his
[1:03:10] picture taken with him but this picture
[1:03:12] is the picture of the pillar of fire and
[1:03:14] this message that we have received did
[1:03:17] not come from this man this message that
[1:03:19] we have received came from that man it
[1:03:22] came from the Lord Jesus Christ through
[1:03:24] this vessel and it was given to us but
[1:03:26] this message is not the thoughts of a
[1:03:28] man it's not the ideas of a man it is
[1:03:31] the word of God to a generation then we
[1:03:33] call that the message of the hour now
[1:03:38] the there's many people who they look at
[1:03:40] it and they say well you know this is
[1:03:42] Brother brandom's message no this is
[1:03:44] Christ's message and in fact he says in
[1:03:47] the token message he says the message is
[1:03:51] Christ because Christ is the word in the
[1:03:54] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:03:56] was with God now that word is logos
[1:03:58] that's the pillar of fire the pillar of
[1:04:00] fire was there in the beginning and that
[1:04:02] Pillar of Fire has come down and through
[1:04:05] that prophetic message through the
[1:04:07] revealing of the son of man that Pillar
[1:04:08] of Fire has now come into fleshly
[1:04:11] Tabernacles and we have the word made
[1:04:14] flesh in a body we've seen that
[1:04:16] displayed beautifully in the prophetic
[1:04:18] Ministry of William brandham but I
[1:04:19] challenge you this morning did God stay
[1:04:22] back
[1:04:23] there where is he at right now where is
[1:04:26] God tabernacled in flesh where is the
[1:04:28] logos that logos is in a body it's in
[1:04:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ it is the
[1:04:33] revealing of the word made flesh in a
[1:04:35] people Jesus is the groom the bride will
[1:04:39] be exactly the same as him he was the
[1:04:41] word and the spirit of God come down in
[1:04:44] a tabernacle the logos made flesh this
[1:04:47] bride has received the full pure word of
[1:04:50] God she has received that logos power of
[1:04:53] God that is what she is tabernac
[1:04:56] and Mr Jesus Christ and Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:05:00] are the
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:04] same so this prophecy is not well you
[1:05:08] know Ezekiel had this great idea to
[1:05:10] prophesy to these bones no it wasn't his
[1:05:13] idea he didn't even think it was
[1:05:14] possible but he said you know you God
[1:05:18] you know and he said now you prophesy
[1:05:20] upon these bones and say thus saith the
[1:05:23] Lord God upon unto these bones be behold
[1:05:26] now I want you to realize this speaks of
[1:05:28] the Christian church this speaks right
[1:05:30] here of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:05:33] how that Through the Ages there was a
[1:05:35] death in and you see in in the beginning
[1:05:37] they came forth and they were in life
[1:05:39] but then in the Dark Ages that seed that
[1:05:41] church that bride she went down into the
[1:05:43] grave And Then There came forth there
[1:05:45] began to come a restoration of of a
[1:05:48] resurrection out of that out through
[1:05:49] Martin Luther John Wesley but this is
[1:05:51] speaking of the Bride he says prophesy
[1:05:54] upon these bones and and and be he says
[1:05:56] behold I will cause breath to enter into
[1:05:59] you and ye shall live now I want you to
[1:06:01] notice he starts at the end he doesn't
[1:06:04] say well I'm going to see what I can do
[1:06:07] with these these Dry Bones I don't know
[1:06:08] how far I can get he just goes straight
[1:06:10] to the end he says I'm going to make you
[1:06:12] live that's the beginning of the
[1:06:14] prophecy and God is not looking at this
[1:06:16] bride and saying well I'm going to see
[1:06:18] how far I can get her I'm going to see
[1:06:19] what I can do maybe I can get him to
[1:06:21] believe enough for healing maybe I can
[1:06:22] get him enough no he's got the end
[1:06:24] picture in VI he already knows exactly
[1:06:27] where he's taking you he's given us a
[1:06:29] message that tells us he's taking us to
[1:06:31] a wedding supper he's taking us to a
[1:06:33] millennial rain we know what the future
[1:06:35] home is for us we've received that we
[1:06:37] know it and we're not just hoping we're
[1:06:39] going to make it because it's not our
[1:06:42] ability it's that's good what does it
[1:06:46] take for a Rapture many times we say
[1:06:48] rapturing faith and that's certainly
[1:06:49] true but you know how many times brother
[1:06:51] brandom called it rapturing Grace
[1:06:56] forget your Works he says thus sayith
[1:06:59] the Lord unto these bones behold I will
[1:07:01] cause breath to enter into you and ye
[1:07:02] shall live and I will lay sinus upon you
[1:07:05] and I will bring up flesh upon you and
[1:07:07] cover your skin with and put breath in
[1:07:09] you and ye shall live and you shall know
[1:07:11] that I am the Lord now if you go to
[1:07:14] Restoration of the brid tree brother
[1:07:15] Braham talks about this he talks about
[1:07:17] how there was four messengers of death
[1:07:19] and there's going to be four messengers
[1:07:20] of life he shows how justification with
[1:07:22] Martin Luther John Wesley sanctification
[1:07:24] he says the rest restoration of joy and
[1:07:26] of the gifts with with the the the the
[1:07:29] Pentecostal movement he says but then
[1:07:31] that four messenger of life he says
[1:07:33] what's the four stages of Ezekiel dry
[1:07:35] bone so he ties those two together the
[1:07:37] brid tree and the restoration of the
[1:07:39] restoration of the Bride tree and
[1:07:41] ezekiel's Bones he links them together
[1:07:43] and he says now what's what's that
[1:07:45] fourth one he says that that that's that
[1:07:47] fourth message of life and he calls it
[1:07:50] right here he says what that fourth was
[1:07:53] the word itself the word word made
[1:07:57] flesh and so there's there's there's
[1:07:59] there's there's a justification
[1:08:00] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:02] that that move of the Pentecostal move
[1:08:04] all of those things what happened there
[1:08:05] that's good that's wonderful but you see
[1:08:07] there was still no true life in there
[1:08:10] the mechanics and the Dynamics had not
[1:08:12] come together in the power until we
[1:08:14] received the word message that
[1:08:16] established the church in its rightful
[1:08:19] place and so Ezekiel here 37-7 he says I
[1:08:24] prophesied as I came up with an idea no
[1:08:28] I prophesied my new idea no no no no no
[1:08:31] I prophesied my opinion no that's not
[1:08:32] what a prophet does so I prophesied as I
[1:08:35] was commanded and as I prophesied there
[1:08:38] was a noise and behold a shaking of the
[1:08:41] bones came together bone to his bone and
[1:08:44] then we see the sinus and the Flesh and
[1:08:46] the skin covered them up but then in the
[1:08:48] ninth verse but it says but there was no
[1:08:51] breath in them so we see the church came
[1:08:54] together and and that's where the
[1:08:56] Prophet came to that Pentecostal church
[1:08:57] it was so close he's like everything
[1:08:59] looks good like you you've got these
[1:09:01] things in order you've got gifts in the
[1:09:03] church you got all these things you know
[1:09:05] he says this is good this is really good
[1:09:07] but there's no
[1:09:09] life there's no spirit in there to make
[1:09:13] it live and stand up under the power of
[1:09:16] God and and so he was just he was he
[1:09:19] brother brandom he came to that church
[1:09:21] and he found it just in that condition
[1:09:24] where it was it was so close but like
[1:09:27] the rich younger just lacked one
[1:09:30] thing and he says then said he unto me
[1:09:33] prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
[1:09:35] man and say to the wind thus sayith the
[1:09:37] Lord God come from the Four Winds o
[1:09:39] breath and breathe upon the slain that
[1:09:41] they may live so I prophesied as he
[1:09:44] commanded me and the breath came into
[1:09:46] them and they lived and stood up upon
[1:09:49] their feet this is the Bride of Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ this is the the restoration of
[1:09:54] the Bride tree she stood and she came up
[1:09:56] on her feet and she was just a defeated
[1:09:58] little body of worn out
[1:10:00] Christians no that's that's not what the
[1:10:02] scripture says it says and she stood up
[1:10:05] on her feet an exceeding great Army Hall
[1:10:10] that's what this bride is this message
[1:10:13] has come we have received a Word of Life
[1:10:15] and this church has raised up as an
[1:10:17] exceeding great Army it's equipped for
[1:10:19] war it's ready for battle it's not a
[1:10:21] bride that's just defeated and cowed
[1:10:23] down the devil's lying to you the deity
[1:10:26] is not in heaven it's in you you need to
[1:10:28] recognize your position you need to
[1:10:30] recognize who you are and stand upon
[1:10:32] that
[1:10:33] word the Vindicated word in his body is
[1:10:38] his very R Victory and the reason of his
[1:10:42] death Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:10:45] this bride is the reason of his death he
[1:10:49] died for a purpose and that was that his
[1:10:52] body could be a Victorious Church amen
[1:10:56] he says here Quicken means Made Alive
[1:10:58] his flesh which was his body and that's
[1:11:01] the word it's been laying dead for years
[1:11:04] but it gradually begun to come to in the
[1:11:06] reformation and now she is standing upon
[1:11:10] her feet hallelujah oh friends we have
[1:11:14] been we have received a word of Prophecy
[1:11:16] for this hour concerning this bride she
[1:11:19] is not a defeated Church she is a
[1:11:21] Victorious Army she is in fact an
[1:11:23] invincible Army now if you need an
[1:11:25] invincible Army that probably means you
[1:11:27] got a pretty rough battle so don't be
[1:11:30] surprised that there's a really great
[1:11:32] struggle and a really great Warfare you
[1:11:34] know God doesn't you don't send
[1:11:35] Invincible soldiers into a picnic cuz
[1:11:38] you really don't need him at a picnic
[1:11:40] but in this hour there is a bride who is
[1:11:42] an invincible Army and she's facing
[1:11:45] everything that hell got to offer
[1:11:47] against her and God standing there
[1:11:51] proving that his power is greater than
[1:11:54] the devil proving that he can come down
[1:11:56] and he can take control of mortal bodies
[1:11:59] and through those mortal bodies resist
[1:12:01] everything that the devil would try and
[1:12:03] do he's proving the victory of Jesus
[1:12:06] Christ that the Holy Ghost actually
[1:12:08] works thank you Lord now those bones
[1:12:12] those they could not do anything until
[1:12:14] they received that word of Prophecy but
[1:12:17] when that word of Prophecy came they
[1:12:19] began to manifest what was prophesied
[1:12:22] and in each generation there is a word
[1:12:25] that is given each generation has its
[1:12:27] own chance at the word its own chance at
[1:12:29] Revival but you you've got to recognize
[1:12:32] that there's only so much word that's
[1:12:33] allotted to each generation in in the
[1:12:36] days of Martin Luther there was a
[1:12:37] certain word for that hour and in the
[1:12:39] days of John Wesley there was a certain
[1:12:40] word for that hour and you got to
[1:12:42] recognize in each hour there's an
[1:12:44] allotted word there's a certain thing
[1:12:46] that's supposed to happen in that hour
[1:12:48] so I ask you what's allotted to be
[1:12:51] manifested in this generation oh myow
[1:12:54] what's the word for this generation are
[1:12:56] we supposed to you know come out of
[1:12:59] Catholicism it's not really the word for
[1:13:01] us I mean you shouldn't be in there but
[1:13:03] that's not the the driving point of this
[1:13:06] hour the driving point of this hour is
[1:13:09] to come out of this entire world system
[1:13:12] and be caught up in Rapture that's the
[1:13:15] goal that's where we're headed and we're
[1:13:17] called to be up in an astronaut age into
[1:13:19] a bride age we're coming out of all of
[1:13:21] this darkness of Lea and the confusion
[1:13:24] around us and we've been coming up into
[1:13:26] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we
[1:13:29] we we're still it's all around us but
[1:13:31] we're not a part of it
[1:13:34] Hallelujah in this hour we have the
[1:13:37] promise of the restoration of all things
[1:13:40] now I want you to notice in Ephesians
[1:13:42] chapter 1:14 he and I can't I can't uh
[1:13:46] I'm not going to take you on your word
[1:13:48] there brother Dale and take four hours
[1:13:50] but I can't teach it just all out but it
[1:13:53] says right here in Ephesians 1:14
[1:13:55] speaking of the Holy Ghost That
[1:13:56] quickening Power which is the earnest of
[1:13:58] our inheritance until the Redemption of
[1:14:00] the purchased possession so Redemption
[1:14:03] of the purchased possession I could go
[1:14:05] and I could buy this water bottle and
[1:14:07] and so let's say I didn't bring my
[1:14:09] wallet but let's say you've got this all
[1:14:11] right and I'm like you know I'd really
[1:14:13] like that you know I'll I'll I'll give
[1:14:15] you a cough drop to buy that from you
[1:14:16] all right so I give you the cough drop I
[1:14:18] says now that's mine now we I paid for
[1:14:21] it I've I purchased it it belongs to me
[1:14:24] we the contract's done all right but I
[1:14:28] don't hold it in my hand right now I
[1:14:30] haven't taken it back to where it came
[1:14:32] from yet there's now the price is paid
[1:14:35] and at Calvary Jesus Christ paid the
[1:14:37] price it was a settled finished matter
[1:14:40] the price was paid and yet the
[1:14:43] Redemption or the restoration of the
[1:14:45] purchased possession to bring what was
[1:14:47] purchased now what was purchased at
[1:14:49] Calvary well we could go another 5 hours
[1:14:52] on that but you know uh to to every
[1:14:55] everything was settled at Calvary and
[1:14:58] right down to the very earth the earth
[1:15:00] that received the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:15:02] was Redeemed by that and yet it has not
[1:15:04] received the full benefits of its
[1:15:05] Redemption and so this Earth is still
[1:15:07] groaning and crying out waiting for the
[1:15:11] sons of God to come into their
[1:15:14] position and in this hour you see they
[1:15:16] could not come into their position in in
[1:15:19] Martin Luther's day that wasn't the word
[1:15:21] for that hour but there comes an hour
[1:15:23] there comes a message that brings a full
[1:15:25] restoration all the way back to where it
[1:15:27] was at the beginning and the price that
[1:15:29] was paid at Calvary what the Jesus
[1:15:32] Christ paid for at Calvary God sends a
[1:15:34] message in the last days to restore
[1:15:37] remember Jesus said Elias truly shall
[1:15:39] first come and restore all things and so
[1:15:43] what Jesus Christ paid for at the cross
[1:15:46] through this last day message we have
[1:15:48] the restoration of all things back to
[1:15:51] its rightful position you say well what
[1:15:53] does that mean well means that you as a
[1:15:56] son or a daughter of God could go all
[1:15:59] the way back to the position Adam was in
[1:16:01] the Garden of
[1:16:03] Eden you could speak and the winds and
[1:16:05] the waves would obey you you could speak
[1:16:07] and a squirrel would come into existence
[1:16:09] you say that sounds pretty crazy yeah
[1:16:11] maybe it does to you but we're in that
[1:16:14] hour of the restoration of all things
[1:16:17] we're in the hour when this has been
[1:16:19] restored back to the church it's been
[1:16:20] restored not just back to you know
[1:16:23] Paul's day not just back to Martin
[1:16:25] Luther's day we've had a restoration of
[1:16:26] all things which takes us all the way
[1:16:28] back to the Garden of Eden condition
[1:16:31] where a man can have fellowship with God
[1:16:33] and walk with him in the cool of the
[1:16:35] evening and where the power of of the
[1:16:37] the power of God is invested back into
[1:16:40] the
[1:16:41] individual full sunship you see the
[1:16:44] whole earth has been crying out groaning
[1:16:47] waiting for the hour when sons of God
[1:16:50] would come to their position
[1:16:53] am when's that going to be thank you
[1:16:56] Jesus it's right now right now the
[1:16:59] seventh Angel's message William
[1:17:01] brandom's Ministry brought the
[1:17:03] restoration of all things to the church
[1:17:05] now the question is are you going to let
[1:17:07] it sit on the shelf and let somebody
[1:17:09] else manifest that or is there something
[1:17:11] inside of you that says that's not just
[1:17:13] for brother Zachary that's not just for
[1:17:15] William brandom that's not just for
[1:17:16] brother Dale but I believe I'm a part of
[1:17:19] that I believe I'm a part of that
[1:17:20] restoration of all things that is for me
[1:17:23] I identify that that's my prophecy you
[1:17:26] see Mary could stand there and she could
[1:17:28] read a virgin shall conceive but one day
[1:17:31] it went from being a story about
[1:17:32] somebody to it she said I am the one
[1:17:35] that the prophecy spoke of it is in my
[1:17:38] life that this is going to be manifest
[1:17:40] I'm the one that has been chosen to
[1:17:41] bring forth the Messiah and I say to you
[1:17:44] you can read the scriptures you can read
[1:17:45] the prophecies you can hear the tapes
[1:17:47] but someday there's got to come a moment
[1:17:49] when suddenly your eyes come open and
[1:17:51] that quickening power of God reveals to
[1:17:53] your heart that you're a part of this
[1:17:55] prophecy you're the one that God sent a
[1:17:57] message to there was a people on the
[1:17:59] Earth that God took the time to send a
[1:18:02] message to who was it he was the Bride
[1:18:04] of Jesus Christ and until you can
[1:18:07] identify and say that's me yes you'll
[1:18:11] sit there and you'll sit there and there
[1:18:13] ain't going to be no power moving in
[1:18:15] your life but when that Revelation
[1:18:18] strikes when that quickening power comes
[1:18:20] down and it ignites the Dynamics and
[1:18:22] there's a power of God that releases
[1:18:24] you're going to go somewhere what we
[1:18:26] call well we call it a Rapture you're
[1:18:29] going to go somewhere Hallelujah you see
[1:18:32] in in uh Revelations chapter 1 and 14 he
[1:18:35] said that he seen him and his hairs were
[1:18:37] as white as wool and and he turned and
[1:18:39] he looked and and it was Jesus Christ
[1:18:41] standing there with that white wig of
[1:18:43] supreme authority on now now why is that
[1:18:46] important why am I bringing this out I'm
[1:18:48] trying to establish you to realize the
[1:18:51] confidence that we can have in the word
[1:18:53] that we have received you see that white
[1:18:55] wig speaks of supreme authority Satan
[1:18:58] does not like supreme authority because
[1:19:00] it goes over top of his
[1:19:01] head right and there on Sunset Mountain
[1:19:06] the prophet said that Jesus Christ came
[1:19:08] down and gave him a message gave him the
[1:19:11] word to open to the people and it was
[1:19:13] the wigged judge it was the supreme
[1:19:16] authority what does that mean what does
[1:19:18] it mean well it means that nobody can
[1:19:20] argue with supreme authority nobody can
[1:19:23] raise an objection say well you know I
[1:19:24] have a different idea forget it supreme
[1:19:26] authority has spoken this message did
[1:19:29] not come from the thoughts of a man it
[1:19:32] came from supreme authority and so you
[1:19:34] can have Supreme confidence to believe
[1:19:37] what's been given to
[1:19:39] you there is no other one that Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ is the supreme authority he is
[1:19:45] the Supreme deity of heavens and earth
[1:19:47] it's the fundamental revelation of the
[1:19:49] whole thing is to recognize the Supreme
[1:19:51] deity of Jesus Christ and it is that
[1:19:53] same Jesus Christ that came down and
[1:19:56] gave us the message that we have and we
[1:19:59] have that picture taken there on Sunset
[1:20:01] mountain or throughout Arizona showing
[1:20:04] that it was Jesus Christ come down
[1:20:06] Revelations 10 the mighty angel coming
[1:20:08] down to give us a message to give us a
[1:20:11] word now I ask you what is that
[1:20:13] Revelation what is that word what was
[1:20:15] that
[1:20:16] book well we're going to read here in
[1:20:18] Revelations 10 for a moment and I saw
[1:20:20] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:20:21] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:20:23] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:20:25] were as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:20:26] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:20:28] little book open now if you trace that
[1:20:30] book that's what Adam had and lost amen
[1:20:33] and he was set his right foot upon the
[1:20:35] sea and his left foot upon the Earth and
[1:20:37] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:20:39] lion Roth and when he cried seven
[1:20:41] Thunders uttered their voices now
[1:20:43] remember what the prophet said he says
[1:20:45] those seven Thunders is where the great
[1:20:46] Revival is for the
[1:20:48] church right
[1:20:53] now drop backing to acts 3:20 he said
[1:20:56] and he shall send Jesus Christ which was
[1:20:58] before preached unto you whom the
[1:20:59] heavens must receive until the times of
[1:21:02] the restitution of all
[1:21:05] things so there comes a time when Christ
[1:21:07] comes back in a Ministry to the church
[1:21:11] there comes a time when we have the the
[1:21:13] the the Christ the lord himself shall
[1:21:15] descend from heaven with a message with
[1:21:19] a
[1:21:20] shout that's what we see happening there
[1:21:22] on Sunset mountain and he says this
[1:21:25] happened on Sunset message at the at in
[1:21:27] the evening time the sunset time the
[1:21:29] sunset message there's a setting of A
[1:21:31] History A setting of Prophecy rather and
[1:21:33] and and he says here what happened upon
[1:21:35] Mount Sunset God confirming his word
[1:21:37] that's what all this noise is about it's
[1:21:40] God fulfilling his promised word again
[1:21:42] of Revelations 10
[1:21:44] 1-7 now what happened on Sunset Mountain
[1:21:47] Revelations 10 1-7 being fulfilled it's
[1:21:49] what he Prophet just said right here and
[1:21:51] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:21:52] seventh Angel's message the mystery of
[1:21:54] God should be finished the hidden
[1:21:56] Mystery of Revelations 10: 1-7 the last
[1:21:58] message to the last Church age fulfills
[1:22:01] exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the
[1:22:03] day when the son of man shall be
[1:22:06] revealed now why is this so important
[1:22:10] that we recognize the Vindication
[1:22:13] because when you recognize the
[1:22:14] Vindication the Vindication gives
[1:22:16] Authority and it takes away the doubt
[1:22:19] you see I could stand here and I could
[1:22:20] tell you you know there was a man named
[1:22:23] Yeshua and he said that you were healed
[1:22:25] but you're like well who's Yeshua well
[1:22:28] you know it's actually Jesus well you
[1:22:30] know who's Jesus well he was the son of
[1:22:32] God he was sent to the Earth and when
[1:22:34] you begin to give the Vindication or the
[1:22:37] Authority for what's being said then you
[1:22:39] can have a faith in it you know if I
[1:22:41] told you that you know if I walked up
[1:22:43] and I said you know the president's
[1:22:44] going to give you a million dollars you
[1:22:46] say well you know how much taxes am I
[1:22:49] going to have to pay on that no you say
[1:22:50] well like well how uh how do you like
[1:22:53] why should I believe you
[1:22:55] why why would you accept what I'm saying
[1:22:57] I'd have to show you some
[1:22:59] Vindication you see back in the days of
[1:23:01] England there was a man and he was just
[1:23:03] a brother Bram called him a cockney he
[1:23:05] was just a a regular old man there and
[1:23:06] he was standing there near the king's
[1:23:08] Palace and the King comes up to the gate
[1:23:10] and he's got he's got a message that he
[1:23:12] needs to send out there was this man
[1:23:14] standing there and he said I I need to
[1:23:17] send the message it needs to go over
[1:23:18] here we need to tell the the enemy is
[1:23:20] coming from this direction we need the
[1:23:21] troops to move up right here he says
[1:23:23] take this take my message here and run
[1:23:25] with it to a certain person and he says
[1:23:27] and take my
[1:23:30] scepter he says if anybody tries to stop
[1:23:33] you you show them that scepter and
[1:23:35] they'll recognize the Vindication
[1:23:37] they'll recognize you're carrying a
[1:23:39] message from the King and they'll move
[1:23:41] out of the way they might they wouldn't
[1:23:42] believe him if he didn't have the
[1:23:45] Vindication but with the Vindication if
[1:23:48] they tried to stop it they had all the
[1:23:50] power of the United Kingdom to come
[1:23:52] against them because when they tried to
[1:23:53] stand against against the Vindication
[1:23:55] they were standing against the supreme
[1:23:57] authority of that Nation yes that's
[1:23:59] right yes sir and in this day God sent
[1:24:02] us a
[1:24:03] message you know that little man he took
[1:24:05] off running he took off running with
[1:24:07] that message people would try to stop
[1:24:08] him he'd wave that scepter he said get
[1:24:10] out of the way I've got the king's
[1:24:12] message get out of my way I'm carrying
[1:24:15] the message of the king and and and when
[1:24:17] you realize that you're not just
[1:24:19] carrying the the thoughts of William
[1:24:21] brandom you're not just carrying the
[1:24:23] ideas of some preacher but you're
[1:24:25] carrying a Vindicated message you're
[1:24:28] carrying something that's been
[1:24:29] Vindicated by the pillar of Fire by the
[1:24:31] pillar of cloud by the supernatural by
[1:24:33] the manifestation of the revealing of
[1:24:34] the son of man when you realize you're
[1:24:36] carrying a Vindicated word when you
[1:24:38] could look the hell right in the face
[1:24:40] and you say get out of the way I've got
[1:24:41] the king's message I don't care how many
[1:24:43] people try to stop me it's Vindicated
[1:24:45] you look at the Vindication you see this
[1:24:48] this is from the
[1:24:50] King and that gives me a confidence
[1:24:52] because if I had to go on my own
[1:24:54] authority if I had to carry my own word
[1:24:56] I'd be like well I don't know I don't
[1:24:57] know but when I know it's the king's
[1:25:01] message I've got a word that comes from
[1:25:04] the King that I can tell the devil you
[1:25:06] get out of my way I can stand there and
[1:25:09] preach to 100 denominational preachers I
[1:25:12] don't have to back up I don't have to
[1:25:14] you know work around I can tell them the
[1:25:17] word of God and I don't care what their
[1:25:19] Seminary says I don't care what their
[1:25:20] theology says I don't care what all
[1:25:22] their commentary books say I've got the
[1:25:24] King's
[1:25:25] message and it's
[1:25:29] Vindicated
[1:25:30] now this this seven Thunders that came
[1:25:33] forth and and all these things that you
[1:25:34] know it sounds real mysterious and
[1:25:36] people have taken that and you know made
[1:25:37] a lot out of it and brother Braham said
[1:25:39] it would take those seven Thunders to
[1:25:41] bring the Revival and but here in
[1:25:43] questions and answers
[1:25:45] 1964 they asked the question about the
[1:25:48] Thunders he says have have they already
[1:25:50] been revealed or were were they revealed
[1:25:53] in the seals and and we just don't know
[1:25:55] about it and he says well he says no
[1:25:59] they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:26:02] that's what the Thunders was about amen
[1:26:05] the seven Thunders now a thunder is a
[1:26:08] voice it's a voice of God the seven
[1:26:10] Thunders and the Seven Seals were the
[1:26:12] same
[1:26:13] thing now why does that matter why why
[1:26:17] is that the bride's Revival why does it
[1:26:19] take that you see because it's the
[1:26:21] opening of the word it's what Adam had
[1:26:24] it's what Adam lost now it's opened now
[1:26:27] it's restored the revelation of our
[1:26:29] identity in Christ Jesus has been
[1:26:31] restored to the church and if that don't
[1:26:34] give you a Revival I don't know what
[1:26:36] would and when John the Revelator you
[1:26:38] see John standing there and he's looking
[1:26:40] who is worthy to take that book because
[1:26:43] in that book was the redemp was the
[1:26:45] Redemption of the Earth the title deed
[1:26:47] to the Earth in that book was the the
[1:26:49] right to eternal life in that book was
[1:26:51] everything that we have need of and if
[1:26:53] you look at at it it's actually that
[1:26:55] book is revelation because when you get
[1:26:59] a revelation of your sunship now you've
[1:27:01] got a position of authority when you get
[1:27:03] a revelation of these things cuz you
[1:27:05] know if it was just it wasn't a paper
[1:27:07] book it wasn't you know a tree that
[1:27:08] they'd cut down and made up into pulp
[1:27:10] and they were carrying around it was a
[1:27:12] revelation of the word of God and of
[1:27:15] their position in it amen and he took
[1:27:19] the and and John he's looking there he
[1:27:21] says who can who can tear off the seals
[1:27:23] who can give this book to man because
[1:27:25] that Revelation was not meant to be held
[1:27:27] by God he he God didn't need that but
[1:27:30] that book was a book for man and God
[1:27:32] wanted that book to be in the hand of
[1:27:34] man and it was in Adam's hand but Adam
[1:27:36] fell by sin and when he fell by sin he
[1:27:39] lost possession of that book of the of
[1:27:41] the Redemption that that book of life
[1:27:44] and it went back to the hands of God but
[1:27:46] it was meant for man and so there had to
[1:27:48] be a Kinsman and John's weeping and
[1:27:49] wailing oh who's going to who's going to
[1:27:51] take the seals off that book who's
[1:27:53] worthy who could do it and finally there
[1:27:55] was found not an angel not a not a
[1:27:59] spirit being there was a man he was a
[1:28:02] bleeding bloody wounded lamb and he
[1:28:05] stepped forward and he said I'm
[1:28:07] worthy I'm worthy to take that book and
[1:28:10] he took that book and the prophet said
[1:28:12] he took the book and he tore off the
[1:28:15] seals he he took the book opened the
[1:28:17] book tore off the seals and sent it down
[1:28:19] to the Earth to his seventh angel to
[1:28:21] reveal it to his people
[1:28:24] that's what we see in Revelations 10:7
[1:28:27] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:28:28] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:28:30] mystery of God should be finished now
[1:28:32] keep reading now John the bride walks up
[1:28:34] and says now you give me that book I
[1:28:37] want to receive it it's for me and so we
[1:28:40] see here John when he seen that book
[1:28:42] come open in heaven and he realized that
[1:28:44] there was a one that was found worthy
[1:28:46] when those seven Thunders came forth
[1:28:48] when that book came open John began to
[1:28:51] scream and he began to shout and he
[1:28:53] began to yell all across Heaven he had
[1:28:55] such a screaming fit until everything in
[1:28:57] heaven heard him everything in Earth
[1:28:59] heard him and everything under the Earth
[1:29:00] heard him everything from Heaven to Hell
[1:29:02] heard John glorifying and praising God
[1:29:05] why because the Seven Seals came open
[1:29:09] why because when they came open he
[1:29:11] looked in there and he seen he was a
[1:29:13] part of it he looked in there and he
[1:29:15] says there's John I found my name I
[1:29:18] found my identification he caught a
[1:29:20] revelation that he was a part of this
[1:29:22] from the very beginning before the
[1:29:24] foundation of the world when the sons of
[1:29:26] God were shouting for Joy they were
[1:29:28] shouting because their names were being
[1:29:30] written down on that Lamb's Book of Life
[1:29:31] and John caught a revelation of who he
[1:29:34] was and that he was a part of this from
[1:29:36] before the foundation of the world and
[1:29:38] if you catch a revelation of
[1:29:40] predestination it'll put such a joy in
[1:29:43] your heart it takes away all the worries
[1:29:45] all the fears All the nervousness when
[1:29:47] you realize that you couldn't be lost
[1:29:48] any more than God could be lost because
[1:29:51] you're are a part of him from the
[1:29:52] foundation of the world and John looked
[1:29:55] in there and he seen that book come open
[1:29:57] and John got a part of the bride's
[1:30:01] Revival Glory Prophet says you know John
[1:30:03] must have saw his name wrote there when
[1:30:05] them seals broke he must have got real
[1:30:08] happy hallelu you know I feel there's a
[1:30:11] few people that they could they could
[1:30:13] stand to get a little bit of that you
[1:30:15] know get real
[1:30:17] happy you know they they they they seem
[1:30:20] to always be real sad and I'm just
[1:30:22] looking at that I'm like if you could
[1:30:24] see the word that I'm seeing if you
[1:30:26] could see the message I'm seeing you
[1:30:27] wouldn't be sitting there going oh well
[1:30:29] I don't know there doesn't seem to be no
[1:30:30] power there's no this there's no that if
[1:30:32] you could see what I'm seeing you'd get
[1:30:34] real happy all right and when John
[1:30:38] looked in there he he he'd seen says now
[1:30:40] I think he looked in there and he seen a
[1:30:42] past the curtain of time you see he
[1:30:44] broke through the time barrier and he
[1:30:46] could see into eternity he says he
[1:30:47] looked past the curtain of time and he
[1:30:49] says why there's
[1:30:51] John when you can catch a re ation of
[1:30:54] your Eternal predestination that you're
[1:30:56] a part of it and no you could no more be
[1:30:59] lost right now that like I back back
[1:31:02] actually when I first receiv received
[1:31:03] the Holy Spirit in my life I had I had
[1:31:06] quite a time of just a screaming and a
[1:31:08] hollering and a shouting and a dancing
[1:31:09] for quite a long time when I caught a
[1:31:11] revelation of justification amen I said
[1:31:15] I never did it in the first place my
[1:31:17] slate is cleared and when I you know
[1:31:20] maybe you didn't need forgiveness but I
[1:31:22] was a sinner and I had needed
[1:31:24] forgiveness and when I found out that my
[1:31:26] case was cleared I got such a joy in my
[1:31:29] heart I had such a Revival in me and I
[1:31:32] was dancing and I was praising God there
[1:31:34] at the building there and I actually
[1:31:36] caught a a vision I would assume it is I
[1:31:39] don't really know much about him since I
[1:31:40] hadn't haven't really had any but I seen
[1:31:43] myself in this place of beautiful
[1:31:45] Greenery and the mountains and the
[1:31:47] streams rolling by just beautiful and I
[1:31:49] was dancing up and down the hills of
[1:31:51] that place and I believe with all my
[1:31:53] heart that caught a picture of myself
[1:31:56] beyond the curtain of time rejoicing and
[1:31:58] shouting that I was justified and that
[1:32:01] the blood had cleansed me and I believe
[1:32:03] with all my heart I was standing there
[1:32:04] and I was shouting I said just as
[1:32:06] certain as I'm shouting and dancing here
[1:32:07] I'm going to shout and dance over there
[1:32:09] because his blood has cleared my
[1:32:12] case thank you Jesus when it becomes
[1:32:15] personal to you not just reading that
[1:32:17] you know Jesus died to save Sinners but
[1:32:20] when the quickening power comes and he
[1:32:23] quickens he takes that off the page and
[1:32:25] it becomes alive and you said that was
[1:32:27] for me personally and when he forgave
[1:32:30] them he forgave me it does something to
[1:32:32] you a whole lot different than head
[1:32:37] knowledge I better Hallelujah better
[1:32:40] move along
[1:32:43] here oh he says now that Holy Spirit is
[1:32:46] here on Earth looking out those
[1:32:49] individuals that God has ordained to
[1:32:51] life in this age and as soon as he finds
[1:32:55] it he does just like he did on Jesus
[1:32:57] Christ the great superon of God who
[1:32:59] redeemed us all it comes down and it
[1:33:01] takes its place and Abode in the human
[1:33:04] life now notice brought the quickening
[1:33:06] power now what quickening now that
[1:33:09] quickening power That Came Upon Jesus
[1:33:12] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:33:15] of the word of that day so does the holy
[1:33:18] spirit that come upon us in this
[1:33:21] day amen how could Jesus manifest all of
[1:33:25] the promises in the word for that hour
[1:33:27] quickening power how are you going to
[1:33:29] manifest a Rapture how are you going to
[1:33:31] manifest the promise how are you going
[1:33:33] to manifest healing how are you going to
[1:33:35] manifest that your family shall be saved
[1:33:37] how are you going to manifest peace that
[1:33:38] passes understand how are you going to
[1:33:41] quickening power when that quickening
[1:33:43] power comes on you and you recognize by
[1:33:46] Revelation that it's already finished
[1:33:48] that it's as established as the Throne
[1:33:50] of God well you can just forget all the
[1:33:53] worrying can forget all the unbelief and
[1:33:55] you can just sit there in faith he says
[1:33:58] down here he says in the Easter seal
[1:34:00] it's the Holy Spirit talk he was talking
[1:34:02] about how the move of God and how the
[1:34:04] spirit of God's been moving in these
[1:34:05] last days and he says it's the Holy
[1:34:08] Spirit coming down to Quicken and make
[1:34:11] alive those people that's foreordained
[1:34:13] of God to be in the Rapture that's that
[1:34:16] is if he's a true Eagle he will
[1:34:19] understand the message of the hour if
[1:34:21] he's a true Eagle so we don't don't have
[1:34:24] to water down this message we don't have
[1:34:25] to try and make it more palatable to
[1:34:27] chickens we just preach the message
[1:34:29] because Eagles enjoy Eagle food and this
[1:34:32] message didn't come down to make
[1:34:33] denominational people feel comfortable
[1:34:35] this message came down to prepare a
[1:34:37] bride for a
[1:34:39] Rapture and when they hear that eagle
[1:34:41] scream if they're an eagle it does
[1:34:44] something inside of it thank you Jesus
[1:34:46] so where is the brides's
[1:34:48] Revival people are wondering like well
[1:34:50] when's it going to happen you know
[1:34:51] when's there going to be when are we
[1:34:52] going to empty the hospital out and when
[1:34:54] are we going to go and show the world
[1:34:55] how great we
[1:34:58] are brother Ram talks about this
[1:35:01] magazine where they'd print fast and
[1:35:02] pray fast and pray he says we're maybe
[1:35:05] God will do a great work maybe he'll be
[1:35:07] a great opening of the day and he says
[1:35:09] uh they print this fast pray we're going
[1:35:11] to have a great breaking of the day fast
[1:35:13] and pray pray pray pray we're not too
[1:35:15] late yet he says why do they do that why
[1:35:19] do they do that they want a Great
[1:35:21] Awakening now an Awakening is real Bible
[1:35:24] he says they're crying believing that
[1:35:26] there will be an Awakening they're good
[1:35:29] people why is it what have they done
[1:35:32] they missed they have not recognized The
[1:35:35] Awakening of the Bride but being a
[1:35:38] Christian they feel the pole of the hour
[1:35:41] but they haven't recognized what's been
[1:35:43] done right there you go they're looking
[1:35:45] looking way off oh someday God's going
[1:35:47] to have a Great Awakening and there's
[1:35:49] the prophet of God the messenger in
[1:35:51] their midst and the bride is coming the
[1:35:53] life a bride was coming forth and he
[1:35:55] says I don't just call you a church
[1:35:57] anymore I call you bride a bride in its
[1:35:59] infancy coming forth and all of these
[1:36:01] things happening the greatest things
[1:36:03] that could happen in the Christian
[1:36:04] church since Jesus Christ was here and
[1:36:06] they're saying pray pray pray
[1:36:10] someday they're looking off and not
[1:36:12] recognizing what was happening right
[1:36:16] then oh if you can recognize what's
[1:36:19] happened in your day there is so much
[1:36:22] available to you there was a man one
[1:36:24] time and and you know he was supposed to
[1:36:26] die supposed to be killed the next day
[1:36:29] his friend went and he got a
[1:36:32] pardon and he grabbed it he came back he
[1:36:36] said listen you know I know you're
[1:36:38] guilty I know you're a bad boy but
[1:36:41] listen there is a way that's been made
[1:36:43] you can be set free and he says I've got
[1:36:46] your pardon and and and he looked at it
[1:36:48] and he said don't make fun of me he said
[1:36:52] listen if I was going to get a pardoned
[1:36:55] it'd have nice fancy paperwork and it
[1:36:57] would
[1:36:59] have help Jesus but you know what if he'
[1:37:04] looked at the
[1:37:05] Vindication if he looked at the
[1:37:07] signature he would have recognize this
[1:37:10] document of my pardon has been signed by
[1:37:13] the greatest Authority in the land he
[1:37:15] wouldn't have been sitting there going

[1:37:31] portion of your pardon here he says you
[1:37:34] are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of
[1:37:37] the son of the Living God every man and
[1:37:39] woman that's born of the spirit of God
[1:37:40] and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:43] and believes every word of God stands as
[1:37:45] though you never sinned at the first
[1:37:47] place you are perfect he say oh well not
[1:37:52] me not my I don't know about that you
[1:37:53] know he was just a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:37:55] forget all the paper forget the torn
[1:37:57] piece of paper it's on look at the
[1:38:00] signature recognize the Vindication you
[1:38:02] say oh I'm looking for a Revival over

[1:38:06] no quit looking for it someday it's
[1:38:08] right here it's in your midst right now
[1:38:10] and yet it's the unrecognized presence
[1:38:12] of Jesus Christ because you're looking
[1:38:14] for him to show up over there you're
[1:38:15] looking for be over here friends he did
[1:38:18] not say that he's going to be over there

[1:38:21] in your midst he says I will not leave
[1:38:23] you nor forsake you the never-failing
[1:38:25] presence of Jesus Christ is with this
[1:38:28] bride amen and yet it's so humble it's
[1:38:31] so simple you say me this church this
[1:38:35] place yeah yeah forget about all of that
[1:38:38] you just get yourself alone with that
[1:38:40] quickening power of God and you say God
[1:38:43] is this really for me Lord reveal it to
[1:38:46] my heart let that quickening power
[1:38:48] strike me I want a revelation of your
[1:38:51] word I don't just want mechanics friends
[1:38:52] we got the mechanics I mean I I haven't
[1:38:55] been here very long but you know you
[1:38:56] respond to the word I recognize that
[1:38:58] you've heard the word and that's good
[1:39:00] that's wonderful but what you need is
[1:39:02] the dynamic power of God to come down
[1:39:04] and to strike that Quicken it and make
[1:39:06] it a reality put it into action in your
[1:39:09] life you don't need more theology more
[1:39:12] more thoughts more ideas you know that's
[1:39:14] good I'm a preacher I preach it all the
[1:39:16] time but what you have need of in your
[1:39:18] life is Jesus Christ which is the
[1:39:21] quickening power to come and strike you
[1:39:23] and then you can stand there like those
[1:39:25] those great theologians that came from
[1:39:27] America to Ireland and and to Wales and
[1:39:29] they said you know we're here because
[1:39:30] we're looking for the great
[1:39:32] Revival we heard about this Welsh
[1:39:34] Revival it's supposed to be the greatest
[1:39:36] Revival on the earth and we want to come
[1:39:38] see it and they came up to the to the
[1:39:40] police officer there and and they said
[1:39:42] sir we'd like to know where the Welsh
[1:39:45] Revival is at can you direct us oh yeah
[1:39:48] I can tell you where it's at I know
[1:39:50] right where he at he says you have
[1:39:52] arrived I am am the Welsh Revival he had
[1:39:55] that Revival in him and so you say where
[1:39:57] is the bride's Revival where is this
[1:39:59] great move of God what's going on if you
[1:40:01] can get the quickening power of God to
[1:40:03] come and strike this message that's in
[1:40:05] your heart you can stand there you can
[1:40:07] look him in the eye and you say you can
[1:40:09] look in Africa for the brides Revival
[1:40:11] you can look in India for the brides
[1:40:12] Revival but you don't have to go that
[1:40:14] far because I am the brid's reviv I am
[1:40:18] that word for this hour made flesh I am
[1:40:22] the word manifested in this day not by
[1:40:24] my strength not by my might but if the
[1:40:27] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:40:29] the dead dwell in you he shall Quicken
[1:40:31] your mortal bodies your mortal body will
[1:40:34] begin to manifest the message of this
[1:40:36] hour when that quickening power comes
[1:40:39] down into you let's stand to our feet

[1:40:55] where that Holy Spirit is anointing the
[1:40:57] word of God and when he when you hear
[1:40:59] the word of God you just say Lord I
[1:41:02] receive it Lord I believe it when you
[1:41:04] find that you'll find the bride's
[1:41:06] Revival when you find the people who
[1:41:08] will receive this message of the hour
[1:41:10] not just intellectually you know that's
[1:41:12] a great starting place place because
[1:41:13] that's the wound of the soul but when
[1:41:15] you receive this message not just as an
[1:41:17] idea not just as a theory but when it
[1:41:20] becomes a revelation in your heart amen

[1:41:49] message that you have need of in your
[1:41:51] life yes amen is there promises in here
[1:41:55] in the word of God that you say you know
[1:41:57] I'd like to see that

[1:42:10] ascend down into hell the word of God is
[1:42:14] NY it's in your mouth it's the word we

[1:42:25] take it off the paper take it out of the
[1:42:27] intellect and set it a fire in your
[1:42:30] heart where that promise that God spoke

[1:42:58] Sunday I believe
[1:43:03] it let's just bow our heads this
[1:43:09] morning Lord
[1:43:12] Jesus Lord I'm so thankful that I don't
[1:43:15] have to preach a God that's a dead Idol
[1:43:18] somewhere I've seen those idols on the
[1:43:21] the temples of India and they're just
[1:43:23] dead stone but God I have the
[1:43:25] opportunity to preach the Gospel of
[1:43:28] Jesus Christ that you didn't lay there
[1:43:30] dead in a grave but the quickening power
[1:43:32] came and raised you from the dead and
[1:43:34] that same power is here this morning you
[1:43:36] said so by a promise you've never lied
[1:43:40] you cannot lie and so Lord we believe it
[1:43:43] and we have confidence that your
[1:43:45] presence is here Lord not just because
[1:43:47] we feel you although we do but Lord
[1:43:49] because your word promised that you
[1:43:51] would be where two or three would gather
[1:43:52] together
[1:43:53] and so Lord there's needs here in this
[1:43:55] building I don't know the needs I don't
[1:43:57] hardly know any of the names Lord but
[1:43:59] you know the heart and father I'm asking
[1:44:01] this morning that as they come before
[1:44:03] you and they have a need in their life
[1:44:05] Lord and they know there's a promise of
[1:44:06] God they know there's a word you've
[1:44:08] given for them I ask that the quickening
[1:44:10] power of God would come to that
[1:44:12] individual and that word would become
[1:44:14] revealed in their heart and that promise
[1:44:16] wouldn't just be for some other day but
[1:44:18] they say God I'm accepting your promise
[1:44:21] right now for this hour for I need Lord
[1:44:24] I'm asking that your spirit would have
[1:44:26] Liberty to Quicken the word in our
[1:44:29] hearts Lord may we recognize the
[1:44:32] Vindication Lord may we just drop the
[1:44:34] doubts may we drop all of the fears and
[1:44:36] the nervousness and the worry Lord and
[1:44:38] just believe your word because we know
[1:44:42] it's the king's
[1:44:43] message Father I ask that you would
[1:44:46] vindicate to the individual Lord the
[1:44:49] power of this quickening holy spirit of
[1:44:52] God yes Lord
[1:44:53] may you grant it Lord Lord may they not
[1:44:56] just know you by books Lord but Lord if
[1:45:00] they're illiterate Lord in in their
[1:45:02] knowledge may they at least know you as
[1:45:04] the Living God
[1:45:06] father may you grant it
