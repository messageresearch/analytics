Wednesday night and you know I want to tell you something noise don't scare God and worship don't scare God and prayer and worship don't scare God and it surely don't scare me and I just I just laying down a record here if somebody's getting blessed in the service amen that's Jehovah just stand back and watch Jehovah that's Jehovah in flesh and it's the greatest experience you'll ever see or be involved in in this life maybe even in heaven it's so you know brother B said the whole key is that you'd get out of the way and let him work in your life so if God's coming down and he's doing something in your life you don't have to be afraid of your neighbor if your neighbor's in the way just move or knock him over and you certainly don't got to be afraid of this place hallelujah praise name our service Wednesday was just amazing and just the worship just went and prayer just went and went and went and went it was amazing amen we want to continue on the part two of Christ The Mystery of God revealed and we're going to break this down into Christ revealed in us and brother Braham said things like this we're going to turn to Colossians 1 and 15 brother Braham said this that the whole purpose a 100% of the purpose now that's quite a bit of the Bible was to type God's plan and it was for god Jehovah to manifest into Christ and Christ to manest into US amen and Christ is here today the exact same Christ is here I have brother bam said that the exact same material that was in Christ Jesus Christ amen is in you the exact same you know all that was in God he poured into Jesus Christ and all that was in Jesus Christ he poured into his wife the church and watch this you know Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily and watch this and we are too amen amen amen you know brother Carson maybe has a part and Junior has a part and brother Chad has a part and brother M and everyone some are the fatherly part of Christ some are the motherly part of Christ do you know Christ had a feminine Spirit praise God we don't talk about that much oh yeah Hallelujah some of us are the Healer of Christ some of us are the forgiver of Christ the Longs sufferer the patience of Christ God knows the it's not in the L side blood patience it's got to be in one of you guys' patience amen the fullness of the godhead bodily is represented here this morning and his wife Hallelujah and it's amazing you know you know I mentioned I just I want to finish a quote that I just touched on last Sunday you know the world loved the humility of Christ when he was Healing The Sick and and doing these different things and washing the disciples feet but they didn't like the Christ when he braided a rope and beat them out of the temple that's right amen that was the same Christ yeah amen first cor Colossians 1 and we're going to read 15 to 19 and then read 26 um just a few announcements sorry uh before we really got ahead of myself brother John Garrett and his family will be here next Sunday uh ministering for us and then November I believe it's November 3rd but it's the first weekend of November that's normally our anniversary meetings which somewhat kind of got changed to our camp meeting but uh romal and I'm not going to try to say his last name from the Philippines is going to be here I'm going to pick him up on Friday and he will be with us for a while a brother that we know well a friend of brother nesters if you know any ministers in the Philippines and uh it you can be really really blessed amen thank you Lord let's read his word who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him who all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth that are visible and that are invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers things all things were created by Him and for him everything this morning is about Jesus Christ right everything and he is before all things he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and by him were all things consist you get your breath from Jehovah and he is the head the boss of the body the church who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead and that in all things everything he might have the preeminence and verse 19 I love this part for it pleased that's right the father that in him should the fullness dwell and let's just drop to verse 26 and you can have your seats even the mystery that has been hidden has been that's past tense that's right from ages and from Generations but now today it's a different day but now has been made manifested to his Saints Lord Jesus we pray that you'll just take the veils off our eyes as we can see you more perfectly this morning and we'll praise and bless your name for it amen amen you may have your seats we're just going to scrolled past our our message here last Sunday and and try to find another sorry we're going to turn to Revelations 1:1 just read another scripture for Foundation there we go Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent it and he signified it by his Angel unto a servant John hallelujah amen we see here in the scripture and we're just laying a foundation with scriptures in here in John 1:1 you can turn over there if you want in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him you see how the scriptures are com are complimenting each other all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not see we had a prayer request here you know the darkness can't comprehend Christ Jesus but in many that received him to them he gave power to become the sons even to them that believe on his name now I want to just stop there for just a second and I had a question asked very respectfully and asked me a while ago as about adoption and I I mentioned that maybe last week or last Sunday you know brother Brown mentioned adoption about 183 times and adopted 189 times and it's everywhere in the Bible and it's right here that as many as would receive him gave he power to be adopted power to become sons and verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and it dwelt among us you know brother Brown talked about the gifts of the spirits and he said I can show you in the word of God where God brought them into the church that's right but you try to show me where he took them out I want to show you where he took out Christ and the word became flesh that's right and dwell Among Us he never took that out it's walking around in his bride this morning in a me many membered bride Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you know every principle and theme of the Bible is about Christ and everything that you your theme and all your thoughts and everything the principle should be about Christ everything that you dwell on you know the Bible says that when you rise up in the morning you pray to him when you walk around in your day it's your whole theme as you're making a living and and whatever you're doing you're you're calling in life and then as you lay down in bed and you're showing your children in your thing is your theme is Christ Christ was identified in us and he was identifying himself that we would be Christlike the word we would be the second Eve that wouldn't fall wouldn't fall from this here and I'm just trying to skip what I went through here and you know God is looking for people that he can have the preeminence amen and he says this word hundreds of times or dozens at least in this message Christ revealed in God and he's looking for people that God can consume that will take a name change and be Mrs Jesus Christ and nothing and we give examples of of Paul and Moses not nothing that the world could offer them would change their opinion it was completely sold out completely taken Christ seed it don't matter what happens you know I just want to throw this in here just in case anybody hasn't been watching but brother bam said to watch Israel I would just encourage you to keep watching Israel and you might well I almost said something mean we're going home soon am amen we're just going home soon I watch a short thing you know Israel got 180 missiles shot to him at one afternoon and Israel's one afternoon and they were talking about the the leader there in Israel that Biden keeps putting up a red line for him not to cross and he repeatedly crossed the red line with no circumstances and they know Israel is going to retaliate to Iran and they expect that he's going to hit the nuclear facilities I think they have about five of them that that are noted or whatever and Biden said you can do anything you want to Iran but don't hit them we're not going to be here for that nuclear war amen hallelujah we need to God wanted to express himself in Christ and secondly he wanted to express himself Christ wanted to express himself in his bride and have the preeminence that we are completely not our own completely sold out and then thirdly he wanted to come back and live in the Garden of Eden Je the second Adam Jesus Christ and his wife the second Eve and it'll be Heavenly it'll be the honeymoon and it'll be amazing I want to look into this morning and and you know I I mentioned this last week brother bam when he preached this was a 4-Hour message and I added a lot of parts to it you know brother bam I read a quote he said that we have thus saith the Lord we are we are Christ voiced in this day the bride know know exactly exactly the mind of Christ and exactly what he wants done with it and when amen that's how you know healing and and the spiritual gifts in the body is just like you getting blessed that's right you can't get blessed until God sends it to you and you can't speak thus sayith the Lord until he sends it to you amen amen hallelujah let's just look at some things here some people that were completely sold out and God had the complete preeminence and their life and one example was Daniel here they had been overrun by the king of Babylon and he have seized Jerusalem and he the king there Nebuchadnezzar ordered his his men to take the chosen ones of Israel's people back to glorify himself and and his God baam sir and you know this is an amazing thing that just jumped off the pages to me you know brother Bown said repeatedly that God's looking for somebody that'll have the preeminence if he's number one in everything you do he's the whole Focus you can't make a move or a business thing or anything without considering Christ's opinion Daniel here he wanted to give these people his food that was offered to idols and his wine and the Bible says in Daniel 8 1: 18 it said you know watch God wants a preeminence and and I want I just clarify something here is the Holy Ghost had it been given yet in Daniel's day so you have a piece of cake you have it thousands of times easier than Daniel had it and it says the scripture says that Daniel purposed in his heart d 1 Daniel 8 he said Daniel purpose in his heart to give God the preeminence in his life now I want to just clarify a few things here Daniel was a slave of War bless God and some of us spineless Christians will say oh well the government says it's legal it doesn't matter what the government says is legal if the Bible don't say it's legal amen we need to stand up for what's God's word first and respect and obey the government as long as it don't get in way of God Amen Hallelujah and here Daniel's a Slave they could have locked his head off and not lost a minute's notice and he purpose in his heart oh he could have went to God said well God you know I just had to do that it was sat in front of me I would have starved to death some of us are so cheap we'll take something given to us you know you know the Kings and the holy men in the Bible they want to take money from the devil don't be cheat don't sell your soul Elvis sold his soul for cheap money that's going to burn cheap money and a fleet of Cadillacs Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defy himself the person of the king's meat nothing wrong with meat I'm a meat eater all the time but this was the king's meat and the King's Wine which in our life is type the power of the Holy Ghost but this was a false god sure which he would drink and therefore he requested of the Unix that he would not defile can you imagine him walking up to the can you just just comprehend that imagine that you're like in you know North Korea and you walk up there and say you know I I'm really I'm here but you know I know I'm in your slave prison camp but you know I don't want to eat your food I I I profess like that I you know we think Daniel's a great thing but there ain't one of us sitting here this morning that would have did what Daniel did but Christ is looking for somebody that he can have the preeminence that their whole being is sold out to him that he can come in and and be as that as wife understand everything that he wants and everything that he is and he's just yo man can you comprehend this now watch this brother baham said in this message that all these stories are tight in the Bible the whole Bible is wrote so it's hid from the wise and prudent and revealed onto babe such as would learn and that was God's plan was to find a wife and have the preeminence that's right for himself I'd say Daniel was a man of God and we can look down at Daniel again and along with him Daniel had some buddies and their Pagan name was given to them by the king and it was Shadrach meach and abedo and they were also slaves now watch this God's looking for somebody that's got a backbone that's got the preeminence see you know we said last Sunday when you've taken Christ seed he closes a box car and you can't get pregnant with the devil's seed anymore you're completely sold out I'm going to read I'm going to read some quotes here where he says that he's telling you the secrets and he's making love to and he says right on the quotes to his wife yeah and here Nebuchadnezzar made a n on I just love this one now you know please forgive me we talked on this Wednesday night if you missed it you just missed the big thing but if you want to make sense completely of this message go watch last Sunday and I'll and you know it will help you but Nebuchadnezzar the king that was Pagan respected Daniel so much you why he respected Daniel because he was a good honest worker he was what you see is what you get he wasn't a sneak see Daniel was working and laboring and living as unto God and the King saw that attribute in him you know Believers should be the best employees the best honest businessmen the best everything in the world don't real it don't make no difference if your boss is a complete Airhead yeah you're working as unto Christ and even this Pagan King seen the attributes of Daniel so much so that he sent Daniel away to take care of his other property that was far away land now our Prophet said this I'm not making this up you can search all this and brother Brown said it multiple times in different messages he built a statue of Daniel to worship Daniel to respect the attributes that were in him now watch this the brother bam says things like this he said look look at the style of Satan he built this Idol when Daniel was away he had gone home right between the lines now he had died and went home Daniel would have never allowed the worship of himself that's right but he wasn't there to defend it and here the Believers were and the king so loved Daniel he said I'm going to I'm going to blow all the he had great musicians like us and he said I'm going to blow all these instruments and you are going to fall down and worship them now watch this they had other people in the church that were present and there was only three people that had a backbone and that congregation and all the other people were jealous of those people and they went to the king and they said King Nebuchadnezzar when you blew the trumpet and you sounded all the music they fall down and worship this amazing INF that you've created unto yourself and for people to be under your headship and obey the laws of the land bless God there was three people that wouldn't obey and he brought it to their attention and he brought Shadrach Bach in the B to go up and I'm just telling you from memory and you can look this all up in Daniel 3 and he said is this the truth that thou have done you have actually defied now they're slaves he could have loed their head off he could have thrw a spirit through their gut they were Canon f as far as he was concerned they were they were prizes of War bless God we can take some examples from them people amen and they never had the B they never had the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet and I want to just read this just makes me lose my mind how they answered in verse 16 maybe we can pull this up girls Daniel 3:16 and Shadrach and meach and abedo answered the king answered unto the king said oh King Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful how we come to church on Wednesday night we are not careful how we obey the word of God we are not careful how we're sld out we are not careful how he has a preeminence in our life we are not careful how we lose oursel in worship and we don't even know what's happened until somebody would come to us after and tell us in the service you know our Prophet said that he said I don't even know what I preached or sold go go back and listen to the tape that's right he said we are not even careful oh we answered you in this matter no I me just tell you what that's what you call walking on thin ice cuz he what had Legions of military men around him verse 17 he said if it be so our God is it's a piece of cake for him he's more than able to Deliver Us from your fanatical fiery furnace and he will deliver and he would deliver us out of your hand he would it would be poof you know brother Bram said this he said you know this this this act on Earth you know we under we understate God you know when we get adopted and we're placed and we understand the the the role head of wife we understand the authority that's given to us I said it last Sunday you know if I was going the way to the m i don't have to tell my wife to to to to do to pay the bills and gas up the car and buy something or sell something her I don't tell her to go to the grocery store and buy me what I love she already knows what I love when she goes to the grocery store she brings cash shoes back with her she brings bags of cashews back with her cuz I'm possessed with cash shoes cuz she understands my mind and my will and my thoughts and she don't have to ask permission how there honey can I get some money from you to it's not my money it's her money you know we call God oh God can I get some meal from you please will you send it down to me and he's oh you just don't understand you're looking at me like some kind of a religion he said he can deliver us out of thy hand brother B said that even the angels recognize this in heaven he said God have you been watching Facebook lately down on Earth do you do you see those three men down there they're radicals they're acting under control but they said if not if God decides not if it not be that he know on be known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor will we worship oh here I missed the verse here I must if it be so that our God whom we serve is able to deliver so with fire friend but if not it be known unto thee King if he doesn't if God decides not to heal me it makes no difference if God decides to feed me Branch water and and tea it makes no difference if I got to ride a horse instead of a car cuz I'm sold I'm I'm completely stol own sold yeah he said we will not serve your Gods neither will we worship the golden image which was the Prophet Daniel yes that thou has set up wow and so here the fury of the King was the the the the lack of respect and reverence that they these these these mice had showed in front of King Nebuchadnezzar he he he was out of control he said make the fire seven times seven Church ages hotter do you know in this age that the pressure on you is seven times hotter yes than the first ages seven times because the devil knows that his time's almost up you might not have to watch Israel but I guarantee you one person that is and that's Satan's watching Israel and he knows that the days are almost through and he and he's going crazy to get this wife this second Eve to fall that's right come on now but what he don't know there's something Satan don't know is that it the second Eve cannot fall it's not possible because she's packing Christ she was predestinated before the foundation of the world God left nothing to chance even if you fall down you can't get repr pregnant again you're completely consumed with you can look at the men that that Christ denied Christ and he still used them that's right amen he made it seven times harder and then the Pagan King God came on the scenes they threw a in and the men died you know the story better than me and here a pagan King that had never prayed to Jehovah had never heard a message about Jehovah had never stood in front of Jehovah going to car going to curse Jehovah in his face said I threw in three yes complete Pagan you know there's Believers sitting in churches that don't even recognize that I threw in three people in that church and I recognize another presence in their atmosphere I recognize another presence in the church body it's the atmosphere of Jehovah Christ made flesh and dwell among us hallelujah hallelujah and it looks on to me like the Son of God you know I said it and I've said it before when I shared testimonies with you you know Satan will recognize the testimonies and the power of God in your life when God does stuff outside of the physical Norm Satan will pick it up oh yeah and saying that don't have happen in this realm the preeminence do you know we're so dignified and we're so religious that we miss the plan of God do you know the Bible says in 1 Peter 3:6 then even Sarah called Abraham Lord she recognized the presence of a living Christ that's right in his life there's my Lord amen that's been made flesh in my day and God's gave enough Grace and love to me that I'd have the the the chance fellowship with Christ with Christ made flesh I'll tell you what if you don't want to be in each other's presence you certainly won't want to be in heaven that's for sure cuz it will be exactly the same if you're disappointed in church life today and it's under the power of God and you have a and and it's under the leadership of Christ let's say that way if you're if you're disappointed with Church Life today and it's under the leadership of Christ you you're going to be sadly disappointed in heaven you do not want to go to that place because Christ will be no different there than he is where he has the preeminence watch me the preeminence in the lives of people in this age ain't that amazing God help us I want to use a scripture now now brother B said I I just I'm just I I don't want you to think I'm going down a long road here that all the Bibles wrote based on this love affair am I am I okay with that so far and it was God was was uh before he was even God he was this Spirit you know and and he became created the angels and he had all these attributes in them God wanted toay that into Christ and he wanted to portrayed in his wife and go back to the Garden of Eden which was Perfection there'll be no war in the Millennium there'll be no hatred in the Millennium it'll be straight honeymoon like paradise like you're more than your imagination and so I wanted with your permission to show you an example and just forget about the people representing you know I said last Sund it's not about the ministry it's not about the fivefold Ministry it's not just about you no more than it's about the children we're a b we're all equally Christ I don't have no more of Christ than you have not one back don't look to me look to yourself Christ Jesus prayed to the Father which was in himself pray to yourself it's not a far away God it's it's in me I'm walking with them I'm living with them and so God you know it's amazing that smart people can't figure out simple things you ever see that God put this so plain you know you know I I never went to a and and no we're not well I never heard tell or understood predestination till I came to this beautiful message and I can't do devotions without reading predestination I can't read a book or a verse of the Bible without seeing that I'm predestinated that I'm Sons and Daughters of Christ and he thought of me before the foundation of the world and we could just go into so many examples but I want to go into here here and then maybe we'll look in Ephesians if we get time and if we don't we might do another one or or do it Wednesday but here there was a story oh I hate that word story there was an example in the Bible of what God wanted to do yes amen and he's shown EX exactly that you understand 100% And Our Father Abraham oh God became an old man my kids don't understand that when you reach 55 things start happening to you you move a lot less and a lot slower that's right and this was your father Abraham just let me go here dramatize this this was Jehovah he was getting older and he wanted these attributes to be betray in him hello this is Genesis 24 and so he called up his servant which we know by scriptures was elizer like the ministry today or the prophets today and he said I want you to go and find a bride like he's looking for today that come out of her my people and be not partakers of her plagues and her sins and he said don't you dare go to the world and take one of those cheap Jezebel pieces of junk it'll be a be like driving an electric car or some piece of computerized thing the one little bug goes wrong the whole thing goes you know I was Driving My Tractor Down the other day and and and no it it it's not one of these new electric bugs you know but it must have been formed a little bit in the garden of sin and I'm cruising down the road and I got a lot of things on my mind it was cating fields and it started blasting and screaming and the caution of the caution stop top top engine oil bum I'm like holy smokes doctor's blowing up I pull it over I said I checked the AA before I started this I'm only a mile from home I start up and went a little bit further and the same thing again the C something and it said check the engine fuel filter the air filter I said wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I that filter ain't even that old and I blow it out at least twice a year and I buy a new one every year I called the anic I sent a message up to Jehovah to Father Abraham and he said H son you don't have to worry about that that's some cheap sensor some little 50 Cent sensor that's thrown a whole bunch oft you know all it's all satan is he don't have no teeth he's some cheap sensor in the computer system and he's throwing all these caution lights to you and you got the oil in your belly which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got water in you and you got a clean filter thinking clearly and Satan's going B up you got a crisis some cheap lie the devil Stone us and I just kept right on driving I said okay that's F you know I'm still driving it's never done it again yet I never believe lie Sor that you should stop serving God pull over to the side of the road and reconsider that's like Abraham told eler don't go to these cheap worldly people around us you know when I was in high school I was Radical and I was broke and I drove for hours across the world to find my rib and there was 12200 Jezebels in betro high school I could have took any one of them home with me if I would have flashed a little bit of Daddy's money but I knew what their character was so I went a long distance drive with no cell phones no computers the little three-speed carburetor car they had the flutter the gas B the gas station you have foot in The Brak and the foot on this gas pedal and if you had turned down to I know you kids don't understand all those things but if you ever drive a we've seen an old carburetor we've seen a car the other day and I said oh man my wife my kids could never drive that that sucker would puke they don't understand a carburetor amen and so here Al eer he said now what if what if this bride won't let the preeminence of God come in her life and he said if they won't sell out to me you're free of all your obligations you know brother Bram said that a minister just throws out the net whether you believe me or not makes very little to do with me it's just that I stay on the word I just show you the truth and it's all entirely up to you the N catches everything God is the judge God was the one that predestinated it wasn't brother Dale he predated me just like he predestinated you and so we know the story that El eer he took lots of gold from his wealthy Jehovah cuz he was Rich he was loaded god's loaded this morning you need something from God you don't have to go Begging On Your Knees he got all you need you just got to start recognizing your position start writing checks start writing checks you don't have to worry about the bank calling they'll never call when they raise check from Jehovah you know when Joshua had to cross the Jordan River which was at the prim of the bank on the floody season cuz God had to hold them up just to prove glory and that the water never stopped till they stepped in it till they wrote a check that's right and then just reared up oh wow amen amen wow and he went hey Jared I got a dry well and uh he went to the well that wasn't dry and he told God he prayed to God he said no God the the the girls would come out from the city and the damsels and and he said now God the one that's got a little bit of get up and go the one that's got I'm not you know you ever notice that ell eer never asked for the cute one no or the pretty one or the one that wore clone that would give me a headache or anything like that he said the one that'll come out and offer me Hospitality you know hospitality is a gift given from Christ right not everybody's got it some of you in here are like unbelievable hos bu itable some don't I'll just give you a small confession I got it my wife don't she follows my lead amen and she's converted now but you see what I mean these gifts are different people and he said the the damel that comes up and offers me a drink Hallelujah and will water my camels now I going to just tell you something I've watered cattle before and you have a garden thank you and I've seen cattle at one in a Time come off the grass and I would have a garden hose going the size of my thumb wide open down pressure 60 lbs pressure and they would outdrink the garden hose that would never come out I've seen that regular I could show that to you Junior we don't see it now because when I was little we were poor and we never had water drinkers so we had to stand there for days watering the cattle cuz my dad had tanks but my kids miss those not privileg they got water drinkers so they never see a Thirsty Camel but anybody that Waters camels that come across the desert hello the little bucket that she'd pull up under that well she would have needed to see a choir practor when she got done pulling up the water now I'm just being I mean we we love these these These are truths yes can you imagine how cold it was she wasn't in air she was working like a dog she would have smelt like a dog too but she had character and he said hey you don't hear all the user said he said do you got room watch this watch how he says this you know God wrote everything to hide it I I'm I'm breaking this down God I'm unveiling God for you he said elzer said he said you got room in your home your heart for me for my Lord he said you got room in your home does your daddy have room in your home for my camels and my gifts that I'm bringing let me ask you something do you got room in your heart for the gifts that Christ wants to give you you don't have to take them but do you have room in your home and you know the Bible says that as they were entering the room that the son the brother recognize the gifts that the damsel was packing on her bracelets and her necklaces and you know brother B said this and I I if I slow down enough to read the quote but I just tell you he said it was the mother and the brother that tried to stop her Rebecca from going and he said one represented now this is not this is not paraphrased here okay one's going to insult the church and one's going to insult the minister he said the mother represented the Catholic Church church that's not us and the other one the brother represented the ministers that don't want to give you the full word of what Christ is in you the hope of glory and that don't represent me that's the ministers that try to raise them up above the people and become a lord or a priesthood over that's cheap garbage they're your brother and your sister in a different calling amen that's all it is and you watch this so so we see here that they came and they represented and they realized and they wanted to to to to stop Rebecca and hold her up for 10 days and they wanted they wanted her to understand that she she couldn't hear from God till the end of Revival she couldn't get what God wanted her to get in the first service or she couldn't get what she wanted in her own home even or praying to herself he they were trying to build a a kingdom around Rebecca and eler said you're hindering God you're holding up God I pray to God that we're not holding up God I I pray to God that when somebody gets blessed so we don't hope them that they would shut up so we could go on with the service we're holding up God I pray to God that when somebody has a blessing in her life we just well I don't want to hear that cuz I want to get on with my life I pray to God that we never get to the point that we don't even have time to to to set aside time to to hear from God and Christ and the scriptures and all this that we're so busy building our kingdom that's going to burn probably in a few months literally and let's turn to Genesis 24 and 55 and the Brethren said let her stay a few days at least 10 and after that we'll let you we'll let you serve God after you've seated your Wild Oats and he said unto them hinder not seeing that the Lord has prospered my way and sent me away that I may go to my master and verse 57 and they said well we'll call the damsel and we'll inquire of her God's doing that right now to you guys he's calling you up since the foundation of the world and he's saying what do you say God is as big as what you confess confess believe with your heart confess with your mouth amen that he is living inside you that you're sold out that you're his wife and that and and they so they called the damsel and inquired of her at her mouth and they called Rebecca and said unto her wilt thou go with this crazy man and I want to just show you something how in the world could you say that you'll serve Christ when you never seen them how in the world could you serve Christ when you've seen a lot of impersonators and sheep and Wolf clothing how come you've seen a lot of people that are after popularity money give me all your money God will come down God could care less about your money he knows it's going to burn he made gold not paper amen how could you say you would serve this Christ and become his wife when you ain't never seen him how could you serve how could Rebecca serve Isaac when she didn't know if he was as ugly as a stump do you know I want to show you something I want to show you something God wants to show you something this morning elaser wasn't talking about Isaac W that was a good one he was talking about Abraham but she wasn't marrying Abraham he was talking about Abraham my father he's rich and Abraham he's got all these gold Abraham and Abraham and Abraham but will you come to his son Isaac Christ Jesus she wasn't telling him nothing about him and you know the famous scripture she said I will go I will go and so they changed their thing and fast forward everything and of course they prepared for the trip and you know I want to just dramatize it a bit Rebecca is going on an Earthly trip that all signifies what Christ is doing with you right now and the Earth I'm me to tell you something your Earthly trip is going to end very soon and you're going to travel across the desert called The Rapture and there's going to be somebody standing over there called Christ Jesus that you ain't never seen in the flesh with your own eyes and he's going to be walking out in the field but see on the whole journey going over with elaser is what we do every Sunday Rebecca was a blood relative to Isaac oh yeah that's how she could say I'll serve him unconditionally you know how you can serve Christ is because you are a blood relative you're Jehovah God you came from God and you'll go back to God you were there when he hung on the cross you were there when he spoke the worlds into existence he you were there can you imagine me standing there brother Chad when he said let there be angel I was right there I said yeah a lot of them yeah I was a part maybe I was his lip his upper lip or bottom lip I mean what part were you of Jehovah he said let there be the Earth and let's separate the water from the land we were right there in them I was maybe the finger point yeah move over W amen I was right there I was a part of him I was his blood relative I walked like him amen Jehovah God here goes Abraham and God had blessed him with all the riches you know God owns the CLE on a thousand hills that's right come on he know where he place all the gold and silver and precious diamonds I just put them right there I'll put I'll put a knot right there on the board you can you see that knot right there can anybody in the church see I can it's right there you just believe me youever believe me just like God it's right there that's where the diamonds are in you yeah and Rebecca can you imagine when she got on the Campell just a little tiny girl would just say she was 18 and naive and and whatever she was obviously was a hard worker and she she didn't La strength and she's going to see somebody let me just backed up cuz some of us didn't live in this St they never had no next flick they never had no Facebook they never had no YouTube videos they never called on the phone they never had like what are they the video calling you know she never T again they never even had mail when it cost 25 cents to mail a letter I don't know if anybody remembers that maybe even less nothing and she's getting on a camell she to go see somebody that she had never seen oh my God and the Very blessing you know that she had watered the camels gave them the strength to take her back to her Lord her Lord and now Sarah called Abraham Lord is that all right is that all right I'm not you going out on the limb here Abraham and how could she recognize Isaac in the field let me let me just tell you something Abraham had thousands of sheep they never had electric fences back then he had thousands of cattle and thousands of camels and I'm going to venture out on Liam that he had thousands of servants or employees so normally the employees are out in the field yes hello you're you're you're really working me hard this morning anybody can help me preach that's right oh yeah and it was because of eler saying that's your lord right there this is what he looks like he acts like this he never wants to put on a big show he's always really humble but he won't get pushed around he's not a show off he'll only heal whatever the father tells him to do that's what he's he's like he you know when he goes he won't heal the whole Cemetery but if the father tells him to he would but he'll only say Lazarus come forth if he didn't use Lazarus name that would have been the general Resurrection but you know when he goes to the pool said he just heal the one person they going to get in cuz that's what the father showed him and he's just falling he said this this is what your lord looks like this is what Isaac looks like you know he's kind of like this but he really likes cashews but but he's really humble and he and he he won't be wearing flashy clothes cuz he'll be in the field come on and they're cruising along on the camels right and Rebecca takes the veil yeah in submission to her Lord that's right hello to her Lord and head Isaac that's right and God wrote that just to tell you that's me and you amen that's the end of the story amen and you thought well that was about Isaac and Rebecca no no it was about you and Christ it was about you and Christ do you know and I I'm just going to move on I'm going to read some quotes here and I know brother brah gave us a scripture here and if I oh here maybe we'll read our last scripture here Ephesians 1 1 to5 and and brother Bram mentioned some things here hallelujah brother Bram said here in this message says everything the exact same material that was in Christ Jesus is in you the Father the hospitality the Healer the forgiver the Savior the everything longsuffering Channel patience meekness everything is in you if you're a part of them you know brother Brown T the story repeatedly uh about the parents that would have a son and though he was born a son watch this is so powerful though he was born a son through predestination he was not considered no more than a servant until he got redeemed back and Justified as if he never did it by a tutor called the baptism of the Holy Ghost and adoption is adoption important you better believe it's important it's everything you are Hallelujah Ephesians 1 here and the prophet read this in this message and I I want to just show you this here an apostle Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God not by the will of Man by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful and and and he brings us out strong in in Christ not just hanging around him we're not just like religious and we go to the same stall but in Christ in first Colossians don't change the scripture but first or 1 Corinthians sorry 12:13 it says we are all by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body you know the body that you're baptized into by one Spirit God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and the one body is Jehovah Christ amen hallelujah amen in verse two in Ephesians 1 and to Grace be to you and peace from our F God and father and for the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed you yes with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places now I say just give me a minute I want to tell you what brother Brown said how do you get into Heavenly places with spiritual blessings would anybody like to hear what the prophet said to get into Heavenly places and the spiritual blessing is to be a believer position in Christ Hallelujah to be adopted in Christ to be positioned in Christ see where the believer stands in Christ is Heavenly places it's what the prophet's talking about the scripture that's where we want to be that's where we want to be every place this is about this ain't about an organization or a church it's about you and Christ work go your own salvation with fear and trembling I'm just pointing you to Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah verse four according that he has chosen Us in him you got that up there he's chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame in love nobody's judging the bride nobody's judging anybody's wife here hallelujah having pre destinated us onto the adoption do we believe in adoption oh yes do we believe it's important am to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure here let me read a scripture here he before Christ or before anything was on Earth he said you see the great mystery that he would choose a bride knowing Eve would fall and disobey the word knowing that she would would fall and he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to the word regardless that he would have the preeminence regardless of the rest of the world and what they had to say about it that they would hold to that word and they were predestinated to stand there and the adoption to children to Jesus Christ predestinated the wife to that great glorious stand Hallelujah amazing amazing it's just amazing what God has in store for us am if I can close I'm just going to read some some uh quotes here just a few quotes if that's all right and the mystery of Christ revealed he said everything is a revelation of Jesus Christ and the new birth Hallelujah he injects through the new birth he injects his own life into your life and your own life is gone cuz you're dad amen hallelujah watch this but God's great mystery what the Eternal God as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and then was given right down to his wife the church that once God's mind known the once once was in God's mind is known to the body of Christ making love to his wife and Whispering Secrets oh yeah to her amen that God Christ is doing in his church see he's letting you know the secrets just the secrets and there's no flirters he said I mean his wife is the one he's whispering to now I'm reading what the prophet said I'm not adding wife in there amen and when he came to Earth he was the tree of life he said you believe that and the Romans killed him and chopped down the tree and and and hung him in disgrace and and on the cross and he said now through the bride tree bring forth the bride life is restored back to him as husband and wife and the Garden of Eden glory to God in the same word that came the same God made manifested in the husband and the wife the same bride tree is come back see were the Christ that's made flesh and the word became flesh he didn't take the word away and he didn't take the flesh away he said it needs be that I would go that I could send the comforter back unto you the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right he he said notice this trees is Christ's body in the garden making now he's making the mystery known to his bride tree he said watch this watch Redeemed by Christ the second Jesus Adam you believe he was the second Adam going back home to Eden to with his Fallen wife he redeemed the Fallen us back he redeemed us back and that was Christ in the church taking his wife back the threefold mystery now watch this God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church and all together bringing back the original the original Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden Amen Hallelujah by the revelation of Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ he repeats that Christ is in you and then God did in Christ Christ does in you that's the sign that God's in Christ and it's a sign that Christ is in you Hallelujah this Revelation is made known and you will know it that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you amen hallelujah it's just amazing to me how people can miss this you know like we mentioned last Sunday and I'm I'm going to close on this thing is just like the disciples walking down the road to emus and Jesus says you fools he's going to say that a lot in the Judgment you fools I give you this whole book and showed you everything I was doing one two and three and you missed everything you fools and slow to learn all that the prophets for told of amen God have mercy on us amen Christ in you the hope of glory God wants a relationship in the second in the Garden of Eden with the second Adam and the second Eve it's beautiful you know this is not about building you know Christ said this he said if my kingdom was on Earth I'd fight for it what we believe it's not about this Earthly what we do on Earth amen it's about your heavenly lord it's about your heavenly lover literally amen God help us to recognize everything that he gave to Jesus Christ on Earth is represented in you today amen and if it's any less than that which it's not then God lied and it's not amen but we have to recognize that and we we went into that more last Sunday was that God Christ only did what the father showed him amen we're not you you shouldn't go out on a limb unless God CHS you and then you have thus sayith the Lord you know that God wants you to live for him he wants to have the preeminence in your life if he's if he's a hair pass first he's in dead last if he's a hair pass first in your life he's nothing at all God have a mercy amen help us not to be deceived God won't be mocked amen this is this is real you know he's not going to marry somebody that's half-hearted he's not going to marry somebody that's already married he's not going to marry somebody that's not sold out that he's got the preeminence look at the examples we give in the Bible the people regard you know the Bible says Don't Fear what they can do to your body but fear what they can do to your soul you know your greatest fear that you should have in this earth which you don't have to fear because you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're packing Christ in your being but if you have a fear at all it should be ministers in Wolf clothing that's right yes sir people that are lying to you and they look so amazing they even smile that's right so fear what what the Bible say don't fear what they can do to your body fear what they can do to your soul so amen let's stand amazing Amazing Grace predestination oh I love
