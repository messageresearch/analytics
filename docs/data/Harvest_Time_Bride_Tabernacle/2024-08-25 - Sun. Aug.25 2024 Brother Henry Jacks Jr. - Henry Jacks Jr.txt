going through a busy season you know busy season but the Lord made it possible made a way you know God is good and you just remember my boss in your prior you know he he's a God-fearing man you know and I really appreciate him you know that he could give me the time to be here praise the lord it's a blessing you know and I know that the Lord is going to reward him you know because I'm here because I love the Lord and I love his people you are his people you know and as a minister we have a responsibility it is our duty as a minister to bring the people up to the knowledge of the Son of God Amen you know we're here to sharpen each other we're here to gain strength from each other we're here to grow together did you know that God put us to grow together I can help grow you and you cannot grow me it doesn't work that way Hallelujah the Bible said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we that are alive and remain shall be caught up together so you're not leaving me and I can't leave you so we have to grow together Hallelujah praise the Lord so we are here to grow together praise God and that's a sign of Resurrection Hallelujah if you have your Bibles with me could you turn your Bibles to the book of St Luke we're going to read few verses here and then you can be seated the book of St Luke you know that Luke was not a disciple he was a scholar a writer Hallelujah and you know he he write what he see and what was said but here in Luke 27 St Luke 11: 27 youall find it St Luke 11 verse 27 I'm going to go slow here praise the Lord Lord and can I say this blessed you are blessed you are blessed am Hallelujah you are blessed praise God and I'm going to show you why you are blessed not because you have house or vehicle or materialistic that doesn't make you blessed Hallelujah that's not blessing you know a lot of persons misunderstand they believe that having a house having the most comfortable vehicle and so forth that made them blessed but that's not blessing hallelujah praise God glory to God here and also you're not blessed because you were born into a certain family or you have a certain big man as your father not because you have a not because you are the daughter of a Min a Pastor or the son of a pastor that makes you blessed [Laughter] no oh my and it came to pass as he spoke these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him in Jesus blessed is the womb that beared thee oh my God the woman said blessed is the the whom that bear thee but we know that in a wom you can have two different Spirit Cain came from a wom the same home that Abel came from Kan came from it two different spirit so so so would we say that he who Most Blessed produced two different Spirit look at it now and the pops which though are suck meaning the breast oh my but look at Jesus respond in verse 28 but he said yeah rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it your blessing lie in the word of God and keep it oh praise God you can be seated hallelujah praise God the topic this morning is blessed are they that hear the word and keep it you notice and and keep it so you can hear but that doesn't mean you're keeping it that's right sir oh praise God brother Paul said If any man be a hearer of the word he must also be a doer that's right Hallelujah sir praise God Amen did not can hear the word yes can hear the word but did he keep it no when you keep something it produce a result there is a result to it Hallelujah they were hearing the law the law was reading every Sabbath day they were hearing it but they weren't keeping it glory to God so here Jesus was explaining to the woman to the certain woman that was in the multitude that was in the crowd because according when she hear all of these things she said no man your mother is blessed your hurly mother is blessed that was she was speaking of Mary hallelujah oh praise God but Jesus was showing her hle is not it's not the womb that you come out of that makes you blessed it's not the breast that you s that makes you blessed Hallelujah you can have a bishop as your father you can have a pastor as your father or a teacher as your father but that doesn't make you bless glory to God I seen in this message many persons Hallelujah they would idolize somebody this big man this great man and they would want to be like this great man they would rather this great man to be their husband or the children rather them to be their father hallelujah oh my God am I preaching this morning Hallelujah they're missing the picture it's not about the man hallelujah it's about hearing the word but not just hear it but also to keep it Hallelujah because you can hear something but that doesn't mean you're keeping what you [Laughter] hear the word here it means to pay attention it means Hallelujah to understand oh my God that word understand is a big word Jesus Jesus said in the book of up Matthew 13:18 Hallelujah and the parable is like unto the man that heareth these Saints and understood it Hallelujah Glory so understanding is important understand is the ability to comprehend Hallelujah glory to God it means the word here it also means to obey hallelujah praise God so when you hear the word you obey it you respond in other words you respond according to what you hear if if I should say just to give a illustration if I should say then okay then hallelujah praise God Elliot come up here and sit on the chair hallelujah what just happened what just happened he responded to what I said Hallelujah glory to God he hear what I said and he responded am H that means he obeyed he was paying attention glory to God so when Jesus was saying to them you got to pay attention to the word and you must respond to the word and respond to the word you will get the result Hallelujah you will get the result glory to God you understand and the word bless it means receiving God's favor wow you heard that the word blessed it means receiving God favor Mary Hallelujah you can't go back Mary Hallelujah when the angel Gabriel that was sent from God he the angel came to oh God hallelujah Mary did not understood the visitation at the same time Hallelujah but she hear the word hallelujah and I can just can imagine a 00 years ago Hallelujah Isaiah prophesied that Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son Isaiah never precise who it was but he said a virgin shall conceive then when it was time for the prophecy to be fulfill God sent Gabriel hallelujah oh glory to to God go down to hurt Hallelujah I have a vessel down there and I want you to SW the word in that vessel heart Hallelujah so when Gabriel came and said Hallelujah blessed are th among woman you are highly favored she was wondering what manner of salutation is this that's right did she recognize that this man was an Angel yes she recognized it but in her Hallelujah probably she was saying but who am I just the small me for such a visitation glory to God who am I for such a visitation it's the same thing today we have received a visitation in this age today Hallelujah glory to God God himself came down in our hge and time and visit us hallelujah and say you are blessed Hallelujah you are blessed glory to God hallelujah and he has s the seed in our heart Hallelujah but the enemy glory to God but the enemy is there trying to take it away out of your heart God said though I put seed in the side it is your responsibility Hallelujah to keep it Jesus you think it is easy to come to Fellowship every Sunday you think it is easy it's a war [Laughter] am I preaching this morning you think it's easy to wake up every day of your life and walk out it's not easy it's a war sometimes when it comes on Sunday morning we feel so tired that we feel like that we can't make it Jesus my God hallelujah I tell you it's not easy but it is your responsibility to keep it you know let me just drop this testimony and then get back to the word hallelujah you know last night I was meditating and studying and I came under attack Hallelujah I came under attack believe me Saints I felt like I was dying it's a feeling I had glory to God hallelujah my wife was on the phone at the same time you know I couldn't even speak I could even speak the enemy came glory to God not because we're serving God we're going to have it easy hallelujah we're not we don't have it easy Saints glory to God because the enemy he knows how valuable you are to God he knows that you are an investment to God and God has invested in you so the enemy will is always come to attack you that's right yes sir you know what happened my wife have to call for a backup group call group call but before she before the group call came in I was praying on my knees I said not tonight not tonight I shall not die but to live and declare the works of the Lord all I know all I know I was determined I was so determined last night you can imagine God invested in Meed in me it is my responsibility to protect what God has invested Hallelujah it is your responsibility to protect what God has in invested in Jesus my God hallelujah you're talking about God's time you're talking about God's energy you're talking about his visitation all of that is in God's investment and we are God's investment upon the Earth don't you know that you shall judge the world don't you know how valuable you are don't you know that you are the one that is keeping this Earth today if you weren't here hallelujah it would be chaos oh my God it will be chaos did you know that Hallelujah now no Oh Glory to God if no one ever leave and go into the heart the flood would not touch the Earth Jesus you are valuable you are God investment upon on the earth God gave you each other God gave you your marriages your relationship Hallelujah and it is your responsibility to fight and to protect it Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the word bless it means fortunate it means happy feeling you are in a pos position of favor you are in a position of favor to God oh my God hallelujah praise the Lord this Bible Brother G this Bible that we have today this is not a religious book this is not a religious book Hallelujah you know what this is when you come to understand this a memor it is a love letter and in this in this you have the announcement of the Messiah in this you have the announcement of the wife of Christ in this your purpose is revealed to you God's Redemption is revealed God's plan is revealed for mankind and the plan for the Hur is revealed Hallelujah so this is not a Rel book but when we come to understand it Hallelujah and we approach it glory to God no wonder why the Bible said study study you know that it takes a lot effort to study I have to fight against destruction when I want to study my peers out there kicking kicking soccer they're riding the bikes what is that destructions you're trying to pull me away from studying Hallelujah my companions they're playing up and down but God said study he never said my father must study you must study Hallelujah he never said oh hallelujah oh it's the ministry alone to study you must study to show thyself approve unto God you know the purpose of studying to show yourself a prove unto God that you are an agent of God you are a mouthpiece of God because you have obtained knowledge Hallelujah you have obtained knowledge oh glory to God and the knowledge that you have obtained is of God so you know what God wants to do with certain situation when it arises you know what judgment to take when it arises amen hallelujah glory to God Jesus said to them in St John chapter 8 why do you not understand my speech Jesus you know they were hearing it but they wer in keeping the word they weren't paying attention Hallelujah Jesus said why you not understand you know what then Jesus said to them because you're not of God he that is of god Hearth God's word so it takes the seed of God to hear his word in other words you can't you can't take the word to suit your life you have to take your life to suit the word many people is trying to take their hallah the word of God and to soo their life doesn't work that way Hallelujah but only the Blessed only the Blessed knows all to approach God's word only the Blessed knows that they must walk in line with the word because they hear the command from the almighty God and they receive the visitation that God sent upon the Earth Jesus Hallelujah brother Paul said in Romans 10 Faith cometh by hearing the devil is attacking your faith said that to me two days ago the devil is attacking our faith Hallelujah he's attacking our faith it is our faith the devil is attacking your faith in your marriage your faith in your relationship with God the devil is attacking the Faith that's why brother Paul said contend for the faith that was once Del delivered unto the Saints yes sir in everything that we're doing we must have faith Jesus when we wake up in the morning we have faith Hallelujah when we leave our house even if we do not stop brother Jared and pray we have faith that God is able to bring us through we afraid that God will not let the devil Hallelujah struck us down we have faith Hallelujah that there will be no accident Hallelujah there will be no evil before us because we have faith in God's word hallelujah gone are the times when we used to if we don't pray it's like a sin praise God I don't know I used to feel that way brother Bernard I used to feel that way you know when I wake up and I and I didn't stop to pray I feel like I just commit a horrible sin Glory but you know what the word said to me Hallelujah if my words abide in you and you abide in me glory to God the said he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep we cannot keep ourself it is God that is keeping us God will not allow one one thing to touch you if he doesn't permit it the devil always lurking Hallelujah the devil always watching Hallelujah but you know what he can't touch you he can't touch you God has to permit him to touch you you know sometimes you know let me read read couple quote here hallelujah do you love him this morning hallelujah praise God I just have some quote here I want to get out of the way Hallelujah we serving a mighty God am in the message palor Locust and canor and caterpillar if you the prophet say if you amount if you amount to anything you stand for God you know what I know I am M Hallelujah yes sir so is it true I am out I will standun for God when sickness come I will stand when problem come I will stand Jesus Hallelujah you stand alone it is it is you it is not the world you notice he said it is you that are standing not the world because the world is not with [Laughter] you it is not your church it is not your denomination it between you and God and job had to prove that when his friend was supposed to give him encouragement job was left alone he was standing alone so sometimes the test come Hallelujah even the people around you that you're thought would stand with you you know what you got to stand yourself amen Job wife never stand with him Job wife said if Hallelujah why don't you curse God and die Jesus the test was not for his wife it is for you it is to prove you you have to stand alone Jesus glory to God and we're in the season where our faith is being tested test after test you come out one test last week brother Bernard and by tomorrow you enter into another test hallelujah hallelujah because we are on a journey we have to stand alone oh praise God in this message let's be a blessing in the message here him let's be a blessing to others that's why I came I hear brother brother Jim spoke it this morning it's not good it's a blessing Hallelujah yeah let's be a blessing to others right you are a blessing to me and I am a blessing to you Hallelujah glory to God let's be a blessing to others and try to do all we can for remember there's only one time that we are mortal one time you know when we leave this body we're not going to be mortal you know that we're not going to be immortal brother God when we leave this body we're going to be immortal because this Mortal shall put on immortality and this corruption shall put on incorruption so there's only one time we're going to be mortal glory to God hallelujah so you know what we're going to leave this body we're going to drop off this body glory to God hallelujah love one another anyhow talk nice about one another that's why we are here I'm talking nice to you you know what I'm talking nice to you you know what you're talking nice to me because you're responding to the word so you know what I am the word and you are the word so we're responding to each other you know that the Bible is a communication between God it's a communication God communicating to us hallelujah so there's a communication in the spirit you know that not everybody can can be a part of that communication not everybody because the to the coral it is carnal but to the spiritual it is spiritual so the spiritual are communicating in in a frequency that the natural cannot communicate in that frequency glory to God so when you tell me certain inspiration or Revelation I understand I follow you Hallelujah because you know what we're communicating in the spirit realm Hallelujah and then God will bless you oh man I love that's powerful then God will bless you what is that blessing body change what is that blessing a new ministry brother PR said and I saw a door open before me Hallelujah that was a new ministry John said on the eyes of pnas he said and after this and I look and behold hold a door was open in heaven what was that that was a blessing God was blessing John Hallelujah and the voice said John come up higher Hallelujah sometime God send a blessing it's for us to come up higher leave the things that are done on the earth Hallelujah leave your thoughts the Bible said let our imagination and our Hallelujah must cast it down glory to God cast down your imagination and your thoughts come up higher John and I will show you things that must and Hereafter Hallelujah then John began to move in the vision in Revelation 20 verse 6 John said blessed and holy hallelujah look at that word blessed and holy is he that had part in the first resurrection wow you know that the first resurrection you consider blessed you're considered holy but what is the first resurrection what did what did the prophet mean when he said what a resurrection that was and what the resurrection this [Laughter] is oh my do not look on the future events now Hallelujah he's talking about this Resurrection because all that are in Christ is a new creature all things have passed away and all things have become new when you receive the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the resurrection Hallelujah let's find it where brother Paul spoke about it in the Book of Romans chapter chapter 6 Romans 6 brother Paul said Hallelujah verse three know you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his debt there before we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father what is the glory of the Father the glory of the father is Christ it's the Holy Ghost can I say this you are blessed because you have the Holy Ghost in you you are blessed because you have the glory of the father in you Jesus Hallelujah do you understand what you're carrying you are carrying the glory of the father you are a glory carrier you are carrying eternal life you are carrying Mercy you're carrying Grace you're carrying the attribute of the father in you you are blessed Jesus Hallelujah even so we also should walk in newness of life not old life but newness Hallelujah all things have become new your vision is new your conversation is new your walking is new new everything has become New Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus verse 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection riches the Holy Ghost for by one Spirit we all baptized into one body Hallelujah it takes the Holy Spirit to put us into the body Hallelujah verse 8 look oh God now if we be dead with Christ look at that now see it he said we are dead [Laughter] Hallelujah if we be dead with Christ we believe that we also shall live with him verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead D no more that had no more dominion over him Jesus Hallelujah so when we receive the word we are living and active living and active and the Bible said keep it the word keep it means to preserve it it means to guard it it's your responsibility to guard it did you know that God always guard his word no man have to tell God to guard his word the sisters I love the song that you sing this morning Hallelujah being saved sa by the fort man what was that that was God guarding his word hallelujah that was God guarding his word you know that Hallelujah the word of God was down there in the fire Shadrach mesach and abnar the Word was there Hallelujah God had to come down to guard it the four presentent God the Bible said there were four four beasts around the tone Jesus Hallelujah for represents a guard what was the Beast doing they were guarding The Mercy Seat they were guarding the throne who is The Mercy Seat today you are The Mercy Seat so God has to guard you amen God has to guard you Hallelujah so God is preserving you Hallelujah you know that you hallelujah thank you Lord you know that God will never lose
