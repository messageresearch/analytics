[33:38] stand just to the reading of the word of
[33:42] God
[33:43] hallelujah in the Book of Matthew we're
[33:46] going to turn back to the Book of
[33:48] Matthew chapter
[33:50] 16 Matthew 16 from verse
[33:53] 13 the word of God said
[33:57] when Jesus came into the
[34:01] coast of cesaria Philippi he asks his
[34:07] disciples you know this city is located
[34:10] in
[34:12] Israel it is located in Israel
[34:16] Hallelujah he ask his disciples saying
[34:19] whom do men say that I the son of man H
[34:26] and as we say that the son of man is
[34:29] Christ
[34:31] embody in a
[34:34] body that's the meaning for Son of Man
[34:39] Christ embod himself in a body
[34:43] Hallelujah and Christ means the anointed
[34:47] one Christ means the Messiah the sent
[34:51] one can I say this you are
[34:55] Christ you are the son of
[34:59] man amen do you believe that praise the
[35:03] Lord so he asks them right whom do say
[35:07] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[35:11] verse 14 and there s some say that thou
[35:15] art John the
[35:18] Baptist some
[35:20] say Elias and others Jeremiah are one of
[35:26] the prophets
[35:27] now Jesus is going to get personal now
[35:31] verse
[35:32] 15 he said unto them but whom say he
[35:36] that I am this is
[35:39] personal this is not about the public
[35:42] this is about you Hallelujah who do you
[35:47] say that I am praise the Lord verse 16
[35:52] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[35:56] Art the Christ Thou Art the Messiah thou
[36:00] are the sent one
[36:03] hallelujah praise God the son of the
[36:07] Living
[36:09] God what a answer what a response to the
[36:13] question Jesus asked in so much in verse
[36:17] 17 and Jesus answered and said unto him
[36:20] blessed art thou wow you think blessing
[36:24] is about material things but when you
[36:27] get Revelation you are
[36:29] [Laughter]
[36:31] blessed Hallelujah I said when you enjoy
[36:36] peace and Tranquility you're blessed
[36:39] it's not about material things alone
[36:42] blessed are though
[36:45] Hallelujah Simon B Jonah remember Simon

[1:18:15] Hallelujah when I Jesus when they
[1:18:18] brought the woman that was caught in the
[1:18:20] act of
[1:18:21] adultery the very law said she must be
[1:18:25] stoned to death but Jesus did opposite
[1:18:28] of what the law said the law require
[1:18:32] Stone to death which is
[1:18:35] condemnation Jesus never come to pass
[1:18:38] condemnation he said I come that that I
[1:18:40] might give them life and give them more
[1:18:44] abundantly that's my purpose thank you
[1:18:47] that's my purpose so when I see somebody
[1:18:49] on the street and they're telling me
[1:18:52] about their pth pass the
[1:18:55] experiences my first impression is not
[1:18:57] to condemn
[1:18:59] you it's to give you
[1:19:01] life it's to give you a new chapter it's
[1:19:05] to give you a new beginning I don't care
[1:19:08] what you did yesterday I don't care what
[1:19:10] you're doing now you know what I am here

[1:19:35] earth you are
[1:19:39] Christ
[1:19:41] hallelujah oh
[1:19:44] Jesus I have understanding of who I am I
[1:19:48] have a knowledge of who I am you know
[1:19:51] what and I'm a and I have a apply the
[1:19:53] wisdom the application of
[1:19:56] it the prophet said
[1:19:59] Jesus he knows who he was he understand
[1:20:03] who he was and where he come from and it
[1:20:07] works for him he said if that work for
[1:20:10] Jesus it can work for you too isn't that
[1:20:14] right you know what Jesus said I come
[1:20:17] from God and I'm going back to God
[1:20:20] hallelujah hallelujah can say I come
[1:20:24] from God yes sir and I'm going back to
[1:20:27] God hallelujah because the same
[1:20:31] characteristics that is in Jesus is
[1:20:34] inside of his body you know what the
[1:20:37] Bible said in Ephesians 2 he has Quicken
[1:20:40] it us Quicken it the word quick Quicken
[1:20:45] it means to make alive to become alive
[1:20:50] you are alive unto God
[1:20:53] that means you're pass from death which
[1:20:56] is
[1:20:57] condemnation Hallelujah condemnation you
[1:21:01] have pass from Death unto life which is
[1:21:04] the newness of life and that newness of
[1:21:07] life now is when it bringing out the
[1:21:10] things of Christ the characteristics of
[1:21:14] Christ the nature of Christ that's the
[1:21:17] newness of Life Hallelujah because now
[1:21:21] and the Bible said and has raised us
[1:21:24] up Hallelujah he has raised us up
[1:21:29] Hallelujah we are raised with
[1:21:32] Christ Hallelujah we are raised with
[1:21:36] Christ that raised means
[1:21:40] Resurrection now wonder why Paul said in
[1:21:42] the book of Colossians 3 he said we are
[1:21:45] risen with
[1:21:47] Christ that's why brother Paul said in
[1:21:49] Philippians 2 he said I want to know him
[1:21:53] and the power of his
[1:21:56] resurrection you know what when you know
[1:21:59] him and the power of his resurrection
[1:22:01] you know things that concern you in
[1:22:03] Christ you find yourself doing
[1:22:06] it you know what I am Christ upon the
[1:22:10] Earth my purpose is to give life is to
[1:22:14] give Grace is to give peace Hallelujah
[1:22:19] that's my purpose thank you Lord
[1:22:22] Sometimes some people hallelujah you
[1:22:24] know what some situation even most
[1:22:27] counselors know
[1:22:28] this some situation when people are
[1:22:31] telling you about their
[1:22:33] problems their problems and so forth you
[1:22:37] know sometimes it just require a simple
[1:22:41] solution a simple
[1:22:44] solution but you have Sometimes some
[1:22:46] people just giving them a whole entire
[1:22:49] chapter or even a book go do this go do
[1:22:53] this go do that go do that darly just
[1:22:56] need just a simple solution you know
[1:22:59] what is that mean the Bible said because
[1:23:03] he said the spirit worketh in the
[1:23:05] children of
[1:23:07] Disobedience that's how simply is the
[1:23:10] spirit work in the children of
[1:23:11] Disobedience because your Disobedience
[1:23:13] the spirit is influencing you to do this
[1:23:16] to do that to misbehave to behave this
[1:23:19] way to your husband to behave this way
[1:23:21] to your wife to behave this way in your
[1:23:23] workplace because you're disobedient so
[1:23:26] all it needs stop being
[1:23:29] disobedient move away from that come
[1:23:33] down cloth yourself with
[1:23:37] humility understand where you went wrong
[1:23:40] acknowledge you're
[1:23:41] wrong you know sometimes they all need
[1:23:44] to say I am sorry I am
[1:23:48] sorry that's all it needs you know what
[1:23:51] I was wrong yesterday
[1:23:53] only you know the way that I talk to you
[1:23:55] I was wrong I shouldn't have talked to
[1:23:57] you that way Hallelujah you know what I
[1:24:01] shouldn't have moved the chair I was
[1:24:03] wrong to move the chair because if I
[1:24:06] didn't move the chair it wouldn't create
[1:24:08] that argument even want to create that
[1:24:11] hostility that we're encounter within
[1:24:13] the home so all we need to do is just
[1:24:16] acknowledge when we are wrong that's all
[1:24:18] it
[1:24:21] needs the Bible said a soft hand turn to
[1:24:24] we Ro but Grievous words s of anger
[1:24:28] Hallelujah but sometimes when we fail to
[1:24:32] understand come back down to
[1:24:35] Revelation the three steps of Revelation
[1:24:39] knowledge understanding and wisdom know
[1:24:42] when to apply
[1:24:44] wisdom know when to to use the
[1:24:47] application of wisdom into the situation
[1:24:50] that's all he needs turn your to the
[1:24:52] book of Ephesians chapter
