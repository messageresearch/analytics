[26:35] and and before I was sick and my
[26:38] original message that I have sitting
[26:39] right here amen and we may touch on it
[26:43] but my original title would have been
[26:48] spiritual conditioned spiritual con
[26:51] sorry spiritual contagious
[26:54] diseases
[26:56] spiritual contagious
[26:59] diseases
[27:02] spiritually speaking
[27:05] even physically speaking we can get
[27:07] diseases and they're highly contagious
[27:09] you know even in this flu season the
[27:12] number one thing they'll tell you to do
[27:13] is wash your hands wash your hands and
[27:16] face wash your doorknobs wash your
[27:18] clothes amen and and I believe in sour
[27:23] amen don't be afraid of water it won't
[27:25] hurt you amen we do these things and
[27:28] sometimes we still
[27:29] amen
[27:31] get diseases amen but spiritually
[27:34] speaking their spiritual diseases that
[27:37] are contagious
[27:38] in the body
[27:40] amen and I want to I want to show you
[27:43] something and and I'm not going to try
[27:45] to finish this I'll finish it later and
[27:47] and also I'm sorry I'm so uh out to
[27:51] lunch this morning but for uh Sunday is
[27:54] New Year's
[27:55] and I'd like to have communion at foot
[27:57] washing January 1st
[28:00] that'll be the week after Christmas now
[28:02] if that is catastrophe for anybody
[28:05] we'll just move it back a week
[28:07] hey man but we'll do that Sunday morning
[28:09] we'll Minister on communion and we'll
[28:12] have community in Fort Washington
[28:13] January 1st
[28:15] here there's a perfect example and we
[28:18] know that our profit was a type of
[28:19] typologist you know and he taped the
[28:22] natural to the spiritual and I want to
[28:24] show you this before we go into to our
[28:27] contagious diseases and and positive can
[28:31] be contagious
[28:32] but negativity can be contagious too and
[28:36] not that I'm preaching on negativity
[28:37] because I'm not but I want to show you
[28:40] an example
[28:41] of something that God created and it
[28:45] matches just beautifully with the bride
[28:47] of Christ
[28:49] and that is the Canadian geese
[28:53] Canadian geese if you look into their
[28:55] study and I have I have a Google print
[28:57] out of the five of the most peculiar
[28:59] things that Canadian geese are
[29:02] and Canadian geese it's not by no chance
[29:04] that they fly in a V formation it's not
[29:07] no chance that they fly behind one
[29:09] another and it's not no chance that they
[29:11] honk
[29:13] they don't just honk because they're
[29:15] dumb brute animals
[29:17] and if you compare that to the bride of
[29:20] Christ and if you compare that to the
[29:22] church
[29:23] it's so beautiful
[29:25] you know our Prophet said and I'm not
[29:27] putting it on you but the prophet said
[29:29] that a Ministry 50 of it is the people
[29:33] the people came to the prophet and they
[29:35] said to him they said Oh Brother praying
[29:37] they said I would have loved to heard
[29:39] your message but I was so sidetracked
[29:40] because the person was shouting amen and
[29:42] praise the Lord and just distracted me
[29:44] completely that I couldn't even
[29:46] comprehend or hear what you were saying
[29:48] and brother Brown said he said if they
[29:50] wouldn't have been shouting praise the
[29:51] Lord and amen he said I would have been
[29:54] distracted and I wouldn't have been able
[29:55] to minister the word because they were
[29:57] pulling on the word
[29:59] so I was ministered
[30:03] Canadian geese
[30:04] when they're flying hunk and his
[30:07] Sciences proved it
[30:09] that it is the sole purpose is to
[30:12] encourage the goose in front of them
[30:14] that they can continue and fly their
[30:17] distance farther
[30:19] they've also proven that a Canadian
[30:21] geese when they fly together and they
[30:23] fly in their formation and hunk and say
[30:26] Amen
[30:28] that they can fly 71 percent
[30:32] farther
[30:36] 71 percent
[30:38] farther
[30:40] amazing
[30:43] Amanda they've proven it that when they
[30:45] fly in the v formation that they fly
[30:48] just slightly elevated from the one in
[30:50] front of them and the updraft comes
[30:52] underneath the bottom one and it
[30:54] actually eases his percentage in the
[30:56] high
[30:57] 70 percent rate to Flying and to the
[31:00] point that when the goose would get out
[31:02] of the updraft he would immediately feel
[31:04] the drag of the world on him and come
[31:06] back into line immediately
[31:08] because he just stepped out
[31:11] of the updraft
[31:13] he's compare that to the Holy Ghost it's
[31:15] just beautiful
[31:17] beautiful
[31:20] Amanda said when they fly in the v
[31:22] formation what it creates the updraft
[31:25] and the one or the one the one that
[31:27] spotted said it reduces the friction
[31:31] compare that spiritually
[31:34] when we're together and unified it
[31:35] reduces the friction of the world
[31:38] and the drag on your life I you know I
[31:40] mentioned I was reading Pastor books and
[31:42] you know quotes that our Prophet said
[31:44] about pastors and I'm going to tell you
[31:46] something that Satan is real and and no
[31:50] one including holy ghost-filled people
[31:52] are not
[31:54] affected with the drag of the world on
[31:56] your life amen and me as a minister I'm
[32:00] sorry I'm not well I'm actually I'm not
[32:02] sorry I don't apologize for saying the
[32:04] truth and God by God's grace if he would
[32:07] always help me to say the truth the
[32:09] church will be empty
[32:10] but we'll still be saying the truth
[32:12] because I would never want to get to
[32:14] Glory
[32:15] and him saying to all these people here
[32:17] their blood is on your hands because you
[32:19] just refuse to tell them all you just
[32:22] had to do was tell them the truth all I
[32:24] have to do to go and not have somebody
[32:26] else's blood on that's walked out of
[32:28] this church it's just to have told them
[32:30] the truth
[32:32] God help me amen you know the you know
[32:36] the world considers uh you know we're
[32:39] talking about natural type and you you
[32:42] consider the spider how they weed their
[32:44] web
[32:46] and their web is basically on scene and
[32:49] sticky and it will catch their prey and
[32:52] then they'll come back on their web and
[32:53] they will eat it and that's a perfect
[32:55] type of Satan and don't be deceived
[32:58] watches Church don't be deceived Satan
[33:03] knows exactly what he's doing
[33:06] that's why our internet
[33:09] is called the web
[33:12] and it is the most deceptive thing in
[33:14] the world you know our Prophet preached
[33:16] against TV and one of the two of the
[33:19] main things he preached against TV was
[33:20] this was you and miss church for TV
[33:23] amen
[33:24] but he said you can't control TV
[33:27] and I'll guarantee you I don't care if
[33:29] your Holy Ghost filled or not
[33:31] internet and we're going to 5G now amen
[33:35] the web is uncontrollable
[33:38] because I've been in my house with my
[33:40] wife and but listen to a Minister preach
[33:42] the gospel and the very next web page
[33:44] underneath is somebody that's just not
[33:46] off a bit but if you would have pushed
[33:48] on that it would have been straight from
[33:49] a message preaching to straight up
[33:51] full-fledged pornography
[33:54] you mad
[33:56] what God could use for for good Satan
[34:00] has Twisted through the web of his of
[34:03] his web

[34:14] without the internet well I'll tell you
[34:15] this
[34:17] you are what you eat spiritually
[34:20] and I wouldn't use it no more than you
[34:22] need
[34:28] amen
[34:29] when the prophet preached against TV was
[34:32] he he said you might be watching if it
[34:34] was possible maybe a hundred years ago
[34:36] it was
[34:38] you might be watching a movie that was
[34:42] if it was possible
[34:44] a hundred years ago okay but he said you
[34:46] couldn't control the
[34:48] the commercials
[34:51] you can't control the commercials on the
[34:53] web
[34:55] you can go listen to whatever you want
[34:57] on the web
[34:58] amen it's of the devil and it's real and
[35:03] I'll tell you what and I mean I'm really
[35:05] I preaching on this I just I've seen it
[35:08] and I've seen but I'm going to tell you
[35:09] what
[35:10] God don't change
[35:13] and you know our Prophet is just I I
[35:16] hardly day goes by I'm not in studying
[35:19] it you know the prophet talked about he
[35:21] said you know the the methodists when
[35:23] they were Holiness it was wrong for
[35:25] people to go to movie shows got their
[35:27] hair
[35:28] said you moved the movie show right in
[35:29] your living room and you all cut your
[35:31] hair but you're still singing in the
[35:33] choir
[35:34] God never changed you were going to hell
[35:36] 100 years ago you're still going to hell
[35:39] to do that if it was wrong to paint your
[35:41] face like just about it's still wrong to
[35:43] paint your face
[35:44] to wear high heels to show your body or
[35:46] to wear the wrong clothing
[35:49] amen
[35:50] you say why are you preaching on that
[35:52] and getting it off my chest
[35:54] it's it's serious business
[35:57] you know
[35:59] and if that gives you a complex
[36:04] there ain't nothing I can do about it
[36:07] I'm sorry for you
[36:09] but I can't fix it
[36:13] and I want to show you this morning
[36:15] through Satan's web that that's his plan
[36:20] and that's what he's done through the
[36:23] web
[36:24] even in I don't mean in our we're online
[36:27] this morning amen you know I've seen a
[36:30] special and I don't mean it this is no
[36:32] pun intended
[36:34] but time is a blur
[36:37] and if I would have had my voice I would
[36:39] have sang a song I sang five years ago
[36:40] today I say consider the lilies
[36:44] five years ago behind the pulpit of a
[36:46] special
[36:48] and it was just
[36:50] I wore the same vest
[36:52] and you think what it was just five
[36:54] years ago it was like what happened
[36:57] where did the five years go
[36:59] it'll be like that in five more years
[37:02] amen but Satan through the web is is is
[37:05] is This is distracting us and causing us
[37:09] to to to pull us out of fellowship and
[37:13] unity you've seen the scriptures that we
[37:15] read
[37:16] you know watch this
[37:18] watch this he's pulling us out of unity
[37:20] and don't worry if they think I don't
[37:23] even you could even care less about
[37:25] their Doctrine if another church this
[37:28] time of year has a service go to it
[37:31] you're not going to get leprosy
[37:34] amen spiritually speaking
[37:38] amen
[37:42] Show Yourself friendly Christ didn't
[37:45] stay in a box Jesus went to the town
[37:48] amen he spoke the truth but he went to
[37:52] the Towny man he didn't he didn't hide
[37:54] and here Satan has built the web and
[37:58] he's built it in the church he's built
[38:01] it the strongest in message churches
[38:04] God help me
[38:06] and he's built in the world
[38:10] and it's contagious
[38:13] it is called the complex
[38:20] and it's very contagious
[38:25] and it'll pull you out of fellowship and
[38:27] it'll pull you miles from God
[38:30] and the reason it'll pull you miles from
[38:32] God is because it'll pull you from your
[38:34] brothers and sisters
[38:37] amen
[38:38] it's of the devil in every part of it
[38:41] is of the devil
[38:43] amen
[38:46] let's just step aside and look at the
[38:48] goose again they say as long as they're
[38:51] able to stay in unity
[38:53] I already told you they could fly up to
[38:55] 75 percent farther they said if I if uh
[39:07] they said ghosts
[39:09] if they become injured or sick
[39:12] because it's so hard to be alone
[39:14] consider a complex because it's so hard
[39:17] to be alone
[39:18] two ghosts will go back and sit and wait
[39:22] for the ghosts
[39:23] that's injured or sick
[39:26] and so when he comes back and tries to
[39:28] catch up to the flock he don't have to
[39:30] catch up
[39:31] alone
[39:33] because the drag would be so hard
[39:36] on his weak body
[39:38] we could learn so much from nature
[39:42] just in the church
[39:44] how we treat each other
[39:47] God help us amen
[39:52] due to the
[39:57] due to the the v formation and the the
[40:00] lift that is Created from the ones
[40:02] behind them they said
[40:06] our God is an amazing person
[40:08] he said no one man
[40:11] no one Goose was be able to take the
[40:13] leadership of the goose
[40:16] alone
[40:19] and so God made a faithful Ministry
[40:24] so when a pastor or Minister was down
[40:28] there was somebody else that wasn't down
[40:31] and they would drop to the very back to
[40:33] get the most lift from all the other
[40:35] goose and another five-fold would step
[40:37] right into his position
[40:40] oh it's beautiful
[40:42] if a dumb brute geese that goes to my
[40:45] field to try to eat all my wheat knows
[40:48] more about the gospel
[40:50] the message people sitting in churches
[40:54] it's not a one-man show it's not a
[40:57] pastor show
[40:58] it's not a Dale show it's a
[41:00] it's a group show
[41:04] amen they say in doing this
[41:08] for the leadership of the position
[41:10] because God created a five-fold Ministry
[41:13] it and it shows that other people have
[41:17] skills and talents and knowledge and
[41:19] experiences that can be used
[41:21] for every single other goose
[41:24] to support them
[41:26] as they fly
[41:29] it just sounds like God wrote the goose
[41:33] it's unbelievable
[41:35] it's unbelievable
[41:38] I already told you about how why they
[41:40] honked they said when they honked behind
[41:41] one another it encourages them to
[41:43] maintain their speed and keep flying to
[41:45] their extended goal
[41:48] to not stop before their goal
[41:56] wow
[42:01] God help us amen
[42:06] also gives the goose feedback when
[42:09] they're all honking
[42:11] gives them feedback from one another as
[42:14] a tape of not just encouragement but
[42:16] communication
[42:17] how they are doing
[42:20] amen
[42:24] Gates when they fly south
[42:27] they always fly
[42:29] to the same location
[42:33] the word of God
[42:35] they never leave their original plan
[42:39] it's beautiful they say here they say
[42:42] because the ones are raised and births
[42:45] on the way or before they go the Elder
[42:47] ones will show the younger geese
[42:50] the way
[42:52] that they take to escape the cold
[42:55] weather
[42:57] as the Bible says that the older sisters
[42:59] will train up teach the younger sisters
[43:01] and all these different things that the
[43:03] Bible teaches us
[43:05] all
[43:06] watch how they close here he says for
[43:09] all for the purpose of the team when
[43:12] they just get to the goal and it
[43:13] includes
[43:15] for the for the good
[43:17] the culture of the group
[43:19] it's all
[43:21] for the team of God Amen
[43:24] to learn the mission of where they're
[43:26] going
[43:27] and how it'll be done how they teach the
[43:29] other one younger ones encourage the
[43:31] team members to share experiences
[43:34] by their honking
[43:35] it's like praying for one another they
[43:38] share experiences learning that they
[43:41] came across in their work and encourage
[43:43] new members to learn
[43:46] from their comrades
[43:51] a goose
[43:57] here let's just look at a scripture here
[43:59] and I don't know how far we'll go but I
[44:01] want to show you some Bible examples
[44:03] of what Satan's done in God's family
[44:07] and it's of the devil
[44:10] and it's called the web
[44:13] and it's everywhere
[44:16] and I want to show you how Holy Ghost
[44:18] filled people
[44:20] are affected by the web of Satan
[44:29] numbers 20.
[44:31] starting at seven
[44:33] Amy
[44:38] I know what you're thinking or might
[44:39] think they might say well at this time
[44:41] in the Bible the Holy Ghost wasn't given
[44:44] yet
[44:45] but I didn't give you our up-to-date
[44:47] examples yet
[44:51] the Lord spake unto Moses saying take
[44:54] the rod and gather today to assemble it
[44:56] together and thou and Aaron and thy
[44:59] brother and speak unto the rock before
[45:01] their eyes and it shall give forth his
[45:03] water
[45:05] and thou shalt bring forth to them water
[45:08] out of the Rock The Rock was the Faith
[45:10] of Christ
[45:12] so thou so give it to the congregation
[45:16] and their Beast to drink the water was
[45:19] the type of the Holy Spirit spiritually
[45:20] speaking and Moses took the rod before
[45:23] God the Lord
[45:25] as he commanded him
[45:30] I want to stop right there that Rod that
[45:33] Moses took
[45:34] got Moses had seen God do a lot of stuff
[45:38] through the rod
[45:40] it wasn't just
[45:43] a physical
[45:45] Rod to Moses like it would be to us
[45:50] see Moses had seen God part in the Red
[45:52] Seas with the rod
[45:55] he had seen God he'd throw his rod down
[45:57] and it turned into a serpent and
[45:59] Pharaoh's you know the serpents ate it
[46:02] and then Moses turned around and picked
[46:04] his up and it became a rod
[46:07] so it's don't be too hard on Moses I
[46:10] know we're going to criticize Moses for
[46:11] making a mistake here but Moses would
[46:14] have considered his rod
[46:17] pretty holy
[46:23] don't take my rod
[46:31] I mean if you see God works through
[46:33] something like that
[46:35] I think it was pretty holy too
[46:41] but God never said
[46:44] rod
[46:46] and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[46:48] congregation together before the Rock
[46:50] and he said unto them
[46:53] this is where Satan came on the scene
[46:55] here ye here now
[46:58] you rebels
[47:00] these were God's people
[47:03] here now you rebels
[47:06] you're a huge pain in the neck to me
[47:09] must we me and Aaron fetch water out of
[47:13] this rock to you
[47:16] now he was immediately making himself
[47:19] to the supernatural that it was his own
[47:21] ability to bring water out of that rock
[47:25] and even though God had raised Moses up
[47:27] and he was a prophet and yes he was God
[47:29] to Pharaoh he was not able to bring
[47:31] water out of that rock
[47:36] you see how
[47:38] Satan's web
[47:39] had grabbed onto
[47:41] a predestinated
[47:44] god-called man
[47:47] and he was offended
[47:50] why was he offended
[47:52] he was completely a free man was he
[47:55] offended because God brought him out of
[47:57] Egypt open the Red Sea
[47:59] fed him gave him all the riches of Egypt
[48:02] and did Miracles after Miracles come
[48:04] down with the pillar of fire and let him
[48:05] in the night time in the cloud in the
[48:07] day
[48:11] Moses lifted up his hands
[48:14] and with the rod that special rod
[48:18] he smote The Rock twice
[48:21] and the water came out abundantly
[48:24] and the congregation eight their drank
[48:27] and their beasts also
[48:30] now if you were in the right Church
[48:31] you'd just say well praise God
[48:34] everything's good
[48:37] but if you look back before God never
[48:39] mentioned nothing about him taking the
[48:41] rod
[48:43] is to take the the rod and gather the
[48:46] assembly together but not to get the
[48:48] water
[48:50] amen just see how close the difference
[48:52] was
[48:53] and that's just like the kind of web
[48:55] that God will try to catch us in
[48:58] in our day
[49:00] like in the internet
[49:04] we'll say well bless God I'm listening
[49:05] to music
[49:06] make sure it's the right music
[49:10] amen if you're listening to stuff that
[49:13] your kids can't babies can't watch if
[49:15] you're watching a movie that that
[49:18] Leah can't watch then you can't watch it
[49:20] either
[49:25] if you don't want Leah slobbering on a
[49:27] 10 year old boy when she finds her first
[49:28] love then why would you watch a movie
[49:30] that's like that
[49:36] that's Satan's web
[49:39] the same as well and the Lord spank unto
[49:42] Moses and Aaron he said because thou
[49:43] believeth me not
[49:48] how could God say that
[49:51] you got the water for him
[49:54] because he didn't obey
[49:58] to signify me in the eyes and to
[50:01] what's that
[50:03] the word honey to sanctify
[50:07] sanctify me in the eyes of the children
[50:09] of Israel therefore ye shall not bring
[50:11] this congregation the land which I'd
[50:14] given them
[50:15] and the land the promised land then was
[50:17] the type of the Holy Ghost
[50:19] and Moses wouldn't lead those people to
[50:21] the holy ghost or you might say lead
[50:23] them to Christ the anointed one
[50:26] he would not lead those people to the
[50:28] anointed one because of one little
[50:30] boo-boo
[50:33] what was it a little bit
[50:36] it wasn't pornography
[50:40] he was still in the church
[50:43] he was gathered with the Believers
[50:45] the need was met
[50:49] it was almost proper
[50:55] you think of well
[50:58] I I almost did everything right
[51:05] I don't care if you almost do it right
[51:09] you won't be there
[51:12] amen
[51:13] see Moses
[51:16] got worn out
[51:19] with the people of God
[51:22] and we can get worn out with the people
[51:23] of God just because they don't
[51:28] do what we expect them to do
[51:33] and see this is Satan's whole plan is
[51:36] and that's why it's called the web now
[51:38] just consider the spider the spider
[51:40] don't plan on the Fly seeing the web
[51:44] and the fighter don't tell the fly that
[51:47] it's sticky too
[51:50] and he definitely don't tell him that
[51:52] I'm going to walk back out and eat you
[51:54] alive
[52:00] neither does Satan tell you
[52:02] that when you got the Holy Ghost
[52:05] and he can give you a complex by showing
[52:09] you
[52:10] something
[52:12] maybe not even wrong
[52:15] that he will he will he will he will
[52:19] pull you out of the uni he will he will
[52:22] uh
[52:23] single you out by yourself
[52:28] and you will fly 71 percent less farther
[52:32] and slower
[52:34] because you're not getting the updraft
[52:37] of the Holy ghost-filled Believers in
[52:39] the church
[52:41] because you're thinking you're because
[52:43] see now anytime you get a combat I got
[52:46] to stay behind this mic anytime you get
[52:48] a complex it's because you're right
[52:50] and of course the people you have a
[52:52] complex with
[52:53] they're wrong
[52:56] but guess who had effects
[52:59] not the ones that are wrong
[53:01] by your opinion
[53:03] they don't even know what happened
[53:07] amen
[53:11] see Satan is such a professional you say
[53:14] but this would never happen today
[53:17] our prophet got a complex
[53:20] and he told God he said I'm gonna he was
[53:23] actually with this boy
[53:25] and he he told him not to tell his wife
[53:28] and he said when I get back home and
[53:29] pick up my honey and I'm going up north
[53:32] and I'm going to be like the prop Bibles
[53:34] and the prophet I'm going to follow the
[53:35] word of God
[53:37] perfectly
[53:39] that sounds good
[53:42] don't it
[53:44] Moses was using his Rod that God had
[53:47] worked through on a regular basis
[53:50] multiple multiple multiple types
[53:54] Moses Rod was a Moses or Aaron's rod
[53:57] budded in the in the holies of holies
[53:59] used to open the Red Sea used it in
[54:01] Pharaoh's thing with The Serpent and the
[54:03] snag picked it out in the back to
[54:08] and God told our prophet he said
[54:12] well let's just look at the prophets in
[54:14] the bible they didn't live with the
[54:16] people
[54:19] our Prophet had a very good example
[54:22] said all the prophets went out in the
[54:23] wilderness and when you wanted them to
[54:25] go tell the people something that you
[54:27] give them thus saith the Lord he went in
[54:28] and told the king boom he blasted out
[54:31] fired and works
[54:34] was out for two or three days and went
[54:35] right back in the wilderness and prayed
[54:37] and fasted and served God
[54:40] that sounds really good
[54:43] and God taught our prophet he said
[54:45] if you do that
[54:47] your wife will leave you
[54:50] you'll become a bomb a drunker
[54:55] because that's not what I called you to
[55:00] because our Prophet had to Peculiar work
[55:02] and God called the max to the work of an
[55:03] evangelist that means he was with the
[55:05] people
[55:07] even though he was a prophet
[55:09] that's what he says himself
[55:14] so an evangelist can't be
[55:17] an evangelist in the wilderness because
[55:19] there ain't no evangelist than to do
[55:22] even though he was a prophet
[55:25] in the field of evangelist
[55:33] s
[55:34] and standing in the Gap here I want to
[55:36] show you some examples of people and how
[55:38] easy it is
[55:40] to get in this uh spot here
[55:44] uh
[55:50] Brother Band of Stockton but he said
[55:51] pray that God will place back in my
[55:53] heart something that I lost
[55:55] there in that complex
[55:58] now I want to I I would say to you is
[56:00] did Brother Branham have the Holy Ghost
[56:03] well you don't have to answer that
[56:04] because of course he had the Holy Ghost
[56:05] amen
[56:07] and he said it was so easy I'm reading
[56:11] quote word for word
[56:13] it was so easy
[56:17] to build the complex
[56:22] now our Prophet seen the powerful move
[56:24] of God in
[56:26] a dynamic way like most of Amen on a
[56:31] daily basis
[56:33] how in the world
[56:34] when he's seen this Red Seas open the
[56:37] pillar fire lead them at night and the
[56:39] cloud that day and come in between the
[56:41] Egyptian Army and them before they were
[56:43] blocked by the Red Sea and seeing them
[56:45] leave Egypt with all the richest 2
[56:46] million strong and all the wealth of
[56:48] Egypt and their firstborn not die and
[56:55] and they had a complex
[56:59] so if you tell me this morning or
[57:01] somebody tells me
[57:03] that's the reason people walk out of
[57:05] church
[57:06] is because the minister touches on
[57:08] something they don't want they have a
[57:09] complex and they'll just
[57:12] and they it's and and it's exactly
[57:15] things planned because it's it singles
[57:17] you out and Satan tells you that you're
[57:20] the Holy One because you're the one
[57:21] standing for truth but you'll fly 71
[57:25] percent less slower
[57:27] and you'll be 71 percent less weaker
[57:31] because you're not in the Unified
[57:33] how good and pleasant it is
[57:38] to be in the body
[57:40] amen and I had an interview the other
[57:43] day with brother Wade sitting here and
[57:45] standing in front a good man but he
[57:47] built himself around a complex another
[57:49] kind of a complex and it did the same
[57:51] thing brother Wade you can easily see
[57:54] what it did a little something in your
[57:56] mind keep you thinking and you go back
[57:59] and you check with the scriptures and
[58:00] see if it's not right
[58:03] and then go from there and go on
[58:06] but he said don't lose the feeling of
[58:09] the people
[58:10] and that's not for a minister
[58:12] see the people can lose the feeling of
[58:14] the people
[58:15] the prophet talked about I believe it
[58:18] was the prophet or it was in the third
[58:20] world countries but I believe it was a
[58:23] prophet and I was reading in the past
[58:24] month or so and when the people would
[58:27] leave at the beginning of the thing that
[58:30] they would be shaking hands to say
[58:31] goodbye and the people would be sobbing
[58:33] because they couldn't imagine there was
[58:35] going to be six days before they would
[58:37] see him again
[58:39] solving
[58:46] he said you must remember that those
[58:48] people that you lost a feeling for are
[58:51] not made out of sawdust they're actually
[58:52] flesh and blood
[58:55] that Christ died for their soul he said
[58:57] pray for me that God will give me back
[58:59] the feeling
[59:01] that I once had for the people here's
[59:03] another example
[59:05] in a paradox is a 6308 quote and he says
[59:09] because
[59:10] no one can change the spirit of a man
[59:13] he said and he gives him a new birth
[59:20] outside of God
[59:22] here he's talking about a boy
[59:24] that was friends with the girl
[59:28] amen and
[59:31] he had uh
[59:34] you know done something where I believe
[59:36] he broke up with the girl and he'd hurt
[59:39] the girl anyway
[59:40] and the boy wouldn't apologize for him
[59:42] and the prophet said he said let me read
[59:45] just the Highlight part he said there
[59:46] was a fine young man a very fine man and
[59:49] a girl and a fine family and
[59:56] something happened the boy just walked
[59:58] away from the girl and he did something
[1:00:00] to the girl and so much as he had
[1:00:02] promised oh he promised to marry her or
[1:00:04] to do something a certain thing and it
[1:00:06] didn't didn't do it
[1:00:09] was a merrier just had promised to do
[1:00:11] something for her and instead of coming
[1:00:13] back to the girl and apologizing like a
[1:00:15] gentleman what he said it just wasn't in
[1:00:17] that boy to do it
[1:00:19] but see it was even though his family
[1:00:22] were Christians amen this is a fairly
[1:00:24] long quote we're not going to dwell on
[1:00:26] it but it it didn't matter he said it he
[1:00:29] was operating under the gene of the old
[1:00:32] man
[1:00:33] and even though his mom and dad were
[1:00:35] holy ghost-filled people came to Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost filled people
[1:00:38] he said the dad was strictly an Irishman
[1:00:41] which is Moody and high tempered and
[1:00:43] high strung and uh you know he's talking
[1:00:46] about the different traits of the family
[1:00:50] and the girls family you know they were
[1:00:52] close to church
[1:00:53] uh
[1:00:55] but he said it was it wasn't they
[1:00:57] weren't a type of family to ask
[1:00:58] forgiveness or pardon he talked about
[1:01:00] the the German background is very proud
[1:01:03] background he said you could pass him by
[1:01:04] the street and they'd stare right at you
[1:01:06] I mean stare at you man and like you and
[1:01:08] not until you had I wouldn't even Flinch
[1:01:09] I just
[1:01:11] he said it was the weirdest thing
[1:01:14] but he said I was just their genes are
[1:01:16] their parents
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:20] and the genes of the father and mother
[1:01:22] of this boy no matter how much they were
[1:01:24] converted Still Remains a flesh that had
[1:01:27] inbred out of this boy and there the boy
[1:01:29] had got a complex in them
[1:01:31] in him just like
[1:01:34] from his mother's family
[1:01:36] and they are not forgiving and they will
[1:01:39] not apologize and that's where the boy
[1:01:41] stands amen
[1:01:43] and he goes and talks about how the only
[1:01:46] way you could get rid of that complex
[1:01:47] and the only way you could to not have
[1:01:49] that was to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost amen and he had to have it
[1:01:54] personally it wouldn't matter that the
[1:01:55] parents had it it wouldn't have affected
[1:01:57] the boy at all
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:00] it just wasn't in his nature to do that
[1:02:02] but but there's many examples I want to
[1:02:05] stress on you was and even in the
[1:02:07] prophet and the other brother that was
[1:02:08] right in there with brother Brown
[1:02:11] was there's holy ghost-filled bannisters
[1:02:13] and people with complex ministers are
[1:02:17] the most common to get a complex because
[1:02:19] they feel like the brother Brown did
[1:02:20] because he didn't feel like the people
[1:02:21] heard his message
[1:02:23] amen you can get a complex when you sing
[1:02:26] a special and you see somebody make a
[1:02:28] face because you miss a tune or you
[1:02:30] don't think they're paying attention or
[1:02:32] whatever or somebody falls asleep or
[1:02:37] man
[1:02:39] or you singing special and somebody
[1:02:41] don't tell you it was a great special or
[1:02:46] it's just you're just imagining it
[1:02:48] you can be doing something up front here
[1:02:50] and somebody can put their head down and
[1:02:52] you say see they can't even stand me
[1:02:54] being behind the pulpit and maybe in
[1:02:56] reality they're actually praying for you
[1:03:00] but Satan didn't tell you that
[1:03:06] it's called the web
[1:03:09] and when he gets you alone you'll be
[1:03:10] destroyed
[1:03:12] because God didn't make us to live alone
[1:03:14] God didn't make us to serve him alone
[1:03:16] God didn't make us to stay in our house
[1:03:18] alone
[1:03:19] amen forsake not to something of
[1:03:21] yourself together and like matter as
[1:03:23] some have already done
[1:03:30] but to assemble together all the more
[1:03:32] as you see Satan bring it up the web
[1:03:38] the very good preaching that's on the
[1:03:41] internet
[1:03:43] Satan will turn and used for a web to
[1:03:45] catch people at a fellowship
[1:03:50] whoa
[1:03:52] questions and answers 64 he said when a
[1:03:55] person realizes they have an inferior
[1:03:57] complex or a sort of some sort of a
[1:04:01] complex
[1:04:02] how may they overcome this this is a
[1:04:04] question
[1:04:06] amen that they asked the prophet
[1:04:09] and this he give very very short answer
[1:04:13] but very very good answer
[1:04:15] he said if God if you see yourself
[1:04:17] getting in a complex do exactly the
[1:04:19] opposite of what your complex is
[1:04:22] you don't think somebody likes your
[1:04:23] singing go up and ask them if they like
[1:04:25] your singing
[1:04:28] man if you're nervous about new people
[1:04:30] coming to church make sure you go
[1:04:31] they're the first one you talk to
[1:04:34] amen you got a complex because you go
[1:04:36] late in the food line make sure you go
[1:04:38] first next time
[1:04:40] whatever it would be do the exact
[1:04:42] opposite he said do exactly the opposite
[1:04:45] and if you're always wanting your way
[1:04:47] and a little
[1:04:49] brat that always wants his way and
[1:04:51] everything your way he said turn back
[1:04:53] around and give everything you got away
[1:04:56] he said if you're selfish and you want
[1:04:59] to hold on to everything he said start
[1:05:00] giving everything you own away
[1:05:02] he said do whatever it takes just they
[1:05:04] said do vice versa he said that's the
[1:05:07] way to overcome
[1:05:08] what Satan's trying to put on you
[1:05:11] amen Moses Hears A standing and a god
[1:05:14] finishing this quote in paragraph 160
[1:05:17] Moses lost the feeling of the people
[1:05:20] because they wouldn't listen to him and
[1:05:23] it bothered
[1:05:24] and brother Roy you see in your dream
[1:05:27] and he's talking about the people
[1:05:31] and because you say well this complex
[1:05:34] won't hurt me because I got the baptism
[1:05:35] of the Holy Ghost and I can serve God
[1:05:38] alone because I know I'm right
[1:05:43] well sorry to tell you but I'm not sorry
[1:05:46] to tell you but Moses never went to the
[1:05:48] promised land which was the type of the
[1:05:50] Holy Ghost
[1:05:52] because of his complex
[1:05:56] Hi man
[1:05:57] and anybody that takes one word from the
[1:06:00] word or add one word to the word
[1:06:03] his name will be taken out of the Lamb's
[1:06:05] Book of Life
[1:06:06] so how's that going to do when you're in
[1:06:08] your own web
[1:06:10] when the word says you can't live in
[1:06:12] your own web
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:17] see it used to be
[1:06:19] Satan knows exactly how to get
[1:06:23] where he's going but it won't hinder
[1:06:24] God's work
[1:06:26] it used to be in the old watch this just
[1:06:29] I know you are younger than me but in
[1:06:32] the olden days
[1:06:34] everybody went to town
[1:06:37] for Fellowship
[1:06:39] nowadays nobody has to go to town I was
[1:06:41] talking to restaurant owner yesterday I
[1:06:43] sell patties to he said before covet he
[1:06:46] said Friday night was my biggest week
[1:06:49] night I made more money on Friday night
[1:06:50] than any night of the week
[1:06:52] said it was party night he said the
[1:06:54] place I've been there on Friday night
[1:06:55] when I had to wait almost outside the
[1:06:57] door you could physically the lineup
[1:07:00] would be so long to go for a table
[1:07:06] he said now
[1:07:08] Friday night is the smallest part of the
[1:07:10] day of the week
[1:07:11] that I have all seven days
[1:07:15] he said people have come accustomed
[1:07:18] to staying alone
[1:07:20] and staying home
[1:07:22] he said I make the least amount of money
[1:07:25] that I make on any night
[1:07:29] on Friday night
[1:07:32] he said but that's just a restaurant
[1:07:33] Satan knows exactly what he's doing
[1:07:35] don't kid yourself I had somebody tell
[1:07:37] me I was reaching out to people that's
[1:07:39] been here to church and not here for a
[1:07:41] while and they live an hour from church
[1:07:43] and
[1:07:44] you know new Believers and he said you
[1:07:46] know brother Dale he said last time we
[1:07:47] were there you were preaching that you
[1:07:49] didn't think you would Harvest your
[1:07:50] soybeans this fall before God to come
[1:07:52] back I said you know what brother I'm
[1:07:54] supposed to say but I said I still think
[1:07:56] that way
[1:07:58] I said now I'd be saying I don't think
[1:08:00] I'll be planting my soybeans
[1:08:06] but it's a web
[1:08:11] that Satan plans on saying well it's
[1:08:14] never going to be it's never going to
[1:08:15] come it's never
[1:08:19] and he pulls you alone
[1:08:21] and then he eats you do you know when a
[1:08:24] spider comes in do we eat his prey
[1:08:26] you can check this on Google but I
[1:08:28] believe it's correct that they normally
[1:08:30] start eating at the head
[1:08:34] but spider comes you don't start eating
[1:08:36] the Flies and wings
[1:08:40] you don't eat the waste in his stomach
[1:08:43] just think of that spiritually
[1:08:48] and you I don't mean to have even him in
[1:08:50] the minister of the fight for a Ministry
[1:08:51] just think of yourself in the web it's
[1:08:53] coming the greatest bottle ever fought
[1:08:56] in your mind
[1:08:59] it's destroying
[1:09:01] trying to destroy the bride of Christ
[1:09:03] here's a person that came in the prayer
[1:09:05] line he said you were in an accident and
[1:09:07] you were gasped by carbon dioxide he
[1:09:09] said is that true and he said it
[1:09:10] poisoned you and it poisoned hurt your
[1:09:12] liver and it troubled you now watch how
[1:09:15] watch I'm showing you different ways
[1:09:17] that Satan worked and he said it
[1:09:19] troubled you in your stomach because
[1:09:21] your liver was poisoned what's that got
[1:09:24] to do with the web
[1:09:27] and you had trouble with your heart is
[1:09:30] that right he said yes and it made you
[1:09:32] so nervous
[1:09:38] way to make him nervous
[1:09:40] until you built the complex
[1:09:43] and you were afraid to be around people
[1:09:45] and you were afraid to go back to work
[1:09:48] you were afraid to be around God's
[1:09:49] people
[1:09:53] because of a car accident
[1:09:55] was no other believer's fault
[1:09:57] he got carbon dioxide poisoning it
[1:09:59] affected his liver and heart his stomach
[1:10:02] and it made him nervous and anxious
[1:10:04] they built a complex
[1:10:06] and he wanted to single himself out and
[1:10:08] die
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:13] see Satan wasn't able to kill the guy in
[1:10:15] the accident
[1:10:16] so he was going to try to kill him with
[1:10:18] the complex
[1:10:20] in his web
[1:10:22] and here we recently here here recently
[1:10:25] it's our Prophet talking
[1:10:28] 630707 an indictment he said recently I
[1:10:32] was going to quit preaching
[1:10:33] because the people wouldn't hear me and
[1:10:36] they just kept on doing the same thing
[1:10:39] and I got discouraged and I built the
[1:10:41] complex
[1:10:42] I said oh my God a couple Sundays ago if
[1:10:45] you'll just give me
[1:10:46] a sign out here
[1:10:49] I was our prophet
[1:10:52] and you say well
[1:10:55] he had a lot of followers and he had a
[1:10:57] lot of problems
[1:10:58] if he got a complex
[1:11:01] and he preached to ten thousand and
[1:11:03] millions and he's seen the power of God
[1:11:04] moving the things
[1:11:10] come on
[1:11:12] what do you think about ministers that
[1:11:14] have a small group
[1:11:15] and more people have left than have
[1:11:17] stayed
[1:11:20] man
[1:11:27] has educated themselves to the point
[1:11:30] that they've educated themselves away
[1:11:34] from one another
[1:11:35] and they get complexes
[1:11:38] and you don't get no complex by the
[1:11:41] blood
[1:11:42] of Jesus Christ
[1:11:45] you get love
[1:11:48] and that's where that's where you get is
[1:11:50] love not a complex but when you get
[1:11:53] educated and you start thinking I'm a
[1:11:55] little bit bigger than someone else
[1:11:57] and I'm a little bit bigger than other
[1:11:58] than someone else and I know a little
[1:12:01] more than someone else
[1:12:05] I got more Revelation than the next
[1:12:07] preacher
[1:12:09] where's Revelation come from
[1:12:13] amen you like we must make God just
[1:12:17] cry
[1:12:19] God help us amen he said you cannot have
[1:12:22] fellowship with god without coming to
[1:12:24] God's agreement and there's no basic
[1:12:28] there's no and there's a base thing for
[1:12:32] fellowship and that's the blood and
[1:12:33] blood only and that's been God's way
[1:12:36] from the beginning and it will till the
[1:12:38] end the only place of Fellowship is
[1:12:40] through the blood
[1:12:44] and up the paragraph before he said and
[1:12:47] I love fellowship and it comes by love
[1:12:50] and love requires love requires
[1:12:54] Fellowship let me show you an example of
[1:12:57] that that complex that came in and and
[1:13:00] we're doing better than I thank you
[1:13:02] Jesus for my my voice
[1:13:04] amen we're doing better Matthew 21 here
[1:13:06] we'll read a scripture starting at nine
[1:13:09] and you can go to that Amy and the
[1:13:11] multitudes went before and followed and
[1:13:13] cried Hosanna to the son of David and
[1:13:16] blessed be he that cometh in the name of
[1:13:18] the Lord and hosanna in the highest and
[1:13:20] he came into Jerusalem and the city was
[1:13:21] moved saying whom is this and the
[1:13:23] multitude said it is Jesus a prophet
[1:13:26] of Nazareth of Galilee Jesus went to
[1:13:29] temple of God and cast out them the
[1:13:31] bottom sword in the temple and overthrew
[1:13:33] the table the money changers and the
[1:13:35] seats that sold doves
[1:13:38] I always I can't help but saying it but
[1:13:40] remember they were doing Godly things by
[1:13:42] selling these things people needed them
[1:13:44] for sacrifice
[1:13:46] but their emphasis was on the money
[1:13:52] and he said unto them it is rent in my
[1:13:54] house shall be called The House of
[1:13:55] Prayer but you have made it the den of
[1:13:57] Thieves and the blind in the lame came
[1:13:59] to him in the temple
[1:14:02] and they were healed now this is a punch
[1:14:04] line now 15 and the preachers of the day
[1:14:08] the chief priests and the scribes I want
[1:14:12] to emphasize this part
[1:14:14] the second line there saw the wonderful
[1:14:17] things
[1:14:19] that Jesus did
[1:14:23] they saw the wonderful things that Jesus
[1:14:26] did and the children cried in the temple
[1:14:28] saying Hosanna to the son of David
[1:14:32] and the same people
[1:14:35] we're sore displeased
[1:14:41] and he said unto them hear South what
[1:14:44] these say
[1:14:45] and Jesus said unto them
[1:14:49] yea have you never read that out of the
[1:14:51] month mouth of babes and suckling
[1:14:55] he has perfected
[1:14:58] praise Hallelujah
[1:15:01] they had a complex
[1:15:04] because they weren't the center of
[1:15:06] attention
[1:15:07] who cares would
[1:15:11] Christ was present
[1:15:14] are you getting it they wanted to be
[1:15:16] ahead of Christ
[1:15:22] wow God help us amen
[1:15:29] we're going to close here shortly here
[1:15:31] he said in the ballet ditches he said
[1:15:34] that's a matter with churches today he
[1:15:36] said they've got so much selfishness
[1:15:37] everywhere and he didn't he say this at
[1:15:41] the Church of the Living God's got so
[1:15:43] much differences and so much of this
[1:15:45] till they grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:15:49] away from them
[1:15:52] you see and I'll tell you this because I
[1:15:54] I want to be a church that is a
[1:15:57] soul-saving church and outreaching
[1:16:01] amen I know we're at the end times and
[1:16:04] we're gleaning but I want to give you an
[1:16:06] example you know Farmers have become big
[1:16:08] farmers now they've got huge combines
[1:16:10] and 50-foot augers and they normally
[1:16:12] can't hit the grain buggy and and they
[1:16:14] have their kid driving the green buggy
[1:16:15] and we see grains spilled all over the
[1:16:18] place in the roads
[1:16:20] amen and also the trackers they don't
[1:16:24] because they're fat like me they don't
[1:16:25] get in to sweep out the truck and so
[1:16:28] when they dump the truck at the elevator
[1:16:29] there's always four or five pails in
[1:16:31] there and if they get a call
[1:16:34] when they've left the elevator and it's
[1:16:36] different grain then they have to stop
[1:16:38] on the road
[1:16:39] and by force they have to get in sweep
[1:16:41] out the grain
[1:16:44] and all of my family knows this we've
[1:16:46] drove around the roads with pails
[1:16:50] picking up Delaney this year when I was
[1:16:51] taking stuff to the mechanic I was
[1:16:54] driving I was driving one Speck out of
[1:16:55] my way I noticed being so the next time
[1:16:57] I took equipment there I took seven
[1:16:59] pails of meal away without a shovel we
[1:17:02] skipped up seven pails of soybeans just
[1:17:04] dumped on the road
[1:17:06] but they were still beings
[1:17:08] so I understand I didn't get the whole
[1:17:10] being field and I understand spiritually
[1:17:12] speaking that we're in a gleaning age
[1:17:15] but I don't ever spiritually want to
[1:17:16] think that I'm going to drive down the
[1:17:18] road spiritually speaking and see seven
[1:17:20] Souls on the side of the road seven
[1:17:21] pails of beans and say Well they're not
[1:17:23] worth stopping to pick up
[1:17:29] amen
[1:17:32] because they were worth stopping and
[1:17:33] picking up I didn't even I didn't even I
[1:17:36] didn't even have to go to my way
[1:17:38] to pick up them seven Souls because the
[1:17:41] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:17:43] of the Lord he set me by those seven
[1:17:46] Souls
[1:17:47] amen but remember when those seven Souls
[1:17:51] come in they're not going to have the
[1:17:53] Revelation or the understanding or the
[1:17:55] time or anything else
[1:17:59] that you would expect them to have or
[1:18:01] you or me maybe think we have
[1:18:04] or do have
[1:18:08] but see it's not us that makes a new
[1:18:10] believer grow in Christ it's Christ that
[1:18:12] makes a new believer grow in Christ it's
[1:18:15] an anointing it's the oil it's the oil
[1:18:17] the holy spirit it's The Presence of
[1:18:19] Jehovah God where you can help but grow
[1:18:22] in the light of his presence
[1:18:25] you don't have to say
[1:18:28] anything
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:34] oh I understand that you know God has
[1:18:37] times that we say things and I
[1:18:39] understand that ministers will say
[1:18:40] things
[1:18:41] but when God does it
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:45] if somebody is new in the church and
[1:18:48] they come in and you know it's out of
[1:18:50] order but it's the first time you've
[1:18:53] seen them
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:03] just let it go
[1:19:06] if a new person comes in and they're
[1:19:09] talking in the sanctuary and they're not
[1:19:11] being respectful like we've learned in
[1:19:13] church order and Doctrine amen it'll be
[1:19:15] okay
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:22] do you know the prophet when he preached
[1:19:24] in the third world countries before the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost came down I this is amazing
[1:19:30] I've seen this myself but when he
[1:19:32] preached and and you'll know where it
[1:19:34] was the people the ladies had no clothes
[1:19:37] they were topless
[1:19:40] and nothing
[1:19:43] he never preached on dress code and
[1:19:45] brother Dale believes in Holiness oh you
[1:19:47] won't see God without holiness
[1:19:49] but see they got the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:51] Holiness came with it and as soon as
[1:19:53] they got the Holy Ghost they folded
[1:19:54] their arms and left and came back the
[1:19:56] next day with clothes and they hadn't
[1:19:57] preached on holiness
[1:20:01] never even preached unholiness
[1:20:04] but there's a big difference if you've
[1:20:07] been raised in the church and you come
[1:20:09] like that you better look out because
[1:20:10] God will tell me God has a big hammer
[1:20:13] here and when he starts hitting me a few
[1:20:14] times and I see it coming the next time
[1:20:17] I didn't let her fly
[1:20:21] and if that means you're going to go
[1:20:22] home and and stay and say I'm going to
[1:20:25] serve God by myself
[1:20:28] I fear God's Hammer more than I fear
[1:20:30] your complex
[1:20:33] amen
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:41] he said no matter how bad someone ever
[1:20:43] treats you or anything don't never don't
[1:20:46] never be guilty of letting
[1:20:48] the thing anchor in your soul it'll
[1:20:50] grieve
[1:20:52] the Holy Spirit Away
[1:20:55] man for the people that have built a
[1:20:58] complexity man we want to do everything
[1:21:00] we can to get them out of that state
[1:21:03] encourage them and whatever it would
[1:21:05] take but but ultimately it has to be
[1:21:07] their decision to snap out of it
[1:21:10] you can you can greet them and shake
[1:21:13] their hand and but if you get a complex
[1:21:16] because they have a complex and you
[1:21:18] really have troubles
[1:21:21] amen God help us
[1:21:23] we don't want to lose our Holy Ghost
[1:21:26] because of a complex this is my last
[1:21:28] quote is your life worthy of the Gospel
[1:21:30] in 63.
[1:21:35] he said when it takes a place of the
[1:21:36] thing that you do do then he said you'll
[1:21:39] find that the holy spirit will come in
[1:21:41] you
[1:21:42] in the new birth and you'll believe to
[1:21:44] do everything that God says in his word
[1:21:46] is for you to do and everything that the
[1:21:48] Bible quotes for you to do and you're
[1:21:51] you're prostrated before the word of God
[1:21:54] Amen you you punctuate every word with
[1:21:57] Amen to the word of God Amen
[1:22:00] I'm just dropping down and he says
[1:22:10] he says you say I'll speak in tongues or
[1:22:12] you might do that and you might not he
[1:22:13] said I'll show you might do that and you
[1:22:15] might not but there's one thing for sure
[1:22:17] that you'll do you'll bear the fruits of
[1:22:19] the spirit the spirit the fruits of the
[1:22:22] spirit will be now people misconceive
[1:22:24] this and I know there's people listening
[1:22:27] this morning they're going to miss
[1:22:28] conceive this
[1:22:29] let me give you a perfect example of a
[1:22:32] love
[1:22:33] the prophet said that if your kids were
[1:22:35] playing on the road
[1:22:37] and it was a highway
[1:22:40] I'm adding that in
[1:22:41] if it's a road like ours there might
[1:22:43] only be one cargo down the whole day
[1:22:44] it's probably some old man sightseeing
[1:22:46] on the wilkesport road he's 93 and he's
[1:22:49] got all day to get home it wouldn't
[1:22:50] matter if the kids did play in the roads
[1:22:52] he'd want to stop and talk to him
[1:22:56] but he said if you love that kid you'd
[1:22:58] get a switch when you went out to the
[1:23:00] road and you'd whip that kid back to the
[1:23:02] house because he will die
[1:23:05] playing on the road
[1:23:07] but we don't want that kind of love
[1:23:10] because
[1:23:12] you got to switch
[1:23:15] but that's love
[1:23:17] and if you love the child and spare the
[1:23:21] rod
[1:23:22] you actually hate the child
[1:23:24] amen spare the rod and spoil the child
[1:23:27] you hate him
[1:23:29] so let's just get the fruits of the
[1:23:30] spirit in the right order amen so
[1:23:32] spiritually speaking if if a minister is
[1:23:35] standing behind the pulpit and he sees
[1:23:37] you intentionally going to hell and
[1:23:40] knows that you know you're going to hell
[1:23:41] but you need a wake-up call and that
[1:23:43] Minister don't give you the wake-up call
[1:23:45] he actually hates you
[1:23:48] he actually hates you enough to allow
[1:23:53] you to go to hell thinking you're all
[1:23:56] right
[1:23:57] that's the proper type of spirit of love
[1:23:59] the fruits of the spirit are love joy
[1:24:02] peace Faith long-suffering meekness
[1:24:04] gentleness and patience
[1:24:08] your temperance
[1:24:10] will not be
[1:24:12] oh I oh just remember when you got that
[1:24:16] that poisoned the Holy Spirit
[1:24:20] away will move away from you
[1:24:23] your temper will be
[1:24:26] he said if you get the temper you allow
[1:24:28] that to come in the holy spirit will
[1:24:31] move away from you and when you get to
[1:24:33] the place that you want to fuss with
[1:24:35] everybody and come around and do
[1:24:38] something wrong then you get to a place
[1:24:40] where the minister can read the Bible
[1:24:43] and tell you the truth and tell you
[1:24:46] what's wrong and do certain things
[1:24:48] that's wrong
[1:24:51] Now by your fruits you shall know them
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] because a Believer never ever struggles
[1:25:01] with the word of God
[1:25:03] it don't matter how the delivery is
[1:25:06] with the word of God
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:10] If It's Love coming from God
[1:25:13] the whole purpose is to get the child
[1:25:15] off the road
[1:25:18] if the switch don't do it
[1:25:20] then maybe you need
[1:25:23] but remove the child from the road
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:28] and if that offends the child
[1:25:32] does the parent apologize
[1:25:36] of course not
[1:25:38] because the parent loves the child
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:43] God loves us enough
[1:25:46] to give us his Holy Spirit and fivefold
[1:25:48] Ministry that will shake us to recognize
[1:25:52] you know
[1:26:02] God God is amazing
[1:26:05] I never
[1:26:07] had one word about the web
[1:26:11] until God gave it to me when I woke up
[1:26:13] this morning I wrote one word in my note
[1:26:15] that was the web
[1:26:19] you can't get any pressure than that
[1:26:21] from God
[1:26:22] and you think how Satan everything he's
[1:26:24] done
[1:26:25] and there'll be billions billions
[1:26:28] of people in hell
[1:26:30] because of the internet
[1:26:32] web
[1:26:36] is Satan's weapon
[1:26:39] even though our message this morning is
[1:26:41] going to be posted on that
[1:26:45] beware
[1:26:47] it don't make that web holy
[1:26:50] because today's message is posted on it
[1:26:55] amen Let's Dance
[1:26:59] amen
[1:27:03] you know how when the ones came before
[1:27:06] Jesus and Satan came up there and the
[1:27:08] throne in heaven and Satan said what are
[1:27:10] you doing he said going to and through
[1:27:12] through the world
[1:27:14] seeking whom I may
[1:27:18] devour
[1:27:20] by his weapon
[1:27:23] amen this world that we live in
[1:27:27] we are great
[1:27:29] human nature is great adapters
[1:27:33] but Satan has brought everything and
[1:27:36] hell has came up
[1:27:39] and you know I I I it just comes to me
[1:27:41] I'm sorry but this is fresh but I think
[1:27:44] of the minister and brother Brown told
[1:27:45] the story that was a holy Godly Minister
[1:27:48] and he didn't even you know the web
[1:27:51] wasn't around forever you know
[1:27:53] the web wasn't around when me and Luanne
[1:27:55] and were married
[1:27:57] wasn't always that you couldn't live in
[1:27:59] your house without the internet
[1:28:01] it is possible you'll you'll survive you
[1:28:04] can still have kids
[1:28:05] and you know breathe and all those
[1:28:07] things
[1:28:08] I was actually thinking this week of
[1:28:09] actually getting the rid of the web at
[1:28:12] our house
[1:28:14] I just think about that for a second
[1:28:16] because
[1:28:17] I can come to the church
[1:28:19] anytime I need the web
[1:28:22] I can find anything I want radioactive
[1:28:23] Church
[1:28:25] would cost me a penny more
[1:28:27] I have the web on my phone this Minister
[1:28:30] got to heaven and completely inhabited
[1:28:33] brother Brown tells the story and this
[1:28:35] this is just this is how it wasn't but
[1:28:38] but he said in the presence of God
[1:28:41] you think you're a message Billy I think
[1:28:43] I'm a message believer and I think I'm
[1:28:46] okay
[1:28:49] but in his presence
[1:28:52] our righteousness looks like filthy
[1:28:56] rights
[1:28:58] that's the Bible
[1:29:00] brother Dale's nice tie in all this
[1:29:02] looks like filthy dirty rights
[1:29:07] that's powerful
[1:29:09] because I don't I don't see that this
[1:29:11] morning
[1:29:13] but God's that Holy
[1:29:16] and you know the story about the
[1:29:17] minister got there and he said did you
[1:29:18] ever lied he said no no of course I
[1:29:20] never lied I was a minister but he said
[1:29:22] in that presence I remember what the
[1:29:24] things that I just
[1:29:26] you know
[1:29:28] fudged just or didn't tell everything
[1:29:32] or do you ever this just
[1:29:36] and he said I got he said it was just
[1:29:38] the the presence
[1:29:39] said Lord I'm guilty of everything
[1:29:42] but he said before I got there I wasn't
[1:29:44] guilty of any of it
[1:29:45] but it was the presence
[1:29:48] that made me guilty
[1:29:50] amen God help God help me God help me
[1:29:54] amen amen hallelujah
[1:29:57] thank you Lord Jesus
