different ones Amen brother Leo sends greetings brother Pastor Osman barley sends greetings and it won't be much longer and I believe we'll go home I I know I know I've said that 10,000 times but I I truly believe that amen Our Hope certainly ain't in this world or anything about it but God's plac is here to to serve him and love him and it's just a great opportunity you know our Trip's coming up very quickly to El Salvador and we covet your prayers for our trip and and uh any missionary work if somebody we don't we don't emphasize that part of the service I don't feel led to do that but if anybody ever feels to give to missions or parts the church gives much to missions and so that's what I was doing in the office Vicki if you can pull up some pictures I want to show um we'll start at the bottom of my messenger and um so we sent some money to Pastor Abraham Myra in yuganda for his church that's that's your money that's God's money you know brother Brown said anytime you do missionary work he said things like this he said anytime you go to another country for God you're in his will I mean anytime you save souls or are out to minister to save Souls that's our commission is go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs will follow them that believe and sister Sharon's brother is a part just one part of these signs I met her brother amazing brother and you know when we started to pray for him and Wednesday prayer meeting they were planning on taking his gallbladder or right is that right out and he was going to have a bag on his side now there's a happy manad the bladder I'm sorry sorry okay forgive me amen amen God is still God God is still real he's a miracle working God Amen and that's just tremendous so so we have unless they're not we're good so we start at the bottom or start at the last one so uh uh brother Pastor Abraham sent us some pictures of the and we're just sharing what the church does um and we have another brother from the Philippines that we uh so this is oh this is a Philippines so that's fine that's fine so this is a church that we helped build 10 years ago when we were still in the house this is Pastor longdong from menel it's the island where there's the most Muslims the southern part of island of the Philippines and if few on that picture it's been at least 10 years they've never had the money to fill in the Gable or the window go back to the other one I don't know what that is the window on the side and the Gable is left just like when we quit sending money I pray preached for that brother when I preached for him he had a straw roof he had bamboo post holding it up and it was dirt and they put a bamboo fence around the church to keep the pigs and the Ducks out while we preached and the piece of sement was around the pulpit was about 5 by5 where the pastor spun his feet so the dust didn't pick up I baptized a bunch of people there and dedicated two or three baby so if we go to another picture picky um no no the other way that's the pastor that's Pastor Longo and okay so we can go the other way back where you were Amy okay this is Pastor that so now we moved to Africa um we sent so uh I believe and I I'm I would be corrected if I if I needed to be um I believe he had I believe the church building that you see inside there will hold about 700 people and I believe they had around 3 to 400 sitting under tents outside it's in Uganda Africa so you can uh different angles there I have videos anybody that's uh loves to see that stuff and I have a terrible picture of them but the last picture is a picture of oh no I couldn't even find one what's up wouldn't let me take his picture but if you want to see a picture of Pastor Abraham he's of course he's online too and amen so God is good and and uh we praise him for the opportunity to serve him also thank vict for for helping me I I got some new uh new a new iPad and switching over my other iPad was glitching and and the battery quit working and helped me switch it and Vanessa came to the church yesterday and uh took every light down took the flights out of them brushed the dust off the building cleaned the church and we thank her for that also me and brother Carson put some miles on the car we were able to take the pastor that was here on Sunday we took him Tuesday to nagger Falls and brother Carson was an he he he he was he knew that back he was going down streets around neger Falls I said how do you know where you're going he said I just know I would have been really uptight but we had a amazing day at ner Falls it was 25 Dees and just amazing went to the Mandarin with her brother and then brother Carson also took us to uh Paul of place on Wednesday and they were very very hugely kind and took us to a rib restaurant and bought our motel room to stay there and and we had wonderful fellowship and they have a beautiful church and beautiful Believers amen we praise God for that so it's good to have friends and the family of God Amen and just uh also me and my wife will be going to the ministers meeting over there in Ohio um this Friday and also John Dana has uh meetings in tonell this weekend for anybody that that works for us amen let's stand and we'll just uh turn to God's word amen let's go to Genesis 292 and uh I uh I uh I promise you I mean unless God uh uh really whoops me we're going to change complete topics next Sunday I want to preach on slavery next Sunday and uh something I've been working on for weeks and weeks and uh when God uh laid this on my heart I told God I said I've already preached this message from every angle you can think of and uh God basically said that's okay we're going to swing again amen I went back in my my message and I I had to even go back in my iPad I said see God I preached this in the summertime I said but that that didn't work either so God knows God knows what he's doing amen so Genesis 39 I can't see my number 30 39 and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw now I want you to catch this this is a pagan person and the Pagan person saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord made all that he the Pagan person did or sorry that Joseph did Prosper but we're going to get to the other part and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him the overseer of his house and all that he made all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass at the time that he made him overseer of his house and over that he had made him that the Lord that's the part I wanted to get you that the Lord blessed the Pagan now that's that's far out that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake now you could work for a pagan and God will bless the pagans bank account for you man when you get a hold of that one Hallelujah and the blessings of the Lord was upon all that he made in the had in the house and in the field and he his master now he talking about this Pagan again his master left all that he had to Joseph would we trust each other that way on would I leave all that I had in your hands or would you leave all you have in your hands this was our Pagan King and Joseph was our slave he left all that he had into Joseph's hand and he knew not how much he had save the bread that he ate and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless your word and bless your thoughts this morning and may we be able to comprehend you Lord Jesus as you Minister your word and we give you the glory for it in your name amen you may have your seats and I just want to read another scripture just to Philippians 2 12 Philippians 2:12 and I'm just going to start because I got a lot of hay to go through if you'll forgive me Philippians 2:12 to15 therefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling I want to preach on that this morning God wants to preach on that for it is God which worketh in you both that's now every word in the word is there for a purpose so in the family of God you're working out your own salvation with fear but in the other part of the family God's also working out their salvation but it's not your business and you both to Will and to do the good pleasure and to do all things without trying to save the other person murmuring or disputing that ye may be blameless and harmless and the sons of God now there's that family without rebuke in the midst of a cired and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights amen thank you Lord Jesus me just find my text here you know we want to minister this morning and God gave me this thought on the the family and the family of God and and if you'll forgive me I'm just going to shoot kind of from the hip but we we know that the quotes where our Prophet showed us that God was Elohim when he when he was a self-existing one one and when he spoke us and his eternal thoughts and he spoke his family then he no more was self-existing but he was dwelt with his family and if now our Prophet clearly and praise God for for this type our Prophet always preached all his messages typ in the natural and the spiritual and now if you compare the family and anybody's family and just think of your own family amen it is never the the father that has an individual problem differently with his children the father will always have a very good handle on how his children are unique and and and and and and uh you know uh he's he's not worried about his children being different and unique and and uh I'm trying to find the right word but peculiar but the children walk always have a problem with the other child that don't fix the mold it will never be the father that comes and says you're the black sheep of the family it'll be the other it'll be amongst the children that'll say there's the Black Sheep amen and so is it in the family of God and God just dumped a truckload of that on top of my head and it just was like unbelievable how the the word unfolded but God's not concerned about losing any that's in his hand but we sit amongst one another and we say well this shouldn't be and that shouldn't be and all and all me and my and all there that and that and and and the Bible says that we shouldn't be doing this it says that we shouldn't be disputing and and we should be harmless and stuffs and and we got to trust Jehovah to be Jehovah that he'll supply all our needs even the other children's needs amen amen that ain't to say that I understand and I believe with all of my heart and believe me if you knew how I was raised you would you would understand I believe that you know them by their fruits if you are something you can't produce something that you're not I understand that perfectly and I'm trying to find my notes here where I'm at but I want to show you something and I want to tell you something that you got to get in your own mind we're still here I want to say that again we're still here and it ain't God's fault it's brother Dale's fault and you can make that just as personal as you can humble yourself to make that but it's not the father's fault that we're still here but we're disputing among once another and we need to shut up and back up and let God be the father amen and and that's that's not to say we're not promoting sin I'm not talking about letting the bars down and letting the goats in or backing up from the scriptures and the word of God and the law of God I'm not saying that at all I'm saying it ain't your business I'm saying it ain't your business it's God's business amen I'm saying don't you compromise One spec if you think that you should wear a long sleeve shirt to your risk you wear a long sleeve shirt to your risk if you think you should wear a tie on Sunday morning you wear a tie on Sunday morning it we know the word says that women will have long hair it's their Glory God give us this glory and and we're going to get into some of that how God gave Jesus said to the father he said all the glory that God gave Jesus he poured into his bride and and it's so beautiful to recognize the the the minister Wednesday night mentioned that that and here Jesus said to the women he said your hair is your glory and it it's it's submission to the church thinks spiritual amen we're supposed to be the most glorious thing that ever was created and it's not our Glory it's God's glory he gave the bride his wife all this glory and he taked it in the natural for a sister having long hair it was her glory but in the spiritual it was Jehovah he just P all that was in God he poured into Christ all the glory that went into Christ he poured into his wife amen and I want to show you an Old Testament story here and we'll get into our notes but we want to look at Jacob in the Bible and I'm going to paraphrase this into Genesis 37 is is the main part of the chapter and I'm going to hit some different verses but I want to show you every single example now now when we back up we know that Joseph was one of the younger children and Joseph was a perfect type of Christ that's right the Bible only records one flaw that he had one little mistake it was still a mistake but other than not he it would have been like he was Christ I'm going to show you every scripture in this Old Testament that it was never once that the father had trouble with any of his sons it was always the sons and daughters that had trouble with the sons and daughters God don't have trouble with none of the bride of Christ around the world no matter where they've chose to be their home Church no matter where they're serving him no matter what God ain't having no trouble with none of them but in amongst the brothers and sisters we are we are and it's because we're not obeying the scripture that's maybe maybe we could go back to let's just let's just lay a foundation here this is God forgive us he watch how here in Philippians 2 it says that you may be blameless work out your own salvation with fear and trembling that you may be blameless and harmless and harmless just let that sink in for a minute just think of your history in the message church I don't want to think of my history God covered it with the blood harmless sons of God Sons of God okay watch without rebuke that means leave it to God with prayer in the midst of a cared and per well we we're there we've arrived and perverse Nation among whom ye sign as lights of the world I wonder if we're shining as bright as we could and now you know you know all the scriptures and I can't cover everything on one Sunday but you see what I mean here now now I'm going to get to it I'm going to clarify now we're not lowering the goats I'm not talking about just I mean we could fill this place up if we didn't believe in nothing no no I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about that and we we'll we'll separate that let's just look into this family here in Genesis 37:2 it said these generations of Jacob Joseph being the 17th they believed in having kids so being 17 years old sorry was feeding the flocks with his Brethren and Joseph brought an evil report uh-oh there you go wasn't the father that brought an evil report it was the son of another son well bless God they shouldn't do that you you you you've heard all those we don't have to go into that now verse four and his Brethren saw that the father loved him more than all the other Brethren now now there the father was there's a reason why he did it was because of his old age and they hated him and could not speak peaceably onto him now watch this now you say well bless God that don't happen many many times in the bride of Christ if God does anything in somebody's life if God other people would be jealous of it if if uh we be jealous that somebody plays the piano better than me I can't play it all I'm somebody speaks in tongues well everybody wants to be by him because he spoke tongues if if uh they preach like an angel well I wish I could Minister just like them I wished I could too but I'd be a clown if I did yeah that's what the prophet said you see what I mean we're because we think that Jesus as soon as Jesus blessed somebody in the body all the other brothers and sisters will go why it wasn't me well it wasn't me how come he didn't use me I've been in the church longer than they were yeah bless God I I live you know bless God I I I and Joseph Dream here's where the problem goes God started using them and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brother oh he shouldn't have done that that was a mistake and they hated him bless God don't ever tell somebody you're called to the ministry if your brother cuz everybody here will hate you well bless God who do you think you are why I knew I knew you I like we're not born of fornication why we knew father [Music] Moses wow you're always a Target if you do something for God but why does Satan get the ability to work through the brother Brothers on and the sisters ouch ouch I've wore that t-shirt in the past and I got whooped for it amen J I need water sorry Hallelujah and they hated him yet the more I don't have a cup or nothing I'm I'm homeless and they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and even his father rebuked him now that wouldn't happen of our heavenly father we know that and he said unto him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come and bow down thyself to thee to the Earth see you know brother Brown said and and now this is a bad type here say our heavenly father would have never done that on a spiritual basis but brother Brown said that the hardest thing God ever did watch this I want to show you example if any person stood up here and prophesied half the people wouldn't believe it it wasn't me if somebody else got up and I don't care who it was could be the could be anybody and spoke in tongues and somebody else interpret said I don't believe it cuz it wasn't the people I thought it should be brother Braham said the hardest thing God ever did was to get somebody to believe that he'd use somebody else to do his glory well I didn't get I I I I would have picked I would have picked Junior instead of jarid or I would have but God never asked us amen and his Brethren now we get back on track here in verse 11 and his Brethren envied him just think spiritual just think spiritual you know the only way they could envy him is if they were in a competition but if anybody's building a kingdom of their own is going to fall down cuz every kingdom is going to fall down okay we might like some people's kingdom but they're all going to crumble except God's his word alone will last for eternity and they have on him but his father now here we get back on track but the heavenly father he just looked out over his kids W were my family ever different amen now I got six kids and they as far as the East is from the West how in the world is that possible well you know it might be because God is a god of variety but we're not but we're not because I'm me and I like me and I have to love me and so I'm not a god of righty but God is Elohim and it was impossible for God to put all of himself in me me or in you so he had to make a flower garden and make it beautiful but we don't like the garden I'd never do it like that I fire that landscaper but this is God Amen and the Brethren envied him but the father observed the saying verse 14 and he said to him go ye I pray thee and see whether it is well with thy Brethren now here's God sending out his Brethren to to to to take to look check on the family there's nothing wrong with that is there of course not and well with the flocks and he bring me a word again so he sent them out to Horeb and he came to these PE this town here let's jump to verse 18 and when they saw him AAR off now remember this wasn't the father and when his family his brothers and sisters now it talks about brothers here but in the end of the chapter it talks about sisters also they saw him a far off and be Fame he came near to them they started talking behind his back and they started conspiracizing against him to kill his character and they said one to another behold this wild Minister cometh and he cometh down before us let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we'll say that some evil beasts and one of his brothers that was the Deacon stopped up and said whoa no no no we can't we can't have innocent blood verse 22 how do you say that brother's name H Ru reuben reuben it said unto them shed no blood but cast them into the pit for in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he we might be rid of him out of our hands and deliver him to his father again and it came to pass that Joseph came unto his Brethren and they stripped Joseph's foot of his coat and many colors that was upon him in verse 24 and they took him and they cast him into the pit and the pit was empty and there was no water in it verse 26 Judah said unto the Brethren what profited us if we play this brother let's sell him for some money money is a great thing unless you worship it and conceal his blood and come let us sell him to these people that are coming by these way pasts and let not our hand be upon him they were justifying that they were going to sell him and put into slavery and they were saying now we're more Christian because we actually didn't kill them yeah wow we just like no think spiritual now amen let's just jump to 31 I'm going to jump here some you know the story and they took Joseph's coat and see insinuating the LIE is the same as a lie and they insist insuated that he had been killed with the they killed goats and they put his blood on it and they insinuated to Jacob they ran and he rent his clothes and sasos and his laurs and he mourned for his sons for days and all now now watch this verse 35 this is where I want you get and all Jacob's sons and all his daughters we're in on it because they rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said unto them for I will go down into the grave unto my son still mourning and thus the father wept that's why we're still here and why God's still weeping you see if we had found the last seed we're going going home and I I I have a a many many things here but you know like I said we're not talking about letting you you don't gain Nothing by letting sin in the church you don't let nothing you don't gain Nothing by becoming a sinner and think you're serving God that that don't happen that's not serving God okay so we're not talking about that we're not we're not like not preaching the word of God so everybody will come to our church and just play basketball and have a ball team and we can play all the other churches and I'm not talking about that but if your brother Falls and stumbles it's not your business other than prayer it's not your business at all because they will stumble and fall amen see we're not here to let the bars down and let the goats in but there's goats and we're not here to judge them cuz how can you tell the goat oh I know I know I know you're going to stick to that scripture by your fruits you'll know them but just hang on here for a minute just hang with me he said you know and the the statue of the perfect man and that just happens to be a uh in the word of God in our Prophet Minister that kindness is under brotherly love and it will take kindness and Revelation for anybody to find the last predestinated seed let me repeat that we haven't found the last predestinated seed because we haven't showed kindness and Revelation to find the last predestinated seed see you have to watch this now watch this I this lines up beautifully by your fruits you will know them but the last predestinated seed that ain't come in don't have no fruits of Christianity they're still living in Sin Sin n so we can judge them all we want and we'll never have a Rapture because it will take kindness and understanding to share the Revelation to him because the Bible says that a soul offended is harder to win back than a walled City so go ahead you can be right but don't plan on a Rapture your grandkids won't go in the Rapture you would hold the door at a grocery store for a total stranger that's may be in a bad community but you'd go out an opposite door at church because you don't want to speak to oh ouch watch this I'm going to say something here and it's going to hurt just a little bit the prophet said that and I'm going to read a whole thing of rap before he died where he explained it all of so we're still here because we enjoy living under the law let me rephrase that we're still here because we enjoy living under law now now I want to just clarify something here if you want law you got the right Pastor because I never went out to eat on Sunday I never bought gas on Sunday I never rode a bike on Sunday I never played catch with the ball on Sunday we went to church twice on Sunday had an afternoon nap and we basically never warmed our food because we reverence the Sabbath day so much so if you want law like praise God I know all about law and our Prophet said that when Christ came the Jews loved the sacrifice of lambs and goats better that would not take away their sin sins and they rejected Christ the perfect sacrifice because they loved the law whoa I'm like you got to be kidding they love the law now don't go into the cornfield until you wash your hands three times and don't pick the cob on Sunday because you'll get killed because it's Sunday and and so you just fast today because if you didn't pick it on do you know I want to just show you something about you want to be legalistic when my dad fed cattle we pitched the inlets down under of the Salo us Sons us boys and we never ever pitched it down on Sunday we Saturday night we pitched down extra for Sunday and fed the cattle on Saturday night so we didn't feed them on Sunday you want legalistic come on right over to my Camp I'll tell you all about it oh yeah my dad would almost let the cattle go hungry before he would start an engine of a tractor on the Sabbath because he felt he was killing God I can also remember when we came into the message this fantastic truth in Wallaceburg Church and the first family that invited us out for Sunday dinner and that was am miracle and itself they loved us tremendously because we had a whole herd of kids and when we were coming into their home they stopped in town and went in to buy some food and we almost left the message at that time but there's no way a Believer buys something on Sunday Jewish law Matthew 161 171 18 and Jesus answered unto them blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood the fivefold ministry never even it was the spirit on the five for Ministry the Evangelist never for Flesh and Blood never revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I and he said unto thee that thou Peter and Upon This Rock now what did I say I said it would take kindness and Revelation it won't take brother Ben norrod coming to preach it won't take and like he would be number one evangelist in my thoughts but it'll take kindness and Revelation for the last predestinated seed to be saved now see so this is how we have to understand this scenario if you as you're not if you are a Believer and you're living in sin then you're not a Believer so when when you say you've let the goats down and let all the bars in let's look at it like this brother Brown said the church is a hospital this place should be right full of goats I don't mean we're condoning to them goats but they come for they come for an IV called Revelation they came for an IV of kindness brother Brown said you remember this one he said the world's Dying For Love they're dying for real love compassion I'm suffering I'm homeless I'm I I can't pay my rent I can't gas up the car I'll just tell you what the economy is tight my wife was bringing me up to reality yesterday and it was quite a jar said I grew too much hate enough soybeans and spent too much money on the church amen see Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against it see how what God has shown us is the father any one of you brother M you're not worried about any one of your three different kids Jared you're not you got be like you realize your kids brother Bernard you're not you realize your boy and your girl they're they're children you you don't expect them to be well yours are almost Angels but you know what I mean like no child will make mistakes if you like if you like a molasses cookie your mom and dad might told you not to take a molasses cookie but if you like a nice Amy molasses cookie as much as I do you might consider going to hell for that cookie if you're a child we just understand that but the children don't that's why they go daddy daddy Isaiah took a cookie daddy daddy you you made me do it wasn't the father that said it wasn't the father that said it it was their brothers that's right and their sisters when our kids used to come to me it was never I did it she made me like I believe that Doctrine came from the garden yeah yeah amen he made me do it she made me you caught me but I wasn't me I was getting it for them meanwhile there's crumbs falling out of their mouth amen see how it is so when the goats come in Among Us brother Brown said the inner core of this group you know who you are you don't have to have a good preacher tell you God told you this morning who you are you're part of him you came for him for the foundation of the world you you know you're a Believer you're not saved because I tell you you're saved you're saved because God told you you're saved amen and so the core of the group hold together and support one another in the center of the word of God and the goats are around us and they're looking at our life and they go whoa nobody said anything about sisters having long hair but I feel like mine's really short and nobody had to go reker you know you're covered I don't want you to see anything amen and and I don't need to have spandex pants I mean my goodness woo when me and brother Carson were gone a couple days wow elasticity has become very valuable just glued but going in amen Jesus told him he said I father I pray thee that you would leave them in the world this is our ke sker but we're not going to become a goat but we have no right to judge the goats cuz some are born to damnation and some are the Jezebel on the wall that haven't received the light yet amen and Believe Me Brother Dale wants to get off this subject we got to move on and just we you you think think I never study my dad used to say this now I I can only tell you what I know you know in quiet days and all the work was done we used to go crop turn now in high school they went crop turn CU they were going drinking I'm not talking about that we just go crop turn and normally my dad would take us over to walpool island or some place where he combined corn when it was minus 50° and mom wouldn't go cuz she was afraid of going to wpo Island and stuff like that and and we' go crop turn and my daddy would say this and this would be a good Logic for our church he'd look at something he'd look at you brother Junior and he goes he'd say many men have many Minds just leave it there he say like there' be somebody building something in the wrong place or planting crop or they were in the field like this would be a good one they were in the field and it was too wet he's like oh he don't know what he's doing he said many men has many minds and he just left it like that if you want to be a goat we can all eat hay together but I'm a sheep I'm producing wool come on right up to the manger get a little bit of wool if you get the right hay you you might start your hair might start falling out and it might start getting oily and there might wo start coming amen so you know the amazing thing is we don't have to rebuke somebody to stay on the the word because we only oursel individually have to stay on the word now now you as Believers have the right and the opportunity and the the free choice brother Brown said you should choose a home church that is on the word and you choose a home church that you feel comfortable with and you choose a whole church that the pastor ain't a hypocrite and you choose a home Church where he's not a wolf in cheap [Applause] clothing I'm not saying to to the church where the the pastor is either a liar or a hypocrite you have that right to choose that's right but you don't have to tell me about it but you don't have to tell your brother and sister about it cuz brother Brown said if somebody else chooses another home Church don't disfellowship with them just love them and come into one big circle and say praise God I love going to Wyoming but if you go somewhere else you go to Paula Paula Fontaine has people right from a town not very far from here going to his church praise God paon is my friend amen if you go to the Baptist Church outside of town or any other church you can think of that you knows even off the word say praise God I'll be your friend and I pray that God will give you a revelation I'm not there you know brother Brown said if you know I encourage you go visit every Church in the world go travel and if you get a seed you don't have to eat the seed just spit it out and just say you you don't have that's not your home church now if you were spitting a lot of seeds out in your home Church you might want to pray about that one but if you go out amongst you know none of you are going to catch leprosy even if you went to the Baptist Church one Sunday praise God when you come back here the next Sunday you'd be like that's right for all God shown me I'm not afraid of you going there you go wherever you want if I if I didn't trust you I didn't trust God I didn't trust the Holy Ghost amen I trust the holy ghost man go wherever you want I like I go to my brother at the Holiness Church I'll go there for Revival and I'm their friend they asked me to pray the last time I was there can you believe that I'm not a trinitarian amen God God's got to get his family at peace we got to have peace I mean the world's looking for world peace and that's never going to happen but it's got to happen in the bride of Christ that's going in a Rapture amen we are never going to agree on everything you say how can that be listen your mommy and daddy was different than my mommy and daddy [Applause] hello that's that's it right there the only reason that you could could uh whatever is if if I send something that you can't find in the Bible or in the Mage and you go you have that right you won't have to tell nobody the Holy Ghost inside of you will tell you that because water and oil don't mix it'll just roll right up on the top and he like oh I got to leak this watch till the water goes on the bottom it'll I got to drain this off amen Hallelujah let every man alone amen I'm sorry I got to I got to hurry up or I'm going to oh my oh this clock's wrong um here watch this watch I want to I want to I'm going to go through some quotes really fast and then we actually have a couple on there Amy I want to pull up Satan tell tries to tell us that's something that they don't get but I know that you do see the church has failed because they got to a place now watch this now I'm actually reading a quot and every if you if I ever say anything to anybody that you question I'll I'll send it to you I'll send it to you by taex by WhatsApp by Facebook I'll print it off and give it to you today tomorrow or next week he said because we got to the place that if you're not like this church you're not in and if you're not like now he names the church but can I can I just reframe from that and if you're not like this church well then you're not in and if you don't belong to this church well then you're not in either but if you don't belong to the Oneness well you're not in and if you don't belong to the this or that you don't belong in and the church has failed see instead of bringing people together oh I got some Bible for this instead of bringing people together in one body it separated them them it separated them brother Dale's not afraid of the goats coming I say bring them on bring on all the goats don't say nothing I won't say nothing to them either I will avoid dealing with it you know how A God Called Ministry tries to do something he tries not to follow the word and God just goes oh no you don't get back over here you were trying to avoid that subject I'm like okay God are you sure you know what you're doing God can you believe God listening to some Minister like are you sure you know what you're doing God God's up there oh boys that's like you telling your 2-year-old kid not to walk out in front of 401 are you sure you know what you're doing dad you know we were having a kid riding with us not that long ago and they lived in our house down the road and we were telling them to put on their seat Bel now that would be a positive thing besides that it's a law of the land and you know what the kid told us he said me be careful when I go out through the window now I I want to tell you how would a kid be careful going out through the front window brother Matt me be careful you see that's like we telling God be careful God don't Don't Preach too hard those goats will leave and God's like oh just shut up and put your seat Bel on just put your seat butt on here comes the word here's another one you know if you're a born again Christian you'll forget your differences and come together as Christians ought to and you and and we will we can do something our King will come to us Jesus Christ now how can we be unified if we have differences just forget them just say many men has many Minds for me I can't do that in my house do you know we we watched them the minister on and he was mentioning about Christmas and he said I do something for Christmas but you have to get your own Revelation for Christmas what does God want for your family I'll preach what the word is I'd have to preach both sides of it I'll preach what the Bible says I might be more one-sided but God will deal with you see a minister just throws out the net yes and if there's goats in it I don't get upset I say praise God maybe the goat grow will you know now they got sheep that grow hair and you don't have to shave them they're in the modern Church you see you know what I mean like God's omnipotent you don't have to worry about God you don't you don't like you just have to put your seat belt on and we tell God are you sure you want me to preach that God I'll be careful when I go through the window shield amen if there's anything that I believe in that would be to start a Revival in Los Angeles it would be it would be a time that we could all break down our differences and barriers and come together as Christians in love that's the Pentecostal Baptist and Presbyterians and allog together and we could experience a world that we would have love one for the other now they would be as different as the night is from the day and our Prophet wasn't any of the three above amen watch this in Hebrews he says let us consider one another and provoke unto love Hebrews 10:24 and 25 you can pull that up provoke unto love and good works I'm trying to hurry so I don't preach on this the rest of my life not forsaking the assembling of yourself together now you know the reason we don't get together is because we're worried about what the other person's doing it don't matter if your brother's here or your sister's here or not here it's it's it's on them it go it all goes back to they have to work out their own salvation God has to give them a revelation of attending church if they think they can sit on the coach and watch a video well we know it's on scriptural but that's between them and God maybe they like going to hell I know that shocked you brother Bown said if you go to hell you will pass every deter sign and fight your way to get there and how will be full of people fighting to get there does brother Dale understand that oh Bud hey you got to be kidding not even close amen some of yourself exhorting one another exhorting one another not judging one another another I'm going to get to the judging part I got even some Bible for it you it's it's amazing what the Bible says exhorting one another and so much more as you see the time approaching you know what if you believe that we're going in a Rapture soon you wouldn't miss much church and it's not even you know what it's not even Church you know what you know what I want to tell you something I I have the T-shirt I have the right to minister this I was born in a family of eight people and when eight people get married and bring in in-laws it's crazy it's insanity and then all of them had five kids a piece and we went to Mom and Dad's oh oh Lord you had to pray and fast before you had hello it wasn't the mom and dad that had a problem Oh I don't my mom can you you had eight different in-law mothers W I mean they talk about having one mother-in-law but bring eight different in-law mother-in-laws apart oh my Lord goodness do you see what I mean and that's exactly what's happened in the church we're we're we're A peculiar people we've come from my goodness if it wasn't God I wouldn't even live in Canada amen we got every nationality I if I had the choice I'd be a missionary if you want to see God move you go to the mission field cuz America's cold as ice amen all God's here but we're that's that's Bible bless God we're rich we're rich and we have credit cards amen you got to watch this so here now if you forgive me my this clock is doing things to me here here brother Brown talks about him being away and his girls coming home now can I paraphrase this quote you've all heard this a 100 times and he talks about the old girl they they wanted to say up till brother Brown got home and they had to go to sleep their mother made him go to sleep and they went to sleep and the oldest one woke up and they said dad'll be here and she could run faster because she had been in the church longer and she knew all the quotes and the Bible scriptures and she ran out to the prophet and jumped on his leg but the other one was pass hand me down pajamas and she was tripping and running to everything in the house was there a problem with the daddy was there a problem with the two girls and the one girl got up and the one daughter got up and he said well little pipsqueak you're too little you don't have the revelation of the Seven Seals you haven't heard the Thunders preach yet and there ain't no room for God's Kingdom for you because I've been sitting on this PE bless God for 1929 but the Bible says that the ones that come in last will get the same portion as the ones that come in first you know the ones that get saved when I'm right ready to take flight and you say I never believed they be there they're wow they start coming up behind us they're going to get the same reward you're going to get amen and here it's the father Daddy and he's sitting there and the one girl's got all of daddy she's got she I have all of daddy but God's always got room for another one and he gets her eye goes that's how you bet at an oxgen you don't want nobody to know you're beted you just and he moved his leg out and she was too short too inexperienced too young I mean what word do you want to use childless yeah and she couldn't even get up and she came close and did a hop and Gody daddy grabbed her and he grabbed onto her cuz she would have backslid if he had enough hello hello help me preach she would have fell off she would have left the word and she pre andone like that and she said I'd like to tell you something sister you might have all of God but God's got all of me amen God's got all of me I would back slide if it wasn't for God I would be a terrible person if it wasn't for Mercy I would be horrible if it wasn't for Amazing Grace predestination the thoughts of God i' be a terrible I'd be a drunk or a oh my I'd be worse than the woman at the well but he got all of me he got all of me I was running from God Amen Hallelujah John 17 910 oh praise God now he tells that story dozens of times amen you see who had the problem it was the sisters in that case that we're fighting it wasn't father God father God loved both of them equally father God did whatever it took he didn't father God didn't have to grab the older one the older one had more ability father God he had everything under control did that mean he loved the little one one more not one back not one back father God had everything under control and they were both going to be there but they were still we have to stop do doing this we have to stop doing this I'm never going to be you and you are never going to be me so just let it go just let it go if you don't un if you think I've even backslid the greatest thing you could do for me is say God kill that fat person give us a different preacher amen here God said I pray for them and I pray not for the world but I pray for them which thou Hast given me now that makes them a family man but we don't know which ones in the world aren't still his so God ain't praying for the god ain't praying for the the ones that are born to to to to uh to damnation but there's ones that are headed to damnation that are predestinated to eternal life and you'd better not be judging them or you're judging God Amen for all that you've given me the family for they are mine even though they don't look like it yet now I'm not condoning backsliding or or not coming to God late I'm not condoning that I'm just saying this is part of his plan for all are mine are thine and thine are mine and I glorify I am glorified in them and neither I pray thee alone verse 20 neither I pray thee alone for those alone but for those also which now there's a key part here this is Bible which which shall that means they haven't yet oh bless God they're not living right of course they're not living right because they haven't believed yet but they shall that that's that's King James version well bless God I have a child that ain't right but he shall and if he and if you don't believe the shell well then you might as well just backside yourself because you don't even believe your own conversion I watch this watch how the shell works if you believe that your child shall be there it's like I shall be in heaven period it's not I hope I'm there no I'm a way P pass I shall be there it's predestinated it's a revelation amen and I pray but I pray offers to them which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as I as thy the father are in me and I in thee and they also may be one in us and the world may believe that thou Hast sent me and the glory which I Gest me I gave unto them so the glory that God gave to Christ Jesus he passed right on to his wife and that's a type of you have the sisters having long hair it's the the Bea it's the the Fantastic Revelation passed on thank you Lord hallelujah given them and they may be one I lost my place and verse 23 and I in them and thou and me and they may be made perfect in one that's not by judging nobody gets perfect because they do it exactly how brother Dale thinks it's got to be done no no no God's a lot bigger than brother Dale yeah amen perfect in one and that they would that the world may know that thou has sent me and H has loved them as thou has loved me Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 11 I'm trying to go fast 1 Corinthians 11:8 1 Corinthians 11:8 for the man watch this and and and and we're just touching on this we could I could preach Forever on this for the man is not of the woman now that now this is talking physical now just wait a minute now God chose to have a wife God chose to put you on Earth God was first oh I know you were a part of him the man God didn't come from me you getting the picture the man is not of a woman God didn't come for me oh bless God you just got to line right up I got the whole book of dos and don'ts you know I'm going to get a sign to put on the ramp or the sign and it's the one that brother Brown said you know he say we have no Creeds but no Creeds but love no membership but fellowship and no book but the Bible and no uh yeah no Creeds but Christ no book but the Bible no membership but fellowship and something but love you see it's all Christ amen so we sometimes and we're we're built like that because we're amateur Gods but sometimes we we we make a mistake and we think we're Jehovah and we're like we speak people out of existence brother Berard just gone you just evaporate that's not Christ that's not that's the devil see the woman is not of The Men We God we came from God God did oh bless God I I'm just remember where you came from you came from God not God coming out of you that's right amen and but the woman is of the man so we came from our heavenly father now that shouldn't mean we're going to act like him neither was the Man created for the woman God wasn't created for you to be born God was there first do you see but the woman for the man were created to worship God God made us to worship Him adore him and of course obey him but that's part of adoring you don't have to you don't have to have law when somebody's adoring somebody and for this C all a mother to woman to leave have or sorry for and for this cause ought a woman to have power on her head because of the Angels God isn't from us but we're from God and we were created by God not great God created for us God was always ver and here we go verse 15 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory that God gave her for her hair is a covering you know we we can only approach god with humility brother Brown said if you want anything from God it's your approach your approach humility amen God help us God help us I want to just skip something here and oh maybe not we're we're doing is that we doing all right I'm sorry I'll preach half as long next week you please wellow you you know people that don't have nothing to preach they can preach a short message I could make this three messages I wouldn't have to study for a month but when God gives it to you I don't have to study I just have to find it it's just like I said wait God I got to find it I'll forget here brother brand and questions answer I'm going to prayer phrase some of this now like I'm trying to be balanced I'm trying to be balanced I'm not compromising I don't believe with watch this without Holiness no man shall see God that's right okay so that's the full word of God but there's a part here that's been sidestepped and God's trying to get his brothers and sisters to not fight the problem ain't with God it's with the brothers and with the sisters and I'm roasting but here here in questions and answers some people came and asked brother brandham if if people that well let me just read it is that all right 1 Corinthians 14 34 and 35 he said let a woman be silent in the churches and they're not permitted so they're they're asking it's shameful for a woman to do anything do you know I I do you know we're funny creatures why do we got to beat somebody down to raise oursel up you want to help me get my coat off CU I got a string around my neck uh and don't rip my cord of uh and here they're trying to say you sisters you'd better not say Amen you're kidding me we probably wouldn't have have any amens if the sisters never said amen once in Now You sisters don't you dare prophesy cuz we're male that's not God there is one thing placing that a sister was out a sister can you know I I'm I'm telling you this is this is a fresh I have un unfriended and blocked people that had sisters sing a special behind this Pulpit are you kidding we could bring up a donkey and sing a special behind this Pulpit the Bible said that if the Rocks would cry out let's move the ppet to the parking lot who can't serve god well the kids are too young to sing who cares well they might make a mistake praise God I'll feel more comfortable you see right that's not God's Church a woman can worship praise God get blessed run the aisles prophesy speak in tongues worship sing a special preach to her children Oh I thought you thought I was going to get you there preach to the sisters the older sisters guide and help the younger sisters tell them how to love their husbands and keep a house clean drive the car slow when the husband ain't there cuz he might not have enough money to buy the next one and when he's a loggerhead don't say nothing cuz it'll lower his Eagle I know you sisters do that all the time L man just he's oh he's going off on that road again bless God he'll come back when he falls off the cliff amen bless God I'll be squealing amen you sisters have an amazing gift I I just I just think something in my mouth opens like you went shopping without me I think she's going to buy three dresses why do we got to be we got to be we're control freaks it's okay say amen amen we're control freaks amen no no now we haven't sinned yet we're still right in the center of the word and so here that was the watch the motive behind this question of brother Brown now this is a 64 question so this is not un old question but the motive was we don't have room for sisters we're just going to have brothers in the church yeah oh buddy that that's that's a whole different world but anyway let's go to his answer he said now now I'm going to read this part and now remember this is our prophet and he was balanced and he was Vindicated and he went on the other side of the road too like to balance it you know what I'm saying but I I can't preach the whole message in one hour I'm trying to but but this is just one portion next Sunday I'll preach the other side of the road okay so and then somewhere in this by a miracle of the foolishness of preaching we'll maybe be balanced yeah we will be if God's in it he said now you are this is a real hard question and I can only answer it to the best that I know how and now I could not judge wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute brother Bram he had Visions God showed him what was going to happen in the future wait a minute brother Brandon he says I could not judge wait a minute this was a Bible question this was a Bible question it's about sisters speaking in tongues in the church because they're supposed to shut up everywhere they go just shut up and follow me I don't want to be married to you bless holy smokes you can see why you need a rebel you sisters that aren't married you could be blessed by Jehovah being single you could be married to a loggerhead like brother Dale amen I'm trying to make a point there's a reason for everything would you rather be in bondage trapped by the law and have to follow some not me H amen I'm sorry he said I could not judge because I was not sent to judge wow now if brother Brenham wasn't sent to now he preached against sin bless God but here he's saying I wasn't sent to judge but I want to judge every day oh bless God nobody wore nobody I don't like your you know what I me oh oh I didn't wear a white shirt today oh Purity is supposed to be white I'm probably preaching off the word I'm sorry I got some white shirts at church if I remember I'll wear three next Sunday he said I wasn't sent to judge but I think there's so many times that I got another question down here somewhere that it goes right along with this with that but if a person speaking in tongues and they're anointed of God see they may be watch this oh you're not going to like this I didn't like it either they may be oh by the way you can pull that up uh skip our scriptures it's on Facebook I got it two different things it's uh well one that I printed off on my from my iPad Vicki so it's not highlighted uh Yep this is it so I'm right up there uh no no no no there's got to be another one is there another one let's oh M I'm sorry go back to the other one no that's that's coming that's coming we just we take it down for a second that's coming sorry but I think there's so many times that I got another uh so let me Jump Ahead here speaking in tongues and they're Anointed God see they may be out of order so he's saying the person speaking in tongues they may do it out of order that may be true and they may be doing something that's not right it's not right now he's not condoning it he's just he's explaining the situ that's not right but I wouldn't want to say that that wasn't God the Holy Spirit now wait a minute he just said that they may be out of order and they may be doing it wrong and he's a word Prophet but he wouldn't say they were it wasn't God that was leading them whoa wait a minute wait a minute that's Mass confusion no because I wouldn't know see now here now now this this gets crazy good now and now there's many times that this that people misjudge one another and that's real bad thing to do you say why she's got oh this is going to hurt this is it it just think for a little why she's got short hair that's not scripture I mean if she's cut it it's not scriptural if if it's on cut it is she may be wearing a dress too short now you know that our Prophet preached against that okay but this is still our Prophet like he was on both scenarios and and listen we're not promoting modesty you're supposed to be modest or you're not converted okay but watch how he answers this so you she may have too short of hair she may be wearing a dress too short and that's and that's not the Holy Spirit upon her okay now it's perfect balance so that's wrong but watch how he goes don't do that wait wait don't do that don't do that that's not right you don't know you don't know what's in in that woman's heart he's talking about don't don't judge her he's he's telling the woman don't do that but then he says don't do that that's not right but don't judge her you don't know what's in her heart you don't know nothing about it you don't know now I say wait a minute I do know about it if the woman cut her hair not supposed to cut her hair she's supposed to be modest but he says you know that the Holy Spirit would make her condemn herself a little better now uh conduct yourself a little better sorry uh that may be true but I'll tell you as you and I let God now let me repeat let God let God I've said this before in things I don't care what they look like when they come in that door if I have never seen them before and you have never seen them before let God do the judging of that and that's you and I just pray well that's something I don't want to do cuz that's boring when we pray like there's no excitement there's no sometimes there a't you see that's how we're like Hollywood he said you and I just pray for that person that God will show them the light show them where they're wrong and here sometimes ago a man met me here they pulled me aside and there was a pianoist and they're talking about I'm going to paraphrase this brother Brown had a pianoist and she was wearing a short skirt and and I used this a little while ago and I know you probably remember and but God told me to read it again and she had short hair and a short dress and she had a mid drift she had a two-piece so her belly button showed now I that's just okay and he said the and he said the man come up now watch this this is where we're getting to and the man came up to brother Bram out there and was just ripping me apart he said tear me to pieces and said and you profess the be a Pentecostal preacher and let a woman like that sit up there he said that short hair and that going on everything and this how the prophet he said well I said I think the woman's got a good spirit on her and I certainly don't agree with that part you know that the skirt part and here and the two pieces and that but one of them down here and kind of up here he's talking about her clothes she was in modest her skirt nut real thin and it showed her underneath garment and they were around here and I don't think that should be done I don't like that I really don't but I can't but I might but they might be just as Spirit-filled as anybody else I don't know how they could be I'm just confessing it's all right you don't I'm I'm so he said they might be just as spirit filed as anybody else and brother Dale would say how how watch this this is this is a Vindicated Prophet I don't know God knows that but I oh bless God I'd like to preach a lot of message people right about now but I wouldn't condemn that woman and say that she was going to Hell by sight that is in paragraph 64 of God being misunderstood 61723 evening 61723 evening God being misunderstood I want to read that soon said God knows that but I wouldn't condemn that woman and say that she's going to Hell by the sight but that's message Believers would and I would have been in the front of the row 20 years ago 30 years ago oh yeah I was leading the church bless God I'm saving the world yeah yeah oh yeah I sure saved the world all right they left they left not because they weren't predestinated because I was an idiot and I can say Amen cuz God revealed it to me but there's some other people that could wear those shoes too verse 65 and this person this person that came to tear brother brandham apart had a church down the road and there was a lady there with long hair and wore very long dresses and she had a temper that would run above uhoh and I just drop to paragraph 67 I'm only reading the back part of the paragraph to save time but when you're real quickly when you when you real quickly condemn her you drive her away and you might harm that Young born baby Christian baby and I wouldn't condemn that person um and then he goes into talking about people speaking in tongues and this is the same paragraph 69 he said now I have to say something here that's a little strange and if you don't agree with me that's okay you see we misjudge these things so many times see the family of God has got so correct that we can't tolerate one another I won't go to your house you can't come to mine cuz you would probably die but we're all going in a Rapture and it's going to be perfect we might as well be honest we should be at each other's house intertwined all the time upside breakfasts suppers tea you know I have worldly people that seen me we seen worldly I told you that last time I can't I can't I still can't get over it and and they said if you and the drive by you stop in and see us for a tea whatever happened to to Fellowship just just Fellowship you don't need a preacher present it's it might be nice if I you know what I mean it don't have to be like part of the scheduled Services you don't even need an invite to come to my house amen amen I I'm sorry I'm I'm trying to God's trying to teach us something here he said he said I have to say something a little strange here and you might you might not agree with me this that's okay he you see we misjudge these things many times let's always try to think the very best of anybody who's trying to do what's right and probably failing which one of us can live the law by Perfection well guess what you wouldn't spend no money on Sunday come to me I'll give you the law rule book pull it up from the old Wesleyan let's Express the very best to them let us express our very best to them even though we might oh they're trying they're trying they're serving the devil but they're trying well they're not maybe as far down the road as you are maybe maybe they're teenagers teenagers go there's ien we have you were a teenager I know it was a long time ago but try to think back the Bible says that don't remind me of the sins of my youth that's kind of like all of us amen I'm wow I'm sorry oh they uh oh they're trying we don't know their heart unless you have discernment if they're wrong then if you got the Bible says if your brother be overtaken taken in a fault then let them which are spiritual go to the brother in a Meek Spirit consider your own self lest you would sin too be tempted so that you you'd have to really bring down your ego and see that if you could reconcile the brother see back to God and don't say that they haven't got the right spirit let's move on well I oh man I'm sorry what well we seen brother Braham talks about when he went to the Pentecostal people and they spoke in tongues and he said he said in the quote here I'm paraphrasing he said I felt that I was among angels and he said God sent me out and he said I realized that one was was a Christian and one was a devil see gifts and callings are without repentance amen maybe the person that shelts the loudest and I believe in shelting praise God we're Stone quiet God forbid that he'd have to bring a worldly person in among us to Make Some Noise to keep the preacher fired up amen Hebrews 67 and 8 and the world which here here when brother Brown went to those Pentecostal people he couldn't understand how one could be a believer and one could be a uh uh a devil and God gave him the scripture you know the story and the quotes where the wind kept blowing his Bible open to it cuz he was sleeping in the cornfield because he had so much money he couldn't afford a room wow a lot of you young people don't know what hard times are yet when you start sleeping in the cornfield amen and the Earth which drinketh the rain cometh upon it and it bringeth forth herbs to meet them that are dressed and receiveth the blessing from God and also the Thorns that are rejected and cursing they're all burnt but see the rain falls on the just and the unjust you have you have Matthew let's move ahead to Matthew 5 I'm trying to go fast Matthew 5 I really really need to finish this please Matthew 5:43 and 48 and you have heard it uh that has been said that thou shalt love the th brother and hate thy neighbor but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of Our Father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise even God unjust on his family he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good sendeth reain on the just and on the unjust how much more could the Christians just get along even if we disagree because God send in the Holy Spirit on all of you he's sending the rain on the just and the unjust why couldn't we just be friends amen amen watch this uh for 46 for if ye love them which love you what reward have you if you only go to the people that you enjoy this the tea that they serve and you feel really comfortable at your home and you never come to my home what reward do you have now we just have a church with Clicks in it amen uh do not even the publicans do the same and if you salute your brother that you really have the same Doctrine and salute only the brother that you do more than others do you not like the Republicans verse 48 because ye therefore be perfect as your father which is in heaven Hallelujah God help us let's let's just go fast here God why he said uh Jehovah made us amateur gods and we're a part of his family and I already mentioned that so so now he don't exist alone I'm just skipping that he don't exist alone he dwells with his family and it's a part but the problem is not the father in the family it's the father is always the children they made me do it or she did do it amen and we got to get out of that God didn't make us to be title Tales do we all believe that God's omnipotent do we believe that he's got the the beginning from the end then why does he need me to tell him who took a cookie I mean he seen that cookie taken 2,000 years ago Matthew 71:5 judge not here's my scripture so I I'm now I'm in the word of God judge not that you be not judged I don't even care if you're judging correctly we can all see goats if you see a goat yeah there's a goat she's got spikes on she don't have no wool and she's black a lot says don't judge remember when it says to go re second tell the brother that if you didn't go in humility that you would fall judge not lest you be judged for for with what judgment ye judge ye shall also be judged and with merit with which measure you Merit it shall be measured again unto you and Why beholdest th Brothers mol in his eye but considerest not the beam in thine own eye wilt thou whether say to thy brother let me pull out the mold out of thy eye and behold the beam that's in I know ey thou hypocrite were all born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies you're not perfected yet or you would have died amen thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt clearly be able to cast out the beam out of the brother's eye now I got some really short quotes now we're going to pull up this thing and shut her down here he said you know sometimes we I'm going to give you the titles and just these are on liners you know sometimes misjudge he said just zillions of times you know sometimes we misjudge the the common person and their prayer that's in the Covenant God's covenant with Abraham and now there's many times that this that people misjudge one another and it's a bad thing to do that's God being misunderstood and if you don't agree with me that's okay but you see we misjudge the things many times that's God being misunderstood also so many times we write in here and on serpent seed and you say you write into to the prophet and you say that I said so and so and I go and I get the tape and I play the tape back and I didn't say what you said I said see people misjudge things that's in the sign of the end sir Romans 8 uh 2 Romans 82 and I want you can pull up this picture that you had up there before for the the law of the spirit is life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death and I put in paraphrase they they praise the Lord now if you look in this this is in the Philippians Church age number seven uh there one of the last quotes that come up uh and this scripture is a par in the paragraph right above and I want to read this this is a quote Oh no sorry go to the uh that that's go to the other one that's one this is one so we're starting right at the first paragraph where it says but but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus they wanted to they they did not want to accept that sacrifice meaning Christ Jesus the blood of bull and goats made nothing perfect the law made nothing perfect but it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by shedding of his own blood had put away sin by that offering of himself had made us perfect and the Jews would not take that they love the law but what about the Philippian AIDS and yes and all the other Church ages that means the Leo Dean Church age too that means you love the law too unless God help me amen you all the other Church ages too I made it there with a question mark did you Did they really accept this really in Christ no sir even though Luther brought the truth by justification the Roman Church it the Eastern counterparts and the Orthodox church and still clung to works now works are fine but they won't save you that's right they won't make you perfect and it is Christ or parish and it is not even Christ and my good works it is Christ alone that's right this AE now we got to get through this because we got to change topics this age began years in the help me out honey somebody the okay sorry oh buddy that does not believe in Christ as a reality they couldn't change CH they could not turn the corner they didn't believe in Christ as a reality it does not sing watch how the prophets making a good point here he see they don't sing there's nothing but the blood for it's a song of nothing but the blood in my Good Conduct that's how a lot of Believers serve that's why there's empty pews in this church it's not because there's no predestinated seat around driving distance of this church it's because we're singing a song that is Jesus Christ in the blood and we're better than you cuz I wee a tie and it's all sweaty that's just tradition he said that's the song they sing it's nothing but the blood and my own conduct now you believe I now I believe in Good Conduct and if you're saved you will do righteously and we have already gone over that I I have too I preached on the fruits of the spirit you can tell but we don't have a right to judge and but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus we got to get this or we're going to be I'm going to die of old age and I don't want to go in some old bony casket it's Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it is all God let his life be in me and it's his blood that cleanse me and let it be his spirit that fills me and let it be his word in my heart and mouth and let it be his stripes that heals me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not my works of righteousness which I have done no sir it's Christ is my life now I can't preach that no pler than that that's right amen I I just got a few little things here please if you'll hold on he said now one member he said now when one member talks against another member he said you know that's wrong he said you should pray for one another and don't talk against one another but love them and pick them up it's talking about picking up if you if you search for pick up he said you should never condemn a brother that's Topsy turby Topsy turby he said just like the mother ego she'll pick him up as long as he's a ego amen and when you do this the draw lines oh we're good long dryer line dryers brother Paul the Fontaine mentioned some stuff to us and I'm not going to mention here we're out of time but that's of the devil just shake your head like this if it hurts we don't need to draw lines I don't care what they believe over there I'm still going to go be their friends amen amen amen they might be twice as good as me amen and when you do all this and you draw lines and not Fellowship one with the other brother's wrong you'll never win him to Christ by shoving him down farther that's right oh if one down in the gutter you'll never show him you you don't never shove him down farther you pick him up and you quickly and you help him we should be an example to him he said you know a real Christian this way will hide everything he can from each other you know if you're the father of the house and you know I could use anyone I I was looking at brother Lauren brother Lauren had some boys and if one of the boys and only brother Lauren knew about it he don't have to put it on Facebook you know he don't have to tell the other four brothers You Got a brother I told my mom that one time it didn't go over well you know what I'm saying it's God's family he said no we ought to hide from one another don't tell your his bad things he said just tell his good things just tell what you know of him that's good if anything's bad let it alone the poor little fellows got enough against them anyway don't try to put them don't get a pull and shove them down further into the ditch CHR the Christian attitude could they add the message attitude the converted attitude is to pick them up and get them out of the ditch and don't never try to shove them down he's down already try to help him but too many times too many of us to say don't do that I might say to try to do that and that's my closing paragraph and I truly am done Philippians 2 3 and 4 let nothing be done by strife and vain Glory but in lonliness of mind letting each esteem the other better than himself look not every man at his own boast look at what I did poof just stop breathing and you'll soon find out what you did but let every man also look to the things of others let's stand I promise I promise a very big promise oh dear Jesus God help us I I I pray to God you know I I was I was with our brother this week and we were really open and Lan is very supportive there's lots and lots of times I'll come to Friday and I'll say man I don't have a clue what I'm preaching on now you know I could take the Bible and just pull anything I could preach on any family topic unless God really anointed you might not even know but God just showed that thing how it was always the kids that fight among themselves and it's never the parents that it's never the parents that are got a problem in the family it's always the kids running to Daddy and saying Dad D D D D D and God said preach that to my church Preach that to my church if you believe that God's omnipotent and he is the alpha the beginning and the Omega the end he already knew I took the Molasses cookie out of the jar he could tell by the size of my waist he didn't need you to come and tell them that you caught me in the ACT look and I I'm trying to close this look at the Spirit of Christ when they caught the woman right in the act of adultery and it was wrong it was sin he said where are your accusers it was never Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was so holy none of us could stand in front of him but it's CU he was our heavenly father and he had a family and he realized that in the family I'm trying to end he realized that some of his sons would be good with money and he realized some of them would be a disaster he realized some would go in debt to their eyes and some wouldn't go in dead at all he realized some daughters would get married young and some daughters wouldn't never get married but he was still the father they amen they were as different but he was the father and there's nothing like what he said when you go back to my mom and dad and if there ever was a a fatherly figure it was my dad that had the kids and no more than ever before when the dad and mom and you guys have family come together whether it's Thanksgiving or Christmas or your birthday you'll break the debt in Mom's heart more than anything if you fight you're only going to be there for one day does it matter like does it matter who's the nothing matters all that matters is the rapture and we're breaking God's heart because because we're fighting we're breaking God's heart because we're fighting cuz he's got ones out there that won't come until the fighting stops they won't come they won't come to Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving or even Mom and Dad's birthday until they see the brothers and sisters that are already there stop fighting and then you'll see people come in the door and they'll look different than us yep just leave it to God brother Dale ain't going to make a sermon for them God will take care of everything that don't mean you're compromising that don't not mean you let the goats down you you know what I me tell you something I'm going to I'm going to say something drastic here we are on biblical and on scripture and failing God if there's no goats present cu the Bible said to go the only commission was to go into all the world and preach the gospel preach the gospel I'd love to preach to some goats maybe I'd get some butts amen like it it you know me amen God listen I had to go through that Journey any of you that knew me when I came first into the message you can just shake your head I'll close my eyes yeah you can't pick up the feathers I'm trying to save you a lot of grief God's trying to take us in a Rapture amen God help us amen God help you I I promise I promise next time if if God will I'm going to preach on slavery next Sunday man God help us just to be just kind just kind I I might not like your clothes I might not like your look I might hate your clone I might not like your food but just be kind just pretend even just pretend just even pretend just be kind you'll be you'll be blown away with what kindness I'll give you you get more bees with honey

Lord that even though there's there's people that are outside of your perfect will and your perfect word we're we understand that you have a plan but God the only way they can come in and get
