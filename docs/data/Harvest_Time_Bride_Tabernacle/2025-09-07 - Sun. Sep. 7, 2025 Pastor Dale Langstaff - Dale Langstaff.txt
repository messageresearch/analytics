Amen. God's so good. Amen. You know when we sing that song, you are great. If that don't bless your heart, your wood's wet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If that don't make you get excited, &gt;&gt; your wood's wet. You need to lay in the presence of the sen son &gt;&gt; to get dried out. &gt;&gt; To let your wood get dried out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to preach on eternal life this morning. And uh let's turn to Luke 10:25. We'll read our scripture and have your seats. And I'll tell you, God sure knows what he's doing. We're going to remember Brother Jeff. They must have had a flat tire or something, but he has double hernia surgery tomorrow. Amen. And uh so just remember them. But uh um your special Vanessa was just so perfect. &gt;&gt; So very very perfect. We'll have you sing that at the end of our message. But that's what we want to preach on &gt;&gt; is her message. Totally. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; it's just how God arranged everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Jesus, saying, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Lord God, you know everything. Lord, you know what your plan is. And Lord, you know before the foundation of the world who would be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. who would be ready to receive this thought that you have planned for them, Lord God. &gt;&gt; And Lord, the ones that it is attended for, Lord God, I pray they will receive it in the spirit that you brought it to me, Lord God. We give you the glory and honor for it in your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this morning. You know, our prophet said to live me a sermon, live me a message. is better than to preach me a message. &gt;&gt; And you know, we want to look at that thought. And you know, I I started Wednesday night, we started preaching on what is the Christian life, &gt;&gt; not what is it to be a Christian, but what is the Christian life? &gt;&gt; What is it to live the Christian life? And and I honestly believe and this is no uh this is no slam to you or to me or if it is it's to me but I I wonder just sometimes if God's going to adjust our thought pattern just a little bit on what is the Christian life and and uh I'm going to I'm going to show you something outside this. You know the Christian life is more than believing this message. It's actually a lot more than believing this message because you want me to give you an example of that? Satan believes this message. &gt;&gt; He's scared to death of it because it's Christ. So it's a lot more than believing the letter &gt;&gt; because the Bible said that Paul said the letter kleth but the spirit giveth life. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And so see we we know the mysteries and we know just a tremendous amount of knowledge. We know who God is and we know uh his plan for even our own personal lives and but if we get caught up too much on the letter &gt;&gt; and not the life, &gt;&gt; we'll just be preachers. &gt;&gt; We'll just all be preachers &gt;&gt; preaching to our families or whatever. But we're just preaching letter. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know, it might surprise you, but right underneath the capstone of perfection &gt;&gt; is brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that would be like a sacrifice &gt;&gt; or compassion. &gt;&gt; And you know, when times get tough and you can hardly survive yourself, &gt;&gt; it's hard to have compassion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know nothing in nature lives for itself? No. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram, his whole personal life was comparing God to nature. You know, a river don't drink its own water. A tree don't eat its own fruit. &gt;&gt; The flowers don't bloom to smell good for themselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They probably give themselves a headache. And nobody sacrificed more than Jesus to leave the splendor of heaven, &gt;&gt; to become a flesh body, to have people spit on him, pull his beard out, drive nails through his hands, and whip him until the back of his body, his ribs shine through his backbone. And here a lawyer stood up tempting Jesus and said, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" And you know, I think this is where God wants to just curb us just slightly is it's not the seven seals. And it's not the prophet either. &gt;&gt; Although those are all true. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; But would it be okay if I just let Jesus himself answer that question? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because you I felt something that when I said those words, you know, it's amazing when you preach a message and people that believe the message retaliate against the message. &gt;&gt; I can feel it. I just grabbed it. &gt;&gt; I didn't need a ball glove. Here Jesus himself ends, and he said unto him, it is written in the law, how thou readest it. Do thou readest the Bible? &gt;&gt; Jesus answer. And he answered and said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind. Now that covers just basically a lot of your body &gt;&gt; and thy and with all thy heart and thy neighbor as thyself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said to and Jesus said unto him, thou answerest right. doest thou and thou shalt have eternal life. &gt;&gt; See, he Jesus never said the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Jesus never said the prophets. &gt;&gt; He said himself. You know, I was listening to a clip of Donnie Reagan and and you know, it just amazed me. He said, you know, and and you know, tremendous brother and just amazing. He said, 'You know, when Eleazer picked up Rebecca to take him to Isaac, he never talked about himself. You know, if I said that without saying Donnie Rian's name, some of you would be offended. But he never talked about his great campaigns and how long his prayer lines were and how many people's got new eyes and new arms. He said, he said, you know, Donnie Regan was saying, she said, Ellie Ezer told Rebecca one thing. My master, &gt;&gt; my master, my master, my master, my master, my master, my master, &gt;&gt; sir. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And Donnie Reagan said, "And most of us talk about the prophet more than our master." &gt;&gt; Donnie Reagan said that. It's on my Facebook clip if anybody wants to see it. &gt;&gt; So don't be offended at me. Be offended at him. &gt;&gt; But I know he's true. That's why I reshared it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We say, "Oh, the prophet did great things." The prophet never said that. No. &gt;&gt; Said, "And love thy neighbor as thyself, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" And then, you know, you know, the disciples came to Jesus in a different scripture, and I I'm just jumping way ahead. He said, "Jesus, why do you speak in parables?" And he said, "Well, it's given to you to know the mysteries, but it's not given to them." And I told you that story to jump right into a parable. And Jesus answered this lawyer by a parable. And he said, "A certain man, this is verse 30, went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among thieves, and he was stripped of his ragment, and he was wounded, and he departed, leaving him half dead." And by chance there came a certain priest or prophet that believed the message. &gt;&gt; They believed the message of that day. &gt;&gt; That was on that place. And he came and looked on him and he passed on the other side. But and likewise a Levite, another minister that was in the tabernacle that day, believe in the truth for their day. And when he came to the place, he looked upon him and he passed by the other side. Now I I just want to tell you something that the priest and the Levite was everybody that was believing Christianity were following those men. Why does Jesus tell parables like this? &gt;&gt; Verse 33. But a certain Samaritan, which is a mixed race, &gt;&gt; religiously unclean, pagan by association. They were half gentile, &gt;&gt; pagan by association. As he journeyed, he came where he was and he saw him and he had compassion on him &gt;&gt; and he went to him and he bound up his wounds and he poured oil in him and he set him on his own beast and he brought him to the end which was the church. Brother Bram says that. I'm going to read that after. And he brought him to the church and he took care of him. And on the tomorrow he departed and he left some money, two pence, and he gave him to the host. And he said unto him, he said, "Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again, I will repay thee." And Jesus asked, "Which of these three thinkst thou was the neighbor upon him that fell among the thieves?" Which of these three do you think have eternal life? And he said, "Well, he that showeth mercy on him." And Jesus said to you, "Go and do thou likewise." &gt;&gt; Now, I can't preach no better message than Jesus. &gt;&gt; We could just close. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And go home. That surprises me. And it surprises you. I know it surprises you the way you're looking at me. This was eternal life. &gt;&gt; This was more than being in a message church. &gt;&gt; Being in any message church. &gt;&gt; This was God himself, Jesus in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Saying eternal life. &gt;&gt; What must I do? And they were trying to trick him into this. And Jesus tells this parable that is knocking the message of the day. &gt;&gt; Because they never had compassion. &gt;&gt; And compassion is one that you know in the Bible it says they put a mark on them that sighed and cried for the abominations committed in the world. You know, I wonder, you know, like when we get inside our click called the message, wherever it is in any campground, in any church, any B, I wonder how much we have our arms opened up to all our neighbors. &gt;&gt; Come on over. Come on in. &gt;&gt; And we treat them like royalty, like the thief on the road. Like this song said, there's somebody out there that's confused. There's a child that's been abused. There's somebody there's somebody everywhere around you in your life that needs one word, compassion. &gt;&gt; And in the compassion, it's so unnatural that it'll give you eternal life. It's so unnatural for humans to to to have compassion on a complete stranger. Not don't have nothing to do with me. Not my bills. Not my problem. Not my kids. I can only feed my own kids. Not my household. &gt;&gt; Don't matter to me. I never made that bad decision. &gt;&gt; Thieves never got me. &gt;&gt; What must I do to have eternal life? I wonder if the message today has eternal life. &gt;&gt; Do they have the same eternal life that Jesus talked about? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, I wonder I wonder if we do. &gt;&gt; I wonder if I do. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's pretty hard to knock what Jesus says. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Jeff called me Saturday morning, invited me out for a big party, and I said, "Brother Jeff, I don't have one clue what I'm preaching this morning. No one clue. I was trying to get out of the way. I was trying to pray. I was trying to stand on my head. And I just hung up from him." And it just went I was going somewhere at 10:30. I told brother Jeff I was I already had an appointment to go somewhere at 10:30 and I was just on my iPad sprinting as fast as it could come in my &gt;&gt; brother Bram said regarding the the man that give the two pence. He said he brought the wounded person to the church and the two pence he give them in one quote was salvation and healing. And the other one, another quote he gave him, he said he brought them to the church and he gave him two pence and it was the spirit and the word. &gt;&gt; And you know when we look on this, you know, the Bible talks about the priesthood and and the Levites and it mentioned this in the scripture, but in Revelations 1:6, it said, "Heath has made us all priests." &gt;&gt; Amen. and all kings. Unto God his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. We're supposed to be all in this boat of compassion and ministry. And you know, ministry is living for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam, I just have some some thoughts here from him. He said, "You know, when you get the Holy Spirit, remember, you're going to be judged for what you've done &gt;&gt; with it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you didn't get this revelation to not show compassion. &gt;&gt; He said, "You might receive Christ by the Holy Ghost, but you'll be condemned. Every man that judged according to the works he done in his body, you'll be condemned by how you kept it to yourself." You know, I was looking through a set of quotes where where where and I I know it's out there, but Brother Bram said, you know, if you had a chance to witness or or the ones that will be lost, there will be a certain amount of responsibility on us. &gt;&gt; There will be a certain amount of responsibility. Ones that are lost in my circle and ones that are lost in your circle, God will consider, did you ever do what you could to show them the truth? Can you imagine when we get in heaven and we're judging the world cuz we're the bride. We're in the rapture. Now, we've went in the rapture and we're ready to judge the world. And the very people we're getting to judge say, "I lived right beside brother Dale. He never ever told me who Jesus was." &gt;&gt; You know what you're going to do? You're going to get small lur &gt;&gt; and you're going to want to disappear. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Here the prophet said, he said, "After you've received the Holy Ghost, what have you done with it?" He didn't say like, "Who did you correct by the seven seals?" So, what have you done with it? Have you talked to your neighbor? &gt;&gt; Here, another one. And he said, "We're going to be judged according to what we've done about him that's in our heart." Amen. Here's And sorry Vicki, I'm just You're doing a fantastic Here's another one. He said, "Now the first thing I would say is Jesus never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. That's perfectly eternal life." and you say, you know, I'm a I go to church and I've done these good things and I'm a message believer and I live my life to yourself and you haven't got eternal life. Now, you don't get mad at me. You have to get mad at Brother Brham. He said, "Eternal life is living for others." &gt;&gt; So, here's brother Brandham backing up what Jesus said and he said, "Eternal life ain't coming to this message, church. &gt;&gt; Eternal life might not even believe in this message because Satan believes it, too. But he ain't living for others. He's destroying others. And that's what the spirit is sometimes on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's proved to come by the lamb of God. And he lived and he had eternal life because he did not live for himself. He lived for others. And and you receive eternal life by receiving that day. You don't live for yourself no more. You live for others. That's that day on Calvary. He said, "I don't care what a man's done if he's sincere in his heart and you're right in your belief. You're wrong for acting the way you acting." &gt;&gt; He's talking about the priest that passed by the person that was bleeding to death. &gt;&gt; You know, like when you're going down the 401, you got an appointment. Say, "Well, it's not my accident." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. He said, "I'd rather be the place be in yours." That's right. He said, "I'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my compassion." &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says that out of the abundance of the heart, the m the mouth speaketh. &gt;&gt; Because I'd rather be wrong in my doctrine, right in my heart, than to be right in my doctrine. After all, it's the heart conditioned. &gt;&gt; See, so we got the doctrine right. But do we feel sorry for a sin? Are do is he going to put a mark on our forehead because we sigh and cry for the abominations committed in the world? &gt;&gt; That mark was the protection. It was the token. Amen. It was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. First Corinthians, you know, here here's Paul and this was an amazing. He said, you know, he said, I don't come to you. He said, and brethren, verse one of 2 Corinthians, he said, and brother, when I came to you, I came not with excellent speech and of wisdom. Now, wisdom is declaring the word of God, declaring unto you the testimony of the revealed word of our day. That's what Paul said. For I am determined to say no nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified which is a sacrifice. But watch verse four. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of spirit and power. Now, I want to I want to tell you something in this back to our good Samaritan story. It's the spirit that has compassion. &gt;&gt; And if you want to see power, see somebody that's willing to sacrifice their time. Oh, I can't. I got an appointment. Oh, I can't. My wife's taking me out for supper. You know, the Bible talked about that. The people that never had time. I can't. I bought a new piece of property. I bought a herd of cows and I got to go inspect them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I I'd like to come to the marriage supper, but I can't because &gt;&gt; you want to see demonstration and power is people that give up their money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two pence. I never seen the guy before. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, he don't even come to our message church. &gt;&gt; Help us, Jesus. And I even offered more pence after. &gt;&gt; It probably was even his fault he got robbed. Probably he was wearing his gold outside. &gt;&gt; See how we justify everything. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I don't come with men's wisdom in demonstration of the spirit and power." That spirit is compassion. And that power is to do something that your body in the flesh is screaming. This is none of your business. Don't get involved. Don't get involved. These aren't your kids. You didn't raise them. &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, brother, you know, the Bible says in Mark uh 16, right near the end of the chapter, it says to go into all the world and preach the gospel. And you know, brother Brown commented on that verse 348 times. I tried to go through all the quotes last night and it got really dark outside, but uh I was looking for something in there. But you know, he talked about the multiple times that his kids and his wife would come and say, "Bill, do you have to go away, &gt;&gt; sacrifice, &gt;&gt; compassion, &gt;&gt; living for others, Now remember this was eternal life. So you know it just &gt;&gt; you know the power and the spirit was compassion, brotherly kindness, a sacrifice. Sacrifice is giving up something valuable for someone else less deserving. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You know, a ain't that something? You know, it this really, you know, why couldn't God give me just a nice, you know, you are the elected bride or something? And that was last Sunday. &gt;&gt; But so many times we we minister and brother Dale's guilty of this. You watch you watch this, you know, and and and God's actually God has actually spoke to me and and literally literally I I kid you not. And you know, different ministers when they minister, the way they minister is to knock somebody else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't want them to come here. I don't care who they are. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz see, that's that's just human nature. You know, if I want to get promoted, I have to tell everybody else I'm smarter than everybody else. I have to step on everybody else's head, kick them, trip them, whatever. You see, and and that's not how God operates. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But because we're so caught up in the flesh that to get ahead in Christianity, I got to insult somebody else. You don't have to do that. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; This is something I'm learning. &gt;&gt; So, so many times when we minister, we say we're right. &gt;&gt; Who said &gt;&gt; you're judging yourself? &gt;&gt; We're right and they're wrong. &gt;&gt; Says who? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? Who told you that? We have the truth and we have Christ and none of the other people do. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram never said that. &gt;&gt; Dozens of times he never said that. dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of times. This is air &gt;&gt; and we shouldn't preach that way. &gt;&gt; See, we shouldn't look or worry about where somebody else's revelation is or even their faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because everybody's revelation and faith is different. &gt;&gt; Blessed are you, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood never gave this to you, &gt;&gt; but my father &gt;&gt; which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Now that scripture don't matter where you go to church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know you could be going to the Baptist church uptown and get revelation? Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; cuz flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; if you go to church of 700 and it's an amazing pastor, it wasn't the flesh that gave it to you, &gt;&gt; but my father, &gt;&gt; see, it wasn't the flesh that gave me this message cuz I told Jeff, I don't have a clue what maybe I sometimes sell away. Maybe we'll just have testimonies today. But it's my father &gt;&gt; that's in control. It's the spirit. It's the It's the compassion. &gt;&gt; So watch what Brother Bram says. And this is the most powerful quote I've ever read. I seen it this week and I sent it to Pastor Osman and he went, "Wow." He said, 'You know, we're not ashamed of the gospel because we're in fellowship. Hallelujah. And when a man's born of the spirit of God, there's something that happens to him. He's brought into the shikina glory and he's a child of God and faith dwells within him. He's Abraham's seed then and he's died in dead in Christ and taken on Abraham's seed. Oh, the world if they could only know what it was, knew what it was. But hang on to your seats this part. And if you really want to catch the message, read the fake words, the caps. And I tell you now, this is the prophet. See &gt;&gt; where what we've done, where we've made our mistake. Now, he is talking directly to message believers. &gt;&gt; He's not preaching in a Pentecostal church. This is a 61 quote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is we've denominated. &gt;&gt; Bless God. We're the message. We don't need to witness no more. We don't need to show compassion no more. We don't need to hit pick up hitchhikers no more. We don't need to stop to pick up people that are bleeding on the road no more. We don't need to do nothing no more cuz we got the revelations. We know the seven seals. &gt;&gt; We don't have to do nothing no more. We don't care if anybody else gets it. I got it. They don't. Too bad for them. So sad you're dead. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like the the the the son that was at college and he said, "Dad, no mud, no fun." The dad rolling back said, "Too bad your dad so sad." That's how message believers are. When's the last time you stopped in your neighbors and told them how good God had been to you? &gt;&gt; Now, now this is actually the prophet that said this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's okay if I read what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what? I actually never looked for this quote. I never seen it before. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now, if you'll excuse me," because he knows the people are hating this. &gt;&gt; Where we made our mistake is we've tried to denominate ourselves into eternal life. &gt;&gt; Bless God. I'm in a message church. I got it. You ain't. &gt;&gt; So sad &gt;&gt; for you. We have it. And the rest of them don't have it. Says who? &gt;&gt; Says who? &gt;&gt; The Methodists. Now, now this is still your prophet. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God for the screen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You would never believe what I'm reading you. He said they don't have it. That's what 95% of message believers believe. &gt;&gt; Sure do. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen because it's the truth. &gt;&gt; I know exactly where I'm standing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't make up this message on my own. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Methodist, the Baptist, and the Presbyterian, they're nothing if they're old cold formals. But if you don't watch them, you're going to be old cold formals, too. We've already arrived to that part. &gt;&gt; We've already arrived to that part. &gt;&gt; And they're going to pick it up and go on. Exactly. Right. And you watch out. You'll find yourself &gt;&gt; denominated. &gt;&gt; Because you're just coming in from the right and the left everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. What must we do to have eternal life? &gt;&gt; And Jesus falls into a parable. There was a man that nobody knew that got robbed and injured on the road and left for dead. And whoever stopped and helped him, he said, "You have eternal life. Go and live." That's eternal life. because that means you don't die. The only things that don't die is eternal. &gt;&gt; You know, he never said if you believe the prophets and the seven se and we believe those. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, when Vanessa started singing this song, I thought, how in the world did God line up everything so perfectly? &gt;&gt; There's nobody's out there whose heart's breaking, who a child, there's somebody out there feeling alone. a husband, a wife being done wrong. There's somebody out there scattered from a broken home. Compassion is not natural. There's somebody out there who thought it was cool, taking a chance, didn't think they would ever lose, &gt;&gt; and now they're hooked on a feeling that them empty and a fool. &gt;&gt; Well, who would have compassion on that person? &gt;&gt; There's one person, &gt;&gt; and that's Christ. That's the spirit of Christ. And if he's living inside of us, we will act exactly the nature of Christ because watch this. I want to go to my next Well, actually, we got a scripture here first. Sorry. Well, that we're going to skip that one, Vicki. That was a parables. The disciples came to Jesus and they spoke in parables, maybe actually. And you know, he says, he said, "It's because it's for you to understand the mysteries of the kingdom. The mysteries is eternal life. It what you know what? When we get right down to brass tax where the rubber hits the road, does anything else matter if you're in heaven and have eternal life? &gt;&gt; Nothing else. If if I have eternal life and I'm in heaven and I'm sitting on the throne with my Lord, it don't matter where I went to church or what I thought or what I believed in anything or what how many books I read or nothing. is have I got eternal life? Am I gonna be the one that makes it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said you can have the revelation that if everybody's going to be lost that you'll be the one that makes it. &gt;&gt; And he also said your actions will show it. &gt;&gt; No matter what you say, you can tell me you believe the prophet and praise God, but do you show it? &gt;&gt; Do you live it? When a when a little tiny girl or an old grandma has a flat tire, you pull over when it's pouring rain, she's sitting there like, "I don't know what to do." &gt;&gt; You say, "You know what? I'd blow right by." Say, "Oh, bless God. She's got a cell phone." &gt;&gt; That was a predestinated appointment that you could have just said, "Hey, you know, God is so good to me. My tires didn't go flat." and I got the strength to help you change yours." &gt;&gt; She's like, "Whoa, I never seen Christ in flesh before, but he just stopped and changed my tire." &gt;&gt; Wow. If we read, I want to read part of this Matthew here. Therefore he spoke to them in parables because they seen they see not. This verse 13 and hearing they hear not and neither do they understand. See you can sit in a message church and hear the word that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And to under you can hear it but do you to understand is to comprehend and live it. &gt;&gt; To understand is to change &gt;&gt; to be like it. He said, and you know this was pro verse 14 was it was prophecy that hearing they should hear and not understand and seeing they should see but not perceive. That is sitting in the truth but no life to show for it. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. For verily I say unto you, that many of the prophets and the righteous men would have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them, nor heed those things which ye hear and have not heard them. Amen. You know what they haven't seen? They haven't seen compassion. &gt;&gt; See this supernatural, there was never a supernatural man until Christ came on the earth. There was never a man that went to a woman at the well that had six men. &gt;&gt; There was never a there was never an appointed time. Do you know she was a saraphene the same as a man that waited on the man on the the the wounded and the good Samaritan? &gt;&gt; She was the ones that you're not supposed to be around this well at the same time as me &gt;&gt; because I'm unclean. She was the one that we go &gt;&gt; I never did that. And Jesus just flocked to her. &gt;&gt; And your prophet said that he sent his disciples away because they had a religious spirit on them &gt;&gt; to buy food and they wouldn't accept it. And your prophet also said that when the disciples came back and seen their pastor Jesus Christ talking to a they wondered, they questioned that he would the anointed one. They thought we need to have a business meeting. we need to vote this fool out cuz if he was the anointed one, he would have knew her life. &gt;&gt; And he did. And he went to her. &gt;&gt; Watch this this here. This next one. And and and I just this was I mean this literally I got all of this after like you know 11 11 after 9:00 on Saturday morning. You know, here brother Bram's preaching and he's right ready to preach and actually the people were out of order. They needed to read church order and doctrine. Bless God cuz somebody started speaking in tongues and brother Brandham clearly taught that when a minister's men god only speaks through one person the prophet and brother Brandham commends them. See, you know, when Osman was here, you know, he was showing us stuff. Even sometimes God breaks his own laws. &gt;&gt; Like when he told the prophet Isaiah to take all his clothes off for 30 days. That's breaking your own law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So here, Brother Bram, so somebody, he's right in the middle of preaching. He said, "I wonder right now while the Holy Spirit was just speaking, he was preaching and why he stopped me and let them last remarks." Somebody cut brother Brandham off preaching to speak in tongues. And why he did that was to bring down that I have something that I'm going to say. And he said, "I had something I was going to say about the blood." He said, "I'm right in the middle of preaching." Somebody just burst out and and we know that would be out of order. He taught that in church order and doctrine. But here the brother Brown saying, "Wow, God was in charge." He said, "Why did he do that?" Because he spoke this interpretation so nobody would know. So, so, so, so you would know that it was him speaking. And he gave a witness and said, "Let's worship the prophet. Don't pay no attention to the clay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's the message that's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram's commending it. It was even done outside of church order and doctrine. And it was done through speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; And he said, "God did that so you wouldn't think it was coming out of my mouth and I was special." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I say, let's read on. There it is. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Shake off these shackles and get loose so you really can enter in to shine glory where the shikina fell. And that's the fellowship, the blood of Jesus Christ, making all you Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, and all of you one in Christ Jesus. Amen. And thanks be to God. Oh my brother. H that was good. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. I'm not. I know exactly where I am, but this is a glorious feeling of the spirit of God that's came down here in the the West Coast." And he's talking. Let's jump to the next. And God hopes the word in these visions because he promised it. And while the same God that promised it promised the kind of glory would be in his people. And see, it's the same God that's just in another form. It's the same God just in a another form. Just the same God in another form bringing you another blessing. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. And oh, if I could just if everybody could catch that and get in one accord, wouldn't it be wonderful? Oh, wouldn't it be glorious? The sick would be healed, the lame would walk, and you would the leopard the would the lame would leap and the sinner would be weeping their way to Calvary. The shikina glory falling all around. Wouldn't it even be go home tonight? We wouldn't even leave the church because the presence of God would be so real. Let's go to the next paragraph. Oh, hallelujah. I love him. And his glorious mercy endures forever. And he's truly truly the son of the living God. And Jesus Christ, there's no other. He's the true son of the living God. He's our savior, our healer, our king, our prince, our life, and our joy and our health. And he's all of us. He's all in all of us. He's all in all of us. How wonderful we ought to be willing to present to him and to his people. He's in. Now, I don't think you caught that. He's He's all in all to us. That's the &gt;&gt; That's the Methodist, the Baptist, the Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and the robber on the side of the road. and the woman at the well and the Samaritan. Remember the spirit that Brother Bram said that's around this message is denominating. &gt;&gt; We got it and they don't. &gt;&gt; And that's a denominational spirit. And he said it's denominational walls. And he said, "The reason I hate the denominational spirit is it separates God's people." &gt;&gt; It's doing that in the message ranks. &gt;&gt; In the message ranks, well, I will never go to your camp. Well, I'm not going to your place. Well, well, we believe in, you know, &gt;&gt; we believe we believe it's walls. God never intended that. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can still be my friend. &gt;&gt; You can believe whatever you want. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm preaching the word of God. I'm preaching what the prophet said in the Bible. I mean, I'm preaching what Jesus preached. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. This world's dying for compassion. it. You know, it's like brother Brandt, you don't think Brother Brandham preached message like this. Like remember the the kids that were down the well and they turned the lights out and it was black dark and the one girl started screaming at the top of her lungs. &gt;&gt; And her brother said, you know, he had the Holy Ghost. He was only two, but he had the Holy Ghost. Don't worry, sister. Said they can turn the light on him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I I want somebody that can turn. I want a God with skin on could turn the light on. &gt;&gt; That's what the world's looking for. They're not looking for the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Contrary to your popular belief, don't go to the grocery store and start telling them that God sent a prophet and the seven seals are revealed. &gt;&gt; Hold the door for him. &gt;&gt; Hold the door for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If they only got a couple items, just say, "Add that to my tab." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they'll fall over. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'll fall over and they say, "I never seen a Christ that spoke &gt;&gt; like this ever before." &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I never seen a Christ that ever spoke like this before. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And a lawyer got up and tried to tempt Jesus and said, "What must I do to have eternal life? How would you answer that? Well, you'd have to believe that God sent a prophet. You'd have to have a home church and go to a message tabernacle. You'd have to take communion footwashing. You know, you'd have those are all wonderful and we believe them. But Jesus never answered it that way. Jesus never answered it that way, you know, eternal life. And he never gave him one scripture. I'm like, you're kidding. He never even said, "You must be born again." Which we believe that, and that's Bible. But why didn't Jesus say that? Why? Can somebody help me? Why didn't Jesus say that? &gt;&gt; What must I do to have eternal life? I said, 'Well, you must be born again. What's that mean? Go into my mother's womb and be born out again. No, no, just to speak. &gt;&gt; No, Jesus never said that. &gt;&gt; Compassion. &gt;&gt; No, not I just just a timeout clip here. That wasn't compassion to somebody that you've known in the church for 30 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That would be a big enough shock for most of us. &gt;&gt; But this is somebody that you ain't never seen &gt;&gt; in your life. And Jesus said himself to the lawyer, he said, "You go do this and ye shall live &gt;&gt; and not die." That means you will have eternal life. You just ask yourself, is that what you thought eternal life was? Is that what you think all the message churches and the campaigns and the and the camp meetings and all them are doing around the world is portraying what Jesus said was eternal life. all the great teachers that are getting into the mysteries and the doctrines. The bottom line is the bottom line when you come right down to the bottom of all those mysteries, am I going to be in heaven? &gt;&gt; Am I going to have eternal life? You know what eternal life means? It means you never had a beginning. &gt;&gt; That means you're a part of him. &gt;&gt; The himymn is Jehovah. That's right. So, wow. Brother Osman preached this at the camp meeting and I'm not going to read it. It's a long one. But he said, "We have the order from God to discern spirits." Trying the spirits. It's a great lesson in the church today is to try the spirits of everything. Watch. He says, well, I see trying the spirits of everything and and have discernment of the spirits. I do not think that we should ever by any means judge a person by their doctrine of denomination that they belong to or by what group they're assembled with. We should never judge a man and he names a bunch of churches. But we should judge a man we should never judge a man by his denomination but we should always judge him by his spirit. Now, what did Paul say? I came in spirit and power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I didn't just come with a denomination. He said, see, I never came with wonderful words. That's the denominational creed part. &gt;&gt; Said, but I came in spirit and in power. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I never told you, you know, what all the seven seals is and you know how often you should do communion and whether sisters can wear a hat in church and and you know and and I never I was that was just man's works but I came in spirit and in demonstration of spirit and power. &gt;&gt; He said we should always judge a man by his spirit. I &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a news flash. &gt;&gt; There's people outside of our ranks. &gt;&gt; That could have a better spirit than us. &gt;&gt; And I had somebody come to me one time. I said that about somebody and they said, "We're offended because they don't believe the prophet. And this is the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's the prophet. &gt;&gt; I said right from this pulpit that our neighbors that lived in the house next door have done more for this church and have a better spirit &gt;&gt; than I have sometimes. &gt;&gt; I didn't point to you. &gt;&gt; How I even shock you. I would like to have his Christ. &gt;&gt; And he goes to the Pentecostal church in Victoria. &gt;&gt; And I have somebody that don't come here no more. He said, "I'm offended because you said that because they don't believe in the prophet." &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "It's not where you go to church." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; And you know why it's a spirit? It's because it's a God is a spirit &gt;&gt; and God is love. The very definition of God. How do you describe God? Love. &gt;&gt; Love. And well, how do you describe him physically? Spirit. &gt;&gt; What's the definition of love? Compassion. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Compassion. So, so I could go to the wrong church and have the wrong doctrine, but I got the spirit of love and compassion, &gt;&gt; and God will correct me in his own good time. Oh, this message is the truth, but it don't always have the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Gar. &gt;&gt; I don't always have the right spirit. &gt;&gt; I got Lang staff in me. Bless God. They deserve that. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. There's some more Lang staffs in here. You got a different Lang staff. But &gt;&gt; hello. It's called flesh lang staff. Oh, &gt;&gt; those spirit. &gt;&gt; Judge them by their spirit. &gt;&gt; We are to discern the spirit. You know why the spirit is? Cuz they could have the spirit of Jehovah like the good Samaritan, but he was religiously pagan. And I'm going to just bypass brother Brandon. I'm going to go right to the head. Jesus. And he said, "If you do that, you shall have eternal life." &gt;&gt; That should make you all speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow, verse 12, paragraph 12. Now I want to get this to the church this morning. Which in the different denominations that you're still the church of the living God &gt;&gt; together. Now now you don't have to believe that. But then don't tell me you're a message believer &gt;&gt; because I have a message believer come and say I'm offended because you said that. Because those denominations don't believe in the William Mary Brown. Well, William, Mary, and Brandham said that. &gt;&gt; I'm confused. Sister Patty, I can I come for you for counseling? &gt;&gt; Like, are you tied up Monday about 10? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll bring my wife. I'm like I'm like I'm trying to pull my hair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the thing I want you to get. See that we're really not divided. Oh yes we are. Oh, I'm going to correct the prophet here. Oh yes we are. When's the last time you went to one of those churches? I went Friday night. I normally couldn't say that but my brother had a service. &gt;&gt; You know it won't kill you. &gt;&gt; It actually won't kill you. &gt;&gt; Especially if you're not missing &gt;&gt; a regular service. What's wrong with going on a Friday night or I meant to go Saturday morning but but my anointing was too strong and the way said you got 20 minutes to get dressed and be there and I and I just stayed with my iPad. Sorry, brother Jeff. I I didn't know I was going to lie to you ahead of time, but it was just when it came, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? It's God is a spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. Paul said, "I don't come with creeds and dogmas and fancy words, but in power and demonstration of spirit and power." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Compassion, &gt;&gt; when you pull money out of your pocket for somebody that you ain't never seen before, &gt;&gt; forget it. They don't deserve it. Neither did I. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve Jesus to come &gt;&gt; and be bit, beat, hung on a cross. &gt;&gt; See, now I want to just give you a quick news flash. This is a message. &gt;&gt; Believe in the seals is not the message. &gt;&gt; Even believing the prophet, this is what he said. Oh, I don't you can't you can't all say amen. That would just hurt your constitution. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God for Vicki. I'm going to raise give your race. &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; You don't like that, do you? &gt;&gt; You know why you don't like that? because you have a denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; Help us &gt;&gt; and it's flesh to say, "I'm better than the rest, &gt;&gt; and so I deserve to be promoted." &gt;&gt; But you know what your Bible says? The first shall be last &gt;&gt; and the last shall go first. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hate that scripture. Oh. Oh, I hate that. &gt;&gt; I don't like that one. I tell you what, you won't hear a message like this in most message churches. &gt;&gt; Cuz they don't want you to go to any of those other places. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz they're concerned about that there thing right there. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm just I know I'm a bit stupid. I feel grade one. It took me a couple years to get through grade one, but he ain't buying Nobody's buying me with money. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, if I want to do that, what I just serve the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll give me a lot more stuff than &gt;&gt; See, I never decided to serve God because he would give me money. &gt;&gt; He'd give me blessings, but not necessarily money. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, I'd like to get blessed. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory, &gt;&gt; boys. That's just that's good stuff. Tell you what, you going to put flashing lights on this when you send this message out, Vicki. Say a must listen to the whole world might have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. even message churches &gt;&gt; because you have the message. You have no right to snub anybody. &gt;&gt; You actually should know what it took to save you. &gt;&gt; And you should have more compassion on the ones that ain't received yet. Oh Lord, if you know the Bible says, "Don't reveal the sins of my youth." &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody to know about them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But then you go and put it on Facebook about everything else that everybody else got done wrong. &gt;&gt; That's not my job. &gt;&gt; My job is just banding people up. Yes. &gt;&gt; All these believers I I'm I'm going to close in a couple hours. All these believers and as we could hours and these way a bunch of chance is a bunch of ch change sorry out of your pocket that's in God's hands. And I I've read this one before. I I'm sorry for a repeat. It's been a month or so. &gt;&gt; And you pull all this change out and there's pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters and half dollars. Vicki, but you know, I said a couple of these quotes I'm going to get framed and like 28 by 16 nice letters with clouds over and put them quotes if you want. And then on the top I'm going to put if wanted eternal life. And and there's all this different change. And now that's what the world is in God's hands. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, by the way, this is actually the prophet. And this is a 64 quote. So, this is actually after all the revelation came to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're not going to like that. Oh, you got to get the We got to get the name up there before we leave, Vicki. It's a God's word calls a total separation from unbelief. You thought unbelief was not believing the message. This was unbelief right here. Now, that's what the world is in God's hands. And some people are just a pennies worth and God can only use them for a penny away and all that they can buy. But don't reject them. &gt;&gt; Oh, they don't come to us. They don't come to Wyoming, Sister Donna. They don't come there. They don't come here. I'm not going to talk to them. I'm not going to talk to them. They never came to my company. &gt;&gt; Oh, but the prophet said &gt;&gt; it didn't matter. It didn't matter. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth." And the message is the real truth. &gt;&gt; Don't turn them down. &gt;&gt; Don't turn them down. &gt;&gt; Don't kick them up. You know, Moses never got to go to the promised land, but Moses is saved. &gt;&gt; Saw God pulled his spirit off of Saul. Saul was a dummy. He was a real dummy. He was concerned about popularity. What a dummy. and he lost everything. God calls the spirit off Saul, &gt;&gt; but Saul was with the prophet. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't turn them down. Don't kick them out." Oh, well, you already done that. Sorry, God. &gt;&gt; And say that they're not in it. Well, no, of course they're not in it because they don't know the God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said, "I'm confused. Because God uses pennies. &gt;&gt; A lot was just a penny and Abraham was a silver dollar. So it taken 100 lots to make an Abraham. Now this is in a 64. Do you know this is about a year after the seals were revealed? &gt;&gt; Can you believe it? You can't believe it. I can tell. &gt;&gt; I wish somebody say amen. I got to get my poster up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that. &gt;&gt; You don't live like you believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Most of your associates don't live like they believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Most of the places you would go to visit church don't believe like they believe that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is after the seals people. This is after the fullness of the godhead bodily had come and revelation and visions to our prophet. &gt;&gt; I know what you're thinking. He must have made a mistake. &gt;&gt; Well, if that's what you think, just help make yourself happy. Second Ephesians or Ephesians 2 8 and 10. For by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourself. It is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 64 and6 says that your righteousness of being a message believer is like filthy rags in God's nose. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Do you want eternal life?" &gt;&gt; Who's your neighbor? Your neighbor is somebody that you don't know. &gt;&gt; That's right. Your neighbor is somebody you've never seen. &gt;&gt; I mean, it might be somebody you've seen, but it could be somebody you've never seen. &gt;&gt; The lawyer asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?" &gt;&gt; And he went into the parable about the guy that was robbed on the road. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Never seen him. Never ever ever ever seen him before. Compassion. is filthy rags and we fade away real quick. Verse seven, and none are called upon my name as stirth up him, taketh hold of thee. I want to jump to verse eight there. But now, oh Lord, thou art our father, and we are the clay, and thou art the potter, and we are all the work. and we are all the work of thy hand. &gt;&gt; Our next example of our prophet, another new one I've never read to you before. Well, the more than a disgrace to Jesus Christ is the church in disunityity. And it's just about the coming of the Lord to loose. It's the very next quote on my thing. More than a disgrace to Jesus Christ. More than a disgrace. Let that sink in for a minute. It's more than a disgrace to Jesus Christ. By the way, this is your prophet saying this. And it's almost the end of the Lord coming. and he's loosened the antichrist spirit on the earth and we are separated with denominational &gt;&gt; barriers. I'm a Methodist. I'm a oneness. You couldn't shake my I'm a b Oh, maybe I did read this one before. I just remembered I put in these brackets. I believe in church order. I'm assembly of God. I'm in United Pentecostal. I believe in tongues and prophecy. And I don't believe in there's no more grace. It's all over. And we're all separated by our It isn't all over, by the way. But see, we built up walls. &gt;&gt; We built up walls. And we can't even visit each other's household some of the time because we got walls. &gt;&gt; Walls, &gt;&gt; but we don't have compassion. &gt;&gt; And what is any of us? Nothing. But what God would let us be. It's all by the grace of God. You know today, your revelation today is by the grace. Blessed are you, Simon Barjonah. Blessed are you. Put your name in there. For God revealed what he has to you. &gt;&gt; But what are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; It's a condition of the heart. &gt;&gt; If you're arrogant, you're not even converted. &gt;&gt; You're not even converted. Well, well, let you can break that down. Did Christ Jesus come to the earth arrogant? &gt;&gt; And in all the grace of God, so let's look to him and praise him. He said, "Now we deal with all you bunches." And that's right. He said, "I care the sponsors of the meetings." And he said, "It doesn't make any difference to me." He said, "I'm glad that one then the other can do it, but it doesn't matter to me. I don't even know which is which and where it is. I don't care as long as you're a Christian. As long as you love the Lord. If you love I love you. And if you don't love the Lord, I love you anyway. Oh, that's &gt;&gt; that's weird. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to do what? When we meet one another on the street. Oh, he's going right back to the good Samaritan. Have the greatest compassion, fellowship, and fellowship. And prayer meeting, prayer meeting together. And if you'll do this, it'll break down the barriers. And God won't have some of these people going around the country that have a lot of inspirations and you'll be it'll be him. Amen. &gt;&gt; My last scripture and I got part two. Praise God for part two. It saved the day. Isaiah 41. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed. Verse 10. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. I will help thee, and yay, I will uphold thee with the right hand of thy fellowship. Now, I want to just jump down. I might read this next Sunday, but I want to jump to 17 because we need to close. Amen. That we a lot longer than the service we were at the other night. Amen. And when the poor and needy seek water, there is none. and their tongue faileth for thirst. I the Lord will hear them. I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys. And I will make the wilderness a pool of water in the dry lands a spring of water. And I will plant the wilderness with cedar trees, cedar and different trees and murf and the oil trees. And I will set in the desert fig trees and the pine and the box trees together that they may see and know and consider and understand together that it was God. It was the hand of the Lord that hath done this and the Holy One of Israel has created him. I'll do this so the world will know and they will see that it's not natural &gt;&gt; to have compassion &gt;&gt; to have brotherly kindness. It's not natural &gt;&gt; but it's eternal life. &gt;&gt; It is completely. What must I do to be saved? Love thy neighbor &gt;&gt; with action. &gt;&gt; Love thy neighbor with action. Let's stand. Vanessa, we need you to come sing this song. &gt;&gt; Put the words up if we got it. There's somebody out there hurt and confused. That just about explains everybody in the world. If you're not hurt, you're confused. An innocent child that's being abused. There's somebody out there whose heart is broken in two. Wow. There's somebody out there. The whole world is feeling alone. A husband, a wife being done wrong. [Music] There's somebody out there that's scattered from a broken home. Do you know a broken home is about 70 high 70s maybe low 80s%. What are you doing about it? Yeah, it's our job to do something about it. At least go there and show compassion. I didn't say counsel them. I said just go and show compassion. There's somebody broken and Christ's spirit wants to minister to them through you. Through you. What do you want to do to have eternal life? There's somebody out there with arms wide open wide who longs to embrace you, draw the tears from your eyes. He's hope for the hopeless. There's just one person that qualifies for that. Christ. &gt;&gt; He'll carry your burdens. And when you don't have a prayer, there's just one person you can ask. He's your best friend. Christ. And Christ is walking. He's still in flesh. Oh yeah. He's very much in flesh today. You know, the Bible says he's always had a person. He's always had Elijah the prophet thought that he was the only one. He's I got 700 ain't bowed to kneel to bail. He's always had people that were packing him. Wow. God bless you. Let's sing this song. We don't have the words. &gt;&gt; There's somebody out there hurting and confused. an innocent person being abused. There's somebody out there whose heart is breaking into. There's somebody out there feeling alone, a husband, a wife being done wrong. There's somebody out there shattered from a broken home. But there's somebody out there with arms open wide who longs to embrace you dry the tears from your eyes. He's hope for the hopeless. He'll carry the burdens you bear when you don't have a prayer. There's somebody out there. There's somebody out there who thought it was cool to keep taking chances, thinking they'd never lose. Now they're hooked on a feeling that's left them emptied and full. There's somebody out there who can't quite decide whether to live or whether to die. They're searching for strength to get through their crisis in life. But there's somebody out there with arms open wide who longs to embrace you, dry the tears from your eyes. He's hope for the hopeless. He'll carry the burdens you bear. When you don't have a prayer, there's somebody out there. There's somebody out there with arms open wide who longs to embrace you, dry the tears from your eyes. He's hope for the hopeless. He'll carry the burdens you bear. When you don't have a prayer, there's somebody out there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord God, Lord, you know, you know, you gave me all of this this morning. I couldn't even begin to put that together. And Lord, we're sorry that we've missed the mark. Your prophet said, "We've missed what God planned for the church by a million miles. We've missed evangelizing the world. We've missed showing the world who Christ is." He said, "After 2,000 years plus, twothirds of the world have never heard the name of Jesus Christ." And yet, every other religion has done way better. That's false. Forgive us, Lord God. Brother, your prophet, you've seen those 340ome quotes I was trying to get through. He said, "We fell asleep. We were laying on the ground. We'd missed it by millions and millions of miles, sharing the gospel of Christ, which was eternal life in compassion." [Music] Wow. Forgive me, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Jesus. What must we do to have eternal life? If you do these things, you can go and live. God, we just ask that you would show us this here this morning and and just help us to realize the truth and the seriousness and the and your plan. What it was that you didn't come just with words and fancy speech and memorized phrases, but you came in power and demonstration of the spirit, compassion to show who the real God was, the real spirit of Christ, that he'd go to a woman at the well. He'd minister to the heart of the hurt and the lonely, to the woman caught in the very act. And he would say, "Where is your accusers?" We know that Satan is the accuser of the brethren. God, help us to see what you plan, what you thought we would live. Help us to have your nature, your spirit to walk like you would walk, talk like you would talk. What would you do? What would you do if we pass a robber on the road who's bleeding to almost left for dead? Help us, Jesus. Help me, Lord God. Lord, we pray for Jeff this Monday as he goes for surgery, his hernas. Lord God, we just pray that you'll be with the doctors and just may it be a a a wonderful healing for our brother, Lord God. And Lord, every need that's represented here, I pray that you would meet it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Be great.
