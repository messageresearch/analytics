[23:46] get down there my goodness we were just

[23:52] and bless them and also remember John
[23:54] Blackman we went and seen him we hadn't
[23:57] seen them for a few weeks and and we
[24:01] just could not believe
[24:03] we were just
[24:05] we were just
[24:07] couldn't believe how he failed
[24:10] just couldn't believe it we were very
[24:13] naive I guess sir something like we we
[24:16] don't like staying at the home because
[24:18] you got to wear a mask in the home and
[24:20] so we always pick them up and they
[24:22] brought them out in the wheelchair
[24:22] sometimes to do that just for
[24:24] convenience
[24:25] but so we just properly threw him in the
[24:28] car and took him to the restaurant we
[24:29] can't walk
[24:31] so me and the wind carried them in the
[24:32] restaurant
[24:33] and it was just
[24:43] very
[24:44] very sad
[24:48] I'm very sad
[24:51] of course he was just humiliated and
[24:54] embarrassed
[24:57] but you know if we don't go in a Rapture
[25:00] we're all going that way
[25:01] man
[25:03] you know it was amazing me and Lynn
[25:05] would have our arms under his arms you
[25:07] know to to
[25:10] basically
[25:12] carry him
[25:13] and he just couldn't make his feet move
[25:16] and then like once every five minutes he
[25:18] could take two big steps
[25:21] it was just but then
[25:24] he couldn't they just went to work
[25:27] I couldn't imagine you know he's got his
[25:29] own room in his apartment it's kind of a
[25:31] kind of a you know it's kind of a lift
[25:34] separate live up you know old age home
[25:37] you know
[25:38] I couldn't imagine being in your own
[25:40] room but you can't go to the bathroom
[25:42] you mean you're 10 feet from the toilet
[25:44] but you can't get to the toilet it's
[25:46] just
[25:47] it's just very sad and
[25:49] so just remember them and of course he
[25:51] he has nobody that goes sees him almost
[25:54] at all
[25:55] except us
[25:57] that Chris had been there one time since
[25:59] he'd been the homeless son so it's it's
[26:00] sad amen how you treat your kids they'll
[26:03] pick your old age home and they'll
[26:06] they'll be the ones as many times as you
[26:08] take them on a holiday that's how many
[26:09] times they'll come and visit you Jared
[26:10] in the home big same amount you know
[26:13] amen
[26:14] it's very different amen it's just but
[26:18] anyway let's just remember brother John
[26:19] and you know he he would be here if he
[26:22] could walk you know and but uh that was
[26:25] just uh also you know we fellowship and
[26:28] some with Kathy and Steve and trying to
[26:31] show them love and and support and and

[26:36] bless you brother Evanson all year and
[26:39] just just good to be in the house of God
[26:42] amen uh let's just turn to scripture
[26:45] just pray for me I I'm sure I got way
[26:47] more than
[26:49] uh I could ever use but uh let's go to
[26:52] First Corinthians
[26:53] First Corinthians 15 51-54.
[26:59] and yeah I'm very much looking forward
[27:01] to the our weekend amen and Alex oh

[27:21] put the holes in the ceiling there was a
[27:24] can only imagine what the church looked
[27:25] like and it was probably worse than that
[27:27] it was uh it was drywall everywhere
[27:32] amen but we
[27:34] by God's grace strike to make it a
[27:36] little brighter in here
[27:38] hey man so uh
[27:43] I wanna or God wants to take just a
[27:46] little different way I believe and you
[27:49] know a minister
[27:50] you know I have no idea how
[27:53] it you know it's just amazing when you
[27:55] surrendered God you know I don't know

[27:59] down 10 scriptures I don't know which
[28:00] ones

[28:04] preach on positivity
[28:06] positive
[28:09] man
[28:11] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[28:14] all sleep but we shall be changed
[28:18] Hallelujah in a moment in the twinkling
[28:20] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[28:23] trumpet shall sound and the dead in
[28:25] Christ shall rise incorruptable and we
[28:28] shall be changed Hallelujah greatest
[28:31] promise of all for this corruptable must
[28:34] put on incorruption and this Mortal must
[28:37] put on in mortality
[28:40] so then this incorrupt disruptible shall
[28:44] have put on incorruption and this Mortal
[28:47] shall have put on in mortality then
[28:49] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[28:52] it is written

[29:12] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[29:15] things are pure and whatsoever things
[29:17] are lovely
[29:18] whatsoever things are of good report if
[29:21] there be any virtue in them

[29:27] think on these things Lord Jesus we ask
[29:30] you to bless the word bless your bride
[29:32] together in your name we pray amen amen
[29:36] you may have your seats I want to read a
[29:39] quote here that the prophet said right
[29:41] off the beginning and you know this is
[29:43] uh you know you you've heard so much of
[29:47] the the word of God Amen and just
[29:49] wonderful
[29:51] a wonderful wonderful stuff you know but
[29:54] I want to I want to show a different or
[29:56] God wants to show a different maybe uh
[29:59] thought that we haven't heard in a long
[30:01] time and and here here's a quote from
[30:04] the spiritual signs of the times it's a
[30:06] 64 quote neither will we ever make a
[30:10] believer
[30:11] as long as you're afraid to exercise The
[30:15] Authority that's been given to us by
[30:18] Jesus Christ
[30:20] we have the victory
[30:23] amen we don't have to have anything we
[30:27] don't have to have to fight for the
[30:30] victory we already have the victory he
[30:33] conquered us
[30:36] not
[30:37] he conquered for us not us but he
[30:40] conquered for us and we're not the
[30:43] mighty conqueror but he
[30:46] God is a mighty conqueror and you know
[30:49] we've heard it and you know in our flesh
[30:51] we want to the denomination of the world
[30:53] want to be saved by works and we think
[30:56] the more we do for God we're going to be
[30:58] saved and I know I know if you balance
[31:01] that the scripture says well faith
[31:03] without works is dead but I want to show
[31:05] you this morning
[31:07] that the only thing that God wants from
[31:10] you
[31:11] the only thing he don't need your Works
[31:14] he wants your adoring he wants your love
[31:17] he wants your admiration he wants you to
[31:20] call out to him and worship that's what
[31:22] he wants he wants you to in the natural
[31:24] just saying in the natural relationship
[31:26] he wants to Puff him up it's worship
[31:30] amen you know I look in the scripture
[31:33] and we will turn to hear and II
[31:35] Chronicles here here was Jehoshaphat and
[31:38] they were going to war and hear the
[31:40] mobates that the Emirates and the Moa
[31:43] Emmons were coming against them and he
[31:46] was in Jerusalem and Jericho and and he
[31:49] cried out to God they realize that their
[31:52] armies were three times what their army
[31:54] was and Jehoshaphat went to God and said
[31:57] God he said don't you aren't we yours
[31:59] and aren't you going to save us and I
[32:02] want to show you maybe we can turn to
[32:03] that scripture and just lay a real good
[32:05] second chronicles 20 Amy
[32:10] excuse me
[32:12] 15 and 17 and I love this he said here's
[32:17] God talking he said hearken Ye Old Judah
[32:20] and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[32:23] and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the
[32:27] Lord unto you be not afraid be not
[32:31] dismayed by the reason of the great
[32:34] multitude just preacher that in this
[32:37] world of the world's gone crazy covet
[32:40] and and War and rumors of wars and and
[32:44] you know everything is your your motive
[32:46] to look at it how how do you perceive
[32:48] you know I can look at all the rumors of
[32:51] the war and say praise God my Redemption
[32:53] draweth night other people say oh I'm
[32:55] afraid I'm going to get blown up no we
[32:58] have the greatest hope of all amen it
[33:00] was all that it was you know the stories
[33:02] of multiple stories I I'll just stop in
[33:05] here and think you know like the boys
[33:07] that were were asking for a pony at
[33:09] Christmas and their daddy never put
[33:11] nothing for under the house for him
[33:13] except the pile of pony waste and the
[33:17] one boy came and he said oh no he said
[33:18] we got stuff to clean out of the shed
[33:20] and the other boy said whether it's Pony
[33:22] waste there's got to be a a pony hey man
[33:25] you're going to look at the wars and
[33:26] just say well we're going to get blown
[33:28] up and the other one can say is we're
[33:30] going to be in a Rapture before we're
[33:31] blowing up amen it's all in your
[33:34] perception of positive and this is not
[33:37] this ain't no new age teaching this
[33:39] ain't no garbage of thing the our
[33:42] Prophet talked about that
[33:44] and you know we in a new age World there
[33:46] everything oh positive and no we're not
[33:48] talking about that we're talking about
[33:50] being positive on the word of God all
[33:53] the all things work together for good to
[33:55] them that love God that means if your
[33:57] your child dies it's still God's good if
[34:00] your parent dies I was for God's good
[34:02] that's not looking at the time frame if
[34:05] the the bombs if Russia bombs that's
[34:06] good do I understand that no I don't
[34:09] understand that if Kim Jones bombs North
[34:12] Korea south or vice versa that's good
[34:15] how's that good because we're going to
[34:16] go home it's are they say in our homes
[34:19] we forget we're on a holiday we're in a
[34:22] holiday and we're in Canada or
[34:24] Uganda or wherever we're at this is just
[34:27] a holiday but our real home was where we
[34:29] always were before the foundation of the
[34:32] world and so when you perceive and so
[34:34] where where God's thoughts was we're at
[34:37] the Rapture time we are in the Rapture
[34:39] actually we're not just in the time of
[34:41] the Rapture raptures in process right
[34:43] now
[34:44] amen it's in process it's beautiful but
[34:48] for the Rapture to be in process there's
[34:51] going to be people that are going to be
[34:53] destroyed and the worth of the world is
[34:55] going to be blown to blythereens and
[34:57] this is not going to be our hold and
[35:00] your big fancy house farmer whoever pick
[35:03] up it's gonna be burnt amen it's 30.
[35:07] it's 30 if it's clean it's still dirty
[35:11] it's sin dirty
[35:13] you look at all these terrible things so
[35:15] you say well praise God I live in the
[35:17] Rapture Day and then you open the news
[35:19] go
[35:23] but you got to get to a state where it's
[35:25] still positive and I have no money I'm
[35:28] still happy
[35:29] if I have no Farms I'm still happy I'm
[35:32] going in a Rapture my goal is Rapture
[35:36] Rapture Rapture if Kim this world you
[35:40] just watch everything's about to blow up
[35:43] every day
[35:45] Russia I just and I'm not dwelling on
[35:47] this our Prophet talked about the slots
[35:50] mad
[35:52] do you know the prophet talked about
[35:53] bombs in the hangar
[35:55] s hundreds of times
[35:58] well they're not just in the hangar now
[36:01] they're in the planes that are flying
[36:03] over
[36:07] our Prophet could talk about it in the
[36:08] 60s and 50s we surely can talk about it
[36:11] 2023.
[36:14] you know Russia has proved that it was
[36:16] England Britain that that
[36:18] um their gas line in Russia is actually
[36:21] threatening what they they promised them
[36:23] to repay them for their things Kim Jones
[36:27] sought 38 missiles in the 20 days some
[36:30] of them raid over top of Japan's Island
[36:33] he's gone Google and North Korea was
[36:36] doing alliance with with the states and
[36:40] and with that and you can go oh or you
[36:43] can look at that go oh thank you Lord
[36:46] thank you Lord it's just going to be
[36:48] three or four more days five or six more
[36:51] days
[36:52] amen
[36:54] positive oh then how you look at it you
[36:56] know the stories told about the the
[36:58] farmer that you know that Brother David
[37:00] deanheart mentioned this 25 years ago
[37:03] and it shot him and preached a message
[37:04] on the farmer that had a a well and the
[37:07] donkey fell in the well
[37:09] and he had no way to get the donkey out
[37:11] of the well he tried to pull the donkey
[37:14] pull his head off you pull his neck he
[37:16] couldn't throw a rope around the donkey
[37:17] drag him out he'd he'd be hung before he
[37:19] got him out
[37:20] he didn't know how to get the donkey out
[37:22] of the well
[37:23] he said well I guess all I can do is
[37:25] just bury the Donkey
[37:26] and so he started throwing on the
[37:28] donkeys and the donkey all the people
[37:32] that were throwing darts at him
[37:34] the dog he said yes master here this
[37:36] master I've done everything my whole
[37:37] life to God and he said throwing mud on
[37:39] me
[37:42] that's what Satan's taught some of us
[37:44] before
[37:45] oh I've done all this for God and I've
[37:47] got the hard troubles
[37:50] and the donkey just realized that if he
[37:53] just shook his shook his back shook it
[37:55] off he kept stepping up
[37:57] and in a few years he just walked right
[37:59] out in a rat trap
[38:01] but of his attitude would oh and my
[38:03] master turned against me and he buried
[38:06] me alive
[38:10] it was all your perception
[38:13] of positivity
[38:14] you know not that we not that we look to
[38:17] secular people but Albert Einstein is
[38:20] quoted this he said stay away from
[38:22] negative people they always have a
[38:24] problem for every solution
[38:29] they always have a problem for every
[38:31] solution
[38:32] amen
[38:34] but as our Prophet said birds with
[38:36] feathers flock together
[38:37] I don't want to be known as the
[38:39] negativity of it I don't want to our
[38:40] Prophet said I don't want to grow up to
[38:42] be the old grouch
[38:44] amen
[38:45] in everything that could be at
[38:48] everything it can be like a flower
[38:49] garden beautiful old age can be
[38:51] beautiful age it's all beautiful but
[38:54] it's Rapture time
[38:56] dropped your time look at the world and
[38:58] say oh man everything you say oh praise
[39:01] God I think you come today
[39:03] you know our Prophet spoke exactly like
[39:06] that in the 60s
[39:08] he would he would be planning meetings
[39:10] next week and he said well Lord willing
[39:11] we'll be here but if the Lord don't come
[39:14] that was a long time ago
[39:18] that was a long time ago
[39:21] and this is where we offend God
[39:25] he's all the promises in the book are
[39:27] for us
[39:29] and we're believers
[39:31] and you know the prophet said this he
[39:33] said the word of God is inside the bride
[39:37] and they have they know what Christ
[39:40] wants them to do with it
[39:42] that's what he said
[39:44] so if God says that these things are
[39:47] going to happen
[39:48] and you get sad about it
[39:53] God's like I told them what I was going
[39:55] to do
[39:57] and they're upset with me
[40:00] I told him I was going to send words and
[40:02] rumors of War before before I came and
[40:04] get them the other thing and all the
[40:06] bride's upset
[40:08] I told him that the world economic Forum
[40:10] was gonna or your your money was you
[40:13] couldn't take it with you
[40:15] and the Believers are upset
[40:18] and I told them to lay up Treasures
[40:20] where moth and rust not corrupt but and
[40:22] thieves don't break through and steal
[40:24] and people are building big kingdoms and
[40:26] and
[40:28] and they're upset
[40:31] and they're upset and God says but I'm
[40:35] confused
[40:38] huh
[40:39] think of this you know just let's read
[40:43] that quote again neither will we ever
[40:45] make a Believer you'll never be a
[40:47] believer as long as you're afraid
[40:50] of exercising the authority
[40:53] that Jesus Christ has given you
[40:57] wow
[40:59] our Prophet said it like this for your
[41:01] salvation for your family
[41:03] or for healing or this he said picture
[41:06] it like this that I invite you over for
[41:08] supper
[41:09] and the table spread with all kinds of
[41:11] nice good food
[41:13] and you would like some steak at the
[41:16] other end
[41:17] you just said brother Dale could I
[41:19] please have some steak
[41:20] it's already there
[41:23] it's all it's already there you can see
[41:25] it you just have to ask for it
[41:27] you said he said that's all this he said
[41:30] Lord Jesus could I please have the
[41:32] healing of this thank you Lord I'll I'll
[41:35] fill my plate really full with that
[41:38] good I had the salvation of my family
[41:41] they're your heritage thank you Lord
[41:43] I'll put an extra scoop onto that plate
[41:47] no problem no fear totally positive
[41:49] don't matter how they're living don't
[41:51] matter how many bombs they're scaring up
[41:53] no matter who's going to who and where
[41:55] is going what in the world politics no
[41:58] matter who's the leader of Canada the
[42:00] next leader probably won't be no better
[42:02] you know see because we're a Triune
[42:04] being so so will you watch this when
[42:06] when I say I tell my kids this I said
[42:08] now listen don't go on that because you
[42:10] know the Bible don't lie
[42:13] the borrower is a slave to the lender
[42:16] so when Things Fall Apart you will
[42:17] become a slave if you're a borrower
[42:22] but on the other side
[42:23] when you look at it spiritually
[42:25] anything in this world
[42:27] don't matter
[42:29] see you you like we're in God's head see
[42:32] the footsteps of the righteous are
[42:34] ordered of the Lord
[42:35] amen
[42:38] you just like it's time that we took God
[42:40] at his word
[42:42] amen that's Psalms 37 23 such as
[42:46] steps footsteps of a good man
[42:50] are ordered of the Lord
[42:53] we need to be as Christians we should
[42:56] most positive people in the world when
[42:59] we go to the grocery store your your
[43:01] ears should be in the way because you're
[43:03] smiling so big
[43:04] everybody's in there like I'm buying
[43:06] water for next month
[43:09] and flour for
[43:11] I don't think I can eat my house I'm not
[43:13] worried if I can heat my house
[43:16] I probably won't be in my house if I
[43:18] can't heat my house
[43:22] amen
[43:23] don't don't build your hopes on this
[43:26] world
[43:27] man we're going home
[43:30] this is Rapture time not all are going
[43:33] to sleep
[43:36] that's Jesus saying
[43:38] we're not all going to go to sleep
[43:41] and if we do we're going to rise first
[43:45] amen
[43:46] the prophet talked about the the
[43:48] positive New Age thinking he said that
[43:50] was always I word oh and I think but I'm
[43:54] talking about being positive to God's
[43:55] promises
[43:58] just saying okay
[44:00] I want to stink you and show you
[44:02] Jehoshaphat you know some people and and
[44:05] I understand but back to this
[44:08] faith without works is dead I want to
[44:10] show you that in this Army of
[44:12] Jehoshaphat
[44:14] maybe I better finish reading it
[44:17] thus saith the Lord unto you be Not
[44:20] Afraid nor dismayed for the reason of
[44:22] the great multitude or for the Bible
[44:26] it ain't yours
[44:31] you were worrying about
[44:33] really
[44:36] for what
[44:42] it's not yours but God's now now this is
[44:44] God himself talking here let's go to uh
[44:49] let's go to 17. we're going to skip a
[44:51] verse God's just telling them in the
[44:52] next verse where the enemy's coming down
[44:58] for ye need not need okay no no I
[45:02] mentioned about faith without works is
[45:03] that look at this scripture and say how
[45:05] much did God need them
[45:08] mm-hmm
[45:10] for ye shall not need to fight in this
[45:12] battle
[45:14] that's how much God needed them
[45:17] now remember before that josephite
[45:19] called out God said God we need you to
[45:22] take care of us that's all God wanted
[45:25] you don't need to do no swinging
[45:27] God will do the swinging
[45:30] amen and if you read further down in
[45:32] this scripture he says I through the
[45:33] battle in fact I got that verse verse 30
[45:36] after we'll go down to that said God
[45:38] gave Jehoshaphat and the children of
[45:40] Israel perfect rest
[45:43] the Holy Ghost
[45:45] and a rapture
[45:47] if everything falls down around you
[45:49] you're going there
[45:52] before the foundation of the world it
[45:54] like I didn't he didn't trust nobody
[45:57] else for this Covenant he come down
[45:59] himself
[46:01] oh hallelujah amen
[46:04] amen
[46:06] for there's no need for you to fight in
[46:08] this battle set yourself and stand still
[46:10] and see the salvation of the Lord with
[46:14] you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not
[46:19] I I really believe this verse is good
[46:21] for today
[46:23] be good for today you know I was in the
[46:25] news this week and I was showing all the
[46:27] armies there's literally about six
[46:29] countries in the army that would like to
[46:30] go to war with one another
[46:32] and I say please do and hurry
[46:37] you know and you can watch people you
[46:39] say oh that's sometimes my kids will
[46:41] come in and they'll see me on something
[46:42] they said I don't want to hear no more
[46:43] of this craziness
[46:45] but if you look at a depositive way this
[46:47] world has to get crazy before we go home
[46:50] our Prophet said that the world would go
[46:54] to incomplete complete Insanity
[46:57] I say it's arrived but we're not gone
[47:00] home yet so it's still got to get a
[47:01] little bit more insane
[47:06] if you want to see how insane it is
[47:08] leave your kids at home for goodness
[47:10] sake if you if you listen to anything a
[47:12] pastor says to you don't send your kids
[47:14] to public school system and you go
[47:16] yourself and investigate
[47:18] you know we had some parents telling us
[47:20] like you know like
[47:22] well we we had different beliefs out
[47:24] well you know well I don't have no
[47:26] choices so I'll send my kids to the
[47:27] public school system got to take care of
[47:29] them listen that's a lie
[47:31] and if you don't like it it's still a
[47:34] lie
[47:35] you know our Prophet said that there's
[47:37] places that God won't go with you
[47:44] if you can send your kids to public
[47:46] school then I could go to strip joint
[47:52] literally
[47:55] because I watch this thing this week
[47:57] where a boy born a boy was feeling like
[48:01] a girl
[48:02] and the girls in the basketball team
[48:04] were all in with no clothes on showering
[48:06] and the boy was investigating but he
[48:09] wasn't a boy but he was born a boy but
[48:11] he thought he was a girl and the girls
[48:13] felt really uncomfortable about that
[48:15] and there's a message Believers has told
[48:17] me and my wife well like what am I
[48:19] supposed to do I send my kids no
[48:25] God will protect you if you might go to
[48:28] the grocery store and there's I'm sorry
[48:31] and there's something bad going on there
[48:33] but God don't protect you when you don't
[48:35] have to go to a place listen listen to
[48:38] me brothers and sisters there was not
[48:40] always Public School Systems
[48:45] it's a parent's responsibility to teach
[48:48] their kids when Jesus was here on Earth
[48:50] Jesus was here on Earth did they have
[48:52] Public School Systems
[48:56] Public School Systems come out when the
[48:59] government
[49:01] and the Catholic Church said give me
[49:03] your kids till they're seven and I'll
[49:04] have them their whole life
[49:10] you can say oh bless God I'm a minister
[49:12] of the Gospel I have the token or me I
[49:14] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[49:16] I'm going to go to the bar and preach I
[49:17] don't think so
[49:19] I don't think so because guess what my
[49:21] Holy Ghost will stop right outside the
[49:23] door
[49:25] that's where that's where he will kids
[49:26] he won't go in there
[49:28] because he's not invited
[49:31] he wasn't invited in the denominational
[49:33] churches how in the world do you think
[49:36] he's invited in
[49:37] uh-huh
[49:40] this is the only age where God was on
[49:43] the outside of the churches knock you
[49:45] please let me back in and you think
[49:46] you're going to go to a public place
[49:48] God's going to be there
[49:51] never
[49:53] never
[49:56] because
[49:58] see he'll protect you where you have to
[50:01] okay but not where you don't have to
[50:06] that's the same thing with that people
[50:08] would say well God give me this
[50:10] wonderful job and I can never make
[50:12] Church
[50:14] you're insulting my God
[50:17] because the same God said don't never
[50:19] forsake the summoning of yourself
[50:20] together like unlike some matter like
[50:22] some have but to gather all the more as
[50:25] you see the day approach them but God
[50:26] give me a job that I can never Assemble
[50:28] no no no my God's a lot smarter than
[50:33] amen
[50:35] amen see God gets blamed first things
[50:37] you know me I don't know where that came
[50:39] from but that's free but see here what
[50:42] how God was fighting their battle you
[50:44] know people I've seen people I've had
[50:46] people tell me Well you mean to tell me
[50:48] there ain't nothing you got to do let me
[50:51] I love our Prophet this is what our
[50:53] Prophet said you need to do
[50:56] our Prophet said there was he said I see
[50:58] hundreds of times he said this nothing
[51:01] left
[51:02] nothing left to do
[51:05] but the rapture
[51:07] and the only thing you had to do
[51:10] was surrender or ripen
[51:12] that's it
[51:13] he preached the sermon he mentioned it
[51:15] multiple times I can hear the sound of
[51:17] the combine coming
[51:18] can hear the combine
[51:21] I just got done harvesting all my crop
[51:23] this is this week
[51:25] [Music]
[51:28] Prophet could hear the sound of the
[51:29] combine
[51:30] and what he could hear the sound of the
[51:32] combine the bride was right for the
[51:35] Harvest
[51:36] was right for the Harvest we're right
[51:38] for the Harvest
[51:40] don't don't look for God to send another
[51:43] Prophet to send another message another
[51:46] more of God to send more power are you
[51:50] kidding us our Prophet said God's done
[51:52] everything he give himself
[51:56] he's give us and this he said all the
[51:58] prophets and apostles and all the other
[52:00] ages want to live right here
[52:03] because all the Mysteries are received
[52:06] you know what water baptism is you know
[52:08] what difference he did you know what the
[52:09] godhead is they're all revealed there's
[52:11] no Mysteries
[52:14] you went to marriage of the lamest you
[52:16] know who's the wife that's going to be
[52:18] made ready
[52:19] it's a made herself ready to go in the
[52:21] rapture
[52:22] all in this age
[52:25] we should be the most positive people
[52:29] a most positive we should be beside
[52:31] ourselves happy
[52:34] in a world that's in dismay
[52:37] amen
[52:40] positive
[52:46] I started to say I've seen people that
[52:49] they feel like
[52:50] the Raptors close by
[52:52] they said well
[52:54] I we should be doing something we should
[52:57] but those people never come to prayer
[52:59] meetings by the way
[53:01] if you want to do anything you could
[53:03] pray more that's the only thing we
[53:04] couldn't do too much of but these people
[53:06] want to build more schools or build more
[53:08] churches or go on more Mission field
[53:11] trips or preach more sermons
[53:13] the prophet said you could do they may
[53:15] all be good he said I'm not talking
[53:16] against them
[53:18] but the only thing you couldn't do was
[53:20] pray too much because prayer humbles
[53:23] your soul if prayer makes you right for
[53:27] Harvest prayer right for the combine he
[53:30] said this is how much you need to do
[53:32] because oh like oh the Rapture is coming
[53:35] next week I better get my loved ones
[53:37] saved
[53:38] really so you're the one saving them
[53:42] God already
[53:47] huh
[53:48] what's how he says he says oh Judah and
[53:50] Jerusalem fear not nor to be dismayed
[53:52] for tomorrow go out against them and the
[53:56] Lord will be with you
[53:58] and amen he he did your fighting they he
[54:01] said in the beginning he said you will
[54:03] not need to fight
[54:05] set yourself out and stand still and see
[54:08] the salvation of God what you need to do
[54:11] this day it's just that
[54:14] just that
[54:16] just then and you'll get when you're
[54:18] standing you'll get ripened by the ass
[54:20] so when the Son of God will ripen you
[54:23] and humble you and the combine of come
[54:26] and harvest you
[54:28] and all the shaft
[54:31] and all the green stuff
[54:35] blown out the bat
[54:37] but you'll go in the gardener
[54:39] Matt
[54:40] amen see
[54:42] a Christian
[54:45] you know the Bible says God's not given
[54:47] us a spirit of fear
[54:49] but a Christian can't be negative
[54:54] that God's not giving a spirit of fear
[54:56] about love power and a sound mind
[54:58] you should be in this end time age I'm
[55:01] preaching this because it's going to get
[55:03] worse
[55:05] it's uh-huh our the Bible says that and
[55:10] the prophet said that
[55:12] the prophet said that the world would go
[55:13] into complete Insanity
[55:15] and the Bible says that the son of man
[55:17] would come back but it's not yet because
[55:19] you've got to hear Room wars and rumors
[55:21] of wars and a great falling away and he
[55:23] mentions all the things that will happen
[55:25] first
[55:27] amen
[55:30] you may
[55:31] lose your value you may lose your money
[55:34] they may change the money they may
[55:37] but none of these things matter
[55:40] God the bottom line is you're going to
[55:42] go in a rapture
[55:44] amen
[55:46] oh Hallelujah hey man let's just go up
[55:49] to verse 30 there Amy in the same
[55:51] chapter
[55:56] so the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet
[55:59] for his God gave him
[56:02] rest
[56:04] around above the battle
[56:07] amen God gives you rest
[56:10] you don't need to do anything for God
[56:13] except love him adore him amen look at
[56:18] like this look at it like this I don't
[56:20] love my wife
[56:22] because she cooks
[56:24] because God made restaurants
[56:28] I don't love my wife
[56:30] because she sews
[56:33] you see to me this compare your like a
[56:36] husband compared to spiritually
[56:38] I don't love my wife because she's
[56:40] beautiful
[56:42] she's all of those things but that's not
[56:44] why I love her
[56:46] now just picture that to God
[56:48] don't love you because you make more
[56:51] money and pay more ties and offers
[56:53] God don't love you because you're
[56:55] dressed nice this morning he does want
[56:57] you modest
[56:59] okay but God don't love you more because
[57:02] you preach you know I I mean sure it
[57:06] says a Elder will get double on her but
[57:09] God don't love you more because you
[57:10] preached 365 days you're a part of the
[57:12] Bride you're part of the Bride
[57:15] in my head
[57:17] let's go get mistaken
[57:24] God's got everything under control
[57:27] and you just need to trust him
[57:29] we just need to trust him be positive
[57:32] and all those all the Bible scriptures
[57:35] are for us
[57:36] amen
[57:38] oh it's beautiful
[57:44] Hallelujah
[57:49] let's look at Romans 8. 28.
[57:55] 28-31
[58:11] and we know that all things work
[58:13] together for good to them that love God
[58:15] to whom he called according to his
[58:17] purpose now I just want you to watch
[58:19] this though who did the work
[58:24] God
[58:25] God it wasn't you the aisle I decided
[58:29] that brother Ben came and he's an
[58:31] awesome Minister brother Ben came and he
[58:33] preached an awesome message and I
[58:35] decided I'm going to love God and I'm
[58:37] going to come up the Altar and give my
[58:38] heart to God
[58:39] no you didn't decide nothing
[58:42] amen
[58:43] God before the foundation of the world
[58:46] God did it according to his purpose for
[58:49] now watch this now this is here God this
[58:51] is here God and how God did the work so
[58:54] yes actually as a Believer you can sit
[58:57] on your hands
[58:59] you don't need to get all excited
[59:01] because the Rapture is going to happen
[59:02] maybe next month or this year or next
[59:06] year or whatever it is I'm not saying
[59:07] winning but I can tell you this is going
[59:09] to happen soon
[59:10] amen
[59:12] for whom he did for no what did you have
[59:15] to do with that
[59:17] nothing
[59:18] he also did predestinated to be
[59:20] conformed to the image of his son what
[59:22] did you have to do with that
[59:24] nothing
[59:26] that he might be the firstborn of many
[59:28] Brethren what did you have to do with
[59:30] that
[59:31] nothing
[59:35] everything had to do with God
[59:37] Jehovah God everything all you have to
[59:40] do is surrender praise and surrender to
[59:43] him believe him love them
[59:45] amen moreover whom he did predestinate
[59:48] who did that God
[59:50] then he also called who you had anything
[59:53] to do with that
[59:54] no no God
[59:56] and them whom he called them he also
[59:58] Justified God again and whom he
[1:00:01] justified he also glorified did you have
[1:00:03] anything to do with that glorify
[1:00:05] now what did the prophet say it's
[1:00:07] completely finished what did we say
[1:00:10] about that quote
[1:00:11] you'll never become a believer
[1:00:14] as long as you're afraid to exercise The
[1:00:16] Authority that has been given to you by
[1:00:19] Jesus Christ
[1:00:21] amen
[1:00:24] he's the mighty conqueror
[1:00:27] you don't in this quote he said you
[1:00:29] don't have to fight for victory you we
[1:00:31] already have them
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:37] in my head you don't need to think amen
[1:00:41] you don't need to think God bless you
[1:00:42] brother fresh you don't need to think
[1:00:43] wow man I must be doing something
[1:00:47] I'm afraid for my children you're not
[1:00:49] supposed to be afraid I'm afraid for
[1:00:51] myself you know you better get praying
[1:00:55] I'm afraid for my bank account well if
[1:00:57] you love the world the things of the
[1:00:58] world the love of God ain't even in you
[1:01:00] so you better pray some more too
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:04] there's no reason to be negative in this
[1:01:07] this is a win-win-win-win-win situation
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:14] what shall we say then to these things
[1:01:18] verse 31.
[1:01:20] if God before us
[1:01:22] then let's be negative
[1:01:27] really
[1:01:28] well that's a different version
[1:01:33] you know the next time a negative word
[1:01:36] comes out of my mouth just
[1:01:38] checked my sister passed
[1:01:40] amen sometimes they do because see you
[1:01:43] know what our Prophet taught us
[1:01:45] this year and you had the same this
[1:01:47] year's because I can see you moving and
[1:01:49] nodding tonight this here is the
[1:01:51] negative
[1:01:52] this ain't you
[1:01:54] this ain't you this is the negative of
[1:01:56] the positive that was your theophany
[1:01:59] your glorified flesh
[1:02:01] amen and so sometimes it's negative does
[1:02:05] negative things but we got to bring it
[1:02:07] in submission
[1:02:08] no
[1:02:10] and the more mature we get in Christ
[1:02:12] and the more we you get mature in the
[1:02:15] word of God and the more we ripen for
[1:02:18] the combine
[1:02:20] you know
[1:02:22] you know I know most you probably know
[1:02:24] this but the combine
[1:02:26] the first thing that hits a combine
[1:02:28] after it's cut off
[1:02:30] is a beaten machine
[1:02:33] they call it what do they call that the
[1:02:34] beater house
[1:02:36] and on my combine I can speak I can make
[1:02:39] the distance of the beater house and
[1:02:40] that beater house is round
[1:02:42] and it has about five bars on it about
[1:02:45] two three inches
[1:02:47] five bars
[1:02:48] it's round and I can speed up the Gap
[1:02:50] that goes underneath the stuff goes
[1:02:52] underneath
[1:02:53] or I can squeeze it if I want to
[1:02:55] pressure it
[1:02:56] and I can speed up my feeder house
[1:02:58] anywhere from 3000 RPMs to about 10 000
[1:03:03] RPMs
[1:03:04] so like believe me you can't see it
[1:03:06] turning
[1:03:08] it's like
[1:03:09] when I shut the combine off and it's
[1:03:12] empty five minutes later it's still
[1:03:14] turning
[1:03:17] and that's the first thing in the
[1:03:19] natural
[1:03:20] that hits you when you get convited
[1:03:22] you think oh bless God I became a
[1:03:24] Christian it's going to be a walk in the
[1:03:25] park oh boys old boys
[1:03:30] you're going to get poverated
[1:03:33] pounded because the prophet said all of
[1:03:35] Satan's guns appointed on the message
[1:03:38] believer
[1:03:39] the bride of Christ
[1:03:40] because you have the revelation of the
[1:03:42] truth
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:45] and anything that's green and wet
[1:03:49] is squashed like mush
[1:03:52] and goes out the back
[1:03:54] and anything that's dry and fluffy
[1:03:58] the fan blows out
[1:04:01] huh
[1:04:03] and so it's either a dust storm behind
[1:04:06] the combine
[1:04:07] and sometimes it's a bit of each this
[1:04:10] year because of the funny year we had
[1:04:12] and the dry season the beans were dry
[1:04:14] but the stocks were green so behind the
[1:04:17] combine it looked like insulates coming
[1:04:18] up which all that means is it was Green
[1:04:21] so there was like Hey coming out of the
[1:04:23] combine
[1:04:24] and yet
[1:04:25] the beans stocked the pots were dry so
[1:04:29] there was also dust coming out
[1:04:32] but the value
[1:04:34] went into the Garners of Egypt
[1:04:38] the value
[1:04:39] all the value
[1:04:40] was that was dry
[1:04:43] it is it had humbled itself in the Sun
[1:04:45] s-o-n
[1:04:46] and it had dried out it had shut up and
[1:04:48] dried out
[1:04:51] what let me you know the prophet always
[1:04:54] take type of typology
[1:04:56] and the natural always takes the
[1:04:58] spiritual
[1:05:01] you know when you're talking about a
[1:05:02] combine in the grain what's the grain
[1:05:04] have to do with getting dry
[1:05:08] nothing
[1:05:11] absolutely nothing
[1:05:15] all that grain does
[1:05:17] let's just stand there
[1:05:20] spiritually
[1:05:22] all you have to do at this age
[1:05:25] when it's going to get worse it's about
[1:05:27] it's going to get worse your job will be
[1:05:29] all messed up and we went through all of
[1:05:31] those type of things with covid and
[1:05:34] but it's it's it's not over
[1:05:37] because we're still here
[1:05:40] they're going to have to imagine
[1:05:41] something I don't know what it'll be
[1:05:47] uh-huh
[1:05:49] changing our money
[1:05:51] making a digital
[1:05:53] there'll be something happening
[1:05:55] that's going to beat up the bride
[1:05:58] but you got to keep your position on
[1:06:02] Shake It Off and step up
[1:06:05] like the Donkey
[1:06:07] you don't have to be buried alive
[1:06:10] you just Shake It Off and step up
[1:06:14] that's what a mature Christian does
[1:06:18] when Satan throws something at him you
[1:06:20] shake it off and you step up on the word
[1:06:22] of God
[1:06:23] when a make believer throw something at
[1:06:25] you you just Shake It Off
[1:06:28] recognize the spirit
[1:06:30] and step up on the word of God
[1:06:32] amen don't try to change them
[1:06:36] it takes God to change people
[1:06:39] if you try to change them you fight the
[1:06:42] prophet talked about if when when
[1:06:44] so-called Believers fight he said the
[1:06:46] devil looks back and and laughs and
[1:06:47] calls you all make Believers because
[1:06:49] Believers don't fight
[1:06:52] man
[1:06:53] positivity in God's word so here here
[1:06:56] we're coming here and I'm going to close
[1:06:59] with this here we're coming with the
[1:07:00] greatest
[1:07:02] expectation for the bride the rapture
[1:07:05] the most magnificent thing in the world
[1:07:08] but in the world and realm that we're
[1:07:10] living in it's going to be them it's
[1:07:12] going to be hell on Earth
[1:07:17] and you have to decide
[1:07:21] if you're going to be able to shake it
[1:07:22] off
[1:07:23] and step up on God's word
[1:07:25] Shake It Off say I'm going in a rapture
[1:07:30] it don't really matter
[1:07:32] what happens in the next 10 years
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:37] it is going to happen
[1:07:39] I know we've heard it our whole life
[1:07:42] you know our Prophet never expected
[1:07:45] to die
[1:07:47] never ever expected that he would die he
[1:07:49] figured the Rapture would take place but
[1:07:51] brother Dale wasn't born yet so it
[1:07:53] couldn't happen
[1:07:56] and many abuse
[1:07:59] okay
[1:08:01] but God's bringing this message
[1:08:03] we're gonna we're gonna go through some
[1:08:05] hard times
[1:08:07] and how are you going to take it
[1:08:09] because all you're taken with you
[1:08:16] your character
[1:08:18] it's how you deal
[1:08:21] bad situation
[1:08:24] how do you deal with a bad situation how
[1:08:25] are you going to deal with it if God
[1:08:27] takes one of our little ones with us how
[1:08:29] are you going to deal with it if God
[1:08:30] takes me
[1:08:31] you're going to deal with it if he takes
[1:08:32] you for your husband
[1:08:35] character
[1:08:37] you know how Satan tempted the prophet
[1:08:39] when God took his first wife
[1:08:42] and he almost
[1:08:44] he got him right up the prophet was just
[1:08:47] right you know he said you know you've
[1:08:48] done all this for God
[1:08:51] and now he's through you and he's going
[1:08:53] to bury you alive
[1:08:55] and he was he said you know I was
[1:08:58] everybody listen to that
[1:09:00] 'd be good he said you know I was just
[1:09:02] and he said I was just ready to think
[1:09:04] well you know
[1:09:05] and it's like oh
[1:09:08] God
[1:09:10] you've done everything
[1:09:13] everything
[1:09:15] wow
[1:09:18] hey man let me just read a couple
[1:09:20] scriptures and quote here
[1:09:24] you know Matthew Matthew and Luke both
[1:09:26] talked about it's not what
[1:09:29] to Follows the man that goes in his
[1:09:31] mouth but what's the fastest man it's
[1:09:33] what comes out of this mouth
[1:09:35] negativity
[1:09:37] see a Believer if you're negative
[1:09:41] let me break this down and I'm going to
[1:09:43] recall we are going to clip
[1:09:45] if you're negative
[1:09:48] you're not negative to your situation
[1:09:51] you're complaining to God
[1:09:55] that's what it is
[1:09:59] because God is his word
[1:10:01] and he said that it's all for your good
[1:10:04] so when you don't like what he did you
[1:10:05] say God
[1:10:06] you're
[1:10:09] you made a mistake God but what do you
[1:10:11] want you're saying of course he didn't
[1:10:14] but that's how God perceives your
[1:10:16] complaining
[1:10:17] I'm not happy with you God
[1:10:19] you took something from
[1:10:23] what God Said in his word it was for
[1:10:25] your good
[1:10:30] huh
[1:10:32] what's this quote here here's a positive
[1:10:35] believer in Christ
[1:10:40] he said
[1:10:41] he was talking about
[1:10:43] people and I I've preached on this
[1:10:45] people believe in they had faith when
[1:10:46] they only had hope man there's a huge
[1:10:48] difference in Hope and Faith Faith has a
[1:10:50] substance to us everybody has hope
[1:10:52] everybody hopes to get to heaven but
[1:10:54] they don't have faith they're getting
[1:10:55] there amen faith is you can know
[1:10:59] it's a substance
[1:11:01] he said Faith does the job right now
[1:11:05] hope
[1:11:06] just hopes for it but faith is a product
[1:11:10] Faith really does it see we have lots of
[1:11:13] Hope but not much faith
[1:11:16] watches so we want to change from hope
[1:11:19] today
[1:11:20] to watch to
[1:11:23] positive
[1:11:25] faith
[1:11:27] why did the prophet say positive
[1:11:30] you know he said positive
[1:11:32] about 25 times
[1:11:34] 25 different messages
[1:11:37] he said there's only one way
[1:11:40] that you can get positive faith
[1:11:43] positive faith
[1:11:46] and that's by positive thinking
[1:11:49] on positive things
[1:11:55] that's a position of a believer
[1:11:58] in Christ
[1:12:00] there's only one way you can get
[1:12:03] positive faith and that's by
[1:12:06] positive thinking
[1:12:09] on positive things
[1:12:12] that definitely won't be politics
[1:12:16] it'll be the rapture that's the only
[1:12:19] positive thing there is
[1:12:22] The only positive thing there is is
[1:12:24] salvation and a Rapture to get out of
[1:12:26] this past house
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:30] if your body ain't started to Creak yet
[1:12:32] just wait a few years
[1:12:34] you won't be so in love with your body
[1:12:37] I was rubbing my elbow last week and I
[1:12:40] was like oh
[1:12:43] those are because I'm there you go
[1:12:46] positive
[1:12:47] positive part is I'm going to get out of
[1:12:50] this body
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:54] here's another quote using God's using
[1:12:57] his gifts he said don't think the kind
[1:13:00] of negative thought don't let that go
[1:13:02] through your mind every word positive
[1:13:06] every thought positive
[1:13:10] and where's the positivity today
[1:13:13] God's word and his promises
[1:13:16] amen he's going to take care of you
[1:13:18] amen it's not in this world it's
[1:13:21] positive inflation's up and the taxes
[1:13:23] are going up
[1:13:24] and you're going to make less money no
[1:13:26] it's in God's word forget about this
[1:13:29] world we're going to leave it behind
[1:13:30] we've got to remember we're on a holiday
[1:13:36] sometimes it rains on your holiday that
[1:13:38] might be what it's due in the last part
[1:13:40] of our life
[1:13:42] but I'm looking about I'm going back
[1:13:44] home
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:47] Hallelujah
[1:13:50] the eagle stare at her nest by faith
[1:13:53] Look Away Yonder do and see the the
[1:13:58] what God's done for you and every word
[1:14:01] will be a positive Act
[1:14:04] everywhere
[1:14:06] it'll be a positive Act
[1:14:09] Hallelujah
[1:14:11] to be to be negative
[1:14:15] to be negative and to be a believer
[1:14:17] is to say God
[1:14:20] I think you're making a mistake
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:27] God didn't make no mistakes
[1:14:29] he didn't make any and he ain't making
[1:14:31] any and he won't make it
[1:14:33] man God's concerned about your Eternal
[1:14:35] destination
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:39] that's his main concern
[1:14:42] amen I I just love that about
[1:14:44] Jehoshaphat I'm glad that God don't love
[1:14:47] me because I work hard for him
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:56] if you loved your wife like that I I
[1:14:59] think that would be close to slavery
[1:15:02] you know
[1:15:06] wow you just thank God see God loved us
[1:15:08] when we were unlovable
[1:15:12] man he loved us when we didn't recognize
[1:15:14] our love for him yet
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:18] positivity amen
[1:15:20] God's got everything under control
[1:15:24] but that don't mean that this world
[1:15:26] ain't falling apart
[1:15:28] God promised that it would
[1:15:31] he promised that it would so God you
[1:15:34] pray for me
[1:15:36] because I'm in this exact same bottle I
[1:15:38] I don't like it
[1:15:40] I don't like it that I'm paying 230
[1:15:42] something a liter for diesel in my
[1:15:44] pickup I don't like that at all it's
[1:15:46] ridiculous
[1:15:47] 50 cents more in gas and it's easier to
[1:15:49] make
[1:15:51] but you should just buy and say oh
[1:15:52] praise God I'm going home soon I won't
[1:15:55] need diesel on those streets of gold
[1:15:57] I'll just have a thought and I'll be
[1:15:58] with you brother Fred
[1:16:00] man
[1:16:02] see it's all in how you look at it all
[1:16:06] in how you look at there were so many
[1:16:07] different stories you know
[1:16:09] let me just uh
[1:16:11] look in my
[1:16:17] oh they're actually I'll close with this
[1:16:19] last story that just came to I knew I
[1:16:21] hit my iPad there was a shoe company
[1:16:25] true story
[1:16:27] as far as I know true story as far as I
[1:16:30] know
[1:16:30] true company that had been in business
[1:16:33] in America
[1:16:34] and they were doing very well
[1:16:37] and they wanted to expand and you know
[1:16:39] increase their business and
[1:16:41] and do all these things so they sent two
[1:16:44] shoe salespents
[1:16:46] to another country they sent one to the
[1:16:48] north one to the South
[1:16:50] you just picture this spiritually
[1:16:53] spiritually and your perception of where
[1:16:56] God's placed you in Wyoming or this area
[1:16:59] you're worshiping in Wyoming and the
[1:17:03] pressures of the flesh the world this is
[1:17:05] the negative this ain't really this will
[1:17:08] make mistakes if you look at this you're
[1:17:09] going to see lots of mistakes in brother
[1:17:10] Dale
[1:17:12] but brother Dale's got a predestinated
[1:17:13] seed that don't make no mistakes hasn't
[1:17:15] made any yet
[1:17:18] and both salesmen went to the thing and
[1:17:20] the one salesman went and he sent back a
[1:17:23] telegram immediately to the bot
[1:17:26] and he said boss he said cancel all the
[1:17:28] orders for shoes
[1:17:31] he said
[1:17:32] nobody here wears shoes
[1:17:37] and the other salesman had no idea what
[1:17:39] the other salesman had done because they
[1:17:41] were on the opposite side of the country
[1:17:43] and about a couple hours later the
[1:17:45] opposite yellow salesman went in to send
[1:17:48] back his telegram that must have been
[1:17:49] before Wi-Fi and all these wonderful
[1:17:51] gadgets that we have
[1:17:53] and he said boss increase the production
[1:17:56] like crazy he said nobody here has shoes
[1:17:59] on and he said the sales and Expedition
[1:18:02] and possibilities
[1:18:04] are Unlimited
[1:18:10] Unlimited
[1:18:13] one was close the factory
[1:18:16] and one was Unlimited
[1:18:21] that's the same decision you have to
[1:18:22] make
[1:18:23] this morning
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:27] with Christ
[1:18:29] and the Rapture at hand
[1:18:31] the possibilities are unlimited let's
[1:18:35] stand let's stand
[1:18:37] amen hallelujah
[1:18:40] Hallelujah God help me wow
[1:18:45] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:18:48] you know God didn't save anybody to lose
[1:18:51] anybody
[1:18:53] he glorified you you're in God's eyes
[1:18:55] you are already a glorified being here
[1:18:58] in Romans 8.
[1:19:01] that's beautiful
[1:19:02] and he didn't have me labor to get there
[1:19:07] that's beautiful
[1:19:09] amen you don't you don't think you're uh
[1:19:12] you're not dressed Holiness because you
[1:19:14] labored hard to get it God give you that
[1:19:16] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:19] God give it that now of course we raise
[1:19:21] up our children that way
[1:19:23] so they won't depart from it but that's
[1:19:25] that's the token that's Christ
[1:19:27] everything is Christ
[1:19:30] and all we got to do the only thing you
[1:19:32] got to labor to is to say yes I'll take
[1:19:34] it I'll take it I'll take I'll take some
[1:19:37] more of that I'll take the snake at the
[1:19:39] other end of the table I'll take my
[1:19:41] potatoes I want some mashed potatoes too
[1:19:43] because I I need some healing and
[1:19:45] salvation
[1:19:49] he said if you're questioning God
[1:19:53] you're not even a believer yet
[1:19:55] in the quote we read
[1:19:58] he said you got to start and it's not
[1:20:00] that God might do it or could do it
[1:20:03] you know I read a quote just you know
[1:20:05] just in studying they read hundreds of
[1:20:06] quotes he said the greatest problem in
[1:20:09] the church the prophet said was fear
[1:20:11] people don't believe God
[1:20:14] he really won't it's not that he won't
[1:20:16] he already did
[1:20:18] God can't take it back
[1:20:21] he already did it's not like he won't
[1:20:24] he already did and if you don't get it
[1:20:26] it's because you don't believe he did it
[1:20:29] that's amazing
[1:20:31] oh it's beautiful
[1:20:33] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus let's
[1:20:35] sing that song oh come let us adore him
[1:20:39] oh come let us cry
