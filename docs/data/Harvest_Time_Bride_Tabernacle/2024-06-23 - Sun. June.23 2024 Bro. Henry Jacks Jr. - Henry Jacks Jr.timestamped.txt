[50:50] full of too much of
[50:53] you Hallelujah I got to take out that
[50:56] thought of you Hallelujah that's why
[50:59] brother Paul was saying to them he said
[51:02] let this mind be in you which was also
[51:05] in Christ
[51:06] Jesus Hallelujah you know that the
[51:09] Philippians Church brother Paul had a
[51:13] close relationship with them Hallelujah

[56:07] to bring them in the unity of the faith
[56:11] and Jude one is a content for the faith
[56:15] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[56:18] and that faith is the Faith of

[56:22] Hallelujah he's the Faith of Christ so
[56:26] here we are as we mentioned there's two
[56:29] season Hallelujah the season of
[56:32] restoration and the season of bearing
[56:35] forth
[56:36] fruit Hallelujah and we're living the
[56:38] season whereby it is manifesting time
[56:43] and we are to manifest
[56:46] Christ how do you manifest Christ
[56:49] Hallelujah when you bear forth fruit
[56:52] that's when you're manifesting Christ
[56:55] Hallelujah and the fruits Hallelujah
[56:57] that I'm talking about I'm talking about
[57:01] faith Temperance patience brotherly God
[57:04] brotherly kindness
[57:06] godliness Hallelujah these are the
[57:09] fruits of the spirit Hallelujah these
[57:13] are the fruit The Joy the patience we
[57:17] must manifest these things because these
[57:19] are the attribute of Jesus Christ
[57:23] sometimes people need some longsuffering
[57:27] hallelu you got to Long suffer with some
[57:30] members you got to Long suffer with your
[57:33] children Hallelujah you got to Long
[57:35] suffer with your
[57:37] relatives Hallelujah Jesus had to Long
[57:40] suffer with his with his
[57:43] relative the Bible said he has four
[57:45] brothers but they did not believe in
[57:50] him Hallelujah they did not believe in
[57:53] him but he long suffer with them God
[57:55] long with Israel for 40 years he said
[57:59] for 40 years long I've been long suffer
[58:02] with this
[58:03] generation Hallelujah so we have to we
[58:06] have to portray the same attribute that
[58:10] Jesus
[58:11] portrayed Hallelujah you're got to
[58:14] express some
[58:16] mercy oh God am I talking to some
[58:20] Abraham children Hallelujah give the
[58:23] Seed of Abraham say heyen
[58:26] Oh Glory to God hallelujah I tell you
[58:30] saints of God sometimes there people
[58:34] they will test your
[58:35] faith Hallelujah and if you're not
[58:38] careful you will be like Elisha when
[58:42] Elisha when those 42 children Hallelujah
[58:46] were mocking Elisha and the Bible said
[58:49] Elisha called to she bear Hallelujah to
[58:52] devour those 42 children you know what
[58:55] the Prophet
[58:57] said he said that wasn't
[59:02] God hallelujah he said that wasn't God
[59:07] hallelujah I tell you Saints sometimes
[59:11] Hallelujah you know when you have the
[59:13] mind of Christ you got to it will make
[59:17] you understand that the devil is
[59:19] strength the devil Hallelujah is
[59:21] pressing your button yes sir Hallelujah
[59:25] because you're still in this
[59:27] flesh Hallelujah and once you're still
[59:30] in this
[59:31] flesh you're going to react according to
[59:33] your
[59:34] emotions Hallelujah GL I've been there
[59:39] I've been there I'm being honest I tell
[59:42] you
[59:43] Sint sometimes I tell you some person
[59:45] press me H the the last thing left for
[59:49] me to do was call on
[59:52] fire I'm telling you the truth
[59:55] hallelujah the last thing left for me is
[59:57] to call down
[59:58] fire you know what the disciples said to
[1:00:01] Jesus every time you go through Samaria
[1:00:04] they're rejecting you why you don't call
[1:00:06] on fire like Elijah
[1:00:10] did Jesus said
[1:00:13] no Hallelujah he said no that's not the
[1:00:16] will of God hallelujah it's not the will
[1:00:19] of God thank God we cannot make it
[1:00:23] without his holy spirit
[1:00:26] the mind of Christ is the spirit of
[1:00:30] God hallelujah and it takes the spirit
[1:00:33] of God to lead you into his
[1:00:35] will and not the will of the
[1:00:38] flesh because you have the will of God
[1:00:42] and you have the will of the
[1:00:43] flesh Hallelujah and the mind of Christ
[1:00:46] lead you into the will of God and not of
[1:00:49] the
[1:00:50] flesh so when sometimes you start to be
[1:00:54] a certain way when you look at it you're
[1:00:57] not going into the will of God it is in
[1:01:00] the will of
[1:01:03] Flesh Hallelujah so God has to keep us
[1:01:07] God has to keep us even from our own
[1:01:10] self because our own self Hallelujah is
[1:01:14] an
[1:01:15] unbeliever oh praise God brother Paul
[1:01:19] said every time I want to do good Heil
[1:01:22] present itself Hallelujah so the battle
[1:01:25] sometimes even your own self you have to
[1:01:28] go up against your own self but it takes
[1:01:32] the spirit of God hallelujah to put your
[1:01:35] own self under
[1:01:37] subjection hallelujah oh praise God
[1:01:41] thank you very much my sister
[1:01:44] amen praise the Lord my God so
[1:01:50] here brother Paul Hallelujah the word
[1:01:56] let when he use the word let this mind
[1:01:59] the word let means not
[1:02:02] prevent Hallelujah allow forbid do not
[1:02:07] forbid the mind of Christ it is
[1:02:10] important Hallelujah do not forbid it
[1:02:14] Hallelujah because the mind of Christ
[1:02:17] will lead you into the perfect
[1:02:20] path glory to
[1:02:22] God and many times people
[1:02:27] sometimes they think that they're going
[1:02:30] by
[1:02:31] faith but the prophet said imagination
[1:02:34] and faith is very
[1:02:39] close he said it is very close sometime
[1:02:43] they think that is Faith but he said
[1:02:46] it's not their faith it's their
[1:02:49] imagination oh my God
[1:02:52] hallelujah th this is the flesh
[1:02:56] hallelujah we're up against glory to
[1:03:00] God that's why Jesus had to came so that
[1:03:05] he could send back the Holy Spirit glory
[1:03:09] to God send back the mind of the father
[1:03:14] so that the mind of the father once he
[1:03:17] comes inside of us it brings us to The
[1:03:20] Obedience of the father's will
[1:03:23] Hallelujah
[1:03:25] and once you bring us to the father's
[1:03:28] will you're going to manifest the will
[1:03:30] of the father Hallelujah you're going to
[1:03:33] manifest his
[1:03:36] character when brother Paul here H when
[1:03:40] he was in prison he heard what was
[1:03:43] happening hallelujah what was happening
[1:03:46] in the Church of
[1:03:48] Philippi they loved him the Philippi

[1:04:55] saying that do not heal to your own
[1:04:58] mind Hallelujah he knew that mercies was
[1:05:02] there but do not heal to your own
[1:05:06] mind Hallelujah but let this mind that

[1:07:19] natur the F the natural one that pumps
[1:07:23] that pumps the blood Hallelujah to the
[1:07:26] body but you have the natural one and
[1:07:29] you have the spiritual one Hall the
[1:07:32] spiritual heart is where the Inner Man
[1:07:35] dwells this is where you have two seed
[1:07:38] in it and the one that you feed the most
[1:07:42] will become
[1:07:44] greater you have the seed of doubt in it
[1:07:47] and you have the seed of Fai in it
[1:07:50] Hallelujah that's why the Bible said
[1:07:53] guard the issues guard your heart
[1:07:56] because out of it come the issues of
[1:07:59] Life hallelujah it's what you feed you
[1:08:04] become

[1:08:16] the spiritual
[1:08:18] man Hallelujah glory to God you
[1:08:23] know sometimes
[1:08:26] it grieved my
[1:08:27] heart you know because sometimes you're
[1:08:30] talking to some people and it's like
[1:08:33] you're not going
[1:08:34] anywhere all is just licking is w w he
[1:08:38] just keep bouncing back off but you know
[1:08:42] what you got to keep
[1:08:43] going nowah nowah had to preach for 120
[1:08:49] years Jesus hallelujah oh nowah and the
[1:08:55] prophecy was preaching the same
[1:08:59] message it is hard but you got to keep
[1:09:02] going Hallelujah 120 years the same
[1:09:08] message over and over and over for 120
[1:09:12] years but you know what it was
[1:09:16] true that's the important thing it is
[1:09:19] true Hallelujah so sometimes though

[1:09:27] like not going nowhere but keep
[1:09:29] going Hall keep
[1:09:32] preaching keep

[1:10:33] hallelujah let me say this we all
[1:10:36] believe in the Rapture Hallelujah the
[1:10:40] Rapture is an attribute of the

[1:10:54] yes sir all the was in God he pour into
[1:10:57] Christ and all that was into Christ he
[1:11:00] pour into the

[1:11:07] matter what it comes with you have to
[1:11:10] manifest every attribute of the father

[1:15:17] walked directly straight up to Mary and

[1:25:19] Hallelujah God has given us peace if he
[1:25:23] has given us peace why are we we fussing
[1:25:25] why are we Haring we must live good
[1:25:29] together when brother Paul said we must
[1:25:31] be of the same mind the same mind in
[1:25:37] unity in unity can I say this in the
[1:25:41] book of St John 6 from verse 53 to 55
[1:25:46] when Jesus said except you take of the
[1:25:48] Flesh of the son of man and drink of his
[1:25:52] blood you have no life in you
[1:25:54] did you know that there's three
[1:25:56] benefits one is eternal life and you are
[1:26:00] in unity with
[1:26:04] Christ
[1:26:06] Hallelujah so you know what that tells
[1:26:08] me some persons that are not in unity it
[1:26:12] means they not eating the the son of man
[1:26:15] body and drinking of his
[1:26:18] blood you know what the Bible said he
[1:26:21] that drink of his e that drink of his
[1:26:24] blood than it I will dwell in
[1:26:29] him Jesus said he said I will dwell in
[1:26:32] him and he in
[1:26:34] me isn't that the
[1:26:37] word oh praise God we're talking about a
[1:26:41] h that we're living in hallelujah
[1:26:47] hallelujah come back Hallelujah the
[1:26:52] faith that faith now Hallelujah he
[1:26:56] talking about the attribute of Christ
[1:26:59] come back to the
[1:27:01] Unity come back to the gospel come back
[1:27:05] to
[1:27:06] peace come back to the attribute of the
[1:27:09] father glory to God John saw John said
[1:27:13] all that was in him he was full of
[1:27:17] grace he was full of
[1:27:22] grace verse
[1:27:24] 13 Rich things also we speak not in The
[1:27:30] Words which man wisdom teach it but
[1:27:33] which the Holy Ghost teach it comparing
[1:27:36] spiritual things with spiritual it takes
[1:27:39] the mind of Christ Hallelujah to compare
[1:27:42] spiritual things with
[1:27:44] spiritual without the mind of Christ you
[1:27:47] cannot understand the spiritual things
[1:27:50] because it is foolishness unto the
[1:27:52] natural
[1:27:54] oh
[1:27:56] God that was what happened in St John 6
