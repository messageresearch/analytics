[24:36] hey man if you got your Bible and like
[24:38] to turn with me to the Book of Matthew
[24:40] we're going to turn to Matthew 16. we're
[24:42] just going to take a short text this
[24:44] morning
[24:49] and just say Amen when you've got it and
[24:52] I'll know we can
[24:53] continue on
[24:55] very familiar scripture for all of us
[25:01] foreign
[25:04] Matthew in chapter 16 and we'll start at
[25:07] verse 13.
[25:09] when Jesus came into the coast of
[25:11] caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[25:13] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[25:17] man am
[25:18] and they said some say that thou art
[25:20] John the Baptist and some say Elias and
[25:23] others Jeremiahs are one of the prophets
[25:25] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[25:28] that I am
[25:30] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[25:32] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[25:35] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[25:37] blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh
[25:39] and Blood hath not revealed this to you
[25:41] but my Father which is in heaven amen
[25:44] let's just bow our heads one more time
[25:46] this morning Father God we humbly
[25:48] approach your throne once again this
[25:50] morning Lord knowing that you've already
[25:52] fulfilled your promise you said where
[25:54] two or three are gathered in your name
[25:56] that you would be in the midst thereof
[25:57] and Lord we know that you're here just
[26:00] simply by Your Word Lord we believe you
[26:02] and we take you at your word and we just
[26:04] pray that your spirit would have the
[26:05] freedom to walk up and down the aisles
[26:07] Lord that you would Minister to each
[26:09] Heart Lord that we would be able to uh
[26:12] hear and receive from you may you speak
[26:15] to our Our Lives Lord speak to our souls
[26:18] and may your word change as we pray from
[26:20] the pulpit to the very back the youngest
[26:22] to the oldest to whoever whoever this
[26:25] sermon might reach and go forth Lord may
[26:27] may it be a witness for you we pray
[26:30] and we ask these things in the name of
[26:32] our our lovely Lord Jesus Christ amen
[26:35] amen you can be seated this morning I
[26:37] just want to once again greet you and
[26:39] and and say thank you for the
[26:42] opportunity to be with you it's been
[26:44] it's been it's been too long it's been
[26:48] too long
[26:49] and um
[26:51] I I'm just I'm just happy and just
[26:53] thrilled to see you all still
[26:54] persevering and uh you know things
[26:58] change sometimes you know you get new
[27:00] faces you lose old faces and and uh but
[27:04] one thing's One Thing Remains and that's
[27:06] the word of God and our fellowship
[27:08] around the world and that it just won't
[27:10] ever change and so
[27:12] um I was so grateful to be able to to go
[27:14] and see brother Jim and sister Linda
[27:16] yesterday and and uh just say a little
[27:19] prayer for him and and uh you know I
[27:22] just believe that God God Is A Healer
[27:24] and um it's not just a a past a past
[27:28] thing that happens sometime long ago
[27:30] it's not just something that uh you know
[27:33] we just say well God is the god that
[27:34] he'll he is our healer and I believe
[27:38] that I believe uh that as long as uh you
[27:42] know as long as there is a sick person
[27:43] that God Is A Healer
[27:45] and I'll always pray for a healing I'll
[27:47] always pray for a miracle it doesn't
[27:48] matter if you pray for someone they pass
[27:52] away the very next day it doesn't matter
[27:53] one bit God steal a Healer and until
[27:55] that as long as that sister or loved one
[27:59] has life in their their body will pray
[28:01] for a miracle and pray for healing amen
[28:03] I I believe that I've seen it too many
[28:06] times in my life
[28:07] that God is healed I'd like to maybe
[28:10] just share a testimony with you before
[28:11] we get started
[28:13] um
[28:13] uh all my life I've had problems with my
[28:16] my hearing my ears and had multiple
[28:19] surgeries to try to fix things to make
[28:22] things better I'm actually quite deaf
[28:25] and I recently here a couple years ago
[28:29] one of my ears started started bleeding
[28:31] and it would it would drain in a it was
[28:34] just it was a horrible condition it
[28:36] smelled terrible it was just unsightly
[28:38] and
[28:40] um I went to the doctor to a specialist
[28:42] and they said well you've got a tumor
[28:44] and I went to another doctor and and
[28:46] they said well no it's it's it's this
[28:48] but uh it needs to come out but the
[28:51] problem is if we take it out uh it's
[28:54] attached to a nerve in in that we run a
[28:57] very high risk of paralyzing your face
[28:59] if we do this and the doctor just
[29:01] wouldn't do it I I kept asking and went
[29:04] on for for over a year that I asked to
[29:07] to have this surgery and they they just
[29:10] was it was just too risky
[29:12] well finally I I had gone to the gone
[29:15] back to the doctor for another checkup
[29:17] and and his uh assistant was in there
[29:20] and she was a little bit more easily
[29:23] convinced that maybe she was just
[29:25] younger or whatever but she said well
[29:26] okay yeah we'll go ahead and schedule
[29:27] this and um and so the next thing you
[29:30] know I'm I'm uh in the in the uh prep
[29:34] room there at the surgery place to have
[29:37] surgery and I've you know they've got me
[29:39] ready they've got the IV in I'm in a
[29:41] gown and everything and the doctor comes
[29:43] in you know if they do to do their their
[29:45] pre-checks to make sure you know we we
[29:48] all know what we're here for and so he's
[29:50] asking me the questions is you know
[29:52] what's what's your name what's your date
[29:53] of birth and why are we here I said well
[29:56] I'm here to have surgery on my ears okay
[29:58] great and he's like all right let's take
[30:00] a look in in your ear and he gets out
[30:02] his my wife wife was there with me
[30:05] and uh so he gets out his his little
[30:08] scope and he he looks at my ears yep and
[30:11] he looks in the other ear yep he's like
[30:13] all right so tell me again why we're
[30:14] here I said well
[30:17] I've got a I've got the Paul up in my
[30:20] ear that's bleeding we're going to take
[30:22] that out today you see I just thought he
[30:23] was just you know this is just part of
[30:25] the checks
[30:28] he says there's nothing there
[30:31] there's nothing there
[30:37] you see
[30:38] God's A Healer
[30:40] you can't convince me otherwise
[30:43] I thought I fought for over a year to
[30:45] have that surgery and and nervous as I
[30:48] was about it you know I believe okay you
[30:50] know God had God can heal through
[30:52] medicine
[30:53] God doesn't need doctors
[30:55] amen I'm not against him not one bit but
[30:59] God's A Healer you can't tell me God
[31:01] doesn't heal my wife matter of fact
[31:04] she had um for years she had a thing on
[31:08] her thyroid lumps and um so bad that you
[31:12] could actually begin to see the the
[31:14] lumps pressing out on her neck it was
[31:16] making her neck bulge we you know had
[31:19] gone to the doctor and they want to you
[31:21] know biopsy it remove it just totally
[31:23] take out the entire thing
[31:25] it was so bad that she couldn't hardly
[31:27] sing she'd always always be clearing her
[31:29] throat and
[31:31] difficulty swallowing and and in one
[31:35] service just you know after service
[31:37] worshiping the Lord and
[31:39] and it was healed just like that she she
[31:42] was she was she was praying for and she
[31:44] was praying for a mental Deliverance
[31:46] with which God gave her
[31:49] she went she she prayed she was thinking
[31:51] God she was delivered from the from the
[31:53] mental thing that she was fighting she
[31:55] goes to the to the bathroom afterwards
[31:57] and she comes out and she fills her neck
[31:59] she's like wait a minute
[32:01] and it was gone
[32:03] like that I couldn't see it it's not
[32:06] there anymore
[32:07] Our God Is A Healer and he goes above
[32:10] and beyond anything that we ask for
[32:12] anything that we could possibly want he
[32:15] wants to give us good things
[32:17] and to me I this is you know these are
[32:20] not just random things they're not just
[32:22] one-off events it's not just some you
[32:24] know this is our life
[32:27] God is God has given us the bread of
[32:30] healing God loves and cares for you for
[32:33] everything in your life he cares for you
[32:35] amen so I you know it to me it's just uh
[32:38] we're living in the in the end times and
[32:41] healing is the children's bread we're
[32:44] just so close now you know we we look
[32:46] back in our in so many times we want to
[32:48] place things in the past and say well
[32:49] that was then you know we and we become
[32:52] guilty of saying well that was in that
[32:53] was under that Ministry that was under
[32:55] that type of a Ministry but it's here
[32:57] today for you for us amen and I believe
[33:01] that I believe we're living in the last
[33:02] days I don't know if you keep up with
[33:05] the
[33:05] with the current events and things like
[33:07] that but you know I I think it's uh I
[33:10] don't I don't like reading the news I
[33:11] avoid it really but there are certain
[33:13] things that I keep my eyes out you know
[33:14] the the prophet told us you know watch
[33:16] Russia King of the North he told us that
[33:19] Israel is our timepiece and so there's
[33:21] certain things that I look for and and
[33:23] here recently just one of the things I I
[33:25] saw that's so interesting the red
[33:28] heifers I don't know if you've ever
[33:29] heard about this I'm sure you have but
[33:31] let me just uh encourage you and build
[33:33] your faith where we are in today and
[33:36] we're so close my friends to the Rapture
[33:39] the red heifers now the red heifers are
[33:42] are an integral part of reestablishing
[33:45] Jewish Worship in a Temple and so for
[33:48] for the Jews to come onto the temple and
[33:50] to build Even build the temple they have
[33:53] to be dedicated and Sanctified in a
[33:55] certain way and that way is is they have
[33:58] to take and they have to slaughter a red
[34:00] heifer burn the ashes and those ashes
[34:03] then mixed with water are then used to
[34:04] sanctify the the tools the implements
[34:08] all the things they've built the the
[34:10] candlesticks they've built the
[34:12] breastplate they've built all the stuff
[34:14] they've made all the clothes they're
[34:16] prepared to to begin worshiping but they
[34:19] could not begin until they had a red
[34:21] heifer now they now they have five red
[34:26] heifers five and these red heifers
[34:28] they've been looking for them for years
[34:29] because they can't be without they can't
[34:31] have a blemish they can't have a single
[34:33] white hair nothing can be wrong with
[34:35] them now they have five which is Grace
[34:38] not only that they they they finally
[34:41] have them in Israel they found these in
[34:43] in the United States and they're now
[34:45] they're there we're so close so close
[34:48] and then here recently something that's
[34:49] been uh and coming out into the news is
[34:52] the drying up of the river Euphrates
[34:55] wow my friends that I mean that's
[34:57] straight out of the out of Revelations
[34:59] the angel poured forth is vile and the
[35:03] Euphrates dries up to make way for the
[35:05] kings of the East to come in you know
[35:07] for the battle of Armageddon now I'm not
[35:10] saying the battle armageddon's tomorrow
[35:11] or something like that but we're slowly
[35:14] moving closer and closer to that end
[35:16] time and so as Christians as Believers I
[35:19] believe that it's important that we we
[35:21] focus our minds and we focus our eyes on
[35:23] the things of God and we don't let this
[35:26] outside world influence us and you know
[35:29] if we walk amongst the world we rub
[35:31] shoulders with the world but we are not
[35:33] of this world our home is a Heavenly
[35:35] Home amen and so we we just we need to
[35:40] focus on the things of of God and and be
[35:43] aware right be aware of what's going on
[35:45] around us and then and that's not to
[35:47] cause us fear or or to uh to put us in a
[35:50] position of anxiety but what it should
[35:52] do is is give us peace and a confidence
[35:54] that God's word is true you amen you
[35:56] know generation upon generation of
[35:58] people have looked at this word at this
[36:00] Bible and thought that it applied to
[36:03] them and it did in a way but this is the
[36:05] generation that will not pass away this
[36:08] is a generation that saw Israel putting
[36:11] forth this leaves the Fig Tree as it
[36:13] were that the prophecy this generation
[36:15] will not pass away now that was 1948 and
[36:18] you say well brother John we're we're so
[36:20] far along the way after that he said
[36:22] well what's the generation you know and
[36:24] if you go by by Sunday so eugenesis is
[36:27] 120 if you go by this date and the Bible
[36:29] it's 90 it's not it's 80. it doesn't
[36:31] matter because no man knows today or the
[36:32] hour and I'm not here to preach numbers
[36:34] to you but what I am here to say is that
[36:36] generation will not pass away we are
[36:40] going to see the rev the coming of the
[36:42] Lord Jesus Christ in our day Jesus is
[36:45] coming now his presence is already here
[36:47] but we are looking for a rapture uh all
[36:50] my friends I believe it's time that we
[36:51] we focus on the things that really
[36:53] matter the things that are really
[36:54] important and it's not it's not work and
[36:57] it's not society and it's not culture
[36:59] it's a mess and we're not part of it
[37:01] anyway
[37:02] amen it doesn't matter to us what uh
[37:04] what you know you just kind of shake
[37:06] your head at things that that happen and
[37:08] you and you say Lord help them and you
[37:10] you know uh the way that our countries
[37:12] and our culture is going is just tea
[37:14] totally insane just like brother Branham
[37:16] said it would be and we see that uh it's
[37:19] it's just incredible in the last 20
[37:21] years what we've seen happen is is it uh
[37:25] it any any real child of God you just
[37:28] shake your head and it makes you sick to
[37:30] your stomach so much of it
[37:33] amen well that's all free let me get
[37:35] back to my notes
[37:39] amen so they said they said to him who
[37:41] Jesus asked him who do men say that I
[37:43] the son of man am and he's and he's and
[37:45] they said some are say that you're
[37:47] you're John the Baptist some Elias and
[37:49] others Jeremiahs are one of the prophets
[37:51] and he said who do you say that I am he
[37:54] asks the question you know what he
[37:55] brought it to them and said what do you
[37:58] say that I am what am I to you because
[38:01] it doesn't matter what the other people
[38:03] say what matters is what you believe and
[38:06] what you see amen and so I guess if you
[38:09] could title this this morning I I would
[38:10] I would title it what seeth thou what do
[38:13] you see what are you looking at what's
[38:15] your what is your focus this morning
[38:17] because you can people can look at
[38:19] things and they can see something
[38:21] totally different
[38:22] it's all it's a it's it's amazing to me
[38:25] how people can can uh look at two two uh
[38:29] an event and have totally opposing
[38:31] diametrically opposed views of what is
[38:34] good and what is right and you know and
[38:36] that's just exactly what the scripture
[38:38] said it would be the men calling uh evil
[38:41] good and good evil you know that is the
[38:43] dichotomy that we have in our in our
[38:45] society and in our culture uh so it's
[38:48] not surprising but but for a bride of
[38:50] Jesus Christ for a Christian we should
[38:53] be able to look at things things going
[38:54] on in the world and be able to see it
[38:56] with the right mind I believe amen and
[38:58] so it's important to see you know
[39:01] people who would look at Jesus's
[39:02] Ministry and some of them would would
[39:04] say you know he the Jesus would perform
[39:07] a miracle and one person right here
[39:09] would look at it and say you're you're
[39:11] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[39:13] the person standing over here would say
[39:15] cast out Devils by the prince of devils
[39:17] they seen the same exact Miracle but the
[39:20] way that they looked at it was
[39:22] completely different and their reality
[39:24] was completely different one person can
[39:26] look at something and say that is an act
[39:28] of God a miracle praise the Lord bless
[39:31] God and another person can look at it
[39:33] and say well that's psychology that's
[39:35] mental telepathy that's anything but but
[39:38] the working of God
[39:40] and so it's different we perceive things
[39:42] differently
[39:44] um yeah let me let me relate a story to
[39:46] you there was a uh
[39:49] there was a football game in 1950 this
[39:53] is very interesting uh and by all
[39:56] accounts it was a really a really bad
[39:58] game The Players had broken noses broken
[40:01] legs and it was just it was just a real
[40:04] battle
[40:04] and um
[40:06] those fans were were fighting and they
[40:09] got into this great big Rumble in this
[40:13] uh all kinds of fisticuffs and and bad
[40:16] things and after after the event
[40:18] after the event these two uh men one
[40:21] from each school they were scientists
[40:23] and they met together and they they said
[40:25] why was this so bad why was it so bad
[40:28] why did people have you know this side
[40:30] blamed them this other side blames the
[40:33] other side why was it so bad and so they
[40:35] began to study it and one of the things
[40:37] they did was they they sat down and they
[40:39] had a video of the game and they showed
[40:42] the video of the game to uh students
[40:45] from each school and they just set them
[40:47] in a room one student they watched the
[40:49] game and they said we want you just to
[40:50] be a to pretend you're a referee as you
[40:52] watch this game and you know you just
[40:55] tell us what you think and so they did
[40:56] this with a number of students and at
[40:58] the end of it
[40:59] the the results was just unbelievable
[41:01] the the let me quote here it says they
[41:04] said it seems clear that the game was
[41:08] actually very many different games and
[41:11] that each version of the events that
[41:13] transpired was just as real to the
[41:16] person watching it as it was as other
[41:19] versions were to other people
[41:22] that's that sounds it's kind of a little
[41:24] bit wordy but let me let me kind of
[41:25] maybe break that down and make it real
[41:27] simple
[41:28] those people what what they discovered
[41:30] was they were not just seeing the game
[41:33] that they were watching they were seeing
[41:36] things that happened in the past
[41:39] that was their reality it wasn't that
[41:41] this particular foul even literally even
[41:44] happened but as they were watching it
[41:46] their minds were so consumed with the
[41:49] things of the past that they made that
[41:51] their reality in this game
[41:54] that no it didn't matter if it was a
[41:56] foul today or a foul 10 years ago there
[42:00] was a foul and that foul was Unforgiven
[42:02] and that people could not move past that
[42:04] and influenced their reality of what
[42:07] they were viewing and everybody was
[42:09] different everybody saw different things
[42:10] because they all had different views and
[42:13] different things in their past but it
[42:15] was real to them
[42:17] it wasn't it was real that was a reality
[42:20] they they fought for it they fought over
[42:22] it they busted each other up it was
[42:24] crazy
[42:26] in in
[42:27] the scientists ended up calling it they
[42:29] made this term they called it motivated
[42:30] perception which which means that you
[42:34] see what you want to see you see what
[42:36] you want to see in things whatever's in
[42:39] your heart you know the always get
[42:41] cautious because you know some people
[42:43] might say well brother John you're
[42:44] preaching psychology but it's it's not
[42:46] psychology in the way that we think of
[42:49] psychology we kind of think of
[42:51] psychology in in the light of how
[42:53] brother Branham was accused of of doing
[42:55] psychology in a prayer line and people
[42:58] said that when he when he uh uh when
[43:01] when the spirit when the Holy Spirit was
[43:03] Discerning thoughts intents of the heart
[43:04] or when he was healed it somehow was
[43:07] some sort of a mental trick or they
[43:08] called it psychology but that's that's
[43:10] not that's not what we're preaching here
[43:12] today what we're preaching is that
[43:14] people naturally in their minds can view
[43:17] things differently than one another
[43:18] because of their past experiences
[43:22] just bear with me
[43:25] just bear with me because I found this
[43:26] interesting because I often wonder why
[43:28] does why does somebody interpret
[43:30] something that that is done so
[43:32] completely different than the intent
[43:34] that was done behind it why is it that
[43:36] when you do something with the purest
[43:38] attempt the purest motive to help
[43:40] someone they can interpret it that
[43:42] you're cursing them that you have it out
[43:44] for them and all you're trying to do is
[43:45] help them and the pastor knows because
[43:47] in the pastor says Amen to this I know
[43:49] in his heart because he sit there try to
[43:52] help someone help someone and then they
[43:53] leave the church because he's attacking
[43:55] me
[43:56] it happens over and over and over and
[43:58] over
[44:00] and that and the unfortunate thing is is
[44:03] that person often that's the reality
[44:05] because of their past and the things
[44:07] that they've gone through they they
[44:08] cannot possibly understand unless by the
[44:11] grace of God that the pastor is truly
[44:13] trying to help them all they see is the
[44:16] attack and it is that's their reality
[44:18] and you say well brother John this is
[44:19] psychology but let's go to another
[44:22] scripture if you will you don't have to
[44:24] turn with it I'll read it for you as uh
[44:26] Genesis 13.
[44:28] people and and remember now I'm asking
[44:31] what what do you see what sea is that
[44:33] what do you look at and what do you see
[44:34] in Genesis 13 Abraham and lot you know
[44:37] the story Abraham said a lot let there
[44:40] be no Strife between you and me and
[44:42] between my hurdles and yours for we're
[44:43] kin is not the whole land before you let
[44:46] us separate
[44:47] uh if you go north I will go south and
[44:49] if you go south I'll go north and lot
[44:51] looked around him and he saw how well
[44:53] watered the whole plane of Jordan was
[44:55] and it was it was like before God this
[44:58] was before God had destroyed Sodom and
[45:00] Gomorrah and it was like the garden of
[45:03] the Lord the Garden of Eden like the
[45:04] land of Egypt it was a beautiful land
[45:07] in a desert remember you know that the
[45:09] Middle East there's desert and let me
[45:11] tell you I've been there it gets hot it
[45:14] gets it gets just unbelievably hot a
[45:17] hundred uh don't ask me to convert from
[45:19] us Americans or Fahrenheit and U-Haul
[45:22] here or Celsius but let me tell you it
[45:24] gets hot uh it gets so hot that uh you
[45:28] could cook us cook a steak on the on the
[45:30] ground it it just it's unbelievably hot
[45:33] and um so you can imagine that you
[45:36] remember they were wandering from a city
[45:38] in search of the land that God would
[45:40] show him and so his brother-in-law was
[45:43] going with them and they've traveled
[45:44] along the edges of of where the cities
[45:47] were and so they were in the desert most
[45:49] of the time and the desert's hot and lot
[45:52] looked out and he saw this plane and it
[45:54] was well watered plenty of room for us
[45:57] flocks beautiful country and so he chose
[46:00] himself it says for the whole plane of
[46:02] Jordan and he journeyed Eastward and
[46:04] they they departed from each other and
[46:07] Abraham ham remained in the Lana Canyon
[46:09] while lot settled in the cities of the
[46:11] plane pitching his tents towards Sodom
[46:13] now I just want to stop for just a
[46:16] moment there what did lot see
[46:19] he saw the cities and he saw the
[46:22] well-watered planes and he saw all this
[46:24] this Greenery outside of the desert
[46:27] he saw all of this and he said that's
[46:30] what I want
[46:32] but then it goes on and it says it gives
[46:34] us a little bit more information a
[46:36] little bit more insight Abraham remained
[46:38] in the land but then in the very next
[46:40] the very next scripture in verse 13 it
[46:43] says now the inhabitants of Sodom were
[46:46] very Wicked against God
[46:51] that that's the the difference between
[46:54] lot and Abraham
[46:56] lot saw something that his heart desire
[46:59] and when Abraham looked at it it doesn't
[47:01] say that Abraham saw the same things he
[47:04] saw the well-watered plane and he saw
[47:06] the grass and he saw the the beauty but
[47:09] he saw the sin of the place and he
[47:11] didn't want nothing to do with it
[47:13] a lot ended up pitching his tent towards
[47:15] Sodom and so is it two men looking at
[47:17] exactly the same same thing and they
[47:19] were both good Godly men remember a lot
[47:22] was righteous righteous Soul vexed by
[47:24] the sins of son but yet there was
[47:26] something in him that propelled and
[47:28] drove him to pitch his tit towards Sodom
[47:31] that every day he got a little bit
[47:33] closer until he found himself in the
[47:35] city
[47:36] amen and so uh you know and the
[47:38] beautiful thing of it is is after all of
[47:40] that you know uh God says to Abraham
[47:43] after he's departed said you know look
[47:45] North lookies look West look South and
[47:48] he said all of it's yours anyway
[47:51] and he said go and walk in he said go
[47:53] and walk in the land explore the breath
[47:56] of it walk to the north walk to the
[47:58] South look at all of it it's all yours
[48:00] every bit of it everything that lot had
[48:02] taken all the cities all the beautiful
[48:04] plain all of it is yours and lot did
[48:08] something very interesting there he says
[48:09] he built an altar of testimony an altar
[48:13] of worship to the Lord where he made it
[48:15] he drove a stake of remembrance down at
[48:18] a particular point in his life and said
[48:20] I will not forget this I will worship
[48:24] God for this and so many times I think
[48:27] we we fail to remember what God has done
[48:31] for us and it's good to go back and
[48:33] remember what God has done in our lives
[48:36] and that's why we say testimonies and we
[48:38] keep a remembrance and everything
[48:39] because many times we're we're easily
[48:42] discouraged many times we go through
[48:44] things and we say oh is the Lord even
[48:45] with us does the Lord love us and you
[48:47] have to go back and say no he does he
[48:49] does love this I remember when he did
[48:51] this we need to build altars of of
[48:54] worship and altars of remembrance and
[48:56] and you know we could spend a long time
[48:57] just talking about how Abraham built
[49:00] altars throughout his life uh it's it's
[49:03] just it's so incredible it's so deep and
[49:05] and uh you know the word is is is there
[49:09] and you know I encourage you and I know
[49:11] in the pastor tries to lead you through
[49:14] through the the scripture and to to look
[49:16] at the the good things of God and look
[49:19] at the promises and say yay Amen to
[49:21] everything that you don't have to to to
[49:23] accept being sick you don't have to
[49:26] accept living in a sinful condition you
[49:28] don't have to accept this setting sins
[49:30] in your life that you can overcome by
[49:32] the power of the word that you can
[49:34] overcome by the the holy spirit amen you
[49:37] can't get too too uh wrapped up around
[49:40] this world and the things of this world
[49:41] you know we we look at it like I was
[49:43] saying and and you know we're never
[49:44] going to change it we're not going to
[49:46] fix it you know it's just let me allow
[49:49] me to read you a quote
[49:51] uh brother Branham in the way of a true
[49:53] Prophet
[49:54] um if you're if you're a visitor or
[49:56] you're you're listening online and
[49:57] you've never heard of brother random We
[49:59] Believe brother random was a prophet
[50:01] sent in this last day
[50:03] um we we uh we believe that there's a
[50:05] restored word of Vindicated message that
[50:09] uh has made the Bible become alive uh in
[50:12] a new way to us amen and so uh if you
[50:15] have questions about that just ask our
[50:17] pastor and he'll be sure to point you in
[50:19] the right direction and answer anything
[50:21] you have the brother Branham he says
[50:23] this in 1963 in the in the message the
[50:25] way of a true Prophet let me just let me
[50:28] read a little bit here to get to the
[50:30] point he said you know he's talking
[50:31] about the United States he says our
[50:33] national debt is so great until we're
[50:35] paying on borrowed money off of taxes
[50:37] that we'll get 14 years from today he
[50:39] said what's what's going to happen when
[50:41] the system breaks Castro sure I'm
[50:43] against him he's a communist right I'm
[50:45] against him but he's done a good thing
[50:47] when he changed the currency and sent
[50:48] the gold back and he bought up the bonds
[50:50] and and he says we'll have to do that or
[50:53] there's one thing that'll be stuck in
[50:55] our face and that is at the Catholic
[50:56] Church owns the wealth of the world
[50:58] she's got the money she's got the goals
[51:00] to buy her bonds back
[51:02] we're in the same position today as that
[51:04] was back then the money currency doesn't
[51:07] matter if it's the United States or
[51:08] Canada or or any of it it's all paper
[51:11] money it's all fake money it's it's not
[51:14] even real it's not backed by anything
[51:16] except the promise of a government
[51:17] that'll turn us back on you the moment
[51:19] that they want to you can't trust them
[51:21] for nothing but they're the whole the
[51:23] whole system is a lie amen the whole
[51:27] system is a lie now listen to this and
[51:28] he says
[51:30] she he says he says you think these
[51:32] whiskey dealers and tobacco dealers and
[51:34] great people of the country won't sell
[51:36] out to keep from losing all their
[51:38] businesses and counterfeiting the
[51:40] currency
[51:42] don't you ever think that that the
[51:44] listen he says whiskey Peddlers and
[51:46] everything but do you think that that
[51:48] that corporations that make billions and
[51:51] billions of dollars on Pharmaceuticals
[51:54] and and drugs and chemicals and
[51:56] everything else we're gonna for one
[51:58] minute take a hit on their bottom line
[52:00] to do the right thing no they'll they'll
[52:03] they'll influence the governments
[52:04] they'll influence the Prime Minister and
[52:06] the parliaments and everything else to
[52:08] go and do exactly what brother Branham
[52:10] said that to get us into that system of
[52:13] being under bondage to the Catholic
[52:14] church we'll go right back to it mark my
[52:17] words and and I'm not a prophet but
[52:19] brother Brandon said it was thus saith
[52:20] the Lord amen so that's where where it's
[52:23] heading he says uh he goes on he says he
[52:25] says the Bible says that the wealth of
[52:27] the world found in the Catholic church
[52:28] he says I'm not a politician neither am
[52:30] I a smart man but I thank the Lord I
[52:32] know him he says you he says that's
[52:34] where it's going she's going right there
[52:36] you watch it you watch and see if that
[52:38] ain't right he says I I hope we'll all
[52:40] live to see it I don't think we'll have
[52:42] to live too long but he goes on and he
[52:44] says this is what I really wanted to get
[52:46] to he says how are we going to build a
[52:48] church how are we going to build a
[52:49] nation upon this now what are we going
[52:52] to do about it he said he kind of gets a
[52:55] little a little frustrated because he
[52:56] knows that this is you you know when you
[52:59] when you tell people the truth but they
[53:01] resist it they don't want to believe it
[53:04] amen because you know nobody wants to
[53:06] believe that they're that the people
[53:08] that they elect are going to do this we
[53:11] never want to believe that our system
[53:12] can collapse that that that the bad
[53:15] thing can happen here and so he just he
[53:17] he senses he senses that and he says you
[53:20] know he says maybe I I just I've said
[53:23] enough he says be this is what I want to
[53:25] get to here he says look what we want he
[53:28] says you see what you want that's what
[53:31] you get that's your desires
[53:34] you get what you want and it doesn't
[53:37] matter if it's if if it's a people
[53:39] voting in a system the heart of the
[53:41] people determines what the system is
[53:43] going to be in the heart of the the
[53:45] heart of the people desire because
[53:48] they're not converted because they're
[53:49] not born again because they don't serve
[53:51] God their their hearts desire a system
[53:54] that that'll that'll allow a beast
[53:56] system to take over and there's nothing
[53:59] that we can do about that there is
[54:01] absolutely we could stand on the preach
[54:02] on the on the street corners and preach
[54:04] we could hold up signs we could pick it
[54:07] we could we can get in a truck and we
[54:08] could go to Ottawa or wherever and we
[54:10] could we could Circle the capital and
[54:12] and it won't change a thing
[54:15] it may be a speed bump in the road to to
[54:18] that point but it will get to that point
[54:20] where where the the countries and the
[54:23] Nations all fall under that because
[54:25] that's been prophesied as Revelations
[54:27] it's been that way and and that's just
[54:29] the way it's going to go and he said
[54:30] well brother John will you just throw up
[54:32] our hands and not do anything no we have
[54:33] to be a lighthouse
[54:34] we have to be a light in the darkness
[54:37] that that this this truth this message
[54:39] stands for something and that there will
[54:41] be a people that will walk out of the
[54:44] the burning Cesspool that is these these
[54:47] countries and March into the kingdom of
[54:49] God and and we don't have to to hold our
[54:51] hands and ring them and say oh Lord help
[54:54] us or anything we have the power of the
[54:55] spoken word that that is there to to
[54:58] provide what we have need of I I say
[55:00] don't don't ever be afraid don't ever be
[55:02] afraid of what's coming or what you see
[55:04] around us you know we shake our heads
[55:06] but God has a preordained plan in place
[55:09] to to protect his people amen their
[55:12] brother random said before one atomic
[55:14] bomb would fall that the bride will be
[55:16] gone before before listen before there
[55:18] is calamities and catastrophes that
[55:21] would that would harm the bride of
[55:22] Christ they will be gone why worry why
[55:26] why get consumed about it why Feast on
[55:29] the news like some people do you know
[55:32] it's it's nothing but uh well but we'll
[55:35] just bring your soul and spirit down
[55:37] that's the whole point of it anyway you
[55:40] can't even you can't even read the news
[55:41] and find something that's not that's
[55:43] written without an agenda because
[55:45] there's there's an agenda to everything
[55:46] and that agenda is to cause Division and
[55:49] strife and confusion and and what's
[55:53] coming next and people have to come back
[55:55] to the news to see what's coming next
[55:56] and oh my goodness you know it's just
[55:58] it's ridiculous I I I just tell you stay
[56:01] away from it as much as you can
[56:02] concentrate upon the things of God read
[56:04] your Bible pray sweeten your life with
[56:07] prayer Watch what God will do in your
[56:09] life amen
[56:11] what what do you see when you look out
[56:14] there do you see the the well water
[56:17] planes of the world or do you look and
[56:20] you see the word of God being fulfilled
[56:22] do you see scripture coming to life in
[56:25] our in our lives where we see God is
[56:27] doing great things amongst his people it
[56:29] doesn't matter if there's five or ten or
[56:31] 20 here it doesn't matter because God
[56:34] has a people and there's there's a
[56:36] people that will overcome the the Bible
[56:39] talks and about a great falling away in
[56:42] the last days and and sometimes I think
[56:44] we're tempted to think that that great
[56:45] falling away is something in church
[56:47] nominal and you know it's interesting
[56:50] there's
[56:51] there's over 40 000 Christian
[56:53] denominations over forty thousand if you
[56:56] go and you look at how many Church
[56:57] buildings they are uh that that are
[57:00] available there's practically a a church
[57:02] for uh for every single person you know
[57:05] everybody can go to their own church you
[57:07] know it'd just be you and the pastor
[57:09] maybe or or maybe it's just you in the
[57:11] in press play and and and listen to a
[57:14] tape but there's there's a church for
[57:16] whatever you want you can go and find a
[57:18] church for you wanted Jesus that that's
[57:21] a baby Jesus in the manger that you know
[57:23] that there's a church for that you wanna
[57:25] you wanna Jesus that that'll love you
[57:27] and let you smoke cigarettes or go
[57:29] drinking or whatever there's a church
[57:30] that'll allow you to do that there's
[57:32] there's a church for whatever your heart
[57:34] desires whatever you want is going to be
[57:36] there to be fulfilled but there is a
[57:39] genuine truth a genuine church that God
[57:42] has preserved that's going to March this
[57:44] way up on out of here amen I believe
[57:46] that you know I just always go back to
[57:48] the the vision that brother Branham had
[57:49] of the of the bride and he know he saw
[57:52] the end time bride going through and he
[57:53] said you know the it was uh women
[57:57] dressed in a state of undress and he
[57:59] said they were they were March into
[58:00] heaven with boogly Wiggly music remember
[58:03] and rock and roll and he said they went
[58:05] and that's it ain't that the truth
[58:06] because if you ever listen to a modern
[58:08] day Christian Church you wouldn't know
[58:10] that you weren't in a rock concert
[58:11] anyhow and you go and and he said but
[58:14] then there was a bride that coming
[58:16] remember he got depressed about it in
[58:18] the vision he said you know oh Lord is
[58:19] this all I've done and this is what I
[58:22] can present to you and then there was
[58:24] then he said he heard the sound of
[58:26] another church tell me marching to the
[58:29] sound of Onward Christian Soldiers and
[58:31] there she was this marching lockstep
[58:33] everyone in order in in dressed the
[58:36] right way and doing the right so there
[58:38] is a church there is a bride there is a
[58:40] people that will overcome and I say Lord
[58:42] help us to be a part of it I believe it
[58:44] you know there I wish that there was
[58:46] something friends that that would drop
[58:48] down and just put it down and you know
[58:49] God would send down a heavenly messenger
[58:51] with the with a scroll or something you
[58:53] know and one day I just take the scroll
[58:54] and I'd open it up and say yes brother
[58:56] John you are invited you have made it
[58:58] you know but God's never going to do
[59:00] that even brother Branham the prophet he
[59:03] said you know I don't know but by faith
[59:04] I believe you know and so that's the way
[59:07] I approach it is I don't know but by
[59:08] faith I believe that you know there is
[59:10] something within the believer that
[59:11] pushes forward towards the prize towards
[59:14] the mic Mark of the high quality that
[59:16] will that will lay aside every weight
[59:18] and every sin that so doth easily beset
[59:21] and they're not going to look at the
[59:22] things of the world they're going to
[59:23] keep their eyes upon the vision upon
[59:25] what God has already promised he would
[59:27] do and we're going to walk into the
[59:29] vision amen I believe that don't you
[59:33] amen blessed be his name
[59:37] in the Book of Luke
[59:39] he
[59:40] Jesus asked his disciples another
[59:42] question
[59:43] he said uh
[59:45] some men came some men came to him and
[59:48] uh
[59:50] they uh they were Disciples of John the
[59:54] Baptist and he said that the men came
[59:56] they said John Baptist has sent us unto
[59:59] thee saying art thou he who should come
[1:00:01] or should we look for another talk about
[1:00:03] a brother Branham said you know his
[1:00:05] equal eyes got glazed over
[1:00:09] but that was the prophet that was the
[1:00:13] prophet of of the day until until Jesus
[1:00:16] began his ministry at a certain point
[1:00:18] there was no greater message believer
[1:00:21] than John the Baptist he did everything
[1:00:23] right he did before ordained to to to do
[1:00:26] his ministry and so much so that that
[1:00:30] Jesus said there wasn't a prophet ever
[1:00:32] liking that no one greater no one
[1:00:35] greater he said so they came to him they
[1:00:38] said they asked this question that John
[1:00:40] had sent them are you he or should we
[1:00:42] look for another and so Jesus didn't
[1:00:44] answer them but what he did is Isaiah
[1:00:46] stood off to the side and in that same
[1:00:48] hour he cured many of their infirmities
[1:00:51] and plagues and evil spirits and blind
[1:00:54] were given sight and he let his Works
[1:00:58] testify of who he was
[1:01:00] he said this is what I am doing this
[1:01:03] testifies of who I am and then Jesus
[1:01:06] finally answered him and said you know
[1:01:07] here's your answer go your way and tell
[1:01:09] John what things you have seen and heard
[1:01:12] how the blinds see the lame walk the
[1:01:14] lepers are cleansed to death here the
[1:01:16] dead are raised and to the poor the
[1:01:18] gospel was preached you see they saw
[1:01:19] they stood there for that time period it
[1:01:22] says in that same hour that they saw all
[1:01:25] of this in one hour they saw the dead
[1:01:28] race to life the blinded eyes open the
[1:01:30] deaf hearing evil spirits cast out
[1:01:34] now
[1:01:35] people can look and say
[1:01:38] that's telepathy that's psychology
[1:01:42] or you can look and say the kingdom of
[1:01:43] God is at hand
[1:01:46] he's he said he goes on and he says he
[1:01:49] said blessed is he who shall not be
[1:01:51] offended in me
[1:01:54] there's a lot of people let me bring in
[1:01:56] a little bit a little bit closer down to
[1:01:58] home this morning is that there are a
[1:02:00] lot of people who have become offended
[1:02:03] in me today there are a lot of people
[1:02:05] that have become offended at the message
[1:02:08] and at the messenger
[1:02:10] and I say that's that's because that is
[1:02:12] because their eyes are on the wrong
[1:02:14] thing
[1:02:15] and not just that they're looking and
[1:02:18] seeing something because they can look
[1:02:20] and they hear the testimony they see
[1:02:22] listen you know when brother Branham was
[1:02:24] here people were afraid of death to go
[1:02:26] before him in a prayer line because he
[1:02:28] might reveal the secrets of their heart
[1:02:30] afraid to death but once the man left
[1:02:32] you know now we can say things about him
[1:02:34] and then people got bold and courageous
[1:02:39] blessed is he who is not offended in me
[1:02:42] amen and when the messenger said John
[1:02:44] were departed he began to speak to the
[1:02:45] people concerning John he said what went
[1:02:47] you out into the Wilderness to see a
[1:02:49] reed shaking in the wind a man closed in
[1:02:52] soft rainment
[1:02:54] what wouldn't you have to see a prophet
[1:02:56] and I say unto you much more than a
[1:02:59] prophet
[1:03:00] much more than a prophet is what we had
[1:03:02] in our day much more than just just
[1:03:05] somebody who who took the Bible and had
[1:03:07] an idea and thought I think it means
[1:03:09] this or you know this person says that
[1:03:11] and he and brother Brandon somehow came
[1:03:13] up with this masterful you know
[1:03:16] manipulation and no no no no
[1:03:21] the message is true
[1:03:23] the word of God is true that came in our
[1:03:26] day has changed our Bible and made it a
[1:03:29] new book
[1:03:31] people throughout the ages have longed
[1:03:33] to know the things that we know and see
[1:03:35] the things that we say but people become
[1:03:38] offended
[1:03:39] in him
[1:03:41] and they become and believe me if you're
[1:03:44] if you become offended in brother
[1:03:46] Brandon you'll be offended in Jesus
[1:03:49] because brother branham's Ministry was
[1:03:52] the son of man Ministry
[1:03:54] a son of man revealing these son of man
[1:03:56] my I like I said I I wonder it's like
[1:03:58] how do how do people uh look at things
[1:04:02] and see the same things and hear the
[1:04:04] same testimony and and and yet view it
[1:04:07] so completely different
[1:04:10] and uh and I I have to go back and I
[1:04:14] think it's because I I really do I think
[1:04:16] it's because there's things in people's
[1:04:18] hearts that they've gone through and
[1:04:20] things that they've endured and things
[1:04:21] that they've seen that warp their
[1:04:23] reality and warp their perception of
[1:04:25] things
[1:04:26] you know for so for so long we built up
[1:04:29] this idea and you and let's you've heard
[1:04:31] it if you have don't raise your hand
[1:04:33] because we've all been there when
[1:04:35] somebody has said that well Christian
[1:04:36] wouldn't do that and they've seen you do
[1:04:38] something well if you were a Christian
[1:04:39] you wouldn't do that
[1:04:41] and people we've raised this idea
[1:04:44] somehow that if you are a message
[1:04:46] believer or if you're a brother and then
[1:04:48] you have to be completely perfect that
[1:04:50] you have to you cannot make a mistake
[1:04:52] that you know and that's and as much as
[1:04:56] I would love that to be the reality of
[1:04:58] things that I could walk through life
[1:04:59] and never make a mistake the fact of the
[1:05:00] matter is is John Garrett is a sinful
[1:05:02] man and John Garrett sins every day and
[1:05:04] I backslide every day but by the grace
[1:05:07] of God and the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:05:08] will overcome and that's the that's the
[1:05:11] the truth for every Christian believer
[1:05:13] but people have something in their
[1:05:15] hearts that desires things around them
[1:05:19] that that desire the cities of Sodom and
[1:05:21] the things of the world and they sit in
[1:05:23] a message church and they chafe under
[1:05:26] what they would call legalism or
[1:05:28] restrictions and Bounds and they chafe
[1:05:30] at it and it's just like a noose around
[1:05:32] their neck a collar and a leash and so
[1:05:34] they they look and they they want to get
[1:05:36] get away from it
[1:05:38] so
[1:05:40] you think about it why why do people
[1:05:42] when they when they leave when they
[1:05:44] leave church the first things they start
[1:05:46] doing it is cutting their hair
[1:05:48] for for a woman and I'm not going to
[1:05:50] preach all the women but one of the
[1:05:51] first things that a woman will do when
[1:05:52] she leaves the word will go and cut her
[1:05:54] hair
[1:05:55] why is that well you can look at it and
[1:05:58] you can say uh
[1:06:01] well it's it's a it's a headship thing
[1:06:03] she's no longer headship of the church
[1:06:04] you know but but you know you could you
[1:06:07] could put a lot of type of connotations
[1:06:08] to it but you know the thing is his
[1:06:10] brother Brandon said this about Sin and
[1:06:11] I I really hope this sinks in that you
[1:06:13] understand it you get where I'm coming
[1:06:15] from is he said drinking smoking lying
[1:06:17] cheating all that stuff is not sin he
[1:06:19] said that's the attributes of sin see
[1:06:21] you do that because you don't believe if
[1:06:23] you believe the word of God you would
[1:06:24] believe in sanctification you would
[1:06:26] believe in Holiness and you would follow
[1:06:27] it and so you know the thing is is when
[1:06:30] a woman goes out and she cuts her hair
[1:06:31] it isn't that that she cut her hair is
[1:06:34] the sin that's not the sin the sin
[1:06:36] actually is what's expressing is coming
[1:06:38] out from what's in her heart is that she
[1:06:40] doesn't believe the sin is the unbelief
[1:06:42] she doesn't believe the word of God and
[1:06:44] so you know I I think really the the
[1:06:47] saddest part about it is is that in that
[1:06:49] sin they feel free
[1:06:52] there's a there's a freedom to them to
[1:06:54] go out and do something that that was
[1:06:57] bad or you couldn't do you know some of
[1:06:59] the hollers restricted and so they go
[1:07:01] out and they say I'm free to do whatever
[1:07:02] I want to do now you know and and so
[1:07:04] they're they're the the sin is the
[1:07:06] estrangement from God and let me tell
[1:07:08] you that is actually that is actually
[1:07:10] hell on Earth
[1:07:12] what that is Hell on Earth let me
[1:07:14] explain that is because brother Branham
[1:07:15] said that hell in Eternal damnation is
[1:07:19] separation from God
[1:07:21] that that is what it is and so when you
[1:07:23] fall out and you and you run away from
[1:07:26] the message you run away from God and
[1:07:28] you run away from what we've been taught
[1:07:29] and we know to be true whether you
[1:07:31] believe the message or not whether you
[1:07:33] if you believe the Bible and you run
[1:07:35] away from this you are separating
[1:07:36] willfully separating yourself from God
[1:07:39] and you are in a Hell on Earth
[1:07:43] amen but that's the age that we live in
[1:07:46] the people that we live in uh it's it's
[1:07:49] amazing you know uh brother Branham he
[1:07:51] said he said this
[1:07:53] um for everything that that people seem
[1:07:55] to have a thing about psychology brother
[1:07:57] bran talks about an awful lot he said uh
[1:08:00] uh he was he said I heard a commentary a
[1:08:02] commentator say not long ago that 85
[1:08:04] percent of the North American people
[1:08:06] were mentally Disturbed think of it 85
[1:08:09] percent of the people on the North
[1:08:11] American continent has something wrong
[1:08:13] mentally this was in 57 he said they're
[1:08:16] going at a Breakneck speed they're
[1:08:18] rushing going and they don't know where
[1:08:20] they're going it's a nervous age what is
[1:08:22] it he said then I give the solemn
[1:08:24] warning to the church stand still
[1:08:27] he said God always commands to stand
[1:08:29] still before he does anything and he
[1:08:32] said the churches not not the world this
[1:08:34] night goes to the churches he says the
[1:08:36] churches is in a neurotic stage
[1:08:40] church is proselytizing and pulling it
[1:08:42] fussing and stewing stand still
[1:08:46] stand still
[1:08:48] I I I thought you know that's incredible
[1:08:51] I I thought I wonder what it what it is
[1:08:53] today what what if I could go through
[1:08:55] and look it up and see what it is and so
[1:08:57] I kind of was wondering what that study
[1:08:59] was and I went out and I was trying to
[1:09:00] find it and I found a survey that said
[1:09:03] more than 23 percent of adults between
[1:09:06] age 18 and 44 have received mental
[1:09:09] health treatment in the past 12 months
[1:09:12] and that's an increase in the last year
[1:09:15] from 18.5 percent so basically that's
[1:09:17] one in four
[1:09:19] one in four people are going to now I'm
[1:09:22] not against
[1:09:23] I'm not against people going to the
[1:09:25] doctors if you need to go to a
[1:09:27] psychiatrist or a psychologist to help
[1:09:29] you deal with something I'm not saying
[1:09:30] don't go uh if if that's what your faith
[1:09:33] is and it'll help you then you know I
[1:09:36] believe the Lord can work through
[1:09:37] through doctors but it's incredible in
[1:09:40] Canada nearly 28 percent reported
[1:09:42] negative mental health another Canadian
[1:09:44] poll said that in any given year one in
[1:09:47] five people will personally experience a
[1:09:49] mental health problem or illness and by
[1:09:51] age 40 50 of the population will have
[1:09:55] had or will have a mental illness
[1:10:00] we're living in a neurotic age
[1:10:03] and you wonder all all of Hell being
[1:10:07] against the believer why we struggle
[1:10:09] sometimes and we wonder why is it so
[1:10:12] difficult and we wonder why how can
[1:10:15] somebody sit in the same Pew as us hear
[1:10:18] the same word and then go out from
[1:10:20] amongst us and it's because of these
[1:10:23] reasons there's mental illness in the
[1:10:26] church there's mental illness and I
[1:10:28] listen friends don't don't take it like
[1:10:30] I'm stigmatizing mental illness if you
[1:10:32] got problems you need to talk to
[1:10:33] somebody that psychology that's what the
[1:10:36] pastor does when he gives you counsel is
[1:10:38] is you don't have a psychologist degree
[1:10:41] to to talk to someone and say why why
[1:10:43] are you you go to the pastor and you say
[1:10:45] hey I'm I'm I'm struggling with this or
[1:10:48] I'm struggling with that and the pastor
[1:10:50] says well
[1:10:51] one of the first questions is why do you
[1:10:53] think you're struggling with that
[1:10:55] that's like that's what people think
[1:10:58] psychology is that's just that's just
[1:11:01] talking to people
[1:11:02] that's just that's just giving counsel
[1:11:04] and trying to get to the root of the
[1:11:06] problem you know and then I I love it
[1:11:08] you know because we we have this thing
[1:11:10] in the message it and I hope I'm not
[1:11:12] stepping on any toes this morning but
[1:11:15] um
[1:11:15] let's say they say people say well you
[1:11:18] just get the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost will take care well and that's
[1:11:21] true there's a lot of Truth in just
[1:11:23] getting the Holy Ghost and Watching God
[1:11:25] change your life absolutely true but I
[1:11:27] can tell you as a as a young married man
[1:11:29] that I had the holy ghost that I still
[1:11:32] struggled now I still had problems in
[1:11:35] the and I had the Holy Ghost and I still
[1:11:37] was not a good husband and I still was
[1:11:39] not a good father and the Holy Ghost has
[1:11:41] come to teach us and lead us and guide
[1:11:43] us into all truth and bring into
[1:11:45] remembrance all that's been taught to us
[1:11:46] and then the pastor comes and then he
[1:11:49] preaches a sermon about how to be a
[1:11:50] better husband and be a better father
[1:11:52] and people want to say well that's
[1:11:54] psychology or that's you know that's
[1:11:56] just a self-help book or something like
[1:11:58] that but that's not what it is the Holy
[1:12:00] Ghost comes and teaches you how to be a
[1:12:04] better daddy how to be a better husband
[1:12:06] and how to how listen if you we learn by
[1:12:10] example or you don't learn at all you
[1:12:12] know and so some of us didn't grow up
[1:12:14] with the greatest examples of what a
[1:12:16] daddy look like some of us didn't grow
[1:12:18] up with the greatest examples of what a
[1:12:20] husband should do and how a husband
[1:12:21] should treat a wife and you get the you
[1:12:23] get the Holy Ghost and you're married
[1:12:25] but then your wife is still crying in
[1:12:27] the in the bedroom you know three hours
[1:12:29] a day or is under some sort of
[1:12:30] depression and you can go to her and you
[1:12:32] can and you can cast that out you know
[1:12:34] or or you can do it brother Brandon said
[1:12:36] and bring her flowers
[1:12:38] and you can change the atmosphere amen
[1:12:41] so it what is it it's it's acting
[1:12:44] according to understanding according to
[1:12:46] knowledge it's not psychology it is to
[1:12:48] sit there and say uh if you're if you're
[1:12:51] behaving a certain way what's causing
[1:12:53] that behavior
[1:12:54] you know it and now now granted you
[1:12:57] sometimes sometimes at friends it is a
[1:12:59] devil and he's cast out sometimes you do
[1:13:02] need a dose of the Holy Spirit and some
[1:13:04] five-fold Ministry in your life but
[1:13:06] there there are times when when you can
[1:13:07] look at things and you can say
[1:13:09] we'll take for a little child that falls
[1:13:12] into a to the bath in the bathtub and
[1:13:14] say they're a toddler and then they grow
[1:13:16] up in their 10 12 years old and they
[1:13:18] won't they won't get into a pool or or
[1:13:20] or go canoeing on a creek or something
[1:13:23] like that and they're afraid to death of
[1:13:24] you don't sit there and tell the child
[1:13:25] uh just get the Holy Ghost and you'll be
[1:13:28] able to get into the the canoe
[1:13:30] why are they afraid of the water and
[1:13:32] then so you start working with them and
[1:13:34] start teaching them it's not it's okay
[1:13:35] the water's safe you can be safe you
[1:13:37] don't have to be afraid of the water and
[1:13:39] that's that's like a natural thing but
[1:13:41] I'm talking I hope you catch it that
[1:13:43] we're talking spiritual here amen that's
[1:13:46] the natural but the spiritual is people
[1:13:47] come to church and and then they they're
[1:13:49] afraid of the pastor and they're
[1:13:50] suspicious because of the things that
[1:13:52] have gone on in their past and the bad
[1:13:54] pastors and the bad Ministry that
[1:13:56] they've been under and the things that
[1:13:57] they've seen where churches fall apart
[1:13:59] and and people speak evil and lies about
[1:14:01] each other and they come to a new church
[1:14:03] and then and then they can't accept help
[1:14:05] from the pastor because their heart
[1:14:06] they're so scared they're they're afraid
[1:14:08] they're traumatized from the things that
[1:14:10] happen in their past
[1:14:11] and so you can sit on the Pew and you
[1:14:13] can hear the pastor say good honest
[1:14:16] truthful life-changing word and you can
[1:14:19] sit there and say yay and amen and the
[1:14:20] person's sitting right behind you and
[1:14:22] the Pew next to you can sit there and
[1:14:23] say he's attacking me
[1:14:26] yeah that's what it is what do you see
[1:14:27] what's your reality and what's cloudy in
[1:14:30] your reality
[1:14:31] amen God God ordained pastors for a
[1:14:34] reason and he put them in our in our
[1:14:35] lives and I believe that and I think we
[1:14:38] ought to get right behind the man of God
[1:14:39] and we ought to pull and and if you come
[1:14:41] to a church you ought to trust the
[1:14:43] pastor until they've prove them that
[1:14:44] they can't be trusted
[1:14:46] you you let him prove you wrong but if
[1:14:49] you feel God's LED you to a place you
[1:14:50] stick with it until you're proven
[1:14:51] otherwise amen
[1:14:56] I think you know we talk well brother
[1:14:59] John psychology psychology
[1:15:02] but
[1:15:03] if you don't know you don't know
[1:15:06] you think about the one time your
[1:15:08] husband how we I'm just thinking you
[1:15:10] know how we get wounded by things how we
[1:15:13] get how we get hurt and how how that
[1:15:15] causes us to respond in the future and I
[1:15:18] bring it to to the family and the first
[1:15:20] time that a that a wife asks a husband
[1:15:22] you know does this dress make me look
[1:15:24] fat
[1:15:25] and you you know being young and naive
[1:15:28] and and in love you well she wants to
[1:15:31] hear the truth and so you
[1:15:34] well that does look a little snug
[1:15:37] that does uh
[1:15:38] that does not uh
[1:15:40] well anyway it doesn't matter what you
[1:15:42] say it doesn't matter how you say
[1:15:45] because I can tell you it's the wrong
[1:15:46] thing to say
[1:15:53] and your wife
[1:15:55] is traumatized from that time forward
[1:15:58] your wife will never your wife will
[1:16:00] never ask you that question again
[1:16:02] without wondering if you're going to
[1:16:03] tell her the truth
[1:16:05] she'll never put on a dress again and
[1:16:07] look in the mirror and and have
[1:16:09] confidence that her husband truly finds
[1:16:11] her attractive
[1:16:14] trauma and and he it doesn't matter how
[1:16:18] much you love it doesn't matter how much
[1:16:19] you try to change it there there are
[1:16:21] things that leave indelible marks on our
[1:16:23] lives that that it takes God to move
[1:16:26] past or for a hubby it takes a lot of
[1:16:29] work
[1:16:30] but that's that becomes a reality you
[1:16:32] know and so often you know I think one
[1:16:34] of the worst things that we can do as
[1:16:35] parents is equate uh equate food to
[1:16:41] um approval
[1:16:43] I I I I would never I would tell parents
[1:16:47] never tell your children this this is
[1:16:49] just
[1:16:49] Lord help me this is just pastoral
[1:16:51] preaching but you should never tell your
[1:16:53] children uh that make it where if they
[1:16:57] don't clean their plate at dinner time
[1:17:00] because we've all done it eat your food
[1:17:02] or else
[1:17:04] you know you better eat it we prepared
[1:17:07] it and so and so they eat their food
[1:17:09] they stuff their their face to the gills
[1:17:11] and they go home they go to bed and they
[1:17:15] got all that food on their stomach and
[1:17:17] then they start getting a little bit
[1:17:18] pudgy a little bit more pudgy a little
[1:17:20] bit more pudgy and the next thing you
[1:17:21] know that now they're they're worried
[1:17:23] about how they appear in their
[1:17:25] appearance and they're 10 year old girls
[1:17:27] 11 year old girls and now they're
[1:17:29] worried and what it is is we we start
[1:17:31] equating a mom and dad's approval to to
[1:17:35] eating our food and and that sort of
[1:17:38] thing you see what I'm saying
[1:17:39] so it'd be better just to go ahead and
[1:17:41] sit in a bit they're not hungry they're
[1:17:42] not hungry
[1:17:44] yeah
[1:17:45] the things that we do the behaviors that
[1:17:48] we learn
[1:17:49] have lifetime influence and impact in
[1:17:53] our life
[1:17:56] there's a I thought this was interesting
[1:17:58] there's there's two kinds of memory you
[1:18:00] see he says um
[1:18:01] uh there's there's our conscious
[1:18:03] experience which is logical and uh we
[1:18:07] think about it but there's another level
[1:18:09] of experience and and that experience is
[1:18:12] how something makes you feel
[1:18:14] and so
[1:18:16] you know you can you can experience
[1:18:18] something and you understand it you
[1:18:20] understand why it happened you
[1:18:21] understand how it happened but the way
[1:18:23] that it makes you feel can alter your
[1:18:27] your experience and not just a real
[1:18:28] simple way to illustrate that is I I
[1:18:31] don't know if this has ever happened to
[1:18:32] you but I've heard I've had people say
[1:18:34] God bless you
[1:18:36] and I know that they mean it and I've
[1:18:38] had people say God bless you and I know
[1:18:40] they mean God needs to bless me with the
[1:18:42] trials of job and
[1:18:44] and they they don't have any type of
[1:18:46] blessing in mind when they're saying God
[1:18:48] bless you
[1:18:49] uh Matt they they they they they're
[1:18:51] sitting there thinking that the the you
[1:18:53] know God's thoughts are are good towards
[1:18:56] us and their thoughts are not good their
[1:18:58] thoughts are are evil towards us
[1:19:02] but you could feel it you could feel
[1:19:04] those things you could feel
[1:19:09] with things and then we'll either avoid
[1:19:11] it or sometimes we'll want more of it
[1:19:13] but you know it's the the way things
[1:19:16] make us feel creates a a unconscious way
[1:19:21] where we we either avoid something or we
[1:19:24] want more of it
[1:19:25] and so you know I I wonder for for a lot
[1:19:29] you know what it was in him that that he
[1:19:33] so loved the things of the world that he
[1:19:35] started pitching his his tents and if
[1:19:37] you remember a lot they they had left
[1:19:39] the city and they were journeying
[1:19:40] throughout the the land and
[1:19:43] he was a city person he loved the city
[1:19:45] he loved the things of the world he
[1:19:47] loved the Comforts a lot probably didn't
[1:19:49] like pitching his tent ever every day in
[1:19:52] a new place he probably didn't like you
[1:19:54] know happened to to walk behind the
[1:19:56] cattle herds and and uh you know pick
[1:19:59] his way through the the manure you know
[1:20:01] he probably got tired of hearing his
[1:20:03] wife complain about you know the the
[1:20:05] Joneses next door in the same tent it
[1:20:07] has the same Joneses for for years and
[1:20:09] years and years you know and so there
[1:20:11] was something in him that that desire
[1:20:15] uh an experience that he had had before
[1:20:20] and so
[1:20:22] he he pitched his tent towards a place
[1:20:24] that would provide him what his heart
[1:20:27] desired
[1:20:28] and that's where where we we have to be
[1:20:31] be so cautious as and I believe that
[1:20:34] when the Holy Spirit comes and you're
[1:20:35] baptized with the holy spirit that he
[1:20:37] can heal change your nature
[1:20:40] on the inside
[1:20:42] but we have to be cautious because you
[1:20:44] know why do people struggle why do
[1:20:45] people have such a difficult time with
[1:20:48] with things in their life when they come
[1:20:50] to church and they say they've got the
[1:20:51] Holy Ghost so many times that Holy Ghost
[1:20:52] is is on the flesh it's on the spirit
[1:20:55] realm but it's not sunk down into the
[1:20:57] soul and so they're changing their life
[1:21:00] to match up because of well you know the
[1:21:03] Bible says it and they got all these
[1:21:04] good reasons of doing it but it's not a
[1:21:06] heart change right it's not something
[1:21:08] that's coming from the inside so then
[1:21:10] they struggle all the years with well I
[1:21:12] think I should be able to cut my hair I
[1:21:14] think I should be able to to wear my
[1:21:15] dresses a little bit shorter I think I
[1:21:17] should be able to to go out and have the
[1:21:19] occasional drink with the guys from work
[1:21:20] I think I should be able to do this and
[1:21:22] so they struggle with that for for for
[1:21:24] years and years and and sin because the
[1:21:28] Holy Ghost is on on the the flesh it's
[1:21:31] on the spirit but it's not coming to the
[1:21:33] soul
[1:21:33] and it takes a soul change to be changed
[1:21:37] listen because if we change ourselves if
[1:21:40] we change ourselves that's mental
[1:21:42] telepathy that's just doing psychology
[1:21:44] but when God comes and changes us
[1:21:47] that's when you were changed
[1:21:49] amen
[1:21:52] I think I think people a lot of times I
[1:21:53] I compare it like this people are people
[1:21:55] are like horses in that how many have
[1:21:59] ever been around horses anybody ever had
[1:22:01] the opportunity I love horses they're
[1:22:02] beautiful animals I think they're one of
[1:22:04] God's greatest Creations but horses are
[1:22:07] horses are crazy they're all crazy
[1:22:09] they just some of it hide it better than
[1:22:11] others but you're around a horse horses
[1:22:14] are are reactive animals they're
[1:22:16] reactive and and if you've ever been
[1:22:19] around you know no matter how much you
[1:22:21] love a horse no matter how long you've
[1:22:22] had a horse you cannot fully trust a
[1:22:24] horse because a horse will will jump and
[1:22:28] spook at nothing
[1:22:30] now you could you know
[1:22:32] you could be sitting there brushing your
[1:22:34] horse it's a calm day and you know
[1:22:36] you're giving your horse a bath with the
[1:22:37] hose and and talking to it and that
[1:22:40] horse will see a butterfly flap its
[1:22:42] wings and create a shadow and and kick
[1:22:44] you over the shed
[1:22:46] and that's a horse that's a reaction
[1:22:48] it's not thinking about it it's not
[1:22:50] thinking about oh that's just a
[1:22:51] butterfly it sees something and it
[1:22:53] reacts and people are a lot like that
[1:22:56] for the Holy Ghost and they they hear
[1:22:58] something and then they react to it
[1:23:00] instead of stopping and just thinking
[1:23:02] about it for a few minutes they just
[1:23:04] react to it and so
[1:23:06] the the you know the the thing about it
[1:23:08] when we talk and I'm trying to bring
[1:23:10] natural and spiritual and trying to
[1:23:12] bring all this together to paint this
[1:23:14] picture that that people do things
[1:23:16] unconsciously because of of their
[1:23:18] experiences and so we need to have Grace
[1:23:21] for people we need to have Grace for
[1:23:23] those who who walk away and leave us and
[1:23:26] we need to to never just you know say
[1:23:28] well they left so their serpent seed or
[1:23:30] you know and just put them out because
[1:23:33] that's that's not what God did
[1:23:36] the the scriptural model when somebody
[1:23:38] leaves as the shepherd goes after the
[1:23:40] one the shepherd leaves the 99 and goes
[1:23:42] after the one the shepherd bears with
[1:23:44] them that's the scriptural model it
[1:23:46] isn't that we just cast them away and we
[1:23:48] never we never think of them or or
[1:23:50] anything but that's the person we ought
[1:23:51] to pray for you know maybe send them a
[1:23:53] card every once I don't mean go
[1:23:56] I always hate because you sometimes you
[1:23:58] just feel like you have to clarify now I
[1:24:00] don't mean that that we just you know
[1:24:01] somebody leaves and they they start
[1:24:03] drinking and carousing that doesn't mean
[1:24:04] you go to the to to enjoy their parties
[1:24:07] with them no but you you you get them on
[1:24:11] your environment if you can you don't
[1:24:13] let them influence you you try to to be
[1:24:15] an influence to them
[1:24:17] but people are people react and it's
[1:24:19] because of those things that have
[1:24:21] happened in their past and you wonder
[1:24:23] sometimes like why you say something
[1:24:25] from a Pulpit or you you say something
[1:24:27] and the next thing you know a person
[1:24:28] just leaves the church and they're and
[1:24:30] they're out the door and they they never
[1:24:31] come back it's because of these things
[1:24:33] that they've experienced in their life
[1:24:34] and then they just react instead of
[1:24:36] thinking about it and and I go back and
[1:24:38] say the Holy Ghost has given us a sound
[1:24:40] mind
[1:24:41] it's not given us the spirit of fear and
[1:24:43] of anxiety you know if the pastor says
[1:24:45] something to us and and gives us
[1:24:48] teaching of the pulpit it probably if
[1:24:50] your first reaction is to run away you
[1:24:52] know it probably behooves us to actually
[1:24:55] stop and just kind of think of things
[1:24:56] about it for just a few minutes and sit
[1:24:59] there and take it take a listen and say
[1:25:00] you know Lord does this really apply to
[1:25:02] my life or not and if it doesn't okay
[1:25:03] well you know maybe that's not for you
[1:25:05] but if it if it applies to it it's
[1:25:08] something that God has given the the man
[1:25:10] of God to speak
[1:25:12] um there may be it it behooves us to
[1:25:15] take a listen to I was preaching here
[1:25:16] recently at a church and um
[1:25:19] boy I tell you I just I think I'm just
[1:25:21] gonna have to just put this away because
[1:25:23] we're not doing notes at all
[1:25:25] that's that's okay
[1:25:29] I was preaching at a church here
[1:25:30] recently and uh the uh uh
[1:25:34] a sister came up afterwards and she she
[1:25:37] said uh she said you know every every
[1:25:40] the things that you said was word for
[1:25:43] word the conversations that we were
[1:25:45] having it was like you were sitting in
[1:25:48] our living room listening to us talk
[1:25:52] that's not me and that's not John
[1:25:54] Garrett that's not the pastor that's
[1:25:56] that's the spirit of God the discerner
[1:25:58] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:25:59] the word coming and speaking directly to
[1:26:02] a person
[1:26:03] and they were dealing with things in
[1:26:05] their life and it with their husband and
[1:26:07] that that God would come and and speak
[1:26:10] directly to that person send someone
[1:26:12] from five six seven hours away to come
[1:26:14] and talk to them and deal with their
[1:26:16] situation they were they were good
[1:26:18] people they are good people and they and
[1:26:21] uh you know
[1:26:22] but just struggling just like any
[1:26:24] anybody else but you know they sat in a
[1:26:27] church they go to church every day and
[1:26:28] they hear the pastor they still have
[1:26:30] questions they still have things going
[1:26:31] on in their lives but getting God in his
[1:26:34] grace and mercy comes and sends somebody
[1:26:35] from so far away and and it's like I was
[1:26:38] sitting in their living room talking to
[1:26:40] them and or listening to them talk and
[1:26:43] you know the the husband
[1:26:45] he called me up uh not too long after
[1:26:48] and he said you know I'd like to talk to
[1:26:50] you and he's a he's a minister himself
[1:26:52] and um what I tell you I always get just
[1:26:56] a little uncomfortable when I and I
[1:26:58] don't go off of notes so you just bear
[1:26:59] with me
[1:27:01] um
[1:27:03] it's it's 11 it's 11 30.
[1:27:06] I don't even know what time I started am
[1:27:08] I okay I have no idea uh I'll try to try
[1:27:12] to wrap up here if I'm going along I
[1:27:14] apologize but I the the brother called
[1:27:17] me up and he and he said uh he said uh
[1:27:20] you know uh
[1:27:22] I I I know a minister he left the
[1:27:26] message and he he walked away and so I
[1:27:29] started I contacted him and you know I
[1:27:31] thought I would encourage him but then
[1:27:33] uh you know I walked away and now I have
[1:27:35] all these questions
[1:27:36] and uh and uh he's like you know I just
[1:27:40] want to talk to you about it
[1:27:41] and uh
[1:27:43] and uh I'm I'm believe it or not even
[1:27:46] though I I'm up here doing all this
[1:27:49] talking I'm not much of a talker
[1:27:51] I I have to force myself to talk
[1:27:54] and to be to be uh to be PL um not
[1:27:57] pleasant but be friendly and show myself
[1:27:59] friendly
[1:28:02] I I'm much more comfortable
[1:28:05] I take to heart that that saying you
[1:28:08] know it's like
[1:28:09] um uh that that people uh you can be a
[1:28:14] fool and keep your mouth shut you know
[1:28:15] but the minute you open your mouth and
[1:28:17] people will know you
[1:28:19] so I I just tend to keep my mouth shut
[1:28:21] people usually you know well brother
[1:28:23] John you know he's he's pretty Sage or
[1:28:25] something I don't know at least that's
[1:28:26] my hope but uh rather than open my mouth
[1:28:30] and remove all doubt that John doesn't
[1:28:32] know what he's doing
[1:28:34] um but he so he he called and he wanted
[1:28:36] to talk to me about this stuff and and
[1:28:37] normally I would just sit and listen and
[1:28:39] yeah yeah and you know maybe say a word
[1:28:41] here or two here but I kind of just took
[1:28:44] over the conversation because there
[1:28:46] there are some things that I just will
[1:28:48] not deal with I'm just not going to go
[1:28:49] there it's not edifying you know I felt
[1:28:52] bad because I you know it's like brother
[1:28:54] look you know um
[1:28:55] uh you know I know that you kind of you
[1:28:58] wanted to call and you wanted to tell me
[1:29:00] these things and you were kind of hoping
[1:29:01] that I had the answer I I said but I'm
[1:29:04] not I'm not really interested in hearing
[1:29:06] any of it it doesn't matter to me it
[1:29:08] doesn't matter to me one bit and and um
[1:29:10] you know I'm not trying to be uh
[1:29:12] unspiritual I'm not trying to be uh
[1:29:15] unfriendly or unbrotherly you know but
[1:29:18] if you want to call and talk about and
[1:29:20] debate idiosyncrasies within the message
[1:29:23] or you want to debate why brother
[1:29:24] Branham said this and here or there and
[1:29:27] and this and you know research I'm not
[1:29:29] interested in not one bit I don't care
[1:29:31] it doesn't matter to me none of it
[1:29:33] changes Malachi 456 none of changes Luke
[1:29:37] 17 not nothing is changed by any of this
[1:29:40] debate all that stuff is is to me is is
[1:29:43] Spirits working all it is is to me is
[1:29:45] people who have who have become offended
[1:29:48] in me that's all it is and there's no
[1:29:51] there's no profit in it there's no
[1:29:53] reason for it I remember you know why a
[1:29:55] long time ago a pastor he told me you
[1:29:57] know like he said you know you need to
[1:30:00] come and look at this stuff and you need
[1:30:01] to have an answer for it honestly no I
[1:30:03] don't I absolutely do not I don't care
[1:30:05] about it not one bit I made up my mind
[1:30:07] about this stuff a long time ago and it
[1:30:08] doesn't matter to me listen because if
[1:30:10] you take a reasoning and you start
[1:30:12] applying it to the message
[1:30:14] to to a man what are you going to do
[1:30:17] with that same reason you can't you take
[1:30:19] that same reasoning and you just work it
[1:30:21] backwards and apply it to the to the New
[1:30:22] Testament and if you apply logic and
[1:30:25] reasoning to the New Testament and you
[1:30:27] know enough about the Old Testament you
[1:30:29] would understand why the Jews didn't
[1:30:31] accept Jesus as Messiah you would
[1:30:33] understand why because they thought
[1:30:34] Jesus would come and be some sort of a
[1:30:36] military leader and throw off the Yoke
[1:30:38] of Oppression but Jesus said that's not
[1:30:40] the kingdom I'm coming to establish but
[1:30:42] you work the reason you can see it you
[1:30:43] will keep working logic and reason the
[1:30:45] next thing you know you're back in the
[1:30:46] Old Testament living under the law and
[1:30:49] and then you can even say well you don't
[1:30:51] even know is there really a god because
[1:30:52] if there is a God you know
[1:30:54] this this and this it's like it it
[1:30:56] doesn't end anywhere but destroying
[1:30:59] faith in what God has done
[1:31:01] and so you know I told her brother I was
[1:31:03] like listen you know uh
[1:31:05] I love you and I'll pray for you and
[1:31:07] everything but I don't want I don't want
[1:31:08] to hear about it I don't want to I don't
[1:31:09] want to know what people are saying I
[1:31:11] don't know what research you've dug up I
[1:31:13] don't want to know I it doesn't matter
[1:31:15] to me if this Cloud was this or that or
[1:31:17] or if blue monkeys flew off the moon I
[1:31:20] don't care it doesn't matter to me one
[1:31:22] bit because I believe what the prophet
[1:31:25] said I believe that they're the godhead
[1:31:27] I believe water baptism I believe I
[1:31:31] don't understand it all but I believe
[1:31:32] the seals you know it's just that is my
[1:31:35] reality because some of us are going to
[1:31:37] look at the word of God one way and
[1:31:40] we're going to see truth because of
[1:31:42] what's in our hearts and some people are
[1:31:44] going to look at what brother Branham
[1:31:46] said or look at this Bible and they're
[1:31:48] going to look at it with different views
[1:31:49] and have a different reality about it
[1:31:51] and to them it's going to be a history
[1:31:52] or it's going to be a man or it's going
[1:31:54] to be a liar this is a liar that's a
[1:31:55] liar that's a mistake or this is a
[1:31:57] misinterpretation but I'm telling you
[1:31:59] that there is a people that's going to
[1:32:01] look at what God has done in this day
[1:32:02] and look at it and say that is the truth
[1:32:05] and and that's what we're resting on
[1:32:07] amen there's some people that are going
[1:32:09] to overcome in this last day and I
[1:32:11] believe by the grace of God that we're
[1:32:13] going to be there together I believe
[1:32:14] that we're going to be the ones who
[1:32:16] overcome and so I encourage you this
[1:32:18] morning no matter where you are and
[1:32:19] you're walking in your life but that
[1:32:22] that that
[1:32:24] look friends we're at the end
[1:32:26] we're at the end
[1:32:27] we're so close now that to the end of
[1:32:30] the race don't lose heart now this this
[1:32:33] is the time to buckle down
[1:32:36] buckle down and do everything that it
[1:32:39] takes lay aside every week lay aside
[1:32:41] every sin that does beset and get it out
[1:32:44] of your lives become the the the the
[1:32:46] person the human being the man the woman
[1:32:49] the husband the father that God has
[1:32:51] designed you to be the the become what
[1:32:54] his holy ghost has has designed for you
[1:32:57] to be he had a plan a vision of you from
[1:33:00] the foundation of the world of who you
[1:33:02] would be and and that is who we need to
[1:33:05] become and it doesn't matter if we get
[1:33:07] you think about it that God took a
[1:33:10] picture of us when we were you know at
[1:33:12] our our physical best right but that's
[1:33:15] we're not going back to a time where we
[1:33:17] just looked our physical best when we're
[1:33:19] taking all that we've learned all of our
[1:33:21] experiences and who we are that's what
[1:33:23] we're going back to in that type of a
[1:33:24] body and I say Lord help me I I was
[1:33:27] telling my wife and I guess I'll just
[1:33:29] close with this I'm 44 years old and
[1:33:33] in my life I've experienced an awful lot
[1:33:36] now I
[1:33:38] I sometimes think about it and I I think
[1:33:41] you know if if I was to write a book
[1:33:43] about the things that I've experienced
[1:33:45] in my life most people would think is
[1:33:47] fiction and I I don't mean because like
[1:33:49] uh just the things that I've done the
[1:33:52] things that I've I've I've I've been
[1:33:55] through like it's just it's a lot most
[1:33:58] people would think that it was a lie
[1:34:01] and I I told my wife I turned 44 this
[1:34:05] year and I said I think I'm having a
[1:34:08] midlife crisis
[1:34:10] now most people they have a midlife
[1:34:12] crisis
[1:34:13] for a man they go out and they they buy
[1:34:16] a new truck or a sports car you know and
[1:34:19] they
[1:34:19] uh
[1:34:21] I said my my midlife crisis is
[1:34:25] I have got to be better
[1:34:27] than what I am now I've got to be a
[1:34:30] better husband I've got to be a better
[1:34:31] father if if I'm going to do anything
[1:34:33] for God I've got to get moving I've got
[1:34:37] to do more for him and that that's
[1:34:39] that's what is driving me every day is
[1:34:43] that the Holy Ghost will work through my
[1:34:45] life in such a way that my family sees
[1:34:48] Jesus Christ that my children see Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ that the people I work with see
[1:34:52] Jesus Christ and and that the life of
[1:34:55] God lives through me to such a degree
[1:34:57] that I'm a burning light for all to see
[1:34:59] amen and that should be all all our
[1:35:02] prayer all our hope all our desire that
[1:35:04] we would testify of his goodness of his
[1:35:06] glory and and let our reality be what
[1:35:10] his reality says let his Rea let it let

[1:35:20] of my notes but but take take the words
[1:35:23] that I say to you think about them
[1:35:26] and let God change your lives I pray
[1:35:28] amen let's bow our heads

[1:37:19] I did so many thoughts when brother John

[1:37:23] our Prophet said when uh Pharaoh looked
[1:37:25] out the window
[1:37:26] he seen Mud Dog slaves
[1:37:29] but when Moses looked out the window
[1:37:31] seen the child of God predestinated
[1:37:33] children of God Amen you know I was also
[1:37:36] you know uh just it was it was so
[1:37:39] beautiful brother John you know I was
[1:37:42] thinking when he was preaching of the
[1:37:43] cloud that we have on the front of our
[1:37:45] pulpit you know when the cloud came down
[1:37:48] on the day of the prophet some people
[1:37:50] just seen jet fluid
[1:37:52] some people seen water moisture
[1:37:55] our prophet
[1:37:57] seen angels
[1:37:59] our prophets seen angels
[1:38:01] and the angel came to the angel
[1:38:06] and said turn it sideways
[1:38:08] and there's head chip
[1:38:11] and I was reading the quote this week I
[1:38:13] haven't set aside because I thought I
[1:38:14] actually might Minister on it
[1:38:16] and all the people around the prophet
[1:38:18] told him he said why don't you take this
[1:38:21] to the Press
[1:38:25] and the same angel that taught him to
[1:38:27] turn the picture sideways
[1:38:29] said take this to the Tabernacle
[1:38:32] it's not for them
[1:38:37] exact same angel
[1:38:39] he was planning on taking it to the
[1:38:42] paper
[1:38:42] and he said
[1:38:44] they won't see it see you can look at
[1:38:46] the exact same thing
[1:38:50] and they seemed jet through us they seen
[1:38:52] jet fluid or they've seen water moisture
[1:38:56] but the angel
[1:38:58] when they turned it sideways
[1:39:01] seen Christ
[1:39:02] seeing Christ Jesus amen
[1:39:06] Hallelujah amen when we can just look
[1:39:09] past the badger skin what do you see
[1:39:11] amen I I pray this morning I I know I
[1:39:14] did this morning and the Word was coming
[1:39:16] forth
[1:39:17] that we see Christ we see Christ in each
[1:39:20] other we don't have to see each other's
[1:39:22] shortcomings we can see Christ

[1:39:27] and sing a song dismissal amen thank you

[1:39:41] day and you just think of the concert
[1:39:43] the the the the discussions over the
[1:39:47] cloud
[1:39:49] to me it was nothing short of Christ
[1:39:51] himself
[1:39:52] coming down
[1:39:54] in our day
[1:39:56] manifesting a revealed word
[1:39:59] and all the Mysteries and the seals
