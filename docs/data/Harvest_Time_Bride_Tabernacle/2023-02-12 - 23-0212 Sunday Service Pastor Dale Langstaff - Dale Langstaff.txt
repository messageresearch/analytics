sick and and uh but his uh so he didn't sleep he called me he hadn't slept Thursday night and he called me Friday I guess it was so and he said that if he got up Saturday and felt better they would

and a lot of rules anything that you're in that's part of the government you really sell out your body amen I would never ever do it I would never recommend anybody do it amen amen thank you Lord we also want to thank yous all for the so many that have gift so much to uh to Africa to us going men men have give a huge amen and God bless you amen you'll certainly have your reward amen the Bible says lay up your Treasures where moth and Russell don't corrupt the thieves don't break through and see all right our Prophet clearly told us that the lady that God had laid on her heart to clean out a stall and have a Revival that she would get credit for every single soul the one million so that the minister Dwight Moody the little bully it would it would fall on her shoulders amen so amen it'll be quite a day when you get there you have people walked up to you that you've never seen before but they've seen you through your gift and you've changed their life to eternal life literally amen just for your scriptures we're going to show a few pictures just and then you will read our scripture you can have your seats and then just sorry um so I just I just some of you have seen this and some you have not but uh it's important for you to be part of all things in humanity there's just three or four pictures of the church and and uh of course Luanne Will Be steady taking videos when we're there and pictures and then just full-time amen and we'll show you what God has done amen maybe we'll maybe we'll read our scripture and then the Believers can have their seats Amy let's turn to Genesis 1 27 and you can work on that Genesis 1 27 and uh I preached this many many years ago and I had this message laying out for well weeks literally probably two weeks at least maybe three I'd taken it out I was going to take it to Uganda with me and and uh and I seen uh and I I did I actually brought two messages this morning I brought my my message I'll Minister when I come back home I have a thought in there where God gave me on and I do have another title but it's a kitchen table and you will be amazed at the things in the Bible that are preached or supposed to be preached or ministered for the benefit of Christ from the kitchen table it will blow your mind I'll never do it in one sermon and some of the scriptures are so profound that it it would be that if you missed out on doing it it would blaspheme the body of Christ that's how some of the scriptures I wrote it's just it's just unbelievable just I mean it's really really really powerful but I just felt really the tug to come this way also also just maybe I'm sorry to keep you standing but uh also really remember uh uh Steve and Kathy Kathy was the lady that came in later yesterday um last Sunday and she fully planned on being here and she apologized profusely for being late see she takes care of a husband that's completely totally handicapped by no fault of his own he was abused he was beaten to death left for dead and so she couldn't leave until the person arrived to take care of her amen she's apologized to me amen but she is very she just really needs our prayers and she's very full she's just ready to explode you know she's been taking care of her husband for 12 years and and uh just she just she asked us things like that she said would God give me permission to go visit my daughter out west which I have never went to visit and she's living with the guilt that something could happen with her husband when she's gone now it's her own daughter she's never ever went to see her since the accident amen so I mean we we didn't get there this week and I don't know if we'll get there before our plane goes up but if it doesn't Jared somebody could go by and see him or whatever it's it's uh they're they're wonderful people it's just she just pray that God will just open their eyes to himself and just just pour in his grace and love it just be amazing amen man sorry just take so this is the outside of the church kind of the front it's it's looking very nice and uh we I mean we praise God for all this this is the inside is this a video okay this is the inside um it will be very big amen um that day that shows you the size from the outside but uh um I want to see the video there's a couple more pictures two or three Insight inside pictures there we go um no no there's wrong video that's Junior's house man God bless you brother Fred it's all right it's a it was a jigsaw puzzle back there it's up higher man this was all a miracle of God Amen and just uh Maybe no one man it was up above the pictures the video was first the video is right under the picture of the three uh prophets or three Healing Ministry people there we go there we go so if you look close you can see the railing through the top we actually had just sent money for that so the balcony comes halfway up one side all the way across the back and fully up the other side now the old church sit completely inside this inside the balcony even and of course it was one story they're welding actually doing the welding and some of the things will be happening right before we left amen this that just shows you it's very that's just God Amen that's America that's not just one person that's many people then like many many of you here have done it but even other churches brother Jose is give to that and different people but hey man let's just uh thank you Vicky amen let's just go to Genesis 1 27. we'll read our scripture and we're gonna uh mineral Minister on something I was really praying sister Kathy would be here just believe this would bless everybody amen but well God knows all things amen Genesis 1 27. so God created Men In His Image his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them verse 28 and God blessed them in Romans 2 8 and 28. Romans 8 and 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to his his purpose amen you may have your seats Lord Jesus we ask you to come and just bless your word and may your may your your will be done and we pray and this service will give you the glory for it amen never before in history have we lived in a world where people want to be somebody else never before never before ever has it been where people are imitating movie stars which is just unbelievable amen or they want to look different or be different or amen and it's because of the the uh the world of science that we live in that sin has come up and people have desired to be something that God never intended you to be I'm going to read you some quotes this morning from our Prophet but you know you if you are unhappy you know how I said that we would be happy in our prayer happy where God placed us happy to be exactly who you are happy for me to not be fat amen you see or however you are shorter tall our Prophet said that God made you exactly how he wanted you and see if you pictured God and and we know just to help you in this we know that God's a spirit okay but we talk about God as being a body so we'd have to think of him as a spirit body but for us to get the picture in our mind let's think of an actual body and so when you came this morning if you are going to go back to God you came from God or you ain't never going to God because the definition on Google and the dictionary is to be Eternal you always were so you're not coming to the altar with the great evangelist and getting saved and then going to heaven if you came from hell that ain't never happened amen so you came from this body that's a spirit this body you can't see my toes but and everybody that's part of the Bride is a part one part of that body and God himself is uncomplete if you're not that's why the the the the the the in the fullness of time that's a saint without us or not make complete until we're all back in the spirit body called Jehovah and so you this morning you are excited exactly you are not I realize you got a thee off any body and all that but just even in your personality and character you are exactly who you are but you came from God and you don't like it and you don't like it and you don't like it now if you could comprehend and get in the mind of God just try to think where God's working that out God sent you here is a little toe or the heel that's what I think that's what I know I'm an eel most days for the year or the low or whatever and then no and you say God I want to facelift I don't want to be who I am I don't I don't want to be I don't want to be a minister I don't want to be I don't want to be a father I don't want to be a mother I don't want to be I don't even want to be wow for his purpose for his purpose now the purpose of you being here today had nothing to do with you it had everything to do with Jehovah and his plan that he would prove to Satan that the second Eve would never fall and the reason she wouldn't well he okay we would fall and he would redeem us but the reason we would never fall in the end is because he put himself called predestination seed into us amen and so until the sun hit that seed or until we recognize her until somebody poured water on it or until somebody kicked the dirt and it wasn't quite as deep or the warm War weather hit it amen and you just thought you were here to make a big bank account care less about your bank account unless you surrender it to him then he's can use it for its Glory amen this is huge maybe just a maybe just delay a foundation here let's just read a quote and the repo reproach for the word of God in 62. now let's just see what the prophet said he said every man that comes to Christ must be trial change proud child trained sorry for a purpose that that God has ordained amen you can't change you can't it's it's um you can try but you're going to look like a fool you cannot change who you are because God won't allow you to he's going to show it and remember if you can just keep quiet now remember if he called you for this there's nothing there's nothing that can keep it from happening period there's not enough devils in torment but what God's word will be manifested because his word was his thoughts and he wrote them in creation amen and but God's word will be manifested and you were born you were born for a purpose and the purpose has very little almost nothing to do with yourself but this is a self-society it has everything to do with Christ and the body that's why the scripture says when one cry we all cry when one rejoices we all rejoice when one's happy we're all happy amen because you you're a body and so you feel the pain when I had if you know which I don't have and I because God's healed me but when I hit an earache my body hurt but if my body wasn't my ear if you don't think so just hold your finger out and I'll take a hammer and I'll just drive it and I'll turn the Nail Blue like my dad used to get a lot and then the nail would kind of fall off and see if that don't hurt down your arm and up your back that's why you got to be careful how you treat the body of Christ that's why parent you got to be careful how you treat your family because they're not yours they were Gods before they were yours he just trusted you enough to borrow them to you amen God help me preaching to myself and nobody you know I'm reading this exactly what our Prophet said and nobody you get that and nobody can take your place there's not a single person in the world to take your place and you might have impersonators and everything else and they will never they will never take your place right God's word will Triumph it can't fail and there's where every Christian ought to stand knowing that the truth will come up and seem every way to you but remember he goes right back to it but remember God has a purpose and he knows it'll all work out all right wow I don't mean it's going to be easy some of you Scott hard roads that you're plowing amen God God but and and you know what I can't explain it some of you have had will have hard lives or trials or something's coming or and you cannot just you can't explain it other than say God as a plan and he seen a film and in this film it always ends good don't matter how the middle is it always sounds good I was thinking when the kids were singing up here and I could see Brett I said God he'll be there no matter what no matter what I I won't take no I won't I will not accept no it's not possible it's not possible amen the Ecclesia eye sticks I believe I'm saying that right three one Amy let's pull this up and I'm going to take my time because because if I just don't finish this we'll just finish it there you know also I just this comes to me and I I'm sorry it just was I was supposed to say something to this you know Satan tries to hinder it fits in God's purpose you know we were taking meat down to brother Emmanuel and Madam in Woodstock Friday and you know we're just cruising down the 401 and my what's up starts ringing and it was brother Ben NORAD amen no we're gonna we're gonna get on a big chat pretty soon today brother Ben said I I Luanne answered it and she said he said my Visa just got denied for Uganda now I know for a fact that brother Leo has five sermons five messages booked for Saturday for Saturday can you imagine and I just said to brother Ben you just made me have a heart attack because I understand what that'll mean see God and literally 20 minutes later see if we get in the place where something happens we're we're literally believing that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and and that way so like if I don't come back one of your brothers are going to take this church and you're just gonna or or if one of your kids God forbid or something see because it's God believe me we we don't want that I want to come back but it's God 20 minutes later the phone rings again and it was John Gary I said we must be doing something right brother Matt because Satan's losing his mind he said you know I'm about to die and brother Dale I can't believe I'm turning you down this close to Sunday but he said it's a it's physically impossible for me to come on I joke with the way I said well I said the next phone call is going to be the plane crashed or something I mean I don't know I'm okay with that see but but but but what do we say but not even Satan can hinder God's plan see God already knows who will be there and he already knows who will have some kind of a see see the Bible says that one plants one Waters and God gives the increase but he knows the personalities and the clicks and and the atmosphere and the and he knows who's got to be fed to be saved for eternal life and he knows like even though we pre-planned he might just switch those plans and say I gotta have I gotta have somebody else behind the wheel at that time because there's going to be somebody coming from and we say but I don't want to be that person and God's like oh I got to deal with that again and everything there is a season and a Time I don't think you've seen it for every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die time to plant the time to pluck up that which has been planted time to kill and the time to heal and the time to break down the time to time to build up and the time to weep and the time to laugh and a time to mourn the time to dance the time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together the time to embrace the time from to refrain from embracing a time to keep and a time to Cast Away the time to render and a time to sow the time to speak in a Time To Love the time to hate and the time to have peace but he got has made everything including you and your situation to God your trial for you beautiful the pride of life that bring us character and form us into the Final Destination that we'll be and that's the only thing that's going in our glorified body whoa Isaiah 46 9 10 and 11. remember the former things of old that I am God and there ain't none else I'm God I I don't think the people that believe in the Trinity read this scripture I mean maybe you should fast forward it to them and there's none like me verse 10 declaring the end from the beginning and from the Ancients of times and the things not yet done saying my counsel self my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure calling oh man my wife's not here to help me calling arabious birds from the East and a man that exalted my counsel from a far country and you thought I was just going to Uganda for a holiday yay I have spoken it I will bring it to pass there we go again for I have purposed it I also will do it wow wow Pilate in John 18 30 pilate said to Jesus he said our doubt then the king of the Jews and Jesus here's Jehovah God we know this is Jehovah God here saying he said thou saith I am the king and to this end was I born to this end you were born and it wasn't regarding careers or jobs although you do need to have an income but it was regarding the kingdom of God to this end you were born to complete the plan of the kingdom of God oh it's beautiful Hallelujah to this end I was born and for this cause put this put brother down and for this cause brother Dale came into the world wow and you thought your mommy just wanted to have another boy now actually I was definitely supposed to be a girl because I was the seventh of seven boys in a row I mean that's what you call striking out a few times by God never before I do I womb when you were in the womb that I know you knew me and in the womb he said I can't have a girl because he won't preach that's that's I mean whoo and for this cause for this very cost for you brothers and sisters that gave hundreds gave a few dollars give hundreds of dollars some in this church give in the thousands with an s to go to God for this very cause were you born wow you know one of the brothers that's coming to minister When I'm Gone I was brother Tim has signed Authority on the church and I said now brother Tim will give you a love gift and he said brother Dale he said I don't want a person I don't he said I won't take nothing he said but the money that you would give me take with you he said I want you to give half of it for feeding the people and he said I want you to give the other half to a widow in dire need I told the brother I said for sure I'll do that for sure I'll do that but I said would you let me get a picture by the whittle I'll send it to you said brother Dale for this cost for this very cost were you born you thought it was defeat cast boys no no nothing to do with speed and cast for this very cause came you into this world oh that I should bear a witness of the truth now oh God's word in the light of this message is just Supernatural what I mean it is president you know I never ever heard tell in my life of predestination so this truth that we call the message you know we had probably went to 50 different churches honey 25 30 40 or 50. because we were just looking for what we knew there was we were looking for God and we weren't finding them until we arrived I can still remember the first time I went to Wallaceburg I can remember us driving home I can remember some of the things they said well you know in a way that you know they still do have connections to other churches I can remember thinking wow what took us so long everything was just wow the song service was wow the message was wow I can remember who preached and what he preached you preached he preached the whole He preached from Genesis to Revelations it was Donnie written uh Lonnie Jenkins he preached shotgun I was trying to keep up through him in the Bible and I was just blown away because he preached the whole Bible in one day and I was like are you well it took us so long God straw on a spike watch how Jesus is talking to Pilate and he drops in he just drops a race he just drops her in brother Matt predestination a lot I just lost my mind when I was studying this yesterday I was printing this out yesterday here here's let's let's can I start at the beginning again and here's pilate said you know Jesus are you king of the Jews and Jesus answered and said you know thou saith that I am the king and for this end I was born and for this cause that came into the world he's talking just like this the pilate that I should bear witness of the truth and then this is where he drops in predestination and all the smart people went right over their head or their ears were all plugged everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice everyone that's predestinated will hear my voice and everybody else looked at us and said I didn't hear nothing I didn't hear nothing everyone Jesus saying everyone pilate everyone that's predestimated to eternal life well hear my voice it was like I didn't hear nothing special whoa everyone that God before the foundation of the world seen sitting here we're going to hear Christ Jesus voice oh that's beautiful Hallelujah see how Jesus just slips in predestination said I thank you Father that I said that in such a way that the wise and The Prudent they didn't catch it wow here in 50 in the face in action here's here's our Prophet saying here's a quote he said how can you Moses here's Moses one man lead two million people to the promised land how can you do it because God said so Perry amen When God says so and he the Moses was Vindicated by the angel came down and talked with him and told him that he was barred for a purpose and here here our Prophet is making it into a story he said and Moses put his faith into action and that's what it takes no matter how much Faith you got if it if it won't be used it it won't do you no good if you don't use it that's right he said what good is what good I love this part he said what good is the god of Moses if he ain't the same God today we know he is here brother Brown said many times multiple times if you study this message which which I do amen multiple times the prophet said born for a purpose there was different for our purpose I was born for ways he talked about it and he Moses and Elias and in himself and in you the one quota I already read amen Psalms 33 11 Psalms 33 11 the Council of the Lord standeth forever and the thoughts that's his purpose in the new IV version it's purpose and his purpose of his heart to all Generations amen here in Proverbs 19 21 and I wrote down both so I'm and so you can put up the King James but I have the King James here but I want to read the new IV version because it's got different words in it man and this is the new IB in Proverbs 19 21 many other plans in the mind of a man but it is the purpose it's the purpose of the Lord that'll stand it's the purpose now and the King James said many are the devices in the heart of a man nevertheless the council so they got counsel instead of purpose but the counsel and the purpose of the Lord is going to set God chose you where to plant you God chose you to be born here or move you here or place you here or give you your house or you think see everything you thought you decided but it really wasn't that God met your needs you thought it was because you worked huh wow God help us God help us man many many people here we could look at and we're going to look at a few and and uh of the purpose of God you know the prophet said even King Isaiah which I love preaching about King Isaiah and the prophet that was in his time amen the prophet Isaiah was in the time of King Isaiah and King Uzziah thought he was above the purpose of God he wanted to be somebody he wasn't and he pushed it you know what I'm saying God give them a king and give him millions of dollars and he said but I want to be a priest I want to be a levite and he went to the house of God and the Levites said you know King bless King you're a wonderful King but but King the king you're not supposed to be here and he defiled the temple of God and did the sacrifices because he wouldn't listen to the man that God had put in place God struck him with Leprosy and he died he died with leprosy and all he had to do was listen to One Man or even before he would listen to that man not stepped out of what's God's ordained purpose was for his life now see this watch this see sometimes we're it's possible you could not be sure and see if you weren't sure and you stepped over here somebody else's position God will be Duty bound to bring you to somebody and say hey I think you just stepped out of your and you could just step right back in line and everything be beautiful but that's not what king Isaiah did wow man during the influence 63 I'd like to read a quote here he said don't never try to take other people's places now I'm reading exactly it's on my iPad I found it once I got here he he said he he he our Prophet said God Made You 92 times God don't make no mistakes so if you don't like me I understand because there's things about me I don't like to but just maybe it's up to you you can decide but just maybe if I was part of God and you don't like me you're walking on Dangerous Ground I I I would be really careful because it now if I'm not from God then you're okay you decide but if if somebody just happens to have come from God and and you just happen to attack that person ouch I just say ouch I'd hate to see what you look like when God gets done with it and that God made you a certain thing and you stay that way certainly you say just what you are don't try to impersonate another that's always ruins I like this the gifts see you you are a gift your gift to God and if you try to be somebody you'll ruin the gift that God placed in your life and that's what always ruins the gifts that God sent to the world see because God's seen you as a beautiful Rose but you want it to be a carnation that God didn't want you to be a carnation he wants you to be a rose with Pickers on it for the heel like I am Maybe you say just what you are and don't try to impersonate the other and that's what always ruins the gifts that God sends to the world you find many uh carnal impersonations and we find sometimes that people try to copy after the other now watch this he's talking about a lady Minister he said there was a lady Minister Miss McPherson that was living and every woman Minister wore the wings like she did or whatever else she did or they would hold the Bible the same way that this lady Minister Miss McPherson hold the body you know I've seen people that try to sing and they hold the mic just like like some person in Hollywood that's singing to Lucifer like just perfectly and I'm vomiting in my pew it don't happen here but I mean if you travel sometimes you could see other spirits that anoint me what's wrong with just being and everything they everything that she did they did now we notice that that's and we notice got so many bibles Billy Graham's today sorry but you see God only made one Billy Graham you're thinking thank God he only made one brother death but that's all he did amen but you see God never made here but we're just and but you're just as important as Billy Graham Oral Roberts or any of those other famous men you're just as important until you get out of your place and then you're no good at all see you're hindering you you're a hindrance watches you're a hindrance to those men and you're a hindrance to the kingdom of God wow stay in your position see stay with what God made you see and then you will operate all right I want to tell you so I want to throw something in here I just caught something many of our positions change yep they change if God takes brother Dale off the scene he will raise up one of you Brothers here to take this spot and if you don't feel like that it'll be destroyed because our Prophet said it's the very best one from among you know look on a sister a sister the Bible says you say I don't think their position changed the Bible says for The Elder sisters to teach the younger sisters so see when you go from a younger sister now you become a grandma sister your position changed but I also talks about teaching the young men too don't misunderpret the script I'll deal with that one when I preach the kitchen table amen and when we get them out of place we blaspheme God how you train a child it's not just in the bible stories which they're the very best but God expects you know how to eat what's placed before you know because when you go to Uganda they might only serve you turn up because that'll be one of the things there and so now I didn't gag the kid with it I don't know why I'm preaching this I'm not supposed to be preaching this but my mom would always put just a little bit just a little bit one little bite because she was always going to want to be embarrassed when she took in her eight little ducklings into a stranger's place and the only thing they served was turnip and can you imagine those eight little ducklings saying we don't eat there enough she didn't want to cross that bridge so she worked on the bridge before she got to it or like teach the kids not to foreign with your mouth open because you might make the other person get sick and that would cause health issues in the body and then they'd have to come get healed see and that's all in the Bible I give you I'll give you scriptures for those kind of things man see God has a you know the Bible says I got to get off this message the Bible said that all scriptures were given for instruction Doctrine edification blessings and on and on and on and we're not preaching on that amen stay in your position and you'll operate all right now carrying on the same one just dropping down you see dropping down to paragraph 63 and we mustn't try to impersonate anyone just be what you are see that's the way God made you this is this is the same quote just farther down and you never you're never fashioned yourself you didn't get to choose whether you were tall or short by the Bible says by thought who could add one cubit to your stature just strive Satan came up with high heels but that was the devil see see how and remember that much of we ministers Billy Graham's place we can't do it he said but neither can Billy Graham take your place see we each one has something to do a common little fellow here that may just be the janitor or the little woman that may be a housewife a great Minister on the face of the Earth today could not thank your place that's word for word by the way you you God made a purpose in making you that you are and you just serve God purpose and the way that he made you amen I know I'm killing this one but we're living in a world the people want blue hair when they got white hair and then want green eyes when God didn't give them green eyes a long eyelashes when God give you short out he listens and it's Satan Messing with predestinated people that are out of Fellowship our Prophet said if you're backslidden you're out of Fellowship with God and he's messing with you trying to get to God through you amen well then instead of doing that too many times we are like the king Uzziah he felt like he would be was too big to be called down see and King and he was the king and many times we see I see in ministers this way that they felt that they were just too important to be told the word of Truth wow amen thank you Lord amen and the reason that this is a different the reason that you do that is because you're they're not conscience God Is Watching here let's go up see he said stay with what you are what God made you oh how could we say he said the reason you don't do that is you're not conscious God Is Watching and you lose the very thought of God in the being there listening to you God put everything down that you're thinking about and he knows it in his recorder books and your very thoughts in heaven are louder than your voice on Earth and he's talking about you not being satisfied with what God made with what God made amen we know Moses in the Bible we mentioned it was a proper child and and was was made for purpose amen nobody could take his place the angel told him that amen let's just look at a few other examples in the Bible of people that were born for a purpose and asked her 4 14. and here here Esther is is her her uncle Mordecai is trying to encourage her to go to the king but I want to just I'm going to just for time just drop to the end of the verse the bottom part of the verse and here Mordecai's telling Esther and says and who is to know whether Thou Art come into the kingdom for this very purpose for such a Time it's just this this was all set up for such a Time is this right here just one thing maybe the purpose in Esther's life was just one purpose go to the king and once she was done she'd be in the background all what would John say in the Bible he said I must decrease so he can hear God's purpose wow wow we know here pilate and Pharaoh both were born to damn Nation here here Pharaoh said he here God said with Pharaoh he said that he's telling Moses what he's going to do but he said I've raised pharaoh and I've hardened his heart why did God do that God only did that to prove to the people of Israel and a world that he was Jehovah that he was Jehovah amen and that's exactly exactly on the other side of this the Spectrum the line what he's doing with you see he's got some raised up for damnation that he's going to harden their hearts to prove that God's still God but he's got some raised up for eternal life that are going to say I surrender and the devil is going to say I don't understand it amen wow God help us here we look at the scripture I'm trying to find it but I'll just do it from memory if I don't but Rahab in the wall prostitute amen I wish I could find it here because I'd find a scripture I looked at it this morning yesterday or sometime but here here Joshua sends his spies out to check the city amen I I'm just not laying mine oh there we go Joshua two one to four and then eight to eleven and you know we need to all be led by the spirit of God can you comprehend Joshua intentionally send in his Deacons to a red light district amen God knows what he's doing and Joshua the son of none sent out the men two men to spy secretly saying go view the land of Jericho and they went and came to the harlot's house named Rahab why I just why it's a God God supernaturally he said nothing out for a mistake God's super not do you know Rahab became married the general and the Israelite Army hello hello remember that when Rahab walks in the church here don't be too quick she might Marry The General and they lieds there they didn't just go there they lodged there well they would lose their deaconship in this church see careful next verse and it was told the king and Jericho saying behold there's men came hithered tonight the children of Israel to search out the country and let's just jump to uh oh we can go to four sorry and then we'll jump and and the king of Jericho sent to rehab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which enter into thy house there come to search all the country and the men and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus and there came unto the Met came man unto me and she lied I don't understand that either but she lied to death to 11. and therefore they were laid down and she came up onto them on the roof I I have a place of going here and she said unto the man I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that the terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faintest because of Thee four now they were putting on a really good show they didn't they didn't outwardly show that for we have heard what the Lord has dried up the water of the Red Sea for you and when thou came out of Egypt and what ye did to the two kings of the amorites and that were on the other side of Jordan signing and on whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did they didn't get hardened they melted neither did there remain any more carriage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in the Earth amen Rahab born to protect spies and she had to have her house in the wall where she can get customers from outside the city and inside the city see you have to be amen Sin is Sin but God is still God man God help us God help us here let's go to Prophet Elisha here he told the Israel in Second Kings 6 and 12. and and the King they were the King was raising up to fight Israel and the King Elijah would tell the king where to go and where the Army was and how much and all that and the the Army King was convinced the Syrian King was convinced that he had a traitor in his army I want to tell you something this morning no matter what your trial or no matter how black your day is God knows what he's doing amen God knows exactly where the Army is he knows exactly how many men's in it he knows exactly what hill they're on and he knows exactly what you need to do to fight him and they lost all those Bibles all those Wars and there was a pagan Wicked unconverted anytime you don't think you're a testimony unconverted backslitting person in Syria you getting me not a believer hadn't been here to church had it never went to church didn't go to even Church on Easter and he went to the king of Syria he said okay there's a God in that country there's a God in that country that talks through some of those Prophets that will tell them the thoughts that you have in your bad chamber and he was a wicked pagan non-believing message believer God revealed that truth to that man to tell that King whoa amen born for a purpose don't try to look like Hollywood don't try to be Hollywood it will burn don't try to it'll burn and they know it'll burn you know we were somewhere last night with the kids most of our kids were there and I was showing one of our kids the video that John dank was sent me turkey you didn't see it though thank you and Brent was there was hugely obvious turkey head it's reported gonna be more Nest over 21 000 dead in a few minutes and 12 10 12-story buildings they just inflated just one beside the other beside the other and then after in the video they just put a picture driving down the road it was just driving slow like every single building every single building every single movie what's wrong they know they know that man in the Syrian Army he knew so is Brent no totally not God is God won't be mocked amen Hallelujah you're born for purpose perfectly in God's will amen stay there don't try to get out of it amen don't be like King Messiah amen hallelujah we're supposed to be a peculiar people you know Revelations 19 7 says his wife has made herself ready I was going to read a couple quotes here and close put some in spiritual experiences he said here here's the prophet talking about he was born I just I was I stuttered there earlier in my message I said he says it two different ways he says born for this purpose and born for I purpose he said both multiple for our purpose and this purpose but here our Prophet was talking about he said he was out crying he said I was down crying he said I was on the ground I I it's just it just made me vibrate when I read this so God oh man I I would just I mean I don't deserve it but what an experience amen and he said the prophet was praying and crying it was blackout and he said I've seen a flashlight come in the room and he said it was like a young Feller was pointing the flashlight on the floor and I thought I thought someone must be coming in and he said and there the light was on the room Lord and he said above it was the Hallow for the pillar of Fire and what I thought was a flashlight it's actually a Jehovah God shining on the floor moving along and he came in walking through there came the angel of God so not imagination he said he was there I looked right at him and talked to you oh wow he said I walked up and his arms folded out a baked man very fine looking look like looked like he would have spoken a world and it would have bursted and I said the angel said I'm reading this exactly he said I the her was close I said I been he said I've been sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you that you were born for this purpose maybe brother Dale's been born this whole life just to tell you this morning that you Believers here are born for this very purpose even maybe today to pray for the sick to go into parts of the world and that you will pray for monarchs marnox and great men and healings and so forth that will take place and these things will be and he said and you know the prophet of course he appealed he said I'm uneducated nobody will believe me and he said as the prophet Moses was given two signs to vindicate his mystery he will return his hand into leprosy and then healing it and the Stick of the snake and so forth he said so will I give you two signs and one of them will be you'll put your hand on a person and it'll tell them what's wrong with them and the other and it'll come to pass and as so as long as you are reverent he he let me finish that he says and don't think nothing on your own it'll be just given to you and then it'll come to pass it after such a long time that if you're referent if you're really reverent then it will be given to you to know the very secrets the very secrets of their hearts of the things that are wrong wow God saved me for this purpose and I'm determined to do his will amen and so will it be upon the bride and so will it be on the bride that we're unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it and look how many were lost and blind today when you were saved for this purpose you were born to do his will Hallelujah let's stand thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord you thought it was just some common day in your life Journey but just very possible just very very possible to God had huge plans for you God help us not to be like this little saying I'm going to read to you when we close a pastor visited some of his people and when he was there the pastor went to a couple's house and after he left the wife said to her husband she said I believe the pastor stole one of our spinners so of course the next year a pastor must not visit very often the next year the pastor couldn't do nothing for those people because the only time she's seen him all she thought of sister Patty was you stole my spell so one year later the pastor went to the exact same couple's house for dinner again and unable to resist the wife finally got up her courage and said that you stealed the spoon that we had the we were here the pastor replied no I put it in your Bible one year no God no devotions I put it in your Bible one year you have not because you don't recognize you ask not you don't recognize the presence of God in our midst you know if he is not the same as when he came into the prophet's room then he's not even God at all you see exactly the same you are born for this purpose kingdom of God to be glorified Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen God will prove to the world and prove to Satan and prove to all his demons can you imagine when you get up how the demons would tremble they say that bride they're waking up and I know the first thing they're going to do is get into that Bible they're going to get into studying the Mysteries and they're going to get into recognizing who I am and they're going to get into and it's going to identify me and it's going to uncover my sins just like the the major general in the Bible I'm going to preach on that in China or China and Uganda hidden sins where he had his leprosy and he hid it from the whole country because if it would have been revealed he would have been dethroned but it was just a little little servant girl I said I know there's a God back home and he can take care of your sin leprosy you won't have to hide it anymore you won't have to roll down your sleeves really long to cover up your leprosy your tattoos or or Engravings or here because this God he'll just take it all away amen amazing thank you Lord Jesus born for a purpose I pray and desire that I would be completely used for his purpose this whatever ain't part of his plan just curve me to your plan Lord Jesus and may you
