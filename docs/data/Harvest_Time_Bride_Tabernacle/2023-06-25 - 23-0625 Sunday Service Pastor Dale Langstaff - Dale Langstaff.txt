the greatest hope in the world and it's not a worldly hope it's an eternal hope man we're going to be traveling to later today to the states coming back tomorrow a lady sister that Luanne went to Youth Camp with a very young age exactly the same age as Luanne we're going to a funeral I couldn't imagine going to my wife's room I just couldn't even comprehend that man so like brother Matt said

sister Myra to fellowship with us and be part of us here in Wyoming and we love you and we welcome you amen and we are just on our journey to Glory amen and we're just you're very very welcome there keep them in your prayers they're actually believing and hoping to move this way and so they're looking for a miracle amen and we know a god of Miracles it's a piece of cake for him he's already seen it got it figured out and he won't be surprised like we'll be amen God help us amen God wants to preach this morning on eyes Are Spiritual eyes amen and we're going to go through the Bible if God will permit and there's it's just unbelievable the amount of examples in the word of God on eyesight and it's also unbelievable and amazing what our Prophet said about eyesight and all of our eyes all of our eyes need I said brother Dale stoop brother Dales does and I know yours too because I can tell by how we live amen it's a supernatural thing that you can see things that aren't seen I pray you know the prophet preached on looking unto Jesus and looking and looking to the Unseen but I want to preach and change his title and put seeing the Unseen let's stand as we read his word amen let's turn to First John 3 and 2. and uh just I pray this little this will help me a man maybe help you and I pray that you can help me preach because I got a lot of hey and also as we just come to me a story just remember next weekend we will not be here the church will have a big sign on it and some will be at the Ottawa camp at Silver Lake and some will be at Pastor John dank was for a youth retreat or some will be both amen I pray to see you at both places we're going to be at both places and so you have all the information and just pray for those meetings and to travel and not just be a different place but that God's will that it'll be Supernatural amen amen First John 3 and 2. beloved now ye are we are the sons of God and it has not yet appear what ye shall be but we know that when he shall appear that we shall be like him for we shall see him for we shall see him as he really is man Revelation 3 and 18. Revelations 3 and 18. and I counsel thee to buy a bego tried in the fire the thousands may be rich and white raiment and that those may be clothed and that thou shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isaf that those may see now he's talking about people that can see and the Lord Stone them you need I said that thou may see Lord Jesus we ask that you would bless your bride and bless us all Lord Jesus as we look into your word God help us help your speaker and help to hear to hear what the spirit says to us today in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning you know I want to read a quote right off the the start here here in the brother Brown's meanings there was a young person that came up to a young minister to come up to the prophet and he and he was uh mocking God he wasn't mocking the prophet he was mocking God and he said I'd like you to strike me blind he said I see in the scriptures where Paul struck a man blind and the prophet said to him he said brother he said I can't do what the devil's already done for you you're already blind and the brother said to him he said but I'm talking about physical blindness and brother Brown showed him the example in of uh Elisha and the Syrian Army where God struck him blind and then the prophet goes down to the end of this quote this is then the door to the heart and he said spiritual blindness is 10 million times worse 10 million times worse Than Physical blindness wow God help us God help us amen so many so many examples let's just look at some quick examples and then we're going to go into some longer ones here in the Bible but we see in May or Matthew 27 11 and I'm just going to blow through three examples in the Bible to kind of lay a foundation and then we're going to go into some longer ones and look at some quotes at the end Matthew 27 11 and here Jesus stood before the governor pilate and the governor asked him see pilate couldn't see he said Art Thou King of the Jews see he he couldn't see oh he could see but he couldn't see spiritually and Jesus said unto him thou sayest God help or I say God help our I say you know Abraham and in Genesis 18 1-3 here's Abraham sitting at the tent and three men angels we know their Angels but the Bible calls them men come and they're standing by and and the prophet talks about this before he says see that was Melchizedek he said Abraham had never seen Melchizedek that was just a body that God had made three seconds before he showed up he had never seen him on the family album he didn't recognize his faithly pictures and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and he seen three men Angels stood by and he ran and bowed himself down to him and he said my Lord eyes it wasn't his physical eyes that seen three men show up that made him say my Lord it was a supernatural eyes it was a supernatural revelation of eyes of his swords predestination that the spirits Blended and his spiritual eyes could see that God help my eyes God help my eyes this is not about religion religion will make you Stone blind this is about Jehovah Jireh this is this is way beyond that this is not about even church this is about a relationship your relationship with Christ the anointed one your personal relationship and when we bring your personal relationship when we come together then we blend our personal relationships with Christ that we've had through the week amen it's not about a business that the world has turned into a business and then Matthew 12 and 22 and then brought him onto one possessed with the devil and blind now watches this was a person that was had the devil in them and he was physically blind and um and Jesus healed them in so much that the blinded dumb both spake and saw now that's Supernatural that's really Supernatural and the churchgoers sitting around them and all the people were amazing and not the son of David but the churchgoers heard it and they said this fellow does it by the devil for he is the prince of devils that's what religion will give you not eyesight they were stoned blind they were looking at the king of kings the Lord of Glory and their eyes they never seen amen God help us God help us you know we don't need to put on and I I mentioned this before you know we don't need to put it on the world or denominational churches because they're Stone blind people sitting in every message Church these were Pharisees that were message people these were Pharisees that when you took the scroll of the day I took a pin and stuck it through it the Bible says they could tell every letter that it hit I'm telling you when you get to know the message out well I'm going to want to sit by you and they couldn't see they couldn't see the Bible says that blessed are you if you're persecuted for God's sake here here's Jesus and he said unto them I'll forgive you but if you do that to the spirit you'll never be forgiven do you know and I don't say this to I want to say this to shake you at this time this scripture it could apply to anyone of you how many of you have been called devils knowing you're the bride of Christ and it'll never come from the world very very seldom will there be somebody that you work with that'll call you a devil but it'll be a Pharisee it'll be a man is this scripture help me out you're getting quiet on me is this scripture if it happened to Jesus but you're Jesus today did he not say that your very own Bibles calls you gods are you not the our Prophet said the only Jesus this world ever see and the Wyoming grocery store is you uh-huh is because of eyes amen I've had this exact same experience happen to me multiple times that Jesus had and we shouldn't be surprised because see Jesus said you're surprised they persecute you because you're a good believer he said They Crucified me and stoned the prophets and you're expecting different so many times we do you know I've got letters from Believers in message churches that told me that the devil rejoices further Dale when you wake up because he's so happy because you're a servant of the devil I still have the letter see Jesus Jesus that's Jesus and the Bible says reach ice and be so fresh praise God you just made a testimony for him Hallelujah bless God amen amen wow I want to look into some of these examples longer and here here in this story of uh king or the prophet Elisha and the Syrian coming down on the Israelites he said in the in this verse that we're going to read the prophet mentioned it 27 times quotes of the time some of these scriptures we're going to look at was hundreds of times the prophet mentions these and it was talking about ice amen a matter of fact I'll even confess ible possibility to read all the quotes that were related to eyesight because it was in the hundreds of quotes amen Second Kings 6 and 17 Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee that thou open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened his eyes and the young man we know that was a help me out honey gehaza he opened the young man's eyes and he saw and behold the mountains was full of horses and Chariots of Fire around about Elisha you know and we're going to drop down but Psalms I believe it's 32 it says that the angels of the Lord are encountered about them that love him but here's a believer of the prophet and he couldn't see it here the Syrian Army had come down against Israel in this search in Second Kings 6 and the Syrian Army had come down and even the Syrian King every time they come down to Israel Israel was prepared for them and the Syrian King came and he said there's somebody that's squealing in our camp and here here is pagan people watch this Pagan remember I said it would never come from the world praise God Pagan believers not believers the world and they said King it's not so even the world knows that you're Jesus but the Pharisees don't know you're Jesus amen that's that's that's a paradox to me I mean we I have to work that through my mind but I went to man but they go to a man and he said here's remember this this is a pagan person and he said King they have a prophet in their land and he said he knows what you even think praise God in your bad Chambers and here's the servant of the Lord in uh verse I gotta find some glasses here amen in Second Kings six and uh 15 and then the servant of God raised early and gone before and behold the host composed compressed the city with both horses and chariots and the servant said unto him a last Master what shall we do and he answered he said fear not for there's more with us let there be with that amen but he could see it amen and then Elisha prayed for him and God opened his eyes and we know how the story went God opened his servant's eyes and he could see the Hillside and how God was protecting his bride amen and then we see even more so that that the prophet goes out to the Army and meets him now they were coming for him and he walks right out to him just like we oh Jesus and they were walking right out and we're a Believer brother might and they say who are you and they said well we're looking for this man and they said well you come with me and I'll lead you right to where he's at amen and hear the Prophet Elijah let him raid in the camp of the city and the kingdom even though what to do he was he was blowing his mind and the king of Israel said what should we do kill them the prophet said nope cook them hamburgers and feed them show them the hospitality of the bride of Christ and send them home eyes here's Balaam another example in the Bible where Balaam was we know you know watch this we always preach at melon was the false prophet with that because the king when when Bailey came to hire Balaam you're not going to like what I'm going to say but he said you were a pastor of a church where miracles happen on a regular basis that don't sound false to me the Bible says that balak hired Balaam and he spoke out because of the power of God in his life and he's seen the blessings of God with them his life so I guess I don't mean if you're but Balaam liked the money you like the money of the big church he did I'm not making this up this is scripture Numbers 22 and 23 and here here God Balaam went to God so many times to do what he was going to get paid for balik said I'll make it worth your while and Balaam went and we preached on this before not many weeks ago and how Balaam said he said I'm I'm hired to curse these people but I want to die just like them because they got something I want to die like a righteous man we preached out a month ago and here in numbers 23 and I just paraphrase these in the verses and I'll give you the verses but here Balaam went so many times that God finally said well you can go ahead and go and and I'm trying to show you the Paradox of God the Paradox of God I know you're not getting it the Paradox of God because God said go and the very next scripture God said God's anger was kindled because he went huh you think God tells you to go there and you say well praise God I got God's blessing and God was angered now how in the world could God be angry at God's voice but God didn't want to tell them but he came so many times that God said I'll give you your own way and you can go and then God sends the angel of the Lord there with the spear and burning fire and remember Balaam was hired because he had the power of God working in and through his life now all you got to do is read numbers 22. Gibson callings are without repentance we all know that scripture very well and we believe in those works but there are no signs and bound is a perfect example of that now I pray to God they'll be in our midst and I pray to God they're in me and I pray to God they're in you but we have Balaam for an example what are we going to do with him and here God this I this I I I meditate on that that God would say go and the very next verse the Bible says God's anger was kindled matter of fact farther down the I'm trying to show you something that you might be walking as a Christian and you think you got God's blessing and God wants to kill you you say how do I know because farther down the scripture says that if the dumbass of a donkey wouldn't have seen the Angel God said I myself would have killed you wow I read that and I said how in the world amen When God says no don't ask again don't weary God into giving you your own way because you won't be happy amen and here in numbers 23 and the ass saw the angel of the Lord but the prophet never you say well bless God I'm the bride of Christ be careful have you put eyesight on today I mean that's the greatest thing you can be as a bride of Christ I'm not knocking that but God help me help Brother David to see because the Bible says it'll be so close and then in verse 25 and then when the eyes saw the angel of the Lord and again you notice it says that the animal seen it now had the donkey got spiritual ASAP and not the prophet I'll tell you what it was church it was a prophet in this case battle had an agenda and it was money see if you're a servant of God no matter what happens in your life or in your ministry it makes no difference to you because it's not mine it makes no difference so I didn't pick the ministry I didn't get the ministry you see me it was us all gods and so the foot and the same so the footsteps of the righteous are ordered the Lord so this is when something your life for catastrophe what's sadness even death hey God knows because you won't understand I tell you right now you won't understand death you won't understand if God takes a little child from us sir man unless you insert God there little children born to them for them to die before the parents unless you insert God there see there's things that we won't understand in this day and so here here the donkey seeing God it's reported in the scriptures multiple times three times at least and then in verse 28 numbers 28 or 22 28 . it said God even opened the mouth of the Donkey to talk to The Preacher Man wow and Balaam said in verse 29 Balaam said unto the ice he said if I would have had a sword I would have killed you that's why believers get called what Jesus got called here's the Pharisees calling Jesus babosama and that same spirit's alive and well today so there'll be people calling you Babel's about or saying the devil rejoices when you wake up because you're a servant of the devil and if it was legal just like the prophet Balaam here they would pull their sword and kill you but but because it ain't legal they don't do that here God had made it so Balaam couldn't kill the Donkey and then we looked down Amen in verse 31 of Numbers 22 and then the Lord then finally the Lord you say finally God does all things perfectly then in verse 31 the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam this is a man that had miracles in his life and the power of God moving through his life and that's why balak hired him for the job you know I I see things in the message ranks that make me vomit I do I'm sorry I'm just being truthful if you don't like it it's still the truth like when ministers will post like well we're going to have something great and we're going to have seasoned worldwide Ministry come by what's that mean what's that mean brother man how can you be seasoned like how's the Holy Ghost seasoned the Bible said a priest is a priest before he's born the Bible says and so like if you're a priest before you were born and you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God called you before you're born and then we say they're seasoned okay that's not God that's not God you know what that is that's worship that's worship of a man it's also called politics but it's worship of a man of God Balaam baelic knew he could get what he needed so he come to him that's an agenda seasoned minister amen and he was Stone blind wow and God opened in 31 and God opened Bella's eye and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and the sword drawn in his hand and then watch verse 33 and the ass saw me and God's talking to Balaam and he's given him a weapon I mean he pulled out the leather strap this time and he said God said to Bellamy said and yes saw me and heard from me these three times and unless she had turned for me surely I also would have slayed you you think you're arriving the ship be careful you think you're driving the car we all have a sweet Heavenly Father that's who's driving the car remember what the Bible says he says remember you Masters that have people under you that God that God is your master amen and he vengeance is his saith the Lord here he's telling us a prophet if the donkey hadn't have seen you three times now I I'm just going to ask you God had told Balaam that he could do no it was after he had went to God three times he said I would have saved thee I would I would have slayed thee but the donkey saved your life the donkey saved your life amen God help us amen see we need spiritual eyes to look past the agendas and the politics and the seasoned ministers and just look at the Holy Ghost the Sweet Holy Ghost amen here in this scripture he says in John 14 17 pull this up Amy please John 14 17. now here here our prophet on on 17 he mentions quotes 79 times and in verse 19 he mentions it over hundreds of times amen he said even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth oh there's those eyes again it seeth him not and if you can't see them then you don't know them I'm going to show you quotes for that I got a backup plan the prophet said that man neither do they see him not neither do they know him but ye know him for he dwell in you and ye shall be and he shall be in you now verse 19 yet a little while the world seeth me no more but ye see church we must see Christ but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also amen Hallelujah God help us the spirit I I know this might have shook you that's the spirit of Truth amen and God's no respecters of persons so God don't use the language seasoned whoa is that scripture it says if you respect your person that you're guilty of everything in the Bible amen Second Kings two nine and ten here our Prophet mentions about 50 times each verse and it came to pass that when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha I sweat you will what I will do for thee before I am taken away from thee amen now we know that this here verse is talking about the bride of Christ and we know I'm telling you this morning the prophet said it that we the bride of Christ the elect of this day today have a double portion now he said things what brother Branham done was nothing to what I'll do I know I see through that that's what the prophet said I can't help it if you're a non-believer the prophet said that Jesus said he said the works out you'll do greater than I'll do I can't help it if you get unbelief but there's one key to the works that you'll do and the prophet said this by the way we'll read these quotes at the end the line up with these scriptures he said it doesn't that you have to have your eyes on a seasoned minister and it's nothing or the problem foreign not bad and yes before I do and Elijah said unto Elijah said I pray thee let me have a double portion of the spirit upon me and verse 10 and this is in Second Kings two and verse 10 and he said thou has asked a hard thing but nevertheless this is only a tight and the natural the prophet said every scripture has his dual personal dual reasons this is an example in the flesh for you and the spirit and he said nevertheless if thou will keep your eyes on Christ amen Christ was Elisha at that time this is a physical type if thou will keep the eyes on me Christ and when if you'll keep your eyes on me when I am taken from thee then it will be so unto thee Amen on Christ and what's Christ the anointed one the anointed one and that anointed one can and is in Tabernacle in each one of you here keep your eyes on the anointed one Jehovah Christ amen and he says but there's a disclaimer but if not shall not be so it shall not be so because our eyes to be unpressed amen you can't have a pre-agenda idea it's all Christ if Christ be for us who can be against us amen it's all about Christ the anointed one it's his plan it's his kingdom amen eyes see here here in this story just look into this for a bit Elijah and Elisha were both God's prophets and they were both men of God and they both did fantastic things but Elisha did resilience more than Elijah because he seen so if you were looking at this in a mathematical way if you're not seeing you need to pray for Isaac if you don't see God move don't say well my sister Disturbed me or my brother it's the mama it's the parents I was raised bad the pastor's no good no I said just did I said spiritual assets say Lord you just go to prayer in your own closet amen see the Bible says that those that pray in secret it really helps your eyesight the Bible says he will reward you open you won't be able to keep what God's showing Hallelujah John 14 and 9. here's Philip and he was come to them and he said Jesus show us the Father and Jesus was insulted he was Jesus said unto him Philip he said I've been so long in time with you and yet thou has not even known me you haven't even seen me in the Bible it has a question mark after that and he goes on he says he that has seen me has seen the father and how say a Sal they show me now that would be like somebody sending you something and you say you don't see Jesus in there I've been so many years with you You Don't See Jesus Anymore I didn't tell you something this morning you're not going to find your hero in this world you're not going to find a super preacher they're not going to happen you're not going to find a super Prophet it ain't going to happen and you ain't going to find a super leader of any country so you might as well quit looking but there's a super god amen there's a super God and it's tabernacled in all of you but we have trouble right and the exact same Holy Ghost that's tabernacled in me it's tabernacled in you it don't come with a different rating it don't come with the man of God amen a woman of God we could say that about everybody in the church that would be truthful that would be totally truthful you could go up to these young men or young women young kids and say man or woman of God you say oh well bless God I'm not sure I've seen they've got the baptism My Little Ghost they do if their parents do the Bible teaches us very clearly that until a child comes to the age of accountability that the Holy Ghost and the parents is for the kids and you were having trouble seeing your hero if you want to find a hero get a child go to the least of these go to the youngest one and there's your hero because it's Christ it's Christ that's totally the spirit of Christ amen anything outside of that God help us see that mount of scriptures that's in the Bible let's look at what the prophet says here he says when I was a young Minister and had one of my first revivals and the pillar of fire came down it was the first time it appeared in public he said there was people that walked out now it appeared publicly he said some people are in the Tabernacle night and he said some people walked away and said that's just an imagination I'm looking right at you brother Matt and you're just an imagination to some people and then there was other ones that looked at it look at what he says he said that was just imagination and they would leave the building where there was people that seen it and walked away and said I saw it and others would say and I'm reading this quote he said and others in the same meeting would say well I didn't see it I didn't see it and that's the way every one of us are when we rub shoulders with each other unless we've been in our prayer closet because because of the veil of the badger skin we have trouble with these eyes seeing Jehovah it don't matter what you're wearing this morning it matters The Price is Right amen he said now watch this he said now of course god let's see who he wants he said watch this he said no you're looking at this I I I pray to God you can get this amen the Bible's rightful of it where God came on the scene and there was people present right in the power of God and people looked at and said I don't see nothing and other people looked at it and they were changed for eternity and they're waiting for you to get there he said when the Wise Men followed the star and he talks about he said there was no history and that they would observe and watch the Stars at the time and he said but no one's seen the star but the wise men no but it was just right up there how could you look at that light and say well I don't see them no I don't do that no yeah it's not there he said there's not one Speck of history or evidence that they ever kept time by the Stars good practices this is an everlasting life and he said but no one's seen the stars but the wise men see that's right because they were looking for now the key is are you looking for Christ you know I was preaching even this year and you know your locals know it I said I can't see that that God won't come back before June and some people were they said well you prophesied no I said I can't imagine that we'll go past June that's exactly the way I felt because when you start looking for Christ you say oh brother Dale you're a false prophet because you said he'd come by Jude our Prophet said he would see it Prophet believed with his whole entire heart that he would never go by the way of the Great but I want to tell you something you better be Mighty scared if you get offended because somebody says I can't believe that we'll go through this month and it's almost over before God how can you be afraid and offended that somebody would believe the rapture is out there you got to be kidding me he said because they were looking for it and they were expecting to see it and it guided them to Christ I'll tell you what the Bible says he's coming for those that are looking for him watching for him there's going to be many disappointments and many surprises the Bible says in the Rapture because there's going to be born-again Believers that won't be there because they weren't not watching for him that they weren't watching for it remember when the when Melchizedek came to Abraham he was sitting at the tent he recognized it man he was watching for it when you the Bible says when you rise up when you walk in the day and when you lay down you say oh God today maybe now this afternoon in the evening in the morning because it's it's just like a constant so they were expecting to see it and it guided them to Christ and yet it passed by everybody else and they looked at the skies every the people looked at the skies until but nobody's seen it going but the wise men where it was intended for them to see it now I want to tell you something God never called us to be a bride of Christ for him to leave us here but he and every example I'm going to preach in Ottawa you know the the Ottawa the Ottawa thing is that all things are ready let me tell you what all things I got to get off this subject or don't come to Ottawa all things were ready when the spots in God's thoughts they were ready but everybody had a choice amen everybody had a choice but in God's thoughts they were already written and the question ain't whether they're already it's our you ready see Abraham you know I'm sorry Abraham had a choice whether he would go through and take his sons Isaac's life amen and I gotta stop right there I won't have to go to Ottawa amen and nobody's seen it but the wise men and he said if God intends you to see it then you'll see it here and here he goes on to Elisha he said nobody's seen the angels to camped about the syrians and Elijah but Elisha and then until he prayed and then his servant that was a total of two people two people seen the protection of God on the bride of Christ God help us amen God never give us a spirit of fear man you don't go through life and fear but love and power and it's our mind I'm not serving God out of fear of hell if you are you're deceived Hallelujah God help us God help us God open our eyes so we can see amen let's just look at some examples that our Prophet showed us amen he said so look at the Believers around here who fear God so the angels are everywhere and you give the scripture of Psalms Amen Let me just go to that scripture amen Psalms 34 7 we may pull that up Amy the angels of the Lord are encamped about them that fear Him and deliver it he died amen and he said now if you can just worship God watch this those are direct quote from show us the father he said if you can just you know that's why I God help our worship it's not about if I can sing her well or it has nothing to do with quality nothing it has everything to do with the spirit amen it has everything to do with Christ the anointed one amen that's why the believer in other countries will be a million miles ahead you know our Prophet said he said and I don't like this but I'm talking to my wife our Prophet says that the more you're educated and the Richer you are the farther you are from Christ it's guaranteed it's not maybe it's that's safe the Lord because see if you're educated you rely on your own wisdom and if you have money well you definitely don't need God you can pay doctors that'll drug you to death is it good to be poor because if you were Rich you might have been on that sub that went down to see the Titanic so there's an advantage to being poor if you got so much money that needed so many people that would have fed in the poor countries about two and a half billion 3 billion discussing of the deaf oh that was education well I believe you can have an education and still serve God but if you rely on it you're lost and I believe you can have two dollars and still rely on God but if you rely on your two dollars you're lost amen he said no and this shows the father he said now if you can just worship God and open our eyes we'll find the Gods all around all around oh but you know I thought God was no all around us if you could just worship God and he would open your eyes and you would see some of you need to watch your worship for people that are lost in the spirit it's been too long since most of us have been here it's a choice it's a choice if you go in your secret closet okay that's a choice amen Hallelujah he said now watch this this is this is a this this one's gonna oh wow he says now if we stood here tonight and we looked at the angel circling this church this is everlasting life and how to receive it and there was many of you here that perhaps would say I've never seen it happen oh I feel sorry for you but you'd say well that Pillar of Fire that led the children he said that see that's the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said I came to the same the same pillar fire came to the prison cell where Peter was and he come out and the Believers were praying for Peter and they said I seen a ghost we prayed but we didn't believe and God answered the prayer why it's a ghost they needed I said the same pillar fire and the angel Lord is here after all these hundreds of years yes thousands of years he's still here now Among Us and he said we have the picture to prove it he said the actual same Pillar of Fire the led the children of Egypt and he said well I actually believe that that light came to the prison I'm just trying to find where we're going and if the angel the Lord was standing here right now every one of your eyes would be just able to see it it would be pretty good but God actually registered it amen that wasn't the one I thought hey man here we got here we go this was awaking Jesus 63. and if we can only know him that if we get here here's a here's a make-believer saying in the prophet's meetings he said someone says in church tonight he says somebody comes to Wyoming let's let's make this person somebody comes to the Wyoming church and say well if I can only know that God was really here Among Us he said is there any way question mark he said you could you could look at him and now listen close this is what the prophet says now listen close before we go to the prayer he you can look at him and say there he lays right in the boat and now there he is he's right there in that view now if only we had some way of seeing Christ like that if we could just put our finger on it and say now he came to our church and he sat right near the front and I could pinpoint it but watch what the prophet says about that he says if we could just do that then there he is right there then we know we're in the will of God he says now but if he was that close he said he's even closer because watch how he answers this he's even closer now for I'll be with you and even end you to the end of the world he's even closer than he was with the disciples in the boat because they had to cross the bow of the boat to get to him well he was three feet away from him and you're closer today today right now and you're dead he says because they had to go across the deck of the boat and back to the back to wake him up and I don't have to go over here and say Jesus wake me up [Music] you can't get no closer than he is to you if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to take one single step you don't have to call it a seasoned minister praise God you just got to call the season Jehovah the season right inside of you amen this is Awakening Jesus 63. this is what the prophet taught us amen but you got to have eyes to see this amen we would be happy to live in that day but we're living in a greater day today because he's not just close to us we're not just walking beside him he's not just in our church he's inside of us and he promises that he'll never leave us or forsake us you can't get any better than that but many times we don't recognize presence and many times watches Believers this is where we got to be really careful we don't recognize his presence in other people and we curse God in the other person and that's why the scripture said that it would be better if you weren't born than to offend somebody that didn't measure up to your stature of wealth bless God I'm with the elites that's disgusting amen he says they had to go to the back of the boat and wake him up he said don't you don't have to do that he said Oh my he said wow I feel really religious right now now the prophet's like losing his mind and this is real but if we could really comprehend this if you could go beyond brother Daya and go into the spirit you'd be losing your mind too amen said Hebrews 8 13 8 which we know so well with brother Brown preached said he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he's any different he's not the God I'm serving but he's not different well he's different to most people because they had their God in past tense amen but that's not spiritual the same God that was when Jesus was on Earth was the same God in brother Branham is the same God here in Wyoming this morning and it ain't one spec difference not one's back not one spilly Speck amen Hallelujah Hallelujah and he'll never leave you nor forsake you he said no matter how the boat's rocking or what's going on in your life there's nothing else that you can cling to but him hallelujah amen in a witness the double portion of his Spirit be upon me and he said if you see me he said I'm just closing with these last couple quotes he lined up with these scriptures he said but if you'll see me when I go you'll be in the rapture if you're seeing Christ when the Rapture comes you'll be in the rapture you know our Prophet said that before the Rapture in the Bible talks there'll be a great Resurrection and the Believers are coming they'll knock on your door brother Mike hello and your neighbors will look out across the road brother Matt you have to have a neighbor for the neighbors to see it and the neighbors and model up the door talking to somebody and they'll go that matter over there he's [Music] because he's talking to himself but he's talking in such a way that he's like not talking to himself and our Prophet said you only ones that'll see it are the ones that are going can you imagine I just want you to think about this for a minute and we're going to close can you imagine me brother Dale when somebody has passed on before comes to my door and I recognize him I mean there will be pictures broke in the house doobie walls walked through there will be Windows smashed I will be out of control I mean we'll need to we'll need more than a janitor we'll need a maintenance back just just simply when you know just like in a year oh it'll be unbelievable things it will be on at that moment you're not just connected but your dad you know you're there you know what's happened you know you've arrived we don't have the ability to comprehend what that'll be like amen he says here in the Covenant of Abraham and his seed he said now you'll stumble for sure as this world but he said let your eyes I remember I mentioned this before he said Keep Your Eyes straight on Calvary and look so close he said imagine Elijah he said man he said imagine Elijah Elisha when Elijah told him what he said he said can you imagine that this is how we serve God too many times brother Dale oh well you know uh I'm in a hurry today oh no well today I woke up late he said can you imagine Elisha after Elisha told him you'll get it as long as you he said his eyes never left and if he got tired he used toothpicks there wasn't no chance of the word read the scripture because Elisha tried to trick him he said well I'm going to go over here and I'll be back oh no oh no he said as the Lord liveth if that's where you're going that's where I'm going Jesus that's why the Bible says that when you go some places Jesus don't go the prophet said that the holy Dove wait so tight amen that's why Believers don't go to Evil places because the holy Dove ain't there plus Scott that's a choice you make amen he said Elisha never took his eyes off Elisha certainly not for one moment because I would be the exact and in the day and hour that you think is he don't return the master return us amen and he kept his eyes right on him and if you'll see me when I go away he said you'll have him and he said when God made the Covenant with Christ he said Christ made it with the church oh and the same holy ghost that was in Christ will have to be in the church or she will never go wow amen there was one of those and I don't have the quote it must have been in the hundreds literally hundreds that I read and he said the problem with the church today is it got one eye on church or the prophet and they got one eye on the word he said it'll never win God help us let's just read our scripture that we started with and we'll close Revelations 3 18. and here's God revealing to John he's counseling them it's John was the Revelator here he's on the island completely surrendered to the anointing of God and God saying counsel Thee I counsel thee to buy of me go tried in the fire that's under pressure the Taoist may be rich that's spiritually rich and white Raymond that's holy and that thou Mays be clothed in thy shame of thy worldliness nakedness does not appear and anoint thine eyes I'm counseling me this morning God's counseling me this morning and I believe God's counseling you anoint thine eyes with Isaac that those may see Christ the anointed one amen God help God help us amen see it should not be and it never is Believers don't fight believers Believers don't Believers don't tell Jesus after he healed a blind and dumb man I mean he couldn't speak and he was physically blind a Believer never came to Jesus the believer said there's the son of David but the religious people said and you know in that scripture God it says that Jesus knew their hearts and he told them the truth he said if Satan's kingdom is cast the note Satan then it's divided and it'll never stand in other words he was mocking watch this church he was mocking the religious greeds if you think that Satan is casting out Satan basically Jesus said your return but the same thing that happened to Jesus if you're his will happen to you and it'll come from a Pharisee of this message who will God help me God help them let's stand reason I say God helped them is because their eyes haven't seen Christ in Plainview thank you Lord Jesus amen you know we should be the happiest and richest and fullest life Believers Christians in the world you should be you should just be bubbly you know I went and had dinner with brother Jim and brother Jr pray for brother Jr he needs Wheels he needs Wheels to be here he's only working three or four days a week he'd be here every service he had Wheels to get here and also brother Jim his sister-in-law what's her name sorry Lois Lois is Linda's sister in the flesh she's a registered nurse she's been living with them on the weekend the weekdays and she does everything amen she does everything and they just found a big Mass on her they took tests and she'll find out this week if it's malignant and you know brother Jim's well in his 70s and if this daughter-in-law is taken out of the picture like brother Matt said we're not here forever brother Jim and sister Linda are both agents and brother Jim will be completely back to doing everything overwhelmed that's 24-hour care seven days a week amen let's just remember that amen remember that we pray that as long as Linda God chooses to leave her here and my prayer is that God would heal her and raise her up or heal her and take her to Glory and both are healings amen Hallelujah both are humans if I was Sister Linda I'd be begging God to take me home begging God take me home that's heaven we shouldn't be afraid of Heaven I'm not afraid of going to heaven I'm not afraid of saying goodbye to this world and all it's sin and politics not at all amen remember them and remember Junior just said he might get his family over here and if he gets Wheels he'd be with us much much amen but God help us but you know when we went out for supper I was telling those Brothers about Brother Joseph and sister Mariah gonna favor us with the presence and you know how the brothers remembered sister Maya said oh she's a sister that's just bubbly that's the sister that's amen that's how brother Jim remembered amen that's a great testimony amen we should be the ones when we when you know when you go to the grocery store in Wyoming and the world burdened with the cares of the world and they're a weak month behind on their rent and they can't afford food in the grocery store and you should be the one that uplifts their spirits and they go wow I was in the presence of Jesus today tabernacled in Badger skin amen God help us God help us let's sing that song open our eyes oh [Laughter] [Music] we want to see Jesus [Music] open I love and have been [Music] Hallelujah Jesus what this song is saying before we sing it again is you're never going to reach out to Jesus if you don't see him with your spiritual life you're just going to go through life and one week you'll be running to another and one month into another and you're going to be coming to old age like every one of us is and you will never reached out to Christ if you don't pray for Isaac that you can recognize his presence today the same as yesterday forever may God help us see Christ and camped about us we need to think on these things God goes to great effort to protect you God goes to Great Lengths to bless you and so many times we spit in this because it never happened the way we had a plan it never fit our agenda because we were blind we were just blind I said my God I thought I would see you I was there all the time I was there God help me God help me help me Jesus Hallelujah open my eyes Jesus and help me [Music] help me Jesus help me Jesus [Music] and say that we love him [Music] [Music] is love I want to see Jesus I believe with all of my heart and the word of God says that those that ask shall receive it's not you might you shall I believe with all of my heart and the Bible backs it up that if you ask God Pure Heart say God how I haven't seen you for a long long time with my eyes please put Salve on it please Jesus help me to realize that I won't have to go my and go to the back of the boat I won't have to get up and even come to the front of the church and those are all all right they're all good but help me to see that you're inside and every step I take in every place I look I wish I had the quote I know many of you that have been in the message will know this story told about the Sunday school boy that went to a Sunday school teacher and the prophet tells it he went to his Sunday school teacher and he said take your teacher he said can you show me Jesus everyone the boy with an honest heart went to his mom and dad he said Mom and Dad he said all these people are talking about Jesus I never seen Jesus [Music] show me him show me a picture show me something my mom and dad same as the Sunday School teachers backslidden looking for a kingdom on Earth said oh you got to talk to the preacher you know the story the preacher was worse than all of the first and after church he went fishing with one of the old brothers one that nobody would talk to the one with come to church and overhauls had no education fed a few pigs or caught him the boy asked me said brother he said I've been asking everybody all these people talk about this person but I've never seen them Whole World's talking about Jesus they don't have a clue who he is they got them in three people or four people or five people or they got them in a priest or I bet you some kind of ministry I even heard the Christian radio God forgive me for even having it on and the brother was praying to Virgin Mary about how she was the god almost made me throw up in my truck and I shut the radio off disgusting you said sir can you show me Jesus he told that little boy he said boy in my whole life everything I've looked at has been Jesus Jesus was on the water Jesus was the water Jesus was in the boat and he was the boat he was in the fish he was in the trees he was in the wind our Prophet talked about it he said God was in nature and everything you've seen in nature was in God and you struggle to believe he's in you oh God help us God forgive us throw our shoulders back God's in a tree and God's in the wolf the kai Powells and gods in the beaver that snaps his tail surely to goodness surely the goodness you could just possibly think he was in The Bride a Holy Ghost billbride some would say that's just too much for me wow wow God help us if a dung dumb donkey could see the angel of the Lord right in the middle of the road that the angel literally would have killed the prophet you had a home and read that scripture how much the donkey did to avoid the sword of a dumb Beast and we'd walk right up to him and God would say if you come any closer I'm gonna have to take your life Without Me Jesus fatherly let's sing this one more time open eyes [Music] touching [Music] and say that we love
