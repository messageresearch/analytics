announcement for read our scriptures Easter weekend Mike Allen from Ohio is going to be with us he's actually coming over his his kids March break so he will actually be with us on Wednesday night and Saturday night we're going to have Fort Washington communion that's Easter weekend amen and he'll be here Sunday with us so whatever date that is I think it's about the ninth or something like that but Easter weekend that Saturday um you uh hypothetically Saturday will probably have service whenever it's convenient for everybody but five six o'clock something like that I mean that's flexible I'd like to have Sarah to your service earlier because then people can go back and be not tired for Sunday hey Matt so that'll be a real blessing and also we we changed the posters out here for the July first weekend and so there's updated posters there for the family camp at Silver Lake and the youth Rally or weekend at John dankwas and I I would hugely encourage you if if I'm your pastor be at one of those meetings unless you're sick or dead amen amen I just I just I mean if that offends you I'm sorry but amen I don't believe in sitting home and I don't believe in going to a denominational charge that's just they they don't have no food they don't even have the same God so uh then not only they don't have food they don't even have same Gods amen let's just read our scriptures and we're going to continue on the same thought and and I you know what the prophet said Romans 10 and uh my print on my message thing iPad comes up small room it's 10 and 14 and we're going to read a couple scriptures and you have your seats amen you know the prophet said in the message he said the hardest thing God ever did is have him have one person listen to another person and get the first person to believe that the second person is used in speaking for God the hardest thing God ever did amen all the way through the Old Testament in the New Testament you think of you know the prophet even mentioned in quotes as they withstood Moses they said you know Moses you're not the only one that God speaks to and you know amen we know what happened amen Hallelujah and how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him by whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent and as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preached the gospel of peace and bring good tidings and good things good tidings of good things man just one more scripture we read it last week yes we scroll back up second Timothy 3 and 16 and all scriptures is given for inspiration of of inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine and reproof for correction and instruction and righteousness and verse 17 and that the man of God make me perfectly and thoroughly finished Lord Jesus we ask you that the blessing to your word and may you come and minister to your bride this morning we pray amen amen just you may have your seats just uh carrying on our thought for last week and just actually just come to me I forgot earlier I'm sorry in my today this very day today exactly nine years ago we had our first church service exactly nine years ago and I would say that God was more than faithful and he's done exceedingly above everything you could even ask or think he's done exceedingly above everything he's ever told me he would do when he called me there was things that God said that he would do and I couldn't imagine nine years ago that we would be and and God would have held us and kept us the same but it's by the grace and love of almighty God Amen we love that this morning amen and we bless them amen so we look into this thoughty man you see that that we know that the holy spirit is our head and and if the holy spirit is in our head then we're all lost we're all lost and and the Bible says to know them that labor among you and if you don't know them that labor among you you need to pray and and fast and and dwell in that and watch the person that's labored among you amen we're taking our character with us you know in no way are these messages there's no way is God trying to I I God don't believe in respects the persons and in no way is the holy spirit ministering this thought with respect to the ministers that that's not the case and if you know me if you don't know me if you think that amen uh that's the farthest thing from my thought but we are living in a laodicean world that headship is a major problem and we mentioned that last week where where nobody submissive to nobody nobody obeys the government or the police or the or their husbands and the parents kids don't you know the Bible says in the last time the kids will be rebellious to parents amen and all these things it's nobody wants to answer to anybody but we all have a head and no matter how high you go up on the the lottery Christ is our head and believe me Christ can give you a spanking like nobody can give you Hallelujah Grace will ultimately protect his holy ghost feel bright and if there's somebody hurting his bride he can take you by an untimely death amen so you can have faith and you should you know the prophet said this also he said you know you stay with your pastor but if he leaves the word of God you run for your life run for your life now you may have things that you know but but the prophet said many things in this and well let me read some of these quotes just to show you this he said being a Christian today we deal mostly with this he said oh how could it be that Believers have so many different ideas how in the world could the message of God the the the full revealed truth of the Bible through that God sent that's just beautiful and perfect through the humblest person that ever breathes next to Christ and you have people that are as different as the black is from the white our Prophet said how in the world could that even be he said it was the greatest thing we deal with he said so many different thoughts and many different angles and approach to the gospel and he said everyone is claiming that they are perfectly right and the next fellow is totally and completely wrong this is a direct quote by the way and he said when you see that from someone doing that then you're pretty well sure your party washer that you're on the line he said the Bible says that he that thinks he knows something he knows nothing wow amen here's another one there's so many isms and Fashions and everything else in the world today in so many different ideas he mentions that phrase dozens of times I I brought even ones that I liked and I left them in my desk because that's all we would have read this morning amen and things and he said the father he said he knows that we're not trying he hears a prophet watch this he said he says Thou knowest that I we're not trying to say that here on this platform that we're the only one that have your message whoa how in the world did the prophet that brought the message say that he was teachable our Prophet was teachable he was teachable God helped brother Dale to be teachable Hallelujah amen he said he said I'm trying to tell them and every believer and everyone that believes that it that to be brought that's brought into relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we have to have a relation we have to not just have a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ But first you have to have a revelation or an understanding or both of who your lord Jesus Christ is Hallelujah and he ate three or four people amen and he ain't just the body in flesh he is a the spirit of God almighty he is Jehovah Jireh he said there the trouble of the church today he said now listen to me and he said he said this is amazing this in Jehovah driving this this is a direct quote from the prophet he said there's trouble in the church today and he said now listen to me and these next words you know this is the truth this is the prophet he says I love you and he said you know I do that and he said but there's a thing and it's with you he said there's been uh different uh you know doctrines are different things in doctrinations he said but the thing is that you've been indoctrinated sorry with so many different ideas amen I don't want you to learn brother Dale's ideas I am just a mouthpiece for brother for God Jehovah's ideas man just the whole word of God every line upon line precept upon precept it's all good for Doctrine and amen even the ones that brother Dale don't like Hallelujah he said you've been indoctrinated with so many ideas tell you don't know what to do he said and now that's the truth and he said now one Miracle could happen here in a foreign country he names a foreign country and he said over there in some of those countries over there and thousands of people with border Christ and the same Miracle would happen right here in Wyoming and you'd be sitting in your Pew saying I wonder if that's God he said but when the Lord comes and does something here you go oh wow I guess um maybe I could he said what the problem is is your attitude wow it's the same God just trust God man you know in Colossians 4 and and this is just beautiful let me just read this said in Colossians 4 he said Masters give unto your servants that which is just in in for Colossians 4 1. he said Masters give unto your servant thou which is just an equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven man we're not preaching respects of person but God has a program and a way he goes and continue in prayer and watching the same with Thanksgiving and here here the scripture you know what they use a uh a difficult English word but I mean it's here with all it means always be here with all the definition of here with all is Old English but it means continually here with all praying also for us talking about the ministers that God would open our open us a door of utterance our big mouth and speak the mysteries of Christ for which I am also a slave in bonds to Hallelujah that we might make manifest as we ought to speak here's Paul saying I need your prayers the greatest messenger in the Bible he wrote All mobiles all the New Testament he brought was a messenger of grace and mercy Moses brought the law Paul brought grace and mercy and here he's saying pray for me pray for me the Christ will open Revelation is given by Jehovah God and that I might utter and speak What God Says walk in wisdom towards them that are without Redeeming the time and let our speech always be with Grace and season with salt that we may know how we ought to answer every man as we read that song pleasing God help me there are situations that you will deal with that we need God's help I need God's help we all need God's help you got families here this morning your parents you need God's help raising these kids they need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can be the best prayer in the world and it'll be a catastrophe you need Jehovah God's anointing amen it's beyond man's ability but God does have principles to build up and support you and if you do all in your ability then God will back you up Hallelujah you know Israel just had to show up for those battles and God took care of the rest you know when Israel went and he had Joshua I was I read all of Joshua this weekend and as the armies you know God called Joshua and Joshua was The Greatest Warrior of all and greater than Moses and and they divided the promised land to the people of Israel and here Joshua was going to war and God said whoa whoa whoa you got way too many people in your church that's a new doctrine wow you know our Prophet said he said I want to character of the people you could have hundreds and hundreds of people but if they don't have no character amen God wants character we want Believers now we want new people to come in and taste and see what we've seen as good but God but in a relationship we want we want real brothers and sisters brothers and sisters with the backbone to stand up for what's right and just and true for their family and their Church Hallelujah God help us God help us here you know here's a saying that I and I seen and I wrote it down and it's good when he said you know leaders and pastors and Ministry of the fivefold ministry should lead you closer to Christ and not farther away Hallelujah closer to Christ if they're building you to themselves this is not brother this is not a kingdom building except for Christ and this is a multi-member bride we're just a piece of the toe or little finger and the whole body of Christ it's not just Wyoming going in a rapture it's a many-membered bride from around the world Hallelujah don't don't watch it watch this this is a really good scene he said ministers should point you bull you closer to Christ he said don't put them too high on a pedestal that they would hinder your personal relationship with Christ you can go directly to him amen many times in the church world I mean I mean we believe in respects but we should respect everybody I totally you know how I preach the scripture is touch not my anointing do my prophets no harm everyone with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Anointed hey man that's not just for Minister food ministers can use that self-serving that's for the bride of Christ amen be not respecter is a person the least in the body can judge the needs in the body Hallelujah that's not justified ministers God help us Ephesians 4 let's read a scripture here Ephesians 4 11 and we know this is very much and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers and for the perfecting of the Saints and the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ God help us that we're edifying Christ and not edifying our own personal Doctrine or our own personal Church people will ask you if you're a Christian or people ask you if you're a Christian Uptown you say well I go to this church or so-and-so is my pastor because you know that most of the world will know them but what's wrong with just saying yes I'm a Christian I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior hello you know I have the quote and I don't have it in front of me but I have the quote if you ask me the prophet said that about the I thought it was the Herald's Revival one of those Christian magazines and he says the only problem that I dislike about it and I've mentioned this before here I I had the quote and I found it I dug I dug deep he said as they matching names see it's not we're not we're not it's names you know like when we announce our anniversary meetings now I told you Mike Allen's coming in Easter but you know when we announce our our anniversary meetings in November the holy spirit's preaching amen we're in bodies boiled up you know ought not to be that way do we come to the unity of the faith verse 13 till we come to the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and the measure and Stat the stature fullness of Christ God help us God help us I want to find a one that just uh I know I read this last week he said please church have a little faith just a little while he said you must come under teaching he said and I read this last week I'm just he say I don't need anyone to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come and I have the Holy Ghost and he said friends that gives me just a little room to doubt whether you really even got the Holy Ghost he said you're acting in the weight and doing he said the same Holy Ghost that's teaching you but teachers in the body amen our Prophet that's not the only time he mentioned that here he said in another message in Israel and the church in paragraph 104 he said well they say I don't need anyone to teach me glory to God I got the Holy Ghost well then the Holy Ghost was wrong when he put some of the teachers in the church God put them in the church as teachers and that settles it and why did he put teachers in there he said if the Holy Ghost was going to do all the teaching I bring that up not because we're edifying ministers but I bring that up because we're living in a society around us that refuses to sit under anything and so they stay home and think they can press play and obey and they're deceived I had a person that was was messaging me and he was sending quotes and and we believe these quotes where where the Prophet had said he had come back to the Tabernacle to soar up food and Pastor Neville was going to use to start up food to serve the people and he said see the prophet's the only one with stored up food and I said the Bible says that you'll never be perfected under only a prophet's Ministry amen the Bible says that the secrets and the Mysteries will come to the prophets but he had fivefold Ministry and now you can't throw the prophet out see the other people they throw them out but the other people they only want a prophet confused and doctrines see the prophet said like this and different he said everybody in their mind has built a picture of God that's what that's what our Prophet said multiple quotes I could find dozens of them you have mercury he said you're made a thing of God and if the minister or the fivefold ministry or God himself steps out of that you draw a line the prophet said he said we're building a house not a wall and he said it takes a lot better Mason to turn corners we're building a building which is this is a house we're not just and so God turn corners and when you turn corners most people want to just go straight it's much easier to go straight well that's what I've always known was straight Matt help us Galatians 1 8 says but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we've preached unto you let them be a curse as we said before so say we now again here's Paul in the in the New Testament twice immediately back to back If any man preach any other gospel unto you then what we have received then let them be a curse you know the scripture in the the New Testament where Paul and I don't have in front of me and I'm not going there but where Paul said he said I fear and God's not given us a spirit of fear but Paul feared that people would come and preach another Jesus and see Paul wrote Ephesians 5. where he said it was the fivefold ministry was for the perfecting of the Saints and the work of the ministry and to come into the unity in the body of the Perfection of Christ it wasn't about the fivefold ministry it was just God worked through them amen God it's all about Jesus Christ everything is about Jesus Christ amen everything is about Jesus Christ Isaiah 28 and 9. we read that no we did not sorry apologize Isaiah 28 9 Whom Shall he teach knowledge and whom shall have understanding of Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and draw it from their breasts 14 for life for precept must be upon precept and precept upon precept and line upon line and here a little there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye shall cause the weary to rest it's not in the fightfold ministry it's not in man you're not resting in man you're not even rested in a man's message it's Christ it was Christ's message it was the Christ is the word and the word is the only thing that will never pass away you're resting in peace with the truth he's giving you the truth and you can just you know it's the right it's not like how do you know you go to because it's it's an n-word piece you've it's hard to explain besides predestination see you've been there and it's like you you recognize my sheep hear my voice and another and another they'll not follow amen thank you Lord my rest and this is refreshing yet they they would not hear that's see God's had a program that he would Minister through ultimately keeping God at the top totally got at the top the people have wanted to go straight directly to the top and bypass amen just like just like the work of Grace amen we believe in Salvation we believe in sanctification and we believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't just go from a sinner to Holy Ghost you have to repent God won't fill a cup that's dirty I don't want to drink a water out of a dirty cup God help us God help us not to skip the prophet said it like this he said you got the buggy on the top of the tree or you got the cart in front of the horse horses don't push very easy but that's how multiple people are trying to serve God God help us God to laid this out of planning man all we do I do is obey therefore hear the word of the Lord yeast and you scornful men that rule his people which are in Jerusalem help us Jesus that will that will obey God Amen to to get God's got the best thing for you and all you got to do is follow his Commandments amen he said here in this in the Seal of Christ he said they've rejected the truth when it was presented and then their ears are sealed up and they've turned to religion they've turned away from God and went to religion Hallelujah that's that's that's not in the denominations that's in the message it's not in the denominations they they've sealed up and their eardrums are punctured and because because they God's given them over to a strong delusion that they would believe a lie and they've turned away from the truth and God's given them a religion God help us God help us just like he said in the Christ the mystery of God revealed you know as chamber and James restood Moses and in there when they came out of Egypt he said you know they they wanted to do it their own way but God had a way God had a way God help us here here in some messages and and we're just we're teaching this morning but we want to do we want to know the truth amen here multiple times the prophet said that the Judgment seat the church is the Judgment seat of God the perfect type of the church the church is the Judgment seat and judgment begins in the house of God now how is that going to work for the people that don't attend church how's it going to work for the people that don't even believe in church there's people that believe this message with their whole heart they attended here they didn't believe in church buildings they didn't believe in communion they didn't believe in the fivefold ministry but they have the complete library in their house but wait a minute but that Library teaches church and fight for Ministry and communion and foot washing how did that happen no the very words that they say they believe they are rejecting the very Christ that they say I is my boss to reject him amen Christ said with the the word of God said was communion in foot washed he said this do till I return amen I know he's returned in the fullness of the word and I know the seals are open and the Bible is a brand new book and we have all the Mysteries but we're not going to Rapture yet I'm still here and so that so their their false teaching was this they said well Christ has already I believe that Christ came down in Revelations he come down in the cloud the headship and we have the fullness of the word we have everything that we'll have in heaven here except our glorified body we have just as much power here as we'll have in heaven he's given it to you already it's already paid for you're not going to have more power when you get to heaven but you're trapped in a flesh body that's the difference amen God help us in six he uh speak to the Rock the beginning of his message he said we but they've come to the place of Kenner spania in the time and he said I told this a great judgment seat and Israel came to the place of kedar spania where they had to make a decision and it says the great spring well there's a little Wells here and perfect types of the church he said the church is the Judgment seat where Heaven is a great judgment seat of God but the little Wells represent the little churches all out there the judgment begins in the house of God and there's where judgment begins and here's people came to the prophet and said now you're preaching the word of God and you need to back off the the doctrine of women and Holiness and and all these different things and he said God called me to preach his word and if preaching his word hurts me then he said you tell me I'm hurting my Ministry when when the Judgment seat is the house of God he said see it was God's plan and so to hear the prophets in the bible it's just I I hope you'll catch us but the prophets saying thousands of years in advance you know there was prophets in the bible they've seen our cars on the road you know that amen they did they seen the Chariots of Fire with lightning coming out the front of them and going without horses and they were prophesied on the Bible like three thousand years before cars came on the road can you imagine the the the the prophet mind living in a horse and buggy in Stone Age seeing cars going down the road 100 kilometers an hour what's lightning coming out the front of them and steering without a horse no wonder the prophet said that I was troubled in my head hello he's like whoa but God gave that to Prophets now watch this God gave something else to a prophet and that's second Timothy 3. now we know that all scripture is good for our our all scriptures good for our spiritual life and all scriptures line upon line precept upon precepts amen we believe if it's in the Bible it's part of God and it's for our growth and our good and so is this one second Timothy 3 verse 1 and know this also that in the last days that perilous times shall come here's a prophet they're seeing thousands of years in advance and he's seen the family of God sitting in church and he's seen everyone's mind watches let me ask you this did our prophet in our day know the thoughts and and of the heart and the mind sure he did yes sir he did so is it just feasible to think that the prophets in the old time Testament knew the thoughts and hearts of the Mind thank you so the prophets three thousand years ago thousands and thousands of years ago they've seen us sitting here in Wyoming and they seen your mind and they seen the god that you had in your mind they said it here read in the scriptures the perilous times will come for men shall be lovers of their own selves coveyists boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents see you thought you could raise your kids without God's help takes a holy ghost to raise kids thankful unthankful sorry and Unholy now I broke down some of these words and got definitions unnatural affection you know what that means sink of Canada that'll take care of that you know Canada we read scripture just a few weeks ago that we could be it's against the law so you can actually be put in prison for five years If You Preach counsel or even as a parent try to talk against what laws that Canada has brought in and then a wonderful country like Uganda last week put in exactly the complete opposite laws the difference black is from the white that it was capital punishment if you were participating in that lifestyle or life in jail no natural affection truce Bakers false accusers incompetent Ferris despisers of those that do good God help us that see watch us that is a spirit in the end day and you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're inside of you you don't have that because you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that spirit is around you and it's brushing you and you have to keep you have the prophet said we were our own Creator and you create the baptism of the Holy Ghost around yourself to push the the thing of not losing natural affection amen God help us despisers those that are good you know how come in the message or in the Christian well I'm going to say the message I'm going to say the message if any one of you here try to do something for Christ you'll have 10 people come against you that's not even those people it's a spirit it's a spirit and anointing on those people they say oh well what do you think you're doing you're trying to be a big show off it might be costing you thousands of dollars days of your time and dedication and prayer and fastly hey they said that about our prophet he went to the cave for days prayed and fasted and was dedicated because God had anointed him to bring a message for an end time bride a big shot he was in a cave amen you see well that shouldn't be no it's the anointing you need to recognize we're in the last time man it's going home time despisers of those that do good wow why wouldn't you bless somebody that does good you might not agree you might not understand you might say I can't do that but bless them Jesus saying the Bible he said if they're if they're if they're fighting for if they're on our side that means they're not against us oh but they're not in our camp oh but they don't sit in my pew oh but they don't go to the oh but then then then we have individual kingdoms God help us God help us amen Hallelujah you know watch this this is how it is our Prophet said that that that you should choose and pray and fast over your home Church the Bible teaches us to know them a labor among you a really Holy Ghost filled Pastor you can go anywhere to church you want we because it's not my church it's not anybody's church it's Christ Church it's God's church it's God's people if you can grow better under somebody else's Ministry praise God pray for me that I'll get to that stature too we have to realize this it's not a personal competition it's not who brings the most brownies every Sunday but it's not who's the best speaker every Sunday some of God's ministers that were the worst ministers in the world God called amen they couldn't speak good they couldn't they didn't know look at Dwight Moody he's eight millions of people and he couldn't even talk he spit most of the time Dwight Moody see but we're flashed but we're not flesh but we war against flesh we war against the spirits of Flesh and we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and our soul and and but we have a white dog and a black and you'll have that white dog and a black dog until you leave this world but you will be triumphant and you will prove to Satan that the second Eve the the bride in this last day she'll never bow Hallelujah to the spirit of the age amen I I'm going to slow down someday and I have the the meanings of some of these words you can look into natural affection and we already said one possibility that it is one on one possibility one thing that it is and you know just just think of Canada and you'll understand what I mean an Abomination to God the most disgusting vile taste in God's mouth an abomination amen but that's the same Abomination it is for a man or woman to put on the opposite person's garment it's the same word used for op same sex as it is for opposite clothes it's disgust and vomit and puke in God's mouth amen God help us natural affection I have a quote here and and you know not that I'm just on to that forgive me but you see natural affections and I'm not preaching I'm preaching on Spirits you understand preaching on Spirits I'm not telling anybody when they should do anything ask God but another thing is not to affection is the world is fastly realizing that nobody's getting married and nobody's having children do you know the prophet said that motherhood would be lot our Prophet said that motherhood would be lost in the end days the people would choose to have a puppy dog or a kitty cat nothing wrong with them individually instead of having a baby what changed the figure of my body nope now watch this I'm not I couldn't preach this everywhere but I can preach it here a prophet said things really strong we're really strong you know the prophet said that the problems of the world was they give women to vote you know what our Prophet said that the country that's that's going to knock you out stocks everybody got to see butter that our country should have never give women driver's license and he also said that if the woman was out of the kitchen now I'm talking about mothers now there's people here that their kids are grown like Patty's kids are complete adults for our kids are complete adults and only one home but whoever invented daycare for message believe in mothers of minor status in a homosexual world I'll just tell you what it's of the devil don't worry I'm not looking for a lot of invitations our Prophet said and I'm preaching faster I had the quote right here in front of me that parents should always pray for your daughters to marry Young you know why you're shocked because of the spirit that's in the age it's called the end time now I'm going to clarify I'm going to be perfectly balanced he said I'm not talking about children getting married but he also said that my mama was 15 when I was born at born and my daddy was 18. that means she was married when she was 14. if you do the math and he said we were all kids and grew together and it was good oh let's try preaching that in a career based Church where you have doctors and lawyers coming out of daughters of message believers anything sinful about being a doctor lawyer no but the Bible said natural affection it is not natural for you not to desire a mate of the opposite sex period that's natural so anything that is not natural okay let me rephrase that so anything that's not natural and the way of blgb2 or a career woman or you don't even desire or you might even preach against is an abomination is an Abomination because it is just natural for a person of a not now now listen the Bible says you will never marry a non-believer you in the Bible God never even forgive Israel for it ever they're in hell for it two cannot be equally unequally yoked together so I'm not talking about making something happen and you need prayerful fasting dedication and believe me you want your rib like I'm not talking about just flying off the handle but I'm talking when you lose the desire huh natural desire I have no desire no desire who who orchestrated marriage in the Bible God Christ Jesus so if you're 45 and you're just getting out of college you're what the prophet seen two thousand years ago ouch I hope some ministers don't listen to this there is nothing more beautiful watch this when the Bible talks about in Ephesians about husbands leave your husbands leave your mom and dad and cleave to your wife and the two shall be twang one flesh and and and he's and what's and what's Paul say what's Paul say what's Paul say and he says and this is a great mystery oh you want to believe is a great mystery it's a great but I speak considering Christ in the church now if that mystery that's great is messed up in flesh you know where I'm going is probably messed up in the spirit and that's why our Prophet said the greatest problem the church is everybody has a different idea how in the world that our God loved us so much you think it was some small thing that you know what you know and I don't mean what I've taught you I don't mean that once back I mean what God by Revelation gave you by predestination and your eyes are just the scales just fall off your eyes and you're just like wow I see God coming like like look oh hello Church Church we've lost the sincerity and the first love and you're not recognizing there's people Jesus said that no man can have it unless my father give it to me drawn the greatest event of your life was feeling the pull and when you felt the pull you should just scream and holler and jump and dance and lose your mind because I have Woods right in my immediate blood family you can look them straight in the eye brother Matt and lay it right out in English where anybody with the brain could understand and they'd look at you like a cow looking at a new game and our Prophet said ourself that there were things in Jesus Christ that you did not even need a revelation prayer and one of them was sick and see if you just read the Bible just in black and white and you can have a fifth grade education or a second grade I failed grade one so you don't have to be brilliant and you just read it it'll tell you exactly what happened God has got their eyes looking right at it looking right and the Bible says the blind's lead in The Blind and they both fall into ditch and you can see what's in this you can see this anointing the spirit that's in the world and it's trying to make the women men and the men pussycat woman and it is a perversion and it is from the bottomless pit of Lucifer hell and you need to run as far away from that devil is the the East is from the West it is puke disgusting and vomit to God that's exactly why Satan is God we are plagued with it in this country like a plague of leprosy it's worse than covet you'd have to be hundreds of feet away from me it's catching like fever fire God help us we can't run from this we need to understand it but it's what the prophets seen God showed it to the prophets and the prophets wrote it down for your benefit for my benefit and he said but but why when you get over there and the bride of Christ from all the other ages to come and you walk in and they don't you walk in from the last days and you meet Paul and John and that you imagine Matt when you beat them and they say you me to tell me that you survived the anointing that was on this age how in the world did you ever make now they're already there and they'll watch this our Prophet said that our Prophet said that I could bring up the cool fruit they're already there and they already know how awesome God is they're already in that dimension and they're saying whoa we we didn't live in that age but we just seen it and we're here and we know what God's like and we're just like oh heart of you and God said to himself he's knowing that we're part of him he said I must shorten the days because I'm part of him because I can't lose what's part of me oh what he loved you that much and see people that fight a prophet are so blind and ridiculous a prophet was telling you the future he was telling you what God seen you as amen not your affection see how it's anointed amen wow Traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God that's Hollywood right there and that's professional sports right there completely of the devil that's the only reason that was made was to put your emphasis off of the disastrous job the government's doing so you can give all your money to professional sports and they'll pay the tax to the government Annie what business does any message I'm sorry this is this is Doctrine so there might be a lot less people here next Sunday brother Mike but can you tell me any business that a message believing holy ghost-filled person because God and go pay fifty dollars to take their binoculars and sit on Earth being an oxygen tent because you could die you're so high in the air to watch somebody that's having Motel sex think about it professional sports players you say well how do you know that brother did please we're in a mixed audience I don't want to be graphic there's professional sports players the things came out and people said they wondered how they had enough strength to tie their sneakers that's disgusting but I'm trying to and message Holy Ghost filled people go and let's watch that person and they could give that money to the mission field where the five-fold ministry would go save one Soul that's worth ten thousand worlds oh but bless God I deserve the holiday huh Spirits it's spirits lovers of pleasure spirits be careful how you buy your movies you're paying tithes to Lucifer oh bless God he loves them I used to tell my kids when we went by The Beer Store you know we used to cross at the ferry in a Marine City in Sombra you know and they would bring a feed card out with liquor a teacher like how can you drink that much whoa like I'm talking like a dozen kegs oh spirits lovers of pleasure lover is a pleasure more than lovers of God amen having a form of godliness you know I I watch this I told you this in the thing and this paragraph I challenge you if you got the message up that was one of the greatest things that was ever created in the message ranks God Bless the people that worked on that where you can go in the Bible and pull up every scripture and see every single time our Prophet mentioned that exact verse that was the greatest invention praise God I'd give my right arm for that amen the prophet and a lot of these verses said over a hundred comments per verse but here in this one here saying Heaven a form of godliness the Divine the power thereof many people would come to the prophet and say now these people that do these things that are pleasure like lovers of pleasure and all these things well they're the Communists because during the time of threat or Prophet everybody was scared of Russia they were a circle power and he said no no no no no no no no no no no every time dozens of times our Prophet said no no no no these are not communist people don't fear communists they're a tool in the hand of God Hallelujah don't fear Communists he said these are people that look like believers but they're make-believers but they look exactly the same I bet God help us for this is a sword that they which are creeping to houses and Lead captive silly will and women ladies with sins and Lead away in diverse lusts ever learning the message but never able to come to the understanding of the Gospel of the truth oh there's people that could quote every quote they just make you look silly but they're not sitting under the fivefold ministry they don't have a home Church they don't have a pastor that's part of the message they don't believe in paying tithes and offerings that's part of the Bible and the message but they are ever learning but they're never able to come to the understanding in the gospel of the truth God help us here let me read some quotes here that's all right he said the Bible said in the last days it would be heading High money and lovers of pleasure truce Bakers false accusers so-called Christianity they said there that you are he said as they withstood oh I've already read this as it withstood Moses amen help us Jesus here we mentioned these quotes and I'm going to just highlight them I've already mentioned them and wow God help us this is beautiful and this is what is going to happen in the last days here in Jehovah Jireh 64. the prophet said he said God promised to appear in the last days so Satan's come in like a fly literally hell is coming up in our country amen hell is coming up but the but God has brought up a standard against them and all you got to do is hold fast to it and you'll be saved amen for me and my house I believe he said God promised in the last days that he would appear again in the last days and the form of human flesh again now this is a direct quote I'm not adding one word in your flesh God is appearing in your flesh today and you're a peculiar people and you're to to repel and to your atmosphere of the Holy Ghost is pushing back The Wiles of the devil amen you you got the whole armor of God on it like the Bible talks about to push back the spirits that are trying to engulf your family golf the cherish and golf Womanhood and go up your daughterhood motherhood fatherhood Baron husbandhood it's all coming in they talked about the the family altars the problem we have in the church is bring the family altar in the home or to teach your kids how to pray read them the Bible tell them the family stories mothers it's your duty to homeschool your kids homeschooling wasn't around when Jesus was born or or I mean I mean homeschooling was I mean it wasn't public schooling you know you know what public schooling come out you can Google it public schooling come out when the like the Catholic Church said he said give me your children until you're seven and I'll have them forever and the government to demoralize God's family God's family not the not the world God's family the government come out with it made it High Cost of Living so the wife had to leave the house and because the wife left the house you had to send your kids to public school and they could indoctrinate your kids with nothing less than the devil themself and now because the wife's out from underneath the headship of the husband and God the devil created shift work they are just passing blurs in the day and you think oh bless God he's really blessed me with this job it might have been Lucifer that blessed you with that job dude to break down the family altar can you can you explain to me how a husband and wife working on different shifts and the kids in public school when you're going to have family author excuse me and you were when yep God give you children you know when when the prophet would dedicate your children back to God and trusted those kids unto you for you to teach not the government and praise God that we that's one Freedom we still have is coming to church and the next one is we have complete freedom to keep your kids home and teach them a parent has the right to teach his kids the doctrines they believe so you can homeschool your kids teaching them the message and the word of God and the life story of the prophet and you choose by choice to send them to Lucifer huh that's that's insanity I've said here and and this is a radical thing to say but if you could send your kids to public school then I could watch pornography because that's exactly what they're getting in school and they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and don't think for one minute I believe in that garbage hello hello somebody oh I think I thought I was fighting that battle alone amen I don't think these quotes are read very often Flash and red light of his coming he said I can hear some of you sisters saying well maybe it's right present uh and you say oh I obey my husband I make him obey me he said but there is where you're wrong you stay home uh chastened he said I don't care and and then the person replies he said but I don't care what the Bible says it says about it you leave you leave me alone this is a wife talking to her husband amen listen sister it wasn't in the back Dark Ages that voice today he said and again they say I'm a modern woman I live in America I have a right to choose yeah you have a right to choose you could find yourself right in hell well that's no more than you live in a Hog Pen I wouldn't make a whole lot of difference here's the prophet Calling America a Hog Pen the sister thought it was a privilege to live in America because she had the right to choose she had a right to be a woman and the prophet called that hopping it wouldn't make one bit of difference to God where you lived you know Jared come down last Sunday night and he said when did they pass these laws where you could be in jail we're posting this online the government could watch our video they could come and arrest me and put me in jail for online you say and I know you'd say and I appreciate it he'd say well you know you're not Char you know you're not uh actually put there yet and that can you imagine hiring a lawyer at like 200 an hour to fight you to keep you out of jail for five years do you know that there's 69 countries in the world that that's illegal and 39 of them are in Africa Jared come down last Sunday he said I never thought I'd move to Africa but maybe it's looking better all the time here the prophet said it won't make one bit of difference to God where you live and you men that'll let your wife do that you're no longer a son of God no you kind of fell to Sodom that's right you let the women boss you around wow see it's it's not people it's the spirits man we're not against women it's spirits amen let me finish this quote I said that God what God promised in the last days to return again in human flesh and that's in your flesh like he did in the days of Sodom just like in the days of Sodom when God's going to come back again as in the days of Sodom God which was Christ manifested in flesh he's now what's in his church his bride and see they're coming together and it's uniting time in the churches uniting the church is uniting and the nations are uniting the governments are uniting and the bride in crisis United see it's uniting time that's why the U.N is getting stronger that's why NATO's getting stronger but the Bride of the true bride of Christ is getting stronger man it's going home time God the prophet said that God made a body and came and seen Abraham he just threw a guy at the body and Three Angels Came to Abraham but God was one of them and Abraham recognized God and said my Lord and two went to Sodom and today God has made a body and he's tabernacled in it and it's called his bride amen amen Amen Let me just lay this down and next Sunday we're maybe going to talk some on children and different things and I got multiple things where you know uh just just really scriptural things amen he said what happens here out of marriage he said here's another place in the Bible he said out of marriage goes the vows obey he said the meaning of obey means a keeper at home chasing of good works he said and she'll laugh at your face and go on and goes to the power plant or to somebody's office my husband and oh I doubt that he said if if these forces today such a disgrace to put women in these jobs he mentions police force and different things amen and then the Bible says that she's supposed to stay home and be chastened and a keeper at home now you know this is the truth a huge part of the message I'm preaching that a huge part but that's part of the message this is a 6306-23 quote flashing red light if it's coming this is after the seals this is the prophet We Believe but we don't read this quote because you fell into the Trap of buying two cars in a fancy house and so you both work I let the devil raise your kids and you say well I put the token over my kids you're in disobedient to what's a prophet taught right here amen but she keeps watch us but she keeps her boss's books and yours too see yes ain't that so fuzzy what kind of a man would send their wives their little cute Queen to rub up against some other man I ain't talking about good women now he said I'm not throwing like this to you Goodwin Godly women he said he said I'm talking about what you find one in this age he said they won't listen to the word he said let's keep the Bible let's keep it in your Bible he said they won't listen to the word keep this is what they tell the prophet they said you keep your Bible and preach it to yourself we don't want to hear that obey stuff yeah and you wonder why because they don't want the obey stuff you wonder why the church is the one because people won't sit on they don't want nobody wants to obey nobody oh bless God we're all obeying God but nobody's obeying anybody wives aren't obeying their husbands but they're but they're still believers their husbands aren't obeying the fivefold ministry but they're still believers and the five-fold ministry and obeying God and they think they're still message preachers ouch and they're all deceived amen but see children this is a spirit that's the age I mean see well Dan why are you preaching this I'm not affecting that well maybe next Sunday I'll get on to breaks and kids or amen having a good name and a good testimony in the community amen these are all parts of the scripture amen but I believe in predestination and I believe that the seals are open and I believe the Bible is a new book in that but we've heard that thousands of times and it's good believe me I love it but we need some teaching on this he said before I go back he said 26 women drivers almost caused me to get killed and he said he said we kept count of it and he said they made a mistake when they gave her a driver's license they put her out boating and they put her out in these Public Works he said then you women get out of the kitchen you're out of your place he said whether she's preaching the gospel or what's the difference in a woman preaching the gospel or a woman being a policeman if she's out of her place they're both wrong but see we'd like to point fingers at the denomination but we don't want to point them out ourselves amen he said man man was this is what he says here this is this is another quote he said man was not made for woman but woman was made for the man man was not the byproduct of the woman but the woman the byproduct of the men and he said let the Holy Spirit keep its sweetness through and make you a different person and you'll believe it the Bible said so now if you doubt this then read First Corinthians 11 chapter 11 and then you'll go out and find out if it's not the truth find out if it's not the truth in other scriptures like Isaiah 6 Isaiah 5 and O Mine and all through the scriptures in Colossians and Galatians where Paul was saying to obey your husbands and just like that no but he's a disgrace to mankind to let alone let alone the kingdom of God that will let you do such a thing because he fears you talking about the husband the husband fears his wife more than he fears God and you'll kick him out and he don't care if God kicks him out but he don't want his wife to kick him out that's right I'm not scolding you you women are men I'm only warning you thus saith the Lord get right with God I believe that would be a good quote to read don't you think thus saith the Lord get right with God wow but until you're born of the spirit of God in that life and that life of the devil Still Remains in you he's telling you you're not even a believer until you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said neither male nor female is accepted or dispelled he said we're all one in the sight of God when it comes to this amen your heart is the womb and you know what I'm speaking of men and women your heart is the womb and the womb is where it holds the seed the seed of the Gospel and now what's happened is the heart is the womb and Faith cometh by an open ear that is not sealed by theology Faith cometh by hearing to hear and the word comes into the mind and you make your mind up a boat the word God's given you a free moral agent that you have the right to decide if you'll be affected by the spirits of the age amen God help us amen Proverbs 22 and we're going to close here shortly here Proverbs 22 1 says a good name think of this in a spiritual life all have a spiritual and physical type a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold that's not you can put that in a good name in the community do you know the prophet when they were making deacons that they would go out and check in the community whether the person that they were going to make a deacon in the Tabernacle had a testimony that was worthy of what he said if you have a bill you should pay it if you have a dirty language you need to scrape it up amen it's a testimony experience amen God help us Amen Let me I'm I'm winding this down I mean I want to close with this he bring and that is another quote here and as he's bringing the groom and bride and they come forth because it's because you're part of him and it can only be the manifestations of the full Revelations of the word of God see if we're anything diff like what's John 1 was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was exactly God and then you dropped to verse 13 it says and the word became flesh and daught Among Us and today you're that flesh but you're also that word and but are we reading the word but then that's part of you and if it's not part of you then you ain't part of him it's just not the one part that God predestinated you it's all this part amen and if it does something different than the groom then it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his flow and life of his life and power of his power she is him so if you're living if this word steps on your toe then you're not you're not even a part of him yet because your thought pattern and everything characteristics exactly Christ which is the word which is all the word and the word didn't change because we're living in the 20th century amen God help us men and women are one and woman was taken from his side and she was taken she had taken a spirit and that was a feminine Spirit from him and the flesh is from his side made both the mechanics and the Dynamics of his wife and the spirit of him and the Flesh of him put together made the mechanics and the Dynamics in the church that's why in so many cases in so many places there's something missing because it's not Unified it's not coming together because it's under another spirit and that's intentional by the devil's amen amen God help us man let me close with this thought there's something for the parents to chew on amen and let me tell you this our Prophet said this and I don't have this exact quote right in front of me but I I have it and I can get it to you he said never look to me my life is an example because I have so many mistakes in my life I don't say that to to discredit the prophet at all but he's saying I I was human and so now I'd like to say the same thing now you're going to say when I preach and say but Dale I remember you didn't do that my kids will say that see Satan will remind that to you but I was just human so I made mistakes too but now I can look back at my mistakes and say whoo if I could correct you and you could go more straight instead of curving like I did that's what the prophet did amen so when I tell you this the first thing the Satan is going to tell especially my kids is well you sure never lived that and then see then you can't get nothing out of it you know we should never call each other names have spirits we should never I'm guilty of this I've repented you should never call your kids things that they are not they might do dumb things but they're not done and you should not say that they're dumb and they got it from you because you're dumb because those are spirits and they'll grab onto that spirit and they'll accept that spirit and they'll be exactly what they you expect of them so if you say they're dumb and they came from you and you're dumb well they ex they know that to please you they must be dumb here's some short parent advice and we might touch on this again he said quit yelling at your kids before they go to bed and expect them to sleep well it's a spirit did I yell at my kids well I've already repented so you can't remember that because you have the same characteristics as Christ so it's in the sea of forgetfulness so if you're remembering it then you know who praise God for that sea it's awful Big Brother Matt where I live amen I keep throwing stuff in it the water keeps coming out brother Matt quit yelling at your kids in the morning right after they wake up and expect them to do well in school that day watch this talking about things that we say and call he said you know and I say this I say you know I failed grade one and I was I I was actually in school I'm sure my teachers wish that I would have died or something because I was a thorn into not that I wasn't bad I just was I just didn't know nothing except math I could do anything math but anything else and then God turned me how to read when he called me to preach he didn't teach me that school I just barely sleep through I can remember when I went left Elementary School and went to high school and I filled out for a four-year course a general course and my principal went up to the high school and he said are you kidding that kid's they said if he gets through two years of high school you'll be lucky they put me in the course in high school that was me the special ed if they can't do it with your hands you can't do it at all I'm telling you the truth and I was there about one month in this kid why are you in this course he said you're perfectly a four-year person huh he said you set the tone for your children now watch this we set the tone for our home and a strong home sets a tone for this church what you bring from your home is how this church is huh this is this is the truth you set the tone for your child's voice and what they'll always remember in their head is your voice God set the tone in our day by a prophet and he showed us what real Christianity was and humility I'll just tell you what brother Branham was a Christian period he said what they'll always remember in their head and you become their inner voice now watch this don't you think spiritual the prophet through God became the Inner Voice of Truth in our day hello he sure did you can you can you should listen to The Prophet at home and you should read the message and I do and you should have the prophet play by your bad side or in the kitchen while you're washing the dishes and you hate doing them maybe you hate washing the dishes but you like listening to the prophet and it'll go better what you hate you sat on the atmosphere he said you become the inner voice just think of how God's voice in this day was the prophets you become the inner voice to your children don't become their inner critics you know I can preach this part very plainly I struggled in school but my my home was a backbone when I come home I was a human I was the son of God I was the son of Iliad Helen I was no less than that but when I went to school I was see how if my mom and dad would have treated me like I was treated at school I'd never be standing here today because I'd have so many complexes I'd probably be in a rubber room right now bouncing my head around they sent me from school in grade two when I failed grade one to learn how to talk because I couldn't speak properly I'm telling you this because you might portray the same thing to your kids don't do it yeah you know Dory was total one of the smartest men in the world that they sent him home from school and you remember who that was Albert Einstein and the teacher came to his parents they sent a letter home with him just like David sent the the the the the the the the the suicide letter with the with uh helped me out with the soldier you know to kiss Mariah because he wanted to take his wife amen and he sent the letter home with Einstein and his mom opened the letter in front of the little boy your parents need to listen to this and the teacher told the the mother on the letter that the son was carrying his own his own destiny he said your son he's completely no good for nothing you know like hope he stands in front of a train uh he can't survive in this classroom and he's going to have to this is true story completely true you're not believing me I could tell and the sun's watching there watching his mom you just let her great big old crocodile tears biggest barrels are coming down her face my son says oh what's the letter saying mom and you know sometimes in the Bible it was all right to lie I know you almost fell off your chair but God never ever rebuked people that lied in the Bible like Abraham when it was his uh was it was she said it was her sister you know Abraham would have killed the other guy if he wanted to come back and ask Abraham for permission it was Abraham that died I don't even understand that myself I'm not portraying lice but the mother the son asked the mother said what's the letter say Matt this is a true story have you ever heard it before it's a completely true story and the mom said this letter says that you are so brilliant and so amazing and so Advanced and education that you are beyond the classroom's ability and you're going to have to move the classroom because you're smarter than everybody and he became what his mother said by a lie he said don't become their inner critic Speak Life speak love speak bravery speak kindness now think spiritual think of each other speak hope speak wisdom speak truth and most of all your brothers and sisters in the church most of all listen just listen wow listen speak to life we're all one in Christ speak bravery you'll make it you're a part of him speak kindness God made you perfect from the beginning amen speak hope it's almost over amen speak wisdom you got the best thing in the world ever had and the truth is it's no less than Jehovah God a hundred percent you ain't leaving this and finding anything there ain't nothing to leave but stand God help us pleasing amen and really think of those words you know and I think of them because me and Luanne are making some decisions we pray that you'll remember us in prayer this week or that we're looking at maybe getting a vehicle and we'll probably know this week if we buy the property in Uganda we really want God to know it's God we really really do for sure God knows my heart Better Than I Know My Own Heart I just pray that God will just blast the doors wide open or throw a semi in front of me one or the other amen Hallelujah God help us God help me God help me God help us our our life our testimony brother Brown said he said live me a message Don't Preach me it's very easy to say I'll be a good person but if you walk behind somebody and you say no no that's a good person there's a Godly Man I desire to be that sometime sometime way down the road Maybe just sometime God help me please let me let everything that I did be pleased using [Music] help us Lord Jesus [Music] Mercy be pleasing [Music] [Music] yes Lord God help me Lord Jesus pray [Music] [Music] everything Lord God every season [Music] short testimony we went uh Friday to Kitchener to to have fellowship with some pastors and uh a break like him on in our van on the way so I called the mechanic and he said well just put a little brake fluid in it should be all right of course I didn't want to miss the fellowship with my brothers and we we did have meat in our vehicle for other people so we sit beside the road it'd be kind of nasty and and uh so we got the kitchen and we're coming home and our brake light came back on again and so Luanne went to work on Saturday to watch the old sister lady friend and so I went out and I put more brake fluid in it and Luanne drove home Saturday night with zero breaks or close to zero breaks called and she said honey I have got no breaks you can pick me up and break I was thankful that that was the 401. two hours from home there's a little shorter walk from brigdon than it is from Kitchener you know God cares about his children that totally cares and something else that we we are praying about is foreign if this property is to be purchased by us in Uganda I believe I will have to go there to take some money and sign my name and so I'm looking for a brother that would help me find my airplane oh so it'd be just a short trip but we'd probably be gone one Sunday just leave on a Monday or Tuesday and come home on a Monday or Tuesday I'm not I I don't like going anywhere alone I I take my honey with me everywhere but if somebody wants to see Leo's church for five days and have a rocket trip we pray that we're supposed to get the land and you could come with me God bless thank you foreign
