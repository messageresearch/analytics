thank you doing such a good job I sure appreciate the opportunity to be with you this morning and and I count it an honor and a privilege uh to be here among you um it's certainly something that I don't take for granted uh when I get invited somewhere to to speak uh I fully aware of who who I'm talking to as a a called and chosen people and um you know we stand we stand behind a a pull pit and we are simply just fall Fallen vessels were you know there's nothing special about us you know and U I always come with the awareness of who I am and who I'm speaking to and we believe that we're God's people a chosen generation and um and so doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter you know how young you are how old you are each one of you is special each one of you is unique called to live in this day and age and um and so it's an honor and a privilege because I'm I'm here speaking to God's chosen people a royal seed amen let's just bow our heads father thank you for this opportunity Lord to gather together to to just see the the faces of your people and bring our licks of fire together and Lord we we worship you and we've praised you and and now Lord we would just turn our eyes to your word and I pray father that that you would if if there's anything that I've done Lord if anything that would offend you I pray that you would forgive me Lord and I pray Lord that you would use this Fallen vessel to speak to your people in a powerful way may lives be touched May lives be changed from glory to glory we pray bless us now bless each one the musicians and the song leader and those behind the the camera and the tech technical things Lord thank you for each one bless them in their Ministries in Jesus Christ's name amen blessed be his wonderful name if you have your Bibles and would like to turn with me we're going to turn to the uh book of First Corinthians and uh I I don't normally title my sermons I always feel like uh uh you know if I title something is just it's just it never seems to flow well for me but I I I if I would title this I would title it a manifested voice and um uh just pray that you bear with me as I lay a little bit of a foundation we were we were talking last night and having fellowship and I thought it was it was interesting you know as brother Dale and brother Carson were talking of course I just sit there listen to my elders I don't have a whole lot to say but they just preached my sermon back and forth to one another and they you know what one what one didn't say the other one would and then he would say something I'm just sitting there man that's everything I want to preach and and I felt like I should be taking notes you know so I would I would have something and and um and so I was like at the end of it I was like well I don't need to preach you all obviously you're all on track and and uh uh so I was up all night just awake trying to think you know what I Lord give me a sermon so give me something to to speak to your people and so you know I just have just a couple little thoughts this morning and uh just pray it'll be a blessing to you 1 Corinthians uh chapter 14 we're going to just read a couple verses here it says but now Brethren if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by Revelation by knowledge by prophesying or by teaching even things without life whether flute or harp when they make a sound unless they make a distinction in the sounds how will it be known what is piped or played for if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound who will prepare for battle so likewise you unless you utter by the Tongue words easy to understand how will it be known what is spoken for you will be speaking into the air there are it may be so many kinds of languages in the world and none of them is without significance ific now turn with me one more one more time to the book of Galatians in Chapter 2 and we'll read one more scripture and this will be the kind of the the foundation of of what I have on my heart this morning Galatians Chapter 2 and verse2 says I have been crucified with Christ it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live the which I now live In the Flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me may the Lord just bless the his words you all may be seated this morning lay a little bit of a foundation here this morning and and uh I want to capitalize on this this thought that that the Apostle Paul gave us here that the life which we now live we live by faith in the son of God amen and faith faith comes by what by hearing right and hearing of the word of God and and faith is a gift of God not of yourself lest any man should boast and we are we are called uh to this day to this hour that we have heard a voice speaking to us and there are many voices in this world Paul says that that that they they all have a significance you know and many and people speak and and and nothing is is without meaning and so if if you've traveled if you've go to different places and I I think you know brother brandom talked about it how uh when he was in Africa and he would be ministering you know and there'd be 10 15 different interpreters and each one of them would make a little different sound you know and it meant something and he would he would say God bless you and then you know somebody would make clicking sounds with their tongue and this this translator would you know speak this language and this one and every every voice has the significance every sound has a significance and um that you know even when we're praying it says that often times the spirit within us groaneth making intercession even that groaning sound is is is a voice that has a meaning to God you may not understand it you may not even know it realize it you're just in your in yourself in prayer and and and and just groaning and you don't even have the words and you just and you just groan in in your spirit and that still has a meaning it still has utter is not without significance amen and so I this morning what I would like to to suggest to you and I I believe that I'll be able to prove it by the scripture is that our lives are a voice that our lives are a voice not not just the words that we speak but the very life that we live is a voice in this generation amen and if you would go and if we had time uh you know we could take a service and and we could talk about how God uses words and and I think it's very interesting that the words voice that the spoken voice the spoken word and light as in God is light God is truth those those two words are inextricably linked and the root words of them are the same amen so voice and light come from the same root words now I I building a foundation so stick with me here and so we we all I look at you you know we come from different places I I'm from the states we have people here from Africa we have people uh you know from different parts of Canada we're all from different parts of the world and we we have uh uh friends listening online right now perhaps or we'll listen in the future and and it's interesting you know that that that we can tell where people are from you know we we look at one another and many times you know you can just tell you don't have to hear somebody speak but you can tell by the way that they're dressed you can tell by their mannerisms and how they conduct themselves that they're from a certain place you know here in the states we we not or in in Canada too we we nod our head yes you know but if you go to India and people are nodding to say yes they they do this they go side decide and so if you see somebody doing that it's a good chance that you well they're from India they're not shaking their head no they're they're saying yeah they agree with you and you're talking to them and they'll be yeah like and the first couple times I seen I was like what on Earth why are they doing that you know and they're just sitting there you know agreeing with you just like you would nod in a conversation oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's very interesting we would nod they're they're sitting there yeah yeah yeah that's interesting so you know the things that we do they say a lot about where we're from they tell us you know it's in America it's very easy to distinguish somebody from Texas versus somebody from New York and you know people from Texas dress just a little a little bit differently more than likely they're going to have cowboy boots on and a cowboy hat you know and and um people from New York well they're just they're just rude and and oh my goodness help us Lord I nothing against New Yorkers but people are different you know people are different where they're from you know we each uh we each have a different culture that we grow up in and so we we are products of that in many ways and how we conduct ourselves and and it's not that not their words it's not their their their language that tells you all often times where a person is from but it is how they conduct themselves amen are are you with me all right all right very good and so I I'm reminded of a story of there was a there was a man from America and he was visiting France and and uh he was walking down the street in Paris you know and he and he uh was wondering about some directions and so in perfect French he stopped a fellow pedestrian and he excuse him M and the and the the the the Frenchman was like oh you're American I can tell if you're looking for McDonald's it's over this way you and he says you know but I have to warn you the uh the sizes are not big like they are in America you know and he's like well how did you know I'm American and the the man just was like looked him up and down he says go on you know how you're addressed you know and then he goes down the street and he and he he stops another person and you know says in French excuse him and there and it's a woman and she she starts uh talking to him he's like well how do you know I'm American and she said she just looks at him and how you're dressed of course and and he says but I'm not dressed any different than you all and she's like well there's no need to attack me you because they they they know their fashion I guess over there but but you know the point being is is is that you can go someplace and how you're dressed is it tells where you're from it tells a story how you conduct yourself um I I think of in in we were my family and I were talking about this here recently around the dinner table how uh you see this this principle in the Bible where uh the in the Book of Judges there was a battle between the tribes and and they were fighting and it came to a point and the the um gileadites they were controlling in a river crossing and and so the enemy came in and as they would come to the river crossing one by one you know trying to escape the battle uh they would ask them to you know hey are are are you are you with us or are are you part of the enemy you know because they were all dressed the same they looked the same they they had the same mannerisms but then it came down to whether or not they could pronounce a word correctly and if they couldn't pronounce the word shth because they couldn't pronounce the sh sound they knew they were of the enemy and and so the the the the the the what I'm trying to labor and lay in here is how that that we have a voice everything we do you know it's it's a a voice when Peter when Peter was in in the Judgment Hall of pilate and he was he was talking you know and and the maid said you know I discern by the manner of your speech that you are a galile and it wasn't the words that Peter was saying it was how he spoke how he conducted himself you know by the way that you conduct yourself I can tell that you were with him amen it wasn't the words he was saying it was how he conducted himself and so everything tells us about about you where you're from and who you are and and we have a voice that speaks Way Beyond just the the physical voice each one of us amen and so they tell us of our our Origins and as I said the the scripture says that no voice is without insignificance and so it doesn't matter today who you are it doesn't matter whether you're behind a pull pit or sitting in a Pew and it doesn't matter if you're 10 years old or 90 years old your life has a voice that must be spoken in this day and age you were called to live in this day amen the life which I now live I live by faith in the Son of God see it it isn't it's something that is happening now a voice must go forth a voice must go forth into this day it didn't stop with brother Brandon it didn't stop in 1965 God go we walk in the light as God is in the light amen and so we we each have a voice that that must be spoken in this day it doesn't matter if you're a housewife or a grandmother your voice is just as important as the voice coming behind this pull pit amen and and we're we're called to speak it it it's all of nature must acknowledge what God has said all of nature must confess the word is true it doesn't matter uh you know we we I I think about it that all all of Nature and I was reading this to my children here the other day that the Ravens cry in the Book of Job it says the Ravens when they have a lack of food cry they cry out to God and I was telling did you realize that animals pray WoW animals pray to God and and everything all of creation must acknowledge God all of them even people you know even when they don't realize it they acknowledge God and and you hear people the the most awful evil person you can you can think of at you know at the work side or whatever and they'll be oh God help me oh God this you know and they say it in vain but they're still acknowledging that there is a Creator a god and every knee must bow and every tongue must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and so even the animals you know even them I was telling my children all they they all make sounds they all talk and they communicate and they have you know uh if you you live on a you live you have cows you know like there when you grow a cow up and you know you feed them by hand and they they when they see you coming they they're crying for you they're they acknowledge you that you're a part of the her you got the food and they're they're balling when you you know uh your dogs and your cats they speak to you everything has a voice that speaks amen so and so w un to us if we don't speak W un to us if we don't with our voice with our life acknowledge to the Creator well unto us if we who are privileged to partake of this message and to partake of this this this word if we do not take and express it back out amen so uh in Job chapter 12 it says who among all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this in whose hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind does not the ear test the words and the mouth tastes food and so people I I I take that and people listen to what we're saying but more importantly they're watching our words and their ears are testing it they're they're watching us and they're seeing are you going to live What You Preach are you going to live what you confess cuz you're telling me that you're a Christian you're telling me that you believe a certain way but does your life really match up to what you say and and many times it's it's very strange to me that that people in the world people who are nominal Christians or even unbelievers will have a higher standard of Christianity than what we have for ourselves and they'll tell you well I don't think a Christian would would do that well you're you're probably right a Christian should not do that amen and so they're they're testing what we say we are amen and if you talk to people they're watching your life whether or not you ever testify to them and tell them about Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 if you never speak a word about it they're still testing the the voice that you're uttering with your life to see if it matches what the what is true and they know there's a there's a if they if they are a counterfeit if they are Fallen then they know that there's a real there and they're looking for a real amen we're just we're just living Our Lives brother brandom expressed it often times with the as the principal he was he would gesture to the microphone and he he would say you know this is just a microphone and without it you know it has no life of its own amen and he said but you know like when the voice hits it and the sound comes out out that people can hear it amen and so you know that that's that's what it is is our we're just microphones amen and so when the when the the spirit of God Lives within us and dwells within us it speaks through us to other people it's not us it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth Amen in our faults in our failures and everything that we do is is is still Christ Living Through us an expression that that God is in his bride God is in his people and he's still speaking to a generation today until that last one should come in amen and so you know we're we're mute we don't have anything to say but God speaks through us and he testifies of through us and you may not think that your life is speaking but I would tell you that it is as a Christian you cannot hide it you cannot hide it the idea of you know we sing the little children's song hide your light under a bush oh no I'm going to let it shine you know you could not hide it if you wanted to you cannot hide it even people who walk away from truth and leave this they cannot hide the fact that they were influenced through years and years of sitting under the the the truth of the hour it still affects and influences everything that they do and say they can't get away from it every sermon that they would go to another uh Church a nominal Christian church every sermon that they hear will be filtered through the L of what they learned sitting under the tutelage of a prophet of this day whether they want to acknowledge it or not they cannot Escape what they have been taught we cannot Escape what what God is trying to speak through US amen seasons will come in our lives that will cause us to speak seasons will come we you know where uh you you just live your life every day you know and you're just living and sometimes you know you're just you're just on this steady track you know you're not up you're not up on the mountain you're not down in the valley you know you're just you're just living life and if you're not speaking if you're not preaching God will put circumstances he will surround you with circumstances to cause your life to speak and who knows you know when you go when you go through trials and when you go through tests and you are you are afflicted In the Flesh or you are Afflicted at work and and who knows that that through your life that you may not have come into this world for such a time as this that you your life would not be for one specific purpose one specific instance to talk to One Soul and save them to give one testimony that that would drop a seed and plant it somewhere that somebody would would never have known about Christianity would never known about the message but yet you were there at one specific point in time that could have been the entire purpose of your life in the grand scheme of of things as God planned things out it could have just been for one moment for one moment for one word a word in due season to save somebody's Soul amen we we sometimes we give ourselves so little credit it's so easy I think to get down on ourselves we were talking last night and we were talking about miracles and you know what you expect and what what is a miracle you know is it is it somebody raising up is it a leg regrowing is it this or is it that but and you know our pastor was saying Miracles are every day we see it every day where people are healed and and this happens in circumstances and it should not have been that way but somehow God has has arranged it that miraculous and you can't explain it and and our lives are a miracle who we are you think about it all the millions and billions of people in this world all of them and yet you are sitting here today sitting under the revealed word of this hour hallelujah what percentage of the population are you what percentage are you have better odds you have better odds going to the convenience store and buying a lotto ticket and winning the biggest jackpot in history all by yourself than than being here sitting today in this church you have won the lottery you have won the lottery you know no one has it as good as we have it no one can have the relationship that we have and to the fact that through all your trials through all your life whether you were born into this message or whether you were you know born in you know In the Backwoods somewhere you came through a specific set of circumstances that allowed you to reach today where you are praise God that he would he would reach down and pull us up amen amen a miracle each one of your Miracles amen I I just I I'm amazed sometimes how how we just we get so complacent and so so it's just common to us you know that we can come and we can hear the word of God and it touches us and we're just like oh good you know it's a wonderful Sunday you know a wonderful Wednesday service you know praise God we'll see you next but we are we are literally hearing from the Throne of God this the literal spirit of God is living within you speaking a voice through you amen how powerful is that talk about a miracle that God could come in our circumstances where we were Sinners and unworthy in drugs in prostitution and alcohol in every situation and God could come and pull us up and out of that and cleanse us and change our lives until we speak Words of Life powerful amen the very fact that you've heard of Jesus Christ the very fact that you're here sitting in the message of the hour tells you something it tells you your position in God it tells you who you are in Christ that you are you know it's like sometime so many times you know like we have this fear you know that we're not going to make it we have this fear that we're not worthy somehow and yet here we are here we are we're we we've made it we are in the safest place that you can be in sitting under the revealed word of the hour we we have arrived the bride is making herself ready right now today the bride is saying come Lord Jesus the bride has made herself ready and all we are doing is just waiting for that time from that anointed time that God has said we're healed will come and take us and I don't I don't believe that we need to stop witnessing and I don't believe that that uh uh we have to just uh you know that we're on coasting you know just just we got it on cruise control no we're still in a battle we're still in a fight but we we have arrived right the word of God said that a people would Express the the man and manifest the word of God in this hour and here you are here you are do you see who you are today you're not you're not Dale you're not Luan you're not Jose you're you are a child of God in the last day how powerful is that amen praise the Lord and so you know here we are and every everything that we speak in our lives it comes from this Foundation of of of the recognition that we are the bride of Christ everything that we do comes and is we stand on this foundation and our lives testify of who we are amen and so each of you as I said you have a unique voice none of none of your voices are are are meaningless you know none of your voices are without significant every voice matters amen some of you are the only voice that others will hear you may never preach this a sermon you may never you know bring somebody and baptize them in the water and baptize them in the name of Jes Jesus Christ but your life is a message all unto itself and it's every one of you are important don't ever don't ever let Satan tell you that you're not important don't ever let Satan tell you that that your life doesn't matter that it would be better that you weren't here Heaven Help Us God help us your voice is is you don't know tomorrow what you might speak to somebody that would be the last one you don't know that tomorrow you might you might might just encounter someone in the in the grocery or at the restaurant and that would be the person who would who would be like you know your life is different there's something about you I don't know what it is I can't put my finger on it and and you and you begin to tell them well I I I once was like you but I Heard a Voice it said come to me amen and I can't live your voice you can't live my voice you know I can't be brother Dell I can't be brother Carson I I can't be brother Tim or or Jared I I can only be me I know I can't come and I you know I don't try to uh preach like somebody else or speak like somebody else I can only be me you know some people are are like well brother John's this way or they might think you're that way or whatever and they have these conceptions and ideas but you you have to be yourself because God has designed you he is from the womb he's formed you in every circumstance of your life has brought you to where you are today amen and and so he has purposefully made you he's molded your life into what you are now and we're not what we're we're going to be thank God we're not what we used to be but God can use us where we're at amen you see because it's the life that I now live I live by the faith in the Son of God the life that I now live I'm not you know I can't go back and relive the past it it's I I I can't go back and and change things that I've done I can only I can only live now it's a present day it's a present day message and I think it's it's interesting now that that you know I when I I grew up you know we were my family we were associated with the message and I I I've had this discussion and we were part of uh what's known as the the Latter-Day rain movement and so we put a lot of emphasis on the Apostle rather than a prophet and we acknowledged the church acknowledged brother brandham as a prophet as as a prophet to the last day yes but they minimized his role and more exalted the Apostle and the teachings of of Apostles and I still from a young age I remember the apostles coming through brother ear hotton just a real godly man and and uh brother brandom talked about that movement and how they had such tremendous love divine love and so that's how I grew up and but I remember as we started associating more and more with message things message churches I I remember going to to one place we were somehow we were related but they were a a tape group and so they would just you know you know press press play you know as a press play Church put the tape in and and you just listen you know brother Brandon says stand up we stand up and brother Brandon says sit down we sit down brother Brandon prays we bow our head you know and there there's nothing wrong with listening tapes we need the tapes but you you can't live in that past amen God sent a prophet yes but the message is still continuing on today because brother brandom said the voice of God is in the bride and the scripture says if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sins and so we have to continue walking this isn't just a a a pressed play and it's okay kind of a a message that that things are progressed and now now everything that's been revealed has been revealed the mysteries of God are finished I believe that but God is still revealing himself to us as individuals amen and we're we're still walking it's not done yet it didn't end in 65 amen we can't go back and live uh the the past it's the life that I now live I need a five-fold Ministry I need teachers to teach I need a I need evangelists to stir my soul I need a pastor to to anchor me down when I'm when I'm going through the mud and trials and and I need you know come beside me and help pull the load with me amen we need those people I grew up and I remember so so often we would go down to boy this ain't all my note notes at all but we go down to Jeffersonville uh for Easter services and uh you know you just run into so many different kinds of people you know all the different uh all all of the different fanaticisms that you could think of you know I I encountered them and uh children you know being young we we had very little in the way of filters anyhow and so you know we we heard we heard you know all the fanaticism we heard what people believed and you know Joseph is God or he's you know you know praying to brother brandom you know baptizing in the name of brother brandom and and these different things you know we we rub shoulders with it and it it gave me a bad taste it's like this is a bunch of craziness you know I I I don't want really anything to really do with it you know I went my own way and and then I had to come back and and I had to find the message for myself like we all do and those voices you know that they they were living they with their mouth they were testifying of something and then they Twisted it and they gave a false witness and a false testimony in your life if if you are not careful can give a false witness of what you believe amen because you can say I believe this I believe this but by your actions by their fruit you shall know them amen excuse me the life that I now live I just kind of scanning through my notes there and I I I think many times we fail to acknowledge who we are that we we you know Lord help me to be the bride and none of us brother random said you know I don't know that I am but by faith I believe I am I believe that I will be I don't know but you know what it doesn't even matter if if I should do all of this and I should make all these sacrifices if I should you know go to church and and live my life you know according to what he has said and then if he still would cast me away it would still be worth it it would be nothing less than what I deserve anyway but the grace of God to us as we walk in the light as he is in the light this this life which I now live you know just thinking of that I was thinking about it last night I have a neighbor uh just a he's a real Goofy kind of guy you know he's a little bit older than me he's about he's about ready to retire and he dresses like he is a high schooler I don't know if the if the man owns a pair of pants I really don't I've never seen him in anything but cut off jeans and a and cut off t-shirt and he's 50 some years old he's about ready to retire and I was talking to him one time he was like he's like I I've dressed the same way since I've been in high school and and I I guess that's one way to save money on clothes but um he's stuck living in the past he's stuck living in the past and we're called to live in the now we're called to live today aive and and it's it's interesting you know how people can can get stuck living in the past and let me get somewhere with this but uh you know I was thinking you know like you think about nostal I I like old things I I like to dress oldfashioned I guess you know and and because I think you know I want to dress like a gentlemen you know and I liked I like how people carry themselves and and and everything so I dressed a little bit differently than than modern ministers maybe but um I'm not stuck in the past I like things in in the past I like things I like ideals of the past and I like how people were were more open and and they were uh more uh polite and they were more moral and they had better ethical things and and you know people didn't walk down the street half naked you know back in the past and so it's it's easy to like turn back to the past and like and look at things with a little bit of nostalgia but we can't get stuck there amen let me get somewhere with this we can't get stuck living in the past and and the people you know it's it's funny I think of all the when I when I worked in the factory there was a woman uh she did her she did her makeup like she stepped right out of the 1970s and every day and she she dressed like the 1970s and her makeup was 1970s the music she listened to was 1970s and of course you know you know me I was I was younger then I was I was like maybe 20 years old but I was like she is really stuck in the past you know and and I talked to her when time and she's like no this was the this was the best decade it was the greatest you know I I was in high school and I did this and I you know had this going for me and I was a cheerleader and and this and it was so wonderful it was so great and she never really moved on from that she was always living her best life from the past and and here we are we're called to live in the now amen would you agree with that that we're called to live in the now then let me ask let me ask you a question then why is it so easy for us to get stuck in the hurts of the past why is it so easy for us to be consumed with things that have happened to us where all our conversations are look and I'm guilty of this I'm I I tell there is not a sermon that I preach that that I preach because I've seen something I got to deal with this that's not who I am I I preach something because I'm dealing with it amen this this is my life that I'm preaching to you this is my voice that I'm giving to you amen and I I asked myself why why do we get so stuck on things that happen to us and we can't get past them when I'm called to live now amen and we get stuck on on people who hurt us and people who abused us whether it was in our childhood or growing growing up or or churches that we've attended and and and things that have happened to us and we get stuck and everything becomes filtered through this lens of of my pain where I've been unfairly abused or I've been wounded and we and we can't move on we can't live as we want to live we can't worship as we want to worship because we are still stuck living and being influenced by the past that's me I just confessed it to you so many times I I can't break through like I want because my mind is is dealing with stuff that happened years ago help us Lord God because I I I say this because I know I'm not the only one I'm not the only one that because it's human nature each one of us has a story that we've come from there's there's things that we've gone through things that battles that we've fought that have that affected us hurts that we've endured and it's high time that I get past some of it it's high time that I that I start living in the Now by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm called to manifest a life I'm called to manifest a voice that was spoken it it it wasn't just William brandom and that that ended it it wasn't just Wesley or Luther or or any of those great great men of God that that would come and would speak but it has to come down to a people and a people has to utter a voice to this generation wherever you're at amen the Prophet Joel prophesied and and said and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and then hundreds of years later Peter and the apostles stumble out of the the the upper room and they begin manifesting this scripture they begin manifesting it and it wasn't and I was thinking about this the other day it wasn't just that it listen to me now it wasn't just that that Peter and and Paul or Paul wasn't there but that John and the different ones that you know they finally got into one Accord and Harmony the Holy Spirit came down you know that was it that wasn't the scene that wasn't the entire scene the scene was remember remember how brother brandom talks about the vision and he saids you know certain things have to come into place before it can come to pass you know the cat has to be sitting here this person has to be sitting here when they came out of the upper when everything happened it happened exactly and specifically when God said it would happen amen that the time had come and it wasn't just that the apostles got into the right frame of mind and the Holy Spirit came down because they had they had done it that wasn't it all the people on the street Every Nation every Kindred every tongue in that in that known Roman world had to be there witness in Jerusalem amen this was a when this happened this was like one of the busiest times B busiest Festival there people from all over the empire were gathered there and they were all represented just random not random but uh just people from every Walk of Life Tradesmen and vendors and sellers and and and uh laborers it all had came and it all arrived just in time for the for the Holy Ghost to come down into the upper room and these men to stumble out and be be viewed and that prophecy was being fulfilled and being made manifest and it wasn't just for the apostles it wasn't just you know the Holy Spirit came down and that was it you know and so they just they just came out and you know Peter all of a sudden something was being made manifest you catching it's something something had been spoken hundreds of years ago with suddenly coming into reality amen and and those men all the nations all the tongues all of them heard the gospel in their own language their that voice came through and it spoke to every person they didn't have to to hear you know they didn't have to sit there and watch somebody's life they didn't have to but see it had to become made manifest so people could could grab what good would it be what good would it be if if somebody came if Jesus came and and he he opened the scroll and said you know this day the scripture is fulfilled and he set it aside and disappeared into the dustbins of History what good would it be if brother brandom came and Malachi he said you know uh Malachi 4 is is fulfilled and the hearts of the children are turned back to the the fathers put the Bible down and disappear what good would it be if there wasn't a manifestation if there wasn't something to look at if if God God doesn't send his word in speak it and it's just it's just goes out there and doesn't accomplish something amen God doesn't speak his word aimlessly and he doesn't speak it aimlessly in this day that there has to be a people who will Who will manifest through their lives what God Said would be amen there will be a people there will be an overcomer there will be a bride there will be someone who who manifests the word of God in this day amen it wasn't it wasn't just uh them stumbling out out of the the upper room and Peter preaches a sermon but that was something that had Ripple effects throughout eternity that people would would say you know they would they would hear that and it say that they were converted and baptized and I I off the top of my head I think it was like 5,000 people baptized but then they took what they heard just that little bit and they went back to their Kingdom to their corner of the Kingdom hundreds of miles away or a thousand miles away wherever they were from and then they started sharing you know I was in Jerusalem and you know something was strange this happened and they began to speak and they told us this and you know I was baptized into this new faith and and so it had Ripple effects throughout history throughout time and and your voice the life that you live has Ripple effects you don't know that you touched what's one person this one time this one circumstance and that then that person talks to this person and this person and all of a sudden you know you're in heaven and you're getting a crown for something you didn't even know you did wow thank you Lord Amen in Romans 10:18 it says but I say have they not heard yes indeed their sound has gone out to all the Earth and their words to the ends of the world not just their words but I would say their voices the those voices have echoed throughout time and are still going forth and accomplish in what God had intended amen The Voice you know and the life that you live that it's going to have an effect throughout time as long as we're here your testimony will have an effect it people will will know who you are and God doesn't speak his word without a purpose it it goes forth and it accomplishes that which he has intended amen it's not it's not just a boomerang where he throws it out and it flies back to him I said it and okay puts it back back in his pocket and he's done no it goes out and it has to accomplish something whether he says let there be light or whether he says there will be a bride whether it's it's you know he creates something and he speaks his word and he creates something or it's it's uh you know by if you believe on the sacrifice if you do this then I promise you this will happen and it has to happen amen he said in in Malachi that message would go forth that would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers but that word had to go to to a people then who could live it amen there had to be a there had to be somebody who could receive the seed word and then inculcate and germinate that word and birth Christ in their life amen it couldn't just go it didn't just go to like random people out out there you know the the the the parable you know he's casting seed here casting it here and wherever it lands that's true but the point is is that that some of that seed found the good ground some of that seed found the ground that it was intended for amen the the seed when he scattered it it wasn't intended for the rocks it wasn't intended for the bad soil it was intended for the good soil amen you are that good soil the word was intended for you it wasn't intended for the for the the random person out there who you know boy that just s that just sounds awful as a preacher it wasn't just intended for the brother random said Canon father Lord help us I'm so glad that I don't know who Who's Who Hallelujah I'm so glad that you know I'm just called just to spread the seed and not make a decision of who's in The Bride and who's got the real message and who's got the real Revelation and and you know and we have to preach in this circle and we have to understand it this way amen I'm I'm so glad that I'm I'm not making those calls but this word has to go out and it has to go out to all the Earth and that's that's where we are today and brother brandom said this in uh why little Bethlehem he said oh God anoint us with Thy word and bring Thy word promised to this day to pass God is God's word is promised to this day not another age this day didn't end with in 65 it's still going on this word bring it bring this word this life which I now live bring it to pass bring it to pass and me oh God he says may we leave this building this morning as shining instruments of God may we go with the sword at glittering in the air to cut away every weight and everything else all the may cut away the the depression may it cut away the anxiety may it cut away the past and the hurts of the past lay aside every weight that would so easily beset us until we can get back the people to Christ amen he said in in the third sill I I just I just think this is so so astounding he said they they miss him the Living Word manifest Ed In the Flesh by the word that is Promised the word promised to do these things the promise was made that it will be like this in the last days and yet people miss it people miss it people walk away from it and the world the World Hears us and they see our they they may come and view this this service or they might see your life and and they might not know what it is the sound going forth they might not ever link your life to brother brandom but they know that your life is not a Methodist life you're not a Methodist you don't produce you don't look like a Methodist Le not any methodists I've seen since the 1700s or 1800s you don't look like Lutheran you don't you don't look maybe you might look a little kind of like Pentecostals you kind of like that Pentecostal experience but there's still something a little bit different you know people people they they they don't know what the sound is but they know they're something a little different you know you're sitting how many times do you sit in the restaurant this doesn't happen to me so much now you know that that our children are a little bit older but I'm sure it's happened to you and you you've experienced that that you're in the restaurant and people just come up to you and they're just like oh we just have to compliment you your family is so beautiful you guys are so clean there's something different about about you you know your children you know they're so polite they're so you know they're so well-mannered and well behaved and and of course you know that's that's only a small percentage of the time they're under threat but they see something has happened to each each one of you I has that happened to you when somebody comes raise your hand has that happened to you that somebody's come up keep keep your hand up for me keep your hand up has it ever happened where somebody's come up to you and been like there's something just a little bit different about you that's a miracle that's the word of God expressed through your life amen you ought to thank God for that you ought to thank god wow people they you know they they say they they talk to you and they I know you're not from around here I I remember one time I I like to tell this story I was in a cab in in in New York and uh the uh the cab driver he was talking to me he was taking me to the train station so I could get on a train and um so we were just chitchatting he says you know now you're not you're not from around here now most of the time when I'm when I'm from you know my background is in the South you know so if I'm not careful I slip into a Southern accent especially if I'm a little bit nervous or if I'm really relaxed but uh so most of the time when people catch me they then they say you're not from around here they're like oh you you must be from like Georgia or Tennessee or somewhere way down south you know and and my my people are all from Kentucky Tennessee but so that's how most people you know say well you're different you're not from around here to me well this this this guy says no I know you're not from around here I oh you know how's that he said well you're nice you're nice and you know it it wasn't you know my language it wasn't it it wasn't how I was dressed it was just the way that I carried myself it's it was something just a little bit different than than what he was used to dealing with I I know you're not from around here people look at you and they look at your life how and how you're dressed and how you conduct yourselves and they say you know that person's not from around here I wonder where they're from I could I can tell you I came from the mind of God I'm not from around here I I may live in Canada I may live here in petroia or Wyoming or or or Ontario but but my home my residence is not from here my background is not from here my background is of a is from a different Kingdom Amen brother brandom says and the the sea will not be air with the Shu I love this he that this great mystery of God made known understand how that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the father were one how that the the great Mysteries of the fulfilling of God and taking and bringing himself listen to this manifested in the age of human beings and in the strain the genetics in the strain of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifest in the day and then he goes on he says in the Eastern rising of the Sun and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west listen to this to make his manifested in a bride Church the word made manifest that's powerful that God spoke his word and it had to come and it has to be made manifest in this flesh that gets old where our hair falls out it turns gray and we get fat and in our flesh where we say things we ought not to say and we have attitudes we ought not to have and we we fail and we fall short that God still manifests his life in this flesh the word made manifest today is who you are are each one of you the word of God that he spoke that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world and he said there let there be a Tim let there be a Vicki let there be an Amy than you Lord and that word just went out and it kept going through Time and Eternity until finally the right things came together and the right people got together and and this person married this person and they had this child and this and this and this finally that word could be made manifest and here you are today oh my for such a time as this we have come into the world let me see how much I can skip here amen I I I may mention earlier how how the uh the root words of light and voice come down to the same thing in God's language God God often uses them interchangeable in Zechariah 14:7 it shall be one day which is known to the Lord neither day nor night but at evening time it shall happen that it will be light maybe I could say it like this that at evening time there will be a voice in the evening time there will be a voice that voice didn't stop then but that voice is continuing on being spoken in the bride if you don't believe me you can go back and read what your Prophet said he said the voice of God will be in the bride nobody else has the voice amen and the voice didn't stop it's still here it's still going forth It's still speaking lives are still being spoken a testimony of God Amen I am that light in the evening time I am that manifestation I am what God Said would come to pass I am that God said there will be an overcomer that's me I see myself in Scripture I see myself fulfilling the word of God I see it I see where it said that that as many that shall receive the Holy Ghost to their children as many as called as many far that's me I was there I that word was spoken over me and now I've stepped into it amen that there would be a there would be children whose Faith would be turned back to the apostolic fathers that's me I see myself in scripture amen I'm not looking and saying oh you know Revelation 10:7 or or Matthew 7 or this or that you know that was the Fulfillment you know and I tried to I'm not identified I'm identified with that and how I believe but as far as for me and who I am I see myself in Scripture that there will be a bride amen that there will be Overcomers in this last day and I'm stepping into that scripture I'm stepping into the Fulfillment the manifestation of that word amen his voice is in you his voice is in the bride in Revelation 10:7 we'll just closing now he says uh I know I know you're all familiar with it but let me read it but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel when he is about to sound and the Mystery of God would be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets then the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel who stands on the sea and on the earth and so I went to the angel and and I give me the little book and he said take it and eat it and you remember that in the in the in his mouth that was sweet as honey but when it got into his stomach it was bitter you know like the digestion of it you know this word you know takes some going over sometimes you got to digest it it's not easy you can't just take the word you know it's like oh yeah that sounds real good but you know you get it in your stomach and you start digesting it and you go home and you get into the scripture yourself and you start searching things out and you start saying oh my I can't live this way I see in my I see in the word that I'm not spoken supposed to do this I see in the word that I'm supposed to act a little bit different than the world that I'm not supposed to love the things of the world I don't want to love this I don't want to pursue this and so it's bitter but then he goes on and he says he says You must prophesy again to many peoples Nations and tongues and kings and and that wasn't just John prophesying but that voice had to come and be manifested in this day this day that there would be a people who would prophesy Pro a prophetic people brother brandom said that would be speaking the word of God to All Nations all people all kingdoms all tongues that none would be without excuse that all people would hear and so we have to take it and speak each one of us where else could this have been fulfilled but this time where else that this word that was spoken nearly 2,000 years ago to All Nations all kindreds all tongues when could have been fulfilled until today not even in brother Brandon's time it could not have truly have been fulfilled and today we have these instant access to everything instant access to to every corner of the globe every every part of the the world every nation every tongue every Kindred it doesn't matter where you are you can you can get on one of these things just about look up the everything you want to know it could only be in this day that they could be fulfilled like this and we put this on the internet just this little little sermon you know there'll be people who watch it from Uganda there'll be people who watch it from Jamaica there'll be people who watch it from from Vietnam somebody from China only today could this be fulfilled only today could you be here to fulfill this you are a call and chosen people for such a time as this and your life matters your voice matters I thank godu help me Lord to step into the vision help me to manifest his voice in my life amen because the spirit and the bride say come come even so Lord Jesus come the bride has made herself ready amen let's bow our heads Lord father God the life which I now live I live through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ help me Lord to manifest your word may there be less and less of me living and more of you all is unlike you Lord I beg you strip it away every sin every failure every

daily basis Jesus will send me messages call me say something nice say something kind amen we're not from here God bless you God bless you you know you know we all had times in our lives where we cried for that kind of Fellowship kindness just just just love a buddy my buddy and you know he's talking about the I'm not sorry brother John I'm not trying it was just a powerful message message you know brother Carson says sometimes why do you stop I I'm thinking brother John why did you stop you were just hitting the mountain tops you know you know in Genesis 38 it said that Adam and Eve heard the voice walking through the Wilderness and it was the light of Jehovah and you know science proves that your body's right full of light that's the only way they can exray you and they can see the negative in there and show the good parts about your delight and so now you're the light of the world and you're walking in and they you Wen saying the thing and and you know when we at brother cars and sister Sharon and we were talking about the the outer atmosphere and and if you look in that verse the darkness fleed amen it is that was that was god Jehovah Christ today made flesh sitting right here in Wyoming sitting right here here brother John you were the light and you were walking amen and it was a voice and it was and there was locking in the gard and the ones that weren't right with Christ flee that's right amongst the people oh it don't say amongst the people it says amongst the trees and trees in the Bible were always people hallelujah exactly today exactly what brother John preached Hallelujah the only light the world ever see is the bride of Christ the the only Bible they'll ever read the only other voice they'll ever how each one of you will will walk among people that
