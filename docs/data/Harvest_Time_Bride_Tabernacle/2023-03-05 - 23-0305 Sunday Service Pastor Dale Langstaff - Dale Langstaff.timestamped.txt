[9:23] not understand
[9:27] many times and trials
[9:31] weakness blurs my vision and my
[9:35] frustration gets so out of hands
[9:39] it's that I am reminded I've never been
[9:44] forsaken I've never heard
[9:52] as I look at all the victories the
[9:56] spirit Rises up in me it's through the
[10:00] fire my weakness is made strong
[10:05] and he never promised that the cross
[10:09] would not get heavy nor the hill would
[10:13] not be hard to come
[10:17] he never offered a victory without
[10:22] fighting but he said help what always
[10:26] come in time
[10:29] so just remember when you're standing in
[10:33] the valley of decision and the adversary

[27:49] bounce back here
[27:51] girls amen
[27:53] we had an amazing wonderful trip
[27:57] and just praise God for his safety and
[28:01] and all these things I'm just going to
[28:03] read a scripture and then we'll
[28:06] um
[28:07] I uh got notes to preach but we have a
[28:10] lot of pictures I'd like to show you the
[28:12] pictures I believe it's part of the
[28:14] ministry and part of the
[28:17] many were not able to come today
[28:20] different reasons I mean Jordan Vanessa
[28:23] are gone and Max was planning on being
[28:25] here and and neighbor had a barn fall
[28:28] down on a bunch of cattle and from the
[28:30] snow load and so he's uh putting cattle
[28:34] to sleep this morning and different
[28:36] things but uh
[28:38] God knows amen and so we might actually
[28:40] talk about this not just today but next
[28:43] Sunday also
[28:44] Max was telling Jared he said oh I hope
[28:47] dad don't get done everything this
[28:48] Sunday
[28:50] but God knows it man amen so God knows
[28:54] everything I mean let's turn to Matthew
[28:56] 25 and we're just going to read a few
[28:59] scriptures there and just take our texts
[29:02] amen and of course you know that the
[29:05] commission that we have is to go into
[29:07] all the world and preach the gospel
[29:09] amen God gave that to us also with the
[29:14] baptism and
[29:16] and communion and foot washing and but I
[29:19] want to read this scripture and if I'm
[29:20] when I'm talking this morning this is in
[29:23] no way to I just want to clarify even
[29:25] before I read the scripture about your
[29:27] 25 31 Amy this is in no way to put a
[29:33] burden on anybody
[29:35] financially at all this is that's not
[29:38] the purpose of God at all and but it
[29:43] just it you know uh Pastor Jose said
[29:46] something when we were gone
[29:49] that
[29:52] was very true he said we are
[29:55] we in North America
[29:58] are living
[29:59] in
[30:02] how did he say that
[30:03] we're living
[30:05] in deceit we're living we're living at
[30:07] we're living a dream
[30:09] that's not reality
[30:11] we're we're not we're not uh
[30:14] we're not connected
[30:16] amen and and my message this morning
[30:19] was
[30:21] see we know that we're part of God and
[30:23] we came from God
[30:25] and God said that no man ever hated its
[30:28] own body
[30:29] but we're one body
[30:31] and so if your little toe hurts you this
[30:33] morning or your ear your whole body will
[30:36] concentrate on that pain
[30:38] but we don't do that spiritually
[30:40] but we flat out do not do that
[30:43] we fly down
[30:45] we say well
[30:47] God didn't Place me there we justify
[30:49] ourselves bitterly
[30:50] amen God didn't Place me there I'm not
[30:53] in that situation I can't help the world
[30:55] you know God didn't call me for these
[30:57] things man and God didn't but God called
[31:01] you to change your world
[31:03] your environment the people you touch
[31:06] remember I clarified I'm not out for
[31:08] your money this morning I'm not out at
[31:10] all for that but if the body hurts
[31:15] you know the Bible says in these
[31:17] scriptures he said when one weeps we all
[31:19] weep when one rejoices we all Rejoice
[31:21] but we don't do those things
[31:24] because we're in our own focused world
[31:28] amen and so
[31:32] the body of Christ lives very
[31:34] differently than us
[31:36] we went to Pastor's houses that were 100
[31:39] percent mud
[31:41] we went to churches
[31:44] his church was 100 percent mud except
[31:48] the tin on the roof
[31:49] and I'll show you
[31:53] in the video
[31:56] it's mud floor and they took their shoes
[31:58] off when they come into church
[32:00] not to get the mud dirty
[32:02] now that's
[32:04] that's like Supernatural
[32:07] amen but that's part of the body amen
[32:10] and how are we going to get all I would
[32:12] express to you is how are we going to
[32:14] get to heaven as the bride of Christ and
[32:17] some people get there and maybe die of
[32:19] starvation literally
[32:22] and brother Dale get their fat
[32:24] and we're all going to be one beautiful
[32:26] body
[32:28] wow I've never affected
[32:30] so much by traveling as there was this
[32:33] time
[32:34] possibly because the wind was with me
[32:35] but let me read this scripture and
[32:39] and we'll just show the video and or the
[32:41] pictures and video and we'll never
[32:43] finish we'll probably finish next week
[32:44] and then sometime I'll preach
[32:46] whether it's a week or two from now amen
[32:49] but let's read uh Matthew uh here and
[32:52] we're going to read to uh
[32:54] wherever my
[32:56] iPad ghostly man
[33:03] and when the son of man shall come in
[33:05] his glory and all the Holy Angels with
[33:07] them then so he sit down upon the throne
[33:09] of his glory
[33:13] and before him shall be gathered all the
[33:16] nations and shelters and he shall
[33:18] separate them one from another as the
[33:20] Sheep as a Shepherd divideth his sheep
[33:24] from the goats
[33:27] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[33:29] hand but the goats on his left
[33:34] and then shall the king say unto them on
[33:36] his right hand cometh ye blessed of my
[33:39] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[33:41] you
[33:42] from the foundation of the world
[33:46] Hallelujah next verse some counting on
[33:49] yemi for I was hungry
[33:51] and you gave me meat I was thirsty and
[33:54] you gave me drink
[33:58] and I was a stranger
[34:00] and you took me in
[34:03] naked and you clothed me and I was sick
[34:07] and you visited me and I was in prison
[34:09] and you came unto me
[34:11] then shall the righteous answer him
[34:13] saying Lord wind saw we thee hungry and
[34:17] fed thee or when thirsty and I gave thee
[34:20] drink
[34:21] now this is Christ himself talking and
[34:24] when saw we thee a stranger and took
[34:27] thee in or naked or clothed thee
[34:30] God himself talking
[34:33] next verse below
[34:36] or whence all we the sick or in prison
[34:40] and came unto thee
[34:43] and the King shall answer and say unto
[34:45] them verily I say unto you that in as
[34:48] much as you have done it unto one of the
[34:50] least of these my brethren that's the
[34:53] body
[34:55] ye have done it unto me personally
[34:59] because see we came from him and we're a
[35:02] part of him
[35:03] amen
[35:05] amen let's see how far it went here
[35:07] let's a couple more verses here Amy
[35:11] so we're going to go to 45 I believe it
[35:13] is
[35:16] then Joey say unto them on the left hand
[35:18] depart from me you curse it into
[35:20] Everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[35:23] and his angels
[35:26] for I was hungry and you gave me no meat
[35:28] and I was thirsty and you gave me no
[35:30] drink
[35:33] and I was a stranger and you took me not
[35:35] in I was naked and you clothed me not
[35:37] sick and in prison and you visited me
[35:40] not
[35:42] then shall they say an answer unto him
[35:44] saying Lord when saw we thee hungry see
[35:48] God has to God can't judge somebody
[35:51] without them understanding the judgment
[35:54] and when saw we hungry and thirst and or
[35:57] a stranger or naked or sick or in prison
[35:59] and we didn't misery taunt you see these
[36:02] people believed that they would have did
[36:03] it for Jesus
[36:05] and then shall he answer and say unto
[36:07] them verily verily I say unto you that
[36:09] in as much as ye did it not to the one
[36:12] of the least of these
[36:13] you never did it
[36:15] to me Lord Jesus we ask you Jesus said
[36:18] your blessing to this word and may you
[36:20] just be with us as we Minister your word
[36:23] this morning in your name we pray
[36:26] amen amen you may have your seats I just
[36:28] want to read a couple more scriptures
[36:30] just to lay a foundation we're just
[36:31] going to go right into the scriptures
[36:33] and I want to just tell you a little
[36:34] thought here you know I was you know
[36:37] studying and putting these notes
[36:39] together and stuff and you know there's
[36:41] a saying that says you know the entire
[36:43] water of the ocean or sea cannot sink a
[36:47] ship
[36:49] unless you let the water in the ship
[36:52] and the entire influence of evil and sin
[36:57] of this world cannot sink the body of
[36:59] Christ
[37:02] unless you let that in
[37:04] your Shepherd
[37:06] amen don't matter you can't justify and
[37:09] say well you know this or that the
[37:11] world's changed that so you can't
[37:13] justify it unless you let it in you
[37:16] and then you sink
[37:18] you can get prepared it all you know
[37:21] John 3 13 I'm just going to read two
[37:23] verses two scriptures here John 3 13
[37:25] says no man Ascend us up to heaven but
[37:28] that first he came down from heaven even
[37:30] the son of man which is in heaven now
[37:33] and you know that's a great mystery but
[37:35] that's here's Jesus talking about you're
[37:37] not going to live eternally unless you
[37:39] were already eternal unless you're not
[37:42] going to be with God for in heaven
[37:44] unless you came from God and you can
[37:46] even ask Google that because nothing
[37:48] lives eternal
[37:50] has no beginning
[37:52] and the only thing that never had a
[37:54] beginning was God himself amen last
[37:56] scripture here is Ephesians 5 32 and
[37:58] here's Jesus here's uh Paul talking
[38:01] about a marriage between a husband and
[38:03] wife and he's going into all the detail
[38:06] how the wife and the husband and and all
[38:08] this and Christ the head of the church
[38:10] and all this and then if and then in 32
[38:13] and this is a great mystery
[38:16] marriage is a great mystery
[38:20] if you look down it straight in the
[38:21] natural that's not really much of a
[38:22] mystery that's just a man and wife
[38:24] fallen in love
[38:27] but he told all that to say but I speak
[38:29] concerning Christ
[38:32] and his church
[38:34] that was Christ
[38:36] Falling in Love
[38:37] with this church
[38:39] amen
[38:40] amen well we apologize
[38:43] for maybe being hardly on time
[38:47] and uh I I thought Vicki could just plug
[38:50] the phone into the hundreds of pictures
[38:53] we have
[38:55] but she had to send them through
[38:56] Facebook
[38:57] to be able to share them and Vicki if we
[39:00] put the pictures on the screen we I want
[39:02] you to catch the screen so turn the
[39:04] camera for brother Jim and brother Jim
[39:07] was unable to be here because of sister
[39:09] Linda and he tried to get somebody and
[39:11] he could not
[39:13] that wasn't an option even the church
[39:15] just offered to help him if he gets
[39:17] somebody and so brother Jim will share
[39:20] when he is able to be here like I don't
[39:23] know if you can catch a screen and me
[39:25] both okay
[39:27] um and uh
[39:28] I have a
[39:34] new respects for uh brother Bernard and
[39:37] sister Ruth because it it is uh I never
[39:42] had it affect me the same is it's it's
[39:44] different coming from a place
[39:47] like let me give you an example I woke
[39:49] up at 3 30 this morning four o'clock
[39:52] this morning was noon time Leo was
[39:55] finishing his message
[39:57] and you know like since I've come home
[39:59] every day I'm just totally thinking well
[40:01] they're here and this person's here and
[40:03] they're in the market and they're and it
[40:06] really messes with your
[40:08] thoughts and your pattern just
[40:10] tremendously unbelievably but uh
[40:15] because we love those people brother
[40:17] Bernard has family there churches
[40:19] friends bride of Christ
[40:21] and it's it's very different very very
[40:23] different I come home and I was like oh
[40:27] if I was there
[40:29] man it's very very different it you
[40:32] can't explain it you have to experience
[40:33] it it's just not so this is us when we
[40:36] left
[40:37] and uh brother Jim and and Pastor Jose
[40:40] went with us and uh I will I will I will
[40:44] share
[40:46] things these brothers we had a wonderful
[40:49] time together and they you know it's
[40:52] it's just uh you just have to take my
[40:55] word for this it's just different when
[40:57] you actually see it this trip was
[40:59] totally different for me because the
[41:01] wind was there
[41:03] and
[41:06] when you see it as a couple
[41:09] it's just very very different amen I
[41:11] didn't have to explain to Luanne why I
[41:13] got rid of
[41:15] as much money as I did because she's
[41:17] seen it amen This Is Us Just Landing we
[41:22] landed in Uganda
[41:23] and the people that were helping get our
[41:25] bags off the thing were already begging
[41:27] us for money
[41:28] I said I haven't got no Uganda Shillings
[41:29] yet and he said well you can go exchange
[41:31] your U.S money right there
[41:33] but there was people that would help you
[41:35] in the airport that they were already
[41:36] selling you they were hungry
[41:39] it was just
[41:41] overwhelming
[41:43] man this is a poor picture because it's
[41:46] midnight but their sister Oliver beside
[41:49] Luanne and brother Jose
[41:51] of course and this was the very worst
[41:53] part of the trip when we got picked up
[41:55] at the airport I was the most stressed
[41:57] on this part of course we were very
[41:59] tired we'd been in the air for 17 18
[42:01] hours in the air we'd been in a plane
[42:04] for 20 hours and we'd been traveling for
[42:07] 30 30 hours
[42:09] and over there it's not safe to drive
[42:12] after night
[42:13] amen totally not and we probably almost
[42:16] got killed a hundred times from the
[42:17] airport to the
[42:19] to the
[42:21] brother leels the first night and I'd
[42:23] already told Leo Pastor Leo that we
[42:26] would not travel
[42:27] after dark and that was the only time we
[42:30] traveled after dark we made all our
[42:32] planes around literally half the
[42:34] vehicles on the road have no lights
[42:36] or reduce lights
[42:39] and and they drive very very
[42:41] aggressively
[42:43] especially overtaking they call it
[42:45] overtaking but it's called passing so
[42:47] they will pull out at night with no
[42:48] lights and overtake a vehicle and you're
[42:50] expected to disappear or have a head-on
[42:53] collision that's just that's just
[42:54] standard opportunity for them amen so we
[42:59] got there uh late late on the
[43:02] Friday
[43:04] very late like like I went to sleep at
[43:06] four o'clock in the morning the 4 30.
[43:09] very late if you call that sleep I woke
[43:12] up very early we wake up to the
[43:15] different noises and stuff and brother
[43:17] Jim was preaching I think about nine
[43:20] o'clock
[43:20] and so when me and sister Luanne walked
[43:23] to church like go back to the other
[43:25] picture Amy
[43:26] um that's a minute that's part of the
[43:28] ministers that's just the ministers that
[43:30] they could fit on beside the platform
[43:32] that would have been like sitting right
[43:33] there
[43:35] um
[43:36] Pastor Leo's actually going to give me
[43:37] the list but there was over 70 pastors
[43:41] president
[43:43] 70. that's like mind-blowing
[43:46] and of course that's not all the first
[43:48] rows are pastors so we can go on
[43:52] um
[43:54] the church is very very beautiful very
[43:57] very full so me and sister Luanne we
[43:59] walked to church I believe the first or
[44:01] Leo picked us up we walked back after
[44:04] but they had uh you're going to see
[44:06] pitchers after they had literally two
[44:09] tents beside the church and two in front
[44:11] of the church and they had speakers
[44:13] literally as high as my head sitting on
[44:16] the ground massive speakers so everybody
[44:18] in Michiana heard the messages
[44:20] including the the all the denominational
[44:24] churches around we would walk from from
[44:26] an enroll
[44:28] and as soon as you left enroll you'd say
[44:31] well that's who's preaching you could
[44:32] already hear him uh when we went home to
[44:36] shower you'd have to go home and shower
[44:38] because very hot so when you were done
[44:40] preaching you just were soaked
[44:42] like so
[44:44] um there we just go okay we can go
[44:45] through them uh quicker
[44:48] um
[44:49] I I went through these pictures
[44:52] multiple times to delete okay this is
[44:54] I'm singing a special sister Oliver and
[44:56] some of the local sisters saying one
[44:58] special right before I preached uh
[45:01] of course the the ministers are
[45:06] in the front there this is actually
[45:09] after the service
[45:11] the anointing ministering is like just
[45:15] unbelievable
[45:18] Amy just wait back up let me see what
[45:21] was before okay that's us okay this is
[45:23] at the end of the church and so we're
[45:26] under a tent brother Jim's under a tent
[45:28] with that's an evangelist Isaac there
[45:30] and uh the ministers all ate together so
[45:33] the ministers had their own food line
[45:35] and their own tent which was packed that
[45:39] little building in the back with a
[45:41] little vent on it is their washrooms for
[45:44] the church
[45:45] um what they call washrooms
[45:48] um
[45:48] and uh then we'll show you where the
[45:51] other people ate of course we went and
[45:52] miggled with everybody uh after we ate
[45:57] um
[45:58] this is that's a poor picture but that's
[46:01] showing a big bucket this was amazing
[46:03] they cooked all the food for hundreds
[46:06] and hundreds of people and Not only was
[46:08] there a lot of food but it was some of
[46:11] the best rice I've ever tasted in my
[46:12] life and I'm going to show you pictures
[46:14] that'll blow you away they were they
[46:15] were cooking the rice with logs as big
[46:18] as my leg
[46:19] and they just said a kettle see how the
[46:21] brick are there they just set a kettle
[46:24] over that
[46:25] and they would cook for
[46:28] five to seven hundred people
[46:31] amazing and of course it's 100 degrees
[46:34] over there and so when you're sitting on
[46:37] a blazing fire you're going to see the
[46:38] fire it's like it's 200 degrees and then
[46:42] many many people these are showing out
[46:45] by the kitchen area we can go through
[46:47] them a little okay this shows you an
[46:50] idea of the kettles like the one Kettle
[46:52] there would have been close to the top
[46:54] the ring line would have been brown
[46:55] beans knockout brown beans like we're
[46:58] not just talking about quantity of food
[47:00] we're talking about the best food you've
[47:01] ever ate in your life
[47:03] uh we actually hoarded the brown beans
[47:06] to take them to Pastor Leo's so we could
[47:07] eat them after so this wasn't stuff that
[47:10] you didn't want to eat this was stuff
[47:11] that you were plotting to eat
[47:14] like Pilates to eat this is I'm serving
[47:16] the the Brethren and you can see here
[47:18] the line and the tent this is the side
[47:20] door of the church this is the side door
[47:22] of the church and the tents are on the
[47:24] side where people would sit and listen
[47:25] mainly uh older people or mothers and
[47:28] kids and that but you can see the lines
[47:30] way back to the front of the church
[47:32] it'll disappear and they're going
[47:34] through the line there
[47:36] um this is a short video I think of them
[47:37] painting it's not very clear oh it's
[47:40] clear to you
[47:41] um you can just let it go it's very
[47:43] short I think that's actually uh them
[47:45] just working also I show you the
[47:47] expectation it's just a different world
[47:50] and I'm just I'm rambling but I'm trying
[47:53] to get you to experience what we
[47:55] experience okay that's a different one
[47:56] we shut that off that's Junior's house
[47:59] so you can stop that video
[48:03] um the the the pastor with the clay
[48:07] house and church
[48:10] um
[48:13] they had they had fasted for four days
[48:16] fasted and prayed for four days for the
[48:18] meeting
[48:19] and uh
[48:21] Pastor Leo told me the meeting started
[48:23] on
[48:24] on Saturday morning brother Jim was
[48:26] first speaker and they were still
[48:28] painting the church on Thursday night
[48:30] and people were showing up to for
[48:32] meeting on Thursday night so they had
[48:35] somebody actually preach on Friday not
[48:38] expected but people would show up like
[48:40] two days early just because in
[48:43] expectations
[48:44] amen Pastor Leo or Pastor Jose said you
[48:48] know I preached Saturday morning and
[48:50] Sunday morning and Pastor Jose said
[48:53] something to me after I preached he said
[48:55] brother Dale he said it's something
[48:57] about
[48:58] an evangelist he said you were an
[48:59] evangelist he said I said I don't think
[49:01] you looked at your notes one time it's
[49:03] just that's just the way it is that you
[49:05] just come up you read a verse and it
[49:07] just was boom
[49:08] it's just it was just a wonderful
[49:11] wonderful experience are we back on
[49:12] schedule
[49:15] um
[49:19] is there South this is
[49:22] [Music]
[49:27] this is very early so people are still
[49:30] showing up there's uh the church is not
[49:33] packed when it was prime time it was
[49:36] when one person moved everybody moved
[49:39] this would have been right before I
[49:42] ministered
[49:43] the uh the brother that I actually
[49:45] interpreted for me used to live in
[49:47] Michiana with Leo
[49:49] he now is at uh uh your church brother
[49:53] Bernard
[49:55] Speckled Bird church he moved for work
[49:58] in that but he is an amazing interpreter
[50:00] best interpreter I ever seen in my life
[50:02] he was just a machine gun
[50:05] very very awesome interpreter we can
[50:07] move on
[50:08] uh
[50:09] different pictures
[50:19] okay here's here's it shows you the
[50:21] amount of kettles and these barrels they
[50:24] actually washed our food in I'm sorry
[50:25] I'm not a professional video camera
[50:29] that'll be our cow there
[50:34] they would cook all day Friday Saturday
[50:36] and Sunday
[50:38] all day
[50:39] this was multiple there was probably
[50:45] 30 plus people that were involved in
[50:48] cooking or washing dishes alone
[50:51] it was a major ordeal to war six or
[50:54] seven hundred plates
[50:56] or hundreds and hundreds of plates
[50:58] literally they
[50:59] uh these bananas they use the banana
[51:02] leaves as kind of like Lids to go over
[51:04] the food
[51:05] we can go to the next one
[51:11] that's just a video of the people going
[51:13] through the line
[51:16] [Music]
[51:32] it's actually uh
[51:34] there was two sisters there one had a
[51:37] one sister had a short leg
[51:40] and one sister had a big wound on her
[51:42] and I sent Luanne to investigate with
[51:46] the sisters the one sister had been born
[51:48] that way
[51:50] the other sister actually we found out
[51:52] after was had was diagnosed with cancer
[51:56] but she had a she had an open wound
[51:58] probably about that size
[52:00] rate between her knee and her calf right
[52:04] there uh
[52:07] that just of course her whole leg is
[52:10] swelled up
[52:11] in North America they would never came
[52:13] to church but she would come for the
[52:15] whole services
[52:16] and get prayed for and that this is
[52:18] where they fed the ministers this was
[52:20] just a different food line so there's
[52:21] actually uh was at least two food lines
[52:29] that was one of the main Cooks
[52:32] the brother from the church that's his
[52:34] mom beside him
[52:36] it's the moment you're going to go back
[52:37] in there you see that's the kettle that
[52:40] that that that that kettle's like
[52:43] two and a half three feet across
[52:45] and it's a good foot deep or longer
[52:47] that's right full of rice
[52:49] that was the best brown rice you've ever
[52:52] eaten
[52:57] so there's a couple houses that are are
[52:59] beside the church this is they're right
[53:02] beside just the pictures didn't go
[53:03] through fairly this was a house that had
[53:05] been for sale it's rape it faces the
[53:08] church the Sunday School rooms are very
[53:10] very close there but the the Neighbors
[53:12] in those houses are very very friendly
[53:14] very hugely friendly it's a good thing
[53:17] because we almost overtook them
[53:19] when we were gone
[53:22] um these are you're going to see this is
[53:23] a Sunday school room this building is
[53:26] what they call the Sunday School rooms
[53:27] and this little boy is a special boy but
[53:31] just go back one picture there no
[53:34] there okay see the doorway there in
[53:36] every place in Africa they hang they
[53:39] leave the doors open and hang a curtain
[53:41] uh
[53:43] but one of Leo's deacons that's homeless
[53:45] lives in the Sunday School room
[53:48] and if you go to the next pitcher that's
[53:51] his boy and I had a picture of him on my
[53:54] camera
[53:54] from when we were there
[53:56] three years ago
[53:58] amen we were able to
[54:01] change their situation a little bit
[54:04] and uh we actually I'll tell you a story
[54:07] you can keep going through the pictures
[54:08] and I'll tell you a story about this
[54:10] family that's a family of six I believe
[54:12] it was they have no house they live in
[54:15] the Sunday School room and her husband
[54:18] is older you can just keep going through
[54:19] them it's them are all short videos I'm
[54:22] sure and so the the the the part about
[54:25] the story is
[54:26] uh Satan came along
[54:29] uh tabernacled in a woman
[54:32] and was telling these people
[54:35] uh what are you doing uh
[54:37] living caretaking for the church for
[54:40] free
[54:41] now they were living in the Sunday
[54:42] School rooms for free because they're
[54:44] actually homeless this is right out in
[54:46] front of the Sunday School rooms that's
[54:48] a makeshift that's the roughest shed
[54:50] you've ever seen in your life but to the
[54:52] the okay that's their front door that's
[54:54] their front door which is supposed to be
[54:56] a Sunday school room and a family of six
[54:58] live in it now they have they have less
[55:00] than zero money and the the mother of
[55:03] that family sister had a daughter and
[55:06] she put her out so they just claimed the
[55:08] daughter as their own and so now they
[55:11] have a bigger family with less money
[55:13] because they didn't have enough money to
[55:14] take care of their own kids
[55:16] but the bride never takes
[55:20] they never had nothing for their own
[55:21] kids but they still take in more amen
[55:24] anyway so this devil came along and the
[55:26] sister and was telling these
[55:28] brother that interpreted for me the
[55:31] first time I went seven years ago
[55:34] um told these people said what are you
[55:35] doing caretaking for uh
[55:37] that the brother that's Pastor Vincent
[55:40] the brother on the far right
[55:42] or the farthest away from me is the
[55:44] brother that has a mud Huts Mud House
[55:46] and a mud Church
[55:49] um
[55:50] anyway in the process of building Pastor
[55:53] Leo's church and the construction this
[55:56] family that lived in the Sunday School
[55:57] room did all the cooking and housing and
[56:00] and stuff for all the workers and they
[56:03] actually watched all the construction
[56:05] stuff and steel and they were like the
[56:07] caretakers guards and Cooks all for free
[56:14] and so
[56:17] Satan had came into this person and told
[56:20] them they said what are you doing doing
[56:21] all this work and cooking and that for
[56:24] free and you're not getting nothing from
[56:25] the church
[56:27] and we were able to change your
[56:29] situation greatly when we were there
[56:32] and after we did that Pastor Leo told us
[56:35] on the way to the airport that God had
[56:39] passed their debts
[56:41] like when the children of Israel left
[56:43] Egypt then they took all the wealth of
[56:44] Egypt because they were slaves amen they
[56:48] had worked for a year or two with no
[56:49] money
[56:50] but when we were there there was
[56:52] actually a house by the church and
[56:53] Pastor Jose actually rented the house
[56:55] for the family
[56:57] and I was able to give we were able to
[56:59] give them a million and a half
[57:02] to start up a business and the the man
[57:06] needed a ruptree surgery and just put
[57:10] them on their feet and so they would be
[57:11] self
[57:12] sufficient also then that picture you'll
[57:15] see farther ahead these are all
[57:16] ministers a lot of the minister pitchers
[57:21] um
[57:21] you can just click through the pictures
[57:24] uh
[57:29] when we went when I actually the little
[57:31] boy that was in that picture when we
[57:33] were done eating I knew them and we were
[57:36] he was warming up to us and I asked him
[57:38] to show me his house I knew where they
[57:40] lived and I went in their house and
[57:43] there was a little boy uh boat like Lee
[57:45] or Curtis laying right on the cement
[57:48] floor just under a towel just like it
[57:51] was just a non-believable it looked
[57:54] worse than most of my barns like it was
[57:57] just just unbelievable situation I went
[58:01] and got Pastor Jose and I said hey I got
[58:03] something to show you
[58:04] and uh that was when we were able to
[58:08] change their situation so
[58:11] this is the sisters washing the dishes
[58:13] it was a major occurrence it don't look
[58:16] clean but it actually is clean the wash
[58:18] the dishes rinse them a couple times and
[58:20] then actually stack them on a rack so
[58:24] you can see the churches in the
[58:25] background then the bathrooms and they
[58:26] have the shed and the Sunday School
[58:27] rooms is on the side there
[58:31] how come we keep losing
[58:35] it's being ignorant
[58:42] yep
[58:50] more but you can see just Stacks and
[58:53] stacks of plates these are the the tents
[58:56] this is brother another one of Pastor
[58:58] Leo's Deacons
[58:59] actually his uh this Deacon uh Leo's
[59:03] daughter married his son
[59:05] um
[59:07] so this is a picture another angles of
[59:09] the church when we when you're there for
[59:11] the whole day sisters would go out and
[59:13] just lay on the grass away from the
[59:16] church just to lay with their baby and
[59:17] fall asleep you know with their baby in
[59:20] where this was my interpreter
[59:22] uh he was just amazing
[59:26] an amazing interpreter The Interpreter
[59:28] is really really important especially if
[59:31] you're under the anointing and it's
[59:33] going fast and it just really
[59:36] is an important thing when Pastor Leo or
[59:39] Pastor Jose preached for brother James
[59:42] that that was just amazing the last
[59:44] Sunday we were there uh
[59:48] they actually had two interpreters
[59:50] it's just really really really difficult
[59:58] yeah we got a video on this one this is
[1:00:00] the main toy of kids there

[1:00:42] are it looks like he's really staring he
[1:00:45] actually has tumors in his head
[1:00:54] that the middle guy in between me and
[1:00:55] Leo there was actually at the scene of
[1:00:58] the accident when her accident happened

[1:16:17] because the fish would fly this fish was
[1:16:20] caught that morning
[1:16:21] so we're in there at 10 o'clock it's
[1:16:23] fresh it's fresh can be
[1:16:26] very very very very fresh
[1:16:29] after I videoed them
[1:16:32] the older owner there wanted to see the
[1:16:34] video the guy wiping the fish
[1:16:36] you wanted to see
[1:16:39] how we did it so this is the market this
[1:16:41] this is good turn our volume on
[1:16:46] Leo took me in the market to buy things
[1:16:48] we needed and I went back and said we
[1:16:50] should get brother Jim and sister Luanne
[1:16:53] and show them what grocery shopping
[1:16:55] looks like
[1:16:59] there's volume to this
[1:17:01] hello
[1:17:04] it's Leo talking to his friend
[1:17:10] I'm asking Leo to buy red onions no buy
[1:17:13] an onion oh okay okay I was showing one
[1:17:17] of the sisters that we helped
[1:17:19] and her son
[1:17:21] how to make a BLT
[1:17:23] they didn't they most of those people
[1:17:25] never seen a toaster in their life they
[1:17:27] would look in the toaster and see the
[1:17:29] fire in the toaster we bought Leo atosa
[1:17:32] the last time we were there
[1:17:34] and see tomatoes are readily available
[1:17:36] they have everything for a BLT except
[1:17:38] the bacon nobody has bacon because
[1:17:41] nobody goes to a grocery store that
[1:17:42] sells bacon because you'd have to go to
[1:17:44] the Capitol
[1:17:49] but we showed them a BLT oh yeah yeah
[1:17:52] there's pictures yep you're going
[1:17:55] missing
[1:17:56] so it's the kids by the church playing
[1:18:01] making the church yard their home
[1:18:06] that's that Deacon that was in the
[1:18:09] Sunday School room okay now we're at the
[1:18:11] orphanage are we we're not missing any
[1:18:13] are we girls
[1:18:15] okay this is that your orphanage this is
[1:18:17] the water tank from the well
[1:18:19] the building in the back to where the
[1:18:21] kids used to sleep that's the last
[1:18:22] school room that we helped them build
[1:18:26] um
[1:18:28] Jose's work actually sent money with
[1:18:30] Jose
[1:18:31] to uh to put floors down in the
[1:18:34] orphanage or put Windows in so you're
[1:18:37] going to see Jose that's their school
[1:18:39] desk mud floor
[1:18:41] and uh
[1:18:45] this is the one they just built since we
[1:18:47] were there the foundation was it that
[1:18:49] was the first Schoolhouse we built for
[1:18:51] them
[1:18:52] when we went the first time and the one
[1:18:54] on the left was the second one we built
[1:18:58] and their house is Straight Ahead where
[1:19:00] the owners and the workers work
[1:19:02] live I mean they have six kids
[1:19:05] themselves
[1:19:06] now we're out in front and they're
[1:19:08] showing them the well the water well
[1:19:11] that's a focus point
[1:19:13] that water well we put in when we were
[1:19:16] there six years ago after we came home
[1:19:18] and that's the water well that the
[1:19:20] government seen all the people from The
[1:19:22] Jungle came and got water from
[1:19:25] and they said because you're letting
[1:19:27] people from the jungle
[1:19:29] Countryside get water we'll put
[1:19:31] electricity into your house for free so
[1:19:34] you can pump the water in the well
[1:19:36] so they got the wires to their house for
[1:19:38] free now they only have to pay for what
[1:19:40] they use Pastor Leo's hydro bill
[1:19:42] electricity bill for his house he was
[1:19:44] really complaining was three dollars and
[1:19:47] forty cents Canadian per month
[1:19:50] three dollars and forty cents
[1:19:53] per month
[1:19:55] uh I told them things were a little
[1:19:57] different here
[1:20:00] don't miss any if you can help it if we
[1:20:03] don't get done we'll do it later this is
[1:20:05] a pigs out front of the orphanage and
[1:20:07] the next picture I think Pastor Leo's
[1:20:09] going or Pastor Jose is going closer to
[1:20:11] investigate there's Pastor Jose
[1:20:14] and now he's teaching the kids
[1:20:18] they're very good education system
[1:20:23] uh there they were the kids were just
[1:20:26] finished and eating
[1:20:27] of course the main food is rice and
[1:20:30] Maize
[1:20:31] corn field corn
[1:20:35] or cassava
[1:20:38] oh they were eating beans there today
[1:20:39] well that was a blessing
[1:20:43] all mud floors if it looks like concrete
[1:20:45] it's not
[1:20:48] it might be concrete soon
[1:20:53] the different ones were filling out a
[1:20:55] visitor's book
[1:21:00] you know that's the kids at the church
[1:21:02] that's right
[1:21:11] this is still in the the market the food
[1:21:13] market we've got volume
[1:21:16] very important to have volume voice
[1:21:19] missed the whole video
[1:21:30] most of those people in that market
[1:21:32] would make less than a dollar Canadian
[1:21:34] all day
[1:21:36] if you had a regular job you make two
[1:21:37] dollars
[1:21:41] one dollar
[1:21:43] thank you ah wait thank you Pastor Leo
[1:21:46] showed me his receipt we might get to
[1:21:48] that or might not no he didn't work this
[1:21:50] much in February he actually showed me
[1:21:52] three pay stubs there's this brother
[1:21:54] Jim's sister and I want them to
[1:21:55] experience it uh going through the
[1:21:58] market too but for the month of
[1:22:01] February Oscar Leo made 100 and
[1:22:07] sixty seven dollars Canadian
[1:22:10] for the month
[1:22:11] and he's paid
[1:22:14] four times as high as the regular work
[1:22:16] like he's fourth in command I think at
[1:22:18] the T fact there's this sort the watches
[1:22:20] video that you'll see them sewn you
[1:22:22] played again I didn't see his feet move
[1:22:23] watch his feet move this is right out
[1:22:26] from Leo's house
[1:22:29] yeah that's amazing you see his feet
[1:22:30] move
[1:22:31] we went and bought uh clothes and linen
[1:22:36] in another town and there was just
[1:22:39] dozens of these sewing machines all
[1:22:41] pumped 100 Pump no electricity
[1:22:43] I said man we throw these out and they
[1:22:45] said man if you can get them to us
[1:22:47] they would just love us
[1:22:50] yep sound sounds important
[1:22:53] this is just going down the road to show
[1:22:55] you that the country is mountainous
[1:22:57] very mountainous
[1:23:01] mountains everywhere
[1:23:13] yeah I mean you just go through them
[1:23:14] fast these are the orphanage we won't
[1:23:17] listen to any videos in the orphanage
[1:23:19] the videos were just Jose given the
[1:23:21] money Jose had to have a video hey these
[1:23:24] people here these these kids in the
[1:23:26] orphaning just go back there they come
[1:23:28] up to give me that candy
[1:23:31] they would give you everything they have
[1:23:34] like those kids probably don't even have
[1:23:36] parents
[1:23:37] let alone money or candy
[1:23:39] this is right in front of Dale's Dale's
[1:23:41] and his wife there every between Luanne
[1:23:44] and Jose
[1:23:45] they'll run the school and the orphanage
[1:23:48] that's their house right behind it
[1:23:51] yeah
[1:23:54] he's he's like a trustee or something
[1:23:56] for brother Leo's church
[1:23:58] this is just the yard the kids were
[1:24:00] getting ready to leave
[1:24:02] this was Wednesday night in Leo's church
[1:24:04] and it looks empty and there's a reason
[1:24:05] why they had a torrential flood
[1:24:09] literally the hour before church I mean
[1:24:11] torrential flood there was Rivers
[1:24:13] running across the road it we almost had
[1:24:17] to snorkel to get out of the we were at
[1:24:18] the orphanage
[1:24:20] and there was water running across the
[1:24:21] road two feet wide
[1:24:23] and of course everybody comes to church
[1:24:25] on motorbike or walk
[1:24:27] so they would have had wet
[1:24:29] everything
[1:24:32] I think we've seen this one or it's a
[1:24:34] scene
[1:24:38] so Wednesday was a small service
[1:24:43] you're missing a video or not
[1:24:46] oh okay okay yeah that's uh this is
[1:24:49] Lumber and the Chinese are going to
[1:24:51] Uganda and cutting down taking a lot of
[1:24:53] the lumber and Leo wasn't happy about
[1:24:55] this this is Pastor Vincent go back to
[1:24:57] there the picture Pastor Vincent we just
[1:24:59] arrived at his church we're walking
[1:25:00] right up to the front door of his church
[1:25:02] to 100 clay the only thing that's not
[1:25:05] clay in that church is the tin on the
[1:25:07] roof
[1:25:09] there's brother Jim this is the way into
[1:25:10] this well other than the wooden door and
[1:25:12] what's holding the tin that's a house
[1:25:14] right beside the church
[1:25:16] Pastor Lee Jose going in the church this
[1:25:19] is the pastor in front of his pulpit if
[1:25:22] there's a video there's a video for this
[1:25:24] that's the sisters this is where they
[1:25:26] took off their shoes and so we all
[1:25:28] greeted them
[1:25:29] we weren't able to stay here and
[1:25:30] Minister because we were on the way to
[1:25:32] pastor sandes and I preached there on
[1:25:35] Thursday
[1:25:36] this was us leaving there will be a
[1:25:38] video here we're just right in front of
[1:25:40] the church there's a video I need sound
[1:25:42] need sound
[1:25:46] now
[1:25:54] sorry it just mixed up that's all
[1:25:59] sorry these pictures are scrambled a bit
[1:26:01] but that's just
[1:26:04] what we had so this is still back to the
[1:26:07] church
[1:26:08] there is videos here of the church we'll
[1:26:10] listen to
[1:26:12] that's Pastor Vincent at his house uh
[1:26:15] there's a path there up to his house
[1:26:20] yeah and well actually if you go back to
[1:26:22] there it's cassava and banana trees he
[1:26:25] lives he lives off the land
[1:26:28] his income is whatever ties he gets in
[1:26:31] that little church
[1:26:33] and whatever grows in that field and the
[1:26:36] rest he don't eat
[1:26:39] it's a different experience
[1:26:41] when we left that's his house
[1:26:43] when we left he sent us food with us we
[1:26:46] still have beans at our place from his
[1:26:48] house now you'll notice I when I was
[1:26:50] going through I literally erased as many
[1:26:52] pictures as what we're showing you
[1:26:54] that's his wife coming out of the house
[1:26:55] and you go back to that picture I wanted
[1:26:57] to show you something Keith they're as
[1:26:59] happy as can be they're happier than
[1:27:02] happy
[1:27:05] but they don't have one penny to their
[1:27:07] name
[1:27:08] and they're living in a mud hut
[1:27:11] that's their children
[1:27:12] two bedroom two room total two-room
[1:27:15] house
[1:27:16] probably
[1:27:18] 10 by 20.
[1:27:21] uh 100 percent mud
[1:27:26] yeah 100 percent much
[1:27:29] yep
[1:27:30] this is okay so we left there we left
[1:27:33] there this is on Thursday we we drove a
[1:27:37] long ways and we're at Pastor Sandy's
[1:27:40] and the the two pastors that were close
[1:27:42] to Leo and US was Pastor Vincent and
[1:27:45] Pastor Sande were both with us when we
[1:27:47] had the accident three years ago and
[1:27:49] both are poor that's Pastor Sandy's
[1:27:52] church but they had these are other
[1:27:54] pastors that were there
[1:27:56] local close pastors and there's many
[1:27:59] many many many many people there and so
[1:28:01] there's a story behind this they're just
[1:28:03] it's it's a just completely different
[1:28:06] experience and I I I'd have to apologize
[1:28:09] to Leo and then I would be hard on them
[1:28:11] and then I'd have to apologize on them
[1:28:12] but when we're going to this place we
[1:28:15] arrived four hours late and like I just
[1:28:17] I just laid the line up I said Leo I
[1:28:20] don't arrive no place four hours late
[1:28:23] but you get here to these people and
[1:28:25] they're just like praising it's a
[1:28:27] four-hour worship service they're just
[1:28:28] thrilled you show up I preach for two
[1:28:31] hours boom like you were four hours late

[1:28:36] Jose we don't have to watch this at the
[1:28:38] orphanage we don't have to watch this uh
[1:28:42] I asked Pastor Jose I said you know if
[1:28:44] you invited me to preach and I showed up
[1:28:46] four hours late for service I said how
[1:28:48] would it go and he said well maybe I
[1:28:50] would still be here Dale
[1:28:52] but there there's 200 people sitting
[1:28:55] under a tarp in the sun 100 degrees you
[1:28:57] show up four hours late
[1:28:58] because you're the roads are bad

[1:29:02] other Pastor's house

[1:29:31] is Vincent but we're at Pastor Sandy's
[1:29:34] house and that was his first house which
[1:29:36] was mud we're out front
[1:29:39] um

[1:29:42] when we got to his house there were
[1:29:44] sisters there that he came over from the
[1:29:45] church to sing

[1:30:22] mud house is right beside the it's my
[1:30:24] house this was when we left there there
[1:30:26] was a public school
[1:30:27] and uh
[1:30:29] I rolled down the window
[1:30:31] and when they seen a fat white person
[1:30:33] they had a stampede to the fence
[1:30:35] literally a stampede to the fence
[1:30:38] back in the orphanage you can go through
[1:30:40] this one we're kind of done the
[1:30:42] orphanage
[1:30:47] okay this brother here actually just
[1:30:49] leave that there you just give me this
[1:30:50] here

[1:30:58] the camera before ever in his life
[1:31:01] taking a selfie of them
[1:31:04] one of Pastor Sandy's
[1:31:06] congregation
[1:31:09] that Pastor right there I would love to
[1:31:11] bring here
[1:31:12] just a fantastic brother
[1:31:15] wonderful brother
[1:31:26] this was a the motel we stayed uh on the
[1:31:30] way to on Thursday we're halfway to
[1:31:33] James's house we're four or four or five
[1:31:36] hours from leels and so we went and
[1:31:39] preached on Thursday at Sundays and we
[1:31:40] went to Vincent's church and we come
[1:31:43] back and we stayed in this motel and so
[1:31:45] we're eating at night
[1:31:47] and it's very different but so when you
[1:31:50] order fish you get the whole fish
[1:31:52] head and eyes and tail and
[1:31:55] brother Bernard knows what that's like
[1:31:56] but it's very different for us there was
[1:31:59] tons and tons and tons of food
[1:32:01] I don't remember what these rooms were
[1:32:03] but they weren't very much that's right
[1:32:06] you're doing good girls
[1:32:10] this is a gym drinking a Coke out of a
[1:32:12] glass jar
[1:32:14] oh now we've seen that one already
[1:32:23] that's the orphanage we don't need to go
[1:32:24] there right there yeah we'll go there
[1:32:27] yep
[1:32:28] so it's at the restaurant or the motel
[1:32:32] there was a sad thing this well I took
[1:32:34] this picture to see you can't really see
[1:32:36] but this is a very fancy motel but they
[1:32:39] just have a really botchy roof on the
[1:32:42] top of that square thing it's just tin
[1:32:44] and boards and it looks like something
[1:32:46] on a barn that's just about ready to
[1:32:48] fall down on a brand new Motel
[1:32:51] okay this year it was a sad part of the
[1:32:53] trip I mean for me it was this was the
[1:32:56] World Health Organization there
[1:32:58] there's a bunch of robbers and they're
[1:33:01] spending all the world tax money
[1:33:03] driving around Uganda to needle people
[1:33:06] so they'll die and this was all their
[1:33:08] brand new trucks that they drive
[1:33:10] I'll show you a lot more
[1:33:13] yeah these are all the trucks
[1:33:19] and there's their emblem
[1:33:22] for the devil
[1:33:24] they're not there to help the people
[1:33:26] they're there to kill the people
[1:33:28] this was a food buffet in the line
[1:33:35] and just more driving
[1:33:38] okay on the way to James's we're getting
[1:33:40] close to the national park and so the
[1:33:43] bamboo and the monkeys are right on the
[1:33:44] road there bamboo
[1:33:47] we're actually passing um
[1:33:52] okay okay the one there that's out to
[1:33:55] the king in that region they still have
[1:33:56] Regional Kings
[1:33:58] they really have no National Power
[1:34:02] but they are respected hugely this is
[1:34:05] we're going to James where Jose preached
[1:34:08] there the last Sunday we're there and
[1:34:10] and we're close to the national park and
[1:34:12] this was a prison that Leo actually had
[1:34:15] worked in before he he was pastor and
[1:34:18] started the church so these uh prisoners
[1:34:21] are on the side and I took a picture and
[1:34:23] Leo thought one of the guards had seen
[1:34:25] me and they weighed me over they're very
[1:34:26] private with any
[1:34:28] yeah they're very private with stuff
[1:34:30] like that you're going to see more
[1:34:32] coming
[1:34:34] yeah that we don't need to see that Amy
[1:34:36] move on
[1:34:40] um like these prisoner ones they don't
[1:34:42] want you to take videos and show them
[1:34:43] internationally
[1:34:44] cases you know they think you're
[1:34:46] mistreating them or anything like that
[1:34:49] okay you can go
[1:34:51] um
[1:34:53] so Leo had actually thought they'd waved
[1:34:55] them over but if they did we just went
[1:34:58] on and
[1:34:58] that so uh it's a river there even by
[1:35:03] when we come out of the park there was a
[1:35:05] bridge
[1:35:06] there's a bridge this is a motel by
[1:35:09] Pastor James where we preached the last
[1:35:11] Sunday there was a bridge outside the
[1:35:13] park and it's actually guarded with
[1:35:15] soldiers and they'll take your camera if
[1:35:17] you take a picture of it and they by
[1:35:20] this just sounds ridiculous to me but
[1:35:23] they think because I take a picture that
[1:35:25] I'm going to send it to Putin and
[1:35:26] Putin's going to go over and bomb the
[1:35:28] bridge so they don't want nobody to take
[1:35:29] a picture of it to do the location and I
[1:35:31] mean it was just a bridge that would be
[1:35:33] on a back Gravel Road it was

[1:41:35] 51 dollars
[1:41:37] for breakfast and air conditioning
[1:41:43] this was Pastor James's Church brother
[1:41:45] Jose preached there that's the last
[1:41:47] Sunday we were there

[1:41:50] we don't need to see this video
[1:41:53] you're back at the top I'm sorry this is
[1:41:55] so scrambled that's disappointing
[1:42:05] brother James's Church brother James has
[1:42:07] been here to Canada he's actually coming
[1:42:09] here this summer
[1:42:10] he's right we've heard him preach at
[1:42:12] John dankwas
[1:42:19] and so when we were at this church they
[1:42:22] were we went there
[1:42:24] I guess it wasn't that early but we had
[1:42:26] to leave there by around 12 because we
[1:42:29] were seven hours almost to the dot to
[1:42:32] get to Pastor leels
[1:42:34] um and we had to get there before dark
[1:42:36] because it's just not safe to drive
[1:42:44] oh my goodness these pictures are so
[1:42:48] scrambled
[1:42:49] unbelievable
[1:42:51] that's disappointing
[1:42:54] uh right there we'll play that video
[1:42:58] that's at brother Vincent's church
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:05] you turn it up some
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:12] okay
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:24] is there a video up above that one no
[1:43:28] sorry
[1:43:29] oh I'm sorry yeah okay yeah so that's a
[1:43:32] family we were able to assist that's
[1:43:34] actually the money I give them this is a
[1:43:36] house we're looking at the house before
[1:43:38] we leave
[1:43:39] uh you're just going
[1:43:44] that's Pastor that's their water at the
[1:43:46] church and he's washing his hands right
[1:43:48] outside the bathroom
[1:43:54] just showing the country is very
[1:43:55] mountainous very rolly
[1:43:59] oh this was our doctor that was a
[1:44:01] wonderful experience so when I went you
[1:44:04] know I had to be tested negative to go
[1:44:07] to Uganda the hilarious part is the only
[1:44:10] two countries in the world that care
[1:44:11] about it was Uganda I had to have a
[1:44:13] negative test because we're not
[1:44:14] vaccinated
[1:44:15] in America the only reason I had to get
[1:44:18] tested to come home was we landed in New
[1:44:21] York uh wait you're I'm missing the
[1:44:24] doctor part
[1:44:25] uh go back to the
[1:44:28] doctor that's that's the doctor the dirt
[1:44:30] test and he wants to at least visit here
[1:44:33] if he can't we're gonna try to help him
[1:44:36] some but uh
[1:44:39] the only reason we had to get a test to
[1:44:41] come home was because we landed in New
[1:44:42] York the states is was so ignorant the
[1:44:46] most ignorant place we were in the whole
[1:44:47] trip was New York and all the flight
[1:44:49] attendants that were stationed in New
[1:44:50] York
[1:44:51] if you talk to Lauren
[1:44:53] yeah we're just
[1:44:55] ignorant just disgusting and it was just
[1:44:59] unbelievable and of course Luanne didn't
[1:45:01] have to be tested because she's an
[1:45:02] American so really out of everybody it
[1:45:04] was only me they had to get it tested
[1:45:06] but Canada don't care now and of course
[1:45:09] but anyway this doctor when they did the
[1:45:11] test here they do it up your nose
[1:45:13] they don't they don't go far or nothing
[1:45:15] now sometimes they'll let you do it
[1:45:17] yourself but there they just had a Q-tip
[1:45:19] and they just touched either side of
[1:45:21] your tongue and they just started to
[1:45:22] think here they needed 24 hours to get
[1:45:24] the results there he did that test we
[1:45:27] went to the motel and we had it or the
[1:45:29] mall we had the results in two hours
[1:45:32] it was unbelievable like like we're
[1:45:34] Advanced then they're like light years
[1:45:37] ahead of us
[1:45:38] you know it was like that doctor was
[1:45:41] just a what we wanted to hug him when we
[1:45:43] left he was really nice
[1:45:46] but now going there was a complete
[1:45:49] nightmare we
[1:45:52] if you ever go on a roundabout in Uganda
[1:45:55] in the capital city and around the boat
[1:45:58] the motorcycles drove so close to Leo's
[1:46:01] van that the engine of the motorcycle
[1:46:02] actually scrapped his van scraped his
[1:46:04] van like they just
[1:46:06] they just
[1:46:08] yeah it's just it's just you just have
[1:46:11] no hair left
[1:46:13] you either want to kill somebody or get
[1:46:15] killed yourself yeah this was just a
[1:46:18] sign of the
[1:46:19] thing
[1:46:21] this was we'll just go through that this
[1:46:24] is Leo's pay stubby actually showed me
[1:46:25] three months pay stuff we've seen this

[1:50:37] this morning
[1:50:39] just a few of these I haven't been
[1:50:41] sorted through but
[1:50:44] so on Sunday after we preached Sunday
[1:50:47] they had a baptism they actually had
[1:50:49] planned they had two people ahead of
[1:50:52] time tell them they were going to be
[1:50:53] baptized
[1:50:54] when they asked after we preached I
[1:50:57] think seven total
[1:50:59] I think seven came up after
[1:51:03] um
[1:51:03] and I baptized them
[1:51:06] and Leo has a tank there and I was just
[1:51:10] about to get in the band
[1:51:12] and they come out and they said we have
[1:51:14] a bunch more come up and I believe I
[1:51:15] counted in the pictures
[1:51:17] we won't probably get that far today but
[1:51:20] I believe we baptized 15 total
[1:51:23] on Sunday so they just there was going
[1:51:26] to be two done and then seven came and
[1:51:28] then when the seven got done
[1:51:30] there was like another nine or ten team
[1:51:34] we're showing some of these double
[1:51:37] actually there's a I want to see that
[1:51:39] yeah these two they're right tear them

[1:52:07] that one there yep Leo actually walked
[1:52:09] up to her house we were going to go up
[1:52:10] to her house you can see the money in
[1:52:12] her hand there she was one of the very
[1:52:13] first Believers that was with Leo even
[1:52:15] when they started the church they
[1:52:17] actually started in her house
[1:52:19] and uh she's she's old geez
[1:52:26] lady is

[1:52:33] anyway that was love offerings from
[1:52:36] pastor
[1:52:39] um
[1:52:41] I don't think we need to watch that
[1:52:44] we can watch that if you want
[1:52:48] yeah or just we need sound
[1:52:55] just sounds we're just leaving here now
[1:53:00] good
[1:53:12] including that we can probably stop that
[1:53:15] video there girls I don't know if
[1:53:18] there's some other videos was there
[1:53:19] another video up above no up above
[1:53:22] up right what's that one that at the

[1:54:18] James he's actually coming here in
[1:54:20] September
[1:54:22] um he's a full seven hours from Leo
[1:54:24] which he thinks very hard to travel
[1:54:26] the roads are just a nightmare
[1:54:32] but it was a wonderful experience
[1:54:36] I'm sorry the pictures were scrambled
[1:54:38] that was because I had to put them on
[1:54:40] Facebook but
[1:54:41] I hope you'll believe me that the
[1:54:43] pictures don't do it justice the
[1:54:45] difference between being there
[1:54:47] and actually seeing it is huge but we
[1:54:51] were able to
[1:54:53] different situations help them out and
[1:54:59] try to improve
[1:55:03] their example
[1:55:06] hey man that will just close with that
