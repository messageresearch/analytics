[9:19] &gt;&gt; Short testimony.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; About three years ago, sharing some
[9:24] brothers this most of you know. Um about
[9:27] three years ago, I had brother John De.
[9:30] God bless you. God bless you. Um I had
[9:33] uh I had a heart attack actually. I was
[9:35] in the hospital, chest pains. Went to
[9:37] the hospital while I was there. Heart
[9:39] stopped three times. They brought me
[9:41] back, rushed me to Windsor, put a stent
[9:43] in. Here I am. And I just had a
[9:47] yearly checkup last week, and the doc
[9:50] told me, he says, "You're fine. You're
[9:52] good."
[9:54] [Applause]
[9:56] And I got to tell you this, the best the
[9:58] best of it is about a year ago when I
[9:59] had a test. I get a yearly test every
[10:01] year. So, but uh the doctor after he
[10:04] checked it all, he says, "It looks like
[10:06] you never had it. A
[10:08] &gt;&gt; heart attack."
[10:09] It's God's grace.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:20] When I am down
[10:23] and oh my soul so we
[10:29] troubles come

[11:02] so I can sit on mountain.
[11:08] You raise me up
[11:12] to walk on stormy seas.
[11:18] I am strong
[11:22] when I am on your shoulders.
[11:26] [Music]
[11:28] You raise me up
[11:31] to more than I can be.
[11:37] What if there is no life,
[11:42] &gt;&gt; no life without his hunger? Thank you.
[11:47] He's restless heart death
[11:52] so imperfectly.
[11:54] [Music]
[11:57] But when you come

[12:44] You raise me up as far to more than I
[12:50] can be.

[17:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Good thing. Good playing.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; I love it.

[17:31] Oh, I'm not as organized as you. Oh,
[17:34] &gt;&gt; you're ready.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Well, I was doing dishes. I was doing
[17:37] dishes. Not getting ready for this.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; So, well, I hate this. Now, we're going
[17:44] to kind of slow this down a little bit.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's okay.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's okay.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; And uh I don't know. Is this on? Maybe
[17:51] you can hear me.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; I was going to plug in.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Okay.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; We'll get there.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; We'll get there.
[18:01] I can find that.
[18:04] There we go. No, it isn't. Good grief.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; There we go.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the biggest trouble. She
[18:11] switched guitars to come up.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; She's got one at home she don't like to
[18:17] travel with and she switched guitars and
[18:20] now she thinks she's playing a toy.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; It's a big toy.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:28] Okay. Well, it has been amazing to be
[18:32] here so far.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; It It has. I have just loved every
[18:36] minute of this.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; And um I love meeting I've got a new
[18:41] friend, Ruth.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; I feel like I've got a new I feel like
[18:45] all of I mean, all of you are because we
[18:48] all have that one thing in common, don't
[18:49] we?
[18:50] &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:54] Um, so, um, this song is pretty slow and
[18:58] it's a newer song.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Is that going to stay on?
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Something feels funny. Um,
[19:05] this is a little bit newer song and a
[19:07] little bit out of my comfort zone,
[19:10] but uh, it's awesome words and
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; You know, um, we can grumble. Who likes
[19:19] to be around grumbly people?
[19:22] Well, God doesn't like it either.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God doesn't like that either.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; And um
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; So, the more thankful we are,
[19:30] &gt;&gt; the closer we we get to him.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; No matter what our circumstances,
[19:36] &gt;&gt; and it's hard in some circumstances,
[19:38] isn't it?
[19:38] &gt;&gt; It's hard. That's true.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Um it is. It's hard to be thankful.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; But the more we are, the closer he comes
[19:45] to us. And so if you want to stand in
[19:48] worship and raise your hands,
[19:51] &gt;&gt; just just do whatever you want to do in
[19:53] your worship here.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Um, so this song is called Gratitude.
[19:58] It's a newer song. I say newer, but it's
[20:01] probably about 5 years old. Um, but
[20:03] that's new to me.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; So this is Gratitude. And
[20:08] like I said, just bear with us. Just
[20:11] praise God.
[20:16] All my words fall short.
[20:21] I've got nothing new.
[20:25] How could I express
[20:30] all my gratitude?
[20:34] I could sing these songs
[20:38] as I often do.
[20:43] But every song must sing
[20:47] and you never knew.
[20:51] So I th my hands and praise you then and
[20:56] again.
[20:59] All that I have is a hallelu
[21:03] [Music]
[21:05] hallelu.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:09] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[21:12] nothing else for a king
[21:16] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[21:21] [Applause]
[21:22] [Music]
[21:23] Hallelujah.
[21:25] [Music]
[21:31] I've got one response.
[21:36] I've got just one news.
[21:39] [Applause]
[21:40] With my arms stretch wide,
[21:45] I will worship you.
[21:49] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[21:53] again and again.
[21:57] All that I have is
[22:03] hallelujah.
[22:07] And I know it's not much, but I have
[22:10] nothing else for a kiss
[22:14] except for a heart singing hallelu.
[22:18] [Music]
[22:21] Hallelujah.
[22:23] [Music]
[22:30] Great is thy faithfulness.
[22:35] Great is thy faithfulness.
[22:39] Great
[22:41] is thy faithfulness,
[22:44] Lord, unto me.
[22:50] Great
[22:52] is thy faithfulness.
[22:55] Great is thy faithfulness.
[22:59] Great is thy faithfulness.
[23:04] Lord unto me.
[23:09] So I throw up my hands, praise you again
[23:14] and again.
[23:17] All that I have is a hallelujah.
[23:20] [Music]
[23:28] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[23:30] nothing else if you're a king.
[23:35] Except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[23:41] [Music]
[23:52] [Applause]
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord God. Hallelujah.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Both all those songs. Those are just
[24:09] wonderful.

[32:19] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord God. Bless your
[32:21] servants of God that are represented
[32:23] here, the pastors, Lord God.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; We love you.
[32:30] We love you, Lord Jesus.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for the ones that
[32:35] caught the vision,
[32:38] &gt;&gt; helped prepare
[32:41] for this event.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; I'll take care of this event. The cooks,
[32:48] &gt;&gt; man. Bless my kids, Jesus.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you.

[33:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus name. Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. I'm
[33:10] going to ask the ministers to come up
[33:11] and stand behind me. We're going to get
[33:13] a picture because uh don't worry, the
[33:16] Holy Spirit won't leave this place if we
[33:18] move.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Um sometimes we get involved with our
[33:21] earthly food and we want to recognize
[33:24] history
[33:26] &gt;&gt; as our ministers. Brother Joe Bear, come
[33:28] on now.
[33:30] Amen. And uh we might have to graft
[33:35] Brother Junior in. Brother Junior's not
[33:38] able. You can come stand right behind
[33:39] me. Come and stand behind me. Maybe
[33:42] brother
[33:45] stand behind me. You want to get a
[33:48] picture?
[33:49] &gt;&gt; You know if the Lord terries
[33:53] some God might call me home. He might
[33:56] call one of us ministers home.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord carries maybe next year
[34:01] &gt;&gt; I might not be here,
[34:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:04] &gt;&gt; You might not be here.
[34:06] But we'll have the memories
[34:08] &gt;&gt; recorded in a picture.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; And then when we get over there, we'll
[34:12] recognize our young body and our
[34:14] theophony.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This ain't me.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; I'm a lot better when I was young.

[38:59] [Music]
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you happy to be a
[39:05] Christian this morning?
[39:07] to know him and his death, burial, and
[39:11] resurrection.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; It's a a privilege.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Excuse me just a minute as I set my
[39:19] timer up here.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; We don't need that.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; I was ministering I was ministering at a
[39:25] church uh the other weekend and I forgot
[39:29] to set my timer and I looked at my wife
[39:31] and I said, you know, give me the give
[39:33] me the sign when I start going too long.
[39:35] And then like a typical husband, I
[39:37] proceeded never to look at her again.
[39:43] [Music]
[39:44] &gt;&gt; But
[39:45] &gt;&gt; it's it's uh it's good to be with you
[39:48] and
[39:49] &gt;&gt; my goodness, just to hear the word last
[39:52] night and his power
[39:54] &gt;&gt; was just beautiful. And I
[39:57] &gt;&gt; I would get anything to have someone
[39:59] else ministering this morning.
[40:03] Uh, I feel like I'm in a a sandwich in
[40:05] between Brother Junior, an amazing
[40:08] minister, and then we got Brother
[40:10] Bartley just fantastic, wonderful gifts,
[40:13] and then here I am.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Stuck stuck in the middle with you.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And uh, you know, the but I'm grateful
[40:21] to be here with you. I appreciate the
[40:23] opportunity,
[40:25] the invitation just to share a little
[40:26] bit what's on my heart. My wife asked
[40:29] me, she said, "John, what are you going
[40:31] to talk on?" And I said, 'Well, I think
[40:33] I'm going to talk about the bride and
[40:36] realizing who she is.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; And she says, 'You know, that's what you
[40:39] always talk about.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; But, you know, there there are things
[40:44] that are that are important,
[40:47] &gt;&gt; you know, and there's a there's a
[40:49] mystery tied to that that when the bride
[40:50] realizes who she is
[40:53] &gt;&gt; and that she can do the greater works
[40:55] that she'll be an invincible army. Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, part of the call of
[40:59] ministry is is to help the bride
[41:01] understand who she is. And so, we'll
[41:02] turn first of all to the book of
[41:04] Jeremiah
[41:06] and chapter 24. We'll just read one
[41:08] scripture and then we'll let you have
[41:10] your seats.
[41:13] Just give me a amen when you get there.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of amens yet.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; All right. Jeremiah chapter 24, we're
[41:28] just going to read verse 7. This is God
[41:30] speaking. He says, "I will give them a
[41:32] heart to know me,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; that I am the Lord,
[41:36] &gt;&gt; and they shall be my people, and I will
[41:38] be their God,
[41:40] &gt;&gt; for they shall return unto me with their
[41:42] whole heart."
[41:44] &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus just bless the
[41:46] reading of his word as you have your
[41:47] seats this morning.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Bless him. I love this
[41:51] scripture because we he's given us a
[41:53] heart to know him. He's given us a heart
[41:55] to to uh to understand him, to know who
[42:00] he is, not just in the Old Testament or
[42:04] not just through the apostles, not just
[42:06] through uh Luther and Wesley and the the
[42:10] church ages, not through just brother
[42:12] Brandham, but through through usmen,
[42:16] &gt;&gt; through who you are. That's the the
[42:18] mystery of God that that was supposed to
[42:20] be finished in the book of Revelation
[42:22] told us the Godhead. But the greater
[42:24] mystery is that it also revealed to us
[42:26] who we are as part of him
[42:28] &gt;&gt; that we were always with him, always in
[42:30] him.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; And uh that's right.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Uh and so I I want to I I want us to
[42:36] recognize that that who who we are in
[42:39] him and our position in Jesus Christ and
[42:41] what we the authority that we have.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And God's given us a heart to know him.
[42:46] But I want a I want a heart to see him
[42:48] in you.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; I want a I want a heart to see him in
[42:51] me.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to I want to understand
[42:54] what God can do through this broken
[42:56] carnal flesh that every day fights the
[43:00] you know we say we put the old man on
[43:02] the on the altar, you know, as a
[43:03] sacrifice. And every I don't know about
[43:05] you, but every day my old man jumps off
[43:07] the sacrifice right away. You know, he
[43:09] doesn't like being sacrificed at all.
[43:13] But uh you you know we're we're called
[43:16] to live a life
[43:17] &gt;&gt; a life of separation, a life of of
[43:20] suffering just like he did.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Um there if you're living a Christian
[43:24] life and you have no suffering, you have
[43:26] no pain, you have no hurts, you have no
[43:29] troubles, no battles, I I want I will I
[43:32] question your experience
[43:34] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said in this world you
[43:36] shall have troubles.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; The word says that. And so, you know, I
[43:40] think we do go through times where
[43:42] things are smooth and everything, but
[43:44] I'll admit, you know, when things start
[43:46] going really smooth for me, then I start
[43:48] getting nervous. I know I know big
[43:50] trials coming right around the corner.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[43:54] &gt;&gt; let me get to back to my notes here.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; It's uh it's good to be with you.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; It really truly is. And to see the the
[44:04] different ministry represented here. Any
[44:06] one of you should be up here rather than
[44:08] me. And I I really truly believe that as
[44:10] a as a minister that we're servants of
[44:12] God.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Not just servants of God, but servants
[44:15] of his children.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I don't like that that
[44:19] we ever really put somebody up on a on a
[44:21] pedestal. Like, we we appreciate their
[44:23] gifts. We appreciate what they do for
[44:25] the body, but there's no great ones
[44:28] among us. We're all equal. And if
[44:31] anything, the ministry is less than.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're here to serve, not to
[44:37] be served.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; And so we we want to take the burden and
[44:41] the sacrifice of for the people and and
[44:44] work for you.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; To help you along the way. And so I just
[44:48] pray that a little bit of what I might
[44:50] say here might speak to each one of you.
[44:52] Um
[44:54] God God knows where each one of us are
[44:56] at. Now, I don't know where where you're
[44:58] at, but if something is said that would
[45:01] strike your heart, I just pray that you
[45:02] would take that and accept it as as for
[45:04] you. And, you know, if the shoe fits,
[45:07] wear it.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And um
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, I think we'll all get
[45:11] along just fine that way.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't have to be we don't
[45:15] have to be on our guard
[45:16] &gt;&gt; around believers. You know, we really
[45:18] don't. We unfortunately many times we
[45:21] do. We we're just we're on guard. We
[45:23] don't really reveal all of our self to
[45:25] one another. We we hold things back, you
[45:28] know, the the things that are unloly and
[45:30] uncumbly. We we don't tell one another
[45:32] because we don't want people to think
[45:34] ill of us. But, you know, that's the
[45:35] exact opposite of what the Bible
[45:37] teaches,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; that we're supposed to share our burdens
[45:39] with one another, that we're supposed to
[45:42] uh disclose our faults and failures to
[45:44] one another so we can bear one another's
[45:46] burdens. Yeah.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, it's like it's kind of
[45:49] like social media today that everybody
[45:52] puts their perfect stuff on there, you
[45:54] know, all all the best pictures, the the
[45:56] pictures of the best looking food, the
[45:59] nicest outfits, the nicest dress, you
[46:02] know, beautiful sunsets, and and it it
[46:04] creates this illusion of a perfect life.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And I don't have a perfect life.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; I don't think that any of you have a
[46:13] perfect life. So, we don't have to
[46:15] pretend around one another
[46:17] &gt;&gt; that we're all here struggling together.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And so, while we're here, let's just uh
[46:23] &gt;&gt; let's just relax ourselves in this time.
[46:25] You know, I'm standing here in a in my
[46:28] nicest suit
[46:29] &gt;&gt; and I and I'm standing here and the
[46:31] thought that goes through my mind is I
[46:33] am totally overdressed
[46:36] for this.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; I'm totally over You know, but we get
[46:40] stuck in traditions and for inmalism,
[46:42] don't we? We get stuck in, oh, you need
[46:45] to have the three-piece suit on to
[46:47] ministry. You have to have a white shirt
[46:48] and a tie and and a jacket. But, you
[46:50] know, Brother Brand had uh humble nights
[46:52] at the tabernacle.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody come in just their normal
[46:56] clothes. You know, if you were a
[46:57] mechanic, you'd come in your overalls
[46:59] and, you know, if you were a baker,
[47:01] you'd wear your apron. And and we just
[47:04] would realize we're all just like one
[47:06] another. We're just people struggling to
[47:07] make a living and to raise our families,
[47:10] you know, united under the banner of
[47:12] love. Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; And so I want you to be free today. I
[47:15] want you to be to be free that you don't
[47:18] have to be locked up.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be guarded and
[47:21] reserved.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Get to know one another.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Have a little bit of fellowship.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Because there there the the Bible tells
[47:30] us there's no Jew, no Gentile, no free,
[47:33] no bound, no educated, no uneducated.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; No black, no white, no African, no
[47:40] Canadian. We are all God's children.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the attitude we need to have
[47:49] all the time.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And so tomorrow when I come to service
[47:53] since I won't be preaching,
[47:56] &gt;&gt; I plan on wearing jeans and boots
[47:59] &gt;&gt; and I'm just going to be uh I'm going to
[48:01] have humble Sunday.
[48:04] [Music]
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just I just want you to be free to
[48:08] say God bless you. To say
[48:12] or or uh what's the what's the French um
[48:16] uh
[48:17] &gt;&gt; duv right?
[48:19] &gt;&gt; So there we go. We can all say it.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; You know Jesus said that in John 8:36
[48:26] that if the son therefore shall make you
[48:28] free,
[48:29] &gt;&gt; you're free indeed.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And so there's no need to be bound up.
[48:33] There's no need to have tension and and
[48:36] not be relaxed and just enjoy yourselves
[48:39] in the presence of God. And that's what
[48:41] we're here to do today is just to enjoy
[48:43] ourselves in the presence of God to hear
[48:45] a little bit of his word
[48:46] &gt;&gt; to bask under the anointing of his
[48:49] presence to go out, have a meal
[48:51] together, fellowship, and then do it
[48:52] again this evening. And it's just a
[48:54] wonderful time in the in the presence of
[48:56] the Lord.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And now I'll start my timer.
[49:00] [Laughter]
[49:04] They that know me know that I struggle
[49:07] with this.
[49:09] Yeah. I was thinking I was thinking as I
[49:11] was studying that as we grow older in
[49:13] the Lord, we find that there are many
[49:14] things that still bind us
[49:17] &gt;&gt; that must be walked away from. You know,
[49:19] when we're young in the Lord, we we
[49:21] become sanctified. when we give up the
[49:24] the smoking and the drinking and the
[49:26] fornication and and those obvious things
[49:29] that are that are incompatible with the
[49:31] scripture and Christian life. And some
[49:34] of us were freed from pornography, from
[49:36] addictions and and vices.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And as you began to grow in the Lord,
[49:42] you began to let go of these these
[49:44] things of the world that pulled on your
[49:45] flesh,
[49:46] &gt;&gt; and you began to live a good Christian
[49:48] life. Now, I turned 47 here in just a a
[49:53] short little time. I just retired from
[49:55] my first career, and I feel like I'm
[49:58] getting to that point where Brother
[50:00] Brandham said that if you're going to do
[50:02] something from the Lord, you better do
[50:03] it now. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And I've I've come to realize that even
[50:08] as I've I've known this message now
[50:10] going going on 25 27 years uh that
[50:15] there's still more of myself
[50:18] &gt;&gt; in chains and bondage.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; That there's more of myself that that
[50:22] needs deliverance. That there are more
[50:24] things that I need to lay down
[50:26] &gt;&gt; that are the small things.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Bitterness and pain from my past. They
[50:31] need I need to lay lay down anger and
[50:33] attitudes,
[50:35] &gt;&gt; the things that we we allow them to be
[50:37] in our life. And sometimes we justify
[50:39] them.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; We justify because we've been hurt by
[50:42] people. We justify because our parents
[50:44] hurt us or or we've struggled in life
[50:47] and and we've we've questioned the why.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; And we've developed attitudes and and
[50:52] even attitudes towards God and our
[50:54] situation instead of being content
[50:56] wherewith we find ourselves.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. And so there comes a point in
[51:00] our life where it's no longer about
[51:02] getting rid of the big things. Not that
[51:04] there is any great sin or little sin.
[51:07] It's all sin.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; But to we it's easy to get rid of the
[51:10] things that that you expect to get rid
[51:13] of as a Christian to to stop going to
[51:15] bars, to stop gambling, to stop doing,
[51:18] you know, these these things that the
[51:19] world loves and enjoys. But then we have
[51:21] to start focusing on refining on God
[51:24] refining our inner man.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; It's easy. It's easy to clean up the
[51:28] outside.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people come to church and
[51:31] they clean up the outside
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and have no revelation on the inside.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would rather a person come to
[51:37] church, struggle, be be here in a bikini
[51:41] or half naked or whatever and still come
[51:44] and hear the word of God. And I wouldn't
[51:46] judge that person for where they were.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot. But I look out at you
[51:52] and you look at me and and we begin to
[51:54] realize that even if we've been in this
[51:56] message for a long time, that there are
[51:57] things that are inside of us that must
[52:00] be let go.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; That that if we if we are going to
[52:03] continue to grow into the stature and
[52:05] image of the perfect man that there are
[52:08] besetting sins,
[52:09] &gt;&gt; right,
[52:10] &gt;&gt; that we have to be delivered from,
[52:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And those can be attitudes.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; It can be bitterness. It can be
[52:17] resentment towards our parents or
[52:19] resentment towards situations in life.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; And I I would I would tell you that this
[52:25] morning that that the bonds that hold
[52:27] you today, the the the little things as
[52:30] you examine your life in your daily
[52:31] prayers and you see you see where you
[52:33] struggle with these these small small
[52:36] things
[52:37] &gt;&gt; and how much they hold you back that God
[52:40] has set you free.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; You are free now.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only bondage that you
[52:46] are in is the bondage that you allow
[52:49] yourself to be in.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Because who the son has set free is free
[52:54] indeed.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; And so we don't want to remain under
[52:57] under a self-inflicted or self-imposed
[53:00] slavery,
[53:01] &gt;&gt; a self-imposed bondage to sin.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. to to wallow in attitudes
[53:07] &gt;&gt; and bitterness and allow those things to
[53:10] to manipulate our life's course
[53:12] &gt;&gt; where we're always reactive to people
[53:15] expecting them to say the worst things
[53:16] about us
[53:18] &gt;&gt; that that we're reactive to people and
[53:19] think that they're going to talk about
[53:20] us behind our back and so we don't we
[53:22] don't speak with them we don't
[53:24] fellowship with them we we withhold
[53:26] ourselves from them
[53:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[53:28] &gt;&gt; but we're withholding ourselves from the
[53:30] body of the Lord
[53:33] &gt;&gt; and so I would tell you that those
[53:34] chains are only placed there by you.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Once you have been delivered by Calvary,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; you are free.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; You are free.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if it may take time
[53:46] for those chains to fall away as you let
[53:49] them go,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; but the moment you come to Calvary and
[53:52] you give yourself to the Lord Jesus
[53:54] Christ,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; you are completely totally free. Amen.
[53:58] Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; The problem is is that so many times we
[54:01] walk away from the cross and we say we
[54:03] we lay our burdens down and we lay our
[54:04] chains down. We say, "Thank you, Lord.
[54:06] I'm free. We praise and we worship." And
[54:08] then we get up off of our knees and we
[54:10] just pick the chains back up and we just
[54:12] take them right along with us as we go.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you that you don't
[54:16] have to do that this morning.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm grateful for freedom to worship.
[54:24] I'm grateful. I I was in Africa here not
[54:27] too long ago in in Nigeria ministering
[54:29] and I just loved how the people there,
[54:31] you know, they they they were so
[54:33] completely free in their worship
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and in their freedom. You know, in in
[54:38] the in the states where I'm from, you
[54:40] know, the further south you go, the
[54:42] freer you get.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Southern southern people are a whole lot
[54:47] more free than Yankees uh up in the
[54:50] north. Right. And
[54:51] &gt;&gt; so, you know, you cross into into Canada
[54:53] and some of that starchiness is still
[54:55] there. And it's just like, no, let's
[54:56] just worship and have a good time. Let's
[54:59] just enjoy the presence of God and the
[55:01] good things he has for us. And let's not
[55:02] be afraid to raise our hands and and,
[55:05] you know, I don't care if I' I've got a
[55:08] nice suit on or not. You know, if I feel
[55:10] like a worshiping God down in the straw
[55:12] pile, then praise the Lord. I'll get
[55:14] down in the straw pile. It'll be all
[55:15] right.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Suits can get dry cleaned.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brandham said, I love
[55:22] this. In in that day on Calvary, 1960,
[55:24] he says, "He broke the powers of Satan.
[55:28] Every freedom that could ever be offered
[55:30] to you, as I said, was given to you that
[55:32] day on Calvary."
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's the work's already done.
[55:36] So, he broke the powers of Satan. He
[55:38] opened the prison doors of hell to every
[55:40] man that was shut up in this earth in
[55:42] the prisons, fearing that when he died,
[55:45] what death would be to him. on Calvary,
[55:48] he opened those cell doors and let every
[55:50] captive go free.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Ray, it says you do not have to
[55:54] no longer be torn down by sin.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what sin does is it tears you
[56:00] down.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; It takes you away from your heavenly
[56:03] position and and your your position of
[56:05] authority in Christ.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And you recognize that you fall short.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And so and when you fall short, you lose
[56:12] confidence in who you are.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I was a How many times has the
[56:16] devil told you, "Well, if you were a
[56:18] Christian, you wouldn't act this way. If
[56:20] you were a true believer, you wouldn't
[56:21] have never done that. What's wrong with
[56:23] you?"
[56:24] &gt;&gt; And so, the devil's all the time
[56:26] whispering in our ears. And and I don't
[56:27] know about you, but most of the time, if
[56:29] he's not whispering in my ear, my own
[56:31] conscience is whispering in my ear.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; But the thing is is God has set us free.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; That I don't have, we don't have to be
[56:40] torn down by sin. Yeah,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; we have an option
[56:45] &gt;&gt; to overcome.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; We have an option to live above it
[56:49] &gt;&gt; a choice to be made.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Every day we we are challenged to make
[56:54] choices on how we will act and react to
[56:56] things. How we will how we will uh
[56:59] choose to behave towards someone else.
[57:03] whether or not we're going to recognize
[57:04] the Christ in that person,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; whether or not we're going to fellowship
[57:08] with that person, whether or not we're
[57:10] going to do the dishes for our wives, or
[57:11] whether or not we're going to fill up
[57:13] her car with gas. I never I never seem
[57:16] to do that.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on, he says, "You
[57:20] don't have to no longer yield your
[57:23] members to sin,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; to drinking, smoking, gambling, telling
[57:29] lies."
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; And maybe I would just say it like this.
[57:32] You no longer have to yield yourself
[57:35] &gt;&gt; to bondage.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Even in this message,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; even in this word, we can be placed
[57:41] under bondage.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I And I don't know about you, but the
[57:44] more that that I've traveled, the more
[57:46] that I've been exposed to in ministry,
[57:48] the the more bondage I see people in who
[57:52] are supposed to be free.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you run across things
[57:57] that just they're not scriptural,
[57:59] they're not right, they're not balanced,
[58:00] they're not even in the message. And I'm
[58:02] talking about
[58:03] &gt;&gt; things that are so legalistic that they
[58:06] just don't make sense.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Like, and if you disagree with me, you
[58:11] feel free to disagree with me. It's
[58:12] okay. I I I can take a punch. But, you
[58:14] know, like there there are things where
[58:16] people say that men cannot have this
[58:18] kind of a a pocket on their trousers
[58:22] &gt;&gt; that needs to be in line with the sea. I
[58:25] there there are people in this message
[58:27] that believe that a woman who wears a
[58:29] jean skirt cannot have a zipper in the
[58:31] front because that looks like a man. It
[58:34] needs to be in the back and she can't
[58:37] have pockets on her skirt because that's
[58:39] going to somehow attract the men's gaze.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And it's like no that there there's
[58:44] other problems here.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; There's other problems here. What that
[58:47] is is somebody trying to control a
[58:49] situation, control a person where you
[58:52] can't even go and buy a vehicle unless
[58:54] you consult the pastor.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You can't court a girl unless you go and
[58:58] consult the pastor. That's bondage.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; It should not exist within our ranks.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you can be honest.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You can be just and upright.
[59:15] We don't have to be to be in these kinds
[59:18] of conditions.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; We don't have to accept this this
[59:22] reality that people would place upon us.
[59:25] The reality that the Satan would place
[59:26] upon us.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Right. There you go.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; He says you can be honest. Just not just
[59:31] honest with other people, but you can be
[59:32] honest with yourself.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; You can be honest between you and God. I
[59:36] don't know why people want to lie to God
[59:38] anyway.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows everything. And and
[59:43] people people go to prayer and that, oh
[59:46] Lord God, forgive me of my wrong things
[59:50] that I've done, you know, and just
[59:52] &gt;&gt; help me, Lord, not to commit those wrong
[59:54] things again. And don't even want to
[59:56] admit what they've done.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Don't even want to admit that they
[1:00:00] lusted or or or done told lies or done
[1:00:04] something. They're too afraid to be
[1:00:06] honest with God to even admit what
[1:00:08] they've done, to call it a sin. God
[1:00:10] doesn't forget. God does not forgive you
[1:00:13] doing something wrong,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; God forgives sin.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Sin and everything that is not like him
[1:00:22] is sin.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful that we have a blood
[1:00:27] that's been applied a token to raise
[1:00:30] over our houses, over our families, and
[1:00:32] over our lives that shows and proves
[1:00:35] that we've been forgiven. Brother
[1:00:37] Brandham says he says you can be honest,
[1:00:40] just and upright and Satan can do
[1:00:42] nothing about it.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; He cannot do a thing about it
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; when you're this way. When you walk this
[1:00:49] type of a life, he can't touch you.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the point that we
[1:00:54] want to get to is where we walk in such
[1:00:56] a life that when we get up out of bed,
[1:00:58] the devils tremble.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; That you know all the devils that are
[1:01:02] arraigned against us as believers.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thousands and thousands of of
[1:01:08] demon powers focused just on this bride,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; on this church, upon this revelation
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; ready to distract you, to make you
[1:01:17] stumble and fall, to provide you
[1:01:19] opportunities to sin.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; When you get up out of bed every
[1:01:24] morning, Satan should be trembled.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Not him again.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Not her again.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, there she Isn't it funny to think
[1:01:33] about it? It's funny to think about it.
[1:01:34] the devils would tremble at you.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That when you get up out of bed and
[1:01:39] they're just ready, they're just ready.
[1:01:41] They, "Oh, it's a new day. I'm going to
[1:01:43] get him today. I'm going to get him
[1:01:44] today." And then the first thing you do
[1:01:46] when you slide out of bed is you you you
[1:01:48] don't get up. Maybe you set up on the
[1:01:50] edge of bed and you kind of stretch or
[1:01:51] the devil's the devil's stretching. It's
[1:01:53] like,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; "Going to get him today. Going to get
[1:01:56] him today." And then you just kind of
[1:01:58] lie down off the edge of your bed and
[1:02:00] you get down on your knees
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; and you start praying for the day. Oh
[1:02:04] yeah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; The devil's just like,
[1:02:07] "I don't like it. I thought I was going
[1:02:09] to get them and here they are. They're
[1:02:11] already fighting me."
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's the life
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; where you can live
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; and be honest and just
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; and Satan can do nothing against you.
[1:02:21] Can do nothing to stop you. No weapon
[1:02:24] formed against you shall prosper.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? Brother brother
[1:02:28] brother Brando says why? because you
[1:02:30] have got a hold of a life a line a
[1:02:34] lifeline that's anchored in the rock of
[1:02:36] ages.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing can shake you from it. No
[1:02:40] wind can shake you from it. No, nothing,
[1:02:43] not even death itself can separate us
[1:02:46] from the love of God that is in Christ
[1:02:48] Jesus. That's what Calvary meant. Amen.
[1:02:51] Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm certain that uh if you're
[1:02:54] anything like me that as you prepared to
[1:02:56] come to camp this service even that that
[1:02:58] the enemy was attacking you. And now
[1:03:00] here we are in service and and we've
[1:03:02] sung the songs of Zion and we've
[1:03:04] worshiped and we've read a scripture and
[1:03:06] we remembered in our lives what the Lord
[1:03:07] has done and we could close the service
[1:03:09] right now and we could go away rejoicing
[1:03:11] and being happy
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; and it would have been a good day. It
[1:03:16] would have been a good service
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; if God had there's a there's a um every
[1:03:20] every uh Easter every Passover my family
[1:03:24] and I we sit down we have a a Passover
[1:03:26] meal together and we go through the
[1:03:30] Exodus story and we we talk about it and
[1:03:32] the the meanings and the types and there
[1:03:35] comes a point where we where we rehearse
[1:03:37] what God has done. And if if God if God
[1:03:41] had only brought us out from Egypt, it
[1:03:44] would have been enough.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; If God had only done this, it would have
[1:03:48] been enough.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; If God had only saved me from my sin and
[1:03:52] never talked with me again, it would
[1:03:54] have been enough.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; If God had only healed me from that
[1:03:57] sickness that one time and never healed
[1:04:00] me again, it would have been enough.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And we go around around the table and we
[1:04:04] start rehearsing those things. We say it
[1:04:06] together. It would have been enough. it
[1:04:08] would have been enough. But no, he's
[1:04:10] done more and more and more. And he
[1:04:14] always is doing more in our lives.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And so when we get down upon our knees
[1:04:20] and we start fighting our fight and we
[1:04:22] we begin to fight our battles, we begin
[1:04:25] to stand as one united army.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; United together with him.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Under the captain of the Lord of hosts.
[1:04:34] And you know this morning, I imagine if
[1:04:35] we could look into that realm and we
[1:04:37] would see those devils
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; and how they're struggling right now.
[1:04:41] You know that there are angels encamped
[1:04:43] round about this place.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And there are devils and demons
[1:04:47] struggling to get in.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And can I say this with all respect that
[1:04:51] there are probably devils and demons
[1:04:53] here right here that are struggling and
[1:04:55] fighting to get out.
[1:05:02] Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And there are devils and demons that are
[1:05:04] right here among us that are struggling
[1:05:06] to stay in.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; God deliver us from them all.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that the the battle belongs
[1:05:14] to the Lord.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's uh it's a day and an age
[1:05:20] that is shaking and trembling. Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Now, every age has lived through uh time
[1:05:25] since the beginning has always thought
[1:05:27] that this was the last day,
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; that this was the last time. They have
[1:05:31] the same scriptures that we do. They
[1:05:33] read the same verses that we read and
[1:05:35] they they believe that the the Lord was
[1:05:37] coming soon and and and yet time went on
[1:05:40] and time progressed until it got to this
[1:05:42] day. And we look around and we know by
[1:05:45] scripture and we know by the foretelling
[1:05:47] of of modern events made clear by
[1:05:49] prophecy that we are truly at the last
[1:05:52] days
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; and and this is the time of the Lord's
[1:05:56] coming. This is the time of the Lord's
[1:05:58] appearing and soon we shall see him face
[1:06:01] to face. Yeah,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; it's not it's not something that's a far
[1:06:05] off, but rather that we that this this
[1:06:07] generation that saw the fig tree putting
[1:06:10] forth his leaves will not pass away till
[1:06:12] all things are fulfilled
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and we will see him and we will know him
[1:06:17] even as he knows us.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the world is falling
[1:06:21] apart. Brother Brandham says this. He
[1:06:24] he's talking about the new kingdom and
[1:06:26] the new heaven and new the new earth.
[1:06:28] And he says um he references Hebrews
[1:06:31] 14:25. He says, "For we receive a
[1:06:33] kingdom that cannot be moved." And then
[1:06:36] he asks the question, "How did we get
[1:06:38] into it?" Not by a religious system.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Not by coming to a message church.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Not by sitting on a message pew.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Not even sitting in a Christian church
[1:06:49] or a Christian pew. That does not make
[1:06:51] you that does not put a kingdom within
[1:06:54] you.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; No. No,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; you cannot receive a kingdom just by
[1:06:58] attending church.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you cannot just
[1:07:01] receive a kingdom by saying you're a
[1:07:03] Christian and doing good works and good
[1:07:05] deeds.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; No, it the uh brother asks, "How did we
[1:07:10] get it?" Not by a religious system,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; but rather the kingdom of God is within
[1:07:16] you.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; It's not something that we have to
[1:07:18] struggle and reach out to obtain.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; It's within us. When we come to him and
[1:07:24] we give our lives to him, he fills us
[1:07:26] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:07:28] kingdom of God is within you.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth.
[1:07:33] He says, the king and his word is the
[1:07:34] same and it's within you.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; And what's it doing? Listen to this. He
[1:07:38] says,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; let me read it again. The king and his
[1:07:42] word is the same.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And it's within you.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; What's it doing now? He says it's
[1:07:52] vindicating the hour that we are now
[1:07:55] living in.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; It the the the spirit of God within us
[1:07:59] looks at the things that are happening
[1:08:01] around this world and recognizes where
[1:08:03] we are in time. It witnesses the
[1:08:06] dispensation that we're living in.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And propels us and drives us to be
[1:08:11] closer to God.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; To sacrifice more and more of our own
[1:08:14] will.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; He goes on and just let me read for just
[1:08:19] a few moments. He says, "The promise
[1:08:21] that God made for this age, here we are
[1:08:24] living with the king, sitting in
[1:08:25] heavenly places, watching him do doing
[1:08:29] these things."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Now, he's talking about this is 1963.
[1:08:34] He's obviously he's talking about the
[1:08:35] ministry. The seals were just open. This
[1:08:37] is November. Um, and so he's talking
[1:08:40] about all the great things that God is
[1:08:42] doing, but God is still doing great
[1:08:43] things.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; God is still revealing himself to his
[1:08:46] people.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on, he says, and he says,
[1:08:49] how can we turn from that word to some
[1:08:53] system?
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And I think about how many people have
[1:08:58] will will choose to leave the vindicated
[1:09:01] word of the hour to go and return to a
[1:09:03] system.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; He says what what does it do? It denies
[1:09:08] the word.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; And he says you have to receive
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; to reject truth. You have to receive
[1:09:15] truth in order to be able to reject it.
[1:09:17] Right?
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Judas could not betray Jesus. Unless he
[1:09:20] was a friend of Jesus
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; unless he walked with him and talked
[1:09:24] with him and slept with him and ate food
[1:09:26] and broke bread with him and became a
[1:09:28] friend to him and a disciple, it would
[1:09:30] not have been betrayal.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And so these people that that leave,
[1:09:36] they they have to receive the truth.
[1:09:38] They have to have known it to be able to
[1:09:40] reject it. Right.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You have to He says you have to receive
[1:09:45] to reject truth before you can have an
[1:09:48] error.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's that's quite a statement.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Before you can have an error.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And just think about the how logical
[1:09:57] that is. You have to be able to to know
[1:10:00] what's going on.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; You have to have heard in your eyes. You
[1:10:04] you have to have had some sort of a
[1:10:06] revelation of something
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; in order to then make an error. right
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; to create an error.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; And we we I don't know about you, but
[1:10:16] when I received this message and I
[1:10:18] received what God is doing in our day,
[1:10:20] it was a revelation to me.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; That totally changed my life.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; It changed my desires. It changed who I
[1:10:27] was. It changed who I wanted to be.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And and um
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; it it it called me to to live a higher
[1:10:35] life
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; in knowing that that is obtainable.
[1:10:40] knowing that that is that is readily
[1:10:42] available for me. When I do not walk in
[1:10:45] it,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; I walk in error.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; If I just walked in sin and had never
[1:10:50] known anything, I would just be walking
[1:10:52] in sin.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; And matter of fact, it wouldn't even be
[1:10:54] sin because I didn't know the truth.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; I hope you catch that.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He goes on, he says, uh, uh, skipping
[1:11:03] down just a little bit, he says, "The
[1:11:04] church is ready. She's sealed in, ready
[1:11:08] to come.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; There will be a big outpouring of the
[1:11:12] spirit. Yes, sir. To grab that church
[1:11:14] and take her into the skies.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And I tell you friends, that's what we
[1:11:18] are waiting on today.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting on bombs to drop. I'm
[1:11:23] not waiting to see the the two witnesses
[1:11:26] arise in Israel.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I don't plan
[1:11:30] to be here.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of people get all
[1:11:32] nervous and worked up when they see the
[1:11:34] things happening in Israel. God's time
[1:11:36] piece and they they see the troubles and
[1:11:38] the calamities and the bonds falling and
[1:11:40] they're they're shaking and
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; and and they're worried about it
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and it's like why why why would you
[1:11:48] worry about it?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; If anything, it should make you more
[1:11:52] secure
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; to know that you've been told that this
[1:11:55] would happen and you see it coming to
[1:11:56] pass. And I'm glad to be in this
[1:12:00] message, sealed into this,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; to be part of a prophetic people who has
[1:12:04] a prophetic word for this day.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; And no other age has had this.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And you think about it, the the
[1:12:12] Reformation with with Luther and Wesley
[1:12:15] and that man age and uh the anointing
[1:12:17] that that extraordinary men were given
[1:12:20] like Charles Spurgeon and and uh Ian
[1:12:23] Bounds. If you've never read Ian Bounds
[1:12:25] on prayer, you're missing out. uh just
[1:12:28] so it's so powerful. It just convicts
[1:12:31] you where you sit. Charles Spurgeon,
[1:12:33] Dwight Moody,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; and they pulled such deep things out of
[1:12:36] the scripture
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; just because of that that man intellect
[1:12:41] anointing,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And they they they taught us
[1:12:46] justification. They taught us
[1:12:47] sanctification. And they brought a word
[1:12:51] just on intellect that was so close
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. so close to being perfect that it
[1:12:57] took a prophet to come in our day to say
[1:13:01] this is correct. What this person said
[1:13:04] is correct. Larkin was correct right
[1:13:06] here. Spurgeon was correct here. Calvin
[1:13:08] was right.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Armenianism. And we put all this
[1:13:12] together and it took a prophet to tell
[1:13:14] us
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; this is the truth.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; That this is the truth. It's true.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we have been walking still in
[1:13:21] in in the the revelation of other ages.
[1:13:23] And I tell you, sometimes when you read
[1:13:25] them, like I I like I mentioned Ian
[1:13:27] Bounds, I read him and it's it's so
[1:13:30] difficult to struggle through and read.
[1:13:32] I grew up reading literature from the
[1:13:35] the turn of the century uh to the 1920s,
[1:13:39] 1930s, and it it it changed how I read
[1:13:43] from like modern articles and modern
[1:13:46] texts. it it's a different vocabulary
[1:13:49] and and even with that
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; uh kind of a classical education, excuse
[1:13:53] me.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; I struggle to read what those ministers
[1:13:57] wrote.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And it and heaven help you if you ever
[1:14:00] go on YouTube and you and you try to
[1:14:02] listen to someone imitating Spurgeon's
[1:14:05] sermons and reading them out. You know,
[1:14:07] he wrote every word and then he would
[1:14:08] read them and and so we have those and
[1:14:10] people dramatize or dramatically read
[1:14:13] them
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and it's enough to make my my head melt.
[1:14:16] Yeah,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how to to to stand
[1:14:19] with them or to grasp what they're
[1:14:22] saying. It's just so complex and so
[1:14:24] dense. But what we have is the prophet
[1:14:26] coming and simplifying it. A man with a
[1:14:29] a third grade education from the hills
[1:14:31] of Kentucky coming and making it so
[1:14:34] plain and simple that this that the most
[1:14:37] humble among us can understand it.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And I'm I'm grateful,
[1:14:44] you know, that in our in our time that
[1:14:46] we've seen these things, the the
[1:14:47] outpouring of the the Holy Spirit in the
[1:14:50] 1906 Isuza Street revival and how the
[1:14:53] gifts came back into the church.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and people began to prophesy
[1:14:58] and people were healed of of every kind
[1:15:01] of sickness of blindness and uh the dead
[1:15:04] were raised and and uh if you've never
[1:15:06] done it on YouTube there there are
[1:15:08] videos of people that were alive when
[1:15:11] that happened that they they they
[1:15:13] interviewed in the 1960s or 50s and they
[1:15:16] and they you listen to them talk about
[1:15:18] that experience that they had
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and it was so wonderful those gifts
[1:15:22] being restored but then the prophet came
[1:15:24] and said it's not just about the gifts.
[1:15:26] Come on.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And the gifts are not the proof.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Because the gifts can be imitated.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; But he taught us that we have to focus
[1:15:33] on the word.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And so now we here we are 100 years
[1:15:38] later.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; And some churches are so formal and cold
[1:15:42] that in in within our message ranks that
[1:15:45] you won't even stand up and and and
[1:15:48] speak in tongues. Right?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; People won't won't interpret or they
[1:15:51] won't they won't have a word from the
[1:15:53] Lord because they're too frightened of
[1:15:55] the gifts now that it might be out of
[1:15:56] order. You see, so we went from from no
[1:15:59] order to being so completely over this
[1:16:02] way that believers with the gift are
[1:16:04] even afraid to use it.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, my brother and my
[1:16:08] sister, that's wrong. It shouldn't be
[1:16:09] that way.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's the things that we see. I
[1:16:15] I' I've been to message churches that
[1:16:17] literally and churches one church I
[1:16:19] won't I won't don't let me exaggerate
[1:16:21] there. One church that turned me away at
[1:16:24] the door when I went to go in that said
[1:16:26] they believed this message would not let
[1:16:29] me come in.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Walked up to the door. Somebody opened
[1:16:33] the door, met me there. And I tell you,
[1:16:35] I I'll be I'll be so honest with you.
[1:16:37] This was so such a strange thing to me.
[1:16:40] So unbelievable that even looking back
[1:16:42] at it today, I wonder within myself, did
[1:16:45] I imagine that?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Was that just a dream? How could that?
[1:16:50] How did that really happened?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; But it does. There there are places like
[1:16:55] that
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; that say that they believe the revealed
[1:16:58] word of the hour.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; But if you don't believe their
[1:17:01] interpretation of it,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; they don't want no fellowship with you.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that separates
[1:17:08] people. It's the message doesn't
[1:17:10] separate us. The word of God doesn't
[1:17:12] separate us. It's our interpretation of
[1:17:15] it.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. There there's people that
[1:17:17] interpret it this way and interpret it
[1:17:19] that way. And they've made little
[1:17:21] circles and denominations within our
[1:17:23] ranks that okay, well, if you see uh
[1:17:26] Peruia this way, there's a Peruia uh
[1:17:29] denomination. If you see two soul, then
[1:17:32] you have the two soul denomination. And
[1:17:33] if you see if you see thunders and you
[1:17:35] have the thunders denomination, it just
[1:17:37] goes on and on. You know, you have deity
[1:17:39] and and all kinds of different
[1:17:40] denominations within our ranks. And
[1:17:43] those interpretations are what separates
[1:17:45] us.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; And and my thing is is uh in my
[1:17:48] personality, I'm a peacemaker. I I I
[1:17:51] everywhere I go, I try to Brother Dale
[1:17:53] knows this for sure. I start talking to
[1:17:55] brother Dell and he's telling me
[1:17:56] different things. I'm like, well, we
[1:17:57] just need to get together with that
[1:17:58] brother. Let's have coffee. Let's iron
[1:18:00] this out. And and sometimes you could do
[1:18:02] that and sometimes you can't. But I'm a
[1:18:04] peacemaker.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; When I come to a place and there's
[1:18:07] troubles and things like that between
[1:18:08] brethren, I I it bothers me. It bothers
[1:18:11] my soul. I want things to be people to
[1:18:13] be united
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; under this this banner of love.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; And if you have a you have an
[1:18:18] interpretation of something that is in
[1:18:20] the Bible or you have an interpretation
[1:18:22] of something that that God that that you
[1:18:24] think that God has revealed to you out
[1:18:26] of the out of the message, then praise
[1:18:28] the Lord. But if your interpretation of
[1:18:31] something causes you to reject everybody
[1:18:33] who doesn't believe it like you,
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; there's something wrong with your
[1:18:37] revelation.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; If you can't f if you believe in
[1:18:41] thunders and you can't fellowship
[1:18:42] somebody that believes Peruia tells me
[1:18:45] your your thing in thunders might not be
[1:18:47] correct.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And so we we we battle over our
[1:18:51] interpretation of what brother Brandham
[1:18:54] said. And I I I think that you know uh
[1:18:58] brother Brandham said it very clearly
[1:19:00] and the scripture tells us very clearly
[1:19:02] that that we will never in this day
[1:19:06] physically have us the spirit of the
[1:19:09] unity of faith.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon plainly said that the
[1:19:13] unity of faith will not be amongst the
[1:19:15] church until he comes
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; until Jesus returns.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. He said, he said, once
[1:19:22] once he returns, all the little things
[1:19:24] that we thought were so important are
[1:19:26] not going to be very important at all.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And and I'll tell you, there's going to
[1:19:30] be a lot of us who are embarrassed when
[1:19:32] he returns and we realize that we did
[1:19:35] not fellowship with a part of his body
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; for years and years and decades and
[1:19:40] decades for no simp reason.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; We just ignored his body.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:47] That's right.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; I believe if you have a a revelation
[1:19:51] from God, it ought to make you the most
[1:19:53] humble, kindest person there is, the
[1:19:55] most loving, dedicated to one another
[1:19:58] person there could be.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; To make you just like I'll just put it
[1:20:02] this way, to make you like brother
[1:20:04] Brandham.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; That to draw your circle bigger.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You my brother, you I don't see it that
[1:20:10] way, but I love you no matter what. And
[1:20:12] it's okay.
[1:20:16] you know, we start talking about the
[1:20:17] things that we believe and we we um
[1:20:21] agree on and disagree on, there's going
[1:20:23] to it's doesn't matter who we are, it's
[1:20:24] going to pop up even within, you know,
[1:20:26] the the thunderous denomination when
[1:20:28] they start talking, they they start
[1:20:30] disagreeing on things,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; right? Right.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And it's okay because what brother
[1:20:33] Brandham said and what the Bible said is
[1:20:35] that we should be seeking a spirit of
[1:20:37] unity.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Now, not unity like we see in the world
[1:20:41] around us. I don't I I don't know if
[1:20:43] you're aware of this, but this is the
[1:20:44] the 1700th year 17 1,700
[1:20:50] anniversary of the Council of Nika.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And this year,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:20:57] And just for you younger people that may
[1:20:59] not be aware of this, in in the council
[1:21:01] of Nika in 325 AD, the church got
[1:21:04] together, the Roman Catholic church.
[1:21:06] They brought all the churches together,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; all the pastors, all the preachers, and
[1:21:11] they all traveled to this this city of
[1:21:12] Nika in what's modern day Turkey.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; And they all decided this is what we
[1:21:17] believe
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; and they said we believe that God is a
[1:21:20] trinity. We believe uh you know the the
[1:21:23] the pope is the vicer, the the very
[1:21:26] standin for Christ and they they they
[1:21:28] had this whole list of things that they
[1:21:30] believe disbelieve and how they would
[1:21:32] separate from like what Christianity had
[1:21:34] been a hundred years ago. And um this
[1:21:39] this year in October and November, the
[1:21:42] World Council of Churches,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; the Roman Catholic Church, and the
[1:21:45] Eastern Orthodox Church are all meeting
[1:21:48] in the city of Nika. now the the city
[1:21:52] that is built over top of Na
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; and they're all going to get together
[1:21:56] and they're going to have a big love
[1:21:57] feast
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; and they're going to all tell each other
[1:22:00] how unified they are and how they all
[1:22:03] believe the same things
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; and that there's no more splits and
[1:22:06] there's no more, you know, orthodoxy
[1:22:09] that everybody can be united under this
[1:22:11] great banner.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Which sounds very familiar to what
[1:22:14] somebody told us 40 and 50 years ago.
[1:22:17] Yes.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Is happening today.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God is always God is a God
[1:22:28] of the I am.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; He's always moving in the present.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And this is what I think it's so
[1:22:32] difficult sometimes to look and see what
[1:22:34] God is doing today. It's easy to look in
[1:22:36] the past and see what God did in the
[1:22:38] past. Yeah.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; To see where he moved and anointed
[1:22:41] someone and some great thing happened or
[1:22:43] a healing or or a dispensation happened.
[1:22:45] But it's difficult to see what God is
[1:22:47] doing today.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And as believers, if we look and we see
[1:22:50] the World Council of Churches
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; meeting with the Pope,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; the Roman Catholic Church
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Now, if
[1:22:59] you don't know, the Eastern Orthodox and
[1:23:01] the Roman Catholic Church are about as
[1:23:04] far away as the East is from the West,
[1:23:06] right? They've been fighting for uh
[1:23:08] 1,500 years,
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And separated.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And now they're coming back
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; to be united again.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And they're going to pray a prayer of
[1:23:17] reconciliation between the two. And
[1:23:19] they're going to hold hands and sing
[1:23:20] kumbaya.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And you know, as a believer, I number
[1:23:28] one, I'm just like, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me at all." Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me that we have a pope
[1:23:36] that came out of America now in
[1:23:38] fulfillment of prophecy.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; It does it doesn't make me frightened.
[1:23:42] It doesn't make me afraid. It shouldn't
[1:23:44] make you nervous. If anything, it should
[1:23:46] give you the utmost confidence in what
[1:23:48] we believe and what we have been told.
[1:23:50] That is right, that is true, that we are
[1:23:53] on the right path, that our footsteps
[1:23:55] are ordained by the Lord. And it should
[1:23:57] give us peace and give us rest in him.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says in Jehovah
[1:24:04] Gyra uh number three 1964 he says he
[1:24:07] he's praying and he says our heavenly
[1:24:09] father we're are grateful tonight to
[1:24:11] have this privilege of assembling
[1:24:13] together in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:15] to worship him in the spirit of his
[1:24:16] resurrection and we're so grateful to
[1:24:18] you for what you have already done for
[1:24:19] us identifying what he has done by
[1:24:22] identifying yourself by the word among
[1:24:25] us and by the resurrection and now our
[1:24:28] heart our hopes are built so high Lord
[1:24:31] because We know that that the God we
[1:24:33] serve is not some historical God, but a
[1:24:36] present tense God.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; We don't serve a God of 2,000 years ago.
[1:24:41] We serve the We serve a God of today who
[1:24:44] is able to do the exact same things
[1:24:46] today that he did 2,000 years ago. And
[1:24:49] the bondage that that was upon you that
[1:24:52] you felt that you were delivered from
[1:24:54] and the things that you kept being in
[1:24:56] bondage to, he is here to deliver you
[1:24:58] this morning if you should accept it.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; To let go of it. He says he says our our
[1:25:04] hopes are built so high because we know
[1:25:06] that the God we serve is not some
[1:25:08] historical God but a present tense God.
[1:25:11] The one that's raised from the dead. Not
[1:25:13] Lazarus,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; not the saints of the Old Testament. But
[1:25:17] in our generation, we have seen people
[1:25:19] raised from the dead
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; that were clinically declared dead that
[1:25:23] God has raised up and restored life to
[1:25:26] children, old men.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's just happened as a fact. Science
[1:25:31] can't explain, but the word of God can
[1:25:33] explain.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; The spirit that would that is within us
[1:25:36] is able to testify to it and believe it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's proved himself
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; that he was the God that was with Moses,
[1:25:44] with Abraham, and all the apostles, and
[1:25:47] still is the same God. And he is still
[1:25:49] the same God today.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; 1965 was a long time ago.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I I I wasn't alive then. Some of you
[1:25:58] were. Some of you were babies and and
[1:26:00] maybe some of you were old then. I don't
[1:26:02] know. But uh
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; thank you, sister Lee.
[1:26:11] Now, sometimes I get a little intense,
[1:26:14] so I try to try to sprinkle in a little
[1:26:15] humor
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; just to what what's they say in uh oh,
[1:26:22] what's that old movie?
[1:26:26] Mary Poppins. A spoonful of sugar makes
[1:26:29] go down.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's hard to be mad at somebody when
[1:26:34] you're laughing at them.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; First John 1, it says this, and we're
[1:26:40] all we're all familiar with this
[1:26:42] scripture. If we walk in the light as he
[1:26:44] is in the light, we have fellowship one
[1:26:46] with another.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; So, first of all, if we walk,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; if we walk, so that means no standing
[1:26:53] still.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; All right? It doesn't mean walking in
[1:26:56] the other direction.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean turning back and walking
[1:26:59] away from things. But if we walk, if we
[1:27:02] move, you have to be alive to move.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You have to be alive to walk.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You have to been reborn, born again
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; and changed to be able to walk.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; In the light.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And God is light as he is in the light.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And so the light moves throughout ages,
[1:27:21] throughout time. We've seen it where he
[1:27:23] would when Jesus Christ was here on
[1:27:25] earth. He was the light and then it went
[1:27:27] the light moved into the apostles and
[1:27:29] the light moved into the body of Christ
[1:27:30] into the church. And throughout the
[1:27:32] ages, the the true believer has always
[1:27:35] been the torchbearer of his light.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; We have to walk in the light as he is in
[1:27:42] the light. And so if we just rely on the
[1:27:44] things that were said by those great men
[1:27:46] of old such as Wesley and Luther and the
[1:27:49] the reformers and the the different men,
[1:27:51] if we rely solely on that, we're living
[1:27:53] on food from a prior day.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Why is it that we can't do that with
[1:27:58] what men said?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But we can do it with what the Bible
[1:28:02] said.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible is timeless and
[1:28:05] ageless. It does not change. It's
[1:28:07] perfect in every way.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; It it it the culture can change. Our
[1:28:12] communities can change. Our world can
[1:28:14] change. But the the word of God never
[1:28:16] changes. It is always right on time. It
[1:28:19] is always relevant. It is always
[1:28:21] important to our lives. The things that
[1:28:23] we say as men can fail and pass away. I
[1:28:25] can make a mistake. I can slip up. I can
[1:28:27] say the wrong thing. I can quote the
[1:28:29] wrong quote. I can I can say this
[1:28:30] scripture is this, you know, and have
[1:28:32] the wrong scripture and and I can make a
[1:28:34] mistake. But the word of God will never
[1:28:36] make a mistake. Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And so if we walk then as in the light
[1:28:40] as he is in the light as we see him
[1:28:42] moving and doing and and uh creating uh
[1:28:46] uh adding on to his book
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; of acts,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; We walk in that light.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And then what's it say? So we have
[1:28:55] fellowship one with another. That's not
[1:28:57] even fellowship with God
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; directly where we commune with God.
[1:29:02] That's a one-on-one relationship. But
[1:29:04] then what it what it says is we have
[1:29:06] fellowship one with another.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Now that's not fellowship with the
[1:29:09] carnal John or the carnal brother Dale
[1:29:12] or the carnal brother Mike
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; or or sister Ruth. That is fellowship
[1:29:18] with the God within them.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Can you catch that? That we we're not
[1:29:24] fellowshipping with one another.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; We come here to be free, but it's not
[1:29:28] free just to Yes. Getting to know one
[1:29:30] another is the perk and the the pleasure
[1:29:32] to to to learn about one another's lives
[1:29:34] and your stories and where you came from
[1:29:36] and where you've been and how you how
[1:29:38] you got to where you are today. But the
[1:29:40] real pleasure is to see the God within
[1:29:43] you
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; and ministering to to me and ministering
[1:29:47] to you.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; We have fellowship one one another and
[1:29:51] then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:29:54] us from all sin.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But do you see that there's
[1:30:00] there there are things that happen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; There's an order to things
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; as put into scripture.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Walk in the light
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; as he is in the light.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Meaning the present day truth of what's
[1:30:13] been revealed.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Then we have fellowship with the God
[1:30:17] within one another.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And then the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:30:21] cleanses us from sin.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we're not walking in the
[1:30:24] light, if we're not walking, if we're
[1:30:26] not walking in the light as he is in the
[1:30:29] light, if we're not fellowshipping with
[1:30:30] the God within the bride, right?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; The God within one another,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; then is the blood of Jesus Christ there
[1:30:36] to cleanse us from all our sin?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I'll leave that up to you.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; See what I can skip here. I got about
[1:30:51] just a little bit more time. Is that
[1:30:53] okay?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Is everyone with me?
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; You know, I I can't be brother Junior.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And I can't I can't be brother Bartley
[1:31:00] and I can't be brother John Denqua or or
[1:31:03] Brother Jose. You know, I'm just me and
[1:31:06] what you see is what you get.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I I was thinking about uh you know, my
[1:31:16] generation.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, my gener I was born in
[1:31:21] in the in 78 and so uh I wasn't alive
[1:31:26] when brother Brandon was here,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And you know, my family as they started
[1:31:30] to be coming in into touch with the
[1:31:31] things that surround the message of the
[1:31:34] hour. I was exposed to things that were
[1:31:36] just completely insane to me.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; People worshiping Brother Brandham,
[1:31:41] people praying to brother Brandham,
[1:31:43] people praying to his sons. I I I I sat
[1:31:46] in a church once in Arizona and listened
[1:31:49] as the opening prayer as the the I don't
[1:31:51] know if it if he was the pastor or not.
[1:31:54] I really don't remember. I was so I was
[1:31:56] so uh overwhelmed by what I was hearing
[1:32:00] that I couldn't hardly concentrate as I
[1:32:03] prayed, you know, uh God, we love you so
[1:32:06] much and we love your sons, Billy Paul
[1:32:08] and and brother Joseph. And and my mind
[1:32:11] at that point just just kind of melted
[1:32:13] and froze. Am I hearing the things that
[1:32:15] I'm hearing?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And those things are among us,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; but I didn't see Brother Brandham with
[1:32:25] my own eyes.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't see the the the things that he
[1:32:30] testified on, the things that we hear on
[1:32:32] the tapes, the the great healing
[1:32:34] campaigns
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; that that the the visions and the the
[1:32:38] prophecies. I didn't see those come
[1:32:40] forth under the pool pit. I you know I
[1:32:41] wasn't I wasn't blessed to live in that
[1:32:43] day.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; But I'm reminded of a scripture. Now let
[1:32:48] me ask you this. Were any of you ever in
[1:32:49] brother Brandham's meetings?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Not a one of us.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Not one of us.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Not one of us was ever under that
[1:32:58] anointing that came under that prophet.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Think about that for just a moment.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; He was a forerunner.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; But here we are.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And and and sometimes I I feel like
[1:33:09] Thomas
[1:33:11] the apostle
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "Blessed are you or
[1:33:15] blessed are they who have not seen so
[1:33:18] believe." But you know, I think I think
[1:33:20] Thomas gets a little bit of a bad rap
[1:33:22] actually.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I really do. You know, Thomas was the
[1:33:25] one that just a few days before when
[1:33:27] they were all the disciples were afraid
[1:33:30] that Jesus was going to go someplace and
[1:33:32] and they knew that the disciples knew if
[1:33:34] he goes there, they're going to capture
[1:33:36] him. They're going to kill him. And so
[1:33:38] they were like they were all arguing and
[1:33:40] fearful and frightened and fighting
[1:33:41] amongst themselves of what they should
[1:33:42] do. Should we keep him from going and
[1:33:44] and Thomas was the one that rose up and
[1:33:46] said, you know, well, if let's go die
[1:33:48] with him.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; If he's going to go there to die, then
[1:33:51] let's just go die with him.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't stop to me about it
[1:33:54] that uh Thomas was a an unbeliever or
[1:33:57] disbeliever or unfaithful.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; You know, as a matter of fact, you know
[1:34:01] what I think? This is just me. You can
[1:34:04] feel free to disagree with me, but I
[1:34:05] think I think a couple of those
[1:34:06] preachers got together and they kind of
[1:34:09] had it out for Thomas.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe they didn't quite like him so much
[1:34:13] and they gave his they gave his
[1:34:15] testimony just a little bit of a twist.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Now that I'm not saying what what what
[1:34:21] happened didn't happen,
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; but I'm saying it's written in such a
[1:34:24] way that it gives you the impression
[1:34:26] that Thomas was a doubter all the time.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you a story about
[1:34:30] Thomas.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; India.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Thomas went to India. Yes, sir.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; And I've told this before because I love
[1:34:35] telling this. So,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; if you know the story, you just bear
[1:34:38] with me because I know I know some of us
[1:34:40] have not heard this.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; All we've ever heard was Thomas is a
[1:34:43] doubting Thomas who put his fingers into
[1:34:46] the the the sight of the Lord. But, you
[1:34:48] know, when when he did that,
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Thomas had a declaration. What did he
[1:34:53] say?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; My Lord and my God.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Now Peter's revelation was
[1:34:59] Peter's revelation, thou art the Christ,
[1:35:01] the anointed one, the son of the living
[1:35:03] God.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; But when Thomas revelation came,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; it was you are my Lord, my Elohim
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; God
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and my God, Jehovah
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; That's the revelation
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ was Jehovah God.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; The Godhead, the oneness right there.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; And so I think Thomas, like I said, I
[1:35:29] think he gets a little bit of a bad rap,
[1:35:31] but he went to India. They drove him
[1:35:33] out, you know, from the church there in
[1:35:35] Jerusalem and he left and he went to
[1:35:37] India and he was an architect.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And Thomas still has a a wonderful
[1:35:42] testimony even today in India. He went
[1:35:44] to a certain place and he was going he
[1:35:46] was uh commissioned to build a palace
[1:35:48] for a king there. And so he began to to
[1:35:52] work and he's instructing the the
[1:35:53] laborers on how to do it do things. And
[1:35:55] he begins to testify of the things that
[1:35:57] he had saw in the ministry of Jesus
[1:35:59] Christ. And people began to believe his
[1:36:01] ministry. They began to believe on Jesus
[1:36:03] Christ. Well, in India, I know some of
[1:36:06] brother uh is from India and they they
[1:36:10] believe in many gods,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; many many gods. And so the king became
[1:36:14] very upset with with be uh with Thomas
[1:36:17] and confronted him and said, "What is
[1:36:18] this that you're teaching?" And Thomas,
[1:36:20] you know, explained it to him. And you
[1:36:23] know uh the story is that they were down
[1:36:25] there was a river right there and and
[1:36:26] they were down by the river and Thomas
[1:36:28] is witnessing to the king and he says
[1:36:30] and the king finally says fed up as your
[1:36:32] God is so great then then take a bucket
[1:36:35] of water and throw it up in the in the
[1:36:38] air and the water won't come back down.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Thomas takes the bucket, scoops it into
[1:36:43] the river, throws the ri the bucket the
[1:36:46] water up into the air. Not only does the
[1:36:49] water stay suspended in the air, but the
[1:36:52] hole in the river from the bucket made
[1:36:55] is still there.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Now that's faith.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; That's belief.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; That's not doubt.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And even today, Thomas is revered.
[1:37:05] There's a church there. He's known as
[1:37:06] the founder of Christianity in India.
[1:37:08] And matter of fact, when the uh when the
[1:37:13] Constantine, I believe it was, the Roman
[1:37:15] Catholic Church uh was building their
[1:37:18] their tomb of the apostles. Boy, that's
[1:37:20] a long story. I'd love to get into it,
[1:37:22] but we don't have time. But they went
[1:37:23] and they sent for the bones the body of
[1:37:26] Thomas in India. And the the people of
[1:37:28] India said, "You can have his body, but
[1:37:30] you can't have his heart."
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. and they kept his heart
[1:37:34] there in India and they sent his bones
[1:37:35] there to uh to the Catholic church.
[1:37:38] That's the testimony of Thomas. I I'll
[1:37:40] be honest, he's a little bit of a hero
[1:37:42] to me.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I think that that he was he's really
[1:37:46] kind of misunderstood.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; But he was the first to have that
[1:37:51] revelation.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You know what, brother Random taught us
[1:37:55] that in every generation, he adds a new
[1:37:57] part to his book.
[1:37:59] And I say that and I and at the same
[1:38:02] time I tell you that there is no eighth
[1:38:04] day messenger coming.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; There is no new revelation of God
[1:38:09] coming.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; There's no one coming to pick up the
[1:38:12] torch of of of a prophet and carry us
[1:38:15] forward into a rapture. Everything that
[1:38:17] has has been to be revealed has been
[1:38:19] revealed.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we're what we are doing is
[1:38:23] is falling more in love with Jesus.
[1:38:25] said, "We're," Brother Brandham said it
[1:38:27] this way in the token. He said, "We're
[1:38:28] we we're keeping the lamb up.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; We're watching the lamb. We're watching
[1:38:32] the word to see if there's any blemish
[1:38:34] in it, any fault in it."
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; And we haven't seen that.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; No. We've seen a man be a man, but we've
[1:38:40] seen no fault in the word.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Let me skip just a little bit here.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the rapture 1965, brother
[1:38:52] Brando says, "But to the church, the
[1:38:53] bride, the rapture is a revelation to
[1:38:56] her.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; It's revealed to her that the
[1:38:59] revelation, the true bride of Christ
[1:39:01] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:39:05] the rapture."
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Now, it is a revelation for the
[1:39:08] revelation is faith. You cannot have a
[1:39:10] revelation without it being faith. And
[1:39:13] faith is a revelation because it's
[1:39:15] something that has been revealed to you.
[1:39:17] Right.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation. And the rapture
[1:39:21] that we are all looking for
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; is a revelation.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And that's one one of the reasons why I
[1:39:28] thematically preach on who you are as
[1:39:31] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Because once we get a revelation of who
[1:39:35] we are in him,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; who our brother and sister are in him,
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; then this then we're going to finally be
[1:39:43] able to unite together. We're going to
[1:39:45] finally be able to unite and the things
[1:39:47] that we disagree with are are are going
[1:39:49] to be so insignificant
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; that heaven help us. Can you imagine
[1:39:53] that that Jesus Christ is here and your
[1:39:55] brother and sister and they believe just
[1:39:57] a little bit differently than you do on
[1:39:59] a minor thing and you won't fellowship
[1:40:01] with the God within them?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; How can you have forgiveness of sin?
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm But we we we are unique in
[1:40:09] that we had a prophet come and he told
[1:40:11] us things that were to pass.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Right. He told us about uh the the
[1:40:17] things that would happen with Hitler and
[1:40:19] Mussolini and the invasion of Ethiopia.
[1:40:21] He told us about uh the Nazism and
[1:40:25] fascism being rolled up into communism.
[1:40:27] He told us about uh a driverless car
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; that would come. And he he said this in
[1:40:33] the 1930s when a driverless car was was
[1:40:36] just a a thought of science fiction.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:42] And now here we have it,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Today you can get into a a a cab in in a
[1:40:49] city and take a ride from one end of the
[1:40:51] city to the other,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Without a driver,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; you can get a car. You can buy a car
[1:40:57] online and the car will drive itself to
[1:41:00] your driveway
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; and park it for you.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Tell me that has not been fulfilled.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Is the script do we agree that the
[1:41:08] scriptur has been fulfilled?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:10] are or the prophecy has been fulfilled.
[1:41:12] I'm sorry.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; It has been fulfilled.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And people say, "Well, we're we're this
[1:41:17] is this is a a a peculiar one to me and
[1:41:21] and I'm closing down and winding down. I
[1:41:24] only have 10 more pages to go."
[1:41:29] You know, in in uh several several a
[1:41:32] couple years ago, we saw Hillary Clinton
[1:41:36] running for president,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; and people were convinced that this
[1:41:39] would be the woman that would rise.
[1:41:40] Brother Brandon prophesied that a a
[1:41:42] woman would come to power, a woman or a
[1:41:45] church.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; He prophesied this in 1933 in America
[1:41:49] that uh would take over, that she would
[1:41:52] be beautiful to look at, but
[1:41:53] cruelhearted, purple, clothes in purple
[1:41:56] now. And so we thought, well, uh, you
[1:41:58] know, and I I remember brother Perry
[1:42:00] Green, brother Perry Green thought might
[1:42:02] it might even be Oprah Winfrey and he
[1:42:04] speculated it could be, uh, Hillary
[1:42:07] Clinton and then we speculated that it
[1:42:09] could be Kla Harris. But brother
[1:42:10] Brandham also said this in letting off
[1:42:12] the pressure.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. About this, he's talking about it
[1:42:15] and he says she is sitting right here on
[1:42:18] the throne today in this country. He
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; says so.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, sir. the woman that he
[1:42:23] prophesied about is sitting on the
[1:42:25] throne.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; He says in another place and so he's
[1:42:30] identifying it that it is not a woman,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; not a physical woman, you know. No, I'm
[1:42:35] sorry. It's not. He says he goes on and
[1:42:37] I don't know why we we skip over this
[1:42:39] when we read when we read about this
[1:42:41] prophecy. He says he said permitting the
[1:42:44] woman to vote and in doing so they would
[1:42:46] elect the wrong president. Now, before
[1:42:48] any of you who are feminists uh become
[1:42:51] very upset at me for saying women
[1:42:52] shouldn't vote, when women got the vote,
[1:42:55] since then there's been 94 million
[1:42:57] abortions in America.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; 94 million babies killed.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That would never have happened without
[1:43:03] the catering to a woman's vote.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; It says in doing so, they would elect
[1:43:10] the wrong president. Yeah.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And he said um he he goes on he says and
[1:43:15] in this would become a woman stand up
[1:43:18] not not the president but he said in
[1:43:21] this electing the wrong president and
[1:43:23] and allowing a woman to vote and in this
[1:43:25] a woman would stand up that would govern
[1:43:27] the United States and I'm quoting not
[1:43:30] actually a woman but a church
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; right
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; and then I seen her with nothing but
[1:43:35] ashes.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Not a woman but a church.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And today in America, the Roman
[1:43:42] Catholic Church is embedded in every
[1:43:44] level of our government.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Our Supreme Court justices are Catholic.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Our heads of cabinets and leaders and in
[1:43:52] the highest echelons are govern
[1:43:54] predominantly Catholic.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Their allegiance is not to the United
[1:43:58] States of America.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Their first allegiance is to the church.
[1:44:01] It's not even to allegiance to God. It's
[1:44:03] allegiance to their church and the pope.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Churchmen
[1:44:07] movement.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. but to recognize where we
[1:44:11] are.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; And there are people that are still, and
[1:44:14] if you disagree with me, it's fine. I
[1:44:15] understand if you disagree with me,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; but there are people that are that are
[1:44:20] waiting for a woman to be elected in
[1:44:22] America. And I said, hey, a woman may be
[1:44:24] elected in America. She might even come
[1:44:26] to the podium clothed in purple. Praise
[1:44:28] praise the Lord. That looks real fine.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; But the prophecy has been fulfilled.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; It's already done. Yeah.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And so, and so what's left for us, the
[1:44:39] bride, before we we take a rapture,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; not much.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Not much.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; It's recognizing who we are.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; It's recognizing that we can do the
[1:44:50] greater work.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; You know, if I if I start seeing bombs
[1:44:54] fall or an earthquake happen in
[1:44:56] California slide into the sea,
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; I I'm going to be a little bit worried
[1:45:01] about my condition.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Correct. Because then then I know that
[1:45:04] I'm getting ready to go through
[1:45:06] something very terrible.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; here.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; The only thing left for us is to take a
[1:45:16] rapture.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; For the last person to come in.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Well, the last
[1:45:22] person's got to come in and they got to
[1:45:23] be positionally placed and they've got
[1:45:25] to be, you know, filled with the Holy
[1:45:27] Spirit and they've got to learn
[1:45:28] everything within the message and
[1:45:29] they've got to learn all the prophecies
[1:45:31] and these things of the Bible." But I'm
[1:45:32] telling you that is incorrect.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; A baby eagle is born eating meat.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; They can from the very moment they hatch
[1:45:42] out of the shell, the mama eagle is
[1:45:43] given that baby need.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; When that last one comes in, they're not
[1:45:49] going to need the full revelation of
[1:45:51] everything. They're not going to need a
[1:45:52] complete understanding of everything.
[1:45:54] They're going to have to know the God
[1:45:56] that that they are going to walk in the
[1:45:58] light as he is in the light. And once
[1:46:00] they've done that, they have forgiveness
[1:46:02] for their sin. They've been restored,
[1:46:05] brought back, redeemed, replaced,
[1:46:07] sanctified, and we're taking a rapture.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; So until then, we're just planting our
[1:46:15] potatoes and living
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; as if he's coming tomorrow, but planning
[1:46:19] as if he's not coming for another
[1:46:20] hundred years.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Lord,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; there's a church that believes that.
[1:46:28] That's waking up to who she is
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; to becoming an invincible army.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; That's a people who don't stop at
[1:46:36] salvation, who don't stop with
[1:46:38] justification, who don't stop with
[1:46:40] sanctification,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; doesn't stop with the restoring of the
[1:46:43] gifts,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; doesn't even stop with the baptism of
[1:46:46] the Holy Ghost
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; on their flesh.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; How many people know that that you can
[1:46:51] be anointed of the Holy Ghost on your
[1:46:53] flesh and it never gets into your soul?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when brother Brandham
[1:46:58] says you can have the Holy Ghost every
[1:46:59] day of your life
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and still go to hell, he's not talking
[1:47:02] about it in the soul. He's talking about
[1:47:04] being baptled
[1:47:06] in the Holy Spirit in your flesh,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; but not in your soul.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; I believe that there's a people today
[1:47:14] that can live the Pentecost upper room
[1:47:17] life.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; That there's a people today that's not
[1:47:20] afraid to speak in tongues and
[1:47:22] interpret. that there's a people today
[1:47:24] is not afraid to stand up and prophesy
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; to acknowledge what God is doing in this
[1:47:29] hour to walk in the light as he is in
[1:47:31] the light.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That that we have a church that has been
[1:47:35] fulfilled
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; uh by the word of God that is fulfilling
[1:47:38] the word of God and is manifesting. What
[1:47:40] we are waiting on today is is what the
[1:47:42] scripture says the manifestations of the
[1:47:44] sons of God.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; When we have been manifested, when the
[1:47:48] last one has been manifested, we're
[1:47:50] going to take a rapture and there's
[1:47:51] going to be a change. Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And until then, we're in a battle to lay
[1:47:55] aside all the chains of sin and chains
[1:47:58] of bitterness and angriness and things
[1:48:00] that we've allowed to carry ourselves to
[1:48:02] carry away from the cross
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; until we let him go and manifest who you
[1:48:06] are in him
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; to manifest the life of Jesus Christ
[1:48:10] that he said would be in the believer.
[1:48:12] That's what we're waiting on today.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry that some of you are
[1:48:16] waiting on me and I'm sorry that I'm
[1:48:18] waiting on some of you, but we're going
[1:48:19] to get there.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. until until we do and we believe
[1:48:23] everything exactly all right. I just
[1:48:25] want to have spirit of unity with you.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. To to fellowship with the God
[1:48:29] within you.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I hope today that you can
[1:48:32] recognize who you are
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; to know that that if you're seeing the
[1:48:36] smallest part of what the prophet told
[1:48:39] us
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; that there is something inside you.
[1:48:42] There's going to ignite a hunger within
[1:48:44] you, young person, that that's set every
[1:48:47] day on a uh born into this message
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; and you've never even seen it and you're
[1:48:52] you're believe it because your parents
[1:48:53] believe it. When you get into it for
[1:48:54] yourself as a teenager, 18, 19 years
[1:48:58] old, and you start examining the word of
[1:48:59] God for yourself and identifying and
[1:49:01] say, "Yeah, that really is true. I
[1:49:03] really believe that. That speaks to me."
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; You might be the last one.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; You may be the last one.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good. Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are the sons and daughters of
[1:49:17] God.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; You are now the sons of God.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; And it does not yet appear what you
[1:49:23] shall be. But you, we know that when he
[1:49:25] appears, we shall be like him.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll receive a body like him.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Beautiful Jesus.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; I praise God.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful for to to him for
[1:49:39] everything that he's done.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and what he continues to do as we
[1:49:42] walk in the light as he is in the light.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Because I see him in my life.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; I see him. I see that my desires are no
[1:49:50] longer the desires of of 20 or 30 years
[1:49:52] ago.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; I see that my desires for things have
[1:49:55] changed.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; You know, and and I I'm free.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I'm free that that that that all things
[1:50:02] are lawful, but not all things are
[1:50:04] expedient.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; That that I don't have to worry about
[1:50:07] sending away my day of grace. I don't
[1:50:09] have to worry about blaspheming the Holy
[1:50:11] Spirit. That I can I can be free to
[1:50:13] worship. I can be free to praise God. I
[1:50:16] can be free to be a husband, a real
[1:50:18] husband to my wife, a real father to my
[1:50:21] children to lead them and guide them in
[1:50:23] the truth that God has given in this
[1:50:24] hour. And so can you today
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; if you'll only believe,
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; if you'll cast aside the things that
[1:50:31] you've been carrying for far too long,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; the bitterness, the tears
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; of the past. Yeah.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; And to let him go
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; and just lay him at the cross once
[1:50:43] again.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; And I think of it like this. It's just
[1:50:46] you walked away from it. You were so
[1:50:47] excited, but you still carried some of
[1:50:49] those chains and you take a couple steps
[1:50:51] now and it's a couple years later now
[1:50:53] some of us
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; and we just turn right back and go right
[1:50:55] back to the cross
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; and we just take those chains off. We
[1:50:58] say, "Lord, sorry. Forgot about this.
[1:51:00] That's yours, too."
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And we can just walk away from it.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me this
[1:51:05] morning?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] Let's give the Lord a a hand clap.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your holy name.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together as we close
[1:51:21] in prayer.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:51:25] blessed be your name.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your holy name.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; You're so good.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; You're so very, very good.
[1:51:37] When we were undeserving,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; when we were unloly,
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; covered in sin and the the mire or the
[1:51:44] filth of this world,
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; you sought us.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; You redeemed us.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; You cleaned us, Lord. And you set us
[1:51:53] apart for service.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; And we look we look at our past and we
[1:51:57] say, "I did this and I did that."
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; But you say you never did it in the
[1:52:02] first place.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Glory. Ye, you've never sinned.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's a seed remaining in
[1:52:10] you.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the rest that the believer
[1:52:17] has to lie down in green pastures and
[1:52:20] sit at your feet and your rod and your
[1:52:22] staff may comfort us.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, you prepare a table before us in the
[1:52:27] presence of our enemies.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You lead us beside still waters. You
[1:52:32] caused us to eat the green grass.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; For your name's sake.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are the the the sheep of your
[1:52:41] pasture, the people of your hand.

[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to live in what you've
[1:52:48] called us to live in.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; To lay aside the sins that so easily
[1:52:53] beset us, Lord, to lay aside the
[1:52:55] bitterness and the the anger of the past
[1:52:57] and the things that we hold on to. Lord,
[1:53:00] may may our lives be changed as we
[1:53:02] acknowledge we don't have to live that
[1:53:04] way anymore. We don't have to remain in
[1:53:07] bitterness and we don't we can let the
[1:53:09] pain of the past go
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; and stop letting it affect us and
[1:53:13] influence our lives and our choices,
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; but we can we can relax and rest in you.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Oh God, everything that we have need of
[1:53:24] to make a rapture has been given to us.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every revelation that we need to
[1:53:29] know your heart and who you are has been
[1:53:32] given to us. As we read in the book of
[1:53:34] Jeremiah, you've given us a heart to
[1:53:37] know you, God.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; To know who you are, to know what you
[1:53:40] love and and what pleases you. Lord,
[1:53:43] give us a heart to look within ourselves
[1:53:46] and identify ourselves with you. Give us
[1:53:49] a heart, Lord, to look to our left and
[1:53:51] to our right to our brother and our

[2:01:27] When God
[2:01:29] started dealing with me in the ministry,
[2:01:33] Brother John was the first pastor
[2:01:38] that I talked to.
[2:01:41] [Music]
[2:01:44] The very first day that we started the
[2:01:46] home church,
[2:01:50] Brother John left Toronto
[2:01:52] to come out and talk to our family.
[2:01:56] Hallelujah.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; We've traveled together in Africa. Amen.
[2:02:07] It's a man of God, Brother John.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I wasn't sure, when I was a
[2:02:12] baby, I talked to Pastor John. Amen. God
[2:02:17] bless you.
[2:02:19] Glory.
[2:02:21] Glory.
[2:02:30] So good. So good to be here.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Johnny blessed my heart so much.
[2:02:36] And yesterday's message was a blessing.
[2:02:39] I just got a little bit out of it.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; But the ministry of the bride is what is
[2:02:45] taking place now. The spirit and the
[2:02:47] bride say come.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the ministry of the bride is
[2:02:52] an open book ministry.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; And I am I'm realizing that many people
[2:02:59] are thinking that the power in the word
[2:03:01] is lost.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; No way.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; And they want to send us back to
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Auza split
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; thinking that anointing is what is going
[2:03:09] to take us.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; That was for pedig.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; This is for the bride.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The defectors, people who are
[2:03:17] trying to leave the message,
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; thinking they're coming to the Bible,
[2:03:21] you want to preach the Bible without a
[2:03:22] open book.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; you just go back to the close book,
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; You can quote scriptures and give the
[2:03:29] antics of everything. But what you did
[2:03:31] today
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; was to bring that message to reality
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; of what God is doing at present.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; I agree with you 100%.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; The woman the prophet saw was a church,
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; That is in control. Yes.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; But we beat up on the woman and all
[2:03:47] kinds of things and we missed it.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; But thank God for men like you
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; that are keeping the vision straight.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; We just have to give God a praise for
[2:03:56] the word of God. Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:04:04] I've always loved him. His dear wife. In
[2:04:08] fact, Vanessa is like my daughter now
[2:04:10] because of her trip to Africa and the
[2:04:12] family here. We are knitted in our
[2:04:15] hearts
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; and um many time if I don't show up is
[2:04:19] because I'm engaging.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Right.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; But you know my heart is here
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; and I want to thank God for all of you
[2:04:25] who are here today. Brother Garcia, good
[2:04:27] friend of God.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Many of the brothers here.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trusting the Lord. The family
[2:04:32] that we met are here today. Thank you
[2:04:34] for the son.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sir.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and pray.
[2:04:41] Lord, there's a reason why you sent us
[2:04:45] an angel in this age.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Your prophet told us that to do the work
[2:04:52] of God like Jesus said is to believe on
[2:04:55] the one that you sent.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you,
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Lord. You came upon the earth
[2:05:01] to redeem us,
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; but Lord, the church has gone into
[2:05:06] confusion and you brought us a prophet
[2:05:09] to bring us back.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:11] Thank God for opening our eyes to see
[2:05:13] the revelation he brought.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; The impact as your son was preaching
[2:05:18] this morning and
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; talking about what God was doing in his
[2:05:21] life and all of us our lives is because
[2:05:24] of what we saw you do in this age.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; We accepted that person of Christ in our
[2:05:29] life.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; And our me our life changed
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; gave us a purpose to live on.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And here we are today in this place this
[2:05:38] part of the world.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus. You've asked your son to call
[2:05:41] for this camp.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; You brought men, Lord, to preach.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you for Junior who preached last
[2:05:48] night. Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your son this morning that
[2:05:51] has brought forth your word. We pray for
[2:05:53] the preacher this evening.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; we ask that, oh God, something beset
[2:05:58] that will draw somebody closer to you.
[2:06:01] Father, may you forgive us of the
[2:06:02] besetting sins of malice and bitterness
[2:06:05] and
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; things that are just in our way that is
[2:06:09] not bringing us focus the way we should
[2:06:11] be.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Bless your children today.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we leave even here, may your
[2:06:16] presence go with us,
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; the meals that are going to be served.
[2:06:20] We pray that you'll sanctify for our
[2:06:22] use.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; And Lord, if there be another time
[2:06:25] again, you bring us back in your
[2:06:27] presence for us to serve you. And if
[2:06:29] not, Lord, may we all be at your feet at
[2:06:31] the rapture.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, pastor.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. God
[2:06:38] bless you all. We just go and uh enjoy
