[12:57] [Music]
[13:23] Somebody
[13:25] There's somebody out there hurt and
[13:29] confused.
[13:31] An innocent person
[13:34] being abused.
[13:37] There's somebody out there whose heart
[13:41] is breaking in two.
[13:46] There's somebody out there feeling
[13:50] alone,
[13:51] a husband, a wife
[13:55] being done wrong. There's somebody out
[13:59] there shattered from a broken home.
[14:05] [Music]
[14:07] But there's somebody out there with arms
[14:11] open wide,
[14:13] who longs to embrace you, dry the tears
[14:17] from your eyes.
[14:20] Hope for the hopeless. He'll carry the
[14:24] burdens you bear.
[14:28] When you don't have a prayer,
[14:32] there's somebody out there.
[14:38] There's somebody out there who thought
[14:42] it was cool to keep taking chances,
[14:47] thinking they'd never lose. Now they're
[14:50] hooked on a feeling
[14:54] that's left them emptied and fooled.
[14:59] There's somebody out there who can't
[15:03] quite decide
[15:05] whether to live
[15:08] or whether to die.
[15:11] They're searching for strength
[15:14] to get through their crisis in life.
[15:19] But there's somebody out there with arms
[15:24] open wide
[15:26] who longs to embrace you. Dry the tears
[15:30] from your eyes.
[15:32] He's hope for the hopeless.
[15:35] He'll carry the burdens you bear.
[15:41] When you don't have a prayer,
[15:44] there's somebody out there.
[15:49] There's somebody out there with arms
[15:53] open wide, who longs to embrace you, dry
[15:58] the tears from your eyes. He's hope for
[16:02] the hopeless. He'll carry the burdens
[16:07] you bear.
[16:10] When you don't have a prayer,
[16:13] there's somebody out there.

[29:42] we always welcome people that love the

[29:46] &gt;&gt; Just our sisters just enjoy the word.

[29:52] tell

[29:56] pulling the word. Amen. God's so good.
[29:58] Amen.
[30:01] You know when we sing that song, you are
[30:02] great. If that don't bless your heart,
[30:05] your wood's wet.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; If that don't make you get excited,
[30:09] &gt;&gt; your wood's wet. You need to lay in the
[30:12] presence of the sen son
[30:14] &gt;&gt; to get dried out.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; To let your wood get dried out. Amen.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to preach on eternal life
[30:23] this morning.
[30:25] And uh
[30:28] let's turn to Luke 10:25. We'll read our
[30:31] scripture and have your seats. And
[30:37] I'll tell you, God sure knows what he's
[30:39] doing. We're going to remember Brother
[30:40] Jeff. They must have had a flat tire or
[30:43] something, but he has double hernia
[30:46] surgery tomorrow.
[30:49] Amen. And uh so just remember them.
[30:53] But uh
[30:55] um your special Vanessa was just so
[30:59] perfect.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; So very very perfect. We'll have you
[31:05] sing that at the end of our message. But
[31:07] that's what we want to preach on
[31:09] &gt;&gt; is her message. Totally.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Um
[31:14] &gt;&gt; it's just how God
[31:16] arranged everything. Amen.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And behold, a certain lawyer stood
[31:22] up
[31:24] and tempted Jesus, saying, "Master,
[31:29] what shall I do to inherit
[31:33] eternal life?" Lord God,
[31:36] you know everything.
[31:38] Lord, you know what your plan is. And
[31:41] Lord, you know before the foundation of
[31:43] the world who would be here this
[31:46] morning.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. who would be ready to receive this
[31:50] thought that you have planned for them,
[31:53] Lord God.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the ones that it is attended
[31:57] for, Lord God, I pray they will receive
[32:00] it in the spirit that you brought it to
[32:03] me, Lord God. We give you the glory and
[32:06] honor for it in your name. Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this
[32:10] morning. You know, our prophet said to
[32:13] live me a sermon, live me a message.
[32:16] is better than to preach me a message.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; And you know, we want to look at that
[32:23] thought.
[32:25] And you know, I I started Wednesday
[32:27] night, we started preaching on what is
[32:28] the Christian life,
[32:30] &gt;&gt; not what is it to be a Christian, but
[32:32] what is the Christian life?
[32:35] &gt;&gt; What is it to live the Christian life?
[32:36] And and I honestly believe and this is
[32:39] no uh this is no slam to you or to me or
[32:43] if it is it's to me but I I wonder just
[32:46] sometimes if God's going to adjust our
[32:48] thought pattern just a little bit on
[32:51] what is the Christian life
[32:53] and and uh I'm going to I'm going to
[32:55] show you something outside this. You
[32:57] know the Christian life is more than
[33:00] believing this message.
[33:03] It's actually a lot more than believing
[33:04] this message because you want me to give
[33:06] you an example of that? Satan believes
[33:08] this message.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; He's scared to death of it because it's
[33:13] Christ. So it's a lot more than
[33:16] believing the letter
[33:18] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said that Paul said
[33:19] the letter kleth but the spirit giveth
[33:23] life. Yes,
[33:23] &gt;&gt; sir.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; And so see we we know the mysteries and
[33:27] we know just a tremendous amount of
[33:29] knowledge. We know who God is and we
[33:32] know uh his plan for even our own
[33:34] personal lives and but if we get caught
[33:38] up too much on the letter
[33:43] &gt;&gt; and not the life,
[33:45] &gt;&gt; we'll just be preachers.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; We'll just all be preachers
[33:50] &gt;&gt; preaching to our families or whatever.
[33:52] But we're just preaching letter. Yeah.
[33:55] Yeah.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; But you know, it might surprise you, but
[33:58] right underneath the capstone of
[34:00] perfection
[34:04] &gt;&gt; is brotherly kindness.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; And that would be like a sacrifice
[34:09] &gt;&gt; or compassion.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; And you know, when times get tough and
[34:16] you can hardly survive yourself,
[34:19] &gt;&gt; it's hard to have compassion.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:26] Do you know nothing in nature lives for
[34:27] itself? No.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram, his whole personal life
[34:32] was comparing God to nature. You know, a
[34:35] river don't drink its own water.
[34:39] A tree don't eat its own fruit.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; The flowers don't bloom to smell good
[34:45] for themselves.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; They probably give themselves a
[34:48] headache.
[34:51] And nobody sacrificed more than Jesus to
[34:54] leave the splendor of heaven,
[34:56] &gt;&gt; to become a flesh body, to have people
[35:00] spit on him, pull his beard out, drive
[35:02] nails through his hands, and whip him
[35:04] until the back of his body, his ribs
[35:06] shine through
[35:09] his backbone.
[35:13] And here
[35:15] a lawyer stood up tempting Jesus and
[35:19] said, "What shall I do to inherit
[35:22] eternal life?"
[35:24] And you know, I think this is where God
[35:27] wants to just curb us just slightly
[35:30] is it's not the seven seals.
[35:43] And it's not the prophet either.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Although those are all true.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; But would it be okay if I just let Jesus
[35:55] himself answer that question?
[35:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because you I felt something
[36:01] that when I said those words, you know,
[36:03] it's amazing when you preach a message
[36:04] and people that believe the message
[36:06] retaliate against the message.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; I can feel it. I just grabbed it.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; I didn't need a ball glove. Here Jesus
[36:14] himself ends, and he said unto him, it
[36:17] is written in the law, how thou readest
[36:21] it. Do thou readest the Bible?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus answer. And he answered and said,
[36:26] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[36:28] all thy heart. and with all thy soul and
[36:31] with all thy strength and with all thy
[36:34] mind. Now that covers just basically a
[36:36] lot of your body
[36:40] &gt;&gt; and thy and with all thy heart
[36:46] and thy neighbor
[36:48] as thyself.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; And he said to and Jesus said unto him,
[36:56] thou answerest right. doest thou and
[37:00] thou shalt have eternal life.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; See, he Jesus never said the seven
[37:07] seals.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus never said the prophets.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; He said himself. You know, I was
[37:15] listening to a clip of Donnie Reagan and
[37:16] and you know, it just amazed me. He
[37:18] said, you know, and and you know,
[37:21] tremendous brother and just amazing. He
[37:24] said, 'You know, when Eleazer picked up
[37:26] Rebecca to take him to Isaac, he never
[37:28] talked about himself.
[37:30] You know, if I said that without saying
[37:32] Donnie Rian's name, some of you would be
[37:33] offended. But he never talked about his
[37:35] great campaigns and how long his prayer
[37:37] lines were and how many people's got new
[37:40] eyes and new arms. He said, he said, you
[37:42] know, Donnie Regan was saying, she said,
[37:44] Ellie Ezer told Rebecca one thing. My
[37:46] master,
[37:47] &gt;&gt; my master, my master, my master, my
[37:50] master, my master, my master,
[37:52] &gt;&gt; sir. Yeah, that's right.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; And Donnie Reagan said, "And most of us
[37:57] talk about the prophet more than our
[37:58] master."
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Donnie Reagan said that. It's on my
[38:02] Facebook clip if anybody wants to see
[38:03] it.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; So don't be offended at me. Be offended
[38:05] at him.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; But I know he's true. That's why I
[38:08] reshared it.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; We say, "Oh, the prophet did great
[38:12] things." The prophet never said that.
[38:15] No.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Said, "And love thy neighbor as thyself,
[38:21] what shall I do to inherit eternal
[38:23] life?" And then, you know, you know, the
[38:25] disciples came to Jesus in a different
[38:27] scripture, and I I'm just jumping way
[38:29] ahead. He said, "Jesus, why do you speak
[38:31] in parables?"
[38:33] And he said, "Well, it's given to you to
[38:35] know the mysteries, but it's not given
[38:37] to them." And I told you that story to
[38:40] jump right into a parable. And Jesus
[38:43] answered this lawyer by a parable.
[38:48] And he said, "A certain man, this is
[38:51] verse 30,
[38:53] went down from Jerusalem
[38:56] to Jericho, and he fell among thieves,
[38:58] and he was stripped of his ragment, and
[39:00] he was wounded,
[39:02] and he departed, leaving him half dead."
[39:07] And by chance there came a certain
[39:12] priest or prophet that believed the
[39:14] message.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; They believed the message of that day.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; That was on that place. And he came and
[39:22] looked on him and he passed on the other
[39:24] side.
[39:26] But
[39:29] and likewise a Levite, another minister
[39:32] that was in the tabernacle that day,
[39:35] believe in the truth for their day.
[39:38] And when he came to the place, he looked
[39:40] upon him and he passed by
[39:43] the other side. Now I I just want to
[39:46] tell you something that the priest and
[39:48] the Levite was everybody that was
[39:50] believing Christianity were following
[39:52] those men.
[39:55] Why does Jesus tell parables like this?
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Verse 33. But a certain Samaritan,
[40:11] which is a mixed race,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; religiously unclean,
[40:17] pagan by association.
[40:22] They were half gentile,
[40:24] &gt;&gt; pagan by association. As he journeyed,
[40:29] he came where he was and he saw him and
[40:33] he had
[40:35] compassion
[40:37] on him
[40:38] &gt;&gt; and he went to him and he bound up his
[40:41] wounds and he poured oil in him and he
[40:43] set him on his own beast and he brought
[40:47] him to the end which was the church.
[40:50] Brother Bram says that. I'm going to
[40:51] read that after. And he brought him to
[40:53] the church and he took care of him. And
[40:55] on the tomorrow he departed and he left
[40:57] some money,
[41:00] two pence, and he gave him to the host.
[41:04] And he said unto him, he said, "Take
[41:05] care of him, and whatsoever thou
[41:07] spendest more when I come again, I will
[41:10] repay thee."
[41:13] And Jesus asked,
[41:16] "Which of these three
[41:25] thinkst thou was the neighbor upon him
[41:29] that fell among the thieves?" Which of
[41:31] these three do you think have eternal
[41:34] life?
[41:37] And he said, "Well, he that showeth
[41:40] mercy on him." And Jesus said
[41:44] to you,
[41:46] "Go and do thou likewise."
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't preach no better message
[41:53] than Jesus.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; We could just close.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; And go home.
[42:04] That surprises me. And it surprises you.
[42:08] I know it surprises you the way you're
[42:09] looking at me. This was eternal life.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; This was more than being in a message
[42:17] church.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Being in any message church.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; This was God himself, Jesus in the
[42:24] flesh.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Saying eternal life.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; What must I do? And they were trying to
[42:32] trick him into this. And Jesus tells
[42:34] this parable that is knocking the
[42:38] message of the day.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Because they never had compassion.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; And compassion is one that you know in
[42:52] the Bible it says they put a mark on
[42:53] them that sighed and cried for the
[42:56] abominations committed in the world.
[42:59] You know, I wonder, you know, like when
[43:02] we get inside our click called the
[43:04] message, wherever it is in any
[43:07] campground, in any church, any B, I
[43:10] wonder how much we have our arms opened
[43:11] up to all our neighbors.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Come on over. Come on in.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And we treat them like royalty,
[43:21] like the thief on the road.
[43:25] Like this song said, there's somebody
[43:27] out there that's confused.
[43:30] There's a child that's been abused.
[43:32] There's somebody there's somebody
[43:34] everywhere around you in your life
[43:37] that needs one word,
[43:40] compassion.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And in the compassion, it's so unnatural
[43:47] that it'll give you eternal life.
[43:51] It's so unnatural for humans to to to
[43:54] have compassion on a complete stranger.
[43:57] Not don't have nothing to do with me.
[43:59] Not my bills. Not my problem. Not my
[44:02] kids. I can only feed my own kids. Not
[44:04] my household.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Don't matter to me. I never made that
[44:09] bad decision.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Thieves never got me.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; What must I do to have eternal life? I
[44:17] wonder if the message today has eternal
[44:20] life.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Do they have the same eternal life that
[44:24] Jesus talked about?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; You know, I wonder I wonder if we do.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; I wonder if I do.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[44:44] It's pretty hard to knock what Jesus
[44:45] says. Yeah, that's right.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Jeff called me
[44:50] Saturday morning, invited me out for a
[44:53] big party, and I said, "Brother Jeff, I
[44:56] don't have one clue what I'm preaching
[44:59] this morning.
[45:01] No one clue.
[45:04] I was trying to get out of the way. I
[45:05] was trying to pray. I was trying to
[45:07] stand on my head.
[45:10] And I just hung up from him." And it
[45:13] just went
[45:15] I was going somewhere at 10:30. I told
[45:17] brother Jeff I was I already had an
[45:18] appointment to go somewhere at 10:30 and
[45:20] I was just on my iPad sprinting as fast
[45:22] as it could come in my
[45:29] &gt;&gt; brother Bram said regarding the the man
[45:31] that give the two pence. He said he
[45:33] brought the wounded person to the church
[45:36] and the two pence he give them in one
[45:38] quote was salvation and healing.
[45:44] And the other one, another quote he gave
[45:47] him, he said he brought them to the
[45:49] church and he gave him two pence and it
[45:51] was the spirit and the word.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; And you know when we look on this, you
[45:57] know, the Bible talks about the
[45:59] priesthood and and the Levites and it
[46:01] mentioned this in the scripture, but in
[46:03] Revelations 1:6, it said, "Heath has
[46:05] made us all
[46:07] priests."
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] and all kings. Unto God his father.
[46:14] To him be glory and dominion forever and
[46:17] ever. Amen. We're supposed to be all
[46:21] in this boat of compassion and ministry.
[46:24] And you know, ministry is living for
[46:26] others.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam, I just have some some
[46:35] thoughts here from him. He said, "You
[46:37] know, when you get the Holy Spirit,
[46:38] remember, you're going to be judged for
[46:41] what you've done
[46:43] &gt;&gt; with it."
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; See, you didn't get this revelation
[46:50] to not show compassion.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "You might receive Christ by
[46:54] the Holy Ghost,
[46:56] but you'll be condemned. Every man that
[46:58] judged according to the works he done in
[47:00] his body, you'll be condemned by how you
[47:02] kept it to yourself." You know, I was
[47:04] looking through a set of quotes where
[47:06] where where and I I know it's out there,
[47:08] but Brother Bram said, you know, if you
[47:10] had a chance to witness or or the ones
[47:12] that will be lost, there will be a
[47:13] certain amount of responsibility on us.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; There will be a certain amount of
[47:18] responsibility. Ones that are lost in my
[47:20] circle and ones that are lost in your
[47:22] circle, God will consider, did you ever
[47:25] do what you could to show them the
[47:27] truth? Can you imagine when we get in
[47:29] heaven and we're judging the world cuz
[47:31] we're the bride. We're in the rapture.
[47:32] Now, we've went in the rapture and we're
[47:34] ready to judge the world. And the very
[47:36] people we're getting to judge say, "I
[47:37] lived right beside brother Dale. He
[47:38] never ever told me who Jesus was."
[47:46] &gt;&gt; You know what you're going to do? You're
[47:48] going to get small
[47:50] lur
[47:53] &gt;&gt; and you're going to want to disappear.
[47:55] Yeah.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Here the prophet said, he said, "After
[48:02] you've received the Holy Ghost, what
[48:04] have you done with it?" He didn't say
[48:07] like, "Who did you correct by the seven
[48:08] seals?"
[48:10] So, what have you done with it? Have you
[48:12] talked to your neighbor?
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Here, another one. And he said, "We're
[48:19] going to be judged
[48:21] according to what we've done about him
[48:24] that's in our heart."
[48:27] Amen.
[48:29] Here's And sorry Vicki, I'm just You're
[48:32] doing a fantastic Here's another one. He
[48:34] said, "Now the first thing I would say
[48:35] is Jesus never lived for himself. His
[48:38] life was spent for others. That's
[48:40] perfectly eternal life." and you say,
[48:44] you know, I'm a I go to church and I've
[48:46] done these good things and I'm a message
[48:47] believer and I live my life to yourself
[48:50] and you haven't got eternal life.
[48:53] Now, you don't get mad at me. You have
[48:55] to get mad at Brother Brham. He said,
[48:57] "Eternal life is living for others."
[49:00] &gt;&gt; So, here's brother Brandham backing up
[49:02] what Jesus said and he said, "Eternal
[49:03] life ain't coming to this message,
[49:04] church.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Eternal life might not even believe in
[49:08] this message because Satan believes it,
[49:11] too.
[49:13] But he ain't living for others. He's
[49:14] destroying others. And that's what the
[49:15] spirit is sometimes on.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; And it's proved to come by the lamb of
[49:25] God. And he lived and he had eternal
[49:27] life because he did not live for
[49:28] himself. He lived for others. And and
[49:30] you receive eternal life by receiving
[49:33] that day. You don't live for yourself no
[49:36] more. You live for others. That's that
[49:38] day on Calvary.
[49:41] He said, "I don't care what a man's done
[49:43] if he's sincere in his heart and you're
[49:46] right in your belief. You're wrong for
[49:48] acting the way you acting."
[49:50] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the priest that
[49:53] passed by the person that was bleeding
[49:56] to death.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; You know, like when you're going down
[49:58] the 401, you got an appointment. Say,
[50:00] "Well, it's not my accident."
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:10] Amen.
[50:13] He said, "I'd rather be the place be in
[50:16] yours." That's right. He said, "I'd
[50:17] rather be wrong in my doctrine and right
[50:20] in my compassion."
[50:22] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says that out of the
[50:24] abundance of the heart, the m the mouth
[50:26] speaketh.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Because I'd rather be wrong in my
[50:31] doctrine, right in my heart, than to be
[50:33] right in my doctrine. After all, it's
[50:36] the heart conditioned.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; See, so we got the doctrine right.
[50:42] But do we feel sorry for a sin? Are do
[50:45] is he going to put a mark on our
[50:47] forehead because we sigh and cry for the
[50:49] abominations committed in the world?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That mark was the protection. It was the
[50:56] token. Amen. It was the baptism of the
[50:59] Holy Ghost.
[51:01] First Corinthians, you know, here here's
[51:03] Paul and this was an amazing. He said,
[51:05] you know, he said, I don't come to you.
[51:10] He said, and brethren, verse one of 2
[51:13] Corinthians, he said, and brother, when
[51:15] I came to you, I came not with excellent
[51:18] speech and of wisdom.
[51:22] Now, wisdom is declaring the word of
[51:23] God, declaring unto you the testimony of
[51:27] the revealed word of our day.
[51:32] That's what Paul said.
[51:37] For I am determined to say no nothing
[51:40] save Jesus Christ
[51:43] and him crucified which is a sacrifice.
[51:48] But watch verse four.
[51:50] And my speech and my preaching was not
[51:54] with enticing words of men's wisdom, but
[51:56] in demonstration
[51:59] of spirit
[52:01] and power.
[52:03] Now, I want to I want to tell you
[52:04] something in this back to our good
[52:07] Samaritan story. It's the spirit that
[52:10] has compassion.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And if you want to see power,
[52:15] see somebody that's willing to sacrifice
[52:17] their time.
[52:19] Oh, I can't. I got an appointment. Oh, I
[52:23] can't. My wife's taking me out for
[52:25] supper.
[52:27] You know, the Bible talked about that.
[52:28] The people that never had time. I can't.
[52:30] I bought a new piece of property. I
[52:32] bought a herd of cows and I got to go
[52:34] inspect them. Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Uh
[52:38] I I'd like to come to the marriage
[52:40] supper, but I can't because
[52:44] &gt;&gt; you want to see demonstration and power
[52:48] is people that give up their money.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Two pence.
[52:55] I never seen the guy before.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Well, he don't even come to our message
[52:59] church.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Help us, Jesus. And I even offered more
[53:04] pence after.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; It probably was even his fault he got
[53:09] robbed. Probably he was wearing his gold
[53:12] outside.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; See how we justify everything.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I don't come
[53:21] with men's wisdom in demonstration of
[53:25] the spirit and power." That spirit is
[53:28] compassion. And that power is to do
[53:31] something that your body in the flesh is
[53:34] screaming. This is none of your
[53:36] business.
[53:37] Don't get involved.
[53:40] Don't get involved. These aren't your
[53:42] kids. You didn't raise them.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, brother, you know, the
[53:51] Bible says in Mark uh 16, right near the
[53:54] end of the chapter, it says to go into
[53:56] all the world and preach the gospel. And
[53:57] you know, brother Brown commented on
[53:59] that verse 348 times. I tried to go
[54:01] through all the quotes last night and it
[54:03] got really dark outside, but uh I was
[54:06] looking for something in there. But you
[54:07] know, he talked about the multiple times
[54:10] that his kids and his wife would come
[54:12] and say, "Bill,
[54:14] do you have to go away,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; sacrifice,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; compassion,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; living for others,
[54:32] Now remember this was eternal life. So
[54:36] you know it just
[54:43] &gt;&gt; you know the power and the spirit was
[54:48] compassion, brotherly kindness, a
[54:50] sacrifice. Sacrifice is giving up
[54:53] something valuable
[54:55] for someone else less
[54:59] deserving.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; You know,
[55:12] a ain't that something? You know, it
[55:14] this really, you know, why couldn't God
[55:16] give me just a nice, you know, you are
[55:18] the elected bride or something? And that
[55:20] was last Sunday.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; But so many times we we minister and
[55:26] brother Dale's guilty of this. You watch
[55:27] you watch this, you know, and and and
[55:30] God's actually God has actually spoke to
[55:33] me and and literally literally I I kid
[55:36] you not. And you know, different
[55:39] ministers when they minister, the way
[55:43] they minister is to knock somebody else.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want them to come here.
[55:51] I don't care who they are.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; No,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; that's right. Yes, sir.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, that's that's just human
[55:58] nature. You know, if I want to get
[56:00] promoted, I have to tell everybody else
[56:01] I'm smarter than everybody else. I have
[56:03] to step on everybody else's head, kick
[56:05] them, trip them, whatever. You see, and
[56:08] and that's not how God operates.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; But because we're so caught up in the
[56:13] flesh that to get ahead in Christianity,
[56:16] I got to insult somebody else. You don't
[56:19] have to do that.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; This is something I'm learning.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; So, so many times when we minister, we
[56:28] say we're right.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Who said
[56:36] &gt;&gt; you're judging yourself?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; We're right and they're wrong.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Says who?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[56:50] Who told you that?
[56:54] We have the truth and we have Christ and
[56:58] none of the other people do.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram never said that.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Dozens of times he never said that.
[57:14] dozens and dozens and dozens
[57:17] and dozens of times.
[57:24] This is air
[57:28] &gt;&gt; and we shouldn't preach that way.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; See, we shouldn't look or worry about
[57:37] where somebody else's revelation is or
[57:40] even their faith.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because everybody's revelation and
[57:45] faith is different.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you, Simon Barjonah, for
[57:52] flesh and blood never gave this to you,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; but my father
[57:59] &gt;&gt; which is in heaven.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Now that scripture don't matter where
[58:03] you go to church.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Do you know you could be going to the
[58:07] Baptist church uptown and get
[58:09] revelation?
[58:11] Yeah.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; See,
[58:13] &gt;&gt; cuz flesh and blood,
[58:16] &gt;&gt; if you go to church of 700 and it's an
[58:19] amazing pastor, it wasn't the flesh that
[58:22] gave it to you,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; but my father,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; see, it wasn't the flesh that gave me
[58:29] this message cuz I told Jeff, I don't
[58:30] have a clue what maybe I sometimes sell
[58:33] away. Maybe we'll just have testimonies
[58:34] today.
[58:40] But it's my father
[58:43] &gt;&gt; that's in control. It's the spirit. It's
[58:45] the It's the compassion.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; So watch what
[58:50] Brother Bram says.
[58:53] And this is the most powerful quote I've
[58:55] ever read. I seen it this week and I
[58:58] sent it to Pastor Osman and he went,
[59:02] "Wow."
[59:05] He said, 'You know, we're not ashamed of
[59:07] the gospel because we're in fellowship.
[59:10] Hallelujah. And when a man's born of the
[59:12] spirit of God, there's something that
[59:14] happens to him. He's brought into the
[59:16] shikina glory and he's a child of God
[59:19] and faith dwells within him. He's
[59:23] Abraham's seed then and he's died in
[59:25] dead in Christ and taken on Abraham's
[59:28] seed. Oh, the world if they could only
[59:32] know what it was, knew what it was. But
[59:37] hang on to your seats this part. And if
[59:40] you really want to catch the message,
[59:42] read the fake words, the caps. And I
[59:46] tell you now, this is the prophet. See
[59:51] &gt;&gt; where what we've done, where we've made
[59:53] our mistake. Now, he is talking directly
[59:57] to message believers.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; He's not preaching in a Pentecostal
[1:00:02] church. This is a 61 quote.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Is we've denominated.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Bless God. We're the message. We don't
[1:00:12] need to witness no more. We don't need
[1:00:14] to show compassion no more. We don't
[1:00:16] need to hit pick up hitchhikers no more.
[1:00:18] We don't need to stop to pick up people
[1:00:20] that are bleeding on the road no more.
[1:00:23] We don't need to do nothing no more cuz
[1:00:24] we got the revelations. We know the
[1:00:26] seven seals.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; We don't have to do nothing no more. We
[1:00:30] don't care if anybody else gets it. I
[1:00:31] got it. They don't. Too bad for them. So
[1:00:34] sad you're dead.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like the the the the son
[1:00:38] that was at college and he said, "Dad,
[1:00:40] no mud, no fun." The dad rolling back
[1:00:42] said, "Too bad your dad so sad."
[1:00:47] That's how message believers are. When's
[1:00:50] the last time you stopped in your
[1:00:51] neighbors and told them how good God had
[1:00:52] been to you?
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Now, now this is actually the prophet
[1:01:07] that said this.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:01:11] It's okay if I read what the prophet
[1:01:13] said.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You know what? I actually never looked
[1:01:16] for this quote.
[1:01:18] I never seen it before.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now, if you'll excuse me,"
[1:01:26] because he knows the people are hating
[1:01:28] this.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Where we made our mistake is we've tried
[1:01:32] to denominate ourselves
[1:01:35] into eternal life.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Bless God. I'm in a message church. I
[1:01:39] got it. You ain't.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; So sad
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:01:46] We have it. And the rest of them don't
[1:01:49] have it. Says who?
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Says who?
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; The Methodists. Now, now this is still
[1:01:57] your prophet.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God for the screen.
[1:02:02] Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; You would never believe what I'm reading
[1:02:05] you.
[1:02:07] He said
[1:02:09] they don't have it.
[1:02:12] That's what 95% of message believers
[1:02:15] believe.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Sure do.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen because it's
[1:02:19] the truth.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I know exactly where I'm standing.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't make up this message on my own.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; The Methodist, the Baptist, and the
[1:02:31] Presbyterian, they're nothing if they're
[1:02:34] old cold formals. But if you don't watch
[1:02:37] them, you're going to be old cold
[1:02:39] formals, too. We've already arrived to
[1:02:42] that part.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; We've already arrived to that part.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And they're going to pick it up and go
[1:02:47] on. Exactly. Right. And you watch out.
[1:02:50] You'll find yourself
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; denominated.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Because you're just coming in from the
[1:02:58] right and the left everywhere.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:03:07] What must we do to have eternal life?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus falls into a parable. There
[1:03:15] was a man that nobody knew
[1:03:18] that got robbed and injured on the road
[1:03:20] and left for dead.
[1:03:24] And whoever stopped and helped him,
[1:03:30] he said, "You have eternal life. Go and
[1:03:33] live."
[1:03:34] That's eternal life. because that means
[1:03:36] you don't die. The only things that
[1:03:37] don't die is eternal.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; You know, he never said if you believe
[1:03:42] the prophets and the seven se and we
[1:03:44] believe those.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; You know, when Vanessa started singing
[1:03:51] this song, I thought, how in the world
[1:03:54] did God line up everything so perfectly?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; There's nobody's out there whose heart's
[1:04:00] breaking, who a child, there's somebody
[1:04:02] out there feeling alone.
[1:04:05] a husband, a wife
[1:04:08] being done wrong. There's somebody out
[1:04:10] there scattered
[1:04:13] from a broken home.
[1:04:19] Compassion
[1:04:21] is not natural.
[1:04:25] There's somebody out there
[1:04:28] who thought it was cool, taking a
[1:04:31] chance,
[1:04:33] didn't think they would ever lose,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; and now they're hooked on a feeling that
[1:04:40] them empty and a fool.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Well, who would have compassion on that
[1:04:46] person?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; There's one person,
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; and that's Christ.
[1:04:54] That's the spirit of Christ. And if he's
[1:04:57] living inside of us, we will act exactly
[1:05:00] the nature of Christ because watch this.
[1:05:03] I want to go to my next Well, actually,
[1:05:05] we got a scripture here first. Sorry.
[1:05:08] Well, that we're going to skip that one,
[1:05:10] Vicki. That was a parables. The
[1:05:12] disciples came to Jesus and they spoke
[1:05:14] in parables, maybe actually. And you
[1:05:17] know, he says, he said, "It's because
[1:05:18] it's for you to understand the mysteries
[1:05:21] of the kingdom.
[1:05:23] The mysteries is eternal life. It what
[1:05:25] you know what? When we get right down to
[1:05:27] brass tax where the rubber hits the
[1:05:29] road, does anything else matter if
[1:05:31] you're in heaven and have eternal life?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Nothing else. If if I have eternal life
[1:05:41] and I'm in heaven and I'm sitting on the
[1:05:42] throne with my Lord, it don't matter
[1:05:44] where I went to church or what I thought
[1:05:46] or what I believed in anything or what
[1:05:49] how many books I read or nothing. is
[1:05:52] have I got eternal life? Am I gonna be
[1:05:54] the one that makes it?
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said you can have the
[1:05:58] revelation that if everybody's going to
[1:06:00] be lost that you'll be the one that
[1:06:02] makes it.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And he also said your actions will show
[1:06:07] it.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; No matter what you say, you can tell me
[1:06:10] you believe the prophet and praise God,
[1:06:14] but do you show it?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Do you live it?
[1:06:20] When a when a little tiny girl or an old
[1:06:23] grandma has a flat tire, you pull over
[1:06:24] when it's pouring rain, she's sitting
[1:06:26] there like, "I don't know what to do."
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; You say, "You know what? I'd blow right
[1:06:32] by." Say, "Oh, bless God. She's got a
[1:06:33] cell phone."
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; That was a predestinated appointment
[1:06:43] that you could have just said, "Hey, you
[1:06:45] know, God is so good to me. My tires
[1:06:47] didn't go flat."
[1:06:50] and I got the strength to help you
[1:06:51] change yours."
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; She's like, "Whoa, I never seen Christ
[1:06:57] in flesh before, but he just stopped and
[1:06:59] changed my tire."
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:07:09] If we read, I want to read part of this
[1:07:11] Matthew here.
[1:07:13] Therefore he spoke to them in parables
[1:07:16] because they seen they see not.
[1:07:19] This verse 13 and hearing they hear not
[1:07:21] and neither do they understand. See you
[1:07:24] can sit in a message church and hear the
[1:07:25] word that's the truth.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And to under you can hear it but do you
[1:07:32] to understand is to comprehend and live
[1:07:33] it.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; To understand is to change
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; to be like it.
[1:07:44] He said, and you know this was pro verse
[1:07:46] 14 was it was prophecy that hearing they
[1:07:48] should hear and not understand and
[1:07:51] seeing they should see but not perceive.
[1:07:54] That is sitting in the truth but no life
[1:07:57] to show for it.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. But blessed are your eyes for
[1:08:04] they see and your ears for they hear.
[1:08:07] For verily I say unto you, that many of
[1:08:09] the prophets and the righteous men would
[1:08:12] have desired to see those things which
[1:08:14] ye see and have not seen them, nor heed
[1:08:18] those things which ye hear and have not
[1:08:22] heard them. Amen. You know what they
[1:08:25] haven't seen? They haven't seen
[1:08:27] compassion.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; See this supernatural, there was never a
[1:08:31] supernatural man until Christ came on
[1:08:33] the earth.
[1:08:35] There was never a man that went to a
[1:08:36] woman at the well that had six men.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; There was never a there was never an
[1:08:41] appointed time. Do you know she was a
[1:08:43] saraphene the same as a man that waited
[1:08:45] on the man on the the the wounded and
[1:08:48] the good Samaritan?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; She was the ones that you're not
[1:08:52] supposed to be around this well at the
[1:08:53] same time as me
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; because I'm unclean.
[1:08:59] She was the one that we go
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; I never did that.
[1:09:05] And Jesus just flocked to her.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; And your prophet said that he sent his
[1:09:10] disciples away because they had a
[1:09:12] religious spirit on them
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; to buy food and they wouldn't accept it.
[1:09:16] And your prophet also said that when the
[1:09:18] disciples came back and seen their
[1:09:21] pastor Jesus Christ talking to a
[1:09:25] they wondered, they questioned that he
[1:09:28] would the anointed one.
[1:09:30] They thought we need to have a business
[1:09:32] meeting. we need to vote this fool out
[1:09:35] cuz if he was the anointed one, he would
[1:09:37] have knew her life.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And he did. And he went to her.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Watch this this here. This next one.
[1:09:49] And and and I just this was I mean this
[1:09:52] literally I got all of this after like
[1:09:55] you know 11 11 after 9:00 on Saturday
[1:09:57] morning. You know,
[1:10:01] here brother Bram's preaching and he's
[1:10:03] right ready to preach and actually the
[1:10:05] people were out of order.
[1:10:08] They needed to read church order and
[1:10:10] doctrine. Bless God cuz somebody started
[1:10:13] speaking in tongues and brother Brandham
[1:10:16] clearly taught that when a minister's
[1:10:17] men god only speaks through one person
[1:10:19] the prophet and brother Brandham
[1:10:21] commends them.
[1:10:25] See, you know, when Osman was here, you
[1:10:26] know, he was showing us stuff. Even
[1:10:28] sometimes God breaks his own laws.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Like when he told the prophet Isaiah to
[1:10:34] take all his clothes off for 30 days.
[1:10:36] That's breaking your own law.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; So here, Brother Bram, so somebody, he's
[1:10:46] right in the middle of preaching. He
[1:10:47] said, "I wonder right now while the Holy
[1:10:49] Spirit was just speaking, he was
[1:10:51] preaching and why he stopped me and let
[1:10:55] them last remarks."
[1:10:57] Somebody cut brother Brandham off
[1:10:58] preaching to speak in tongues. And why
[1:11:02] he did that was to bring down that I
[1:11:04] have something that I'm going to say.
[1:11:06] And he said, "I had something I was
[1:11:07] going to say about the blood." He said,
[1:11:10] "I'm right in the middle of preaching."
[1:11:11] Somebody just burst out and and we know
[1:11:13] that would be out of order. He taught
[1:11:15] that in church order and doctrine. But
[1:11:17] here the brother Brown saying,
[1:11:20] "Wow, God was in charge." He said, "Why
[1:11:23] did he do that?" Because he spoke this
[1:11:26] interpretation so nobody would know. So,
[1:11:30] so, so, so you would know that it was
[1:11:32] him speaking. And he gave a witness and
[1:11:35] said, "Let's worship the prophet.
[1:11:43] Don't pay no attention to the clay.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; But it's the message that's true.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram's commending it. It was
[1:11:57] even done outside of church order and
[1:11:59] doctrine.
[1:12:01] And it was done through speaking in
[1:12:02] tongues.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "God did that so you
[1:12:06] wouldn't think it was coming out of my
[1:12:07] mouth and I was special."
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:14] I say, let's read on.
[1:12:17] There it is. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:12:20] Shake off these shackles and get loose
[1:12:22] so you really can enter in to shine
[1:12:25] glory where the shikina fell. And that's
[1:12:27] the fellowship, the blood of Jesus
[1:12:29] Christ, making all you Methodists,
[1:12:32] Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, and all
[1:12:34] of you one in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:12:41] And thanks be to God. Oh my brother. H
[1:12:45] that was good.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, you think I'm crazy,
[1:12:51] but I'm not. I'm not. I know exactly
[1:12:54] where I am, but this is a glorious
[1:12:56] feeling of the spirit of God that's came
[1:12:58] down here in the the West Coast." And
[1:13:00] he's talking. Let's jump to the next.
[1:13:03] And God hopes the word in these visions
[1:13:05] because he promised it. And while the
[1:13:07] same God that promised it promised the
[1:13:09] kind of glory would be in his people.
[1:13:12] And see, it's the same God that's just
[1:13:14] in another form.
[1:13:17] It's the same God just in a another
[1:13:19] form.
[1:13:21] Just the same God in another form
[1:13:25] bringing you another blessing. Wow.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] And oh, if I could just if everybody
[1:13:33] could catch that and get in one accord,
[1:13:35] wouldn't it be wonderful? Oh, wouldn't
[1:13:37] it be glorious? The sick would be
[1:13:39] healed, the lame would walk, and you
[1:13:40] would the leopard the would the lame
[1:13:43] would leap
[1:13:44] and the sinner would be weeping their
[1:13:46] way to Calvary. The shikina glory
[1:13:48] falling all around. Wouldn't it even be
[1:13:51] go home tonight? We wouldn't even leave
[1:13:54] the church because the presence of God
[1:13:57] would be so real.
[1:13:59] Let's go to the next paragraph. Oh,
[1:14:01] hallelujah. I love him. And his glorious
[1:14:03] mercy endures forever. And he's truly
[1:14:05] truly the son of the living God. And
[1:14:07] Jesus Christ, there's no other. He's the
[1:14:10] true son of the living God. He's our
[1:14:12] savior, our healer, our king, our
[1:14:14] prince, our life, and our joy and our
[1:14:16] health. And he's all of us. He's all in
[1:14:20] all of us.
[1:14:22] He's all in all of us.
[1:14:25] How wonderful
[1:14:28] we ought to be willing to present to him
[1:14:30] and to his people. He's in. Now, I don't
[1:14:33] think you caught that. He's He's all in
[1:14:36] all to us. That's the
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; That's the Methodist, the Baptist, the
[1:14:46] Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and the
[1:14:48] robber on the side of the road.
[1:14:51] and the woman at the well and the
[1:14:54] Samaritan.
[1:14:57] Remember the spirit
[1:15:00] that Brother Bram said that's around
[1:15:02] this message
[1:15:04] is denominating.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; We got it and they don't.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; And that's a denominational spirit. And
[1:15:13] he said it's denominational walls. And
[1:15:16] he said, "The reason I hate the
[1:15:18] denominational spirit is it separates
[1:15:21] God's people."
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; It's doing that in the message ranks.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; In the message ranks, well, I will never
[1:15:28] go to your camp. Well, I'm not going to
[1:15:30] your place. Well, well, we believe in,
[1:15:32] you know,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; we believe we believe
[1:15:37] it's walls. God never intended that.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you believe.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] You can still be my friend.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You can believe whatever you want.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm preaching the word of God. I'm
[1:15:54] preaching what the prophet said in the
[1:15:56] Bible. I mean, I'm preaching what Jesus
[1:15:59] preached.
[1:16:01] Wow.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] This world's dying
[1:16:09] for compassion.
[1:16:11] it. You know, it's like brother Brandt,
[1:16:12] you don't think Brother Brandham
[1:16:13] preached message like this. Like
[1:16:15] remember the the kids that were down the
[1:16:16] well and they turned the lights out and
[1:16:18] it was black dark
[1:16:21] and the one girl started screaming at
[1:16:23] the top of her lungs.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And her brother said, you know, he had
[1:16:28] the Holy Ghost. He was only two, but he
[1:16:30] had the Holy Ghost. Don't worry, sister.
[1:16:33] Said they can turn the light on him.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I I want somebody that
[1:16:39] can turn. I want a God with skin on
[1:16:40] could turn the light on.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the world's looking for.
[1:16:45] They're not looking for the seven seals.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Contrary to your popular belief, don't
[1:16:49] go to the grocery store and start
[1:16:50] telling them that God sent a prophet and
[1:16:52] the seven seals are revealed.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hold the door for him.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hold the door for them.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; If they only got a couple items, just
[1:17:02] say, "Add that to my tab."
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And they'll fall over. Yeah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; He'll fall over and they say, "I never
[1:17:10] seen a Christ that spoke
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; like this ever before."
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; I never seen a Christ that ever spoke
[1:17:18] like this before.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; And a lawyer got up and tried to tempt
[1:17:26] Jesus
[1:17:28] and said, "What must I do
[1:17:33] to have eternal life?
[1:17:38] How would you answer that? Well, you'd
[1:17:41] have to believe that God sent a prophet.
[1:17:43] You'd have to have a home church and go
[1:17:45] to a message tabernacle. You'd have to
[1:17:47] take communion footwashing. You know,
[1:17:49] you'd have
[1:17:53] those are all wonderful and we believe
[1:17:56] them. But Jesus never answered it that
[1:17:58] way.
[1:18:05] Jesus never answered it that way,
[1:18:09] you know, eternal life.
[1:18:14] And he never gave him one scripture.
[1:18:18] I'm like, you're kidding. He never even
[1:18:21] said, "You must be born again." Which we
[1:18:23] believe that, and that's Bible.
[1:18:26] But why didn't Jesus say that?
[1:18:31] Why?
[1:18:32] Can somebody help me? Why didn't Jesus
[1:18:34] say that?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; What must I do to have eternal life? I
[1:18:37] said, 'Well, you must be born again.
[1:18:39] What's that mean? Go into my mother's
[1:18:40] womb and be born out again. No, no, just
[1:18:42] to speak.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:18:46] Jesus never said that.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Compassion.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; No, not I just just a timeout clip here.
[1:18:58] That wasn't compassion to somebody that
[1:19:00] you've known in the church for 30 years.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; That would be a big enough shock for
[1:19:06] most of us.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; But this is somebody that
[1:19:11] you ain't never seen
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:19:19] And Jesus said himself to the lawyer, he
[1:19:23] said, "You go do this
[1:19:26] and ye shall live
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; and not die." That means you will have
[1:19:32] eternal life.
[1:19:36] You just ask yourself,
[1:19:39] is that what you thought eternal life
[1:19:41] was?
[1:19:43] Is that what you think all the message
[1:19:46] churches and the campaigns and the and
[1:19:48] the camp meetings and all them are doing
[1:19:52] around the world
[1:19:55] is portraying what Jesus said was
[1:19:58] eternal life. all the great teachers
[1:20:01] that are getting into the mysteries and
[1:20:03] the doctrines.
[1:20:06] The bottom line is the bottom line when
[1:20:07] you come right down to the bottom of all
[1:20:09] those mysteries, am I going to be in
[1:20:11] heaven?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Am I going to have eternal life? You
[1:20:15] know what eternal life means? It means
[1:20:17] you never had a beginning.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; That means you're a part of him.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; The himymn is Jehovah. That's right.
[1:20:26] So,
[1:20:30] wow.
[1:20:41] Brother Osman preached this at the camp
[1:20:44] meeting
[1:20:45] and
[1:20:48] I'm not going to read it. It's a long
[1:20:49] one. But he said, "We have the order
[1:20:52] from God to discern spirits."
[1:20:57] Trying the spirits. It's a great lesson
[1:20:59] in the church today is to try the
[1:21:01] spirits of everything. Watch. He says,
[1:21:05] well, I see trying the spirits of
[1:21:07] everything and and have discernment of
[1:21:09] the spirits. I do not think that we
[1:21:11] should ever by any means judge a person
[1:21:16] by their doctrine of denomination
[1:21:20] that they belong to or by what group
[1:21:23] they're assembled with. We should never
[1:21:24] judge a man and he names a bunch of
[1:21:27] churches. But we should judge a man
[1:21:31] we should never judge a man by his
[1:21:33] denomination but we should always judge
[1:21:36] him by his spirit. Now, what did Paul
[1:21:40] say? I came in spirit and power.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't just come with a denomination.
[1:21:49] He said, see, I never came with
[1:21:51] wonderful words. That's the
[1:21:53] denominational creed part.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Said, but I came in spirit and in power.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; So I never told you, you know, what all
[1:22:04] the seven seals is and you know how
[1:22:06] often you should do communion and
[1:22:08] whether sisters can wear a hat in church
[1:22:10] and and you know and and
[1:22:13] I never I was that was just man's works
[1:22:17] but I came in spirit and in
[1:22:19] demonstration of spirit and power.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; He said we should always judge a man by
[1:22:24] his spirit.
[1:22:31] I
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a news flash.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; There's people outside of our ranks.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That could have a better spirit than us.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; And I had somebody come to me one time.
[1:22:48] I said that about somebody and they
[1:22:51] said, "We're offended because they don't
[1:22:53] believe the prophet.
[1:22:56] And this is the prophet.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; That's the prophet.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; I said right from this pulpit that our
[1:23:05] neighbors that lived in the house next
[1:23:06] door have done more for this church and
[1:23:09] have a better spirit
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; than I have sometimes.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; I didn't point to you.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; How I even shock you. I would like to
[1:23:23] have his Christ.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And he goes to the Pentecostal church in
[1:23:28] Victoria.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And I have somebody that don't come here
[1:23:39] no more. He said, "I'm offended because
[1:23:41] you said that because they don't believe
[1:23:42] in the prophet."
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "It's not where
[1:23:45] you go to church."
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; And you know why it's a spirit? It's
[1:23:50] because it's a God is a spirit
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and God is love. The very definition of
[1:23:56] God. How do you describe God? Love.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Love. And well, how do you describe him
[1:24:00] physically? Spirit.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; What's the definition of love?
[1:24:04] Compassion.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Compassion. So, so I could go to the
[1:24:10] wrong church and have the wrong
[1:24:11] doctrine, but I got the spirit of love
[1:24:13] and compassion,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; and God will correct me in his own good
[1:24:19] time.
[1:24:20] Oh, this message is the truth, but it
[1:24:22] don't always have the right spirit.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Gar.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I don't always have the right spirit.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; I got Lang staff in me. Bless God. They
[1:24:35] deserve that.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. There's some more Lang
[1:24:39] staffs in here. You got a different Lang
[1:24:41] staff. But
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; hello. It's called flesh lang staff. Oh,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; those
[1:24:51] spirit.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Judge them by their spirit.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; We are to discern the spirit. You know
[1:25:01] why the spirit is? Cuz they could have
[1:25:02] the spirit of Jehovah like the good
[1:25:05] Samaritan,
[1:25:07] but he was religiously
[1:25:10] pagan.
[1:25:18] And I'm going to just bypass brother
[1:25:20] Brandon. I'm going to go right to the
[1:25:21] head. Jesus. And he said, "If you do
[1:25:24] that, you shall have eternal life."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; That should make you all speak in
[1:25:32] tongues.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:25:46] Wow,
[1:25:57] verse 12,
[1:26:00] paragraph 12. Now I want to get this to
[1:26:03] the church this morning.
[1:26:07] Which in the different denominations
[1:26:09] that you're still
[1:26:11] the church of the living God
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:26:18] Now now
[1:26:20] you don't have to believe that. But then
[1:26:22] don't tell me you're a message believer
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; because I have a message believer come
[1:26:26] and say I'm offended because you said
[1:26:27] that. Because those denominations don't
[1:26:29] believe in the William Mary Brown.
[1:26:32] Well, William, Mary, and Brandham said
[1:26:33] that.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I'm confused. Sister Patty, I can I come
[1:26:37] for you for counseling?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Like, are you tied up Monday about 10?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; I'll bring my wife. I'm like I'm like
[1:26:46] I'm trying to pull my hair.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the thing I want you to
[1:26:56] get. See that we're really not divided.
[1:27:00] Oh yes we are. Oh, I'm going to correct
[1:27:03] the prophet here. Oh yes we are. When's
[1:27:06] the last time you went to one of those
[1:27:07] churches? I went Friday night. I
[1:27:10] normally couldn't say that but my
[1:27:11] brother had a service.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; You know it won't kill you.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; It actually won't kill you.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Especially if you're not missing
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; a regular service.
[1:27:25] What's wrong with going on a Friday
[1:27:26] night or I meant to go Saturday morning
[1:27:28] but but my anointing was too strong and
[1:27:31] the way said you got 20 minutes to get
[1:27:33] dressed and be there and I
[1:27:36] and I just stayed with my iPad. Sorry,
[1:27:38] brother Jeff. I I didn't know I was
[1:27:40] going to lie to you ahead of time, but
[1:27:41] it was just when it came, you know.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? It's God is a
[1:27:47] spirit and those that worship him must
[1:27:48] worship him in spirit and truth. Paul
[1:27:51] said, "I don't come with creeds and
[1:27:52] dogmas and fancy words, but in power and
[1:27:55] demonstration of spirit and power."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Compassion,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; when you pull money out of your pocket
[1:28:05] for somebody that you ain't never seen
[1:28:06] before,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; forget it. They don't deserve it.
[1:28:14] Neither did I. Yeah,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve Jesus to come
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; and be bit, beat, hung on a cross.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; See, now I want to just give you a quick
[1:28:26] news flash. This is a message.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Believe in the seals is not the message.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Even believing the prophet, this is what
[1:28:40] he said.
[1:28:42] Oh, I don't you can't you can't all say
[1:28:44] amen. That would just hurt your
[1:28:46] constitution.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God for Vicki. I'm going to raise
[1:28:54] give your race.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Look at that.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You don't like that, do you?
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; You know why you don't like that?
[1:29:03] because you have a denominational
[1:29:05] spirit.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Help us
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; and it's flesh to say, "I'm better than
[1:29:09] the rest,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; and so I deserve to be promoted."
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But you know what your Bible says?
[1:29:17] The first shall be last
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; and the last shall go first.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hate that scripture. Oh. Oh, I
[1:29:27] hate that.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I don't like that one.
[1:29:38] I tell you what,
[1:29:40] you won't hear a message like this in
[1:29:41] most message churches.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz they don't want you to go to any of
[1:29:45] those other places.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz they're concerned
[1:29:48] about that there thing right there.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm just I know I'm a bit
[1:29:59] stupid. I feel grade one. It took me a
[1:30:01] couple years to get through grade one,
[1:30:03] but he ain't buying Nobody's buying me
[1:30:05] with money.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, if I want to do that, what I
[1:30:11] just serve the devil.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; He'll give me a lot more stuff than
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; See, I never decided to serve God
[1:30:20] because he would give me money.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; He'd give me blessings, but not
[1:30:23] necessarily money.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:30] Oh, I'd like to get blessed.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory,
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; boys. That's just that's good stuff.
[1:30:40] Tell you what, you going to put flashing
[1:30:42] lights on this when you send this
[1:30:43] message out, Vicki. Say a must listen to
[1:30:47] the whole world might have eternal life.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. even message churches
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; because you have the message. You have
[1:31:00] no right to snub anybody.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; You actually should know what it took to
[1:31:09] save you.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; And you should have more compassion on
[1:31:13] the ones that ain't received yet.
[1:31:16] Oh Lord, if you know the Bible says,
[1:31:18] "Don't reveal the sins of my youth."
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody to know about them.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; But then you go and put it on Facebook
[1:31:27] about everything else that everybody
[1:31:28] else got done wrong.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; That's not my job.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; My job is just banding people up.
[1:31:39] Yes.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; All these believers I I'm I'm going to
[1:31:43] close in a couple hours. All these
[1:31:45] believers and as we could hours and
[1:31:48] these way a bunch of chance is a bunch
[1:31:50] of ch change sorry out of your pocket
[1:31:54] that's in God's hands. And I I've read
[1:31:56] this one before. I I'm sorry for a
[1:31:58] repeat. It's been a month or so.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And you pull all this change out and
[1:32:04] there's pennies and nickels and dimes
[1:32:06] and quarters and half dollars. Vicki,
[1:32:08] but you know, I said a couple of these
[1:32:09] quotes I'm going to get framed and like
[1:32:13] 28 by 16 nice letters with clouds over
[1:32:17] and put them quotes
[1:32:19] if you want. And then on the top I'm
[1:32:20] going to put if wanted eternal life.
[1:32:26] And and there's all this different
[1:32:28] change. And now that's what the world is
[1:32:31] in God's hands. Yeah.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, by the way, this is actually the
[1:32:35] prophet. And this is a 64 quote. So,
[1:32:39] this is actually after all the
[1:32:41] revelation came to the prophet.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're not going to like that. Oh,
[1:32:48] you got to get the We got to get the
[1:32:49] name up there before we leave, Vicki.
[1:32:51] It's a God's word calls a total
[1:32:54] separation from unbelief. You thought
[1:32:56] unbelief was not believing the message.
[1:32:58] This was unbelief right here.
[1:33:01] Now, that's what the world is in God's
[1:33:03] hands. And some people are just a
[1:33:05] pennies worth and God can only use them
[1:33:07] for a penny away and all that they can
[1:33:09] buy. But don't reject them.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, they don't come to us. They don't
[1:33:13] come to Wyoming, Sister Donna. They
[1:33:15] don't come there. They don't come here.
[1:33:16] I'm not going to talk to them. I'm not
[1:33:18] going to talk to them. They never came
[1:33:20] to my company.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, but the prophet said
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; it didn't matter.
[1:33:28] It didn't matter.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't reject them if they
[1:33:32] can't believe the real truth." And the
[1:33:34] message is the real truth.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Don't turn them down.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Don't turn them down.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Don't kick them up. You know, Moses
[1:33:43] never got to go to the promised land,
[1:33:45] but Moses is saved.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Saw God pulled his spirit off of Saul.
[1:33:51] Saul was a dummy. He was a real dummy.
[1:33:55] He was concerned about popularity. What
[1:33:57] a dummy. and he lost everything. God
[1:33:59] calls the spirit off Saul,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; but Saul was with the prophet.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't turn them down. Don't
[1:34:08] kick them out." Oh, well, you already
[1:34:10] done that. Sorry, God.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And say that they're not in it. Well,
[1:34:15] no, of course they're not in it because
[1:34:16] they don't know the God sent a prophet.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said,
[1:34:24] "I'm confused.
[1:34:27] Because God uses pennies.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; A lot was just a penny and Abraham was a
[1:34:34] silver dollar. So it taken 100 lots to
[1:34:38] make an Abraham. Now this is in a 64. Do
[1:34:41] you know this is about a year after the
[1:34:43] seals were revealed?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Can you believe it? You can't believe
[1:34:48] it. I can tell.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; I wish somebody say amen. I got to get
[1:34:52] my poster up. Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] Yeah.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; You don't believe that.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; You don't live like you believe it.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Most of your associates don't live like
[1:35:05] they believe it.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Most of the places you would go to visit
[1:35:09] church don't believe like they believe
[1:35:10] that.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; This is after the seals people.
[1:35:15] This is after the fullness of the
[1:35:17] godhead bodily had come and revelation
[1:35:19] and visions to our prophet.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; I know what you're thinking. He must
[1:35:25] have made a mistake.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Well, if that's what you think, just
[1:35:33] help make yourself happy. Second
[1:35:35] Ephesians or Ephesians 2 8 and 10. For
[1:35:39] by grace are you saved through faith and
[1:35:42] not of yourself. It is a gift of God,
[1:35:45] not of works, lest any man
[1:35:50] should boast.
[1:35:52] Ephesians 64 and6 says that your
[1:35:55] righteousness of being a message
[1:35:58] believer is like filthy rags in God's
[1:36:01] nose.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Do you want eternal life?"
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Who's your neighbor? Your neighbor is
[1:36:16] somebody that you don't know.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Your neighbor is somebody
[1:36:20] you've never seen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; I mean, it might be somebody you've
[1:36:24] seen, but it could be somebody you've
[1:36:26] never seen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; The lawyer asked Jesus, "Who is my
[1:36:31] neighbor?"
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And he went into the parable about the
[1:36:35] guy that was robbed on the road.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Never seen him. Never ever ever ever
[1:36:43] seen him before.
[1:36:46] Compassion.
[1:36:48] is filthy rags
[1:36:51] and we fade away real quick. Verse
[1:36:53] seven, and none are called upon my name
[1:36:55] as stirth up him, taketh hold of thee.
[1:36:59] I want to jump to verse eight there. But
[1:37:01] now, oh Lord, thou art our father, and
[1:37:04] we are the clay,
[1:37:07] and thou art the potter,
[1:37:10] and we are all the work. and we are all
[1:37:14] the work
[1:37:17] of thy hand.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Our next example
[1:37:26] of our prophet, another new one I've
[1:37:29] never read to you before. Well, the more
[1:37:32] than a disgrace to Jesus Christ
[1:37:36] is the church in disunityity.
[1:37:40] And it's just about the coming of the
[1:37:42] Lord to loose. It's the very next quote
[1:37:45] on my thing.
[1:37:49] More than a disgrace to Jesus Christ.
[1:37:53] More than a disgrace. Let that sink in
[1:37:55] for a minute. It's more than a disgrace
[1:37:57] to Jesus Christ. By the way, this is
[1:38:00] your prophet saying this.
[1:38:04] And it's almost the end of the Lord
[1:38:06] coming. and he's loosened the antichrist
[1:38:08] spirit on the earth and we are separated
[1:38:12] with denominational
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; barriers.
[1:38:17] I'm a Methodist. I'm a oneness. You
[1:38:21] couldn't shake my I'm a b Oh, maybe I
[1:38:23] did read this one before. I just
[1:38:24] remembered I put in these brackets. I
[1:38:27] believe in church order. I'm assembly of
[1:38:30] God. I'm in United Pentecostal. I
[1:38:33] believe in tongues and prophecy.
[1:38:36] And I don't believe in there's no more
[1:38:37] grace. It's all over. And we're all
[1:38:40] separated by our It isn't all over, by
[1:38:42] the way. But see, we built up walls.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; We built up walls. And we can't even
[1:38:48] visit each other's household some of the
[1:38:50] time because we got walls.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Walls,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; but we don't have compassion.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And what is any of us? Nothing.
[1:39:01] But what God would let us be. It's all
[1:39:04] by the grace of God. You know today,
[1:39:08] your revelation today is by the grace.
[1:39:12] Blessed are you,
[1:39:14] Simon Barjonah. Blessed are you. Put
[1:39:16] your name in there. For God revealed
[1:39:19] what he has to you.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; But what are you doing with it?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It's a condition of the heart.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; If you're arrogant, you're not even
[1:39:28] converted.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; You're not even converted.
[1:39:33] Well, well, let you can break that down.
[1:39:35] Did Christ Jesus come to the earth
[1:39:37] arrogant?
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And in all the grace of God, so let's
[1:39:43] look to him and praise him. He said,
[1:39:47] "Now we deal with all you bunches." And
[1:39:49] that's right. He said, "I care the
[1:39:51] sponsors of the meetings." And he said,
[1:39:52] "It doesn't make any difference to me."
[1:39:55] He said, "I'm glad that one then the
[1:39:57] other can do it, but it doesn't matter
[1:39:59] to me. I don't even know which is which
[1:40:03] and where it is. I don't care as long as
[1:40:05] you're a Christian.
[1:40:08] As long as you love the Lord. If you
[1:40:10] love I love you. And if you don't love
[1:40:12] the Lord, I love you anyway. Oh, that's
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; that's weird.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to do what? When we meet
[1:40:26] one another on the street. Oh, he's
[1:40:29] going right back to the good Samaritan.
[1:40:37] Have the greatest compassion,
[1:40:41] fellowship,
[1:40:43] and fellowship. And prayer meeting,
[1:40:45] prayer meeting together. And if you'll
[1:40:47] do this, it'll break down the
[1:40:50] barriers.
[1:40:53] And God won't have some of these people
[1:40:54] going around the country that have a lot
[1:40:56] of inspirations
[1:40:58] and you'll be
[1:41:02] it'll be him. Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; My last scripture
[1:41:08] and I got part two.
[1:41:11] Praise God for part two. It saved the
[1:41:13] day. Isaiah
[1:41:16] 41.
[1:41:18] Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be
[1:41:21] not dismayed. Verse 10. Be not dismayed,
[1:41:24] for I am thy God. I will strengthen
[1:41:27] thee. I will help thee, and yay, I will
[1:41:29] uphold thee with the right hand of thy
[1:41:32] fellowship. Now, I want to just jump
[1:41:34] down. I might read this next Sunday, but
[1:41:36] I want to jump to 17 because we need to
[1:41:38] close.
[1:41:40] Amen. That we a lot longer than the
[1:41:42] service we were at the other night.
[1:41:44] Amen.
[1:41:46] And when the poor and needy seek water,
[1:41:50] there is none. and their tongue faileth
[1:41:53] for thirst. I the Lord will hear them. I
[1:41:59] the God of Israel will not forsake them.
[1:42:02] I will open rivers in high places and
[1:42:05] fountains in the midst of the valleys.
[1:42:07] And I will make the wilderness a pool of
[1:42:09] water in the dry lands a spring of
[1:42:11] water. And I will plant the wilderness
[1:42:13] with cedar trees, cedar and different
[1:42:17] trees
[1:42:18] and murf and the oil trees. And I will
[1:42:21] set in the desert fig trees and the pine
[1:42:24] and the box trees together that they may
[1:42:27] see and know and consider and understand
[1:42:30] together
[1:42:32] that it was God.
[1:42:35] It was the hand of the Lord that hath
[1:42:37] done this and the Holy One of Israel
[1:42:43] has created him.
[1:42:49] I'll do this so the world will know and
[1:42:53] they will see
[1:42:55] that it's not natural
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; to have compassion
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; to have brotherly kindness. It's not
[1:43:04] natural
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; but it's eternal life.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; It is completely.
[1:43:16] What must I do to be saved?
[1:43:20] Love thy neighbor
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; with action.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Love thy neighbor with action. Let's
[1:43:28] stand. Vanessa, we need you to come sing
[1:43:29] this song.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Put the words up if we got it.
[1:43:35] There's somebody out there hurt and
[1:43:39] confused.
[1:43:41] That just about explains everybody in
[1:43:43] the world.
[1:43:45] If you're not hurt, you're confused.
[1:43:49] An innocent child that's being abused.
[1:43:52] There's somebody out there
[1:43:56] whose heart
[1:43:58] is broken
[1:44:01] in two.
[1:44:04] Wow. There's somebody out there. The
[1:44:06] whole world is feeling alone.
[1:44:11] A husband, a wife
[1:44:13] being done wrong.
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:16] There's somebody out there that's
[1:44:17] scattered from a broken
[1:44:20] home. Do you know a broken home is about
[1:44:22] 70 high 70s maybe low 80s%.
[1:44:28] What are you doing about it?
[1:44:31] Yeah, it's our job to do something about
[1:44:33] it. At least go there and show
[1:44:34] compassion.
[1:44:36] I didn't say counsel them.
[1:44:39] I said just go and show compassion.
[1:44:42] There's somebody broken and Christ's
[1:44:44] spirit wants to minister to them through
[1:44:49] you.
[1:44:52] Through you.
[1:44:56] What do you want to do to have eternal
[1:44:59] life?
[1:45:01] There's somebody out there with arms
[1:45:03] wide open wide
[1:45:06] who longs to embrace you, draw the tears
[1:45:09] from your eyes. He's hope for the
[1:45:12] hopeless. There's just one person that
[1:45:14] qualifies for that. Christ.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; He'll carry your burdens. And when you
[1:45:20] don't have a prayer,
[1:45:23] there's just one person you can ask.
[1:45:25] He's your best friend. Christ.
[1:45:29] And Christ is walking.
[1:45:33] He's still in flesh. Oh yeah. He's very
[1:45:35] much in flesh today. You know, the Bible
[1:45:38] says he's always had
[1:45:42] a person. He's always had Elijah the
[1:45:44] prophet thought that he was the only
[1:45:45] one. He's I got 700 ain't bowed to kneel
[1:45:48] to bail.
[1:45:49] He's always had people that were packing
[1:45:53] him.
[1:45:55] Wow. God bless you. Let's sing this
[1:45:57] song. We don't have the words.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; There's somebody out there hurting and
[1:46:05] confused.
[1:46:07] an innocent person
[1:46:10] being abused.
[1:46:12] There's somebody out there whose heart
[1:46:17] is breaking into.
[1:46:21] There's somebody out there feeling
[1:46:25] alone,
[1:46:27] a husband, a wife
[1:46:30] being done wrong. There's somebody out
[1:46:35] there shattered from a broken home.
[1:46:41] But there's somebody out there with arms
[1:46:45] open wide who longs to embrace you dry
[1:46:50] the tears from your eyes. He's hope for
[1:46:54] the hopeless. He'll carry the burdens
[1:46:59] you bear
[1:47:02] when you don't have a prayer.
[1:47:05] There's somebody out there.
[1:47:10] There's somebody out there who thought
[1:47:14] it was cool to keep taking chances,
[1:47:19] thinking they'd never lose.
[1:47:22] Now they're hooked on a feeling that's
[1:47:26] left them emptied and full.
[1:47:30] There's somebody out there who can't
[1:47:34] quite decide
[1:47:37] whether to live
[1:47:39] or whether to die.
[1:47:42] They're searching for strength
[1:47:45] to get through their crisis in life.
[1:47:51] But there's somebody out there with arms
[1:47:56] open wide
[1:47:58] who longs to embrace you, dry the tears
[1:48:02] from your eyes.
[1:48:04] He's hope for the hopeless. He'll carry
[1:48:08] the burdens you bear.
[1:48:12] When you don't have a prayer,
[1:48:16] there's somebody out there.
[1:48:21] There's somebody out there with arms
[1:48:25] open wide
[1:48:27] who longs to embrace you, dry the tears
[1:48:31] from your eyes.
[1:48:34] He's hope for the hopeless. He'll carry
[1:48:38] the burdens you bear.
[1:48:42] When you don't have a prayer,
[1:48:46] there's somebody out there.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord God,
[1:48:57] Lord, you know,
[1:49:00] you know, you gave me all of this this
[1:49:02] morning.
[1:49:04] I couldn't even begin to put that
[1:49:06] together.
[1:49:08] And Lord, we're sorry that we've missed
[1:49:10] the mark.
[1:49:12] Your prophet said, "We've missed what
[1:49:15] God planned for the church by a million
[1:49:17] miles. We've missed evangelizing the
[1:49:20] world. We've missed showing the world
[1:49:23] who Christ is." He said, "After 2,000
[1:49:26] years plus, twothirds of the world have
[1:49:29] never heard the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:49:34] And yet, every other religion
[1:49:36] has done way better. That's false.
[1:49:40] Forgive
[1:49:42] us, Lord God.
[1:49:44] Brother, your prophet, you've seen those
[1:49:47] 340ome
[1:49:48] quotes I was trying to get through. He
[1:49:50] said, "We fell asleep. We were laying on
[1:49:53] the ground. We'd missed it by millions
[1:49:55] and millions of miles,
[1:49:59] sharing the gospel of Christ,
[1:50:02] which was eternal life
[1:50:05] in compassion."
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:08] Wow.
[1:50:11] Forgive me, Jesus.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Jesus. What must we do to
[1:50:17] have eternal life?
[1:50:19] If you do these things, you can go and
[1:50:22] live.
[1:50:24] God, we just ask that you would show us
[1:50:27] this here this morning and and just help
[1:50:31] us to realize the truth and the
[1:50:34] seriousness and the and your plan. What
[1:50:37] it was that you didn't come just with
[1:50:40] words and fancy speech and memorized
[1:50:44] phrases, but you came in power and
[1:50:48] demonstration of the spirit,
[1:50:51] compassion
[1:50:54] to show who the real God was,
[1:50:58] the real spirit of Christ, that he'd go
[1:51:01] to a woman at the well.
[1:51:04] He'd minister to the heart of the hurt
[1:51:08] and the lonely, to the woman caught in
[1:51:10] the very act. And he would say, "Where
[1:51:13] is your accusers?"
[1:51:16] We know that Satan is the accuser of the
[1:51:18] brethren.
[1:51:20] God, help us to see what you plan, what
[1:51:24] you thought we would live. Help us to
[1:51:25] have your nature,
[1:51:28] your spirit
[1:51:30] to walk like you would walk, talk like
[1:51:32] you would talk.
[1:51:34] What would you do?
[1:51:37] What would you do if we pass a robber on
[1:51:40] the road who's bleeding to almost left
[1:51:43] for dead?
[1:51:46] Help us, Jesus.
[1:51:48] Help me, Lord God. Lord, we pray for
[1:51:51] Jeff this Monday as he goes for surgery,
[1:51:55] his hernas. Lord God, we just pray that
[1:51:58] you'll be with the doctors and just may
[1:52:01] it be a a a wonderful healing for our
[1:52:05] brother, Lord God. And Lord, every need
[1:52:08] that's represented here, I pray that you
[1:52:11] would meet it in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:52:14] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:52:18] Be great.
