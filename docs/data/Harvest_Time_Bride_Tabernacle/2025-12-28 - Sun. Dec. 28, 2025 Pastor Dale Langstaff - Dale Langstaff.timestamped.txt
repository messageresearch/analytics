[15:08] Lord, we just pray that you'll bless. We
[15:10] know, Lord, the weather here is freezing
[15:13] rain. And Lord, many are here because of
[15:18] just simply unsafe to move, Lord God.
[15:21] And Lord, I pray that you'll bless them
[15:23] in a special way, Lord God. that's no no
[15:27] fault or responsibility of their own.
[15:30] Lord God, I pray that maybe through
[15:33] technology or the video, they would get
[15:35] a a glimpse of your love. And Lord, we
[15:38] we they are part of your body, Lord God.
[15:42] They're no less because they're not
[15:44] here. It's just not safe this morning.
[15:46] And Lord, we thank you for your love and
[15:50] goodness. In your name, we pray. Lord,
[15:52] we pray that you'd take control of the
[15:54] service, Lord, and we're going to have a
[15:57] little probably change of plans and and
[16:00] Lord, but but you're the boss this
[16:02] morning. You're the boss every morning.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it. In your name we
[16:07] pray. Amen.
[16:10] Amen. God bless you all. It's just good
[16:13] to be in his house.
[16:15] For all those that are online, it was a
[16:18] lot worse in Wyoming than it was in the
[16:21] southern side of Brigden and and
[16:23] Wallisburg, I'm sure. And and Chadam,
[16:26] for sure, it's probably grown flowers
[16:28] already, Chadam. And uh but when we came
[16:31] to the far north where brother Jeff and
[16:34] Sister Dler was, uh the wrath of the
[16:37] rain was much stronger.
[16:40] Man, for all those that are online, we
[16:43] understand you made the right decision.
[16:47] Uh, and we're not sure what we should
[16:49] have done. Amen. Amen. You can maybe be
[16:53] seated for a moment. And uh, so just we
[16:56] were we were very
[17:00] unorganized. Uh, uh, maybe I'll keep you
[17:03] for a second, honey. Um,
[17:06] we we thought we would do communion
[17:08] today. We planned for communion, but I
[17:10] did mention that if the weather was bad,
[17:12] I don't want to do communion in footw
[17:14] Washington, many of our brothers and
[17:16] sisters are not here just because they
[17:20] because of the weather. They they need
[17:22] to be a part of what they want to be and
[17:25] that. So after I read a poem, we're
[17:28] going to open it up that I know many of
[17:30] you said specials andor testimonies
[17:34] and we can do any of the specials and
[17:38] any of the testimonies.
[17:40] Um just recognizing that they're going
[17:42] to be online today. Um next Sunday when
[17:46] we do communion, the service will not be
[17:48] posted. Uh communion is not a service to
[17:51] post. Footw wishing is not a service.
[17:53] Not uh you know uh we're not running a
[17:57] popularity contest where we try to uh
[18:00] you know brother Abraham Myra is
[18:02] somebody I respect greatly and uh Uganda
[18:07] and he was talking about in his church
[18:09] he said when the power of God comes down
[18:13] my cameraman know
[18:15] &gt;&gt; to leave the camera. When the power of
[18:18] God comes down, my piano player knows
[18:22] &gt;&gt; that she has to leave the piano.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; There's no position in church that is
[18:29] above God.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; And when you need to pray and when you
[18:34] need to rejoice,
[18:36] &gt;&gt; you leave your position.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; You leave your pew. You leave what? You
[18:41] know, see what I'm saying? like God is
[18:43] the boss and God is right all the time
[18:47] and and and so you know he was saying he
[18:51] said you know if if God was moving and
[18:54] there happened to be an altar call or
[18:56] service of that the cameraman's greatest
[19:00] uh attraction not in our case our
[19:03] cameras fixed on the wall is to zoom in
[19:05] on the people fixing their eternal life
[19:09] that's not God's will not for Not for
[19:12] not for this place anyway.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh when when somebody is blessed
[19:19] under the
[19:20] when somebody is drunk under the
[19:23] anointing
[19:24] &gt;&gt; or they're seeking God,
[19:26] &gt;&gt; that's not video material.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Not intentionally video material. I
[19:36] mean, if somebody gets blessed and runs
[19:37] around the aisle and they catch the back
[19:39] of their head or something, that's fine.
[19:40] It don't But you know what I mean? None
[19:42] of this zooming in stuff. That's
[19:45] &gt;&gt; we're not concerned about ratings.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; We're concerned about them actually
[19:50] communing with God.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we we're not we have all
[19:59] day cuz it's supposed I mean well some
[20:01] of us do. I have all day. Some of us
[20:04] maybe got appointments. But uh if you
[20:07] have a special or a testimony and you're
[20:10] okay with it being online, you're not
[20:12] interrupting the service. We we will
[20:15] minister the word of God um accordingly
[20:18] afterwards. But I want to read a poem
[20:20] while you're thinking on those uh new
[20:23] things and and we we do want to greet
[20:25] the many many that are online and and
[20:28] all of you that come here and have come
[20:31] here and call this their home church.
[20:33] You you have no idea
[20:37] what you mean to me in the land. You
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course you it's impossible
[20:47] for you to know what you mean to God.
[20:49] That's the most important. You will not
[20:51] comprehend that until you get to the
[20:53] other side. You can try with all your
[20:55] might and that'll be really good, but
[20:58] when you get over there, you'll have
[21:00] different things.
[21:05] I
[21:08] &gt;&gt; I believe God brings things in our life
[21:10] for a reason and different things pop up
[21:14] and there's good and bad to many things
[21:16] in the world but uh this was something
[21:19] that good that happened. This is
[21:21] somebody I know
[21:33] that
[21:38] showed a great deal of kindness to us
[21:47] in Uganda.
[21:51] But he never ever sat in a church
[21:54] service.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; He posted this
[22:09] and
[22:12] if we did this our life would be
[22:14] completely different.
[22:18] when uh
[22:34] instead of viewing others as bad,
[22:38] wrong
[22:39] or evil,
[22:41] simply view them
[22:44] as limited.
[22:47] Their level of consciousness limits them
[22:51] to the unparable behaviors
[22:54] and they simply cannot do better
[22:57] consciously
[22:59] considering their correct current level
[23:02] of understanding and awareness.
[23:07] They are not bad.
[23:09] They are simply limited.
[23:13] This small shift in perspective,
[23:18] this huge shift in our perspective
[23:25] allows you greater peace,
[23:28] greater compassion,
[23:32] greater forgiveness,
[23:35] and greater grace. Remember, the higher
[23:39] you move in consciousness,
[23:41] the less fault you find in others.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. This guy
[23:53] was the first person to show up at our
[23:56] accident in Uganda when we had our
[23:58] head-on collision. He gave us vehicle
[24:03] &gt;&gt; and a driver,
[24:05] paid driver to took us everywhere after
[24:07] it, but he never came to church.
[24:10] Every time I've went to Uganda, he's
[24:13] given me a five-star meal,
[24:16] but he never ever came to church.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe I read that again because my
[24:25] English is poor.
[24:28] My reading is far worse. Instead of
[24:31] viewing others as bad,
[24:34] wrong, or evil, simply view them as
[24:38] limited.
[24:40] Their level of consciousness limits them
[24:43] to unparable behaviors and they simply
[24:47] cannot do better considering their
[24:50] current level of understanding
[24:53] and awareness.
[24:55] They are not bad. They are simply
[24:58] limited.
[25:01] This small shift in perspective allows
[25:03] us that that huge shift in perspective
[25:07] allows us greater peace, greater
[25:10] compassion,
[25:11] forgiveness,
[25:13] and grace. Wow.
[25:17] Wow. That would change everything in our
[25:19] lives
[25:21] if I could just live that. Amen.
[25:25] Amen. That's powerful.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; That comes from where the donkeys are
[25:30] swinging in the tea factory in Uganda.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; They don't have frozen rain there this
[25:36] morning.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does anybody want to share a
[25:41] testimony or a or a special or um later
[25:47] on? We can wait on Sister Dama if you
[25:49] want or just Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Sister

[27:43] pain.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus.
[27:58] Do you think the maker and g of life
[28:05] is far too busy to care about your trles
[28:10] and
[28:13] hear
[28:15] that falls to the ground and hears
[28:20] that soundious
[28:28] Amen.

[28:34] It matters to the masterdensis
[28:45] worldy
[28:53] pain or you're really
[28:56] an answer.
[28:58] If it matters to you,

[29:07] If it's your greatest joy or your
[29:11] deepest pain or you're really
[29:18] matters to you,

[32:44] behind
[32:49] I will be
[32:53] leaving it all behind.
[33:19] Thank you.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Those were both beautiful songs.
[33:26] Thought the first one was really
[33:27] beautiful. I knew the last one was.
[33:31] Amen.
[33:33] Amen.
[33:35] So, anybody else that wants to testify
[33:38] or sing a special is more than welcome
[33:41] to. We're going to do the same thing
[33:44] next Sunday, but have communion, but it
[33:46] just won't be online.
[33:48] But for all that, Yeah. Sister DM's
[33:51] coming.
[33:54] Amen.
[34:30] You stand beside over here.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[34:43] Um, as we're closing in on the year of
[34:47] 2025,
[34:50] one thing that's been consistent is our
[34:53] solid rock,
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And through the many
[34:58] things um that we've experienced this
[35:00] year, he's shown us faithfulness
[35:03] &gt;&gt; in so many beautiful ways, in so many
[35:07] rich ways.
[35:09] and I could stand here all day
[35:11] testifying of his goodness.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; I will share some testimonies today. Um
[35:17] but first the boys and I are going to
[35:20] sing a song and then we have a scripture
[35:23] song. So
[35:25] &gt;&gt; we're going to sing He's able
[35:29] because he sure is able to carry us
[35:31] through no matter what this life has for
[35:33] us and what he has in store for us. and
[35:36] we want to just testify of his goodness.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; And so we're going to sing that
[35:41] together. Okay, Moses, you ready? You're
[35:44] not touching that. We're going to be
[35:46] singing in two. Ready?
[35:49] Three, two, one, go. He's able. He's
[35:54] able. He's more than able. He's able to
[36:01] carry me through.
[36:06] He's able. He's able. He's more than
[36:12] able. He's able to carry me through.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; He heals the broken hearted and he sets
[36:24] the captives free. He makes the lame to
[36:28] walk again and causes the blind to see.
[36:33] He's able. He's able. He's more than
[36:39] able. He's able to carry me through.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; He's able. He's able. He's more than
[36:53] able. He's able to carry me through.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[37:08] The word of the Lord endureth
[37:13] forever.
[37:14] First Peter
[37:16] 1 25.
[37:21] The word of the Lord endureth
[37:26] forever.
[37:28] First Pet
[37:50] was
[37:52] reflecting on
[37:54] the many testimonies of the Lord this
[37:56] past year,
[37:58] There's kind of three things that came
[38:01] to mind.
[38:03] So the first thing was divine provision.
[38:08] The next was divine appointments and the
[38:10] next was divine dreams.
[38:13] So I'm going to start by sharing a few
[38:16] testimonies of divine provision.
[38:19] And
[38:21] they may seem small, but
[38:25] the fact that the Lord knows our heart
[38:26] before you even speak a word
[38:29] &gt;&gt; is so beautiful to me.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Um, this past summer,
[38:35] I was looking for a bicycle for Moses,
[38:41] and I had it on my heart to also get a
[38:44] bicycle for myself, but I didn't pray
[38:46] for it. I didn't want I wasn't actively
[38:48] looking for it. It was kind of just in
[38:50] my heart that I would love to bike with
[38:52] my boys. It's something I enjoy doing. I
[38:54] know it's something they enjoy doing.
[38:56] So, it would be quite special for us to
[38:57] do that together. And so, the one day
[39:00] Jeff and I were on the road um towards
[39:02] Wallisburg and I was just looking on
[39:06] marketplace for a bike and one happened
[39:09] to pop up and it looked like the perfect
[39:12] size for Moses and it was really close
[39:13] by. So I said, "Jeff, um, are you okay
[39:16] if we just go see if that bike's there?"
[39:18] Because he put it to the road, the
[39:20] likelihood of it being there was quite
[39:22] small.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; And so we went to the address
[39:27] and when we pulled up to the post, uh,
[39:31] there were two bikes sitting
[39:33] &gt;&gt; by it.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; There was a bike that was the perfect
[39:38] size for me and there was a bike right
[39:40] beside it that was the perfect size for
[39:42] Moses. And Jeff said, "I'm going to step
[39:45] out.
[39:47] I'm going to step out and just look at
[39:49] them." And when he took a peek and he
[39:52] came back to the vehicle, he's like,
[39:53] "Damla,
[39:55] those bikes still have the tags on them.
[39:58] They have the stickers." He's like,
[40:00] "They have never been ridden."
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[40:03] So,
[40:05] &gt;&gt; by God's grace,
[40:06] &gt;&gt; like he provided two bikes for our
[40:09] family and I took a picture of it cuz
[40:12] I'm like, this is a testimony of
[40:14] &gt;&gt; like God knowing my desire
[40:17] &gt;&gt; and just
[40:19] &gt;&gt; giving it to me.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; So that I could spend time with my boys.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Another thing is recently, and I shared
[40:27] this with a few of you because I can't
[40:28] hold in what he does because it's just
[40:32] &gt;&gt; too amazing. So, I have to share it. Um,
[40:36] I realized the boys need chore coats
[40:38] because they would come in from the barn
[40:41] and the coats weren't smelling so great.
[40:44] I was like, "We need some fresh coats
[40:45] for church and birthdays and whatnot."
[40:47] So, I started looking on Marketplace
[40:51] and I found this green and black coat,
[40:54] which was perfect because the boys love
[40:57] pretending to be soldiers. Um it was a
[40:59] size five and it was $5 and it was a
[41:02] winter coat. It would keep them warm. So
[41:04] I found one for Moses and I said, "Okay,
[41:06] so we're going to be picking this jacket
[41:08] up for Moses." And right before we were
[41:12] going to go pick it up, the lady
[41:14] messaged me and she was apologizing.
[41:17] She said, "I am so sorry for this
[41:19] inconvenience, but that jacket has a rip
[41:22] in the armpit,
[41:24] so I'm going to give it to you for
[41:27] free." And she said, "I have the same
[41:30] one in a size seven that I'm going to
[41:32] give to you as well."
[41:35] &gt;&gt; So, I was looking for a coat for both
[41:37] Noah and Moses, and the Lord provided a
[41:40] coat for the both of them that are
[41:42] matching,
[41:43] &gt;&gt; and it was completely free. And I even
[41:45] offered her, you know, just what can I
[41:47] give you? She said, "Don't even worry
[41:49] about it. Merry Christmas."
[41:51] &gt;&gt; And so that was another beautiful
[41:53] blessing of God's goodness.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; And a recent one. So I've always had a
[42:04] desire and my prayer was to have
[42:06] chickens because my parents my parents
[42:09] are from Cypress. My grandparents lived
[42:12] in northern Cypress and they were
[42:14] farmers. They had goats and chickens and
[42:17] sheep and a donkey. And so I used to go
[42:21] and get the eggs for them when we
[42:23] visited uh when I was four years old. So
[42:26] we visited Cypress when I was four and
[42:27] my grandmother would ask me to go
[42:29] collect the eggs and ever since then I
[42:31] just love chickens and even though one
[42:34] tried to attack me, I still had a desire
[42:37] to have them. So, um, we we got nine
[42:40] chickens this past summer, but recently
[42:43] Jeff wanted us to find local
[42:46] cheese. So, I was driving to Petroleia
[42:50] and I saw this dairy farm and I said,
[42:53] "Oh, that would be that'd be great for
[42:55] us to stop by maybe on our way back.
[42:57] I've never been there. Um, I love goat
[43:00] cheese, so we'll check it out."
[43:02] And so I stopped in there and I was
[43:06] asking them about goats because we would
[43:08] like to buy or have a goat one day. And
[43:12] the lady said, "Hey, I don't know much
[43:14] about goats, but the farmer here does.
[43:16] His name's Anthony. I'll go get him."
[43:17] And he was just down the hall there. So
[43:20] Anthony came and I asked him a couple
[43:23] questions about goats and he's like,
[43:25] "Look, I I sold all my goats for
[43:27] February. I had 250 and I don't have any
[43:30] right now, but and so I shared with him
[43:32] that we're starting small and we have
[43:34] some chickens and we're kind of building
[43:36] our farm. And he goes, "Well, I have
[43:39] probably 16 or more chickens that I
[43:43] don't need and you're more than welcome
[43:45] to have them." And I was just bubbling
[43:49] and super excited and I was like,
[43:51] "Sure." Like, "Is there anything we can
[43:53] give you for them?" Like, he's like,
[43:54] "Nope." He's like, "I just I want them
[43:56] gone." So he's like, "I'll catch him for
[43:58] you. I'll, you know, give me a call and
[44:00] I'll let you know when I have them in
[44:02] the shed." So in a few days, I gave him
[44:05] a call. And he caught 21 roosters and
[44:09] hens and a baby chick for us, the Royal
[44:12] Rhode Island Red um chickens, and he
[44:16] helped me get them in boxes and we
[44:17] brought them home. And just seeing them
[44:20] out, you know, in the grass the other
[44:22] day was just a blessing. It's like, wow,
[44:25] Lord. Like,
[44:27] &gt;&gt; I'm walking what I prayed.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Like, you blessed me with these and I
[44:32] didn't even ask.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; You just made a way. You just showed me
[44:35] where to go, who to talk to. And
[44:38] &gt;&gt; so,
[44:39] &gt;&gt; I just praise him. He is
[44:42] &gt;&gt; so faithful. And sometimes, you know, he
[44:44] provides us our desire in a way that we
[44:47] wouldn't even have thought of. So,
[44:51] &gt;&gt; so following from there is divine
[44:54] appointments.
[44:56] So, I've always used this word,
[44:58] especially if I just happened to meet
[45:00] somebody where I wouldn't expect. And
[45:03] the first one was at the boy's dentist
[45:06] appointment. So, I know that need the
[45:09] boys needed um to go in for an
[45:11] appointment
[45:12] and Jeff's like, "Oh, you got a letter
[45:14] like from the government." And when I
[45:16] opened it up, it was free dental care
[45:20] for all of my children for the next
[45:22] year. It's nothing I ever applied for or
[45:24] anything. It just came in the mail. So,
[45:27] I made an appointment at a dental office
[45:30] that Jeff's parents go to. And when Noah
[45:34] was getting his teeth cleaned, I was
[45:35] sitting and the hygienist started to
[45:36] talk to me. And I could tell she was
[45:39] really hungry cuz she started just
[45:42] asking me a lot about my life and about
[45:44] my children and our family. And she
[45:47] started asking me about our church. And
[45:49] she asked me where it was. And I
[45:52] mentioned to her our pastor's name. And
[45:55] she just seemed really excited. And I
[45:58] was just sharing with her how much of a
[46:00] joy it is to be able to be at home and
[46:02] raise my boys and my daughter and to be
[46:04] able to homeschool them. And it was just
[46:06] a beautiful time to share my testimony.
[46:08] And she just wanted to know more and
[46:10] more.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Well, just as we were finishing up, um,
[46:13] I stepped out of the room and Noah was
[46:17] still in the room getting his coat on.
[46:20] She was on her computer already and she
[46:23] was googling our church.
[46:26] And when she was googling our church,
[46:27] you know, Pastor Dale and Sister Lann's
[46:29] picture showed up on Google. And Noah,
[46:33] being a child, was very honest. And he
[46:35] goes, "Hey, are you looking up our
[46:37] pastor? Are you looking up our church on
[46:40] your computer there?" And I was just
[46:42] there listening. And I kind of looked
[46:44] over and I didn't want her to feel like
[46:46] shy. So I went over and I said yes
[46:50] actually like that that's our church
[46:51] there and that is our pastor and his
[46:53] wife and oh yeah she was she was already
[46:56] looking to see where we were. So that
[46:59] was just a beautiful, beautiful divine
[47:02] appointment and it just shows no matter
[47:04] where you go,
[47:06] &gt;&gt; God is working
[47:07] &gt;&gt; and he, you know, he knows
[47:11] which souls are lost and need to hear,
[47:15] you know, his beautiful testimony and
[47:18] his his love, you know.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; And
[47:22] another time, so this is another
[47:24] testimony uh of Gyrus's birthday. So, we
[47:28] were in Sarnia
[47:31] and I don't usually go into Walmart.
[47:34] I had no desire to go there. Uh, we were
[47:37] just taking Gyrus out for a little drive
[47:38] for his birthday. And I just felt led to
[47:42] go in there just to get a few things for
[47:43] dinner.
[47:45] And little did I know, God was working
[47:47] on someone else who was sitting in their
[47:49] vehicle.
[47:51] She was sitting in her vehicle feeling
[47:52] really sick and she needed to come in
[47:55] and grab a few things, but she hadn't
[47:57] been into a Walmart for two years, but
[48:00] her daughter prayed for her and they
[48:02] thought, "You know what? Let's just go
[48:04] in for a few minutes and gather just the
[48:06] couple things that we need."
[48:09] So, we walked in around the same time
[48:12] and I was in the produce aisle with my
[48:14] boys and I felt a tap on my shoulder and
[48:17] I turned around and this lady was there
[48:19] with a big smile and she said, "I just
[48:21] want to tell you that you look really
[48:23] feminine."
[48:24] And I said, "Oh, thank you." Kind of
[48:26] caught me off guard a bit. I'm like, I
[48:28] really appreciate that. And she kind of
[48:30] just walked off and went back to her
[48:32] daughter.
[48:33] And we saw her again in the aisles. And
[48:35] the boys are like, "That's the lady that
[48:38] came up to you and talked to you." And I
[48:40] I was just honestly praising God as I
[48:42] went from aisle to aisle. I'm like, "See
[48:44] how just by how we are and how we dress,
[48:49] how we present ourselves, or just even
[48:51] the smile on her face can be a
[48:52] testimony." Yeah.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And when we were about to check out, she
[48:57] found me and she stopped me and she came
[49:00] up to me and she said, "I hope you know
[49:03] I didn't
[49:04] make you feel uncomfortable by coming up
[49:06] to you." And she's like, "I just really
[49:08] wanted to share that with you." And I
[49:10] said, "Honestly, I just I thank you.
[49:13] Like what you said to me really touched
[49:15] me and was really special." And I just
[49:19] felt led right there to just share my
[49:20] testimony. I said, I actually I was a
[49:22] Muslim and I came to know Christ when I
[49:24] was 28. And I said, he really worked on
[49:27] me on what modesty was um through his
[49:30] word. And it wasn't because of what
[49:32] others were wearing.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; I just, you know, like the Bible says to
[49:37] dress modest. So I went on a journey of
[49:39] finding out what that was. Said, well,
[49:42] for me, like pants weren't really modest
[49:45] because of what they show.
[49:48] But then I thought of skirts and some
[49:49] skirts aren't modest either. So he
[49:51] really led me to wear longer skirts that
[49:54] are appropriate length that are an
[49:57] appropriate sizing. And she just started
[50:00] to praise God in Walmart. She literally
[50:03] put up her hand and she said, "Thank
[50:05] you, Jesus." That this lady is so bold
[50:08] to like share her faith.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; And she she couldn't believe that I was
[50:14] so forward.
[50:16] And I'm going to share a little bit
[50:18] after as to why she was just so excited
[50:20] and because it was the Lord answering
[50:23] her prayer in a different way.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; So I shared with her too. I'm like, you
[50:27] know, this weekend we're actually
[50:28] getting ready to be around my Muslim
[50:30] family. And she's like, can I pray for
[50:32] you right now regarding that? She's
[50:34] like, I really think you need prayer for
[50:37] that and I'd love to pray for you. So,
[50:39] there we are in the Walmart by multiple
[50:41] checkouts praying to the Lord about
[50:45] another divine appointment that I'm
[50:47] going to have with my parents with a
[50:48] lady that I just met. And it was such a
[50:51] blessing. And she said, "Can we exchange
[50:54] phone numbers?" And so, I gave her my
[50:55] phone number and she called me while I
[50:58] was still standing there leaving me a
[50:59] voicemail saying, "Thank you, Jesus,
[51:01] that we met, Damla." And, you know, I'm
[51:04] so excited for us to have tea together.
[51:07] She was just Yeah. Very excited. So when
[51:12] she actually came over for tea,
[51:16] she started to get emotional at my table
[51:20] and she said, "I've been out here in
[51:23] Wyoming for 4 years." And that was
[51:24] another thing. She lives in Wyoming. She
[51:27] lives 8 minutes from our house. And her
[51:30] husband's name is Jeff,
[51:33] just like mine. And it's spelled the
[51:35] same way.
[51:37] She goes, "Jama, like
[51:40] for four years, I've been looking for a
[51:42] friend who just loves the Lord." And she
[51:45] said, "The night before I met you, I
[51:47] prayed to the Lord to find a friend who
[51:49] loves Jesus, who I can just talk to
[51:52] Jesus about." And I literally was
[51:55] feeling sick. I walked into that Walmart
[51:58] and within a few minutes of talking to
[52:00] you, you started testifying of him.
[52:06] And she's like, "I prayed. I wrote it
[52:08] down. I left it to the Lord." She said,
[52:12] "Then very next day, I met you."
[52:15] &gt;&gt; She said, "Wow, Holy Spirit, that was
[52:17] fast."
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; And on our way home Christmas day, she
[52:25] messaged me and said, "Can I come bless
[52:27] you? I want to come to your house and
[52:28] bless you. I just have something to drop
[52:30] off." We were on our way from Walmart.
[52:33] Um, and the boys wanted a turkey and I
[52:36] said, "I didn't buy a turkey. Daddy and
[52:39] mommy are not a huge fan. I just bought
[52:40] chicken."
[52:42] So, we showed up at the house and
[52:45] literally within half an hour, she came
[52:47] to my door.
[52:50] She had a bag and a huge box.
[52:53] She said, "This is from Jesus. It's not
[52:56] for me." She's like, "He put it on my
[52:58] heart to bring this to you today."
[53:02] And in the blue bag was a frozen turkey.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; And in the other box, she filled out
[53:08] just box full of goodies, cheeses and
[53:12] olives and whatnot and oranges. And she
[53:14] just left it at her door and she said,
[53:17] "We'd love for you to come over New
[53:18] Year's Eve and I'd love to have you over
[53:20] for tea next week."
[53:23] &gt;&gt; This is after one time of fellowshipping
[53:25] with her.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; And she's already been such a blessing
[53:28] in our life. And I thank God for his
[53:30] divine appointments.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And I have one more thing to share
[53:38] &gt;&gt; regarding
[53:40] divine dreams.
[53:42] So this sister that I met at Walmart,
[53:47] she said to me,
[53:50] "You know, my husband and I pray even
[53:52] before we go to any birthday party.
[53:55] It's just something we do. We pray about
[53:57] everything. And it really convicted me
[53:59] in that moment. I said a lot of times I
[54:01] don't pray. Like if there's a birthday
[54:02] party, I just, oh, it's a family member.
[54:04] I'm going like it's just kind of
[54:06] something you decide sometimes without
[54:08] thinking to ask God like, "Do you want
[54:11] me there?"
[54:13] &gt;&gt; So she said the one time they were
[54:14] driving to a birthday party at a church
[54:17] and she goes to Jeff and she goes, "Did
[54:19] we pray about going?" And he goes, "I
[54:22] don't think we did." And she said
[54:24] instead of stopping on that bridge and
[54:26] praying, they just continued on. And
[54:29] when they arrived at the church, she
[54:31] said they had a big van
[54:34] that had um a magic,
[54:37] it was basically a a magic show van.
[54:41] They were going to do magic at the
[54:42] church for this birthday.
[54:45] And
[54:46] they know what the Bible says about
[54:48] that. And once they saw that van of the
[54:51] magic at the church, they just turned
[54:53] around and left.
[54:56] And it just showed them the importance
[54:57] of praying before going somewhere. And
[54:59] so my sister's nephew's birthday was
[55:02] coming up and she's my only sister, he's
[55:05] my only nephew on my side of the family.
[55:08] And so
[55:11] I thought to pray about it. And a sister
[55:13] in this church as well does the same.
[55:16] You know, she prays before even visiting
[55:18] somebody. And so I said, "Okay, Lord,
[55:20] I'm going to pray about this. I'm going
[55:21] to give it to you." So the night before,
[55:24] the Lord gave me a dream
[55:27] of being there. It was very clear. But
[55:30] in my dream, I was 30 minutes late,
[55:32] exactly half an hour late to the
[55:34] birthday.
[55:36] So we're at church and I know we're
[55:39] going to leave in good time to make it
[55:40] there early.
[55:42] The party was starting at 3:00
[55:48] and I had to follow Jeff home because we
[55:50] had two vehicles. One was kind of acting
[55:52] up. So I followed him home. I only had
[55:54] Kazaya and on my way on London line
[55:57] there, the screen went completely black
[56:02] uh where the radio is and then my
[56:04] speedometer dropped and came back up.
[56:08] It's like, okay, that was odd. I've
[56:10] never had it do that. It's been having
[56:12] voltage issues, but I've never had it do
[56:14] that. So, when I got home, I told Jeff
[56:17] um he didn't seem too concerned at the
[56:18] time. He's like, "We're just going to
[56:20] we'll go in. We'll take the journey
[56:22] there, and I'll just kind of see what
[56:23] it's doing." So, my GPS said we'd be
[56:27] there 10 minutes early to the party. And
[56:31] on our way to Strathroy,
[56:33] the journey did it again. It went
[56:35] completely dark on the screen.
[56:37] Speedometer kicked down. And then it
[56:39] kept doing that repeatedly and Jeff was
[56:41] like, "Damla,
[56:43] we're not going to be able to take this
[56:45] all the way there." It's like,
[56:46] "Something is wrong."
[56:49] And I'm kind of smiling because I'm
[56:52] like, "Wow, Lord."
[56:54] Like, you showed this to me in my dream
[56:57] that we would be late. And I I had no
[56:59] idea why. Like I I thought maybe it was
[57:01] just my brain conjuring up something
[57:04] that wasn't going to happen. But so we
[57:06] had to turn around. We went back home.
[57:09] We had to take all the car seats and put
[57:11] them in the other van.
[57:14] And Jeff was just getting everything
[57:16] ready. So when he came into the van for
[57:18] us to drive there,
[57:21] he gets in the van and he goes, "Oh, I
[57:25] was going to screw the plate on to the
[57:27] back of the van." And I didn't do that,
[57:28] but I know we're late so we can get
[57:30] going. And I look at my phone and it
[57:33] says we're going to get there at 3:27.
[57:37] party was supposed to start at 3:00. My
[57:39] dream said we're a half an hour late.
[57:40] And so I go to Jeff and I go, "You have
[57:43] 3 minutes."
[57:46] So he gets out of the van, he goes and
[57:49] screws the plate on, and as he came back
[57:52] and he sat down and he looks over to my
[57:54] phone and goes, "What time is it now?"
[57:56] The arrival time switches to 3:30.
[58:00] So, we got to the party exactly 30
[58:02] minutes late,
[58:04] exactly how the Lord showed me in my
[58:06] dream. And honestly, it was his will
[58:08] because when we arrived there, there's
[58:11] probably 30 plus unsafe souls of my
[58:14] family and my sister's friends.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And when we arrived, it was like it just
[58:18] kind of went quiet and everyone kind of
[58:20] looked over and then everyone was really
[58:23] excited and one by one, they came to
[58:25] greet us. But what touched me the most
[58:27] was my cousin's daughter. So my cousin
[58:30] had her husband leave her
[58:33] um for another woman and she's been
[58:35] raising her two daughters by herself.
[58:37] And so those two daughters have grown up
[58:40] without a father figure. And the one my
[58:44] cousin's daughter um she's now in her
[58:47] 20s
[58:48] and she was one of the first people to
[58:50] come and greet me. And I smiled at her
[58:53] and Kaziah smiled at her and then I just
[58:56] gave her a hug and she started weeping
[58:59] and sobbing uncontrollably.
[59:02] She's like, "I have no idea why I'm
[59:05] crying right now."
[59:07] She just didn't understand it. And like
[59:09] in my heart in that moment, I felt the
[59:10] Lord say it's because she's getting a
[59:14] hug from her heavenly father, from her
[59:16] true father.
[59:18] you know, she's been absent of her real
[59:20] father, but here I am just truly loving
[59:23] her unconditionally through God's love
[59:26] and just praying and believing for the
[59:29] salvation of her soul and for every
[59:31] person there. And within that half hour
[59:33] and a half that we were there, the Lord
[59:35] truly used me and had me go from person
[59:38] to person just
[59:39] &gt;&gt; sharing what I could in those moments.
[59:42] Um, but that that time there with my
[59:44] sister really brought us closer
[59:45] together. So, I just want to praise his
[59:48] name. There's so much more I can share,
[59:51] but um I want to thank you for listening
[59:55] and just here today. I just wanted to
[59:58] give him glory in all things. So, praise
[1:00:01] the Lord. Thank you.
[1:00:22] Uh I don't think any of us fell asleep.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was very very beautiful. And
[1:00:31] you know if uh
[1:00:36] you would have a hard time telling
[1:00:38] Sister Damla that God wasn't real.
[1:00:44] And you know, God's been dealing with me
[1:00:46] on this standpoint is
[1:00:49] the reason God's dealing with sister
[1:00:52] Damla or different ones of you
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; is or not
[1:00:59] is based on is your angel comfortable
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and if you're living or participating or
[1:01:08] allowing in your
[1:01:11] you're under your umbrella. Something
[1:01:15] that the angel
[1:01:18] is not comfortable with, you'll never
[1:01:21] have a testimony like sister don.
[1:01:24] It just won't happen because the prophet
[1:01:27] said this.
[1:01:28] He said, um,
[1:01:33] if you start acting different than the
[1:01:36] angel,
[1:01:39] he said, it'll leave.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Don't mean you're don't mean you're not
[1:01:44] you're backsliding.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; But you won't have that kind of
[1:01:48] experience.
[1:01:50] So, you know, we know this that, you
[1:01:53] know, Christians, real Christians can't
[1:01:56] backslide.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible gives so many
[1:02:00] because because God don't save you to
[1:02:02] lose you.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; See, God God's not a bad businessman.
[1:02:06] When he buys something, he really buys
[1:02:09] it well.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And so, but we become cold or
[1:02:13] indifferent
[1:02:15] and he steps aside until we come back to
[1:02:18] him. So, Brother Bram said things like
[1:02:21] this. He said, "When you if your nature
[1:02:23] starts woing or barking or or fussing or
[1:02:26] that, he said the dove will he said if
[1:02:28] you went in a place that the Holy Spirit
[1:02:31] wasn't welcome, the dove would wait at
[1:02:32] the door
[1:02:35] until you come back."
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; We listened to I I listened to all of
[1:02:40] it. Lynn went for a walk, but I listened
[1:02:43] to a message Steve Brzant preached on
[1:02:45] mind control
[1:02:47] and it it was a very old message, but
[1:02:50] wow.
[1:02:52] You know, we I I would challenge all of
[1:02:54] you to really
[1:02:56] uh if you want a a life that's filled
[1:02:59] with things that God does every day,
[1:03:03] you have to watch how Satan will fight
[1:03:06] that. And he is so smooth.
[1:03:10] So
[1:03:12] he's
[1:03:13] Satan is almost
[1:03:18] the Bible says unrecognizable.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; sir. He says it would deceive the very
[1:03:26] elected
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; if your name wasn't if it was possible.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; So Satan Well, that's probably okay.
[1:03:39] If it's only probably, it probably
[1:03:41] isn't.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I tell you, I've done things
[1:03:46] wrong my whole life that Satan's showing
[1:03:49] me that, you know,
[1:03:52] maybe,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; you know, we we hear, you know, the
[1:03:57] whole world we live in is propaganda
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; and and and and it it just is. Nothing
[1:04:04] is the same. and and it's just so
[1:04:08] I I I tell you just wow it's a beautiful
[1:04:12] testimony sister you were very short
[1:04:15] couldn't believe it you can tell that
[1:04:17] testimony anytime you know anything that
[1:04:21] gives glory to God
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; that's why we come together
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; man the girls sing is special it's
[1:04:29] because it gives glory to God
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; man it's not about anybody it's Oh, it
[1:04:34] was glory. Sister DMA's testimony was
[1:04:38] supernatural.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Everything she shared, she could not
[1:04:42] have planned.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; That's not possible.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] Wow.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh,
[1:05:06] wow.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; God's good. Amen. This kind of our New
[1:05:09] Year's Eve service for those that are
[1:05:11] online, but we'll we'll do it next week.
[1:05:14] We'll do it offline next week. And
[1:05:18] so, any of you that are online, if you
[1:05:20] didn't hear Sister Dma's testimony real
[1:05:22] well or the girl special, we'll just
[1:05:25] rebook that in next week. Amen. But we
[1:05:28] will certainly do communion also. Just
[1:05:31] God is God is the same yesterday, today
[1:05:34] and forever
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; if you will allow him to be.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He He is already, but he will be to you
[1:05:42] if you will allow him. And how you will
[1:05:45] allow him is is his angel welcome
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; or comfortable? Better yet, comfortable.
[1:05:51] I would say he's welcome, but is he
[1:05:53] comfortable?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You know, hospitality is a gift. Yes,
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; people can come to their place
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; and not be welcome.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Not everybody's got that.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; But is he comfortable?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Comfortable.
[1:06:15] Wow.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we love those that are are not
[1:06:22] able to be with us today greatly.
[1:06:25] There's many out. Brother Bernard and
[1:06:27] Sister Ruth are out and their family and
[1:06:30] brother Matt and Abigail and they
[1:06:32] Satan's been they first they were sick
[1:06:34] and then it snowed 2 feet and now it's
[1:06:36] icy 2 ft of ice they probably got up
[1:06:39] there. It's can you imagine it was minus
[1:06:42] two there pouring rain. I imagine they
[1:06:43] got and uh sister Margaret and brother
[1:06:49] Lu
[1:06:51] and London we love you all. and brother
[1:06:53] Jim and Chadam and sister Joanie and
[1:06:56] Betroya just different ones just greatly
[1:07:00] greatly appreciate you all. Let's uh
[1:07:02] maybe we'll stand and read a verse in 2
[1:07:05] Kings 7 3
[1:07:09] and I'll just uh I'll just preach a
[1:07:11] short message if that's all right. I
[1:07:15] mean if God will let me do message.
[1:07:19] Sometimes it's hard to stop.
[1:07:22] But I'll I'll preach maybe part of this
[1:07:24] and it's just a message, but maybe I'll
[1:07:27] do part today and maybe do part when we
[1:07:30] have communion or something. But
[1:07:34] Amen.
[1:07:37] Second 2 Kings 7
[1:07:40] three.
[1:07:46] Amen. And there was four lepous men
[1:07:50] at the entering of the gate. And they
[1:07:53] said one to another,
[1:07:56] "Why sit here? We
[1:08:00] Why sit we here
[1:08:03] until
[1:08:05] we die?"
[1:08:07] Lord God, we just pray that you will
[1:08:09] bless your people, Lord. And Lord, you
[1:08:12] understand the weather here. We live in
[1:08:14] Canada. this winter time. And Lord, I
[1:08:17] pray a a double blessing on the ones
[1:08:19] that would have been here if they could
[1:08:21] have been. And Lord, the ones that
[1:08:24] choose to not be here that Lord, we pray
[1:08:27] for them. And Lord, I pray that you
[1:08:29] would just send divine love,
[1:08:32] divine love to them and and show them
[1:08:35] that we make lots of mistakes,
[1:08:38] but you are perfect. You are Jehovah
[1:08:40] Gyra, and we love you, Lord God. and be
[1:08:43] with the ones that are here and may you
[1:08:45] just be with the ministering of the word
[1:08:47] we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You
[1:08:53] may have your seats this morning.
[1:08:57] I want to minister on something uh uh
[1:09:01] just very unique in that. But you know
[1:09:04] in our walk with God,
[1:09:07] every one of us it's an individual walk.
[1:09:10] Our our walk is individual. But we must
[1:09:13] overcome our own individual fear
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; and and that's a daily occurrence
[1:09:22] because uh everything we do as a risk
[1:09:26] and I know I preached this not uh maybe
[1:09:29] I did preach on fear not that long ago
[1:09:31] but I want to show you different
[1:09:32] examples through the Bible how people
[1:09:35] overcame their fear. So we see here in 2
[1:09:39] Kings in the in the previous chapter
[1:09:41] here that the city was under a siege and
[1:09:44] it was under a great famine the city of
[1:09:47] Samaria. You know you'll see that in in
[1:09:50] chapter 6 and verse 24. And it came to
[1:09:53] pass that after this that uh uh the the
[1:09:57] king of Syria had gathered all the hosts
[1:09:59] and went up and besieged Samaria and
[1:10:02] there was a great famine in the city.
[1:10:05] And the famine was so great. It's so
[1:10:09] unbelievable. Well, well, here it said
[1:10:10] that behold that they besieged it until
[1:10:14] till a donkey's head was sold for four
[1:10:17] score pieces of silver. Sounded like our
[1:10:21] inflation today. And and four parts of a
[1:10:25] clove of a dove was dragged for five
[1:10:28] pieces of silver. And if you read all
[1:10:31] these scriptures in here, you'll see
[1:10:33] where the the king of the city actually
[1:10:36] came beside himself because people were
[1:10:39] eating their own flesh. They the people
[1:10:43] were beside themselves. And so this
[1:10:46] major army, you'd have to picture this
[1:10:47] in the old times, it was a walled city.
[1:10:50] and the the wall cities in in a in a
[1:10:53] poor designed city. Uh if an army came
[1:10:56] and seized that city for a long period
[1:10:58] of time, they would eventually if they
[1:11:00] had no when the food run out, it run
[1:11:02] out. But worse than even the food was
[1:11:04] the water.
[1:11:06] And so if there wasn't a natural spring
[1:11:08] or wells or or a river that went through
[1:11:11] that water, what you could be in those
[1:11:13] four walls and you would be safe
[1:11:16] overnight or you'd be safe for a week or
[1:11:19] you'd be safe for a month.
[1:11:23] But if you were seized, you would never
[1:11:26] be safe forever. And you know many of us
[1:11:28] do things in our life that that we can
[1:11:31] be safe for a day or we can be safe for
[1:11:34] a week or we can be safe for a month. We
[1:11:37] can even be safe for most of your life.
[1:11:40] But at some point you will see that the
[1:11:43] siege will come in and you will start to
[1:11:46] die. You will either die of regret or or
[1:11:49] different things that you've done. You
[1:11:51] know if you do you know the Bible says
[1:11:53] hold not the sins of my youth to my
[1:11:55] charge. But you know those sins, God can
[1:11:58] wash them away perfectly clean, 100%
[1:12:02] clean,
[1:12:03] but he can never take away the regret
[1:12:05] that you'll have for committing them.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Most all of us that are older in our
[1:12:11] life would have things that we would
[1:12:14] change completely
[1:12:16] if God gave us the power for it. Now, we
[1:12:18] know that he permitted it. But we see
[1:12:20] here these four lepers were sitting
[1:12:22] outside the city gate. And the city had
[1:12:25] been seized. These people were only put
[1:12:27] outside the city because they had
[1:12:29] leprosy. But the people inside the city
[1:12:31] were starving to death. They were
[1:12:33] thirsting to death, eating their own
[1:12:35] flesh.
[1:12:36] And the lepers
[1:12:39] got what was left over
[1:12:42] which was nothing.
[1:12:45] And many of the times if you will just
[1:12:46] step out in Christ, you know, when when
[1:12:49] Joshua crossed the the the river, the
[1:12:52] water never stopped flowing until they
[1:12:54] stepped into the water.
[1:12:56] But you have to be willing to take a
[1:12:58] risk. You have to be willing to trust
[1:13:01] God. You have to be willing to to
[1:13:03] believe the scriptures that the
[1:13:04] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:13:06] of the Lord.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; And you're never going to confine that
[1:13:12] in your own ability. and and how you're
[1:13:15] going to fight the the black dog and the
[1:13:18] white dog that's inside of you and and
[1:13:20] how are you going to convince the black
[1:13:22] dog that God's got everything under
[1:13:25] control?
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:29] But these lepers came to a spot. They
[1:13:31] said
[1:13:33] that every one of us have to come.
[1:13:36] They said we're going to die.
[1:13:41] We're going to die.
[1:13:43] And we're going to die if we sit right
[1:13:45] here.
[1:13:47] And we're going to die if we get up and
[1:13:49] try. And you know, in our spiritual
[1:13:52] walk, God will never penalize somebody
[1:13:55] for trying. A a a general in an army
[1:13:59] will never penalize a soldier for
[1:14:00] falling down. He'll penalize them for
[1:14:02] not trying to get out. And it and as
[1:14:05] parents and that when our kids make
[1:14:07] mistakes, if they're trying,
[1:14:10] Amen. If they get up again, I I
[1:14:12] shouldn't have done that, but I was dead
[1:14:14] wrong. But I recognize my mistake. You
[1:14:17] know, Brother Brham said this in
[1:14:18] studying for communion. He said, you
[1:14:20] know, uh he said, you have to be trying
[1:14:23] your best to serve God. What makes you
[1:14:26] worthy for communion is your your
[1:14:28] heart's desire is to be perfect. you
[1:14:31] what makes you not what makes you worthy
[1:14:34] for communion is not perfection because
[1:14:37] we're still here.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So none of us are perfect.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's great.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; But what makes you worthy of communion
[1:14:43] is that you desire to be perfect.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you're if you don't desire
[1:14:48] and you're a hypocrite and you're
[1:14:50] willfully living a double life, if
[1:14:52] you're willfully living in the world a
[1:14:55] double standard, then you become a
[1:14:57] stumbling block for the world and you
[1:14:59] become a hypocrite and God will charge
[1:15:01] you for it and he actually will put you
[1:15:03] to sleep. The Bible says that in
[1:15:06] communion that if you take communion
[1:15:07] unworthily that you would be that many
[1:15:12] sleep because they take it unworthily
[1:15:14] and that being interpreted is death.
[1:15:17] So God don't God don't like hypocrites.
[1:15:21] God loves people that are trying.
[1:15:26] And so here these lepers they came to
[1:15:28] desperation which it takes most of us to
[1:15:31] to make a major change in our life. we
[1:15:33] come to desperation
[1:15:36] and and I you know if I wish Steve would
[1:15:39] come and preach that message first but
[1:15:40] if he doesn't I might steal some of his
[1:15:44] notes and try to but I I want to shock
[1:15:46] you with something that you don't
[1:15:48] realize but everything you believe in
[1:15:50] your life on earth in flesh is a lie
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; you might as well believe that because I
[1:16:00] could prove that upside to Everything
[1:16:04] everything is controlled by Satan. The
[1:16:07] Bible says this is Satan's Eden. So he's
[1:16:09] the boss of everything.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; So everything you believe is a lie. And
[1:16:14] he's working through Rome and different
[1:16:16] secret societies. And you know most of
[1:16:19] the people that we would would would
[1:16:21] admire or the companies we would admire
[1:16:24] are owned by Satan. And you can see and
[1:16:27] I I'm I'm robbing some of Steve's notes,
[1:16:29] but he would see any of these people
[1:16:31] that do different things, they would
[1:16:32] show you signs that now I want to show
[1:16:35] you something and he mentioned this.
[1:16:37] Forgive me, brother Steve. Uh if you're
[1:16:39] talking to him, Julie, you can. But he
[1:16:41] said, you know, watch. He said, you
[1:16:42] know, on my business card or sorry, I
[1:16:45] mean our church business card, we and
[1:16:48] even on our pulpit, we have a cross.
[1:16:52] That's fairly standard.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I would say the most heathen pagan
[1:16:58] person,
[1:16:59] no matter what religion you are, you
[1:17:01] would recognize the cross,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; But almost nobody would recognize what's
[1:17:14] around that cross.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; But you do.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:17:23] because you're a member.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the same thing in Satan's
[1:17:29] kingdom.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; You can look at every professional
[1:17:32] sports has the sun god worship, the
[1:17:36] pyramid worship, the Lucifer worship
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; as in every symbol in society. Every big
[1:17:45] business
[1:17:47] has it. Listen, they spend trillions of
[1:17:50] dollars to make their symbol logo and
[1:17:53] those big companies and they'll hide an
[1:17:55] upside down cross, which is fall of
[1:17:57] Christianity. Can you imagine a
[1:17:59] Christian ever wearing an upside down
[1:18:01] cross? I've seen it.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; After I took straight oxygen,
[1:18:07] I tried to recover.
[1:18:10] You know, the Bible says that and and
[1:18:12] and I would preach that is, you know,
[1:18:14] God's people fail for lack of knowledge.
[1:18:16] There's things that you not you can't
[1:18:18] participate in.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I mean, you you don't have to believe
[1:18:25] that, but I'll guarantee you this.
[1:18:28] Your angel ain't going in with you.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; I'll guarantee you that God believes it.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I used it before as an example just as
[1:18:43] Starbucks. Starbucks is all about the
[1:18:47] goddess of sex
[1:18:49] straight from hell pagan. And even their
[1:18:53] CEO says we do not want any not not
[1:18:57] Christians. He didn't say Christian. He
[1:18:59] said we don't have any even normal
[1:19:00] people
[1:19:02] money.
[1:19:04] Who would say you wouldn't want other
[1:19:06] people's money?
[1:19:09] They say we don't want anybody's normal
[1:19:11] people's money. We only want gay and
[1:19:13] lesbians people's money.
[1:19:16] Why did they say that?
[1:19:19] Because they're a member of a society
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; that's called Lucifer.
[1:19:25] And so just like you recognize the cross
[1:19:29] and less would recognize what's around
[1:19:31] the cross.
[1:19:34] Or if I had an eagle up here catching a
[1:19:38] two-edged sword, which was a sword of
[1:19:40] the word of God, which was sharper than
[1:19:42] a two-edged sword to decipher even to
[1:19:45] the marrow of the bone, the word of God.
[1:19:49] You would recognize that.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; The world wouldn't.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; My family wouldn't recognize it. Why?
[1:19:55] Because it's a different
[1:19:58] kingdom. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And those people recognize their
[1:20:03] kingdom.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know where that came from.
[1:20:08] That's not my fear. But you, you know,
[1:20:10] we come to a desperation
[1:20:13] that it takes a radical decision to
[1:20:16] make.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you I'm going to
[1:20:19] show you maybe two examples and then I'm
[1:20:22] going to shut up
[1:20:24] where you'll compromise
[1:20:26] yourself silly.
[1:20:29] Everybody does. You don't have to tell
[1:20:31] me you're compromising. If you're
[1:20:33] breathing, you're compromising.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I have five or six examples here, but
[1:20:40] let me just tell you here. So, let's
[1:20:42] just go to verse four. And he says, "If
[1:20:43] we say we'll enter the city, then the
[1:20:45] famine in the city is we shall die
[1:20:48] there." So, we could go in the gate. The
[1:20:51] people wouldn't let us in the gate
[1:20:52] because we got leprosy. But if we were
[1:20:54] able to get inside the gate of the city,
[1:20:55] we would die there. And if we sit here,
[1:20:59] we're going to die here. We die also. So
[1:21:02] now therefore, let's come and let us
[1:21:05] fall into the host of the army that's
[1:21:08] around the Syrians,
[1:21:10] around the city. And if they shall save
[1:21:13] us alive, we shall live. And if they
[1:21:16] kill us, well, we were going to die
[1:21:19] anyway.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Do you see how they're they're judging
[1:21:23] in their mind? Is this a good decision?
[1:21:26] Yeah.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; And they came to the spot they said,
[1:21:30] "We're going to die."
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; So, we might as well die moving.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Because if IT TURNS OUT REALLY bad in
[1:21:38] our decision, we're going to die anyway.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; But see, God loves movers.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something this morning.
[1:21:51] God loves Sister Da's testimony.
[1:21:54] He loves movers and shakers.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Watch what he did here. Verse 5. And
[1:22:00] they rose up in the twilight to go unto
[1:22:03] the cap cap the the the camp of the the
[1:22:06] army that was around the city. And when
[1:22:08] they were come to the uppermost part of
[1:22:10] the camp, behold, there was no one
[1:22:13] there. Now wait a minute. The city was
[1:22:18] eating their children. The Bible says
[1:22:21] that.
[1:22:23] The Bible says that when people in the
[1:22:25] city started auctioning, they said,
[1:22:26] "We'll eat your son today. Wait the
[1:22:29] other tomorrow." And the king the king
[1:22:31] heard that and the king went like
[1:22:33] cuckoo. That's in this scripture.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; He started losing his mind.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; But because they decided to to take a
[1:22:46] risk, watch this, a risk
[1:22:50] for the Lord.
[1:22:53] They weren't popular. They were lepers.
[1:22:57] See, God don't care how popular you are,
[1:22:59] how big you are, how little you are. He
[1:23:01] wants you to take a risk. You know what
[1:23:03] that's called? Faith. You know what the
[1:23:05] Bible says? It is impossible
[1:23:08] without faith to please God.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; It is impossible for you to step out and
[1:23:16] serve God and please him without taking
[1:23:19] a risk. And watch what God did. As soon
[1:23:22] as he seen them, you you don't think God
[1:23:24] seen them wondering in their mind, well,
[1:23:26] we're going to die here. If we go in the
[1:23:27] city, we're going to die. So, let's just
[1:23:29] go out and attack the enemy. This was
[1:23:32] the enemy, by the way.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; It's like Walmart. We're going to go to
[1:23:36] Walmart. We haven't been there for 2
[1:23:38] years, but we're going to go to the
[1:23:38] enemy's camp.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] Watch this. Watch what the Lord did. For
[1:23:45] the Lord had made the host of the
[1:23:47] Syrians, the enemy,
[1:23:50] to hear the noise of chariots. NOW, I
[1:23:53] WANT TO JUST clarify something. THERE
[1:23:56] WAS FOUR LEOPARDS going there on
[1:23:58] barefoot,
[1:24:03] but because they decided to take a risk,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; they decided to stick their neck out.
[1:24:14] The Lord made the host of the army of
[1:24:16] Now, this was a big enough army to
[1:24:18] besiege the city until starvation
[1:24:24] to make them hear loud noises of
[1:24:26] chariots. This is verse six. NOISES OF
[1:24:29] HORSES. They never had any horses. And
[1:24:32] noises
[1:24:33] of a great host. Four people.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; You're a mighty army this morning.
[1:24:42] Because there's more than four people
[1:24:43] here.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Why did God do that? Let me ask you a
[1:24:50] question. Would God have done that if
[1:24:52] they would have stayed where they were?
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; They took a risk.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; And that risk
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; was faith.
[1:25:07] And they said one to another, "Lo, the
[1:25:10] king of the Israel has hired against us
[1:25:12] the king of the Hittites." And the king
[1:25:15] So the here the people that had camped
[1:25:17] the city had thought the city had called
[1:25:19] on Google on their cell phones and they
[1:25:22] called all the other uh you know uh well
[1:25:25] I could make it modern, but uh
[1:25:28] it's okay. We'll make it modern. I don't
[1:25:30] mind jail. They have free food. You
[1:25:32] know, you know, the states had lots of
[1:25:34] gall to put on when they were seizing
[1:25:37] the oil tankers of Venezuela.
[1:25:42] But when Venezuela left this here Friday
[1:25:45] with three oil tankers and their own
[1:25:47] military guarding them, the states never
[1:25:50] put that on YouTube
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; cuz it was egg in their face.
[1:25:56] BECAUSE CHINA and Russia said, "If you
[1:25:59] keep touching our oil,
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; you're gonna have problems."
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; see how propaganda is so false? Yeah.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; And so here they thought that here here
[1:26:15] the the king this the the army that's
[1:26:18] around the city the Samaritans
[1:26:22] when they heard all this noise they said
[1:26:23] well the people in the city
[1:26:26] has hired an army to come in and attack
[1:26:28] us
[1:26:31] and they flee for their life.
[1:26:34] It hired the Gizzites.
[1:26:42] My bed was
[1:26:45] and all these people to come against us.
[1:26:48] And so verse 7, and therefore they arose
[1:26:50] and fled the twilight, and they left
[1:26:52] their tents. Now, now God did every bit
[1:26:55] of this. See, they never had cell phone
[1:26:57] signal there. Like the internet service
[1:27:00] was terrible.
[1:27:02] And they hadn't sent a man running out
[1:27:04] to tell them to hire the army. That city
[1:27:07] couldn't have hired anybody. They were
[1:27:08] worried about living.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And the army at twilight, they left
[1:27:15] their tents and their horses and their
[1:27:18] asses and even the camp as it was and
[1:27:20] they fled FOR THEIR LIFE. WHY did the
[1:27:23] enemy fled for their life? I I want to
[1:27:26] just drive this home. Why did the army
[1:27:29] fled for its life after it had been
[1:27:31] encamped and entrenched and dug in for
[1:27:34] years?
[1:27:35] Yeah. Years, not days, not weeks, and
[1:27:40] not months.
[1:27:42] That city would have been able to
[1:27:44] withstand a famine for a long time. You
[1:27:48] know, they close the grocery stores
[1:27:50] around our town. Our basement will be
[1:27:53] able to withstand a famine for probably
[1:27:55] about a year and a half.
[1:27:57] or two
[1:28:01] because we have a stockpile of food.
[1:28:04] What city don't have food on the shelf
[1:28:05] of the grocery store? But after a year
[1:28:08] or two, the shelves start emptying out
[1:28:10] because they're not getting replenished.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And in verse eight, this is what God
[1:28:20] did. They fled for their lives. The army
[1:28:23] fled. And verse 8, "And when these
[1:28:26] leopards came to the outermost part of
[1:28:30] the enemy's camp,
[1:28:33] they went into one tent, and they did
[1:28:35] eat and drink, and carried hence the
[1:28:39] silver and the gold, and the raignment,
[1:28:43] and they went and hid it, cuz they were
[1:28:45] stockpiled."
[1:28:47] And they came again and they entered
[1:28:49] into another tent and carried hence
[1:28:52] also.
[1:28:53] And when it hit it,
[1:28:57] why did they get the food and the drink
[1:29:00] and the gold and the silver?
[1:29:05] Because they never made a decision. They
[1:29:06] stayed right where they were. They were
[1:29:08] just going to die.
[1:29:09] No,
[1:29:11] it was because they took a risk to say,
[1:29:15] I believe God is in control. I believe
[1:29:19] God is going to take care of me
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to sit here. You know
[1:29:24] what? As a believer, I'm not going down
[1:29:29] just sitting in my chair, you know, all
[1:29:33] defeated.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] And verse nine, let's just read this.
[1:29:41] And then they said one to another, we do
[1:29:43] well this day, and this is good tidings.
[1:29:46] Behold the peace God had blessed them in
[1:29:48] the morning. And and and we should carry
[1:29:51] this to the king's household. And let's
[1:29:54] just jump to 14. I want to show you. So
[1:29:57] actually, you can post up 14. And here
[1:29:59] they they went back to the king. They
[1:30:02] went back to the city that was dying,
[1:30:05] that had no faith.
[1:30:07] They went back to the king. If you read
[1:30:09] this in the scripture, I'm just
[1:30:11] paraphrasing it. They went back to the
[1:30:13] king that they were eating their own
[1:30:15] flesh.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And the king said, "It's a trick. God's
[1:30:19] tricking us."
[1:30:21] That's what they said. Now, there might
[1:30:24] be other verses, but you can read this
[1:30:26] if you're home and that you read these
[1:30:27] vers. They said, "IT'S A TRICK. THEY'VE
[1:30:29] TRICKED US, and they're going to wait
[1:30:31] till we go out and do something for God,
[1:30:33] and then they're going to capture us.
[1:30:37] Now they were going to die every way.
[1:30:39] The wa watch this. Watch this. The the
[1:30:42] king the king had their leader had zero
[1:30:46] faith.
[1:30:50] And it was and and I'm just reading
[1:30:53] between this, but it was the people that
[1:30:56] that talked with the king of the city
[1:31:00] and said, "Well, let's just send out one
[1:31:02] horse
[1:31:04] and a couple people."
[1:31:07] And if we know God couldn't have done
[1:31:09] it, but it will be a great loss if we
[1:31:12] just lose them.
[1:31:14] BUT PER CHANCE, GOD'S STILL THE SAME.
[1:31:18] JUST PER CHANCE. I I KNOW WE PRAYED, but
[1:31:22] we don't believe. Like when Peter came
[1:31:24] to the door and they said, "It's a
[1:31:26] ghost." We prayed for Peter to come out
[1:31:28] of jail, but he's knocking at the door
[1:31:30] and and you know, they go to answer the
[1:31:32] door and they said, "Well, it can't be
[1:31:33] Peter cuz we know he's in jail." Even
[1:31:35] though we're praying, he gets free. So,
[1:31:36] it's his ghost.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; SEE HOW PEOPLE ALWAYS GOT an answer?
[1:31:46] And so the king sent it
[1:31:49] and he seen it and he realized that it
[1:31:52] was real. And see here the prophet had
[1:31:55] prophesied that God was going to change
[1:31:58] the scene. And the people in the city
[1:32:01] and the king and the and the keeper of
[1:32:03] the gate had marked the prophet and
[1:32:06] marked the prophet. The prophet had come
[1:32:07] up and said, you know, in the beginning
[1:32:09] of this chapter, he said, you know, the
[1:32:11] price of food is going to be worthless
[1:32:14] cuz it's going to drop.
[1:32:17] And the guy at the gate said,
[1:32:20] I'll believe that when I see it. He
[1:32:22] said, you'll see it, but you'll never
[1:32:24] taste of the food.
[1:32:26] And he died when they stampede the city,
[1:32:30] leaving the gates.
[1:32:37] because he mocked God. Verse 16. And the
[1:32:40] people went out and they spoiled the
[1:32:41] tents of the Syrians. And so the measure
[1:32:44] of fine flour was sold for a shackle and
[1:32:46] two measures of barley for a shackle
[1:32:49] according according to the word of the
[1:32:52] Lord. Now if you continue, the guy that
[1:32:54] had mocked God, the keeper of the gate,
[1:32:58] he seen it,
[1:33:00] but he was killed.
[1:33:03] Why? because he didn't believe God.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And that is that is just an example of
[1:33:13] zillions of examples in the Bible that
[1:33:16] you when you're serving God, you'll have
[1:33:18] to overcome
[1:33:21] your own fear.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you another one,
[1:33:28] another example, and we'll close on this
[1:33:30] one. And maybe maybe it'll be fast, but
[1:33:32] let me give you Esther for an example.
[1:33:36] Esther was a Jew.
[1:33:38] And here Hmon the Morortei had had uh
[1:33:42] and and Hmon saw that Morortei was a Jew
[1:33:45] also and he was a beggar. But Hagen
[1:33:48] Morortei, sorry, never showed reverence
[1:33:51] to Hmon. And and and and Hmon got lifted
[1:33:56] up in wrath. He be careful with your
[1:33:59] wrath because it'll control you.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; You won't you won't hurt the people
[1:34:03] you're wrath with. It'll hurt you.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Be careful with that root of bitterness.
[1:34:07] It don't grow in the other people's
[1:34:08] life. It grows in your life.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You let it get a hold of you and
[1:34:12] it will destroy your life. You'll be so
[1:34:15] bitter. Every word that'll come out of
[1:34:17] your mouth will be charcoal.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] And that's what destroyed Hmon. He seen
[1:34:30] Mori was a Jew and because Mordei
[1:34:34] refused to bow to him because he thought
[1:34:37] he was a big shot. He sat on the right
[1:34:39] side of the king.
[1:34:41] He put forth a very law
[1:34:46] took it tricked the king and took a law
[1:34:48] that would destroy all the Jews. And
[1:34:50] that's that's actually in Esther 3
[1:34:56] and verse 5
[1:34:58] maybe five and six
[1:35:01] if we read Esther 1 31 sorry. And after
[1:35:05] these things did the king promote Hmon
[1:35:10] and advance him and he sat on the seat
[1:35:12] of the princes. You know you got to be
[1:35:13] careful with that promotion.
[1:35:16] And so here, Hmon, he was so bugged by
[1:35:21] Mori
[1:35:23] that he built the gallows for him, but
[1:35:25] he got the king to pass the law
[1:35:29] that the that they could their people
[1:35:31] could kill and destroy all the Jews. And
[1:35:35] the letter was sent out, let's just drop
[1:35:37] to verse 13, uh Vicki. And a letter was
[1:35:40] sent out by post unto all the king's
[1:35:43] provinces to destroy, to kill, and to
[1:35:47] cause to perish all Jews, both young and
[1:35:52] old, little children and women in one
[1:35:56] day, even upon the 13th day of the 12th
[1:36:00] month.
[1:36:02] Here was their and there was their
[1:36:04] goddess month and their thing and and
[1:36:06] they could spoil all their wealth.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And here Esther
[1:36:14] was the queen
[1:36:16] of the king.
[1:36:18] And Esther was exactly like me
[1:36:26] and she was exactly like you.
[1:36:29] She had to calculate
[1:36:32] if she could survive.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And so here Mori was her uncle that was
[1:36:40] out.
[1:36:41] And when Mori realized what he was done,
[1:36:44] he rents his clothes. And then we go to
[1:36:46] verse three.
[1:36:49] And let's just read verse three. And
[1:36:51] every province, whethersoever the king's
[1:36:54] commandment decrees. Now see, the king
[1:36:56] wouldn't have did this, but he did it
[1:36:58] out of the hatred of Hmon
[1:37:02] and the jealousy of Hmon. Sister Dama,
[1:37:06] you're fine. I can't even hear it. And
[1:37:09] and here here, watch this. And so it it
[1:37:14] went out through all the country, and
[1:37:16] the Jews went to fasting, weeping, and
[1:37:19] wailing, and many laid in sackcloth and
[1:37:22] ashes.
[1:37:24] Uh-oh. And here comes verse four.
[1:37:28] Here we are.
[1:37:30] And so Esther and her maids and her
[1:37:32] chamberlains came out and they told her.
[1:37:36] And when the when was then the was the
[1:37:40] queen exceedingly grieved.
[1:37:43] Watch this. Watch this. You got to catch
[1:37:45] this. She was grieved.
[1:37:49] But watch how she dealt with it. First,
[1:37:51] she sent Raymond to clothe
[1:37:55] Mori
[1:37:57] and to take away the sackcloth from him
[1:38:01] and he received it. Not
[1:38:05] Esther wanted to go away that it wasn't
[1:38:08] going to cost her her neck.
[1:38:12] And she said, "I'll just send my
[1:38:13] servants out to my uncle with a clean
[1:38:16] set of clothes and he can stop praying
[1:38:20] and he can stop weeping and he can stop
[1:38:23] wailing and we'll pretend
[1:38:26] that God's in our midst."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Is that not what she did?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And Esther's servant in verse 9 came and
[1:38:42] told Esther the words of Mori. Mordei
[1:38:46] would not accept
[1:38:49] her poor quality
[1:38:52] of sending new clothes. And we'll go to
[1:38:54] verse 11 just to save time. And and I
[1:38:57] mean if you want this whole story and if
[1:38:59] I'm you can read this but all the king's
[1:39:02] servants
[1:39:04] and the people in the king's province
[1:39:07] do know here Mori had sent the word to
[1:39:10] Esther that you ARE YOU ARE GOD'S people
[1:39:15] and you could have been born for such a
[1:39:17] time as this. And Esther had to work
[1:39:21] through her fear.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:25] She had a lot of fear.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; If Esther would have been the four
[1:39:31] lepers, she would have stayed right
[1:39:33] where she was. She said, "Well, I'm just
[1:39:34] going to die right here as the queen.
[1:39:38] They can come and kill me on my seat."
[1:39:41] Because Esther went back to Mori and she
[1:39:43] said, "All the king's servants and all
[1:39:45] the king's priests of the provinces do
[1:39:48] know that whatsoever man or woman shall
[1:39:51] come into the king into the inner court
[1:39:53] who has not been called, there is one
[1:39:56] law that he'll put him to death."
[1:40:00] And Esther had to worry about death.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; She
[1:40:06] was afraid.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. She was afraid.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Except such of whom the king shall hold
[1:40:17] out the golden sceppler that he may
[1:40:20] live. And Esther did not believe that
[1:40:22] she could go to the king and live.
[1:40:28] And so Esther was willing that everybody
[1:40:30] in her lineage would be butchered
[1:40:35] and lose not just their life but their
[1:40:38] everything.
[1:40:41] And Mori said to her, she said, "Do you
[1:40:44] think that you're going to be saved
[1:40:46] sitting on the queen's throne
[1:40:50] when they realize
[1:40:52] who you are?" Yeah. Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Do you think you're going to be saved
[1:40:58] because you're a borderline believer
[1:41:01] when they realize
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; what kingdom you're a part of?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; When they recognize what you believe
[1:41:13] in the cross
[1:41:16] and you're a lukewarm believer and you
[1:41:18] think, "Well, I just slide through."
[1:41:23] But they don't believe the cross.
[1:41:27] They believe things like this
[1:41:29] and like this
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; and and on and on and on.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; And that's how they identify
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; their membership.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; And here we'll we'll continue on there
[1:41:51] in that verse. But I have not been
[1:41:53] called. Esser's justifying her fear. She
[1:41:56] said, I have not been called to come to
[1:41:58] the king's house for these 30 days. You
[1:42:02] know, we have not seen Wait, this is I'm
[1:42:05] Can I tell a short lie? WE HAVE NOT SEEN
[1:42:08] GOD MOVE IN this church for 30 days.
[1:42:10] That That's a lie. Sorry. But just to
[1:42:14] and so I'm not going to take a risk now.
[1:42:16] Yeah,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; that's what Esther was saying.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Now, forgive me, God, because we have
[1:42:25] seen him the last 30 days.
[1:42:30] And Esther's servants, verse 12, went
[1:42:33] back and told Mori Esther's
[1:42:37] testimony.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there for just a
[1:42:41] second.
[1:42:44] In verse 13, was Esther's testimony as
[1:42:47] positive as Sister Damas today?
[1:42:54] Uh-uh.
[1:42:56] She was afraid.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; She was afraid to be afraid.
[1:43:06] In verse 13, and Mori verse 13 and Mori
[1:43:10] commanded Esther said, "Think not
[1:43:12] thyself
[1:43:14] that you're going to die also."
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; You think you're going to escape by
[1:43:20] being a
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; quiet
[1:43:25] by being a makebeliever?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; More than all the rest of the Jews.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:34] here in verse 14. For if thou altogether
[1:43:37] holdest thy peace at this time, then
[1:43:40] shall there be an enlargement,
[1:43:42] deliverance, arise to the Jews from
[1:43:45] another place, but thou and thy father's
[1:43:49] house shall be destroyed. See what Mori
[1:43:52] had a mountain of faith. He said, if you
[1:43:56] won't serve God, God will raise up
[1:43:58] somebody else to serve him. He if you
[1:44:01] won't praise God, God will raise up. The
[1:44:03] rocks will cry out and you will die.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And your father's house will be
[1:44:15] destroyed. And whom knoweth whether thou
[1:44:18] were come to the kingdom
[1:44:21] for such a faith for such a time as
[1:44:24] this?
[1:44:26] And you know how the story goes. But if
[1:44:29] we go to 16 verse 16 and just the end of
[1:44:33] 16, Esther came back to Mori
[1:44:37] and it it watch this. I want to show you
[1:44:39] the decision that Esther made
[1:44:43] was based on her uncle's faith.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:44:53] Let me rephrase that. The decision
[1:44:56] Esther made was based 100%
[1:45:03] on her uncle's faith.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just put something in
[1:45:08] here. This is straight from God. That's
[1:45:11] why God says to not forsake the
[1:45:14] assembling of yourself
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:45:17] Because there will be a time
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; when brother Dale is weak.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And it'll be your faith.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; That'll rise me up.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Even people that stand behind the
[1:45:35] pulpit, they get weaker than anybody
[1:45:37] else quicker
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; normally.
[1:45:41] Verse
[1:45:44] 16, she said, "Gather all the Jews
[1:45:47] together and pray and fast, Mary." But
[1:45:50] if you go to the end of this, "And so
[1:45:53] will I go into the king, which is not
[1:45:58] according to the law.
[1:46:03] And if I perish,
[1:46:06] I'll perish."
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:13] You see, we believe
[1:46:15] I believe as Christians, we'll follow
[1:46:18] the law
[1:46:20] as long as it don't become between you
[1:46:24] and God's law.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; That's where it completely draws the
[1:46:30] line. You know, most people don't
[1:46:33] realize, but everybody in the Bible,
[1:46:38] almost everybody,
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; I could show you dozen, at least a
[1:46:41] dozen, all broke the law of the land
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; to serve God.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And most of you would think they're
[1:46:53] pretty great people.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; But also, most of you today
[1:47:02] Would you do the same thing?
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; God requires us to conquer our fear.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God requires us to conquer our
[1:47:18] fear.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's many, many scriptures
[1:47:21] we'll go into next week, but you have to
[1:47:25] you cannot serve. There's no fear in
[1:47:28] love. Yeah,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; but perfect love casts out fear. But you
[1:47:33] know, you see, you can't do nothing. You
[1:47:36] can't do nothing out of fear.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; People that are consumed with fear are
[1:47:41] completely handicapped.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to drive. I'm afraid to fly.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to go on a high bridge.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to go in a cave.
[1:47:55] I'm afraid to
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just afraid.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe
[1:48:03] maybe you're afraid for a reason.
[1:48:07] You don't have faith in the right thing.
[1:48:11] Amen. If you have faith in God
[1:48:15] and God sees your fa that you know the
[1:48:18] Bible talks about a grain of mustard
[1:48:21] seed. Now I want to show you something.
[1:48:23] I used to pull mustard as a kid and it
[1:48:25] was worse than a nightmare.
[1:48:29] But a grain of mustard seed is like
[1:48:31] beach sand. Like one grain of sand. It's
[1:48:34] like treeful seed. You got eyes like me.
[1:48:37] You probably couldn't even see it. You
[1:48:38] could feel it.
[1:48:41] It's tiny, but it'll grow so big that
[1:48:44] the birds will lodge in it like a tree.
[1:48:47] Amen. A grain of mustard seed. If God
[1:48:50] sees a grain of mustard seed and your
[1:48:53] faith, he'll make the enemy you're an
[1:48:56] army.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; You'll make the enemy you're an army
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; because he sees your faith. Well, I want
[1:49:04] to close with this. It's a without
[1:49:06] faith,
[1:49:10] without a risk.
[1:49:13] See, faith is the evidence of things
[1:49:15] hoped for,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; but the things not seen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Without a risk, it is impossible
[1:49:25] for you to please God.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:49:30] Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; God help us. Let's stand.
[1:49:37] Amen.
[1:49:39] Amen. God knows what he's doing. We'll
[1:49:41] have our communion next Sunday, Lord
[1:49:43] willing. If there ain't another ice
[1:49:45] storm.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Uh at some point we'll just end up
[1:49:48] having it if we have a good oldfashioned
[1:49:51] winter.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Might just have to do that. Amen.
[1:49:56] Amen. God is good, man.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. All the time.
[1:50:02] Let's sing that song we were singing.
[1:50:03] have blow the trumpet.
[1:50:05] It's a very, very, very short song.
[1:50:08] Jared sings beautiful, beautiful songs,
[1:50:11] but he ain't sing this one for a while.
[1:50:16] You know,
[1:50:18] God loves worship.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; The very meaning of God is an object of
[1:50:24] worship.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; And the only ones that can really
[1:50:27] worship him are the ones that are a part
[1:50:30] of him.
[1:50:31] born again with the baptism of the Holy
[1:50:33] Ghost. If you're a part of God, you
[1:50:36] really worship the deity, you know, and
[1:50:39] I I I want to just say this and close. I
[1:50:42] I'm going to say it next week, so this
[1:50:44] is going to be rerun for you all, but
[1:50:47] you know, uh in our church here,
[1:50:52] we have too much fear.
[1:51:00] We do.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be perfect in my eyes.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; If God's dealing with your heart, it's
[1:51:08] not about pleasing me.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; It's about you pleasing God.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; If there's somebody here and God's
[1:51:14] moving on your heart and you want to
[1:51:15] cry, you cry. It's okay.
[1:51:19] Yeah.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; If God's moving on your kids' heart and
[1:51:22] they want to be a runus, let them be a
[1:51:24] runus,
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; you don't think God can make them quiet.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; If you want to get up and run the aisles
[1:51:31] and that's God, you run the aisles.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; And if you want to speak in tongues and
[1:51:38] God will have somebody to interpret it
[1:51:41] or prophesy or sing a special
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; or do any of the nine spiritual gifts,
[1:51:49] Who are you afraid of?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of me.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm a the only the only person that
[1:52:00] we want to this is a different type of
[1:52:02] fear is respect. Fear of respects to
[1:52:06] God.
[1:52:09] But if God wants to manifest something
[1:52:11] in anybody's life,
[1:52:14] you know you I this is fresh. I you got
[1:52:18] to hear this. Do you know the way we run
[1:52:20] our church
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; is Catholic?
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you're standing, but just just
[1:52:30] take a minute. The way I'm dressed up
[1:52:32] this morning
[1:52:34] is Catholic.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Because I'm higher than you is Catholic.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Catholic. Do you know in the
[1:52:43] New Testament the churches were in homes
[1:52:46] sitting around on the same level in a
[1:52:48] circle and it was A FELLOWSHIP?
[1:52:51] BUT WE'VE RAISED UP A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD.
[1:52:54] YOU WANT SOME HOLY PERSON TO PUT A ROBE
[1:52:57] ON, WEAR A GOLDEN CROWN,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; and we're going to hire good singers.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; But I a fellowship
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; is you have as much to say as I do.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I'm not called to preach."
[1:53:20] I didn't say that.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll cry.
[1:53:25] Maybe you'll prophesy.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll run the aisles.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll testify.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And we have we have out of fear, we've
[1:53:39] taken the participaction
[1:53:41] out of the people and raised up a holy
[1:53:44] priesthood that don't read the Bible.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; All of that's Rome.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Remember, Rome didn't want you to have a
[1:53:52] Bible. We'll tell you what you're
[1:53:53] supposed to believe. We'll tell you when
[1:53:54] you're supposed to speak in tongues.
[1:53:56] We'll tell you if you're supposed to
[1:53:57] prophesy. We'll tell you if you're
[1:53:58] supposed to testify. But what if God
[1:54:01] tells you to testify?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; And what if God didn't tell me that he
[1:54:11] told you to testify and you hold it in?
[1:54:15] Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; What if God told you to get blessed, but
[1:54:20] he didn't tell me that you were going to
[1:54:21] get blessed and he wanted to bless the
[1:54:24] whole body and you hold it in because
[1:54:26] you're afraid of
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; See, if we're going to get rid of some
[1:54:38] of the Roman doctrines, we want to get
[1:54:39] rid of them all. Yeah.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; If somebody wants to start praying and
[1:54:44] crying, you're not going to interrupt
[1:54:46] God.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; We got so much church order, we don't
[1:54:50] even have church.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; We just have Rome.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something. Rome has great
[1:55:02] church order
