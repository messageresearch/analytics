[39:24] losing my mind uh just happy and and

[39:31] the man come and T tune in on Wednesday
[39:33] and I also want to thank you know and

[39:42] just send it to the church uh we'll take
[39:44] care of it other the ties uh I wouldn't
[39:46] be surprised you need half a
[39:48] dozen because wow uh it
[39:52] was I I mean it was extreme extremely
[39:56] heavy and if you don't think so just
[39:58] come to the corner and just try to pick
[40:00] it up just just just a corner of it you
[40:04] you will understand perfectly when they
[40:06] come up those stairs and the three boys
[40:09] and Esther was on this side that piano
[40:11] tipped whoa I almost seen Stars I
[40:14] thought it was really really heavy but
[40:17] we had the tuner come an older gentleman
[40:20] and uh that we we know he's from betro
[40:23] and and I want to just show you how
[40:24] God's working am man he he just walked
[40:26] then the piano was closed up or well I
[40:29] think it was closed up or something he
[40:31] just literally walked up went around the
[40:33] piano and he said this piano's worth
[40:34] about 3 to 4,000 by the by the look of
[40:37] it you know the the quality of it the
[40:40] look of it and the first thing he did is
[40:41] he pulled out the song book part that
[40:43] that board pulls out it's on brass on
[40:45] either side he just pulled that out and
[40:47] he looked in right where he would work
[40:50] and that's where the pins the head bins
[40:52] the head pins of the piano are and the
[40:54] strings he said you have brand new pins
[40:57] and brand new strings he said that would
[40:59] cost you
[41:00] $4,000 an additional dollars but the the
[41:03] best part it continues to get better and
[41:06] better so he tuned it and I was in my
[41:08] office and he come to leave and and uh
[41:11] actually he he liked our tuning
[41:13] instruments that came with the piano so
[41:15] well he wanted to take them with him and
[41:18] I said you might take a trip someday and
[41:20] we might have to get a different tuner
[41:22] and thank you very much but we'll keep
[41:23] the tuning instruments here amen and so
[41:27] it was all positive and and so he was
[41:28] saying he said you know I'll come back
[41:30] and fine tune it but he said the piano
[41:32] is so tight and so stiff and so good
[41:36] that I can't find tune it until you play
[41:38] it and
[41:41] worship that sounded that was going that
[41:43] was going the right way I said well you
[41:45] don't have to worry brother I said my
[41:46] grandson will be beaten on that piano
[41:48] tonight and he said well does your wife
[41:49] play and I said oh yeah multiple people
[41:52] in the church and he said well that's
[41:54] what I've heard around town he said I
[41:56] I've heard that you have really loud
[41:58] worship around
[42:00] town and he lives in betro and I've
[42:03] never seen his
[42:04] face and he was probably a 65 year old
[42:08] man he man I I I went up there I said oh
[42:11] praise God the town knows we at least
[42:12] know how to make a Joyful Noise amen
[42:16] amen so we just praise God for
[42:18] that and all that was a part of it and
[42:22] you know I was saying Wednesday night
[42:23] said God will be so good to you he will
[42:25] give you things that you're not even
[42:27] looking for I would have said we didn't
[42:29] need a
[42:31] piano wow he don't even know the
[42:34] goodness that he'll bring to you and
[42:35] he'll just bring it anyway amen you can

[53:01] believe what he said about me what he
[53:04] said about you Hallelujah amazing you
[53:08] know you know our message you know uh if
[53:12] we get a revelation of this message in
[53:15] the next two or three times I I will
[53:17] this will definitely be at to part two
[53:19] or three at least definitely but if we
[53:22] get a revelation of this we will never
[53:24] separate
[53:25] for anything other
[53:29] than
[53:33] Disobedience to the
[53:36] word you know Moses wrote the
[53:39] law and Paul wrote Grace and I I I'm and
[53:42] so you know and and I I I want to say
[53:45] this as a disclaimer if you honestly
[53:47] have a question I'm going to say some
[53:49] stuff that are right on the line to to
[53:52] jar
[53:53] us and and if so if you have a question
[53:55] about the line don't don't hide just ask
[53:59] me and I I'll and I'll bring it right
[54:01] show you but you know if we're preaching
[54:04] a denominational message we could go to
[54:07] that
[54:12] church a denominational message is not
[54:16] election it's not
[54:19] election and so I'm going to drop a
[54:23] bomb it don't matter what you do or have
[54:27] done in your life it don't matter what
[54:31] we do in this church or have done in
[54:34] this
[54:37] church if it's
[54:38] election it'll be
[54:41] there if it's elected it'll be there and
[54:45] I'm going to show you 20 examples where
[54:48] the Bible disobeyed the
[54:53] Bible don't be all no no there see
[54:56] there's law and there's Grace I'm going
[54:59] to show you multiple examples where the
[55:02] Bible I know the Bible don't contradict
[55:05] itself it's a
[55:08] mystery it's the Bible like I didn't say
[55:10] it contradicted itself it's a mystery of
[55:15] a omnipotent
[55:18] God you know just to to just to drop
[55:22] just to get you on my side you know God
[55:26] told people in the Bible to kill people
[55:28] so what are you going to do if Thou
[55:29] shalt not kill he told people multiple
[55:33] people in the Bible to take all their
[55:34] clothes off what are you going to do
[55:35] with
[55:36] modesty they're both in the same Bible
[55:39] and your Prophet said that God told them
[55:43] to do
[55:47] that see it's a
[55:50] mster God is Ultimate
[55:54] Authority and ultimate power I'm going
[55:57] somewhere with this just hang on when
[55:59] you recognize the revelation of an I'm
[56:01] not talking about I'm not condoning sin
[56:05] I believe in Holiness and I believe you
[56:07] have to have Holiness to see God and I
[56:09] was raised Holiness and if we followed
[56:12] the Holiness I was raised that would
[56:14] brush a lot of us off the screen amen so
[56:18] I'm not forgetting
[56:20] that but when you recognize the
[56:23] omnipotent of a PRI predestination
[56:27] election it changes all your religion
[56:31] and you could never look at a brother or
[56:34] sister in the church and say I wouldn't
[56:37] do
[56:40] that I wouldn't do
[56:42] that I couldn't do
[56:45] that and how do you know you know you
[56:48] know there was one
[56:52] Minister that when we made the step now
[56:56] this is POS I'm I'm trying to show you
[56:58] something and and this is long we're
[56:59] going to read a scripture in a moment
[57:01] there was one Minister when I called him
[57:04] and told him that we were going to start
[57:06] a home
[57:07] church he he drove hours to see us and
[57:10] he actually believed we were leaving the
[57:13] message and I'm like no no like how can
[57:16] I leave who I am no no that was not even
[57:19] the he it was completely
[57:22] misunderstood and you know what he told
[57:24] me
[57:26] he said you know what God told
[57:29] you and you can't even tell me what God
[57:32] told you and so I I support you because
[57:35] God told you
[57:42] that and see re Christianity is
[57:48] divided on opinions I'm trying to make
[57:51] us a family is what I'm trying to do
[57:54] God's trying trying to make you a family
[57:55] you know God's actually going to take us
[57:57] home
[58:00] someday
[58:02] hello
[58:04] and and see I'm brother Dale and you're
[58:08] not brother Dale so that means
[58:11] we're two identities but we're not two
[58:15] identities and that's where the struggle
[58:17] is and there's times where you I'm going
[58:21] to show and and and listen so i' not
[58:24] condone sin it's going to seem like this
[58:26] whole two or three messages brother Dale
[58:29] says brother Bram said If You Preach
[58:31] predestination to disgrace a Grace to a
[58:35] disgrace no no I'm not talking about
[58:37] that and if you know me that
[58:41] much you'll know
[58:45] that but things
[58:52] happen and
[58:55] we're not supposed to throw each other
[58:57] out with the wash the bad water no
[58:59] matter what
[59:02] happens and God knows that he had to
[59:04] spank brother Dale with the
[59:08] rod many
[59:10] times and it took a good 30 years for
[59:12] the rod to reach the brain he should
[59:16] have started beating from the head down
[59:18] I
[59:20] think and things would happen in the
[59:22] church and you would just like that's
[59:24] wrong bless
[59:27] God and a time that people needed Grace
[59:31] understanding and
[59:32] love they got rejection
[59:38] judgmental
[59:41] Bible oh there you go well bless God I I
[59:44] seen that in the
[59:51] Bible
[59:53] amen
[59:55] understanding the
[59:57] mystery of a sovereign God you know what
[1:00:01] the Mysteries are
[1:00:02] revealed brother Bram said in the
[1:00:05] seventh
[1:00:06] seal that he Christ opened the seventh
[1:00:09] seal he opened it and his very next
[1:00:11] words was but it's a mystery it's open
[1:00:14] but it's a and it's a mystery and you
[1:00:17] got to become in him and and I'm going
[1:00:20] to if you allow me you know I'm going to
[1:00:22] try and I want you to really understand
[1:00:24] the
[1:00:25] scriptures what the prophet says and if
[1:00:29] if if I lose control then I'll come back
[1:00:31] and slow down because it makes me really
[1:00:34] happy because see if Christ hadn't given
[1:00:37] me his love I wouldn't have been here
[1:00:40] I'm not
[1:00:41] worthy you
[1:00:43] understand I deserve
[1:00:47] hell but he chose
[1:00:53] election Lo loaded with mistakes you're
[1:00:56] not coming here because you think I'm if
[1:00:59] cuz if you do you'll be you'll probably
[1:01:00] be gone by next month cuz you know you
[1:01:04] loaded with
[1:01:06] mistakes loaded with
[1:01:11] mistakes but
[1:01:13] election let's
[1:01:17] stand Hallelujah let's turn to uh Isaiah
[1:01:20] 558 to11 and then we're going to read in
[1:01:23] Revelations and and and I I just tell
[1:01:26] you God bless you again we love you and
[1:01:29] we want you to do whatever you can do to
[1:01:31] worship God and bless yourself and one
[1:01:34] another and and you know I just uh we we
[1:01:39] want to be on the word and and we want
[1:01:41] to be obedient but we want to go in a
[1:01:43] rapture we want all of the good things
[1:01:46] of God Amen Isaiah 558 to1 for my
[1:01:51] thoughts are not your thoughts uhoh
[1:01:56] and neither are your ways my ways but I
[1:01:58] have some pretty good ways I was raised
[1:02:00] in the message well almost the
[1:02:02] message saith the Lord for as the
[1:02:05] heavens is higher than the earth so are
[1:02:07] my ways higher than your ways and my
[1:02:10] thoughts than your thoughts for as the
[1:02:13] rain comes down and the snow from heaven
[1:02:16] and returneth not thither but WTH the
[1:02:19] Earth and maketh it to bring forth and
[1:02:22] Bud that it may give seed to the swer
[1:02:26] and bread to the
[1:02:28] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[1:02:32] forth out of my mouth and it shall not
[1:02:35] return onto me void so it it's not it's
[1:02:38] not possible you remember if you do
[1:02:40] something for God you're going to get a
[1:02:42] grand piano you're going you know what I
[1:02:44] mean it's just that you're not even
[1:02:46] looking for it can't come back empty but
[1:02:50] it shall accomplish uhoh that's a big
[1:02:53] word that which I God pleased it's
[1:02:58] accomplishing God's will not brother
[1:03:00] Dale's will and it shall
[1:03:03] prosper in the thing where
[1:03:07] soever I send you now that let me
[1:03:10] rephrase that just a few and you shall
[1:03:13] prosper and you and and all of you not
[1:03:17] just the fight and all of you shall
[1:03:22] prosper in the thing
[1:03:25] wheresoever Christ the anointed
[1:03:29] one sendeth
[1:03:33] you that's election Romans 8:29 and 30
[1:03:39] and I want to emphasize on the last
[1:03:41] phrase of this thing and this is the
[1:03:44] most common scripture in everything to
[1:03:47] do with the message um I understand that
[1:03:50] perfectly
[1:03:52] and for whom I did for
[1:03:55] no he also did
[1:03:58] predestinate now that person is going to
[1:04:00] make some big
[1:04:03] mistakes to be conformed to the image of
[1:04:06] his son that he might be the firstborn
[1:04:10] among many Brethren now I want to show
[1:04:12] you something there's not a time limit
[1:04:15] you either are or you
[1:04:17] aren't
[1:04:19] period I know I know there's you know
[1:04:22] the seeds there and the Sun hits it and
[1:04:24] it brings forth
[1:04:26] life moreover whom he did
[1:04:29] predestinate see this predestination
[1:04:32] part is what I'm telling you is you're
[1:04:34] predestinated whether the sun's hit the
[1:04:35] seed or hasn't hit the seed you're still
[1:04:38] predestinated okay pred them he also
[1:04:43] called them whether they show it or not
[1:04:46] whether they go to the Mandarin too much
[1:04:48] or
[1:04:49] not and to whom he called them he also
[1:04:52] did justify now that ain't based on you
[1:04:56] that's based on
[1:04:58] him and that ain't based on a Brother
[1:05:00] justifying you see you know a brother
[1:05:03] don't have to have another brother's
[1:05:05] approval we don't we're not
[1:05:09] Catholic whom he justified them now this
[1:05:13] the part them them people them people
[1:05:17] that so that's not just fivefold
[1:05:18] Ministry he didn't say just just the you
[1:05:20] know the the the the ministry or just
[1:05:23] the the es or just the prophets but them
[1:05:28] Christ God is
[1:05:31] already past tense in your sin yes in
[1:05:35] your sin and in your
[1:05:38] mistakes he's
[1:05:40] already glorified
[1:05:43] you
[1:05:44] Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus I pray
[1:05:48] that what you showed me and that that
[1:05:51] that this bride here will will grab on
[1:05:53] to to and and and and God it's going to
[1:05:57] take us some time to digest your mystery
[1:06:01] you you're just you know God we we just
[1:06:03] have a small
[1:06:05] brain and it's you're
[1:06:09] omnipotent and God we'll we'll just fill
[1:06:12] up everything we can with you and then
[1:06:14] the rest we just
[1:06:15] nod help me
[1:06:19] Jesus
[1:06:21] hallelujah
[1:06:22] amen amen God bless you I want to let
[1:06:25] read some quotes and so I I mean we're
[1:06:28] all doing good I want you to understand
[1:06:30] now everybody here in brother Dale this
[1:06:33] is not a message condoning free love and
[1:06:38] free worldliness everybody
[1:06:43] understand that's
[1:06:45] important I apologize in advance for our
[1:06:47] screen it needs a hammer or something
[1:06:50] that's how I fix things if something's
[1:06:52] broke on the farm I get a ballpen
[1:06:54] hammer it it's broke amen but we'll do
[1:07:00] our best to repair
[1:07:02] it amen and so the denomination and my
[1:07:07] upbringing was Israel's upbringing in
[1:07:10] the Old Testament you know we we preach
[1:07:12] from the Old Testament and it's good but
[1:07:14] it's a shadow see if they did good and
[1:07:17] were good boys and girls they got candy
[1:07:20] but if they didn't do it they didn't get
[1:07:21] candy and everything we think about like
[1:07:24] if we work hard we get a bigger paycheck
[1:07:26] we work overtime we get you know but
[1:07:28] this here is
[1:07:30] different and you're going to struggle
[1:07:32] with it and brother Dale is
[1:07:34] too we're thinking that like we get
[1:07:37] something that we didn't have nothing to
[1:07:39] do with you know you know how you know
[1:07:43] we know the truth and and you know the
[1:07:45] truth but you know you had nothing to do
[1:07:48] with coming to God even though you know
[1:07:51] that and you believe that you're still
[1:07:53] struggling strugling with it is anybody
[1:07:56] breathing here this
[1:07:57] morning you're still struggling with it
[1:08:00] then because in your flesh you think ah
[1:08:03] I was pretty good I made a good
[1:08:11] decision come on you're
[1:08:14] breathing that's called
[1:08:19] self-esteem but this don't
[1:08:22] apply here it don't
[1:08:24] apply here in the Supernatural brother
[1:08:28] Brown said he said he's got a book in
[1:08:29] heaven called The Book of Life and if
[1:08:31] your names not in the book of life
[1:08:33] you're lost and will go to hell
[1:08:37] period period don't matter if you're a
[1:08:40] message preacher that's just
[1:08:44] period oh bless God I was a deacon for
[1:08:47] 400 years it don't matter it's
[1:08:51] period he said
[1:08:54] and PR he said it don't matter if you
[1:08:56] got a letter from every Church in the
[1:08:58] world you're going to
[1:09:03] hell that's against everything you have
[1:09:06] ever heard in your whole entire
[1:09:09] life for sure you're upbringing if
[1:09:12] you're good you know we take mom and dad
[1:09:14] takes to church that's the right thing
[1:09:15] to do and we get an evangelist in and
[1:09:18] you'll go to the Altar and you made all
[1:09:20] those decisions no no you didn't make
[1:09:21] any of
[1:09:22] them
[1:09:27] wow and so there's people that aren't
[1:09:29] here yet that are one of us and many of
[1:09:33] them are connected in our our extended
[1:09:35] families and we've made some huge
[1:09:38] mistakes
[1:09:40] because wait a minute wait a brother
[1:09:43] Dale has made some huge
[1:09:47] mistakes it's called
[1:09:51] judge you know there's something that is
[1:09:53] a applies to all of us and that was
[1:09:55] respects to
[1:09:57] persons and if you have that in any form
[1:10:00] shape or matter then you're guilty of
[1:10:02] the entire Bible that doesn't apply in
[1:10:05] the Old
[1:10:06] Testament so you know I'm
[1:10:12] just I there's some things I'm almost
[1:10:15] saying but I
[1:10:19] can't you see in election sin can
[1:10:25] happen and it wasn't that God agreed
[1:10:27] with
[1:10:28] it but he will turn it around to his
[1:10:32] will and he'll get more
[1:10:35] glory and brother Dale will not
[1:10:37] understand it I will not understand
[1:10:41] it I'm still not understanding
[1:10:48] it here in another one he said the Beast
[1:10:51] will deceive all on the earth who whose
[1:10:53] names are not written in the Lamb's Book
[1:10:57] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:10:58] world he said that's right he said
[1:10:59] that's the reason people today that that
[1:11:03] when you're not
[1:11:04] called how can you
[1:11:08] come amen it amen and and see I want I
[1:11:13] want to just put a disclaimer in here
[1:11:15] for even the video this does not mean
[1:11:17] that God's up there with a big stick
[1:11:19] that's not the God I'm serving it just
[1:11:21] means that God is so
[1:11:24] amazing and Brilliant and omnipotent is
[1:11:27] the word I want that he knew the
[1:11:30] beginning from the end I am the Alpha
[1:11:31] and the mego the beginning and the end
[1:11:34] that he knew which flea was going to
[1:11:36] land on which you know my dad used to
[1:11:38] sing a song and I'm just going slow
[1:11:40] because we need to get this because
[1:11:43] there's if anybody's read the news
[1:11:45] lately there might be a Rapture happened
[1:11:47] in our lifetime okay my dad used to sing
[1:11:50] a song about you know there's a log in
[1:11:52] the bottom of the sea and then there's
[1:11:53] there's a bump on the log in the bottom
[1:11:54] sea and then there's a frog on the bump
[1:11:55] on the log in the bottom sea and then
[1:11:57] there's a ward on the Frog on the bump
[1:11:58] in the l sea and then there's a fly on
[1:12:00] the wart on the bump on the log in the
[1:12:01] bottom of the sea and then there's a
[1:12:02] flea on the on the ward on the frog and
[1:12:04] the bump on the log in the bottom of the
[1:12:05] sea and it goes on and on and on on on
[1:12:07] forever until your grandkids fall
[1:12:10] asleep and that's like
[1:12:14] God he knew that there was a flee on the
[1:12:16] flea of the ward of the Frog
[1:12:19] and because he's omnipotent amen
[1:12:24] what does it mean he people ask him he
[1:12:27] said who will be
[1:12:28] there I I'm trying to make my quotes
[1:12:31] really short it's not to bring them out
[1:12:33] of context I'll show you the whole book
[1:12:36] message or page but it's so we can
[1:12:38] Minister and Rhythm he said what does
[1:12:40] this mean he said if your names that are
[1:12:43] written on the Lamb's Book a knife
[1:12:45] tonight to
[1:12:48] tonight names that are written on the
[1:12:50] Lamb's Book of Life Life what does it
[1:12:54] mean he said their sins are forgiven
[1:12:57] them
[1:13:00] period like period even though brother
[1:13:04] Dale's eyes can still see
[1:13:07] sin I struggle with that CU like I think
[1:13:11] you know you should be a pretty good boy
[1:13:14] to Mar your testimony and I believe
[1:13:17] those things but we're going a different
[1:13:19] avenue to to to stretch our
[1:13:22] understanding of omnipotent God he
[1:13:26] said he said go on he said if your
[1:13:28] name's not this another quote believe th
[1:13:31] this if your name's not in heaven you
[1:13:34] will go to
[1:13:37] hell that's right only those whose names
[1:13:40] are written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:43] by being redeemed born
[1:13:46] again will be there he said except the
[1:13:50] man be born again he shall not enter the
[1:13:51] Kingdom of Heaven amen see you in the
[1:13:55] election you were born again before you
[1:13:58] were born
[1:14:03] again I know that's stretching your
[1:14:05] thought it believe me it stretched mine
[1:14:07] too I've had this on the burner for a
[1:14:09] long time I've mentioned little precepts
[1:14:11] of this because it would pop out I
[1:14:13] mentioned about David and different
[1:14:16] things you know what I just said your
[1:14:19] sins are forgiving
[1:14:21] you even though
[1:14:24] it don't show because he said all that
[1:14:28] were in my hand won't be
[1:14:30] lost there's ones this morning because
[1:14:33] brother Dale is still here and you're
[1:14:35] still here that are in his hand that are
[1:14:39] not here this morning and they're not in
[1:14:40] any church and they maybe are in the bar
[1:14:42] we're sleeping with you know they're
[1:14:46] sinning and to
[1:14:49] God they're committing adultery they're
[1:14:51] already glorified they're already there
[1:14:53] but you can't see none of it because
[1:14:56] you're
[1:14:57] trapped in a body of
[1:15:00] clay now I'm not promoting I'm not going
[1:15:03] to have one of those people come in and
[1:15:04] like lead songs or like play the piano
[1:15:07] and lead us in worship but in God's mind
[1:15:11] they're already doing
[1:15:14] that amen now I mean this should make us
[1:15:18] rejoice before we get to the end of it
[1:15:20] this is not a downer this should make
[1:15:21] you lose your mind because see if you're
[1:15:24] God's even in your failures you're going
[1:15:27] to be there and so see we got we we need
[1:15:31] to be really careful
[1:15:33] that and I'm not talking about a
[1:15:35] charismatic church I I God knows I I'm
[1:15:38] not interested but
[1:15:41] but but we can't judge
[1:15:44] others the Bi Bible says that he says
[1:15:46] judge not or you'll be judged according
[1:15:48] to the measure and that's at the end of
[1:15:50] my notes and if I scroll there my iPad
[1:15:52] might do something funny but that's
[1:15:54] Bible you know now I know the word
[1:15:56] judges but this is the word I'm
[1:15:58] preaching this morning because I'm going
[1:16:00] to start bringing up some some some
[1:16:02] words
[1:16:05] amen let's go to uh Malachi 1
[1:16:09] 1:3 and read this
[1:16:13] here
[1:16:15] um Malachi 1 1 to3 and I'm I'm just
[1:16:18] going to go on and I I pray you'll get
[1:16:20] us and forgive me if I say a word wrong
[1:16:23] uh no that's I want something different
[1:16:25] than
[1:16:26] that I'm saying it
[1:16:28] wrong
[1:16:31] um m a l a c h
[1:16:34] i Malachi sorry 1 1 to3 I'm sorry I'm
[1:16:38] I'm sorry your pastor is but um
[1:16:41] it's still the same word and we're
[1:16:43] reading 1 to three and the burden of the
[1:16:45] word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I
[1:16:49] have loved
[1:16:51] you sayith the Lord Lord yay ye say
[1:16:55] wherein hast thou loved us that was
[1:16:58] judah's song God's saying I love you
[1:17:02] period and you're saying I don't see
[1:17:05] it that's us right now that's our me
[1:17:08] even say can we make it personal and say
[1:17:11] this is a Wyoming church God loves us
[1:17:13] but I said well I don't I don't really
[1:17:14] see the love for that watch this and he
[1:17:17] and he says cuz he's now now now now the
[1:17:21] prophet is challeng ing
[1:17:24] God he's really
[1:17:27] Brave he said was not Esau Jacob's
[1:17:31] brother
[1:17:34] uhoh let me ask you something what kind
[1:17:37] of a little peabrain person has the
[1:17:40] right to
[1:17:42] challenge
[1:17:44] Jehovah the prophet's doing
[1:17:48] it he said was not Esau Jacob's brother
[1:17:53] sayith the Lord yay you have loved Jacob
[1:17:56] and hated
[1:17:57] Esau and let his and lay his mountains
[1:18:01] and his Heritage to West to waste for
[1:18:05] the dragons of the Wilderness now here I
[1:18:09] want to just lay a bit of a foundation
[1:18:10] there Jacob was a liar and a deceiver
[1:18:14] and a
[1:18:17] bride and if he would have come here to
[1:18:19] church we would have threw him
[1:18:21] out
[1:18:27] yep and Esau was a good
[1:18:32] brother
[1:18:35] ouch
[1:18:37] ouch and they weren't even born and God
[1:18:40] had already made his
[1:18:42] opinion that's how much they had to do
[1:18:44] with it ouch and they actually had the
[1:18:49] same mama and
[1:18:50] papa ouch
[1:18:54] ouch is that a
[1:18:58] mystery now if we would have been
[1:19:00] judging this in Wyoming church we were
[1:19:02] said now Esau you can be a deacon Jacob
[1:19:07] you can be the janitor you can't even be
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] janitor listen what our Prophet said
[1:19:13] about that he said you see they cannot
[1:19:16] he's talk this this is for you you
[1:19:21] cannot figure out God's
[1:19:27] love it don't make
[1:19:29] sense it don't make no sense he says you
[1:19:32] see they could not figure out God's love
[1:19:35] their thoughts of that love meant no
[1:19:39] suffering their thoughts of that love
[1:19:42] meant a baby in a a parental care but
[1:19:47] God said that his love was election
[1:19:50] elective love
[1:19:53] elective love and the proof that his
[1:19:55] love is love is
[1:19:58] election it's don't that's no matter
[1:20:01] what happens this is this is this is
[1:20:04] your Prophet saying that oh you thought
[1:20:06] I was going out in a limb I had a backup
[1:20:08] plan he said no matter what happens his
[1:20:11] love is proven truly by the fact that
[1:20:13] they were chosen unto salvation because
[1:20:17] God has chosen you unto
[1:20:20] salvation by his spirit and the belief
[1:20:23] of Truth period but it didn't
[1:20:28] show is that
[1:20:33] amazing how you say God loves us but we
[1:20:37] can't understand our
[1:20:39] God and God wants you to understand him
[1:20:43] and we need to understand him and trust
[1:20:45] him you know there's a reason God said
[1:20:48] unless you become as a little
[1:20:51] child there there's got to be I mean I
[1:20:54] love these little my grandkids and
[1:20:56] brother Bernard's kids I mean oh wow you
[1:21:00] know there's just it's just nothing but
[1:21:02] just
[1:21:02] love there's
[1:21:06] no there's no conditions they're not
[1:21:09] concerned about what they're eating for
[1:21:11] lunch they're not concerned about where
[1:21:13] they're sleeping no those SS is they're
[1:21:16] not they're not trying to figure out
[1:21:18] nothing it's just they're not trying to
[1:21:20] figure out God it's just I love God
[1:21:23] period but but but God I I don't I they
[1:21:26] don't even very seldom when they're
[1:21:28] small they don't even say I don't
[1:21:30] understand Isaiah or little Curtis there
[1:21:34] they don't say I don't understand you
[1:21:35] brother
[1:21:36] Dale they don't come to me and say they
[1:21:39] don't even say why yet they haven't went
[1:21:42] to the wise yet we never left the
[1:21:48] wise but why but why
[1:21:53] but why but why why why why why why why
[1:22:03] why
[1:22:07] huh let's go to John
[1:22:10] 6
[1:22:13] 53 and here's Jesus talking he said now
[1:22:16] and and we're going to go into a a long
[1:22:18] thing and I I want
[1:22:20] to we're going to this this is an
[1:22:23] amazing thing here and Jesus said unto
[1:22:25] them verily verily I say unto you except
[1:22:27] you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:22:30] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:22:34] in me now that is that's that's going
[1:22:36] right on the edge you know just
[1:22:41] kind I'm choosing a
[1:22:46] church I don't think it'll be Jesus
[1:22:50] church whosoever eth My Flesh and
[1:22:53] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:22:55] I will raise him
[1:22:57] up at the last day for my flesh is meat
[1:23:02] indeed and my blood is is drink indeed
[1:23:05] and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh
[1:23:07] my blood dwelleth in me and I in him and
[1:23:10] as the father
[1:23:12] liveth as the father live living in me
[1:23:16] hasth sent me and I live by the father
[1:23:18] so has
[1:23:19] he so he that eateth me even shall he
[1:23:23] live by me and I'm going to read a huge
[1:23:26] quote now that is just I mean we
[1:23:29] understand that scripture what Jesus
[1:23:31] meant but I want to shock you with
[1:23:34] something our Prophet said Jesus never
[1:23:37] explained
[1:23:42] it not even a little
[1:23:45] bit he also said he said that he had too
[1:23:48] many followers that he knew weren't real
[1:23:50] Believers and so he was trying trying to
[1:23:52] get rid of them by preaching the
[1:23:56] word so he was saying things ridiculous
[1:23:59] yeah ridiculous it's okay to say
[1:24:02] that to get rid of all the other and I'm
[1:24:05] going to show you some more stuff it's
[1:24:07] what our Prophet said You Know It's Just
[1:24:08] Amazing Just it it blows my mind our
[1:24:12] Prophet said he never went after them
[1:24:14] tried to counsel them chase them he he
[1:24:17] more or less said don't let the door
[1:24:19] bang you when you
[1:24:21] go
[1:24:24] now now I'm Not Jesus so he he knew who
[1:24:27] was his and who wasn't but can we read a
[1:24:29] quote about that would that be okay now
[1:24:35] um now now now this is probably my
[1:24:38] longest quote so we're just at the
[1:24:40] beginning and so if you'll bear with me
[1:24:43] and put up with my poor reading but I
[1:24:45] want you to catch the the theme of
[1:24:47] Christ himself our
[1:24:49] example our example and maybe before I
[1:24:53] read this I want to show you that you
[1:24:54] know Jesus family I mean this really
[1:24:59] from Abraham to Jesus was 42
[1:25:03] Generations he come
[1:25:05] through two
[1:25:07] prostitutes a bunch of
[1:25:14] liars
[1:25:16] wow he couldn't do better than
[1:25:21] that
[1:25:25] bless God I wouldn't let my kids marry
[1:25:27] that
[1:25:30] family they put out the red
[1:25:39] ribbon and Jesus with the crowds of
[1:25:41] thousands follow me said that's too many
[1:25:44] look look sometimes strange things here
[1:25:47] and there's a few called yay many are
[1:25:49] called but few are chosen and we're
[1:25:51] going to deal with that that scripture
[1:25:52] later on probably in two weeks or
[1:25:55] something so then he said this great so
[1:25:58] then he seen this great congregation he
[1:26:00] said except you eat the Flesh of the son
[1:26:02] of man and drink my blood you have no
[1:26:04] life in me he never explained it he
[1:26:08] never explained it I wonder if he would
[1:26:09] say that in Wyoming I changed the
[1:26:13] Wyoming he put the name of the city
[1:26:15] where he put that
[1:26:17] in today no matter how popular he was
[1:26:21] and what do you think the doctor's
[1:26:23] thought and the fine culture people and
[1:26:25] the scientists would have
[1:26:28] said bless God we want to send our kids
[1:26:30] to
[1:26:32] University to get farther from
[1:26:35] God you don't think they're teaching
[1:26:37] that in
[1:26:38] America you better go to university
[1:26:44] then although I wish I could read better
[1:26:49] amen watch this he said said the man is
[1:26:53] a vampire well he wants you to drink his
[1:26:56] blood well what kind of what kind of
[1:26:59] going off on some tagin is this he's
[1:27:02] talking about Jesus by the way he's not
[1:27:05] talking about a minister that you're
[1:27:06] just not sure
[1:27:09] about he said Jesus never explained it
[1:27:12] and he wanted to shake those parasites
[1:27:15] off him that's right and they all got up
[1:27:17] and left and when he looked around those
[1:27:20] Apostles which were
[1:27:23] and those Apostles that which were was
[1:27:25] not ordained to life but he had chosen
[1:27:28] them and he was they wasn't ordained he
[1:27:32] said what will you do you say when you
[1:27:35] see the son of man ascending up into
[1:27:38] heaven from hence he come oh that was a
[1:27:46] choker he said and then those ministers
[1:27:49] said ascended up into heaven this man
[1:27:51] was born born right here in Galilee why
[1:27:54] I know he had an affair before his
[1:27:56] parents were married bless God I
[1:28:01] remember
[1:28:03] uhoh he was born in Galilee of Nazareth
[1:28:06] and he said I know his mother and all of
[1:28:08] his brothers and
[1:28:11] know the cradle that he was rocked in
[1:28:14] and seen his baby clothes and we speak
[1:28:16] to his mother and then he say and then
[1:28:19] say this man I come back from where he
[1:28:22] came
[1:28:23] from he said he come from Nazareth what
[1:28:26] does he say heaven he said Jesus never
[1:28:29] explained it he never defended
[1:28:35] himself too many parasites yet and they
[1:28:38] got up and they walked out on them no
[1:28:40] more and that's what the Bible said and
[1:28:43] then he turned and said now you also
[1:28:46] want to
[1:28:48] go to the 12 and remember watch this now
[1:28:52] I want I want you and I want you to
[1:28:55] catch this now this is in influence 64
[1:28:58] this is after the seals he said now
[1:29:02] remember the disciples couldn't explain
[1:29:05] it either they could not even explain
[1:29:08] why they said we'll
[1:29:14] stay
[1:29:16] wow they didn't know what was going
[1:29:20] on he said couldn't explain it and they
[1:29:23] didn't know it but they known he
[1:29:27] was he was just Supernatural it was a
[1:29:31] mystery you know you just can't put my I
[1:29:34] just can't get my finger down on
[1:29:39] this
[1:29:41] amen now now I I I want you I need to
[1:29:45] say this again I'm not promoting sin the
[1:29:47] prophet said this he said if if if
[1:29:50] you're if you're pastor
[1:29:52] stops preaching the word
[1:29:57] leave amen you
[1:30:01] leave
[1:30:03] but that that's in the
[1:30:07] Bible
[1:30:08] amen see it it's a mystery man and so so
[1:30:13] you know we don't we don't want uh okay
[1:30:16] watch this is our message
[1:30:19] different the Bible says we're A
[1:30:20] peculiar people
[1:30:22] not understood peculiar means not
[1:30:23] understood I don't know I don't know
[1:30:26] about
[1:30:27] them see if our message was the same why
[1:30:30] did we buy the
[1:30:31] church we could have chose a really nice
[1:30:34] one but see what it's it's
[1:30:37] election it's an it's an election I I
[1:30:40] it's just they didn't understand God's
[1:30:43] love because of
[1:30:45] election that that that scripture in
[1:30:48] Romans 30 8:30 is
[1:30:50] powerful in God's mind there's people in
[1:30:54] this community or in the connection of
[1:30:57] people sitting here that are living in
[1:30:59] flat out sin this should give you hope
[1:31:01] if you're a parent this morning amen
[1:31:03] your brothers and sisters and sons and
[1:31:04] daughters are living flat out out there
[1:31:08] and if they're elected and their names
[1:31:10] on the Lamb's Book of Life and you may
[1:31:12] not with your flesh eyes that are going
[1:31:14] to decay in the grave that are
[1:31:17] 98% water be able to see anything that's
[1:31:23] spiritual but if they're in
[1:31:26] there they'll be
[1:31:30] there
[1:31:32] amen it's just it's just a an omnipotent
[1:31:36] God and you know and so that'll just it
[1:31:39] just you say well I don't understand why
[1:31:41] this you know Rahab the story of
[1:31:44] Rahab is in Joshua 2 1-4 we're not you
[1:31:47] don't have to go there but I'm just
[1:31:49] giving you some scriptures now she was a
[1:31:51] flat out
[1:31:57] prostitute and she married she was the
[1:32:00] the third the fourth great grandma to
[1:32:05] David a man after God's Own Heart
[1:32:12] how none of us sitting here in the flesh
[1:32:14] would go along with
[1:32:17] that I
[1:32:19] wouldn't that's why I made mistake
[1:32:21] mistakes when people made a mistake in
[1:32:24] their life I judged them and killed
[1:32:30] them big mistakes I did
[1:32:38] it you see somebody I I'm not condoning
[1:32:42] it but we're
[1:32:45] humans you know like if you live in a
[1:32:48] glass house don't throw
[1:32:50] stones and people that are throwing
[1:32:52] stones at you are throwing stones at you
[1:32:54] because you have fruit on the tree and
[1:32:55] they want to eat
[1:32:56] it don't feel bad that you get Stones
[1:32:59] thrown at
[1:33:00] you but you
[1:33:02] know if if people went out and their
[1:33:05] families did
[1:33:07] something there strong judgment comes
[1:33:10] down because bless God we're
[1:33:14] holy what about
[1:33:17] God where was
[1:33:20] God I'll show you this his judgment
[1:33:23] wasn't
[1:33:24] there his judgment his judgment was this
[1:33:27] I would that the world would be
[1:33:30] saved brother Brown said this he said
[1:33:33] his blood on Calvary paid the sins of
[1:33:38] the world and watch this he said he
[1:33:41] would have that all would have been
[1:33:43] there this this is a quote I'm by my
[1:33:47] memory and he said if you go to hell
[1:33:50] this morning
[1:33:52] you're going to go buy all Road close
[1:33:54] signs that you can think
[1:33:56] of you're going to
[1:33:59] fight
[1:34:03] hard to get there
[1:34:07] so but we shouldn't be a part of that
[1:34:10] you know what I'm saying so in my
[1:34:13] younger years when I
[1:34:19] was I don't like remembering
[1:34:22] and something would come up in a church
[1:34:25] in a
[1:34:26] family and whoa everybody

[1:34:34] panthers that's
[1:34:37] wrong now I I'm I'm I'm I'm literally
[1:34:40] holding back from saying stuff because I
[1:34:42] I don't want it to sound like you can go
[1:34:44] out and do that and God will still have
[1:34:45] Grace on you you see what I mean but you
[1:34:48] you know what I'm
[1:34:50] saying

[1:36:34] it and the Book of the generations of
[1:36:37] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[1:36:40] Abraham and Abraham begot Isaac and

[1:37:18] and he begat Solomon and she had and
[1:37:22] she there's another stumbler for me I
[1:37:26] just struggling with that
[1:37:27] one How could a
[1:37:32] David premeditate first-degree
[1:37:36] murder and commit
[1:37:39] adultery I I need some help here I'm
[1:37:43] struggling but we are in the
[1:37:48] Bible and God chooses the king of a
[1:37:52] murderer and adultery now listen I want
[1:37:54] to show you something here I am
[1:37:57] uas M and dead David come on help me out
[1:38:02] Matt you know I'm r as M and dead I'm
[1:38:05] leaving the

[1:38:10] no-brainer let's just think this
[1:38:13] through I I don't need a lot of
[1:38:17] degrees you just messed up my whole
[1:38:20] family I
[1:38:22] mean for
[1:38:25] good here here just to tell you how bad
[1:38:28] it was this this dude that David killed
[1:38:31] uas he wasn't even Jew by nature and he
[1:38:35] loved David better than his Jews and see
[1:38:39] the David when he was anointed king when
[1:38:42] he was anointed king and so was the King
[1:38:44] David's inner tight Circle men they seen
[1:38:47] the power of God on David and they
[1:38:50] weren't even Jews the Jew were still
[1:38:51] worshiping sa bless God H he's the one
[1:38:54] with the annoying know s he's tall bless
[1:38:59] God David was running for his life you
[1:39:02] know the people that went down to the
[1:39:03] well to get David the water of The Well
[1:39:04] of Bethlehem they weren't Jews those
[1:39:07] people didn't believe in
[1:39:09] them no no bless God I wouldn't go to
[1:39:11] that camp meeting bless God because
[1:39:13] we're just going to the camp meeting of
[1:39:16] sa and that man gave his life
[1:39:21] yes because he loved David and David
[1:39:24] kicked him in the
[1:39:25] teeth you don't think he kicked him in
[1:39:27] the tee try taking somebody's
[1:39:31] wife the Bible
[1:39:33] says that if you were to take a
[1:39:35] brother's wife that you would never be
[1:39:39] forgiven from the
[1:39:42] brother so what chance does theise his
[1:39:45] family have they got Bible backing them
[1:39:47] up bless God I don't have to forgive
[1:39:50] David

[1:49:18] begat Joseph the husband of Mary whom
[1:49:21] born Jesus called the
[1:49:23] Christ I believe there was at least two
[1:49:26] prostitutes and Jesus
[1:49:31] lineage
[1:49:34] why
[1:49:36] why it was because God was trying to
[1:49:40] show us in our day that we're going to
[1:49:43] go to church and fellowship with elected
[1:49:46] predestinated
[1:49:47] Believers that we're not going to
[1:49:49] understand

[1:49:56] marriage maybe they'll be a
[1:50:00] prostitute maybe am I condoning
[1:50:04] that
[1:50:07] maybe
[1:50:12] maybe how in the
[1:50:14] world did God take David in an
[1:50:18] adulterous situation and make Solomon

[1:51:18] Canada you couldn't figure out
[1:51:20] cuz he's
[1:51:23] omnipotent
[1:51:26] amen now see everybody see you know the
[1:51:30] the the church world is preaching
[1:51:37] fear if you're a Catholic and you leave

[1:51:55] times they went 10 times in their whole
[1:51:56] 20-year
[1:51:58] life and I'll bet you you can't name one
[1:52:02] that when they get married they say
[1:52:03] their kids are going to be Catholic
[1:52:05] don't matter if they marry a Baptist
[1:52:07] Pentecostal Nazarene independent up
[1:52:11] dependent it is so tude on their
[1:52:16] brain that they could have less Catholic
[1:52:19] than that in
[1:52:21] them and they could
[1:52:23] marry a Pentecostal Holy Roller and
[1:52:27] they'll still say at that
[1:52:29] wedding our kids are going to be
[1:52:31] Catholic bless God the priest is going
[1:52:34] to sprinkle
[1:52:40] them they believe in more election than

[1:55:59] prophets are we promot nerdity of course
[1:56:02] not but we're we're we're promoting
[1:56:06] election did Saul make mistakes yeah God
[1:56:09] the Bible said he actually took his
[1:56:11] Spirit off of
[1:56:14] him and we know we gave them up to
[1:56:16] torments of
[1:56:18] demons how could the prophet

[1:56:40] God and you you're thinking you're going
[1:56:43] to put God in this box even this is our
[1:56:47] absolute it's our absolute if this was
[1:56:49] brother Brown's absolute brother Brown
[1:56:53] said at least 30 sometimes if not in the
[1:56:56] 40s he says he he would get ready to
[1:56:58] pray and he said now we're going to open
[1:57:00] the word of God and he said now his
[1:57:02] words will never fail and my words will
[1:57:04] fail or or my words could fail or they
[1:57:06] will fail or might fail but this word
[1:57:08] will not
[1:57:09] fail but what do we and and I'm not in a
[1:57:13] stail but see we have to look into this
[1:57:15] in a mystery God wrote it that the wise
[1:57:18] and the prudent wouldn't understand it
[1:57:20] and he revealed it onto such as babes
[1:57:22] that would be such as to
[1:57:25] learn you remember when we talked about
[1:57:27] and we were mentioning this to John and
[1:57:28] L when we witnessed the people that have
[1:57:31] been in the church their dad was a
[1:57:33] preacher preaching what three different
[1:57:36] churches I think honey M he his life was
[1:57:39] a
[1:57:41] preacher and they had never in their
[1:57:44] life ever heard of
[1:57:47] predestination ever
[1:57:50] their dad had preached 50 years in the
[1:57:52] church died
[1:57:54] preaching and they're 60 years old now
[1:57:57] themselves that's a fair bit of time
[1:57:58] that's a 100
[1:57:59] years they didn't understand
[1:58:02] election they had actually never even
[1:58:04] heard tell of it before you should read
[1:58:07] Ephesians
[1:58:10] 1 be impossible for it to be lost I mean
[1:58:14] it's everywhere what did these people
[1:58:17] preach fear
[1:58:19] fear fear fear you know fear and and and
[1:58:25] now we we need respect like we should
[1:58:27] you know but over top of everything
[1:58:31] else is
[1:58:34] election if it's elected that God's
[1:58:36] going to come and bless us this morning
[1:58:39] you watch this I and I believe in in in
[1:58:41] dignity and respects and Holiness and
[1:58:44] and church order and all these things
[1:58:46] but if it's election that God's going to
[1:58:47] come and knock the walls out and you are
[1:58:49] going to start screaming and the town of
[1:58:50] Wyoming will report that we're norship
[1:58:52] worshippers it won't matter if a hundred
[1:58:55] kids run through this place and
[1:58:57] scream because it's
[1:58:59] election it's election it's election
[1:59:02] it's election we do the mechanics and
[1:59:05] that's all we can do but the election is
[1:59:07] the
[1:59:08] Dynamics the Dynamics and we I believe
[1:59:11] in having the mechanics right but that's
[1:59:13] all we can do but we're just fail
[1:59:16] brother Dale sorry brother Dale is just
[1:59:18] a failure
[1:59:19] and I you know I'm
[1:59:21] just so I might mess up on my mechanics
[1:59:25] that don't affect God one
[1:59:30] ioda I want
[1:59:38] ioda

[2:00:06] the Bible types the whole Bible there 66
[2:00:10] book chapters in Isaiah 66 books in the
[2:00:12] Bible and if you read Isaiah it's like
[2:00:14] the beginning from Genesis to
[2:00:17] Revelation man that's that's a good
[2:00:19] backbone
[2:00:26] profet

[2:01:02] loins and put off thy shoes from thy
[2:01:05] feet and he did so and he walked naked
[2:01:08] and
[2:01:09] Barefoot and the Lord said like as I
[2:01:13] servant Isaiah has walked naked and
[2:01:15] Barefoot three years three years that's
[2:01:18] half the time we've been in this church
[2:01:21] three years for the sight and wonder

[2:03:36] himself it's not what I said next
[2:03:39] paragraph 202 he said I don't think
[2:03:41] Jesus Oh I like I like brother Brandon
[2:03:46] he said I don't think Jesus dressed like
[2:03:48] a clergyman
[2:03:49] bless
[2:03:53] God he dressed like an ordinary man and
[2:03:57] he went in or among men and he wasn't
[2:04:01] nothing and it wasn't nothing dressy

[2:04:40] message looking away to Jesus after this
[2:04:44] seals overhauls in
[2:04:47] Africa behind behind the
[2:04:49] pulpit 600 people
[2:04:53] there I don't think
[2:05:00] so he
[2:05:02] said it's just the idea a men and it
[2:05:05] doesn't How about if this man or I
[2:05:09] wonder what a doctor would think of this
[2:05:12] and when a prophet in the Bible was
[2:05:15] commanded commanded obedience is better
[2:05:18] than sacrifice
[2:05:20] what are we going to do with the
[2:05:21] scripture where it says have modest
[2:05:26] apparel well that kind of messes that
[2:05:28] one
[2:05:31] up oh I believe in it I I believe you're
[2:05:35] lost if you don't have it but what are
[2:05:37] we going to do with that one how are we
[2:05:39] going to how are we going to work this
[2:05:41] out Saul's in heaven and he laid nude
[2:05:45] with the ministers the
[2:05:47] prophets and God didn't tell him to do
[2:05:49] it I couldn't find that quote believe me
[2:05:51] I turned them search upside
[2:05:55] down but here we seeing
[2:05:58] Isaiah brother bam says he was command
[2:06:01] now this is like this is full Revelation
[2:06:03] in his ministry this ain't in 45 this is
[2:06:06] in
[2:06:07] 65 commanded to strip off all his
[2:06:09] clothes and walk naked before the people
[2:06:12] and he really would have been crazy
[2:06:13] wouldn't have he now but
[2:06:17] look God
[2:06:19] God told
[2:06:21] him to do
[2:06:26] it you know I'm going to stop
[2:06:31] there help us
[2:06:35] Jesus
[2:06:37] God told
[2:06:39] him to do
[2:06:43] it I'm going to shock you maybe maybe it
[2:06:45] won't shock you I don't understand all
[2:06:47] of that that I just
[2:06:50] preached I don't understand it
[2:06:52] all I hope that don't scare
[2:06:56] you but I know it's
[2:06:58] Bible and I know our Prophet talked
[2:07:00] about it and I know our Prophet wasn't a
[2:07:03] crazy
[2:07:05] man and I know in a lot of what we
[2:07:11] believe was just man's
[2:07:17] ideas
[2:07:23] was just man's
[2:07:25] ideas was just brother Dale's
[2:07:31] ideas and that's all the value they have
[2:07:34] to them is just my
[2:07:37] ideas if you'll allow me I'd just like
[2:07:39] to give you one more quote you
[2:07:43] see God is
[2:07:47] God
[2:07:49] and
[2:07:52] and and with your baptism of the Holy
[2:07:56] Ghost oil and water don't
[2:07:58] mix and you will
[2:08:01] know I I I don't I can't explain it it's
[2:08:05] like the seventh seal you will know if
[2:08:09] it's
[2:08:10] God this morning this and and and I love
[2:08:14] you but you God will reveal to you
[2:08:19] is my pastor
[2:08:24] cuckoo am I trying to lead you down a
[2:08:26] path
[2:08:30] false or is it a
[2:08:34] mystery I know in my young years I hurt
[2:08:39] people what appeared to be
[2:08:42] mistakes and maybe those mistakes turned
[2:08:45] out to be blessings but those people
[2:08:47] aren't around in
[2:08:50] anymore because they weren't
[2:08:55] welcome at
[2:09:02] all and I have to live with that you can
[2:09:06] say sorry all you
[2:09:10] want but if you kill somebody's
[2:09:13] character and you can come back to me
[2:09:16] and the family and and and
[2:09:19] or I could come to your family and I
[2:09:22] could come back to your family there's
[2:09:23] things brother M I can't
[2:09:26] repair it's like going down the road
[2:09:28] with feathers in a
[2:09:30] p and they're all over the
[2:09:34] place and I can go back and I can bring
[2:09:36] you the pillowcase brother
[2:09:37] Matt I can tell you I was a real bad
[2:09:41] boy but I can't find all those
[2:09:45] feathers it's not possible
[2:09:51] I can't find all the
[2:09:58] feathers who's going to be over there
[2:10:00] and
[2:10:06] say look at you when we get to the
[2:10:12] throne so I got scars deep
[2:10:16] scars prophet said I'm
[2:10:19] all CAU
[2:10:21] up I'm
[2:10:27] wounded they all
[2:10:29] came from
[2:10:32] believers they all came from
[2:10:34] Believers and at
[2:10:38] my at least half of my
[2:10:40] life I was the one doing
[2:10:46] it I had no inent sharing
[2:10:51] this but yesterday I put in my thing and
[2:10:55] I it's I should be doing this three
[2:10:57] weeks from now and if God tells me to do
[2:10:59] it again I'll do it again but that's
[2:11:01] like the prophet when he had preached
[2:11:04] and he preached for I think it was
[2:11:06] brother
[2:11:06] Baxter and he hadn't ate much and he'd
[2:11:10] been going to a minight restaurant or
[2:11:14] kind of
[2:11:15] a says something like that and they were
[2:11:18] closed on
[2:11:22] Sunday and so he had to go the one
[2:11:24] across the
[2:11:27] road and it was a booly boogly Wiggly
[2:11:31] one I know you've all heard the story
[2:11:34] slots you need to go back and reread
[2:11:37] that he said I walked in there said
[2:11:40] there was a 65y old woman that it used
[2:11:44] to have been a Sunday school teacher he
[2:11:45] found up later the old policeman had put
[2:11:49] his arms around her it's all right we
[2:11:50] love you Joseph brother love you with
[2:11:53] all of our hearts sister Myra see you
[2:11:55] Friday night all night party man and he
[2:12:00] seen young girls 18 wanted love needed a
[2:12:06] daddy's
[2:12:07] love and the boys he says it like this
[2:12:11] he says they were doing things that were
[2:12:14] improper they were only
[2:12:17] humans
[2:12:21] that's why the prophet said that you
[2:12:23] should always pray that your girls would
[2:12:25] marry young so they'd be kept pure for
[2:12:28] their husband and they wouldn't just
[2:12:31] hurt
[2:12:32] thems in unique
[2:12:35] situations like this I know you don't
[2:12:37] agree with me but that's what our
[2:12:38] Prophet
[2:12:39] said you know when the prophet I'm
[2:12:42] saying things to to jar us to wonder
[2:12:45] where we're at are are we Hypocrites you
[2:12:47] know the Prophet when he married the
[2:12:48] young couple with the gold doorknobs and
[2:12:50] he went back to see the people that went
[2:12:52] in the Box Car he said I'd rather be in
[2:12:54] the Box Car do you know I was sharing
[2:12:56] this with people I said you know people
[2:12:58] say well you know you can't marry my
[2:13:00] daughter until you're able to provide
[2:13:01] for her now one time did the prophet ask
[2:13:03] him if he had any
[2:13:05] provision at one time never had one
[2:13:08] penny I wouldn't give you my
[2:13:12] daughter then you don't believe the
[2:13:16] message you know what the prophet asked
[2:13:18] those young couple he asked the the man
[2:13:21] he said will you work to provide for her
[2:13:23] doing anything he said I'll work my
[2:13:26] fingers to the Bone but he had nothing
[2:13:29] he he did ask you have a place to take
[2:13:31] her he had a box
[2:13:33] car then he looked at the girl and he
[2:13:35] said if it becomes really hard will you
[2:13:38] leave him and go back to
[2:13:41] Mama that was the extension of the
[2:13:43] questions and he said I would go in that
[2:13:45] marriage before the gold door knobs
[2:13:49] and he had those feelings of this
[2:13:52] setting and brother Brandon coming right
[2:13:55] from up from underneath anointing and
[2:13:57] you know the anointing was something
[2:13:59] we've you know powerful is what I'm
[2:14:03] saying and and it was just so different
[2:14:06] than him being behind the pulpit and
[2:14:07] seeing God
[2:14:09] move like he
[2:14:12] did and it was just it just
[2:14:15] was like it wasn't even it was just
[2:14:20] and he said
[2:14:22] God why don't you just blow this place
[2:14:27] up I just don't don't lose me just just
[2:14:30] hang with
[2:14:31] me that's what they
[2:14:35] deserved by looking at it with brother
[2:14:38] Dale's religious
[2:14:41] eyes and he said a vision broke and he
[2:14:44] said I stepped back in the dark corner
[2:14:45] and nobody was paying attention to me
[2:14:47] because they were all consumed with the
[2:14:51] women and he said God showed them the
[2:14:55] blood around the
[2:14:59] earth and that was one part and then he
[2:15:01] said he showed them the thorns in his
[2:15:03] head and all these you know and the
[2:15:06] crucifixion and then he seen them
[2:15:14] jerking he said what that God
[2:15:19] he said that's you brother
[2:15:21] Dale he said that's when you had those
[2:15:24] thoughts about those those thoughts they
[2:15:25] weren't even sin said when you had those
[2:15:28] thoughts about those girls doing
[2:15:36] sin were brother braham's thoughts wrong
[2:15:43] nope and I promise I'll close with this
[2:15:47] and he said I forgive them and you
[2:15:51] don't let's
[2:16:09] stand
[2:16:11] hallelujah it's hard to understand a
[2:16:15] omnipotent God
[2:16:18] in
[2:16:20] predestination it's just really
[2:16:22] hard really really hard we're just made
[2:16:25] that if we see black we see black if we
[2:16:28] see white we see white if we see wrong
[2:16:30] or we see Injustice or we just we're
[2:16:34] just we're it's all right I'm Still
[2:16:36] Human our Prophet we're just built like
[2:16:39] that but God's not built like
[2:16:42] that God's not built like
[2:16:46] that
[2:16:54] wow wow
[2:16:56] wow amen he gave that that's why I I
[2:17:01] sister Ruth broke saying that song I
[2:17:04] broke and all of that he gave he chose
[2:17:07] to give you his
[2:17:12] love but what are you going to do with
[2:17:14] it are you going to pass it
[2:17:16] on or are we going to do bad things with
[2:17:20] it are we going to do bad things with
[2:17:23] it and no way I I I clarify it again in
[2:17:26] no way am I promoting sin in no way am I
[2:17:29] promoting these things that happen I you
[2:17:32] know you know that I I
[2:17:34] don't but how do we answer
[2:17:43] those
[2:17:45] amen I I believe
[2:17:49] and just a little tiny Speck of
[2:17:52] understanding I got I'm going to try and
[2:17:54] let God be
[2:17:56] God and I'll just say Brother
