[25:43] Hallelujah. Lord God, we love you this
[25:46] morning. Lord, we thank you for your
[25:48] presence in our hearts and also in this
[25:51] place. Lord, I pray your blessing on all
[25:55] that have been able to come this morning
[25:58] and those that are sick. Be with them,
[26:00] Lord God, home for different reasons,
[26:02] Lord God. Bless and meet the needs of
[26:05] your bride around the world, Lord God.
[26:08] And Lord, as you open your word, Lord,
[26:10] we pray that you will feed your bride
[26:13] the mana from heaven, Lord God, today.
[26:16] And Lord, may the bride have an appetite
[26:19] for the heavenly mana. And may we not
[26:22] look back at the leaks and the garlics
[26:24] of the world of Egypt and say, "Oh, I
[26:27] sure miss that." But may we long and
[26:30] love the heavenly mana that God give us.
[26:35] We praise you for it in your beautiful
[26:37] name, Lord
[26:38] Jesus. Name. Amen.
[26:43] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you all.
[26:45] It's good to be here. Amen. Very good to
[26:49] be here. different ones out. It's a
[26:50] holiday
[26:52] weekend. We're going to just look right
[26:54] in our scriptures to
[26:58] uh John
[27:01] 5:39. One verse and you may have your
[27:03] seats.
[27:04] Just God bless you
[27:08] abundantly. Covet your prayers this
[27:10] morning. Just uh
[27:14] [Music]
[27:20] John 5:39. And after you're seated,
[27:24] we'll read another scripture. Search the
[27:27] scriptures, for in them ye think ye have
[27:30] eternal
[27:32] life, and it's they that are, and they
[27:36] are they which
[27:39] testify of me. Search the scriptures,
[27:43] for in them you think you have eternal
[27:46] life, but they are they that testify of
[27:49] me. Lord God, I pray you'll bless your
[27:51] word this morning. Bless your people and
[27:54] may your will be done and everything
[27:56] that's done and said. In your name we
[27:58] pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your
[28:01] script your seats. We're going to look
[28:02] over in Philippians
[28:06] 4. Philippians 4:11.
[28:12] to
[28:14] 13. Philippians 4:11. Not that I speak
[28:18] with respects of want, for I have
[28:20] learned in whatsoever state I am,
[28:23] therewith to be content. For I know both
[28:26] how to be abased, and I know how to
[28:28] abound. And everywhere in all things I
[28:32] am instructed both to be full and to be
[28:35] hungry, and both to abound and to suffer
[28:38] need. Verse 13. And I can do all
[28:41] things through
[28:43] Christ that strengthens me. We praise
[28:47] God for that word this morning from the
[28:51] scriptures. We can do all things through
[28:53] Christ that strengthens us. You know, we
[28:56] we started a topic on Wednesday night
[28:59] and and uh we're going to just continue
[29:02] that. Lord willing, we might kind of
[29:05] finish our service on the Wednesday
[29:06] night service. uh excuse me if if God be
[29:10] willing but we want to look at a thought
[29:12] that it is it is always been and always
[29:16] will be it's human nature that people
[29:18] always want to be somewhere they are
[29:22] not you always want to be in a different
[29:26] age than what you are a different time
[29:29] you know brother Bram said that many
[29:30] people said I would have loved to have
[29:32] lived when Jesus was on the earth I
[29:34] would have lived differently I would
[29:36] have never missed Jesus
[29:37] said, "If you miss them today, you would
[29:39] have missed them then." Amen. You always
[29:42] want like the the the modern day thing
[29:45] is it's always greener on the other side
[29:47] of the fence. Brother Dale deals with
[29:50] that a lot in our situation of the
[29:52] countries. I think there's got to be a
[29:55] good place to live in this world.
[29:58] But this world is all controlled to
[30:00] Satan. Amen. That's right. And so we
[30:03] would desire to live in a different age,
[30:04] a different time, but God placed us by
[30:08] his omnipotent choice. He placed us
[30:11] right where we were supposed to be. Not
[30:14] just where we were supposed to be, but
[30:15] the place we were supposed to be. You
[30:17] know, you can just look at this in many
[30:19] ways just to to to stretch your
[30:21] thinking. You know, people that are
[30:22] single, you know, me and Lan many a
[30:25] while ago, we were listening to uh music
[30:27] coming in and and that song was talking
[30:29] about it. I actually got a copy of it,
[30:31] but uh you know was talking about the
[30:33] single people want to be married. And
[30:35] the mega married people that are in a
[30:36] bad relationship, they want to be
[30:37] single. And the married people that
[30:39] don't have kids, they want a whole big
[30:41] family. Then they get the kids and say,
[30:42] "Glory, hallelujah. I can't wait till
[30:44] they move out."
[30:47] Amen. You get a job, you don't like your
[30:49] boss, you wish you were unemployed.
[30:53] You're young. You listen to your kids. I
[30:55] can't wait till I turn 16. I can drive.
[30:58] can't wait till you're 26 and you wish
[31:00] you could be 16.
[31:02] And when you get to 56, you'll wish you
[31:04] were 16.
[31:08] You always want to be somewhere
[31:09] different. Amen. And so that what the
[31:12] natural is is always in the spiritual.
[31:14] But God God, you know, God is all the
[31:17] things that he wants us to be. If you're
[31:19] single this morning, he's your husband
[31:21] or wife. If you're if you're in mourning
[31:23] this morning, he's your comforter. And
[31:25] if you're jobless, he's he's your
[31:27] provider. And and you know, if you're
[31:29] tired this morning, he is your rest and
[31:32] he's your comfort. And we're going to
[31:33] read some scriptures. He is everything
[31:35] that you are in need of. And we
[31:37] shouldn't live our life wishing I was
[31:39] somewhere else. You know, brother Bram
[31:41] said about the church. He said, you
[31:43] know, you wish that you could find a
[31:44] perfect church. And he said, as soon as
[31:46] I got there, it wouldn't be perfect. You
[31:49] want wish the big church and you get to
[31:51] a big church and nobody would recognize
[31:53] you. You get in a small church, you
[31:54] know, all the problems and you wish you
[31:56] were somewhere else. You see, that's
[31:58] just where we live in.
[32:01] Amen. God help
[32:04] us. God help us not to be this way. He
[32:06] said, you know, this looking at some
[32:09] quotes here. I'm going to skip my first
[32:11] quote. I think uh well, my first quote
[32:13] talks about, you know, God God's army
[32:16] and God's fortress was his ministry. And
[32:20] he said, what was God doing it? He
[32:21] formed it through his prophets,
[32:23] apostles, teachers, and and pastors.
[32:25] Amen. And it was foreseeing the truth
[32:30] before it was foreseeing what was going
[32:32] to happen before Satan could affect it.
[32:35] Amen. And so God dressed up in his
[32:38] church in the
[32:40] ministry. He's always the same. And if
[32:42] the ministry ever denies the
[32:46] truth, then run for your life.
[32:50] And I'll tell you what, most of the time
[32:53] ministry denies the truth because
[32:55] there's popular people in the sky.
[32:57] Brother Brown talked about this. He
[32:59] would not preach the truth because
[33:01] you're the biggest tithe payer
[33:05] or I'm afraid of people leaving.
[33:08] Brother Bram said,
[33:09] "Okay, he said, I'd rather drink, eat
[33:12] branch water, whatever."
[33:17] Amen. God help us. But as humans, we
[33:21] deal with that because brother Brandham
[33:23] didn't want to make enemies. But brother
[33:24] Brandham made enemies all the time
[33:27] because people didn't like his doctrine.
[33:29] Amen. He didn't like the truth. Amen. So
[33:31] we look at this just going our next
[33:33] thing here. He said, you know, uh frogs,
[33:36] people are like frogs. It was frogs is a
[33:38] type of an unclean spirit and frogs is
[33:41] also the type of a trinity doctrine of
[33:44] truth. But frogs always are looking
[33:46] behind them. It was always better in
[33:48] another time, another day. Amen. It was
[33:51] always something better. And and I'm
[33:53] going to go through what we didn't do
[33:54] Wednesdays. I'm going to go through
[33:56] multiple examples in the Bible where
[33:58] where the people that we respect and and
[34:01] uh recognize always thought it was
[34:04] better in the past. And here here and
[34:07] just once more, Lord, man's always
[34:09] thinking back to what God did or looking
[34:11] forward to what he's doing, but they're
[34:13] ignoring and missing what he's doing
[34:14] today.
[34:17] Amen. God help us. Human beings are
[34:19] always telling what God did do and they
[34:22] believe what he's going to do, but
[34:23] they're forgetting what he's doing right
[34:26] now. You don't recognize what he's doing
[34:27] today. It's very, very, very seldom and
[34:29] very difficult to
[34:31] recognize what he's doing
[34:33] today. And so was it always been that
[34:36] way. We see here in Exodus 37 and 8 that
[34:41] the Lord came to Moses and he said,
[34:43] "I've seen the afflictions of my people
[34:45] that are in Egypt and I have now watch
[34:47] this. This is personal now." And the
[34:50] Lord said, "And I've heard their
[34:53] cry." Now, that meant it put it right on
[34:56] the people that the people were praying
[34:58] for God to deliver
[35:00] them. I've heard their cries and their
[35:03] sorrows and you know the scripture. And
[35:05] he said, "I'll bring them out with a
[35:06] mighty hand into a land flown with milk
[35:08] and honey." And you and I I don't want
[35:11] you to to uh lock in. You say, "Well,
[35:13] Israel, they were just hard-headed
[35:14] people." Because we're going to look at
[35:16] people that wasn't Israel. And if you
[35:18] just drop down to Exodus 14, they had it
[35:22] no more and been delivered and their
[35:24] position changed
[35:26] completely. In Exodus 14:11, "And they
[35:29] said unto Moses, because there was no
[35:31] graves in Egypt, you took us out into
[35:33] the wilderness to
[35:37] die." It's a good thing I'm not God
[35:39] because I would have signed off that
[35:40] people about right
[35:42] there. These were the people that had
[35:44] been begging God and crying for over 400
[35:47] years for God to change their situation.
[35:50] God change their situation and give them
[35:52] somebody that would tell them the truth.
[35:54] And they say, "I don't want that.
[35:59] I don't want the truth. Most people
[36:01] don't want the truth this morning.
[36:03] You know, a very famous man, I forget
[36:05] his name there, but he said, "Anybody
[36:07] that tells the
[36:09] truth always tells the truth." Well, is
[36:12] always hated
[36:14] because there's always part of the truth
[36:16] that's not popular. Yeah. You know, I
[36:19] remember when I was young and and this
[36:21] is off my notes completely and you won't
[36:24] understand this, but I was remember when
[36:25] I was young and and still am good
[36:27] friends with a baked cattle producer
[36:30] Tim's uh auction and and he had a man
[36:33] that bought cattle for him three days a
[36:34] week. And you know, I knew many many I
[36:37] knew hund hundreds of men that he was
[36:39] good friends with. And I I personally
[36:42] point blank asked Tommy. I said, "Why
[36:45] why you got that man buying cattle for
[36:47] you?" He would spend a million dollars
[36:50] of Tommy's money a week. Tommy said, "He
[36:52] will tell me the complete and only
[36:54] truth, no matter if I want to kill him
[36:57] or not. You'll tell me nothing but the
[37:00] truth. So help him. Period."
[37:04] And he gave him his checkbook. Yeah. To
[37:06] do whatever he wanted to. He'd say, "I
[37:08] bought those cows and I shouldn't have
[37:10] or they broke their leg on the way out
[37:11] the gate or you know they were a bad
[37:13] guy. I realized they made just
[37:15] completely he wouldn't sugarcoat it."
[37:17] But we're living it. You know, Brother
[37:18] Bam said that God was looking for
[37:20] separators, but people are looking for
[37:21] people that are sugarcoat and
[37:23] everything. They're looking for blender
[37:25] machines.
[37:27] Amen. And God help us to recognize what
[37:30] this
[37:31] is here. Here you know we go down in
[37:34] this same scripture in Israel in verse
[37:36] 12 and it said let us alone that we may
[37:38] serve the Egyptians. You know that for
[37:41] 420 years they were begging God that
[37:44] they could get out of Egypt and their
[37:46] task
[37:48] maskers and just within a few
[37:51] days they were saying to God's servant I
[37:55] wish we were back there. Here we look in
[37:57] Exodus 16 also. Exodus 16:3. And the
[38:00] children of Israel said unto them, they
[38:02] said, "I would to God that we would have
[38:04] died at the hands of the Lord in the
[38:06] land of
[38:07] Egypt." Would to God he wouldn't have
[38:10] showed us the truth. Would to God he
[38:11] wouldn't have showed us the message.
[38:13] Would to God he wouldn't have given the
[38:14] five-fold ministry. Would to God I would
[38:17] have just died there.
[38:21] Jesus.
[38:22] You dislike the truth that bit. Look at
[38:26] 1st Samuel 8 79. We're just from
[38:29] different scriptures here and and maybe
[38:32] I'll slow down and go through this a
[38:33] little bit here. You would know the
[38:34] story. Israel wanted a king. So now
[38:36] they're out of Egypt. And God knew what
[38:39] they needed. A
[38:42] prophet. You said, "But I don't like
[38:44] that." See, we don't like We never like
[38:47] where we're at. I'm getting old. I wish
[38:50] I was young. When I was young, I wish I
[38:52] was old.
[38:55] And the Lord unto Sam, he said unto
[38:57] Samuel, verse uh
[39:00] 7, hearken unto the voice of the people
[39:03] what they say unto you, for they have
[39:05] not rejected thee, but they have
[39:07] rejected me that I shall not reign over
[39:11] them. See, you know, the Bible says that
[39:13] the footsteps of the righteous are
[39:15] ordered of the Lord. Amen. I told that
[39:18] story about us waiting for the traffic.
[39:20] If you would have been uh you know uh if
[39:23] we would have really been our normal
[39:24] life, we would have pulled out in front
[39:26] of that semi and we would have been
[39:28] smashed by the other semi that was doing
[39:30] the farm work literally within 2
[39:32] minutes. Literally within 2 minutes, but
[39:35] God's guarding angels is over and we
[39:37] blasphemed God because we don't like
[39:39] that we had a flat tire. Your car didn't
[39:41] start. You've all heard the story where
[39:43] where the man came to God and and he was
[39:45] really upset with God. He said, you
[39:47] know, God, I went out and my car
[39:48] wouldn't start. And he said, and you
[39:50] know, he was telling God, I'm going to
[39:52] quit serving you. And then he said, I
[39:54] went to work and there was a long line
[39:56] up at the Tim Hortons. And you know, I
[39:58] did this and I did that. And God came
[40:00] out. He said, well, I didn't start your
[40:01] car because there was an accident out
[40:03] the road. I made a long line at Tim
[40:05] Hortons cuz the person was sick at Tim
[40:07] Horns and had coughed on your food, so
[40:09] your food got rejected. And on and on
[40:11] and on and on and on. And he gets to the
[40:13] end of the poem, the guy says, "Oh,
[40:17] God. Amen.
[40:29] And so God said here in in the ninth
[40:31] verse, he said, you know, give them a
[40:35] king, but I want you to protest
[40:38] solemnly, solemnly to them and let them
[40:42] know. And they said, so in verse 9, you
[40:44] know, and I'm not really reading these
[40:46] verses, but the the prophet came to them
[40:48] and he came in verse 11, the king said,
[40:51] he said, "Now, when God was reigning
[40:53] over you with true ministry, in verse
[40:56] 11, he said, did he take your
[41:00] sons?" And you can read all those things
[41:03] that he would have did with the sons.
[41:04] It's a lot. He said he would appoint
[41:06] them for himself as chariots and his
[41:08] horsemen and some to run before his
[41:10] chariots. And he would appoint them
[41:11] captains over thousands, captains over
[41:13] 50s, and set them on the ground to reap
[41:15] the harvest and make them instruments of
[41:17] war and instruments of chariots. Verse
[41:20] 13, he said, "And he'll take your
[41:23] daughters." See, Satan will take
[41:25] everything you got if you're out of the
[41:27] will of
[41:28] God. But you're in the will of God,
[41:30] you're not
[41:31] happy. That's it's a wonder. God, I
[41:34] mean, he's got to have amazing love.
[41:37] Verse 14, he said he'll take your fields
[41:41] and your vineyards and your olives and
[41:43] all the best of them and he'll give them
[41:45] to somebody else who didn't work for
[41:48] him.
[41:52] Verse 15, he said, "And he'll take a
[41:54] tenth of your seeds and your vineyards
[41:57] and your officers." Verse 16, "And he'll
[41:59] take your man's servants and your maid
[42:02] servants." Verse 17, "And he'll take a
[42:04] tenth of your sheep and all your
[42:06] livestock.
[42:09] It said verse 18, "And ye will cry out
[42:11] in that day because you didn't like
[42:14] where God had you, but you're going to
[42:16] like it a lot worse where you're
[42:18] headed."
[42:24] For ye shall have chosen me, but the
[42:26] Lord, you would not hear you in that
[42:30] day." And nevertheless, the people
[42:32] refused to obey here. Here, here God was
[42:36] was politely showing the people, "We'll
[42:38] give you what you want, but you're going
[42:41] to have great
[42:43] regrets." Amen. 1 Samuel 12, we can just
[42:47] move down in this
[42:51] story. And Samuel says, "I've hearkened
[42:53] unto your
[42:55] voice and gave you a king." And verse
[42:58] three, and behold, I am a witness
[43:00] against me before the Lord and before
[43:02] the anointed, that these ox have I have
[43:06] have I taken, or these ass have I taken,
[43:10] or whom have I have defrauded? Here's
[43:12] here's Samuel asking the people, has has
[43:15] God's plan been that bad for
[43:19] you? Has been the truth been that bad
[43:22] for you? Whom have I defrauded? Who have
[43:25] I taken? Whom have I oppressed? and whom
[43:28] at the hand have I received any bribes
[43:31] or or blinded my eyes
[43:33] therewith and I will restore unto you.
[43:36] And the people said, "Well, no, God's
[43:38] way was perfect. God didn't defraud us
[43:42] any." And here the prophet comes back to
[43:44] him. He said, "And the Lord is your
[43:46] witness against
[43:47] you, and his anointed is a witness this
[43:51] day." That God knew what was perfect for
[43:54] you. God knew where to place you
[43:57] perfectly. God knew who to put over you
[44:01] perfectly and they've always rejected
[44:03] it.
[44:07] God help
[44:09] us. God help us. We see here in John 8
[44:14] 33 here the the Jews loved works. And
[44:21] here Jesus had come to be saved by
[44:23] grace. And the Jews were
[44:28] boiling. And see here they said in 33
[44:31] and they answered unto him and said, "We
[44:33] be of Abraham's seed, and we are never
[44:36] been in bondage to any man. How saith
[44:40] thou that ye shall be made free?" They
[44:43] were here. The Jews were cursing Jesus
[44:46] right to his face. and and he was the
[44:50] perfect sacrifice to take the bondage of
[44:53] of uh sin away. And up to that time, it
[44:57] was just covered and covered and pushed
[44:59] under the carpet. And the Jews hated
[45:04] change. They wanted it to stay works. If
[45:08] we jump to 39, and they answered and
[45:10] said unto him, Abraham's our father. And
[45:13] Jesus said unto them, "If you were
[45:15] Abraham's children, then the you would
[45:18] do the works of Abraham." They they they
[45:20] were even telling Jesus, they said, "You
[45:22] know, we weren't at least we weren't
[45:23] born in
[45:26] fornication, blaspheming Jesus." Verse
[45:29] 42, "And Jesus said unto them, if God
[45:32] were your father, then you would love
[45:33] me, for I proceedth forth and came from
[45:37] God, neither came I of myself, but he
[45:40] sent me." Verse 43. And why do you not
[45:43] understand? Why do you why do we not
[45:46] understand God
[45:54] even because you cannot hear my words?
[45:56] Why when somebody tells us the absolute
[46:00] complete total
[46:03] truth do we say
[46:09] but if we jump down and you know you
[46:12] could read that chapter it's an amazing
[46:14] chapter where the Jews hated the change
[46:17] in verse 52 and they said unto the Jews
[46:21] now we know that thou art the devil the
[46:24] Jews are saying to Jesus
[46:27] Because Jesus said, "Before Abraham was,
[46:29] I am." See, you know, the God that I
[46:32] serve, there ain't nobody close to him.
[46:37] The next person close to God is a
[46:40] trillion miles times a trillion miles
[46:42] away from God.
[46:45] Because there was nothing made that God
[46:46] didn't make. And there was only one
[46:49] person that knew the beginning from the
[46:50] end. That was the alpha and omega.
[46:52] Omnipotent and
[46:53] omnipresent was God. And so that's a
[46:57] huge first step of your stairs.
[47:01] That's right.
[47:05] They couldn't handle that. Jesus said,
[47:08] "Before Abraham was, I am." He said,
[47:10] "Now we know you're a devil because
[47:12] Abraham's dead." And the prophets and
[47:15] thou sayest that if a man keep my
[47:16] sayings, he shall never taste the death.
[47:19] Thou are greater. You're greater than
[47:21] our last minister. You're greater than
[47:24] our father Abraham, which is dead. They
[47:27] were worshiping prophets back then, too,
[47:29] because they wouldn't change.
[47:32] Which is dead. The prophets are dead.
[47:35] Whom makest thou to be
[47:38] yourself? Verse 56. So your father
[47:41] Abraham rejoiced to see this day, and he
[47:44] said it, and was
[47:46] glad. And then said the Jews unto him,
[47:49] "Thou art not 50 years old, and thou
[47:51] saith, thou hast seen Abraham." Jesus
[47:55] said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say
[47:56] unto you, that before Abraham was, I
[47:59] am." Then took they stones
[48:03] up to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself
[48:08] and went out through the temple in the
[48:10] midst of them and pressed them. I want
[48:12] to show you something and and God help
[48:15] us. And we we have a beautiful church
[48:17] and beautiful sanctuary. But that
[48:20] spirit is here today. And I'll prove it
[48:24] by the prophet because the prophet said
[48:27] that a pastor is a burden bearer. Now
[48:31] that's not what brother Dale said.
[48:32] That's what brother Bham said. And
[48:35] brother Bham said he could bear with the
[48:38] fusses of the people.
[48:43] But when you come into true adoption,
[48:46] you won't be fussing.
[48:48] You won't be worrying about if I shaved
[48:50] today or wore a tie or if my suit
[48:52] matches my pants or you won't be
[48:54] worrying about what Suzie ate or what
[48:57] Suz's kid did or nothing like this. You
[49:00] know, I'm I got a message that I started
[49:02] and the title of the message which is
[49:04] it's going to be a few weeks from now.
[49:06] It's none of my business.
[49:08] Jesus said in the Bible say, "What is
[49:10] that to thee?" Well, don't you see what
[49:12] they're doing? Don't you see their kids?
[49:14] Oh, don't you see? Oh, man. Everything's
[49:17] falling apart in church. What's that to
[49:19] you?
[49:21] Ain't nothing to you.
[49:24] What's that to thee? Follow thou me.
[49:30] But God had to raise up a ministry that
[49:32] could bear with the fusses of the people
[49:34] back then. They picked up stones.
[49:37] Well, that's what he said for Jesus.
[49:42] Here we go to John
[49:45] nine. Come here. And another example
[49:47] where people don't want to change. And
[49:48] the the Pharisees, they love the law and
[49:52] they wanted to keep the Sabbath. And
[49:54] here's Jehovah in the presence of the
[49:56] earth this morning or then in the
[49:58] tabernacle of the body Jesus. And he
[50:02] heals somebody. He does something
[50:03] amazing on the Sabbath and they want to
[50:06] kill him.
[50:08] They said, "Well, he must be a double."
[50:10] Like, who wouldn't want to have eyesight
[50:12] if you were stone blind?
[50:14] You know, we went out for breakfast with
[50:16] Brother Jim Yes day before yesterday and
[50:18] a lady come in stone blind in the
[50:21] restaurant. Broke my heart. I seen her
[50:23] brother sick and the big ball on the end
[50:25] of it. Stone
[50:27] blind. You know, if you were that
[50:29] person, you wouldn't really care if
[50:30] you'd be quite happy to be healed on the
[50:31] Sabbath day.
[50:34] But bless God, we don't
[50:37] see they like the past, but they didn't
[50:41] want the truth.
[50:49] Verse one, Jesus passed by a man and saw
[50:51] that he was blind from his birth. And
[50:53] let's just drop to verse 16. I have a
[50:55] lot more verses on my iPad, but I'm just
[50:58] reading the highlights. And therefore
[51:00] said the Pharisees unto this man, they
[51:02] said, "Is not this man ain't
[51:04] God? This man, this this minister,
[51:08] there's no way he can be of God cuz he
[51:10] did something
[51:12] good." Whoa.
[51:17] You know, sadly, if you do anything good
[51:20] for anybody, somebody will pick on you
[51:25] and it'll be working through another
[51:27] believer. It'll have to be a make. It's
[51:29] always the way it is. Well, you that's,
[51:32] you know, you shouldn't have took them
[51:33] you shouldn't have took them supper
[51:35] tonight. You shouldn't have you
[51:37] shouldn't have said those kind words to
[51:39] those people. You shouldn't have went
[51:42] into
[51:42] this. Do you know where they're from?
[51:55] this man cannot be of God because he
[51:57] keepeth not the Sabbath day. And others
[51:59] said, "Can a man that's a sinner do such
[52:02] as
[52:03] miracles?" And there was division among
[52:06] them.
[52:09] That's why brother Bram said in every
[52:11] church there's three kinds of believers.
[52:13] You know, he's I was reading studying
[52:15] this week, you know, the with the a
[52:17] minister. He just throws out the net and
[52:19] he catches spider water spiders and
[52:22] turtles and, you know, frogs, you name
[52:24] it. And that and then he catches some
[52:25] good old pike or some good old salmon,
[52:28] too. But they're all sitting in the same
[52:30] building.
[52:34] Amen.
[52:36] Here they the
[52:39] Pharisees here, God was right in their
[52:41] midst.
[52:43] and they missed it a 100
[52:46] miles because it was different than they
[52:49] thought
[52:52] and they wanted the past. They love,
[52:54] see, they love the law because they felt
[52:56] like they were going to heaven because
[52:58] they did something about
[53:00] it. I like it that I'm going to heaven
[53:03] and I had nothing to do with
[53:05] it because I knew I wouldn't go to
[53:07] heaven if I had something to do with it.
[53:10] Galatians 2 7 and 8. And here Peter now
[53:17] we're getting into we've we've left the
[53:19] you know the unsaved and unconverted
[53:22] Jews and Israelite and the the Pharisees
[53:25] and now we're coming into people that
[53:27] Jesus actually gave the keys to the
[53:29] kingdom
[53:30] for and Peter wanted to stay with the
[53:33] physical circumcision.
[53:37] So, oh, we got to keep doing
[53:40] that. And Peter was spineless because he
[53:43] acted different depending on who came to
[53:45] the church. If he was among the Jews, he
[53:48] said, "Oh, we must be circumcised." But
[53:50] if there was no Jews present, then he
[53:52] would be friends with the Gentiles.
[53:55] And you'll see in verse 7 or verse
[53:59] 11 and Paul's talking here and he said
[54:02] but when Peter came he said I withtood
[54:05] him to his
[54:06] face. Now I'll tell you something. Paul
[54:09] had a backbone. Peter was a jellyfish.
[54:16] How many times did Peter's knees cave
[54:18] in? Oh, I'll never curse your God. And
[54:21] God knew he would curse him multiple
[54:23] times.
[54:26] Saw stood him to the
[54:28] face because he was to
[54:33] blame. For before a certain came to
[54:35] James from James, and he did eat with
[54:38] the Gentiles. But when they were come,
[54:40] he withdrew himself and separated,
[54:43] fearing that
[54:45] they were of the
[54:48] circumcised. Peter was concerned about
[54:51] what other people thought.
[54:54] And he didn't like change.
[54:59] Amen. So we see there's nothing new
[55:01] under the heaven.
[55:06] Nothing
[55:07] new. Whoever whatever situation you're
[55:10] in, you wish you were in another
[55:13] one. People that are working hard get
[55:16] close to
[55:17] retirement. They say, "Wow, I can't wait
[55:19] to get retired." and their retire year
[55:21] and they're bored
[55:23] stiff, losing their mind because they
[55:25] never had any
[55:27] hobbies. Always want to be in a
[55:30] different
[55:32] position. Isaiah 28 9 and 13. Now we I
[55:37] apologize for you that were here on
[55:39] Wednesday night. You if I I I'll go
[55:42] through this part fast. You know, I've
[55:44] been long-winded for way too long and
[55:46] maybe it'll
[55:48] be But whom shall teach
[55:52] knowledge? And whom shall make to
[55:54] understand
[55:57] doctrine? It's them that's wean from the
[56:01] mal and from the draw from the breast.
[56:05] For it shall be precept upon precept and
[56:08] precept upon precept and line upon line,
[56:11] line upon line. here a little there
[56:13] little with sang bringing lips and with
[56:16] other tongues do I speak unto this
[56:18] people now watch what he says here you
[56:22] know sadly in our day if somebody comes
[56:26] and teaches the truth people we're
[56:29] living in a world that people are hugely
[56:31] opinionated oh my like and I mean drop
[56:35] the gloves opinionated if it was legal
[56:37] to kill I mean there'd be we wouldn't be
[56:40] safe you know what I Amen.
[56:45] It wouldn't matter what minister or who
[56:48] you had for a pastor that preached
[56:50] behind the pulpit. I'm never got 100% on
[56:54] who could teach the
[56:57] doctrine because people lean different
[57:00] ways.
[57:02] But watch verse 12. to whom he said,
[57:06] "This is the rest wherein you may cause
[57:10] the weary to rest, but they won't accept
[57:12] it. And this is a refreshing, and yet
[57:15] they will not hear it. You won't hear
[57:19] it. Not
[57:23] all." That's not because I say that.
[57:25] That's because the Bible says that.
[57:28] That's why it's always a mixed multitude
[57:31] wherever you are. And it's it's
[57:33] impossible to teach everybody the truth
[57:36] of doctrine. Now, we just went through
[57:37] how many examples in the Bible
[57:42] and nothing's changed.
[57:47] I mean, not the spirits haven't changed
[57:49] of people and their understanding. And
[57:52] yet, you wouldn't hear it, but it was
[57:55] God's
[57:56] plan. But you won't hear
[57:59] it here. Brother Bam says in a couple
[58:02] quotes here he said you must never
[58:04] misinterpret the word say well I believe
[58:07] it means this means just what it says it
[58:10] needs no interpretation you must not
[58:11] misplace the word and you must not
[58:13] dislocate the word now he says it more
[58:17] plainly the next well actually it's all
[58:18] in the same sermon but this is right
[58:20] before he dies now see we most of us
[58:23] would understand that the prophet's
[58:25] message was
[58:27] progressive and his revelation
[58:30] changed much and especially the last
[58:33] year or two especially after the seals
[58:34] but for sure right before he died it
[58:37] changed hugely after brother Bam said
[58:40] that the Bible became a brand new book
[58:42] after the seals was he teaching the word
[58:44] before that for sure he was but his
[58:46] understanding and knowledge of God had
[58:48] increased dramatically because the
[58:51] mysteries had been unveiled here in the
[58:53] next quote he said there's three things
[58:55] you must not be you must not
[58:57] misinterpret mishandle
[58:59] and mis uh then he he said and mis
[59:03] dislocate the word of God. It must be
[59:06] kept just exactly the way God read
[59:10] it. Now I'm not going to read this cuz
[59:13] we read it Wednesday, but Revelations 3,
[59:15] I'm just going to read verse 19.
[59:17] Revelations 3 is the church age to
[59:21] Leodysa. And you know what it is, but
[59:24] the people in Leodysia didn't need God.
[59:26] In verse 19, it says, "As many as I
[59:29] love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous,
[59:33] therefore, and repent." So God is always
[59:37] in the ministry, always rebuking and
[59:40] chastising the people until we that will
[59:44] happen until we get in the millennium or
[59:47] you die or you go in the rapture.
[59:50] Because brother Bram clearly thought it
[59:52] was he like the ones that was raptured,
[59:54] Elisha that was raptured, he just walked
[59:56] with God that he was so close he went
[59:57] home. You wouldn't be here this morning
[1:00:00] if you've came to perfect adoption
[1:00:03] cuz God would take you home. If he was
[1:00:05] finished with you and you were perfect
[1:00:06] adoption, me included, if I if I had
[1:00:10] come to perfect adoption right to the
[1:00:11] peak. Now, I believe we're we are there
[1:00:14] and and maybe maybe we've even arrived
[1:00:16] and God's got something for us left to
[1:00:17] do. But when we've arrived, God takes us
[1:00:20] home because our ministry is done and we
[1:00:24] enter into our rest. So there will
[1:00:26] always be rebuke and chastisement to
[1:00:29] make us more mature and more perfect.
[1:00:31] You know the Bible, and we're not going
[1:00:33] to go into that, but it it it was uh
[1:00:37] uh then he finishes in verse 22. He
[1:00:39] says, "He that has an ear, let him hear
[1:00:42] what the spirit says to the churches."
[1:00:46] Amen. And that spirit, I mean, it can
[1:00:49] speak many ways, but one of God's ways
[1:00:51] we read in the
[1:00:53] beginning was through the ministry. Now,
[1:00:57] now this is where I want to go into our
[1:00:59] example Wednesday night and and I'm just
[1:01:02] going to kind of blow through this in
[1:01:03] fairness to the people that were here
[1:01:04] Wednesday. And anybody that has wants
[1:01:07] the quotes, I won't say anything that
[1:01:09] ain't right here in front of me in these
[1:01:11] quotes. But brother Bram said that
[1:01:14] Pentecost was a an
[1:01:17] experience. He said that 49 times.
[1:01:21] Pentecost was an
[1:01:23] experience. And and Pentecost is a
[1:01:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So it's not a
[1:01:29] church. It's not an age. It's not a
[1:01:31] building. It's not even a time frame. It
[1:01:34] was when the Holy Ghost was given that
[1:01:36] was called Pentecost. I have a quote
[1:01:38] right here right here in front of me. He
[1:01:40] said, "Back to the leadership of the of
[1:01:43] the Holy Ghost." Uh God gave his
[1:01:45] children the new birth, which was the
[1:01:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost, a Pentecostal
[1:01:51] experience. So if you have the baptism
[1:01:54] of the Holy Ghost this morning, and that
[1:01:56] you don't have to tell me that's between
[1:01:57] you and God, you have had a Pentecostal
[1:02:01] experience. That's why. So we're we're
[1:02:04] laying some doctrine here. Clearly this
[1:02:07] we're not leaving the message that we
[1:02:09] understand the
[1:02:18] prophet.
[1:02:21] Amen. So we understand that that the
[1:02:24] Pentecost is the new birth and that's
[1:02:26] when the Holy Ghost was given. When they
[1:02:28] had the upper room experience, they were
[1:02:30] filled with the Holy Ghost. They went
[1:02:31] out and there was 3,000 added to the
[1:02:33] church that day. Then brother Bram says
[1:02:36] early in his ministry he says that we
[1:02:38] need to go back to Pentecost 45 times he
[1:02:42] says that back to Pentecost and every
[1:02:45] single time brother Brown says that he
[1:02:47] was preaching to sinners 100%. Some of
[1:02:50] the quotes and I can give them to you.
[1:02:52] Some of them I have on my iPad some of
[1:02:54] them I don't. Some of them he said were
[1:02:55] sitting right in the congregation was
[1:02:57] women cutting their hair off, painting
[1:02:59] their faces wearing pants and slacks and
[1:03:01] earrings and and all this stuff. And so
[1:03:04] when brother Bram said 45 times to go
[1:03:07] back to Pentecost, it was because the
[1:03:09] people weren't even converted. They
[1:03:11] weren't saved. They weren't sanctified.
[1:03:13] And they definitely weren't had the
[1:03:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So if
[1:03:17] somebody was to come up to me and say,
[1:03:18] "We I need to go back to Pentecost." I'd
[1:03:21] say, "Well, you need the Holy Ghost."
[1:03:22] Then
[1:03:24] that's another way to say it. You need
[1:03:25] to get the baptism Holy Ghost. But I
[1:03:27] don't need to go back to Pentecost cuz I
[1:03:29] already have the Holy Ghost. I have the
[1:03:30] tabernacle of of God himself living
[1:03:32] inside of
[1:03:35] me. And so I am
[1:03:39] Pentecost. How could I go back to
[1:03:41] something that I already am?
[1:03:43] And so we can prove this in the message
[1:03:46] uh when brother Brand talks about Peter
[1:03:49] and he says Peter wasn't converted. And
[1:03:53] he said to Peter, he said when you're
[1:03:54] converted, strengthen the brethren. Now
[1:03:57] wait a minute. Now, Peter walked with
[1:04:00] Jesus.
[1:04:02] Peter was the man that God gave the keys
[1:04:04] of life to. But Jesus knew that he never
[1:04:07] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Jesus
[1:04:10] knew that he would curse him. And here
[1:04:12] you can say this very plainly in
[1:04:14] questions and answers. Uh and and he
[1:04:17] says it in 632 above
[1:04:19] it. But he says, "Now Peter, I know all
[1:04:22] this, but you're not converted yet. and
[1:04:26] you're not converted, but after you are
[1:04:28] converted, Peter hadn't received the
[1:04:31] Holy Ghost
[1:04:32] yet. So, see, Jesus could have said to
[1:04:36] Peter, "You need to go back to
[1:04:39] Pentecost." And I would say to anybody
[1:04:41] that come and challenges me or or talks
[1:04:43] to me about being off the word, if
[1:04:46] you're off the word, you need to go back
[1:04:47] to
[1:04:48] Pentecost. Pentecost is the word, but
[1:04:52] I'm walking with it.
[1:04:54] Pentecost is the Holy Ghost. So, it's
[1:04:56] not that I have to go back to Pentecost.
[1:04:59] I'm already filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:06] And it ain't possible to leave that
[1:05:08] Pentecost because Ephesians 4:30 says
[1:05:11] that you are sealed until your day of
[1:05:15] redemption.
[1:05:17] So when brother Bram's ministry, you
[1:05:19] have to understand that early in his
[1:05:20] ministry, he was preaching to
[1:05:22] denominational churches and none of them
[1:05:24] have I would clearly say that that none
[1:05:27] or very few had ever come into the
[1:05:29] stature of the fullness of the of the
[1:05:31] perfect man. And so he was preaching to
[1:05:34] non-filled people. He was pre preaching
[1:05:36] to people that still had trinitarian
[1:05:38] doctrines and and and all kinds of
[1:05:41] carryovers. Amen. And in some cases we
[1:05:44] should have that but it would never be.
[1:05:46] So here we see in Ephesians 30 that once
[1:05:50] you receive the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:05:52] have to go back and get more Holy Ghost.
[1:05:55] You might get more refilling and you
[1:05:57] would grow more mature and more statue.
[1:05:59] Brother Brandham compared it to this
[1:06:01] like the train car that's going to cross
[1:06:04] uh boundary lines, country lines. And he
[1:06:07] said, "When that inspector, the Holy
[1:06:09] Ghost, goes in that train car and he
[1:06:11] checks everything in that car and he
[1:06:12] says, "Now you have everything you have
[1:06:15] need of for the rapture and you have it
[1:06:18] on the right shelf in the right place
[1:06:20] and your thing." And he goes out and he
[1:06:22] slaps the seal on the thing and it was
[1:06:24] against the law for anybody to break
[1:06:26] that seal until you got to the
[1:06:28] millennium.
[1:06:31] That's a new country. That's the one I'm
[1:06:32] looking for. If anybody knows where it
[1:06:35] is, let me have the address cuz I'm
[1:06:36] added
[1:06:42] there. So to preach a message
[1:06:46] to people that have the baptism of the
[1:06:48] Holy Ghost that they need to go back to
[1:06:51] Pentecost is like
[1:06:56] it's like what are you talking
[1:06:58] about? Like brother Bram said this. He
[1:07:01] said, "Luther's message wouldn't have
[1:07:03] worked in Wesley's day." I want I want
[1:07:05] maybe maybe this will help you cuz and
[1:07:07] we're going to read into this quote, but
[1:07:09] this will help the kids. You got to
[1:07:10] watch me. Watch this. Brother Bram said,
[1:07:12] "We're building a
[1:07:14] house." And he said, "It's a piece of
[1:07:16] cake building a wall, but when you're
[1:07:17] building a house gets a little hairier."
[1:07:19] It's like brother Bart when he's driving
[1:07:20] the big rig. It's a piece of cake when
[1:07:22] the road straight. He can almost sleep
[1:07:23] and the road will go straight. You know,
[1:07:25] they got those two, you know, in our
[1:07:27] car, brother Bart, if you get close to
[1:07:28] the line, it'll it'll almost it'll force
[1:07:30] you back. It almost force you back cuz
[1:07:32] it's like almost an auto steer like the
[1:07:34] planes. But when he starts pulling off
[1:07:37] an inner ejection and it says, you know,
[1:07:40] it shows a picture of a truck go tippy
[1:07:42] turby and it says 30k, it means 30k. Cuz
[1:07:46] if you hit that doing 50k, you're going
[1:07:48] to be like the sign says, tippy off.
[1:07:51] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:07:53] Yeah. So when Luther came along, he
[1:07:56] built one wall of the house. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:07:59] And it was the word of God, and we're
[1:08:00] not throwing it out. You must be saved.
[1:08:03] Yeah. Yeah. You can only be saved by the
[1:08:05] the blood of the Lord. Then Wesley came.
[1:08:07] He said, "Sanctification's great. You
[1:08:10] know, you need to clean up your life cuz
[1:08:11] God won't fill in the Holy Ghost in a
[1:08:12] cup that's dirty." And Pentecost came
[1:08:15] and they give the the uh the gifts of
[1:08:17] the spirit and, you know, speaking in
[1:08:19] tongues and prophecy. It's all here and
[1:08:21] that's and it's all the Bible and we're
[1:08:23] not throwing none of it
[1:08:25] out and it's all part of the word just
[1:08:28] like Luther's message
[1:08:29] was but a house ain't built
[1:08:33] yet. It's going to be pretty cold here
[1:08:36] in January with the front wall off.
[1:08:40] You'll never make it in the rapture in
[1:08:43] Pentecost. You'll go through the
[1:08:45] tribulation. Hope you enjoy
[1:08:47] yourself unless you're willing to hear
[1:08:50] the
[1:08:51] truth. Like the Bible says, God's given
[1:08:54] us the truth. But if you're not willing
[1:08:56] to hear it, well, they're done to me.
[1:08:59] Cuz see, it's none of my
[1:09:02] business, right? It's none of my
[1:09:05] business. It's none of my business who
[1:09:07] accepts the truth or not. It's only my
[1:09:09] business that I say the truth and live
[1:09:10] the truth. If I'm saying the truth and
[1:09:12] living the truth, who comes to this
[1:09:14] place or comes to my house or or is in
[1:09:16] my life, that's God's business. Other
[1:09:19] words, we would go we would be like we
[1:09:22] would go crazy. You'd be suicidal if you
[1:09:25] thought it was your business cuz you you
[1:09:27] just try to control one of your kids.
[1:09:30] One of you you older parents just try to
[1:09:33] make them in a box that you want them to
[1:09:35] be. And if they don't go nuts, you
[1:09:39] will. But the last one, Brother Bram
[1:09:42] said, was the opening of the word. He
[1:09:45] said it was the bride age. And he said
[1:09:47] it was the I age, the scene age. And now
[1:09:52] we have our house built. Now we need all
[1:09:54] four
[1:09:56] walls. But we're not
[1:09:59] living. We're as long as you have been
[1:10:02] filled with the Holy Ghost, you're past
[1:10:04] Pentecost.
[1:10:06] Because brother Bram said 49 times,
[1:10:09] Pentecost isn't a isn't a church. It's
[1:10:12] an
[1:10:12] experience. Peter hadn't received the
[1:10:15] experience yet.
[1:10:20] And so when brother Brown was preaching
[1:10:22] back to Pentecost, that absolutely,
[1:10:25] completely and indefinitely does not
[1:10:27] apply to me.
[1:10:29] It would apply to anybody that's not
[1:10:31] filled with the Holy Ghost. That don't
[1:10:34] even apply to people that are
[1:10:35] backsliding.
[1:10:37] Because brother Brown taught us that you
[1:10:39] can't backslide. You can't be unsealed
[1:10:41] once you're sealed. He says when you're
[1:10:43] backsliding, you're out of
[1:10:45] fellowship. You might have kids here. If
[1:10:47] you've ever been accepted the Holy Ghost
[1:10:49] for you think they could leave the
[1:10:51] church and completely go in sin, go into
[1:10:55] any kind of sin that you think is
[1:10:56] terrible. They can't break that seal.
[1:10:59] It's not possible for them to break that
[1:11:01] seal.
[1:11:03] Brother Brandham said you can't be
[1:11:04] sealed and be unsealed. He said you can
[1:11:06] be out of
[1:11:07] fellowship and brother Brandham will
[1:11:09] bring and not brother Brandham God will
[1:11:11] bring you back into fellowship in his
[1:11:13] own good time.
[1:11:18] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:11:22] Here here and I
[1:11:23] and here in my first quote there maybe
[1:11:26] you can put them up. So, we know we're
[1:11:28] in the word age now, the bride age or
[1:11:31] the I
[1:11:34] age. And here he says that the
[1:11:38] foundation was Luther and Wesley was on
[1:11:41] the move and he sent missionaries around
[1:11:42] the world. And then he said the
[1:11:44] Pentecostal age, this is how he said. He
[1:11:46] never said gifts, which it does. He
[1:11:47] says, but he said it was the fingers and
[1:11:49] things. He said it was the the tongue
[1:11:51] and the nose and so forth. But he said
[1:11:54] now in the last par the last paragraph
[1:11:56] there he said now it's in the
[1:12:00] eyes. What good will it be for you to
[1:12:02] need eyes? He said you need light and
[1:12:04] the eyes isn't there to see. See the
[1:12:07] eyes the first to see come. And he
[1:12:09] opened the seven seals and he revealed
[1:12:11] the evening light taking the mysteries
[1:12:13] that's been head down through the church
[1:12:15] ages and he revealed them to the promise
[1:12:17] of the revelations 10 1-7. And here we
[1:12:19] are today sitting in the midst of the
[1:12:21] word being the the word being revealed
[1:12:25] to us by Jesus Christ, God's word. Let's
[1:12:28] go to our next quote there. But it now
[1:12:32] now when it came down
[1:12:34] now we're in the last age. It's not back
[1:12:38] to Pentecost.
[1:12:40] So for all those people, I I just want
[1:12:43] to message people sometimes are very
[1:12:45] hard to to
[1:12:49] uh well, we're just the home crowd to to
[1:12:52] to talk
[1:12:53] to because you got message people that
[1:12:56] say, "Well, we got to take every word
[1:12:57] the prophet said." But the prophet's
[1:12:59] message changed.
[1:13:03] See, as his revelation changed it, and
[1:13:05] that don't stumble me at all, his
[1:13:08] message grew. and and Revelation. And so
[1:13:11] for a period of time, Brother Bram was
[1:13:12] saying, "Go back to Pentecost." Now he
[1:13:15] says, "Don't go back to
[1:13:17] Pentecost. We're beyond Pentecost."
[1:13:22] Was the prophet wrong? No, he wasn't
[1:13:24] wrong. He was mature.
[1:13:28] He had grown up. He had received the
[1:13:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And not only
[1:13:32] that, he knew you had received the
[1:13:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost. He said, "Not
[1:13:36] back to the Pentecostal age." He said,
[1:13:37] "We're over here in the last age." He
[1:13:39] said, "The first age began with the word
[1:13:41] which was Christ." He said, "The last
[1:13:43] age ends with the word which is
[1:13:45] Christ." He said several of these things
[1:13:47] that was the stock. And he talks about,
[1:13:50] you know, he Well, let's go to the next
[1:13:52] quote here. He talks about the different
[1:13:53] ages, you know, like a plant of wheat
[1:13:55] growing up and Luther was the stock and
[1:13:57] Wesley was the leaves and Pentecost was
[1:14:00] the husk around the seed.
[1:14:03] Now, I'll just flat out tell you, and if
[1:14:05] this offends you or not, I'm not even
[1:14:07] sorry. I'm not going back to husk
[1:14:10] because when I combine my wheat, I have
[1:14:13] the wind wide open, and I want to blow
[1:14:15] all pentecost out the back
[1:14:18] door 100%. Because if they get pentecost
[1:14:22] in my grade of good wheat, I'll be
[1:14:26] docked and it'll cost me money because
[1:14:30] there's no value to it. It's just light
[1:14:32] chaff. That's right. So I blow it on the
[1:14:36] ground. He said, "Now, if you watch,
[1:14:39] watch how close it is. It's a razor edge
[1:14:42] now between right and wrong." And so
[1:14:44] remember that if it falls on the one
[1:14:46] side and it'll come down to sometimes
[1:14:49] like the arner of a razor between the
[1:14:52] difference of right and wrong. And he
[1:14:54] said, "You got to take every word of God
[1:14:55] and not just almost every word, but
[1:14:57] every word of God." And it's down today,
[1:15:00] not to the Lutheran, not to the
[1:15:03] Messians, not to the Pentecostals, but
[1:15:05] to the but to that honor
[1:15:08] age. And that age where the Antichrist
[1:15:11] anointing is per so perfectly that it
[1:15:14] will deceive their very
[1:15:16] life. They'll fall on the wrong side and
[1:15:19] they'll find out that they don't watch
[1:15:21] it like the edge. Watch it. Be careful.
[1:15:24] We're not living. You'll see that right
[1:15:27] in the bottom. They don't even put my
[1:15:28] underlines. I underlined it. You won't
[1:15:29] underline it for me. We're not living in
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:34] Pentecostal. We're past that age
[1:15:38] here. And I'm just I'm going to just to
[1:15:41] save time. I'm going to go not read all
[1:15:43] these quotes. The next quote he said,
[1:15:45] now we are not living in Luther's age or
[1:15:47] Wesley's age or the Pentecostal age. The
[1:15:49] Pentecostal age was only the restoration
[1:15:52] of the gifts coming back in the church.
[1:15:54] But we're living in the evening time.
[1:15:56] We're living in a time calling out of
[1:15:58] the bride. And just as it was hard, now
[1:16:01] this part, if you don't get nothing
[1:16:03] else, listen to this part. This was our
[1:16:05] message. Just as it was hard for
[1:16:07] Catholics to see
[1:16:09] Luther, and it's hard for Luther to see
[1:16:12] Wesley, and it's hard for
[1:16:14] Pentecost to see the bride. So is it
[1:16:18] hard for the Pentecostals to see this
[1:16:21] age. It's always been that way because
[1:16:25] it poured out upon the elect seed. It's
[1:16:28] always If you're caught in the wrong
[1:16:30] age, you're deceived.
[1:16:36] If you want to go in the rapture, you
[1:16:38] got to get in the
[1:16:39] grain. You got to get in the seed. But
[1:16:43] it's always hard for people to turn the
[1:16:46] corner to build the
[1:16:48] house. We're not getting rid of the
[1:16:50] house.
[1:16:51] We still believe in Luther. You must be
[1:16:53] saved by grace. We still believe in
[1:16:56] Wesley. He'll clean up your life. We
[1:16:59] still believe in the gifts of the
[1:17:00] spirit, tongues, prophecy, whatever God
[1:17:02] wants, he's he's the one that sends them
[1:17:05] 100%.
[1:17:08] But we've moved into the mysteries and
[1:17:10] the secret. We We've actually moved past
[1:17:12] the mysteries. Let me just be clear
[1:17:14] here. We've actually moved into the
[1:17:17] person of Jehovah.
[1:17:24] and he's got all the wealth.
[1:17:27] Amen. You know, before I I just love
[1:17:31] typing the bride to a marriage. I mean,
[1:17:33] it just is a anybody that if I ever see
[1:17:37] don't believe in the marriage on this
[1:17:38] earth, it's just the most ridiculous
[1:17:40] thing I ever did see because, you know,
[1:17:42] if you're in a courtship or you're in a
[1:17:45] you're engaged, you're only getting the
[1:17:50] gifts. Sure, he buys you flowers every
[1:17:53] Friday night, takes you out for supper,
[1:17:54] and he picks up the tab. But I actually
[1:17:57] got the person.
[1:18:00] See, I got all the gifts and the person
[1:18:03] cuz I'm married.
[1:18:08] Here are the next force. He said, "When
[1:18:09] we come forth and hath come forth in the
[1:18:12] Pentecostal age of the restoration of
[1:18:13] the
[1:18:14] gifts, it would almost deceive the very
[1:18:17] elect." It looked like it was the real
[1:18:18] grain wheat opened up there, but there's
[1:18:21] no wheat in there at all. It's only
[1:18:24] shuck. But back there they begin to form
[1:18:28] the you know he's talking about but the
[1:18:30] shelter it all Pentecost was all
[1:18:33] Pentecost
[1:18:35] was was to shelter
[1:18:39] me. All Pentecost was was to shelter you
[1:18:44] cuz this was the Pentecost and you were
[1:18:47] in here. And so when it rained real hard
[1:18:50] it was Pentecost that run the rain off.
[1:18:52] It was the hus that run the rain off. So
[1:18:54] the the wrong stuff wouldn't get in the
[1:18:56] seed. All it was was a protector of the
[1:18:59] real
[1:19:00] value. Everything up to it was put in
[1:19:04] the Hallelujah. That's what he says
[1:19:06] here. He said, "But it was a shelter for
[1:19:09] the wheat. It's been growing through it
[1:19:11] all the time."
[1:19:15] And now it's beginning now it's
[1:19:17] beginning to pull away. And the wheat's
[1:19:18] beginning to be seen. And it's not
[1:19:22] Pentecost. It's a latter day age. It's a
[1:19:26] blind age. It's the evening light. It's
[1:19:28] when Malachi 4 fulfills
[1:19:32] everything. Hallelujah. Next
[1:19:35] quote. And you can't do it in Luther's
[1:19:38] age. You couldn't do it in Wesley's age.
[1:19:39] And you can't do it in the Pentecostal
[1:19:41] age. But in the day when the son of man
[1:19:44] shall be manifested, revealed, and
[1:19:46] brought back to the church together with
[1:19:49] the entire deity of
[1:19:52] God among his
[1:19:56] people.
[1:19:59] Wow. We're going to stop. I have
[1:20:02] multiple
[1:20:03] multiple Romans 8:30. I was just going
[1:20:06] to read that. And God's eyes were
[1:20:08] already glorified. I have another dozen
[1:20:11] quotes. I don't need to read them
[1:20:13] because nothing can say it better than
[1:20:15] that. We have the entire deity of
[1:20:20] God amongst the
[1:20:23] people. I just have one simple question.
[1:20:27] In what
[1:20:28] world would anybody hanging around this
[1:20:31] message, hanging around the truth, or in
[1:20:34] what world would anybody wanting to go
[1:20:36] in a rapture or believe they're going to
[1:20:39] heaven not want the best and it
[1:20:46] all? Who wouldn't want what Luther's
[1:20:49] got, what Wesley's got, and what
[1:20:52] Pentecost was? And now we have the deity
[1:20:56] of the son of man. And he's not living
[1:20:59] in heaven. He's living right in me. And
[1:21:03] he's living in right in every one of you
[1:21:06] with the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost. And so if you ever in your
[1:21:13] life say, "Where's the Welsh
[1:21:18] revival? Where's Pentecost in the
[1:21:21] church?"
[1:21:23] Just give them your best side.
[1:21:29] Say, "I am Pentecost."
[1:21:32] That's right. Didn't you know
[1:21:35] that? I'm Pentecost
[1:21:38] plus. I'm Pentecost plus deity.
[1:21:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. Do you see? Do you see
[1:21:47] how God can show through the scriptures
[1:21:50] that everybody wanted to live in a
[1:21:53] different spot than where they
[1:21:57] were? And brother Brandham, our prophet,
[1:21:59] could bring it so clearly. He said,
[1:22:00] "It's hard for Luther to see Wesley,
[1:22:03] hard for Wesley to see Pentecost, and
[1:22:05] it's hard for Pentecost to realize that
[1:22:07] there
[1:22:10] was." And that's why because they were
[1:22:13] unwilling to hear the
[1:22:15] truth, they were the foolish virgins and
[1:22:20] they'll have to give their life through
[1:22:22] the
[1:22:23] tribulation because I don't want ears
[1:22:26] like
[1:22:27] that. I don't want to be the person that
[1:22:30] when somebody comes, you know, and they
[1:22:32] just say, you know, just tell me the
[1:22:34] blunt truth. The barn burnt down. It
[1:22:37] burned down.
[1:22:39] Let's let's move from here.
[1:22:42] You don't have to pay. I was going too
[1:22:44] fast and I came on black ice and I hit a
[1:22:47] semi. Why do we always try to fudge the
[1:22:51] truth? Why do we always try to hide what
[1:22:54] ain't
[1:22:55] truth? Because you're the husk and the
[1:22:58] leaves and you're only covering up what
[1:23:01] the real is.
[1:23:03] You know, I think of the time when
[1:23:05] Esther was me were spreading manure and
[1:23:08] she drove in the ditch with the manure
[1:23:10] spreader, rightful. And she come back
[1:23:12] and I don't know nothing has happened.
[1:23:13] I'm the one that was filling her and she
[1:23:16] was other than she had turned into an
[1:23:17] angel. She was white as a ghost. And she
[1:23:20] come over and and she said, "I drove in
[1:23:24] the
[1:23:25] ditch." I said, "Were you on her phone?"
[1:23:27] He said, "Yep, I was on my phone and I
[1:23:29] drove in the ditch."
[1:23:31] And I said, 'Well, praise God. You
[1:23:33] nothing's hurt. Let's just keep on
[1:23:36] going. There's nothing wrong with the
[1:23:38] truth.
[1:23:40] But just in case, and we're going to
[1:23:41] close on this, just in
[1:23:45] case you don't
[1:23:48] know, people don't want the truth.
[1:23:54] Just try witnessing. Just try telling
[1:23:56] somebody the truth out there. Just tell
[1:23:58] Just tell them the blunt truth. Just
[1:24:00] tell them whatever you want to tell
[1:24:01] them. Whatever's truth to you, you tell
[1:24:03] them that. See how it's received.
[1:24:06] Now, just think about a minister or
[1:24:08] pastor that's trying to go right in the
[1:24:11] exact center of the road.
[1:24:14] And every week you have people on both
[1:24:17] sides. We just had a scenario in the
[1:24:19] church. And I had one person call me on
[1:24:22] Monday and praised me and said, 'I can't
[1:24:24] believe how beautiful and wonderful and
[1:24:27] kind and beautiful and and nice you were
[1:24:29] about how you handled that. I had one on
[1:24:31] the other
[1:24:34] side and it was as different as
[1:24:36] nighttime is from day and they both
[1:24:39] attend this church.
[1:24:47] It'll be like that till we go home. So
[1:24:49] don't let it stumble you. That's that's
[1:24:52] why our young people need to hear this
[1:24:54] because you see hypocrites in the
[1:24:56] message church. That don't affect me at
[1:24:59] all. I could see I could see men wearing
[1:25:03] dresses and women wearing pants and men
[1:25:06] having hair to the floor. Now it don't
[1:25:08] affect my belief. It didn't change deity
[1:25:10] to me. Didn't change it a bit to me.
[1:25:13] That's right. It didn't change the weed
[1:25:16] inside me.
[1:25:18] Yeah.
[1:25:21] Because you know what? It ain't none of
[1:25:23] my business what you think.
[1:25:27] It ain't none of my business.
[1:25:31] But God will make it his business.
[1:25:36] Amen.
[1:25:38] Let's
[1:25:42] stand. Amen. God help us. God, help us
[1:25:45] to accept what the blessing we we are
[1:25:49] blessed
[1:25:51] beyond whoa comprehension what what God
[1:25:54] has given you and us in this day and and
[1:25:58] and made available to all that would
[1:26:00] receive
[1:26:02] it. Amen. That's why the wrath of God
[1:26:04] will be so, you know, you know, just we
[1:26:07] could just go on forever, but that, you
[1:26:10] know, God made a way for all that would,
[1:26:12] for whosoever
[1:26:14] would, but he knew most
[1:26:17] wouldn't. And it's just amazing how
[1:26:20] people can be so close, so very close to
[1:26:23] the truth.
[1:26:25] And it's
[1:26:28] like one word.
[1:26:31] One word caused all the sickness,
[1:26:34] heartache, death in the world. One
[1:26:36] word.
[1:26:38] Not. Not. Whoa. Like that was a pretty
[1:26:42] good message. There was just two or
[1:26:43] three.
[1:26:47] Not. God help us. God, help us to be
[1:26:50] able to receive not not receive a man,
[1:26:54] but receive the Holy Spirit that's
[1:26:56] coming through the
[1:26:58] gifts that God's using. The brother
[1:27:00] Brown called the five-fold ministries
[1:27:03] that are on the word his army. That's
[1:27:07] what he called them. He called them his
[1:27:08] army. He called them different things.
[1:27:10] Called them stars and that, but he said
[1:27:11] they were his dress rehearsal army.
[1:27:15] But many can't receive it. just they
[1:27:18] cannot handle that part. Amen. God help
[1:27:21] us. Amen. Amen. God help
[1:27:24] us. Hallelujah. Help us not to miss, you
[1:27:28] know, a razor edge. Just think of a
[1:27:30] razor edge. Be so
[1:27:33] close. So, so close. Amen. God help us
[1:27:36] to, you know, the more you know, brother
[1:27:39] Bram said, he said, "You show me a
[1:27:40] church that's humble, really humble,
[1:27:43] truly humble and not arrogant, and I'll
[1:27:46] show you a church that's got the divine
[1:27:49] favor and power of God." And I got to
[1:27:53] say this, you know, Brother Bram said,
[1:27:55] "Anytime God blesses a man just a little
[1:27:59] bit, he gets
[1:28:02] arrogant." That's that's a trap.
[1:28:05] Watch Paul in the Bible. Watch Paul in
[1:28:07] the Bible. Who had more revelation than
[1:28:09] Paul in the Bible? He wrote all of the
[1:28:11] grace. Wrote most of the New Testament.
[1:28:14] And Jesus said, "My grace is
[1:28:16] sufficient." Jesus wouldn't heal him.
[1:28:18] And the prophet said was because he had
[1:28:20] gave him so
[1:28:21] much that Paul would have thought, "Oh,
[1:28:24] it's me." And because God left them with
[1:28:27] that little
[1:28:30] infirmity,
[1:28:33] eyesight, it kept them humble enough
[1:28:35] that God could use them. But you know
[1:28:37] what? All the people sitting in Paul's
[1:28:39] message today that day say, "Wow, if he
[1:28:42] was really anointed of God, he would
[1:28:44] accept his healing."
[1:28:49] Guess who would be lost? The people that
[1:28:52] said that.
[1:28:55] Amen. That's right. Amazing. Amen.
[1:28:58] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord
[1:29:00] Jesus. Amen. God is so
[1:29:03] good. He is Lord.
[1:29:06] F. He is
[1:29:11] Lord. There is no other
[1:29:17] one. Who
