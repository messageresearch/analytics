God so loved the world he gave gave his only son away a way to save a Wretch like Me me the one who needed Grace Grace to cover everything stains that he no longer so Jesus it's amazing to believe God so loved the world means [Music] how could you see my sin and forgive me even then who would pay that kind of price I see what Mercy does he found me where I was and he gave his life for my mind for God so loved the world he gave gave his only son away a way to save a rich like me hold me the one who needed Grace Grace God so loved the world means even me me with all my sailors me with all my

means [Music] me [Music] foreign [Applause] amen and amen and amen oh my I tell you what an absolute privilege it is to know him as a savior to know him as a lord to know him as a deliverer to know him as all of these things isn't it wonderful to know Jesus this way friends I feel sorry for folks that absolutely just do not know him in the power of his resurrection and you know we are so grateful to the Lord to have that in our hearts and you know to know exactly what it's all about to know that Christianity is not just a book we read or some kind of thing we learn but it's Jesus Christ himself right here amongst the body I'm so grateful to be a part of it aren't you amen and I want Samantha to sing a song I guess we've seen this probably a thousand times but you know I um I I love the meaning of it I've got it on my heart tonight and this should be all of us it's my desire to serve Jesus Christ don't you feel that way [Music] it's my desire [Music] to live for Jesus it's my desire to live just like him go often [Music] bring him my shame but it's my desire [Music] to live for him if you could see where Jesus brought me from [Music] you would know the reason why I raise my hands [Music] I don't need Earth's power it's my desire I heard to live for here it's my desire [Music] to help someone today someone who may have failed to see the way I too once was so lost and you let me to his cross and it's my desire [Music] to live foreign if you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today then you would know the reason why I love him soon [Music] I don't need Earth's power it's my desire it is [Music] [Music] praise Allah can you sing this for me Stan sing this with us [Music] [Music] after thee you you are alone are my heart desire and I long to worship with your hands raised now [Music] Lord my strength my shield to you does my spirit yes [Music] [Music] you're my friends and you are my brother even though you are you are a king [Music] I Want You Wanna Go Near others so much more than anything [Music] you hello you are my highest desire and I love to worship thee praise His holy name if you have your Bibles this evening let's turn you're on helping us to the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22. and we certainly appreciate the spirit of the Lord of all the things we appreciate he's the greatest one of all of it amen Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22. amen we're certainly grateful to the Lord for the opportunity to be able to open up the Bible and read from the truth of this message and from the truth of the Bible without having to be confused by organization man's ways of things don't it feel good to just be able just to open your Bible and know just know know what you're reading know what you're talking about have that confidence how wonderful that is isn't that great I want to speak to the Lord helping us tonight upon the ministry of surrender under Ephesians 5 verse 22. now sisters this sounds like I'm getting ready to poke at you but this is only a spiritual type okay wives submit yourself unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything now if you'll notice the emphasis of that their own husbands in everything because first of all if I'm a married man and I have my own wife I don't expect my own wife to be taking orders and being bossed around by other men right neither does Christ accept you know just talking about Godly Ministry now might be the only way that he would do this but not putting the ministry part down now don't think I'm putting preachers down but only those preachers that are speaking on his behalf they're the only ones allowed to fool with them they're the only ones and the ones that come behind this desk brother Brahm said they've got to absolutely have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they've got to know by call of God that they belong here any other voice any other man denomination Church affiliation Doctrine you name it anything contrary to that outside of that part right there that are not subject unto it whatsoever people are subject to all kinds of things heard subject to Christ they get subject unto a church they get subject under a group of preachers or a bunch of people again not put Ministry out now but if a person is really genuinely born again in the Holy Ghost and they're speaking by the Oracles of God really it ain't that man it's a Holy Ghost speaking through that person and that's the only ones allowed to to fool with her now listen to this in Jehovah John and it is her nature to surrender to a man it is the nature of the church to surrender to Christ to surrender to his will Just Surrender she has no thanking her own just somebody else's if he would have done that we would have never had to die but she listened to she listened to reasoning and to the reasonings but the pride of Christ takes the Hedge all right he says hallelujah now let me call your attention to one statement here he said that we don't have thoughts of our own now listen that doesn't mean we're robots and that doesn't mean that we're sitting around and letting just anybody and everybody tell us what to do and we're just yes sir no sir yes sir we have our own thinking but the difference is bride of Christ submit he's the words brings that way amen no matter what she believes no matter what kind of person she may be no matter uh opinionated we have a lot of opinionated people around the truth that's fine the nature of it is fine as far as that goes as long as that person is willing to see truth and say okay my idea doesn't matter anymore we believe the message I believe the truth the Bible amen let's pray together with the word can we while your head survived this evening if you'd just like to be remembered in prayer would you please slip your hand up God bless you my hands up too amen all over the building father what a privilege it is to come into your house Lord Jesus we surrender Our Lives to you may you come this evening time and speak to us Mighty God lord through the lips of thy servant I offer myself to you and Lord Jesus I offer these people their mind their hearts and their friends Lord and all that they may have brought with them tonight may all the baggage be set aside may all the weights be put aside and may not the Holy Spirit I pray coming here tonight take your word and speak to us expressingly Lord Jesus I pray that you will not only open up the windows of heaven and pour out us Revelation and understanding and blessings of healing and deliverance whatever the people may need but Lord God may you have the right of way in the service tonight may you get the preeminances of all things for we commit this myself this audience and every uplifted hand with that need there to the hands of the Lord Jesus we glorify your name tonight knowing Thou Art God the same yesterday today and forever we thank you this evening Lord and we appreciate you and Lord we sure stand in the need of prayer that you amen God bless you good and understand that you know we're living in a quite quite a serious time and I don't think it takes us we have the expression back home but don't take the genius to see that we're living in the last days that's for sure and uh one thing I believe is that the Bride of Jesus foreign able to fully completely understand the revelation of who she is not just the revelation of Christ not just the revelation of the Bible the revelation of the devil and whatever more revelation of a church or a pastor or an evangelist or some kind of teacher or something but I believe she is going to come to the revelation of who she is because don't forget that the great mystery of God is not just the mystery of Jesus Christ but it's also the mystery of you and there is a part given to God that we surrender ourselves to God and that is placed in Us by the New Birth by the Holy Spirit the potential or the ability to be able to completely and totally surrender and only God can put that in the human heart in the first place now we know what the Bible tells us that in the last days people will be lovers of them on their own selves and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and you know uh pleasure in itself is not a bad thing I enjoy playing the piano and singing matter of fact you know sometimes when we get together with other musicians I like to show off a little bit when I get with them I I love it I love playing and singing and the Lord but let me do that instead of this preaching thing I choose that any day of the week I love it but I would never ever because of how much I love music ever put that above my love for the word or my love for Jesus Christ you might like to paint you might like to write poems you might like to do certain mechanical things or work on a farm or you might have some kind of love like that pleasure within itself is not bad but it's whenever the people take that and put that above the holy spirit so the people of the last day then that's been prophesied to have this type of anointing on them the last days of perilous times and incontinent and fears and things of that nature these are people that actually value their own selves above the things of God and you see to be a genuine Christian the one thing that we learn is that Christianity comes as a self-sacrificial life as Lambs of God or sheep of God we have been designed and created by God in a manner in which we can surrender our will surrender our desires and all of those things to the Lord now I know you know that and I'm just kind of rehearsing a moment things that you already know but the one aspect about surrender to God that I think people Miss sometimes brother Jim is the idea that the Lord Jesus Jesus in this surrender is not asking us to become a bunch of robotic people around this message I'm going to say something and I hope you take this right and I'm going to try to say it right and I hope that when I express this you don't think that I'm against Holiness or the things of God but like you look around our message and you see our girls and many of our girls when you look at them they've all got the same look to them same type of hairstyle same type of dresses same flat shoes or something like that now listen I'm not against Holiness or dressing holy before the Lord but if we're not careful we become a people that have manufactured Holiness in Christianity rather than having our individual Walk With Jesus Christ I I Marvel sometimes when I hear preachers telling me about girls curling their hair and how awful that is and and you know a woman wearing a pen on her on her on her sleeve or something like that and you see what we've done is we've tried to manufacture we've tried to reproduce Holiness based on what we like what we don't like but Holiness is not what you do it's what God does for you from the inside out that's why we have so much foolishness that runs around the rings to this message is because brother cars frankly man takes his own idea his own likes his own dislikes and pushes that on people as the doctrine of the Lord and then we wonder why our young people sit around the message confused and all of a sudden they hear a voice of clarity on the internet and that makes much more sense to them than what they hear in church it's our fault if they run out the doors it's our fault if people walk off from this truth because we are responsible to keep the smut off this message we are responsible to keep it clear to keep the message right and if there's any fault on people walking out the doors it's upon us because somewhere we have not done the thing that we should do to keep the standard of the Lord and to keep the message right before the people amen I know you ain't gonna like that you'll blame it on Bergens and the Collins boy and all the rest of that but listen we were in the hen house way before amen they did amen we were in we were the ones stealing the eggs way before the fox got in there amen come on somebody preached to me a little bit amen and we need to realize that any kind of disintegration of Faith or truth it always comes from the inside rather than the outside amen if we're walking where we should walk talking where we should talk and living like we should live surrender like we're surrendered amen my Bible tells me I am more than an overcomer if I am living by that word if I am surrendered to Jesus Christ there is nothing that can come against a child of God but what we don't have the answer for is amen stay with me a little while now you realize that the spirit of God is calling us to a total complete life of surrender I hope you understand that I hope you realize that when we talk about things like third pool manifestations of the sons of God we're talking about the return of the son of man Ministry the revealing of the son of man all of that is pointing to one attribute of a child to God and that's learning to surrender and yield ourselves to the mind and the will of God the one thing that we must learn to do before we get out of here that is to Humble ourselves to the point to where that even if I have a certain thought listen as a preacher I don't mind telling you it doesn't embarrass me to say this as a preacher I've been reading things in the Bible and shake my head and go that couldn't be right I've heard brother Brown say things and say he's crazy where does he get ideas like that human is speaking I've had my queries I've had my questions I've had my ponderings and my wonderings but the difference between someone like me and maybe some of the others is when I've got a question I am willing to let the word correct like me on whatever I believe amen somebody help me a little while I'm willing to let the Holy Spirit tell me this is his word this is what you're reading many times I'll be reading it wrong write words but wrong understanding have you ever been there you're reading the exact scripture you need to read but you're not reading it in the right eyes of the Holy Spirit and if you're humble and you're patient you wait on the Lord amen he can reveal that thing and straighten it out and spiritual standing right here and sitting tonight amen the same exact thing you hear Brother Adam say when he comes in hard doctrines now you just stop your tape right there get your Bible open and say sit before the Holy Spirit and let God reveal to you what I'm saying amen you know it's amazing even those people back in those days when brother Brown was alive they were pushing play and half of them didn't know how to obey right exactly Ryan amen robane comes by the gift of God in your life and that is a gift of surrender amen it is a Ministry that is given to the wife and her Administration is to surrender to God Amen we talk about gifts we talk about supernatural we talk about powers of God Amen I had a conversation some years ago with a fella that had come to the meeting here amen and he was telling me on on Facebook how that you know we need to come to the place to where the bride has great Supernatural powers to speak in tongues and prophesy and raise the dead I love all of that if somebody fell dead tonight I would love nothing more than to see the Holy Ghost anoint somebody to lay their hands on them and raise them up from the dead amen but I am not going to put the cart before the horse none of that can take place until I learn how to surrender everything that I am my mind my thoughts my personality my likes my dislikes my wants all of that must be surrendered to the Lord in order for great things to happen like that let me tell you why you struggle with preachers in the Pulpit because some of them ain't surrendered and when they preach to you you can feel it you can tell it you can't Bluff human beings if a man don't believe what he's talking about or he's trying to put over something on you amen you're smart enough to sit and appeal and feel it you know it but listen how beautiful is it when a man can surrender and you can surrender watch Holy Ghost just sweep through that congregation [Music] hallelujah amen and answer the needs of the people sitting in the pews it all comes to surrender amen I don't care how Talent a person is or how talented they might have all the gifts in the world to play and sing and whatever more but you take that person and let them just perform that gift rather than surrender it there's a difference in the music you hear they might hit some of the prettiest notes you've ever heard they might sing the best things you've ever heard brother Jim you know what I'm talking about amen but if you yields your hands and your mind your voice and what more to the Holy Ghost amen it's a different ring altogether amen why because it's not the gift amen you're not feeding off that gift the gift is to get yourself out of the way so the Holy Ghost can anoint it and Bless the people that's where healing comes from amen healing comes through things like music and singing and all of this but only if it's yielded to the Holy Ghost I've heard some of the best singers in the country sing with some played music for some of them and there's some of them that can only just be good singers they're not tools of ministry they're not tools of blessings they're not tools of ministering and giving to the people Divine Healing amen through the gifts and things that God given they're just good singers that's all they are amen or good preachers for that matter or whatever they might be amen what we need in the message of the hour is a return to good old-fashioned surrender to the Lord exactly right if we could get the preachers and all of us straightened out then we work on the people a little while right now listen to this amen let's turn to First Peter chapter 5 verse 5. now is you're working through this with me a little bit I want to take several verses here and uh we want to try by the help of the Lord our best to um uh to uh bring in a couple of things just from the Bible and and I got several places there if you'd like to write them down look at them later that's fine and uh if you would happen to miss something or you'd like some help in it let me know and I'll certainly share with you where I'm at Amen in the word of God and uh somebody uh please remind me there's a pastor in North Carolina him and his family are fighting the flu and we want to have prayer form at the end of the service when the we come to the end and the anointing was hearing things and uh somebody please remind me if you see me walk all this platform I don't pray but please remind me amen we want to just remember all of the sick and Afflicted and hold them before the Lord amen so first Peter 5 verse 5. now listen the Bible said likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay oh you know you can stop right there and there's a lot of the older ones and I'm not trying to hit at you tonight but a lot of them say yeah that's right you young people you need to surrender to us older people well older people just keep reading he said and all of you be subject one to another so it ain't just because they're old or because they've got a lot of experience or some teenage kid comes along and thinks they own the world and and and some kind of disrespectful thing like you know you young person need to pay attention to the older ones the older ones need to pay attention a little bit too listen I'm in a time of life where there's a whole generation underneath me that I don't understand them I don't know what they're facing I don't know how they're speaking I don't understand their language I got three girls in my house two of them are teenagers and sometimes I'm wondering if I need to pray for interpretation of tongues they talk with a language all of their own sometimes even little jokes and things they'll say I wonder what in the world are these kids saying but I was like that too when I was a teenager I had my own language and US older ones need to listen to that younger generation so we know how to be a blessing to them a lot of times we throw them off and cast them aside oh just a bunch of kids but the Bible said don't despise their youth amen they've got energy to serve the Lord they've got a feeling to serve the Lord they're not in that hardened place like a lot of us are with scars and battle scars and wounds and the Lord can do great things with them and I believe this is one reason why some of this younger generation is getting fed up with the message because they got a bunch of dictators sitting in the pews as they got some gray heads and some experience that think they ought to make everyone subject to them because they're older well who are you going to be subject to somebody got to be the boss around here and it ain't me and ain't no other preacher it's Jesus we've got to learn to be subject one to another anybody ever want to see a congregation from shout to pound to under two seconds get a picture right now oh I know I know that pinches you that that's disrespectful it's the truth and if we're paying attention to where we're at you need to understand that in order for the church to rise up and take her position we must learn to be subject one to another amen Tate brother here in his small family these good-looking boys sitting around here amen if he is not sensitive to the needs of these kids he'll lose them they'll get bitter against him and that you know Dad just don't get me and Dad don't understand that we're too quick sometimes to push people out because they don't dance our tune amen we have no Grace for people we see them fall into things and go into air and we become immediately critical but listen just because we've arrived at a station of life to where we're older and we don't have to listen or put up with it anymore that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be subject to those in the church body come on somebody preached to me that we should learn to be subject and know their need and feel the burden for them the same as everybody else amen even old people odd times and when I say old people now I'm talking the elderly the really uh 80s and uh things like that okay coming up into the time of life they're past that three score and ten that God give them and the Bible said if they're a widow indeed if they've washed feet if they've entertained Saints and things like that to consider them a widow and to bless them and be with them but a lot of times older people feel like I've come to the spot I can't do nothing for the Lord anymore I'm too old don't you never believe that if there is wind in your lungs God's give you a purpose amen right here tonight to be able to take what God's give you and submit it to somebody else amen the prophet of God Amen standing in front of a platform of thousands of people just a man in his 30s and 40s like me would dare stand and tell people with gray heads and everything else about his life story and dare say I want you to use my experiences as a stepping stone for what not to do and how to do better imagine that the gall the nerve the unmitigated boldness what was brethrenham trying to do exactly what the Bible said surrender himself one to another whatever experience he had it was his experiences and maybe it will help somebody I don't know about you but any man or woman that listens to the life story if you don't aren't in tears about three quarters of the way through it you are the hardest person that ever amen it does something to you it it affects you in a way to hear how this man missed the will of the Lord and how God Amen took his wife and his baby from him amen what a what a heartbreaking thing but you know what it does for me Amen to hear that man talk about him missing God Amen that I can be aware that if the Lord speaks to me I don't get off the hook either I can adjust myself to follow God's mind and the will of the Lord amen we should share our testimony don't forget we overcome by the blood of the lamb and our testimony I tell folks don't run around telling the young people all the time how much you drink and how much you run and how mean you was tell them how God saved him tell them how low down you was I might just just put it in a very simple way but how God reached to the lowest and pulled you out of there and gave you the Holy Ghost what I'm trying to say is no matter what you tell them give them hope give them hope that there is an answer amen because we're living in a generation of people that are having a hard time finding a place they fit in they're having a hard time finding a place that they can feel a part of a message of the hour and we stand up here as preachers and we quote from a man that preached in the 50s and the 60s to people living in 2022. and then we expect them to fit in with the program that's why they've got to find the mind of God and the only way they'll do that is if we submit ourselves one to another lift God up out of history and make him real right here tonight and see what a difference it makes in all of us amen I don't know where that come from but there it is amen good batter up there it is right now listen to this in First Peter 5 picking up verse six now he told us let's finish five actually he clothed be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and gives grace to the humble can you say Amen to them amen humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time now to be exalted by the Lord doesn't necessarily mean that God's going to put a spotlight on you and all of a sudden he's just going to raise you up to be some big guy or a big girl among the people but what he means by exalt here is in other words that God will help you raise to your position in Jesus Christ to rise up to meet the challenge that God's called you for praise the Lord I want that don't you I want God to help me raise to meet the challenge that's been placed before me but if I'm proud if I've got an arrogant Spirit if I've got the type of spirit on me like a narcissist that always wants everything their way and it's all about them if I've got that kind of spirit on me the spirit of Christ I have not because no one was such a proud arrogant attitude like that amen is ever going to tell me that the Holy Ghost is dwelling inside that heart the first thing God does when he gives you the baptism the Holy Ghost is he gives you humility amen especially if you've been a sinner A ranked Center and the amazing grace of God Saves you to come out of that and to come into the Glorious Grace of his gospel amen what it must do for a heart amen that's been out in the world and been through hell on this Earth and all of a sudden God saved them it should change the way we even feel about ourselves but the real story comes back to this scripture here humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that's a hard thing to do now when I say this this is not meant to be an unchristianizing thing but I'm saying this because we must be responsible for all of our movement amen our corner of the world's our corner of the world but remember we represent something to people and the people of God must be the most surrendered group on the face of the planet amen and you know it's sad in other ways when you see people in their own religions way more committed to what they believe than we are to what we believe I'm challenging you tonight I hope you're able to raise to the challenge but we should be a living example of what God has projected through that Prophet about that what the Christians should be what our life should look like and that we should be Billboards for Jesus Christ and the only way you can project that Hallelujah is through the ministry of surrender amen you may not have any other Ministry in your life but this ministry is what God gave to a wife the ministry to surrender herself yield herself to the things of God you say well brother Ben I am yes but that's just the one time you're thinking of you're thinking of maybe just a an everyday well I Just Surrender every day but it goes even deeper than that amen you got to go even deeper than just an everyday surrender amen you've got to come to the place to where you don't even have to try to surrender or continue to surrender you got to go deeper than that it's just an automatic I am surrendered amen trying to accomplish it's one thing but being surrendered is an entirely different thing altogether folks how do you think brother Brown was able to accomplish what he did speak squirrels and talk to storms and everything else because he was a surrendered man to the Lord hallelujah amen think about him when he spoke to that storm in Colorado walking down through there and the Holy Ghost said would you like to walk with me amen imagine what that must have been like for brother Branham knowing that he'd just come out of that death trap up there amen and he was stand up here in that mountain the Holy Ghost said go back up into that thing now I don't know about you but if I'm standing there looking at that storm like that my first impression is not going to be listen to that my first impression will be I've lost it I better get out of here but the prophet of God said he said I went around that tree and he said pulled my hat off and I heard I am the creator of the heavens and the Earth he said I've heard that voice my whole life amen in other words he was so surrendered to God that even if it would have meant death he was willing to go do what God wanted him to do now you see people with quote books in their arm and in the old days running around you know now they've got tablets and the message around and they'll throw quotes around left and right amen we've got a lot of good preachers we've got a lot of big churches a lot of good movement but we don't have enough surrender amen you say well we do do we is there if we got enough surrender tell me why people are getting discouraged and not coming to church all the time and why they can't sit under and submit themselves to Godly pastors tell me why people walk around in mental depressions and oppressions all the day long and why they're taking one nerve pill after another come on somebody talk to me why we've got the word but we don't have enough surrender to it that's what God needs out of us somebody's going to help me preach tonight amen I'm coming on with it anyways or not amen that's right we need it need that more than we need anything else a Ministry of surrender humble yourself so in other words if you're proud God resists you be a preacher be whoever it is if you're proud God will resist you I don't want him resisting me I don't want him to be resistant to my nature or my spirit or my soul whatever part of me might I want God to see that he can use me folks do you understand this is one reason why people have a hard time worshiping like they should in church they're willing to give their soul to God to be saved they're willing to give their human spirit and things for God to clean up their memory and give them good dreams and let them sleep well but then they come to the house of God and they've got rain over their hands and their eyes and their mouth and then preachers have to holler come on somebody come on somebody come on somebody you know why we do that because they're not really surrendering what we are so we can worship like we should amen and amen it's exactly right now you can say oh well but in the house of the Lord I I'm a quiet natured person honey let the Holy Ghost get a hold of you one time he'll run all that foolishness out of you there's no such thing as a quiet person even yourselves right now are vibrating higher than what you could ever measure it amen the Bible said your thoughts in heaven ring louder than your mouth does here on the earth no such thing as a quiet person it's an excuse we make because we don't want to give him our hands we don't want to give him our mouth to worship God why that's too Pentecostal oh there's no I'll tell you one thing it might be that but the Bible said amen the joy of the Lord is my strength and maybe if we had a little bit more of that in the house of God maybe we'd leave out them doors feeling like we've been to church for a change right amen instead of feeling like we've been sitting in a lecture in this hour all night words Amen in case you forgot it amen I remembered if you need help but just don't forget it now right you say but that's that's hard preaching yes but it's where we're living at I mean I I know people are resistant to things they say well I hear what all the man says before I say Amen you don't have the Holy Ghost you mean the Holy Ghost can't tell you if that guy's honored or ain't the problem is we weigh too much out because what we're really saying I want that man to move me God ain't here to let me or nobody else move you you're the one that's a priest you're the one that's under obligation to offer your spiritual sacrifices to Christ amen I'm telling you right there's not enough good good preaching or whatever in the world to move some people because they're stubborn and they're stubborn and to be stubborn is to be a witch whoo praise the Lord brother man somebody saw the United States church because they were led by a witch why Rebellion is what leads a lot of these churches you watch them around the ranks of this message what young people and older people the man goes preaching right down their alley they'll tighten up on him they'll hold her amen's back let him say what they want him to say and let him get out there and preach what they like and boy they'll tear the house down but you rub them the wrong way you see a green-eyed monster don't you tell me that you're surrendered to God you're not when the Holy Ghost comes down your eye away and skins your heart that's when the bride should be Holland amen even louder amen Lord I believe it's the truth the man or woman is surrendered ain't no such thing as hard preaching well he's a hard preacher he looks he said that that's because you surrendered amen now listen to this a message for the meanest man that could come to me to this day but a bride veils her face why the man is her head and then she has no uh reason the church is not ahead and that's Christ tells us to be clothed when he says that we are to be veiled how are we supposed to be veiled in humility the humility of the Bride of Jesus Christ The Veil that she wears over herself the veil of humility is a sign that he's the boss he's in charge you want to know who runs this house my husband runs his house she's veiled with humility to show that you say but brother Ben what's that got to do with anything all right listen when the tear and the wheat come to their full manifestation you you farmers in here know what I'm talking about you ever watch a wheat when it comes closer to maturity if that tear is growing right up with that wheat the the wheat will bow its head down like this and that Terror will stay straight up in the air that Pride that lives exists in that person that little inferiority complex that they think they're a big shot when they're not right that's something that lives inside that person amen don't you know where that comes from it comes from the Devil Satan was the first one to exalt himself lift himself up put himself up in Pride Chimes have to be some great something amen but Jesus Christ ever moves in the human heart it makes us humble down you know and I'll show you how simple this is sometimes you know you take a wife you know and husbands have a hard time submitting to their wives that they're command men you know the boss of the home you know and they don't want to go shopping or they don't want to let her have a say or they won't let her have an opinion and they don't like something glory to God I'm the man of the house you might be the man of the house do you have a responsibility to remain humble sometimes men you just need to shut this and open him God give you two of these and one of these I figured the sisters would be shouting about right now but come on sometimes you just need to listen up listen up and shut up and let them have a say let them have an opinion but oh we're the men of the house that is the devil's way of dominating a home any woman that lives by the grace of God and that man treats her right he doesn't have to force her to surrender she wants to I feel the same about Jesus I don't want to come into the house of God but the host I don't want him to have to force me or scare me or intimidate me or hang me over hell or you better get right now Ben or I'm going to send you to the reach of the law no he loves me in such a way that I just want to serve it with all of my heart give him everything I God's what I want to do you don't have to force us he just loves us right into that situation now I don't say sometimes that you don't have to take a stand in your home and that you don't have to have a principle I know better than that but let's face facts we have allowed ourselves to get sucked in to a society of men in the message that are nothing less than a bunch of unconverted dictators and these women in this message they sit and endure a bunch of preaching about their hair and her dress and their thoughts and their this and that and these preachers let these rotten men sit in these people don't say a word about them before there was ever a bad woman there has to be a bad some man somewhere oh you say that ain't true go back in the Garden of Eden who got to Eve first man or woman go back to questions and answers brother man said the serpent was a man that man perverted a woman's life amen Real Son of God doesn't make a doormat out of her he loves her into the situation yes I know love is corrective but my god when do we come to the place to where we start just laying aside some of that foolishness I know people married 40 years sometimes they still the cats and dogs and then people always blame the woman well if she was submissive who knows Big Mouth the reason she's doing it is because you won't be submissive maybe she's got a little fight in her and won't put up with you big boy where's this coming from by the way help me right surrendering yourself to the Lord amen not a dictator preachers are not to be overlords over the house of God they take the oversight but they're not to Overlord over the people amen a bunch of preachers run around saying but you better see it the way I see it or you'll wind up in hell who showed it to you God showed it to the preacher so he's surrendered to God the same as the people should be surrendered to God right our mission is not to point ourselves to ourselves it's appointed to Jesus Christ amen do you believe that's true amen amen as brothers say when people listen to the radio don't turn your set off on me I turned out amen hang in all right second chronic chapter 34 verse 27 now the Lord speaking to Israel here and he's giving them a kind of a uh like a praise or some kind of an encouragement to say and second Chronicles 34 27 because thine heart was tender thou does humble thyself before God well now notice his words against this place and it's the inhabitants thereof huh before me and did run thy clothes and wept before me I have even heard also saith the Lord now the Jews in their particular time whenever they were going to Humble themselves or chastise himself before the Lord many times they get in the dirt and grab a bunch of dirt and rub it on their face they would Rim their clothes they'd rip out their beard they would lay in sackcloth and Ashes they were showing God in a physical way that they were surrendered to his will to his mind they wanted God to see we are serious about you being in control forgiving us and taking over we have an equivalent of that today in the 21st century we call it giving your life for God like this amen maybe fasting from time to time having a prayer life taking time to come to church paying your tires and your offerings moving bitterness out of your heart loving God no matter what's going on around you and trusting the Lord our sacrifice and our humbling may not be exactly like it was and then with the Jews but when I come to the house of God and I give him my mouth and I give him my hands and I give him my worship and then when I walk out to him back doors amen I keep fighting the good fight and I sacrifice my life amen I'm doing the same thing that them Jews did when they would pull their beer down and if he heard them and brother bam said if he ever did it one time he's got to do it the same the next if he heard them he'll hear us hallelujah if we'll humble ourselves down then God can hear from heaven and straighten out many of our problems I think what we've done is we've come to the place to where we have such a deep knowledge of stuff we know so much about the message about history about the prophet we know so much about churches and how churches offering we become so dependent upon our own personal knowledges of things that we forget God is still in control of the universe he feeds sparrows and I don't even have it in my budget to feed one he lets the Earth turn around and I never even wake up and worry about it he takes care of everything if we let him have the control of life and everything else you'll find out it'll work a whole lot better when you let him be the boss let's just say I've got kids that are lost grandkids are lost I got family members that aren't saved amen but if you give them to God if you humble yourself down Amen to let God do the work you'll find out very quickly that every time you take it back in your hands you make it worse a lot of times the only thing you can do is just surrender it to the Lord and say God you see it you see it you know it you understand where it's at and I'm trusting you to take over and do the right thing in Psalm chapter 10 verse 17. now the Bible said Lord thou has heard of the humble now how many wants God to hear your desire well how does well now listen he said thou will prepare their heart thou will cause thine ear to hear so in other words when my desire is to say God you see the certain need or this certain thing every what it is your Bible said if I desire that if I believe you when I pray I'll receive it but if my desire doesn't align with his desire you might as well forget about it that's why we always pray first thy will be done as it is in heaven so let it be in the Earth or me and if I Surrender that to God in the right way and say all right Lord this is what I want this is what I think is necessary this is what we need this is the thing and I Surrender that and he says all right sounds great to me I think it's fine praise the Lord in Hallelujah I move right on in the will of God and receive what I'm asking for but if the Lord has a problem with it if he takes exception to it then that's where a lot of times we start falling into that category of trying to make it happen well I'm already in trouble I might as well just go ahead and clinch the nail we try to force it into a corner and say well I I think I can make this fit we'll come up with every quote in the world I mean you just watch whenever Kamala got voted in down there in her purple clothes every person in the message throwing a woman in purple woman in purple how do you know that's her you don't know anymore and I do you're guessing like I am and frankly I'm not waiting on something like that what I'm looking for is I'm looking for Ben to get lined up then to get straightened out been to get surrendered in the right way amen I'm not worried about what this world economy is going to do I'm not a part of this Cosmos out here I'm looking for what Christ will have us do I mean I understand people are curious fine but that's what I mean but if they can't make that work they'll try to take that square of Peg and shove it around the hole and try to make the thing fit I've heard people do that when it comes to marriages and remarriages and divorcing and everything else in the world I mean they've got a stack of quotes like this to prove why they're allowed to do the thing they already know they shouldn't do but this is what I'm talking about if we're surrendered to Christ in the right way if we surrender our life to them the right way and I have a desire for something and the Lord says no I need to be okay with that I need to be okay that he said no to me and I need to be willing to accept that he has the higher judgment and the higher authority he has the wisdom to know where that thing's going to lead and where it ain't going to lead and there are many many times in my life I'm looking back now a lot of times in my life just the last few months I've been thinking about certain little things that I really wanted to see happen I wanted to take place and now things are beginning to manifest in a way that now look I say if that would have happened look where I'd have been I'm talking about messes explosions disasters flaming disasters all around you and if I would have been able to go that direction it would have been a mess and I'm thankful I stand here tonight A grateful and thankful man to God that the Lord didn't always answer every prayer I put before him he knows what's best for us amen sure well you say but God gives us that as I want to see my my kids saved and my family saved and I want to see I understand where you're coming from I get that but I can't save me any more than you can save them or though yourself the only thing we can do is commit it to the Lord and ask God to let things happen all in place to give us the desires of his heart of our heart notice again in Proverbs chapter 16 19 better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoils with the proud now you see when brother Branham was told by his mother-in-law that the Pentecostal people was trash the problem that God took with that wasn't so much that listen you go back in history and look the Pentecostal people were trash in the eyes of the world they were the scum of the earth people looked at them they were poor and they were ignorant and they were unlearned had no Prestige about them or just all kinds of things but but the thing of it was his mother-in-law was trying to make them people beneath brother Branham and God took exception to that once brother Branham learned that he was going to pray for Kings amen you imagine how some of them people looked at brother Branham coming there with no education he was certainly beneath them as far as the way of the world goes but God didn't see it that way God didn't see that a king or a monarch was more powerful or better in some way than brother Brennan was amen why he allowed that man who he prayed for the king Amen to surrender himself to each other amen and this is what I'm saying if we got to be careful of this idea like with young people we can't look at young people and feel like they're beneath us listen to me church if we do that we'll lose our young people can't look at them as though they're a second class citizen can't look at other people as though they're beneath us well they don't have the Revelation I do and they know the message as long as I have well praise the Lord I'll get your gold star and your cookie for you after church to say the thing of seniority who's been in it the longest and who was in brother branham's meetings this is a life a Ministry of surrender one to another amen we should submit ourselves do you understand that many of you people in here I'm talking about you women do you understand that there's only certain things that men can do in talking to you you're limited in Sister Vice Versi you're limited how how deep of a conversation you can have with a man you're the opposite sex you ought not be talking real deep intimate things with each other and a man has only a limited knowledge and outside looking in knowledge of what it might be for a woman to go through that ever what it might be some female thing or female troubles or women problems or whatever it might be amen but how wonderful it is to know that there are sisters in the church that's been through that but are willing and open to say you're not beneath me I'll come talk to you about it think about the power of the church how unified how knitted together we could be if we just learn to surrender ourselves one to another run just because everybody don't do things the way that we think should be done does not give up all right to radar Fellowship from them no you say what's on the basis of the word then make it on the basis of all of it not just little pet parts little selected Choice parts that we choose right about all of it so better it is to be of a humble spirit with the low then divide spoils with the proud right again Proverbs 29 23 a man's Pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit so how are we going to be honorable through humility she will bring us to a plane amen humility will bring them to a true place of honor in the humidity will do it oh never saw that before amen Isaiah chapter 57 15. now speaking I said but that's the high and the lofty one that inhabitth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit so God said you want to dwell with me if you've got a contrite and humble spirit you don't dwell down there you dwell up here with me no longer Paul said we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right notice to revive the spirit of the humble to revive the heart of the right ones now imagine what this is this is Revival we talk about the bride's Revival coming it'll take him seven unknown Thunders to wake her up Brad hasn't had a Revival yet it'll take the mysteries of God unfolding to wake her up he said we talk about great things happening amongst the body signs and wonders missing limbs being restored ananiasis Safari returning but he said I only bring that Revival to those that are of a humble and contrite spirit so if we want bride's Revival this is the road to get in through true humility to the Lord now you say what does that look like any idea any thought any notion any desire anything that is of you I owe you it must be offered to him as a sacrifice of praise and as a presenting my body a Living Sacrifice unto him that whatever I am I'm willing to give it to him no matter what it is you realize one reason why people don't get any further than what they get sometimes they're just not willing to go that far but you see you know you'll have this this attitude a lot of times folks run into the owner and they'll scream and they'll holler and I'm not against that I don't mind if they're scream and holler but as long as they're there if they surrender themselves while they're there then that screaming Harlem will follow them out the door help me somebody the problem is you get emotional up here unless some preacher pray for you get emotional and that's all it was was emotion but you didn't allow it to be a surrendered experience to the Lord you can sit right here on these pews and I have no doubt in my mind just let the word penetrate your heart let it penetrate your soul and purpose in your heart God I may not get that perfect tomorrow but I'm willing to surrender to that truth and watch God change you setting right there and impuse but we got the wrong idea so what we do is we have big revivals and big meetings we get everybody shouting and running and crying and get them up here and they'll slide into the Altar and people are praying or crying or Screaming I love that but I've seen more trouble caused by that than I've seen good happen by them you know why because the instruction needs to be the only reason you're coming up there is because you're calling on help to help you get delivered and calling on help to get you in a place of surrender the Bible said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if a man lays his hands on you it is not him that has the ability or the healing or anything he is only confirming that me and that patient is willing to surrender to God's word lay hands on the sick they shall recover I'm surrendering my symptoms I'm surrendering my doubt I'm surrendering my fears I'm surrendering the doctor's report I'm surrendering all the circumstances around me to believe God Is My Healer so we have big revivals and preachers preach real fast and loud and hard and run all over the building and then they get everybody shouting and jumping and running out the back door and I promise you if it's not Blended and married together with surrender all you've done is reproduce modern-day Pentecost and God hates the thing he wanted to throw it up he said it was lukewarmness when he saw that revivals have nothing to do with emotion oh somebody didn't like that well let me say it again then revivals are not produced by emotion revivals are when all of that trash in your life is now surrendered to the Lord the trash surrenders to the lake it surrenders to the churning and the bubbling of the lake it surrend us to God and the trash is washed out of there that is real bride's Revival but you get a bunch of people running around the country and around North America and Holland you know God's bringing a Revival to the people he'd been doing us as brother Brown left the place no it ain't a bunch of Select ministers around this message or a small group a circle of people that's bringing some new great no all they've learned to do is tap into the emotion of the people we don't need your emotions tapped in we need to teach you how to surrender to the word that's already been preached here young people you sitting here tonight you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost let brother Ben tell you how to get there surrender yourself to God that's that simple amen we've made it such a long drawn-out process if you're backslid on God how do I get back Surrender Your Life to God surrender your sins to God surrender your thoughts and your feelings of I can't do it and I'll never be there and I've went too far just quit trying to reason it out and just surrender that up to him and say God it ain't my business know how you take over the Bible said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you know what that repentance really shows it shows someone who is willing to surrender their old self to God not just the old self but the whole self that's the purpose of Acts 2 38 when I go to the water and I'm baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I am confessing that I am dead and I'm surrendering my new life to Jesus Christ I don't care what their name is or how far they think they've gone Holy Ghost is sitting right here tonight waiting on you to just simply surrender all that Let Me Go a step further you're sitting here with a bunch of flexes and a bunch of fears and you can't seem to get out of the mess that's inside this mind of yours amen you've tried every self-help book in the world you've listened at podcasts you've talked to Saints you've read and watched everything on YouTube you can get your hands on but you still can't get free and you still can't get delivered let me tell you what your answer is just surrender all that mess to God and say Lord You're gonna have to take over from here amen it's too big for me to handle this too much for me I get out to the one that can do the job I've come to a place in my life where I realize I am not able to whip everything that comes my way sometimes I'm too weak and I'm okay with that I'm okay with that Revelation it's all right with me if I don't have all supreme power and authority and can handle every situation and always know the answers I'm okay with that as long as I know how to yield myself to him and say now Lord you see that this is why the Bible said when you've done everything you can to stand just stand there to stand out and wait on him just wait on him and let him show you what the next move is amen what a powerful thing it is for the bride of Christ to understand the minute surrender James 4 and 6 he gives more grace oh I like that amen he don't just give us Grace but he gives us more grace amen for he resists the proud and gives grace to the humble amen you want Grace tonight it comes to humility amen the Bible said so James 4 10 humble yourself in the sight of the Lord he'll lift you up now listen to this and questions and answers they asked brother ran him a question says I can't give over completely to Jesus have I an evil spirit now listen to this answer he said now let me spend the rest of the time on that there he said you can't surrender to Jesus he said I don't know if this is a man or woman I can't tell which it is God knows that but you can't surrender to Jesus why what's the matter if you're a woman don't you have to surrender your husband to be a wife surrender all that you are a little lady when you're married virtuous follow your life to stay virtuous but one day you found a man that you loved you were his completely the things you'd fought for all your life he said now you put yourself completely in his hands I love that amen he said that's right all you stood for in decency moral and everything like that and now you turn it over to this man because you surrender yourself you can't do the same thing for Jesus Christ Just Surrender yourself that way all that I am all my mind all my thoughts he said I don't think you're possessed of an evil spirit but I think an evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts trying to make you think you cannot surrender yourself to God and I want to go on record right here tonight and say that anybody sitting in this building tonight anybody that'll stream this service anybody under the sound of my voice that would ever allow the devil to tell them that they have no ability to surrender to God Amen God sent me to tell you tonight amen it's a light it's not the truth and you have the ability to surrender to God they're who you are I don't care what your purpose of life is or how far you've went out and done this or I don't care what the back story is amen I have been given the ability to surrender to oh somebody help me amen I've been given the ability to surrender to God never let the devil tell you otherwise oh you said but I've served the Lord many years yes that means that there's many more surrenders to come then we should even be deeper in a life of surrender we should dig even deeper into these things of surrendering ourselves to God right and the attitude becomes well I just can't do it and the reason we think that way is because there's some worldly desire or some kind of pull of the flesh or some kind of lust to the eyes that's overtaken us and overwhelming us and we just give up to that thing over and over you know why you're giving up to it because you keep surrendering yourself to it amen but take that thing and surrender it back to Jesus Christ and give him the ability you say well if I mess up do it again tomorrow what happens the next day do it again the next day what if I mess up 10 years from now just keep on surrendering don't worry about it Abraham the body change will come eventually I'd rather be found never achieving it but fighting for it than to give up completely and let the devil have his way amen I feel like shatter at me Shaq and Abednego sometimes when it comes to me I don't know if God's going to deliver me or not but I know this much I am bound down to it I'm not giving up to that thing I don't care what it costs certain desires certain things certain pools certain this that and the other amen at the end of the day I may never overcome it completely I may go to my grave fighting certain things in my life but I'm like I'm like shout at me shake it a minute ago I don't know if he'll deliver me out of this fire but I'm not bowing to it either that's a life of surrender we've got to be so surrendered that we're willing to even lose right because some won't always let us win everybody there'll be some fights you'll lose he'll let you lose battles from time to time I see that's a much different type of preaching than that good one-liner stuff I guess they're going whoa oh yeah I'm gonna win every battle somebody's lying to you more than likely you'll lose a lot more on your win that's when a real Soldier has to be dedicated to the Army only ones that ever fought down through history that ever won anything there were some of the biggest losers on the street but they didn't give up they kept fighting their way through it no matter how much they might have lost or went down and one fellow said to me I'm on my 14th I'm one I said keep fighting keep going right now watch I love this in the resurrection of Jesus Christ brother Adam says it like this he said now if a person completely can surrender themselves to the devil and he will give them twice their strength what will happen if a man completely surrenders him God we crippled up can't stand up he's up to God he gets new life and new strength comes in he goes walking away but think of it not just the physical part of it but imagine many of you sitting here tonight and I saw a moment ago when I hit that Court about nervous oppression thing I saw faces lighten up so let me take a minute on this let me say this to you that if God can give a man that has broken ankles or disabled ankles or something the strength and leap like at the gate beautiful and come on how much more can God give you strength right here and right here in your human spirit in your memory in your imagination all them nervous thoughts that keep you tore up through the Dead all of that that that anxiety that you experience on a daily basis if God can give a man the ability to walk or a woman to walk out of a wheelchair out of a cotter stretch or something like that how much more could God take your mental capacity and put strength in it to overcome somebody help me I'm telling you that God ain't just here just to raise the dead but he's wanting to raise your expectation he wants to raise your Hallelujah he wants to raise your way of thinking he wants to elevate resurrect your belief in what God can do through you we've allowed the devil society and everything else to bury our confidence in the word of God we've allowed backsliders and bad preachers and bad churches and bad bad we've allowed that to intimidate us until the people of God don't have confidence like they should I don't care if ten thousand fall around my feet God is still God in heaven he's still the same yesterday in forever I don't care what person comes our way to mess this thing up we've still got a God in Israel he's still a God of War and he can teach my hands how to find he can teach my mind how to find he can teach my heart how to believe but I got to surrender to get there how weak we've become by allowing Satan to take from us the very strength that God gives us I don't mind telling you and I mean this sincerely that many times we don't have possibly the understanding of how to get there I understand that I get that I hear people tell me all the time well brother Ben I believe but I don't know how to get there I understand that too but that's the point I'm trying to make the beauty of this is you don't have to you don't have to figure out when this thought comes what do I do here when that guy comes in you just step back and say Lord You're The One fighting the battle not me and I'll pick up my sword and fight when you want me to but until I get strength to do it until this arm can that arm of faith can pick it up and fight I need your help to get me through this amen think of some of you sitting in here how many times you battle even trying to go to sleep at night because that mind's going around in a thousand directions do you understand the devil's taking something from you God promised to you he promised that you would have sleep do you know the bible promises everything that he'll rest now if you let the devil take your arrest from you it's time for you to start fighting to take it back it's mine by God's grace when I rest and rejuvenate my body I can be the Lord at my best potential but we allow the mind to overtake us and whether we admit this or not we become crippled right here we're just as disabled as some poor old fella laying in a wheelchair that can't hardly raise his arms we don't have the mental ability to be able to take that word into our mind or you say it's not about intellect hold on the prophet said it ain't mind over matter but he said if you take that word into your mind the word you take into your mind has power to reproduce itself and if I take that word into my mental mind it will drop Faith we'll get a hold of it in a drop into my soul and it will produce something out of there hey man I can stand here and say I'm a car I'm a car I'm a car my mind will never over the matter and make me a car amen but if I take his word in my mind that says I'm more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ I may not get it today but that word has power to reproduce itself amen and it will produce that out of my life if I let him do it praise His holy name the word is what's got the power in it and you've got to surrender learn to surrender of Truth that's the process God knows what he's doing trust the process stats of a perfect man so when you surrender your complete being he said then the Holy Spirit just pours through you and these virtues and things he said then you become a living Tabernacle again when we take like the virtues of the Lord see all of those things you know we we almost get like a uh almost like a checklist of how we're going to become perfect you know we work a little while all right Faith got it moving on to the next thing then we worked for a while and we say all right virtue I'm there let's move on to knowledge but see all of these things come from a new birth all of this this is not the statue of a perfect gourd or Ben or John or Susie or silent this is the statue of Jesus Christ this is his nature inside of you and all are working constantly constantly working through your heart faith is growing a little virtue's growing a little knowledge and all these things are working you all of them at the same time until all of them will finally Express until Jesus can set himself down on you as a seal of approval that is my son and daughter but brother Branham said in order for the Holy Spirit to pour through them virtues it takes surrender to get there I'm just going to go ahead and say this I know I can feel it while I'm preaching the thought keeps rebounding we don't need this we're already surrendered people we're beyond all of this shame on you that goes to prove you need even more surrender for even thinking such a way no Christian has such a rotten attitude like that I've been feeling you I don't know who you are but the Lord has shown me I'll walk to your pew no we don't need that kind of attitude the attitude we've got to take upon ourselves is like this God no matter how smart I think I am in this truth no matter how fur along down the road I am I need more of this in my life I need to be more surrendered to Jesus Christ than I've ever been in my life God knows that this quote is laying right there before us and I'm going to quote it to you patma's Vision brother Brown said a man that is fully surrendered to God is omnipotent but he's got to be fully surrendered first we love that statement when two omnipotents meet something's got to shake but in order for you to reach that omnipotence you've got to be fully surrendered to God why do you think women dress the way they dress why do you think you sisters behave and brothers behave the way you behave your your action your behavior is showing your surrender to the Lord this is why we don't believe in women cutting their hair and man running around like when I was in Jamaica Rastafarians down there with that long hair like that I burnt them up too didn't I says y'all was there yes sir God knows that the attitude we've got to have about things is not this mechanical manufactured attitude well if I go to church and I believe brother Brown I'm and I'm going to achieve something that's what you're missing no matter how much you might be sitting in that car and that machine may have the potential of taking you down the road until that mechanic surrenders itself to the spark you won't you'll be sitting right in the garage and that's what people have done for 60 years now do you realize that this message has outlived brother Branham he died in his 50s we're going into 60 years now the message itself has outlived the prophet of God if we go another 40 years what's it going to look like in our churches we're almost a spot now to where when you try to preach the gospel to people they shouldn't get mad at you think about it I'm not saying about me tonight I'm saying in general oh I don't like the way he probably I don't like the way and you were surrendered we're surrendered with that attitude Ryan it goes to prove we've got a long way to go again and that we need the Holy Spirit to help us get to this place of surrender amen listen again I love this in the token I wonder today when God leads us to a life of complete surrender and service to him I wonder if our Spirits don't sometimes kind of rebel I'll man for the rest of you because it's true for me he said and then we wonder are we Lambs a lamb is obedient a lamb is self-sacrificial it doesn't claim its own or take its own it can lay right down hear the wolf off at the only thing he said it sacrifices everything it's got that's a lamb he said it gives it is and that's the way a real Christian is self-sacrifice themselves carrying nothing for this world but giving all they got to almighty God now you think about when it comes to things like knowing the will of God let me just give you an example in Ephesians 1 9 Paul said that he's made known unto us the mystery of his will you realize that many times even the will of God is something that's slowly unfolded to you he doesn't show you everything imagine if God would show you that in 10 years from now you'd be sitting in this church without a leg or be blind or someone you really love would be dead and they'd be taken to some horrible accident how would you worship God how would you serve God how would you come to church how would you read your Bible knowing that was laying ahead of you you see many times the grace of God don't reveal things to us because it's his grace keeping us right on the same Target right on the same pathway so we can keep our eyes single and keep marching right onto the gold I know some people say Well it wouldn't matter to me I'd serve him anyways yeah you talk tough when you're sitting on this side of it but when things confront you when you're faced with a confrontation of life and loss and sorrows and everything else in the world Amen it it affects people to a place it's where they can't serve God like they want to I don't care what anybody says you hit a hard trial it affects you humanly it makes you doubt yourself doubt God doubt the message doubt the pastor doubt everybody it puts you in a place where you're not even sure whether you got the goods or not and if God always showed us everything that was coming down the road brother Jose imagine if you would have known that that great sickness the Lord delivers you from imagine if you known that was coming down the road how would it have affected maybe the way you even read your Bible you might have got frustrated and Through the Bible it says what's the point but God don't show His prophets everything God don't show his children everything so he slowly unfolds his will he lets us know just enough to keep our eyes on the prize so that faith can take over somebody help me tonight so faith can take the right place and we can march on knowing that no matter what we're going to face he's there to get us I love to say this we always focus on tomorrow but don't forget before tomorrow arrives he's already there before tomorrow shows up God's already there and you realize this is the reason why annoying the will of God watch brother random when he goes through all of that with his family he goes into that room and there's Sharon Rose Lander she's eight months old imagine an eight-month-old baby he's not only suffered and preached on the streets and went through all kinds of persecutions for what brother Branham feels in his heart as the will of God but I looks at his baby and he looks at that baby and it's got one little blue on the cross he looks down at it and he said he'd like to kill him and he said I tried to talk to the Lord and said the Lord pulled the curtain in front of me now you know if a lot of people would have known what brother Branham was known imagine if he'd known hope and Sharon Rose is going to go that way the moment his mother-in-law spoke to him he would have said lady you crazy you think I'm going to listen to you do you know what's coming down the road for me if I don't but God didn't show brother Running Man he let him go through that time even the devil talked to him and said you've preached on the streets and done all this said there's your baby laying there dying now think of it he said after that happened he said of the tens of thousands of cross-eyed children that come on the platform he said not one didn't walk off without their healing yeah brother Brown would have known that he may not have been discouraged looking at Sharon Rose but God in his will will only sometimes open up just enough for us the fight will be right there in front of us and we don't know the outcome of the fight we don't know what it's going to produce but God lets it mold us to a place to where it's going to shape something in us for later on I guarantee you not one thing after that happened there was never a mother-in-law the one nothing mother-in-law's on the planet to try but get brother Bram out of the will of God then watch him in South Africa down there when those preachers got him out of the will of God you see the Lord Jesus knew that at one point in brother Ram's life the word was going to come open you listen to him when the opening of the word happens brother Adam said he read every commentary he read every that's why some of these people run around here The Defector people say rather than plagiarize I wish to God they knew what that meant when you plagiarize something you don't tell people where you got it from yeah brother when I was a plagiarizer he was the worst version of a plagiarizer could ever be he told everybody where he got everything he told us where he was reading after swindley and Knox and Calvin and Finney and and and all the rest of them you know he told us where where those circles come from up there he told us he got that from Larkin he said but when the Holy Spirit wrote it on the back he said I left a little light there God even corrected brother Branham and Larkin at the same time because the version on the back wall was a lot better than the one he had on the front wall God completely blacked out the age altogether he said what I'm trying to say to you is that when this prophet's message was going to come open he had to be in a place to where no one could move him from the will of God so the will of the Lord took him through many deep valleys and many hard times of having to feel the sting of going his own way you imagine every time you turn on a television Setter or pull up on the Internet some of these preachers out there that are starting to say oh somebody in Texas has got back trouble I'm feeling now that somebody's got a pain and brother ram calls that the angel of the Lord told him you tried to explain that discernment you caused carnal impersonations and that's been reverberating for 60 years now William Branham calls that but God put it in such a way to when the prophet did that amen when it come to the third pool listen how careful he is he said I've hid some things in my heart and I'll take it to my grave with me I don't believe it was some great secret that nobody was allowed to know but him but I think what he was trying to show us is he come to a place of such surrender that he wasn't just going to let everything out until the Lord told him it was okay to let it out I've got secrets in my heart I'm going to take to the Grave too one of them is my new birth that Holy Ghost that lives inside of me that's a secret I'm taking To My Grave God knows what my experience is that's an experience that I've got with God nobody can shape me from being that I wasn't born again nobody can talk me out of that foundation and I've come to the place by the grace of God not even me can convince me that I don't have the Holy Ghost but you don't get there overnight you get there by the Lord slowly unfold things to you the will of God is a challenging thing for people because they want to know God's will right now and sometimes he don't do that sometimes you got to wake up in the morning put that foot forward and wait get up and put that foot forward and wait but they that wait on the Lord they shall renew their strength and mount up with wings of eagles it goes to prove surrender is the key if I'm surrendered if you're surrendered then we could soar into the Heavenly places the confidence of God amen let me read you one thing before we quit listen he said he is the head of the body Colossians 1 18 the beginning the firstborn of the day that in all things he might have the preeminence because you see the problem with a lot of this kind of preaching like this is when we hear God wants the preeminence we think of a dictator somebody that's going to force us into being the boss but that's not the key to Christianity the key to Christianity is let go and let God have this wonderful way how does a man preach out of anointing how is he doing does he studied deeply is he learned how to say certain catch phrases does he you know excite himself into some kind of an anointing you know what he does he comes to the platform he starts letting go he just starts surrendering his mouth and his mind I've lost count of the times that I'll be 30 minutes into a sermon I'm going how we get here it isn't a coincidence when you surrender yourself the Lord people will operate the gift in you the Holy Ghost will take you all kinds of places and take you right down the line of where people are sitting there I have no doubt in my heart or mind everything I've said here tonight it was needed to say it because believe me when I tell you I had an entirely opposite direction I was going to go but here we are why because God knows how to take the preeminence over our hearts he's not a dictator get it out of your mind that God is a dictator he doesn't hate us and he doesn't dislike us when we go through hard things when we go through troubled problems and whatever else it's not that the Lord Jesus is trying to be mean to us but he's trying to help us understand in the part the whole of the will of God for ourselves you're a mystery your life is a mystery and that mystery like the Bible will be slowly unfolded slowly unfolded just like with the Book of Esther and these different books like that not everything these people did not all of it was God you go read some of the history of some of these people once they got out of the hands of the Lord amen that went into all kinds of chaoses and everything else but for the moment that Christ hid himself in them that's where we get the pages of the Bible in their life not everything I'm going to do or you're going to do is going to be God all the time you're going to make decisions that are completely contrary to the will of God but even that is a part of a greater plan to help you step into the right pathway all you say but God's children don't make mistakes yeah I know I wish I could say that was true I wish I could say with all of my heart that you'll never be sad that you'll never feel like a failure that you'll never feel like you've lost your last friend I wish I could say that this life wasn't a life of rejection and constant push and drive but it is God designed it that way to bring out all the goodness that's in US because you see he allowed the fall to happen to express the good that was in him but he allows the bad to happen to let the good in you be expressed the same exact way like we were talking today really trials and things of that nature if we can see it in the right way it's really blessings in disguise the bad is actually good if we can see it in the right way he said my brother encounter Joy when you fall into diverse Temptations I always listen I used to read that brother Gordon I think this this poor fellas baked his brain in the sun who would count it Joy falling into Temptations and trials and problems who in her right mind would do that I know you think I'm probably a blasphemer way I think but I can't I'm just being honest with you I look at them scriptures I think there ain't no way in the world any sensible thing a human being can say that you know of course my heart was open to the Lord and God would tell me you're just looking at it the wrong way well how am I supposed to look at it well this is what he showed you whenever things are happening they're going the way you like them there's a greater purpose in the things you don't see and when you're going through all kinds of problems when you could just realize he is in total control how could you not count it Joy how could you not be happy to know that he can take everything around you and make all things work together for the good of them that are the called according to his purpose I know I know but you don't know the failures you don't know the history you don't know the past it don't matter it don't matter what your back story is what matters is are you willing to surrender those things to the Lord God bless you stand with me well I wanted to preach something happy to you tonight but here we are I hope you're not disappointed if there's one thing that I've learned about people people don't like this kind of preaching in some ways so hard on them because you know we come walking through the back doors kind of low anyways and then some guy comes in and starts kicking Us in the mouth but you know we don't come to church to hear sermons about how great we are because that just takes you in the wrong direction we come here to find our faults now I don't want to just dig you in a hole and leave you there but I want to pray for you that the Lord will help you find this place to surrender there is great Authority and Power in learning how to do this correctly now I don't care what you're facing or what you're experiencing tonight or what you're going through be it a mental battle and some nervous thing some anxiety deal you've been working on it doesn't matter what it is if you'll surrender that to the Lord tonight watch in the coming days how things may be a challenge and maybe a fight but watch and see the Lord don't start picking up momentum and you'll get better and better and better and better because you know I've preached a long time trying to help people figure out how to be complexes and fears fix their life and things and you know after a while brother Carson you hit a spot where you're like I'd run out of stuff to say I've told them everything I Can Tell them I've showed them how to do it and you think what's missing what element am I missing you know everything I tell them this is it right here you can go to the doctor you remember when brother Neville had preached that sermon that morning brother picks up in Satan's they thought it was a cute expression he said the doctor could come in with a pan full of needles and said but if you spit the medicine out between your mouth he said won't do you no good that's what we're talking about you can have the best quotes the best preachers the best everything but until you surrender yourself to the medicine it will never affect you the way you want it to affect you I'm challenging you tonight I don't care what you're battling or what you're going through if you'll take that and surrender that to the Lord watch him change the scene can we bow our heads together now before they play I want to just keep everything quiet for just a moment with your heads bowed now every eye closed by looking around now just keep this between you and the Lord what is it that you're facing what are you going through picture in your mind call the words up in your mind put that thing before you in your heart and mind and I want you to see yourself taking it by your own hands and giving it to God in your own mind and heart Call It by name if you need to and say Lord Jesus thing has plagued me it's a besetting of sin or it's a some kind of a fear or a deep anxiety and I can't seem to get over it the Holy Spirit keeps pulling me back toward that oppression and anxiety or whatever it is brother sister ever who you are the holy spirit is wanting to deliver you tonight this thing you take that thing lay it before the Lord you say brother Ben are you going to pray for me sure I pray for you if you want me to but what I'm trying to do by God's Graces Empower you tonight to give you tools that when you walk out of this revival meeting tonight that you can take this home with you and you can do the work before you and the Lord you don't need anybody to necessarily lay their hands on you this is the bride's ability the wife's ability it's her nature to surrender it to God take that thing whatever it is and lay it before the Lord and just say God I'm giving it to you tonight it might be three or four things it might be several things in a row don't matter take it Call It by name and say this I'm giving it Lord giving you this and I'm putting that before you this need and this thing you see what it is Lord I'm surrendering all of this to your hands amen let's pray together father you see Lord every life gathered here tonight Lord Jesus I've preached quite hard at him tonight I you know My Heart Lord I I know the word has to come that way sometimes and Lord we're proud and thankful that you come to visit us and speak to us and Lord certainly I wouldn't want to put people in this kind of position I'm here how terrible it would be Lord to just be preached into a spot like this and have no way out the Lord Jesus let every one of your children gathered here those that may come and listen to the message at some point or those that might be streaming even now or what might be going on the visible or the invisible honest don't matter Lord help everyone I'm to see the way out tonight it's just complete surrender to you just every day giving that to you Lord Jesus help us practice that surrender in our life help us execute that by presenting our bodies a Living Sacrifice all of our scars all of our flaws all of our inconsistencies all of our weaknesses help us just take all of that and present it to you Lord that you could take us in your hands like clay mold us and shape us into the people that we need to be I pray father for every single one of them here tonight Lord I pray for the saints of God there'll be a backslider or someone here lost tonight needs to know you in the power of Resurrection Life no matter what might be happening in this room this building tonight May the Holy Ghost come to every doorstep and accept their offering of surrender to help us get past all these things that so daily plague us thank you Lord Jesus for the way out we commit this service and all that's been accomplished to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen

Lord you see now you see it now Lord I'm just giving it to you I'm just praising you and thanking you now Lord for hearing my prayer you say but rather Ben this is strange to me where's the where's the screaming the shouting the running the Deliverance brother listen sister listen you don't have to be emotional to have faith you don't have to feel it running up down your back to believe God get it out of your mind that you have to have some kind of powerful Revival that throws you in the floor and slays you in the spirit this will do if God permit but you don't need that in order to believe the word Hallelujah and his word said he promised he would do these things he'll do exactly what he promised give yourself to him tonight and say Lord I'm believing you I'm believing you don't let go of that now hold your need before him all the days of your life now because if you do that I'm telling you change will begin from right here from this point right here some of you like brother man told that boy one time you've been looking for a place to put your feet on where you can stand and get a good start he said now's that time I'm telling you the same thing in the name of the Lord now

if God permits it's fine if any lands have hands laid on me on a thought and I'll do it but you realize the Gentile way speak the word just believe it praise God you say but I didn't feel one thing he didn't say you had to you're not slapping a Pulpit and hollering Satan come away from him I don't need to God evidently felt like you folks here tonight had enough faith that I didn't have to take mine and help you get free evidently the Lord Jesus thought that you all could fight the battle on your own or else the atmosphere would be different right now if he didn't think some of you could get free on your own believe me when I tell you the Holy Spirit would have hastened that service to come to a spot of Crescendo where you'd have somebody laying hands on you right now but you know why he's not God must be confident you've got the faith and the ability Hallelujah praise the Lord right [Applause] you see when you got some grown-up kids in here growing up kids you got that one right grown-up children God when you got some girl Lord here you don't have to always grab them by the neck and say Satan come out of them sometimes you need that time you can't fight the battle definitely
