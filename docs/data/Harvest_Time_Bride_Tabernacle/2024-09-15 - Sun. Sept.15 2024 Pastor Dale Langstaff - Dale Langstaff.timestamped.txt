[28:11] morning we've been going to sleep with
[28:15] all the fans open and all the windows
[28:17] open and I woke up in the night and I
[28:19] felt like I had a snowstorm in my

[28:27] had really cool coed down and amen but
[28:30] God is good amen it's just very good
[28:33] just thank God for last weekend just uh
[28:36] good to fellowship with friends and
[28:38] around God's word and it was wonderful
[28:40] time and uh if you ever go to the
[28:43] Philippines Ron M AEL will it's a
[28:46] beautiful place to go I mean there's a
[28:48] lot of beautiful places there but
[28:50] certainly have a nice place and a nice
[28:52] church and and they're sure Hospital
[28:56] hospitable you know we we would travel
[28:59] around the Philippines to other
[29:01] ministers other Islands even and then we
[29:04] would come back and anchor at brother
[29:06] Ron and so they would have to let us in
[29:09] no matter what time we got there so if
[29:12] it was 1:00 and we got there sometimes
[29:14] at 2 or 3:00 2:30 and every time they
[29:18] open the door they would ask you do you
[29:19] want something to
[29:21] eat it's 2:30 in the morning I've been
[29:23] sleeping in the
[29:25] car amen God's very good so they're
[29:28] wonderful Believers also just remember
[29:30] our our trip going Salvador we have our
[29:34] tickets bought um for us and we're
[29:37] looking forward to that believe we're in
[29:38] God's will to go and and just uh feel
[29:42] his leading we're actually going to two
[29:44] different countries we'll be in probably
[29:46] four different churches at least or five
[29:49] but there'll be multiple other churches
[29:51] coming in from the we're going to uh
[29:54] Nicaragua I think there's going to be
[29:55] three or four churches come there yeah
[29:58] thanks I have one but yeah anyway let's
[30:01] look into the word we're going to
[30:03] continue on our our uh topic that we did
[30:06] before brother Ron let's go to Romans
[30:08] 8:35 and
[30:11] 39
[30:14] just Romans 8:35 and
[30:19] 39 living in the joy of the Lord you
[30:24] know the joy of the Lord you know we
[30:26] went through that last week it don't The
[30:28] Joy don't change regarding your
[30:31] circumstances don't change you know the
[30:33] Bible says that Jesus when he was going
[30:35] to the cross and he was going to be
[30:38] crucified for you and me he said for the
[30:40] joy that was set before him now there
[30:42] was no joy in that
[30:44] crucifixion but for the joy so our our
[30:47] little tiny little baby trials are like
[30:49] nothing to going to the Cross but in our
[30:53] own way we have to take up our own life
[30:55] cross and when we do that we should have
[30:59] joy amen hallelujah Romans 8:35 who
[31:04] shall separate us from the love of
[31:06] Christ so tribulation
[31:09] distress persecution or famine nakedness
[31:12] or Peril or sword as it is written for
[31:15] thy sake we are killed all the day long
[31:19] and we are counted as sheep for the
[31:20] slaughter nay and all these things we
[31:23] are more than conqueror through him who
[31:25] loved us and I am persuaded that neither
[31:29] death nor life nor angels nor
[31:32] principalities nor powers nor things
[31:36] present nor things to come now that just
[31:38] about covers
[31:40] everything nor Heights nor depth nor any
[31:44] other person creature shall be able to
[31:48] separate us from the love of God which
[31:53] is in Christ Jesus let's turn over to
[31:56] Isaiah 6 and read verse three and this
[32:00] is just a beautiful scripture talking
[32:02] about joy and Isaiah we know that Isaiah
[32:05] was a type of the whole Bible Isaiah is
[32:08] wrote in all the books of the
[32:10] Bible Isaiah 6 and3 do an appoint unto
[32:14] them at Mount in Mount mour oh to
[32:19] appoint unto them that mourn in Zion
[32:21] sorry to give unto them the Beauty for
[32:25] Ashes oil for joy
[32:29] oil of joy for mourning and the Garment
[32:32] of Praise for the spirit of heaviness
[32:34] that they may be called Trees of
[32:37] Righteousness planted of the Lord that
[32:41] he might be glorified let's pray Lord
[32:44] Jesus we just pray that you'll come and
[32:47] Minister your thoughts that you've
[32:49] shared with me Lord Jesus and may you
[32:51] bless your bride in just a supernatural
[32:54] way and Lord we pray that the many needs
[32:57] will be represent presented here on
[32:58] spoken needs and prayer requests Lord we
[33:00] pray that you would meet every need and
[33:03] with your your bomb of Gilead your sweet
[33:06] Holy Spirit would go and fix the
[33:08] problems that's in the body of Christ
[33:11] this morning and we'll give you the
[33:13] glory for all of eternity for it in your
[33:16] name we pray amen you may have your
[33:18] seats I just want to read that scripture
[33:21] again 63 since I butchered it so badly
[33:25] to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion
[33:29] to give unto them Beauty for Ashes and
[33:34] the oil of joy for mourning here here's
[33:37] God giving us joy in in our situation
[33:42] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[33:45] heaviness that they may be called Trees
[33:48] of Righteousness
[33:49] planted righteousness the planning of
[33:52] the Lord that he might be glorified
[33:55] Hallelujah
[33:58] that's what we desire to be
[34:01] today and you know we'll be that
[34:05] way when we're in
[34:07] Christ you know whatever our nature
[34:11] is that's what we'll bring forth the
[34:15] nature of life always brings forth seed
[34:20] of its kind and we see that you know
[34:25] just in laying a foundation I mentioned
[34:27] this Wednesday you know brother Braham
[34:28] had a vision on the on the orange tree
[34:31] and and he had went to an orchard and he
[34:33] was with the man and and and uh the
[34:35] orange tree was bringing forth like six
[34:37] other kinds of fruits and they had
[34:39] grafted branches in and brother brandham
[34:42] was amazed by that and he was talking
[34:44] about the life the life that tree is
[34:47] giving life to the whole world and he
[34:50] gave that example and the Bible talks
[34:52] about when the when the wheat and the
[34:54] tears were and there was a drought
[34:58] and God sent rain now who can send rain
[35:01] God can send rain and God sent rain and
[35:04] the wheat and the tears both rejoiced
[35:07] and they both Rejoice watch this those
[35:10] what I proph said he said they both
[35:12] rejoice in Holy Spirit
[35:15] blessing one was completely of the devil
[35:18] and one was completely of God but they
[35:20] both said Hallelujah rain and it was a h
[35:24] Holy Spirit blessing and he compared
[35:26] that to this orange tree and he and he
[35:28] asked the person he said well next year
[35:30] when this tree dies in the winter time
[35:32] and all these other branches are grafted
[35:34] in he said now this will all be orange
[35:35] trees again he said no no no no he said
[35:39] every Branch will bring forth its
[35:42] nature and so a branch that something
[35:45] else citrus fruits or different things
[35:47] it will all bring them but he said where
[35:48] will the oranges be where will the Holy
[35:50] Ghost be and he said when the Holy Ghost
[35:52] puts forth a branch from the original
[35:56] tree and amen from the original vine he
[36:00] is the vine and we are the branches he
[36:02] said when he puts through another Branch
[36:05] he said it'll be
[36:06] oranges Hallelujah but it's amazing how
[36:09] we all feed off the Holy Ghost this
[36:13] world is living by the Holy Ghost you
[36:17] are the grace this morning to the world
[36:21] that's right
[36:23] hallelujah hallelujah you know in the
[36:25] Psalms David roping said weeping may
[36:27] endure for the night but joy cometh in
[36:29] the morning and here David was David had
[36:32] went through a trial because he had fell
[36:34] down and and but God loved David because
[36:37] he could repent and here David was that
[36:39] that even though his his trial was for a
[36:42] short time he said I always have the
[36:44] Lord before me he said I put him on my
[36:47] doorpost and on my bad post and
[36:50] everywhere I go and every decision I go
[36:53] I make a calculated
[36:56] decision the god is before me that's the
[37:00] joy of the Lord you know we you there'll
[37:02] be many of you that are going through
[37:04] different trials and and I know some of
[37:06] them by by being friends amen and and
[37:10] they're not joyful you have there's
[37:13] people sitting in here with thoughts in
[37:15] their mind because they're dealing with
[37:16] things in the past week but God in our
[37:19] great hope and great
[37:22] joy we can come through those trials and
[37:28] falls down around us God's doing it for
[37:31] your good there's a reason behind your
[37:34] trial it's for his good amen watch this
[37:37] you know and I I want to get into this I
[37:38] mentioned last week I started telling
[37:40] you a story about uh uh George Hawthorne
[37:43] was a preacher in our day and and and he
[37:46] uh and I was telling you some about he
[37:49] said when when he was serving the devil
[37:51] he was Radical and when he got converted
[37:53] later in life he was also radical he
[37:56] served God the same way he served the
[37:58] devil radical with his whole being
[38:01] everything he was just one God you know
[38:03] brother Brown said people sometimes God
[38:05] makes just
[38:07] one just one it's just one brother Dale
[38:10] there ain't no other two brother dalees
[38:12] he broke the mold when he he he made
[38:14] brother Dale he said that I was reading
[38:16] quotes this morning right in my office
[38:17] he was reading it about different things
[38:19] amen but here this George he was a a
[38:22] pastor in a small church and he was
[38:25] ministering just like this and I I want
[38:27] you to think about what would you do and
[38:29] the town drunk came in
[38:33] stoned and sat right on the front Pew
[38:36] now I told you I personally know him Lan
[38:39] personally knew him Len knew him before
[38:40] we even met and I knew him and i' I've I
[38:43] personally sat in his services and a
[38:46] stone drunk come in and the service went
[38:49] on just completely like normal but the
[38:52] longer the service went the drunk
[38:55] started sliding down his Pew because he
[38:57] started coming back to
[38:58] himself and he started realizing how did
[39:01] I get in
[39:03] here and he was totally humiliated and
[39:06] totally embarrassed and he was sliding
[39:07] down the front front Pew and so he left
[39:11] him at home and you say well they'll
[39:14] never see him again and he come back the
[39:17] Sunday night amazingly they had a Sunday
[39:19] night service and he brought his whole
[39:21] family and sat in the same front row and
[39:23] they all give their heart to the
[39:25] Lord now it's a beautiful testimony
[39:28] but by your fruits you'll know them and
[39:32] that was back in the day when you used
[39:33] to crank to start the Model T
[39:40] Ford and the other people in town wanted
[39:43] to see if this God was real on cold
[39:46] Frosty
[39:48] mornings and how do you know that
[39:50] because they came back and
[39:52] testified and apologized to the pastor
[39:55] George Hawthorne
[39:58] because they had seen this town
[40:01] drunk tea and it would backfire and the
[40:05] handle would come around and catch his
[40:06] hand on the front bumper and he would
[40:08] pull that crankshaft up he would beat
[40:12] PPS on the hood of that model te car
[40:15] beating it to a liver
[40:18] bliing because he had smashed his
[40:21] hand and so when the people knew that
[40:24] you know this you can't keep news like
[40:26] that quiet when the town drunk comes and
[40:28] sits on the front viw you can see how
[40:30] few are sitting on the front viw this
[40:31] morning we need more drunks and you
[40:34] can't keep news like that quite so on a
[40:36] nice cold Frosty morning you know in the
[40:38] beginning of winter everybody in town
[40:40] just cracked mirrors through the
[40:43] curtains they said we want to see how
[40:45] this God works on nice cold
[40:51] mornings I want to tell you something
[40:54] nothing's
[40:55] changed everybody in this town is
[40:57] cracking their
[40:58] curtains watching how your God works on
[41:01] a cold Frosty morning they're watching
[41:04] how you are when you shovel your
[41:05] sidewalk and you fall down they're
[41:07] watching how you are in the grocery
[41:09] store they're not telling nobody they're
[41:12] not telling nobody unless they're so
[41:14] convicted that they'll come back to the
[41:15] pastor and apologize like they did in
[41:17] this case but you know God because you
[41:22] become a Christian he never changed your
[41:24] circumstances
[41:28] this drunk became a Christian he never
[41:30] changed his circumstances he still had
[41:32] that Model T Ford and it still backfired
[41:35] on cold mornings and he still had to
[41:37] start it with the
[41:39] crank and many many people in the town
[41:42] cracked their curtains to watch them
[41:45] after the Sunday night service start his
[41:48] car and they said just as
[41:51] expected and just like they thought it
[41:55] backfired and that crank spun around and
[41:59] his hand was between it and the
[42:02] bumper of the
[42:04] car and they
[42:06] said that car is going to get a good
[42:09] beating this
[42:10] morning and that town drunk looked at
[42:12] his hand and he said
[42:17] pray I think I better go in the house
[42:20] and get a bandaged
[42:23] up and they had a flood of people come
[42:26] and apologize to the
[42:28] pastor and come to the church because
[42:30] they wanted to see what this God was all
[42:33] about see God don't change your
[42:37] circumstances cuz your life amen you
[42:39] have a job you still have things at the
[42:41] job you you're a businessman you still
[42:44] have a business but do you have the the
[42:46] Lord that has the joy when things don't
[42:49] go your way do you have the Lord when
[42:50] the when you know your situations are
[42:54] all different than mine
[42:57] and God tries us like for me I just I
[43:00] mean you know it we rained too much this
[43:02] spring we all complain now we have
[43:03] bumper crops are we going to complain
[43:11] now uh huh see we all have to wear these
[43:14] suits it's called
[43:17] Christ and we all go through these
[43:19] trials and when we fail these
[43:21] trials God gives them to us
[43:25] again I hope he don't give us another
[43:27] wet spring I just
[43:30] repented amen you see that but see
[43:34] what's on the inside what the nature
[43:36] that's inside you cannot if they take
[43:39] your life says don't feel them to take
[43:41] your life feel them that can take your
[43:44] soul because it's your it makes no
[43:47] difference if I'm not here tomorrow I'll
[43:48] be in The Presence of
[43:51] Jehovah but we get in a section you
[43:55] know watch this people in this town are
[43:58] watching you your families are watching
[44:00] you but youed with kids your kids are
[44:02] watching you they're seeing how good
[44:04] your God
[44:08] is in difficult situations when you
[44:11] smash your hand between the bumper and
[44:13] the
[44:14] crank on a frost Day morning God help us
[44:17] amen you see world all
[44:20] to for one of two
[44:23] people our Bible clearly tells us that
[44:26] say Our God can do nothing nothing this
[44:31] morning unless he has a vessel to work
[44:36] through and I want to show you a couple
[44:38] examples you know every day you're a
[44:41] tool for either Satan or God to work
[44:43] through and if you're born again and
[44:47] converted your life will prove it by the
[44:49] fruits of the Holy
[44:50] Spirit and so when you're in a tough
[44:53] situation you won't lose your cool if
[44:55] you're losing your temper you're losing
[44:58] your you're losing your ability to
[45:00] control yourself you ain't got nothing
[45:02] worth
[45:04] getting God help
[45:09] us and if you are always losing
[45:13] it fting and disrespectful it just shows
[45:16] you who's using your life because it has
[45:20] nothing to do with the fruits of the
[45:23] spirit I want to show you four examples
[45:25] quickly in the Bible and get back in
[45:27] into our topic of Joy examples that were
[45:29] two people first I want to use that were
[45:31] tools for Satan and both of them were
[45:34] message Believers Holy Ghost filled and
[45:36] were believing they were helping God
[45:39] out 100% you're smiling that's the
[45:42] Gospel of Truth Peter was one what did
[45:44] Jesus say to Peter he said get the
[45:46] behind me Satan for he was stopping the
[45:48] plan of God and so much so that he
[45:50] whipped out the sword and would have cut
[45:51] the head off of the high priest servant
[45:57] let me ask you a question was Peter
[45:58] helping Jesus you know the answer to
[46:01] that he 100% believed he was and Jesus
[46:05] called him
[46:07] Satan he said get behind me Satan you're
[46:11] hindering the plan of God now who was
[46:13] Peter a tool for that
[46:17] day and did he love
[46:19] Jesus did Jesus give him the keys to
[46:23] death and
[46:25] Hell another example is Saul before he
[46:29] was named to
[46:31] Paul he was worshiping God killing these
[46:35] radical message Believers that were
[46:37] following a man named
[46:40] Jesus and he had the government's
[46:42] permission to go and kill them now he
[46:45] was 100% a
[46:48] Believer he
[46:50] thought he was a radical believer
[46:52] because he was going out of it he was
[46:54] going out of his way he was one of these
[46:56] radical believer that that washes the
[46:58] windows in the church sides the floor
[47:00] cleans it and cooks dinner and I don't
[47:03] know what else wases my
[47:06] car I mean he was radically going out of
[47:08] his
[47:11] way he was going to clear all these
[47:13] people out that were interesting the
[47:17] church preaching this false
[47:20] Doctrine that's what he was all he said
[47:24] I'll bring them in a swap them in jail
[47:28] and Jesus stopped them on the road and
[47:31] said why are you
[47:34] persecuting he never said
[47:38] them no no Jesus had wasn't on
[47:43] Earth and Saul
[47:46] 100% 100% believes he was on God's
[47:51] side
[47:53] convinced and he was 100% working for s
[47:57] Satan nothing's
[48:00] changed nothing's changed the most
[48:03] friction that you will get in a message
[48:05] in the Christian Believers will be in
[48:07] the
[48:08] Believers it won't be the friends around
[48:11] here are my
[48:17] neighbors let me show you two tools that
[48:20] were working for God and they didn't
[48:22] even know
[48:23] it they ran from the ministry they were
[48:26] asked to preach and they said no way
[48:28] I've never do that PR
[48:33] God
[48:36] David you know David dad said he said
[48:39] now take to the Brethren uh you know
[48:41] some perched corn and some 10 and run
[48:44] them up to the camp to my brethren that
[48:45] are fighting in the war David had no
[48:48] plan of doing anything other than
[48:49] obeying his daddy taking some perch
[48:55] card he wasn't working for
[48:58] God David was just a
[49:00] child he was working for his
[49:05] daddy and he get up and he seen
[49:07] something that was on
[49:10] scripture he seen some great baked fat
[49:14] giant that was defying the armies of the
[49:17] Living
[49:18] God and he said excuse
[49:23] me a little tiny boy
[49:27] could tell the
[49:28] difference who was of God and who was
[49:31] not of God what now my question to you
[49:33] is I showed you two examples that
[49:35] believed they were working for God and
[49:37] they were 100% working for Satan 100%
[49:41] 100% working for Satan and here David he
[49:44] wasn't working for God at
[49:46] all but he was unbeknown to him he
[49:54] was that's peculiar
[49:57] another example here was
[50:01] Pharaoh Pharaoh wasn't serving
[50:06] God do you know Pharaoh was on God's
[50:10] side did you ever think of it that way
[50:13] do you
[50:17] know that's exactly what God told
[50:21] Moses that I have
[50:24] raised to bring all the glory to
[50:28] me so here's
[50:31] pharaoh and he thought he was running a
[50:33] big Kingdom and God had only gave him
[50:36] all those riches and all that
[50:39] power to turn it all to
[50:43] god
[50:46] wow ain't that
[50:48] amazing so see the world sees what we're
[50:52] packing the world sees what we're
[50:54] packing and sometimes
[50:57] we're not packing what we think we're
[50:59] packing God help us but you can always
[51:03] tell by the fruits you can always tell
[51:07] by the
[51:09] fruits here in
[51:13] Romans 6 s 7 and 11 if you want to pull
[51:18] that up verse 7 it says and I'm going to
[51:20] get back to my joy thing here but I'm
[51:22] just saying see for the fruits of the
[51:24] spirit to come out that are gods you
[51:26] have to be dead you have to be dead to
[51:29] yourself and it's very clear to see if
[51:30] you're dead but here in Romans 6:7 says
[51:34] for he that is dead is free from sin and
[51:37] verse 11 he said likewise I reckon ye
[51:39] also to be dead indeed unto sin but
[51:42] alive unto God through Jesus Christ and
[51:45] here here a prophet he said see if
[51:47] you're dead to
[51:48] yourself Christ and you're sealed by the
[51:51] Holy Ghost and there's no way in the
[51:54] world it's a physical
[51:57] impossibility could not only he couldn't
[51:59] get to you but he could never ever use
[52:01] you because he explains it like this
[52:04] matter of fact the prophet said in one
[52:06] quote I actually erased off my iPad he
[52:07] said we're burying too many life
[52:10] Christians you haven't died yet you got
[52:12] a false testimony he said did you ever
[52:15] walk up to a casket and you know we had
[52:18] a friend die
[52:19] recently a lot of friends have dying and
[52:23] the numbers are getting awful close my
[52:25] number and their number
[52:28] we went to a neighbor lady and she was
[52:30] 68 we went to a friend we just run EO
[52:33] for him died suddenly Monday
[52:35] 71 you know
[52:38] 71 and in the
[52:40] 60s I mean you can minus it off
[52:44] and
[52:46] yeah and he looked
[52:48] terrible I think I just saying he looked
[52:53] terrible brother Brown said you walk up
[52:55] to a casket you could say anything you
[52:57] wanted to him Perry was his name you
[53:00] could say Barry you look terrible in
[53:01] this casket and he did he looked very
[53:07] terrible and he's
[53:09] dead you could say you're too fat you're
[53:12] too tall ugly I don't like you you can
[53:15] say anything you want you can say the
[53:17] meatest thing in the world you want to
[53:18] him and he's
[53:22] dead a lot of Christians aren't dead yet
[53:27] but
[53:30] but
[53:33] but said if you're sealed in Christ
[53:35] you're
[53:36] dead the reason Satan can't use you is
[53:39] because you're
[53:40] dead so it takes a vessel away from
[53:44] Satan cuz he you're sealed in Christ and
[53:47] he can't get to you he can not only get
[53:50] to you but he can't never use
[53:53] you God help us God help us in this time
[53:59] amen
[54:08] hallelujah I'm just fast forwarding
[54:12] here 1 Peter 17 and 8 that the trial of
[54:17] your faith being much more precious than
[54:20] gold than gold that perishes through
[54:24] though it be tried with fire
[54:26] it might be on to praise honor and a
[54:31] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[54:33] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[54:36] though now ye see him not yet believing
[54:40] ye Rejoice
[54:42] with
[54:44] joy joy unspeakable going through all
[54:47] these
[54:49] trials you can't see Christ
[54:52] anywhere and your life is misery
[54:58] in his
[55:01] appearing and you're rejoicing with joy
[55:04] watch how the Bible says this this in
[55:06] verse 8 are you got this up I got mine
[55:08] blocked here it says it wasn't just
[55:12] Joy was joy
[55:15] unspeakable and full of
[55:18] Glory you know those are the kind of
[55:20] Christians I want to be around I want to
[55:23] be around the people that are so beside
[55:25] thems
[55:33] uh-huh here here he says the joy
[55:35] unspeakable to the believer is unlimited
[55:37] power he's got healing salvation glory
[55:40] and goodness and he's got Mercy but if
[55:43] he has respects and refuses to receive
[55:46] the remedy for sin if he refuses to
[55:52] die then he'll get rid of all of that
[55:55] Joy
[55:57] and change it for hatred and
[56:00] Malice and all these other things God
[56:03] help us God help
[56:09] us
[56:14] hallelujah I'm going to read a scripture
[56:16] here and I'm I'm going to actually go
[56:18] into this Wednesday night and I'm going
[56:19] to drop my message but Romans 1417 and
[56:23] brother Brown says the message up and
[56:25] you write this down he's got says some
[56:27] amazing things in there about this but
[56:30] I'm going to skip because I'm going to
[56:31] go into that on Wednesday Romans 14:17
[56:34] he said for the kingdom of God is Not
[56:35] meat nor drink but righteousness
[56:39] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost now I I
[56:42] want to tell you some of the stuff he
[56:43] said this kingdom of God has nothing to
[56:46] do with the way you
[56:50] look it'll actually surprise you what
[56:52] our Prophet said but I'm going to skip
[56:55] it and go to Galatians 5 22 and 23
[56:59] sometimes we think that you know
[57:01] religious people they put on a a $1,000
[57:03] suit or or you know the the the
[57:05] five-fold ministry people I was sharing
[57:07] this Wednesday night you know like we we
[57:10] we're we're going to maturity and we're
[57:12] ready to go in a
[57:14] Rapture
[57:16] and we have to
[57:18] get we have to show
[57:21] it now we don't have to do nothing
[57:23] because see a sheep don't have to
[57:25] struggle to grow wool
[57:27] a sheep don't wake up in the morning say
[57:29] oh I think I'm going to produce wool so
[57:30] I can cut it off and sell it no no no he
[57:33] just produces wool so all you got to do
[57:35] to get ready is look at your nature and
[57:38] everything else will be taken care of if
[57:40] your Nature's right and you're dad
[57:42] everything else you'll grow
[57:44] wool because you'll be sheep of God you
[57:48] know God help us in these things
[57:51] amen I was saying we we had a I had a
[57:54] minister tell me you know and you you
[57:56] see these kind of things where where
[57:59] people are are just on Wednesday night
[58:02] you either are a or you're
[58:07] not so if you hear a
[58:10] minister come off the word you should
[58:13] never hear him preach again you should
[58:14] get up and leave never listen to him
[58:16] again because he ain't
[58:21] both you know the Bible says that the
[58:23] bitter water and good water can't mix
[58:26] and a Thorn Tree can't bring forth
[58:29] figs and so you're not like a pretty
[58:31] good Christian but a make
[58:33] believer you're like a a
[58:36] devil or a Christian period so if I
[58:41] quoted one thing off the word just you
[58:44] just and don't ever come back because
[58:46] I'm not
[58:47] converted I did it's not that I didn't
[58:49] make a
[58:51] mistake you can't leave God's
[58:53] word and then come back most of the time
[58:56] you know Eve only took one word should
[59:00] not surely die and it caused all the sin
[59:04] and death in the the world so there's
[59:07] millions of preachers that are off one
[59:11] word you know what the Bible talks about
[59:13] respects and and and all these things I
[59:16] mean respects like treating people
[59:19] differently and and nickel Adian Spirit
[59:21] the Bible says that God hated a nickel
[59:23] Adian Spirit you know what it was it was
[59:25] the Ministry pressuring the people
[59:28] that's disgusting because the minister
[59:30] is only a people himself soon as I walk
[59:33] down one any one of you Brothers could
[59:34] come up here and preach amen what what
[59:37] gives the ministers some kind of a baked
[59:40] head and I I had the brothers were at a
[59:43] convention and there was four people
[59:45] preaching I know this happens lots of
[59:46] time brother Osman Bartley told me this
[59:48] he he he named people around the world
[59:51] that are like this he said you can never
[59:52] talk you know if you went to half the
[59:55] churches in the world you you'd never
[59:56] talk to
[59:58] me I'd be sheltered I'd go out that door
[1:00:00] go home and S I'd be treated like I I
[1:00:02] don't know I guess pilot or something
[1:00:05] you'd have to set up an appointment 15
[1:00:07] days ahead of time and or 50 days or
[1:00:11] that's
[1:00:12] disgusting that's disgusting he was
[1:00:14] saying one of my friend ministers was
[1:00:17] there I've been there multiple times and
[1:00:18] he said all four of the ministers were
[1:00:20] kept from the people and he said there
[1:00:22] wasn't One Pastor in the congregation
[1:00:24] that was even able to shake their hand
[1:00:27] because they were
[1:00:29] special but you're all
[1:00:32] special that's disgusting but see so
[1:00:35] those people aren't
[1:00:37] converted cuz the Bible clear I that
[1:00:40] that's strong medicine but that's
[1:00:41] actually the truth because it's on
[1:00:43] scripture on two part it's a nicolan
[1:00:44] spirit and it's shown respects to to a
[1:00:47] person that looks better than the poor
[1:00:49] person and you give him a better seat
[1:00:51] and so the Bible says in that that
[1:00:53] you're guilty of the whole law and you
[1:00:55] know at some part when we become mature
[1:00:58] Christians we got to take good strong
[1:01:00] meat and be able to eat it and if not
[1:01:01] we're not even
[1:01:09] converted I'm going to go through a
[1:01:10] pastor in El Salvador and he said we
[1:01:12] almost have no one one of the churches
[1:01:15] he said we almost have nobody associate
[1:01:17] with us in the last 25 years and I'll
[1:01:21] make him my precept the main thing and
[1:01:24] you know everything started from
[1:01:26] were that's
[1:01:29] disgusting amen God help us we we got to
[1:01:32] be mature and recognize that you got to
[1:01:34] you got to recognize sin and call it for
[1:01:36] what it is it's it's not you judging it
[1:01:38] it's just off the word of God you have a
[1:01:40] nickolus spirit that's obvious you're
[1:01:43] attacking you I mean whatever it is I
[1:01:45] mean if you're a sheep you grow wool
[1:01:47] it's very clear I mean if you're an
[1:01:49] orange tree you produce orange jues and
[1:01:50] if it's orange
[1:01:52] tree then it's not see you can recognize
[1:01:55] the
[1:01:56] nature amen it's the nature just all you
[1:02:00] got to do you don't have to judge just
[1:02:01] look at the nature a cow is always a
[1:02:04] cow a lamb will always have baby
[1:02:08] lambs and Christ will always produce
[1:02:11] Christ and if it ain't Christ run for
[1:02:14] your
[1:02:15] life how can two walk together unless
[1:02:17] they
[1:02:19] agree simple Galatians 5:22 and 23 it
[1:02:23] says but the fruit of the spirit love
[1:02:26] Joy we're preaching on joy joy peace
[1:02:29] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[1:02:32] meekness Temperance and against
[1:02:35] such we should have it all the
[1:02:40] time let me show you some of the things
[1:02:42] that the prophet said he said everything
[1:02:43] you have and show us the father he said
[1:02:45] everything you have need of was put in
[1:02:48] you put in
[1:02:49] your when you baptism of the Holy
[1:02:53] Ghost everything it's just the nature
[1:02:57] you either came from go if you believe
[1:02:59] you got eternal life this morning you
[1:03:00] had to come from God cuz God's the only
[1:03:03] thing that's ET and eternal had no
[1:03:05] beginning or no end and so if you think
[1:03:07] that you're going to heaven and you
[1:03:09] don't think you came from God
[1:03:12] deceived and if you came from God you
[1:03:14] don't M even in a backsliding state even
[1:03:17] in a backsliding state you'll still have
[1:03:19] the nature of
[1:03:22] Christ even in a backsliding
[1:03:27] you'll still have the nature of
[1:03:29] Christ you can't change I mean blood and
[1:03:33] water don't
[1:03:35] mix Hallelujah he said everything when
[1:03:38] you receive the Holy Ghost is put in for
[1:03:40] your life's journey healing salvation
[1:03:42] and for your joy and happiness so
[1:03:45] brother bam saying right here and show
[1:03:47] us the father he said if you say you
[1:03:49] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:50] you're happy under your circumstances of
[1:03:54] the bailor broke or the break broke or
[1:03:56] it rained too much or whatever it
[1:03:59] is then you ain't really got
[1:04:03] it amen God hi manifested himself he
[1:04:07] said the hope of everlasting life he
[1:04:09] said he promised us joy and happiness
[1:04:13] with
[1:04:15] contentment here he said sheep symbolize
[1:04:18] there are not am animal and I mentioned
[1:04:20] the Sheep saw me said and they don't
[1:04:23] have to think about producing wool
[1:04:27] if you have to check your life to
[1:04:28] produce in your Nature's wrong I mean
[1:04:32] you can't you can't have come from God
[1:04:34] and have eternal life and have a
[1:04:36] different nature than
[1:04:37] Christ so we just come with me on this
[1:04:41] journey so we all came from God does say
[1:04:44] and and he spoke us out in Genesis 1:27
[1:04:47] and he created US male and female and
[1:04:49] we're all a part of God are are some of
[1:04:52] the parts bigger than others
[1:04:55] thank you sister D of course not so how
[1:04:59] in the world could we be in a setting
[1:05:01] like this and we all came from God we
[1:05:05] we're all right we all came from Genesis
[1:05:06] 1 we're all part of God but you can't
[1:05:10] touch
[1:05:11] me cuz I'm wearing a tie and you're
[1:05:15] not cuz I Minister and you don't
[1:05:18] yet that's

[1:05:22] is what are we
[1:05:24] building yeah yeah
[1:05:31] yeah now watch I can no I'm this ain't
[1:05:34] meant we have unique situations in this
[1:05:37] church but I'm going to give you an
[1:05:38] example you can tell if that spirit's
[1:05:40] Alive by if more people came to hear
[1:05:42] Osman Bartley on a Wednesday night than
[1:05:44] come to hear me last
[1:05:47] Wednesday that's right I'll say it for
[1:05:51] ouch
[1:05:57] and hband Bartley would invite me to
[1:05:59] come down and preach in his church but
[1:06:01] you would come and hear him preach on a
[1:06:02] Wednesday night but you wouldn't come
[1:06:03] and hear me cuz just brother Dale just
[1:06:05] be the same old just be the same old
[1:06:07] word of God we'll just pray to the same
[1:06:09] old same old far away God and you know
[1:06:12] and we'll just do the same old stuff

[1:06:22] somebody that'll tell you the truth
[1:06:28] amen we live different because of our
[1:06:32] situations and to God it's disgusting it
[1:06:35] would be like what would you think of a
[1:06:37] parent that had it wouldn't matter how
[1:06:39] many kids as long as you had more than
[1:06:40] one you have two kids like sister Ruth
[1:06:42] you got two kids you're going to love
[1:06:43] one more than the other you're going to
[1:06:45] treat one with favoritism more than the
[1:06:46] other that is like that's disgust and
[1:06:49] you don't but that's disgusting and
[1:06:52] everybody looking on they're like what

[1:07:13] I have towards you that you'll prosper
[1:07:15] and have good he said
[1:07:17] God being out each other's throat he put
[1:07:20] us in a family there's a reason we have
[1:07:22] a family a family has a back on it's a
[1:07:24] structure

[1:07:29] this church we go to the park we're just
[1:07:31] all mixed in with everybody if we need
[1:07:34] to carry chairs the preachers can carry

[1:07:39] amazing you know I want to tell you
[1:07:41] something that'll make you almost fall
[1:07:43] over that's not the truth

[1:07:49] heart attack when he was here Ron
[1:07:51] Mayo because we came early to church and
[1:07:55] and he asked me something very
[1:07:58] respectfully CU I took off my flip-flops
[1:08:00] and I was putting on another pair of
[1:08:01] shoes and he took off his shoes before
[1:08:03] he came in here you can wear your shoes
[1:08:05] in the church I said we mainly have that
[1:08:08] for snow and cold weather but I said I
[1:08:10] normally clean the church and he passed
[1:08:20] out do you know I had ministers from

[1:09:08] nature it was their nature that give it
[1:09:13] away amen God help
[1:09:17] us he said Christ is the vine and and uh
[1:09:21] and is that person it'll be like Jesus

[1:09:29] Spirit it can't do nothing else but do
[1:09:32] that it it can't produce it can't
[1:09:35] produce nothing Life of
[1:09:37] Christ if it's Christ life in
[1:09:42] him he said you just produce anything
[1:09:44] else and you try to act like him and you
[1:09:47] try to talk like him and try to walk
[1:09:48] like him and try to heal like him and
[1:09:50] you'll see that it's
[1:09:53] false it's a p put
[1:09:56] on God help us in this
[1:10:01] day not to be put
[1:10:04] on he said you're just like a shell a
[1:10:09] man is just like a water pipe he said he

[1:10:15] pipe and take the water out of him and
[1:10:19] he'll
[1:10:20] rust and that's exactly what's the
[1:10:23] matter today is we got too many of us

[1:10:30] there's no water in us God help us amen
[1:10:34] God help
[1:10:37] us
[1:10:39] hallelujah amen the
[1:10:42] nature actually I want to go back and
[1:10:44] finish this quote we were talking about
[1:10:45] the Sheep the she he says the Sheep he's
[1:10:49] a sheep he'll bear wool because here
[1:10:52] here are the prophets and this is the
[1:10:53] lamb and the dove the 60 quote he said
[1:10:56] it's because it's a sheep's nature to
[1:10:58] Bear wool God help us God help us if
[1:11:03] you're a Believer this morning you're
[1:11:05] going to be joyful even in your trial I
[1:11:09] know some of you were were sick this
[1:11:11] past week or or come back from holidays
[1:11:13] and things happen and that and they
[1:11:15] weren't nice things things happen in our
[1:11:18] life if you have a flat tire or you know
[1:11:21] lose a whatever a vehicle job or
[1:11:23] anything but you can you can be founded
[1:11:27] and
[1:11:27] grounded on your on your testimony of
[1:11:32] Christ that even in this trial look look
[1:11:35] at the the very best example we have is
[1:11:38] Jesus says he endured the
[1:11:41] cross R the
[1:11:43] shame
[1:11:45] amen going to the cross it was for the
[1:11:48] joy that was set before him the joy the
[1:11:51] joy you know what if we're not joyful in
[1:11:54] this world
[1:11:55] under the the circumstances and
[1:11:57] influence of this world nobody's going
[1:12:00] to want to be what you are amen because
[1:12:04] there's a lot of problems around the
[1:12:06] world and people are looking for
[1:12:09] Solutions and it's not an
[1:12:13] election it's not an
[1:12:15] election it's
[1:12:17] Christ it's Christ and if you want a
[1:12:20] better solution than Christ it's a
[1:12:23] Rapture it's
[1:12:25] it's a it's Christ and Christ will give
[1:12:28] it look at what look at what Jesus Bible
[1:12:31] he says I pray thee that you won't take
[1:12:32] them out of the world but you'll leave
[1:12:35] them in the world but the world won't
[1:12:38] influence them you'll have testimony so
[1:12:41] you can be in the world and have a
[1:12:45] testimony amen God help us God help us
[1:12:49] in this thing you know it's like brother
[1:12:52] Brown said in this scripture
[1:12:55] it's not what we put on it's not what we
[1:12:58] say so much and it's not how long our
[1:13:00] hair is or how short our hair is or what
[1:13:03] we wear as much as what the fruit is is
[1:13:06] coming on the
[1:13:07] outside amen God help
[1:13:10] us God help us let's
[1:13:15] stand you can never
[1:13:18] hide your
[1:13:22] nature

[1:13:30] us God don't want us to be
[1:13:33] deceived in this
[1:13:35] time and you know if you live different
[1:13:39] on Monday than you do on Sunday or you
[1:13:42] know I was reading a post where you know
[1:13:44] and it was wrote more of a husband and
[1:13:45] wife and how the husband would go to
[1:13:48] work and treat his cogs really nice and
[1:13:50] then the that he calls his wife he would
[1:13:52] treat her miserable and he would talk
[1:13:54] nice to the secretary at work but he
[1:13:56] would talk disgusting to his wife and
[1:13:58] that you know that's that's that's false
[1:14:02] that's not the spirit of CHR man that's
[1:14:05] a double standard we call that a phone
[1:14:07] voice if you got a phone voice then
[1:14:10] you're not
[1:14:12] converted amen and when we have the joy
[1:14:14] of God you you don't know maybe like the
[1:14:18] now this morning I told you but you can
[1:14:21] have things going on in your life and
[1:14:22] you can still have the joy of the Lord
[1:14:24] coming out you might not feel good this
[1:14:26] morning but you're covering it up you
[1:14:28] may be worked all night and you're
[1:14:30] covering it up I may be sick and I'm
[1:14:32] ministering to you but I'm covering it
[1:14:35] up because we have an
[1:14:38] anchor that's a lot more than the the
[1:14:40] working night or the sickness or because
[1:14:43] it's our our hope is in the Lord our joy
[1:14:46] is in the Lord amen and even if it rains
[1:14:49] too much you have a flat tire your house

[1:15:02] are God help us when the neighbors crack
[1:15:04] the
