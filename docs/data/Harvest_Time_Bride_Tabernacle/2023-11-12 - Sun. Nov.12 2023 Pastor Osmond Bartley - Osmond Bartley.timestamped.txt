[39:29] and there is no
[39:32] barriers you know I never felt any form
[39:35] of uh wrong Spirit everybody just
[39:39] welcome us and we met different persons
[39:42] go to their homes and I trust the Lord
[39:45] if the Lord permits that I will come
[39:48] back and I'll be able to go to more
[39:50] people it all it is always good with us
[39:53] sometime we just meet a church and we
[39:56] just have service but when you meet
[39:57] people in their homes and the spirit you
[40:01] know be around them more brother Braham
[40:03] says sometime you just need to be in a
[40:04] person's presence for five minutes and
[40:07] you know who they are you know and
[40:09] that's wonderful wonderful you know the
[40:12] the the brother John that was here in
[40:14] the service all I just had great
[40:16] fellowship with him and many of you know
[40:19] you for the first time on Earth but
[40:22] there our DNA is the
[40:25] same our DNA is the
[40:27] same brother James reminded Us in James
[40:31] 1:18 we'll be begotten by the word of
[40:34] Truth and so I love
[40:37] God I I I deliver the word because I
[40:40] love God I Don't Preach because I'm a
[40:44] preacher I love God I believe it I
[40:48] really believe it hallelujah amen I love
[40:52] the Lord I believe it and I love God's
[40:55] people that's why I'm
[40:57] here we so we're going to go into the
[41:01] word in a simple thought if the Lord
[41:04] permits us amen and just trust God you
[41:08] know for for his leading Saints and you
[41:11] know quite a few I'm glad that you made
[41:13] it the service available for the Saints
[41:16] back home and I'm glad you didn't send
[41:18] some of them links this morning people
[41:21] have a tendency because they can stain
[41:23] their pajamas and stretch out in the
[41:25] sofa press the button and watch the
[41:29] service it's so convenient so last week
[41:32] a few of them back home because brother
[41:34] Junior sent them
[41:36] hurle the link and so I learned that
[41:39] quite a few said to me some of them said
[41:42] to me in the afternoon oh Pastor the
[41:44] service was so wonderful I was like how
[41:47] did you get time to watch that you're
[41:48] supposed to be in
[41:51] church but they said some couldn't make
[41:54] it at a home church but they were here
[41:56] here online you know and so I love when
[42:00] people be in
[42:01] service the online is available yes but
[42:04] I love when people come to it's just a
[42:06] different atmosphere that's right praise
[42:09] be to God and so let's just pray father

[44:19] together in Fellowship thank you Lord in

[44:27] 17 and it's not a Bible story and you
[44:31] know we thank God that we have reached
[44:34] the dimension in which we don't look up
[44:36] the word of God as Bible stories but

[45:20] things that I learned First Kings

[45:26] one verse and you know CU you'll be
[45:29] sitting all the time and I'll be doing
[45:30] all the standing so you can just bear
[45:33] with me
[45:34] right you're all right I like I like the
[45:37] spirit brother B said when I look on
[45:39] your faces I see
[45:41] Christ that tells me to know that you're
[45:43] feeding on the word glory to God
[45:47] and verse
[45:49] 12 cuz we all know what happened before
[45:51] but I'll be taking a few verses from
[45:53] there verse 12 and she said and as the
[45:56] Lord God thy as the Lord thy God liveth
[45:59] I have not a cake but a handful of meal
[46:04] in a
[46:05] barrel and a little oil in a Cru and
[46:10] behold I am Gathering two sticks that I
[46:12] may go in and dress it for me and my son
[46:16] that we may eat it and
[46:20] die and Elijah said unto her fear not
[46:25] but go and do as thou has said but make
[46:29] me therefore a little cake first and
[46:32] bring it unto me and
[46:35] after make for thee and for thy son
[46:40] that's a great challenge isn't it oh
[46:44] God but he didn't stop for thus sayi the
[46:50] Lord God of
[46:53] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[46:56] waste neither shall the cruise of oil
[47:00] fail
[47:01] until the day that the Lord send that
[47:05] rain upon the Earth may the Lord bless
[47:07] the word you be
[47:16] seated really appreciate though the Holy
[47:19] Spirit has brought us from Friday night
[47:22] you know in in the line and the songs
[47:24] and the special
[47:26] were so in line in harmony with the Holy
[47:29] Spirit you know and the we we we we love
[47:32] of God just manifested himself over the
[47:36] weekend Wednesday night was wonderful
[47:39] you know and it's not just about as I
[47:41] it's not just about preaching but to see
[47:43] the direction in which the holy spirit
[47:45] is pushing us and or directing Us in his
[47:49] word and uh you know as preachers or
[47:52] ministers you know we we we we have come
[47:56] to the level and understanding that it's
[47:59] not about just putting a few notes
[48:01] together and as long as I have enough
[48:04] time I got to lay it out whether the
[48:05] people are feeding or not but you know
[48:08] your hunger determines on how well
[48:10] you're fed and so we never know
[48:14] everything you know I used to have
[48:16] persons come around and I'm preaching in
[48:18] my church and at the end of it one would
[48:21] come over say you know they know so much
[48:23] and oh Pastor you didn't finish preach I
[48:27] said no man can finish
[48:30] preach you know I I don't want to know a
[48:32] preacher that always finish preach cuz
[48:36] you know because maybe the very minute
[48:38] you leave amen the church something more
[48:41] comes that's how God is something more
[48:45] comes and you said Lord you know why
[48:47] didn't I why didn't you tell me that
[48:50] while I was on the pulpit well I didn't
[48:52] want you to say it at that time sir and
[48:55] so we never finish preaching you know I
[48:58] used to a person say well why didn't you
[49:00] go in that direction and go in that
[49:02] direction and I would have said well
[49:04] because I never came to a seminary you
[49:08] know I was staying there and studying
[49:10] the Holy Spirit you what to say so if I
[49:13] didn't say a few words that you thought
[49:16] that I should have said praise be to God
[49:19] we're still in harmony because God spoke
[49:22] to you too amen the right s and I'm sure
[49:28] as I stand up here that I'm not going to
[49:30] say one thing that you never know
[49:32] because it's always in the word of God
[49:35] Amen you heard it you know it your
[49:38] pastor preach it amen some of the people
[49:41] sing it it's all in the word of God so
[49:45] there is nothing new Under The Sun It's
[49:49] just that this season the Lord says a
[49:52] pastor from Jamaica is coming and he's
[49:55] is going to see a few words amen and
[49:58] he'll be standing here before you so
[50:00] it's not you it's me that God is going
[50:03] to use in this little season amen praise
[50:06] be to God and so amen uh we can look at
[50:10] a thought from me here but just to re
[50:14] backtrack a little bit this is God's
[50:17] Divine Prophet
[50:19] Elijah and just to know and understand
[50:22] that season changes and need to
[50:26] understand that when the season change
[50:28] we need to recognize amen what season
[50:32] amen that we him that's right Hallelujah
[50:35] because if you don't know you remember
[50:37] the word of God told the people haia 46
[50:40] When God says my people are destroyed
[50:44] because of lack of
[50:46] knowledge we need to know one time the
[50:49] prophet said amen it make no sense amen
[50:54] plunging at long into something that you
[50:56] don't even know where you're
[50:59] going amen faith is good a leap of faith
[51:03] but you ought to have knowledge of where
[51:05] you are and what you're about we are on
[51:07] a
[51:08] journey amen we are on a journey and
[51:12] when I left from Brother Dale's place
[51:14] and he said we're going to Wyoming I am
[51:17] watching every signs I'm reading the
[51:19] signs and the the directions sometime he
[51:22] take this root and then I'm confused and
[51:25] I reach home then another time he take
[51:28] this back road but I reach home and I
[51:31] was that where is he going and I'm at
[51:33] the house he knows the
[51:36] place is that right I don't know it but
[51:39] I'm watching the signs and reading the
[51:41] signs because I'm going in a
[51:47] direction amen so we understand
[51:50] something here that you know just before
[51:54] Elijah came to
[51:55] zerat where this wiow was God commanded
[52:00] him to go to Brick
[52:03] Sheriff because I have commanded amen
[52:07] the Ravens to feed you
[52:09] there glory to God I have commanded amen
[52:14] notice something we ought to be careful
[52:16] now amen that sometimes we are waiting
[52:20] for God to tell us the end of the road
[52:24] come on now before we can move there is
[52:26] no deep of faith when Elijah said to
[52:29] Ahab no rain or due shall fall until I
[52:34] said so amen he never knew where he was
[52:38] going before he said that Hallelujah is
[52:43] that right but then God shall you need
[52:45] to get up and go to Sher I have
[52:48] commanded the Wither I have commanded
[52:50] the Ravens to feed you after a period of
[52:54] time uh amen God Shifting the
[52:57] season Hallelujah God Shifting the
[53:01] season shifting amen the
[53:05] location Hallelujah when God said now
[53:09] amen leave Brook sh yes that's right now
[53:13] how could God send him at Brook sherid
[53:16] and allow the brook to dry up come on
[53:19] God was shifting Hallelujah the season
[53:23] woo Hallelujah glory to God God was
[53:27] Shifting the season now the command to
[53:30] the widow woman was different God said I
[53:34] command The Raven to feed feed no
[53:39] connection Hallelujah no
[53:43] relation glory to God is that right but
[53:47] I have commanded the widow woman to
[53:50] sustain you so the seeds are shifted
[53:53] from
[53:54] feeding
[53:55] tenant can I get some amen hallelujah
[54:00] glory to God now Elijah if Elijah had
[54:04] remained at book shered amen he would
[54:08] have he would have stared to death
[54:10] because the light moves where the word
[54:14] is that's where the light is
[54:18] shining can I preach this man where the
[54:21] word is that's where the light is
[54:24] shining so God says the light amen the
[54:28] sustainance is at Brook is at zarapa you
[54:32] need to go so the word is light and the
[54:37] light is the word hallelujah Christ is
[54:42] the light the light is the spirit and
[54:46] the spirit is the light and the word is
[54:49] the light so the purpose of the light is
[54:53] to
[54:54] illuminate to show you where you're
[54:57] going to show you who you are Hallelujah
[55:02] glory to God now remember the light is
[55:06] the Lord St John tells you that the Lord
[55:09] is that
[55:11] light and the word says in 2 Corinthians
[55:15] 3:17 the Lord is that
[55:19] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[55:22] is glory to God where the spirit of the
[55:26] Lord is there is
[55:29] Liberty amen Liberty what is liberty
[55:34] liberty is the state of being free from
[55:38] oppressive
[55:40] restrictions it may oh Hallelujah
[55:43] imposed by Authority or one's way of
[55:46] life it's the power to do as you
[55:50] please we are
[55:53] liberated we are a people of Liberty we
[55:56] are
[55:57] free oh
[55:59] Hallelujah glory to God where the spirit
[56:02] of the Lord is where is it it makes me
[56:05] free free at last thank God Almighty
[56:10] I've got the spirit and
[56:15] free the thought
[56:17] today is thus say the
[56:22] Lord let's look in the thought
[56:26] thus say the Lord glory to God it's an
[56:31] expression used in the Bible over 400
[56:35] times it means an expression of
[56:39] oath a solemn
[56:42] promise given from a Divine
[56:47] witness thus say the
[56:50] Lord thus that's a powerful expression
[56:53] it doesn't mean that
[56:55] but then listen this can I read a quote
[56:57] brother Brandon said in 1962 the message
[56:59] spoken word The Original Seed he said
[57:03] here is the
[57:05] secret he never said here is a
[57:09] secret two words you have a and you have
[57:14] the if I said there is a white car at
[57:17] the back in the parking lot you go look
[57:20] for any car it could have been anyone
[57:23] but when I said there is a oh when I
[57:26] said there is
[57:29] the white
[57:31] core with the license plates
[57:35] XYZ you go looking for a direct
[57:40] vehicle it's direct so the prophet says
[57:45] here is the
[57:50] secret you ready for
[57:52] it I want to hear the secret
[57:55] I'm excited about hearing what I have
[57:58] Hallelujah the word the secret is the
[58:01] word is in the
[58:06] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[58:10] what he wants done with the
[58:14] word she has the mind of Christ she has
[58:18] the word of Christ amen and she knows
[58:23] what he wants done with the word so the
[58:26] word is not just about having a
[58:29] appear but it's about putting the word
[58:32] in action what he once done with the
[58:35] word let me go
[58:37] further but she done she does it in his
[58:42] name his
[58:45] name she has thus seek the
[58:50] Lord woo God hallelujah can I say this
[58:55] she has what Elijah
[58:59] had oh god oh bless
[59:03] God she has thus say the Lord oh
[59:08] Hallelujah then it is
[59:12] gerti so glory to God so the Holy Spirit
[59:17] Waters it until it is grown and serve
[59:23] its purpose
[59:32] I don't believe he meant that we walk
[59:34] around the church and we see a flowers
[59:36] thus shap the Lord flowers
[59:38] bloom thus shap the Lord do that
[59:42] practicing this thing
[59:44] no she has the word now this is where
[59:47] maturity comes
[59:52] in this is where a adoption comes in
[59:56] Hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah
[59:59] amen brother did you wouldn't trust your
[1:00:02] baby grand son with your car keys he's
[1:00:04] still your son he's your bloodline but
[1:00:07] he's not yet mature but you throw it to
[1:00:09] Jared and you said go drive on the road
[1:00:12] do that that why because he's mature and
[1:00:15] he has the credentials to
[1:00:19] drive she has the holy spirit that will
[1:00:23] Jour TI
[1:00:25] that word amen that is on her inside and
[1:00:30] Patiently by faith she waits until the
[1:00:33] RO that that word is grown and the more
[1:00:37] it grows it's coming out to fulfill the
[1:00:40] purpose of
[1:00:42] God oh
[1:00:44] Hallelujah glory to
[1:00:48] God what a
[1:00:51] secret she has that secret
[1:00:55] now notice here saints of God
[1:00:57] that in verse in the same
[1:01:01] chapter in verse
[1:01:07] 13 but just back up a little bit at
[1:01:10] verse 12 very
[1:01:14] interesting I love all my God
[1:01:17] works you cannot program my God God like
[1:01:21] to do things sometime to shift some of
[1:01:22] our minds and God said to him let's go
[1:01:25] down and we got a little bit more time
[1:01:28] he said and the verse eight and the word
[1:01:31] of the Lord came unto him saying arise
[1:01:33] and get you to zerat is the word zerat
[1:01:37] mean
[1:01:39] refining it means in
[1:01:42] refining glory to God just be it in mind
[1:01:45] hold it one part of your mind now
[1:01:47] according to geography zapat was about
[1:01:50] uh between 85 to 95 miles north
[1:01:55] way up so he didn't just jump from one
[1:01:58] door to the next he had to travel and
[1:02:01] according to the Eastern traveling they
[1:02:03] would have traveled on foot 19 miles per
[1:02:05] day that's a Day's Journey you know they
[1:02:07] measur day Journey or a Sabbath Day's
[1:02:09] Journey which was quarter of 3/4 of a
[1:02:11] mile a day Journey 19 miles on foot and
[1:02:15] then they rest but they would travel by
[1:02:17] the moons you know that glory to God but
[1:02:19] if they were traveling on horses or
[1:02:21] camel they do 21 miles and then they
[1:02:23] rest so think about you do the match the
[1:02:26] miles the miles and so amen it was a
[1:02:31] challenge woo
[1:02:34] Hallelujah it was a
[1:02:37] challenge come on Believers we're the
[1:02:40] bride of Christ we're not supposed to go
[1:02:43] to challenge challenges yes we are
[1:02:48] predestinated to be Amen to be the
[1:02:50] children of adoption but we will
[1:02:53] encounter challenges
[1:02:59] I have commanded a widow woman to
[1:03:01] sustain the and think about it
[1:03:05] hallelujah amen sh and you wonder a
[1:03:09] widow woman who had
[1:03:14] nothing she had nothing God don't make
[1:03:18] mistakes they were you know can I say
[1:03:21] this and I feel so good now this was not
[1:03:24] just about
[1:03:25] Elijah this was this was about the wiow
[1:03:28] woman oh
[1:03:31] Hallelujah this was about the the
[1:03:34] village that they were living into when
[1:03:36] God is working Amen in your season in
[1:03:41] your environment brothers and sisters
[1:03:43] it's not just about you it's about the
[1:03:46] widow woman down the road it's about the
[1:03:49] man that cannot walk it's about the
[1:03:52] community you are the light of of the
[1:03:54] world not just in your church but let
[1:03:58] your light so shine for who all

[1:10:01] stopped there but we know he's a god of
[1:10:04] the
[1:10:07] universe we know it but he shifted her
[1:10:11] mind to her own
[1:10:13] language what he said thus say the Lord
[1:10:17] God of
[1:10:22] Israel
[1:10:26] Glory she never heard Elijah before she

[1:11:34] said wo
[1:11:37] God brought me back brothers and sisters
[1:11:40] and when I
[1:11:44] understand how a language is
[1:11:48] important in
[1:11:51] worshiping communicating
[1:11:56] oh Hallelujah we have many dialects is
[1:11:57] that right oh God is that right amen
[1:12:02] many dialects millions of dialects but
[1:12:05] they prove that 6,500 languages in the
[1:12:08] whole world scientist says but we have
[1:12:10] many dialects but the language in which
[1:12:13] we speak in the spirit there is a
[1:12:16] Heavenly
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:18] language Oh Glory to
[1:12:22] God when Jesus said to those Church
[1:12:26] religious
[1:12:27] people I'm speaking to you now when you
[1:12:29] don't understand if I speak the Heavenly

[1:12:59] language Hallelujah glory to God I'm
[1:13:03] preaching and one over here may wiping
[1:13:06] tears because the holy spirit is taking
[1:13:10] that word and go and and placing that
[1:13:14] word in the spiritual womb while a n
[1:13:18] over here is laughing why they can't
[1:13:21] help it why because they're not able to
[1:13:24] communicate from that level here's a
[1:13:26] language barrier there Lord God when I
[1:13:30] speak the revelated word you can say
[1:13:34] Amen because you understand my
[1:13:37] language Oh Glory to God it brought me
[1:13:42] back and the worship around the throne
[1:13:46] and this is important for us you
[1:13:48] remember I said to us that worship is
[1:13:50] more than just singing a few
[1:13:52] songs
[1:13:56] more than just sing it because we like
[1:13:58] it and it sounds good worship is about
[1:14:01] Revelation true worship comes through
[1:14:05] Revelation Hallelujah worship the father
[1:14:08] in spirit and in truth that's who he
[1:14:11] wants to worship him oh the true
[1:14:14] worshippers Oh Glory but around the
[1:14:16] throne when John was caught up in
[1:14:20] another dimension come up here re gation
[1:14:23] 4
[1:14:24] 9-11 John said I saw four beasts around
[1:14:28] the throne and he described the Beast
[1:14:31] that he saw and I saw 24 Elders around
[1:14:35] the throne too and oh the the atmosphere
[1:14:38] was so awesome beyond my own
[1:14:42] comprehension my my my tongue cannot
[1:14:45] express the glory that was around the
[1:14:47] throne is that right but the words were
[1:14:50] important to me as they said the holy
[1:14:54] holy holy Lord God
[1:14:57] Almighty amen he that was and is to come
[1:15:00] amen he that was and he that is to come
[1:15:03] so notice Hallelujah John amen he was
[1:15:08] just still there silent even though he
[1:15:11] saw in the vision what was go what was
[1:15:14] taking place he heard the words but he
[1:15:18] was silent why I say that do we know
[1:15:22] that even from the Wilderness when God
[1:15:26] had Israel in the wilderness he was
[1:15:29] training them to be
[1:15:31] one as a nation Israel worshiping a what
[1:15:36] you call a collaborative effort and it
[1:15:39] would produce a collaborative energy
[1:15:43] that will bring down the glory of God
[1:15:48] Amen that was wondess why God would said
[1:15:51] to Moses put the hark in the middle is
[1:15:55] it right in the center oh four tribes
[1:15:58] here four tribes there and all the
[1:16:01] tribes are right around amen the
[1:16:04] Tabernacle and a certain hour of the day
[1:16:08] the priest would blow the trumpet and
[1:16:11] all the host of Israel had to turn their
[1:16:15] Direction turn their gaze Amen in One
[1:16:19] Direction and all the house of Israel
[1:16:23] would bow down at the same time and they
[1:16:26] would say the same
[1:16:28] words
[1:16:30] hallelujah what is that that's Oneness
[1:16:33] has a Nation Oh My but whenever Lord
[1:16:38] Jesus came amen he had to show them what
[1:16:42] true Oneness was they have the writings
[1:16:46] of Moses they have the scriptures that
[1:16:50] Jesus said in John
[1:16:52] 5:39 search the scriptures for in it you
[1:16:55] find you think you have eternal life if
[1:16:59] you had believed Moses you would not
[1:17:01] believe me amen but he showed them true
[1:17:05] Oneness Glory when he said in John 14
[1:17:09] when you see me you said the
[1:17:12] father
[1:17:13] Hallelujah they had the writings of the
[1:17:17] prophets amen but they were not one with
[1:17:20] God that's right there were Million
[1:17:23] Miles Away From God we can have the
[1:17:26] writings and we are far from
[1:17:31] God
[1:17:34] hello you heard me change we can be down
[1:17:37] here practicing a group of principles we
[1:17:41] have pile of books and we are a million
[1:17:44] miles from Jehovah

[1:17:51] building and no relationship with

[1:17:58] God I have seen the bigger the building

[1:18:09] buildings our Orchestra is so laid out
[1:18:13] our music is so together and there is no
[1:18:18] God there is no relationship with God
[1:18:23] and yet there's a big label at the front
[1:18:26] message
[1:18:27] Church
[1:18:29] on nothing but a
[1:18:31] label Jesus showed him when you see me
[1:18:35] you said the father I am in the father
[1:18:39] I'm the father in
[1:18:43] me in that room together with elect when
[1:18:49] he lift up his eyes to the father I at
[1:18:52] John 17 now verse 22-
[1:18:55] 23 Jesus said father the glory that you

[1:19:14] what a
[1:19:15] relationship still what the god remember

[1:19:21] Jesus and his father was so
[1:19:23] perfect when you see him you see the
[1:19:26] father and then Jesus says further on he
[1:19:30] said in that same John
[1:19:31] 17:23 he said I am in you father and you
[1:19:35] are in me and I am in them so that they
[1:19:39] may be perfected in one that's where a
[1:19:43] Perfection comes in Oneness with God

[1:29:09] anymore
[1:29:10] amen woo
[1:29:12] hallelujah we're not even on
[1:29:15] mountman because M Mount Transfiguration
[1:29:18] took place on Mount
[1:29:20] irman Hallelujah
[1:29:23] but we're on Mount Rapture show
[1:29:26] down oh glory to God when you got that
[1:29:29] said the Lord there's a confidence that
[1:29:31] comes in there and closing there's a
[1:29:33] confidence that comes in there when he
[1:29:35] got done said the Lord is that right you
[1:29:39] remember when Jesus said to the
[1:29:40] disciples in John chapter
[1:29:42] 8:51 when he said he that keepeth my
[1:29:44] word shall not see death a strong
[1:29:48] statement there a strong statement he
[1:29:50] that keep my word you keep my word shall
[1:29:54] never see that that's what he said I
[1:29:56] believe
[1:29:59] Jesus is that right that's a strong
[1:30:03] word very strong
[1:30:05] word wow that's strong is that
[1:30:09] right look up that word keep it's a
[1:30:11] powerful word Jesus used that to had
[1:30:17] them God used that to hadam the Garden
[1:30:21] keep
[1:30:23] Jesus said to you you need to keep my
[1:30:25] word now there because there was a big
[1:30:27] difference when Jesus came between the
[1:30:28] scriptures and the his word you remember
[1:30:31] he shift the
[1:30:32] dimension you said to them in John
[1:30:34] chapter 5:39 you said search the
[1:30:37] scriptures he always Point them to the
[1:30:39] scriptures then he say if you keep my
[1:30:41] word the word word there in the Greek is
[1:30:43] Rema r h e m a which mean that which
[1:30:46] utters from a living
[1:30:50] being amen glory to God that's what he
[1:30:54] says keep my word my command a new
[1:30:55] commandment I give you but they could
[1:30:58] not they could not shift from that
[1:30:59] dimension of the letter and received the
[1:31:02] Living Word the word that was coming
[1:31:04] from a living
[1:31:05] being glory to God
[1:31:08] hallelujah so Jesus said if you keep my
[1:31:10] word now know the Sint of God he said
[1:31:14] you will never see that you got to
[1:31:17] understand the understanding and the
[1:31:19] meaning of the word of God that's
[1:31:21] important what we have today the
[1:31:24] revelated word of God yet the disciples
[1:31:27] according to the history everyone were
[1:31:30] they were all murdered except one
[1:31:34] brother
[1:31:35] John he died a natural
[1:31:38] death
[1:31:40] amen glory to God but what we have
[1:31:44] today what we have we have thus said the
[1:31:49] Lord y'all believe that we have we have
[1:31:51] th said the Lord we have the mind of
[1:31:56] Christ we have all of God the prophet W
[1:31:59] us he said it's not in a measure he said
[1:32:02] we have
[1:32:04] all the fullness of
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:08] God Jesus had a public Ministry yes from
[1:32:12] St John chapter one after John explained
[1:32:15] who he was then he went into his
[1:32:17] ministry and his public Ministry stopped
[1:32:19] at St John 12:50 and he started John
[1:32:23] Chapter 13 told you he was in the
[1:32:25] room with his Those whom he loved and he
[1:32:28] loved them unto the end it's a different
[1:32:31] level now he went
[1:32:33] intimate so you remember in that room
[1:32:36] Jesus said a few things that were a
[1:32:37] little confused a little while you will
[1:32:39] not see me but a little while you will
[1:32:41] see me a little while you won't see me
[1:32:43] but a little while you will see me you
[1:32:45] remember when you said to them I go to
[1:32:47] prepare a place for you and I'm coming
[1:32:49] back to receive you unto myself
[1:32:52] you shall know the way I am the way
[1:32:55] Hallelujah do you know the prophet said
[1:32:57] he said I don't believe that there is a
[1:32:59] building out there that you're going to
[1:33:00] go when Christ prepared that place that
[1:33:02] he prepared was a a
[1:33:07] body a
[1:33:08] [Applause]
[1:33:10] body Oh Glory to
[1:33:14] God in John 16 Jesus
[1:33:17] said the Bible said they were a little
[1:33:19] confused because he said something to
[1:33:21] them he said I've got much to say to you
[1:33:23] but you can't handle it now but when he
[1:33:25] the comforter come is going to bring all
[1:33:26] things back to you that I taught
[1:33:28] you but further on the Bible says when
[1:33:30] he keep saying that a little while I
[1:33:32] will not see you and then a little while
[1:33:34] you're going to see me again and they
[1:33:35] were like among themselves but Jesus
[1:33:37] knew their thoughts and one of them they
[1:33:40] were free to ask him you know M then
[1:33:42] Jesus said I know what's on your
[1:33:44] mind you're wonder why I'm saying a li
[1:33:46] while and he didn't explain it he said
[1:33:49] look here this is like about a woman
[1:33:51] above about to give birth she Sorrows
[1:33:54] now but when the amen the life comes
[1:33:57] forth in my words you don't mind but
[1:33:59] when the life comes forth that
[1:34:04] joy that joy that comes with that life
[1:34:08] no man can take it away he said you
[1:34:11] sorrow now Hallelujah but when uh that
[1:34:15] when you receive that Joy when you see
[1:34:18] me again that Joy woo Hallelujah no man
[1:34:22] can take it away from you glory to God
[1:34:25] what was that Joy when they were in that
[1:34:28] room and the resurrected Christ uh
[1:34:32] stepped through that
[1:34:34] wall amen when he reveal himself to them
[1:34:39] in that resurrected glorified man the
[1:34:43] Bible said they
[1:34:45] Rejoice
[1:34:46] Hallelujah they Rejoice brothers and
[1:34:50] sisters as this word uh burst into your
[1:34:54] spiritual womb uh transform you from

[1:35:26] principalities uh no powers no hen can
[1:35:32] separate you from that love that brought
[1:35:36] about that
[1:35:44] Joy when you enter that resurrected
[1:35:47] realm you do like Andrew did
[1:35:52] is shows that while you
[1:35:55] remember when Andrew's mother went to
[1:35:59] Jesus and said can you promise me
[1:36:01] something that when you go to your
[1:36:03] father make sure two tones one on the
[1:36:05] left one on the right for my two boys
[1:36:09] any good mother would want that I think
[1:36:12] I preached it on one Mother's Day I said
[1:36:14] come on she says okay to be a little
[1:36:17] selfish because you want the best place
[1:36:19] in heaven for your two boys Jesus say
[1:36:22] hey actually there a strong Quest but I
[1:36:26] hope they can drink from the same cup
[1:36:29] that I'll be drinking
[1:36:30] from Hallelujah and Thomas resonated in
[1:36:34] his heart and history shows that they
[1:36:37] made a cross for Thomas CU he was
[1:36:38] hanging the cross and the shows that as
[1:36:41] he was going to it it says that Thomas
[1:36:44] saluted the cross because he
[1:36:47] knew that that was just the beginning of
[1:36:51] his
[1:36:52] transition they said Andrew sorry andw
[1:36:55] they said Andrew saluted the cross he
[1:36:58] said have waited for this long time oh
[1:37:01] Hallelujah glory to God because he knew
[1:37:05] as he drink that cup he'll be right in
[1:37:08] the presence of almighty God woo glory
[1:37:12] to
[1:37:14] God what shall separate you from that
[1:37:18] joy I love to see Christ Christians walk
[1:37:22] with that
[1:37:25] Joy the prophet say you know he says if
[1:37:28] you worry and not fear your testimony is
