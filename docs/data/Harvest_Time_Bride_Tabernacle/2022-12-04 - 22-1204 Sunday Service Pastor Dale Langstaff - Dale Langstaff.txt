reading a quotes on they have a couple books and brother Carson actually give me one and I had one already a book from the prophet on pastors and he talks in there about pastors the state of the church and many times the prophet blames pastors because he says you grow calm into the people and you're afraid to tell them the truth you know the truth but you're afraid to tell them the truth amen God help us God help us I don't ever want to be in that state amen amen let's just read our scripture I I really struggle to know where to go today I have two messages and one I don't feel like I'll be able to preach and I don't know that I will have the voice to but uh amen amen let's go to John 13 34 and 35. apologize for being sick it was seemed like only a month ago we had Brother Joseph Tom be here preaching because I couldn't talk and I mean I don't know it's just uh it just is what it is amen John 13 amen so next Sunday uh brother John Garrett will be with us from they live in Fort Wayne Indiana but he's been here before and I'm not sure how many they have four kids but the couple of the oldest ones well the oldest one has a friend and so she didn't know if she could survive a weekend without being with her friend and so you know how that goes and but uh they'll be with us next Sunday and of course Friday night is our fun night and we encourage you to invite many many people amen you know just uh I'm sorry you're standing but I seen Pastor Jose put on a post and it was it was beautiful and he said if you're not trying to win souls for Christ your backslip amen they don't have to believe like you our Prophet said that just get them to Christ leave leave it all up to Christ don't tell them about the seals they won't have a clue what you're talking about amen just tell them about Christ amen if you're not winning Souls you're backslit amen just invite people don't worry about how they come amen that's a note reach it's a way to outreach and bring souls to Christ amen amen we're going to read 34 and 35. a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have one love one for the other let's go to Psalms 133 one to three amen I may uh go into my message my next message after this but behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity that's beautiful it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard and even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments Hallelujah one more as the Dew of Haman and as the Dew that was descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded watches the Lord commanded the blessings even life Evermore because of unity the Lord commanded the blessings and even life every morning Lord Jesus we ask you to add the blessing to your word Lord and we just pray that you'll lead us and and show us where to go this morning Lord Jesus and your word and bless your people in your name we pray amen amen I just apologize for those you may have your seats apologize for the ones online I'm just preaching without a Time Lake because if I cough I can turn away from the pulpit Mike amen and we just want to remember Sister Patty and Jared's kids different ones at home and also just remember our trip to Uganda everything seems to be coming together beautifully and just good reports from Pastor Leo too for there and and the churches really they were Plastering the church and the windows in and it really looked amazing really really did amen so we praise God for that amen I wanted to uh my original thoughts and and before I was sick and my original message that I have sitting right here amen and we may touch on it but my original title would have been spiritual conditioned spiritual con sorry spiritual contagious diseases spiritual contagious diseases spiritually speaking even physically speaking we can get diseases and they're highly contagious you know even in this flu season the number one thing they'll tell you to do is wash your hands wash your hands and face wash your doorknobs wash your clothes amen and and I believe in sour amen don't be afraid of water it won't hurt you amen we do these things and sometimes we still amen get diseases amen but spiritually speaking their spiritual diseases that are contagious in the body amen and I want to I want to show you something and and I'm not going to try to finish this I'll finish it later and and also I'm sorry I'm so uh out to lunch this morning but for uh Sunday is New Year's and I'd like to have communion at foot washing January 1st that'll be the week after Christmas now if that is catastrophe for anybody we'll just move it back a week hey man but we'll do that Sunday morning we'll Minister on communion and we'll have community in Fort Washington January 1st here there's a perfect example and we know that our profit was a type of typologist you know and he taped the natural to the spiritual and I want to show you this before we go into to our contagious diseases and and positive can be contagious but negativity can be contagious too and not that I'm preaching on negativity because I'm not but I want to show you an example of something that God created and it matches just beautifully with the bride of Christ and that is the Canadian geese Canadian geese if you look into their study and I have I have a Google print out of the five of the most peculiar things that Canadian geese are and Canadian geese it's not by no chance that they fly in a V formation it's not no chance that they fly behind one another and it's not no chance that they honk they don't just honk because they're dumb brute animals and if you compare that to the bride of Christ and if you compare that to the church it's so beautiful you know our Prophet said and I'm not putting it on you but the prophet said that a Ministry 50 of it is the people the people came to the prophet and they said to him they said Oh Brother praying they said I would have loved to heard your message but I was so sidetracked because the person was shouting amen and praise the Lord and just distracted me completely that I couldn't even comprehend or hear what you were saying and brother Brown said he said if they wouldn't have been shouting praise the Lord and amen he said I would have been distracted and I wouldn't have been able to minister the word because they were pulling on the word so I was ministered Canadian geese when they're flying hunk and his Sciences proved it that it is the sole purpose is to encourage the goose in front of them that they can continue and fly their distance farther they've also proven that a Canadian geese when they fly together and they fly in their formation and hunk and say Amen that they can fly 71 percent farther 71 percent farther amazing Amanda they've proven it that when they fly in the v formation that they fly just slightly elevated from the one in front of them and the updraft comes underneath the bottom one and it actually eases his percentage in the high 70 percent rate to Flying and to the point that when the goose would get out of the updraft he would immediately feel the drag of the world on him and come back into line immediately because he just stepped out of the updraft he's compare that to the Holy Ghost it's just beautiful beautiful Amanda said when they fly in the v formation what it creates the updraft and the one or the one the one that spotted said it reduces the friction compare that spiritually when we're together and unified it reduces the friction of the world and the drag on your life I you know I mentioned I was reading Pastor books and you know quotes that our Prophet said about pastors and I'm going to tell you something that Satan is real and and no one including holy ghost-filled people are not affected with the drag of the world on your life amen and me as a minister I'm sorry I'm not well I'm actually I'm not sorry I don't apologize for saying the truth and God by God's grace if he would always help me to say the truth the church will be empty but we'll still be saying the truth because I would never want to get to Glory and him saying to all these people here their blood is on your hands because you just refuse to tell them all you just had to do was tell them the truth all I have to do to go and not have somebody else's blood on that's walked out of this church it's just to have told them the truth God help me amen you know the you know the world considers uh you know we're talking about natural type and you you consider the spider how they weed their web and their web is basically on scene and sticky and it will catch their prey and then they'll come back on their web and they will eat it and that's a perfect type of Satan and don't be deceived watches Church don't be deceived Satan knows exactly what he's doing that's why our internet is called the web and it is the most deceptive thing in the world you know our Prophet preached against TV and one of the two of the main things he preached against TV was this was you and miss church for TV amen but he said you can't control TV and I'll guarantee you I don't care if your Holy Ghost filled or not internet and we're going to 5G now amen the web is uncontrollable because I've been in my house with my wife and but listen to a Minister preach the gospel and the very next web page underneath is somebody that's just not off a bit but if you would have pushed on that it would have been straight from a message preaching to straight up full-fledged pornography you mad what God could use for for good Satan has Twisted through the web of his of his web and he plans on eating you alive man and you can say well what would I do without the internet well I'll tell you this you are what you eat spiritually and I wouldn't use it no more than you need amen when the prophet preached against TV was he he said you might be watching if it was possible maybe a hundred years ago it was you might be watching a movie that was if it was possible a hundred years ago okay but he said you couldn't control the the commercials you can't control the commercials on the web you can go listen to whatever you want on the web amen it's of the devil and it's real and I'll tell you what and I mean I'm really I preaching on this I just I've seen it and I've seen but I'm going to tell you what God don't change and you know our Prophet is just I I hardly day goes by I'm not in studying it you know the prophet talked about he said you know the the methodists when they were Holiness it was wrong for people to go to movie shows got their hair said you moved the movie show right in your living room and you all cut your hair but you're still singing in the choir God never changed you were going to hell 100 years ago you're still going to hell to do that if it was wrong to paint your face like just about it's still wrong to paint your face to wear high heels to show your body or to wear the wrong clothing amen you say why are you preaching on that and getting it off my chest it's it's serious business you know and if that gives you a complex there ain't nothing I can do about it I'm sorry for you but I can't fix it and I want to show you this morning through Satan's web that that's his plan and that's what he's done through the web even in I don't mean in our we're online this morning amen you know I've seen a special and I don't mean it this is no pun intended but time is a blur and if I would have had my voice I would have sang a song I sang five years ago today I say consider the lilies five years ago behind the pulpit of a special and it was just I wore the same vest and you think what it was just five years ago it was like what happened where did the five years go it'll be like that in five more years amen but Satan through the web is is is is This is distracting us and causing us to to to pull us out of fellowship and unity you've seen the scriptures that we read you know watch this watch this he's pulling us out of unity and don't worry if they think I don't even you could even care less about their Doctrine if another church this time of year has a service go to it you're not going to get leprosy amen spiritually speaking amen Show Yourself friendly Christ didn't stay in a box Jesus went to the town amen he spoke the truth but he went to the Towny man he didn't he didn't hide and here Satan has built the web and he's built it in the church he's built it the strongest in message churches God help me and he's built in the world and it's contagious it is called the complex and it's very contagious and it'll pull you out of fellowship and it'll pull you miles from God and the reason it'll pull you miles from God is because it'll pull you from your brothers and sisters amen it's of the devil in every part of it is of the devil amen let's just step aside and look at the goose again they say as long as they're able to stay in unity I already told you they could fly up to 75 percent farther they said if I if uh they said ghosts if they become injured or sick because it's so hard to be alone consider a complex because it's so hard to be alone two ghosts will go back and sit and wait for the ghosts that's injured or sick and so when he comes back and tries to catch up to the flock he don't have to catch up alone because the drag would be so hard on his weak body we could learn so much from nature just in the church how we treat each other God help us amen due to the due to the the v formation and the the lift that is Created from the ones behind them they said our God is an amazing person he said no one man no one Goose was be able to take the leadership of the goose alone and so God made a faithful Ministry so when a pastor or Minister was down there was somebody else that wasn't down and they would drop to the very back to get the most lift from all the other goose and another five-fold would step right into his position oh it's beautiful if a dumb brute geese that goes to my field to try to eat all my wheat knows more about the gospel the message people sitting in churches it's not a one-man show it's not a pastor show it's not a Dale show it's a it's a group show amen they say in doing this for the leadership of the position because God created a five-fold Ministry it and it shows that other people have skills and talents and knowledge and experiences that can be used for every single other goose to support them as they fly it just sounds like God wrote the goose it's unbelievable it's unbelievable I already told you about how why they honked they said when they honked behind one another it encourages them to maintain their speed and keep flying to their extended goal to not stop before their goal wow God help us amen also gives the goose feedback when they're all honking gives them feedback from one another as a tape of not just encouragement but communication how they are doing amen Gates when they fly south they always fly to the same location the word of God they never leave their original plan it's beautiful they say here they say because the ones are raised and births on the way or before they go the Elder ones will show the younger geese the way that they take to escape the cold weather as the Bible says that the older sisters will train up teach the younger sisters and all these different things that the Bible teaches us all watch how they close here he says for all for the purpose of the team when they just get to the goal and it includes for the for the good the culture of the group it's all for the team of God Amen to learn the mission of where they're going and how it'll be done how they teach the other one younger ones encourage the team members to share experiences by their honking it's like praying for one another they share experiences learning that they came across in their work and encourage new members to learn from their comrades a goose here let's just look at a scripture here and I don't know how far we'll go but I want to show you some Bible examples of what Satan's done in God's family and it's of the devil and it's called the web and it's everywhere and I want to show you how Holy Ghost filled people are affected by the web of Satan numbers 20. starting at seven Amy I know what you're thinking or might think they might say well at this time in the Bible the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet but I didn't give you our up-to-date examples yet the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather today to assemble it together and thou and Aaron and thy brother and speak unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the Rock The Rock was the Faith of Christ so thou so give it to the congregation and their Beast to drink the water was the type of the Holy Spirit spiritually speaking and Moses took the rod before God the Lord as he commanded him I want to stop right there that Rod that Moses took got Moses had seen God do a lot of stuff through the rod it wasn't just a physical Rod to Moses like it would be to us see Moses had seen God part in the Red Seas with the rod he had seen God he'd throw his rod down and it turned into a serpent and Pharaoh's you know the serpents ate it and then Moses turned around and picked his up and it became a rod so it's don't be too hard on Moses I know we're going to criticize Moses for making a mistake here but Moses would have considered his rod pretty holy don't take my rod I mean if you see God works through something like that I think it was pretty holy too but God never said rod and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them this is where Satan came on the scene here ye here now you rebels these were God's people here now you rebels you're a huge pain in the neck to me must we me and Aaron fetch water out of this rock to you now he was immediately making himself to the supernatural that it was his own ability to bring water out of that rock and even though God had raised Moses up and he was a prophet and yes he was God to Pharaoh he was not able to bring water out of that rock you see how Satan's web had grabbed onto a predestinated god-called man and he was offended why was he offended he was completely a free man was he offended because God brought him out of Egypt open the Red Sea fed him gave him all the riches of Egypt and did Miracles after Miracles come down with the pillar of fire and let him in the night time in the cloud in the day Moses lifted up his hands and with the rod that special rod he smote The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation eight their drank and their beasts also now if you were in the right Church you'd just say well praise God everything's good but if you look back before God never mentioned nothing about him taking the rod is to take the the rod and gather the assembly together but not to get the water amen just see how close the difference was and that's just like the kind of web that God will try to catch us in in our day like in the internet we'll say well bless God I'm listening to music make sure it's the right music amen if you're listening to stuff that your kids can't babies can't watch if you're watching a movie that that Leah can't watch then you can't watch it either if you don't want Leah slobbering on a 10 year old boy when she finds her first love then why would you watch a movie that's like that that's Satan's web the same as well and the Lord spank unto Moses and Aaron he said because thou believeth me not how could God say that you got the water for him because he didn't obey to signify me in the eyes and to what's that the word honey to sanctify sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation the land which I'd given them and the land the promised land then was the type of the Holy Ghost and Moses wouldn't lead those people to the holy ghost or you might say lead them to Christ the anointed one he would not lead those people to the anointed one because of one little boo-boo what was it a little bit it wasn't pornography he was still in the church he was gathered with the Believers the need was met it was almost proper you think of well I I almost did everything right I don't care if you almost do it right you won't be there amen see Moses got worn out with the people of God and we can get worn out with the people of God just because they don't do what we expect them to do and see this is Satan's whole plan is and that's why it's called the web now just consider the spider the spider don't plan on the Fly seeing the web and the fighter don't tell the fly that it's sticky too and he definitely don't tell him that I'm going to walk back out and eat you alive neither does Satan tell you that when you got the Holy Ghost and he can give you a complex by showing you something maybe not even wrong that he will he will he will he will pull you out of the uni he will he will uh single you out by yourself and you will fly 71 percent less farther and slower because you're not getting the updraft of the Holy ghost-filled Believers in the church because you're thinking you're because see now anytime you get a combat I got to stay behind this mic anytime you get a complex it's because you're right and of course the people you have a complex with they're wrong but guess who had effects not the ones that are wrong by your opinion they don't even know what happened amen see Satan is such a professional you say but this would never happen today our prophet got a complex and he told God he said I'm gonna he was actually with this boy and he he told him not to tell his wife and he said when I get back home and pick up my honey and I'm going up north and I'm going to be like the prop Bibles and the prophet I'm going to follow the word of God perfectly that sounds good don't it Moses was using his Rod that God had worked through on a regular basis multiple multiple multiple types Moses Rod was a Moses or Aaron's rod budded in the in the holies of holies used to open the Red Sea used it in Pharaoh's thing with The Serpent and the snag picked it out in the back to and God told our prophet he said well let's just look at the prophets in the bible they didn't live with the people our Prophet had a very good example said all the prophets went out in the wilderness and when you wanted them to go tell the people something that you give them thus saith the Lord he went in and told the king boom he blasted out fired and works was out for two or three days and went right back in the wilderness and prayed and fasted and served God that sounds really good and God taught our prophet he said if you do that your wife will leave you you'll become a bomb a drunker because that's not what I called you to because our Prophet had to Peculiar work and God called the max to the work of an evangelist that means he was with the people even though he was a prophet that's what he says himself so an evangelist can't be an evangelist in the wilderness because there ain't no evangelist than to do even though he was a prophet in the field of evangelist s and standing in the Gap here I want to show you some examples of people and how easy it is to get in this uh spot here uh Brother Band of Stockton but he said pray that God will place back in my heart something that I lost there in that complex now I want to I I would say to you is did Brother Branham have the Holy Ghost well you don't have to answer that because of course he had the Holy Ghost amen and he said it was so easy I'm reading quote word for word it was so easy to build the complex now our Prophet seen the powerful move of God in a dynamic way like most of Amen on a daily basis how in the world when he's seen this Red Seas open the pillar fire lead them at night and the cloud that day and come in between the Egyptian Army and them before they were blocked by the Red Sea and seeing them leave Egypt with all the richest 2 million strong and all the wealth of Egypt and their firstborn not die and and they had a complex so if you tell me this morning or somebody tells me that's the reason people walk out of church is because the minister touches on something they don't want they have a complex and they'll just and they it's and and it's exactly things planned because it's it singles you out and Satan tells you that you're the Holy One because you're the one standing for truth but you'll fly 71 percent less slower and you'll be 71 percent less weaker because you're not in the Unified how good and pleasant it is to be in the body amen and I had an interview the other day with brother Wade sitting here and standing in front a good man but he built himself around a complex another kind of a complex and it did the same thing brother Wade you can easily see what it did a little something in your mind keep you thinking and you go back and you check with the scriptures and see if it's not right and then go from there and go on but he said don't lose the feeling of the people and that's not for a minister see the people can lose the feeling of the people the prophet talked about I believe it was the prophet or it was in the third world countries but I believe it was a prophet and I was reading in the past month or so and when the people would leave at the beginning of the thing that they would be shaking hands to say goodbye and the people would be sobbing because they couldn't imagine there was going to be six days before they would see him again solving he said you must remember that those people that you lost a feeling for are not made out of sawdust they're actually flesh and blood that Christ died for their soul he said pray for me that God will give me back the feeling that I once had for the people here's another example in a paradox is a 6308 quote and he says because no one can change the spirit of a man he said and he gives him a new birth outside of God here he's talking about a boy that was friends with the girl amen and he had uh you know done something where I believe he broke up with the girl and he'd hurt the girl anyway and the boy wouldn't apologize for him and the prophet said he said let me read just the Highlight part he said there was a fine young man a very fine man and a girl and a fine family and something happened the boy just walked away from the girl and he did something to the girl and so much as he had promised oh he promised to marry her or to do something a certain thing and it didn't didn't do it was a merrier just had promised to do something for her and instead of coming back to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman what he said it just wasn't in that boy to do it but see it was even though his family were Christians amen this is a fairly long quote we're not going to dwell on it but it it didn't matter he said it he was operating under the gene of the old man and even though his mom and dad were holy ghost-filled people came to Holy Ghost filled people he said the dad was strictly an Irishman which is Moody and high tempered and high strung and uh you know he's talking about the different traits of the family and the girls family you know they were close to church uh but he said it was it wasn't they weren't a type of family to ask forgiveness or pardon he talked about the the German background is very proud background he said you could pass him by the street and they'd stare right at you I mean stare at you man and like you and not until you had I wouldn't even Flinch I just he said it was the weirdest thing but he said I was just their genes are their parents amen and the genes of the father and mother of this boy no matter how much they were converted Still Remains a flesh that had inbred out of this boy and there the boy had got a complex in them in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving and they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands amen and he goes and talks about how the only way you could get rid of that complex and the only way you could to not have that was to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and he had to have it personally it wouldn't matter that the parents had it it wouldn't have affected the boy at all amen it just wasn't in his nature to do that but but there's many examples I want to stress on you was and even in the prophet and the other brother that was right in there with brother Brown was there's holy ghost-filled bannisters and people with complex ministers are the most common to get a complex because they feel like the brother Brown did because he didn't feel like the people heard his message amen you can get a complex when you sing a special and you see somebody make a face because you miss a tune or you don't think they're paying attention or whatever or somebody falls asleep or man or you singing special and somebody don't tell you it was a great special or it's just you're just imagining it you can be doing something up front here and somebody can put their head down and you say see they can't even stand me being behind the pulpit and maybe in reality they're actually praying for you but Satan didn't tell you that it's called the web and when he gets you alone you'll be destroyed because God didn't make us to live alone God didn't make us to serve him alone God didn't make us to stay in our house alone amen forsake not to something of yourself together and like matter as some have already done but to assemble together all the more as you see Satan bring it up the web the very good preaching that's on the internet Satan will turn and used for a web to catch people at a fellowship whoa questions and answers 64 he said when a person realizes they have an inferior complex or a sort of some sort of a complex how may they overcome this this is a question amen that they asked the prophet and this he give very very short answer but very very good answer he said if God if you see yourself getting in a complex do exactly the opposite of what your complex is you don't think somebody likes your singing go up and ask them if they like your singing man if you're nervous about new people coming to church make sure you go they're the first one you talk to amen you got a complex because you go late in the food line make sure you go first next time whatever it would be do the exact opposite he said do exactly the opposite and if you're always wanting your way and a little brat that always wants his way and everything your way he said turn back around and give everything you got away he said if you're selfish and you want to hold on to everything he said start giving everything you own away he said do whatever it takes just they said do vice versa he said that's the way to overcome what Satan's trying to put on you amen Moses Hears A standing and a god finishing this quote in paragraph 160 Moses lost the feeling of the people because they wouldn't listen to him and it bothered and brother Roy you see in your dream and he's talking about the people and because you say well this complex won't hurt me because I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I can serve God alone because I know I'm right well sorry to tell you but I'm not sorry to tell you but Moses never went to the promised land which was the type of the Holy Ghost because of his complex Hi man and anybody that takes one word from the word or add one word to the word his name will be taken out of the Lamb's Book of Life so how's that going to do when you're in your own web when the word says you can't live in your own web amen see it used to be Satan knows exactly how to get where he's going but it won't hinder God's work it used to be in the old watch this just I know you are younger than me but in the olden days everybody went to town for Fellowship nowadays nobody has to go to town I was talking to restaurant owner yesterday I sell patties to he said before covet he said Friday night was my biggest week night I made more money on Friday night than any night of the week said it was party night he said the place I've been there on Friday night when I had to wait almost outside the door you could physically the lineup would be so long to go for a table he said now Friday night is the smallest part of the day of the week that I have all seven days he said people have come accustomed to staying alone and staying home he said I make the least amount of money that I make on any night on Friday night he said but that's just a restaurant Satan knows exactly what he's doing don't kid yourself I had somebody tell me I was reaching out to people that's been here to church and not here for a while and they live an hour from church and you know new Believers and he said you know brother Dale he said last time we were there you were preaching that you didn't think you would Harvest your soybeans this fall before God to come back I said you know what brother I'm supposed to say but I said I still think that way I said now I'd be saying I don't think I'll be planting my soybeans but it's a web that Satan plans on saying well it's never going to be it's never going to come it's never and he pulls you alone and then he eats you do you know when a spider comes in do we eat his prey you can check this on Google but I believe it's correct that they normally start eating at the head but spider comes you don't start eating the Flies and wings you don't eat the waste in his stomach just think of that spiritually and you I don't mean to have even him in the minister of the fight for a Ministry just think of yourself in the web it's coming the greatest bottle ever fought in your mind it's destroying trying to destroy the bride of Christ here's a person that came in the prayer line he said you were in an accident and you were gasped by carbon dioxide he said is that true and he said it poisoned you and it poisoned hurt your liver and it troubled you now watch how watch I'm showing you different ways that Satan worked and he said it troubled you in your stomach because your liver was poisoned what's that got to do with the web and you had trouble with your heart is that right he said yes and it made you so nervous way to make him nervous until you built the complex and you were afraid to be around people and you were afraid to go back to work you were afraid to be around God's people because of a car accident was no other believer's fault he got carbon dioxide poisoning it affected his liver and heart his stomach and it made him nervous and anxious they built a complex and he wanted to single himself out and die amen see Satan wasn't able to kill the guy in the accident so he was going to try to kill him with the complex in his web and here we recently here here recently it's our Prophet talking 630707 an indictment he said recently I was going to quit preaching because the people wouldn't hear me and they just kept on doing the same thing and I got discouraged and I built the complex I said oh my God a couple Sundays ago if you'll just give me a sign out here I was our prophet and you say well he had a lot of followers and he had a lot of problems if he got a complex and he preached to ten thousand and millions and he's seen the power of God moving the things come on what do you think about ministers that have a small group and more people have left than have stayed man has educated themselves to the point that they've educated themselves away from one another and they get complexes and you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love and that's where that's where you get is love not a complex but when you get educated and you start thinking I'm a little bit bigger than someone else and I'm a little bit bigger than other than someone else and I know a little more than someone else I got more Revelation than the next preacher where's Revelation come from amen you like we must make God just cry God help us amen he said you cannot have fellowship with god without coming to God's agreement and there's no basic there's no and there's a base thing for fellowship and that's the blood and blood only and that's been God's way from the beginning and it will till the end the only place of Fellowship is through the blood and up the paragraph before he said and I love fellowship and it comes by love and love requires love requires Fellowship let me show you an example of that that complex that came in and and we're doing better than I thank you Jesus for my my voice amen we're doing better Matthew 21 here we'll read a scripture starting at nine and you can go to that Amy and the multitudes went before and followed and cried Hosanna to the son of David and blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord and hosanna in the highest and he came into Jerusalem and the city was moved saying whom is this and the multitude said it is Jesus a prophet of Nazareth of Galilee Jesus went to temple of God and cast out them the bottom sword in the temple and overthrew the table the money changers and the seats that sold doves I always I can't help but saying it but remember they were doing Godly things by selling these things people needed them for sacrifice but their emphasis was on the money and he said unto them it is rent in my house shall be called The House of Prayer but you have made it the den of Thieves and the blind in the lame came to him in the temple and they were healed now this is a punch line now 15 and the preachers of the day the chief priests and the scribes I want to emphasize this part the second line there saw the wonderful things that Jesus did they saw the wonderful things that Jesus did and the children cried in the temple saying Hosanna to the son of David and the same people we're sore displeased and he said unto them hear South what these say and Jesus said unto them yea have you never read that out of the month mouth of babes and suckling he has perfected praise Hallelujah they had a complex because they weren't the center of attention who cares would Christ was present are you getting it they wanted to be ahead of Christ wow God help us amen we're going to close here shortly here he said in the ballet ditches he said that's a matter with churches today he said they've got so much selfishness everywhere and he didn't he say this at the Church of the Living God's got so much differences and so much of this till they grieve the Holy Spirit away from them you see and I'll tell you this because I I want to be a church that is a soul-saving church and outreaching amen I know we're at the end times and we're gleaning but I want to give you an example you know Farmers have become big farmers now they've got huge combines and 50-foot augers and they normally can't hit the grain buggy and and they have their kid driving the green buggy and we see grains spilled all over the place in the roads amen and also the trackers they don't because they're fat like me they don't get in to sweep out the truck and so when they dump the truck at the elevator there's always four or five pails in there and if they get a call when they've left the elevator and it's different grain then they have to stop on the road and by force they have to get in sweep out the grain and all of my family knows this we've drove around the roads with pails picking up Delaney this year when I was taking stuff to the mechanic I was driving I was driving one Speck out of my way I noticed being so the next time I took equipment there I took seven pails of meal away without a shovel we skipped up seven pails of soybeans just dumped on the road but they were still beings so I understand I didn't get the whole being field and I understand spiritually speaking that we're in a gleaning age but I don't ever spiritually want to think that I'm going to drive down the road spiritually speaking and see seven Souls on the side of the road seven pails of beans and say Well they're not worth stopping to pick up amen because they were worth stopping and picking up I didn't even I didn't even I didn't even have to go to my way to pick up them seven Souls because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord he set me by those seven Souls amen but remember when those seven Souls come in they're not going to have the Revelation or the understanding or the time or anything else that you would expect them to have or you or me maybe think we have or do have but see it's not us that makes a new believer grow in Christ it's Christ that makes a new believer grow in Christ it's an anointing it's the oil it's the oil the holy spirit it's The Presence of Jehovah God where you can help but grow in the light of his presence you don't have to say anything amen oh I understand that you know God has times that we say things and I understand that ministers will say things but when God does it amen if somebody is new in the church and they come in and you know it's out of order but it's the first time you've seen them amen just let it go if a new person comes in and they're talking in the sanctuary and they're not being respectful like we've learned in church order and Doctrine amen it'll be okay amen do you know the prophet when he preached in the third world countries before the Holy Ghost came down I this is amazing I've seen this myself but when he preached and and you'll know where it was the people the ladies had no clothes they were topless and nothing he never preached on dress code and brother Dale believes in Holiness oh you won't see God without holiness but see they got the Holy Ghost and Holiness came with it and as soon as they got the Holy Ghost they folded their arms and left and came back the next day with clothes and they hadn't preached on holiness never even preached unholiness but there's a big difference if you've been raised in the church and you come like that you better look out because God will tell me God has a big hammer here and when he starts hitting me a few times and I see it coming the next time I didn't let her fly and if that means you're going to go home and and stay and say I'm going to serve God by myself I fear God's Hammer more than I fear your complex amen amen he said no matter how bad someone ever treats you or anything don't never don't never be guilty of letting the thing anchor in your soul it'll grieve the Holy Spirit Away man for the people that have built a complexity man we want to do everything we can to get them out of that state encourage them and whatever it would take but but ultimately it has to be their decision to snap out of it you can you can greet them and shake their hand and but if you get a complex because they have a complex and you really have troubles amen God help us we don't want to lose our Holy Ghost because of a complex this is my last quote is your life worthy of the Gospel in 63. he said when it takes a place of the thing that you do do then he said you'll find that the holy spirit will come in you in the new birth and you'll believe to do everything that God says in his word is for you to do and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do and you're you're prostrated before the word of God Amen you you punctuate every word with Amen to the word of God Amen I'm just dropping down and he says he says you say I'll speak in tongues or you might do that and you might not he said I'll show you might do that and you might not but there's one thing for sure that you'll do you'll bear the fruits of the spirit the spirit the fruits of the spirit will be now people misconceive this and I know there's people listening this morning they're going to miss conceive this let me give you a perfect example of a love the prophet said that if your kids were playing on the road and it was a highway I'm adding that in if it's a road like ours there might only be one cargo down the whole day it's probably some old man sightseeing on the wilkesport road he's 93 and he's got all day to get home it wouldn't matter if the kids did play in the roads he'd want to stop and talk to him but he said if you love that kid you'd get a switch when you went out to the road and you'd whip that kid back to the house because he will die playing on the road but we don't want that kind of love because you got to switch but that's love and if you love the child and spare the rod you actually hate the child amen spare the rod and spoil the child you hate him so let's just get the fruits of the spirit in the right order amen so spiritually speaking if if a minister is standing behind the pulpit and he sees you intentionally going to hell and knows that you know you're going to hell but you need a wake-up call and that Minister don't give you the wake-up call he actually hates you he actually hates you enough to allow you to go to hell thinking you're all right that's the proper type of spirit of love the fruits of the spirit are love joy peace Faith long-suffering meekness gentleness and patience your temperance will not be oh I oh just remember when you got that that poisoned the Holy Spirit away will move away from you your temper will be he said if you get the temper you allow that to come in the holy spirit will move away from you and when you get to the place that you want to fuss with everybody and come around and do something wrong then you get to a place where the minister can read the Bible and tell you the truth and tell you what's wrong and do certain things that's wrong Now by your fruits you shall know them amen because a Believer never ever struggles with the word of God it don't matter how the delivery is with the word of God amen If It's Love coming from God the whole purpose is to get the child off the road if the switch don't do it then maybe you need but remove the child from the road amen and if that offends the child does the parent apologize of course not because the parent loves the child amen God loves us enough to give us his Holy Spirit and fivefold Ministry that will shake us to recognize you know God God is amazing I never had one word about the web until God gave it to me when I woke up this morning I wrote one word in my note that was the web you can't get any pressure than that from God and you think how Satan everything he's done and there'll be billions billions of people in hell because of the internet web is Satan's weapon even though our message this morning is going to be posted on that beware it don't make that web holy because today's message is posted on it amen Let's Dance amen you know how when the ones came before Jesus and Satan came up there and the throne in heaven and Satan said what are you doing he said going to and through through the world seeking whom I may devour by his weapon amen this world that we live in we are great human nature is great adapters but Satan has brought everything and hell has came up and you know I I I it just comes to me I'm sorry but this is fresh but I think of the minister and brother Brown told the story that was a holy Godly Minister and he didn't even you know the web wasn't around forever you know the web wasn't around when me and Luanne and were married wasn't always that you couldn't live in your house without the internet it is possible you'll you'll survive you can still have kids and you know breathe and all those things I was actually thinking this week of actually getting the rid of the web at our house I just think about that for a second because I can come to the church anytime I need the web I can find anything I want radioactive Church would cost me a penny more I have the web on my phone this Minister got to heaven and completely inhabited brother Brown tells the story and this this is just this is how it wasn't but but he said in the presence of God you think you're a message Billy I think I'm a message believer and I think I'm okay but in his presence our righteousness looks like filthy rights that's the Bible brother Dale's nice tie in all this looks like filthy dirty rights that's powerful because I don't I don't see that this morning but God's that Holy and you know the story about the minister got there and he said did you ever lied he said no no of course I never lied I was a minister but he said in that presence I remember what the things that I just you know fudged just or didn't tell everything or do you ever this just and he said I got he said it was just the the presence said Lord I'm guilty of everything but he said before I got there I wasn't guilty of any of it but it was the presence that made me guilty amen God help God help me God help me amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus
