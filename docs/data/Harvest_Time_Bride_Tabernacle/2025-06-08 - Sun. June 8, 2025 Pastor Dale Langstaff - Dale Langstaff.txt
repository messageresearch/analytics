Thank you, musicians. Thank you, Jared. Amen. We're going to take our Bibles and turn to 2 Corinthians 5:20. We just welcome everyone and our visitor and just good to good to be here. Amen. We want to look at a thought here that God desires us to come to. Amen. And many of the bride of Christ will. Amen. And now then we are ambassadors for Christ. As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christstead. Be ye reconciled to God. Amen. Amen. Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll add your blessing to the word and and just be with every heart and hearer here this morning and be with the speaker. Lord, we thank you for touching my voice and my body and Lord, God bless those that have prayed for me in sickness. Lord, just be with this word today. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. Just uh thank all of you that have prayed for me. Wednesday night, I had almost zero voice at all, but God is good and and we just praise him for his touch. We want to look and title our message today on ambassadors. Amen. And you know, ambassadors is more than somebody that's a citizen of a country. It's more than somebody that's just a uh you know, you know, a a citizen or a member of an organization, but it's somebody that can be trusted and and and put confidence in to be sent out in a representation. That's right. for another government. That's right. And here here Paul's telling us in Corinthians that now we are God's ambassadors. That's why we are not our own, but we are Christ. And we are actually not speaking our own thoughts, but we're speaking Christ's thoughts. Amen. We're not speaking our own words. We're speaking Christ's word. And and you know the prophet goes into this a bunch but you know if we look in Ephesians 2:19-21 he says now we are therefore therefore ye are now more strangers and foreigners but citizens with the saints and the household of God. And you're built up upon the foundations of apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together and groweth unto the holy temple of God. Amen. You know, to be an ambassador, Brother Bam said in in the end time seats, he said because Christ has died and resurrected that we're now his delegates. Yeah. And we're we're set forth for a witness to Christ. That's right. Amen. Now, you'll see here in the meaning of an an ambassador, who is an ambassador? An ambassador is an accredited diplomat. It's an accredited Christian. Yeah. A person that's sent from heaven, sent from a country to be its official representation. Sure. Yeah. Here on earth. That's right. Now, I believe for the bride of Christ, that should be the goal and that should be the purpose for every one of us here. We know that we were in the mind of God and we came from God in Genesis 1:26 and 27. And so, we're citizens of another country, but we're sent as ambassadors to wherever God's placed you. Amen. That's right. To not be your own thoughts. No, brother said you don't have a thought coming, but are you going to be trustworthy to carry God's thoughts? You know, a pastor is the highest ranking official representing a country. Yes. That you've left and you're stationed at another place. They are officially essentially sorry the boss of the ambassador to the country to be the head of state in another country and they represent their home country the entrance the interests of God. They negotiate agreements and foster relationships in the host country. You know, God has no hands but your hands. Amen. God has no body but your body. Amen. He has no mouth but your mouth. God's not here in a separate body. God's here in your body. You are his ambassador. That's right. You are the official voice for the host country. Glory on behalf of God. You're a crucial role in maintain God maintaining relationships with mankind. Yeah. God came down and became a man. Yes. And he placed his spirit in man. That's right. So he could have a relationship with mankind. Amen. I want to look at here are seven marks or seven examples or seven parts to being an ambassador. And we'll look at some things that that you know after this the Bible and the prophet said about ambassadors. But first off to be an ambassador you must be a citizen. Yes. Of the country you're representing. That's right. You must have come from God to represent God. Amen. There will be no elegance. There will be no foreigners representing the home country. And we see that in 2 Corinthians 5:17, it said, "Now that if any man be in Christ, you're a brand new creature." That's right. Hallelujah. Amen. Even first Peter 1:18 and 19, it says we're redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, which makes us a member membership, a citizen of heaven. These are qualifications and marks that would show if you qualified to be an ambassador for God. Yeah. You must be the person that would be set out for an ambassador must be above reproach. That's right. It must not have a dou doubtful character. And Christ requires his ambassadors to live above suspicion. Yes. Christ's not going to send somebody out that's got dual personalities. He's got dual message. It's confusing. Yes. He's going to have a very clear message that sent out. God, help us to not have any smut on our testimony. Help us our lives would line up. We see here in 2 Corinthians, the same scripture, if you read the last part of that, it said, "Old things are passed away. And behold, all things become have become new." Even Philippians 2 and 15 it says that ye may be blameless and harness harmless the sons of God without rebuke. These would be all qualifications for an ambassador of Christ. But here we see that Paul said that God's made us his ambassadors. Amen. But do we qualify? This would be some of the qualifications. Three, for a qualification, he said to be an ambassador, you must be selfless. You must be willing to put aside completely your own interests. To do the will of Christ. God help us. Here Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:31, he said, "I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord that I die daily." That's right. Paul had to die daily. He had to die to his thoughts and his agenda and his will to let Christ live in him. John 12:24 says, "Verily the same thing." He said, "Verily, verily I say unto you, here Jesus is talking." He said, "Let the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it'll buy alone. But if it dies, it bringeth forth much fruit." This was a qualification that we must have to be an ambassador for Christ. Here in Galatians 2:20, it says, "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, but yet not I. It's not me that liveth, but it's Christ that liveth in me." That's right. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God, who loveth me and gaveth himself for me. All qualifications to be an ambassador. See, you know, if you you know, if you think of this naturally, you know, the best example, and forgive me for for but you know, every government has their own uh theme that they get voted in for. And you know, the best way to to look at that would be in the states, you know, they just got a new president. And so when he would send somebody out, you're speaking for the president. Yeah. And you're going to have a short life in that job if you start speaking your own thoughts. That's right. That government's going to give you the right. But we know that every government on land will crumble. That they're only for a phrase of time. But our heavenly kingdom is eternal. That's right. Yeah. And it'll last for eternity. That's right. Amen. God won't send out ambassadors that aren't preaching, aren't witnessing, aren't living his life. Amen. Another qualification for being ambassador, you must be in constant connection with the King of Kings. You're not going to be too busy building your own kingdom and raising your bank account that they're going to turn to digital currency. No, but you're going to be in a constant frame of prayer. That just just I don't mean on your knees all the time, but I mean when you wake up in the morning, you're praying. When you're driving your car down the road, you're praying. When you're at work, you're praying. You're in constant connection with the boss, Jesus Christ. Because see, if you're not in constant connection, you don't know what he wants. Amen. You don't you're not up to date with the format for the day. You know, us in the flesh, we we worry so much about our fleshly body that's going to ride away. But most of us eat regularly at least once a day. Yeah. But what about being connected to the throne? Amen. If we ate as much spiritual food as we ate physical food. Yeah. That's right. Amen. That's right. Number five, to be a qualified as an ambassador for Christ, you must be steadfast and loyal. That means in hard times, you have a backbone. You see this in Acts 16 where Paul healed the woman that had the devil and the the men there in the city were making money on her, laughing at her and making jokes of her and she was following Paul and Silas and and it was disturbing Paul and he healed her and cast out the evil spirit. That sounds like a nice thing to do. Yeah. But they took them and they whipped them and beat them and put them in jail and put them in stocks. Yeah. Because they did what the master Yeah. said to do. Sometimes in your life if you're following the word of God, you're going to get whipped and you're going to get beaten out the country and you're going to be putting stocks in that country and you're going to be in the other country's jail. Amen. Because you're following the orders. That's right. From the host country. Glory. That's right. Amen. Here in Ephesians 6:20, it says, "For I ambassadors in bonds." Paul talking. I'm ambassadors of bonds. It's a union connection whereby I may speak boldly as I ought to speak. Paul Paul, if anybody in the scripture Yeah. didn't back down from the gospel. No. Even Peter, he he confronted him to the face of people that would He said, "If anybody come to preach a different gospel than this gospel, let him be a curse." Sure. Paul was a man's man. Yeah. Just let that sink in for a second. It was no mistake that Jesus chose him as the ambassador. Yeah. To bring the dispensation of grace. Yeah. There's not another man in the Bible that could have changed the dispensation from law to grace and to works to love but Paul. Yeah, that's right. Because he was a man. He was a man of God. When he got the orders from glory, nothing stepped in his way. Travel never stepped in his way. Poisonous snakes never stepped in his way. Prisons never stepped in his way. Locks and gates open. He shook off serpents as his hand. Said, "I ain't got an appointment." Yeah. For the diplomat, the host country. Hallelujah. Number six, you must be able to diplomat. You must have diplomacy. The art of negotiation. Now that that sounds that sounds like that's an ability of yourself. No, cuz we have no wisdom of our own. But in James 15, it says, "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth all men liberty, how to handle every situation in your life." That's right. in your community, in the country that you're the ambassador for. See, God will give you the wisdom to deal with the negotiation. And lastly, as we come to the end of our our requirements as an ambassador is you must know the language of the people where whom you live. You must know the language of the country that God sends you to. And I don't mean just the language, but you must understand the the uh the what's the word I'm looking for? Understand the the traditions. [Music] The country that God will send you to. You know, every country has unique traditions and what we would call evil maybe is standard equipment in another country because it was just laws of men. Men make a lot of laws in churches, but they're just man's laws. I'm thrilled to live under the age that Paul brought of grace and love. Amen. You must understand the language of the country. Let me give you an example of this in Luke 10 30-35. This may surprise you here. Jesus said, he said, "A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among thieves and they stripped his raignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest." Now, that guy would have for sure took care of him. Well, he he's a priest. They came by the way and when he saw him, he passed on the other side. See, he would fail the ambassador qualifications. Yes. This is Jesus giving this example. Yeah. Jesus is showing us what our age is and qualification for being an ambassador. And likewise a Levite. Whoa. Oh. Oh, that's another minister. Uhoh. When he saw that place, he came and looked on him and passed by also on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, he came. And when he saw him, he had compassion upon him. That's right. and he went to him and bound up his wounds and poured oil and wine and set him on his breast and bought for him in the end to take care of him. See, you must understand the language of the country that's sending you out. Yeah. And what Christ intends for you to do as his missionary, as his ambassador. Yeah. How are we supposed to live our daily lives? Well, we'll know if we're connected to the throne. That's right. On a regular basis. But this is just a small part of the qualifications where Paul said in Corinthians that Christ has made us ambassadors. Yeah. He He Christ can't survive without ambassadors. He's got them all around the world. Yeah. ambassadors. 2 Corinthians 6:1 it says, "We then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not grace of God in vain." What are you doing with what God gave you? God gave you a lot. He gave you his everything. Amen. See, when Christ sends out us as ambassadors, we'll go with the full resources and the full power of heaven behind us. For he's all sufficient and we'll go in Christ in Christ Jesus name. Here our prophet said this is a just a fantastic example of brother Bram mentioning how we will live as ambassadors. Harmony is now exists between the groom and his bride and he shows her his word of life. That's because she's connected to him. That's right. And she receives it. Now here's the secret. He gives his word to the bride as it was in Mary. And the bride has, you see, if you're connected, now that's the key. You got to be connected. You have to be a citizen. Yeah. And you have to be connected. You'll have the mind of Christ. And she'll know what he wants done with the word. And she performs the commandments of the word in his name. And she has thus saith the Lord. That's an ambassador. Yeah. for Christ. That's somebody that's not living with his own agenda. You know, you're not even living in the country you're born of. You're not even living the country you're a citizen of. Cuz you're a heavenly citizen. That's right. Amen. You have heavenly laws. That's right. Your heavenly laws overrule your earthly country you're living in. That's right. Amen. If you don't think they do, you need to reread the Bible. Because all the apostles and disciples in the Bible, their heavenly loss overruled all the governments of this earth. That's right. That's right. Every one of them. And those that are in the bride, those that are his ambassador will only do his will. And no one can make them do otherwise. Them are the only people Christ will send out for an ambassador. He ain't sending you to another country and not sure the decision you'll make on his behalf. He'll never send you. He'll know that before he sends you. And they'll have thus sayith the Lord or they'll keep still. And he did not and Christ did not complete all his work while he was on the earthly ministry. See, it wasn't the time yet. Come on now. But he does those works through you today. That's why you're the ambassador for Christ today. He does them through you. And for is not yet the time when he would have done them. And he'll fulfill all that's left to do until the end of time. That's right. Through a group of people that'll be ambassadors that'll be part connected to them. that'll be a citizen of heaven, that'll left their their own will for his will and obey directly his thoughts. Oh, God, help us to be one of those people. You know, it's good to be a citizen, but just just think of this, you know, on this earthly kingdom, if you get a job as an ambassador, you're highly esteemed. That's right. That's right. But that's what the bride of Christ is in the Bible. You're highly esteemed. You're already glorified. Those that he called, he already he filled and glorified. And and you're you're recognition in the world to standing that your voice represents somebody bigger than you. That's right. God help us. God, help us not to stop less than what he has planned for us. Philippians 2:5 and 11, he said, "Let this mind be in you which is in Christ Jesus." That's what'll qualify as being ambassadors who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God. When your son is an ambassador for Christ and you qualify and he trusts you to be a testimony for his kingdom, he's making you equal. Your your voice is his voice. That's right. Your commandment is his commandment. What did he say to Moses in the Bible? He said, "Why cry to me? Speak. Speak and go forward. Speak this. Step aside. Angel, step aside." The bride of Christ, it's coming through. Hallelujah. But he made himself of no reputation and took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. Being found in the fashion as men, he humbled himself and became obedient. That's another requirement of an ambassador. Obedient. Obedient. That's right. Even if they whip you like Paul, put you in jail and stocks. Yeah. Obedient unto death. even to death of the cross. Therefore, God has highly exalted him and given him a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow and things that are in heaven and things that are in the earth, things that are under the earth. And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God. God help us. Amen. to be one of these ambassadors in another country. Hallelujah. God needs it more than ever now. Yeah. As the world falls apart, there's one part that's not falling apart. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word, thus sayeth the Lord, will never pass away. Amen. He's preparing a kingdom. We'll reign with him in the millennium for a thousand years. Yes. Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect and your weakness, and most gladly, therefore, I will rather glory in my infirmities." See, you won't always be accepted in a foreign country. Come on. Amen. You're not a citizen of that country. You're an ambassador to that country. So, you have a different set of laws than that country that you're living in has. Amen. God help us. That the power of Christ may rest upon me. Amen. When God trusts you with his word, when God trusts you with thus sayaith the Lord, when God sends you out to a strange country and says, "You know my will, perform it." God help us. Hebrews 5 8 and N. Therefore, Jesus were a son and yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered. Now, friends, we're living in a a time, a very unique time. The Bible says the Leoian age, the last age in Revelations. Yeah. And it's not a time of learning obedience by the things that you suffer. It's in an age where if you if it's something you want to do, everything goes. And there's no obedience to no inner voice. There's no obedience to the word of God. But see, even God himself, Jesus himself in the flesh body learned obedience. That's right. by the things that he suffered and being made perfect became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that would obey him. It was because of God, Christ obedience, you have to make a decision. Will I be an ambassador for God no matter what? It's a decision you'll make every day. That's right. Paul made it every day. He said, "I die daily." But Paul was into shipwrecks and prison and and you know, and all these things, wrongfully accused, whipped and beat. Yeah. Because he wasn't afraid to be an ambassador for Christ. And many things if we're going to suffer, most of us in our flesh body will take a second look at say because we're living in the age that'll go the least resistance. This will hurt me the least if I go here. Yeah. God's not looking for those kind of people. No, not at all. He never was. He was looking for sons and daughters that would obey regardless. Yes. Here our prophet says why does he stand? The reason in Revelations 81 17 and 18, he said, "If the children are hes and hes of God and joint hes with Christ, see, if we're a part of the heavenly kingdom, if we're citizens of heaven, then he can trust us to be ambassadors. And if so, then we'll suffer." Uh-oh. Yeah. You're going to suffer. Come on. You're going to suffer because you'll take the name of Christ. That's right. that ye may be also glorified with him. If you don't suffer for Christ, you'll never be glorified ever. You won't have to worry about the good parts. That's right. Come on. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared to the glory that will be revealed in us. In us. God help us. Unless we suffer with him, we cannot be an ambassador for him. for we will suffer to reign. The reason is this that character is simply never made without suffering. Christ will always make sure that you have the character to handle the authority. Character is a victory, not a gift. Man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic. But power with character is fit to rule. And since he wants us to share even in his throne on the same basis that he overcame he sat down on his father's throne. Then we'll overcome and sit down with him on his throne. God, help us to be one of these people that God could send us out as ambassadors, trustworthy. Yes, sir. Be willing to suffer for Christ. It won't necessarily always be easy. We're not living in a Christian nation. No. Not even close. God has sent you to a heathen nation. That's right. To have the testimony of a heavenly kingdom. Amen. That'll never pass away. That's right. God help us. Who can he trust? You know, before he can send you out as an ambassador, God will give you the pressure test. That's right. Because everything God valued, he put under pressure. That's right. Diamonds, gold, silver, he buried deep. He put them under pressure. Yes. To see what they were made of. Yeah. Some just comes up as coal. But some comes up as diamonds. You got to be willing to take the pressure and suffer with Christ. And he's got to know that he'll never send you out as an ambassador if you got a wishy-washy character. He'll never send you out if you got a doubtful. If he's not sure how you'll stand That's right. under pressure. Amen. How will you stand if you're Paul that sent to prison unlawfully? See, Paul was a Roman. Yeah. Romans couldn't beat Romans without a without a trial. They couldn't whip him, put him in jail without a trial. Yeah. That's why when they let Paul loose, the authorities feared for their life because they didn't know Paul was one of them. Amen. Come on. Uh-huh. Amen. They fear for their life. That's why the Bible says, "Touch not my anointed." Yeah. You don't go around whipping God's ambassadors. Or you're not going to make out too well. Vicki, on my messenger, I have a picture of a little boy. It's It might be back three or four. It's a straight picture. I'd like you to put that up. It might not be as nice as your calf picture there, but on my Facebook Messenger, it might be back a half a dozen. I'm going to close with this story. And this story don't sound very inviting or encouraging until the very end. But God will send us through trials like this story to see what you're made of. This little boy was 6 years old when his parents took him to an orphanage. Amen. And the day that they took him is erected in his soul for all of eternity. See, sometimes when God sends you out as an ambassador to another country, you think God is whipping you. You think God's sending you to a terrible country as punishment. But like Job, he's sending you because he has full 100% confidence in your life. And he couldn't send nobody else but you. And you think he's putting you under pressure to be mean, but he's actually putting you under pressure cuz he knows you can take the heat. That's right. Don't misunderstand God. And it was erected in his soul. And he, you know, this little boy tells the story. He said, "My mom gave me the last tight height hug." And she said, "I'll soon be back for you, Jesus." And he said, "I stood there in front of the orphanage with a teddy bear and a backpack with two changes of clothes." You know, the Bible says that when you go out to foreign countries, don't even consider what you will speak because I will anoint you with the power of God and it'll come forth as oracles out of your mouth. When brother Bam said he would travel and speak to kings and authorities that they made ministers made fun of him and thought he had had a bad dream, mocked him. And he said, "Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into years and I never saw my mother again." And he said, "I noticed that all the other people in the orphanage got adopted out to new families and left with big smiles on their faces." You couldn't find my picture on Facebook Messenger. Oh, yeah. It's up there. Sorry. They all got adopted out, left with big pictures. But you know, the Bible says that you will be an oddball. Yes. and you'll be a peculiar people and nobody will adopt you. He said, "I stared at the ceiling thinking my parents were some kind of secret agents and would sometime return for me, but they never did." just just to see. He said, "I found that at the age of 13, I found myself spending time in the kitchen using leftover sugar and leftover cocoa making chocolate bars." And I would wrap up the paper and the people in the orphanage called me the candy kid. And I would sit at traffic lights and sell my chocolate bars that I made in the orphanage. He said, "The one time I was selling at the traffic light, a man wanted to know who had made it." And I said, "Oh, it was just me." He said, "I'll take 500 of them tomorrow for a business thing that I'm doing." And he said it was the first time I set up my business into a dismatic official registration of my business into and he said I reinvested all that money from the 500 chocolate bars into equipment to make candy bars. And he said when I become older I returned to the exact same neighborhood I was born heaven. And he said, "But this time when I returned, I returned with tears of joy. I had the sadness of how I had left." But he said, "I returned with the keys to a new home." He said, "I went and found my parents that were living in their own struggles and I handed them the keys to the home." And he said something that most of us haven't been able to do. He said, "Parents, I want to thank you." Yeah. For leaving me at the orphanage because that orphanage made me the man that I am today. Here's the keys to your home. You blessed me tremendously because you sent me through hardship. And we think because we get a little bump in the road in our spiritual walk that God's turned everything against us. Come on. And he's building you to the son and daughter that he can send out as ambassadors. That's right. with full trust with thus sayith the Lord with the keys of death and hell to Peter. Did he seem like the key person that you'd give the keys to death and hell to kingdom of heaven? the keys to the kingdom. It said it's all yours because of suffering. You become worthy to reign. God help us to understand God. Yeah, God will send things and and it's because he tremendously loves you and he's just making sure that you'll follow when other people truly do come against you and whip you on justly. Will you stand with the truth in a foreign country? Thank you, Lord. as my testimony as thus saith the Lord. I pray at some time God would trust us. I I pray he would. I would pray that we would come to a place. I believe we will. You know, you know, I want to say this. Brother Bam said this. You know, men aren't born men. When you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're a baby. You're a baby. And you grow into adoption. You grow into the ability to be sent out as a trustworthy, completely committed ambassador. Here's my keys. Here's my checkbook. And here's exactly what I expect. And no problem. Your word is as good as God's. Yes. Oh, wow. Wow. I pray to God I'll come to that someday. I I I I humbly pray that God could trust me. Yes, Lord. To win souls for him, point people to Christ Jesus. And just what what would you know a good example in closing said what would Jesus do in this exact situation? Let's stand. Help me Jesus. Let's sing. Lord, my heart can grow so far away and go away. Lord, my high can grow so far away and anchor. And yet for me, your love, it's still the same. [Music] [Applause] My head bow down and pray. Grant your name. I lift your name. your holy name.
