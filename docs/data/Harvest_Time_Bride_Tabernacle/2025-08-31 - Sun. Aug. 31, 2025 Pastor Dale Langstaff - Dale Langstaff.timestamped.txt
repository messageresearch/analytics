[25:27] you. We love you. We don't deserve you
[25:30] as friends, but but we're family. So,
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good. We we did enjoy
[25:38] oursel in Burlington and and uh
[25:42] one of the brothers preached a message
[25:44] Saturday morning. They were they were
[25:46] all fantastic and just a wonderful
[25:49] fellowship. And you know, when somebody
[25:52] shows themselves friendly, Brother Bram
[25:53] said, "If you want friends, you have to
[25:55] show yourself friendly." Yeah,
[25:56] &gt;&gt; man. You want friends? Go be friendly
[25:58] with somebody.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to fish in the
[26:03] brother's pond that preached there.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Uh, wow.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; It was powerful. He read the scripture
[26:12] in Genesis
[26:14] about Eve being begiled by the serpent.
[26:18] And Jesus came to them and they knew
[26:21] they were naked.
[26:24] And they told God, they said, "We feared
[26:26] you."
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who told you that?"
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:35] I just Who told you you don't have no
[26:38] money?
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Who told you you're sick?
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Who told you you don't have your family
[26:43] saved?
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[26:45] &gt;&gt; God.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Who told me you had problems?
[26:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:53] I I just about lost my mind when the
[26:55] brother was preaching.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Who told me the world was falling apart?
[27:00] Who told you that?
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Wow. Was really good.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Hebrews 12.
[27:21] Hebrews 12 verse 5 verse 5 and 6
[27:26] maybe verse 7.
[27:30] Amen. We we do welcome you and we just
[27:33] are honored by your presence. Amen. It's
[27:35] it's God's presence that we come to be
[27:38] in amidst. Amen.
[27:40] And ye have begotten the
[27:45] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[27:48] unto children. My son, despise not thou
[27:52] the chastisement of the Lord, nor faint
[27:55] thou
[27:57] at the rebuke of him. For whom the Lord
[28:01] lovest, he chastiseth, and scores every
[28:03] son whom he receiveth. And if ye endure
[28:07] chastisement,
[28:09] God dealeth with you as a son.
[28:13] For what son is he whom the father
[28:17] chastises
[28:19] not? Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll
[28:22] you'll reveal yourself to us more
[28:24] clearly and and show us your purpose and
[28:27] and your understanding and and all these
[28:29] things, Lord God. And Lord, I discount
[28:33] it a great privilege to stand before
[28:36] your bride. You're the ones that you
[28:38] purchased with your blood. you
[28:41] purchased, you've seen them in your mind
[28:42] before the foundation of the world, Lord
[28:44] God. And Lord, we're a servant to you,
[28:48] Lord God. And bless your bride. Bless
[28:50] us, Lord God, as you minister to us all
[28:53] this morning. In your name we pray.
[28:57] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[28:59] You know, we're living in a world where
[29:01] it's it's not falling apart. It has
[29:04] already fell apart. And many of us are
[29:07] in trials. and and and you know, you
[29:10] don't have to tell me about your trials.
[29:11] I know that cuz I'm in my own trials and
[29:13] and you you just can recognize it by the
[29:16] news and the the places that it's it's
[29:19] prophecy. It's in the Bible.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Things are coming to an end in this
[29:23] world that as we've known it and and
[29:25] we're going to go in a rapture and a new
[29:27] place, but before we go, we're still
[29:29] here and God's elect are still here and
[29:32] and so we're under we're under this we
[29:35] feel this atmosphere around us. Amen.
[29:37] And we talked things are changing. Me my
[29:39] wife talked about it. It's changing the
[29:41] pressure even in the churches. It's
[29:44] changed and and the people and their
[29:46] thoughts and their minds is changing.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you something that
[29:52] your testing time is coming to an end.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; And your angel is on the way.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Your angel is on the way. You know, God
[30:07] don't God is not an abusive father and
[30:10] and God is only showing to the world and
[30:13] to yourself
[30:16] who you belong to.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; When God chastises us and and sends us
[30:20] in trials, when he gives us hard times,
[30:22] it's to prove that we won't run.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; We won't run from him when when there's
[30:28] no money in the bank. We won't we won't
[30:30] stop coming and serving God with our
[30:32] whole heart.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one brother preached on
[30:35] who has your heart is who you serve.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; If you're worshiping your car this
[30:40] morning, I I feel really sorry for you
[30:43] if you get in an accident on the way
[30:44] home. But whoever has your heart
[30:47] &gt;&gt; is your God.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; If you love your school books more than
[30:51] God, it's you that got your heart. But
[30:54] whoever has your heart controls your
[30:56] being.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when God has your heart and
[31:02] God has the heart of the elected because
[31:05] they come into this atmosphere that's
[31:08] prophesied and and many people we're
[31:10] going to look at through the Bible that
[31:11] come into this atmosphere, they never
[31:13] run from God.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Because they recognize that they were
[31:20] already sold out to God and he had their
[31:23] heart. And I I want to lay just a bit of
[31:25] a foundation and show you how many times
[31:27] in the Bible God talks about trying us.
[31:30] It's not because he don't love you. It
[31:33] you should lose your mind when you go
[31:35] through a hard time.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Because it proves that you're God's.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; He's proven to Satan they won't run from
[31:44] me.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; He's proven to the devil
[31:46] &gt;&gt; no matter what I throw at him. What did
[31:48] he do with Job? He said, "I dare you to
[31:52] try him.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; I dare you. You can throw everything at
[31:56] him, but don't take his life."
[32:01] &gt;&gt; And Job's good friends and his wife and
[32:03] all them said, "Why don't you just
[32:05] cursed God and die?"
[32:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're talking like a foolish
[32:11] person.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; I'm already purchased by that God. Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; I could no more curse the God the the
[32:19] God of my heart than I could curse
[32:21] myself.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, ain't he amazing.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; But I just, you know, and and the and
[32:29] the and the pressure and the things that
[32:31] different ones are going through.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; We're You're all going through
[32:35] something.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be a prophet to see your
[32:40] future to know that you have trials.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:47] Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; But your angel
[32:51] &gt;&gt; is on the way.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; And you know, so many times we
[32:55] misinterpret
[32:57] who God is. And and we're going to get
[32:59] into that just a little bit.
[33:02] Brother Brown said that angels are
[33:04] ministering spirits to the church.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You think, "Well, I'm going to see
[33:12] a great minister come out and I'll
[33:14] recognize that's God."
[33:16] &gt;&gt; No, it's ministering spirits.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; You know, when Paul I'm just way ahead
[33:23] of myself. When Paul was on the road to
[33:25] Damascus, a light came over him.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord,
[33:32] &gt;&gt; who are you?
[33:34] Who did he see? Did he see the flesh of
[33:36] Jesus?"
[33:39] No.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Did he see a good preacher?
[33:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Did he see the disciples or the
[33:45] apostles? That must have been who we
[33:47] see.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; No. How in the world?
[33:52] Paul was a Jew. H how did he recognize
[33:56] the Lord?
[33:58] &gt;&gt; There was no person.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Don't get caught up in the Godhead as a
[34:03] person.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I am Jesus."
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Who you persecute? And Jesus wasn't on
[34:12] the earth. Paul wasn't persecuting
[34:14] Jesus.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; But he had the right of the army, the
[34:22] government to go after the church.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; He was killing Jesus
[34:29] &gt;&gt; in the church. He could come in your
[34:31] home, take your life. Jesus.
[34:36] How did he recognize Jesus?
[34:40] &gt;&gt; My Lord,
[34:42] who art thou?
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham. When God decided to go down and
[34:47] give Abraham the promise,
[34:52] &gt;&gt; it wasn't Jesus.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't come yet.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:05] The prophet said that God just made
[35:06] three bodies. Just said, "Whoop!"
[35:09] grabbed a couple angels. "Come on,
[35:10] angels." Whoop! Jump in that body. God
[35:13] jumped in the other body
[35:15] and he went down. And Abraham said, "My
[35:17] Lord."
[35:20] How do you recognize him? Wasn't the
[35:22] body. It wasn't the body. It didn't look
[35:25] like Jesus. The Bible said there is no
[35:27] beauty that he could would, you know,
[35:29] you would look upon him. It wasn't
[35:30] Jesus. He just he just cloop.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "My Lord."
[35:37] &gt;&gt; And when he went to Lot, he said, "My
[35:40] lords."
[35:42] &gt;&gt; How did they say that?
[35:43] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the wasn't the clay.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit, the ministering
[35:52] spirit that Abraham recognized the
[35:56] presence of Jehovah.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. There was some
[36:01] supernatural
[36:03] nature
[36:05] &gt;&gt; that came into the place
[36:08] &gt;&gt; and he said, "My Lord
[36:14] &gt;&gt; and he ate some honey and he ate a calf
[36:17] or a lamb and poof,
[36:22] he was gone."
[36:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:25] Yeah,
[36:27] &gt;&gt; my Lord
[36:29] &gt;&gt; ministering spirits here. I'm I'm sorry.
[36:32] I'm way ahead. James 1:24, he said,
[36:34] "Brethren, count it all joy when you
[36:36] fall into diverse temptations, knowing
[36:38] that this, that the trying of your faith
[36:41] workketh patience, but let patience have
[36:44] their perfect work, that ye may be
[36:46] perfect
[36:48] and tired
[36:51] and wanting nothing."
[36:53] God don't plan on you living in a realm
[36:56] of temptations.
[36:59] You don't have any problems at all.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "But you, but you, who told you
[37:05] that?"
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Who told you you weren't a child of God?
[37:10] Who told the prostitute at the well she
[37:12] wasn't a child of God? Who told Rahab
[37:14] she couldn't save her whole family when
[37:16] she was in the business?
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Who told you that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; You know, there's just two spirits.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; It's Jehovah
[37:32] &gt;&gt; and it's one that's fighting against
[37:34] Jehovah.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Who's the accuser of the brethren?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Count it all joy. See, when we
[37:44] recognize this pressure in the
[37:46] environment around us, we recognize that
[37:49] I am a child of God. I ain't no longer a
[37:54] slave to nobody
[37:56] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm already bought with the price.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't know my story, but
[38:04] you're a child of God.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Oh, Brook Church, we
[38:12] need a revelation
[38:14] &gt;&gt; that you're a child of God.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And when we're together, we'll be just
[38:18] saying, "I'm a child of God." Well, like
[38:19] my house fell down around. Well, I'm a
[38:20] child of God. Like, you know,
[38:24] &gt;&gt; I drove in the ditch and I was upside
[38:26] down, but I'm a child of God. Like,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; do you know the Bible says that Satan
[38:30] can't touch you
[38:31] &gt;&gt; unless God permits it?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know Satan couldn't touch Job
[38:36] until God said? God said, "You know
[38:38] what?" He said, "You can go this far."
[38:41] And Satan came back to God and he said,
[38:42] "Well, I couldn't get him to fall
[38:44] because you only let me go this far, but
[38:46] if you let me go farther, I'll do." And
[38:48] God said, "Okay, you can go this far."
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, at first he said, "You can take
[38:54] all God, Job's wealth and all this other
[38:57] stuff, but you can't touch his life or
[38:58] his family or his house." And Satan
[39:01] said, "See, God, this is an unfair
[39:03] competition. You're protecting him. You
[39:06] got a hedge built around him." I want to
[39:10] just give Satan a notice. It's always an
[39:12] unfair competition because I read the
[39:15] end of the book and I am a child of God.
[39:18] I know who is the winner at the end. I
[39:21] know who's the winner at the beginning.
[39:22] And I know who's the winner at the
[39:23] beginning, at the end. And I know who's
[39:25] winning all the way through.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; But your temptation and your trial is
[39:30] just to prove to Satan that I am a child
[39:34] of God. He's my Lord and my King.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; It don't matter if I go home and hit a
[39:40] smack, hit a back track.
[39:44] Brother Cadre Digs was saying, he said,
[39:46] "When I get a funeral, you know, if I
[39:48] ever have to take a trip before any of
[39:50] you and before the rapture,
[39:53] man, don't nobody wear black.
[39:56] Wear purple and pink and and red and
[40:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to dance
[40:06] &gt;&gt; because I'll be dancing in heaven. I'll
[40:08] be dancing on my head.
[40:20] I'm no longer a slave. There's somebody
[40:22] that took the sting of death
[40:24] &gt;&gt; and the grave away.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; It was my Lord. He He took the keys from
[40:31] Satan. He said, "Hello, hand them over,
[40:34] brother." Not brother. Hand them over,
[40:37] dude.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer
[40:41] a slave to this life. Psalm 66:10 and
[40:46] 12. For thou, oh Lord, has proven us.
[40:49] There you go.
[40:51] And thou has tried us as silver is
[40:54] tried. Psalm 66:10 and 12. Thou has
[40:58] brought us into the net.
[41:02] Thou has laid afflictions
[41:04] upon our loins. Thou has caused men to
[41:08] ride over top of my head.
[41:12] Sounds pretty bad.
[41:15] And I even went through the fire
[41:18] and through the and went through the
[41:21] water. But thou
[41:24] but read all of it. But thou has brought
[41:28] us out with a healthy price.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm no longer
[41:34] a slave to what's to throw at me. It
[41:39] makes no difference. We It's about high
[41:41] time we give Satan a headache.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And recognize that I'm a child.
[41:48] You can just pour it on, Satan. Take
[41:51] everything I have and make me sick.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 1 6 and 7.
[42:00] There where wherein ye greatly rejoice,
[42:03] though now for a season, if need be, for
[42:07] ye are in heaven in are in heaviness,
[42:10] though the manifold temptations
[42:13] through manifold temptations, that the
[42:16] trials of your faith bringeth much
[42:21] precious than gold,
[42:25] though it be tried with fire,
[42:28] it might be found unto to praise and
[42:30] honor and glory at the appearing of
[42:33] Jesus Christ. You're waiting for the
[42:35] rapture. I'm going to just give you a
[42:37] news flash. You don't have to wait for
[42:39] the rapture. You don't even have to wait
[42:41] for the millennium
[42:42] &gt;&gt; for the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; He appears to me daily.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's around me all the time. I
[42:50] never leave him behind me.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; I lay down with him. I rise up with him.
[42:54] I drive my truck with him or wherever
[42:56] I'm going because I am a child of God.
[42:59] The very spirit that he is is living
[43:02] inside of me.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; The appearing of Jesus Christ is
[43:13] you mean I've come to this church so
[43:15] long
[43:17] and you didn't recognize
[43:20] the father.
[43:22] You know the des the brother came to
[43:24] Jesus and said we would see the father
[43:25] and it would make us happy.
[43:28] Jesus like
[43:31] I've been with you all this time.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; And and your eyes were closed every time
[43:36] I was around you.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; You didn't pick up that I am he.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Did you ever pick up that you are he?
[43:45] &gt;&gt; You are. If you have the baptism of the
[43:46] Holy Ghost and you were elected before
[43:48] the foundation of the world, ye are he.
[43:50] Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; The very spirit that he is,
[43:56] &gt;&gt; the very same mineral that's in the
[43:58] teaspoon of the ocean is the whole
[44:00] ocean.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; I am a child of God.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[44:10] wow.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Here in Job, he said, "He has tried me
[44:16] and I shall come forth as gold."
[44:19] I want to show you a quote here. This is
[44:21] amazing. This This should make you just
[44:24] lose your mind. It's all right. I just
[44:25] give you another news flash. God ain't
[44:27] afraid of praise.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; You know, Cadre Dakes, he had to I'm
[44:32] thinking I'm going to get one. He had to
[44:34] print up a sign. Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; I haven't got a wrote on there yet, but
[44:38] that means amen.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you need coaxing.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; You know, we're in school. This is a
[44:44] news flash. Here's the cards. We're
[44:46] learning our ABC. Say amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You want the stones to cry out?
[44:59] &gt;&gt; They're never going to have to cry out
[45:00] as long as I'm alive.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Watch what the prophet says here. And he
[45:07] that is in you.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[45:14] &gt;&gt; He that's in you. Yeah,
[45:17] &gt;&gt; you were looking for a great somebody.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; You should get a mirror.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; You're great.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Are you great?
[45:34] &gt;&gt; It's no longer me that live, but Christ
[45:36] that liveth in me. Are you great?
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; It's a Christ. It's not me. I'm not
[45:43] alive no more. It's Christ that's living
[45:44] in me. I died years ago.
[45:47] Amen. Watch what the prophet says.
[45:50] Greater is he that's in you than that
[45:52] wheelchair you're sitting in. Greater is
[45:54] he that's in you than that stretcher
[45:56] you're laying on. Greater is he that's
[45:58] in you than the cancer that the doctors
[46:00] give a name. Greater is he that's in you
[46:03] than any of your afflictions. This is a
[46:06] quote, by the way. Greater is he that's
[46:09] in you than anything the devil could
[46:12] ever put on you.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[46:17] greater is he that's in you than he
[46:19] that's in the world. Greater is he
[46:23] &gt;&gt; you. Yes.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; See, he is in us. And that's Christ.
[46:29] He's He was our conquered every enemy
[46:34] for us. And then he was here on the
[46:36] earth and he conquered sin. He conquered
[46:38] sickness. He conquered death.
[46:43] conquer sickness, hell, death, and the
[46:45] grave
[46:47] &gt;&gt; and come to us and set us free of all
[46:50] these things. But there's some of you
[46:54] that are getting a news flash. You
[46:56] didn't know before today you were free.
[46:59] I'm no longer
[47:02] &gt;&gt; a slave to fear.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz greater is he that's in me than he
[47:08] that's in the world. Yeah.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; He took all these. He conquered
[47:18] sickness, hell, death, and the grave and
[47:20] come to us to set us free of all these
[47:22] things. And greater is he that's in you
[47:24] than Satan that could buffet you o put
[47:28] buffets over you. Yes, he's greater.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[47:40] The Christ that's in you is greater to
[47:42] than you think.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; You're looking at your own ability.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; God ain't even looking at your own
[47:50] ability.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding? God is not even looking
[47:56] at your own ability. Do you know the
[47:58] amount of people in the scripture that
[47:59] fell down daily and God just never even
[48:03] recognized their failure? Yeah.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; But he looked at the spirit that was the
[48:09] election and the spirit that was
[48:12] tabernacled inside that that that
[48:14] mistake of clay.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; You're looking at my failure and my
[48:19] mistakes. Are you kidding?
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Have I been this long with you that you
[48:24] didn't recognize the father?
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, you were looking at this body. Well,
[48:34] I just put it on once in a while, you
[48:36] know, when I need to walk around. Like I
[48:39] I put it on when I go to the bank so
[48:41] they don't get scared of ghosts.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; You think I'm kidding? You know, when
[48:46] Peter was in prison, who came to him?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You thought it was a person, but I'm
[48:55] sorry,
[48:56] you're mistaken.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; It was not.
[49:00] It said a pillar of fire, a light,
[49:03] bright light, shined in the jail.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; It was the same pillar of fire that
[49:09] stopped Paul on the road to the Saul on
[49:11] the road to Damascus. And he said, "My
[49:14] Lord."
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; And you know, I want to just jump ahead
[49:20] because I'm back to this spirit going
[49:21] through the bank of the spirit. And when
[49:23] Peter got out of jail and he knocked on
[49:25] the door, the people were praying.
[49:27] They'd went to church and they were
[49:28] praying at Mark's house and he knocked
[49:31] on the door and the lady went and seen
[49:33] Peter
[49:36] and she went back and reported to the
[49:37] believers. Now Peter's at the door
[49:39] knocking and they said, "It's a ghost.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; They were message believers.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; It's a ghost.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; He's knocking to you this morning.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; You can you say my Lord or do you just
[49:55] see a ghost?
[49:57] Yeah.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the angel of the
[50:02] Lord came into Peter and what did the
[50:04] angel look like?
[50:07] Maybe I better give you a scripture for
[50:09] that. I skipped two or three examples,
[50:12] but we'll just go how God wants us to
[50:13] go.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; What? Watch here. Maybe we just read
[50:16] this part.
[50:19] Oh, wow. Is it ever fun to preach this
[50:23] morning? I'm sure glad somebody showed
[50:24] up cuz I would have blew up if you
[50:26] hadn't come.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Acts 121-17.
[50:31] Now watch what Peter's trial was. Now in
[50:33] the time of Herod the king, he had
[50:36] stretched forth his hand. Vax
[50:38] certain
[50:40] vax certain of the church. And he had
[50:43] killed a whole bunch of the message
[50:45] believers. He had killed James and John
[50:47] by the sword. And because he saw that it
[50:50] pleased the Jews. See, he was worried
[50:53] about his popularity. The king, you
[50:56] know, you got to watch those politics.
[50:58] They'll tell you anything to get their
[51:00] vote.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Herod was killing the Christians to get
[51:04] the vote of the Jews.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Did anybody see that he killed James? Go
[51:08] to the next verse.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And because he saw it pleased the Jews,
[51:15] they were going to keep them as their
[51:17] king. Keep killing those Christians. I I
[51:19] like that politician.
[51:24] And they were at the church praying. In
[51:26] verse seven, if we go, actually, we
[51:30] better go ahead just to show you how
[51:31] time. So Herod had had planned a time to
[51:35] kill Peter.
[51:37] And because he was afraid of this spirit
[51:40] called God, he put four guards to guard
[51:44] him. He was already in the inner prison.
[51:46] And this is uh where are we at? Peter,
[51:50] he slept between two soldiers and he was
[51:51] bound by two chains and the keepers at
[51:55] the door of the prison. In verse 7, and
[51:57] behold,
[51:58] and behold, an angel of the Lord came
[52:00] unto him.
[52:03] And it was a beautiful looking man like
[52:05] me,
[52:07] and it was a light.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a person.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.
[52:16] You get hung up on people, man, you're
[52:18] going to you're going to have a hard
[52:19] time.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; God's trying to show you the truth. But,
[52:21] you know, don't get hung up on people.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And the behold, an angel of the Lord
[52:28] came unto him, Peter. And a light shined
[52:32] in the prison. That was the person.
[52:36] The person that was an angel was God in
[52:40] the pillar of fire. Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; And he smoked Peter on the side and
[52:47] said, "Rise up
[52:49] and rise up quickly." And his chains
[52:51] fell off him. And the angel saw said
[52:54] unto him, "Guard thyself and bind thy
[52:57] sandals." And so he did. And he said
[53:00] unto him, "Cast thy garment about thee
[53:03] and follow me." It still's not a man.
[53:10] It's the light.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Don't get hung up on some man.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; We have one God.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And he's a spirit.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And he's called many different names.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; He's called Savior, Lord, King,
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Jehovah, Gyra, my provider. He's the the
[53:29] Elohim.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And he's just changing his mask. He's
[53:32] just
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And if you fall in love with one mask,
[53:38] &gt;&gt; sorry,
[53:39] probably change tomorrow.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Ah, follow me.
[53:47] Amen. And he went and he followed him.
[53:51] And Peter wished not this verse n wished
[53:54] not that it was true that he had was
[53:57] done by the angel. And he thought
[54:02] he saw a vision.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; He thought he was dreaming.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; There's no way I don't see nobody. I
[54:10] can't. You know, people nowadays, they
[54:12] want to be able to touch everything.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; If they have a million dollars, they
[54:16] want to be able to touch it. They want
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; You don't think so?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That's why you see people that got a lot
[54:24] of money, they buy a hundred cars.
[54:26] They're worth 100,000 a piece. They want
[54:27] to be able to touch their money.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Why would you do something stupid like
[54:31] that when they're just going to rust and
[54:33] rot out and devaluate?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Y that's right. Yes, sir.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Lay up your treasures where moth and
[54:39] rust this night comes and thieves and
[54:42] thieves and even if you're rich and
[54:44] thieves and thieves don't break through
[54:47] and steal.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; But we like to look at our wealth.
[54:53] That's why people along the river build
[54:54] a $5 million house. They're only worth
[54:57] three million, but they want to look at
[54:58] their money.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And then their tax bill is 50,000 a
[55:02] year, but they get to look at it.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; And they got to hire five nannies to
[55:07] clean it.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And then be a slave to the bank because
[55:10] they didn't have that much money.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; And then when they inherit it to their
[55:15] kids, they lose it because they couldn't
[55:16] keep the upkeep. Do you know how many
[55:18] palaces around the world that people
[55:20] lose because they can't pay the property
[55:23] taxes and the cleaning bill?
[55:27] Hello.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Dual Fairbank House in Betroy was one of
[55:31] those.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; But God got something a lot more
[55:39] tangible. See, don't don't take your
[55:42] physical your your earthly experience
[55:44] over to your godly experience cuz God
[55:46] won't give you an idol to pet.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my idol. He'll shatter that
[55:53] thing.
[55:54] He'll smash that little idle piece of
[55:56] wood. Do you know the prophet that put
[55:58] up the serpent in the wilderness that
[55:59] everybody looked at would be saved? He
[56:00] had to bring the next prophet to tear it
[56:02] down cuz they're like,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; "That's right.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Worshiping
[56:09] things.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; God is not a thing.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit."
[56:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Peter thought he was in a vision.
[56:22] Hallelujah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] That's amazing.
[56:31] Verse 10. And he passed the first and
[56:33] second ward. They had him in the inner
[56:36] prison cuz remember Herod wanted to to
[56:39] have a big party. Do you know Christians
[56:42] can actually party?
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel so sorry for you.
[56:51] I feel so sorry for you. You know the
[56:53] God I serve is not boring like you guys.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know that the Bible says that
[56:59] every soul that gives their heart to
[57:00] God, they throw a party?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; They have all the pizza you could eat in
[57:06] heaven.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; The angels are losing their mind because
[57:11] one soul
[57:12] &gt;&gt; give their heart to God. We come to
[57:14] church and we're like,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; "Yeah,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; sure wish you'd shut up.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is so boring." You know, I
[57:25] can't I can't do this. What's this?
[57:28] What? You know, I can't do this and I
[57:30] can't do that and I got to go here and I
[57:31] can't go there and I can't eat this and
[57:33] I can't drink that, but I can't do that
[57:35] and I can't. Who told you that?
[57:42] I want I want to just give you a news
[57:43] flash that's really fresh. Do you know
[57:45] that everything God did had Satan
[57:48] copied? Do you know a man getting drunk
[57:50] is copying the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:53] and Lucifer is a loser and a copycat of
[57:57] the King Jehovah. And he's trying to
[57:59] give you an imitation.
[58:01] He's trying to give you an imitation.
[58:03] But you know when you get the baptism of
[58:05] the Holy Ghost the next day you don't
[58:06] puke in the toilet.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[58:25] God was the one that knew how to have a
[58:27] good time.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And Satan copied it.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; God was the one that had worship the
[58:35] angels and the seraraphims at heaven
[58:38] saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[58:39] God Almighty. Holy, holy, holy is the
[58:41] Lord God Almighty." And the whole earth,
[58:43] the foundation started moving and the
[58:44] post of tabernacles started waving like,
[58:46] "Holy, holy, holy." And then Elvis come
[58:48] out and said, "Oh." Came out with rock
[58:50] and roll.
[58:53] You thought that was the first rock and
[58:54] roll.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; God had his own rock and roll when the
[58:57] saraphims in heaven were moved the
[58:59] temple and the foundation of the thing
[59:01] saying, "Holy, holy, holy is Lord God
[59:03] Almighty."
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[59:19] Your prophet said that if you're quiet,
[59:23] you died
[59:25] &gt;&gt; and we'll have a funeral
[59:26] &gt;&gt; because pretty soon you'll be smelling.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; He said if your religion don't have any
[59:32] noise, bury it.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Bury it.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Because you're soon going to be stinking
[59:39] up the place
[59:41] &gt;&gt; cuz this religion makes a lot of noise.
[59:44] You never know when the Holy Spirit will
[59:45] come on me and I'll just lose my mind.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; You never know if you pick up a high
[59:52] shaker. I could be driving down the road
[59:54] and I could just disappear and the truck
[59:55] could just drive off wherever.
[1:00:00] See, you should come to a point that
[1:00:02] every golden opportunity you get to
[1:00:04] witness that God is a spirit and you
[1:00:07] could disappear into a vision and the
[1:00:10] guy that you picked up, the hitchhiker,
[1:00:12] could be killed because he ain't in the
[1:00:14] vision yet.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; He might recognize that he's with a
[1:00:20] super being, a supernatural
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; being
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; called Jehovah.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:00:34] as soon as the spirit, this light took
[1:00:38] Peter past his trial.
[1:00:45] Wow.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[1:00:48] Verse 10. And they when they passed the
[1:00:50] first and the second word, and they came
[1:00:51] to the iron gate that leadth into the
[1:00:53] city, they opened unto him in one
[1:00:55] accord. Now, it never said the angel had
[1:00:57] to touch them or put the key in or or,
[1:01:00] you know, lay hands on it.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; They opened to him in one accord, and
[1:01:06] they went out and passed through the
[1:01:07] street. And forth with, are you got that
[1:01:11] up there? Right near the bottom, the
[1:01:13] last line. and forth with
[1:01:16] the light. The angel
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; went woo.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz his trial was over.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And then he went to the believers and
[1:01:33] they didn't believe what they were
[1:01:34] praying about that they believed that
[1:01:35] they believed.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] Woo!
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Watch what the prophet says in the angel
[1:01:50] of the Lord. He said, "Now angels have
[1:01:53] always been ministering spirits that are
[1:01:56] sent to the church." Is that right? And
[1:01:58] all through the apostles age and they
[1:02:00] were ministering angels that met the
[1:02:02] apostles and the disciples. Is that
[1:02:04] right? And they always appear to them in
[1:02:07] the form of
[1:02:11] light.
[1:02:13] For all you those people that are
[1:02:14] worshiping some person
[1:02:17] light,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; it always appeared to them. That's in
[1:02:21] the angel of the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:26] Is that right? It was light that shone
[1:02:28] down upon Paul that blinded him. Peter
[1:02:31] was in prison and the light shone in.
[1:02:33] The angel of the Lord told him the
[1:02:35] different places in the scripture
[1:02:36] referred to the pillar of fire was
[1:02:38] light.
[1:02:40] It was also the angel of the covenant
[1:02:42] that led Israel through the wilderness.
[1:02:44] It was light. What was that? And he ends
[1:02:47] it really perfectly there. It was
[1:02:50] Christ.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know Christ is not a being?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; You know Christ does not have a body.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; It's the anointed one.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Christ is the anointed one.
[1:03:10] marriage and divorce. Now, we notice
[1:03:11] that Paul Paul was raised up. He said,
[1:03:14] "My Lord," I I guess I told you this one
[1:03:17] already, but this is where I got it from
[1:03:20] the prophet's message.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, now that boy being a Jew,
[1:03:25] he certainly wouldn't have called
[1:03:27] anything unless he had seen a symbol of
[1:03:32] God. And he would have never called it
[1:03:35] Lord."
[1:03:37] But he didn't see nothing.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He just seen light.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; But it was the nature. Watch this. Let's
[1:03:45] just Oh man. Well, maybe we we got time.
[1:03:48] And Jesus said, "I go to the father and
[1:03:51] I came from God and I returned to God."
[1:03:52] And there he was back in the form of the
[1:03:54] pillar of fire again. And he said, "I am
[1:03:56] Jesus whom you persecute. It's hard for
[1:03:59] you to kick against the pricks." This
[1:04:01] Jesus is the name of God. This ain't a
[1:04:03] flesh being
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; because Jesus wasn't even there at that
[1:04:08] time.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the
[1:04:15] prince. And I really
[1:04:17] And this is the same pillar of fire that
[1:04:19] came through the bars and opened the
[1:04:21] prison doors and took Peter out
[1:04:23] mysteriously.
[1:04:25] And watch what he says the next
[1:04:27] paragraph. And then you'll always know
[1:04:29] anything by its
[1:04:33] nature. That sounds about like our
[1:04:35] Sunday message about a month ago. You'll
[1:04:38] know God by its nature.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; There's things that God don't chase. God
[1:04:46] don't chase money.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; God don't chase popularity.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; God's not a Hollywood politician.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for votes. He's
[1:04:56] looking for hearts.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature and anything that is
[1:05:01] known by the nature, the fruit it bears.
[1:05:04] And I ask you to watch what kind of
[1:05:07] fruit it bears. And this is a light.
[1:05:09] This light which is God. Now do is it
[1:05:12] all right if we do believe this is the
[1:05:14] prophet, right?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; The nature and this light which is God.
[1:05:20] What? But but but God had no God's
[1:05:24] light. He's a spirit
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; because he always goes back to the word
[1:05:28] and God proves it by the word and he
[1:05:30] preaches the word of God. God manifests
[1:05:33] it materially. So before you
[1:05:38] wow
[1:05:40] where am I in my notes? I think I
[1:05:43] skipped a few people.
[1:05:46] Wow.
[1:05:48] Praise God. Genesis 22 1 and 2.
[1:05:53] Here God with our father Abraham
[1:05:58] was tempting Abraham
[1:06:02] and it was a real temptation. It was
[1:06:04] what you're going through some of you
[1:06:07] right now. Make it personal.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Share it with God. Say, "God, I feel
[1:06:14] like you're coming after to kill me. I
[1:06:17] feel like you're coming after to kill my
[1:06:19] family.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Tell God,
[1:06:24] your angel's coming.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; 22 and 1. And it came to pass after
[1:06:30] these things that God did tempt Abraham.
[1:06:34] That's kind of unique. Why did God do
[1:06:37] that? To prove to Satan who he was,
[1:06:41] not just to Satan, but even to himself.
[1:06:45] And he said unto him, Abraham, and he
[1:06:47] said, Behold, I am here. Verse two. And
[1:06:50] he said, "Take thy son, thy only son,
[1:06:52] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee up
[1:06:54] to the lamb, and offer him up to a burnt
[1:06:57] sacrifice." I would have said, "Whoop!
[1:06:59] Wait a minute, God. You lost me right
[1:07:00] there.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; You lost me."
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; You I just I checked out right there.
[1:07:07] That one verse was the time to leave the
[1:07:08] church.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; You know why Abraham didn't check out?
[1:07:18] because he was already sold out.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; God already had his heart.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; He was just proven that he had his
[1:07:27] heart.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Do you know how much Abraham loved his
[1:07:33] son Isaac?
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; There was a miracle child.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Come late in his days.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; He was going to carry the promise. Going
[1:07:42] to take on the ministry after Abraham
[1:07:44] had died. Are you kidding?
[1:07:48] I tell you what, he pulled all his hair.
[1:07:50] He said, "Good."
[1:07:52] I mean, he had more than one sleepless
[1:07:54] night.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? I I I
[1:07:58] I'd like to just bump in here. I I got
[1:08:00] it in the quote. He said he he lost a
[1:08:03] few nights sleep. He was wondering,
[1:08:04] "What in the world am I going to tell
[1:08:05] Sarah?"
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Well, honey, I had this voice come to me
[1:08:11] and I just went up and I killed our
[1:08:13] family.
[1:08:18] Yeah,
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; you did a hunt.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now
[1:08:32] verse 10." Now, I skipped a bunch here.
[1:08:35] Verse 10. And Abraham stretched forth
[1:08:37] his hand and took a knife to slay his
[1:08:40] son.
[1:08:42] I wouldn't have done that.
[1:08:45] God knows I couldn't take that so he
[1:08:46] wouldn't ask that out of me.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; But he might take your son in a car
[1:08:50] accident
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; or a different way
[1:08:55] to
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; you know you want to make sure you know
[1:09:00] that's another good reason when you come
[1:09:02] to church is to really worship God in
[1:09:04] the spirit
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; because if you're too quiet, God might
[1:09:07] not be sure he's got your heart. So he
[1:09:09] might have to take your son
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; or your daughter.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because he's like, "Well, they
[1:09:13] just come to church and they just sit
[1:09:15] around like
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; and God's like,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; I wonder, Sister Joey,
[1:09:26] I wonder if he really loves me, the guy
[1:09:28] that sits here." Yeah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, I guarantee you that if
[1:09:34] you come to church and you're like,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; in the spirit of God.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; I don't mean I mean in the spirit of
[1:09:42] God.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; God won't have to go, I wonder if he
[1:09:49] loves me.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Because you're not concerned who's
[1:09:52] sitting beside you, what they're going
[1:09:53] to think or what your wife's going to
[1:09:55] think or what your kids are going to
[1:09:56] think that you're lost. Yeah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; And worship.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And And then God won't have to send you
[1:10:03] through
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; some tribes.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; You know, if God sees you starting to
[1:10:10] build the kingdom too much on earth,
[1:10:12] spending too much time to buy a
[1:10:15] Lamborghini and a big whatever that big
[1:10:19] something is, you might say, "I'm not
[1:10:21] sure. Yeah,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; maybe I'll just take all that from you
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; to see what happens after I take it all
[1:10:28] from them.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; See if they'll still come to church when
[1:10:31] they have to hire a taxi
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; or ride on the city bus.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; We might have to open a city bus in
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; town.
[1:10:43] Am I watch this?
[1:10:45] So verse 10, he said, "He stretched
[1:10:46] forth his hand with the knife to kill
[1:10:48] his son. And the angel of the Lord,
[1:10:52] called to him out of heaven
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; and said,"Abraham,
[1:10:57] Abraham."
[1:11:00] He said, "Here I am."
[1:11:04] Did you think it was like a man that
[1:11:05] grabbed his hand?
[1:11:10] No. Sorry.
[1:11:15] He said, "Lay not thy hand upon the lad,
[1:11:19] but rather do anything to him to him.
[1:11:22] For now I knowest that I have thy heart
[1:11:27] and seeest that thou dost not withhold
[1:11:29] thy son for thine only son
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; from me."
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:38] You know, I believe that Abraham could
[1:11:42] have sidestepped this trial
[1:11:47] from God. Yeah, I do.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't put so much emphasis,
[1:11:54] oh, honey, change his diaper. Change it
[1:11:58] fast. Did you wash his clothes three
[1:12:00] times today? Put a mask on them. We
[1:12:03] don't want nothing to hurt this little
[1:12:05] prize.
[1:12:07] Don't let the dog near him. Don't let
[1:12:09] him lick a cat. He might get leprosy. He
[1:12:13] might get fleas.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You don't think Abraham took care of his
[1:12:18] boy Isaac
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; with super precaution measures?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; You don't think he put him in the inner
[1:12:26] part of the tent and he slept in the
[1:12:28] doorway to protect them from all harm?
[1:12:31] Yeah.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You think he let him play around cliffs
[1:12:33] and mountains unguarded?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; No. He worshiped that little boy.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; All my hope is in this little boy that
[1:12:48] was promised by God
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; because he said, "Your seed will be as
[1:12:52] the sands of the earth and the stars of
[1:12:55] heaven." And it's all wrapped up
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; in this little Isaac.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying. I mean, if you
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; can do the trial again if you want to.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And Abraham's covenant be here. The
[1:13:18] prophet says
[1:13:20] he said Isaac put not put the hands
[1:13:22] behind. He's talking about Isaac. He's
[1:13:24] he was ready to to uh bind Isaac and to
[1:13:28] to sacrifice him because that's what God
[1:13:30] had told him to do. And Abraham lifted
[1:13:32] up the little lad and put him on the
[1:13:33] rocks. And here in the middle of this
[1:13:35] paragraph, maybe you might have to go up
[1:13:37] again, Vicki. He said, "Can you imagine
[1:13:40] him standing there trying his
[1:13:42] intelligence
[1:13:44] trying to go and work out what am I
[1:13:47] going to tell Sarah when I get back
[1:13:49] home?"
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:13:54] Yeah, he was in a trial,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; but the little buzz kept saying, "I'm
[1:14:00] Jehovah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I am a child of God. I'm no longer
[1:14:06] afraid who gets voted in in Canada." Cuz
[1:14:08] I am a child of God.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; I don't care who gets voted in anywhere
[1:14:13] cuz I am a child of God. I don't care
[1:14:15] how many warships they put in the ocean
[1:14:17] till they run into each other with their
[1:14:18] lights shut off because I am a child of
[1:14:21] God. It doesn't matter to me when
[1:14:23] California falls to the ocean and the
[1:14:24] sharks come in and swing into the Salt
[1:14:26] Lake Sea because I am a child of God.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; So that little buzz kept saying I am
[1:14:34] Jehovah. I will provide. Just follow me.
[1:14:37] Just trust me. I
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; And two things are working at the same
[1:14:43] time. What are you going to listen to?
[1:14:46] Who told you that?
[1:14:50] If you listen to this, you're gone. If
[1:14:53] you listen to that this, you can't go.
[1:14:58] You've got to be sure that it's perfect.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; You might as well say you got to be sure
[1:15:04] that it's God.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] We got another example and and uh we're
[1:15:14] going first Kings 19 1-8
[1:15:18] here. The prophet Isaiah had a couple
[1:15:21] rainy days in his life. You know, he had
[1:15:24] a few days that he was out of food and
[1:15:26] water and a few days that he didn't have
[1:15:28] a lot of money in the bank account and a
[1:15:30] few days that it was kind of dry around
[1:15:32] where he lived.
[1:15:35] And Abel
[1:15:38] told Jezebel all that Elijah had done.
[1:15:42] Elijah had just killed all their
[1:15:44] prophets, the false prophets, butchered
[1:15:46] them. Now he had done that when the
[1:15:49] spirit of God was on him in a powerful
[1:15:52] way
[1:15:54] and he with all with all how he had
[1:15:57] slain all the prophets by the sword and
[1:16:00] Jezebel sent a messenger. Now you know
[1:16:03] Elijah when the spirit of God was on
[1:16:05] him, he was fearless.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; He took on the whole country.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And then the wife of the country sent a
[1:16:13] messenger onto Elijah and said, "If I
[1:16:16] don't kill you like you killed all my
[1:16:18] prophets,
[1:16:20] let it happen to me what happened to the
[1:16:22] prophets." And Elijah got up and ran for
[1:16:26] his life.
[1:16:32] How did he do that?
[1:16:36] Because God was pulling back the spirit
[1:16:38] that was on him and he was seeing what
[1:16:40] Elijah would do.
[1:16:44] And Elijah went a day's journey into the
[1:16:46] wilderness and came underneath a juniper
[1:16:48] tree in verse n four. And he Elijah
[1:16:52] requested himself that he must die
[1:16:56] and said, "It is enough now, Lord. Take
[1:16:58] my life. I am no better than my
[1:17:02] father's.
[1:17:04] And as he laid and slept under the
[1:17:06] juniper tree, behold.
[1:17:10] Behold,
[1:17:14] your angel showed up. God is never late
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; and he's never early. He's on time
[1:17:21] perfectly. He got Elijah right where
[1:17:25] he wanted him because he had more work
[1:17:29] for Elijah to do. Don't think, church,
[1:17:34] that your trial is the end of what God
[1:17:36] has in your life.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That's nothing but a lie of the devil.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; He's got more for you to do. But he's
[1:17:43] just refining you.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; For what's to come ahead.
[1:17:52] And the angel of the Lord came
[1:17:56] and touched him and said unto him,
[1:17:58] "Arise and eat." And he looked, and
[1:18:00] behold, there was cake. Do you notice he
[1:18:03] never said there was a person standing
[1:18:04] there?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; They had a Sears from They had a stove
[1:18:12] from Sears
[1:18:14] or, you know, one of those stores,
[1:18:15] Temperaments or something. There was a
[1:18:17] baked strong white angel standing there
[1:18:19] cooking, flipping burgers and eggs and
[1:18:23] biscuits.
[1:18:25] No,
[1:18:27] no. So, sorry to to break your bubble,
[1:18:31] but God is a spirit
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; and God can just speak
[1:18:37] and it will happen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he arose and there was cake
[1:18:42] baked on the coals and cruise of water
[1:18:45] at his head and he did eat and drink and
[1:18:48] he laid down again.
[1:18:52] You don't think God could cook like
[1:18:54] that? How did he send mana to the
[1:18:56] wilderness for the children of Israel?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Did he have a big stove from
[1:19:00] temperaments there?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; A couple angels out with like six foot
[1:19:04] angels like flipping biscuits like
[1:19:05] heavenly mana. No, he just went
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; and the mana rain down from heaven.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Like we think we're so smart because we
[1:19:15] come out with GPS and like controlled
[1:19:17] missiles and that God had controlled
[1:19:19] missile food like a long time ago. Like
[1:19:21] I just Elijah just laying under the
[1:19:23] mystery and he just sends him a
[1:19:24] controlled missile right beside his head
[1:19:26] that cruise of water.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:19:36] Verse
[1:19:41] seven. And the angel of the Lord came
[1:19:42] unto him again the second time. Where
[1:19:45] did he go? He appeared again.
[1:19:49] And he touched him and said unto him,
[1:19:51] "Arise and eat." Because thy journey is
[1:19:55] great for thee. God is telling you after
[1:19:57] this trial that you're going through,
[1:19:59] your journey is going to be great. Just
[1:20:01] hang in there. Your angel's on the way.
[1:20:03] He's going to rebuild your strength.
[1:20:07] Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; For the journey is great for thee. And
[1:20:10] he arose and did eat and drink. And he
[1:20:12] went on the strengths of that meat for
[1:20:14] 40 days and 40 nights.
[1:20:18] Wow. God had big plans for Elijah.
[1:20:22] And Elijah wanted to end them all by
[1:20:24] taking his life.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; God said, "No, no, no, no, no. I sent an
[1:20:29] angel
[1:20:33] here. And what do dost thou hear? The
[1:20:36] prophet said, he said, God sent his
[1:20:38] angel. The angel touched him and he went
[1:20:40] to sleep. Then he woke him up and there
[1:20:43] were some corn cakes there and some kind
[1:20:45] of cakes baked laying on the side of him
[1:20:47] and he said, "Elijah, rise up and eat."
[1:20:50] Now you maybe want to look at the bottom
[1:20:52] two lines of that. There's the grace of
[1:20:55] God to you, the elect,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; his bride.
[1:21:03] There's the elect of God to you,
[1:21:08] the servants of God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; See, God was resting him.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:21:22] Just one more one more scripture and
[1:21:24] we're going to close.
[1:21:26] Matthew 4 1-11 and we'll try to wrap
[1:21:30] this up here quick by God's grace. I I
[1:21:33] trust you're getting this.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; We're all going through pressure,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; but your angel
[1:21:41] is on the way.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; God, you know, the Bible says that he'll
[1:21:45] never give you more than you can take.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; God knows exactly how to mold the clay.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He's the master and I'm the clay. Mold
[1:21:56] me and make me. And that that spitting,
[1:21:59] God, oh that hurts. Needs like making a
[1:22:02] lid on the boat. Oh,
[1:22:06] God knows exactly how far that clay will
[1:22:08] roll out
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; to make the lip. What about the lips
[1:22:12] that have a safety edge and they roll
[1:22:13] back underneath like that? Oh,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; he knows exactly how far he can bend it
[1:22:21] before it breaks.
[1:22:26] And you feel like you're in the fire cuz
[1:22:28] he's refining you. But then he's going
[1:22:30] to sit you right up there. Said, "That's
[1:22:33] me.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; What they are is me."
[1:22:40] All that I am, he poured into Christ.
[1:22:44] And all that he poured into Christ, the
[1:22:46] anointed one,
[1:22:48] he poured into you.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; He poured it into you. And he said,
[1:22:51] "World, Satan, you want to see me?"
[1:22:55] He said, "You want to see me? You
[1:22:56] haven't been to the Wyoming church.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Why? I'll give you the address."
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; You think I'm losing my mind?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "The deity don't
[1:23:14] dwell in heaven alone." No.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, you were looking for the return of
[1:23:21] Jesus like again or something. No, Jesus
[1:23:23] won't touch the earth because it's not
[1:23:25] cleansed yet. So when he comes in the
[1:23:26] rapture, he's going to be we're going to
[1:23:28] go to meet him.
[1:23:30] So the ones that Jesus is on the earth
[1:23:32] now is Jesus
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; cuz deity is walking around. Deity deity
[1:23:41] had a shower this morning. Picked a pink
[1:23:43] shirt.
[1:23:46] deity.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; You think my God wouldn't do that
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; in the prophet's time. He Whoa, whoa,
[1:23:56] whoa, whoa. I forgot to ask you what
[1:23:58] color of eyes you want in a socket that
[1:24:02] never had a ball.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; God didn't want to give the little girl
[1:24:08] an eye that she wasn't pleased with.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello.
[1:24:17] [Applause]
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I know this is going to maybe
[1:24:33] I'm going to bring this as general as I
[1:24:35] can,
[1:24:37] but it's 100% the truth.
[1:24:40] And we're just reading right out of
[1:24:42] Matthew 4:1.
[1:24:44] Do you know that Satan can't tempt God?
[1:24:51] But Jesus was tempted
[1:24:57] in the flesh.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Well, you thought the flesh of God was
[1:25:01] Jesus was God. But how would Satan have
[1:25:04] enough power to tempt God? Jehovah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:25:15] God can't tempt the spirit of Elohim.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He is the self. He was the selfexisting
[1:25:27] one
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; before there was anything there was him.
[1:25:34] Do you know that the very Jehovah, this
[1:25:36] self-existing one, created that little
[1:25:39] peepy little devil that you worry about?
[1:25:42] That little mouse.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Do you know that hell was created for
[1:25:51] Satan and his angels,
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; not for people?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. This Bible is amazing. when God
[1:26:08] sent an angel in our day that took the
[1:26:10] seals off the Bible and revealed the
[1:26:13] mysteries
[1:26:15] that we could just understand so
[1:26:17] clearly.
[1:26:18] And then this Jesus was led up of the
[1:26:22] spirit.
[1:26:23] See, Christ is the anointed one. God is
[1:26:27] a spirit. So here's God leading up his
[1:26:31] flesh son
[1:26:33] to the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:26:36] devil.
[1:26:37] Now, if you think I'm going out on a
[1:26:39] limb with this and you think, "Well,
[1:26:42] yes, I know Jesus Christ. That's the
[1:26:45] name of God. That's a spirit."
[1:26:48] And why God can't die as a spirit. So,
[1:26:51] he had to make a body to die for him.
[1:26:55] Because you can't nail spirits onto a
[1:26:57] cross because that'd be like nailing a
[1:27:00] ghost to a cross.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet said, "The spirit
[1:27:07] of God left Jesus when he died and took
[1:27:09] the sins of the world because God can't
[1:27:11] become sin."
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you think that the flesh
[1:27:15] body of Jesus is Jehovah, the flesh, it
[1:27:19] was when God was tabernacled in him. But
[1:27:21] as soon as he changed the mask, it was
[1:27:24] over.
[1:27:26] Because when Jesus was in that, God said
[1:27:28] he was a triune being. And Jesus himself
[1:27:32] went before he was going to die for God
[1:27:35] and he said, "God, change your mind."
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He prayed at the world in the before the
[1:27:43] garden. He said, "God, change your mind.
[1:27:44] I can't take this no more."
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; But
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; the bot was huge.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Because it showed that God had his
[1:27:54] heart. You know what the Bible says that
[1:27:57] that he speaketh to the heart what you
[1:28:01] know what the Bible says this it says
[1:28:02] whatever's in the heart will come forth.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; What you are in the heart will come
[1:28:08] forth. And Jesus said those amazing
[1:28:10] words. He said nevertheless.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; That was his heart speaking. That was
[1:28:15] not his brain speaking.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, not my will but thine be
[1:28:19] done Lord God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here we see in the
[1:28:23] second verse, and he went the 40 days
[1:28:25] and 40 nights, and he fasted. And then
[1:28:28] the tempter came unto him, and he said,
[1:28:30] If thou be the son of God,
[1:28:36] command these stones
[1:28:40] to be made into bread." And he answered
[1:28:43] and said, "It is written, man shall not
[1:28:45] live
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; by bread alone, by by every word
[1:28:51] that proceedth out of the mouth of God."
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; You see how perfectly Jesus is speaking
[1:28:57] here.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You know, when God was using Christ
[1:29:00] Jesus, he was the fullness of the bod
[1:29:03] godhead bodily. But when he was done
[1:29:06] with that body, it rotted just like my
[1:29:09] grandpa's.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Because he took another mask
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; and even Jesus said, "Every word that
[1:29:19] proceedth out of the mouth of God." And
[1:29:22] the devil taking them up and set him in
[1:29:24] the temple, and he said, "If thou be the
[1:29:26] son of God, cast thyself down, for it is
[1:29:27] written that he will give his angels
[1:29:28] charge over thee. For their hands they
[1:29:32] shall bear thee up, lest the time they
[1:29:34] dash thy foot against a stone. And Jesus
[1:29:35] said unto him, it is raining again.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
[1:29:44] See, Jesus wouldn't tempt God.
[1:29:48] That's why Jesus wasn't a showmanship.
[1:29:51] That's when Jesus went to the pool and
[1:29:54] he healed one person stepping over dead
[1:29:56] people, sick people, I mean. And he was
[1:29:59] doing exactly what the father showed
[1:30:01] him. I do nothing except the father show
[1:30:05] me.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Now if you believe Jesus is the father,
[1:30:09] then why did he have to have the father
[1:30:11] to show him?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, it's okay.
[1:30:20] Let's go to the and verse eight. And the
[1:30:22] devil takes them up into exceeding high
[1:30:25] mountain and shows them all the kingdoms
[1:30:27] of the world and the glory of the world.
[1:30:31] Now I just want to I want to just step
[1:30:33] in here. The prophet said
[1:30:37] the Bible says lay up your treasures
[1:30:38] where moth and rust. Don't put too much
[1:30:40] hope on this earth
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; because it is Satan's
[1:30:46] right. It's Satan's until we go in the
[1:30:49] rapture
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; and get to the millennium and God burns
[1:30:52] this earth over.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Every kingdom of the world.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Everyone,
[1:31:01] even the nice ones that I want to move
[1:31:03] to are controlled by Lucifer.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Every government
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; that's king over their property,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; their boss is Lucifer. Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Just so you understand that perfectly.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Taking him out to see and showed him the
[1:31:22] world and all the glory of all the
[1:31:25] kingdom. And he said, "And he saith unto
[1:31:29] him, all these shall I give thee." Whoa,
[1:31:32] wait a minute. Wait a minute. How could
[1:31:34] Satan said I give them? He owns them.
[1:31:38] I'll give thee if thou will fall down
[1:31:41] and worship
[1:31:45] me.
[1:31:50] That's why Christians
[1:31:52] don't build a kingdom on earth.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Because where your heart is, you would
[1:31:57] be worshiping the kingdom and that would
[1:31:59] be Satan's.
[1:32:01] So don't get too much tied up in brick
[1:32:03] and mortar and you know copper and gold
[1:32:05] and brass signals. Just use them for
[1:32:08] their purpose and then say, "Well, like
[1:32:11] Satan, you can have all them when I'm
[1:32:12] gone. Hope you enjoy my truck. It's
[1:32:15] pretty cool.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I'll have a better one in heaven."
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; It'll be just and I'll be there.
[1:32:26] And Jesus said unto him, "Get thee,
[1:32:28] hence, Satan, for it is written that
[1:32:31] thou shalt worship the Lord thy God."
[1:32:36] Why didn't Jesus say that? "Get thee,
[1:32:38] hence, Satan, that thou shalt worship me
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; because I do nothing until the father
[1:32:52] shows me." That's right.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; And yes, Jesus had the fullness of the
[1:32:59] Godhead bodily, but God was testing the
[1:33:03] badger skin.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; He was testing the badger skin cuz that
[1:33:08] badger skin was going to hang on a cross
[1:33:11] and represent God to take the sins of
[1:33:13] the world.
[1:33:16] Hallelujah.
[1:33:19] and him only shalt thou serve. And the
[1:33:21] devil leaveth him. And behold,
[1:33:27] angels.
[1:33:31] Angels. Does Jehovah need angels to
[1:33:34] strengthen him? See, if God can be
[1:33:37] strengthened, then that means he got
[1:33:38] weakened.
[1:33:41] I'm pushing your limits.
[1:33:44] God don't get weakened.
[1:33:47] So he don't need strengthen.
[1:33:49] And angels came and ministered
[1:33:53] unto him.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; You know who they were ministering onto?
[1:33:57] The flesh.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Because the flesh had fasted for 40 days
[1:34:03] in the wilderness and went through a
[1:34:05] great trial with Satan.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And he was ministering onto the flesh.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; God don't need ministered onto. God
[1:34:15] needs worship.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; We worship God. We don't minister to
[1:34:22] God. God don't need to hear this
[1:34:23] message. God is the message. The message
[1:34:27] we believe the prophet brought, it's not
[1:34:28] from a man. It's God. It is God. It is
[1:34:33] everything. The word is God.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; How can you tell God, "Well, this is
[1:34:37] what your word says." He already He is
[1:34:39] it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; I am it.
[1:34:44] He just needs worse. Our last scripture,
[1:34:45] Lamentations
[1:34:47] 3, and I'm closing. You can actually
[1:34:49] come, honey. Lamentations 3:22 and 26.
[1:34:52] And it is the Lord's mercy that we are
[1:34:55] not
[1:34:57] consumed
[1:34:58] because his passions, compassions fail
[1:35:02] not. They are new every morning. Great
[1:35:06] is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my
[1:35:09] portion, saith my soul. Therefore I will
[1:35:12] hope in the Lord. The Lord is good unto
[1:35:15] them that waiteth upon him to the soul
[1:35:18] that seeketh God.
[1:35:21] And it is good that man shall both hope
[1:35:24] and quick quite quickly wait for the
[1:35:28] salvation
[1:35:30] of the Lord. I want to just close with
[1:35:32] this thought.
[1:35:34] When your trial is over
[1:35:37] and God knows you're at your limit.
[1:35:42] He'll send you an angel.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; He'll send you an angel because God's no
[1:35:48] respector of persons
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; just like he sent an angel to all those
[1:35:53] examples in the Bible. He'll just go
[1:35:55] whoop.
[1:35:57] I want to just I want to just drop this
[1:35:59] in here for one second for all you
[1:36:02] parents that maybe have unsaved loved
[1:36:03] ones that and those examples if you
[1:36:06] didn't pick it up is they were not all
[1:36:10] believers.
[1:36:12] Saul was butchering the church
[1:36:17] but Saul was elected.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Did anybody hear me?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Saul was elected. So if you have an
[1:36:27] unsaved loved one that's out there and
[1:36:30] you don't think God can send an angel to
[1:36:32] grab that person,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; if he was predestinated in the mind of
[1:36:37] God before the foundation of the world,
[1:36:39] he might be butchering your character
[1:36:41] and butchering Christ's atmosphere and
[1:36:43] butchering all those things. And God
[1:36:46] will set the pillar of fire
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and strike them blind.
[1:36:52] And somehow in sin he'll say my lord
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; because he was elected.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; That's amazing grace.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; An angel of light coming to the church
[1:37:07] is grace.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; It's grace.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you sister.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:37:17] Wow,
[1:37:18] man. You were hunkked this morning cuz I
[1:37:20] could I was really able to preach.
[1:37:24] Thank you, Jesus. Oh, wow. Let's worship
[1:37:28] him. Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:31] Glory.
[1:37:35] Oh my
[1:37:38] amazing.
[1:37:39] Hallelujah. When you're that you're with
[1:37:41] sin, say, "Lord, I can't take it."
[1:37:46] Hallelujah.
[1:37:48] says, "Hang on."
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; My angel's coming.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Travel at the speed of light.
[1:37:59] Amen.
[1:38:05] From my mother's womb,
[1:38:08] you have chosen me.
[1:38:12] Love
[1:38:13] has called my name.
[1:38:18] I've been born again
[1:38:21] into the family.
[1:38:24] Your blood throws through my veins.
[1:38:30] I'm no longer
[1:38:33] slave to fear.
[1:38:37] I am a child
[1:38:40] of God.

[1:41:49] Yeah. Heat.
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:02] I am
[1:42:06] God. Hallelujah.
[1:42:09] Amen. I want to sing that song till the
[1:42:11] storm passes by.
[1:42:14] But when she's pulling this storm up, I
[1:42:15] want to share this with you. Do you know
[1:42:18] there can only be fear
[1:42:21] on your outer body?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; It's not possible to have fear
[1:42:27] on the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:30] You know the Bible says not to fear
[1:42:32] those that could kill the body
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; but that could take God from you.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the fear is this body.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; This body is going to pass away.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; This body was created to pass away.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; And so when you're a triune being you
[1:42:51] know our prophet told us this and I I
[1:42:53] I'm close. He said God chose the soul
[1:42:58] but God took the heart or Satan took the
[1:43:00] mind.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And so when when you asked yourself who
[1:43:04] told you that if it's fear it's Satan
[1:43:07] talking
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; God will never speak in fear down here.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; As a man thinkketh in his heart so easy
[1:43:14] is he
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; man we need to think with your heart.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; As a man thinkketh in his heart. I don't
[1:43:19] even what's fear? I I don't understand
[1:43:22] fear. I'm like a child that walks in
[1:43:24] front of a semi. I can play on the road
[1:43:26] every day. Cuz fear,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; who's fear?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you, God. But Satan, when
[1:43:34] you start listening to Satan, he comes
[1:43:35] up here and he goes, "Oh, you might get
[1:43:38] hurt."
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; If you if you hang around that Dale
[1:43:41] person, you might get hurt.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; If you hang around those holy rollers,
[1:43:45] they might they might they might get
[1:43:47] blessed.
[1:43:49] You might get drunk in the spirit. You
[1:43:51] might you might get the baptism of the
[1:43:53] Holy Ghost and cry in public. Can you
[1:43:57] believe that? That'd be so embarrassing.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; You you might be asked to sing a special
[1:44:04] and made a wrong turn or or re do a
[1:44:06] testimony.
[1:44:08] That's Satan. That's it right here.
[1:44:10] That's it. But God will never tell you
[1:44:11] that. He said, "That's my child. They're
[1:44:14] out there worshiping me. They're saying
[1:44:16] a testimony of how good I am.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; That's my child. as you think in your
[1:44:21] heart.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; So the next time you get the least
[1:44:28] little bit of fear like I don't know how
[1:44:29] I can make it through the day. Remember
[1:44:33] it's this person
[1:44:35] cuz just God will never tell you I don't
[1:44:38] know how you're going to make it through
[1:44:38] the day.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going to pay my
[1:44:41] bills the first of the month. The first
[1:44:42] of the month coming up tomorrow. Oh, how
[1:44:45] are we going to make the bread?
[1:44:46] Remember,
[1:44:48] remember that's Satan.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; That's Satan. God already paid your
[1:44:52] bill.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Where he wants you to live, he already
[1:44:55] paid it.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; He owns the cattle on 10,000 hills.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; He knows where all the gold is in the
[1:45:02] world.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; He's got the key to the long street.
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's like, oh man. Wow.
[1:45:16] Thank you Jesus. Wow. The the zone is
[1:45:19] just amazing.
[1:45:21] Thank you Lord Jesus. In the dark of the
