Just hoping to see as many uh new friends and old friends as possible this Wednesday. Brother Paul the Fontaine. So just pray that it works out good for him traveling and leaving his church behind and Amen. We need each other. We need other friends. We need other churches. We need we need other believers. We need everybody. This not we don't live in a closet. Brother Paul's been hugely kind to me personally. Hugely. and uh just it's a thrill for me to have him come. Amen. Brother Matt, will you come and take these prayer requests? Just remember our sick and our service. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be in your house this morning, Lord. We just ask that Lord, you just meet these needs that we brought forward this morning, Lord Jesus. uh those that were out sick, Father. We lift them up in prayer, Lord, this morning, knowing you're more than able, Father, to raise them up, Father. Just comfort them this morning, Lord. And Lord, speak to them, Father. And Lord, we'd ask that you'd be with the service, Lord. And just have your way, Lord Jesus. We're here to, Father, draw from you, Lord. Lord, we want to be mature Christians, Father, and be pleasing to you, Father. And we just ask this, Lord, that you just speak to each heart, Father, this morning. And that all that we do be pleasing to you, Father. And we just ask this in your precious name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I wish [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you Heat. Heat. The reason Amen. We worship him this morning. Amen. Amen. Maybe you can have your seats just for a moment as we have some announcements. Just Amen. Like we mentioned for prayer, just remember Paul Leontaine this Wednesday coming. Amen. And we're looking forward to that. Just some meetings coming ahead, different ones or as summer comes on. We're just getting ready to do our posters for camp and we have our ministry picked. Amen. For camp and so different ones have called and different things, but it's 1 of August. We just look forward to that. Amen. Amen. I just before I minister, I just want to make a a correction um from last Sunday um and just make a comment on that and uh so you everybody understands the video's still up. I've talked to brother Kyle and brother Kyle when he was ministering near the end of the message just misspoke. He didn't mean to say what he did, but he said Satan was co-equal with God. And he meant to say that he's almost co-equal with God. Amen. And Brother Bram actually said that in one quote. He said that Satan was almost co-equal with God. And another quote, Brother Bram said before the fall that Satan was co-equal with God. But in the message you have to understand the context of when the prophet says that because the one time brother Bram said that he is almost co-equal with God he was talking about Adam and Eve and he said they were co-equal until the fall and then Eve became Adam became the head of Eve and so he was comparing and he only does one little short paragraph he's preaching about the sin of the garden and he's preaching about Adam and Eve were were made in the image of God perfectly co-equal and then sin command and then Eve Adam became her head and the other time where brother Brham said about Satan being co-equal with God in heaven before the fall it wasn't even Satan so brother Brandham misspoke because Satan wasn't Satan until the fall it was an angel it was a cherubam angel I hope that don't stumble you, but that's just facts. There wasn't a Satan until the fall. And so, I want to give you just some things that Brother Bram said. Brother Bram said that the only thing that has eternal life is God. And and I'm I'm just this is just a short foundation. We're not preaching on this. But it would offend me to say that Satan is almost co-equal with God. or co-equal with God. And if that if you're sad that that offends me, that's your choice. But there ain't nobody even close to the God I serve. Because brother Brandham said, "The only person that there was before God was even worshiped was the spirit God." And to be eternal, you had to come from God. So if you say Satan is co-equal with God, if you even where brother said he's almost co-equal with God, you would have to say that Satan was there in the beginning with God or he came out of God as a seed. And that would make him your brother. So Satan is not even almost co-equal with God. And he definitely is not co-equal with God. See, brother Bram said that the ones that were in the thoughts of God, like us, that were spoken word children, that you could no more be lost than God could be lost. So if Satan was almost co-le with God, that means he would have eternal life. That would make him your brother. And the prophet clearly taught us that hell was made for Satan and his angels and it's not eternal. So even our prophet. Amen. Now, brother Kyle did not mean to mislead us. He misspoke. Amen. And with our prophet, he was doing it in different contextes. But that's a huge difference. The God I serve, there ain't nobody even close to him. Everybody was created by God and everybody has to get permission from God to do anything. So, so it's not like almost the same. It's like a million miles from the same. Amen. Let's stand and read Hebrews 13 5 and 6. Amen. Hebrews 13 5 and 6. And I actually didn't plan on sharing that. I promised L on the way coming. I just didn't think I would go that way. But I actually felt pressured to to correct that before any misleading or even on the video. Amen. People watch that. I pray if they watch last Sunday, they watch this Sunday. Amen. Amen. Let your conversation be without controversialness, and be content with which things that you have. For he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. Verse six, so that we may boldly say, "The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what men shall do unto me." For the Lord is my helper, and we shall not fear what men shall do unto me. Lord Jesus, I pray that that you will minister the word this morning like you ministered it to me, Lord God, and help us to understand you better, Lord God. Every time the word comes forth, it's to know you better, understand you better, and serve you better. And the word comes different every time according to your will, Lord God. And I pray that that it it'll be different. It might be different this morning to what people think, but I pray that in this differentness, it'll help us understand you, God. In a different way, we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I want to title my message this morning, A Silent God. A silent God. And I also want to tell you that I have things that I haven't even put in my notes yet. And so this is going to be one of the few parts that we're going to preach on a silent God. And many times in the Christian's lives, God is silent. Oh yes. Thank you. I didn't turn my mic on when I was singing cuz I didn't want nobody to hear me. Amen. Amen. Many times in the believer's life, but and and then many times he was just like I mean he was just overwhelming if he wanted to show himself. But I want to show you dozens so many I won't even finish them today. Dozens and dozens of examples of how God was silent in different matter of fact before I even read a quote from the prophet let me give you an example that happened almost in our day. And I don't even have it. I left it at home and it was supposed to be next Sunday's but I just feel to share it. It was it was overwhelming to me when I read it is the man that wrote the English Bible interpreted it. Do you know his name? I have the whole thing at home and I couldn't even put everything in my notes. God was silent to that man. Do you know that man? The very Bible you read, he gave his life for. I mean, he was burned alive, chained to a stake. Do you know that the the the church of the day then were were lying to the people? And do you know what that man said to the priests and and the the dignitaries of that day? He said his prayer was and and I I I could make this person I I pray you can he his prayer was the man that interpreted the Bible. He said, "I pray that after I'm gone or after I do this, that the smallest plow boy, the smallest farmer boy will know more about the scriptures than the priest." God answered that prayer, but he's not still alive. Because a dumb farmer boy can like me can know 10,000 times more about God than they did then. Do you know he ran for his life? He went to other countries for his life. And you know his best friend turned him in. best friend. That means it was a Christian. Just let that soak in for just a second. His best Christian friend told the church where he was so they could take him and burn him alive. Spirits don't die. We do that today by our character. burn people alive. And also when he his last breath was the prayer I told you earlier was an earlier prayer, but his last breath was he cried out to the king of England and and he said, "Oh king," he said, "change this law. Change this." Oh, by the way, he didn't obey the government. for all you good Christians that want to obey the government. He didn't obey the government. He went against every rule of the government. And he cried out on his last breast was, "Oh king, change this law that this will not be like this." And about one year after God was silent, was God silent? Let me ask you something. Did God send a prophet to take the the seals off the Bible? Did God send the pro Well, we know he did. Did God send a prophet to take the scales off of our eyes so we could understand the scriptures? Wouldn't have God wanted the Bible to be wrote so you could at least read it. But he didn't answer his prayer. God let him burn alive. Brother Bram said, "When you meet every circumstances and you know that it's according to God's will and the requirement of God has been met or you ask, have we met the requirement?" And God just lies there silent. He said he just won't answer us. That's in being certain of God. In 59 he said I'm sure I'm be preaching talking to people this morning who this has come to place and I have brother Brown. He said, "And I have been there many times myself. And when I look back and I trace my life and I turn every stone and I find that I've been and even if I had done something wrong and I confess it and I say," Lord God, may I've made it right and let's go do so." And then come back and I say again, "Now Lord, thou art God and you surely will answer me. Surely I've met every requirement and request that you you have established and you've got to be and and God don't move. And it seems like he's silent, then you've got to know for sure and your heart that he's still God. Amen. Next Sunday, we're going to preach on Job, but I want to go on some different ones. Job had to know that God was God. Amen. But let's look at four examples in the Bible where God never answered the believer's prayers. The widow woman, we could turn to First Kings, First Kings 17:12. Vicki, thanks. The widow woman. And God was allowing the widow woman to starve to death. And the widow woman said, she said, "As the Lord thy God liveth," when the prophet got to him, she said, "I have not a cake. I have nothing in my house to eat, but I have a handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the cruise. And behold, I am gathering two sticks, which is a type of the cross, and I am going to sacrifice my life and my son's life. I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, and that we may eat, and we know we will surely die. God was silent to that widow woman. Now, we know in this case, praise God, that God's never late. That's always the case. He's never late. But he came before this woman dies. Amen. And he sent her a prophet that said, "Surely the meal and the oil will never go dry until rain comes upon the earth." Amen. And so God God can see, I showed you both ways. That wasn't the case for the man that wrote the Bible. So you can read your Bible today. Amen. If we go farther down, let's go to Daniel 31 17 and 18. Amen. and uh look at another example and see how I want to God wants to show us this morning that if God don't move the way that we think he should or in the time frame that we think he should. I I might not get to it this morning, but brother Bram said that believers, we lose faith in God because he don't answer our prayer the way we required or prayed it. the way we pray. God pay my bills. And he chooses not to pay your bills. And you say, well, you know, you didn't answer my prayer. But he did answer your prayer. He did it the way that was good for you. I mean, it was his will. And so, you'll see this in the the three three Hebrew children, Daniel 3:17. He said, here they're coming. You know the story. But he says, "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace." Matter of fact, let me just stop right there for a minute. I'm going to read the quote this morning where God gave brother Brandham his his uh third commission, his third pull. And God came down to brother Brham and said, "You must accept it." And you know what brother Brham said back to God? He said, 'I'm afraid of seeing the vision wrong or speaking something out loud that you don't honor. Brother Bram was afraid of calling somebody out and saying, "I see this, this, this, this, this, in your life, and thus sayith the Lord, you go home, you're healed." He says that to God. He says that to the angel. God said, "I'm waiting for you to accept your commission." He's waiting for us to accept his commission. Amen. So, we see the Hebrew children's. He says, "We know that he's able to deliver us and we and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king." Now, see, watch this. They didn't know. They knew God could deliver them. But either way, they were going to be out of the hand of the king. To live is Christ, and to die is gain. Wow. I pray to God that we'll get there someday. But if not, be it known unto thee, oh king, that we will not serve you and your gods, nor will we worship the golden image that you have set up before us. See, the three Hebrew children had it figured out that if God was silent or not silent, he was still their God. And if God chose to either way, whether God was silent, and we know the beautiful story that he came down, the fourth person in the fire, and they come out, and there wasn't even smoke on them, and and it was tremendous, and and he wasn't late. But the three Hebrew children had a revelation that either way I want to tell you something this morning. Your God may seem silent to you. But he's still you have to have a revelation that he's still delivering you. He's still delivering you. If God never speaks to you again and never answers another prayer, is he still your God? Amen. Amen. Amen. That's that's where we have to be and come to. Brother Bam said, "I pray for the sick, and if I never see another sick person here, I'm going to continue to pray or preach that God's a healer, and he is a healer." And we've proven that many times here. Let's just look into Genesis 37, Vicki. And and we'll we'll start at verse uh three here. You know, I sometimes this is a paradox even especially for the kids, but Jacob got his new name was Israel. And every time I think of Jacob as Israel, I think of the nation Israel. And and so it almost messes me up. I But uh but here we see Israel and verse three. And he says, "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children." Now that's because you know it was God's plan. Amen. Because he was a son in his old age. And he made him a coat of many colors. And then the brothers saw the brethren saw that his father loved him more than all his other brethren and they hate him for it and could not speak peaceibly above him. Now for Joseph a type of Christ God was very very silent. Do you know God was silent to Joseph? almost 22 years. 22 years. Do you know God was silent to many? Look at look at the things. Look at look at Noah in the in uh in the Bible. He preached 125 years and not one person came to his preaching. Not 125 years. He had the identical congregation in his church. Watch how we jump down into Genesis 45 and Genesis 45 and 25. And when here here he's saying and and brother Bam's going to show this that God is silent. We we get I I I pray we don't but it's it's easy for us to lift up a holy man or a holy priesthood or a or or or somebody's holy. Everybody's looking for a hero in their life. But you're the hero. Yeah. Amen. And God don't show any of his family more than he would show the littlest ones among us. Brother Bam said zillions of times, God does not show his prophets everything. And I mean, we could show that in every prophet's life. But let's just show this here. And he did this. God didn't show it to Jacob or Israel, whatever you'd want to call him. He didn't show him no secrets for 22 years. He He God to Jacob was completely silent the whole time his son was gone 100%. He never gave him a vision. He never answered a prayer. He never my right would have died of famine. And they went to Egypt in verse 25 of 45. And they went to Egypt and came to the land of Canaan unto Jacob the father. In verse 26, and he told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is the governor over the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted. Why was God silent? We'll never know that. We don't even have a right to ask God. God knows best. Amen. Here, Jacob in the end of his Christian life, Jacob had obeyed God till the letter. He had left his well I mean he didn't start out till the letter but he he took Lot with him and he left the the land and family did and then he had to come do a complete separation from Lot and everything he had and and God promised he said I'm going to give you a land that you don't know nothing of and he he so journey said where are we going today I don't know where I'm going I'm just I'm just walking God was with him amazing and then all of a sudden it just woo nothing. When they got to the so-called land where God was going to show them, God promised that he would show them the land. And when they were on their journey to the land, God stopped the directions. They hadn't reached the promised land yet. Amen. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. And they told him all the words of Joseph which he had spake unto them. And then he saw the wagons and Jo was Joseph sat and saw and carried him in the spirit the wagons which Joseph Joseph had sent sorry to carry him. And the spirit of Jacob their father was revived. And Israel said, "It is enough. Joseph, my son, is yet alive." and I will go see him before I die. Brother Bram said this 21 times that God don't show his prophets everything. Let's just read this in questions and answers. He said the prophet, the prophet of the Lord was blinded and deceived by his own son. The prophet Isa Isaac though the prophet Isaac though the prophet Isaiah though through him come Christ. So Christ came right down through his family lineage but he was still blinded by his own family member and we can call him a prophet and the Bible says that he was a prophet and was blinded. Wait a minute. I thought prophets were seers. Here's brother Brown saying he was blinded. God don't tell his prophets everything. He just tells them what he wants them to know. See, and God was working out a plan for them then. And he had worked it worked in it. And God, if you will submit yourself to God, you got to make sure God will make it known to you and he will work right through your plan. Amen. Amen. If we turn to 2 Colossians 32, I want to look at another believer here. Amen. He Hezekiah, King Hezekiah, and if you look at this, and I want to just give you some story, but if you read the whole chapter of 32, King Hezekiah was a believer, blessed of God, a Christian, did all sorts of things for God. But I want to show you something very peculiar in the Bible in verse two. I just I put some verses down at the beginning just to lay to show you how much he was blessed. And when Hezekiah saw that that the uh other country was come and that that they had proposed to fight against Jerusalem, he took counsel of his princes that they might the men of God might stop the water of the mountains. The fountains, sorry. which were without the city. And they did, and they helped them. And let's go to verse 12. And hath not the same Hezekiah taken away the high places, and his altars, and had commanded Jordan and Jerusalem, saying that thou shalt worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it. And then if let's just drop to 22. And the Lord saved King Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of of these enemies and from the hand of the other and guided them on every side. In verse 23, and they brought many gifts of the Lord to Jerusalem and presented them to King Hezekiah in Judah, so that he was manifest manifested in the sight of all the nations from henceforth. But I'm going to show you. So, so King Hezekiah was a total 100% believer of God, obeying God. God had blessed him multiple times. If you read that whole chapter, he got sick. God raised him up, protected him from the enemies. You know, King Hezekiah was serving one God and all these things. Amen. And if we jump down to verse 30, and the same Hezekiah also stopped up the upper water courses uh and he brought straight down the side, the west side of the city of David. And King Hezekiah proposed all of his works. But watch what happened in verse 31. This is a very, very peculiar story. And just for time, if you went back and you read all this, it would lay it out. I mean, I've studied the chapter. But how be it the in business that the ambassadors of the prince of Balum were sent on to him to inquire of the wonders of God. Wow. That was done in the land. So here all the other countries were coming around and saying, "Wow, you have an amazing real God." And we can't believe what he's done in your life. And God left him. Wait a minute. That's not in the Bible. And God left him. I thought the Bible said that God would never leave us nor forsake us. And God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart. See, God never really left him. But God wanted to know, are you a son or are you a daughter? You know, the Bible says that every son and daughter of God, he's got to prove. Do you know who I am? Am I do you know in in difficulties and afflictions, do you know I'm still the same person? That's why, you know, today on Just the Natural, a good way to say it is, you know, if you see somebody that was uh given everything they want, they call them a silver spoon. Some kids are silver spoons. They were never they were just given anytime they asked for a toy, they got it. They got their own way. Another old fashioned way would be say a good oldfashioned brat. But God won't have no brats in heaven. Amen. Let's look at some examples of our prophet here. He said, brother Bram said, he said in his life story, he said, "Oh my," he said, "the it was here's where I made my mistakes, friends. Now I want to I want to just step in here and some of these examples brother Brown gives. You don't have to make a mistake for God to be silent. You could be pure but God will still be silent in different times of our life. But in this case he said here's where I made my mistakes friends. I listened to my mother-in-law instead of listening to God. And if I would have went ahead then and this great thing would have been manifested before this and he was talking about his mother-in-law didn't want him to go to the Pentecostal people and so he said but because I listened my mistake was listening to somebody else and that's where all my sorrow started. I want to show you a couple examples of our prophet and uh and just show you different uh stories of how God was silent in our day. And I know there's different times that we'll see, but I I want to go through his life. He said, "Here, my baby was lying in the hospital sick." And he said, "I got down and I said, God, there lays my daddy. His daddy had died. His brother had died. And the flowers were still on their grave. And there lies hope. His wife had died lying yonder. And his baby was sick in the hospital dying. And brother Bram said, "Lord, don't take her." And he said it was like God just pulled the curtain. As if to say, now this is what the prophet said. as if God said to him, "Shut up. I don't even want to hear you at all." And he wouldn't even talk to me. Now, you know that story is better as good or better than I. But he said when that happened, that's when Satan came on the scene. And he said, "Satan come on." And he said, he said, well, the prophet actually says, he said, then it was Satan's turn. And that was God proving his prophet that he was a real son. And he said, Satan told him some things that were truthful. Satan will always have a lot of truth. He said, I thought you said that God was a good God. He said, "That's all this. What's all this that you've been hollering about preaching that God's a good God and you're just a boy?" And he said, "Look around you." He said, "All over the city." He said, "Every girl and boy from every association thinks that you've lost your mind because brother Bam was so consumed and following God and preaching." And he said, 'I sat there all night and all day and I said that to God and he said, 'What have I done, God? Show me, Lord, and don't let this innocent girl, boy, sorry, have to suffer and all these people suffer because I've done wrong. He said, tell me what I've done and I'll go make it right. And Satan said, "What have I?" Satan was telling him how he had preached all day and all night and give himself his life constantly for God. Satan said, "That's right." He said, "You said now," he said, "when it comes to you," he said, "you told all those people that you believe that he's a great healer. Where's your great healer that you were preaching about?" He said, "There lays your baby and your wife's dad." And he said he God refused to hear him. His wife was dad. And the story goes on. He said, and here's brother Bram listening to God. And he and because brother, you watch this. When Satan comes and tempts you, Satan will tell you the truth. He'll say, "Those people mistreated you." And you can say, "Yep, they sure did." And he'll say, you know, God ain't corrected this. You know, vengeance is mine, sayaith the Lord. He said, yep, nope. God ain't made it right. See, Satan will tell you all kinds of truth. Say, but they're not worthy to serve you. And you say, "Yep, no, that's right. I definitely I know their parents. I remember when they were born." See, Satan's telling you all the truth. And brother said, he said, "I began to listen to him." And he said, It was truth he was telling me. And he said, "I reasoned through that thought." He said, "That's right." And he said, "As much as you've done for God," and he said, "Yet he's doing this to you." He said, "That's right." He said, "I began to think of it." And he said, "Well, what?" He said, "You see, everything began to break away." And then when it came in, it come in like reasoning. But he said, "What was it then? It stayed there and it just was ready to say he said and brother Bam says the reasoning was so strong. Watch this. This prophet says this so strong and so true. Brother Bam said his exact words then was then I'll quit. Can you imagine our prophet saying then I'll just quit. But see, God had to try. Everybody has to know. You know, God's omnipotent, but he'll let you prove your own testimony. God knew that Brother Bram was qualified to be a deacon. God knew that Brother Bram loved him. God knew that Brother Bram was predestinated. God knew that he was called before the foundation of the world, but he still tested him. And I said, "That's right." And I began to think that then I'll just quit. And then he said, "I got down to the reasoning powers and it broke." And he said, "It came to that eternal life, that new birth." And he said, "That's what hung me held me there." And then I thought, "What? What am I? What am I anyway?" He said, "That I would question Jehovah. Who am I to question the creator that created me on this very earth? Where did I even get that baby from? She's not He's not mine. Anyway, God just loaned me my baby. And the prophet said, "And Satan, get away from me." And you know the story. He went on and and he was, you know, rebuked Satan and and everything changed. Is the life worthy of the gospel? Amen. God's trying us to see if our life is worthy of the gospel. Even though he already knew that Brother Bram's life was worthy of the gospel. Amen. Amen. Let's just look at another example here of our prophet before we close here. Brother Bram was talking. He was invited to a camp meeting. I'll give you the the message when we get to the bottom here. And brother Bram was having a big camp meeting. God was moving in his in his ministry tremendously. I mean, he was literally, you know, the story completely. And brother Bram got there and God closed his throat and he couldn't talk. And he had all the believers of brother Bam that was around him. He had confidence. Brothers with the literally with the baptism of the Holy Ghost come and pray for him. And and they came and and God was silent. And they brought him medication to take for his voice. And many of the brethren come in and famous brethren and prayed for him. And he names them. And I'm just slipping through this. Amen. And brother Brown began to question. And he said, "Why would God set up the camp meeting, do all the money for the preparation, bring all the people to drive here, and I can't talk, and I can't talk." And brother Brum got his wife and he says, "Isn't it good to have such a s a wonderful wife, a real wife, a real companion?" And he said, "She sat down beside me." Now, Brother Bram had been above the campaign was the end of the week, so he'd been sick all week, and it's time for him to minister. He hadn't done nothing wrong. His wife sat down and she was real close to him and he said, "Ma, I wonder sometimes. I wonder what's the matter. Why would God do all this meetings in preparation? Why would God call him to send out a message to call us out of Amen Leosia the denominations? I mean, call us into Christ. And he said, I laid there and he said, I was talking to my wife. God wasn't answering his prayer. Now, Brother Brown would have went out in that campaign and repeatedly by the hundreds, God would have answered his prayer. But behind closed doors on his own life, God was silent. And he said, "All the believers have come and prayed for me." No answer. He got medication from the hospital. No cure. And he said, "I said something to my wife." He said, "Sometimes I wonder if God even called me." I would say, Brother Brandham was fairly low. Amen. Amen. And his wife came back. She said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself." She told me, she said, "Billy, don't you know God better than that? God knows exactly what he's doing." He said, "You just be quiet." Brother Bram said, "His wife rebuked me huge." And brother Bram seen a vision of how the people that were around him working in the church in the message had too much influence on his life and they were going to come. He God gave him a vision. A vision broke after his wife slapped him up. And he seen three people coming and God said, "Those people are going to come and tell you that they have thus sayaith the Lord for you to go do such and such." And he said, "They're very sincere, but they're sincerely wrong." Amen. You know, we have to get our own experience from God. Amen. We have to know what God has for us. And God showed Brother Bam afterwards in this. He said, "You're you're too close to these brothers. You're too you're depended too much on them." You know, Brother Bam got his stomach disease that way that almost killed him. He listened to the brothers. The brothers knew that God was calling them to the thousands and God had given them a direct order to go to the 50. And brother Brennham actually fought him pretty hard on it. But the pressure was so great he disobeyed God. Amen. But there's what what God's saying is a silent God. Amen. Brother Kyle mentioned it even and it was beautiful. He said he said we're in the harvest time now. And you know they they say this as a farmer you know in the heat of the summer and in July or August when you get the abundance of rain that they talk about they say if you walk in the corn field you can hear it grow. You know on a regular basis when we would go away in July we'd come home and the corn would grow like we'd be gone 5 days the corn would grow 2 three feet. We would go and it wouldn't be in tossel and it would be in full tsel when we come home four or five days. Many times I knew when I would spray my corn before I would go to the Ohio camp. I'd say if I never get a spray before I come home in four days, I'd never drive in this field. But we're not living in that stage now. We're not in that season. It's not given. This message is not given to the world. The world never all came from God. And we're brother Brown preached a message. I can hear the sound of the combine and we're laying in the press of the presence of the sen. And you know I and I've I've mentioned this before many times in the past, but you know when the combine comes through, anything that's green or soft gets destroyed, gets smushed and it goes out the straw chopper. When I'll harvest my wheat this summer, you know, if there was a laid head that comes up, normally around where water lays, watch this. Watch this. Water is a type of the Holy Ghost. But if it h if it's so much of that water in the natural that the weed will come up late around the edge of the holes and it's real, but when the combine comes, it'll smush it and blow it out the back end because it hadn't had enough time in the sun. It had the Holy Ghost, but no sun. It had the water but not enough not enough long enough son. Amen. Amen. Amen. It it's it's it's just a mystery. And you know, you say, "God, why why can't God's God?" Amen. Why would why would you know, you just look in your own life and you you see people that you grew up with, Brother Gar any one of us. myself. I'm the youngest of eight kids and I'm here, but where's the eight? Amen. Why? Why? I Why they Amen. And and and we can ask God, but we can't demand of God. It's a mystery. It's just a mystery. But when when we come into the combine age, it's going to be pokey. Uh-oh. Sharp. You know, we when we would harvest wheat and we're bailing straw, it would get under our things and we would I can remember when we would square bail in the days that work was real and uh the straw when it's broke up will be like sharp thorns and we get little slivers of straw, just clean straw, perfectly clean, and it would get just a little bit of juice there or or whatever and you just slide that right out. A little juice or pus would come out. And many of you sitting right here have been poked with slivers and dry stuff because the it's at the harvest time and there ain't nothing very little soft in the harvest. But when that combine and you know the combine will take the very first thing that hits that combine besides cutting it is the beers and it beats a living tar right out of it. And that's like a silent God. He's pounding the life out of you because he's separate. Brother Brham said God's looking for separators. That's right. Separators. Amen. It's it's it's hard to understand. He's looking for separate and he's he's beating us up. But he had to to separate us. Wait a minute. Why did brother Brown had to move his whole family? God was beating him up because he was separating them for a commission. Why did if God hadn't beat me up, I wouldn't have left my my little holiness church that still down on Dawn Valley Road. And right, he had to he had to do the same thing to you. He had to beat you up to pull you out. But the valuable stuff goes in the bin. It goes in the garner. And it'll last for years because it don't go bad under silence. Because the things of the moisture of the world is all what would decay it are gone. Amen. It's it's a great mystery here in this this story. You know they said brother Bam was sincerely wrong and they showed it God showed brother Bam this mystery. He said you're you're staying this was a 60 quote go tell. And he said, "You're you're dependent too much on the people around you and and all these things, but but boy Abraham came so much. He he felt so separated from God. So separated he wondered if he even was. And it took his wife to shake him." Amen. And brother, I'm just finishing this quote here. And brother Bam said, he t Well, let me just go back enough to catch him. He said, 'I looked down and he said, there was waiting my new ministry to be confformed in you.' This is the angel. This is God telling him this. And he said, I've already confirmed it in you. I I want to tell you something. God's all if God is silent to you this morning, he has already confirmed your testimony and your baptism of your Holy Ghost inside you. He trusts you. He don't need to show you a show. And I mean, if if God does, we're happy. We're not going to deny anything that's God. But God's already proved that you're ready. You're at the state that he can say like Job said, "Though the skin worms eat my flesh, in my flesh I'll see God." It's it's it's a radical. He said, "God's already confirmed it to you. I've already confirmed it to you." He's he's talking to brother Brandham. He said, "It's already confirmed." He repeats it. He's talking about Brother Bram's ministry. But that would be the same as you getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I've already confirmed it to you. I'm proving it to you. But he said, "You got to accept it." See, I stood there and I listened to God just a minute and it came down into my mind. He said, "I don't I didn't hear that and it was just to come into my mind." And he's he's going through this. Amen. He said it's like a man a sinner all his life and he knows that there's a Bible and he knows that there's a God but all at once he hears a sermon and something tells him and he says it's you. It's you that's got the baptism of Holy Ghost. And then that's that same word that's been there all along and it just confirms that you're one of them. And God said to brother Brown, he said, "You got to accept it the same way." He was talking to brother Brown about his commission. He said, "This was the third pull." He said, "You got to believe in it the same way." You know, when God if when God predestinated you, you we we did that a couple weeks ago, but you can prove that by your draw to God. You didn't get up here and come to God on your own flesh desire. The Bible proves it that all flesh ran from God. So something supernatural drew you to God. It wasn't flesh. It was a predestinated seed. Amen. But you got to believe in it. And he said, watch what the watch what he said. Brother Brandham answered God. He said, I was afraid of defeat. Some of us that had the probably all of us have had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We make mistakes every day. Paul made mistakes every day. say, "I'm afraid to say I got the Holy Ghost in case I make a mistake." And Satan, come and tell me. Cuz it'd be the truth what Satan would tell you. Well, you fell down, Dale. You shouldn't have treated them like that. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. You're not worthy and you ain't got it yet. Say liar. I just proved I did. I just proved I did. I'm still living in a fleshly body, but you're a liar. And you tell me I don't got it. I do got it. Amen. He said, "I was afraid of defeat anyway. And I was afraid to bring reproach on the church." Many people that get the baptism of the Holy Ghost say, "I'm afraid to say I'm I'm one of them. I'm predestinated." All because I'm still living in a human body. This human body will disappoint each other every day of the week. I've probably disappointed you a whole bunch already today. And you'll be disappointed. That's just flesh. But we got to look past our flesh into our supernatural predestinated seed. Amen. Now, I don't mean we should go around trying to do that. But if you're breathing today, most of you husbands have already disappointed your wife or your wives have disappointed you. I mean, that's just life. Amen. He said, "I was afraid of the reproach. I was also afraid of watching, seeing I was afraid of watching and thinking that I would call the thing wrong because I took a warning out of the Bible how Moses was given great power." So, Brother Brown here, he's recognizing the responsibility of God's word. And so, he gives us a couple examples here. He said, "Here, brother Moses had the full power of God." And God told him to speak to the rock, and Moses struck it twice. And he said, "I was afraid of being Moses." But I want to tell you this morning, God's given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you don't need to be afraid of being his people. You don't need to be afraid of your testimony. It's God that will hold your testimony. God's not really concerned about all this flesh, the badger skin. The badger skin will come and go, but he knows that you were in the thoughts of God. When you get the revelation that you're in the thoughts of God, even if you make a mistake before the day's out, that don't change that destiny at all. He said, I was afraid to be like Moses. He was given great power and spoke the rock. And he said, "Remember Elijah bec the because he was baldhead the kids come out and called him a baldy and he cursed the boys and the 42 boys." Brother man said, "I don't want to do that. That wasn't the Holy Spirit that killed those boys." But he said it was a prophet, an angry prophet. And he said, "I went through this all the time thinking I'm going to make mistakes." Brother Brown was afraid of making mistakes. So he wanted to hide, but we can't hide. Amen. And he said, I was here. Let's just go. Then we're going to finish on this. And there he stood there, God stood talking to me. And he said, but you've walked too many times with these too many people around you. And he said, you got to walk with me alone. You got to listen to me alone. And there they seen him. He here's brother B uh God telling brother Bham he said you're trying to please all the churches and all the denominations but he said you got to follow me in your ministry. Amen. Amen. A silent God. Many many times and the first thing Satan will come and tell us when God's silent is I thought you said I thought your confession was that God was a healer. But now he's silent. You won't even heal your wife. I thought you said you had the Holy Ghost, but you just made that mistake. I thought you got angry and you How could you be angry and have the Holy Ghost? Remember this, church. When Satan comes back to accuse the brethren, he'll bring a lot of truth, maybe even 100% truth. But he's seeing But Satan's seeing the badger skin and God's seeing the blood. Satan's seeing your badger skin. If you want to look at Brother Dale's badger skin, oh buddy, you don't love to look behind your side. You can look at the best side. You'll see lots of badger skin. But God's looking at the blood. He's looking at the seed. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand. A silent God. You know, brother Bam said that whether God, you know, he talked about it in riches. He said prosperity and wealth and even gifts, gifts and callings are without repentance. And so sometimes we see, you know, if God was blessing you with wealth or or houses and land, you think, "Oh, well, see, I'm I'm doing everything right. I'm paying I'm supporting God's kingdom." and and and it very well could be that way, but it don't necessarily prosperity or wealth or even gifts. You could have you could prophesy all day long and and see visions and all that and there'll be many people like that. Gifts and callings, the ministry we we tend to in the flesh will lift up a a tremendous ministry with a tremendous delivery and a tremendous anointing of God. It's the anointing of God. But it's without repentance. Amen. We can't put nothing between us and God. Amen. Amen. God help us to recognize when God's silent, he's just proven to the world that you still believe. He's just proven to the world that you still believe. You know, the ones that are not predestinated when God's silent will leave. We'll leave guaranteed 100%. Amen. When God's silent, they'll leave. God, help us to God help us to look past the natur the nature of I'm not saying we should re love and respect each other. I I I we all know that that's kindergarten. But we need to look past that and say, Amen. and see the eternal value, the eternal life that's represented there. Amen. See, try to see the predestinated seed in your brother or sister's life and the badger skin will become a lot less focused. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Thank you [Music] Lord. Thank you Lord [Music] Jesus. Thank you [Music] Jesus. Amen. Mhm. Mhm. more than ever. May for the Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, the words of these songs, I know that they radiate every person in this building, Lord Jesus, I believe that, Lord, that more than ever before, however you decide to bring this harvest to fulfillment, Lord God, Lord, we know that the Bible says says that everything that can be shaken will be shaken. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we love you abundantly. And Lord, we thank you for all the wonders that you've done in our midst. And Lord, if there's a time or if it seems like there's a time in any one of our lives or even in the church that we go through a quiet time, it's just laying deep roots down, deep teaching to show that when the winds of false doctrine come, that we'll stand straight in the test of time. Lord God, I pray that you'll help each one of us in this end time that we're living in. It's about going home time. Lord God, we pray. We know we can see the signs. You'd have to You'd have to be completely foolish to not recognize what's happening. Lord God, help me. Jesus, help me. Lord Jesus, always we pray that you're the capstone over our lives. Lord God, bless these wonderful, kind friends, brothers and sisters of ours and all that are sick. Lord God, we pray for healing in their life. And the ones that are away visiting and traveling, may they have a wonderful blessed blitz time. Lord God, we love you with all of our hearts. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. We're going to sing that again. And I just have an announcement, maybe a short announcement if you don't mind standing. We're at the point of going home. Amen. Amen. And I'm going to show you the state of the world. Mark Carney that's running for the Canadian election. You know, it don't matter who wins. God's in control. Brother Dale's not telling you politics. I'm showing you the time of the rapture. He has said that he has clearly stated that what Canada needs is a world economic form and that is that you will own nothing and be happy. He's actually clearly stated that. And the first bill that he passed when he was appointed, this will affect you. You might not think it'll affect you. It'll affect you. The very first bill that the Liberals passed was that they are going to get rid of all charitable receipts. They are going to take away all charitable HST and in many cases they are going to reclaim the charitable property from the churches. I have the Fibio audit. I sent that to other pastors and they actually looked it up and vindicated it. It's proven. If we have a liberal government, you're done getting a charable receipt. You're done getting the taxes back. And in many cases, the people that you know that the churches is in the church name, the government will take that. Now, you don't have to lose fear because it'll only be a year or two and they're coming for your house because he's clearly said that you owe nothing and be happy. We're at the point of going home. We We have to leave this place. We're not concerned about money. money. I mean, we just need enough to stay warm in the winter and a little bit to eat. But we can't survive what's going to come on this world. You can't survive a world economic world cuz that's a one world government. We won't be here. So, we're not concerned. If the liberals get in, we'll just say, "Praise the Lord. It's going to be really soon." Amen. I'm not preaching fear. I'm just bringing this to reality. You know, I showed that to some believers, and Jared was one He said, "Dad, I just cannot believe that you have that imprint. God is telling you. You got just a little bit of time. A little bit. If you think that they take every church and property that's registered under a church church organization that they're not coming for your house, you have your head stuck in the sand. so far that you're an ostrich. Amen. Remember, Brother Bram said, "It's the living saints that ask Christ to come and take us out of here." I pray to God that every one of you living people will say, "God, get me out of this crazy pest house, including this crazy. Give me a new body and take me out of this. I can't survive this world." Amen. Help me, Jesus. And it's the living saints that will call them and the and we won't hinder the sleeping ones. They'll rise first and we'll all go together. But it's you that when you get good and fed up with this world, you'll say, "God, I'm finished. I'm completely finished. Get me out of here." Amen. God, help us. More than ever your distance before [Music]
