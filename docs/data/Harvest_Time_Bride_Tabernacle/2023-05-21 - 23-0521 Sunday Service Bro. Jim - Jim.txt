service and Jared and just great to be here amen we're just going to ask our young magicians to come just as we make some announcements and man we we believe brother Jr was going to minister for us but uh because of circumstances he let me know at quarter to ten last night that he couldn't come and I figured brother Jim was snoring by then because brother Jim was going to pick him up and and uh so I thought I was Minister and I called brother Jim and I was I I was completely prepared maybe tired but completely prepared and so I never said nothing to brother Jim and brother Jim came in this morning he said you know I was awake in the night preaching to myself I said well man if you get a preach to yourself amen so just pray for him he actually yeah left his notes at home and I know how that feels it kind of feels kind of feels like you got your air balloon poked with a needle but God said God knows everything amen God just knows everything you know man and just also just some uh just even on that same note you know God uses all one of us you know it just just only for a second it just you know God never God made us gods but not to each other I'm studying that and you know the prophet said people came to the prophet and they said what should we call you Dr Branham Reverend Branham Bishop Branham man of God Branham and he said if you love me if you love me call me brother Brown if you love me because see we don't have Bishops and you know we're all men of God just kind of be careful with that you know man we we believe in respect but you know what I mean God help us we don't have a hierarchy in the fivefold ministry and or in the bride of Christ we're all brothers and sisters men of God because we were all made in the image of a man Christ Jesus that's beautiful that's powerful amen and and so I'm not preaching but but uh just pray for me I do have a message that's uh either gonna have to be two messages or it's going to be in two and a half hour message and I'm not sure how that's gonna yo but uh and also I I had another testimony for for brother Jim you know got so I said that before I said God can work through us all you know this week or this week God lay something on brother Jim's heart and he said it you know it wasn't Divine and it wasn't like spoken out of the hour and it wasn't but it said it was just something that was there and it kind of wanted to go away so he obeyed it and did it and the person that was the repercussion of him obeying said we never had one crumb once back of food in our house God just randomly looked over the body of Christ and just said the person that got it or we had one Speck of food he said boy God sure knows what he's doing that person I didn't know I didn't know like God knew but God and see God just chose God just went this one this man of God will use tomorrow could be this little man of God this little man of God see because we're all man of God amen amen that's beautiful amen let's just sing this song Sorry to hold the amen that we'll sing this and the kids and then brother Jim will just come brother Jim would come and we just uh I'm just enjoy brother Jim and and you know brother Jim's part of us even though he's not here it's not by choice amen and so he's actually got somebody to watch sister Linda this morning remember Sister Linda Delgado heal her completely amen for the glory of God Amen however God chooses you know see we can have the greatest thing is to try not to have an agenda in our minds so I had an agenda brother Jr would preach and you know I I study every week I'd study Thursday you know and so then I thought well then I'm going to minister but see God was working maybe on a different end for the gym amen just help us to be receptive to to whatever that does Amen so let's just sing this song pleasing is brother Felix leads us and then brother Jim will come and Minister and sister Leah leads us [Music] [Music] praying let everything else [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] just a moment talk about weird things happening as to me is uh it's just weird that's all I knew that brother Jr was going to preach this morning yes yesterday so I I didn't study and usually the Lord lets me know way ahead of time when he wants me to do it and I'm going to preach okay and he has to tell me there but this time nothing yesterday I went about my business doing what I was doing and then uh and even this morning I when I woke up and brother Dale calls me says oh bro junior is not going to preach that's this huh okay 1 30 in the morning and this happened before more than once but 1 30 in the morning I woke up I had to go to washroom come back today usually I fall asleep right away I could not sleep I was I preached to myself I preached my sermon if you had been there yeah you would have had a good good time uh three o'clock in the morning and still you know still awake so it was kind of if I I can't remember everything that I was you know preaching in my bed and but it was a mixture of two sermons one the one I'm gonna do this morning and then there was another one that I never did preach that the lord gave me before you went to uh Uganda uh has to be with the seed of God and it's uh it's a it's just say in so many words it's powerful message uh when you hear it uh Lord willing El bless you amen now I'm going to say I'm just gonna go sing a song down and oh my soul so weary we're in trouble's come come and my heart's burden be that I am still and wait here in the silence until you come and say the wild with me you know Sing With Me You Raise Me Up up so I can stand on mountains You Raise Me Up to walk on stormy sea I am strong when I am on your shoulders You Raise Me Up to more than I can be there is no life no life without its hunger yes Lord he's Restless Heart be so imperfectly bug when you come and I am filled with wonder [Music] sometimes I think I glance eternity oh yes Lord You Raise Me Up so I can't stand on mountains You Raise Me Up to walk on stormy sea I am strong when I am on your shoulder there's You Raise Me Up after more than I can be You Raise Me Up to more than I can be amen you know you've heard the expression the Lord worsen mysterious ways well he does oh praise the Lord in another way that's good I'm glad he works in serious ways and he reveals the Mysteries to babes such as would learn amen praise the Lord as I was saying uh it's I don't know the way sometimes it works God knows everything he's in control and this morning you know I had my papers in my hand and I was after I talked to brother Dale so I said okay and I was going over my notes uh sermon that I preached in Uganda as a matter of fact and uh so I set him on the table and guess where they are they're on the table at home so I get to church and I look in my bag and oh no notes okay so I have to go from memory sure enough that's okay I called anyway I called the house there was somebody there so I got a little bit here but talk about shooting from the hip yeah well that's the way it goes I can remember it wasn't that long ago I had a sermon pre I had my notes everything I remember this and I couldn't get this out of my mind the love of God and it wasn't about the love of God I was going to preach and I couldn't get it on my mind I didn't have any notes and it was from the hip and I think the Lord is teaching me something brother Dale to rely not so much on my notes but rely on him you know that's that's what I'm getting from this amen so we'll see how it goes amen amen if this goes as good as when I preach it to myself you'll be you'll be blessed uh God you know brother bran says that God has a sense of humor doesn't he so I I look at it this way yeah I chuckle you know with you amen let's all stand first John I want to read some scriptures first John first uh first John first chapter verses five to seven and it goes like this then this this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and we do not we and do not the truth but if we walk in the light that he is in the light we have Fellowship one way to another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin the gospel go to the Gospel of John the 12th chapter and one verse 46. I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if you go to John the same the same gospel John first chapter verse 4. in him was life and the light and the life was the light of men Lord had the blessing to the reading of his word bless the bow our heads for a moment if you will Heavenly Father oh Lord God we thank you Lord for your grace for your mercy Lord here we are assembled together Lord God not by chance Lord but Lord you have called to call the assembly the assembling of your your people Lord this morning Father Lord the call has gone forth and here the people has assembled themselves to hear from you Lord oh God may you just manifest yourself to them Lord by the word being spoken being preached Lord by your presence Lord and Lord meet every need that's Among Us Lord God remember each and every one oh Lord remember brother Jr or his family and Lord the Saints there all over the world you live bride father remember each and everyone we pray Jesus name we ask amen you may be seated I preached this sermon in Uganda Saturday morning and uh hey what's good it was good still good the word of God doesn't change you can you can read a scripture you can read a verse today and five years from now who knows how long you can still read it and get something out of it it's fresh it's always fresh it never goes stale Jesus says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away what a thing we can rely on is the word of God now if you look in the scripture now I'm going to be preaching on the light okay the light of God the light uh let's see one four in him was life and the life was the light of man now when we think about the light we look at that we say that's light or the sunshine but when you read the scripture where it says God is light okay that doesn't mean that he he's got a light bulb for you that's not what it means that means that the light is something when you turn the light in a dark room what does it do reveal what's in the room so so this here is the light of the world meaning he is the revelation of the world something that's revealed personally to you now it's not just the Revelation but the life that comes with it that's why he says here in him was life and the life was the light of men so everything all life comes from God okay all life comes from God nature itself shows you everything comes from God now there was another message that uh the the seed of God one thing about God is all life being come from God but everything has a beginning except God accept God God's always been and always will be no beginning no end but we have a beginning Nature has a beginning now where is that where where is the beginning where does that take us okay everything comes from a seed if you look at nature even us we started as a seed like when I was born I wasn't born like this no I was like very minute probably probably I don't know you might see it through a a microscope or something but everything and you look at nature it's the same thing everything comes from a seed and had there's the beginning of you and I and the world for that matter see when God spoke he said let there be did it happen like that no No it didn't but it started why how did it start when he spoke it it had to be Brothers says that every thought of God is a perfect thought he doesn't have a second thought like we do or a third thought so every thought is perfect so when he spoke it that's it now how long did it take they see you know the question about okay the Earth is millions or billions of years old okay and so they questioned the Bible how's that well brother Brian explained it in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth period how long did it did it take millions of years but once it's spoken it has to come to pass but it starts what the spoken word spoke it there it was but it started as a seed now I can only imagine the cree when he's there God is there and he speaks it and he has his thoughts everything that he wants to do you know I was thinking this morning how how did God think all these things you know and what did he see he saw the future saw the pastor saw the present Jesus said I do what my I see my father do like whatever he does that's what I do so he was led Jesus was led by vision now we don't have a vision we have the word see we have the word now we don't have but God saw everything like if I can say this way in a vision form he saw everything the whole Bible the whole Bible the word of God one time was in the thought of God so you take from Genesis to revelation God saw it all in Vision form I believe that so being that he saw in vision for him he says okay this is going to be and this you know and he could see everything transforming right before him in Vision form so he saw at the beginning he saw everything that would come step by step now one thing about God's word it doesn't stand still it moves we have to walk in the light and he is in the light and when that light moves we got to move with the light otherwise we're going to be left behind that's what's happened with denominations denominations what to happen is they receive part of the word part of the word and they stop right there they didn't want to move on but God moves on you see the statue of a perfect man down below its Faith well did God stop there no he moves up and up and up we have to move up and up and up in by Revelation with Revelation it takes us to a higher calling and that's the only way without Revelation you're lost because Brethren says faith faith is revelation and without faith impossible to please God so God Reveals His word to whomsoever he will now God moves God moves in his word and you see it in you see it where just you start where he was restoring his word back in its in in fullness and he did a true Luther Wesley and so on but here you look at justification when the word of God came to Luther he preached justification that's part of the word that's not the full word so God what happened is man took that and says okay we got the word so they stop what happened they died they died spiritually they died so God moves in his word now so justification made way for sanctification Wesley comes on the scene he preached sanctification God still moves on you have today you have denominations out there you have the lutherans and the and Pentecostal for that matter and everything what happened to them how come they're not walking in the light today because they stop moving you've got to move by Revelation you gotta when you read the word of God okay so you get something today what about tomorrow tomorrow has got to be greater than what you read today see God revealing his word to you to bring you up to a place revealing his word so that you can receive from him what he wants you to have in the days of Luther justification that's what God was giving to the to the people justification that's all they could take at the time now when God kept moving he came Wesley came on the scene and he preached sanctification so you don't do away with justification you take it with you it's always there it's always there the word doesn't change so you have just so if you come that way so you're Justified and then you come sanctification you're Sanctified now we don't do away with justification no no no no we it's like uh you know you're carrying your backpack if you want to look at it that way so you take it with you wherever you go so God moves now it came to Restoration of the gifts and when he did when he came to Restoration of the guess what what happened there the same thing that happened with the after Luther died and Wesley died they denominated they stopped right there they died did God stop there no no so where where are we going see if you think about it okay you heard Jesus says I come I come from God I go to God now that's quite a statement can we see that can we see that truthfully by Revelation can we say that I can't I come from God I go to God yes we can yes we can you see God see the word moving now he's moved now to justification sanctification restoration of the gifts but God didn't stop there brother Branham I don't have the quote here which I did but I don't have the quote where he says that God works through justification sanctification restoration of the gift the word the word that wasn't see without the word which is the full manifestation of the word justification sanctification restoration restoration of the gifts was not the full restoration God is restoring his word to its fullness so he's got to take you what the full word not part of it because when you stop you die God moves so where is he taking us to the full word full manifestation the manifestations of the sons of God he's taking us to a full manifestation see without justification certification resource share of the gift will not perf bring you us to perfection they won't so I asked to go what to the full manifestation of the word now when when I say that the full manifestation of the word is the fullness of God's power in demonstration here on Earth by his bride Brotherhood says the bride will have the word or she'll be quiet what did he mean the word we have the word but yeah no she don't have the fullness of the word or she'll be quiet so God's working through uh his word working through his bride and and we're a recipient being Children of the Living God were recipient of God's word because Brotherhood says he says the Bible was written for the believer for his children now we know there's three kinds of Believers in every Church we have a Believer the make-believer the unbeliever the unbeliever he'll come one service he's gone the make-believer can stick around for months or a few years even and what do you do well cause troubles but eventually he'll leave you see God the word of God the word of God separates we don't stand here in the pulpit and say you know you're you're not you're not you're you're with us but you're not of us as the scripture says so be gone no no we don't do that we just please we just lay the word out see Jesus never never fuss with the priests of his day what did he do he just spoke the word except you eat my flesh drink my blood you have no life that's it he says you know he was talking about a spiritual part not the flesh not the body it's fruit but they didn't understand so they thought well this is a hard saying who can receive it so they left see but all he did was lay the word there and it just they they scattered he left you know one thing about when you look at the scripture it says that many are called but few were chosen so many are called to the wedding supper I'll say that way many are called but the few are chosen now what happened we had Jesus had there's a parable there where Jesus spoke about there was this man uh I don't know exactly where it is but and he had land and he had you know money and everything else and he wanted to he wanted he wanted he had a feast and he want people to come and enjoy them and they all make excuses they all make excuses many are called so what he did was he says now he said my servants he says go into the highways and virus and compel the lame the blind the halt to come compel compel chose compel when Jesus came on the scene he says follow me follow me follow me compel compel see so many are called but few are chosen so those that are chosen are the ones they're not going to receive it Jesus said Jesus said he said be ye perfect that's my father is perfect now can you be perfect and just with but just justification sanctification baptism or the restoration of the guests no you can't be perfect you got to have the whole word you got all of it see to come to come as far as the guest and stop there in the Pentecostal church that's what happened brother and says they died when they denominated they stopped so we have to come to the fullness of the word now that's a you know you when you think about it the fullness of the word what's that well that's all the word but what exactly is it the fullness of the word Jesus when he was here on Earth he was a full manifestation of God the fullness of the godhead was in okay he was the full manifestation of God okay now Jesus is in spirit form now here he's in spirit in spirit form but he still wants to fulfill his word he wants that fullness of the mess we have to come to that place of perfection where the fullness of the manifestation of God Is In You and I and what what what the word will do that but we've got to go where the light is going step by step stay in the light stay in the light because that's where the life is and where where he leads I will follow amen so we so we have to stay in the light as he is in the light and we have fellowship with him in the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin so it has it's a personal walk it's a personal walk now I'm leading I'm going somewhere it's okay I'm not just going throwing all I'm going somewhere it's okay stay with me all right now we've gone through justification sanctification restoration of the gift now we come to the word the manifestations of the sons of God is not it's a life lived the fullness manifestation of the word of God in the individual you are a son of God okay so you have in you power we have a new power to create worlds and to go and live on it if if it be the will of God verbum said that that it is in the Bride of Jesus Christ in the in in the children of God we have it now I don't have power this body doesn't have power but the one that's in US Jesus says he says all power is given to me vote in heaven and earth now if Jesus is in you then what's in you power he says he gives he gives uh if I can I don't know if I could yes but it's received him to then give he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name so he gave you power to become sons of God meaning you have in you you're the same your word is as good as God so where are where are we going okay where to think about it you know you we live we live our day we live every day we have things that we do and we go about our business and everything else but the way I see it now is that God is leading us to something greater than saying just saying oh I'm a Christian I go to church that's all good but where where is he where is God taking us remember the word moves so where is God taking us so he's taking us to a higher level now if you look at the Statue of a perfect man the right on top is love perfect love agape love that's God God himself okay it's not just saying it's the love of God and you know no it's God himself so let me say this God himself what's the Manifest his word through you in its fullness so what does that make you Sons and Daughters of God when we realize Who We Are when we come to the full revelation of who we are that we are sons of God Daughters of God we will say this is we will speak the word you know I was thinking this morning brother Dale when I was oh man it was good and uh we have to come to a place where we'll speak the word now right now right now if somebody is uh is say it's sick or something like that they come we pray we pray for them you got to speak it you just can't think it so we pray Lee hands Bible says correct okay and God is obligated to his word not to us but to his word so he'll do it he'll heal okay now we we it has to be spoken but I can see today where you as a Son of God a daughter of God you are not well you can speak to that speak to that say cancer and be gone that's it be gone okay that's the full manifestations of the sons of God we we have to the Bible says we will Nature's groaning for the manifestations of the sons of God where where where where where uh uh we will take our position on Earth and we'll speak it and it'll be done it'll be done now I you know you say you know Bible says ask not receive not so you got to speak it and I and I believe this that when we come to that place something will bother you all you'll have to do is speak it now I take it from the what the prophet said now I don't have my quotes here I wish I did but I don't but it's in the message Look Away to Jesus in 63. where he talks about the third pole now the third poll is not a mystery you know he had Brothers had the first poll second pole in his ministry and the third Pope but he says he in the third poll he talks about it here let me read something I did highlight I'm glad for a highlighter otherwise I would have my notes with me but uh my so hot you know it's like uh don't be satisfied with the status quo where you're at now because God has got Treasures beyond your imagination yet to come he says he says here and Look Away to Jesus in 63 he says now so now I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and there it and that is the thing that we have looked forward for to for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pole has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's he says now it's in existence and I and I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it as it as it could and defies presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until the council uh begins to tighten up and what it does when that does the Pentecostal Fork can almost impersonate anything they can but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what what you've seen temporarily the manifested in the form of of his power now if you remember the the third poll he talks about it in here in the message here he talks about sister Addie says the storm uh the squirrels he he doesn't mention the fish but the fish was that had to do with it and and uh his wife now one thing that struck me when I was reading this is that he didn't ask he didn't say in the name of Jesus no no he just said it because God told him say it now he says what what you what you see temporarily you'll see in his fullness when the squeeze come when the pressure comes now here he says uh let me read a little bit here well one thing he says he says this this will be the thing that is to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing Fate for the going away see he says it's tightening and when that time comes and when she when the Press comes to a place to wear your Presto then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pole then it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church now we can argue the point or we can believe it or not believe it but if Prophet has spoken it foreign and if we believe that it came from God then it has to come to pass now the third when it comes to the third poll he doesn't talk too much about it because the angel warned him don't say nothing about it so we don't say nothing we don't it's the same with us we don't say very much about it we just leave it alone God will bring it to pass what was it it was a manifestation of the sons of God brother brought him he came to a point he said I am not the son of Charles and edible I am a son of God now who told them who told him he's the son of God God told them I had something I'll share with you this okay there was a prophecy in our church in in Wellsburg and I was doing I was song leading at the time and I remember it was during the song service and I'm trying to remember the name there was a sister in the church she prophesied uh Judith Judith Downs she prophesied and what she said was the truth she said and and I was standing up I was leading the in in the worship service and she said she didn't know what was going on what the devil how the devil was attacking me but she but she said she no this is or words Satan he's not your son he's my son and she said your son no it wasn't her it was God God said your son that is not your son I will save and she said other things besides that okay now that see at that time God this the devil was on my tail on my back trying to get me to think that had his son not God's son she didn't see God spoke now son that is not your son that's my oldest son he's not mine he's my wife's but he's not mine so it was true and so what it is what I'm trying to say is this when we come to a full and it has to be by Revelation when we come to the full revelation of Who We Are we will speak it we will say it I believe before the change of the body because that's when we that's when we need it this happened what the third poll what Brethren talked about in that message Look Away to Jesus it happened here see before his debt had happened here on Earth the fish the squirrels sister Addie the storm his wife all had a significance in that it it displays the attributes of God healing savior controlling nature Resurrection so all those things are gonna they have to come to pass and one day one day one day the day will come when you have such a revelation will hit you and you'll say my it's like you know brother Brown had those experiences where God would come in the room like he talks about it it will just take him from you know throw him across the room but such a powerful Revelation I had an experience that and years ago in in the church in Chatham and I've never experienced anything before or after like that it's presence where he spoke to me and I shared with the church already so but if in case you you don't remember anyway I was sitting in the back it was the end of the service brother draws at just dismissed the people he was walking away and the presence came on me like I never felt before I could not move I could not think uh it was a humbling experience I could not jump I could not do anything and the Lord spoke to me to sanctify yourself if there's a word for you to do later I've never felt and I've felt many times the the the anointing as a song leader I felt many times but that anointing was totally different totally totally different so yeah but Brothers had those experience but the thing is what I'm trying to say is we have to keep that connection I'll say this way we've got to keep that connection with God because one day one day that word the full month the manifestations of the sons of God it has to come to pass it's his word as long as we stay in the light as he is in the light we walk with him day by day by day by day by day that's where that's where life is without the Sun the natural Sun there'd be no life that's a natural what about the spiritual without the Son of God the spiritual there'd be no life there's a lot of if I can say this way there's a lot of dead people walking around they don't know it but but see the gospel has come to you and I we have received it we have it it's ours it's yours this word of God this word it's yours it's yours what do you do what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with the word you say well I'll believe it but yet that's a good start act upon it you've heard you've heard the pre you've heard it preached and brother Brent says you got to see yourself healed in your mind you ask for healing you act upon it the word of God the word says that you are a son of God act upon it we're so afraid that it won't happen we are I I know I know like you know he has a need see my young little brother he has an e okay and I'm afraid to I'll go and lay hands and say oh Lord you know in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what would stop me from saying that not thus say the Lord the word of God says receive it it's done it's done foreign God spoke it he created the world by the spoken word we are Sons and Daughters of God we have the authority to use the power that lives in us to speak it and I believe with all my heart I believe that one day we'll see that we'll see that manifestation there'll be you will you'll feel that little headache come on you or something like that and you'll say God's word says and and headache leave that's it protobram talked about there will come a time where diseases on the Earth they'll come to Jesus on the Earth but it will never touch you won't touch you any all those that have the spirit of God born again he said it will not affect you he said it that day is coming that Day's coming so what have we got to look forward to be you know Jesus says again Jesus says Be Your perfectness my father is perfect he is perfect in every way now mind you we're in this flesh mind you wouldn't miss flesh but he says be ye perfect as my father is perfect what He was Jesus walking on Earth fullness of the godhead now he's in his bride many member bride but the power program says a spoonful of the ocean is all you need you got the ocean so if I have don't know if I have the ocean and a spoonful that means I have the full word that has others I have access access to the full word so what are my needs am I sick I have access to the full word so if I have access to the full word he says by your stripes I'm Healed that's mine that's mine my God shall supply all my knees according to his riches and Glory that's mine that is yours every word of God is yours all you have to do is act upon it it's mine it's mine receive it take it see it's a personal walk it's you and Jesus it's you and the Holy Spirit walking living do you feel like it do you feel it no it's not a Feeling it's not a feeling if God revealing himself to you in his fullness that's it personally so he wants to bring you to a level you walk with him as he is in the light he wants to take you by Revelation to a place where God has seen you before the the foundation of the world he's seen you in their perfection and God has seen you in a vision maybe let's say before the foundation of the world before he created anything he's seen you in Perfection so guess what you're going to be perfect one day whether you like it or not amen because God has chosen you Jesus says to the disciples you didn't choose me I chose you amen amen oh my so don't be satisfied with the status quo where you're at Press On God is moving in his word and he's taking his bride along with it to a higher plane to a higher level don't be satisfied with the way it is keep looking up keep and and follow as the light is moving you move with the light so that's what revelation every day is a little bit here a little bit there weird upon word line upon line a little bit bite a little bit at a time my wife the Lord told me or she started getting better because he was at one point she was she wasn't moving she wasn't talking hardly eating anything you get three Spoonful down you're lucky that's where she was she lost she had lost quite a bit of weight and the Lord told me says I will heal her a little at a time that's what healing is a little at a time how long it's going to take Abraham had to wait what 25 years for the promised son well I don't think I will have to wait 25 years but since then the Lord told me this she has progressed better and better and better and you know some of you are witnesses to it so God's word will come to pass and guess what if that word is in you then you will come to pass you have no choice you have no choice you didn't choose this gospel you didn't choose God God chose you because if we try to choose well let's face it if we try to choose God we'd run away from him we did I did for years until you came on the scene and you let me know you know praise the Lord so the word the word as I said you know just here I'm going to finish probably with this it has to be spoken but it starts from a seed and then when you go in the Bible you look at it where God created the heavens he already created everything 6 000 years there one thought you know every every thousand years he created a different thing but it had he spoke it now did it happen no it didn't happen right away but it happened it did come to pass so you think about it when things that the prophet said that's yet to come don't look at the world don't look at things out there what's going on no no no no God is that doesn't bother God so it shouldn't bother us you shouldn't bother us the things that are happening out there in the world in the natural the wars and all this don't don't let it shake Jesus says you'll hear of Wars rumors and Wars but the end is not yet that's not a sign in other words that's not a sign that it's the end that's not a sign so they'll look at those things no no keep your eyes on the promises of God's word keep your eyes on that amen it's like you meditate you meditate on what the the the the positive you you want to what's positive you want to meditate on the word outside of that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away so that's your that's your uh your anchor that's your ankle amen praise the lord well that's all I got to say praise the Lord I don't have my nose but hopefully the Lord Lord will bless you amen praise God let's all stand one thing about God's word maybe our last thought he doesn't ask you what you think God doesn't ask you what you think no he doesn't ask you he tells you what you should think yeah he does that's why he's trying to tell you there's something coming because the word I said it has to come to pass manifestation is the sons of God has to come to pass and you are part of it then guess what there's more coming more blessings come a time we'll have the change in the body otherwise if we go in the grave of course he often is waiting for us otherwise a chain will have there'll be Resurrection those that remain will be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air it just it just it kind of boggles my mind because God has not given us a full revelation of just that the body chain he hasn't because if you did you you'd be gone you won't stay here you disappear be gone that's it oh yeah so we don't we haven't received it yet so we haven't attained that that top there the love we haven't got that far the Holy Spirit yes brother and kindness yes but we haven't come to that point but we're get we're going there so don't stop well Don't Stop Believing but see Faith come what bye by the word hearing by the word of God so faith is what keeps us going Revelation and God revealing himself let's Spar our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you Lord For Your Precious word I thank you Lord for helping me this morning Lord God to bring your word Lord with no notes in that thank you Lord Lord bless your people Lord God and there's this take us to a higher calling a higher Revelation according to your word Lord God take us there Lord to a place where you want us to be to go Lord in Revelation in the spiritual and Lord one day we know as your word says we'll step from this body this world and tipped into a completely Perfection eternity Lord O Lord God we're looking for that in Jesus name we pray amen amen well sister I don't have a song here but you do just [Music] our Lord is gone turning for you and you and me oh I've been watching and I've been waiting waiting just any day now his breath I'll see let's sing it again [Music] Saturday dinner [Music] each time I stop and take the time to look around me I see the signs of his appearing [Music] everywhere nothing says [Music] [Music] my love is coming foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I gladly lay Behind these troubles [Music] [Applause] my nice time [Music] and I've been waiting just any day now these places Hallelujah just any day now amen it's beautiful words that brother Jim brought amen hallelujah it was just a he was just touching what Lord willing will Minister next week amen you know in our Christian walk moving is believing moving is trusting amen you are not sitting still in your Christian rock you're either getting worse or better if you think you're sitting still you're declining you're declining there's no such thing as sitting still we're moving in Christ and my goodness my mind was just as brother Jim was wrote that where the where the Prophet said that we had to take the authority that he's given to us it's time to take the authority and speak it and go forward speak it and go forward you don't have to pray about if it's God's will for healing God already give it to you it's pain in full it's so easy for us to believe in our salvation but we don't think God could heal us he could save us but he probably couldn't heal my knee my that's that was just beautiful amen next Sunday we want to look into people that refuse to move forward and people that did you're either getting better or worse in Christ Jesus amen and we're so close to the end man let's not stop just right before the the new body and the Rapture my goodness God help us Lord Jesus it's just been a pleasure to to feed on your word this morning as you anointed our brother Jim and his and he's as he was in the the stream of the anointing Lord Jesus is what you've been and gonna Minister Lord Jesus and what we've been feasting on Lord Jesus and Lord Jesus we pray that you'll make us doers of the word not just hears but doers walking in the faith that we say we believe live me a testimony walking Epistles red of all men Lord Jesus bless our brother Jim and it just says he surrendered his heart to you Lord Jesus and how you let him Lord Jesus was beautiful this morning be with our your bride of Christ that's assembled this morning may you be bless and meet every single need Lord Jesus is our prayer
