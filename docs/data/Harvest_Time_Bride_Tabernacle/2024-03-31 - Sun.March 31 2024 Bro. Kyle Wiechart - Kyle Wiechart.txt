an angel came down from heaven and rolled aside the St from the entrance of the Tomb very early on Sunday morning some woman went to the tomb and they found it empty Jesus wasn't there they didn't know what had happened so an angel came to them saying do not be afraid go they go quickly and tell his disciples that Jesus is Alive and he will meet them soon the woman ran quickly from the tomb with great joy and excitement as they went Jesus met them and greeted them on their way Jesus met them the woman ran to Jesus and worshiped him he was alive then some of the dis the Jesus said do not be afraid go tell the disciples I will need them soon the woman shared the good news with the disciples but the story sounded like nonsense to them so they didn't believe it then some of the disciples ran to the tomb to see if this was true and they found an empty tomb just like the woman had said that same day two of Jesus's followers were walking to EMAs as they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened to Jesus and as they talked Jesus himself suddenly came and began with them but they did not recognize him when they arrived they sat down to eat when Jesus Took the bread and blessed it they they recognized him but at that moment Jesus disappeared these men went to the other disciples and told them what had happened and just as they were telling about it Jesus

song we all know it's very simple I love him I love him I love him because deeper love [Music] me Sal [Music] on now this time just your voices please I love him [Music] I love [Music] me [Music] and just my [Music] Sal on C tree amen thank you musicians I sure appreciate that well if you don't know who I am my name is Kyle Wert I live down in the states little little farther south from here down in Ohio and I'm happy to have my wife and two little girls well one little one's getting kind of big yeah she's growing pretty fast but uh there're still little girls to me always and so I'm really happy to have them with me sometimes they don't get the opportunity to go with me and uh I was happy happy that they can be here and so always makes me feel good and uh just wanted to say I sure appreciate for the Carson Shan for hosting me last night they fed me like a king so if I'm a little lethargic today it's because my body is still digesting all the food from last night so I really appreciated your hospitality in the food and brother Dale and his wife got chance to have our first time of fellowshipping last night and I found him to be just a genuinely sweet loving brother instantly like he said you know witness with one another that we came from God we came from God and we're just sojourning in a land that's not our home remember I'm not an American so you don't have anything against me uh we're from the same place it's called heaven and um I know you don't identify as Canadians I hope not uh not much to be proud about um I'm not knocking it because we got it way worse down in America so nothing to be proud of as American but what we got sure something to be proud of and that's a heavenly father and a kingdom that we came from and we're going back to really soon and so now on we're we're on this Earthly Journey we're learning to be like him uh this journey was never intended to be easy uh sometimes people get depressed they get down they get discouraged because life doesn't always go the way they think it was going to go but I promise you it's going just the way that God intended it to go because he's more interested in your character than he is in your comfort and we as Christians don't live this life for Comfort we live this life to be conformed into the image of his dear son that is the purpose of Us coming today that is what we are standing here representing this day on this Easter day this Resurrection Day we're not testifying as other churches that there was a resurrection 2,000 years ago we are standing as living Epistles expressed attributes of his glory testifying that that was a great Resurrection but this Resurrection is a greater Resurrection to be called out of dead denominations to be quickened into Christ Jesus conformed into the image of his dear son not a pressure not to be uh you have to live this kind of life not people saying don't do this and don't do that no something from the inside expressing Lord I love you I want to be more like you change me change me from the inside out that's how a dove cleans itself and that's how these doves clean themselves it's the only bird that puts off an oil from the inside pushes all the worldly desires away from you you just don't want them no more and I can be one of those living testimonies I am not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but by God's grace I am not what I used to be he's been pushing off a lot of things and desires I once had I don't have no more because there's something of greater value on the inside now and so it's just uh we just like to get together and talk about him you know brother bandam he says if you want to see angels and if you want God to draw close to you he says keep him on your mind all the time talk about him talk about how good he is how sweet he is don't talk about all the problems believe me if you got some looking for something to criticize you'll find plenty to criticize and you know what God will give you plenty to criticize but if you come looking for God you'll find him I promise you find him he hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself just the same way and so we're just honored to be here I I sure have you have a beautiful church building I want to congratulate you on such a nice building I see you're doing some construction work here going to be an awesome window and I'm sure it's going to be beautiful on the outside but brother Benham said the true beauty of a church is the character of its people and so as it's getting better on the outside I'm praying for you that all just that character of Christ that beauty starts to overflow in each of your lives more and more every day and so uh give my greetings from my pastor brother Chad Lamb he uh he's just he was in Australia for uh two weeks traveling preaching and uh he just got back home so I haven't had a chance to shake his hand and say hello to him yet um but uh but we're at our we're doing what we we're about our father's business you know we'd like to we want to just do what he's called us to do in this life and so I uh I like to just go over over my announcements they always make me nervous I'd rather go to the word but nonetheless I think that's about all I wanted to say Well when it comes to announcements so brother Dale said uh you know I take my time I can take my time and I have kind of a rule uh my rule is however long it takes me to travel to your church is about how long I allow I think you would allow me to preach and so it took me three hours and 15 minutes okay brother Dale said so so don't be upset at me you're a pastor you take it up with him schedule counseling so God bless you I I do have a subject that's been on my heart for quite some time uh I have to honestly say it was something that the Lord placed on my heart about a year and a half ago and uh it's something that I been laboring in and studying on my own uh for quite a bit I have now preached seven parts of this back home and I'm going to preach it all in one today I'm going to condense it down um because I think it's a vital message for the hour in which I think it brings things into perspective I think it helps us to understand why we're going through some of the things that we're going through question marks we might have I think will be answered uh as we start to see what this great hour is that we're living in and what great goal God had um sometimes we we we take it too lightly we take these things too light lightly these things become too common to us but you sometimes don't realize to what great effort God has went to to redeem his sons and daughters and bring them back into fellowship with him and so I hope it's okay we'll just take some time and we'll go through the scriptures together and we'll see where the word takes us how the leading of the Lord but always keep in your mind I leave my notes often times um because I do know and I I always want to be yielded to follow the leading of the Lord and so I do know if you have a need in your heart all you have to do is keep it before the Lord and the Holy Spirit can guide me off my notes and speak directly to whatever need you have uh that's that's our God he he's he's a risen savior he's he's not a Creed not a theology not just some story we've all heard he's a living God dwelling in the presence of his people comes to simple Humble Hearts he's still there's no Beauty we should be hold him there's no Beauty it's still so simple so comp so humble that the wise and great of this world look over past and say a there's nothing to it but it's the same Lord Jesus Discerning the thoughts and the intents of our hearts and speaking to each of our needs so you just pull and we'll see how the Lord leads I'd like you to turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapters 2 verse 4 now back home I'm also the youth leader so we got about 50 kids in our youth and uh I've got kids and so it's made me over the years become very conscientious to use plainness of speech um but the Carson's noticed that over the years and I do that on purpose um because what good is it for our young people to give them slogans or pump them up with emotion if they don't understand what you're talking about and they don't know how to overcome the devil and his tactics what are we doing this for and so you have to have a place to stand the prophet of God said man's faith cannot stand on the shifting Sands of a man's idea he says it needs the solid Bedrock of God's word so a Young Person's faith can only rest in the word of God and I believe it's the duty of every minister to make sure that he preaches a message that even the young people can get something from it and we know that this is a pattern throughout scripture that even God takes Great Mighty wise men and breaks them down into such Simplicity that God can finally use them Moses wasn't in the right kind of shape with his strength and his wisdom and all he knew and he was powerful man but he was in no condition to do God's work and then when he could strip that all away from Moses now he said now I got a man that'll do just what I want him to do say just what I want him to say and he'll be quiet when I I say be quiet Moses and you'll speak when I say speak Moses and that's the kind of men we want to be and that's the kind of Epistles living Epistles we want to be so you just stay with me in my plainness so First Corinthians chapters 2 verse4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect that means fully matured yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they Ann it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory now Romans 8:14 Romans 8:14 just say Amen when you're there the word of God reads for as men many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage against to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then hirs Hees of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of the body will you just bow your heads for a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we thank you for the opportunity Lord that by your grace you'd watch over us Lord that you would draw us to a place that's been set aside and Sanctified Lord for the preaching of your word I pray Lord that you'd sanctify my mind sanctify by my lips Lord I can do nothing without you so father God I pray that you would anoint me say just what you want said you know the needs of your children father I pray that you'd meet their needs I pray Lord that an atmosphere of Faith would be created so that all things are possible to him that believeth father God break the word now and open our eyes we pray in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated everyone do you mind if I take off my jacket is that okay here all right God bless you thank you so I'd like to title this thought the groaning Pains of adoption not the growing pains but the groaning Pains of adoption um the subject of adoption has has been quite heavy for me for quite some time this last year and I've heard many people say different thoughts about adoption um and many people have interpreted in many ways and I myself just felt burned Within Myself to look for myself what is adoption all about uh because I believe this message is more than God sent a prophet uh way more you know they uh Moses was the prophet that came to Egypt thousands of years years ago and 2 million people recognized that prophet in that day and they believed he was a true prophet of God with a true message of God for deliverance but how many of them went to the promised land very few they could not enter in because of their unbelief uh there was only found to be Joshua and Caleb that had a different Spirit within them they never doubted God they would go wherever he led and we find today that we are in a Third Exodus and our Exodus did not just consent cons uh uh consist of a coming out brother bam said there's two parts of an exodus there's a coming out and a going in and so many of us uh that have maybe been raised see I was not raised in the message so I haven't been uh maybe told now you believe it this way and it was said this way and do it this way for me I always felt I was one born out of season so I got to go look for myself what did the prophet of God say what does the word of God say I want for myself what is this predestinated unto the adoption of son what am I predestinated to what is God bringing me to because I can't do it in myself but I am predestinated to be conformed into the image of his dear son I'm predestinated unto the adoption of a son and it's a very clear process for us but I also see that it's a great Temptation in this hour to just get comfortable and if things aren't comfortable leave uh and I want to remind you what the scripture said about adoption and if children then heirs verse 17 of Romans 8 join HS with Christ if so that we suffer with him so there is no adoption without suffering everyone and we find today that be people are becoming so soft they don't want pain they don't want difficulty they don't want struggle they don't want conflict they don't want anybody rubbing them the wrong way or uh poking them in a weak spot so they just leave they don't go to church no more they don't have Fellowship no more they abide by themselves we have a message and we have a prophet I'm going to sit at home and you don't realize you're not going to be able to come to Perfection a five-fold Ministry was given for the perfecting of the Saints and there is no perfection without suffering and good news for you if you're a part of a people there will be suffering [Laughter] because none of us are perfect are any of you perfect yet not yet you're only made perfect in the eyes of God because there's a shed blood there speaking for you but your best your righteousness is as filled you have nothing good you can put before him and say look I'm doing a pretty good job no we have a blood they're speaking greater things my righteousness filthy righteousness his righteousness a perfect righteousness that's imputed unto me by faith in his word and in the promises of his word but we find so many people don't want to come unto Perfection Perfection means maturity and maturity is painful when you have a child any of us that have children when that child is a baby do you ever spank a baby no not a baby that baby can do whatever it wants it can throw its bottle well maybe not throw bottle it can goooo Gaga you know spit up do everything you're not going to spank a baby who spanks a baby but you have everything for the baby too baby can't itself baby can't change itself baby can't put itself down for a nap you have to do everything for a baby because it's a baby but when a baby begins to mature now something happens in the maturing of a son and maturing of a daughter yeah if they do wrong little spanking now don't do that sis don't do that honey you're not supposed to do that if they throw their bottle and they're six years old told there's going to be some chastisement coming somewhere right and that's just the way it goes with maturing is also suffering pain comes with it because God is training up children and so many of us I think we thought well well God sent a prophet we believe the message and it's all done we're over let's go to the throne you're not fit for the throne because character is not a gift character is a victory you have to overcome yourself yourself you're your greatest enemy you have to overcome your own lust of Flesh and lust of the eyes and your own pride of life and there's not a one of us that doesn't have to overcome this is the Bible scripture and you'll fight every day of your life this old carnal nature and this old carnal flesh that gets enticed by this world and you have to beat it into subjection every day and bring your life subject to his will so that God can sit back someday and say he's not about his will he's about my will he's about the father's business he's not interested in his business anymore he's about the father's business and see I believe that God is raising up a mature bride a mature bride not an immature bride a mature bride now I'd like to take this from many Avenues if it's okay and we're going to start in the scriptures and we're going to go fast for a little bit and then we'll pause sometimes but I want you to see all of this in the scriptures in the message of the hour so again my title the groaning Pains of adoption and so Galatians 4:4 says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ something in your hearts burning I know I'm not what I ought to be but something yearning putting you before the word coming to church listening to the message because there's something inside you trying to grow come to maturity and it needs the good word of God and The Fellowship of the Saints to keep maturing in the Lord there's something groaning earnestly within you and so if we see in Colossians 1:26 even the mystery of God which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but is now made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory but we know that God is not going to come for an immature bride he's not he's not a grown man doesn't marry a six-year-old girl immaturity too immature God is going to unite himself with a fully matured bride and so we see we're now in Harvest time I believe this name of church is Harvest Time Church Harvest time now when it comes to Harvest Time everything's got to get ripe the sun's got to get intense and it's got to bake out all the greenness all the immaturity all the attitudes the selfishness the self-love in that seed in that life so it can be just like Christ she'll be so much like him she will be him you won't be able to tell the difference in their nature their attitude their speech their conduct you see this is what we are being transformed into by his grace and his Mercy do you recognize the High Calling of your life do you realize what you've been born to do you realize the mercy and grace of God to bring you a message that's going to bring you unto Perfection and to a fullness of Christ this is quite a high calling everyone this is something that cannot be taken lightly and we owe Our Lives to it so many people want to keep the message like close to them they want to keep the word oh it's a part of their life but it ain't their life you'll find yourself eventually where God's spirit will no longer strive with you he will not strive with you you're if you're a disobedient son year over year over year and he keeps wooing you and wooing you and wooing you and you never never listen to this tutor you never line up his Spirit won't always strive but if there's an inkling of a desire in your heart for God to be conformed Into His Image then praise God he hasn't given up on you because you can't desire if that deep is in their calling there's got to be a deeper of God available for you that's the reality of it we know this the Simplicity of it if there's something in your heart yearning for more of God there must be more of God available there must be and I'm finding Within Myself I'm groaning constantly I'm not what I want to be there L there's more for me Lord bring me up higher change me keep going Lord I I don't want to stop anywhere on the journey until I've come to my position as an adopted son now brother brandham said and what is the Holy Ghost given for now watch what God did when his son was born he let him go 30 years testing him trying him then he give him three years of hard trials and then at the end of the hard trial when he seen that his son was about the father's business he took him to mount Transfiguration in the Book of Luke he took Peter James and John three Witnesses and he went on top of a mountain and there God performed the laws of adoption he they looked up and they seen Jesus and his clothes shined as white as a lightning and a cloud overshadowed him and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear ye him him that's what he says now I'll sit down now I have no more else to say what he says will be the law and the truth you know God wants to take a rest he's waiting for you he's waiting for you to come to maturity so God can take a little bit of a break you're wearing him out he wants to be able to take a rest and has so much confidence in you that he'll say the right thing or he'll say nothing at all he'll speak when I say speak he'll be silent when I tell him to be silent that's what God's looking for in a mature son so he was caught up Jesus's adoption was on Mount Transfiguration after the trial now he received the baptism of Holy Spirit the Bible says that the spirit of God descended like a dove down there at the River Jordan there with this Prophet baptized him there and the spirit of God descended but he then had to go through some more trials some more test testings to see if he would be faithful to just be about the father's business before he could become an adopted son now in our modern language we don't understand adoption we use the word adoption incorrectly according to the Bible now a bi biblical adoption was on this place brother bham describes it in desperations and so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people and they began to restore back the gifts and things to the church they thought that they were born in the spirit and that settled it but you see there is a placing of a son and after this son proved to be a real son then he was taken to a public place there he was set up his robes were changed and he sat there and this is the placing of a son that he was now heir to everything that the father had God did the same thing for his son on Mount Transfiguration he changed he was transfigured in his rment shined as the sun this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased so we see a Biblical adoption was when a father would take his son now he would be a servant he though he was born a son he would be treated just like all the other servants in the home and he would be placed under a tutor and he would be tested and tried constantly to see how he would respond in this situation how he would handle this one talking bad about him how he would talk handle this situation and that situation how was he going to mature under the tutor would he listen to the tutor would he do his own thing or would he come subject to the leading of the tutor now the tutor had to come back and be able to give a good report your son is just like you he's just like you and when the father could hear he's just like you he responds just like you he would run the family business just like you then he says okay he's no longer going to be treated like a servant today I make him a son now he would take him to a public place before all the people and say this is my son I'm going on vacation he's going to run the family business from now on I can take my rest he's submitted finally his will to mine didn't change the fact that he was a son he was born a son but he was not treated any different than a servant until he could be tested tried and proved to be a real son then there's the placing of a son that's the adoption of the sons of God so we see that this must take place for each of us as Sons and Daughters of God so many people stopped when they got the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they thought I'm all done no more maturing for me I'm good I can kick back relax and do my own thing no you can't no you can't you don't understand what it's all about you you might have screamed you might have shouted you might have run up and down the altars you might have felt the blessings of God but if you're predestinated unto the adoption of sons you're going to find out that your will is not your own you will not be about your will you'll be about the father's will his business you're on this Earth to perform that's a true Son of God so many times we just want life easy we want to do our own thing and we want God to be like a Aaron boy for us brother bam said you never pray until you need him you have a financial need or a bad situation then you're like Lord help me solve my problems and we know that's not how we ought to pray the prophet of God told us we should be praying finding his will for our lives not praying to have God fulfill our will for our lives see the attitude the mentality of a true bride of Jesus Christ sometimes we want the benefits but we don't want to go through what's necessary to be it we don't want to surrender everyone so in Blasphemous names 1962 he says our family when a son is born it's a son but it's put under tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to be the right kind of a son then he will never be an heir but if he's the right son and a son that will obey his father then he will be an adopted son and positionally placed he will be an heir to all that the father has and that's what we want to be an heir to all that the father has now brother bam makes this comment and this is what really shook me he said now what's see what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration he took his own son up there you see he had been proven to be the right son for he was able to stand all the Temptations therefore he was taken up to mount Transfiguration and he was overshadowed brother bam there is where our Pentecost people made their mistake being born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor many people want the experiences of Pentecost they want the gifts of Pentecost the anointing of Pentecost but they don't want to go on to the full maturity that God requires Pentecost to to go from to you know brother Brenham said this he said you know the greatest robbery that ever took place in the history of man was caused by a false light yeah he said the greatest Train Robbery I think they shined a false light a train thought it was another train so he stopped on the tracks and they robbed the train because of this light he said you know the church's greatest robbery was caused by a false light he said the light of the previous age becomes the blinding light to the present light coming so Pentecost becomes a blinding light to where God is taking the Bride of Jesus Christ heavy statement that's what the prophet of God said and I'm going to say just what he said cuz we find there's a move back to Pentecost back to Pentecost I'm all for it let's go back to Pentecost but let's go back to what they were in heart and in mind brother brandham said not just the signs the Wonders the gifts the Miracles go back to where they could say for me to live as Christ and to die is gain that's what the brother brandham said was back to Pentecost where it's no longer your will but his will you're living for but people just want the anointing but they don't want to subject their will to the father's will proving I wonder what they're really looking for do they want the adoption of a son or do they want Pentecost a blinding light from a previous age that's what the prophet said that's what the prophet said now First Corinthians it says this 1 Corinthians 13:10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with brother brandham said we have today by God's grace the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication so if we have a perfect word here then see what's next when I was a child I spake as a child for I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as I am known you did not realize the mystery of God that was in you the great mystery unfolding of God that God has been working on unveiling himself he said there was a three-fold purpose in the back part of his mind Christ The Mystery of God revealed to gain preeminence first in a man he did it Christ Jesus now he's trying to gain the preeminence in a people he's trying he's working really hard the only thing that can stop his will your will he's a perfect gentleman he will not force you to do something you don't want to do my it's an amazing thing to consider but that's the scriptures that's this message and that's what's going on he said there was a four stages there's a lot of farm ground over here so you all understand farming quite well uh there's four stages there's the stalk there's the tosel there's the shuck and then there's the seed life is in the fourth stage brother brandham says this justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Spirit but the baptism of the Holy Spirit made way for the person of the Holy Spirit himself to come down into Perfection and bring the word again ah Perfection full maturity so water blood spirit the ingredients for a life brings forth a baby but it's just that a baby a baby now the baby must move on into maturing now I found this so interesting because this fourth stage is the stage of life and so when I was looking at this by brother bham said now the book of Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua it's the adoption book it's the placing of a son now when I began to go look through that I began to think okay Ephesians we look in Ephesians chapters 1:4 it says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will well what's so interesting I I went back a few books and I says well we all know the book of Romans is kind of known as the book of justification Romans 3:25 it says wherefore there where is boasting it's excluded uh by uh by law of Works nay but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law so in the Book of Romans is a justification book so then we go to the next book and it's so interesting the very first chapter in the very first verse Paul called to be Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God unto thus our brother unto the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints and to every place whereupon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord is called so then the first book justification is found in Romans the Second Step sanctification found in the first book of Corinthians it's just we're following down line so then the next book would be Galatians what's amazing Galatians is quite the book it says this oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should o not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth Cru CR ified among you this only would I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are you so soon foolish to have begun in the spirit that you're now made perfect in the flesh this is that confusing book this one's odd Galatians is the book where Paul the Apostle the messenger to the first church age withstands Peter to his face a man who had the Holy Ghost withstands him to his face because he's trying to perfect himself withdrawing himself from the Gentiles thinking he can withdraw himself and and basically put forth a circumcision In the Flesh for further Perfection but you're not perfected by works you're perfected by faith and there Peter got within it the righteousness indignation withstands Peter to his face and calls him out because there's your deception they had the baptism of Holy Spirit Peter had the baptism of Holy Spirit but he's about to make a massive mistake he's not going to move on into adoption which is by faith found in the word of God coming and subjection to whatever the Apostle Paul preaches he's trying to withdraw himself unto a uh the the to the Jews and a circumcision of the flesh so we find it's a critical moment we ourselves right now in a critical moment critical moment the messenger to the age which was Paul then rebukes Peter Peter takes the rebuke he takes the pain pain of the correction does not the scripture say if you're my child you can stand chastisement and if you're not my son you can't stand chastisement so Peter identified himself to be a true son he could stand the chastisement of Paul and he can line up with the word so then you have that baptism of Holy Spirit but it's that critical moment brother bam said that critical moment then we have obviously Ephesians chapters 1 and 4 predestinated to the adoption of son so see it's the fourth justification Romans sanctification Corinthians baptism Holy Spirit Galatians but that's that critical moment for everyone they think they're fine they can go home they can just not go to church no more do what I want I already heard the prophet I heard the message I believe it yeah that's great so did they thousands of years ago in the first Exodus they heard the prophet they heard the message of the hour they believed it they left the of egpt they left the denominational systems and they went and wandered around in the wilderness and complained every day of their life complained about the pastor complained about the church complained about this brother complained about that brother don't like the music don't like this I don't like this I don't boy so then this brings into the question what part of the journey are you on right now now you may not be in Egypt but are you in the wilderness where there's constant murmuring and complaining about everything or have you come into the promised land positionally placed by Joshua the holy spirit that uses a five-fold Ministry of pastors Apostles prophets evangelists and teachers that are fallible men God uses non-perfect people to perfect his bride iron sharpens iron if you ever sharpen a knife it's got to go on something abrasive to be sharpened God knows how to perfect his children even the scripture says heresies must needs become so that those that are approved among you will be made manifested that means made flesh made living Epistles read of all men so that question is always an individual question where are you on this Exodus Journey might not be in Egypt but are you still in the wilderness it's individual question for each of us Hebrews says this 3:15 while it is said today if you will hear his voice hearken not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with them whom he G was grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness unto whom swear that they would not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief Hebrews 4 let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he has said I have sworn in my wrath if they shall not enter my rest although the works were finished from before the foundation of the world Paul's speaking to the church saying you better be a fearful Bunch you better take this serious viously just because you hear the prophet just because you can agree and say it's the truth that does not mean it's doing anything for you brother brandham said he said uh just agreeing in the message is not enough he said there's a woman on the front row she' make me a fine wife she looks like a good Christian wife she'd make me a good Christian wife I'm sure in all ways she'd be a good Christian wife he said but she's not mine until I take her and make her mine so many people look at the message they agree with the message but they don't make it a part of their life they fail to have a revelation that it's the mystery of God unveiled in the hour in which they're living it's Christ to you now you could either say Okay Noah's got an ark there and it's a pretty good Ark and I know destructions coming but I'm not getting on the ark I'm going to stay on the outside of the Ark I'm not getting into Christ now that Ark represented Christ the word because it was the word of God made manifested God spoke to a prophet he brought he brought into view the word of God made manifested and it was a way of Escape because impending judgment was coming now we all know impending judgment is coming for this hellbent world both in Canada and America as hellish as all get out and every one of you know it like how God hasn't already burnt the whole thing up already I don't understand I'm a human being and I'm disgusted by what I see the selfishness the selflove the nonsense that you see everywhere now what do you think God is doing sitting back holding back the judgments of God waiting for that last predestinated seed coming in and then them that have come in laying in the presence of the Sun for full Harvest maturity we're at the end everyone but they had to get in the ark to avoid the Judgment floods they had to get in I want to drop this in there too I've been studying this brother Brenham said there was so much science and technology and education in Noah's day that they could shoot the moon and prove there's no rain up there Noah why do you think science and education Advanced to disprove God Science Education and technology is all of the devil all you have to do is go back in the beginning and see where civilization came from Cane's line of people Commerce and workers of metal and music and it all came as a result of a fallen seed the serpent seed not God's children the Devils brought this world that you see all around you into view so if you think about it in that day Science Education and Technology had Advanced to a point to just disprove God's word that's it now they shot the moon brother bham said when they shot the Moon it knocked the world off its axis flooded the Earth and destroyed the people he say God doesn't destroy man man destroys himself God all he has to do is just step back all he has to do in your life is just take one step back and you're finished your own lusts will override every moral compass and every restraining aspect of the holy spirit in life it'll destroy every aspect of you all he has to do is take one step back and you're finished man destroys himself God doesn't destroy man so now I'm looking at it and looking at it again today oh in our day we've now had another explosion of science technology and education with one purpose God not to make the bride's life a little easier where do you think it came from what purpose do you think it's serving brother Brenham said science and education poisoned the mind of the people in Noah's day to where they couldn't receive Noah's message what do you think your science and education and technology is do it's poisoning the minds of the people to not believe God's word it's the same pattern not changed you're just living in Satan's Eden and did not Jesus say as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man an explosion of science technology and education one goal one purpose discredit God's word and the destruction of God's people brother bam said that's the whole purpose of all of it so we find these parallels as we see this Exodus in the beginning and I want to drop this in here as well we know there's an outer court experience an inner court experience and a holy of Holy Experience and I find often times today people uh haven't went all the way we just have to be honest uh when their life is good God's blessing them they have plenty of money and home Life's good okay they're doing pretty good but as soon as something in their natural life goes a little wild doesn't work out quite the way they they think it a well all of a sudden they're just they're miserable they're down they're out they're frustrated they're angry they don't want to go to church they don't want to have any Fellowship Believers because it's all based on the natural sunlight when the natural sunlight blocked by the clouds they don't do so good but then there's another little bit greater light uh and that's the inner court and then the inner Court there's seven golden candlesticks and the Seven golden candlesticks give forth a light and what is it the seven a the seven Church ages and the Seven Messengers represented there so what is it brother man said it's a church light they live by the Light of the church so if the church they're doing good as long as nobody rubs me the wrong way I'm doing good I'm happy to come to church and as long as Pastor doesn't ever uh preach against anything that you know I my personal preference and said what I'm doing okay uh but as soon as he does I want no fellowship with Believers I want to isolate myself you know why you haven't went all the way you haven't went into the holy of holies there's a church light that you can live by but brother mam said those candles get Smoky and when the church gets going through a little difficulty then all of a sudden you want to run away Ah that's when the church needs you the most when things get difficult that's when the body needs each other more than ever before but there is a light NE never goes out and that's the shikina light and brother bam said it was once sin to go beyond that Veil into that shakina of light he said now it's sin if you don't it was once dead he said sudden death to go in now it's death if you don't you'll you're going to perish unless you can go all the way that's just the reality of it that's what he he's wooing you he's calling you to come in and if you refuse to come in what what's he going to do what's he going to do so let's look at this pathway of adoption is this okay we doing all right I mean when you want me to stop just say stop I'll stop so I want to look at this continuation of the pathway onto adoption because remember we're going from a child to a full matured adult and I found a pattern in the life of Jesus Christ because he is our pattern and it's found in Philippians 2:5 Philippians 2:5 and the word of God says let now I'm going to stop right there on the first word let means allow it means you have to allow let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as man he humbled himself and he became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross and what I jumped out to me as I began to see in verse five you see there's a decision you have to allow the mind of Christ to be in you remember he's a perfect gentleman he's not going to force himself into your life you have to let it and then in verse 7even he took upon the form of a servant so he first made his the decision and then he doesn't look to be served he looks to serve he says not my will be done but thine will be done he was about the father's business and then what you see is there's a sacrifice made and in the sacrifice he becomes obedient unto death though he is in the form of God he humbles himself and becomes obedient unto death and I found this to be the pathway of an adopted son this is found everywhere in the Bible it's found in the Book of Joshua in the first Exodus it's found in brother banham's life and it's found in the bride there's first a decision and then God makes you he stands in silence while you make your decision to see what you'll do will it be your will or his will and then ultimately it leads to a sacrifice of your will for God's Will and we find this first found in Mark let's look at Jesus Jesus is following the pattern of this he says in Mark 14 36 he said ABA father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done you see he didn't even do his own will he didn't even do his own will he was only about the father's business he wanted to not have to do this Lord if there's any way I mean is there any other way and then instantly no not my will thine will be done so he makes his decision his will or God's will then we find it and Joshua I'd like to look at it from Joshua because in the first Exodus let's see a decision made in Joshua 1:16 it says and they answered Joshua saying all that thou Hast commanded us we will do whatsoever thou sendest us we will go according as we hearkened unto Moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the Lord God be with thee as he was with Moses so even Israel before they're going into the promised land he puts before them a decision what will you say about it will you do all that I lead you to do or will you do half of what I tell you to do see the Holy Spirit asking through Joshua Joshua type of the Holy Spirit the people in that day make your decision before we go into the land will you obey will you hearken to my voice now we look at brother Branham brother bham had to make a decision did you know that brother Branham had to even come to an adopted son do you know that we're going to look at it it's perfect now brother bham had to First make his decision this decision can be found in the prophecy of Danny Henry because thou Hast uh because thou Hast chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked in thine own choosing thou Hast picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee brother brandham had to make his own choice and it was the harder way we all get to Life's decision sometimes and we get to make a decision I'm either going to take my way which is usually the easy way or I'm God's way which is usually the harder way it's usually not hard to know what God's way is it's the harder way it's just the harder way but you know what humans avoid pain at all costs it's sad to say but we really do we want air conditioning we want soft pews we want no so see the first decision comes into view that's the first step of an adopted son the second one that comes into view is silence now it's interesting when um a child is uh growing up now my oldest one when she's making decisions on her own now I don't always tell her everything to do sometimes me and Mom we sit back and watch the decisions that she makes sometimes we just want to see what she says what she's going to do she's put in a tough situation someone maybe says something about how's she going to respond we want to see what character shines through our daughter you know we're watching her growing up we're watching her maturity we don't always intervene in everything and solve all their problems for her you know you know God does that for us too sometimes God goes completely silent completely silent Where's God God why aren't you moving on the scene why aren't you solving this problem Lord I need you right now he's like I'm going to sit here for a second I want to see how they respond I'm going you know God does big things in silence prophet of God said he does great big things in silence sometimes father God just sits back and watches his children oh that's how they're going to behave that's how they're going to treat that brother my own you know their own brother and sister in Christ that's how they're going to handle them oh that's how they're going to treat the Man Down on the Corner that's how they talk about about uh the unregenerated but but but people that are human beings that have life I gave them life that's how they act serpent seed I don't have time for them oh that's how they act then when God goes silent there's a reason behind his silence sometimes God will go silent in the church just to watch how everybody behaves themselves God sometimes won't solve a problem for the pastor Pastor don't know what to do he's like Lord I don't know what to do right here Lord help me help me yeah it's good let him sweat it out for a moment I'm going let him sit back I want to see how he handles this make him wait for a moment before I show him what to do he does this when God goes it's not because he's not up to nothing God's up to something in each of Our Lives when God goes silent so that silence serves a purpose for the adoption of sons you'll find that pattern consistently now Jesus in Isaiah 53 he o he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his shears is dumb he opened not his mouth now can you imagine this here is the Son of God Jehovah God bottled up and confined in the body of Flesh with the power to change the scene at any moment if he wanted to he had the power he could just boom all of the soldiers gone dissipated I mean evaporated before his very eyes everyone that had stripped off his clothes humiliated him ripped out his beard beat him to a pulp he could have changed the scene but he did nothing he stood silent he was an adopted son it was the father's desire that he had to pay the price for somebody else so he did nothing he took the beating there's your adopted mature son see the calling of us now God wouldn't call you for this if it wasn't possible you know that right God can't ask for you to come or predestinate you into adoption of son and this is your course if it's not possible it's got to be possible God has made a way for the adoption of sons and he's got a custommade course for each of us and we're all on a customade path through life through disappointments discouragements uh ridicules rejections humiliations it's customade just to bring you to adoption it's beautiful it's the most beautiful thing now we can see the same parallel now for the Book of Joshua let's look Joshua 610 Joshua had commanded the people ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you to shout then you shall shout Joshua 6:16 and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord hath given you the city so the people shouted when the priest blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet that the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat so when Joshua the holy spirit said be quiet be silent they silence nothing and when he said okay now speak they spoke they shouted this is so deep right no it's very plain God hides his mysteries in very plain simple ways it's right before each and every one of us God is looking for subjected lives subjected Wills to his will where he says speak you speak when he says sit down be quiet you don't you sit down and be quiet even you could have the power to change the scene and you say nothing you could put that brother in his place you could put that sister right in her place you never should have acted like that and you could put her in her place and he says don't say a word you be kind you be sweet be loving you do good to her she's treating you bad now you go do something good for her see the adoption of sons now brother brandham see we're following the pattern now brother brandham 1961 a man said to me the other night brother bham if you will just compromise a little bit this great man Full Gospel man will take you and we'll furnish you an airplane and you can join our religion and you'll take you'll take this we'll take this gift to every major city in the world world and we will blast it forth if you'll just compromise just a little bit on your teaching he I said now you with a doctor's degree ask a servant of God to compromise on the word I can't even think of such a thing as that man no sir there's no compromise with me at all I believe what God's word teaches the coming of the Son of God I believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit I believe signs and wonders following the Believers that's exactly what God Said and that's what I stand by that's what I believe and I know it's the truth no one's going to get him to compromise you could shower him with any kind of worldly blessings you wanted to if the prophet of God wanted to he could have been the most popular man on the whole world who could have stood in front of him who he could have had it all but he was about his father's business he would only do what God commanded him to do he would not compromise when the word of God spoke he spoke and when the word of God was silent he was silent now it's the bride's turn here you go pergam and church age those in the bride only do his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his word he did not complete his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she has thus sayeth the Lord or she's silent she says nothing says nothing so see the pattern first the decision then you got to learn to be silent When God Says be silent you be silent then comes the sacrifice this is the tough one this is where rubber meets the road let's look at it with Jesus John 10:17 therefore doth my father love me because I Lay My Life down that I may take it up again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again Isaiah 53 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall the righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities brother bam says in the presence of God someone said when he was on the cross if thou be the Son of God come off the cross and prove that you're a Son of God he could have done it they paid him the greatest tribute that they ever had there but they didn't know it they said he saved others but himself he cannot save but if he would have saved himself he could could not have saved others he gave himself so that he could save others now sacrifice comes into view and we find brother bham said now to live your life for others is looking heavenbound right he said now don't live for the one that loves you and treats you good he said you live for the one that hates you and would kill you if they could he said now that's eternal life wow so you have to measure what we think we have sometimes with the Bible and the message of the hour do you love the one that hates you are you living your life in sacrifice to the one that would kill you if they had the opportunity that's what the prophet of God said is eternal life because that's Christ's life he lived his life for others he lived for the one that was ripping his beard out and beating him and humiliating that's who he was living for that's who we live for we live for somebody else I see adoption is a high calling guys I mean it's this is this is serious but this is what we're called unto the adoption of sons so we find here the parallel now in The Exodus Journey we find one who wasn't able to make the Sacrifice by the name of achen achen answered Joshua and said indeed I have sinned against God of Israel and thus thus and thus I have done when I saw Among The Spoils of the good goodly babish garments 200 shekles of silver and a wedge of gold and 50 shekels of weight then I coveted them and I took them and behold they are hid in my Earth in the midst of my tent and the silver underneath of it and Joshua and all of Israel took Ain the son of Zariah the silver and the garments and the gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and he brought them into the valley of aor and Joshua said why hast thou troubled us the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all of Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones this is a man who believed the prophet believed his message left Egypt went through the Wilderness trials came into the land but testified he could not lay his will down for another couldn't lay his life down for somebody else's he loved himself so much that he was willing to sacrifice the word and his own family for his own filthy will if you live your life for yourself you're not the only one that will perish you're not the only one that suffers your wife suffers your children will suffer everything about you will eventually be destroyed because heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away and if I'm not going to pass away I've got to align myself with the word so this man could not go all the way couldn't pay the price now let's look at brother brandham standing in the Gap 1963 I let the sick people lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and what to do and that was wrong see I had built myself up a complex because the people wouldn't hear my message and God forbid that I ever compare myself with the life of Moses but it's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just left them alone and went out in the wilderness but God turned him around for he had he had he had long forgot about the sufferings of the people and I know that one day this will cost me my life that's right it's going to but the truth is still going to be known brother brandham was willing to stand in the Gap suffer the persecution suffer the ridicule suffer the rejection for God and for his people so the people would be lost so now we find the bride very simple3 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life will lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall save it Romans 8:35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or sword it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us you know this is not a Joel ostein style message I mean life is tough for a real True Believer it's difficult it's tough and I don't sugarcoat it it's not a flowery bed of ease see you have to love him so much more than your known natural life I I you know I said this a while ago you know value is determined by the price you're willing to pay for something so if you say this house across the street now to you um to the neighbor it's only worth 50,000 but to you it's worth $100,000 what's the house worth $100,000 because there's a person willing to pay the price to get the home now what price was Christ willing to pay to redeem you he was willing to give up everything now here's my question to you what price are you willing to pay for him see whatever price you're willing to pay determines what value he really is to you if he doesn't mean anything to you you will pay nothing for him the little bit of difficulty a little bit of not getting to do what you want you've just testified how much a value he is to you he's of no value to you I don't want to go to church I don't want to read my Bible I don't want to listen to The Prophet God I don't want to fellowship with them people it's fine you just showed to him how valuable he is to you he means nothing to you see value is always determined by the price you're willing to pay so if you're willing to give up your life you show he's of more value to you than your own natural life and that's the attitude of the Bride so many people want to say they're the bride um but the Bride is a very special group and she's a very rare bunch and the attitude and nature and life that LE she lives uh will be quite a display of the grace of God and the love of God that they have in their hearts they'll show the world how much they really love him because they're willing to suffer for his name's sake yeah so we look in Shalom 1964 he said suffering for the name's sake is just growing pains of his grace yeah suffering for his word see it's just growing pains of his grace yes sir remember that it's the grace of God that was given to you you know just as you grow in Natural Life your natural body it has pains while it's you know a leg leg pains arm pain because it's growing now he says now the sufferings that you endure as a Christian it's just the Growing Pains of his grace it's just part of the maturing process of a son and daughter of God so adoption is just plain painful I don't know how to tell you any other way it's not a great deep thought it's just painful you have to be willing to endure the pain Hebrews Jesus showed us this Hebrews 121 wherefore seeing we are compassed about by such a great cloud of witness says let us lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God this is your example this is one who endured a cross for someone else's sake he didn't have to go to the cross for himself he went to the cross for somebody else so then God turns to you and says who are you willing to go to the cross for you know the only way he could go to the cross and endure such contradiction of Sinners and humiliation and embarrassment was he had you on his mind who for the joy that was set before him brother bam said it was the joy of fellowship with you so he was willing to pay the ultimate price to restore fellowship with you that he once had that he wants to restore so then the question then becomes what price will you pay what will you endure you know sometime in the Christian Life you just have to endure you just got to endure it that means persevere deal with it just keep going bear the burden and keep bearing the cross like I've always said this if Bible says this it says take up your cross daily okay okay if you can't find your cross what path are you on like you can't find any cross there's nothing difficult for you to have to endure every day you wake up it's just I do what I want to do I don't have to subject myself to anybody I don't like I've always said that if you can't find the cross that you have to pick up I promise you you're on the wrong path if you find yourself on his path you'll find a cross nearby that you're going to pick up that's just the way the Christian Life goes there's a cross for each of us to carry so Hebrews 12:5 still okay right know I'm dropping a lot out there but it says seven sermons in one so I'm trying to go fast I'm sorry I just want to paint the picture and then Pastor you can go in and fill in all the details later so I just hit these high points here so Hebrews 12:5 it says ye have forgotten the exhortation when speak his unto us as son unto children my son despise not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scores every son whom he receiveth he if ye endure chastening God deal with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement wherefore all are partakers then you are bastards and not Sons Sons are corrected when they do wrong and they're corrected hard sometimes spankings in life are hard really really painful I remember a story one time brother Brown tells in the great Shepherd he said there was a a shepherd He had a sheep and the Sheep was a mama sheep and good sheep followed followed the shepherd everywhere till one day it had a baby and it so consumed with this little baby lamb that it took its eyes off the shepherd but the BAM tells a story great Shepherd and he says he took his eyes off the shepherd and the shepherd kept watching them mom wouldn't listen to him kept wandering away farther and farther away from the flock he says okay so what did the shepherd do brother bam said the shepherd went down picked up the little baby lamb carried it now that mother lamb never took her eyes off the shepherd because something that she loved dearly was now in his hands he said you know sometimes God will take a little child from you take a loved one from your life he said sometimes God does those things we don't understand why some things happen like like that but God knows what he's doing like we got to stop questioning God and why he does what he does stay in this Wilderness journey and comp complain and murmur because things aren't going easy for us no it's all part of the process it's all part of the journey un adoption sometimes things are difficult that's the way it must be and I find this so you guys Farmers up here the last stage of a harvest is um up here you have combines right you have combine so so H you you think about this little corn or weed up there having a good day Sun's shining you know it's a nice day and all of a sudden this crazy combine comes through this combine comes through beats the tar out of that piece of wheat I mean knocks it all I think that's how you the only way you can do you got to beat the tar out of it right did you know that's part of a Christian Life too the adoption of sons there comes a time you're going to get the tar beat out of you and if you don't think that's scriptural let me show it to you brother brandham tells a little story about 6C Smith George Smith Brother bam used to be a boxer I love this God should this to he said I'm going to tell you Billy no matter how well- trained you are how athletic of an experience you have and how strong you are for your size it ain't nothing until a lick will stop the blood when it hits you he said you might hate me but when you get up there in the ring you'll appreciate it said your body will build up and be able to come back quickly if you get hit and just fall over you lay there and you take the count but if your body is built and can stand the licks then when you get hit hard licks real hard then you'll be able to come back quick and get back on your feet get knocked right out of the ring and then jump back in there he he had just got to go through it Plum knocked me out of the ring he said I have to do it he liked to kill me he was 35 lb heavier than I was he was a real fighter and I was just a student he was almost killing me he said but you'll appreciate it one day when you're in the ring and I found that to be the truth so what was the final stage of this Fighter for brother Bram he was well trained he was athletic and he was strong but he had to be able to take a punch sometimes in your Christian Life when you're coming into adoption and full maturity you just got to take the punch you got to be able to take the hard licks of Life they're going to hit you so hard sometimes but it's all a part of the training it's all a part of an adopted son's life some really hard licks and I don't know what those licks are only you know times exactly what God will hit you with maybe a sickness a lost loved one situation difficulty I don't know but there's some hard licks sometimes and you just got to learn to endure the hard licks remember Christ's mystery of God revealed Satan has A Punch Coming For You I don't care who you he don't don't care who you are he's got a right to that one punch which would you rather have it be blindness or an arthritic or be nervous he's got somewhere he's going to punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot that you've got to keep covered over all the time we all have weaknesses I hope I'm not the only one you know what the weak wees were your greatest blessing in life if you had no weaknesses brother bham said it was this nervousness condition that I have that led me to Jesus Christ if you had no weaknesses you'd have no need ah we have a great need we have a debt that we could not pay we have weaknesses in our life that we can't overcome we have complexes difficulties scars pains that we've all gone through and they're all weaknesses Allowed by God to keep you dependent on him they're the greatest blessing if we'll actually look at week is from the right position and so now we went through the decisions to the silence the sacrifice and then just the reality that adoption is painful and you got to learn to take the punches it's the chastening of a son but then also the aspect of adoption is the placing of a son that you've all been born with gifts and callings from God you all have a place in the body we all have a place in the body God did not call us to be an adopted son and live all by ourselves separate from a body of Believers this is not scriptural it's not in the Bible because the body is a many membered body and everybody has their place their gift their position that they must come to and just like uh if we were fighting a battle if I'm fighting the enemy on this side I need someone covering my side on this side and someone needs to cover me on this side and who's going to cover me back here and you as a many many B body of Jesus Christ are covering for one another where you're weak he's strong where he's strong she's weak and everybody has a place in the body because you're serving each other you're not just serving yourself and that was part of the Joshua commission when he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt through the Wilderness journey through the chastisements through the silences of God bringing him into the position of the promised land what did Joshua do he said now you're going to be in that part of the land and you're going to go to this part of the land and you're going to cover this side if the enemy comes anywhere around we've got people everywhere we've got this place secure this is our promise word and this is your position and you're the people to cover that ground Joshua blessed him and gave Caleb the son of uh jhuna Hebron for an inheritance Joshua placed the people in their position you each one have gifts and callings from God nobody can take your place nobody can take your place and the devil convince you I can't I got nothing I can't do anything for God I've got no purpose just you being here just you saying Amen to the word of God just you helping to create an atmosphere can bless the person beside you you don't know what someone else is going through but see you're living your life for others you're you're sacrificing your own time your own energy your own Comfort to create an atmosphere for say a young person like do you love the young people more than you love yourself it's easy to stay home stream services well come sit create an atmosphere sing songs create an atmosphere of faith for somebody else to be able to receive the word and be born again and come to maturity see we are supposed to live for others and that's why it's a body Ministry and that's why part of becoming an adopted son is finding your position in the body of Christ everybody has a position brother bam said in adoption but when they were born they were positionally born into the kingdom of God and the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he gives into them their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledges Gifts of wisdom Gifts of healing and all kinds where the church is now this is my purpose in doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but they don't but don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner if you're Manassa you see you have to take your place in Christ positionally everybody has their position but stay in your position stay right where God's called you to be do what God called you to do that's how a fful Ministry compliments each other you know they compliment each other they're not there condemning one another and say ah he can't pre you know this one should do this no my goodness my goodness no everybody the Evangelist needs the pastor the pastor needs the teacher the teacher needs the Apostle the Apostle needs the prophet it's all part of the out a while back I was sharing with by the day I hope it's okay but like I realized the five-fold ministry is all the aspects of a father Raising a Son because Ephesians 4 the five-fold ministry is given for the what perfecting of the Saints what is perfecting full maturity to come to full age to come to maturity so when you're raising your child you have son this is your son okay there's times when you uh he needs corrected you got to get out the rod of chastisement and it's time for a little uh stimulation by what the say protoplasmic stimulation gets it needs a spanking the boy just needs it but there's other times it's not time for spanking right sometimes you just got to put your arms sh and say it's going to be okay buddy don't worry it's going to be okay all is fine then there's other times you can't spank it's not a time to put your arms around him now you have to teach him a lesson you have to instruct him on something right then there's times that he grows older he just doesn't understand with the knowledge that he has he doesn't understand the situation so what do you got to do you got to take him up to see things from a little bit higher perspective what does the prophet do he lifts you up higher you're looking at things not right you need to come up higher and look down on the situation and see it as it is right and then the Apostle he's the missionary right he said we can do it there's times you can just say I'm not going to wrap you up and give you a hug I'm not going to teach you lesson it's not take you up higher it's to say you can do it just keep going just keep going right it's the all the aspects of a five-fold Ministry it's all the aspects of our heavenly father to help bring people to full maturity or the adoption of sons so people are cutting themselves off from a five-fold Ministry and they're paralyzing their own maturity they can't spiritually come to full maturity I didn't say that the Bible said that you don't have to take my word for it Ephesians 4 says it's there for the perfecting what is the perfecting the maturing of the saints of God you need the five-fold ministry and all of their weakness wies all of their failures we're all failures there's none great amongst us there's no great anybody but God God just chooes unlikely individuals with lots of broken uh broken pieces and uh broken up ways and weaknesses and complexes and all you know brother bah had a complex right you understand that right you understand big complexes nervousness even told his wife to lie one time made massive mistakes your Prophet was not perfect but he was perfect that's what made him perfect his imperfection made him perfect because in his weakness God's strength was made strong now what is the fivefold ministry they're weak but in their weakness his strength's made strong so then God uses the weakness of the five-fold ministry to what display the strength of God and bringing Saints unto full maturity you can't deny what the word says you're just hurting yourself so in the voice of the sign when God is called a person to a job there's no one else that can take your place there's just no one else that can do it you're each one set here in God's economy just for this place one fasts one communes another one will cast out Devils another one will just stay fasting that's the whole body of Christ working together in a Unity when we see the denominational barriers breaking us up that's what hurts my heart because see that's the thing that's always separating us there is no big people among us there's no great people among us we are all the same we're just the children of God there is only one great one amongst us and that's Christ no big preachers no big anybody just Sons and Daughters of God I'm just happy to be a part of you like I hope you understand it's like I don't need to preach I don't I happy I come up here just to have fellowship with you you know eat some good meals and sit down and hear the word of God I don't ever have to preach like I don't need to be preaching I'm happy to just be a part of the body of Jesus Christ hearing the word word being perfected by his grace I'm just a happy to be a part of it like that's why I've always told me I'm just happy to be here you don't understand what I went through I was never born and raised in this God in his Mercy came my way so 1 Corinthians chapters 12 just so that you can see it from the Bible for the body is not one member okay we'll stop right there I don't need a body I can live all by myself I can listen to the prophet of God and I don't have to have Fellowship Believers 1 Corinthians for the body is not one member but many o if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not the body is there therefore not of the body if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is there uh therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye then where's the hearing if the whole body were the hearing where is the smelling but now hath God set members every one of them in the body now listen to this one as it hath pleased him and they say oh I would go but that person's there I don't care for that person now hold on God ha set in the church that person they're there because God set them there so maybe they're there for your perfecting or maybe you need to go there for their cares you know you can't complain about these things you got to start looking at things from the Bible's perspective we have been we we're bone of his bone life of his life power of his power word of his word we are him we do things according to the word of God not how we feel about things we stick with what the word says so the body is not one member many membered bride vastly different individuals different Natures different ideas on things your each home Sovereign right I have different ideas than my own Pastor brother Chad I submit myself to him because I love him as a pastor I know God has said him as a pastor and I'm so happy he's my pastor but we're different like we're different individuals I'm different from my wife she's very detailed I'm not she's very good at organizing I'm not really great with organizing things but I love her we compliment Each Other Well I think you think we compliment each other yeah okay see we needed each other she needed me there was something in me that she needed something I know I needed a lot of her most of all her I wouldn't be here today without her but that's the reality of it we need each other and as time goes on brother bam said you guys draw closer and closer and closer together he said don't let nothing get amongst you he said don't let any difference ever get amongst you to the point where you can't love each other CU we're going to have differences we're sometimes going to rub each other wrong your nature is going to be contradictory to another man's nature it's a many-membered bride God's a god of variety who you going to go compain playing to God and say God why'd you make that man that way cuz eventually in that argument you're going to have to shut your mouth because then you say who am I to question God for making that man what he is today and then you have to sometimes ask it about yourself sometimes you get frustrated with yourself why' you make me this way God then you have to say no Lord I'm fearfully and wonderfully made you made me for a purpose to fulfill a job that only I could fulfill I am me because no one else could be me no one else could fulfill this role that you've called me to it may just be prayer you see what he said someone praying someone fasting someone singing a song Someone preaching someone creating an atmosphere it's not always preaching it's everybody in their position makes the whole unit work together as one cylinder all in harmony with each other and then you watch what God will do amongst you that's the reality of it you love each other and just pull up a little closer as time goes on oh boy man we've went a while I better beat it up so okay all right okay okay he said good so I said okay brother the Dale said good keep going right keep going okay okay we keep going now I want to bring in the witnesses of adoption I told you this is seven parts and I'm not even done I mean it's say clo so I want to bring in the witnesses of adoption now this may sound interesting but it's right out of your Bible and you'll find out I think with more clarity what this age is all about now brother bam says and hear ye him he says now God is going to do something great and so when he does he brings forth Peter James and John we'll just call them faith hope and charity the three great gifts of God take Peter for Faith James for Hope and John's always love which is Charity he takes this faith hope and charity with him as he goes up into the mountain because he is fixing to do something he's going to make a great expression and he wants it to be confirmed he always confirms it with three Witness two or three Witnesses the Old Testament statement is in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established now watch where I'm going he goes up into the mountain calling these three men three outstanding gifts of the people that was with him they bring him up into the mountain then he has three Heavenly beings some something must going to take place see there's three Earthly Witnesses and there's three Heavenly Witnesses there's Moses Elijah and Jesus transfigured or transformed and there's Peter James and John the Earthly and the Heavenly all meeting together now think of this now the Bible says out of the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word be established now a witness you would say we we use the word Witnesses if we're going to have a court case a judgment right now in a court case uh prosecution and defense will both produce what Witnesses they both will produce witnesses to prove their case right that's the reality of it anybody to prove their case produces Witnesses right you have to have a witness now when they were trying to uh condemn Jesus Christ they could they gathered false Witnesses because even then that corrupt court that kangaroo court that was trying to persecute Jesus Christ had to get witnesses to be able to pass judgment but they couldn't get their witnesses to agree the Bible says they couldn't get their witnesses to agree but we have faith hope and charity and these three Witnesses are an agreement and these are the Earthly Witnesses of an adopted son now think of this for a second the Earthly Witnesses of an adopted son is faith hope and charity a mature son has Faith a mature son hopes when it doesn't look like there's anything worth hoping for a mature son has charity loves a love that endures that's patient that's kind that's courteous that's charity real charity an adopted son has that witness saying yes this is an adopted son see I'm charity and I'm witnessing that this is an adopted son see this adopted son has Faith to overcome any situation because he knows God can't fail God keeps his word I don't care how smart you are I don't care how much you understand you know faith is a witness in your life as an adopted son because whatever God says you say amen that's the truth like sister hadie right I don't think she was the most intellectual one there she just said that ain't nothing but the truth brother brandom and she's her she was the right woman who said the right thing in the presence of the right person and God confirmed knowing she would ask for the right thing the third poll manifested on this woman the first time the third pole manifested was to her because she had faith in what the prophet said she just believed what he said was the truth so faith is a true witness of an adopted son charity is a true witness and hope is also witness for an adopted son now those three Witnesses are the Earthly Witnesses but there's three Heavenly witnesses as well Moses was resurrected they disputed they couldn't find Moses's body the devil was angry he says Hey where's Moses guys he disputed with Michael the Archangel where's Moses we've been looking for him for days no one of my demons can find Moses why Moses was resurrected now Elijah's there standing with Jesus who was Elijah representing the raptured Chariot of fire come down and rapturing and what was Jesus the word transfigured an adopted son where what did Brother bam said he said Earth and Heaven were uniting again heavens and earth were uniting what is an adopted son he's being lifted up out of this AR Earthly identification finding his Heavenly identification what did Brother brandham say in his final sermon in the communion I am not the son of Charles and Ella Branham I am a Son of God he had come back into true communion a true Oneness he knew who he was and where he came from and that's what we sometimes are struggling to understand we still have these elements of spiritual Amnesia we don't really know who we are we're trying to find our identification in work trying to find our identification with certain set of friends or in success or this or that and you realize the greatest identification you can have is a Son of God a daughter of God there is nothing of Greater importance to you than just to be his son hallelujah it's nothing more there's not you you've already achieved the greatest thing possible to just be a son of God a daughter of God there's no higher calling in life it's amazing these it Witnesses must all be on display now remember Witnesses are called before a judge now brother brandham goes into this in the Life Magazine see Life Magazine packed it this mystical circle of light goes up in the air of Tucson Phoenix in the same way that I told you nearly a year before it happened how it would be like a triangle the picture hangs in the church down there you that took the magazine has it there it was just exactly they said it's 27 miles high and 30 mil across they don't understand what happened it happened mysteriously and went away mysteriously brother Fred sofman brother Jee Norman and I were standing there three as a witness like he took up to the Mount Peter James and John to give witness that stood there and watched what had happened now let's recreate the situation for a moment there's Jesus Mount Transfiguration there's three Earth Earthly witnesses that went up with him Peter James and John now a cloud descends and Jesus is caught up into the cloud and Moses and Elijah the raptured and the redeemed or the resurrected and the raptured they present Jesus's figure changes he's transformed he's glorified State now and a voice cries out and says this is my my son hear ye him now in 1963 the prophet of God is bringing up Life Magazine he's saying now three as a witness we went up on the mountain and a cloud came and I got caught up into the cloud and he said hey this one seemed a little bit more to me than the other ones this theophany and what made up the white wig angels and brother Benham said one man can represent an entire church age so you had the seven Angel Messengers in making up the cloud of Christ the head of Christ what were they representing the resurrected of the ages of the last 2,000 the entire bride was represented in Christ Jesus when John looked at the seven golden candlesticks he saw one liken to the son of man gab about to the pasts what is it Christ in Bride form so brother brandom gets caught up he sees the seven angels around him he says what is this I've been caught up into this what is this cloud and what is this age it's the age of adoption this is way more than just God sent a Prophet this is way more than just a cloud of vindication the Vindication is the resurrected lives coming to full maturity what a resurrection that was what a resurrection that this is being quickened and be made alive in Christ Jesus quickened caught up into Christ understanding who we are where we came from the mystery of Christ coming into Plain View thank you God hides in Simplicity it's just hidden in simplicity so this Earthly witness Faith who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong waxed violent violent in fight and turned the Flight of the Aries to the aliens uh they were stoned they were saw asunder they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat they were desolate Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us are not made perfect they're waiting for us the last 2,000 years and seven other Church ages and all the bride for the last 2 th000 years is waiting for us to come to what Perfection what is perfection full maturity full maturity that's what they're waiting on that's what this age is here to accomplish the adoption of sons hope Jeremiah 17 says blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord whose hope is in the Lord you don't put your hope in the government you don't put your hope in your retirement you don't put your hope in your insurance package you don't put your insur uh hope in how much money you got in the bank or your family or your daddy's money or anything my hope is in the Lord that's where my hope lies there's an adopted son he puts his hope in the right things and then we know charity everybody knows charity charity suffers long it's kind there a nothing worse I can find than it's just a a not nice Christian you know you may not have 10,000 converts but you could smile when you go to the grocery store you could conduct brother bam said this he said conduct yourself with joy in the midst of the trials that he sees fit to bring your way be happy we should be the happiest kindest sweetest people that have ever walked the Earth the Bride of Jesus Christ she should be able to love like no one else can love if anybody could find sympathy in someone's eyes it should be you it should be you yeah that's what I always loved about Jesus they always mocked him and ridiculed him and he was friends with all the prostitutes and the publicans and the worldly people they all loved him he must have treated him really sweet must have been gentle and kind understood why maybe they were in the situation that they were in he was compassionate so charity never fails so Romans uh or Romans 8:1 17-18 and if a child then HS with God and join airs with Christ if we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I re that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us remember you're predestinated unto adoption Justified makes way for sanctification sanctification makes way for baptism Holy Spirit baptism holy spirit makes way for the person of him of the word himself to come into VI whom he's Justified he sanctify him who he Sanctified he's already what glorified and what is glorification Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that I had with thee from before the foundation of the world he said I have glorified it and I will what glorify it again I will glorify it again how in you how was he glorified he did the father's will he was nailed to a cross as an adopted son he wasn't about his business he was about the father's business what will the bride be in his very own image not doing her will his will not trying to defend herself protect herself she lives her life for others as an adopted son we're almost done I have to skip a couple pages so I wanted to pose this question to you in light of what we've said here as the purpose of this age is bringing children into adoption um there's a portion of word in Acts 1 18 it says when Jesus said this he said but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you what was that power brother bam said he said it was power for service not just power to raise the dead speak in tongues no it was power to live the Christian Life to Live the Life that he lived the holy spirit is given to you for power for service and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem to Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had thus spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye here gazing this same Jesus which is taken up from you unto Heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven so that's my question having heard all that we've heard today why stand you here gazing sometimes we look what is this message what's it all about why is it in the way it's why is the difficulties why the why the conflicts amongst churches why can nobody get along with nobody am I the only one that's asked the question could it be we haven't moved on into adoption have we maybe not fully realize what that cloud represented what it was all about it was the father coming down making a public declaration these are my children sir hear ye them hear ye them they represent me I have confidence in them they'll speak when I tell them to speak and they'll be silent when I tell them to be silent they have their Witnesses speaking on their behalf they have faith they have hope they have charity they're all in View for the world to see see that cloud is the adoption of children we were predestinated to this age and they without us are not made perfect because they're waiting for our adoption so these things must come into view and I think at times we have to say what are we looking at what is this all about what's been going on and what is my role now what do I do now having seen what great calling God has called us to musicians will you come will you stand with me I apologize for so much in such a little time I hope uh you're okay with that I just delivered my soul and hit some high points I I feel a little bit bad because so every one of these literally I could go an hour on and I just tried to cover seven aspects of these adopted Sons I'd like to close with this thought brother bham said in the resume of the ages brother bam says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or to join my church or to start a fellowship or an organization I have never done that and I will never do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied and that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men where men live as New Creations in Christ filled with his Spirit living according to his word I invite you and plead and warn all of you by the hearing of this voice yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart brother bham never preached so that he could have people listen to him or have a big church no true Minister I think ever ministers so that people would uh think well of him or come to his church or have a big F A true minister of God just wants to see the word of God living and thriving in a person's heart and and I want it for me I I I don't I don't even I I that's for me I you know what I love about preaching the most is the time I get set aside alone with God to study the word because I find in the time I'm spending with him it changes me just the alone time it's my favorite part of preaching when you ask me I get nervous about standing here but I love the couple days before as my mind is just stayed on the Lord and I'm looking through the scriptures and he takes me from one thing to another thing and this opens up and this opens up it's the thrill of my whole life it's just to see the word opening up before me as it begins to open it up to my eyes and that is my heart desire for each and every one of you is that honestly that that true spiritual relationship that God desires to have with you will be established in you and you can see what he's calling you unto he wants to be able to put you before all menlu say ah this is my boy I want the whole world to know this is my boy he's just like me just like me I'm proud of him and I'm happy to be identified with my son that's what he wants for each and every one of us will you just bow your heads for word our prayer as we close Heavenly Father we just come before you so thankful for this day thank you Lord for your word lord it's so real it's so alive Lord we're not looking at a history book or some Fable from years ago we're looking at a living reality of a living word being made manifested before our eyes and father your Prophet said let it first start in the mind then drop into the heart and they be manifested in the lives of your children and father father God I pray that we've brought the word before your children today I believe Lord and I pray that it was just the spiritual food and due season Lord I pray that we would take it into our hearts and meditate and chew on these things and Lord may they take root in our hearts and lives and may it bring into view a reality of a Son of God into view for the whole world to see father where we failed you and we all have failed you lord your Prophet said we all make big mistakes I pray Lord that You' forgive us for those big mistakes that we make sometimes father we pursue our own will we do what we want we don't like uncomfortable things we sometimes try to separate ourselves from painful situations or painful people father that's not right I pray Lord that the reality of eternal life would begin to express in us a life that lives for others a life that's kind a life that's full of joy happiness Lord May these things that we speak about they see seem so common but that the real elements of eternal life may they be in view for all the world to see in each of us father I pray for every young person here every old person may Lord we draw closer to you and Lord I know that's burning in my heart and I believe it's burning in their hearts and Lord if it's a deep calling there must be more deep to respond to it father I commit the pastor we we thank you for the pastor of this church brother Dale Lord what a blessing it is to have a pastor that cares for the the people I pray Lord that you'd continually bless him bless his ministry bless his life and his wife and his family bless this church May every person Lord be anointed of the Holy Ghost to fulfill their position be in their role and their post of Duty Lord may it all beat together as a like a Harmony father amongst the people like a great composition everybody playing their part just when it's necessary one praying one interceding one fasting one singing everyone creating an atmosphere for each other always encouraging uplifting doing what we can to protect and going out after each of us when we see one in Fault may we go after them but there's too much love in a heart to let them get away Lord May the love of God be spoken amongst these people as the scriptures say this is how all men will know that you're my disciples they'll have love one for the other see how they love one another may this be a great Beacon of light that shines in this community as a House of the love of God a people that love each other so much and they've never seen a love like that they can cope with one another and they never speak ill about the other person they always talk about how good and how lovely they are they don't even see the mistakes or the failures may it be known in this area father that the Believers will all find their position and Lord come to the adoption of sons Lord we sure love you we thank you for your word we thank you for the time that you've given us Lord we're thankful that this isn't a resurrection from 2,000 years ago but it's a present tense resurrection of the body of Jesus Christ coming into view
