there he will be amen amen so don't be alarmed at what's going on here i just have a few things i want to put out that we're going to be talking about this morning so um you might as well have your seats right now we just want to give a few announcements uh maybe share a little bit but the pastor said it would be okay to share a little bit about my family so you kind of know who's preaching pretty pure that i'm glad your pastor isn't all about ties because i'm not a thai guy i don't believe brother brown was a thai guy i believe there was a service preached with his t-shirt on the same word came forth so you know what this is a suit right now doesn't let tim look great well guess what i'm taking off my suit because it's not going to change what i'm going to speak i could take off my tie it's going to change what i'm speaking like a t-shirt today an overall space god it's what is being spoken that matters and firmly believe that because in the message we have people and clicks in the message that try to make people feel bound in church and church because on sunday morning we have this little thing on no this will take you to heaven this will take you to heaven your heart being changed so once a person's heart is once part of their heart is changed then the outside manifestation will take place amen that's what we desire to talk about is our powerpoint gonna work there sister yeah it's working praise the lord all right so we're gonna just talk about our family if you see up there once she gets it up um we have uh our family of five so there um on the picture it looks like we're having a signal putting our signal on there so praise the lord this morning we're going to speak on if you're taking notes which is very good in church to take notes we're going to speak on what do we believe question what do we believe and my subject today is jesus cares do you care okay so we're going to get there but first i wanted to give this a little introduction about me so if you look in there on the screen that's my lovely lovely beautiful better half wife sister jess scandi's amen long hair praise god never cut it that's a testimony um her little our little baby is uh just over a month old that's brother boaz elliott andes then we got in the middle the big man maybe he'll listen to this i don't know he might not be awake yet titus paxton andes which is pleasing meaning pleasing we just sang that pleasing to god and then liberty dawn andes in my arms there so we have three kids four two almost two and a newborn so we have three and that means we have five which that means we have grace amen so the next slide um i don't have a clicker the next side is my father and pastor brother john andes and i hope he doesn't mind because i know you guys won't mind the picture on the right that a pastor can actually work and have fun so here uh he's wearing actually one of my cousins sweaters their company and then that's my company with my truck in the background we were doing some cleanup work trying to be a blessing for the pastor he just happens to be my dad so he just started being a pastor but he's had a gift on his life his whole life to be a pastor he was a pastor for three years at 21 years old so when i was younger than me 21 to 24 he went to patton's and helped for three moved back to the biscuits for 20 years he is associate minister there and was a youth leader youth pastor you would say took care of the young people and in the u.s we have a u.s believers and canadian believers right so then when the border shut down my dad would have to stay on this side and would preach for the believers about once every week or two and then he felt led to be an evangelist for six months felt to start uh journeying a little bit around and then he started this work god started the work in november and we have seen nothing but god since it started people that have dui's people that have smoked drinked and had alcohol have come to our church confirmed my burden has not come easy but on his 50th birthday today happy birthday dad we want to say happy birthday i know he's streaming right now he told me he would be so i'm just thankful for his life amen next slide um the next slide is my wife i mean my my mom sister sharon andes and um if you don't have a good mom you won't get far in life so i'm thankful for my mom um she came from australia she was uh she came here um she came to bc actually and because of the commonwealth um she she was able to uh to do like a nursing taking care of older people and she came to bible way and um my dad was preaching the biscuit allowed him to start preaching and spoke a servant came back from africa and she had a revelation that that was her husband in the service so i was telling him about the deal what if brother biscuit hadn't allowed a young teenager boy to speak in that service she would have never known who john andes was so thank god for a minister like brother bis amen and then on the right here sister star caldwell who actually lives with us so she wrote she is the mother of uh sister jessica and she lives with us and we're trying to be a blessing for her and she's a blessing to us next slide i just have a few slides so then there's my brother here on the left is my brother owner of augusta lawn care services also used to speak young people stop now but i believe god has a gift on his life that he can speak and have an influence and impact in the business community right so by your life people can know something's different about michael andes and therefore they will want what he has they'll say something's different in tim and he's in my business therefore they'll want what i have and what makes us different is what we're going to talk about on the right there is all five of us my dad mom and brother and sister victoria there in the middle i don't mean to say this rudely but she married a canadian so right now they're revelation in canada but brother dale telling me there's a mighty exodus out of canada so i'm praying maybe they'll cross the border and come live with me work with me the john walnut he maybe will stream this down the road but i will say this uh just because it's hard financially in canada and even in washington state it's one of the most expensive places to live god is your provider god provides for all your needs and if you are where god wants you you will be happy you might not be financially blessed but you will be eternally blessed when you make a choice for jesus christ it might be the harder way it might not be where your family thinks you should go it might not make sense financially as i talked with a very good family member to this last week and they were telling me they're upset about the church situations going on in our in our area and i'm up about it too not upset about the people against the devil the devil that is trump splits in churches the devil is the one that tries to cause disfellowship so i'm saying god you sent a message which we're going to talk about today bill will he do that brother and sister at the end time judge doing what they're doing fulfilling prophecy of william branham and then my brother and then myself i need to lose a little bit of weight um anyone noticed something me and my dad look very similar right i'm thankful for that i want to say if we're supposed to be like our heavenly father i'm glad i'm thankful out of all three of the kids make him proud just like i want him my testimony would line up with his life and test my life my this he told me this from a little boy he said tim do more than i did do greater things go higher go deeper that's what the young generation needs to do if your dad isn't serving god you serve god if your brother don't go if my brother tomorrow and his millions of dollars business tomorrow says this isn't true i'm not going to that because i'm not i've already seen okay doesn't matter family if my victoria right there you see her in that picture right there if tomorrow wear pants and i'm going to leave my husband i'm not going to follow that okay so i just want to give this a testimony as well on the left is my grandpa who's still alive holding little boaz brother ken andes and sister joyce there on the right this is our family heritage and it's of god and i'm thankful for it not everyone can say that but these individuals you're looking at every english message you read and they edited period every those two people any money to their name they rent from me right now i'm trying to bless them by giving them a lower so that they can have a final years of their life because i firmly believe those people that have gone before us our pastors that have gone before us they don't need to stay behind the pulpit till they're 85. firmly believe they can and they can let someone else the torch it doesn't have to be a their brother or something that becomes master of the church but you've got to make sure you take care of those that ran this race well and we don't need them having heart attacks and dying prematurely because too much pressure is in their lives so my grandpa and grandma by the grace of god have served the lord for 50 years of god i'll say this publicly lord willing and radio broadcast in washington state and on my podcast about both of their millions of people in a few weeks are going to know the truth that what the message produces works they stay together they love each other they they they're not divorced they're not split they know what they believe man so this is just a testimony of my life to defeat all the critics right at the beginning that the message is true next slide so a little bit about myself sorry this is taking too much time i'm going to be very quick on this but brother tim has a vision and a desire to spread the go will anyone else have a desire okay that but if it's not your desire to tell others about jesus you are not a bride member because the bride tells others what they believe if you really love something you tell someone about it is that true i really love if you believe that god is rich in mercy you will tell others to read this message book if you believe lean not to your own understanding let's keep going we don't need to birth pains if you believe that birth pains is what we need for a body change this is what you will tell people i'm not a salesman i'm not a salesman i'm a living man that believes in jesus christ so in our nonprofit organization which just started this month pnw missions connected with and prayer support by our local church end time message tabernacle in ferndale washington we have started a desire and i tell this to everyone not for them to give to me not for them to um not to follow what i'm doing but to get to be a pastor's vision so my pastor is now brother john andes his vision is the same we must believe local missions is important local if our churches are getting smaller in north america and we're spending thousands of dollars in africa we are wrong if there are no people coming to our church that have uh cut hair and are wearing pants and not coming to our church because we're not telling him and testifying about what god's done for us and the saving power of god then we are not having a local impact so therefore ministries around the world that will listen to this service you must have local missions and if you're here today and you can't pay your food bill tomorrow you can't pay your electric bill go to your pastor every person that listens he can help you he might not give you three thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars to get out of debt but he can tell you in five minutes i know i can with any individual that would take the time to take me out for coffee in five ten minutes i'd say here brother here's the word way this is what you need to do in your life make some changes so you don't land to divorce so don't land in separation and fellowship five minutes brother branham says two minutes you can discern if a person is the holy ghost in less than one minute brother dale has the holy ghost he can discern if he's gonna be able to help you or not help you we're gonna talk about that this morning this is this is my defense somebody we're gonna talk about this and this everyone know what that is we're going to talk about that is everyone on the edge of their seats now pnwmissions.com you can go to the next slide that's where you can go if you would like to know more but if you're having anything you'd like to pray for on your prayer list who has a prayer list if you don't have a prayer list start today kids at the top family first anyone that needs god put a prayer list down i don't have a brother deal but i can send some to you brother um we printed hundreds of these it has no church name it's a check and it says whosoever believeth in me that's who it's paid order to so who believes in jesus christ this is i know this seems temporal in elementary and grade twos can do this because i did it at bca when i did it i had them fill out a check grade twos because they can write and i told him to put right here it says the desire of your heart what's your desire the problem is people don't ask so they won't receive that's bible all right man so in p p w missions it's local pacific northwest is what that means pnw currently we have a prayer request i have a prayer request and great desire for this to happen immediately that somebody that would desire for their ministry not to be behind a pulpit but to be able to work with me in audio and video expertise that lives in washington state so can you pray for me for that we're going to uganda and malawi next month lord willing to assess spiritual needs and to bring truth to the country the truth is jesus christ will set them free jesus christ is their provider they don't need americans to send them money i don't need to set i don't need to give them one dollar nope i can tell them how to spend their money in their country and they will do well amen now can you send 500 to a brother leo in uganda yes you should your duty bound when you have been given much much is required and you have ten thousand thirty thousand you are losing money and you feel secure well i wouldn't be right now i'd be saying jesus help me i'm being serious i want my bank account as close to zero every month as possible why because i have zero dollars in the bank i'm on my knees depending on god i'll tell you right now this past week my personal checking account has bounced does anyone know that did anyone think that brother tim has no money in his personal bank account when i'm preaching no that's what happened by the grace of god i have a nice bank and they give you three thousand dollar where if you go negative they pay it back praise the lord now the other part i'm not going to tell you is there's twenty thousand dollars owed to me this week that will be coming in by tuesday bank of heaven now requires faith what this check is a bank in heaven and it will never run dry cash the check and see what we'll do i'm holding my wife's here my wife puts on here so the salvation of her brother isaiah in jesus name and if he listens to this service your sister's praying for you hurt my wife down since oh here it is full restoration of god serving our children our sons and our daughters and my husband that's my wife every single one of those are coming to pass they either have or they're in the process of becoming god's work man and our desire in pnw missions then is for local churches to be encouraged name of jesus is the greatest name and every one of these message books points you to jesus and you will notice there's no picture of brother branham on the front he's on a little tiny picture on the back with a little quote because what is inside of what you read and what you listen and what you feed on is what you show and become so pnw mission just a little lighthouse we don't i'm being honest we just start okay vision will prosper the vision will go forward when a person is like george mueller where they depend on god who george muller one person two people man brother dale you might want to do a little research on george muller and preach a service about him it's impactful okay i'll just leave it at that the pastor can do that if he george muller just to be really quick because my sister right there is like tell me more george mueller two orphanages over two thousand children came through that orange what is an orphan doesn't have a mom and dad most of the time that child has not had that but all of the time that chuck didn't william branham but what he knew and what he believed i don't know who what i don't know what doctrinally he believed but his life preaches a message it either makes people desire more of god and when i read his bibliography it made me have more faith right this book right here i haven't even started reading it's about a local pastor that giving all glory to god i told the man i will read it as long as it's not pointing me to your church as long as it's not pointing me to what you believe and it's just a tech cause that's what he said it says on the man was healed of cancer praise god oh no he's a denominational pastor your attitude is wrong your spirit is wrong and perhaps you're ready to go brother ron malevo in philippines and i'm only saying this because your pastor knows him right he wrote a book here the message of the hour reference guide let's all get this book have your pastor order them i got three copies for 15 each or something why you can spend 50 out to go out to eat this afternoon don't have these in your home if you like to read paper these only cost like what well they don't even make them anymore do they oh they do i don't know they don't i don't know if they do try and see if you can get paper copies in your home because a child doesn't need to be reading on an ipad the message they need to be reading it in book form that is totally backwards i know it seems old school but think about it for one minute if our children all the reading they do in school right now is done on an ipad they will be deadbeats so they need to read it and if they can't read mommy and daddy need to read it i gave one of brother felix right i gave you that book of brother branham the new version the first book right i would read that any day before disney to my kids and that's not legalistic i would read a little simple picture book about george muller find it read about john wesley find it martin luther find it those are good things so pnw's mission is to encourage us to all get ready to go home uganda and malawi there are bride members there next slide i think the next slide is our little example for witnessing so this is again another example for the devil and for us here that there are people that sir still believe in witnessing if you don't believe in witnessing you are not ready to go in a rapture a witness is someone that has been there done that brother right they believe it's true and now they're going to tell someone else that's a witness brother eddie biskell was a witness and there with the prophet he has made 11 or 12 videos you can go see him on youtube wonderful pointing us to jesus christ through a ministry that he was with wonderful now that man is dead william branham brother biscuit is older that's why they made the videos because he if the lord carries will pass away he will perry green passed away and we happening in tucson we need to pray for those believers they still don't have a pastor okay they need a pastor you have to have a pastor but witnessing is a local vision that a pastor has to have if he doesn't have that if he doesn't even want to he can say all day i have a vision for something but if he doesn't do it himself that's not a pastor that's called a i can do that in my business too i can say brother or math not brother uh chris you go do this right you go do this it's called delegation okay but you need to go with the person and show them that it's your vision this is the way we work this is the way we ho i'm talking your language now this is the way we're going to farm okay if brother jared took one month and trained up a man for one month that was willing to be teachable he could literally not have to work another day in his life if he found the right man that was teachable that worked for next to nothing and in one month i guarantee that you're gonna have a great job i just gave you a plan of how to get out of business and something for god if that's what god's called you to so witnessing is important um this is brother daniel in the middle kihanga who just had a baby as well that's about 15 minutes from us a wonderful african we love the africans i love to see more africans in this church amen they bring a certain spirit and element to the service is necessary in north america if they're here now if you're in uganda the country and coming here because of money can't do it but because they came because a vision of a minister was to have something and he's the greatest pastor in the message and get their children are marrying adulterer they're deacons and their children are they thought they were making a spiritual choice but it wasn't it was financial financial decisions in your life will lead every day does everyone understand that when you make a decision to move somewhere based on finances or friends or family you have made a mistake the only reason you ever move your family to go somewhere else is because they have a good local spiritual head of church a good pastor because your family needs a good pastor if we're going to go in a rapture and our pastor is not william branham or joseph branham if joseph branham is your pastor and you claim that on the internet you need to be able to have his phone number or email because a pastor should be active a pastor should be someone some skin on you can go talk to your pastor about anything and everything this is what the prophet got but see we got we got message ministers great ministers in the message and they're unaccessible people want what you want you'll never grow bigger because you have a vision and that is i'm going to stay with quiet not amongst the people every time i've seen that in a ministry there's been major splits there's been major splits and you know what it is because the pastor did not take time with the sheep help us lord brother to never be a pastor and pastors that will listen to this sir help us what if we've been doing that to change because sheep need smell they need to smell their shepherd they need to be able to text their shepherd i'm going to say it again they should be able to call an email and get a reply not three days later not five days later you're and you say you're busy what if you just told that sheep when you didn't reply it happens every day oh i was busy i was off i never received that email really really but you're sitting on your couch for three hours on your phone and your email is connected to your phone or should be and you never received an email you reply two weeks later i would delete your business emails and make the email whatever it is for your church and make that your main desire because a pastor's one job is to feed the sheep brother dale and if he has a small congregation then he might have to work right that's not bad but make sure brother joshua goff who i was just in texas did anyone know him maybe maybe you've heard of him okay maybe you haven't but um he um foreign possible to have a church people in the message and everyone is in one yes you just have to have team body people around you you have to have people like five sick sinisters that can come together or here's another suggestion i am sorry this is totally not no it's but maybe it'll help somebody that witnessing goat is great it's local but then a church grows why not instead of seven ministers in one church we create seven lighthouses in the local area that is what the message would produce but we've denominated the message we got a paycheck coming in because we got a pastor that's been in the message for 50 years he's got a great reputation and you're lying on that reputation i don't lie on anyone's reputation but jesus christ jesus christ has done something for brother tim i don't need no man i just need jesus money i'll get it from anywhere i need to i don't need bride member giving me money no sir because i know right now there are people that will stream the search that have never heard the name liam branham but that's good hallelujah witness more next slide man that was a long intro so what about the truth we're going to sing this so special as they get it ready i'm sorry we're not going to sing we're going to have it as a special and then we're going to go to the word i'm going to try and keep it short for the deal but we have only one service i want to just make an announcement we have one service in other churches they have and um in cloverdale where i used to go and at my dad's we actually have two sorry at our dad my dad we have two and they last about two hours each so i've done a little bit quick math okay two hours plus two hours equals four hours and we only have one so are you guys ready hold on to your seats we started at ten o'clock and we're going to go to two yeah no i'm just kidding are we ready sister i'm just going to sit over here we'll enjoy this special people say that our gods down [Music] think this faith is alive we can't help that they say this for they do not understand they wander and reason say our jesus was just a man oh but what about the truth [Music] what about the light [Applause] what about the message [Music] is goodness that he's done in your life it's not just some story our god's power is alive there's no purpose god's voice in this day don't you lean to reason for the world's filthy way oh for we have a vision do you believe it this morning there's no power can hold us back just stay faithful with jesus and he'll keep you on track so i ask you [Applause] what about this message still alive think upon his goodness that he's done in our lives it's not just some story [Music] our god's power is alive this is still this is [Music] think about his goodness [Music] hallelujah [Music] our god's power is [Applause] glory give him praise believe amen god's power is alive amen let's turn to the word if you have your scriptures let's turn to our bibles and then we'll have a word of prayer before we read now that we've come to the main part amen but we've already had a good meal if you want to go home you're more than welcome you can stream rest at home if you're kicked back in a recliner you might want to change your position go get a little shirt on a little pants or sister wear a dress clean up your makeup right now because god doesn't want your makeup he said he made you perfect therefore you don't need anything of this world to make you beautiful you need you just need a message and the message we're gonna preach is jesus you can receive that or not but i'm gonna say yes so let's turn in our bibles to luke chapter 1 and we'll have a word of prayer how many are enjoying the god's power in their life if you aren't witnessing the power of god in your life something's wrong one prayer request that came in this morning on my phone brother josiah digavaya his mom is related to the fairs but the danny fair in them he had an accident he didn't have a helmet on hit his head and he's in trauma and unconscious and we're going to pray that god would just touch brother josiah in the hospital right now which goes right in line with what we're going to speak about dr jesus and how he's going to heal everyone's heart this morning amen because that's where we've come so we're just going to pray for brother josiah digavaya brother saya is his nickname if he streams the service or his family we just want to say that we're remembering him in prayer so let's go to prayer right now dear heavenly father lord for how great thou art god it is well with the bride of jesus christ lord politics are of the devil people are changing every day what they believe but god i know in whom i believed i know you're more than able god you're able to touch lies this evening today god i have a barely i ate a little breakfast this morning but i've got all the time in the world lord for one soul i'll pray all day with them i'll talk to them all day for one soul guy i'll pay 380 a canadian to to drive with a man and have three hours to talk to his soul god help us to just change our whole motives our objectives of living in this earth and may we realize the need and know jesus cares right now if every person could just say thank you lord thank you jesus for the josiah digavaya gave his heart to you he was in my church in our church in clarkdale for many years oh god and now the devil's tried to take him out back in line lord jesus and use this for your glory everything that's done in our lives is for a purpose may we recognize what the purpose was in the past may we recognize today there's a purpose for being in this service and maybe we'll receive everything god in jesus name amen amen luke chapter one we're gonna read one verse there and then we're going to turn to luke chapter 4. luke chapter 1 verse 37 says for with god nothing shall be impossible can we say nothing how many have ever doubted god question god raise your hand again just be honest in heart who's ever doubted the message maybe or i had a family member made them try to question the message let's be honest don't be a holier than thou and say i've never questioned anything brother bram spoke come on that's a lying hypocrite okay you read whether you were when you were young and you were like what do you mean by that every single person will have this when they first start out everyone there is nothing you read in the bible you read it and you're like what does revelations mean right but with god nothing shall be impossible luke chapter 4 verse 18 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor how many are poor might have been poor in spirit you might be poor financially god can meet your knee because he's jehovah jireh but people don't have faith in god they have faith in their bank account but tim andy stands here today today telling you last week two or three times i went into dipped into three thousand dollars and my bank account right now is negative 218 bucks and when i get back i have to put money into that account to get it back to positive brother dale that's being honestly true because what is it worth brother matt is brother matthew right what is it worth brother matthew with all this money and what is it worth let me just dissolve insurance if you're standing a long time but i hope it's okay insurance sales you need life insurance let me just tell you right now body care of your wife it's scriptural don't have to worry about your wife you can cancel that tomorrow and start giving that 50 maybe 150 dollars to missions and you might be doing that i have a little life insurance it's 10 bucks and my wife gets a little bit of money if i die praise the lord it's 10 bucks all right but i know life insurance policies people are paying 200 brother branham says you don't need life insurance you need assurance blessed assurance jesus is mine amen you can have your seats as we turn to the scripture for the day malachi 4. we're going to get right down to business malachi chapter 4 we're going to read the whole chapter amen so i hope brother tim isn't overbearing i hope i'm not too long am i brother felix am i too long buddy was i too long last night did you enjoy the service or not okay good we're gonna talk about a few things that are very very sketchy gray areas that people always seem to use to make division in the message the message of the hour and the message of the hour means the message for your day and the message of the hour is now being preached by five full ministers and there's an anointing that comes with the malachi 4 ministry the elijah anointing and any minister that receives what the prophet that prophet that fulfilled this scripture we're going to read they preach that change happens who believes that change happens when you speak the truth who's ever had someone tell them the truth like a dad or a mom or a friend and it hurt raise your hand please it hurt i've had it happen in the last couple months half time not all the time the person well sorry all the time they have your best interest in mind true if they're a real dad a real mom a real pastor they have your real interest in mind but not always are they correct i'm going to say that you need to though submit yourself to god because that's the will of god we want the will of god not the will of man right we want the will of god brother timothy do you want the will of god in your life then not the will of your dad you want god's will for you but that will of god that you have and your brother has and your dad has can be the same hey can i get a name man brothers your children can stay around you and want what you've got i want them to move away moms are like this i don't need my kids to move away my mom's like that she doesn't want me to move you better believe it there's the pastor's wife better believe better stay home jared but that's not bondage because there are times you've got to leave father mother we know that from scripture abraham okay we're going to read this and i'm going to be very very clear today i'm going to try to go a little slower i'm going to try and be more i don't know stand behind the pulpit if i can do that i might have to take my tie off though it's getting hot malachi 4 who's there say amen if you've opened your bible or you're going to look at it in scripture okay i'm going to say something i'm preaching on myself because i recently had to change i brought this and this as my bible for a while and that was wrong it's just easier to carry this and i can say to my wife but i can now need to and this does that help anybody because if your child sees you reading this they get that this news when i'm looking at my bible can i open facebook when i'm reading my bible so don't call me old school preacher and he's so backward 20th century that's 21st century we're living in the 21st century we need to read our bible now let's read our bible malachi 4 verse 1. you know what i don't need my ipad can we do this who wants the holy ghost speak now amen i just we're good we'll get a new one for behold the day cometh that shall burn as and say it so i'm going to need a little participation even the young children when i stop something if you're following if you're listening please say the next word so for behold this is a promise that the lord has given the day cometh that shall burn as an oven let me ask you has the world burned like an oven yet no that wasn't loud enough did we answer the question was i not clear the day cometh that that shall burn as an oven the world has not burned therefore the end has not come therefore let's continue reading and all the proud yea and them that do thank you shelby so if you're doing wicked or you choose like we talked about last night bondage keep reading and the day that cometh that that's future tense shall burn them up has that day burned everyone up brother matthew so any minister that tries to tell you the end is up and in 1977 is a false prophet false ministry leave in jesus name any person preaching already through the tribulation and in the millennium is false all right any person that tells you that grace is over is a false prophet any person that and you want to tell your children you aren't saved because you were born after a certain year you lying devil you've given our children no hope why would they want to serve you you know what that doctrine will do by the matthew all your family will leave your children will never serve that because it's false doctrine false doctrine is what we are against evil places and you will because the bible says it not brother tim i'm not going to read one quote of the prophet today but everything i said is what he said people say you need the profit you all you do if you don't quote random every service not a preacher in the message you liar you've caused a click you don't need to read one you can have people have a relationship it's the truth nothing but the truth brother bran say don't mention me don't play my tapes read your bible go to church listen to your pastor he said if you don't have a local pastor or preacher that our minister church to go to that's preaching truth you go anyhow is that what he said i'm not reading this quote i'm not going to quote i've heard it i believe it and that's what i believe what do you believe i believe that i don't want to be a part of malachi 4 1 where it says those that do wickly shall be stubble no they shall also that day cometh shall burn them up i don't want to be part of that amen who said that the lord of hosts do you know who's going to burn up this is by william branham you can believe it or not he said that that is the proud people like the americans and so forth direct quote malachi 4-1 go home he called them proud and i'm an american it's true americans are very proud do you know someone else that has the same kind of uh spirit that was proud that wanted to be like god satan the devil is proud puffed up therefore be a proud person puffed up and you're going to become what stubble those that lift themselves up will fall any minister in the message that says he has a special gift will fall will prophecy his ministry will fall apart his church will go to nothing actually all of his family will stay with him and the bigger right every generation you have ten six kids we got 20 people 40 people in the church and they're all in the family they get intermingled they get married everyone that's following this man is just family this is not a family religion this is god personally you are i will carry you brother jared wants to meet you matthew he wants your wife married to him and then when you get in a relationship as a single sister with jesus christ he will give you a he will because he promised he would you're not ready that's why you're not married god knows when you're going to be ready so don't get desperate don't get all whipped up in your flesh flesh to have something that you aren't supposed to have you need to watch and pray watch and i don't need this book gonna help some i don't need this book we'll just leave it right there you make the choice what we need is a life read all this you want i've heard people i listen to the seals i never stop 50 out i think what they do sister cutting up every minute in the message cutting up and everyone's bad wrong spirit okay let's bring it down to another level denominational people have the same bible we're reading this morning when they go out of their church why do they smoke why do they drink why do they defile their body because what is written in scripture is not convicting their heart which we're going to talk about dr jesus is going to do a heart surgery this morning for those of us that are here we need a heart transplant i hope you're taking note chris again and take notes and send me any question you have no questions too dumb no questions too hard prophet of god and the bible actually says a minister is to give an ex he is given a question no question is dumb that's what a teacher will tell you to a kid so when we have an adult come to us brother matthew a family member and they're asking questions they're not dumb for asking the questions we shouldn't name oh i don't have time for you because you have a question about william branham's mystery no you know what that person is screaming out brother dale help me understanding i don't do you know what it is maturity they're not mature but they can be mature if someone takes the time to work with them this is hard one put it on the shelf okay it's elf brother brother dale has all these books up on the shelf in his office right brother dale how often do you read those maybe not very much those books right but they're there as a resource to defeat the devil i'm not saying never read the message i'm not saying never read your bible i'm saying if you don't have your bible you don't have the message i'm not preaching from a pad anymore i'm not depending on mechanical devices nothing to preach i don't need it because i have the holy spirit i've read the message i have a minute i have one message book i want to read i want to show you i have my drink here i'm showing you everything here water are we getting somewhere and i had some other things maybe they're in there what's my point in all that why am i saying that what do we believe is wonderful it's rich not everyone that's listening needs to know it all in one day i'm not gonna try and spend a three-hour service today trying to persuade you the message is true i don't need to do that two weeks ago i had someone three people try to force me to have a debate online and have a video conf them and then be given permission to post that on the internet i said i have time to debate anything with you i don't have the time to debate does everyone understand that i said i will even go out coffee with you if you do three things and they won't do any of them what are you stop talking about brother branham take down anything that's negative on facebook about brother branham take away your logo they won't do it brother matthew this is the kind of boldness a believer needs to take not oh they left the message they're poisonous no they're hurting right mr matthew you have a brother hurting doctor jesus can heal a person someone could be a paul bill or saul stone stephen a person in the church about it these people that have started websites to attack the message god's grace and mercy they could be restored that's totally different than what you'll hear from other people totally but you say leave a message i will restore what do you believe your life you say you for your brother is evil of him and we're disappointed in you that's a spirit but brother goes and he goes somewhere by the dale if brother rise up and start a church five minutes from you i'm not to cause division in the church but if brother matthew felt called to start our church five minutes away brother five minutes away brother dale should be saying praise god we're going to support you that's what perry green did that's what brother branham did that's our example we believe a message we do the messenger's life what did he do yes he hunted guess what i don't hunt i'm backslidden i don't like hunting but i like and praise the lord sorry i feel really free and i'm just gonna take a little bit slower i don't have any notes i need my bible though okay let's go to a malachi 4 because we aren't done there we read the first verse i just want to take scripture if you have your streaming i would very much encourage you to open your bible you know what happened i'm going to say this you know what happens in the message malachi 4. let's turn there i don't need a turn there it's become common the message has become common to people the message would become just five dollars worth but one time it was fifty dollars devalued you want to talk about currency going down the message currency in people's lives has gone from 50 to 5. 90 loss and only a true believer the message is christ only those that believe in jesus christ are going to see that 50 and invest the 50 and make it a hundred for the elijah eli elliot come on brother come on up here brother felix and your friend there what's his name cody come on up here let's have you three brothers stand up here as an example this is all just the right so yeah are there felix i want the oldest one here i want the oldest one right here because you're the oldest brother right how old are you 11. okay this is going to help you guys this is gonna help brother cody how old are you and guess what you're all gonna you're all gonna walk away with money today if you want it or we'll have a decision making what you're gonna do with it okay whether felix is nine years old 11 years old 10 years old that means you got to go here brother you're older than him you're more mature right so here's the simple example okay who knows the story of the three talents we're going to get to malachi slowly but surely who knows the talent okay these three young men have been given talents i don't know them from adam i barely know these guys okay your dad knows what you're good at you are good at playing the piano is that correct brother cody what would you say the first thing you're really good at is what's the best thing that you're good at sports anything school you're good at sports okay you got a talent good job brother felix what's your talent farming i wonder why okay well i have a little a little for you okay brother here you go it's only five bucks but there's your talent okay you're gonna stay right there how you doing brother cody i'm gonna give you 20 canadian now he wishes he was in this yeah you're a little bit older than felix so he's going to get 20 canadian oh by the way right now the currency on that is about 70 so you're gonna lose six dollars so you only got 14 bucks in u.s dollars or if we do this that means he got about eight or nine so it's a little closer you're gonna have that in your hand okay you're holding your talent now this brother got more talent than he did correct this brother's church is a little bit bigger than his church praise the lord brother cody you got talent give me five buddy you got more than sports in you though man there's other talents that god's gonna give you all right if you give your heart to jesus he's gonna give you more uh of what you want and desire from him so i'm gonna give you that twenty dollars you got five dollars we're not done the oldest son praise god i'm the oldest too man you know what they say about oldest kids they're usually the richest and wisest of money and they have praise god you know why you know why because they have the most they have the most responsibility they gotta take care of all their siblings now that doesn't always how it works but i felix it doesn't work actually my brother has way more money than me and he's single sister brother eli elliot here you go brother fifty dollars u.s okay now all three of these guys have been given money they've been given a talent they've been now given a ministry and it's different you have a different ministry keep it brother we're gonna get there we're to get there we're going to give you options there's options when you get from god but what you're going to do with it it's your choice it's your choice not daddy's choice what you're going to do with that 50 it's your choice because i gave it to you i was the owner of that property and i'm giving it to you right god is the owner of everything he's going to give it to our children what they have need of if you're making forty thousand dollars right now you need to find a way to make it work if you're making three hundred thousand 000 you are more responsible for what god's given you you're responsible as the oldest child to take care of your siblings and be a good example so mom can sit back in her recliner parade parent at 11 years you show your brother how to do math you show your brother how to have play play baseball or farming and if farming is his thing he can show his older brother how to farm don't worry buddy back in there we're going to give you something too jesus has something for you too don't worry buddy because jesus loves little children we're not done guys jesus loves you guys he died for you guys that's fine right i wasn't baptized till i was 12. do you guys want to afraid that seems really simple doesn't it but let me just tell you what what you need to do if you want to receive jesus in your hearts for you three and any young child out there what are you gonna do is going to say yes to jesus once and it gets a little bit easier but let me also tell you what's going to happen you need to stay in bed that's the devil not brother tim right can you say that's the devil yes he realizes that's the devil right this young man can be a powerhouse for jesus can you say amen can i hear the way amen you can be sitting on the front row taking notes next service if you wanted to amen if you wanted to it's in you but they're elijah elliot that's i think it kind of means the same god wants to use you in the piano so your grandma doesn't have to keep playing she wants to pass it on to you so start practicing she wants to teach him an accordion praise god that's scriptural brother that your grandma will teach you how to do things do you understand his talent will go from 50 to 100 because that's in this man jesus and our two and three-year-old who's right there on our seat not being of active ministers these brothers have money in their account you have more money right now okay dude what are you gonna do with it you don't know save it what would you think you would do but cody spend it save it two savers i didn't tell him to say that like peter says who told you that god his heart do you young folk out of the mouth of babes let every word be established that is what we should do with our money just what he said go give that to your grandpa that's what you're supposed to do that's scriptural he doesn't need to tell you what he's going to do with it it's his now right now with brother dale he's a little bit older and more mature he could take that 50 and then make it 300 and then he could there's 50 next day so i'm going to go to a and this might help you when you start and you're making millions of dollars remember me no i'm just kidding brother you know you're farming you're working for jesus brother felix best farmer that's brother cody what do you think you might want to be when you grow up you might not be it but what do you feel like right now if you were to start working he wants to be a farmer too these guys could work together and make twice as much man there's something in this family this is wonderful he already knows what he wants to be it can change we know that it can change but they're coaching brother felix just found out you're farmers start working what do farmers do work hard they wake up early right they sweep the poop i cut lawns not a bob i trim i get dirty i spend my days working hard just like my dad just like your dad right you only got five bucks and your brother sitting over he got 50. do you know what's going to happen jealousy the younger brother is why did the bigger brother get more than me that's not what you want right brother felix we don't want that spirit brother brother cody god loves you so much he gave you 20 bucks today you're gonna save that money i want you to keep it okay but i want to say one thing about this young man you said the i didn't tell you though same thing happened in africa i gave one guy one dollar the next guy sat there okay thank you right back to a seat the next guy got a 20 bill and he's like oh my good thank you a little more energy then i pulled out 100 and gave it to a brother and guess what he did hallelujah [Applause] thank you jesus you know what his testimony was i needed a bible and i didn't have a bible and i bought a bible hallelujah it's a good thing you brothers did awesome okay now you're gonna keep your five dollars and make it 10. okay or you do whatever you want okay you don't have to pay ties on this it's a free offering thank you give them a hand [Applause] see what you'll find in children is they actually can speak volumes to an app three a whole message see that's the kind of preaching we need we don't need a guy standing up here for two hours you need to be saved william branham is the pride and if you don't receive him you're going to hell and basket that's what people are preaching today if you don't have a long skirt get out of our church if you have a slit right now get saved and move on go somewhere else i'm being serious this is what's going on in the message you aren't in the message the price the message is the love perfect love casts out some fear come on church we need to be a church that's lively that responds to the word because a dead church you can have your dead church sat in them and they're big congregations they've got a canadian spirit american spirit and they'll be part of malachi 1 but thank god i'm not part of malachi 1 because i have roots where are your roots or are you moving around every six months every two years because i'm a businessman and i want capital gains to be avoided so i i move every two years with my family really how's that going for you brother i bet your wife is stressed out of her brain why don't you sell all the businesses the houses you have buy a little rv do something for jesus i'm not saying sell all you have don't get me wrong well we've had those in the message the the capture it has to happen the moon is lined up this is happening right now here it is come on who's heard on the internet you've heard it false prophets they lead people they they make them hope and they make them say you gotta sell it all only one thing god asks you to do change and art let dr jesus brother cody and work on your heart hi back jesus is cutting on your heart praise the lord praise the lord he's working jesus is working now and now the spirit of life is going to come in the church the spirit of revival is what i believe is nothing but the truth and if you believe it's the you will preach energy you will preach dynamics not just a dead pew say you're a message believer and you're going to hell to hell are you ready to go do you know what your dad believes really know what your dad believes come on little girls don't know why they wear dresses or expect me tell them why don't be ashamed tell them why we don't cut our hair and if i cut my hair give them a testimony and say mom he didn't know it was wrong to cut my hair but now i know because i met jesus and his word says that if a woman shaves her she is you finish it go read your bible spirit spirits but i want to say today this scripture is fulfilled if you wanna 1965-0125 read this message don't listen to any critic about brother branham and you will find we're now seeing that scripture has been promised the fire falls to burn it up like today seeing scripture right before our eyes how many recognize scripture before our eyes guess what they're gonna do mockers and scoffers what are they mocking the seventh seal vision saying the seventh seal has not been opened is a lie it's open because the message the seal through that message that was preached is what thank you brother dale it's christ so to say any part of the cell does not open denies christ which denies the power that comes with the message that brother preach and the message is christ nothing less nothing more anything more to cry dead it's not jesus william branham it's jesus with the revelation of who he is igniting something within the bride saying i love you god many things take it out of us we let our business we let family i had them this weekend texting me all the day long i just put my phone block them to this weekend they're just taking up my time they're trying to fill my mind with doubt i love them but hey you're you're wasting my time so i want to bring a balance okay there's a time when a person comes to a pastor and comes to you as a brother right and says you know what i don't understand the message we need to fly where you gotta go go to vancouver island go where you gotta go and say i'm taking three days off i'm taking a weekend i flown here that will preach to him already a message you care about him jesus cares about him and if jesus cares about you the question this morning is do you actually care about your soul a lot brother cody do you want to go to heaven brother cody yes so how is our child supposed to go to heaven hear truth follow tim andes no follow dale langstaff follow brother eddie biskell follow tim pruitt donny reagan no follow william branham follow christ that when i say that statement i've done this i made it two separate things that's not what i said this is my shotgun and i needed this to line up in the word to be my scope to shoot the devil without this you don't have accuracy that is the message what i believe you need the bible every believer christian on this earth every human needs to read this book in this world but they need this to line up with the word brother branham says if i preach anything outside of the word you call me a false prophet and i'm he also says that he not pray for anybody until the angel of the lord came who believes that brother branham depended on the angel of the lord some of us that's the message there's people that don't believe that they say they're in the message they think he's a great man of god malachi 4. let's go there malachi 4. we know in whom we have belief do you know in whom you have believed how many believe jesus cares about him you go to the doctor jesus today and he's going to have a prescription talk it's a minute you need to take it i just stepped on african people's toes because they don't even go into doctors my says doctors are good my doctor says a doctor can help you you might even believe right now you need to go to a doctor you need to go to a doctor dr jesus but see i want to ask you a question have a family problem and a sickness in the home the first person you need to go to is jesus the great physician we sing about it right the great physician now is here the sympathizing jesus but we don't go to him he's great physician we never want him to help us we never want to come to a service where it cuts and says there's a problem we need to do a surgery and this morning i'm not doing an arm surgery i'm not doing a leg branham says again you can go look up he says people need surgery on their they need unbelief removed and faith put into their heart that's what he said so you have unbelief in your heart if you have unbelief what does that lead to attributes of sin smoking drinking lying committing adultery all those things are just attributes they're not sin this is what i believe do you believe it any person that streams a service if they actually listen to the whole thing and they believe it they should share it it's not my path though it's not my minister i'm listening to it i don't know if i agree with it that's fine you do what you want with jesus there's only one jesus it's not brother branham's jesus it's not paul's jesus preaches any jesus he's not of god this is bible you need to read your bible you can only stay with a minister you know your bible and you know the message because you're so used to well our pastor has to read volume page six paragraph 40 are we all together i'm going to wait cause we all printed it out for you today you're still you're so used to as a pastor push play and obey yeah i push play and obey too but i don't push play and collect tithes that's anti-word your pastor is someone that's active that can pray with you that can work with guy we're getting there lord say man don't pay man if you're not hallelujah is the lord let's keep reading we're going to just move into another gear second part because we got three parts no i'm just kidding change our our position are we ready for part two okay so we're at the end of malachi 4 1 it says and they shall leave them neither root nor branch that means everything will be destroyed that's simple math i mean not math english let's read verse 2 if you're following along please that afraid of god we're not afraid of him like a fear like afraid we're feeling that means we have respect there's a difference so a person can see f-e-a-r and they know the english language here but it doesn't have the same meaning so an african rule we'd fear and think it says we fear god we fear what brother branham says and we're afraid that's not what it's saying it's saying fear god and have respect for his name shall the sun is prophecy again every every scripture is prophecy brother branham says if you don't read your bible and see christ in curses you need to go back and read it again yes all right how many believers i'm going to say what i believe i believe that was the healing campaigns of william branham healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up and be calves of the stall you will become mature and you'll go from healing in your wings you'll be healed and restored to now grow up and be mature believers so that when the prophet dies you don't die when the prophet's healing over you don't just follow a man because of his healing you follow him because what he preached brought life it brought change and if change isn't coming in a service we are preaching something off because change needs to happen change is hard but change is necessary to take a body change change is hard but change is necessary to take a body change you must change today if you're looking at an iphone don't have your children look at iphones period take it out let's do it for one week if you're letting your children look at it bad this is what i do if my kid acts up one time i say you're not getting an ipad do i let him look at ipads whether or not or let him watch a little something if he's good yes 15 20 minutes bible character stories that's fine but did i step up those brother branham did brother branham went to a a show what the prophet yeah he had a chris what yeah but salvation issue you can't have a christmas tree and people can't have a christmas tree in their house splits in the message [Music] you want and did say things about christmas trees then is earlier he's true even after he said don't make it a pagan worship we don't bow down to the christmas tree anyone had a pumpkin in their house as a decoration anyone ever had let's see uh well what do you do here um you know what i'm saying right anyone have lights in there i know the pastor does he has a little towel you decorate your house a tree is just a little decor i can have a plant in my house is that going to make me go to hell brother matthew but people preach that in the message in the met they believe brother brown's a prophet and they tell people you will go to if you have a christmas tree and you can't come to our church because you have a tree in your house can everyone say this for me that's dumb that's dumb that's silly let's say silly that's silly nonsense let's keep reading he's wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of my feet you that believe william branham had healing in his wings you that receive a prophet will receive a what come on though he will see prophets reward that's what i'm trying to we need to realize if we tread down we're going to tread down the wick we're going to sit down soon for they shall be ashes under the soles of our feet nothing you know what let's speak you know what he's going to shizz you will be ashes and you say william brandon was a prophet too by the way because you've deceived yourself this is hard word but it's true this is the truth this is what i believe what do you believe you might not your pastor might not agree with something i'm saying i don't know unless he does everything but there's things that are preached in a church i am a evangelist right now i can drop my atomic bomb and guess what tomorrow i am gone my atomic bombs aren't to split churches to cause division because that's directly against the bible i am to edify and uplift the body if you walk out of these services this weekend and think brother tim is trying to make you leave the message you're sadly you are mistaken the whole goal is to lift up jesus christ which is the message remember law moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horab for all can we say all israel with the statutes and judgments right there in laodicea they shut down because if they were in moses's day it would have been what all law and judge our prophet is a judge moses i'm talking about he's a judge but you had to have a revelation that moses was the judge he was the final say which is what a prophet is and if you didn't believe him right sister if your husband didn't believe that moses was the prophet guess what would have happened to your little girl in the wilderness in egypt in the world we know that's a type of the world what would have happened your daughter would have died but you know what's happening people are not applying the token jesus christ on their heart and they will die let's have our seats and we're going to read the final two verses who knows the final two verses by heart without raise your hand if you know the final two verses of malachi 4 by heart i do is anyone else probably if you don't praise god brother my but i sure know the author real well i think from there we can get a hearty amen on that one your pastor might not be able to read but at least he knows i'd rather have a pastor that knows jesus and doesn't know how to read than someone so intellectual that they're feeding intellectual garbage in the message of the hour because they take their intellect and they try and certainly say we're going to try and political political but i'm going to be very plain this is what i believe the original bible is the faith that has been delivered to us through a prophet right here promise and behold i will send you who it does not say william branham it says elijah an anointing of elijah the before when just hope just wait you're getting ahead before what the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord oh but i thought that this is what they'll tell you in the world oh but that's meaning john the baptist and that means jesus no no no no no no no look at the verse i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord as far as i know right now it's not dreadful and we go back to verse one it's not burning the world has not been consumed therefore we're not in a tribulation read a prophet's message you will not die be atomic bomb drop in this so we heads up pie when we go out here i don't have to read the news about russia i already know what's happening in russia without reading the news i already know what's happening in israel right now people are going back to their homeland i don't need the news to tell me that i need a prophet that had a vision that could happen and this prophet william branham saul the jews will gather in their home will be 144 000 12 000 from every tribe he saw the catholic church will bail out america mark my words i am saying a false thing it will not happen thus saith the lord it will it's a vision that prophet not tim he's not saying that william branham said thus saith the lord you start hearing i want to say names but i'm going to hold back and not say names with a dale but let me just see this bro tim i'll call him because his name is tim on the on the video it's not to manny's brother tim that went into this service you and your little wisdom sitting in your home telling lies to people about the bible some of you don't know what i'm talking about but that's good i'm talking to brother tim who's going to listen you doubt her you unbeliever you skeptic once walked in truth and now you say you have the truth but you're mocking something you left i want to tell you brother tim in all grace and sincerity you need to realize your heart needs a surgery and what you're speaking is not growing families it's not making them go on with jesus it's making them doubt and in your own life you know this you have been divorced two or three times this is what's going on you want to know what's really going on this is happening right now and people are listening to that man and his name is tim and my name is tim you can have two men with the same name sitting in the same church 15 years ago and now we've gone completely different ways i'm way younger than he is and he has way more money than me and he i'll never have as much money as he has doesn't matter because the prophet of god said money will get you every time what's the next so he wants a popularity and a following therefore he needs the message and attack it because there's a following in the message take the message out of his preaching and attacks of ministers in the gospel he has nothing to preach what do you believe tim what do you really believe you say you love god and you love christians and you have a christian spirit but you're what you mean is not love come on rod i'm speaking now jesus my name by the dale he said judas has forsaken me he called his name right in scripture he cleopas has forsaken me right i'm going down paul had friends leave him he didn't bash he didn't criticize them what did he do loved them what did brother branham do love them what is tim anders going to do as a minister love them and i'm humbly saying malachi 4 5 says i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord that is uh can we all say promise god does not lie how many believe god does not lie if god does not lie his word is true find yourself in scripture this is where we are verse 6 this is the whole message today what do i believe verse 6 he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children that is john the baptist and conjunction word that means there's now a separation i'm a teacher okay conjunction i'm not a dummy tim not a dummy it says and and the heart of the children to fathers those that have gone before us we are all children here today in christ we have grown up in maturity now our hearts are being turned lest oh now this is a key because i just i've been really digesting this brother dale lest so what's going to happen the heart of the children to their fathers that must happen lest i come and smite you need to look up what lest means do a little study test because people are like oh yeah i don't know if you're seeing what i'm seeing what lest means lest i come and smite the earth that means god is gonna smite the earth if that doesn't happen what it's on there the heart of the children to their fathers he promised that elijah ministry would come with an anointing okay that can be any man right anyone anyone they can say they have an elijah ministry isn't there ministers right now that say they have an elijah ministry false false they're not in the message by the way they don't believe brother brown is a prophet but i'll tell you right now he's in africa a brother he's an african and he says he's elijah he's not in the message i want to be clear on this he believes he's a prophet okay do you want me to tell you exactly what he's doing reading this without anyone knowing and using the same things the prophet spoke elijah is his name go look him up no don't look them up you don't have to look them up any person that's profit lying about america right now they've read the prophet i was just looking recently at the devil and attack on the message trying to attack uh ministers in the message okay personal and open because it's public they attacked brother reagan about preaching to children about money and tithe and they mocked him and said he's a million dollar pastor that's what the devil is saying to people okay that is a pastor can have millions of dollars if he wants to half the church believes that brother deal half your church believes that you can have a million dollars you better not have a million dollars just kidding let me just say something the bible says that a man of god deserves half honor no double double honor so if my pastor listen to me real good in canada is not making two hundred thousand dollars because a hundred thousand dollars if he has a family is what you need to make it now let's bring it down to 50 okay because we're in we're in a different country province let's just say for a young couple you need 40 or 50. okay a pastor should make six digits to be able to provide for his family to be able to help others okay i'm just giving this i'm not saying this is the way brother dale but i'm just opening people's eyes to the reality because my dad is a pastor and he was a minister guess what my dad does in the middle of it oh you needed me to come to the hospital you need me to come and then the car that's my dad people that are listening to the servers every one of you know my dad he'll wake up in the middle of night he'll text a person he'll call them take them out for coffee drop everything for one soul that's why but then matthew said gave me testimony that my dad talked to him personally right by the math and helped counsel that's a real heart of a shepherd brother dale will take you out for coffee spend time with you but as soon as a pastor gets so out of touch with his people he can't preach nothing that will help them because you smell like the sheep felix i gotta know what a nine-year-old is thinking i've got to know what a 11 year old is thinking that's william branham's message it's simplicity so simple that the elect not the elected intellectual cannot receive it those that want their psychology books have your psychology i did human development psychology and i will tell you it does not work i did it in educational school they make you take two classes in psychology brother matthew they'll tell me how to run my family their way they'll tell you that you should be giving your child little fun things to do about every hour like ipads and give them 10 minutes 20 minutes make it a little bit longer longer it's educational for kids to have screen time that's teaching in schools it's not educational for them to have screen time it's diseducationing them it's causing their brain to free fraud my gatorade isn't done that's what the donnie reagan had and i've got my ibuprofe in case my back acts up devil so you can't beat me now see ibuprofen just a little thing like that someone could say you have unbelief you don't believe god can heal you i believe it he has been healing me over the last year i'm god for god's glory i was supposed to get a steroid injection in my back because just took a scan and they said because i was having shooting pain i had a disc bulge and my dad had the same thing and it hit his nerve and my nerve and it was going pained up down my leg i sat and i had it all set up the appearance it was going to cover it the steroid injection and i said you know yes what do you believe jesus cares for you doctor jesus care so he went to prayer i went to prayer i got desperate before i had a back anyone ever had a back issue anyone have financial trouble my hands raised but my eyes all my knees by tuesday i'll have 20 000 in the lord and i'm going to keep it in brother dale i'm going to give it out i'm going to my workers better i'm going to give back to the community that aren't believers i'm gonna cut tell someone about jesus and pay for their five dollar coffee that's the message that i believe that's the gospel news that's good news and brings hope deliverance builds trust all right i need another person brother jared can you come up here brother we're going to get to verse 5. we read all malachi right we read malachi how many believe that brother uh malachi 4 5 is a fulfillment and has been fulfilled today part it's not done because it says the world's going to be destroyed has the world been destroyed yet so let me just be very simple and plain for everyone to understand brother jared your boys receive salvation your boys still have grace grace is not over grace has been extended when trump impressed really interesting when donald trump became president it gave us four years of grace because he stood on some biblical principles homosexuality is not okay for your children right we need more men we need a voice in the community that's not right my friends will not be going into public places with girls and boys in the same bathroom that's perversion for the jared i needed you here to say amen support let your boys see this all right no you're no you're still here you're still here you're not done bro you're gonna stay i love your socks i don't think i've ever been to a church where the songwriter wears socks and no shoes lord brother simplicity you're not wearing a rule you know what i'll do something else i'll break another rule praise the lord brother and my caller is up mercy i better put that down now we're now now now i feel see that's what you got to do come down to their level this is good preaching i hope it's good preaching it's the gospel and now brother jared and me have fellas jared many years ago we met each other is that correct as friends we haven't been together for years right but as soon as we came together we were happy why because there was a connection a supernatural connection a divine connection do you know what connected us the message of jesus christ if there's no message brother tim is not here today that's right yeah if there's no message of the hour preached by brother branham we're not here in fellowship the message caused fellowship between two brothers god bless you brother amen let's give the lord a hand boring fellowship it's boring lives hey man i believe it we're getting down somewhere remember i don't have notes the time is right here 12 o'clock we're good we're good we've got plenty of time let me just say some football game days that's three and four hours and feel it a hundreds of how much money did you spend this month get the second row seat brother matthew how much did you pay to see how much did you pay today oh i have to prize it so hard [Music] really they'll spend four or five hundred dollars sometimes a thousand a day for their drinking and alcohol i'm preaching now you know what they're doing you know what they're doing where is it oh here it is i wanted to do this right they brother felix look at that man chase business unlimited that's my business account praise god it's it's getting paid off this week travel rewards you see that bank of america praise god that's my wife's because i didn't have lowe's credit well it's not a credit card it's like a you get a discount this is like a crep yeah okay this one's not even active so i know what we're gonna do this is ten thousand dollar limit nothing's gonna hurt me what i'm gonna do right now right i'm not gonna peel over and die this is all you gotta do you have a problem with this go home right now and just go like this you might need scissors to make it faster sister your spending problem at the mall is your problem oh here we go yeah here it comes here's the old and new testament the two-sided sword oh my you say brother tim you're not slicing and dicing the words i am slicing and dicing the word i'm taking the old and new testament which is my cutting sword and i'm cutting up my old belief that i need a credit card i cannot use this card brother matthew anymore i just lost ten thousand dollars in spending power no i didn't i just got free that feels good i just gotta keep cutting man it's under my jesus that satan has been defeated because debt is demon drugs is a demon drugs can kill you you can overdose on drugs dr jesus though isn't giving you drugs he's giving you a gospel helpless saints okay i'm going to be very very open help me god this is all for the glory of god a couple years ago i went through a strike time in my life this is my testimony if you want to clip this out you can clip it out and put it on the internet brother tim's testimony being raised in the message i was raised in a home that loved the lord i was raised in a home that stood for truth i had to find out if it was true myself i couldn't just believe it was true but as i grew up i knew no i wish you could say you know when i got that first call from the lord that i just answered it right away yes god i want to do what you say i didn't happen for me raised in the message right raising the message of the hour preached by the my parents believed that my grandpa believed it i had to believe it okay this is my testimony you can post this if you want on the internet this part um i grew up went to bible way as my home church but the biscuit dedicated me was i was born when we moved out to indiana my open and honest when i was a young boy i saw my dad serving my grandpa serving that's just what i saw okay then we moved to tennessee and i started having memories my dad was pastor at 21 i believe to 24 he was a pastor and he got a church the minister had taken all the tithes and offerings in the message okay and left the church with nothing after dad started traveling from indiana and he started doing that work for a little bit on his own i don't remember that but then i do remember going to tennessee living there for three years doing um up till so i would have been like two to four ish almost five went there and dad was a pastor at 21 young man i want to say for that young men can be pastors in the message any minister that says you can't do it is not of god it's not god in that man telling you you need to wait 10 years to show yourself approved no find a good pastor like i did sit under that master my dad was my pastor then we moved to ron peterson's in 1997. we were there for three years dad was an associate minister to brother braun existing so you're looking this kind of goes in hand with my dad okay when he is in 2000 february march he felt called to come back to brother biscuits because of the vision that he had to get the gospel out okay you guys ever want to see why tim anders is standing here today because of decisions that were made the choice you make brother matthew for your wife and kids will affect you in five years ten years so what you're doing today brother timothy with your wife is going to affect you guys in five years from now if the lord tarries okay as we grew up we went on vacations we spent time together as a family i'm just saying this for a reason help somebody my dad never had money to his name never i didn't know the financials until one day when we were um growing up my had done after all he was doing some real estate with some believers in the church trying to you know make it make ends meet making twenty four thousand dollars i'm being open and honest twenty to thirty thousand dollars he was doing night and then trying to pitch a little bit from two to thousand 2003 ish or so three years he had a call and felt brother biscuit to tell brother biscuit i want to have a ministry and be able to help more in the church is that possible and that happened to be then when the biscuit felt there was a need and he had my dad at a young age 30 years old or so had him helping the church because brother bischool realized if the church is going to grow he's going to need other men in the church right brother dale you can't be a one-man ministry so then brother john andes my father and was doing that i as a young boy went to bca which is a christian school okay we could that and i'm not going to say who but somebody paid for us to go to see from grade one all the way till i went to grade nine my dad couldn't afford it is the man that coming against the message and then for years when he left then there was a couple where dad didn't know what was going to happen because he stopped giving to go to bca and then the pastor paid for us to go there i'll be open and honest because the pastor saw and deposited eternal deposits in then when i went and decided to go to college in 11th grade i'd be ready was it easy no during that time as soon as i went to college this is my testimony i noticed a spiritual lack in my life in the message in the right home i got a car though i felt free sorry if that was too loud free this is my testimony i felt free i felt happy because now i had my own car i could go to school i all day my dad though he wasn't restrictive he left what we want to do i think every day for my dad but i talked to him maybe sometimes and he said to forgive he asked for forgiveness if he was too loose and i said dad don't ask for forgiveness about that but but i i made the choice i was 16. but i'm just helping somebody to know how my father was to me so maybe it'll help you treat your child a certain way my dad was not a micro manager what are they doing where are they um um how long have you been on your my dad never did and by the grace of god he said now you're a man you're 16 you're going to college my brother was 13 years old when he started going to college with me we both got our two-year associate 18 years old he got his mba at 17 or 18 and i went on to be a teacher failed this is going to help you kids okay but tim failed a psychology class three times to get into the teaching program failed i went 12 weeks and failed 12 weeks failed finally third time i passed let me tell you something i used my teaching degree for two years at bca and i'm not a teacher anymore do i regret be getting my teaching degree no this is my testimony god just kept kept me and then because i was a teacher there became a stress in my i'm just going to be open and honest there became a stress in my life of finance because i wasn't i was giving i was giving i was giving i'm working for the school i'm doing a work for god like god bless like help me god right never prayed that before i'm trying to do what's right i'm trying to do what's right but by the time you took out the taxes in canada and the exchange rate the currency rate i was making twenty four thousand dollars a year a month two thousand dollars another one coming go look it up washington state that is over two hundred and fifty percent poverty level it was an avoidable should have been avoided in one simple conversation but it did not happen and i stressed out i lost sleep and i could have lost my family by the grace of god amazing grace jesus christ said no you're my son he gave me a wife that could have walked out on me that's what i believe that's the message i believe that will let your wife stay with you when it gets rough not compromise and give up on you and say i don't even know you because you're such a bad provider why so guilty of that saying you can't provide for me i want to go on vacation three weeks i want to i want to i want this i want a car stressing out your husband my wife didn't do that i stressed myself out because i was trying to serve god i was trying to serve people you know what i didn't realize brother dale i was sacrificing my family that sacrifice i'm not talking about behind a pulpit if you sacrifice for your church or you sacrifice in anything and you sacrifice your family you've lost everything don't give thousands and thousands of dollars to a church if you don't have a dollar to your name and you got debt this is my testimony okay i'm going to say something i've never said this publicly i miss wedding because i was in a hospital no one knows that i miss my own sister's wedding i was supposed to be the best man at that way and i just had to be in the mental ward they didn't find nothing wrong with me because it wasn't a physical problem it was a spiritual imbalance that had happened in my life i got my priorities out of line i've never said that i miss my own sister's wedding i came out and i had to borrow money from my brother i didn't have a job for six months how do you think i felt brother matthew how would you feel pretty low and in that moment satan came curse god curse this message and i'm here as a testimony to say i'll never curse malachi 4. the message is true but that's what i've gone through you say i've got it hard i know i've had it hard but someone's had it harder you know hardest the next thing that happened after i came out of that mental institution was i had to go to doctors with my wife who's a nurse and i didn't want to go they gave us ten of these ten they said you need to take all these different kinds sums up something's wrong with you and i'm trying to sit there and tell them yeah i know something's wrong i'm not right where i had to be with god and they're thinking because they're using science so in their science was like oh no you have bipolar devil i don't have bipolar in the name of jesus tim anders has been delivered of any spirit of bipolar but you can label it what you you've you've got geography jesus can set you free this day this scripture is fulfilled but as i sat in the doctor not once every week reminding me that i was a failure that's the devil going and having to sit down when i didn't want to be there my family's telling me to be there everyone's telling me i need to be that loved me and i didn't want to listen to him that's for the team andy's here i am am i still alive am i still serving i still have a wife yes that time i had no i had my first child third child liberty grace candies and she's buried today and one day i'll see her again that's what i believe that's what i've to believe what do you believe you believe this message isn't true this message is nothing but the truth it delivers life it saves lives if you have stress in your family cut up the credit cards restore love take your wife out for a date you're out for a weekend pay three hundred dollars a day a babysitter have to come on saints come on saints we don't need more preaching we need more speaking and coming down to the ship this is not just talking that's why we can have young children still fake i'm not trying to say brother tim is great and that's why we're listening is interesting the children it's keeping them awake because they they're like whoa this guy actually means something like this is something i want this is the best two i could ever spend because you'll go to a baseball game and spend two hours clap shouting a man you're sitting there like a dead beat what's this guy gonna tell me today he can't change me yeah i can change you only jesus can change you can i get an amen so i had 10 of these brother matthew by the grace of god my wife had the holy ghost said no no no no five of those are addictive we are not going to take those we walked away and we tried one it caught it the it caused the worst side effects in my life okay we listened to the doctor because brother brown said listen to your doctor they didn't know what was wrong with me my wife didn't even know what was wrong with me so we're just going to try this okay so we tried one i'm getting somewhere because we're not to there we're over here so these five are wrong we're going to try this we tried it for a couple days bad body bit we're moving on next one try another one moving on next one moving this is my testimony in the message my whole life never went out completely into the world but i still had struggles right i've still gone through battles in my life right how many of you gone through battles how many of you had to take pills how many of you had to take pills before it's not a bad thing i've had to take pills i'm still taking pills it's not a bad thing nope okay but i took one two three okay side effect side effect side effect about a year ago um about a year after i should say this financial stress happened in my life with working at the bpa that job then six months later my brother offers me a job right at the beginning of kova to become a skate pushing a lawn mower and i'm gonna have to drive 50 minutes one way to work you know what my mind says no way jose but i didn't have a job this is the second time by the way i forgot to mention that this is the second time i've gone to the not sorry the second time i've gone like no work and six month break two times it happened in my life four or five six months okay this is this is my testimony so uh in march 2020 this is tony's with tim andes um 2020 we started working okay i was doing everything working driving i had 12 hour days it was good for me i was working hard i got back into activity i was working 60 70 out and by the grace of god i didn't have a breakdown boo devil boo devil devil has no right on my property so i started working hard putting myself in business for a year work my brains out okay this is my testimony 21 for the first year wonderful we made 170 000 and i did that with one other guy for two months i'm open and ominous there's nothing to hide here okay 170 profit okay so by the time i did all my driving thing i made maybe 50 grand which is not terrible it's way better than what i was making right what i'm saying but i'm saying this all for a reason only forty fifty thousand dollars first year okay but i continued to have patience and the next year i said mike let's get two more bucks and i want to buy the business the grace of god i was able to get a loan that got me the business okay so then the next year it's my business now and now i'm going to do what god wants me to he said hire four or five people this is what god told me to do hire five people did this and we had the amazing couple of months brother dale we've ever i've ever experienced forty thousand a month i was like oh my goodness gonna be a great year but we're gonna do so much for god i did i thought i was gonna be out of the field in 2021 and guess what happened i went one weekend away to preach at brother brad burgess's in kentucky and you know what i said brother dale i said the devil when i get back and i have to go this was one person i'll still serve god guess what happened when i got back i tested my faith does jesus care for me yes did he know it was best brother jared for me so i went back i lost the main guy he walked off the job another guy the third guy quit because he was smoking marijuana and the fourth girl said i'm done in november i was literally gonna be back by myself in three months right what i had preached the devil was testing me sister brother matthew the devil will test your faith the devil has faith hasn't even taken our faith very good why faith mom dad why is he testing you to see what kind of character you have are you going to pass the test felix the test is not math 1 plus 1 equals 2. 3 times 3 is 9. a plus b equals a squared b squared who cares i mean i'm a teacher my kid does not need to know something about some guy that was born 1200 years ago it's a historical fact it is important but make it relevant for the day we can learn about george muller and what he did and let's make it real today right about william branham historical fact he was a healer jesus christ was the healer through him every this in denominations that god glorified in william branham's life therefore anyone that tears down the message preached by william branham or his character is antichrist because he glorified jesus christ say amen what do you believe oh i believe that pills are bad for you and i still know i don't need this but if i can take l a m o t r i g i n e lam i can't even pronounce this lamo trigin 25 milligram

side effects whatsoever brother matthew from this now this one i have for a reason this one is called a sleeping pill anyone ever taken a sleeping pill before oh praise the lord we have some people that have never taken sleeping pills good my mom was very much against pills she was actually on my side when all this went down and she's like jessica he really shouldn't be taking pills he needs to get off the pills thanks mom if you're listening lorazepam okay it's lowest dose okay but when i take this if i need it for sleep it says as needed i have not taken this in six months boo devil and you know what i really want to do is take these pills and flush them down the toilet but i'll let them sit in the counter just to remind say a preacher service and have them all lined up and we're gonna go devil because he thought he had me he thought a pit and it wasn't a pill that seemed it was the gospel i needed to realize my finances aren't important they shouldn't be preeminent in my thoughts come on saints you got to be with me now i'm going to start preaching right now for 10 minutes give me 10 minutes and say amen and if you believe it if you believe it you got to receive it you don't need credit go to heaven then what are you doing with your big bank account what am i with this next storm broker two different real estate agents cards because i can go talk to them about business and slip in they need jesus do i need them no i can rip them up right in front of you oh here's a check that's the lawn care 406 on the back i've already deposited it i don't need it but what what is making you a person happy is a check think about it brother if you receive a million dollar check today what are you going to do not a biggie no maybe it maybe it isn't for you i don't know there's a lot of zeros we're going to bahamas that's what i want to be right now where i was nine years ago when i got married to my wife and we went to bahamas for our honeymoon paid for by the way bought her a nice ring fifteen hundred nineteen hundred dollars paid for god whole thing was three i'm saying this for a reason whole wedding was three thousand dollars because all the believers brought some food brother this self says publicly that is a model wedding for a believer in the message to have [Applause] which i take very much humility and thanks that brother biscuit would say that um he would take that and note we had it outside brother dale it wasn't in a church what you're breaking all codes man i'm breaking all codes right now no tie no suit and i can preach the gospel on a sunday morning i'm breaking on your denominational ideas that are but i don't need ibuprofen anymore in jesus name i don't need to take this anymore stop taking it because i'm not going to let this ruin my marriage do you understand my my wife has the holy ghost she can tell you when you're out of step because she has the holy ghost if she's telling you you're going what are you doing that's good that's a good thing you have a good wife for the jury that stops you on the back and says what do you do giving way too much money and you can't even take me out for coffee [Laughter] so when a wife starts slapping you back you're supposed to say thank you for needing to do this more i'm preaching myself i need to say you know what you're right how many are thankful that we have a message this is my testimony today three children that have three that will be in heaven i i have six kids over there so tell me i need more kids because i don't because well brother you're supposed to have a big what is it called a bunch of uh clip yeah quiver full you know that message right brother you should never take birth control oh bondage you've bound young family and a couple and they go to one sister and it's it's okay and the other sister saying oh no if you do that you're anti-bible you've got two opinions of two people in a church and now that sister that's just gotten married and wants some counsel a godly counsel is confused what's he going to turn to brother dale the internet and the internet becomes people's bible the internet becomes their absolute and the last five minutes i want to anchor down what i believe i believe the bible from genesis to revelations who believes it with me i mess that god sent a prophet how many believe that with me and this is what i believe it produces a life that cannot be argued with do you believe it then i am fulfilling scripture today we just read six verses in malachi i can see in those six verses who the prophet is and who i am where i am and where i don't want to be now when you read your body you define where you are brother dale where this sister in the back little boy in the back what's up brother how you doing would you ever want to play this in the church maybe one day there's a reason why i just did that it totally changes a person's attention and focus and now they're focused on i'm going to say something really important buddy when you get a little bit older read this proven his god-divided place of worship i'm not ashamed you've got a service without it being his will and if you can't read it listen to it if you don't know how to read listen spiritual food in due season what is track the god of this evil age people read all sorts of books i was telling brother dave do two hours of studying for every credit you do in college that's what they they say you should do that means if you do 15 class 15 credits 15 hours of learning that you need to do 45 hours of studying minimum outside of school do you know what they just did they made you have a 60 hour work week and you make zero dollars and by the way you pay money for it right by the deal if you read these three four five six praise the lord seven messages and read them for 45 hours in a week what do you think would happen you would not come in here depressed down i am life is so miserable i don't have a husband and i'm 21. really just because whether tim got married at 20 doesn't mean you got to get married at 20. my wife is 22 i mean every the message needs to be 22 or 23. okay god has a correct spouse the right guy the serpent every girl every girl will have a serpent before adam every girl she will you better not accept the serpent you say no to the serpent and then adam will come but you must believe i am eve but i'm not deceived you must believe i am rebecca going to see my unseen bridegroom how many believers do we have this is what i believe god's working on our heart now i believe jesus christ saves amen how many to believe jesus christ is the resurrection the truth and the life and what he has done on calvary is enough it's enough for my family it's all i need i don't need money i don't need popularity women i've got my one wife i don't need two i don't need four god help me if i had two i have double the i'd have to have a big vehicle the two girls say something wouldn't be able to live in the same home because they got two different opinions of how to run the home two different ways of how to cook two different ways of the kind of oven they want two different ways of the kind of house they want i don't like the paint this why would you marry two people seriously you've got one man you you've got one sister for you you do all you can for her just don't use this to make her happy i'll say it again don't give her this to try and make her happy so now coming on the sisters you overspend you want your husband to not work 50 60 hours a week you need to lay this aside for one or two weeks and your total budget will change and you will not spend for one week when me and my wife yeah we need to go back to this she'll probably listen babe when we were younger a week this is what we did for a whole week one week a month we would not go out to eat at all okay do that for a while and realize you know what we only need to go out two times a week this is only we didn't have kids so we went two times a month okay then after my low time the first time when i had stress in my life and i went through that med board thing and stuff my testimony is we didn't go out for a whole month to try and save money so we're on a plan a budget is a plan for your family for a family to be able to know they're going so then my wife i said if you save money in groceries in these areas of clothing and other areas that will help take stress off of me what do you think my wife did stop spending okay and all the money every month that was saved by the deal went into a savings account for a vacation down the road an incentive for your wife to spend money i didn't say don't give her any credit cards don't let her oh you got to have trust so you five dollars for clothing i'm sorry brother dale if this is not like revelations and where my mighty angel comes but this is helping somebody whoo this is bible too be a good steward of what god's given you don't just give it to everybody oh the african guy asked me for a thousand there you go brother and i take my feet and you're still in 60 come on saints this is the bible this is the message the message brings freedom i spend more time let me ask this how can you spend more time reading your bible by not having two jobs have your weekends off as much as possible to spend time with the lord and your family once you have kids these are your mission field what good is it brother dale for you to go out to africa for 45 days what are you doing suicide for your kids you can do that maybe one week month for two weeks right no longer but you know what i'm able to do now but facetime call my kids every day on that blog on that website i'm going to have pictures of what daddy's doing what is that showing them the bible is real being a christian is fun hallelujah the message is real the message is true so in conclusion 10 minutes is getting awful close we're at 1 o'clock 12 45 not even um money doesn't matter you know how there's a movement called all lives matter black lives matter blue lives matter all this nonsense let me just say one thing jesus matters jesus can we all say it matters jesus matters and when everyone has jesus maybe we should start a new movement for the deal jesus matters jesus matters let's say that again g sweet super sticker just matters jesus cares for you jesus loves you he loves you cody he loves you he'll give you 20 bucks he loves you felix'll make you a great farmer just serve him all the days of your life samuel amen how many are thankful as the sisters coming how many want to give him praise how many want to say i believe brother tim [Applause] here i will take one okay i'm being open and honest i will okay it's temporary the gospel is eternal on this bottle it says i have anxiety or depression it could treat either of those i don't have anxiety or depression do i does anyone think i'm depressed does anyone think i'm a wacko weirdo like they told me i was no by the grace of god i've been delivered that's my testimony what is your testimony your heads i want you to ask this question to yourself has my heart been turned the whole prophet's message is to turn our hearts back to christ the whole message was sent to point us to him and to recognize and realize a need for him with our heads bowed and our eyes closed i want you to think about the goodness of god i want you to bind your heart with your spouse if you're able to hold hands or if you're able if she's out of the room that's fine but just pray for her think about her right now if your spouse isn't here maybe he passed away or she passed away i still want you to think about the goodness of god all he's done in your life thank you jesus thank you jesus my testimony i have a testimony as my wife didn't give up on me but i also have a testimony god didn't give up on me god's gonna make a way for you if you don't have if you have a financial problem talk to your pastor he can give you leadership talk to a person that can help you a doctor that can help you dr jesus can touch you amen i'm going gonna give you a major tip that i've never told anybody that me and my wife do we squeeze our hands three times when we're going through and we're upset we squeeze each other's hands three times and in that it means i love you and we can be upset at each other we can be mad at each other we don't agree all the time but we squeeze each other's hands three times i love you and it's like boom devil you tried to make us tried to bring upsetness in the home a confusion in the home and those three squeezes oh god i'm praying right now for some young boy that doesn't have a young boy on the drums here that jesus would come down and squeeze your hand three times and say i love you it's lost your husband or your husband doesn't believe jesus is squeezing your hand and saying i love you leave a service we should not run out in haste but we should give thanks for what god has spoken and if there's anything in my life oh god i'm praying oh god if there's any thing in my life lord forgive me lord if i said something anybody got i don't mean that to hurt no one i'm trying to help point people to jesus god you've given me a vision and it a call was given at the beginning of this year for me to lay aside my business and to follow you to preach this message to the coming of the lord god amazing grace i stand here today bill lang's death in my whole life i might have met him when i was a little boy in ohio i don't remember but he had enough confidence to bring me here lord and i pray that my ministry has blessed somebody that it's helped some young person from a trap the devil had planned for them and any doubt that they had in their mind i pray in the name of jesus that these two services indicate your omnipotent power that the miraculous the supernatural would prove to a young person that they need jesus that through my testimony that has been spoken and i've been very open i could have said more but lord you hold my tongue you've you've given me what to say god for your people and all glory goes to you jesus he's gonna make a way how many believe god will make away in your family if you have family that are away from god right now i know the langstaff family has family that are not where they ought to be with god our own pastor claim them in jesus name say his name say his name claim him because my wife wrote out a check and has claimed her brother and he can say he's an atheist right now and tomorrow he could be at the altar he could go to
