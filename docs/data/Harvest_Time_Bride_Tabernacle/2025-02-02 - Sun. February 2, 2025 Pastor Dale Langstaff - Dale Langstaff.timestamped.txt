[22:35] musicians amen it's awesome to be in his

[22:40] seats for a
[22:42] moment just many out this morning I I'm
[22:46] sure brother Carson told me they were
[22:48] going to be away I actually forgot it
[22:49] was today but uh I believe they're gone
[22:52] traveling but just remember the
[22:55] different ones this morning amen and
[22:59] just say God bless you and welcome and
[23:02] and uh sister Patty had texted us and
[23:05] said she'd be out and I said oh man
[23:07] there goes one of my amen Corners amen
[23:09] just you know when one person or just
[23:12] even two or three are gone it's a huge
[23:14] huge difference and good to see brother
[23:18] Jeff and sister dla and just praise God
[23:21] for everything he's helped them do and
[23:24] move and just pray God will help bless
[23:27] them and help them settle in
[23:30] and
[23:31] amen amen before I
[23:35] Minister I want to uh mention something
[23:38] about last week's son
[23:41] message you know when a minister
[23:45] ministers any
[23:47] Minister you know brother Brown said
[23:49] ministering was like throwing out the
[23:52] fishnet and and then from that point on
[23:55] everything's up to God and I don't ever
[23:58] desire
[23:59] to uh onch christianize anybody or raise
[24:05] myself above anybody the least among
[24:09] here I'm least than them and
[24:12] uh so you know last Sunday's message and
[24:15] today is going to be part two is it was
[24:18] just to try to show us God's
[24:21] principles of working in the scriptures
[24:24] of what the Believers do in secret but
[24:27] many of you do that already so that's
[24:31] not to say that nobody prays for me or
[24:35] nobody fast that only you know that's
[24:38] like if you preach a sermon to Sinners
[24:40] if you're saved it don't apply to you if
[24:43] you know if if you got the Holy Ghost
[24:45] well like you say well you know that's
[24:48] not for me cuz I already got the Holy
[24:50] Ghost you know but
[24:53] uh I know many of you pray for me and
[24:56] some of us you've tell me that
[24:59] and and it's greatly
[25:02] appreciated amen
[25:04] and so it was not to meet uh to uh
[25:10] onsave anybody or to raise us above
[25:13] somebody it was just for those I believe
[25:16] these messages are for those that God
[25:18] was trying to show himself how he moves
[25:22] in the individual person's life and in
[25:25] their church or and in the bride
[25:30] and we're going to we're going to maybe
[25:31] get into that better today uh through
[25:34] Israel but God really works in a way
[25:39] that man cannot understand and and so I
[25:41] just want to say if you're praying and
[25:45] fasting thank you and God says thank you
[25:48] and you know I mentioned something that
[25:51] I don't normally mention but I mentioned
[25:54] that no one had ever given me money to
[25:57] go on a mission trip that does not mean
[25:59] that you should give me money this
[26:01] church supports the ministry and here
[26:04] unbelievable unbelievable we're we're
[26:07] about to have our meetings Len's done
[26:09] the books and if you seen the amount you
[26:12] give is is beyond belief and and if if
[26:16] that came across like
[26:23] that
[26:25] that that was not my intent it was just
[26:29] sometimes we give money for things that
[26:30] God never even cared
[26:32] about God cared about saving Souls
[26:36] period saving Souls period and he cared
[26:40] about you going ministering and we all
[26:42] have a Ministry and if you couldn't go
[26:46] to send somebody
[26:48] else amen and so when I get
[26:52] home I you know your family is your best
[26:55] uh you know judges you know my daughter
[26:57] come to me she said dad I gave you money
[26:59] last year to go to El
[27:01] Salvador I'm like
[27:03] uh-oh that was spanking number one and
[27:06] then I actually remembered you know
[27:08] Tommy Tims from the cattle sailb bar had
[27:10] actually give me money when I went to
[27:11] Africa and so I'm sorry that's it was
[27:15] not
[27:17] meant if you ever hear me ask you to
[27:19] give me money you leave leave the church
[27:22] that's it's not about money that's
[27:24] between you and God Amen
[27:27] so so I'm just human and and that wasn't
[27:29] meant that way and and uh you know but I
[27:33] I believe God can help those that you
[27:36] know need to grow in him and and
[27:39] different things and and uh and and me
[27:42] too and me too I I was ministering to
[27:44] myself too and believe me I really was
[27:49] and and uh God help us so but anyway
[27:52] amen let's just look in our scriptures
[27:54] Ephesians uh 5 we're going to read verse
[27:57] 32 and we'll just look right into this
[27:59] word and pray you'll accept my apologies
[28:03] if sometimes I I I I really try to never
[28:06] mention money but when I mention that
[28:09] that's don't do nothing unless you feel
[28:12] God leads you to do it nothing
[28:14] absolutely nothing
[28:17] amen amen just one Short scripture and
[28:21] and just pray for me and I pray for you
[28:23] and amen this is a great mystery but I
[28:27] speak concerning in Christ in the church
[28:29] Lord Jesus I pray you'll add the
[28:31] blessing to your word and Lord I just
[28:34] praise you for all that were able to
[28:35] come out this cold and snowy day and and
[28:38] bless those ones that are are traveling
[28:40] in away or sick Lord Jesus may you heal
[28:43] them and be with the preaching of the
[28:45] word and the hearing of the word Lord
[28:47] Jesus we pray amen amen you may have
[28:50] your
[28:51] seats Hallelujah I want to look in this
[28:54] scripture and maybe we'll go through it
[28:55] really fast but Ephesians 5 here 22 uh
[28:59] starting at
[29:02] 22 is talking about husbands and wives
[29:06] and we are not talking about that this
[29:07] morning at all we're a million miles
[29:09] from that but if if you would let me
[29:12] read those Scriptures it does bring out
[29:14] some points where it's talking about the
[29:16] church so starting at 22 it says wives
[29:19] submit yourself to your own husbands as
[29:22] unto the Lord and
[29:23] husbands is the head of the wife even as
[29:26] Christ is the head of the church no okay
[29:28] now that's something we want to pick out
[29:30] if Christ ain't the head of this church
[29:31] well we're we're all losers and I'm the
[29:33] biggest one
[29:35] amen he's if if he ain't the head we're
[29:38] we're all lost so let the wives be to
[29:41] their own husbands and everything and
[29:42] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[29:44] loved the church now we know that Christ
[29:47] loved the church because the Bible says
[29:49] that there's no greater love than a man
[29:51] to lay down his life for
[29:54] another and we know Christ did that amen
[29:58] so we know his love is not in question
[30:01] here but we're getting to a part and he
[30:03] gave himself for it and that he might be
[30:05] a that he might sanctify it and cleanse
[30:08] it from the washing of the word washing
[30:10] of the Water by the
[30:13] word that he might present himself a
[30:15] glorious Church
[30:18] having sorry having having not spot nor
[30:22] wrinkle nor any such thing but should be
[30:25] holy and Without Blame and so ought to
[30:28] men love their own wives as their own
[30:32] body now we know God loved us more than
[30:37] himself and and he that loveth himself
[30:39] loveth his wife loveth himself and for
[30:42] no man ever hateth his own flesh but
[30:44] nourish and cherish it even as the Lord
[30:47] cherishes the church now we know God's
[30:48] cherishing the church we feel that every
[30:51] day for we are members of his body and
[30:55] of his flesh you're going to have to
[30:57] excuse me for a minute
[31:07] sorry Hallelujah verse 31 for this cause
[31:11] a man to leave his mother and father and
[31:12] so join to his wife and the two shall be
[31:14] one flesh and this is a great mystery
[31:17] concerning Christ and the church now we
[31:20] want to look at the mystery and we want
[31:22] to look spiritually about Christ and the
[31:25] church and I want to pick something out
[31:27] on the next next verse
[31:30] nevertheless now God's continuing on
[31:33] this mystery let every one of us in
[31:37] particular love his wife even as himself
[31:40] now we already are past the love part
[31:42] because we know Christ loved
[31:44] us but this is what we are we are the
[31:48] wife and let the wife
[31:51] see that she
[31:55] reverence the Lord her husband now this
[32:00] is spiritual forget about the flesh
[32:03] forget about the flesh let us reverence
[32:07] God see that we reverence God now if you
[32:10] want to look into this if You' allow me
[32:13] to he said the meanings of reverence and
[32:15] and and and I know you're going to think
[32:17] well you know of course I reverence God
[32:19] but I I want to show you some people
[32:20] that never reverence God in the Bible
[32:23] because they they they never liked his
[32:26] decisions amen now remember he's the
[32:28] head and if he makes a decision and you
[32:31] don't like it you still got to reverence
[32:34] it the meanings of reverence was deep
[32:37] respect for someone or
[32:40] something a high
[32:43] esteem now when God sends you through a
[32:45] trial you're going to hold them up in
[32:47] high esteem say oh praise God for this
[32:51] trial amen high regard great respect and
[32:57] and min uh
[32:59] admiration adoration honor
[33:03] praise now we're going to touch on
[33:05] praise
[33:07] some affection worship we're going to
[33:10] touch on worship to hold in
[33:16] awe to hold in awe this
[33:19] morning to love to hold in high regard
[33:22] to cherish to
[33:25] idolize to value
[33:28] to
[33:30] treasure that's how we're supposed to
[33:32] look at
[33:34] God and I'm sure many if you do if you
[33:37] see if you do that you're you're
[33:39] perfectly we're not preaching to you
[33:41] we're going to the next
[33:43] person but I wonder in our every
[33:45] decision and everything that happens in
[33:47] our life you know the footsteps of a
[33:50] righteous man are ordered of the Lord so
[33:51] when your basement floods you you you're
[33:53] in high esteem you praise God I can you
[33:56] know when you're you're fire goes flat
[33:58] you say oh Pray when you sight in the
[34:00] ditch when you get a cold you say
[34:04] how
[34:06] really I wonder because you know there's
[34:09] times where we we you know we're
[34:14] humans and so we we take things for
[34:17] granted and take things out of different
[34:19] things here let's just look
[34:22] at what the prophet said he said a lot
[34:24] of people want Jesus to be their savior
[34:28] but they don't want them to be their
[34:30] lord they want what we can get from God
[34:32] to make us happy but if he starts bsing
[34:35] us around well you can just pack
[34:37] salt they not interested in
[34:43] that see Lord means this is the prophet
[34:46] so Lord means he's a ruler he's the boss
[34:49] and he's still the ruler whether you
[34:51] like it or
[34:53] not when he's giving out candies and
[34:56] gifts we love them
[34:58] and and and and he wants to give them
[35:00] more than we desire
[35:02] them but when he starts saying well this
[35:04] is how you get
[35:06] them everything you you know in this
[35:08] study everything that God gives us he
[35:11] expects us to ask for him almost
[35:13] everything in
[35:16] secret you you will be amazed at how
[35:18] much God
[35:19] does in
[35:22] secret you know God help us you know
[35:24] we're going to read some scriptures on
[35:26] this but he said God's looking for
[35:29] nuts he wants you to be nuts to serve
[35:32] him and he said Just remember this it's
[35:35] the nut that holds everything
[35:39] together the Bible can be full of
[35:42] bolts but until you until you start
[35:45] acting nuts for
[35:48] Christ nothing's held together and you
[35:50] know I bet you he mentioned that nuts
[35:53] being held together probably like 40
[35:56] times I couldn't he begin to I'm going
[35:58] to read some of them after he said we're
[36:02] NS to somebody so I'll be nuts for
[36:06] Christ he said Paul said he said I count
[36:09] it that I am a fool for Christ's
[36:14] sake so you know when you're in that
[36:17] situation you're going to be really
[36:19] peculiar now if we look at 1 Corinthians
[36:21] 4 9 and 10 and we'll pull that up if we
[36:24] can Vicki for
[36:28] this was just really really powerful to
[36:30] me the end of I'm not going to for for I
[36:33] think that God has set before us
[36:35] Apostles last as it was appointed unto
[36:38] death and here here Paul this is what I
[36:40] want to catch for We Are Made
[36:43] spectacles onto the
[36:46] world spectacles are not normal things a
[36:50] spectacle the meaning of spectacle is
[36:52] unusual notable or eye-catching
[36:57] you know we're supposed to be salty
[36:59] we're supposed to have our light where
[37:00] the world will see it even if we're not
[37:03] speaking we're supposed to be I
[37:06] catchy that that's not just in our looks
[37:09] but it's in how we handle our character
[37:12] our atmosphere around us if it is
[37:15] glowing with a smile and it's just like
[37:18] oh it's I'm so good to be happy and in
[37:21] your
[37:22] presence he said we're supposed to be
[37:24] spectacles onto the world and to the
[37:27] angel
[37:28] angels and onto
[37:31] men that's that's our that's a that's an
[37:34] order we're supposed to be spectacles
[37:37] unusual to men notable and eye-catchy
[37:42] you should when you're dealing in the
[37:44] world people should you should catch
[37:46] your attention that you're the best
[37:48] employee the most honest employee the
[37:50] most hardworking the most
[37:55] kind and Contin on the same scripture
[37:58] verse uh 10 it says for we are fools for
[38:02] Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ
[38:07] and we are weak but ye are strong and
[38:10] you are
[38:11] honorable but we are
[38:15] despised God help us to this state and I
[38:18] want to look at you know I seen this
[38:20] post and actually Ron mevi AO had put it
[38:22] up and so I'm giving it I'm showing you
[38:25] where I found it and and it was it's a
[38:27] powerful thing and this is like I said
[38:30] I'm preaching to myself said God never
[38:32] looked for fans and and you know this is
[38:35] this applies in the church you know this
[38:37] ain't a one-man show you you we're all
[38:40] part of the movie you know specials and
[38:42] and amen and and and and your noise will
[38:46] never scare me if you stand up or move
[38:48] or something like it won't shut down the
[38:50] service we we're we're so orderly we're
[38:53] disorderly because it Amen brother mam
[38:57] said if you're if you don't have no life
[38:58] bury it said God never wanted fans he
[39:03] always wanted
[39:05] followers there's a big difference
[39:07] between fans and followers and if it
[39:09] would be all right for me I would share
[39:11] some of these he said fans are
[39:13] comfortable followers are committed fans
[39:16] are consumers followers are cont
[39:20] contributors fans sit in the stands but
[39:23] followers get in the
[39:25] game fans are spect ators followers are
[39:29] participators fans are part-time
[39:31] followers are fulltime fans follow the
[39:35] crowd followers follow
[39:37] Christ fans only listen to the word
[39:40] followers
[39:42] participate practice the word fans live
[39:46] by their feelings followers live by
[39:50] faith fans only want blessings followers
[39:54] Embrace burdens fans only want want to
[39:57] wear a crown followers Carry the Cross
[40:01] Jesus wanted fans this morning which one
[40:06] are
[40:07] you amen you
[40:10] know normally in a
[40:13] gathering I'm not saying that applies
[40:15] here but you know in any business you
[40:18] know normally in a if you had a business
[40:20] or a church or anything a gathering it's
[40:23] normally 5 or 10% of the people that do
[40:26] everything that needs to be done done
[40:28] and it's normally 90 or 95% of the
[40:30] people that are
[40:32] fans but it's only 5 or 10% that are
[40:36] actually making it
[40:38] happen amen God help us here we're going
[40:41] to look in touch and worship and then
[40:43] I'm going to go to our main example in
[40:45] the message here he
[40:47] said we're talking about Holy Ghost
[40:49] worship here brother Braham says that
[40:52] Rebecca watering the camels for for
[40:56] elaser
[40:57] that he came to take her to Isaac she
[40:59] didn't know she didn't know at the time
[41:02] she was watering the camels that she was
[41:04] that there even wasn't elaser she didn't
[41:07] know that at all but brother Brown
[41:09] considers that as the Holy Ghost filled
[41:11] Worship in the church today you know if
[41:15] you want to go see your Isaac maybe you
[41:18] need to get here and worship God maybe
[41:21] you need to lose your mind worshiping
[41:23] God and can you imagine if you just
[41:26] would go with me on this journey
[41:27] where Rebecca would water the camels
[41:31] that had just came across the desert by
[41:33] dropping the you know when we were in in
[41:36] uh BAH on the island of Bah they took a
[41:39] shower beside the road and there was a
[41:41] well there a SM well in a spot to L and
[41:44] they had just literally a a a it was it
[41:47] wasn't a pale but they had like a
[41:50] jug and it was heavy on one side and
[41:52] they let that down with a rope and it
[41:55] would flip over easy and fill with water
[41:57] and they they pulled it up and that's
[41:58] what they showered thems with and I
[42:00] couldn't imagine pulling a 2 L jug
[42:02] because if it was heavier that the Rope
[42:04] would be really heavy this is a woman
[42:06] now can you imagine her pulling up a 2L
[42:09] jug to water a herd of camels that had
[42:12] came across the
[42:14] desert that was not no 5 minute worship
[42:17] service that was no 30 minute worship
[42:19] service that was not even a 12- hour
[42:21] worship service I couldn't even begin to
[42:23] tell you how long it would worship take
[42:26] to
[42:28] and brother Braham said at that time she
[42:30] never even know she was going to see
[42:32] Isaac and she never even knew there was
[42:35] an
[42:36] Isaac amen and what God's trying to show
[42:38] us and this ain't meant to be to be to
[42:41] be rude or mean and and I'm going to
[42:42] read a scripture with this is but you
[42:44] get what you put into something if you
[42:47] go to work early and you're you're the
[42:49] best employee you're going to get a race
[42:52] am man no it's not about that but it
[42:54] it's not about but you're going to get
[42:56] from God what you put into it you know
[42:58] the one Church where we visited I won't
[43:00] tell you where it was if you were a
[43:02] musician in that church and you didn't
[43:04] get there an hour early you weren't
[43:05] allowed to to
[43:07] play and you know when we went to the
[43:09] churches they would unlock the door half
[43:11] an hour early and normally there would
[43:13] be 200 people outside the door and if
[43:16] you came more than a half an hour late
[43:17] well you just probably didn't get a seat
[43:19] or you were coming off the street
[43:25] backsliding but it was all part of their
[43:27] preparation for the
[43:29] service it was a part of their worship
[43:32] so let's look if you if we want to see
[43:34] so brother Brown says here he said
[43:37] Rebecca water and the camels was
[43:39] worshiping God to take her to her Lord
[43:43] and her
[43:46] master ain't that a
[43:48] mystery if you want to go in the Rapture
[43:50] worship
[43:54] god wow
[43:57] all he said the very power of the church
[44:00] is worshiping and the world's calling
[44:03] calling it fanaticism but the church
[44:06] worshiping will have the same power that
[44:08] will take the church up in the air to
[44:11] meet the Lord in the
[44:13] air that's our
[44:15] Prophet you thought I was just saying
[44:19] that Ephesians 5:28 or Ephesians 5:18 to
[44:23] 21 be not drunk with wine wherein there
[44:26] is access but this is what I want to
[44:29] catch on here the end of Verse 18 but be
[44:32] filled with the spirit in verse 19
[44:34] speaking to yourself in
[44:36] Psalms and in hymns and spiritual songs
[44:42] and singing and making Melodies in your
[44:45] heart to God you want to go in a Rapture
[44:48] that's the verse to take you
[44:51] there giving thanks always for all
[44:54] things unto God and the father in the
[44:56] name of our Lord Jesus Jesus and
[44:58] submitting yourself one to another now
[45:00] you know in
[45:02] worship when we're submitting ourselves
[45:04] to one another I don't care how you
[45:06] worship because it's not about me it's
[45:09] about you and your lord you can we all
[45:11] worship differently some could cry and
[45:14] be quiet some could shout and jump some
[45:17] could just sit still and
[45:23] shiver submitting yourself means
[45:25] respecting one another in the variety of
[45:28] God but it was still worship and worship
[45:31] takes
[45:33] time worship takes
[45:36] time God help
[45:38] us God help us and when we look into
[45:41] this next example I want you to remember
[45:43] this the meaning of reverence we are to
[45:47] reverence God as our Lord and our head
[45:52] as our
[45:54] ruler now I'll tell you ahead of time
[45:57] time the people never even came close to
[45:59] reverence but here here in the Bible it
[46:02] was the children of Israel were in Egypt
[46:04] and they had went there from Joseph
[46:06] during this famine and their family had
[46:08] Grew From one family to Millions two
[46:12] million amen and thank you and
[46:17] uh and There Rose up a king that knew
[46:20] not
[46:24] Joseph and uh
[46:30] and here the people the Lord the Bible
[46:33] says that the Lord heard the groans and
[46:35] the prayers of the people and I want to
[46:38] tell you something God hears your groans
[46:40] this morning and your prayers this
[46:42] morning guarantee you he hears them we
[46:44] see that example all the time in the
[46:46] prophet when when people start praying
[46:49] unbeknownst to him I love this part of
[46:51] the tapes listen to tapes and and he's
[46:53] doing a prayer line or preaching or
[46:55] doing something else he oh oh you prayed
[46:57] just 5 seconds ago and now went through
[47:00] the internet rate to Glory went through
[47:02] all the angels went to the top boss at
[47:04] the the the throne and was sent down and
[47:07] even brother Brenham had to process
[47:09] it and it took
[47:13] seconds
[47:16] amen but here the people were praying
[47:19] but what I want to show you this morning
[47:20] and I I'm not trying to be forgive me I
[47:24] I apologize I'm not trying to be down
[47:27] or
[47:28] discouraged or or to I'm trying to show
[47:31] you the reality and facts of God is God
[47:34] maybe many times don't answer our
[47:37] prayers like we think and expect that he
[47:45] should
[47:46] here Israel was praying I I want to even
[47:50] bring this part out you know God said
[47:53] what well let me just go back to my I
[47:55] got it down here
[47:59] God said in Genesis 15 that he would
[48:02] bring the people out of slavery in 400
[48:05] years but in Exodus
[48:08] 12 he actually did it in
[48:14] 430 what
[48:19] happened you have to ask God that cuz I
[48:22] don't
[48:23] know I know God's time's perfect but it
[48:27] wasn't like he said it was going to
[48:31] be that's that's just flat
[48:33] Bible but you know God had a purpose and
[48:36] his interpretation is different than us
[48:38] even reading it so watch this he said Mo
[48:41] God Called Moses and Aaron and they went
[48:44] to pharaoh and Pharaoh gave them a very
[48:47] simple message in in uh Exodus 51 he
[48:50] said let my people go to the Wilderness
[48:53] that we may hold a feast and a sacrifice
[48:58] for God and here God had had called
[49:01] Moses when he called Moses back in the
[49:04] scriptures he said I've heard the prayer
[49:07] request of the children of Israel and
[49:09] I've heard their moanings and groanings
[49:11] and I'm going to deliver them he told
[49:14] Moses I'm going to answer their
[49:19] prayers and the Israelite people wished
[49:21] that God hadn't answered the
[49:24] prayers cuz it said they were bitter
[49:29] rude upset mad
[49:32] disgusted and would have killed
[49:37] Moses see God was answering Israel's
[49:39] pray prayer because he sent them a
[49:41] deliverer Prophet Moses and their
[49:44] laboring and suffering got far
[49:48] worse and you would pray for healing or
[49:51] salvation or or something and like a
[49:54] miracle that God to give you new more
[49:56] money or something else and God will
[49:58] take what you already got and you say oh
[50:00] wow kind of a god of my
[50:03] servant he would just seeing if you were
[50:05] really
[50:06] his Moses asked God in Exodus 5 he said
[50:10] here here Moses talked to the Lord now
[50:12] now this was the Moses was a God to
[50:14] Pharaoh he said Lord whereof how thou
[50:17] sent so evily
[50:19] retreated and treated this people why
[50:24] hast thou even sent me as a deliverer
[50:28] now I got a question for
[50:31] you that was
[50:33] respect that was
[50:36] reverence that was the highest reverence
[50:38] that Moses could
[50:41] give
[50:43] God see the reason that happened was
[50:47] they didn't expect God to be that
[50:49] way they had a pre- agenda plan and that
[50:53] happens in all of our Lives we think
[50:55] we'll pray for our lost loved ones and
[50:57] they go farther in sin we say God what
[50:59] are you
[51:02] doing God knows exactly what he's
[51:04] doing he said they never understood God
[51:07] and how that their answer to their
[51:09] prayer Moses spake again to the children
[51:12] of Israel and they wouldn't even hearken
[51:14] they wouldn't even show M ma Moses
[51:17] respect for the anguish of Spirit and
[51:21] the cruelty of the burden from the
[51:23] answering of the prayer
[51:28] see when you
[51:31] pray they thought God would bring them
[51:34] out in some miraculous Miracle glory and
[51:38] the people hated it how God was doing
[51:41] it they actually hated Moses for
[51:45] it how could the children of Israel show
[51:48] such reverence to God and blame and
[51:51] fault for this evil and cruel burden
[51:54] that had been brought onto them
[51:57] because
[51:58] Moses because God had sent Moses that
[52:02] they could go into the
[52:04] Wilderness and worship
[52:07] god well I want to give you a comparison
[52:10] if you come and you dedicate your life
[52:13] and you you do things like come early to
[52:15] church and and you shout cry or pray or
[52:18] raise your hand or sing a special in the
[52:20] worship
[52:24] service you might get evil retreated
[52:28] burdens
[52:32] bondage because God's way of building
[52:35] character was different than the
[52:37] children of Israel could even
[52:43] imagine and I I want to also bring this
[52:45] out before we go through the scriptures
[52:47] you know it wasn't until after all the
[52:50] scriptures we're going to go through it
[52:52] wasn't until after all this
[52:55] happened watch this this is important it
[52:57] wasn't until Exodus
[53:00] 7 after all the burdens came on the
[53:02] children of Israel the God told only
[53:06] Moses that I'm hardened in Pharaoh's
[53:08] heart to bring Glory unto myself and he
[53:10] never told the
[53:15] people the people had no idea when they
[53:18] were being beaten for making more brecks
[53:21] beaten because watch how Pharaoh says
[53:23] this in verse five of chapter 5
[53:27] Pharaoh said well behold you have so
[53:29] much spare time that you would want to
[53:31] go and do a sacrifice and worship your
[53:35] god well you can collect your own straw
[53:38] and make the same amount of
[53:40] bricks and in verse
[53:44] seven why we will no more give straw to
[53:48] make bricks as here for let them go and
[53:51] collect the straw for themselves and
[53:53] verse eight and the Tails of the bricks
[53:55] which thou make make henceforth shall be
[53:57] laid upon them and thou shalt not
[54:01] diminish ought
[54:04] thereof and and literally Pharaoh
[54:07] brought over thas maskers this was the
[54:10] answering of the prayer Pharaoh brought
[54:12] over task Masters to beat the children
[54:15] of Israel for
[54:22] praying wow
[54:34] that's a little different than we
[54:38] thought let more work be verse n let
[54:41] more work be laid upon the men that they
[54:44] may labor therein and let them regard
[54:46] vain words and the thas maskers of the
[54:50] people went out and their officers and
[54:52] spake unto the people thus saith pharaoh
[54:56] I'll give you no
[55:00] straw you ever wonder how God answers
[55:04] our
[55:04] prayers and
[55:06] why because God is our Lord and He all
[55:11] knows the beginning from the end and
[55:13] he's got a whole plan here but the
[55:16] children of Israel don't understand it a
[55:19] bit and I believe many times that us
[55:22] living here in this day we wonder
[55:24] actually me and L we're talking about
[55:26] driving here and I won't mention it but
[55:29] I said I'm surprised we're still here
[55:32] and and you know the state of the Canada
[55:34] is social and and you know and the
[55:37] things that are going on it's
[55:40] like but God knows wh why why are we
[55:43] living through this garbage can of
[55:46] disgust filth and
[55:51] sin well at that time it was to bring
[55:54] more glory to God it was be a great
[55:57] powerful
[55:59] oaking God help us he said and I'm going
[56:04] to read through these if it's all right
[56:05] verse 13 and the tasmac hasten onto them
[56:09] to fulfill your work and your daily task
[56:12] as then there was as was when there was
[56:14] straw and the officers of the children
[56:16] of Israel which were the Tymers set over
[56:19] them and they were
[56:22] beaten God was answering their prayers
[56:24] God promised to answer their prayers
[56:27] this is how he did it he beat them and
[56:30] demanded thereof that you fulfill the
[56:33] task of making both the bricks of
[56:35] yesterday and today there
[56:38] henceforth now right about that time
[56:40] Israel wasn't sure if they wanted God to
[56:42] be the
[56:44] Lord they were thinking we may be better
[56:51] reconsider in verse 15 and the officers
[56:53] of the children of Israel came and cried
[56:55] onto Pharaoh saying there thereof
[56:56] dealest thou with thy
[57:00] servants and 16 and there is no straw
[57:03] given unto thy servants and they say
[57:05] unto us make brick Behold thy servants
[57:08] are beaten but the fault is of thine own
[57:12] people now he here's the world saying
[57:15] it's your fault because you
[57:19] prayed but he said unto them ye are
[57:22] Idol and ye are Idol therefore ye say
[57:26] let us go and sacrifice unto our
[57:29] Lord so here I'm trying to show you that
[57:32] and God's trying to show you is anytime
[57:35] you do anything for God he didn't
[57:38] promise it'd get
[57:40] better amen this is a Battle Ground we
[57:44] we're we we know the end of the story we
[57:47] know we've won the war we know we're
[57:49] going in the Rapture but you're in the
[57:51] front lines right now and just because
[57:54] you knocked down a couple Devils there's
[57:56] another whole Fleet coming at you the
[57:59] prophet said that all the guns are a
[58:01] aimed on the bride of Christ and hearing
[58:04] said just because you wanted to
[58:06] sacrifice just because you wanted to
[58:08] come to church and worship God you'll
[58:10] run in the
[58:13] ditch have a car accident you say why
[58:15] I'm going to church
[58:23] God hallelujah
[58:28] verse 19 and the officers of the
[58:30] children of Israel did not see that they
[58:33] were evil in evil case and after it was
[58:37] said ye not minimize ought of the bricks
[58:41] daily task and verse 20 and they met
[58:44] Moses and Aaron watch this this is like
[58:47] the church meeting the
[58:51] pastor or the prophet or the Evangelist
[58:54] or whoever you'd want to say and they
[58:55] met Moses and Aaron who stood in the way
[58:59] as they came forth from pharaoh and they
[59:02] said unto them Lord look upon you and
[59:05] judge because you have made our savior
[59:09] to a a Bo a to a horde in the eyes of
[59:14] pharaoh and the eyes of his servants and
[59:17] ye have put the
[59:18] sword upon us to slay us there's there's
[59:23] there's the people that Moses was called
[59:26] to to to by God to lead
[59:29] out and the people are accusing them of
[59:32] You're a
[59:33] murderer and you've set the guns on us
[59:36] to kill us with the
[59:39] sword if there had been a vote about
[59:42] right down of Moses I think you would
[59:43] have lost the
[59:48] election and Moses returned unto the
[59:51] Lord therefore and he said why we read
[59:53] this and said Lord why hast thou so
[59:54] evily
[59:56] re entreated this people and why hast
[1:00:00] thou even sent me now now just think
[1:00:02] about that now let's look at but
[1:00:06] reverence
[1:00:07] respect
[1:00:09] dignity admire highest steam none of
[1:00:13] these are playing into effect
[1:00:18] here verse 23 and since I came to
[1:00:21] pharaoh and spake in thy name here
[1:00:23] here's Moses communion with God and
[1:00:26] saying wh why is it going this way since
[1:00:30] I came to pharaoh and spake in thy name
[1:00:32] in Jesus Christ's name thou Hast done
[1:00:37] evil that was answered prayer to this
[1:00:41] people and neither hast thou delivered
[1:00:43] thy people at
[1:00:48] all why doesn't God answer
[1:00:51] prayer because God has a greater plan
[1:00:55] out of another time to bring more glory
[1:00:58] to himself I mean this is is this not a
[1:01:01] perfect example of it amen let's let's
[1:01:04] let's look back at this I mean if you
[1:01:06] forgive me to go back here in my
[1:01:12] notes reverence deep respect High esteem
[1:01:17] high regard great re
[1:01:20] admire adoration honor
[1:01:23] praise hold in high regard ch perish
[1:01:27] idolize value and
[1:01:30] treasure Moses is threatening God said
[1:01:33] why did you do
[1:01:37] her we don't want to put Moses down
[1:01:39] because many times we do that say God
[1:01:42] why why why am I why is this happening
[1:01:45] God I've asked God why I think if you're
[1:01:48] breathing you've asked God why God why
[1:01:50] did I why did this
[1:01:52] happen why
[1:01:54] did why am I in the Str
[1:02:00] in Exodus
[1:02:01] 6 in Exodus 61 and then the Lord said
[1:02:05] unto Moses now shall thou see what I
[1:02:09] will do to Pharaoh for with the strong
[1:02:12] hand shall I let them go and with a
[1:02:15] strong hand shall he drive them out of
[1:02:18] the land now I want to show you
[1:02:20] something when God revealed this to to
[1:02:24] Moses the children of Israel were still
[1:02:26] getting beaten and they never got this
[1:02:30] word they never got it there was no way
[1:02:33] that Moses could preach to a million
[1:02:35] people that were being beaten in
[1:02:40] slavery they had to trust
[1:02:43] Moses and they were struggling with that
[1:02:47] part I don't I don't blame him I would
[1:02:49] have been
[1:02:50] too I would have been the first one with
[1:02:52] a stone to throw at Moses you know why I
[1:02:55] can can say that cuz I'm a
[1:02:58] human
[1:03:00] amen and God spake unto Moses and said
[1:03:03] onto him I am the Lord verse three and I
[1:03:06] appeared unto Abraham and Isaac and unto
[1:03:10] Jacob by the name of the Lord God
[1:03:14] Almighty now I want you to show you
[1:03:16] something
[1:03:19] here excuse me here's God telling him
[1:03:23] that I appeared onto Abraham Isaac and
[1:03:25] Jacob but by God Almighty but I'm going
[1:03:29] to do something different for you but by
[1:03:32] my name
[1:03:33] Jehovah was I not known unto
[1:03:36] them Jehovah is provider Jehovah Gyra my
[1:03:41] provider he said I'll be known as
[1:03:43] Jehovah to you where I wasn't even known
[1:03:47] that way to them and verse five and he
[1:03:50] said I have also heard the groaning of
[1:03:52] the children of Israel and the Egyptians
[1:03:54] whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I
[1:03:57] have redeemed my Covenant and therefore
[1:03:59] the children of Israel for I am the Lord
[1:04:01] and I will bring them out under the
[1:04:03] burdens of the Egyptians and I will ride
[1:04:06] rid you out of their burdens and I will
[1:04:09] redeem
[1:04:10] you with a stretched out arm and with
[1:04:14] great
[1:04:15] judgment now now now that that's that
[1:04:17] sounds pretty
[1:04:19] positive let's go to verse
[1:04:21] n and Moses preached to the children of
[1:04:25] is
[1:04:28] Israel
[1:04:30] uhoh but they hearkened not onto Moses
[1:04:34] for the anguish of Spirit and the
[1:04:37] cruelty of their
[1:04:38] bondage in that service there was no
[1:04:43] amens it was
[1:04:45] Stone I don't
[1:04:48] believe there wasn't one person there
[1:04:50] that believed
[1:04:57] has anything
[1:04:58] changed we're still people God ain't
[1:05:03] changed amen and so this message just
[1:05:07] helps
[1:05:08] us to understand why are you going
[1:05:12] through what you're going
[1:05:13] through well we know how this end turned
[1:05:16] out that the children of Israel were
[1:05:18] delivered and they were paid for their
[1:05:21] back slavery and they they literally
[1:05:23] spoiled all of the wealth of Egypt and
[1:05:26] we're delivered in a Great and Mighty
[1:05:28] powerful
[1:05:29] hand and so will we be delivered but our
[1:05:33] battle is for us to to to to mature and
[1:05:36] character and that don't change what
[1:05:39] God's doing because you're going through
[1:05:42] the worst battle don't mean God ain't
[1:05:44] answering your prayer you might say but
[1:05:46] God I can't pay the hydro B tomorrow but
[1:05:48] maybe God will pay three in a
[1:05:52] row
[1:05:54] amen the only way we can get the answer
[1:05:58] is to make them our
[1:05:59] Lord and in the and the Heat of the
[1:06:02] battle and when the bullets are going by
[1:06:04] you and maybe even hitting you you got
[1:06:06] to say
[1:06:07] God you're
[1:06:16] it I'm going to read some quotes here
[1:06:19] where brother Brown talked about your
[1:06:22] attitude towards your lord and my
[1:06:25] question is did the children of Israel
[1:06:27] have the right mental attitude when the
[1:06:30] hardships and cruel bondage and evil
[1:06:32] came towards
[1:06:34] them when they had to keep when they
[1:06:36] didn't have straw and they had to make
[1:06:39] the same amount of bricks and that was
[1:06:41] God answering their prayer to let us go
[1:06:43] free and worship
[1:06:45] you I I I would question that the
[1:06:48] children of Israel when they were going
[1:06:49] through their burden they kind of lost
[1:06:51] their interest about having a sacrifice
[1:06:53] in the
[1:06:54] wilderness they got to well maybe it
[1:06:56] ain't so bad if they just bring us a
[1:06:57] straw we'll just keep making
[1:07:06] bricks here the prophet said this
[1:07:08] multiple times and I put up five or six
[1:07:10] he said the right mental attitude he
[1:07:13] said all along here he said if you
[1:07:16] understand what I mean it's a right
[1:07:18] mental attitude towards God Divine
[1:07:20] promises will bring it to pass if you
[1:07:23] start bossing God around
[1:07:27] you're going to get nothing from
[1:07:30] God if you don't have reverence and
[1:07:33] respect and high esteem and honor and
[1:07:36] adoration and all those things that call
[1:07:38] with reverence remember the Bible said
[1:07:40] this is a great mystery concerning
[1:07:43] Christ and the church and if God's the
[1:07:46] Superhead power is he's not on no Eagle
[1:07:49] trip but he's still the boss and he
[1:07:52] ain't going to have some little wimpy
[1:07:54] two-year-old coming along saying change
[1:07:56] the rules and rewrite this because I
[1:07:58] don't like how you're doing
[1:08:00] it you're going to get forgotten
[1:08:04] about here's another example he said
[1:08:07] listen to me listen to this carefully he
[1:08:09] said and I say this with reverence this
[1:08:11] is the prophet really making a point is
[1:08:15] that all right listen to me listen to
[1:08:17] this and I say this reverently and
[1:08:19] quietly so you can remember what God
[1:08:21] will do the right mental attitude to
[1:08:24] every promise of God
[1:08:26] will bring it to pass he said remember
[1:08:28] and don't forget this quotation this is
[1:08:30] a prophet he's driving these things home
[1:08:33] when he says things like this remember
[1:08:35] the attitude the right meal attitude to
[1:08:38] any Divine promise in the Bible will
[1:08:40] bring it to pass don't start dictating
[1:08:43] God God hurry
[1:08:49] up but maybe say the same thing say God
[1:08:52] I know you're more than able and your
[1:08:53] perfect times are coming
[1:08:55] look at the difference of the
[1:08:59] reproach he said if God watch this he
[1:09:02] said if God is his God and if God word
[1:09:06] is no good then go then God is no
[1:09:09] good he's no better than his word and
[1:09:13] I'll say this that God keeps every word
[1:09:16] that he said and every promise that he
[1:09:18] said and if you'll take the right mental
[1:09:20] attitude towards every Divine promise
[1:09:22] that God ever made he'll bring it to
[1:09:24] pass if you just take the right attitude
[1:09:27] and believe it with all your
[1:09:30] heart God help me God help us that when
[1:09:34] things aren't the way exactly like you
[1:09:36] think they should
[1:09:40] be at that time they're exactly how
[1:09:43] they're supposed to be by God's
[1:09:46] desire the Bible clearly tells us in the
[1:09:49] prophet clearly taught us that there's
[1:09:50] nothing out of syn for God even the most
[1:09:54] evil devils in the world are working
[1:09:56] right in tune for God they're helping
[1:09:58] them bring everything to pass perfectly
[1:10:01] they're like a tool in his wrench and he
[1:10:02] say oh yeah they're thinking they're the
[1:10:04] baked
[1:10:05] cheese and they're working at they're
[1:10:07] lining all God's program up
[1:10:10] perfectly but so many times as Believers
[1:10:12] we don't understand it now watch here
[1:10:15] another example he said now the word of
[1:10:17] God when it's written in the Bible is
[1:10:19] his word to us and every promise is the
[1:10:22] same power for the creation behind and
[1:10:25] the word of God that the word of God did
[1:10:28] in the beginning and if we believe it to
[1:10:30] be the word of God it depends on the the
[1:10:34] ground that the seed falls on that's you
[1:10:38] individually he said if it falls on
[1:10:40] ground that can create and grow with
[1:10:43] moisture and nourishment and around the
[1:10:46] great Promises of God it will bring
[1:10:48] forth the promises of Bible just as it
[1:10:50] said the right mental attitude towards
[1:10:52] the Divine promise of God will bring it
[1:10:54] to pass and you'll look at it and it'll
[1:10:57] take care of the word just right because
[1:11:00] it's an infinite God spoke
[1:11:05] it see if we have the right
[1:11:08] clay if we build the right atmosphere
[1:11:11] you know if we have the soil to seed
[1:11:14] connection
[1:11:16] conversion God will have no problem
[1:11:18] fulfilling his word but God
[1:11:21] demands
[1:11:23] respect God demands
[1:11:26] reverence and anybody that thinks
[1:11:28] they're going to passs God around you
[1:11:30] know you know you see even you know in
[1:11:33] our world today you know like God could
[1:11:36] you see people that oh my goodness it's
[1:11:39] just
[1:11:40] hilarious they think they're going to
[1:11:41] blaspheme God and their very next breath
[1:11:44] is coming from God it's so
[1:11:47] Insanity you know there's things on the
[1:11:49] online where you can see people that
[1:11:51] blasphemed God and they died within
[1:11:53] seconds literally one of them was at the
[1:11:56] UN and they were blaspheming God's
[1:11:58] people the the the Israel nation and all
[1:12:00] that and he fell off the podium and
[1:12:05] died that's in our day God is still God
[1:12:10] he's the same as yesterday today and
[1:12:11] forever you want to see God move God's
[1:12:14] moving everywhere you know Esther let me
[1:12:16] this ain't part of my notes or my plan
[1:12:18] you know Esther told you that little
[1:12:20] testimony you should have lost your mind
[1:12:22] over it I I if you don't think so when
[1:12:24] you come you know me and Lan we were
[1:12:26] even talking today and we were talking
[1:12:28] last week and we want to have everybody
[1:12:30] come out to our place on Tuesday or
[1:12:32] Thursday night and fellowship but we
[1:12:34] only want to have two or three at a time
[1:12:35] so we can actually talk to
[1:12:38] everybody you should look at the tractor
[1:12:40] that run over our
[1:12:41] dog now I'll just tell you what like
[1:12:44] this is no offense brother Tim but me
[1:12:46] and Tim were talking about it when the
[1:12:48] person there that seen it wasn't there
[1:12:50] and Tim said he said now
[1:12:52] dad the tractor didn't really run over
[1:12:55] over the
[1:12:56] dog because you know like Dad if the
[1:12:59] tractor run over the
[1:13:00] dog he'd be squished like a
[1:13:03] pancake
[1:13:07] and I was there with Tim
[1:13:10] and I couldn't help but agree with them
[1:13:13] and so I come back to challenge
[1:13:16] Moses on his testimony of
[1:13:19] God and Jared said this he said well I
[1:13:22] can tell you this Dad the dog was
[1:13:24] sticking out both sides sides of the
[1:13:25] tire and the tractor bounced on the seat
[1:13:29] when I went over the
[1:13:35] dog oh that I'm not going to to tell you
[1:13:38] what I would look like if the tractor
[1:13:39] ran over me and
[1:13:42] bounced and that dog literally ran in
[1:13:44] the house and was still running up and
[1:13:46] downstairs the same
[1:13:48] day that's not even possible even me and
[1:13:52] Tim don't think it's
[1:13:53] possible but mes still tells us it is
[1:13:59] possible you see it's like this you know
[1:14:03] it's like if your wife tells you
[1:14:04] something I say but I'm only a human
[1:14:07] man I can only believe so
[1:14:12] much but when it comes to God it's
[1:14:15] different amen and so God did all this
[1:14:19] to the Israelites to make his name more
[1:14:22] wonderful and more glorious and more
[1:14:24] fantastic in in every way and and and it
[1:14:27] was all about God God it wasn't about
[1:14:28] making Israel glorious it was about
[1:14:30] making God glorious and and when when
[1:14:32] they finally left Egypt Pharaoh said get
[1:14:34] out of here take everything you want we
[1:14:37] just just
[1:14:42] leave
[1:14:47] amen amen Luke 18 1-8 and and I I I need
[1:14:52] to read this to to show how God does
[1:14:54] things in secret and so our personal
[1:14:57] life with God and that's an individual
[1:14:59] walk is all about what you do in
[1:15:03] secret everything is about the the bible
[1:15:05] promises this is that what you do in
[1:15:07] secret he will reward you
[1:15:12] openly that's I mean I would take that
[1:15:16] promise you want to see something happen
[1:15:18] just deal with God in secret and God
[1:15:21] will take care of the
[1:15:23] rest here in Luke
[1:15:28] 181 Jesus is speaking in Parables unto
[1:15:31] them to this end and he said man ought
[1:15:34] to pray and not
[1:15:37] faint you know we read scriptures last
[1:15:39] week is you should pray without ceasing
[1:15:42] pray all the time you should be in a in
[1:15:45] a I don't mean kneeling but I mean in a
[1:15:47] a a thought of
[1:15:51] prayer and watch this this is a story he
[1:15:53] says and there was a city judge which
[1:15:56] feared not
[1:15:57] God neither regarded men and there was a
[1:16:00] widow woman of the city and she came
[1:16:02] unto him saying avenge me of my
[1:16:05] adversaries and he would not for a while
[1:16:07] but afterwards he said within himself he
[1:16:10] said there I don't even fear
[1:16:12] God and neither do I regard this woman
[1:16:15] or any
[1:16:16] man but she's driving me she's bothering
[1:16:22] me did you can you imagine praying so
[1:16:25] much that God said they're bothering me
[1:16:28] brother Dale's praying so much he's
[1:16:30] messing up the internet in
[1:16:34] heaven you're disturbing our our daily
[1:16:37] government
[1:16:39] ranks and here he said yet because this
[1:16:42] wible troubleth me I will answer her
[1:16:44] prayer and avenge her lest she continue
[1:16:47] coming wear me
[1:16:51] out I don't believe any of us has ever
[1:16:53] wore God out but this is actually now
[1:16:56] watch this but this is actually
[1:16:59] God Jesus Christ using this for an
[1:17:03] example hello for an example an example
[1:17:07] and the Lord said hear ye these unjust
[1:17:11] judge and shall not God avenge his own
[1:17:15] elect which cry day and night unto him
[1:17:19] though he beareth long with them what
[1:17:22] kind of a god are we serving
[1:17:25] amen I tell you that he will avenge them
[1:17:31] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[1:17:34] man cometh shall we even find people
[1:17:38] praying on the
[1:17:42] earth
[1:17:44] wow you know the Bible says you have not
[1:17:48] because you asked not
[1:17:55] God help us I want to show you another
[1:17:58] example if if this is all right in my
[1:18:00] throat I'm I'm actually got herbal tea
[1:18:02] here to keep me so I don't completely go
[1:18:04] horse and then brother M or Jared would
[1:18:07] have to come out and
[1:18:08] preach here we see an example and this
[1:18:11] is a quote of Elijah when when the
[1:18:13] Syrian Army was coming down to surround
[1:18:16] him and the King wanted to uh take him
[1:18:19] captive because they couldn't understand
[1:18:21] God
[1:18:26] amen and one of the people the Syrian
[1:18:29] government the Syrian King brought his
[1:18:32] army together and he was convinced this
[1:18:35] is an evil King a pagan King he was
[1:18:37] convinced that there was a spy or a
[1:18:40] traitor in their midst because
[1:18:42] everything they did to destroy God's
[1:18:45] people backfired on
[1:18:47] them I want to tell you something it's
[1:18:49] exactly the same today you can just rest
[1:18:53] peace and ly you know if you go in the
[1:18:56] ditch when you're going home from here
[1:18:58] say praise God the 18-wheeler didn't run
[1:19:00] over me it ran over the next car or
[1:19:03] something you know it can always be
[1:19:06] worse
[1:19:07] amen hallelujah and so
[1:19:10] here uh the one of the pag this we need
[1:19:14] to watch this we're are we Believers and
[1:19:17] we're Holy Ghost filled now here's a
[1:19:19] pagan evil King and one of his army men
[1:19:22] said King I got to tell you
[1:19:25] something there's a prophet in that
[1:19:28] land and he tells the Israelite King
[1:19:32] what you even think in your
[1:19:36] bedroom now that's what you call a
[1:19:38] Believer he was in the first steps of
[1:19:47] conversion they again you know the story
[1:19:49] The the king and the government they
[1:19:51] said well let's go get that guy and
[1:19:54] surround them and the Syrian Army came
[1:19:56] down to to surround them and here the
[1:20:00] the Elijah was with his
[1:20:03] servant and the the servant woke up and
[1:20:06] he see he wasn't a Believer
[1:20:08] yet like he was hanging around Believers
[1:20:11] cuz he liked their friendship but he
[1:20:13] wasn't really like he had a couple more
[1:20:15] steps to go and he woke up and he told
[1:20:18] Elight he said oh Lord he said we're
[1:20:21] surrounded by the army of Syria we're
[1:20:24] finished a
[1:20:28] pancake he said why Elijah woke
[1:20:33] up and he looked out and he said oh he
[1:20:36] said there's more with them than there
[1:20:38] be with us you know I want to tell you a
[1:20:40] story I was listening to it last night
[1:20:42] and and Len heard me to hear it and this
[1:20:45] this is this is just for what it's worth
[1:20:47] I was planning on sharing it today but I
[1:20:49] I actually it it came to me and I feel L
[1:20:52] you know there was a story of a man that
[1:20:55] came to a a little country
[1:20:57] church and I believe this is a true
[1:20:59] story and when he got to the church he
[1:21:03] was going to preach on missions and he
[1:21:05] was going to preach on going to all the
[1:21:06] world and preach the gospel for people
[1:21:08] to get saved and when he got there it
[1:21:10] was a cold blizzardy night really
[1:21:11] miserable weather like it was uh two
[1:21:14] Wednesdays ago was minus 20 it was
[1:21:17] unbelievable and all the people there
[1:21:19] were like 80 in over and he thought oh
[1:21:22] my goodness what am I preaching this for
[1:21:24] this
[1:21:25] this don't apply to anybody here none of
[1:21:28] these people are going
[1:21:30] to and he felt still let he felt led I
[1:21:33] we actually listened to it last night he
[1:21:35] said I felt led he said I still preached
[1:21:37] the message and he said they had a pipe
[1:21:39] organ there and there was a boy that
[1:21:40] pumped the air into it and and when he
[1:21:42] finished his message he said who will go
[1:21:46] that here's God calling for Laborers and
[1:21:48] the in the field of the weak field of
[1:21:50] the sheeps and he said who will go and
[1:21:52] spread the gospel and the little boy
[1:21:53] said I'll go
[1:21:55] I'll go to the mission field just a
[1:21:56] little squirt like Jared's boys and so
[1:22:00] the the story goes farther he he
[1:22:02] actually did grow up and he went and he
[1:22:04] went to be a medical doctor and he went
[1:22:06] to the mission field as a medical
[1:22:09] doctor he was there for many years but
[1:22:11] he could actually you know Help the
[1:22:13] People physically and preach the gospel
[1:22:16] and when there was one of the tribes or
[1:22:18] one of the people there in the country
[1:22:19] which just happens on a regular basis
[1:22:21] I'm actually actually talking to a
[1:22:22] missionary right now that's in North G
[1:22:25] and one of these days on Wednesday night
[1:22:27] or something I'm going to read some of
[1:22:28] the stuff he sends me is just
[1:22:29] unbelievable and he's never ever asked
[1:22:32] me for a penny but if he don't baptize
[1:22:34] 50 people a week it's like an unusual
[1:22:36] low week he has it's just it's just wild
[1:22:40] what he tells me uh just beyond belief
[1:22:43] amen he's driving around North Ghana but
[1:22:45] their Muslim present is very heavy there
[1:22:48] and so there's times where they'll have
[1:22:49] a whole church or people want to get
[1:22:51] baptized and the moslim won't let them
[1:22:53] go in their river by the damn or
[1:22:54] something and so this this is a reality
[1:22:57] okay and so the king of the One Tribe or
[1:23:00] the people there they told the doctor
[1:23:01] they said we're coming down the you know
[1:23:04] you such and such a day and he said
[1:23:06] we're going to take care of you uh your
[1:23:08] hindrance to us
[1:23:10] here in this area and so the now the
[1:23:14] reason you can tell this story and they
[1:23:16] and actually I I have the guy's name I'm
[1:23:18] not making this up this is this guy
[1:23:20] breathed this guy lived I have his name
[1:23:22] it had to be on my phone but he wrote
[1:23:25] kept a diary and so the day came and he
[1:23:27] was praying to God he said God you know
[1:23:29] this is why I'm here and you know I mean
[1:23:32] he could have been in North America
[1:23:33] making thousands of dollars and he's
[1:23:35] there making nothing and it just saved
[1:23:37] and he said you know whatever God and so
[1:23:40] they came and you know came and went and
[1:23:41] they were still alive and later on that
[1:23:44] same guy came and got saved and he said
[1:23:46] hey he said you know you sent me a note
[1:23:48] you know a year ago and you were going
[1:23:50] to come down and kill us
[1:23:52] all he said what happened
[1:23:56] it's the exact same thing that happened
[1:23:57] here in Elijah see God God never changed
[1:24:00] if he changed he only changed in your
[1:24:02] mind he didn't change your God might
[1:24:06] have change but not Jehovah God never
[1:24:07] changed and he said oh yeah he said we
[1:24:10] came down but he said when we come down
[1:24:12] to encamp your house and the people
[1:24:14] around you he said there was 39 of the
[1:24:17] biggest Angel soldiers that we've ever
[1:24:21] seen in our life camped around about
[1:24:23] them and so he came back to the very
[1:24:26] same church like this is years later
[1:24:28] like I mean he he's not traveling every
[1:24:30] week to the missioni and he comes back
[1:24:32] to this very same church where he was a
[1:24:34] small
[1:24:35] boy and he's telling this testimony and
[1:24:38] the secretary of the church comes up and
[1:24:41] he says could you give me the date the
[1:24:44] date that they were coming down to do
[1:24:46] you harm he said I sure can he opens up
[1:24:49] his diary and he said it was on such and
[1:24:51] such a date right here boom he said we
[1:24:53] had3 people at church that day at prayer
[1:24:57] meeting 39 people that day were the
[1:25:01] angels that were somewhere
[1:25:04] else in prayer 39 days that's I can give
[1:25:08] you the guy's name just after services
[1:25:10] on my phone and here Elijah says to his
[1:25:13] servant how do you say his servant's
[1:25:18] name he
[1:25:20] says oh buddy he said there's more with
[1:25:23] us than be with them
[1:25:25] and he says he says well I I don't know
[1:25:28] what kind of glasses you're wearing but
[1:25:30] he said this whole mountains is
[1:25:31] encircled with the Syrian Army and he
[1:25:34] and Elijah went to God he said God could
[1:25:36] you please open that poor dumb boy's
[1:25:41] eyes and he opened his eyes and there
[1:25:44] was a great Heavenly force of angels
[1:25:47] around him and you know the story Elijah
[1:25:50] walked right out to them and God smoted
[1:25:52] him with blindness and said who you
[1:25:53] looking for Elijah and he said oh well
[1:25:56] follow me I'll take you to
[1:25:58] him you had that just happened in the
[1:26:00] Bible times well I just showed you
[1:26:02] another example that just happened on
[1:26:03] the mission
[1:26:04] field what you do in secret you know
[1:26:07] those people in that church that were
[1:26:08] there the 39 praying they had no idea no
[1:26:11] communication no connection or nothing I
[1:26:13] can show you I send the things it's on
[1:26:15] my phone that that was happening but
[1:26:18] what they were doing in secret God was
[1:26:20] doing
[1:26:23] openly
[1:26:24] amen if we ever catch that understanding
[1:26:28] we'll be at perfect rest perfect peace
[1:26:31] you don't have to worry about your lord
[1:26:33] and King you just you just have to you
[1:26:35] just fall into complete trust and
[1:26:37] obedience and the Bible smoked them
[1:26:40] blind and he said that settles it he
[1:26:42] said they they were here's a prophet
[1:26:45] talking this is this is right before he
[1:26:48] dies in 65 said the Bible said he smok
[1:26:50] them blindness he said that settles it
[1:26:52] the people are so spiritually
[1:26:56] blind
[1:26:58] today it's not brother Dale ministering
[1:27:01] this message it's God ministering this
[1:27:03] message he's trying to show you I'm
[1:27:05] still God the same yesterday and forever
[1:27:07] everything that God ever gave to the
[1:27:09] church it's still there he never took
[1:27:10] any of it away every all the promises
[1:27:12] and that are all for the Holy Ghost
[1:27:14] filled Believers if you're a Believer
[1:27:15] they apply amen they're all yours
[1:27:18] they're up to you to get them all you
[1:27:20] got to do is go into the enemy's Camp
[1:27:22] take back what he's took from you amen
[1:27:24] the great exceedingly great and precious
[1:27:27] promises are all yours you just got to
[1:27:29] cross the River Jordan and step into the
[1:27:35] water he
[1:27:38] said that's why the the people are so
[1:27:41] spiritually blind today though the Lord
[1:27:44] God came down in the midst of the people
[1:27:46] and do anything and the things that he
[1:27:48] promised he still can't see they're
[1:27:51] spiritually blind they still don't know
[1:27:53] that God
[1:27:58] they're spiritually blind they still
[1:27:59] don't know that God don't know his great
[1:28:02] power and now you notice what he did in
[1:28:05] the Days of Elijah he can still do today
[1:28:10] but do we do we believe
[1:28:14] that I hope we believe that he said God
[1:28:17] smelt them blind he said you say today
[1:28:20] he said yes today God can still do the
[1:28:23] same thing and he said to the same thing
[1:28:25] about Elijah because they were taken up
[1:28:27] watch this this is a really powerful
[1:28:29] quote he said he said they did the same
[1:28:33] thing when Elijah was taken up and this
[1:28:35] is this is huge this is this is beyond
[1:28:38] belief he said because when Elijah was
[1:28:41] taken up Elisha took his place a young
[1:28:45] man that went baldheaded now watch this
[1:28:48] I know you understand this perfectly a
[1:28:50] young man and the young children came
[1:28:52] running out to Elisha and said why
[1:28:56] didn't you go up with Elijah you old
[1:28:58] bald
[1:29:01] man you know who those young people were
[1:29:04] they were the children from the
[1:29:05] Believers at
[1:29:08] church he said why didn't you go up
[1:29:10] baldheaded why didn't you go up with
[1:29:12] Elijah this is a direct quote this is in
[1:29:15] spiritual food and due season 65078 in
[1:29:18] the
[1:29:19] evening and he said see they didn't even
[1:29:22] believe it in the beginning the people
[1:29:24] after so many things that had been done
[1:29:26] the great man of God had been translated
[1:29:29] into Heaven by a fire Chariot of fire
[1:29:31] and the people still didn't believe it
[1:29:33] and their little children ran out behind
[1:29:35] the man and said you old Baldi why don't
[1:29:38] you why don't you go up too he said see
[1:29:41] and the pr the pro the prophet cursed
[1:29:44] the people and a Shear bear come out and
[1:29:46] ate 42 of them he said that was because
[1:29:49] of the Believers
[1:29:52] unbelief you said well I believe God
[1:29:55] have I seen Elijah go up in the Chariot
[1:29:56] of fire these Believers
[1:30:06] Never God help us God help
[1:30:09] me God help me can you imagine
[1:30:14] physically see Elijah leave in a chariot
[1:30:16] of fire and be so spiritually stupid to
[1:30:20] mock God and say well why didn't you go
[1:30:21] up too Elijah cuz they didn't even
[1:30:24] believe it really even
[1:30:27] happened wow God help
[1:30:33] us God help us here and I I read this
[1:30:35] scripture before and I'm going to close
[1:30:37] here just
[1:30:39] uh Luke 18: 28:30 and Peter said Lo
[1:30:43] father we've left everything to follow
[1:30:44] you and he said unto them this is God
[1:30:47] verily I say unto you that there is no
[1:30:49] man that's left a house or parents or
[1:30:52] Brethren or wife or children children
[1:30:54] for the kingdom of God's sake who shall
[1:30:56] not receive manifold more in this
[1:30:59] present time and in the world to come
[1:31:02] everlasting
[1:31:07] life Amen brother bram's talking about
[1:31:10] us being nuts for Christ he said it's
[1:31:13] about time we became nuts radical
[1:31:17] radical ridiculous peculiar
[1:31:20] eye-catchers people that stand out
[1:31:24] for
[1:31:25] Christ
[1:31:27] oddballs he said how do I know I'm
[1:31:29] threaded right because I watch the word
[1:31:31] of God and you know whether you're
[1:31:33] threaded right whether you're a nut for
[1:31:35] Christ or you'll be a nut for The
[1:31:38] World God help
[1:31:43] us my last quote and we'll close but
[1:31:47] there's there is a
[1:31:49] Christian
[1:31:52] Amnesia here that's that's a sleeping
[1:31:56] drug and there's an Opie that comes from
[1:32:00] the
[1:32:01] Lily and the Christian church has some
[1:32:06] Opie and it's from the lily of the
[1:32:09] valley oh it sues all the pain that's
[1:32:12] it's and it's all over when when you get
[1:32:16] to become a Christian you have the
[1:32:19] Christian Opie the painkiller and it's a
[1:32:22] new wine the they had on the day of
[1:32:24] Pentecost and it soes the pain that's
[1:32:28] came through your life and people
[1:32:32] there's two paragraphs and we're closing
[1:32:34] and people are so arrogant that they
[1:32:37] they're doing things that they ought not
[1:32:39] do instead of trying to get to the root
[1:32:43] cause of what's wrong in their life and
[1:32:46] people are flirting with you know the
[1:32:48] Bible says if you love the world and the
[1:32:49] things of the world you're not even
[1:32:51] converted
[1:32:54] they're just putting on they're just
[1:32:56] putting on another case with it and
[1:32:59] you'll never find the
[1:33:01] cure until you get rid of the case and
[1:33:04] man's trying to find something to
[1:33:07] satisfy and he's thirsty and God made
[1:33:11] him to thirst and he built a way but God
[1:33:14] built him in a way that he would thirst
[1:33:16] after God but he tries to satisfy
[1:33:20] it he tries to satisfy it and the harsh
[1:33:23] and whole holy call that's in him by the
[1:33:26] things of the world and we got no right
[1:33:29] to do that now but the people do wrong
[1:33:32] constantly instead of going to the place
[1:33:34] that you get rid of the cause and try to
[1:33:38] to
[1:33:39] uh you try to get rid of it by worldly
[1:33:43] pleasure when God built it
[1:33:46] up for worshiping him and all this
[1:33:50] builds up pressure and it just makes it
[1:33:52] get worse all the time because you're
[1:33:55] not going about or you're not looking
[1:33:59] for the right
[1:34:02] thing God help
[1:34:05] us God help
[1:34:08] us
[1:34:10] amen whatever you do in
[1:34:13] secret God will reward you openly amen
[1:34:17] God help me and God help us to do more
[1:34:21] for him in secret God's plan for the
[1:34:25] church and God's plan in the church
[1:34:28] number one was the reverence of the Lord
[1:34:33] God in
[1:34:35] secret and he would reward his people
[1:34:37] openly God help us that we I pray that
[1:34:40] we don't want just God as our savior and
[1:34:43] our healer but we actually want him as
[1:34:45] the
[1:34:46] boss the boss and no matter how what
[1:34:49] decision he
[1:34:51] makes that we'll follow it because we
[1:34:53] know it'll be good for us the footsteps
[1:34:55] of the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[1:34:58] regardless of where they go it's to
[1:35:01] bring Glory it might not just bring
[1:35:02] glory to you individually but it'll
[1:35:05] bring glory to the family of God Amen
[1:35:09] God help us reverence I just I just love
