appreciate my buddy brother Mike uh coming along riding up with me maybe driving me home and so uh uh it's just a real blessing you know Jesus sent him out two by two and it's just good to have a buddy on the Travel my wife wasn't able to join me this time but bring greetings from her and from my family we got a little one on the way it's a little hard to travel right now for her and know the Bible talks about a woman being great with child I think Cheyenne's pretty good with child she's she's she's doing all right with child and so so she's staying home quite a bit God bless you let's turn to Psalms 51 and don't want to take keep you standing too long with pleasantries and things but sure enjoyed the fellowship last night and want's wish brother Elliot a happy birthday turning 13 he's old enough for youth camp now so we'll be come August time we'll be maybe pulling on a little bit see if we can make some make some buddies down in Ohio huh uh brother Dale is gracious let us let us kind of plug our youth camp this morning it's a wonderful time uh actually a lot of families come not just Youth and we have some wonderful Services there every August so uh sure sure welcome any fellowship and and uh you know it should be a two-way street we'll have to get some of our young people up here sometime amen I did enjoy that special this morning very much that's actually second time that song's been sung uh in a couple weeks now and so it's a just puts me in mind of my text from last time we were here on God's economy amen every one of us has a place in the body this morning I have a very simple thought uh on my heart but it's just what's on my heart so if my heart's right I want to follow my heart if it's right and uh and so may we'll just be doing the work of an evangelist today but we're trus in the Lord we'll we'll we'll just bless it and multiply it to you I'd like to speak on a pure heart Psalms 51 we'll just read this together have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee and thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom yes Lord Purge me with hisp and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities Lord create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from BL blood guiltiness oh God thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness oh Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise now this is quite beautiful here for thou desirest not sacrifice or else I'd give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering but the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God thou wil not despise amen amen doesn't that just speak your heart this morning if you don't mind stand a a minute longer let's read Psalm 24 and just take our text for this sermon Psalms 24 just verses 3 to 6 here who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jacob amen shall we pray Heavenly Father Lord your word Lord many times when we turn to the Psalms father we find that the words there speak our very hearts Lord and the deepest desires within us Lord and father I I I trust that's the desire of every heart that's assembled here today Lord to be pure before you Lord to be washed clean Lord and and and father to just have a heart that's pure Lord and reserved unto you Lord in your spirit Lord and and and and so we ask Lord that you would just come by this simple word this morning May you search US Lord may you may you find any any wicked way Lord and and cleanse it Purge it father that we might have a pure heart before you Lord and that that Pure Heart might be expressed with hands that that are clean clean enough to handle this gospel Lord Jesus oh God that's our desire now just speak to us from your word Lord Lord as brother Mike prayed perform that heart surgery on each one thou great physician as we surrender to you Lord and ask you to have your way in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you as you're seated this morning amen uh just just been very captivated by this this uh this thought of of a pure heart uh it it means quite a bit to me personally uh through some different experiences that I've had and experiences in my family also the the part about Clean Hands uh in this season of my life it's it's something that's a heart's cry I don't know how much time we'll have to get into that part of the subject tonight but but you know it's my desire Amen to be pure uh to to be good in Ministry in in in in fatherhood in a marriage in just my Christian Life I I want to be found pure before him I I don't I don't want to I don't want to handle the word of God with any deceit I don't want to mix it with anything I don't want to dirty it with things of the world or my own ideas or or anything like that but I just want to be a pure believer of this age a pure genan seed of God expressed with no no compromise no no mixing amen and and so and so uh and so it just drives me to this little study on on a pure heart and at home we we handle the youth ministry there at the church and we've been U we've been dealing with the youth on matters of the heart you know matters of the heart because you know we we all we all struggle in our hearts as Christians it's a it's actually where the the The Human Experience is you know when I I think just to just to kind of uh uh put your mind in the channel that I'm coming from you know we heart the heart the scripture deals with the heart uh there's hundreds maybe thousands of scriptures dealing with the human heart now this heart you can't x-ray it you can't dissect it you can't lay it out on an operating table it's not this physical organ you know with aorta and ventricles and and and and and and and uh tissue fibers it's it that that's that's not the heart that we're speaking of but but we don't need to take an hour this morning and preach you know and teach you on what the heart is because we all understand what it is to have a heart and to struggle in your heart or be burned in your heart or question in your heart or or desire something down deep in your heart because that's the real human experience that's that's the real that's that that's where the real experience is you know we we we we we exist in this physical world and and we touch a lot of tangible things but the real identity the real experience the real person amen I is in the heart Amen in that in that spiritual realm and where there's deep callings you know there's there's deep desires there's thirsts in there which uh there's groanings which can't even be uttered sometimes you can't you would cheapen it by trying to put it into words what's going on in the heart amen amen and and uh and and and that's where the Christian experience is supposed to be had that's where the Christian experience occurs is in the heart brother brandom said that the heart is the Abode of God Amen in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the ark and the the heart is the ark and he said now but God doesn't dwell in the head God dwells in the heart God is not known by theology I've always loved this quote God is not known by mental conception God is known by an oldfashioned Sanctified a born again experience that's in the human heart now now men and women will live a good life and love God by mental conception but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with Christ it's hid with Christ and you know we we could try to go deep here but but we don't want to uh we just don't want to take it that way but you know you can look at you can look at this heart and surrounded by by 24 Elders or ribs and you know there's there's four passageway four channels of that heart where where blood's coming flowing in and out you know and and and and and we can look and realize that this heart is the Throne of God amen amen as as as as his Heavenly Throne is surrounded by 24 elders and there's there's four four anointings that that face out from that Throne brother amen but see God doesn't uh it's not God's desire to dwell in symbols it's not God's desire to dwell you know in a written word amen but God has chosen as his throne his his Abiding Place his his Tabernacle the heart of the human being amen and so a Christian is not really a Christian until they have experienced the indwelling of God and amen and so they're in spiritual communion where where God lives in the heart amen that's where Christianity happens Christianity doesn't happen uh in the church that we belong to or in our church attendance or just in singing our songs or paying our ties or dressing a certain way or associating with a certain group of people or her holding certain Creeds to be true amen but Christianity amen is Christ amen dwelling in the heart that's what the heart is it's the Abode of God now and so that's where we want to be living that's where we want to be having our experience that's where we want God to be working is in the heart amen and brother Brandon would often quote this this Psalm in prayer where he says search me oh God search me and know my heart know my heart and try me and know my thoughts and and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting and so we find David as a prototype of the believer here he's approaching God he's saying God you look at my heart you search me you try me and then you look for any wicked thing now now now it's might seem it's kind of a silly question maybe but but it it goes a little bit deep to think that why would David need to ask the Lord to know his heart right because now of all the people in the world shouldn't David be the one that would have a grasp on what was going on inside of him it shouldn't David be the one now shouldn't you we think now maybe maybe it's just subconsciously that's the way we think many times Well if anybody should know you know what's going on in my heart it ought to be me amen but it's not so brother sister amen because uh you find that there are many uh circumstances of our life and struggles that we go through and situations will rise up in the church and we find that we're not fully in control of this guy amen that but there are things there there there there are turmoil there there's confusion there and so we have need of God Amen to deal with our heart because he knows it better than we do amen we could rattle off the scripture for that the Bible says that a man's heart deviseth his way how many times have you set your heart to something you say God in my heart this is what my heart is telling me to do this is what I'm going to do and what does it do it falls right to pieces and then you find out as a little time goes on it was the Lord directing your steps amen a man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directeth his step the Bible says every way of a man is right in his own eyes amen but the Lord pth the hearts amen you know that the world and uh uh I know this is cliche but it's still true that the you know the world today says Follow Your Heart Right amen you know uh uh uh that's that's uh that's the Disney gospel that's the that that's sort of the layot ofy and philosophy follow your heart if it feels right do it if it feels good go get it amen whatever your heart's telling you that's truth that's reality it's not brother sister amen the Bible says the heart is deceitful Above All Things amen and desperately wicked amen who can know it amen and so we find it we cannot live by just what we feel in our heart you've got to have an absolute amen because there are times in our Christian experience where our heart is saying one thing but the word is saying the other and so it's a showdown Amen to find out what's really true brother sister and I don't just mean to God I mean what's true to you what's your absolute amen what's true amen because I'll tell you this word is true regardless of how you feel this word is true regardless of what you're feeling regard regardless of what your emotions say regardless of your heart's cry the word of God is absolute reality it's truth amen and so a Christian has to be in communion with something that's higher than our than our heart it's higher than our than our thinking than our feeling than our emotions amen who can know it and see see there's just a lot going on in there sometimes can you relate to that or is it just me I think I don't think it's just me there's a lot going on in heart amen there's deep deep calls but you realize we are living in a day when deep has responded amen this message of the hour is not a slightly better church with slightly better Doctrine it is deep that has responded amen deep has given an answer it's identification it's it's reality it's truth it's absolute it's Vindicated it's firm brother sister amen amen forget what your heart says amen Embrace this word amen hallelujah oh my amen because there's a there's a light that is coming to our day that can Pierce down all that shadowy stuff that we get under amen Jesus spoke of of uh those that were blind in heart you know the the blind hearted Pharisees people of his day when the word was now now not bad people and not people without sincere Hearts you know uh uh uh but but but good people missed Jesus Christ when he was manifested because the way that he came disappointed them didn't match their expectation it didn't it didn't quite line up with what what in their heart they thought it would be amen and so it becomes a showdown there you know he said of the he said of the the when he announced himself he said you Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people they draw nigh to me with their mouth see this is a religious person somebody who's got religion but they haven't quite got Christ they honor me with their mouth honor me with their lips but their heart heart is far from me their heart is far from me now brother sister that's not where I want to end up amen but I want a heart that is in contact with my redeemer Amen brother BR said we need today is a message Anointed with the messiahship of Christ but would they receive it oh my they pray for it but would they receive it no they wouldn't receive it he said they crucify it like they did in the first place why he said because the human heart is deceiving amen now think of how many people how many people maybe even this little town of Wyoming amen how many people have have have have fallen on their knees even in this town and prayed for Revival amen prayed that God would send a a Revival to this city or to this province or or to this country amen but when the message came to them amen did they embrace it they rejected it amen why because it didn't line up with what they were Desiring in their hearts brother sister brother I don't I don't I don't care what my heart is saying amen but when the word is Vindicated when it's manifested in front of a true son or daughter of God Amen then they'll lay aside what their heart says and they will embrace the word because it shows what kind of seed is on the inside it's the true Vindication of a true son or daughter of God Amen that they can receive the Vindicated manifested word amen and they won't believe this deceitful heart Amen brother BR said if you went if you went to all the churches today you think about Sunday morning if we just took a tour of all the churches in Canada brother Braham said and but if you begin to filter out those amen who were genuine word born Christians amen if you went to all these churches and you took out and and and you took out anybody that wasn't a genuine word born Christian he said there'd be a lot of sermons preached up against an empty wall today amen why BEC oh my because because the heart is deceitful amen when the heart finds satisfaction in religion when the heart finds satisfaction in Tradition amen amen when the heart finds satisfaction in personal opinions amen or personal relationships or whatever it is amen and fall short of the word test but brother Bram said I've got one desire in my heart and I hope that everyone listening to me has the same thing God take me through your filter as David said try me and prove me and see if there be any evil in me and take it out Lord you know we could preach a lot about denominationalism I tell I tell our young people I was like I want to program you train you to do this when brother Brandon begins to preach on denominations don't think in your mind you know well we're non-denominational so that doesn't apply to me I said take out the word denominational and put my church identity my tradition amen my background my relationships my church membership my Association brother sister denominationalism is not just an organization it's a heart condition it's a heart condition amen and without without surrendering to the knife of this word amen to to to get all of those uh all those worldly thinkings and all of those private interpretations and carve all of it out of you brother sister amen you can be a oneman denomination today amen but we don't want to be that we want our hearts to be Washed by the Water of the word we want to be cleansed we want to be pure before him we want real true heartfelt Christianity we want a real experience with God Amen we need it to survive this world that we're living in this is no time to play church this is no time to play games brother sister this is a neurotic age this is a time of anxiety a time of fear it's a time of depression the Bible said it would be it's it's scripture fulfilling itself when we see gross Darkness heavy Darkness on the hearts of the people amen but look that uh you know there's a lot of entertainment there's a lot of Mirth there's a lot of Comforts there's all those things but the Bible said even in laughter the heart can be sorrowful and that's like the world that we're living in today whistling in a graveyard take a little bit of entertainment take a little bit of worldly pleasure amen and and shoot that into the veins just to numb the pain for a little bit brother sister but the human race today is crying out Hearts amen have a deep call a deep thirst for God Amen not God of a church not God of a tradition but the real and living God Amen abiding in the human heart reality truth amen absolute assurance Hallelujah Jesus said it would be like that he actually said of this day in this day men's Hearts would be failing for fear amen that don't just mean heart attacks and heart trouble and high cholesterol brother sister but emotionally spiritually in the hearts of human being hearts are breaking today hearts are heavy hearts are failing men are faint men are weak amen why amen because of the age that we're living in but he said in that time Hallelujah when it's the most depressive age it's ever been when it's the most neurotic age Amen in an era of depression and anxiety and turmoil I'll send you Elijah and he'll turn your heart back amen you won't be subject to leosia you won't be subject to gross Darkness but I'll send you a light it'll Pierce that Darkness amen it'll wash it away from you and it'll give you a pure heart in the middle of the most wicked age that's ever been hallelujah oh brother that's what I want for my experience I don't want to spend 50 years a message believer and never meet Christ amen I don't want to I don't want to have a god of tradition this is not my daddy's God or my grandfather's God and my church is God but it's my God and he lives in my heart it's reality it's truth it's peace it's Joy amen it's restoration brother this heart has been restored by this Elijah word back to what a human being is supposed to be oh my that's what the word is supposed to do that is the ultimate sign of this word the Bible says the word of God is alive it's powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword and it pierces to the dividing of soul and spirit amen of the joints and the marrow and it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart amen you believe in the Messiah sign for this day amen it wasn't just in a prophet it's in a message amen it's a word amen that can go down through your heart and it can carve away all the confusion carve away all the spiritual turmoil and reveal that seed laying down in your soul amen oh friends let the word operate on you Amen Let the message deal with your heart amen don't just make it your Creed or your tradition amen but let the word be alive Let It Be powerful in our churches Amen to come down amen the aisle and speak to the heart amen now we don't have a gift in the Pulpit today to say you know you're your name is so and so and you come from this city and you when you were a little girl you got in a car accident you've had anxiety ever since and Discerning you that way but how many times did you come to service and brother Dale had no idea what was going on in your life and the preach the visiting Minister didn't have he had no clue what the church was dealing with amen but what happened amen it came the word came right down your aisle the word came right to your heart and it began to speak to you amen it began to re it begin to discern what you're going through that's what the word can you that's what only the word can do amen it's a messiah sign friends amen we people people you know they come so far with the message amen as to just belong to a message church and believe God sent a prophet the devil believes God sent a prophet but you got to get this message in you get this word in you and then let it do the dividing you're not qualified amen but we've got a word brother sister it can come down amen it can it can manifest itself to you you it can divide down and you might be so see you know people get so tore up in their Spirit they wonder if they even got the Holy Ghost but let the word begin to deser you and it begins to divide the soul and the spirit and it says okay let's cut this away now over in your spiritual realm there's the greatest battle ever fought you're going through a lot of turmoil there's questions there's fears there's struggles but in your soul amen you're a seed of God you are eternally secure you're bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh soul of my soul amen oh hallelujah amen it's a word that speaks brother sister it's a word that speaks amen the trouble is you got to get that word in you but when the word comes into your heart it knows just how to divide it you know wouldn't it we be wonderful sometimes I don't know why we're going this way but sometimes sometimes people sometimes people can have a genuine experience with God but the main thing holding them back is a question in their own mind cuz the devil's able to put a seat of doubt in there say well you never really got the holy ghost or or you never you're not maybe you're not really a seed or maybe you send away your day of Grace or or or or or or or or you know you know this message it's true but it's not for you and and those kind of thoughts and wouldn't it be nice wouldn't it be nice to be able to sit in a meeting and know that there was a prophet on the face of the Earth amen who had the Messiah sign in his ministry and he'd be able to just look down and say God bless you your name is Mike Allen I see that you're a real Christian oh wouldn't that wouldn't that be wonderful to hear that from the words of Prophet amen but brother sister that word is still here amen and the brother Ram said when you recognize that this message is Eagle food you have heard from your theophany brother or sister it's a it's a word of discernment it's a word of identification it's a word if you just let it into your heart it'll tell you who you are amen it won't it will it'll clear up the confusion God's not the author of Doubt amen he's but he's the author and the finisher of Faith Hallelujah this great physician amen he knows how to operate on your heart the trouble is we were always trying to fix this guy up amen but let the word do it let the word do it say Lord search me you know better than me you look and see if there's anything Wicked any wicked way in me I don't want to go a wicked way I want to go the way Everlasting now wicked wicked doesn't just mean evil you know that's not uh uh actually the the the the real translation for that word it has it it comes from the same word as Idol like idolatry and so but but it doesn't just mean evil you know it's not Lord come and search my heart and see if there's any first-degree felonies and see if there's any murder and see if there's any Grand Larsen and you know Lord come look at my heart see if I'm going to go rob a bank tomorrow no Lord is there something in my heart that's leading me to sorrow it's leading me to grief it's leading me in your permissive will and Lord I want to be in your perfect will anything Lord is there something out of order Lord I might do my priorities need fixed up Lord is there anything anything that's invisible to me then Lord fix it search me try me know me and fix it Lord because because if I follow my heart it'll lead me to wickedness but I want to walk in the way Everlasting Lord I want you to direct my steps oh my amen that's why this might be a simple thought this morning but no matter how long you've been a Christian no matter how long you've been in church no matter your position in the church we need this amen we need a heartfelt religion we need a one-on-one communion with God Amen where he's examining us and trying Us by his word and fixing us cuz we can't fix ourselves we can't fix ourselves so Lord is there anything out of order is there is there is there any idolatry is there something wrong with my private worships amen see those are the things now you can hide lot of that from people you can hide a lot of from people and you know the problem is we put a lot of energy and a lot of our time and a lot of our effort into taking matters of the heart and concealing it from everybody else amen we do that why because because that's where we feel the pressure what would brother Dale think what would brother Jared say if they knew and oh I better not bring this up everybody will think I'm struggling you know everybody will think I'm weak pastors feel that way well you know if I get too if I get too real this morning then the people might lose their confidence in me if I show my human weakness and I get that way I'm sure you get that way brother Dale amen but you know we find it we find that we put a lot of our time a lot of our enry a lot of our focus into concealing it from people and it's not too hard to do cuz religion is a covering religion is a covering I've learned in my short 34 years of living that religion can hide a lot amen but there's one that you can't hide it from there's somebody who knows your heart he knows it better than you do you can't hide it from him he knows what's wrong amen all you really got to do is let him in amen but we but along with trying to hide it from some everybody else we try to conceal it from the Lord and we don't bring it to him to just get it fixed just get it fixed you but you can't hide it from the word that's the Messiah sign this word is a discerner brother sister he knows he knows he know knows where you're at today now you might have been successful you may have hidden it from your spouse from your children from your church amen but that that heart problem amen that struggle that question that doubt that that that that worry that fear whatever it is brother sister it's not hidden from him but will you take it to him or will rather will you let him in you know that he knocks on the door of every heart but it's those that it's those that let this word in let the message in amen that it'll come amen it'll break the bread hallelujah amen that's how we get as human beings just like you know there was a woman one time and she spent a lot of time you know trying to hide her wickedness hide her Pro now no doubt you know uh uh uh this woman she was an ill- Fame woman but no doubt you know the way that she got that way it wasn't all her fault but things just spiraled out of control and people hurt her and one thing led to another and life experiences had brought her to a place amen where she was she was in a Ed condition and you think she had anybody on her side no she got caught one day amen and instead of a good good loving bunch of brothers and sisters Amen to help her amen she found herself in the middle of a bunch of Pharisees and they said we caught you now amen now now we see that weakness now we're going to drag you to him now that's the way it is that's sometimes how we learn to hide things that's sometimes how we learn this behavior of concealing all of our struggles amen because we got some Pharisees in churches amen amen but but see but see don't let a Pharisee keep you from getting to Jesus amen cuz they began to drag her they said we'll take her to him and she thought oh my takeing I hear that I hear he's the son of God I hear he's got the power of life and death in his voice I hear I I you know I hear that power of creation is subject amen I hear he's the Messiah I don't want to go there I don't want to go there amen and that's how we feel with our troubles we come to church and we say well you know I I'll come to church sure you know I'll raise my hands and I'll sing some songs and I'll say amen and I'll enjoy a nice I'll enjoy some nice preaching today and we'll just have a good church service and that's how far we'll go but I don't want to go there Lord don't take me there cuz if I go there I don't know what's going to happen I don't know what you're going to say Lord I haven't opened that door in a long time amen I I Lord there's a lot of things stored up there there's a lot of hurt there's a lot of baggage I finally got it stuffed in that closet I don't want to go there with you Lord oh but why be afraid amen she was afraid to go to him amen but even her enemies drugger to him and what did he say he said let he that's without sin cast the first tone he said all of my children are brokenhearted amen but I came to bind them back up amen you don't have any accuser before me and neither do I accuse you go there brother sister go there at all costs amen every chance you get in the house of God I I don't care what people will say I don't care what people will do I don't care how you think you might act amen just get to Jesus there was another woman one time amen that she was in a similar condition and she heard that Jesus was in town she had something in her heart driving her to him amen but she was afraid to go she didn't want to go there cuz it cuz to go there she'd have to go to Simon the Pharisees house in Bethany and then and and she'd have to in other words when you come to church there's a lot of people come to church Faithfully but carrying out trouble on their heart and they bring it to church and they go home and they bring it and they take it back home and they'll carry it for decades that way why because to take it to Jesus you're going to have to you're going to have to rub shoulders you're going to have to pass through some some some anxiety you're going to have to pass through some condemnation you're going to have to Pastor you know you're going to hear the devil whispering in your ear saying you shouldn't be struggling with that anyway why even go why even get prayer for that you're probably not even a Christian oh my and and there's just a lot of Pharisees between you in Jesus there's a lot of thoughts there's a lot of condemnation there's a lot of voices brother sister oh my but there's only one voice that matters that's the one we want to get to amen you might have you might say brother Nathan I got nothing to offer him all I got is a bunch of broken pieces my heart's been crushed to bits by my life experiences amen that's all she had was a little little alabaster box and it was the purchase of a lifetime of failure it was the rewards of sins and mistakes and unfortunate circumstances it was a box of hurt and sorrow and grief and condemnation but that didn't stop her she said I got to get it to him and I'll wash his feet with my tears and I'll dry them with my hair oh that should be our attitude today Lord whatever it takes whoever's preaching what ever is going on let me get to Jesus today amen yeah we need to go there we need to go there I don't believe the Lord put this on my heart for no reason today amen but there's somebody needs to get to Jesus and get some things taken care of you've been carrying too long you need to go there brother sister you say brother Nathan I'm I haven't opened that door in a long time friends throw every door open open up every window take a up into every closet and just get to Jes Jesus today get to Jesus today he knows what to do with it no sense us keeping it around oh I'm afraid to open the door brother Nathan if I get in that what I don't even know how act what if I scream and shout in front of everybody or speak in tongues or dance or whatever whatever will happen brother it'll be from the heart if you'll go to him with your heart that's the right approach brother Bram said touch that little button go there go there got to go there oh my brother BR you say well brother Nathan I I'm trying I'm I'm working on it you know I I I'm trying to get it taken care of you know then I'll take it to him once I got it fixed up a little bit brother Bram said for justification you never did anything in the first place there's only one thing it would have to be God himself that came and took your place in the form of a son Son of God and washed you by the water of the word not the denomination it's the word that washes you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed friends how are you going to be CL how are you going to be cleansed how you going to get that heart purified if you don't take it to him amen and let the word wash you let it in don't Dam it up amen but let it flow let it wash this morning and let it cleanse Hall there are so many Christian people sitting in churches message churches amen and people sitting and they got they got closets full of baggage from a from lifetimes they've been hurt they've been abused they've been betrayed they've been taught wrong they've been lied on Amen the churches have hurt them Ministries have hurt them friends have hurt them but the message never hurt anybody this word never hurt anybody amen this word was sent to heal the broken hearts not hurt Hearts heal Hearts amen I don't care who hurts you get to Jesus today get to Jesus he's got the answers amen he can wash you amen the message isn't a church the message isn't a Ministry the message isn't people it's the word and the word is God Amen and the of the water of the word can wash that heart it can cleanse you even as the preaching the word Goes Forth it has the power in it amen to loose you from the things you've been holding on that stain that Mark that hurt that trauma could be washed away in a moment today amen it's the power of the word to do it it's the washing of the water of the word amen amen amen it's the Waters of Separation you know what those Waters were for Waters of Separation because there was a whole Camp of Israel not everybody was a allowed to Fellowship in that camp but the Waters of Separation was not to separate people out but it was to wash them so they could come in and brother sister this message did not was not sent to rule you out cut you out preach you out hurt you out amen no this message was sent to wash you and restore you to fellowship with him amen and put you into a body of Believers a church Universal with a Divine love like you never experienced amen it's love that can heal it's love that can that can bind up it's love that can restore and it can still do it today what are you saying brother Nathan I'm saying you can still be pure you can still be clean I don't care how long you've been carrying it amen it can be washed today amen it can be washed today you could still be made pure say brother Nathan my heart's so tore up Bible says if your heart condemns you God's greater he knows all thingsall Hallelujah blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God they shall see God go that's why I want a pure heart brother sister because if there one thing I want to see in my life I want to see him I don't want to live you know I don't want to live a lifetime as a message believer you know and have a good prosperous career and a nice home and a nice family and just just see see good you know good Earthly rewards and Comforts I don't want to just see you know a a Ministry where I get to travel the world and and have nice experiences and make friends and all those kind of things that's that's wonderful but that's not what I want to see amen but if there's one thing I want to see in my life amen if I get 60 70 years on this Earth and die amen there's one thing I want to see I want to see him I want to be pure enough in my heart till the blindness would be taken off and I could see his reality see his love see his face see him that's what the message was sent Amen to produce a people that know their God that's the ones that will do exploit you talk about power you talk about Greater Works amen get your heart clean by the message of the hour amen it'll write another book of Acts behind it you won't even have to be involved hallelujah amen but what do we had amen we've had a lot of we've had a lot of dirty Waters a lot of you been around this message a long time you've seen a lot of nonsense but it wasn't the message brother brandom remember he talked about that Chinese laundr mats back in the old west and and they they had to they get a piece of paper they didn't speak English so they'd rip that piece of paper certain way and had to be something that could match to vindicate amen that that that those clean clothes belong to an individual brother Bram said this message has matched everything the the Bible spoke of for this hour it's a perfect match brother sister it's a Vindicated word it is the word it is the Messiah sign amen now he said now if you got some dirty clothes turn them in Hallelujah that's all it takes brother sister you say brother Nathan I got a lot of dirty stuff piled up just turn it in and let the message begin to wash you that's why we've had a lot the waters have been dirtied because people have misused this message and they'll take a little bit of this bleach but they'll take a little of their personal opinion they'll take a little bit of their private Doctrine they little bit a little bit of this is how we used to do it in my church and this is the way my grandpa felt about it and this is you know this is our family tradition and there's my private interpretation and here's my besetting sin or whatever it is and mix that with the word friends that's not what's needed what you need to do turn all that junk in and let this word wash you turn in your dirty laundry you're not going to wear a you're not going to wear a white robe with dirty underwear but you got to turn it all in so you can be clothed for Rapture clothed to rule clothed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ make yourself ready brother sister turn it in amen many people have misused this message they've dirtied the waters there's been a lot of wicked Hearts what what is it brother what's it all about they just haven't been washed but everywhere this message has been allowed to wash people amen it's been the cleanest most loving amen most character-filled most wonderful people you could ever rub shoulders with why because the message works the Water Works brother sister this water is able to wash the worldliness off of you and and these Waters of Separation can separate you into amen that holy of holies amen it can it can it can draw you it can separate you onto him and you can be clean Hallelujah you can be clean oh brother Nathan well I opened the door to him many years ago brother Brandon preached a few times about some doors inside the door right and that's where the trouble is brother sister amen is because the message works when you give it your whole heart he said yeah if you seek me you'll find me but come with your whole heart amen trust in the Lord with all your heart lean not on your own understanding and all your wayes acknowledge Him and he'll direct your paths and so what happens is we forsake leadership because we just won't let them in I know that's simple preaching but it's good for me I reckon it's good for you there's doors inside the door brother BR said one of those doors is called Pride oh yeah Lord come on in come on in you're welcome to the living room you're welcome to the kitchen just don't go in that bedroom I got some stuff in there I don't want you to see Lord I I I'm not ready I'm not ready for you to go in there that's private but that's the relationship he wants with you he wants that private that's deeper than you think it is he wants that bedroom relationship with his bride he wants a bride who's given her given him her whole heart amen but what is it it's Pride what will somebody think or you know I'm I'm I'm a great big somebody you know I I'm too revelated to be struggling with this or that so Lord just don't go there let's just ignore that let's just put that no friends amen let him in amen don't be like non non was a great man he was a great big guy you know oh and he had a wonderful you know oh he had a he had a wonderful testimony how he left houses and lands and he left his old denomination he came to sit under a prophet and hear a prophet's instruction and he went 99% of the way with the message until until he needed to be washed and he thought you mean you mean you want me to act like those bunch of holy rollers and I I got all this revelation you know and I'm I'm an elder in the church and you want me to just get so you want me to get so deep in the spirit this morning till i' ball my eyes out and cry out and act who God knows how you know and you want me to go there brother sister just go all the way amen just just go all the way if you want to be clean but see people come most of the way amen but they just won't quite sell out it's because of Pride cuz we had a lot of great big men and great big women around this message but the message isn't for Great Men amen you see your calling brethren not many mighty not many noble not many great big guys come to this message amen but but see it's somebody who can be humble somebody will just throw open the door say Lord you go in there you sort it out hallu amen come to the door inside the door amen I I I don't want to get so big I don't want to be some big preacher that can't listen to what a prophet said and humble myself to a message and let God have my whole heart cuz I'm a big somebody oh brother I want to be washed I want to be cleansed I want all the leprosy taken from me I want to go all the way with what God's Prophet said amen amen it's the soul without vanity that'll Ascend the hill of the Lord the soul without vanity shall stand in his holy Place brother BR said Queen of Sheba he said you know when God goes to dealing with a human heart no matter how big they are he lets them see how little they can get open that door open that door I I I think about that story brother Bram talks about heartfelt religion there was a man down in the the Old South and uh just poor man black man I think it was in the Reconstruction Era and you know he's working for the boss and the boss said why are you smiling all the time how come you're always so happy he said well I got heartfelt religion boss and boss said man I said there's no such thing he said well that that's that's your opinion uh uh difference is I I know what I got you know and so went on like that and finally the boss says you know I think I'd like to have some of that heartfelt religion you know I I think I need a little bit of what you got he said okay boss well and so the boss said well how about we go up in the hay loft where and there's a lot of soft straw up there and it won't hurt my knees when I kneel down and my wife won't be able to hear me pray up there nobody will know we just hide up in the hoft and I'll get he said no boss heartfelt religion ain't up in the hoft he said well we'll go around behind the barn you know back by the cornfield nobody will be able to see me nobody will be able to hear me it'll just be you know you know nobody nobody will see if I cry or something like that nobody will know you know I'll just go and he said boss there's no heartfelt religion behind there he said well then where is that heartfelt religion he said over there in the pig pen amen down in that mud amen you kneel down with me there we'll pray together we'll get some heartfelt religion amen there's a lot of people that miss out on a real heart-to-heart experience with God Amen just because it would take a little shame just cuz it would cost him a little dignity but brother sister I don't care what I where I have to go don't care how I got to act I don't care what he wants to do with me but I want that heartfelt religion I want a pure heart I want that reality oh I want it friends I want it every day of my life amen when things start piling up I don't want to slam the door on it and try to hide it I want the word to go there discern it cut it out of me perform surgery on me amen bind up my broken heart cuz this one gets broken too just open the door friends brother BR said all it takes is your check and your sincerity be real careful as you're Che checking out search me Lord try me is there any evil in me if there is Lord let me lay it down right now at your altar he said I lay it down I put my feet upon it and when I walk away it's going to lay there I love that the power of your blood will consume it I want to be an overcomer I've got something that's bothering me Lord how many got something bothering you today I want to overcome this morning I can by you I've been told that by your word and as I pass out of this building this morning to know that it's put in the tub of God's bleach it'll never be remembered no more he said our heart's thinking now he said now your heart's the door to the soul he said is there something you want to lay aside this morning something you want to overcome and you've tried it so hard but this morning you're just going to quit trying you're just going to accept what he did he said just raise your hand say Lord I want to overcome a certain thing that bothers me see that's that's simple Christianity that's what we need just open the door let him do the cleansing let him do the purification friends and if your heart is pure then your hands will be clean CU it flows from the one to the other Jesus said out of the out of the Treasure of a the good Treasure of a heart good comes out if it's evil in the heart evil comes out whatever the condition of the heart everything flows from there and but we spend all our time as Christians trying to fix everything up on the outside amen but you got a heart problem brother sister it's a heart condition start in the heart amen I know as a young man you know as a young person I struggle for many years and a real turning point in my life was to realize hey how about instead of trying to fix everything on the outside what about F what about just falling in love with Jesus and I found that I haven't got so far in my Christianity that I don't need to be reminded day by day hey stay in love with Jesus Jesus amen fall in love with Jesus why don't you read your Bible why don't you pray amen and draw closer to him that way and see how many of these things go away automatically cuz now you got it flowing from the out from the inside out amen that's absolutely right the Bible says where your treasure is that's where your heart will be get the heart fixed first amen because it's all of our effort David said God you don't desire sacrifice if you wanted it I'd give it but what you want is a contra heart brother Bram said people even study too much you say you can study the word too much brother Nathan brother Bram said people study too much and they even have mental breakdowns and things cuz they're studying about the Lord he said you got to quit it you don't have to do that the only thing you have to do is fall in love with him and just go right on loving him now obviously I'm not preaching against studying and we believe in teaching and getting deep down in this but look fall in love with Jesus and then you'll want to know about him then you'll want to be taught you'll want him to teach his statutes see it's not all this outward stuff it's the condition of the heart has the message turned your heart back or is it failing for fear brother Bram said you might have the biggest church there is in the country see outward you might have more money than you ever got you might associate with a better intellectual crowd and wear a better suit of clothes but brother God wants a clean heart and Clean Hands he wants a clean up church and then he can show himself oh friends with all my heart I want to handle this word with Clean Hands I want to run with this message so hard amen I don't want there to be any Nathan Ericson in it other than what God put in there amen I I I I I just want I want Clean Hands I wish I could I wish I could put into words where you could see what's in my heart my hearts cry you know back there at home involved a little bit in the leadership of the church we don't want to build a church amen we don't want to build a Ministry we don't want to build a following or a platform we want to build the kingdom we want Clean Hands and clean hearts and amen we want to do something right and pure and good in this world and help God's people oh God Give Us Clean Hands Paul said we've renounced hidden things of dishonesty we don't walk in craftiness we don't handle the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves for We Don't Preach ourselves amen We Don't Preach we don't preach Dale linga We Don't Preach William bradam we preach Jesus Christ amen crucified amen and crucified aresh in this day amen a word coming to the Gentile Church which is able to turn the hearts back not only to Acts chapter 2 but to Genesis Amen to Eden to Paradise Amen to to what human beings were created to be full restoration brother sister Hallelujah for God who commanded light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our heart has shine in our heart oh my Clean Hands thank you Jesus Clean Hands Timothy said the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and a good conscious Faith unfeigned No put on yeah no no no mouth saying one thing heart saying something else no charity from a pure heart love amen Peter said you you've purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit into unfeigned love of the Brethren you know people preach a lot of love and unity nowadays we need Divine love we need Divine love brotherly kindness is wonderful that'll hold a lot of that'll hold things together but we need that Capstone to come down amen and love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever the Bible says let love be without dissimulation I I just like to put in your mind this morning it's not really my topic but I I'd like to put in your mind what what to think of Love Without dissimulation in other words love without any without any uh ulterior motive without any not not you know brother Mike I I love you and we're buddies and and and we got a great friendship and I and I and I really love you and I know that if I show you a lot of love you'll probably drive me home tonight Amen brother Dale I love you and and we got good fellowship and I love your spirit and everything and and and in the back of the mind but but if I really love you you'll invite me to come preach from time to time and you know if I really love brother Jared and sister Julie and if I love them real good we're going to eat some good food this afternoon and but what about love without dissimulation amen put in your mind a picture of a church that just love you know not love thinking about what you might get not love with any knowledge of reward not you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours just love just love God give me a pure heart like that just to have love in my heart for somebody else I don't care if my back gets scratched but but I'm a vessel of love amen and I want that pouring out of my life so much love without charity out of a pure heart love unfined love without dissimulation amen see that's the thing we talk a lot about love and we but but a lot of it's human love and and and human love is wonderful brother sister I have great love in my human heart for this congregation these people what the problem with human love is that it's got fear in it perfect love casts out fear human love still has it human love feels jealous human love has worry human love that's how many times have you seen a situation in a church and and and there's a real issue and people are on one side and the other and there's a division and everybody loves everybody and it still went wrong in a family in a church and whatever it is there was no shortage of love but it was human love we need Divine love to come amen and purify these heart hearts and and take all the fear out of it because Divine love fixes the issue amen now now where is divine love it's in the Holy Ghost that's in you that potential is in you that's what we need to be expressing this day amen all Brother Ray backom has been preaching wonderful series on it because to think to think that that that you know brother brandom when that bull came running at him he did what you and I do somebody says something a little off about one of your kids some kind of somebody kind of brings up a little doctrinal dispute or some a little insult or a little rubs you the wrong way a little bit what do you do you go for your gun and that's it brother br's representing all our Humanity when he goes for his gun but then what happened he said something else projected amen something from somewhere else came into this heart that's my desire today Lord amen let let that Divine love overwhelm me purify my heart purify my thoughts purify my intentions and give me Clean Hands amen that I can that I can address the needs of of my brothers and sisters without infecting anybody amen but cleanse me sterilize me for service Lord amen Clean Hands well you know we're running out of time amen but uh uh uh uh I just trust that's an encouragement to you but amen you know that that we we need it brother sister we need a heart washing today we need a good old fashion heart cleansing we need the Holy Spirit you know not just to come by the church and and and and uh and and just be worshiped and get and and and and enjoy our emotional praise and all those things which is wonderful but we need amen a God that comes in and breaks bread and breaks it binds up the broken pieces oh we need we need God in the heart we need God in the heart cuz that's where the battle is greatest battle ever fought in that spiritual realm in the hearts of human beings and that you know you get to place in your life where you just get so down in your heart and then it seems like your life is falling apart and we looking around like what what's happening why Lord how did I even get to this condition it seem like overnight everything just piled on and piled on one thing after another and it never doesn't rain but it pours and brother Ram said because it's when Satan gets you discouraged that's when he can really pour it on you amen when he gets you in your heart discouraged he said now but God doesn't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy that heart inside you it was made to be happy now what we do is we get it kind of patched up good enough where we can still belong to a church and mostly get along with everybody and keep to ourselves and we can coexist with our hurts and we can cope with all of our baggage and we can just make it work but don't you just want to let him fix it amen would wouldn't it be better to not carry all that all the time wouldn't it be better amen to have such a relationship with God where you can hear his voice saying come to me come don't don't be afraid to go there come to me I I'll take that burden off you my my yol's not heavy it's easy my burden is light come to me I'll give you rest from the things that torment you in the night thank you Lord the things that the things that bombard you I'll give you rest from that I believe he wants to do it today I believe he wants to do it today I know it's been a little bit of an unusual service so we might as well stay unusual and share just a little a little silly story I like to tell I was out preaching one day in Pennsylvania at brother Jim shakes church and and so I was out of town over there and we had this this uh this rascally raccoon that got into my attic it had been in and out of my attic and then and while I'm gone it had the it had the nerve to die up there and so so I get a call from My Wife and I'm gone I'm not home you know she said that raccoon died up there and she said and she said and the whole house just reeks there's just a stench all through the house and there's some nasty stuff dripping down on the front porch and and she oh she said it's horrible I can't even I can't live here I can't stay here this is terrible and you're gone and this is awful you know and and it was just amazing you know raccoon now was the big old raccoon but but but even a big raccoon is not a very big animal you know think about it it's just a little animal up there in the front front of the house in the Attic but because of that dead raccoon in that up in my sfet my living room sankk my kitchen sank my bathroom stink my basement stink my bedroom stink the whole house stinks it's a big stinking mess there's not one part of my house you would want to be in CU of a little dead raccoon say brother what in the world are you talking about well sometimes in your life you know you get to a place where you get a just just a little discouraged you get a little heavy heart and all of a sudden the devil starts pouring it on and you get to where brother Nathan my life's a mess everything I just feel like I'm a complete wreck and I don't know even where to start my prayer life stinks my devotion stinks my attitude stinks my church attendance
