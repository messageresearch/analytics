way we pray amen hey man it's good to be here this morning amen just uh was unsure what to do with the weather and but it's a pretty decent day out today and I tell you honestly we're just gonna speak a few minutes and next Sunday will be communion and foot washing and testimony your specials it's uh it's really a service once a year or twice a year that people can share testimonies or different things but next week the service will not be posted next week it will not be posted so we'll let those ones know that might be watching our regular ones like Jim and Linda and Chatham amen are different ones but next service will I believe that we'll have a service that's private to us and and uh private to testimonies are private and and I also will share private things amen for our church that uh don't need to be posted amen I share this with you you know before we go into the word I believe with everything within me with my whole heart and my whole being that many many Believers are missing God missing God a million miles missing God amen a day that the world celebrates Christmas we know we celebrate Jesus birthday today knowing that today's not the day amen knowing today's actually the sun God's birthday or the season of the sun God's birthday amen and we understand all that you don't have to believe that from your church standpoint you can think that brother Dale's crazy you can find that on Google I listen to movies yesterday videos yesterday on Google showed the church ages and how I believe it was Nimrod and and filter traded paganism and the sun god with Christianity to the extreme you can go right and Google the Tabernacle of the temples and a lot of those things are still standing today in ancient cities where the sun god the sun god's picture is at the front and and the Halo is is slights of stone where the stun would shine through the wall of the church and put out a ray of sun thing everything Satan does is to copy the Halo of Christ and and everything amen we know we know Jesus did come and we know it's real and we know it was the greatest plan of God that he came to save the world but we also realize that the world's made it commercialized blended it with paganism and most Christians majority of Christians 99 percent of Christians are falling for it for flying Sinker you know I watch videos everywhere but in the U.S or in North America U.S Canada and Europe they have full-fledged knockout camp meetings I've seen altar calls where there was if there was one person at the altar there was a hundred knockout prayer means not from December 22nd till January 2nd but in North America where it's rich and increased with Goods that they don't need God we don't need God we don't think we need God amen the prophet said to every country the Richer they get the farther they move from God the more educated they get the farther they move from God amen God help us amen but we know in all of that that it's the greatest time to live the greatest times let's turn to Matthew we're just uh speak a few minutes on our message from last Sunday and they're looking forward to next Sunday and we're just gonna kind of a HomeTown uh let your hair down type of a service and share your heart next Sunday and different things and Matthew 1 and verse 22 and 23. this is talking about we talked about living in the thoughts or the mind of God being in the thoughts and mind of God and this is what today represents is God had a plan to save Mankind and bring him back to himself and he came himself in the form of a son to redeem mankind amen the perfect sacrifice amen now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel being interpreted God with us we we mentioned last Sunday and and great detail and we've showed that that everything God has done was in his thoughts and his mind before the foundation of the world and and much or all of it is recorded in the Bible and much of it was wrote In Secret form and and God sent his Secrets or identified you may have your seats and God identified his Secrets through His prophets so we could reveal the exact same Bible which God had anointed from the beginning but we would understand it more clearly and we showed that in the prophecy of the Bible it was all grace everything was Grace everything God said that you should do or shouldn't do was Grace it was what you needed to do or not do to have eternal life everything was Grace and we mentioned many many many things and the Bible was Grace and we want to look at one person in the Bible that almost refused Grace and we want to look at another person that did refuse Grace and we want to show it now we want to see you know most of the world is looking at something besides the word of God they're looking either at a man or a church Creed or or what a good man said or or or following it more than what they're following the word of God but we want to follow the complete word of God in in canoe like so with dovetails from the Genesis to Revelation and we know that the Old Testament of the Bible was wrote in types and shadows and not the Old Testament much of it is not directly for us today because it was only a shadow or a poor image of what was actually going to come in perfection in the New Testament the perfect example of that is the sacrifice in the Old Testament they sacrifice lambs and goats which is a very poor quality of the Lamb of God Amen but when the Lamb of God came all the Old Testament sacrifice of lamb and goats was done away with so there's much of the Old Testament much not all but much of the Old Testament was just a type of the perfect that was coming but now that we have the perfect they met so many people are looking at other things for their peace and for their Grace and will be lost in the process amen and we want to look look at his story and it starts in Second Kings 5. amen it talks about a great man here that was the captain of the king of Assyria a man not a Godly Man at all but a great man in his time a great warrior and he had came and had taken over the children of God and taking captives and that man had a type of sin in his life now of course he wasn't a godly man or a Christian man but even non-godly and non-Christian men can receive Grace Even in our day amen and here this this uh non-godly man had captured a Believer a little girl a little mistress and taking it back it's a slave captive and I'm sure if any of us were considered slaves or captives we wouldn't be helping our uh Master slave master uh to uh show Grace or save his life but she showed the true characteristics of Christ like God leaving heaven to come and save you and me an example of today and here in in Second Kings 5 maybe we would read uh verse three and she she was a she said to her mistress she said I would to God that my Lord the with we're with the prophet that was in Syria Samaria Samaria and that he would recover of his sin it was actually leprosy that the nahem had and leprosy was a type of unbelief or sin in the spiritual realm and here in ahem being a great warrior of of uh the the country and of the king he could not relay his sin to the people and if you take that physical to spiritual see in the natural if the if his soldiers knew he had leprosy they would put him in the leprosy Colony if he would have got completely lost his job if any of the people in the town or the press or the government or even the king himself would have knew he had leprosy he would have been completely denounced to nothing and like they have most of us today if we have sin in our life we try to hide it so we don't get denounced and he hid and covered up his sin but a girl this mistress that lived right in the household seen him when his shirt was off see he would wear long sleeves and high snacks and that and he would cover up his leprosy so the world couldn't see his skin because his sin was polluted with sin and here this man found they they rehearsed the words of the maid can you imagine the maid just picture this can you imagine the maid a Slave probably raped molested beat dragged tied up handcuffed rode in the army camp you can only imagine what happened to her sold for the highest price to this great man he had lots of money probably she was beautiful because he was with the captain of the host of the army can you imagine through all that she showed Mercy to a man that probably had raped her probably had handcuffed her probably had beat her and had bought her like property like a dog or a cow that's amazing and that's a perfect type of what Christ did for us Christ left the Splendor of Heaven to get spit on to have his beard pulled to get whipped and beat for you and for me even when he left the Splendor of Heaven can you imagine the ground the downgrade it would have been coming to A Manger and a stable in a barn not even no room for him and a common decent home where birth would been performed and this is a perfect type and they've heard the words of this maid and so they went and told it to the king of Syria the captain of the host's boss and they portrayed it and so the king of Syria being that he could buy his way into heaven and by his way to Salvation a lot of Believers believe that too that's why they closed their churches on days like today the rich people but the poor people are there by the thousands in open churches the king is Syria said go to the king of Israel now remember they had beat the king of Israel in war and brought their people back its slaves so they're going to the very country that they had invaded and brought slaves back said go to the king of Syria and he took ten talents of silver 6 000 pieces of gold that would have been worth a fair bit of coin today and 10 changes of ramens see he was trying to buy his salvation for nahab his Top Dog King man in the army and the king of Israel being a human being being an honest man God bless you brother Fred and Merry Christmas being an honest man and a a human man when he when he realized that the king of Syria had sent him this these gifts and asked for such a ridiculous thing that no way in the world could anybody heal leprosy no one in the world could ever take away sin until Christ Jesus came in a Manger amen no one could do this he says what does he think I am does he think I'm a God that I could heal leprosy but there was a prophet in the land of Israel amen God had Kings but God had a prophet and his first and perfect way was prophets God never desired for Israel to have a king but God had a prophet called Elisha and he heard what the king had done in Israel actually the King when he heard that Syria had sent this money and was trying to buy their way into heaven trying to buy their way out of sin and tried to buy their way that's what the world's doing what do you think they're doing sending billions billions with the B hundreds of billions to fight armies and buy other people off around the world our Prophet said you can't buy your friends the states don't realize that yet or most governments they send countries that are depressed and and and and and they take advantage of and they'll send them gifts to pacify them amen they're leaders it'll never work and here the king of Israel when he realized that he had these gifts and he knew that in his own power he could never save mankind he could never save nahem of leprosy he rent his clothes and went into mourning but the prophet of God heard about this and he wasn't operating under the flesh he wasn't operating under fear he wasn't operating under the trend of the day and he wasn't operating under the trend where hundreds of message churches would be closed on Christmas he was operating under the anointing and power of God and here the Prophet Elijah heard what the king of Israel had run his clothes and he said to the king he said send that man to me send him to me that was no fear involved in that that that command there was no fear at all and so nahem came with his horses and his riches and all of his gold and silver and he came with his best Cadillac Chariot can you imagine it had it had ceramic gold knobs and roll up Windows and all these things and he stood outside the door of the house of God you know never before in the history of the world has Christ been on the outside of Ben's hearts and but on the outside of the church knocking never once in the church ages but in today's day was Christ on the outside of the church knocking trying to get in the very building he owned but the people didn't want no part to do with them because they loved the Pagan worship better then they loved the Christian worship that'll never be more relevant than it is rake today if this church was in any country but North America or the UK that well it there'd be people on the walls because they're not caught up in Pagan worship and they're not rich and increased with goods and here here the prophet knew he was on the outside but he didn't treat him with the modern day politics that's in most churches and governments today he didn't treat him any different see the Bible says that if you treat somebody different that's got a gold ring that somebody in gay clothing than somebody that don't that it's a sin and you're guilty of the whole law which is the word of God amen so here Elijah never the prophet he never even went out to greet him you might say that he never had the gift of hospitality can you imagine can you imagine if the president or the the leader well it wouldn't be nothing to have the leader of our country but the leader of most countries come to your house and you just have the kids answer the door amen this was also a country that had beat up on them and probably could have did it again and the prophet says in verse 9 it said that the prophet sent a messenger onto him and said go down to the river and dip seven times see seven times is perfection seven you look in the Bible everything to do with seven was God in Perfection and the fullness he said dip seven times in your flesh will become clean I want to show you something this morning just like the prophecy we read earlier in Matthew where it says now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord of the Lord by the prophets but all this was done including this which was just spoke by Elisha to nahab behold that Nahum could be clean if he would just follow the word of the Lord spoken by a prophet most people don't want nothing to do with that amen and I'm not just talking about a major prophet but even a man of God people today in North America and most of the world are unteachable where God's concerned there's I seen a post the other day and see most people and I might share more of that next week but most people have a damage of God in their mind and they're unteachable to be changed past that and here Elijah said you just this was prophecy he said you go down to the river Jordan it was a dirty muddy river probably had crocodiles and catfish in the bottom and there was nothing clean there was no sand or stone around there no see in the bottom but the prophecy was you dip seven times and when you come up the seventh time you'll be cleaned and naham this he answered this like most Believers today when you try to show them the word of God and try to show them the balance of what God Vindicated through a Vindicated prophet and show them the secrets of the word Nam was Wrath and went away and said behold I thought surely he had come out and put on a Big Show and stand before me this is verse 11 and call on the name of the Lord and strike his hand over the place and I would recover in a miraculous Miracle that's what most people are looking for that's called Hollywood and it's not real amen God wants you to humble yourself and come to prayer meeting and and anything that anybody got from God they had to strive and and labor for amen anything that anybody got from God and behold the the the naham's servant said now listen you got leprosy and you're going to hell all you got to do is accept Christ Jesus as your savior and you'll go to heaven sounds pretty simple to me but the Bible says that the way to destruction to hell is Broad that means like me wide and the way through eternal life is very narrow God help us he said see all you got to do now is just go down to that River and you will be saved for life you'll keep your job you'll keep your prestige you'll keep your bank pension you'll keep your bank paycheck the king will probably promote you you'll be the right-hand man of the leader but because you're too fat-headed and couldn't listen to a prophet which is the New Testament a prophets a minister because you couldn't listen to somebody tell you the truth and you got a picture of God in your mind and you got a picture of how you were going to be popular and he was going to come out and do a Big Show and wave his stick and call on the name of the Lord see because God didn't do it like you thought God should do it you're just not going to believe him at all and he turned to go home but his servants bidded and begged with them amen and at the last moment because because only of his servants and it's let me read that in 13 He said and his servants came near to him and spank unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid you to do a great thing thus would have done it but how much rather than when he saith unto thee they just go and watch and be clean you know if the many of the rich people and the great people of our day in the in the country and the history and all that if God would ask them to do something great where they would have been on TV and been really popular and there would have been a big show they would have converted to Christianity but because it was just a humble little bride in many of the ages just two or eight or just a handful and it wasn't popular like Hollywood even though it was simple they've refused to do it but because of his servant he went down and he did dip seven times and he followed the prophecy of the Bible like all prophecies that were supposed to follow that are for our our Grace for our life and he followed that as God had said see the Bible says as the lord gave to the prophets to say see when a minister or a prophet speaking it's if it's a if it's a man of God it's not that man speaking it's the lord gave him to speak that's what the Bible said and he went down and he washed and his flesh was clean as is a child and he was made completely whole just by hairs he would have refused Grace but because of his servants bagging and pleading with him said it's so simple and this world will go to hell in a handbasket because Christ made it simple to go to heaven literally just as simple as humbling yourself and saying saved me I was wrong I can't do it on my own it would go to world I want to look at another one and we're going to close here just very soon just another closing another one and the and the ending is not near as happy is the last one and that's a rich young ruler and if you would turn to mark this is recorded in four or five places in the Bible but I like Mark the best because of one part but it said that this certain man came running onto Jesus this was right after the disciples had tried to move the children away from Jesus and Jesus had said unless you become his children you won't inherit the kingdom of heaven and a certain man it was a Rich Young Ruler it came out to him to Jesus and said Master good Master how so I inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto them in Mark 10 18 He said why call us out be good for there's none good but God he was questioning him to see if he would recognize him as God and he said thou knows the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness nor to defraud your neighbor and honor your father and mother and the Rich Young Ruler said he said he answered and said master I have observed these all from my youth now this is the reason I picked Mark over the other gospels that had recorded this and in Mark 10 21 it says and Jesus beholding him loved him Jesus loved the world enough to come to a Manger and be born as a babe be raised by parents that were accused of having him before marriage be called the belzeba and the father of devils be spit and beat and brute upon the Bible says he came unto his own and his very own refused and his own received them not it was his very own family it was his very own people you might say it was his very own town that hung him on the cross and killed them and hear the the the Jesus seeing this Rich Young Ruler loved them you see he would have been a perfect clean Christian you say how can you say that well he said that he had done all the Commandments from his youth amen but he would have been the type of like the five foolish virgins that were perfectly clean but never had the Holy Ghost and Jesus said unto him he said one thing thou lack us you still love the world now it's very permanent this morning when you see how few it just is don't believe I you know my brother June from the Philippines was just here and Leo's preaching in the capital of Uganda is around the world thousands of people thousands hundreds I said something to brother June I said you know people here normally close their church for Christmas brother June told me he said this was his one sentence he said we don't do Christmas here I have one question for you on that answer how are those people going to the same Heaven that the ones here close their Church I can answer that for you they're not they're not the ones here that say they're message Believers and they close their Church and the other message Believers that are actually following God and they don't even do the Pagan worship and they have camp meeting they're not going to the same happen no they're not going you see that just saith the word of God because the Bible says there will be many surprises and many will come to me in my day and say Lord Lord didn't I do this and this and this and this not only goes to church a few times the Bible says forsake not the summoning of yourself together all the more as you see the world like today he said well I did everything but that one verse and he'll say well if you see if you defraud in this one part then you're guilty of the whole law if you defraud in one prophecy then you're guilty of the whole law and here Jesus answered he said thou lack us in one way he said sell whatever thou Hast and give it to the poor and then you come and you shall have Treasures in Heaven and follow me and he said he was sad at the same see he would have his riches for possibly a hundred years but eternal life would have no end so he factors he sacrificed a few years to Millions and millions and billions and then billions of billions of billions of years he said he was sad at the saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked around about and saith unto your disciples it is harder it is hardly how hardly so they that have riches enter the kingdom of God now that that's that's read in the Bible how hardly shall those that have riches enter the kingdom of God see that's eminent right now man those that have eyes can see that God's given ice and those that have God's ears can hear let's stand thank you Lord all the prophecies in the word of God we're given by the Lord given by the Lord spoken by a man for our Grace given by the Lord spoken by a man given for our Grace oh that's amazing for he alone is Worthy we'll sing the courses of that foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh come let us cry [Music] [Music] let us [Music] [Music] cry eyes the Lord hallelujah oh Hallelujah Lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord Jesus Blessed Be Your Name thank you Lord Jesus I want to tell you something this morning church everything you see with your natural eye is false and everything you see with your spiritual eye is thousands and thousands and thousands of times more true than you can see thousands God help us to keep our priorities straight the Bible says to lay up for Treasures where moth and rust will not corrupt thieves will not break through and steal amen I'll tell you everything you could see you know on a new show and a thing I have the thing I might read more last week but they're still refusing to let out the files of Kennedy's assassination and now they have had people that have read the files come forth and say it was the government that assassinated the president and that person that read the files said he said now listen to me he said everything you believe is false everything you believe is false this world is garbage everything in this world is completely you have to live here but don't put your roots down too far because everything is false I have a video on my phone where it says the whole world is operated by six Jesuit priests and everything is controlled by them and their head is Lucifer amen amen unbelievable we we think we get a new leader and everything will be fixed or we get a new this no no they're all puppets it's all false everything is false it's controlled by Satan but everything you see with your spiritual eye you know I knew a brother that was going blind actually went to the Workman man and he was going blind he was an old man 80 mid 80s and I remember we had just got married you none of you know me died before any of these were born and he was going storm blind and we were going there and Luanne said something to him about his eyesight and he said my physical eyesight is gone or very dim but he said my spiritual eyesight is better than it's ever been before God help me God help me and God help you everything you believe in the natural is false Lord Jesus we ask you to be with us and and just as we celebrate you today Lord Jesus and as your Prophet said it should be a day of worship and praise and honor for you and and your amazing the thoughts that you had for Redemption and Grace all your Bible was Grace and Redemption to to those that would accept it and believe it and see it Lord Jesus we give you the glory and honor today and bless all that have come in a special special way and may it be a great day of celebration for you Christ Jesus we praise you in your name we pray amen God bless you all
