[36:59] fighting the greatest battle ever
[37:03] fought we must have the fath of
[37:09] Abraham knowing God's word never face
[37:15] and if we just trust in him you find it
[37:21] all is
[37:25] well oh is
[37:28] well thank you
[37:30] Lord
[37:32] all is well thank you
[37:36] Jesus we have heard the message alone
[37:42] and it's all
[37:47] way there is a place a perfect rest
[37:55] behind the
[37:59] so rest little bride rest for all is

[38:09] well all is
[38:12] well you can come brother
[38:16] [Music]
[38:47] rest for is
[38:54] World Hallelujah
[38:57] I would like us to sing that song again
[39:00] because it's well with our
[39:04] soul the reason why we have to sing that
[39:08] song again is
[39:10] this there are people that are living
[39:13] just the way you
[39:15] living they go to the same work that you
[39:18] go
[39:19] to they drive the same car you
[39:23] drive probably they have more money than
[39:25] you do
[39:27] but they can't testify of that song that
[39:31] is well with their soul therefore for
[39:34] for me and you to make that testimony is
[39:38] the grace of
[39:40] God therefore let's sing that song with
[39:43] meaning and
[39:45] understanding because when you
[39:47] understand what God did for you you are
[39:52] super super
[39:55] super special in the hand of
[39:58] God all
[40:03] this

[43:45] oh last time I we we were here and we
[43:49] enjoy ourself and uh your pastor is
[43:53] we're becoming a good friend and
[43:56] yesterday we were amen we were here we
[43:58] were fellowshipping and you know the
[44:01] Bible said Iron sharpet Iron and uh uh
[44:07] to me anywhere you go in the
[44:10] world when the Bride come across the
[44:13] bride the fit like
[44:17] this and that is what God has been doing
[44:20] all over as I travel around the world to
[44:24] ministers whether you are in China
[44:27] whether you are in Japan whether you are
[44:29] in the jungle of
[44:31] Africa when the bride meet the
[44:35] bride because we came from One
[44:38] Source it doesn't matter whether you are
[44:41] black or white or green no no no no we
[44:44] came from God and we are ready to go
[44:48] back to God right uh this morning I have
[44:52] my family here a few months ago my
[44:57] my first daughter get married and she's
[45:00] not yet today and uh my wife and other
[45:04] uh of my family are here my wife is
[45:06] there and my son and uh we we thank God
[45:11] for giving us opportunity to be here
[45:14] again uh without wasting
[45:18] time uh let's stand and read the word of
[45:22] God what I want to talk about this this
[45:25] morning is
[45:27] life only come by the spoken word
[45:32] hallelujah
[45:34] life comes by the spoken word without
[45:40] the spoken word there's no
[45:43] life
[45:46] therefore me as a person can
[45:49] speak but if I don't have internal life
[45:52] in me what I speak is just a m word
[45:57] but have internal life in you and you
[46:01] speak it is no longer you that is
[46:03] speaking it is dity that is speaking
[46:06] through you
[46:08] therefore given us as the children of
[46:11] God that when we receive
[46:14] life we have power to give another
[46:18] person
[46:19] life not because of your your status no
[46:23] because you now become the hand and the
[46:28] leg and the mouth of God because God is
[46:31] a spirit God need a
[46:34] vessel that he could use therefore when
[46:37] your pastor come here behind the pulpit
[46:40] and he take the word of God and place it
[46:42] in his mouth and I begin to speak it is
[46:46] the day it is speaking therefore when
[46:49] deity begin to Speak Life begin to come
[46:52] upon the
[46:54] life let's take uh let's The Book of
[46:59] John chapter
[47:10] 1 one 1
[47:14] to5 hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus in
[47:17] the beginning was the word and the Word
[47:19] was with God and the Word was God the
[47:23] same in the beginning was God all things
[47:27] were made by him and without him was
[47:30] anything made that was made in
[47:34] him in him was
[47:37] life and the life was the light of
[47:41] men and the life shineth in the darkness
[47:45] and the Darkness comprehended it
[47:50] not let's go let's go to the Book of
[47:53] Genesis chapter
[47:55] 1 1
[47:57] to4 in the beginning God create Heaven
[48:01] and Earth
[48:03] period and the Earth was without form
[48:06] and void and the Darkness was upon the
[48:10] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[48:13] moved upon the face of the water and God
[48:17] said let there be light and there was
[48:20] light and God saw the light that it was
[48:23] good and God divided the light from
[48:27] Darkness Heavenly Father we thank
[48:30] you we give you
[48:32] praise Lord come to us this
[48:37] morning use my lips I hide behind the
[48:42] reviewer in Jesus precious name amen you
[48:45] may have your
[48:49] seat like I would saying
[48:52] life only come by the spoken word
[48:59] this
[49:01] morning I like to read
[49:03] quote the reason why I like to do that
[49:07] as I travel around the world because the
[49:11] the quote we read is not just my word
[49:14] it's not your pastor's word it is the
[49:17] thought of God that was given to a
[49:21] prophet and the prophet spoke it and put
[49:24] on books and tapes therefore
[49:27] that thought of God has been expressed
[49:31] is looking for a woman a
[49:34] man to take over just like Jesus God
[49:40] when Adam and Eve see in the Garden of
[49:44] Eden as they were going out of Eden God
[49:47] told them I'm going to give you a
[49:49] seed andto that before that God told
[49:52] them go and multiply and before they
[49:55] start the the spiritual multiplication
[49:59] the enemy came in and pervert the
[50:02] journey therefore the word of God has
[50:05] already been
[50:07] spoken there that word of God was
[50:09] hovering looking for a
[50:12] lady for almost 4,000
[50:15] years therefore one day that t that was
[50:20] spoken that was going around and found
[50:24] and a virgin and that thought was no
[50:28] longer just a spoken word but it was a
[50:31] manifested
[50:33] word yes sir that is what the message of
[50:36] the hour is God came down in this end
[50:41] time and gave his thought to a
[50:44] prophet and The Prophet by inspiration
[50:47] cut the thought of God sir and put it on
[50:51] books and tape therefore we the fivefold
[50:55] we have no message of our own the five
[50:58] phone is just like a unic we take what
[51:02] the prophet has spoken we
[51:06] just speak it back to the
[51:10] congregation and today I don't know what
[51:13] needs you
[51:15] have the word of God is able to change
[51:19] your situation the word of God is able
[51:22] to mold you to what God what God
[51:26] intended
[51:27] therefore before the foundation of the
[51:28] world God wanted to have a family
[51:32] therefore by the grace of God you are a
[51:35] part of that
[51:36] family not it's not of your chosing that
[51:40] is why every day even if you don't have
[51:42] money even if you don't have food to eat
[51:45] you should be the most happiest human
[51:47] being that live on the face of the Earth
[51:50] why because God before the foundation of
[51:54] the world he choose me he choose CH you
[51:57] he choose your pastor in this town why
[52:00] is it that out of the whole people I
[52:03] don't know how many people are in this
[52:05] town but only you God call you not only
[52:10] God call you when God call you have
[52:14] ability to hear from
[52:17] God not because of not because you are
[52:22] you are maybe not because you are better
[52:24] than your neighbor
[52:27] but when God begin to
[52:29] speak you something inside of you
[52:33] resonated something inside of you AG the
[52:36] word of God something inside of you say
[52:38] yes that is it that's what I'll be
[52:40] looking for I only use myself and as
[52:43] example when I was in the
[52:46] denomination I was looking for
[52:48] everywhere I go I know something was not
[52:52] right but when I come in contact with
[52:54] the message of the hour my good night
[52:57] said that's is it that is what I've been
[52:59] looking for it it do bypass my mind but
[53:03] it struck my soul and when it struck my
[53:06] soul I said amen and since then over 20
[53:10] years I have been on
[53:12] Revival you said brother what is Revival
[53:16] Revival is when God begin to open the
[53:18] world and you begin to see the plan of
[53:21] God and God begin to show you that you
[53:25] are not only see Jesus you are a part of
[53:28] the program of God it's good to see
[53:31] babraham as a prophet but you have to
[53:34] see yourself in the same
[53:39] program in a message the spoken word is
[53:42] your reganes let's listen to what the
[53:44] prophet
[53:45] said the prophet said paragraph 307 now
[53:50] this word of God is
[53:52] eternal God being infinite cannot speak
[53:56] one thing and then later change to
[53:59] something
[54:01] else that is the confidence that we have
[54:05] in our
[54:06] God our God is not like a pop who change
[54:10] every
[54:10] second our God is not like politician
[54:14] they move by the wind no Our God when
[54:17] the God speaks and that's when he spoke
[54:21] God know that what he spoke is coming to
[54:24] pass he said because every
[54:28] decision of god is
[54:31] perfect he cannot he cannot once his
[54:35] word is
[54:36] spoken he cannot die it live on and on
[54:41] he cannot die because it is God his word
[54:44] cannot more die than he can die that is
[54:48] the reason we read s
[54:51] John the first chapter that in the
[54:54] beginning was the one and the Word was
[54:57] with God and the Word was God and God
[55:01] made was made flesh the same word that
[55:04] was spoken in the beginning with his
[55:07] internal purpose came un over and was
[55:11] made flesh and dwell Among
[55:15] Us God is
[55:17] interal this God that is
[55:19] interal that was the time that God was
[55:23] unal being was a dwell in the spirit was
[55:28] a
[55:29] spirit and it does God has
[55:33] thoughts and who was that who was that
[55:36] thought it was me and you therefore I am
[55:41] a part of God you are a part of God and
[55:45] as we move prepared to go to the Rapture
[55:48] let me categorically say this that
[55:51] without the Without You The Rapture will
[55:54] not be complete
[55:56] amen without me this program will not be
[56:00] complete therefore if you are a child of
[56:03] God it doesn't matter how deep you have
[56:06] gone in sin it doesn't matter how how
[56:09] the enemy has chained you down because
[56:12] this is the age of the Redemption claim
[56:16] Christ is on the earth claiming his
[56:19] attribute Christ is on the earth crazy
[56:22] claiming his children therefore if you
[56:24] were whether you are a drunker whether
[56:26] you are fornicator whatever you have
[56:28] been that the devil has enslaved you you
[56:31] have been in the Captivity of the devil
[56:34] but I'm here to tell you that in the
[56:36] time of redemption clay God will find
[56:39] you wherever you are God will get you it
[56:43] doesn't matter if you are a seed of God
[56:47] God will reach out to
[56:49] you if you are in
[56:53] drug if the demon of nicotine hold you
[56:58] bound don't worry if you are a seed of
[57:02] God let me tell you Hallelujah there is
[57:05] power in the word of God because the
[57:09] word of God is eternal that power is
[57:12] able to break down chain and set you
[57:20] free in the book of Psalm Psalm 63 1-3
[57:26] say said oh God Thou Art my God early I
[57:29] will seek thee my
[57:32] soul tested for thee my flesh longer for
[57:37] thee in the dry and testy land where
[57:41] there's where no what is to see thy
[57:45] power and the glory so as I have seen
[57:49] thee in the sanctuary because thy loving
[57:52] kindness is better than life my lives
[57:57] shall praise thee now the prophet said
[57:59] in the message test testing for life he
[58:02] said
[58:04] now so after studying a little while I
[58:09] begin to remember that life has many
[58:12] different
[58:15] meanings therefore if life have
[58:17] different
[58:19] meanings listen to what the pr says
[58:22] sometime that
[58:23] life what people we call life life is no
[58:27] real life it is a perverted
[58:31] life therefore when all of us were born
[58:34] when I was born in this
[58:37] world that one life that I received was
[58:42] a perverted
[58:43] life the life you receive on the on your
[58:47] on your birthday when you were born that
[58:49] life was perverted because that was not
[58:52] the
[58:53] original God wanted me and you to live
[58:56] live
[58:57] internally but before his program could
[59:00] unfold the enemy came in but whether the
[59:03] enemy came or not the purpose of God can
[59:07] never be
[59:09] defeated he said it is a perverted life
[59:12] because that is that is not only real
[59:17] life that is he said is a perverted life
[59:21] because there's really only one life
[59:26] that is eternal
[59:30] life the reason why we are dying the
[59:33] reason why we are sick the the reason
[59:36] why you see hospitals built everywhere
[59:39] the reason why you see ambulance in
[59:42] different you hear the sing of the
[59:44] ambulance why is because this life that
[59:47] we have here is not an eternal life it's
[59:51] a perverted life it's a life that have
[59:55] de it's a life that have sickness it's a
[59:57] life that have all kind of
[1:00:00] trouble that is why the Bible said job
[1:00:03] said a man or woman that is born of a
[1:00:06] woman is a few days why because that was
[1:00:10] not the original plan of
[1:00:12] God but despite the fact it wasn't
[1:00:14] original plan of God God knows that Eve
[1:00:19] Adam and Eve was going to do what he
[1:00:22] did it was not a surprise to God no way
[1:00:26] God knew God allow it why did God allow
[1:00:30] it why why did God allow it God allow
[1:00:36] because in the B part of God's mind
[1:00:40] there were other attribute God want to
[1:00:44] manifest but he couldn't do
[1:00:47] that if he allowed Adam and Eve to live
[1:00:51] in the state of
[1:00:54] perfection and God have there are things
[1:00:57] God want to express that is why most of
[1:01:01] us as a Christian when you go through
[1:01:03] trial and persecution you go through
[1:01:07] difficult time in life just put a break
[1:01:10] hold on just ask yourselfself a question
[1:01:13] why am I going through what I'm going
[1:01:15] through sometime the devil will come and
[1:01:18] start interpreting something to us and
[1:01:21] if we are not careful we take what the
[1:01:23] devil said than what the word of God
[1:01:25] said
[1:01:26] there are things God plac in us that God
[1:01:29] want to express that we don't know
[1:01:32] therefore God allows situation to happen
[1:01:35] and some situation is
[1:01:37] unpleasant there are things in our life
[1:01:40] we ask question why why why and sometime
[1:01:43] we don't have an answer to it but God if
[1:01:47] you are a child of God you know you have
[1:01:49] come in contact with this Heaven the man
[1:01:52] who create Heaven and Earth and you know
[1:01:55] that this person who put everything here
[1:01:58] is your
[1:01:59] father let me tell you I have a son I
[1:02:02] have a daughter my plan and purpose for
[1:02:06] them is for them to be
[1:02:08] okay yeah I pray for them every day I
[1:02:12] pray that God should protect and guide
[1:02:14] them if me as a human being born evil
[1:02:20] can think of my family like that what
[1:02:22] about about God therefore whatever when
[1:02:25] you are sleeping God think about you
[1:02:28] when you are working whatever you are
[1:02:30] doing that is why the Bible said that
[1:02:33] the thought I have towards
[1:02:35] you is the thought of good not of
[1:02:39] evil therefore when you receive Christ
[1:02:42] and you know that inside of you you have
[1:02:45] made Christ I'm not talking of the
[1:02:49] imaginary
[1:02:51] God I'm talking of this God that is real
[1:02:55] that this God God I'm talking about is
[1:02:57] more real than
[1:03:00] this this God I'm talking about is not a
[1:03:05] a a president of the United
[1:03:08] States it's not the king of England no
[1:03:12] I'm talking of a that man that St that
[1:03:16] said let there
[1:03:18] be and he spoke that and he went back to
[1:03:22] rest and he know that what he spoke is
[1:03:26] going to come to pass therefore when God
[1:03:29] was creating a family God said I will
[1:03:32] have a
[1:03:34] bride it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:03:36] does it doesn't matter what
[1:03:39] happened I was telling the brother I
[1:03:42] said if God before the foundation of the
[1:03:47] world and when he choose you in
[1:03:50] Christ and he create a path for you yes
[1:03:54] and that path it's a land that you must
[1:03:57] travel on Earth and he said you are
[1:04:00] going to meet 1 2 3 4 5 six seven people
[1:04:05] on Earth and those people are going to
[1:04:08] come through you because you carry
[1:04:10] eternal
[1:04:12] life now you are
[1:04:15] tring you already you meant one two 3
[1:04:19] person you still have four people to to
[1:04:21] meet and you are in the plane going to
[1:04:24] Japan and all of a son the the pilot
[1:04:28] said oh let's fix our B and they try and
[1:04:33] that that play

[1:05:05] you no no power no sickness no cancer no
[1:05:12] diabetes
[1:05:14] nothing can happen to you why because
[1:05:17] there's a program that you are involved
[1:05:21] in and that go that program cannot be
[1:05:24] complete without you yes therefore God
[1:05:27] Is Watching Over You day and night when
[1:05:31] you are sick God Is Watching Over You
[1:05:36] When you go to the
[1:05:37] hospital God is watching over you
[1:05:40] everything you are doing if you are
[1:05:42] driving you may not see it there are
[1:05:46] angels yes that are designated
[1:05:48] Hallelujah to watch over you why because
[1:05:51] you carry
[1:05:54] life you are life carrier you are not
[1:05:58] just like every other human being there
[1:06:01] were human being who came up in the
[1:06:03] Garden of Eden who were not in the mind
[1:06:05] of
[1:06:06] God who came and Bess but you are a
[1:06:12] super and God have confidence so much in
[1:06:16] you that you
[1:06:20] realize
[1:06:23] listen in a message the prophet
[1:06:26] said any Greek scholar know that the
[1:06:30] word internal comes from the word
[1:06:33] zo which mean God's own life that's
[1:06:37] right the only way that you ever have
[1:06:40] life there's only one form of life and
[1:06:45] that is God's own life in you then you
[1:06:49] have internal life because he is
[1:06:51] internal there is and we are attributes
[1:06:55] of
[1:06:56] thought before there was even a
[1:06:58] foundation of the world or anything all
[1:07:02] this is just his thinking and we are
[1:07:06] displaying of his thoughts of what he it
[1:07:10] was you see a lot of people are asking
[1:07:13] questions why God allow war in UK in
[1:07:17] Ukraine why God allow this and that you
[1:07:21] see chaos
[1:07:22] everywhere I tell listen everything that
[1:07:26] is happening bad and good is to display
[1:07:31] that unseen God that God
[1:07:34] exist therefore what God is doing God
[1:07:37] allow things to happen so that he can
[1:07:40] reveal
[1:07:41] himself whether there is war in Ukraine
[1:07:44] God is using that to reveal himself
[1:07:47] sickness in your life God is using that
[1:07:50] to reveal himself when you have
[1:07:53] disappointment God is using that to
[1:07:56] unveil himself but what we need is to
[1:08:01] refocus not allow the enemy to tell oh
[1:08:04] it's because you did this because you do
[1:08:06] that because you do that no no no no no
[1:08:09] God is revealing if you if you are sick
[1:08:12] why did God allow children of God to get
[1:08:16] sick why why did God allow the children
[1:08:20] of God you go to church you believe God
[1:08:23] you you you try to please God
[1:08:26] you are a righteous mind you try
[1:08:29] everything all of a sudden sickness hit
[1:08:32] you and you try you pray and pray and
[1:08:35] the more you pray the more the sickness
[1:08:37] gets
[1:08:38] worse why did God allow all the all of
[1:08:41] that let me tell you my brother God
[1:08:44] allowed that to because if God did not
[1:08:48] allow sickness to come to your home and
[1:08:51] that same God that allows sickness to
[1:08:54] come to your home and turn around and
[1:08:57] deliver you from that sickness and you
[1:08:59] can't look oh my I used to sick now I'm
[1:09:03] okay and somebody come to tell you God
[1:09:05] doesn't exist you will never believe
[1:09:07] because you have an
[1:09:09] experience you know that God Is A
[1:09:14] Healer nobody can tell you right now as
[1:09:17] you're sitting down that God does not
[1:09:19] save nobody can tell you that God is not
[1:09:22] a savior because you are evidence
[1:09:26] you are a typical evidence that God
[1:09:30] save let me tell you my brother for me
[1:09:34] it is too late for the devil to tell me
[1:09:35] God doesn't
[1:09:36] heal because God has healed me not once
[1:09:40] not twice I can count it therefore we
[1:09:44] are epam of what God can do we are
[1:09:48] testimony we are we are attribute yes
[1:09:52] beautiful Jesus we are attribute that
[1:09:55] Our God who create Heaven and Earth not
[1:09:58] only that he create Heaven and Earth is
[1:10:01] interested in our
[1:10:04] life
[1:10:08] Hall
[1:10:11] no before the foundation of the world
[1:10:15] God had a
[1:10:16] program that program was God to come and
[1:10:21] live on earth with his attribute with
[1:10:24] his children nothing evil everything
[1:10:27] well and good but there were attributes
[1:10:30] in God that was locked in God that if
[1:10:34] God just let everything fine and
[1:10:37] ding those thing will not be
[1:10:40] expressed there
[1:10:42] God bring Lucifer into the picture
[1:10:47] yes
[1:10:48] listen I always believe this you said
[1:10:52] when God came out from this internal
[1:10:54] spirit
[1:10:56] yeah I was
[1:10:58] there you were there okay God Carry Me
[1:11:02] and You Now moving us from the internal
[1:11:05] Spirit into the
[1:11:09] logos now you were there as an
[1:11:13] attribute and the plan of God God wanted
[1:11:16] Lucifer to be in the
[1:11:19] picture and the only way to do that is
[1:11:21] to say Let There Be
[1:11:23] Lucifer and when God made that
[1:11:25] declaration you were there right
[1:11:28] therefore when God was speaking you were
[1:11:30] the one Speaking
[1:11:31] also therefore
[1:11:34] you gave the Lucifer his
[1:11:39] existence wow now when you come here the
[1:11:43] enemy trying to tell you you are nothing
[1:11:45] because the enemy know who you are the
[1:11:48] enemy come and preach the gospel of life
[1:11:51] then when God bring you from eternal
[1:11:53] spirit death attri he carry you into the
[1:11:57] logos and what was God doing God was
[1:12:00] traveling down to the Earth because God
[1:12:03] wanted me and you to be here God want us
[1:12:06] to me to go and preach in Africa God
[1:12:10] wanted the brother to be here preaching
[1:12:12] because we are the one who carry lives
[1:12:15] where would the life come from there's
[1:12:17] no life in the Pentecostal Church
[1:12:19] there's no life in aox churches there is
[1:12:21] no life in seven days Adventist there
[1:12:24] there are few people on Earth who carry
[1:12:28] Al you might go to they would look at
[1:12:30] you say who are you but we are the one
[1:12:33] who carry life therefore because we
[1:12:36] carry life who are we looking for we are
[1:12:37] not looking for
[1:12:39] people masses no when life meet
[1:12:43] life they recognize it amen when you
[1:12:46] receive this message you did not go to
[1:12:49] your pastor and let the pastor something
[1:12:50] inside of you
[1:12:51] strike because there is there's life in
[1:12:54] you that were looking for life and when
[1:12:58] the life come in contact with life you
[1:13:00] can't deny it it is there because that
[1:13:03] is the way God arranged his program
[1:13:07] therefore we came here with different
[1:13:09] conditions listen to what the prophet
[1:13:11] said I will restore says the Lord the
[1:13:15] prophet said without the baptism of the
[1:13:17] Holy Ghost you are only guessing at it
[1:13:21] you are saying what the word said you
[1:13:24] see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:13:26] way that life come into you right
[1:13:30] therefore if you don't have the baptism
[1:13:31] of the Holy Ghost you can read this
[1:13:33] message just like a literature
[1:13:36] book you can just say what the Bible
[1:13:38] said but that doesn't give you life but
[1:13:42] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:44] Ghost life inside of you spring up that
[1:13:48] life in you is looking for another life
[1:13:51] internal that is why we preach the
[1:13:54] gospel that is why my brother I come
[1:13:56] here every Sunday and preach why because
[1:13:58] we don't know who has life therefore the
[1:14:01] life that we preach is able to identify
[1:14:04] every life that sitting down
[1:14:06] here therefore when you when you receive
[1:14:09] that life you become an amateur
[1:14:13] God when you receive that baptism of the
[1:14:15] Holy Ghost it is deity in human flesh
[1:14:20] when you receive that baptism of the
[1:14:21] Holy Ghost what happened it is no longer
[1:14:24] you something transpired amen listen the
[1:14:29] prophet said you are saying what the
[1:14:32] word said you are saying what the pastor
[1:14:35] say you are saying what your mother said
[1:14:39] but when you receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:14:41] the Holy Ghost come in yes and baptize
[1:14:45] you into the person of Jesus Christ then
[1:14:49] you know by personal
[1:14:52] experience that Jesus Christ
[1:14:55] is the Son of God you see until you have
[1:15:00] that you are just
[1:15:02] guessing you are coming to the church
[1:15:04] because somebody told you about William
[1:15:07] Brown yeah right therefore many people
[1:15:11] stuck with William Brown because they
[1:15:14] see what the prophet did through his
[1:15:18] ministry but that Prophet did not bring
[1:15:22] bring you to focus on him there was a
[1:15:25] life of God in that Prophet that was
[1:15:29] calling for other life and therefore
[1:15:32] when that life goes out if you have life
[1:15:35] in you that life will identify you as
[1:15:40] the life of God Amen you said brother
[1:15:44] you know before this the sea open a lot
[1:15:47] of people were having an argument oh do
[1:15:50] we do we come into this Earth with the
[1:15:52] seed yes
[1:15:55] the very day you were born something
[1:15:57] happen in the spiritual realm if you are
[1:16:00] a seed of God because this body that was
[1:16:02] created was created for the seed of God
[1:16:05] to dwell in therefore the day you were
[1:16:07] born there was something that was
[1:16:09] happening that you are not aware of God
[1:16:12] put something what I will call a
[1:16:15] chep inside of you and he sent you out
[1:16:19] you do all kind of things and God you
[1:16:21] see many people the the technology they
[1:16:25] few years now they have been discovering
[1:16:27] about GPS they are copycat because God
[1:16:31] was the origination of the the GPS when
[1:16:35] God put you there and put his chip and
[1:16:37] God go arrest every time God was guiding
[1:16:41] you God was watching you no matter what
[1:16:44] you do God is like okay I have it
[1:16:46] doesn't matter let it do whatever he
[1:16:48] want but when the time the time and
[1:16:51] season is right for God to trap you you
[1:16:55] can hide you can run you can hide when
[1:16:59] it is a time for God to say enough is
[1:17:02] enough God will send somebody that have
[1:17:07] life to you and when that life begin to
[1:17:11] speak he will begin to attract the life
[1:17:14] that is in you and what happen it's just
[1:17:17] like when you you people are fing here
[1:17:20] my brother can tell you more when you
[1:17:22] plant a seed and that seed have life
[1:17:26] just only thing you need to do is to
[1:17:27] water
[1:17:30] it and as you water it there's a law in
[1:17:34] that se that he will reproduce himself
[1:17:37] that that is what we are but if you
[1:17:39] don't have life in
[1:17:41] you the prophet can come here and speak
[1:17:44] Miracles he can do all kind of Miracles
[1:17:47] here but because you don't have
[1:17:50] life if you don't have life what can he
[1:17:52] do he can perform miracle he can open
[1:17:55] your head and put the Bible you will
[1:17:57] never believe it because there's no
[1:18:00] life but if you have life what you just
[1:18:04] need to hear is the word of God because
[1:18:06] you are a part of the word of God you
[1:18:10] are a part without the word of God
[1:18:13] without you the word of God is not
[1:18:15] complete wow sir you see a lot of people
[1:18:19] the Bible go to the church yes but there
[1:18:22] is a time when God spoke there a journey
[1:18:25] that the spoken word had to be a
[1:18:28] manifested word brother AB spoke almost
[1:18:31] 50 60 70 years some of us were not there
[1:18:35] but why did you believe the
[1:18:38] prophet when the was here traveling
[1:18:41] different countries seven times we were
[1:18:43] some of us were not
[1:18:45] born we were not in his campaign none of
[1:18:48] us were there I don't maybe some was
[1:18:51] there but for me I wasn't born there no
[1:18:54] but what makes me believe this man that
[1:18:56] I never
[1:18:58] saw I some a man that I never see face
[1:19:02] to Faith what made me believe his
[1:19:05] word
[1:19:07] why because that
[1:19:11] man he
[1:19:14] internalized the Holy Ghost right the
[1:19:16] prophet said I have carried this Christ
[1:19:21] all along when he was born at about at
[1:19:24] 5:00 in the morning the pillar of fire
[1:19:28] came through the window and hang on top
[1:19:30] of this
[1:19:31] man and when he hang on top of this man
[1:19:34] right from that time to the time that he
[1:19:36] died he was carrying the Holy Ghost
[1:19:41] therefore the Holy Ghost was eternal
[1:19:43] life and he was not just giving it to
[1:19:45] him alone he was son for a mission right
[1:19:49] because there are other people who has
[1:19:51] life that that life this life
[1:19:55] had
[1:19:56] to and therefore when he stand on the
[1:19:58] pit he preached there were a lot of
[1:20:01] people in his campaign thousands of
[1:20:03] people they perform Miracles he hid them
[1:20:06] all of them gone they die without that
[1:20:10] life in them was not
[1:20:13] activated but here we are today we
[1:20:17] listen to tape we read the book and
[1:20:21] something inside of you said nothing but
[1:20:24] the truth
[1:20:25] something inside of you come alive what
[1:20:29] happened is because you yourself when
[1:20:32] you were born God in a supernatural
[1:20:35] realm the doctor couldn't see that your
[1:20:38] mom didn't see that God dropped
[1:20:40] something in you that can can agree with
[1:20:43] the word of God you were a part of God
[1:20:46] no matter how you travel no matter where
[1:20:49] you were born no matter whether you were
[1:20:51] born out of wedlock Hallelujah
[1:20:56] when the time come that life that God
[1:21:00] put inside of you will be activated and
[1:21:03] that is our mission the bride mission is
[1:21:08] to go that is the commission said go
[1:21:10] into the word and preach the
[1:21:12] gospel and the prophet said you should
[1:21:16] not go into the mission or a pastor
[1:21:19] without the Holy Ghost should not come
[1:21:20] up
[1:21:22] here because if you don't have the Holy
[1:21:24] Ghost you come upon here you know what
[1:21:26] you'll be doing you'll be swing your own
[1:21:30] seed and if you s if the person s his
[1:21:34] own seed that seed will not
[1:21:37] dramatize
[1:21:39] now listen to the
[1:21:49] prophet in the
[1:21:52] message exposition of the seven Church
[1:21:54] ages the prophet
[1:21:57] said
[1:21:59] Abraham was tried after he receiv
[1:22:02] received the word The Word of Promise
[1:22:05] most people think as soon as we we pray
[1:22:08] in Jesus name over a good
[1:22:11] promises that there there could be no
[1:22:15] trial but here it say Abraham was tried
[1:22:19] after he received the promise that is
[1:22:22] exactly correct according to the times
[1:22:25] referring to Joseph until the the time
[1:22:29] that the word came the word of the Lord
[1:22:32] was
[1:22:33] try
[1:22:36] now a lot of people can claim that I'm a
[1:22:39] message
[1:22:40] believer a lot of people can say well
[1:22:44] yes I'm the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:47] Christ and you cannot argue that with
[1:22:50] anybody because it has to be you and God
[1:22:53] Alone no person
[1:22:55] yeah amen no I don't care who that
[1:22:58] Pastor is have right to tell you that
[1:23:00] you are not a bride or to tell you that
[1:23:03] you are the serpent SE no no no no no no
[1:23:06] individual have anything to do with that
[1:23:09] we our responsibility is to is to throw
[1:23:12] the
[1:23:13] net is to preach the gospel and God is
[1:23:17] the one who knows where he seed is there
[1:23:20] are still seed of God in the Pentecostal
[1:23:22] we we don't bring we don't we don't talk
[1:23:25] down on them there are the seed of God
[1:23:28] who see in the Anglican Church there are
[1:23:31] seed of God who are see Jehovah
[1:23:32] Witnesses there are seed of God who are
[1:23:35] many organization but they are there

[1:26:46] will jump up on my bed I tell my wife
[1:26:49] this is something this is God my wife
[1:26:51] said take it
[1:26:52] easy take it easy because there are
[1:26:54] false I said no this is not a false
[1:26:58] prophet this this is the truth I've been
[1:27:00] looking for brother the church I was
[1:27:04] they disown me they sent me out and say
[1:27:06] yes I would better leave the church and
[1:27:09] gain eternal life than than stick with a
[1:27:12] church and I'm dead like a
[1:27:15] rock and I pack all the church things
[1:27:19] and I dump
[1:27:21] it and I went straight after seen
[1:27:25] something
[1:27:26] life attract life and when that life not
[1:27:30] book stand
[1:27:32] up and I saw that is life I'm looking
[1:27:36] for what
[1:27:38] happened all the
[1:27:41] books from the bible school I pack all
[1:27:44] of them went straight to the garbage I
[1:27:47] dump all of
[1:27:48] them why because life has just been spok
[1:27:55] and life was
[1:27:57] released and when life was released
[1:28:00] because there was life here there was a
[1:28:04] magnet therefore since then now there is
[1:28:08] nobody no demon can tell me that this
[1:28:11] message is not true because I have the
[1:28:15] experience it's not something that
[1:28:17] somebody hand to me no I had the
[1:28:19] experience I know what it is and that is
[1:28:22] what life does when life magnet life
[1:28:27] listen let me tell
[1:28:31] you just watch during
[1:28:36] spring you see a
[1:28:40] concrete on a dryway look at the edge of
[1:28:44] that concrete you see end flower bring
[1:28:48] out his head and when you when you lift
[1:28:51] up that that slab or the concrete
[1:28:54] you find out that that there was that
[1:28:57] was started in the middle of that what
[1:29:01] was it doing when the s o n was
[1:29:03] attracting that
[1:29:05] life that rock could not even stand it
[1:29:09] can't better because there's life in
[1:29:11] there therefore that life had to find a
[1:29:14] way to come out because there was
[1:29:17] another life attracting him that is what
[1:29:20] happened between me that is what is
[1:29:22] happening with us therefore when the
[1:29:25] life if you have life in you it doesn't
[1:29:27] matter whether you were prostitute it
[1:29:29] doesn't matter whe whether you are drug
[1:29:31] addict but let that light begin to shine
[1:29:35] when that Eternal Light begin to move
[1:29:37] brother I'm telling you what the enemy
[1:29:40] will do he has to give give you up
[1:29:44] because there is life that is calling
[1:29:47] for life and that is why we are here
[1:29:50] this morning the life of God call you
[1:29:54] wherever you were whatever you were
[1:29:56] doing the life you can't hide life how
[1:30:00] can you hide life no when you have the
[1:30:03] Holy Ghost in you brother you may not be
[1:30:06] able to explain the the Deep mystery of
[1:30:09] the message that is not what is needed
[1:30:12] no you don't even know how to you know a
[1:30:14] lot of people say Oh Brother Joseph oh
[1:30:16] how can how can I understand the seven
[1:30:18] Thunder the seven SE all this great
[1:30:21] mystery let me tell you the mystery of
[1:30:23] God is so simple the mystery of God is
[1:30:27] Jesus Christ coming to dwell in
[1:30:29] you therefore when Christ come and dwell
[1:30:32] in you all the mystery the seven seal
[1:30:35] the seven Thunder all everything you may
[1:30:38] not know how to explain it but that
[1:30:40] seven seal is living his life that seven
[1:30:44] seal Hallelujah is going to the kitchen
[1:30:47] to cook for your husband that seven seal
[1:30:50] it become a truck driver that seven seal
[1:30:53] is a wife that seven SE go to school
[1:30:57] that seven se you are the one
[1:30:59] manifesting
[1:31:01] that it's not that is what life is it's
[1:31:05] not you having the ability to explain
[1:31:09] it having the ability to explain it that
[1:31:11] is
[1:31:12] intellect there are people who have a
[1:31:15] photographic memory who can read one
[1:31:17] book that's it they can tell you what it
[1:31:19] is they can tell you the day brother BR
[1:31:22] spoke they can tell you everything

[1:31:32] of Eden the first showdown between God
[1:31:34] and Satan what did God do the devil take
[1:31:37] his head the man's head and God take his
[1:31:40] heart therefore when when the life of
[1:31:42] God come inside of
[1:31:44] you you may not be you may not be able
[1:31:47] to use good English to explain the seven
[1:31:51] seal but that is not what it needed

[1:35:11] confused was the one telling us do this
[1:35:14] do this do that this

[1:35:22] were maybe you came from different
[1:35:24] churches and you you want to do the
[1:35:26] right thing you go to church every
[1:35:29] Sunday but one day the seven SE
[1:35:33] appear it tell you you are not a
[1:35:36] Baptist you are not a Pentecostal you
[1:35:38] are not a Jehovah weakness you doesn't
[1:35:41] even belong to Canada when God in the
[1:35:44] beginning what God was doing God wanted
[1:35:46] to S seed on the earth and while he was
[1:35:49] swing that seed he came he take a
[1:35:51] handful of seed and throw it to to
[1:35:53] Canada and that is why you are
[1:35:56] here and he throw he take some handful
[1:35:59] of seed he throw it in Africa I was born
[1:36:01] in Africa I can't help it I would love
[1:36:04] to I would have love for me to born in
[1:36:06] Canada but God before the foundation of
[1:36:08] the world he know that I will be born in
[1:36:11] Africa he put a seed there and that seed
[1:36:14] was waiting for light s o n you were
[1:36:18] born in Canada God put you here and all
[1:36:21] of a sudden
[1:36:23] there was something in you that was
[1:36:25] crazy craving for
[1:36:27] God there was something in you that tell
[1:36:30] you to do you want to do the right thing
[1:36:33] why because there was a life in you that
[1:36:36] was waiting for another life to
[1:36:39] strike and that is what God is doing for
[1:36:42] us the prophet said he said God give us
[1:36:45] exceedingly great precious
[1:36:48] promises he has promised to fulfill them
[1:36:52] he will
[1:36:53] but from the time we pray until the time
[1:36:57] the answer we must learn to receive
[1:37:00] patience into our
[1:37:03] soul you see that is why all of us we go
[1:37:07] through trial that is why we have trials
[1:37:09] and and we pray for things we say God
[1:37:13] sometimes like God doesn't
[1:37:15] answer no what God the prophet is
[1:37:18] telling us the Reason God is teaching us
[1:37:22] patience to our soul listen let me read
[1:37:25] that he said God give us exceeding great
[1:37:29] precious promises and know God said okay
[1:37:32] by The Strife you are healed that's the
[1:37:34] promise of God but
[1:37:37] sometimes you pray you Seck the more you
[1:37:40] pray the more
[1:37:42] sickness get worse that's one quote the
[1:37:45] prophet said God someone have confidence
[1:37:49] in
[1:37:50] you that when you pray if you remember
[1:37:53] silent he know that you will never give
[1:37:57] up God has so much confidence that you
[1:38:01] will be able to take the word of God he
[1:38:04] said he has promised to fulfill then he
[1:38:06] will but from the time we
[1:38:11] pray from the time we
[1:38:14] pray until the time the answer came we
[1:38:18] come we must Lear patient to our soul
[1:38:23] not down why for only in patience that
[1:38:27] you can possess
[1:38:30] life it is only by patience you go
[1:38:33] through trials of Trials upon trials and
[1:38:36] God what is God is trying to do God is
[1:38:39] trying to transport
[1:38:41] life to your soul therefore from today
[1:38:45] when you are going through
[1:38:48] trial first of all the question you have
[1:38:50] to ask yourself is am I a child of God
[1:38:53] God if that settle every other that
[1:38:57] comes with it God is
[1:39:00] responsible if you are going through Tri
[1:39:02] and you're a child of God let me tell
[1:39:04] you there's something in stock for you
[1:39:08] that you are not aware of that God is
[1:39:10] doing that God is trying to give
[1:39:13] patience to your soul so that you might
[1:39:15] be able to possess
[1:39:19] life
[1:39:21] now in the book of Matthew
[1:39:28] 16 Jesus came
[1:39:30] down with his
[1:39:33] disciples and he start asking the
[1:39:35] disciples who the man think that I
[1:39:39] am everybody will say this that oh some
[1:39:42] said you are Jeremiah some said you are
[1:39:44] that and Jesus Christ said no I'm
[1:39:47] paraphrasing now he said no let bring it
[1:39:51] individual who do you think I am
[1:39:56] am now listen to the he said and the S
[1:39:59] answered and said thou Christ the son of
[1:40:03] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[1:40:05] said unto him blessed are thou Simon by
[1:40:09] by Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:40:12] revealed this unto you but my Father
[1:40:14] which is in heaven and I say unto thee
[1:40:17] thou are Peter Upon This Rock I will
[1:40:20] build my church and the gazes of H will
[1:40:23] not Prevail against it Hallelujah in the
[1:40:25] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:40:27] reveal the prophet told what is the new
[1:40:31] birth yes everybody until I get into
[1:40:34] them message the the Baptist explain
[1:40:37] what the new birth is every denomination
[1:40:41] explaining even at the beginning of the
[1:40:43] the message of Willam Braham a lot of
[1:40:46] people were confused what the new bir is
[1:40:48] but after the opening of the seal the
[1:40:52] prophet bring his so so simple that
[1:40:54] anybody can get get
[1:40:56] it because that is what Peter did when
[1:40:59] Jesus CH asked Peter he said Peter you
[1:41:03] that have followed me because Christ
[1:41:05] know there were some who did not know
[1:41:08] who he he is some of them I see confused
[1:41:11] they were following something then was
[1:41:14] was moving them to follow Jesus but they
[1:41:16] could not they could not get the clear
[1:41:18] revelation of who Christ was but when
[1:41:22] Christ bring
[1:41:23] that question Peter I believe Peter was
[1:41:27] just like somebody else all of a sudden
[1:41:30] something roll down from the mystical
[1:41:33] Chanel he bypassed Peter's mind went
[1:41:37] straight to the soul of Peter Peter all
[1:41:39] of his son Peter come up come to himself
[1:41:42] he said thou Christ the son of the
[1:41:45] Living God and Jesus Christ said
[1:41:49] Peter the prophet put it in a very
[1:41:51] simple way he said said Peter did not
[1:41:54] learn that from the Bible
[1:41:56] School Peter did not get that
[1:41:58] explanation from anybody nobody thought
[1:42:01] Peter something from Heaven roll down
[1:42:04] from the mystical channel into the soul
[1:42:07] of Peter and Peter vocalize it out and I
[1:42:11] can tell you Peter would have stand
[1:42:13] there said I don't know what I
[1:42:16] said and Peter would said what what I
[1:42:19] what did I just said and Before Peter
[1:42:22] could begin to
[1:42:23] think of what he said Jesus Christ said
[1:42:27] Peter Flesh and
[1:42:30] Blood did not explain that to you my
[1:42:34] father which is in heaven is the one who
[1:42:37] transported mystery unveiling of that
[1:42:40] mystery to you something happened inside
[1:42:42] Peter listen to what the prophet said
[1:42:44] Christ is the mystery of God he said
[1:42:46] what is the new
[1:42:48] birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:42:51] Christ personal
[1:42:53] listen it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:42:56] Christ personally to you that is as
[1:42:59] simple as
[1:43:03] thatu a revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:43:08] you
[1:43:12] personally I believe that statement if
[1:43:15] you are a seed of God even if you are 7
[1:43:17] years old you will understand that right
[1:43:20] like
[1:43:21] that he said what is the new bir is the
[1:43:24] revelation of Jesus Christ personal to
[1:43:27] you he said not joiny a
[1:43:31] church not shaking
[1:43:34] hands not doing something different
[1:43:36] outside a Creed or you promise to live
[1:43:39] by the code of conduct you know a lot of
[1:43:42] people think when when you come to the
[1:43:44] church you the prophet said we should
[1:43:46] dress nice women don't cut your head
[1:43:49] there are people who are who have been
[1:43:51] doing that they don't cut their hair
[1:43:53] right they don't they wear long skirt
[1:43:56] they don't expose themselves they are
[1:43:58] decent human being but they will never
[1:44:00] be the Bride of Jesus Christ that's true
[1:44:03] therefore living by code of conduct does
[1:44:06] not take you to anywhere that's right
[1:44:08] coming to be behave like Angel in the
[1:44:12] church cannot help you therefore the
[1:44:15] only thing that will help you is that
[1:44:17] revelation of who Christ is roll down
[1:44:20] from the mystical Channel straight to
[1:44:22] your soul and you vocalize it out wow
[1:44:27] and that is what give you eternal life
[1:44:30] not you dress nice or good no no no no
[1:44:33] check the Bible the people that God has
[1:44:36] used are the most wward human being in
[1:44:39] the
[1:44:40] Bible it's not because of the ability
[1:44:42] why did God all of sudden God take take
[1:44:46] uh David
[1:44:49] David who con and kill another man take
[1:44:53] another man's wife and kill and God turn
[1:44:55] around said David you are man after my
[1:44:58] own heart to me it doesn't add
[1:45:01] up so you it doesn't add up but why did
[1:45:06] God does that why God do things like
[1:45:08] that why did God this woman allowed this
[1:45:11] woman to go to 1 2 3 4 5 six husband and
[1:45:16] this woman live in a torment thinking
[1:45:18] something wrong is wrong with his
[1:45:21] lineage this woman cried day and night
[1:45:26] she probably she think that somebody put
[1:45:28] a cur on her not knowing that God was
[1:45:32] working things out God was working that
[1:45:36] condition to be able to meet the seven
[1:45:40] seal that is what God is doing in our
[1:45:43] life your life might be turned upside
[1:45:45] down you might go to bed in the night
[1:45:48] you can't figure out what what is wrong
[1:45:50] with you you might be you are maybe sit
[1:45:53] down one place and hm do they put a c on
[1:45:57] my
[1:45:58] lineage in my family what is wrong I go
[1:46:01] through that I go through that and all
[1:46:03] of a sudden you start comparing yourself
[1:46:05] with another family but let me tell you
[1:46:08] the good news is this there's something
[1:46:11] God is working out there's something God
[1:46:13] is trying to unveil through your life
[1:46:16] there is something God is doing
[1:46:19] therefore the only way for God to do is
[1:46:21] to bring trial and persecution he said
[1:46:23] listen he said let me just finish this
[1:46:27] quote he said you promise to live by
[1:46:29] code of conduct the prophet said but
[1:46:31] Christ the Bible he is the word that was
[1:46:34] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:46:37] anybody say oh take or what take place
[1:46:41] it is
[1:46:42] Christ not the pastor priest or whatever
[1:46:45] it may be it is Christ in you is is that
[1:46:50] Revelation that the church was bu
[1:46:53] upon my question to you today let it
[1:46:57] just bring it very simple the new birth
[1:47:00] is not how how many quote you can
[1:47:03] quote the new birth is not how many tith
[1:47:07] you pay in the church no it's the
[1:47:10] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:47:13] you because that is what life is
[1:47:16] therefore when you even if you you don't
[1:47:18] know your
[1:47:19] ABC could you imagine
[1:47:23] that Peter according to the pro and the
[1:47:25] Bible said that Peter was ignorant and
[1:47:29] un and come and put another phrase he
[1:47:32] said even if you write Peter's name with
[1:47:34] a big letter Peter could not even able
[1:47:37] to read his name because excuse my
[1:47:41] expression he was a
[1:47:44] dummy
[1:47:46] but in that God choose right to give
[1:47:51] that man the key to the
[1:47:54] kingdom therefore the way we think is
[1:47:57] different from the way God thinks that
[1:48:00] is why the Bible said that God's thought
[1:48:01] is not our thought therefore when God is
[1:48:04] doing something this is God's business
[1:48:07] it's not my business by the grace of God
[1:48:09] me and you we find ourselves in the will
[1:48:12] of God therefore when God are doing
[1:48:15] something God can decide to choose
[1:48:19] anybody that is his prerogative
[1:48:22] can CH take prostitute do anything I
[1:48:26] believe that is the reason why God
[1:48:27] choose me and
[1:48:29] you because if we really look at the
[1:48:31] society we are not the best humanly
[1:48:34] speaking no when we look at Society we
[1:48:38] are not the people most richest people
[1:48:40] in the society no my brothers and sister
[1:48:43] if I tell you my story and tell you
[1:48:45] where I came from you you will see what
[1:48:47] is called Amazing Grace amen hallelujah
[1:48:51] because Amazing Grace is what God give
[1:48:54] you without you any anything God decided
[1:48:57] before the foundation of the world he
[1:48:59] looked down through the stream of time
[1:49:01] he said we will be here in the darkest
[1:49:04] of the darkest when everywhere there is
[1:49:07] no truth and God said I'm going to
[1:49:10] choose the
[1:49:13] best said Brother Joseph are you saying
[1:49:15] I'm the best
[1:49:18] yes God will have put you in the time of
[1:49:21] Noah God will put you in the time of
[1:49:24] David God would have chose you in the
[1:49:26] time of will
[1:49:27] Abraham but God Reser The Best For Last
[1:49:32] you are the best God is depending on you
[1:49:36] God know that you are the one to close
[1:49:38] up this this what this operation that
[1:49:42] started billions billion years ago now
[1:49:45] we are in the final stage it's just like
[1:49:48] when we play soccer I love soccer when
[1:49:51] you are playing League you don't just
[1:49:53] choose people who don't know how to
[1:49:55] play you look for the best
[1:49:58] Striker that is why Messi and other
[1:50:00] people who play in Europe they put them
[1:50:02] in the center forward you know why
[1:50:05] because those guys are good in what they
[1:50:07] do then when they take the ball they
[1:50:09] don't play with it their aim is to
[1:50:13] score that is why God choose me and you
[1:50:18] the brother the prophet said in the
[1:50:19] message God of this evil age why did God
[1:50:22] have to choose bride in the midst of
[1:50:25] this darkness in this evil age why did
[1:50:28] God choose me why did God choose you I
[1:50:31] have answer for
[1:50:32] you the reason is that
[1:50:36] God choose you because you are the
[1:50:40] best Martin Luther could not face what
[1:50:44] you are facing today John Wesley could
[1:50:48] not face what we are facing today
[1:50:50] therefore God selected the Bride of the
[1:50:53] end time and equip them it's not your
[1:50:57] let me tell you let me just blend this
[1:50:59] straightforward it is not you the flesh
[1:51:02] your flesh is not the Bride of Jesus
[1:51:04] Christ this flesh there you go God
[1:51:08] doesn't trust it even myself I don't
[1:51:09] trust myself therefore what God is
[1:51:13] talking about is talking of the the seed
[1:51:15] of God that what God put there that he
[1:51:18] will able to defeat the Devil in his own
[1:51:21] ground and that why you are the best and
[1:51:25] that is why I'm the best I only tell
[1:51:28] people I said our sister in the church
[1:51:30] they can't preach if they have allowed
[1:51:33] them to preach our sister can defeat the
[1:51:37] PHD that went to Bible school and
[1:51:39] studied for 10
[1:51:41] years why because we are not feeding on
[1:51:44] just ordinary
[1:51:46] Bible we are feeding on the Mysteries
[1:51:50] the hidden Mystery that was reserved for
[1:51:52] the and time and the only people that
[1:51:55] can able to understand the mystery has
[1:51:57] to be people who are have Pro prophetic
[1:52:02] Insight those who have ability to hear
[1:52:05] from God do you know that everybody can
[1:52:07] hear from
[1:52:09] God right do you know there are people
[1:52:12] that are living like hum like today they
[1:52:15] are like human being but they when they
[1:52:17] die they die like
[1:52:19] dog when they die they die like animal
[1:52:22] but there are honor specific people on
[1:52:24] the
[1:52:25] Earth that when they die there is life
[1:52:28] in them on the resurrection money those
[1:52:31] people hallu will be restorated amen and
[1:52:35] that is a part of who we are we are the
[1:52:38] special one God by his grace that's why
[1:52:40] my brothers and
[1:52:42] sister when I look myself every day I
[1:52:44] may not have money to pay my mortgage
[1:52:47] sometimes but every time I look at
[1:52:50] myself said I am wonderful ful made amen
[1:52:54] yes sir I'm the most handsome human
[1:52:56] being on Earth go God ever
[1:52:58] created God take
[1:53:01] time I said I want to special make
[1:53:04] Brother Joseph because Brother Joseph
[1:53:06] have something to do at the end time God

[1:53:51] whole village were waiting for us and
[1:53:55] car couldn't go

[1:54:18] is I'm happy because God sent yeah I'm
[1:54:23] happy to see that I am carrying life and
[1:54:27] when we preach brother it is not like
[1:54:29] people here when you go to places where
[1:54:31] they don't have money you see the power
[1:54:34] of the Gospel when you go there brother
[1:54:37] here I only tell people the reason why
[1:54:40] there's not so much Revival you know I
[1:54:42] went there I see the way people live I
[1:54:46] was moved I took my phone I called my my
[1:54:49] children I said listen I think we
[1:54:52] becoming too SPO in Canada how can some
[1:54:55] a woman go and do a hair of two
[1:54:59] $250 where somebody and that $250 maybe
[1:55:03] in 3 weeks go and change it again and
[1:55:05] where somebody cannot get one me to
[1:55:09] eat and I was my my daughter told me
[1:55:12] said dad let me tell you something God
[1:55:15] put them there and God put us here and
[1:55:18] when he said I said that's true God know
[1:55:21] why he put them there but but when you
[1:55:22] see people they are rejoicing when they
[1:55:24] receive message I went to a place and we
[1:55:28] finished preaching this lady was
[1:55:30] supposed to go 3 hours by
[1:55:32] leg and we finished at 9:00 and it was
[1:55:36] almost getting that 9:00 where there's
[1:55:38] no light is pretty
[1:55:40] dark and the brother the pastor from
[1:55:43] macius is my mission partner he told me
[1:55:47] Brother Joseph you see those two ladies
[1:55:49] they are going 3 hours from here
[1:55:53] when it got home they may not have
[1:55:55] something to eat and that day we were
[1:55:58] CRA craving for egg we went to buy Six
[1:56:01] CR six eggs just to
[1:56:05] eat then I hold him the brother told me
[1:56:08] said Brother Joseph let us give this
[1:56:11] this
[1:56:12] egg six egg they are traveling 3 hours
[1:56:17] with leg in the in
[1:56:20] darkness just a travel 3 hours to come
[1:56:23] and listen to the message and when I
[1:56:26] said that I said
[1:56:28] Lord I'm happy because I'm a part of it
[1:56:33] we travel from the city 9 hours into the
[1:56:36] jungle it's not with with a t Road no we
[1:56:39] were dancing like this every time for 9
[1:56:42] hours until we get there and when we got
[1:56:45] there you see the
[1:56:48] Revival in the heart of people in the
[1:56:51] heart of Those Who Have Nothing is it
[1:56:54] the reason why we don't see the
[1:56:55] supernatural Among Us is this when we
[1:56:59] feel the first thing we think about is
[1:57:03] ohip and because of that the devil give
[1:57:05] us alterity but back there they don't
[1:57:08] have alternative therefore they have to
[1:57:11] pray and pray God's down and you see the
[1:57:14] supernatural I remember there's a
[1:57:16] brother I was preaching in in church in
[1:57:19] uh South Africa as he was preaching that
[1:57:22] was a sister by inspiration tell the
[1:57:24] sister go to the bank
[1:57:27] machine you don't have M go to the bank
[1:57:29] machine whatever you put there is going
[1:57:32] to happen the brother the wife get up to
[1:57:36] back his up said tell me wife to go with
[1:57:38] her go with her and that sister has no
[1:57:41] money in his account and when he got
[1:57:44] there by the inspiration what the
[1:57:45] brother spoke he got to the and press
[1:57:48] his pin brother the money was coming out
[1:57:54] that is the God we
[1:57:56] serve because we hear the devil give us
[1:58:00] alternative we we are so
[1:58:04] relaxed but God know how
[1:58:07] to pull us into a place because God has
[1:58:11] a part of himself in US therefore God
[1:58:14] sometime God Force the
[1:58:16] issues on your family father issu said
[1:58:19] since you are you are just sitting not
[1:58:22] doing nothing you know in the North
[1:58:24] America know we don't pray we don't pray
[1:58:27] because Prayer Changes
[1:58:30] Things somebody told me said brother why
[1:58:32] should I pray when I have money in the
[1:58:35] bank why should I pray when I'm okay and
[1:58:38] through when you are living fine Brother
[1:58:41] you don't think about
[1:58:43] God that is why we are living the the
[1:58:46] North America I'm sorry to say this I'm
[1:58:50] what I'm I'm not trying to I live here
[1:58:52] for almost going to 30 years and I thank
[1:58:55] God I will if you choose for me to live
[1:58:57] in Africa here I will choose Canada
[1:59:00] that's but what I'm am I driving
[1:59:04] to that when when you have a a
[1:59:09] situation God put something in you to be
[1:59:12] able to overcome that condition
[1:59:15] therefore when you have everything
[1:59:17] simple you you go to to hospital simple
[1:59:22] if you don't have a job you go to
[1:59:24] welfare everything the system here
[1:59:28] designed every everybody to live
[1:59:31] comfortably I like to live comfortably I
[1:59:34] thank God for
[1:59:35] Canada but when you go to other
[1:59:38] places where they don't have what we
[1:59:40] have you see the supernatural am in
[1:59:45] operation why because what is in you you
[1:59:50] might underestimate what God put in in
[1:59:52] you I remember when I was sick I think I
[1:59:56] give this testimony before here I was
[1:59:59] sick I went to work and all of a
[2:00:04] sudden I had to be rushed to the

[2:01:14] sudden the quote the prophet say see
[2:01:16] yourself you are healed and and jump
[2:01:19] into it amen all of a sudden immediately
[2:01:22] I saw that I said in Jesus name I move

[2:02:09] ask you a question every time I come
[2:02:12] here when you say something when I say
[2:02:15] something to you you always use
[2:02:17] scriptures because these nurses when
[2:02:20] they come to your house they want to

[2:02:54] accept that you know what I just said my
[2:02:55] dead warrant I said no no no no I said
[2:02:59] that is why I was doing that brother
[2:03:01] after that
[2:03:02] treadmill I was walking brother I can
[2:03:06] play soccer now nothing happened why
[2:03:09] because our
[2:03:11] God is is still
[2:03:13] his our God is powerful God is depending
[2:03:17] on all of us brother when I go to the
[2:03:19] mission Fe I have testimony to give
[2:03:23] everywhere I give testimony brother you
[2:03:26] see people because people know God is
[2:03:28] still alive and you see people getting
[2:03:32] healed I was preaching in Venezuela
[2:03:34] there was a family behind it wasn't he
[2:03:38] just heard me on the last speaker and
[2:03:40] this woman was on stage four
[2:03:43] cancer immediately I start preaching and
[2:03:46] all of a sudden because I were preaching
[2:03:49] English were they were preaching Spanish
[2:03:51] and that woman because of the word I
[2:03:53] it's not me has nothing to do it's the
[2:03:55] power of the word of God and the word of
[2:03:58] God went straight to that woman not even
[2:04:01] in the crusade in the next house and
[2:04:04] that woman he went to the doctor and
[2:04:05] that woman was completely and totally
[2:04:07] healed with no
[2:04:09] cancer why because God is still in
[2:04:14] business of healing God Trust on the
[2:04:17] bride we are here that is why I will
[2:04:20] telling my wife
[2:04:22] uh by the grace of God next
[2:04:24] year I'm going to be on full time going
[2:04:28] to Jungle of Africa wherever God sent me
[2:04:31] why because there are people who want to
[2:04:33] hear the truth we have the
[2:04:35] truth the Bible said the L the the
[2:04:38] harvest is plenty and the labor few God
[2:04:43] is is depending on me and you to go out
[2:04:46] there and tell them how powerful this
[2:04:49] message is that is the experience what
[2:04:53] devil can tell me now that God doesn't
[2:04:56] heal not once not twice not three times
[2:05:01] brother God healed God delivered God
[2:05:06] provide
[2:05:08] amen you
[2:05:11] know God want us to have an
[2:05:13] experience because when you have
[2:05:15] experience you can defy the
[2:05:18] devil when you have experience you can
[2:05:20] tell the devil listen to me when you
[2:05:22] were being created I was the one who
[2:05:24] gave you an existence and the devil
[2:05:26] knows that but the devil trying to say
[2:05:29] oh you do this you do that you do that
[2:05:30] no the prophet said when the sister came
[2:05:33] to brother BR he said he was complaining
[2:05:35] if I if I have the Holy Ghost or not you
[2:05:38] said that is what the devil the devil
[2:05:41] will come to you and bring all kind of
[2:05:42] things to
[2:05:44] you you
[2:05:46] see the Holy Ghost is not just jumping
[2:05:48] up and down the Holy Ghost is the life
[2:05:51] of Christ in you brother ask the sister
[2:05:55] what is your
[2:05:57] desire said my desire is to serve God is
[2:06:00] to do good you think the devil will give
[2:06:02] you a desire to do good no the devil
[2:06:05] will not do that therefore when you you
[2:06:07] have the desire to serve God but you are
[2:06:09] still struggling with in with your with
[2:06:12] your flesh you still struggling with the
[2:06:14] the nature that was given to you by your
[2:06:17] parents brother the prophet said that is
[2:06:20] what the blood of Jesus Christ was sh
[2:06:21] there for yeah but inside of you you
[2:06:24] want to do good that is the Holy Ghost
[2:06:26] it's God who put that desire inside of
[2:06:28] you but don't worry about what you are
[2:06:30] struggling with because this flesh will
[2:06:34] never be redeemed this you will struggle
[2:06:39] with it until you die therefore if you
[2:06:43] have something inside of you yes who
[2:06:45] always tell you this message is true yes
[2:06:48] who never have a conflict with the
[2:06:50] message that you believe
[2:06:52] that is God no matter what your struggle
[2:06:55] is
[2:06:58] listen in the message question and
[2:07:00] answer now the prophet said the body is
[2:07:02] what we look at this one we look at this
[2:07:06] body every body have different nature
[2:07:09] you come from a different background and
[2:07:11] the background that you come from form
[2:07:13] your body form the way you live
[2:07:16] therefore you grow up like that and you
[2:07:19] struggle you strugg but in the midst of
[2:07:22] that temperament that you have God put
[2:07:26] his own seed in there because this is
[2:07:29] not everybody that you see on the street
[2:07:31] that the seed of God there are two seed
[2:07:33] lying here on Earth listen the and the
[2:07:37] he said the body is what we look at the
[2:07:39] spirit is what controls you your soul is
[2:07:43] the nature of the spirit the soul that
[2:07:46] sinth shall die in other words the soul
[2:07:50] that disbel the word of God will be
[2:07:53] separated amen when this message of the
[2:07:56] hour in every age God allocated a
[2:08:00] certain amount word the word of God is
[2:08:04] God himself and he bring in this our age
[2:08:08] there's the word of God that was
[2:08:10] allocated and you having the ability to
[2:08:13] receive
[2:08:15] that you it means that you are a part of
[2:08:19] God there are some who don't have the
[2:08:22] ability it's not in them no matter how
[2:08:25] how what you
[2:08:27] preach no matter the mirac they see
[2:08:29] Miracle signs and wonder they can't
[2:08:31] believe why the prophet said they don't
[2:08:35] have anything in them to believe with
[2:08:38] right therefore when you put this two
[2:08:41] category side by side and you know where
[2:08:44] you fall into my brother that should
[2:08:47] give us
[2:08:48] joy that should make us thank God every
[2:08:51] day
[2:08:52] that I be on the other side not able to
[2:08:56] believe no matter what you do but you
[2:08:59] now today somebody just present a
[2:09:02] message to you and automatically you
[2:09:06] believe and as you begin to eat receive
[2:09:09] the word of God you are
[2:09:11] growing the the the mystery of God that

[2:11:54] and God is living Brother Joseph my
[2:11:57] brother the Bible says righteous man for
[2:12:00] seven times and he will rise up and that
[2:12:04] is why we are the aror of this
[2:12:06] movie we are the actor we will never die

[2:12:11] redemption my brother
[2:12:13] God specially select you my brother he

[2:12:25] in the mirror he said I'm wonderfully
[2:12:28] made that's why everywhere I go my
[2:12:30] brothers and sister I only declare there
[2:12:33] is no some no brother as a handsome
[2:12:36] brother Joseph no brother is more
[2:12:39] intelligent as Brother Joseph why
[2:12:41] because I was wonderfully made that is
[2:12:44] what God made me and that what God Made
[2:12:47] You therefore we are not just passing by
[2:12:49] here we are here to shake the kingdom of
[2:12:52] darkness oh said Brother Joseph I don't
[2:12:54] have power to he no no no we don't have
[2:12:56] power but we have authority we are not
[2:13:00] given power no but we have the authority
[2:13:02] of Jesus Christ behind us that if only
[2:13:05] you can just use that Authority in any
[2:13:08] situation you know the devil think he
[2:13:11] can frustrate the bride no no it's too
[2:13:14] late he said the prophet said the devil
[2:13:16] will do everything against this bride
[2:13:19] until himself say is frustrated
[2:13:22] that is why we are the actor of the of
[2:13:26] this movie why are we actors because the
[2:13:29] Life of Christ is in us we carry life no
[2:13:34] I I read one quote and I will close this
[2:13:37] quote is one of the most my most
[2:13:39] favorite
[2:13:40] quote you
[2:13:42] see in the
[2:13:45] message listen to this
[2:13:51] oh Hallelujah just give me just give me
[2:13:54] a
[2:14:04] minute the prophets in the
[2:14:07] message that day on Calvary the prophet
[2:14:11] said the first thing I want to say Jesus
[2:14:14] never leave for
[2:14:17] himself his life was spent for others
[2:14:21] that quote what is what prepared me to
[2:14:24] go to the mission
[2:14:26] field that quote is what prepared me to
[2:14:29] go to the jungles out there just to be
[2:14:33] able to tell people the message of the
[2:14:36] hour the message that have
[2:14:38] life the message that can take
[2:14:40] prostitute out from that condition and
[2:14:43] make him a messy that can take a drug ad
[2:14:46] that make him a preacher a message that
[2:14:49] can take innocent a unworthy servant and
[2:14:54] look at William Brown's
[2:14:56] life look at your life you might say oh
[2:15:00] right not let me tell you I'm here to BU
[2:15:03] trumpet to tell you that you're
[2:15:04] specially made listen said he said Jesus
[2:15:08] never Liv for himself his life was spent
[2:15:10] for other that is part internal life
[2:15:13] when you say you go to church and you do
[2:15:15] good that is fine but when you live your
[2:15:18] life for yourself you have eternal life
[2:15:22] but eternal life is living for
[2:15:25] others let us try to live for others not
[2:15:29] so much in giving in so much protic
[2:15:33] Christ this message to your fellow human
[2:15:36] being and when you do that because where
[2:15:39] is life today there's life is not on the
[2:15:42] street this is where the life is and God
[2:15:46] is depending on me and you whether where
[2:15:48] you at work whe whether you at work
[2:15:51] going on just let your light shine if
[2:15:54] you if you can't preach it's okay if you
[2:15:56] have a book just stretch your hand and
[2:16:00] that book may be something that will
[2:16:03] change your internal destination that
[2:16:06] book might be what will heal them from
[2:16:09] cancer that book might be something that
[2:16:13] will trans just transfer their life in
[2:16:15] such a way that when they were heading
[2:16:18] to they make a urn
[2:16:21] like we don't know where the SE are God
[2:16:23] is depending on on because we see things
[2:16:26] are Runing up very quickly but it is
[2:16:30] time for us we that carry life to
[2:16:34] Project Life to somebody to project the
[2:16:38] prophet said when you project
[2:16:42] love and when that love stop Sovereign
[2:16:46] Grace will take over therefore when you
[2:16:49] go to you see some
[2:16:51] how do you project Lord if you know this
[2:16:54] message transform your life why can't
[2:16:55] you find a way to live for your brother
[2:16:58] live for your sister live for your
[2:17:00] friend you don't need to explain nothing
[2:17:03] no this message is capable explaining
[2:17:05] itself if you present it in a good way
[2:17:09] if you just use the the the the wisdom
[2:17:12] of God to say brother try this if you
[2:17:16] said no take it
[2:17:19] back you see
[2:17:21] I give you a testimony where I was
[2:17:23] working my my
[2:17:26] brother they know the scripture there
[2:17:28] are these people you know the the the
[2:17:30] most difficult people to deal with are
[2:17:32] people who are religious who knows the
[2:17:34] Bible back and forth you can't change
[2:17:37] them that is the hard note to break and
[2:17:40] this guy knows the Bible back and forth
[2:17:44] and I studied the brother and we're
[2:17:47] working together it's my it's my boss
[2:17:49] and I said okay some tell me probably I
[2:17:53] I went too fast I just give him seven
[2:17:55] Church ages you know those intelligent
[2:17:58] people what they do now if you give them
[2:18:01] book they they go and do
[2:18:04] research as he go and do the research
[2:18:06] the first that came is all those people
[2:18:09] who tell about William
[2:18:11] Brown the next day the guy just came he
[2:18:15] just give me the
[2:18:16] book I didn't ask no question something
[2:18:19] tell me just be quiet
[2:18:21] is said okay I said thank you brother I
[2:18:23] took the book a day two weeks I didn't
[2:18:26] ever talk about the message about the
[2:18:28] book never sometime for me I have a way
[2:18:32] when they are talking I will inest
[2:18:34] something I pull it back again and they
[2:18:37] were he were talking with my supervisor
[2:18:39] and I threw something there and he
[2:18:41] turned back said do you really believe
[2:18:43] that I said
[2:18:45] well I believe
[2:18:47] that I said okay now
[2:18:51] he was having a he was having a problem
[2:18:54] with one of the employer and the
[2:18:57] employer I think went to report him for
[2:18:59] harassment and he came to me because he
[2:19:02] saw me because I don't talk about when
[2:19:05] they talking I I slep something in there
[2:19:08] he said Mr Joseph please I want your
[2:19:11] advice on this how is he going to deal
[2:19:13] with this this lady I said okay I said
[2:19:17] brother the only thing I will tell you
[2:19:19] is that
[2:19:21] probably you are hard with this this
[2:19:24] sister and anything he tell them that
[2:19:27] you do they're going to believe her you
[2:19:30] have to be very
[2:19:31] careful because the guy act like a
[2:19:34] general like an army even myself when he
[2:19:36] come to office I get scared I said maybe
[2:19:39] you have to at least relax a little bit
[2:19:42] therefore people can relate with you he
[2:19:45] said that's it I said not only that but
[2:19:48] are you a Christian he said oh I used to
[2:19:50] be a Christian I said I know because you
[2:19:51] you know your Bible very well I said
[2:19:55] but the best thing to do is to pro
[2:19:57] project love to this sister when you
[2:20:01] project love they know that you love
[2:20:04] them but if you are coming to the office
[2:20:06] I see you know
[2:20:08] everything any mistake you'll be in
[2:20:11] trouble because they will believe her I
[2:20:14] said project love this brother
[2:20:17] listen he said Mr Joseph you are a man
[2:20:20] of wisdom I said no I'm not a man of wi
[2:20:22] I'm just telling what the Bible said now
[2:20:25] that opened a door for
[2:20:27] me to talk to him about about God I
[2:20:32] never present William
[2:20:34] Braham since that
[2:20:37] day I never talk about book I don't talk
[2:20:40] about will BR until I able to contact
[2:20:43] your spirit know whether you there's
[2:20:47] something there otherwise I will not
[2:20:50] because the denomination have been
[2:20:52] taught that the last prophet is Jesus
[2:20:54] Christ therefore when you present Jesus
[2:20:56] Christ at the Forefront you just you
[2:20:58] show them off then I tell we start
[2:21:01] talking all of a sudden he said Mr
[2:21:03] Joseph h i i this is
[2:21:07] interesting one day brother Glenn one of
[2:21:11] the Min in our church was preaching I
[2:21:13] just told him please can I just I want
[2:21:16] to listen it was evening service said go
[2:21:19] ahead then I put my something on my ears
[2:21:21] he said Mr you said no no no no I want
[2:21:23] to hear him
[2:21:25] too I said wow I said
[2:21:28] good and I open up both of us were watch
[2:21:32] watching and brother Glenn is from
[2:21:35] Trad and this brother is from trinda
[2:21:38] immediately he he asking he said oh is
[2:21:40] that brother from tra I said yes he said
[2:21:44] oh wow this brother he was more
[2:21:48] attentive than me than myself
[2:21:51] he was listening to the to what brother
[2:21:54] brother Glenn was preaching after he
[2:21:56] finished he said Brother Joseph I have
[2:22:00] every time since that time asking me
[2:22:03] questions and up to where we are
[2:22:06] everybody in there he will come me what
[2:22:10] do you think about this what do you
[2:22:11] think about that what do you think about
[2:22:13] that because he has a spiritual Pride
[2:22:16] that is what the from the Pentecostal
[2:22:18] even if for me I believe because the way
[2:22:22] you present the message they may not
[2:22:24] receive it that time give them time to
[2:22:27] process it and when you see that coming
[2:22:29] with different question something is
[2:22:31] dealing with your soul and that is what
[2:22:34] I'm praying for that guy he knows the
[2:22:36] scripture before you quote anything he
[2:22:38] knows everything and people like that it
[2:22:40] is very difficult to deal with but if
[2:22:43] you have life in your office you Project
[2:22:47] Life if life is there life will respond
[2:22:51] Amen Let Us
[2:22:54] stand
