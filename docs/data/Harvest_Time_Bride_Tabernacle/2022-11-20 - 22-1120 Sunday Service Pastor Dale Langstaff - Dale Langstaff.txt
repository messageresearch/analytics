we just uh just uh uh subtle wind this morning man it's just a amen God bless you boy and Esther and Jared thank you amen just uh just I want to thank God for just an awesome family of God and just an awesome weekend and even being here this morning seeing each one of you is just it's just awesome Amen you know I just wanted to share something for a moment you know uh and it's it's going to go along with our message by God's grace um uh you know as Believers we really need to uh uh you know understand each other and understand the devil also amen so like if somebody's driving or they don't show up or they come in late it's winter time amen see we're not under Old Testament law you know or you know you know when brother Britton was preaching Sunday uh you know and he was finished and he said about the how strong the presence God was and when I stepped into that I couldn't help myself from crying no I'm asking I don't want to cry here you can't hold yourself together you can't function but that's not something I choose to do I beg God to take it from me you see what I mean and yet the devil would tell somebody else well you know you know what I mean things say and that's the devil trying to separate us amen and you know when we when we by God's grace when we look into his word this morning you know God plans us to be so neatly together we're not talking about Sin we're just talking about you know we breathe differently or something you know what I mean and just don't go in you know if you don't understand somebody just say it's between them and God you know what I mean like it's you know we all had different you know households and we all had the same exact same word of God and the exact same message amen but you know different things you know I was uh I share this with you just sort of this is to this is to punch the devil in the nose you know we we had a beautiful weekend last weekend and when we get home me and my wife uh share everything amen we Have No Secrets amen and I got home after the weekend and you know well let me let me tell you a different way uh I told my wife something that happened and and uh but you know sometimes a reaction or something that happens can be read differently by the by different people you know let me let me and I'm not just uh I believe this is is God's grace to us Amen Let me let me give you just a little example you know I was I was bidding on a a Farm property very close to us and it was selling by auction and the auctioneer it went up to you know the price that it was worth and he said now we're going to take it is stopped and I was the highest bidder and he said no we're going to take a time out and you know you can talk with your wife or you know go talk to your dad or you know it was just take a breather and walk around and you can you know consider this huge decision like you know like youth would buy a house or something it's a big decision and then he said we're going to come back together and we're going to put it back up for auction and he was going to talk to the landowner and he was she's not bothering us the dog brother that's what I'm talking about if you have tiny tiny kids you don't have to run out with them I mean you know if you need to but if your kids you should travel to the other countries where the dog runs through in front of the pulpit and the chickens are over here and the neighbors walking cows by over there and they're screeching and the you know I mean if you were distracted by all that you don't well don't go overseas on an open amen because you just couldn't even focus you know Amanda so so they they uh you know of course the auctioneer you went and talked to the homeowner and said you know the property owner said are you happy with the price and he was he said I'm willing to sell it you know if you get more fine I'm only sells this and they put it back up for sale and it went another almost hundred thousand but 80 some thousand and I did not buy it and but I'm telling you the story for purpose and the guy that was bidding on it his son was a lawyer and he walked around all the people to try to figure out who was bidding against his dad now he's a lawyer now somebody else had to be doing something to make that go up a hundred thousand and that person was me but he didn't know how I was doing it he didn't know who I was because at the moment that the auctioneer connected with me I would wink at him one eye wink now see if that was somebody looking at that they could say well you're flirting with me or you know you're you're you're doing differently you know an eye link can mean flirting an eyewing can mean a stranger's coming in the house honey let's change the conversation and I wink can mean uh I'm gonna play a trick on The Kids Honey watch this you know what I mean and so I told sister Lil Wayne I said you know I'm at home and I was talking to one of the sisters at church and I get up and I winked at her and I thought oh boys Amen to see now I'm very very happily married very happily married and you see but you see Satan is still alive I don't even know why I did it thank you for talking to me it wasn't do you see what I mean but Satan could tell the sister hey you know that pastor's got a lustful Spirit on it oh bless God you see that's that's how the devil divides God's people and conquerors amen amen no I'm not talking about Sin there is lustful spirits on ministers you know but you you know what I'm saying amen amen amen God well got that off my chest I lost a couple nights sleep over that one hey man let's stand Let's Dance amen let's turn to and in our scriptures uh scriptures amen God bless you all we just amazing just uh I'd still covet your prayers for our uh trip to Uganda hey man just uh brother Ben encouraged me hugely on that and just uh praise God for all his servants in the fivefold ministry and amen I'm just looking for amen let's turn to first Thessalonians first Thessalonians 5 17. a man would just read a couple scriptures and then we'll ask brother Matt to uh bless God's word amen amen we want to pray or we want to speak today on my life is preserved through prayer amen thank you Jesus we just pray that amen pray without ceasing now that's got to be one of the shortest verses but you know this past weekend when brother Emmanuel tombi was ministering he just mentioned just a DOT of that and God just said woe to me and I'm going to show you some of the woes that God showed me amen pray without ceasing well so as we look into the scriptures I'm going to show you somebody that was predestinated a prophet was blessed ahead of his prayer but through prayer he said those very words through prayer he got the Holy Ghost and said my life is preserved by prayer now you already know the world we live in is not prayerful World Luke 19 46. thank you Lord Jesus here's Jesus talking uh to uh the ones around him he said saying unto them it is written my house is the House of Prayer but ye have made it the den of Thieves brother Matt will you just bless the word and just uh our meeting here thank you Jesus amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning hey man so we see there's many things said about prayer in the scriptures and we're going to look into some of them in the Old Testament and you know what brother Emmanuel had talked about was prayer you know Jesus when he before he went to the Cross he took his closest disciples with them his most Inner Circle and he come back to them and he said could you not pray or tarry with me one hour one hour one hour prayer you know and we have religious concepts of prayer and we think we need to yeah you know be always uh talking when we pray but prayer and meditation would be close Brothers amen and and we see that you don't have to talk when you pray okay prayer is like a relationship with your your wife or a brother or sister or whatever it's a two-way conversation if one person does all the talking I I would almost I would almost I'd be gonna go out in the limb here a bit but in a lot of cases that French Shepherd relationship will end because every relationship is a back and forth now don't I don't matter if it's your brother and sister or your friend or if you have a friend and you do all the talking and all the calling and all the driving and that friendship will end I have many I could experience amen it's just it's just the way we are but so also is prayer amen and you know Jesus said in the Bible he said don't be like the Sadducees and Pharisees and you know I I studied this you know in different things you know I just say God help me I'm not worried about you just I mean I am but you know what I mean God help me I'm not throwing this on you but you know we have this religious concept and sometimes somebody you know brother Ben talked about you know the reverence and the Bishops and the doctors and in the ministry and and that's fine if they are you know I don't want no part of that amen and and but we just have to be careful you know our Prophet said in church order and Doctrine amen Fred's coming in brother Tim that's good amen God bless you this morning brother Fred amen you know Jesus in the word of God said himself he said don't be like the religious people decide to see some Pharisees he said you don't have to come and you know and even Dwight Moody said the the prophet he said you know the news people are trying to figure out why do they come and hear you I I know this morning that you're not coming to hear Brother Dale that failed grade one amen it has nothing to do with brother Dale and if you if if it did you're going to be deadly disappointed because I got zero education amen but it's Christ amen and here Jesus said he said don't be like the Sadducees and Pharisees where they they stand on the street corner and they want people to hear their fancy words amen now listen I'm going to bring it really closer the message has a vocabulary you can speak to Vanessa's message and it's not wrong and we love the message and it's the only truth Matt but you can speak mad mad message vocabulary that Christians won't even understand you and brother Ben mentioned that on the weekend and I talked to brother my my brother in the flesh was here on Friday night and brother Emmanuel preached a beautiful message but see you can be so much in the message people speak in Chinese you know the seals and the cloud and the the Mysteries and you know Guan and you mad like God uses servants and God used brother Brown was the major prophet to this age and his message is the truth and you have to believe his message it's not actually his message it's this reveal so like it's just this revealed so you have to believe this revealed maybe that's clear I have to believe this revealed but but if you go witness brother Bradley people are going to like huh you say well no they should know him listen my wife was born in Burn Indiana she went to Jay County High School in Indiana see I met her at a Holiness whooping yard Campground 1500 people there whatever they used to open up the walls of the church and block your two by four or post under it because it would get so hot it was huge amen and my wife will look you straight in the eye with a straight face she went to to she went to a a bible school and you uh by Indianapolis and then went to nursing school in Fort Wayne and after we were married we never one time had she ever heard the prophet the message of a church the name anything it was Chinese she was she was going right around where he lived and that's the gospel truth God brought her out of Indiana and brought her to Canada and then showed us the truth so see you see where I'm going with that so we have to be you know the prophet preached about like the kids should be able to understand we're not supposed to be baked you know I mean there's time for that there's a season for everything but you see what I mean so so here's Jesus saying don't pray like decide to see some Pharisees where they pray and it's all a big long you know these big words that you have to go to the day what's that mean honey my wife my dick so what's that word mean honey oh that oh thanks meh our Prophet said in church order Doctrine watch this you saw and by the way when I was handing out flowers I'm glad we have song leaders that sing songs we don't know amen thank you Jesus amen I don't want to hear the same song every day even my favorite song amen see we're not looking for Perfection and I mean I like good singing I don't mean that but I meant I like the Holy Ghost best I just like the Holy Ghost best and see he's a full variety and so here you see these things uh uh where where we we got this idea in our head hear the prophet said a church order and doctor he said the song leader you know he'll come up sing a song of songs and he asked somebody to come up and pray oh buddy I've been in some meetings where they need to read what the prophet says in church order and doctors do you know the prophet said a church ordered a Doctrine to preach 30 to 45 minutes no more he said bring out your point drive it home clench it shut her down now I did he do that of course not but he was laying down a foundation for the ages he was laying down a foundation for brother Dale that he's been gone 70 years and brother Dale's still dating he's still digging I'm digging up that foundation not because I want to hurt it no I want to I want to understand it wow now there's nothing wrong with good preaching I could have listened to the minutes the G3 and I can listen to him for days Brother Band he's just saying I could listen like I mean they're just Spellbound but see it's about God Amen and see here here the prophet says the church order not he said don't invite somebody up and pray for the governor now the Bible itself says pray for our leaders but what the prophet is saying is do that in secret he said don't hear and pray for a half an hour oh I love our prophet man he I can understand that kind of language amen and yet the Bible says to pray without ceasing but in private see it's a perfect understanding amen you can't pray too much our Prophet said you can't pray too much but don't get into the show amen it's fine to be nice and correct and proper and decent and that but but don't be see show is fake see it's it's a see show is a it's a it's a screen set and behind it it's Hollow amen we want some substance some real we want a body we want something with amen we don't want just a covering religion amen God help us so but wow when brother Emmanuel tombi said Friday that Jesus come back to disciples and he said you couldn't even tarry with me an hour oh wow wow I don't want to tell you what brother Dale thought brother Dale thought wow when's the last time I did anything for one hour you know I failed grade one because my attention span was about that short I was a I was a seeing moving person you know what I mean I wanted like I wanted like fireworks you know this sitting still stuff and it hit me right there right there or something and I was like wow I want to show you something and it it you know so I'm going to show you something in the Bible that was saved but but he liked it elected and a prophet it was just he was elected a prophet and he had the blessing of a prophet but he was unconverted oh like Jacob I'm going to show you in the Bible he was prophets are prophets are born his dad give him the blessing his name was Sister planter he was predestinated but he wasn't converted oh amen now let's just set this aside for a second you know the scriptures just forgive me for uh being man there's a lot of stuff in prayer here let's go to Luke Luke 6 12 and uh actually maybe I'll pull up my iPad because I got some of these buried in here but uh I just want to lay a foundation then we're going to we're going to close looking at uh Jacob but uh um forgive me if I'm bumpy this morning I'm trying to uh work off my iPad and not print off a book every morning amen Luke 6 12. and he came to pass in those days that he went into the mountain to pray it's just it's talking about Jesus and he continued there all night wow you say oh well bless God you know he was the son of God and you know what do you expect no no no no no no no he yes he was the son of God but he was still in flesh and so the Bible brings us around to us you know the prophet said oh I couldn't even tell you I think about 30 30 times you know he talks about the all-night prayer meetings that don't mean you're doing the talking see back to this relationship you know God wants to do something like the disciples said to Jesus teach us how to pray and I you know and so we've started something different on Wednesday night you know I went in my Concords of a Bible actually it's not even my Bible and there's about oh there's a lot there's probably 300 scriptures that give prayers in the Bible so when you come on Wednesday night we're reading and looking at a prayer and then we close the service in prayer but uh you know but you you look at this and you see here that uh prayer was a major Savior and event relationship amen oh sorry back to I lost my so here you see in the Lord's Prayer it ain't just Jesus us like Jesus pay my Hydra bill I want to buy a new tractor I've seen the new car you know my house is falling down and I don't like my job and I don't like my pastor here but look at look at the look at the Lord's prayer Our Father Who Art in Heaven hell would be thy name worship worship prayer worship yup yup Hallowed be thy name you're the boss thy kingdom come and thy will be done I've been asked for nothing yet Jesus what about my thy will be on earth oh that's even in my family in my life as it's already done in heaven now this is the first thing give us this day our daily bread that's the first give me in the Lord's Prayer but it's almost over now I thought there was a lot more gives me I like to give to me Our Daily Bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom back to worship and thine is the power and thine is the glory forever and ever amen there wasn't very many Gift means of that prayer see that was God that was God teaching us how to pray and there's times when you will pray or you're actually husbands there's times that husbands need to let their wife talk amen she has half your brains she has all your looks and she has at least half your wisdom whether you're a male chauvinist or not amen but but God needs to talk to us but he can't talk to brother Dale unless I'll go in my closet and let him talk you know the Bible says to pray in secret and what you do in secret God will reward you openly because prayer has a way of taking brother Dale out of brother Dale it has a way of humbling ourselves and coming so God can talk to us and God's the Capstone head amen he's the king of the house amen wow you know so our Prophet you know in the one scripture uh it talked about just not me sorry and then one job is it's like oh here we go you talked about uh pray without ceasing and oh you talked about you'll see this scripture sorry I'm sorry there's unbelievable how many scriptures there is you know you know let's look at Ephesians 5 20 and 21. and here brother Ben mentioned this and I want to I want to move our prayer into another part you know our our prayer fellowship with God will be in secret but there's something else we need to pick up here and and and and we we got to use a bunch of the Bible to pick it up and that Ephesians 5 20 and and 21. it talks about here and brother Ben mentioned this and I uh 20 okay and I want 21 sorry cementing yourselves oh one to the other now that's going to be hard to get reverence and Bishops out of that one now we all had different callings and and positions you know I'm not taking away from that but that's surrender is to happen in prayer amen you know if just be you know God planned on us being able to communicate with one another and not everything being judged remember what we talked about before brother might pray just you know what I'm saying now you see what I'm saying I'm trying to get you somewhere here see the scripture talks about uh oh man I'm still having trouble forgive me my main scripture well it's like this we're not going home until we find it oh my I'm sorry it's my first day amen there's there's a scripture in the Bible it's only laid my finger on that that the Americans use a lot where I talked about if the people will humble themselves they come to God and pray he'll heal their land well the prophet you know it don't say it in the Bible amen honey if you find that for me so much the prophet don't they don't say in the Bible assemble together and yet the prophet said every time he quoted that scripture every single time 21 times to be exact he said that you shall assemble together to pray and he said at once they will assemble to pray every time the prophet was preaching and he mentions that scripture he says you would Assemble to pray amen and the Bible talks about and there's we're going to look into other scriptures where it talks about when the people were came together how the the fear of God fell on the people around them because they were together the fear and power of God was together amen it was that the praying together and he says and I don't want to show you something when the when the politicians use that scripture and it's a nice scripture and it fits but it's not talking about the land the prophet said that it's talking about this land and the prophet said he said you are the salt of the earth and if you don't pray or you don't come together and assemble the self together he said the salt and I got this quote here and I'm going to read it somewhere but he said the salt is going to lose its savor amen he said that's my Jacob folks amen let's just read a couple quotes here he said when when he thought how he would had been deceived by his brother this is a Jacob quote too also and he called them to an all-night prayer meeting God knows what the church needs there's some more preaching which which preaching is good because like we have the truth so that is good here hear and hear him he said the reason that this one you caught me early amen the reason that we don't see miracles all night prayer meanings and things that we used to have is because something has happened and the Holy Spirit cannot be blessed wow Ken amen God help us and so I I searched that scripture amen Matthew 5 13 I just found it let me re let me read you what he says here he said here's just one of his quotes this is a uh uh let me read the scripture you're the salt of the earth but if the salt no no oh no that's the wrong one we don't want that one sorry the salt has lost its savor where with so it'd be salty it is hence good for nothing and cast out to be trotted underfoot and our Prophet dovetailed that with prayer together and you see Jesus came back to his disciples together he said an hour you couldn't pray you couldn't pray an hour just one hour you couldn't pray with me amen God help us amen God help us to see he said see we haven't humbled ourself to come under God's anointing through prayer and maybe that's why the land ain't always healed because if the people will humble themselves see see you can pray in your closet and that's a certain kind of humbling but when you come together and submit yourself to one another that's another kind of humbling amen amen you know what I'm saying anybody that stands behind this desk it don't matter if you lead songs or sing a special or pray or something and something just don't flow like you can't find your verse like me this morning because I'm trying to use my iPad not print paper amen and the devil will just step in there and put up the butterflies you see but it's but it's here's God you see that's the humbling and when you come down God comes up amen and so when you bow down in prayer amen it's powerful amen powerful what God plans uh Second Chronicles 7 14. yeah let's pull that up I don't know why I didn't print it off no but sorry Satan you're going to lose I hit it on the top of my quote sheets amen and behold them he said now you can say I can show you here he says I can show me somebody that belongs to church he says oh here sorry let me start again he said now can you show me somebody that belongs to church he said thousands he said can you show me somebody that shouts thousands and believe me and I I'd be one of them I like that can you show me somebody that speaks with tongues thousands somebody that works miracles thousands but show me somebody that has size in Christ for the Abominations done in the church the Bible says in land the prophet says in the church you can't see a lot that are praying you can see a lot that are doing other things you can't see a lot that are praying amen he says I'm just reading the Highlight tonight listen he oh he says we've lowered the bars and let sin come in and tonight we've listened to the knock come out our door and we return oh unto me my people and call on my name and assemble myself together and pray and you'll hear from heaven now the scripture don't actually let's read this if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and return from thy Wicked Ways then I will hear from him then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their hands now my question to you is why did the prophet every single time he say that say assemble themselves well you I I will break that down I believe for you amen of course he had uh visions and insight but this is wrote in a plural standings this ain't wrote like if one person that's called by my name no if my people if my church let's see if my church that's called by my name if the bride that's called by my name will assemble myself will humble themself and humble in themselves see it's all plural and our Prophet took that rate out and put a symbol amen and turn from their wacky ways they'll hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and I'll heal their land this land even this land amen amen Even in our day even this land amen thank you Jesus in the expression he said the Pentecostal church has been expecting a visit from the promised land and the restoration of the gifts and so forth but as soon as it began to speak in tongues and interpret it begin to organize and different organizations separated each other I mean that was one thing with this weekend it was beautiful to see people from Windsor to Toronto amen it was just beautiful organized and separating themselves on things like that he's talking about tongues and interpretation and you battled around for 40 years though it's it's now 100 years battled around for 100 years and you keep modeling as long as you do that but when you get yourself together like they did in the day of Pentecost and come together and expect God to do something if the people that are called by my name will assemble themselves and get together and pray then I'll hear from heaven now if we would do that we can expect something until you do that we might as well not expect it wow this is expectation 610207 paragraph 29. until you come together and pray you might as well not expect God to move expectation 610207 paragraph 29. he says you might as well not expect it because it's not coming we've got two full we've got to fully obey God's word wow now I would not now I'm studying okay so I'm looking at this from a study path so I'm digging through the Bible to see where it says assemble and pray it's not there but this our Prophet seeing this scripture as a symbol and pray because it's wrote my people my bride my church and themselves humble themselves amen so hear God and through our prophet he don't want you just to humble yourself to God only but each other what brother Ben say Sunday when he said if people had something he said now that's Christianity now that's when you can go and say Hey you know I that's Christianity amen even brother Nelson mentioned something that that don't make you that's just that's a real thing that takes it off the stage a stage is just a set where only you can see the front but when you turn around this there's no back in it we got some pictures taken like that in in the mall in Edmonton it was all Western pictures and they just tied them around our neck and it was just the front half that's what that's what the church has become so much it's just a stage we come Sunday morning when we put on our best plate we write down the scriptures on paper so we don't get lost as a minister because we don't want to be real to the people I'm only human guess what you are too man and God loves that but he wants us to see us take her pillows off the real one to another amen fully obey until we fully obey I'm just dropping to where I highlighted and all them other isms that you got on you'll forget your differences when you come together and pray amen see it's just a way of humbling yourself and when I expect some and then I'll expect something to happen from Heaven you won't be worrying about what sister potty brought for lunch today you know you know what I just try and think of something if you know what I mean like what I did yesterday you know what I'm saying like hey as believers we should just be we're supposed to be friends if you know eternity don't have a number that's a long time and after a long time it's still there and our Prophet clearly said I heard it last night when I had my iPad going all night and woke up in the middle of the night he said it's a real place we're real people there if you don't like me here you're going to have trouble there That's why nothing but perfect love will be there in my head it may stop it's you know what I'm saying we might as well start being real here you know amen I'm not saying be be careless and intentionally sloppy but if we make a mistake we're humans you know if you did some of the things our Prophet did you know he was comfortable you know the prophet the one time he jumped up on the platform and daggled his legs over and was preaching a message I wouldn't try to do that today I'd probably kill myself but you see what I mean he was comfortable with the people he was comfortable with himself he was comfortable with the word of God because he was in fellowship with God in my head he wasn't proving nothing it was God can prove everything in my head I don't I don't study the week before and think wow I'm going to prove to the people I'm of God are you kidding that church is down the road amen or do you know what I'm saying denomination Like Son you can't manufacture God that's Grace amen what you do in secret God will reward you openly but even in the prayer amen there's where you'll pray for your Governors and all your whatever but God even expects us to be together amen and pray I'm going to find this here's another one he said my people will assemble themselves if my people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then I'll hear from heaven and heal their land it's their body and there and here he says that he says he says they are the salt of the earth you know you you can read that scripture No it's not talking about the Earth all those politicians think they're going to heal the states this Earth is the devil's domain until the Millennium it ain't going to be healed amen until we go in the millennium but we are the salt of the earth and if the salts left the Savior then warehances are good for nothing is cast aside at the feet of men you recognize that salt is Savor and it connects it connects prayer connects we must be connected to God when's the last time we talked to God when's the last time brother Dale talked to God for an hour amen I love in the wintertime I'll come here on an off day and spend an afternoon in the church and just amen I'll pray kneeling down I'll walk around praying I'll sit in different people's Pew and pray for them and I'll walk around the whole place and pray and I'll be mopping praying and and the man she's just God wants to see you know what God wants to see yeah well let me let me rephrase it like this when I was well let me say like this when I was in a courtship I was I almost said when I was in love I was never in a hurry you know when it was time to leave I was planning on leaving at six and seven came and went eight came and went nine came and went and then I left my brother Dale don't pray like that but when brother Dale does you see when we pray like that where you get lost in prayer you just like whoa That was supposed to be somewhere that help us man that helped me now let's look at our example in the Old Testament and Genesis oh where'd you go you know oh you're saying uh my iPad played a trick on me you know here in Genesis 32 you can pull this up Amy and go through it as we go and I'm going to read some quotes from you here and you know we're so blessed with the truth and the message and it took the scales off her eyes and and so the Bible is even Jesus here is thanking the father he said I'm glad you hit it from the wise and prudent and you revealed it on to babes that would just learned amen and so there's things wrote in this chapter that our Prophet grabs up amen and you can tell and and you can see how the stroke but here Jacob had been blessed from his dad by he was a he was a Deceiver and had tricked his dad from his mom and he had taken the family blessing and then he had laughed and now he's married and God's actually blessed him and he's very wealthy he has much possessions but now he's coming back to meet the very brother that he sabotaged tricked amen and he scared to death and at this point he didn't have a backbone yet it's instated later in his life and so he sends out he takes his possessions and let's just go to uh a nine or six Amy well actually actually sorry forgive me let's go back to three and Jacob sent Messengers uh before him to Esau his brother and the land of Surrey the country of Edom and here here he had no backbone he said he said I'll give everything I own including all my kids and wife as long as I keep my neck boys I'd really want him as the guard of the home wow amen now let's just drop to six and The Messengers kept returning to Jacob and they said Esau your brother has come to met us and he has 400 men Army with them Jacob had close to zero amen he was petrified the Bible says later in this scripture he was petrified and well here he says and the Sabbath and Jacob was greatly afraid in distress and he divided his people with them at his flocks and his herds and Campbells into two bands he said I'll sacrifice to you all songs I can live oh bye day amen let's just drop to nine and Jacob said here Jacob you know I was just you can stay there for a minute we're a lot like Jacob when we pray an hour it's when we're afraid when we pray an hour we got an army after us might not be our brother might be the government might be the tax collector might be the rent collector might be the mortgage the banks might be our car it might be our wife huh oh god oh I'm in a mess fix me God's like who are you I haven't got you in my contacts you know when you get a text message and the people in your contacts are named don't come up so we're like oh God I'm in a pickle I'm gonna pickle I'm gonna be kicked out this though that's guy's from the other side of the world I don't know who he is well because you'd never talk to him people you don't talk to you don't put in your contact but God's the same way Oh you mean you're a small G God so would God be any different if you never talk to him do you think God puts the ones that are of the devil your father Satan they're not in his contact oh Jacob was a scattered and the prophet said how he wrestled all night and God sent the Bible says a man he wrestled with the man but that was God it's a god came and he wrestled with God and he was bargaining with God if you'll pay my bill God I'll go to church next Sunday God I'll even put money in the offering if you pay my bill twice oh yeah that's how it works and he was trying to put God in a headlock you don't think so read this chapter he wrestled and wrestled Jacob had to get Jacob out of Jacob brother Dale has to get brother Dale with a brother Dale and anybody that has a relationship with God's going to get themselves out of themselves amen and Jacob said oh god father of Abraham my God the my father of Isaac the Lord which which said unto me returned unto thy country in the Kindred and I will deal well with thee so he's telling he now he's preaching to God God you promised bless God God's like I don't even have you in my contacts who are you he says I am not worthy of the least of all these mercies and Truth which thou has showed unto thy servant because God bless them for with my staff I have passed over Jordan and now I am come the two bands deliver me I pray thee in the hands from the hand of my brother and from the hands of Esau for I fear Him I wonder how much Jacob prayed all night before he feared somebody Spirits don't die it's a perfect shadow of where we're living right today perfect shadow so I fear Him let's see will come and smite me and the mother with their children Jacob was afraid when brother Dale gets afraid and when you get afraid that's not the only time God wants to hear from us that'd be like your wife only coming to you when you were afraid or she only comes to you when she's sick you know and thou setest I will surely do good oh I loved it man he we we're bold God now listen to me you said you would surely do good to me and make thy seed the sand and God's like we better keep wrestling man the drop down to 24. and Jacob had sent everything ahead everything he don't including his wife and children and then Jacob was alone with God Jacob was left alone and there he wrestled with the man God until it was the breakup day now because you're blessed and you're in the message you don't even every other denominational Church to read that as an angel or a man our Prophet taught us zillions of times it was God it was God amen and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his high thigh see here Jacob I lost one of my Jacob wouldn't let him go until he blessed them I wanted to read that part but see it was coming the breaking of day and he needed to let him go and he saw that he did not Prevail against him he touched the hollow of his thigh the hollow of Jacob's sight went out a joint as he wrestled with them and he said let me go here's God talking to Jacob let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go accept you bless me that's where each one of us have to be like so locked in with God that you don't want to separate from God amen and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob for as a prince hast thou power with God and with man and hath prevailed and Jacob Osman said he said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said unto yeah wait sorry yes he said and Jacob's asked him he said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou doest thus ask for my name and he said and he blessed him there and Jacob called the place help me out honey pennio for I have seen the face of God and this is where I got my title and my life is preserved I have seen the face of God that was an all night prayer meeting sadly it was when he was in fear but God never failed to come through now here in the message in his presence the prophet said pinnacle Pinnacle we're going to say it that way if I'm wrong forgive me Pinnacle the word pinnacle means in the Hebrew the face of almighty God now there's where even this where Jacob or the scriptures is wrote I have seen God face to face but the Bible earlier said there was a man I've seen God face to face Panico it means the face of God and Jacob was a little Shaker and ran his name Jacob means the supplanter or Deceiver and his life he had run away from God but when he got one on one in the presence of God the Pinnacle in the face of God when he got in the Pinnacle the face of God he got a hold of God and he wouldn't turn him loose and if we would stay until and he and he stayed there until set up and God said let me go the sun's arising and he stayed in the face of God until son up and then he went away Justified and saved amen you know the Bible clearly and our Prophet clearly said that that's what Jacob received the Holy Ghost there's a perfect type of the Holy Ghost because you know as believers when you're converted you walk different amen you're not a believer and got the old things hanging on your life that you brought to the relationship amen amen there's no way Jacob was a perfect he was named the prince but his hip was out of joint he walked the rest of his days with the limp he said the church needs to do like Jacob did pray until they get a v-day victory day he said Jacob wrestled wrestled he said he wrestled all night with the Lord so there's multiple places the prophet called the man the Lord he wrestled all night with the Lord but he said I'm just not going to let you go till you give me Victory what he was saying is I'm just not letting I'm not stopping praying to U.S or my prayer wow wow God help us amen here's the one where we talked about you know I'm just going to read this in church order just for amen he said don't stand there like the Hypocrites and do it for a long time and pray long prayers and say this and that and the other and showing off he says God help us amen God help us in our church ranks and when you pray enter into that closet and do it in secret amen this is your one-on-one fellowship with God amen and he'll reward you openly he talks in here church over he said he said when you come and have have prayer and the song later calls somebody for us he said don't pray for sister so and so and brother so and so in the hospital and so and so and so and so and so and so and remember the government and all this he said that's for your private prayers amen amen God help us amen amen I'm just looking for an email Psalms eight and we're going to close here Psalms 89 6 and 7 are just finishing our some of our scriptures may God help us all amen God help me amen we know that assembling yourself together it's not a law but if we can amen and even for prayer I mean it's just so powerful amen Psalms 80 89. I can't read my writing now Psalms 89 I think it is six and seven who in heaven can be compared to the Lord oh that's beautiful who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord he is Jehovah but watch the next one but God is greatly to be feared in the uh assembly of the Saints if the Believers the people if the bride would humble themselves assemble themselves come together and pray we'd really see something here he said God would greatly be feared in the Assembly of the Saints and to be made in reverence of all them that are about him amen there's power in assembling there's power in prayer but there's power in the Assembly of prayer and prayer beings Prophet said many many many things about the all-night prayer meeting just you could just go on and on and it wasn't that it it had to have a Time on it that it was but to pray until you prayed through pray till you got your answer pray till you had enough time that God could talk back to you amen did God have a relationship that you'd be on the contacts of God when you come back in need God help us God help assist them you see in the scriptures also Daniel we didn't mention Daniel even the Bible says when Daniel knew that the decreed was passed knew it was passed you know I'm back and looked at that and studying you know it don't mention about Daniel in that chapter and how he prayed before the decree was passed you read that chapter where it talks about Daniel praying three times a day it said that it said that he was greatly loved by the king and the other people of the Kingdom were jealous or envious of them and it said when Daniel when Daniel knew that the decreed was signed he never changed his form of worship he opened his windows just like he always did and he prayed out loud just like he always did he prayed three times a day you know God must have been working on me on this message because you know when it was a little bit nicer me and Luanne were coming back from I don't even know where it was and and I'll be honest it kind of Jarred me a bit or whatever the right word is amen we were coming back and we were on the 401. we stopped in the rest area and Luanne went into the bathroom I don't even know why for a reason I'd stayed there I think we had a trailer or something and there was another person or whatever whatever they were doing walking around people that pray regularly in the different times of day and they were in the middle of the parking lot where the semis pulled around and went behind the McDonald's in the drive-through now I'll tell you right now they don't have one Speck of what you have not not even a speck you need a you need a microscope to see what they got compared to the Revelation and the word of God that you have and it was time for them to pray to what they call God he dropped his mat right on the pavement took off his shoes and bent over on his head man I sat in the truck and watched that in a bit of all if he could worship a false god that powerful and we're his wife we're the bride of Christ wow where do we come in amen God help us sing that song in a Sweet Hour of Prayer amen many things our Prophet said about you know the power was in unity and coming together and forgetting our differences in unity and he literally changed that scripture every take every single time he mentioned it every single time you go in the message hub and he calls it assembled themselves together pray it was it was a power and the unity of Prayer and he said some pretty strong things about that he said that's why we're not seeing what we think we should be seeing and we won't do it until we get serious in a relationship with God God help us amen amen [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] pray that calls me from a word of care [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign Lord Jesus we apologize for our our confusion this morning Lord Jesus to the Believers but we pray that you'll take all the scrambled puzzle Lord Jesus and reveal it to your bride how you revealed it to me this week Lord Jesus and God we just pray that your just bring that strong desire back in a relationship of prayer even our private prayer where we can spend time and fellowship with you Lord Jesus like you long and yearn to but like your word says you know what we have need of before we ask but you want us to come and fellowship and ask and a relationship with you Lord Jesus bless our fellowship after Lord Jesus and bless all those who have drove even the roads being poor and the north Lord Jesus the bless them and bring us all safe back home Lord Jesus in your beautiful name we pray amen God bless you all [Music] foreign [Music]
