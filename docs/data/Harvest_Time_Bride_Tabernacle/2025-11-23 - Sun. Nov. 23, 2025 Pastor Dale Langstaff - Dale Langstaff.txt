Thank you musicians and thank you Jared and Amen. God is good. Just remember brother Jeff and sister Dom just the kids she had messaged me many times uh through the week and the kids were very very sick and many of them and different ones. Sister Ruth and brother Bernard's family was very very sick last Sunday. So we just pray that they're doing good now. We just welcome you all. So, so many are out for different reasons. Amen. But God, God knows everything. Amen. Amen. Amen. Just good to be in, you know, Brother Bram talked about a service he had in Saskatchewan and he said it was terribly, terribly cold and it was in a house meeting and he said it was one of the very best meetings he ever had. And then he clarifies why it was so good. He said there was 13 people there and he said it was one of our greatest meetings because I said I had less spirits to fight through while ministering the word. &gt;&gt; So you know you can look around you and you can be disappointed that the church ain't full or you can look around and say I'm glad that God will be able to minister more easily because there'll be less devils. Brother Bram said that. Brother Brham said the devil comes every service, &gt;&gt; but there will be less spirits that God would have to get out of the way to actually get to the real heart of the issue. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in everything is a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want to read a poem that kind of goes along with what we're ministering on and and maybe this morning it'll be a little different, you know. Uh, I kind of want to today if God will let me, I'm I'm going to show some scriptures, but I'm going to show just some quotes and just kind of see, you know, you can read into anything whatever you want to. You know, the world's reading into different interpretations of the Bible, &gt;&gt; and you can do that with everything. And so sometimes people look at the exact same book and they said it says this. Some people say look at the Bible and say it's a hate which hate speech. Anybody here think the Bible's hate speech? &gt;&gt; But you know a huge majority of the world think it is. So, you know, sometimes when I read the message and study the message and God leads me in ways you could, a man could never put it together. I I actually was reading my devotions this morning and it was confirmation what we preached last Sunday. &gt;&gt; Reading my like the devotions come from from uh Pastor Myra in Uganda. I mean, he has no clue what we're doing here. &gt;&gt; Amen. But, you know, sometimes we just if we just see what the word of God says &gt;&gt; and see what the message says and maybe we're interpreting it as hate speech when it isn't hate speech. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're interpreting something different. The title of this poem is the reaction of most people when they get to heaven. the reaction of most people when they walk in heaven. I was shocked, confused, bewildered as I entered heaven's door. Not of the beauty of it all, nor of the lights or of the decor. But it was the folks in heaven who made me sputter and gasp. The thieves, the liars, the sinners, the alcoholics, and all the trash. There stood the kid from seventh grade who stole my lunch money many times. And next to him, my old neighbor who never said nothing nice. Bob, who I was sure was rotting in hell, was sitting pretty on cloud nine, looking incredibly well. I nudged Jesus and said, "What's the deal?" I'd love to hear your take on all this stuff that's here. How did all these sinners get up here? You must have made a mistake. And why is everyone so quiet, so sober? Please, Jesus, give me a clue." Jesus answered me and said, "Hush, child. They're all in shock. Not one of them thought they'd ever be seeing you. Sometimes &gt;&gt; we think different than God. &gt;&gt; You know, Paul was a murderer. &gt;&gt; David had an affair. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a cheater. Peter had a temper. &gt;&gt; And we judge our brothers and sisters. Be careful you're not judging somebody that God put the kingdom of heaven &gt;&gt; in the Bible in charge of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; God help us. You know it at the end of that poem it said every saint has a past but every sinner has a future. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be careful how we judge. &gt;&gt; Be careful how we judge. Let's read Matthew 20. Maybe you can stand if you don't mind. Matthew 23:12 and then we'll turn to John. Going to read another scripture. Matthew 23 and 12. And I'm just going to wait till Vicki pulls it up. &gt;&gt; And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. If we turn to 1 John 3 and9, 1 John 3 and 9, whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for his seed remainth in him, and he cannot sin because he's born of God. Lord Jesus, we pray that you would bless your people, Lord God, and may you bless your word incredibly, Lord God. And Lord, I pray that you'll reveal yourself onto all of us. And Lord, take the scales off my eyes and by revelation reveal the deity of yourself and who you are. And we give you the glory and honor for it in your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. I was listening to my message last week and and uh I was thinking, "Wow, maybe I came across hard or but you know, God, you know, when the anointing comes, it's just you're not really in well, you're not at all in charge of how you are." But I want to look at my first quote here. You know, last week we said something about uh somebody had mentioned uh a visiting minister had mentioned in another church, not here, had visited a couple churches in Ontario. And he mentioned that some were eternal life and some would get eternal life. And that's on scripture and it's also on message. And so I just going to let the prophet answer that for you. I I I explained some of that light yesterday, but I this was my quote that came up when I was doing my devotions this morning. The very first one right under my title, Vicki, Brother Bam says, "Put me on record of that there's only one form of eternal life and God alone has eternal life." So to have eternal life, you had to come from God. You had to be in Genesis 1:26-27. Let us make man in our image. And here, Brother Bam says there's not there's no two types of eternal life. There's no new two types of eternal life. So, you know, when somebody comes, you know, it it was just God. I I knew it didn't sound right when the man was ministering, but here's what the prophet says. There's no two types of eternal life. One, eternal life, and that's all that lives. Remember that it's put on your note, too. Everything that's being made that had a beginning has an end. That's our flesh. &gt;&gt; Our flesh had a beginning. Our flesh will have an end. But the real you, the theophony inside you, never had a beginning &gt;&gt; if you came from God. &gt;&gt; And everything that had a beginning has an end. But only and only that that made no beginning has no end. And there's only one thing that never had a beginning, and that was God. &gt;&gt; So if somebody came from God, &gt;&gt; you're eternal. &gt;&gt; Somebody asked Brother Bramman questions and answers. two will be there. You'll be there if you came from God and your name was wrote in the Lamb's book of life. If you were in the thought of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that you can raise in the resurrection is to have eternal life within you. See, the only way you'll ever come back is something that had no beginning. Then you got eternal life, sons and daughters of God. And you can no more die than God can die because you are a part of God. And you know what God's trying to show us in these messages? And I I I pray that next Sunday it's going to be the last and then we're going to go on to something nice in December, something uh butterfly. But uh what in the past history always repeats itself. spirits never die. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you in the New Testament, well, matter of fact, in in quotes, Brother Bam said, everybody that was serving God always tried to divide God's people. The disciples tried to do that. We showed you last week and and and you're we're going to look at new brand new scriptures where everybody's trying to I got it and they don't. &gt;&gt; And that's not of God. &gt;&gt; It's not of God. And I'm I'm well, no, I I almost said I'm sorry to harp on this, but I'm actually not sorry because I'm just obeying what God's genuinely laid on my heart. And the prophet said a huge amount about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and God don't want nobody to be deceived into thinking that we're right when we're actually wrong. &gt;&gt; Watch how we carry on in this scripture of Matthew 23 and 13. But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom of God against men. Here's Jesus telling the scribes and Pharisees, don't take people out of the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm Jeho, you know, pret I'm Jehovah. I'll decide who gets in the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; He's calling them hypocrites. Hey, now the Pharisees and scribes were the Christians of that day. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We We need We just need to leave it alone. Don't Don't interfere with what God's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. For ye never watch this. Let's carrying on on verse 13. For ye neither go in yourself, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to go in. It's talking about going into heaven. &gt;&gt; See how they were trying to say, "We're going into heaven, but you're not." &gt;&gt; And God calls them hypocrites. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, one thing we clarified, and I want to clarify it this week, you cannot come to truth and turn it down. &gt;&gt; That's iniquity. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that. &gt;&gt; But there will be ones in the world that have not received as much blessing of truth as you. &gt;&gt; And you have no right to judge them. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? I'm not talking about iniquity. You can't come to this message. That is the gospel truth, the Bible revealed. And turn it down. It's not possible. &gt;&gt; Cuz it is the Bible unveiled. &gt;&gt; But there will be those that have not come to this message. &gt;&gt; That if you judge them, Christ will call you a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says we are judged onto a mount that we have received. Upon the revelation that you have received, you will be judged. If you turn down the revelation of this message that God give you, you'll be judged. &gt;&gt; But don't you go judging somebody else that ain't received that revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Verse 14. Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye devour widows houses, and for pretense make long prayers. Therefore, you shall receive a greater damnation. Wait a minute. They thought they were going to receive a greater heaven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They thought because they were the message of the hour following Moses law that they were going to have a bigger portion of heaven. And Jesus said, "You will have a bigger damnation." &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, God wants to show you something. Woe onto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you compress the sea and land, and make one &gt;&gt; procelite. And when he is made, ye make him twofold more children of hell than ye yourselves. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's look into some things that the prophet said, which is so true. I mentioned this last week, but you know, it's good to hear it from our prophet. You know, I told you last week that there's 52 countries that the Bible is it's illegal to have a Bible. &gt;&gt; Let's see what Brother Brown said about it. Because he did. He said, "But I'll tell you one thing, friends. It's not fair. &gt;&gt; All these preachers, you know, you know, sometimes pastors need to travel." &gt;&gt; Brother Bam talked about that. &gt;&gt; I I'm just going to jump ahead and read it because you've heard the message preached and preached and preached and preached and preached. My next quote says that &gt;&gt; and you decide if you value it. But I'll tell you what, when I go to a country that people haven't heard it preached, they come days early. They come in the hundreds. They drive five hours on a Wednesday night and come back on a Thursday night. 5 hours drive because they can't help themsel. But because you've seen the ocean so much, you'll never draw a picture of the ocean because it's become common to you. The prophet said that all you pictures preachers stay in America here and preach the gospel over and over and over to the people when there's half the world or nearly twothirds of them that have never heard the name of Jesus Christ. Now, we had somebody here and said, "You can't go to heaven, can't go in the rapture unless you know brother Bram's name." Here, brother Bram saying that half the world hasn't even heard Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, I was looking through these quotes, there was about 428 or 38, I forget it, and there was spots in there. He said, "He will hold us accountable." You know why? Because he says to go into all the world and preach the gospel. That's your only commission. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You should tell everybody you get I don't mean I don't mean throw your pearls before the swine, but there's some people that are just gifted that every time they get a chance, they say, "Do you know Jesus Christ?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian? &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bam told the story about being in the hospital and he asked he was going to pray for his person. You remember the story? And he was going to pull, he wanted to know if he pulled the curtain. He said, "Are you a Christian, ma'am? I'm going to pray for this sick person over. I'll let you know I'm a Baptist and I burn a candle every He" He said, "I never asked you that." You know what we would say? I'll let you know I'm a message believer and I go to so and so's church. &gt;&gt; I never asked you that. &gt;&gt; Because the devil go all those message churches every Sunday &gt;&gt; and he don't never miss. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he's in every gathering. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here the prophet says, "And there's half the people in the world, they nearly twothirds have never heard the name of Jesus." And us fat message preachers can stand here and say, "You don't have the opportunity to go in the rapture unless you know brother Brandham personally." when we haven't had enough gall and get up to go and preach the gospel to the whole world and that was our only commission. Brother Bram said we built hospitals, we built churches, we built nice houses. He said he brother Bram said this. He said it's a sin to build a fancy two or three or four million dollar church here and the people over there preaching haven't eaten three meals a week. &gt;&gt; A week. Yeah, &gt;&gt; a weak &gt;&gt; brotherham said that. Anybody wants quotes? I can give them to you. A sin. We live so high in the hog and we think we got all the answers to decide who's going to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; He said, watch this. He said, "You just stayed in a humble here and preached the gospel and you're and you you and the and preached it till your gospel harden." That's exactly what's happened in message churches in rich countries. &gt;&gt; Because when you get hardened, you get bitter and arrogant &gt;&gt; and puffed up. I can tell you what the prophet said that God, the Holy Spirit does when you get arrogant. &gt;&gt; He just flies away &gt;&gt; and then those heathens over yonder are dying and we say, "Well, you can't come." That's my vision. I go to them. Brother man said, "I go to them." And there's where God has blessed because they're hungering and they're thirsting and they want to hear something. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm just showing you what our prophet said. &gt;&gt; You know, like I would just say it like this. What are we going to do with these quotes? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What are we going to do with these scriptures? &gt;&gt; Our next one here. &gt;&gt; Now you wonder why it's hard to preach in America. Then he goes the next paragraph. He says in India, he said it was estimated that there was a half a million people there. He preached to try to get half a million people together in Canada and America. You know why there was half a million? It wasn't just because they had a lot of people because they'll do anything to get there. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our next the next paragraph. He said, "Do you not believe that we ought to be building?" He said, "I do not believe, sorry, I do not believe that we ought to be building three and four million dollar churches and preaching Jesus is coming when men on the mission field are preaching the gospel with no shoes." That's not right. here. He said, next paragraph said, "The other day under investigation, a fellow come up to Brother Bram. He said, "You buy souls, you buy your suits, sorry, from pennies in the States. They're $17. I can tell they're cheap suits." Brother Bam said, "Yes, that's right. They're cheap suits." He said, 'Well, you can afford a better suit than that. And this is what Brother Bam said, paragraph 25. He said, "Not when my brothers and sisters are eating two meals a week, no shoes on their feet, preaching the gospel, and I'm stand and I'm gospel that I'm standing for. And I can't afford better than that." You see, &gt;&gt; see how it's so all I'm showing you is see how it's so easy for us here to become arrogant. &gt;&gt; If you ever travel to the majority of the world, you'll never come home arrogant. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's exactly right. Now, this is still our prophet talking. Verse 26, he said, "We have no right, no sir. No, we have no rights to blow millions for baked buildings." That's almost any more than millions are dying that don't even know the name of Jesus Christ as savior and are crying and begging to receive this message. and we put a big church up on the corner and prost like this one and the other on the corner over here and have fun of them and make fun of them and tell them that they're all wrong. Millions of such a thing are going on. Millions are dying nearly yearly and never heard the name of Jesus one time. Now watch how he finishes this. While we're fussing, they're dying over there without knowing Christ. God, can everybody see the bottom of that? &gt;&gt; Is any brother? You don't have to get God is going to hold you responsible on that day. I'm just I just am naive enough to believe that. &gt;&gt; Watch how the prophet ends this. He said, "Now, that wasn't in my sermon notes. That wasn't in my text, but I can't help myself from saying those things." I just say, "Wow." I just say, "I wonder if we're really," you know what I mean? We We should, Brother Bam said, and and we're going to get to some other quotes, but he said, "If you've received what you've received, you should be so humble. You should be so gratitude. should just be oh Jesus I don't deserve salvation &gt;&gt; but in many cases sadly it brings a religious spirit of arrogance but you know why you know why brother Bram said that Paul had the infirmity that he had when Paul went back to Jesus three times he said my grace is sufficient for you is because of the enormous revelation of this message. &gt;&gt; This message, Brother Brham said, I preached what Paul preached. And he said, "If I hadn't have plagued your body with an infirmity, you would have got lifted up." And so all of us that don't have an infirmity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. I don't mean that you can change the world. I don't mean that you can go preach to every soul in the world, but you can sure not be arrogant. I don't mean that you can feed everybody. And I'm not asking you for your money, but you can sure be humble. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, you have really blessed me and my family abundantly above what I could even imagine or comprehend." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Let's go to our next uh scripture. Those that are born of God, do not commit sin. For the seed, here's the prophet talking. I just seeing this is questions and answers. He says, "The seed of God, the promise of Abraham," he's just talking about the resurrection. This is kind of off our topic here. He said, "But the seat, the uh 171, sorry Vicki, paragraph 171, the seed of God remainth in him. The Holy Ghost comes and abideth not from the be meeting to meeting but eternal. Now if you want to put the scripture down Ephesians 6 or Ephesians 4:30, grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you've been sealed until the day of your redemption. See, the seed of God remains in you. If you came from God, Genesis 1:26, what I'm trying to show you is is there will be people that aren't manifesting that yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they still are that. &gt;&gt; And so you can be judging somebody that's living worldly, manifesting like Paul was a murderer, but he was chosen of God before the foundation of the world. And so when you judge that person, you're actually judging God. And you saying, "But he didn't look like God." God says, "So that's where we get in trouble." Next paragraph. And now then you see a man disagreeing with God's word and saying, "Oh, that there was for another age." Watch what he says here. When the promise was to whosoever will, let him come. See, we just have to be really careful that we don't put somebody out that God's put in. &gt;&gt; See, because God said it was for whosoever will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just remember, he is an unbeliever and he's not of God. Here, Brother Bram saying, if you're putting somebody out because of your judgment when God said it was for whosoever will, and they could be they could have literally came from the side of God. No, they're not manifesting it yet. The woman at the well that Jesus had an appointment with wasn't manifesting a daughter of God, but she was a daughter of God when Jesus met her. He said, 'The people that do that, remember, they're not even a believer. They're not of God. Wow. That that's that's heavy. Amen. Let's go to another quote here. The father promised that you would and I believe that you are risen from the dead 2,000 years ago and are alive tonight calling simple people just as you always did. One here and one there. Now watch. Now this this is where you can't lock it in your message. Now this is what the prophet said and he brought the message. Simple people that you just always did. One here and one there. No groups, no organizations and no great mannerisms of what a man had done. Wow. That's what he preached in ' 64 after the seals. It don't sound to me like brother Bram was preaching that you have to know him to go in the rapture. This is 64. This is after the greatest unveiling of revelation ever happened. Romans 4. But I'm I'm going to I I don't want to but this message is the greatest privilege to know that it ever was. &gt;&gt; But it see how it should just you just said, "Oh, God." Like I was a sinner and you showed me all of this. Wow. Romans 4 3-12. And I I want to read this and just show you how how people have always tried to block people from God. Christians have always blocked people from God. You know the Bible says this, who is the accuser of the brethren? The Bible says Satan is the accuser of the brethren. But you know who he works through? Make believers. &gt;&gt; You have somebody come up and says, "I don't think you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost." You know who just spoke out of them? Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan just needed a vessel &gt;&gt; to speak out of. Watch Romans 4 here. I, you know, I don't know if we've ever I've I've never quite read it this way that God revealed. For what saith the scriptures? Is that okay if we read the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness. We believe that. Now to him that workketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. Watch what he means here. Now to him that workketh is the reward not reckoned of grace. You see, if you think you can get to heaven, what he's saying here, if you think you can get to heaven by your good works, then Jesus died in vain. &gt;&gt; He didn't even have to die on the cross if you could have got there by doing a lot of work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But verse five, but to him that workketh not, uhoh. To him that workketh not, but believeth on him that justified the the message believers. &gt;&gt; Wow. God actually justifies ungodly people. His faith is counted for righteousness. That's an amazing verse. &gt;&gt; I don't have to work to get into heaven. &gt;&gt; It was amazing grace. I believe you will do works because you love him of I'm not I'm you know I'm preaching this morning because of that. But him that workketh not, &gt;&gt; but believeth on him that justifyth only message believers, the ungodly, his faith will be counted for righteousness. Next verse, Vicki. Even as David also described the blessedness of a man unto whom God imputth righteousness without works. See, God ain't counting on where you were born, where you were where you went to church, where which we believe in that. But see, if you were, what I'm trying to say is if you were born in the one-third or half the world that's never heard of Jesus and God reveals himself to you by revelation and you believe in God, however that God reveals that to you, you won't have the revelation that you and me have. &gt;&gt; But you'll be there just like us. Those that are first shall be last, and those that are last think they'll be first, &gt;&gt; the last will be first. &gt;&gt; Saying, blessed are those, next verse, who iniquity iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. We serve an amazing God because see the amazing God that we serve is no respectors of person. Yeah, &gt;&gt; iniquities are forgiven. That's my sins &gt;&gt; and those sins are covered. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. But we as believers will call out and we're allowing Satan to work through us. &gt;&gt; I don't think they got it. I could never go there. &gt;&gt; Careful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse nine, cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only. You know what this means? That means that they were following the message truth of the day. Moses, watch this. I'm not pulling this out of context. This is Paul's teaching. Brother Bram said, "I preach what Paul preached." &gt;&gt; Paul laid the foundation. He said, "If any man from any an angel come and try to change my teaching, let him be a curse." &gt;&gt; And there's message ministers that are preaching that only the circumcised are going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Not what Paul said. Verse nine, I have to read it off my iPad because I got it highlighted. Cometh this blessedness upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also. Paul's asking us a question. &gt;&gt; For I say that faith was reckoned unto Abraham for righteousness. How was it then reckoned? Then he was circumcised or in uncircumcision. &gt;&gt; See, Paul is literally playing with your belief. &gt;&gt; Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. He received the sign of circumcision. The seal of righteousness is faith which is mean you must be born again. the seal of righteousness of faith that he had yet being uncircumcised. So he had not yet come into the message church of the day yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father father of all them that believe though they being not circumcised that the righteousness might impute unto them. Watch this I wish you could have put that up that last word unto them also. That don't sound like God's dividing the group of believers. &gt;&gt; That don't sound like he's saying, "Well, this church is going and this one isn't, and you got to have this pastor to go in the rapture, this." No, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; You must have the Holy Spirit tabernacled inside you. &gt;&gt; Unto them also. No, no, no, no. They can't go because they don't believe. Remember, they stoned Stephen because he disobeyed Moses law &gt;&gt; today. They can't stone people, but they can kill your influence. &gt;&gt; They ain't saying that guy ain't preaching the message. Don't go to that church. You're going to have big troubles. &gt;&gt; Just reading Paul's letter. &gt;&gt; Wow. Where are we? Did we read 11? Yes. So verse 12. And the father of the circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of faith of our father Abraham, which he being yet uncircumcised. Now there was God opening his arms and including all the believers &gt;&gt; that believed on him. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now is this Bible? Is this the me the the greatest messenger to the New Testament age? And brother Brown preached what Paul preached &gt;&gt; and he didn't divide it. He didn't divide the people. He said them also. and Abraham that the the the uncircumcised would follow in the faith of Abraham &gt;&gt; even though they hadn't yet come into the fullness of the message law. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's that's just amazing to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just amazing how much God has blessed us &gt;&gt; with what we have. Let's let's read some quotes of our prophet and we we won't be too long this morning, but I I just want to lay some things down here that may shock you. Now you got Now you got Now God doesn't limit himself. Oh, I got to wait for this one. Oh, I think we should have a ministers meeting now. God don't limit himself to any church. No, he doesn't. Remember when the disciples got to thinking one time that they were the only ones that would go, the only ones, Jesus said, verily next day, he sent out 70 others. &gt;&gt; By the way, this is brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; For anybody that says, "I'm not a message believer preacher." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; what are they preaching? &gt;&gt; What are 90% of message preachers preaching that we're the only ones? When Jesus said to the scene that the disciples refused everybody else, Brother Bram said the very next day he sent out 70 different people. &gt;&gt; You know what I said? Wow. Oh, you want to believe it? &gt;&gt; Watch this next paragraph. God never wants anyone to build anything around themselves. &gt;&gt; All the glory goes to Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of God. See, we mustn't try to think of ourselves or our church or we must spread our arms out and look for God. That's right. &gt;&gt; But what we do is we go They don't see the quotes I see. Bless God. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Oh, this is actually the prophet preaching. &gt;&gt; Oh, well. &gt;&gt; Wow. Next one. They get better. Remember last Sunday I told you I had some unbelievable stuff? Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the top line. Many persons have been what's that word? That's a big word. Deceived. Oh &gt;&gt; wow. And receiving the Holy Ghost. As I said, they got doctrines today. Oh, and by the way, this is God's messenger. They got messages, doctrines of this message that says like Elijah's garments and all those other things, manifestations of sons of God and all these different isms and so forth in the message today. People fall blindly on there and go to some kind of separation and rise back up with a uhoh, what's that big word again? &gt;&gt; Arrogant spirit, &gt;&gt; indifferent, fussing, and hightempered. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. One more line. That's not brother Dale preaching and that's not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Never seen that quote before. Do you know what the doctrines? He's talking about Elijah's message. You can doctrinate this message right into hell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right into hell. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got to have Elijah's garments and all these other things, manifestations of sons of God and all these other different isms. You know, we have a very small church here, but I have different people say, "Well, I've never seen it done like you do it there." I said, "So, &gt;&gt; and all these other different isms &gt;&gt; doctrines." &gt;&gt; Do you know the word at the top line was they're deceived? &gt;&gt; And they're deceived because in receiving the Holy Ghost, they thought they had the Holy Ghost because they followed the doctrines of Elijah. And brother Bram said, "That's not the spirit of God." Thank you very much. Nobody would believe this if Vicki didn't put that up on the screen. I could hardly believe it myself when it came on my screen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to some other ones that show you who we're serving. &gt;&gt; Then look at God and don't look at a man. God don't want to show me. He wants to show himself. It's he. &gt;&gt; See, you have to know Jesus Christ to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Here's another one. Next paragraph. May you always bear in mind to be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ. Paul said to the church that you are jewels or gems in his crown. And we want to be gems in Jesus Christ's crown. So, how would we go about that? Oh, you got them both up there. We don't want to never put man in it. You forget anything about me. I am your brother, a sinner, saved by grace and not even fit to live. That's exactly the truth. And I ain't saying that to be humble. That's facts. There's nothing in me. Not one sound thing at all. &gt;&gt; Now, if you would trust me to interpret that, Brother Bram's saying, "You don't have to know my name to go in the rapture." &gt;&gt; If you don't, and oh, by the way, that's the seventh seal. And brother Bram said, "If he ever preached anything anointed, &gt;&gt; it was in the seals." &gt;&gt; And if he ever preached anything great to the bride of Christ, it was the seventh seal because he came down and tabernacled inside of his bride. Oh wow. We are so blessed. &gt;&gt; But God hates an arrogant spirit. How many wants to go to the restaurant and see somebody else's kid act like you know you know what I mean? Arrogant, disrespectful, fussing, &gt;&gt; you know, like a bad dog. Everybody likes a dog that obeys, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; God don't like to see kids that way either. I mean, arrogant is the very worst. &gt;&gt; Forget I'm not talking about Miss Just that's not what I want to eat, mother. &gt;&gt; You know, when we used to go to the restaurant, our kids were small. Lan actually ordered for the kids. She never asked the kids what she wanted. They want shrimp, lobster, banana cream pie. &gt;&gt; No, this is what you're getting. See, that's arrogant. &gt;&gt; Next quote. Not me. I ain't the word. &gt;&gt; He's the word. &gt;&gt; See, if I was the word, there's only one person that can be the word. &gt;&gt; That was Jesus. He was God's spoken word by a virgin birth. But the word is of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Watch this. People have tried. The prophets wasn't the word. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; I've heard that the prophet and the word are the same thing. &gt;&gt; No. Thank I'm sure glad we I got a few friends, man. Cuz like like I am actually reading. &gt;&gt; Like I mean if if you believe the other, what are we gonna do with this one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like when I go to a minister's meeting and they bring up something else, they said, "But what are we going to do with these dozen over here?" &gt;&gt; Cuz he said they had to go like this. The prophets wasn't the word, but the word of the Lord came to the prophets. Not that they wasn't the word. The word came to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's let's we're I I know I'm reading a lot of but this is we're really preaching doctrine this morning and it's good for you to see it and the scripture and our prophet. &gt;&gt; Next next quote Vicki and you're doing amazing. The Lord God I do not see why every person should be not healed. &gt;&gt; The Lord Oh Lord, we believe we believe the the messenger the messenger Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The messenger. The messenger is the Holy Ghost. Our decision is made right now and we believe it. Wait a minute. I thought Brother Brham was the messenger. What are we going to do with this quote? &gt;&gt; I don't have no problem with brother Bram being the messenger, but brother Bram said that the messenger is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So like I just need to know what to do with this one. &gt;&gt; Okay, but maybe just hang on because you're going to have to tell me what to do with the next one, too. And the the next quote there, Vicki, I'm I'll go slow because we got to see this. is seeing is believing. And those that raise their hands, may they be partakers of this great Holy Spirit, the messenger of the last day. &gt;&gt; Whoa. What am I Whoa, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What am I going to do with this one also? &gt;&gt; But wait, before you tell me what to do with this one, maybe we go to the next one, too. Oh, you already got it. I'm sorry, Vicki. Man, you're faster than me. The messenger of the Holy Spirit. And the messenger of the Holy Spirit is with the church elected. That's us doing the same things which makes him Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Who is the messenger of this hour? Oh, wait a minute. &gt;&gt; There's a whole bunch of preachers that should read this quote. &gt;&gt; No, man. The Holy Ghost is the messenger of this hour. &gt;&gt; This is actually a 60 almost the end of 62 quote too. I know what you're thinking. Brother Brandham was wrong on that one. I understand. The next quote's a 64 quote. That's after the seals. Okay. I like I I I'll agree with anybody that's like functionable at all. And the same thing he's done today what he did do. He sent us the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is the messenger and the scriptures identify identification of himself identifies him among us the same yesterday, today and forever. And the token is the assurance that we are. Help me out. Second last word. &gt;&gt; What are we scared about? Now, this is after the seals. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what you're thinking. That was like that was a different message. So, let's go to the next one. Like, I got a few of them that you're going to have to clarify with us cuz I don't hear the same message from ministers when I travel. &gt;&gt; What I hear is worship of a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's what I hear. Like it's okay if you want to worship the prophet, but just identify it as worshiping the prophet. That would be the same as you worshiping a good pastor. &gt;&gt; I know many people wouldn't worship me, but if you went to like a really popular big church where there's 500, 700 people. &gt;&gt; This is the feast of the trumpets. This is also 64. It's actually four months later. I wonder if God changed the anointing on his revelation. You know, this is only about a year before he died. &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, that the great messenger among us now, the great Christ, the Holy Spirit. Wow. Wow. You know what it is, brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; There's people deceived. &gt;&gt; They're flat out deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're flat out deceived. I'm not embarrassed to brother Bram. I love Brother Bram, but God, nobody surrendered his life more maybe ever in history other than Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to the leadership of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Than Brother Brown. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he was a vessel of clay used just like the man talking to you today. &gt;&gt; No, no. He surrendered his life more than I did. Oh, for sure he did. &gt;&gt; But he didn't die for your sins. &gt;&gt; No. No. &gt;&gt; It wasn't his message. &gt;&gt; This message I'm preaching to you ain't my message. &gt;&gt; If it is, you're we're all going to hell. &gt;&gt; You see? &gt;&gt; Am I crazy? No. &gt;&gt; See how in every history pass and in every church age and in every following, it said, "If you're not in my group, you're out." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you don't go to my pastor, you're out. If you don't sit under my prophet, you're out. &gt;&gt; And God, Jesus himself called the Sadducees and Pharisees hypocrites. And they were teaching Moses message. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, let's just clarify something. This message that Brother Brown brought is the truth. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm showing you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. 100% the truth. &gt;&gt; And I'm showing it to you. But it's a different message that I hear when I go out and hear these bigname Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like there's two kinds of eternal life. Some have it, some will get it. And brother Bram says flat out there is not. Now, I just I just need to know which one would I believe. &gt;&gt; Which which quotes do we want to throw away? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram, the Holy Spirit said, "If you add to or take away, you'll take your name out of the Lamb's Book of Life." So, I just really don't feel very comfortable taking any of these away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you something else. I don't feel very comfortable having those people come and minister behind this pulpit. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Cuz when I'm sitting there hearing lies in my pulpit, I get really nervous. &gt;&gt; I get to he geebies. &gt;&gt; I'm going, you don't have to worry, brother. You'll never be called back here again. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somewhere we got to end this. Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; I showed you multiple I I've read three scriptures and showed you multiple quotes and I mean very long. I I do believe that our revelation is progressive revelation. &gt;&gt; And I believe Brother Bram's message, God showed him more and more and it progressively got more. &gt;&gt; But when you're at the end of his life, it didn't get progressively more then. &gt;&gt; Like when you're after the seals in 64, that was the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, I tell you what, I'm almost there. I see part three. We we we got we got hope. Just a real short quote here. The New Testament in Ephesians 4:30, that the Holy Ghost is the seal of God and the people in the last day &gt;&gt; onto your eternal destination. this uh I literally have two quotes and just like that we're going to close. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can maybe pull up the next one there, Vicki. But out on the battlefield, he's talking about ministering where I've just returned from over in the heathen lands over here. And I received entertainment of 17 different religions in one afternoon. 17 different religions that denied that there was a Jesus Christ. And when we have twothirds of the world that's never heard of Jesus Christ and what we will do, what are we going to do to sit here and fuss whether we're Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness, go to this church, that church, Louisiana church, Texas church, Ohio church, Michigan church, Toronto church, or Wyoming church. Watch what he says. It's sinful to do so such, friend. It's sinful to do such, friend. It is. And I think twothirds of the world that has never heard the name of Jesus Christ. And out there on the field, and you will never notice whether you'll never notice whether you're a Baptist or Pentecostal or Presbyterian. The one thing that you get them get them from is heathenism to believe in the Lord. See, brother Bram said, he said multiple times, and this ain't in this quote, but he said, "I in no way, shape, or form am trying to form an organization to follow my name, follow me." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm trying to point souls to Christ." &gt;&gt; That's the man of God. Next paragraph. And here at home then, of course, we ain't got no more to do than just be content to fuss and carry on among us believers. But someday we will stop that when the communist gets in and sweeps in here. And we'll be glad to meet our brothers and sisters, regardless whether they're a regardless. Wait a minute. Whoa, wait a minute. They can't be brothers. If they're different, they can't be brothers. &gt;&gt; And you'll be glad to meet your brother. No, no, no. You can't be brothers if they're outside the message. That's not possible. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. And you'll be glad to meet your whether they're Methodist, Baptist, or whatever he is. See, you'll be glad to meet him. That's right. It's a shame God has to do that in that way. But I guess if we won't show it's his way and then he has to force us to do it. &gt;&gt; See we can come the easy way and just accept the truth or God will force us. Last quote as the people here today are trying to say. You know, we have people that struggled if you didn't have communion when it was dark outside. But you know, when it's dark outside here, it's light in the Philippines. And when when it's Sunday here, it's already Monday in the Philippines. &gt;&gt; You see, like in the world, it's different time zones. &gt;&gt; But how's God deal with that? Is God on one time zone around the world, or is he on separate time zones? Let's see what Brother Bram said. as people today trying to say we should wash feet once a year or on Thursday or Friday or take communion or all these different doctrines. &gt;&gt; There's some things God don't care. &gt;&gt; Does it matter to God if it's dark when you take communion or sunlight when it takes communion? &gt;&gt; No. all these different doctrines of and they argue about whether it should be this day or that day or whether it should be on the Sabbath day or the first day of the week and all these things. &gt;&gt; I hope you get that. I really hope I wish. How come it's not underlined Vicki? Oh, next paragraph. Where did my Vicki go? Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Are merely tradition and Oh, sorry. It's there. Sorry, Becky. Right in the bottom half. And all these things are merely tradition. &gt;&gt; And there's lots of message people that will drop the gloves and fight and leave the church. And the prophet said merely tradition. &gt;&gt; Sorry, Vicki. What good would any of it do you whether you had lint or not lint if there was no life in you? It's only a memorial which there's nothing against it but they have to certainly carry out their traditions but left off the main thing. Next paragraph. Thanks Vicki. Amazing. Satan doesn't care how religious you are &gt;&gt; about your traditions &gt;&gt; or how right you are. Oh, &gt;&gt; I'm going to close my iPad on that one. &gt;&gt; God's trying to talk to his real bride. And we're splitting hairs over nothing. And God ain't liking it. &gt;&gt; We're arrogant. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And puffed up. And God's throwing up. He's literally got the flu puking &gt;&gt; at the way his bride is operating. &gt;&gt; Literally. Satan don't care if you're religious or how right you are in your message doctrine. &gt;&gt; I added the message, but he said doctrine. If you miss the life, &gt;&gt; you won't come up, &gt;&gt; church. That's important stuff. &gt;&gt; I just tell you something, church. That's important stuff. Brother Bram said about a half a dozen times, he said, "I'd rather have the wrong doctrine and the right spirit." Now, I actually believe with all of my heart, with every speck of my body, that you can have both. &gt;&gt; But I also believe that most have the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Most &gt;&gt; and you can tell how they preach because they put people out and put people in. &gt;&gt; And that's the wrong spirit. He called them in the scripture. If you don't, if you miss that life, you won't come up anyhow. No matter how religious, how good, and how many churches you belong to or will belong to, it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been &gt;&gt; born again. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I just seen this. This is a disclaimer. This is a 65 quote. You You couldn't read this quote and say, "Brother Brand was going to get more progressive revelation &gt;&gt; than this one right here." Satan don't care that you believe the message. If he can just keep you fighting over when we have communion, &gt;&gt; he's got you. Bless God. Communion is supper time. If you have a different than that, I'm not taking it. &gt;&gt; Maybe you missed the life. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know when you take communion, it's not the body of Christ. It's just a type &gt;&gt; of remembrance. You know, &gt;&gt; we're coming right up to the capstone, perfect love, and all this other chaft is got to blow away. &gt;&gt; Me, too. And I'm seeing stuff that I showed you this morning. And I'm like, wow. God gave us through our prophet the greatest revelation. Well, the revelation came from God, but gave us the greatest insight of taking the seals off the mysteries and showing us the Bible in plain view. And he didn't do that for us to get arrogant. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Wow. Thank you, Jesus. Learning to lean the joy I can't explain. F my soul since the day. Holy Spirit is leading my way and I'm worthy to leave. Burning to burn to Jesus. I need more power than I ever dream. I'm learning to live on Jesus. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Jesus. I am Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat.
