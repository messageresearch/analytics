[7:32] it's it's a very long story but Steve
[7:34] has been in the hospital and he is
[7:36] unresponsive this morning. So Kathy's
[7:39] ask them for prayer and you know we pray
[7:42] for their souls that's what's important.
[7:44] Amen.
[7:46] You know, like this song we sang, we

[8:24] give us a prayer request. She said,
[8:25] "Please pray for my daughter and her
[8:27] husband. She has served him with
[8:29] separation papers and he doesn't want
[8:32] any part of this to part." and I got a
[8:36] chance to talk to him about trusting
[8:38] God, Sister Patty. So, a huge huge
[8:43] prayer request there. Amen. You know,
[8:45] and and we're all ministers. Don't
[8:47] forget that we're all ministers.
[8:50] Don't lift, you know, I I don't we we
[8:53] just have this amazing message, but it's
[8:56] to lift up Christ or everyone, not an
[8:59] individual. Sister Patty can minister to
[9:02] that brother, and I I might never see
[9:04] his face.
[9:06] might never see his face. Different
[9:07] situation. God God knows him. Also,
[9:10] let's just remember Sister Joanie. We we
[9:13] were at uh Brother John Garrett's uh uh
[9:15] thing and and Sister Joan and Sister
[9:17] Donna were over there and and she was
[9:19] just having some little struggles. You
[9:22] know, she had she had stumbled and fell
[9:24] in her room and uh and then she actually
[9:27] stumbled there. So, we just pray that
[9:29] that she's all right. We love them
[9:31] dearly and those sisters love the word.
[9:34] Wow. When you minister, they're just
[9:39] and we love them dearly. And and just
[9:41] just remember sister John. I'm going to
[9:42] ask brother G. Brother G, you can you're
[9:45] welcome to come up here or pray there. I
[9:47] I know you're welcome to come and pray.
[9:49] Take these needs. I know brother Gar
[9:52] sers. We're looking for healing from
[9:53] brother Gar's eyes. I'll give you a hand
[9:55] if you want. Okay. Okay.
[10:06] Let's bow our heads.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, we thank you for
[10:11] the privilege of serving you, Lord. And
[10:14] we thank you as we near to the end.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; We're going from an intellectual
[10:19] conception of who you are and who we
[10:23] are.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. and we're going into a revelated
[10:27] revelation of who you are
[10:30] &gt;&gt; and who we are. You're preparing us for
[10:34] the rapture, Lord. And you're bringing
[10:36] us into a that intimate relationship
[10:40] with you, Lord. You've given us a spirit
[10:42] of adoption where we can cry, "Aba,
[10:44] Father."
[10:45] &gt;&gt; And we welcome your presence in here
[10:47] this morning, Lord. For you said, "We're
[10:49] two or three are gathered together in
[10:52] your name. You'll be in the midst of
[10:54] us." We're claiming that. We're counting
[10:56] on it. You're a God. As Abraham counted
[10:59] on you to to per to perform your word,
[11:03] we're counting on you, Lord. And you see
[11:05] these precious people that are having
[11:08] these problems, Lord. The Steve fell,
[11:11] Lord. I pray that your spirit will go
[11:14] forth and awaken him for a time, Lord.
[11:17] that he can accept you as his personal
[11:20] savior and prepare his heart to make
[11:23] heaven his home. Lord, I pray that even
[11:25] in this moment, he opens up his eyes,
[11:28] Lord, and you can show him the way,
[11:31] Lord. Amen.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; You see, uh Patty's daughter, Lord, we
[11:35] she's uh served uh divorce papers, Lord,
[11:39] and we know according to your word, you
[11:42] hate divorce, Lord. I pray that your
[11:45] spirit will go forth in that situation
[11:48] and bring love, bring understanding,
[11:52] Lord Jesus, and bring revelation that
[11:55] it's you are the problem solver. It's
[11:58] your love, not our carnal love, Lord. We
[12:00] pray that you'll bring peace. I call for
[12:03] peace in that family in Jesus' name.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. Hallelujah. And you see our
[12:08] dear sister Joanie, Lord, she's said
[12:11] before that she's had uh faith when she
[12:14] was younger and now it seems to have
[12:18] waned. Lord, I pray that you'll raise
[12:20] her faith up that her eyes can be
[12:22] healed. Lord Jesus, I pray God that
[12:25] she'll reach out and claim her healing
[12:28] and the scripture that says by his
[12:30] stripes we are healed.
[12:33] for those that are on the internet,
[12:35] Lord, whatever uh problem they might
[12:37] have or whatever uh situation they're
[12:40] in, whatever they have need of, Lord, I
[12:43] pray that they'll feel the presence of
[12:45] the Holy Ghost on the other side of the
[12:47] internet. Lord Jesus, bless your people,
[12:50] Lord. I pray that you'll bless our
[12:52] pastor here, that you'll anoint them.
[12:54] Your word says that out of their bellies
[12:57] shall flow rivers of living water. May
[13:00] our brothers step aside and let you use
[13:02] him and speak through him and give us
[13:06] your your people, Lord, ears to hear and
[13:09] receive a heart to receive the word that
[13:11] goes forth in Jesus Christ's holy name
[13:14] we pray.

[20:26] share a testimony and just tell you, you
[20:29] know, publicly. Um there's there's no
[20:32] problem with time, Sister Ruth. It's a
[20:34] it's a fantastic testimony how God and
[20:38] we we we love and adore your family very
[20:42] much. And you know, sometimes when
[20:44] people are going through something, we
[20:46] don't know the story.
[20:49] And and so Satan puts thoughts in our
[20:52] head. Well, and you know that's of the
[20:57] devil. It's just a root for any of those
[20:59] thoughts I had. I'm sorry. And even not
[21:02] praying as much as I should. Sometimes
[21:05] people are going through a mountain of a
[21:08] trial
[21:10] and we just are like
[21:12] and and it's just beautiful how God's So
[21:15] we ask Sister Ruth to come.
[21:54] God bless you all.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; I don't even know where to start. I'm
[22:01] literally trembling.

[22:08] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[22:11] Bless your heart.
[22:14] Thank you, Jesus.
[22:20] Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[22:24] [Music]
[22:27] Thank you, Jesus.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; So, um,
[22:36] four Sundays ago, that was August the
[22:39] 24th,
[22:42] um,
[22:46] Brother Dale wanted to sing the song,
[22:48] Till the Storm Passes Over.
[22:52] Those of you who were here, you will
[22:54] remember that
[22:56] um
[22:58] after the service, I texted Brother Dale
[23:01] and I told him that that song was for me
[23:07] and um I'm just going to
[23:10] actually read the text message.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:19] God bless you, brother Dale. I just
[23:22] wanted to say that that song till the
[23:24] storm passes over was specifically for
[23:27] me.
[23:29] I am in a health battle right now which
[23:32] I cannot say much about at this time
[23:36] because the Lord instructed me to hold
[23:39] my peace and not say anything.
[23:42] [Music]
[23:45] The Lord has been sending me a
[23:47] particular scripture about nine times
[23:50] since October of last year
[23:53] and he is taking me through this storm.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; And he is confirming his promise and
[24:00] therefore I am testifying of this to his
[24:04] glory.
[24:06] So that's that was my text message to
[24:08] brother Dale.
[24:10] And then I g I sent brother Dale a
[24:12] sample of the scriptures that the Lord
[24:15] had been sending to me which I had
[24:17] received about nine times up to that
[24:20] point.
[24:22] Um so brother Dale responded
[24:26] and he says, "Praise God for this
[24:28] wonderful testimony and the scriptures.
[24:31] [Music]
[24:33] God gave me that song last week. So that
[24:36] means he gave him that song the previous
[24:38] week. But that day, August 24th, he felt
[24:42] led to sing it.
[24:45] He said, "I'm very sorry for not praying
[24:47] more, but I will be praying for you and
[24:50] your miracle."
[24:53] Then I responded back to Brother Dale
[24:55] and I said,
[24:58] "That just shows how perfect God is. He
[25:01] knew we wouldn't be in service the
[25:04] Sunday that God gave him that song
[25:07] and he planned it for August 24th when I
[25:11] was here. And if you remember
[25:14] [Music]
[25:16] the devil tried to make it not happen
[25:18] cuz Vicki could not find the words for
[25:21] some time of that song.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:25] And eventually Vicki found the words.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; So God's purpose can never fail.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Um,
[25:45] so
[25:46] two centuries ago, I could not fit into
[25:48] this outfit I'm wearing today
[25:52] because I had a tumor.
[25:55] And that tumor
[25:58] was this big.
[26:00] Wow.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; On my left breast, the hand that I'm
[26:04] holding up right now.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[26:10] I was here last Sunday,
[26:13] but not a single person here knew that I
[26:16] went through surgery the Friday before
[26:20] &gt;&gt; to get that tumor out.
[26:23] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; On August the 12th,
[26:30] my doctor called me
[26:33] and she told me I had breast cancer.
[26:39] [Music]
[26:44] Exactly a month after, which was last
[26:47] Friday, is when I had the surgery to
[26:50] take it out.
[26:52] And as I stand here before you, I am
[26:56] 100% healed.
[27:08] Praise you, Jesus.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; My mom is sitting here in this audience
[27:13] today,
[27:16] and this is the first time she's hearing
[27:20] of that diagnosis.
[27:22] Nobody except my husband knew.
[27:27] And because the Lord instructed me to
[27:30] keep still and hold my peace, I obeyed
[27:34] that. I didn't tell a single soul
[27:37] and he had a reason for that.
[27:40] [Music]
[27:43] &gt;&gt; So why did I have to go through that?
[27:46] What was the purpose of God allowing me
[27:50] to go through that experience?
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Because he loves me.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; And because he loves you.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, hallelujah.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; God
[28:06] told us
[28:09] &gt;&gt; we present our bodies as a living
[28:12] sacrifice.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; And he chose my body.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; To bear a cancer.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; So that through this testimony, somebody
[28:27] even if it's one person
[28:30] &gt;&gt; can be helped.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:33] Lord, thank you Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[28:38] [Music]
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:45] [Music]
[28:47] On Monday, this past Monday,
[28:50] I had to go to get the drain taken out
[28:54] of my chest.
[28:58] Um, so just to back up a bit, I had the
[29:02] surgery on the Friday,
[29:05] Monday morning, just to show you the
[29:07] grace of God Almighty,
[29:10] I went to work and I drove the bus and I
[29:14] picked up students and dropped them to
[29:16] school. No pain, no problems whatsoever.
[29:28] So, I usually go in the morning, I pick
[29:30] up the children, I take them to school,
[29:32] then I have a a break in between and I
[29:34] go back at 3:00 to pick them from school
[29:36] and take them home.
[29:39] So, during that break, I had an
[29:41] appointment at 1:00 to take the drain
[29:43] out.
[29:47] When I went to the clinic, the nurse
[29:49] tried to remove the the the tubing,
[29:54] but the pain was excruciating.
[29:58] It was
[30:00] the best way I can describe it
[30:03] was like putting a fish hook
[30:06] &gt;&gt; under your rib and pulling it with with
[30:10] every force possible. That was the most
[30:15] painful experience.
[30:17] [Music]
[30:24] [Music]
[30:26] So I didn't go back to work that
[30:28] afternoon.
[30:30] But when I came back, I could hardly
[30:32] drive home. The clinic is only 30
[30:35] seconds away from my house.
[30:38] And
[30:40] by the grace of God, I made it home.
[30:44] And as I lay down in my bed,
[30:49] [Music]
[30:50] the Lord
[30:55] asked me,
[30:58] "How many stripes did the Lord receive
[31:01] on his back?"
[31:04] I said, "39.
[31:09] And they used a Roman whip
[31:13] which had
[31:16] several prongs or several strings
[31:20] and it had metal balls and bones and a
[31:23] hook at the end of each.
[31:26] And that's what they whipped him on his
[31:29] back 40 times or 39 times
[31:34] for our sake.
[31:36] Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; He said that pain you experience is just
[31:41] a small snippet of what he went through.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; And he had no sin.
[31:51] He had no nothing that he did that he
[31:54] deserved
[31:56] &gt;&gt; to go through that.
[31:59] That's right. That's right. And the Lord
[32:01] allowed me
[32:03] to experience just a little bit of that
[32:07] pain to know what our Lord went through
[32:11] because he loves us.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:16] [Music]
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Wow. So the main reason why he put me
[32:24] through this experience
[32:27] is because we have too much cancer in
[32:29] the body of Christ.
[32:32] [Music]
[32:40] God knows that I I dread every second of
[32:43] me standing here to say these words
[32:47] cuz I feel like I'm like I'm a preacher
[32:51] like brother Dale.
[32:54] I'm not preaching to you, but at the
[32:58] same time, I am. Brother Dale just says
[33:01] we are all ministers.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; We're all witnesses.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; And our lives preach the gospel and our
[33:09] testimonies preach the gospel.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm here doing.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; He says there's so much cancer in the
[33:19] body of Christ
[33:22] and he wants to cut it out.
[33:25] Amen.
[33:27] [Music]
[33:32] &gt;&gt; We have a church only 7 minutes away
[33:34] from here.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; We can't fellowship together.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; We can't sit down and have a meal
[33:41] together. Our children are deprived from
[33:45] playing together.
[33:48] [Music]
[33:51] &gt;&gt; 7 minutes away from here.
[33:54] And we have to live like that.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; And each one of us is claiming that we
[34:00] have the love of Christ in our hearts.
[34:03] [Music]
[34:04] We're all singing that when when we all
[34:06] go to heaven
[34:08] &gt;&gt; which heaven when we can't even sit
[34:12] together.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. here on earth.
[34:15] [Music]
[34:19] &gt;&gt; There's so much discord, so much
[34:22] indifference,
[34:24] &gt;&gt; so many cold hearts,
[34:27] &gt;&gt; so much fearless.
[34:29] [Music]
[34:32] &gt;&gt; There's people in this congregation that
[34:34] won't lift their little finger to go and
[34:38] say, "God bless you" to somebody.
[34:43] They'll turn your face away from you.
[34:45] They won't greet you. They won't hug you
[34:52] &gt;&gt; because Satan has put a cancer in their
[34:54] hearts.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody hurt them.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And they've built a wall
[35:02] [Music]
[35:06] &gt;&gt; trying to protect themselves,
[35:08] &gt;&gt; but you're killing yourself instead.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's right.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; And killing everybody else around.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] [Music]
[35:23] &gt;&gt; There are people who have left this
[35:24] church
[35:26] because of cancer.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Spiritual cancer.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; There's people who are sitting at home
[35:33] right now not going to service
[35:36] &gt;&gt; because of spiritual cancer.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] [Music]
[35:45] and we're clinging to it
[35:48] [Music]
[35:49] and it's killing us and God is saying
[35:54] get drop it.
[35:58] [Music]
[36:03] Some people are so bitter. Some people
[36:05] are so unforgiving.
[36:09] Some people are so arrogant.
[36:13] [Music]
[36:18] God wants to take it out.
[36:27] Anytime
[36:30] [Music]
[36:33] you go for surgery,
[36:36] the surgeon cannot do a single thing
[36:38] unless you sign a consent form.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; And today, God is asking us for our
[36:49] consent
[36:51] &gt;&gt; for him to do the surgery that we need
[36:54] &gt;&gt; to survive. If I didn't sign the
[36:57] consent,
[36:58] I might as well have just
[37:02] &gt;&gt; accepted the death sentence.
[37:05] [Music]
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus name.
[37:15] [Music]
[37:16] Every song that was sung here today
[37:19] [Music]
[37:20] is a testimony.
[37:23] It is no secret what God can do.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:28] [Music]
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[37:33] Praise you, Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Nothing between
[37:37] my soul and the savior.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] Jesus
[37:42] &gt;&gt; in the cross
[37:45] be my glory ever.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] I just gave you a little snapshot of
[37:53] what my cross looks like.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to give the glory to God.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[38:09] Hallelujah.
[38:11] He told us to pick up our cross and
[38:14] follow him
[38:17] because that's the only way
[38:20] he gets the glory.
[38:23] [Music]
[38:31] Just in case anyone has any doubts of
[38:34] what I just spoke about, here are the
[38:37] medical reports
[38:39] of what I just told you.
[38:42] The biopsy,
[38:45] the surgery report from the surgeon.
[38:49] Another biopsy report.
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Praise you, Jesus. Jesus.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus has a trophy of his power.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; And I give him all the praise.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; The honor.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And the glory.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:13] I pray
[39:16] that after this testimony,
[39:19] somebody
[39:22] will give the Lord consent.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; To do surgery
[39:27] because that's what this is all about.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you and God bless you.
[39:35] [Applause]
[39:46] Amen.
[39:48] That would be a a great video to post
[39:51] the time on for other people to see the
[39:53] testimony
[39:58] of what God can do. Amen. You know, that
[40:02] was just
[40:04] beautiful. Perfect. God is alive and
[40:08] well and and he's right here in our
[40:11] midst, you know. It's just so He's
[40:15] everywhere. Like Sister Ruth said about
[40:16] the song and and just her healing just
[40:22] Let's sing one song before we minister.
[40:25] Surely the presence of the Lord is in
[40:28] this place.
[40:30] Surely
[40:34] the presence of the Lord is in this
[40:39] place.
[40:41] I can feel his mighty power and his
[40:46] grace.
[40:48] [Music]

[42:32] Lord Jesus.
[42:36] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[42:39] To think that
[42:41] we are so small
[42:44] and you are so amazing, so awesome,
[42:49] obnot.
[42:50] [Music]
[42:56] And you never left us
[42:59] for a moment.
[43:01] [Music]
[43:02] That in itself is amazing.
[43:06] Lord Jesus, wow.
[43:10] Thank you for Sister Ruth and her
[43:13] testimony.
[43:15] Forgive me, Jesus,
[43:20] for my sins.
[43:21] [Music]

[43:34] [Music]
[43:37] Wow.
[43:39] We sure love you, Jesus.
[43:42] Amen.
[43:48] [Music]
[44:01] Amen.
[44:03] We're going to read a scripture. Thank
[44:04] you, honey.
[44:07] Romans 5
[44:09] verse 8
[44:15] just in case there was somebody present
[44:18] that didn't think God was still alive or
[44:21] real or he only gathered in big places.
[44:27] I'm gonna preach on love.
[44:30] And God gave that to me yesterday or
[44:33] Friday, sorry, f Friday evening late.
[44:36] And I put it in my notepad
[44:39] yesterday morning when the girls went
[44:41] shopping before John Garrett's.
[44:45] And God, but God commanded his love
[44:50] toward us
[44:52] in that while we were yet sinners,
[44:57] Christ died
[45:00] for us.
[45:02] Lord Jesus, you are just amazing
[45:06] and we love you. And I pray somehow that
[45:10] you'll show me and show your people who
[45:14] you are. In your name we pray. Amen.
[45:19] Amen. You may have your seats.
[45:24] We serve
[45:26] an amazing God. You know,
[45:29] Sister Ruth, I again thank you for the
[45:31] testimony. That was
[45:33] just very, very beautiful. You know,
[45:37] God is concerned.
[45:40] Not brother Dale. I'm not concerned. I
[45:42] mean, only because God is, but
[45:45] and and you know, I'm going to read some
[45:48] things that the prophet said, and I'm
[45:50] going to tell you ahead of time. They're
[45:52] directly connected to the message hub.
[45:57] They're Oh, I sorry. They're directly
[46:00] connected to the message hub, to the
[46:03] verse that we're reading.
[46:07] That's directly what the prophet said
[46:10] about the scripture. Now, there's
[46:12] another scripture. I'm going to read
[46:13] some to it. So, it's how the prophet
[46:17] broke down
[46:19] God.
[46:21] And you know, when we were away at
[46:23] brother John Garrett's, you know, we
[46:26] seen many people, many many people we
[46:28] didn't know. Many people I I didn't
[46:30] know. And that was wonderful.
[46:32] But God's concerned and and I don't I
[46:37] don't know how to explain. I mean, the
[46:38] prophet's going to uh minister today
[46:41] when we read his quotes,
[46:46] but
[46:49] God is love.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; God is love. And you can't make other
[46:55] people's decisions,
[46:57] but you can love them so much
[47:00] that they the Bible says that you will
[47:02] heat coals of fire on their head that
[47:03] they will lose their mind because they
[47:05] don't understand your love.
[47:09] cuz it's not flesh love.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; It's agape love.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And God is a jealous God in the part
[47:19] that
[47:21] God commands all of our love
[47:26] &gt;&gt; and and uh you know it's just
[47:30] where did I put that?
[47:35] Sorry, I covered something up. But you
[47:38] know,
[47:40] and and and I I don't know how to
[47:41] preach. And I tell you what, Lanne asked
[47:44] me, she said, "Did you she asked me
[47:47] something about my message, and she
[47:48] said, "God, give me" and I told her, we
[47:50] were catching the elevator to go to
[47:52] Johnson. I said, "God, give me two." So
[47:55] when Sister Ruth texted me this morning,
[47:56] I said, "Oh, everything's good. God
[47:59] knows everything. You know,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; we're going to preach next Sunday in
[48:04] advance on love.
[48:06] But you know
[48:08] we
[48:10] I if it's not we then it's I
[48:15] I should be careful not to elevate
[48:20] anybody. Like God's no respector
[48:24] &gt;&gt; of person. So watch how my I I'm trying
[48:29] to make this personal. Watch how my
[48:33] speech is. See, we betray oursel in our
[48:36] speech. Now watch what I mean by that.
[48:39] You know, see, God is omnipotent. So
[48:42] he's everywhere.
[48:44] And the very definition of God is love.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Not cheap love,
[48:52] genuine love. Love that it, Brother
[48:55] Brham said, it was not the nails that
[48:56] held them on the cross. It was not the
[48:59] Romans had very little to do with it. It
[49:02] was love.
[49:05] It was love.
[49:09] But I believe God sent the greatest
[49:11] Well, we know. I don't just believe it.
[49:13] I believe it. And I know that God sent
[49:16] the greatest message ever to hit the
[49:19] earth.
[49:21] That was himself in this day.
[49:24] God himself came down. But you got to
[49:27] remember God's a spirit.
[49:30] And
[49:33] and we're gonna if if we don't get it
[49:36] today, I promise we'll get it next
[49:37] Sunday. I'm going to show you. But I'm
[49:38] going to going to jump ahead what God's
[49:40] seen. This is what God's seeing. You
[49:42] know, we got there early to the party
[49:44] and and I and this is not this is
[49:47] somebody you don't know. Probably
[49:48] probably most of you've never seen him.
[49:49] somebody come up to me and they were
[49:50] telling me about their church and they
[49:53] said, "Well, somebody's coming from so
[49:54] and so area like 25 hours away and and I
[49:59] I I want you to see how God heard that."
[50:01] They were elevating.
[50:05] You see what I mean? They weren't saying
[50:07] they came to God. And we have to be
[50:10] careful that we don't elevate our
[50:12] pastor,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; the ministry, our church. Wyoming is
[50:17] nothing. It's a dot on the map.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Ants could walk over top of it. Okay?
[50:22] But any place like, see, God uses every
[50:27] place and person.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; But because we're in a tabernacle of
[50:32] clay, we see. Now, this is scripture. I
[50:36] want you to watch this. In Revelations,
[50:38] John fell down to to worship the servant
[50:40] twice.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Now, that scripture is not on my notes,
[50:44] but watch what the servant told John. He
[50:47] said, "I worship God.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; I am your fellow
[50:55] brother."
[51:00] &gt;&gt; The greatest mockery to the greatest
[51:03] truth in the world is worship of a
[51:06] prophet.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet never believed in that
[51:09] himself. It's love. God uses Sister Ruth
[51:15] was right this morning. Sister Potty
[51:17] ministered to her son-in-law. Everybody
[51:20] has Did I'm doing something wrong.
[51:23] Oh, everybody has a ministry.
[51:27] We have got so tied up and and and uh
[51:35] the prophet says this. Can I just say it
[51:37] ahead of time because brother
[51:39] &gt;&gt; D,
[51:40] &gt;&gt; God is love. And we got so tied up in
[51:43] law.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. and law like like though God
[51:48] didn't there's a purpose to law
[51:51] &gt;&gt; but God is not confined by law
[51:56] &gt;&gt; receives that
[51:58] &gt;&gt; there's a purpose to law I believe in
[52:00] holiness I believe there's things
[52:02] Christians should do but God is not
[52:04] confined
[52:07] &gt;&gt; to holiness God's not confi God is God
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen.
[52:15] So, you see how
[52:17] I I'm I'm not I'm I'm I'm going to get
[52:19] off this subject, but I want to show you
[52:21] how God is a jealous God and he just
[52:24] wants our love. We should be witnessing
[52:26] about God, Jesus Christ.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Don't tell them. I mean, maybe I mean,
[52:33] you know, I believe in church. I I do
[52:35] believe in church, but it's not about
[52:37] the church. It's about God. Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; It's not about in my doctrine or your
[52:43] doctrine or even the it's about God.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; God did some, you know, we've been
[52:48] preaching on compassion. God did some
[52:50] peculiar things in the Bible.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; The Good Samaritan is out of the book of
[52:55] the Bible.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; That Good Samaritan was a pagan by
[53:01] religion.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And God said he had eternal life. Yeah,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; that's hard for brother Dale to
[53:08] comprehend, but God's working on me. You
[53:11] know, so God God came God so loved the
[53:14] world that he came he gave his only
[53:16] begotten son that whosoever believeth on
[53:19] him should not perish but have
[53:21] everlasting life. That's John 3:16.
[53:24] We all know that scripture by heart. You
[53:27] know the prophet, and I'm going to
[53:28] probably get into that more next week,
[53:30] he commented on that hundreds of times,
[53:33] that verse. hundreds with an S.
[53:37] You know, somebody else that was these
[53:39] are all believers I'm telling you about.
[53:40] I'm not telling you this down because
[53:42] I'm guilty of this. You know, somebody
[53:44] else said they were we were talking
[53:46] about somebody that had ministered in
[53:48] Ontario and it was really good. It was
[53:50] it was for the young people and it was
[53:52] really good. And another believer was
[53:54] there and he said, "Well, you know who
[53:55] ordained him?"
[53:58] And I'm like,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; "Yeah." After I left that, I said,
[54:02] "Well, who cares who'd ordained them?"
[54:04] Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; God ordained them before the foundation
[54:06] of the world. As if the organization
[54:09] made the person a great man
[54:11] &gt;&gt; and he delivered a great message 25
[54:13] years later.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; It had nothing to do with nothing.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; It had absolutely zero.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; It's not who prays for you.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; If you want to get healed, have the
[54:27] youngest child in this church pray for
[54:29] you. have Girius pray for you. You'll be
[54:33] because they just have something that us
[54:36] old people
[54:37] &gt;&gt; have a hard time grabbing. It's just
[54:40] blind open faith.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; They have very little fear. We have to
[54:46] teach them to be afraid.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Children are not born with the fear of
[54:52] walking in front of semis and cars and
[54:54] walking off the cliffs. It's fear. Yeah,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; but there's no love.
[54:59] There's no fear in love.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing the God we serve.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And that same place, this all happened
[55:08] within about one hour. Another believer
[55:11] or some of these were different, some of
[55:13] them were the same. Some come up and
[55:14] they said, you know, I seen something
[55:16] online like it was across the continent
[55:20] and they said, you know, you you really
[55:22] need to listen to it cuz the man died
[55:24] two weeks later.
[55:26] And I'm like, we preach the message.
[55:28] Does this does
[55:30] &gt;&gt; have to use the internet?
[55:33] &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? You see,
[55:36] &gt;&gt; church, I'm not God.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I know you already know that cuz you
[55:41] know me too well. Most of you know me
[55:43] when I was young and non-converted, even
[55:46] if I said I was.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; But nobody else is God. And yet, we're
[55:52] all God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:02] Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Let's read Romans 5 1 to 8. I just read
[56:08] verse eight and I want to read some
[56:10] things just and and I want to finish and
[56:13] I'm going to preach next week, but I
[56:15] want one of these quotes to really sink
[56:17] in. And this is whole thing is love.
[56:22] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[56:24] have peace with God through our Lord
[56:25] Jesus Christ, by whom also we have
[56:30] access by faith unto his grace, wherein
[56:34] we stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[56:37] glory of God. And not only so, but we
[56:42] glory in tribulations. Now, Sister Ruth
[56:45] was testifying about that.
[56:48] God used our sister as an example.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And if you don't think God's God, I was
[56:56] in Indiana
[56:59] at the Marriott Motel when he when I
[57:02] printed out these scriptures and loving
[57:04] these quotes.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And what was sister Ruth talking about
[57:09] this morning? The testimony. You can't
[57:10] make this stuff up, church.
[57:14] Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; But we glory in the tribulations also,
[57:18] knowing the tribulation workketh
[57:21] patience.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And patience experience and experience
[57:26] hope. And hope maketh not ashamed
[57:29] because the love of God is shed abroad
[57:32] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[57:35] given unto us.
[57:39] For when we were yet
[57:42] without strength, in due time, Christ
[57:44] died for the ungodly.
[57:48] You could just change that to brother
[57:49] Dale.
[57:51] When I was yet without brains or
[57:53] strength,
[57:55] God died for me.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; For sincerely for a righteous man, for
[58:02] scarcely, sorry, will a righteous man
[58:06] will one die. Yet pre- Avenger for a
[58:10] good man some would even dare to die.
[58:14] But God commanded that's a that's God
[58:18] dictating himself
[58:21] &gt;&gt; commanded his love towards us in that
[58:25] while we were yet sinners
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Christ died for us.
[58:35] Wow.
[58:37] You know,
[58:39] we have to be so careful in our walk.
[58:43] Satan is a liar. I mean, he is the
[58:46] biggest liar in the world.
[58:50] I mean, this I know you know that. But
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Sister Ruth, I want to share something
[58:56] with you.
[59:00] I want to show you life.
[59:03] We just had our camp just a few weeks
[59:06] ago
[59:08] and before camp meeting I asked Sister
[59:10] Ruth if she would be would she take care
[59:13] of taking the pictures
[59:15] and Sister Ruth said well I'll get back
[59:17] to you. I'm I'm not sure if I want to be
[59:21] I'm not sure like some it was a very
[59:23] nice answer but
[59:26] and you know Satan would tell me one
[59:27] thing you know what he told me and
[59:30] Sister Ruth's going through the biggest
[59:31] mountain of her life
[59:38] &gt;&gt; you know what Satan would tell me well
[59:40] sister Ruth don't want to be a part she
[59:41] don't want to help. She don't want this.
[59:43] Oh, you just on and on and on and on.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to that
[59:53] garbage.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; When he started telling me that, I
[59:58] should have just hung up the phone,
[1:00:00] connected to him. You see what I mean?
[1:00:06] Every one of you sitting here, if you're
[1:00:08] breathing, you've experienced that
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; because you didn't know what God knew.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Sister Ruth, for even Satan
[1:00:18] just allowing him to tell me that in my
[1:00:20] ear.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:00:26] What a
[1:00:28] And so because Satan would tell me that,
[1:00:30] then I would think, "Oh, Sister Roose
[1:00:34] pulling away or she's drawn."
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You know that's the truth.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And you know that's happened to you too,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[1:00:55] Let's look at some things the prophet
[1:00:56] said.
[1:01:00] You could put these starting at this top
[1:01:02] one. Now these first few are connected
[1:01:06] to verse five,
[1:01:08] not verse eight. Verse five. But I tell
[1:01:10] you a very good thing to preach on is
[1:01:12] little children love one another. As I
[1:01:15] get older in the ministry, about my 21st
[1:01:18] year in the ministry, I think the time
[1:01:21] as I go along for this, the more that I
[1:01:24] think of the Lord Jesus, the more I
[1:01:26] begin to find out that it's love
[1:01:30] that covers the whole thing.
[1:01:35] The love of God is shed abroad in our
[1:01:37] heart by by the Holy Spirit. Not by the
[1:01:42] minister, not by your creeds or dogmas,
[1:01:47] not by the message, not by the seven
[1:01:51] seals, but by the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Now, your prophet said these things. He
[1:01:58] said, "Look at a person's spirit."
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Look if he's trying to do what's
[1:02:03] right for God. God don't bring them. The
[1:02:06] message is the truth. I'm not I'm saying
[1:02:08] but look at the spirit.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; The message is God.
[1:02:14] But let God bring the people to God.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Watch the next one connected to he said,
[1:02:20] "Brethren, we have withdraw little
[1:02:23] circles." Sister Ruth talked about this.
[1:02:26] Now, Sister Ruth, she texted me this
[1:02:28] morning at 6 something this morning. I
[1:02:30] got the text at 8:00.
[1:02:33] She don't know what I'm preaching. And
[1:02:35] and and not only that, I want I want to
[1:02:37] clarify because I want to give Satan a
[1:02:38] black eye. I didn't look for these
[1:02:40] quotes. I went to the message hub and
[1:02:43] they're related to verse six of Romans 8
[1:02:46] or verse 5, sorry. So, I didn't even
[1:02:49] like cherrypick these. These are on the
[1:02:52] message hub.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Directly to the scripture we read. We've
[1:02:57] drawn circles of laws
[1:03:00] and different things and we still never
[1:03:03] come to the real kernel. It's Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ.
[1:03:08] The love of God
[1:03:10] wants us to see. What a pity.
[1:03:14] Love is the greatest, most powerful
[1:03:16] weapon and this world has ever seen and
[1:03:19] known of. And it's dying for love. The
[1:03:22] church is perishing for love. Love. God,
[1:03:25] waters of grace are flowing one to
[1:03:29] another when confidence is restored and
[1:03:32] justice is restored between us. The love
[1:03:34] that God shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:03:37] the denomination. Something sounded
[1:03:39] wrong there,
[1:03:41] didn't it? It's the love of God shed
[1:03:44] abroad in the heart by the
[1:03:47] Holy Spirit.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; God is love to us.
[1:03:57] Still verse five connected to verse five
[1:03:59] the Hebrew series. Now the church cannot
[1:04:02] be perfect through organizations or the
[1:04:05] message any any kind of an organization
[1:04:07] even even in the message organization.
[1:04:10] The church cannot watch how because he
[1:04:11] deals with this
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; in the next chapter. It gets further
[1:04:16] away from God all the time.
[1:04:20] Brother Brham said we read this last
[1:04:22] time in canones. He said, "If you
[1:04:24] believe that you got it and nobody else
[1:04:27] has got it that's on the outside, you're
[1:04:29] a denominational spirit
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; cuz you build a wall around it. We've
[1:04:34] got the truth and they don't."
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; That's what your prophet said.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; That's what your prophet said. Now, we
[1:04:42] know this is the truth, but don't say
[1:04:44] they don't have it.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz watch this.
[1:04:51] He said it gets away from God all the
[1:04:54] time or farther away from each other. We
[1:04:58] draw barriers and we separate oursel.
[1:05:01] This is talking about messaged people.
[1:05:03] Watch this. This this message is love
[1:05:05] that he's preaching. So if we were in
[1:05:07] the message church and say, "Well, we
[1:05:08] got to church and everybody else is
[1:05:10] going to hell."
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; That that's not that's that's not what
[1:05:13] the prophet preached.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; We're the only ones that are going to be
[1:05:17] in heaven, the message believers.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Everybody else is going to hell. That's
[1:05:20] not what the prophet preached.
[1:05:23] My daddy never came to this message
[1:05:25] church, but my daddy will be waiting for
[1:05:26] me at the pearly gates.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you. Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't think of that, I am in part
[1:05:36] next to the Lord Jesus is because of my
[1:05:39] daddy. Yeah.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; He said we draw barriers and separate
[1:05:46] oursel seemingly not having the faith.
[1:05:50] Now we've done that with denominational
[1:05:52] but we've like sister brought up we've
[1:05:54] done it even inside the message
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; seemingly not. But when we leave these
[1:06:03] principles of doctrines, what would most
[1:06:06] people separate in the message about the
[1:06:10] principle of doctrine? They say, "Well,
[1:06:11] bless God. The prophet said this is the
[1:06:13] doctrine of truth."
[1:06:15] When we leave these principles of
[1:06:17] doctrine and we move on into,
[1:06:20] wait a minute, he said when we move on
[1:06:23] into perfection, then these little
[1:06:25] things become not so much use. Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; He's saying the principles of doctrines
[1:06:32] of the message that we would build
[1:06:35] separate camps when we get into love,
[1:06:39] when we get into the capstone love,
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; they'll take a second seat.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz watch what he says in the next
[1:06:48] paragraph. For we go into a relationship
[1:06:51] and we find out that the only way that
[1:06:53] we can get to perfect perfect it is to
[1:06:56] be in Christ. And we find out that when
[1:06:58] by the teachings of the Bible and how we
[1:07:00] get into Christ, not by water baptism.
[1:07:03] Now wait a minute now. That's Bible.
[1:07:08] I believe in water baptism.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I believe in but he says we don't come
[1:07:12] into the perfection of Christ by water
[1:07:14] baptism. Not on laying on of hands and
[1:07:17] watch this next one.
[1:07:20] And not by teaching the message.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; You do not come in perfection. You can
[1:07:25] memorize these messages. You can read
[1:07:28] books upside down 24 hours a day and
[1:07:30] memorize and know the quotes like um
[1:07:33] accordion book.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; That won't make you perfection.
[1:07:40] Is this okay?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; This this is our prophet. We believe he
[1:07:44] is the man of God.
[1:07:50] Not by teaching, but by one spirit are
[1:07:53] we all baptized into one body and become
[1:07:56] perfect through his suffering. And when
[1:08:00] we look at difference, we think
[1:08:02] different and we act different, we live
[1:08:04] different, not because it's our duty or
[1:08:06] we belong to a church, but because of
[1:08:10] love.
[1:08:11] God shed abroad the love into our hearts
[1:08:14] by the Holy Ghost and it makes us fellow
[1:08:18] citizens of the kingdom of God and there
[1:08:22] is no
[1:08:24] we have no problem with the
[1:08:25] denominational part but no barriers we
[1:08:27] have trouble with because we have
[1:08:29] barriers in the message
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; but when we get into love we have no
[1:08:37] barriers in that at all one great body.
[1:08:42] Now, if you're saying we're all one
[1:08:44] great body, then we you would never have
[1:08:47] the attitude that we got it right and
[1:08:49] they got it wrong.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz the prophet's saying we both have
[1:08:54] it.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:09:05] Next quote here. the devil and sin
[1:09:06] sickness back in Abraham's race ran
[1:09:09] Abraham's race back into a corner and
[1:09:12] what and Jesus stepped out of heaven to
[1:09:14] go to earth God for he so loved the
[1:09:17] world and his love constrained him to do
[1:09:19] something and it projected a savior to
[1:09:22] come to earth and found through the
[1:09:25] found the the thickness of the spear
[1:09:28] which was death and plunged them into it
[1:09:30] and the day he descended up and sent
[1:09:32] back his holy ghost and said unto the
[1:09:35] church, take this and fight the best you
[1:09:38] can. You know what it was? There's the
[1:09:41] way the church has missed it today. The
[1:09:44] love of God that's shed abroad in the
[1:09:48] hearts of the Holy Ghost. Man's afraid
[1:09:51] to take that love.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You'd rather take some manmade
[1:09:57] theology
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; and try to fight with message quotes.
[1:10:04] You'll lose.
[1:10:07] Take what the leader Christ Jesus
[1:10:09] Jehovah God gave us. The love of God
[1:10:12] that constrained him. God so loved the
[1:10:16] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:10:20] son.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:10:26] Who cares what your doctrine is?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:10:34] This next one, I'm just going to
[1:10:35] paraphrase. He talks about he's on the
[1:10:38] mission field and his wife writes him a
[1:10:40] letter and he reads between the lines.
[1:10:44] He said, "You can't read this message
[1:10:47] like a newspaper.
[1:10:49] You can I can tell you right now, and
[1:10:52] you know this, I can get quotes on every
[1:10:54] side. You can get a quote one way. I can
[1:10:55] get three or four or half a dozen the
[1:10:57] other way.
[1:11:00] It's read between the lines." the the
[1:11:02] point the the point but he says here in
[1:11:05] this bottom one he said but fall in love
[1:11:07] with him get down to really get him in
[1:11:10] your heart the love of God that shed
[1:11:12] abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:16] and no one else can read my this next
[1:11:19] paragraph no one else can read my wife's
[1:11:21] letter like that because I love her that
[1:11:26] way and that's the way she writes to me
[1:11:30] see that's the way God writes to you.
[1:11:32] It's between the lines. It's love. There
[1:11:36] is a purpose in the message law.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But God's talking to us between the
[1:11:43] lines.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; It's the spare.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Don't lift the law above the minister.
[1:11:51] Don't lift the minister above God. The
[1:11:52] law above God. I mean, we've seen what
[1:11:55] they did to Stephen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Because Steven preached different than
[1:11:59] the law of Moses. They stoned a Holy
[1:12:02] Ghost-filled
[1:12:04] powerful
[1:12:06] believer.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got the these ones here are from
[1:12:15] verse eight, our texts.
[1:12:21] Watch how you know the prophet sends
[1:12:23] things. We're mis you know
[1:12:27] I I don't look for these. I'm just I
[1:12:30] mean God gave me the scripture and I
[1:12:32] want the message up. Watch how the
[1:12:34] prophet says to fight demons.
[1:12:37] And don't say get a big evangelist.
[1:12:39] Don't say even pray.
[1:12:42] He says buy a box of candy.
[1:12:45] He said when you come home buy her a box
[1:12:47] of candy and give it to her and come out
[1:12:50] at the door and put your arms around her
[1:12:52] and say that's the way you cast out
[1:12:55] devils.
[1:12:57] Love castes out fear, doesn't it? Love
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; a box of candy.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; How in the world in a 61 quote
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; could the me the prophet talk about love
[1:13:13] casting out demons? It's compassion.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Remember the good Samaritan?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Compassion was eternal life.
[1:13:25] love.
[1:13:27] He said, "Friends, the whole world is
[1:13:29] dying for love."
[1:13:32] That's one of the greatest things that
[1:13:34] we can leave out of the Pentecostal
[1:13:36] blessing too much is love mixes it all
[1:13:39] together.
[1:13:41] When the mortar that makes the gifts and
[1:13:44] all the things that God operated
[1:13:46] perfectly is love, one thing for
[1:13:50] another.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; This will all men know that you are my
[1:13:54] disciples by how they love
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; love.
[1:14:03] This is going to be my last quote
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; I believe and we're and it's a long one.
[1:14:10] It's directly connected to verse eight
[1:14:14] and it it just shares so much
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; that we need to look at. And it was
[1:14:20] really what God laid on my heart is
[1:14:23] amazing how God just continued this good
[1:14:26] Samaritan compassion.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; We got to get this right because we're
[1:14:31] at the end.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] And I had another call and said a group
[1:14:37] said, "If you'll have another group sit
[1:14:39] on the platform with you, we'll not have
[1:14:42] nothing to do with your meetings."
[1:14:46] That's worse off than ever. What's the
[1:14:49] matter?
[1:14:51] They've gone off without Christ.
[1:14:56] The love of God in our hearts constrains
[1:14:59] us to preach to every denomination in
[1:15:05] every place.
[1:15:09] And when it gets to a spot that you
[1:15:11] can't have tender love for every human
[1:15:16] being,
[1:15:17] something has happened to you.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to share something. And
[1:15:23] this is not this is this is not about
[1:15:25] me. But you know Osman Bartley said
[1:15:27] something about he said camp meeting was
[1:15:30] different this year
[1:15:34] because I invited everybody.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I told brother Garson and sister Linda I
[1:15:41] said every one of your kids are wide
[1:15:44] open invited. I don't even care if they
[1:15:46] come to the service. Just come and eat
[1:15:47] with me.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; My neighbors across the road came to the
[1:15:50] service. brought me a great big thing of
[1:15:52] chocolate fudge. If I ate it all, it'd
[1:15:54] weigh a,000 lbs.
[1:15:56] My kids get into it and help me save my
[1:15:59] life. They eat my fudge.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:16:05] Don't even come and hear the message.
[1:16:07] Just come and feel love.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Love. Don't they'll they'll come
[1:16:12] eventually. I believe in messages.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:16:16] Sister was there from out of town. She
[1:16:19] hadn't sat in a service in 16 years
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; where you used to attend the Chattam
[1:16:24] church with her. Love.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Love. Just love. I don't even I don't
[1:16:30] want to know. Just love.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; We met yesterday, Ken and Rhonda, Lann's
[1:16:38] brother that was at camp and sang
[1:16:39] beautifully.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I invited them to church. I said, "Come
[1:16:43] and sing worship with us."
[1:16:45] Yeah,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; we talked to the mayor yesterday and
[1:16:48] Rhonda mentioned again. She said, "Wow."
[1:16:50] She said, "I can come here and I don't
[1:16:52] feel no
[1:16:55] uh judge like no push back."
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Sister Patricia. Woo.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Love. You know, Osman Bartley is and now
[1:17:14] I'm doing what I told you not to do, but
[1:17:16] you know, we talked to them in our
[1:17:18] living room
[1:17:20] and she had a question about something
[1:17:22] that happened in the in the camp meeting
[1:17:26] and you know, we I watched Osman Bartley
[1:17:28] completely skirt the idea
[1:17:32] because it wasn't time.
[1:17:34] Love, see, love protects people.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:39] Don't kill people with the truth.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Protect them.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; You don't tell your little kids, "We
[1:17:47] can't afford to pay the house rent this
[1:17:48] month and I don't know how I'm going to
[1:17:50] feed you." You hide that from them.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know the smartest man that ever
[1:17:56] lived that was sent home from school and
[1:17:58] he got a note from his teacher and he
[1:17:59] said, "Your kid is
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Don't ever send him to school again."
[1:18:07] And when the mother was reading the
[1:18:09] note,
[1:18:11] she was balling her face right off her
[1:18:14] head.
[1:18:16] And her son said, "Mommy,
[1:18:18] what is wrong with you?"
[1:18:21] And she said, "This note says
[1:18:24] that you are so brilliant
[1:18:28] that it would be frugalous for you to
[1:18:30] ever attend this classroom again because
[1:18:33] you are so far expelled in the classroom
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; and he was a genius of the world."
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; What was his name, honey?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Thomas Edison.
[1:18:49] Sometimes,
[1:18:51] kids, plug your ears.
[1:18:54] Especially you, Silus.
[1:18:57] Sometimes, I'm going to tell you
[1:18:58] something off the
[1:19:01] If you're protecting somebody, sometimes
[1:19:04] it's okay to lie.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I said that. Do you know Abraham
[1:19:14] lied and taught his son Isaac to lie?
[1:19:16] And God sent the king to say, "If you
[1:19:19] don't get that liar to pray for you, I
[1:19:21] will kill you."
[1:19:24] Lie. Love.
[1:19:28] Love constrains. Say, "Daddy, what are
[1:19:31] we going to eat?" I don't know. If you
[1:19:32] don't, you know, I I can tell you
[1:19:34] another. You're looking at me like I
[1:19:36] just lost my mind. Yeah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; You know, there was a story, this is a
[1:19:41] real story,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; where a daddy never had nothing to eat
[1:19:44] and he started a fire and he put a stone
[1:19:48] in the kettle and he's borrowing water
[1:19:50] with the stone and the kids sitting
[1:19:53] there thinking, "Daddy's cooking
[1:19:54] dinner."
[1:19:57] Church, that daddy was lying to his
[1:20:00] kids.
[1:20:04] They were sitting at the fire and we're
[1:20:06] waiting for the food to cook.
[1:20:10] And the end of that story is a man come
[1:20:12] by and gave him groceries and he could
[1:20:16] dump the stone out and put the food in.
[1:20:20] Protection is love. I want to share
[1:20:23] something with you. So this person that
[1:20:26] was at camp,
[1:20:28] it's going to shock you. She wasn't, she
[1:20:30] had no problem with the preaching of the
[1:20:31] word.
[1:20:36] But just a baby spiritually
[1:20:40] and she seen a husband
[1:20:43] I can't mean attack his wife and treat
[1:20:46] her less than a queen and because she
[1:20:49] had something in her it feathers and she
[1:20:52] said
[1:20:55] I don't like this parrot.
[1:21:02] You thought they would come in and not
[1:21:04] like the preaching of the word. That
[1:21:06] wasn't a problem. But she was watching
[1:21:10] our lives
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; and she was watching how the brothers
[1:21:15] treated the sisters. And because she was
[1:21:18] coming from a sister world
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; that's a dominating sister. when she
[1:21:23] seen a man
[1:21:27] and she asked Osman and he just went
[1:21:29] around the bush
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't time
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; because somebody
[1:21:40] gave a wrong spirit
[1:21:44] towards his wife
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; and it was offending a baby and so he
[1:21:49] went around and skirted the issue.
[1:21:53] He didn't say, "Oh, bless God. We
[1:21:54] believe the h the head of the house and
[1:21:56] yeah,
[1:21:59] you know, the women come under the man."
[1:22:02] She would have just went,
[1:22:06] "I'll see you in about a hundred years."
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:22:20] Watch what our prophet says.
[1:22:31] When you get to the spot that you can't
[1:22:33] have tender love, that's the bottom line
[1:22:35] here. When you get to the spot that you
[1:22:38] can't have tender love to every human
[1:22:41] being,
[1:22:43] something's happened to you.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And it's not conversion.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm closing on this quote. I
[1:22:51] just got go the next prayer. So God so
[1:22:53] loved us when you were yet sinners, an
[1:22:55] alien from God, the enemy, the
[1:22:58] commonwealth of God. He so loved you
[1:23:01] that he gave his life for you. Sure. And
[1:23:03] if you get the spirit in you, watch
[1:23:06] this. We're to have the nature of
[1:23:08] Christ.
[1:23:10] The Holy Spirit is God. It's a spirit.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; God's everywhere in the spirit form.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He acts exactly the same. This this
[1:23:20] quote finishes something unbelievable. I
[1:23:22] I it's just just don't lose me.
[1:23:28] He beloved. He gave your life for sure.
[1:23:30] And if you get the spirit into you that
[1:23:32] you're better than someone else or
[1:23:34] you're worse than anybody then you're
[1:23:37] worse then you're worse than anybody
[1:23:40] else that I know of.
[1:23:43] Now
[1:23:45] you know I just
[1:23:47] if you get the spirit that you're better
[1:23:49] because you're sitting
[1:23:52] under the truth
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; than somebody else then you're worse
[1:23:56] than anybody
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; even though it's still the truth.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Then you're worse than anybody else I
[1:24:02] know. I don't care if you if you're so
[1:24:06] correct in your message theology and
[1:24:09] your motives and objectives are wrong.
[1:24:12] I'd rather be wrong in my theology
[1:24:16] than wrong in my heart. That's right.
[1:24:17] The spirit of God dwells in our heart. I
[1:24:19] think I read this a week ago. In the
[1:24:20] Garden of Eden, let's watch this.
[1:24:23] In the Garden of Eden, God chose the
[1:24:25] heart and man chose
[1:24:29] the head.
[1:24:31] And he comes out with bitterness in his
[1:24:33] heart against his fellow citizens of the
[1:24:36] kingdom of God. That ain't God.
[1:24:39] See how we God is no respector of
[1:24:42] person. If somebody comes in and they
[1:24:45] look like different than us. I'm getting
[1:24:47] to this in this quote.
[1:24:49] I I got I got to just read this quote.
[1:24:52] Satan seen them go a far off here. He's
[1:24:54] talking about Satan when the disciples
[1:24:56] were in the boat and he he realized the
[1:24:59] disciples were away from Jesus and he
[1:25:02] said you get to the place when Oh,
[1:25:04] sorry. Maybe that's the next quote.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. No, that's that's right.
[1:25:09] Sorry. Satan, he's seen them go off
[1:25:11] without God. And so he said, "Let's get
[1:25:14] rid of them." This is a good old way to
[1:25:17] get rid of them. Oh, brother, when you
[1:25:18] get to the place that you can't reach
[1:25:20] across the fence. Now, what was Sister
[1:25:21] Ruth talking about in her testimony?
[1:25:23] When you can't reach across the fence
[1:25:25] and come across the street and associate
[1:25:27] or call a man, a man, even a man or a
[1:25:30] brother, and just because there might be
[1:25:32] some little hairs difference,
[1:25:39] By the way, I this was in my quote
[1:25:40] before Sister Ruth contacted me. There's
[1:25:43] a hair's different. How do you know that
[1:25:45] you're not a little different in God's
[1:25:48] sight? Some little something.
[1:25:53] And be a brother. Why certainly,
[1:25:57] brother, the altar is your place. That's
[1:25:59] exactly right. Get right with God.
[1:26:04] But we thought, well, we know we're
[1:26:06] right. I know the message is right. So
[1:26:07] anybody that don't know about the
[1:26:09] message that makes them the opposite.
[1:26:12] Don't go there.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Just that's what he's tell us. Don't go
[1:26:16] there.
[1:26:19] He said I don't want that evil spirit on
[1:26:22] me.
[1:26:31] He said, "But oh brother, don't let even
[1:26:33] evil thing come on you men." No sir,
[1:26:36] brother, stick together like molasses in
[1:26:39] a con cold morning. Just really, really
[1:26:42] cling together as thick as can be. And
[1:26:46] you know, molasses, they it's really
[1:26:48] cold. He said, "Blessed be the ties that
[1:26:50] binds our heart and Christian love."
[1:26:52] Now, that was why I sang that song this
[1:26:54] morning.
[1:26:56] Blessed be the tithes that bind our
[1:26:58] heart in Christian love. Not in
[1:27:00] doctrine, in love.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fellowship of kindred hearts
[1:27:06] is like to that above.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're all right, Sister Dama.
[1:27:11] Don't worry about it. You ain't hurting
[1:27:13] anybody. That's the way we should be.
[1:27:16] Certainly not greedy, not selfish, not
[1:27:19] indifferent, and not ungodly. The fruits
[1:27:22] of the spirit are love, joy,
[1:27:24] longsuffering, meekness, gentleness,
[1:27:26] faith, patience, and that's all the
[1:27:28] fruit of the spirit. Now, watch. This is
[1:27:29] the one I want you to get to. You know,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; a tree if he's got is that sorghum?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Sycamore. I'm sorry. I'm so If
[1:27:41] you got sycamore bark, now do you know
[1:27:43] what he's saying here? If you see a
[1:27:45] person as tight to a tree and if they
[1:27:49] look different than you think they
[1:27:50] should look
[1:27:53] I just that means if they don't have
[1:27:57] holiness
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; and I believe in holiness now let me go
[1:28:02] to the other side. Let me go let's jump
[1:28:04] over on the other side of the fence. If
[1:28:06] you know holiness is right and you don't
[1:28:07] do it that's iniquity and you're
[1:28:09] sinning.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's the other side. But if somebody
[1:28:12] don't know about holiness and they come
[1:28:14] in and they're a sycamore tree and they
[1:28:17] look like an unholy person but they are
[1:28:20] now this how is this but and they are
[1:28:22] producing apples
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; and the sycamore tree on the bark on it
[1:28:31] and apples are grown on it. What is it?
[1:28:33] It's an apple tree. Wait a minute. Wait
[1:28:35] a minute. No it ain't. It's an unholy
[1:28:37] Jezebel. No, it's an unholy sycamore
[1:28:41] tree. No, it ain't. What brother say?
[1:28:44] The spirit.
[1:28:46] Look at their spirit.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; They maybe haven't come to doctrine.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And doctrine is right, but they maybe
[1:28:53] haven't got that far to doctrine, but
[1:28:55] they could have the spirit that produces
[1:28:58] apples and have an unholy body. Sycamore
[1:29:02] tree.
[1:29:04] Sycamore tree. Watch what he says. And
[1:29:07] the life of the tree produces apples. No
[1:29:09] matter what your theology is, right or
[1:29:11] wrong, if you're bearing the wrong kind
[1:29:13] of fruit, you're the wrong kind of tree,
[1:29:15] brother. Jesus said, "By your fruits you
[1:29:17] shall know them." It's not by how you
[1:29:19] look.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And it's not by your doctrine.
[1:29:24] It's by your spirit.
[1:29:27] Now, now if you if you know the doctrine
[1:29:29] and you don't do it, then that's
[1:29:31] iniquity and you're sinning. So So I
[1:29:34] said, "I've been in the faith for years
[1:29:35] and years." But you see what I mean? If
[1:29:37] somebody walked in here
[1:29:40] and they don't know just whatever, you
[1:29:42] know where I'm going. They don't look
[1:29:44] like a holiness message believer. And we
[1:29:47] would immediately say, "Ah,
[1:29:50] you know who I bought my breakfast
[1:29:51] Friday morning? A Pentecostal."
[1:29:54] You know who helped Jared Combine Deans
[1:29:55] yesterday? A Pentecostal preacher.
[1:29:59] Do you know who's already already gave
[1:30:01] me the money to put through the church
[1:30:03] to buy his ticket to go to Jamaica and
[1:30:05] El Salvador? A Pentecostal preacher,
[1:30:08] Brother G.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe a sycamore tree, but he's
[1:30:17] producing apples.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up on this. You've
[1:30:23] heard me preach till you're so sick
[1:30:25] you'd quit coming here about badger
[1:30:26] skin. Don't get caught up too much with
[1:30:28] badger skin.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Don't worship the skin.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; It will rot.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Don't worship the bark.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Worship the spirit.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Worship the fruit.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; That's okay. Now, I just want to clarify
[1:30:46] something. Brother Dale's way too dumb
[1:30:49] to find that quote. I've never read it
[1:30:52] in my life. I've never heard it in my
[1:30:55] life. and it was connected to the eighth
[1:30:58] verse of the text we read Romans 8.
[1:31:02] That's how I found it. So I don't even
[1:31:05] try to preach this stuff
[1:31:08] and the Holy Spirit is smacking me on
[1:31:10] the back
[1:31:15] and now he saw them without Jesus the
[1:31:18] devil. this talking about they were in
[1:31:19] the boat and he began to blow poison and
[1:31:22] roll up a storm in the ship and whirl
[1:31:25] and all this and he said, "Wow, when you
[1:31:27] belong to my organization, you don't
[1:31:30] belong to anyone else." Anything. If you
[1:31:33] don't belong to my organization or you
[1:31:35] don't belong to anything,
[1:31:38] well, you're the one that's right and
[1:31:40] the rest are wrong. You've separated
[1:31:42] yourself.
[1:31:44] Wrong spirit.
[1:31:48] How come we have never heard this kind
[1:31:50] of message prophet? This is the third
[1:31:54] message I've preached on this thing and
[1:31:56] they're everywhere
[1:31:59] in the message.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; I go to message churches. If you're not
[1:32:02] a message believer, you're not going
[1:32:04] you're not going to be in heaven. You're
[1:32:05] not a part of the bar. You're not this.
[1:32:07] You're not that. You're not going in the
[1:32:09] rapture. You're not you don't got the
[1:32:10] spirit of Christ. You're you don't you
[1:32:13] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:14] because you got to have it under the
[1:32:15] true message of the thing. You you're
[1:32:17] not this.
[1:32:20] What prophet are they listening to?
[1:32:27] If you weren't birthed in a message
[1:32:28] church and you weren't baptized under
[1:32:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, which
[1:32:32] is a correct baptism, by the way, and if
[1:32:36] you're not one of us, well, you're just
[1:32:37] lost.
[1:32:41] Watch what the next paragraph says.
[1:32:44] That's poison. Breath of Satan.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Can you get any stronger than that?
[1:32:55] So, I've been listening to message
[1:32:57] preachers for 35 years, and they said,
[1:32:59] 'Well, if you weren't birthed in a
[1:33:00] message church, you won't go in the
[1:33:01] rapture. If you weren't birthed in a
[1:33:03] message church and you weren't baptized,
[1:33:05] Kirk Baptism, the thief on the cross,
[1:33:07] wasn't even baptized, by the way. He he
[1:33:09] completely missed.
[1:33:11] These things are right,
[1:33:14] but we've had the wrong spirit in a
[1:33:16] ministering them.
[1:33:19] You might as well just say, "Amen.
[1:33:25] Because brother Bram says
[1:33:27] if you if you think everybody else is
[1:33:29] you're right, everybody else is wrong,
[1:33:31] you separate that's a poison breath of
[1:33:34] Satan. That's what Sister Ruth was
[1:33:36] talking about in her testimony.
[1:33:39] It's a cancer.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; It's a cancer. And we need to learn love
[1:33:45] is God.
[1:33:47] Watch this. He said God will You know
[1:33:49] what, Chad? I loved what I shared with
[1:33:51] Chad Lamb. It was so amazing. It just
[1:33:56] blew my mind.
[1:33:58] He said, "If I'm wrong,
[1:34:02] trust God to correct my mind to get me
[1:34:05] where I'm supposed to be, but I'll have
[1:34:06] the right spirit."
[1:34:11] He said, "If you're separating,
[1:34:14] if your attitude is to separate because
[1:34:17] I'm right and everybody else is wrong,
[1:34:20] wrong spirit,
[1:34:22] thus sayith the prophet."
[1:34:24] And that's why I sent it out to
[1:34:26] everybody I could think of, which I
[1:34:29] left. I had never heard it so perfectly.
[1:34:33] Wrong spirit.
[1:34:35] Amen. It's a It's a spirit. It I I could
[1:34:39] be that wrong. I could be that wrong.
[1:34:42] You could be a They could all be right.
[1:34:46] But we don't have to separate.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Trust God that eventually we'll get it
[1:34:51] right.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not intentionally wrong.
[1:34:56] I'm not even really even preaching this
[1:34:58] morning.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I'm just showing you what the prophet
[1:35:01] preached.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; I could just point
[1:35:08] Yeah,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; but people don't there's people that
[1:35:13] don't want what the prophet preached.
[1:35:16] This is our third message preaching
[1:35:18] things that are very uncommon
[1:35:21] because we have a fleshly badger skin
[1:35:24] thing that I got it and you don't and
[1:35:27] I'm special and you're not and I'll be
[1:35:29] there and you won't.
[1:35:33] And he said, "That's the breath of Satan
[1:35:36] poison."
[1:35:40] I said this once before and it just
[1:35:41] comes to me again. In what world would a
[1:35:44] parent of the kids that you birth to
[1:35:48] have your blood want them to fail
[1:35:51] or not be in heaven? In what world? And
[1:35:54] God birthed you, but you don't want the
[1:35:58] other children to get in.
[1:36:00] That's none of your business.
[1:36:03] Love.
[1:36:05] Love.
[1:36:08] That's the breath of Satan. Don't have
[1:36:09] nothing to do with him. He don't believe
[1:36:13] like we do.
[1:36:19] There's only one message, faith.
[1:36:24] If you don't believe like I do, there's
[1:36:27] only one faith, and that's faith in God.
[1:36:29] That's right. Faith. Humble faith. Don't
[1:36:32] never get very far from it. But God's
[1:36:34] faith will make you love
[1:36:38] everybody.
[1:36:41] It'll make you love everybody. That's
[1:36:42] right. That's what God's faith does.
[1:36:44] See, it makes you have the same feeling
[1:36:47] that Jesus did. And we're closing on
[1:36:50] this one, so you can take a time out. It
[1:36:53] makes you have the same feeling that
[1:36:55] Jesus did because the spirit of Christ
[1:36:58] is in you. And God so loved the world.
[1:37:00] John 3:16 that he gave his only begotten
[1:37:04] son that whosoever
[1:37:07] believeth.
[1:37:09] It didn't say look right. It didn't say
[1:37:12] act right. Didn't say live right. And I
[1:37:15] believe in all of those things. I really
[1:37:17] do.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; But our gospel in the Bible, he went to
[1:37:23] some very far out people in the word of
[1:37:25] God.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And we're not going to reassess them.
[1:37:30] But you would have the same feeling as
[1:37:31] Jesus did because the spirit of Christ
[1:37:34] is in you. You know Christ never blocked
[1:37:37] out. He would that all
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; would be saved.
[1:37:44] Now he's omnipotent
[1:37:46] and he knows the beginning from the end.
[1:37:49] And so he knew that some would reject
[1:37:53] him.
[1:37:55] But that same spirit went up and the
[1:37:59] mountain and weeped over Jerusalem and
[1:38:03] said, "I would have wooed you like a hen
[1:38:07] to put you under my wings, but you would
[1:38:10] not
[1:38:12] would not." Amen. We should rather than
[1:38:16] arguing and disagreeing and separating,
[1:38:21] why don't we weep?
[1:38:25] Why don't we weep for the separation in
[1:38:27] the message churches?
[1:38:30] Why don't we weep for the message
[1:38:32] separation of the gospel? Why don't we
[1:38:35] weep for the separation in the world?
[1:38:38] Weep.
[1:38:40] Because when the death angel went,
[1:38:43] he put a mark over them
[1:38:47] that had compassion
[1:38:49] inside and cried
[1:38:51] for the abominations
[1:38:54] committed on the earth.
[1:38:58] You know, if we weep for the people that
[1:39:02] don't see it like us,
[1:39:04] it would change everything.
[1:39:07] If we weep for the ones that haven't
[1:39:10] come to the revelation that God blessed
[1:39:13] you with, blessed are you saints, Simon
[1:39:16] Barjonah, for flesh and blood did not
[1:39:18] reveal this unto you, but my father
[1:39:21] which was in heaven. If we would weep
[1:39:24] and say, Lord Jesus, would you please
[1:39:27] give
[1:39:29] them
[1:39:30] what you gave me?
[1:39:35] It'll first be love and then it'll be
[1:39:36] revelation that wow,
[1:39:40] you are an amazing God.
[1:39:43] Love.
[1:39:45] I'm not I'm not God's not talking about
[1:39:48] this
[1:39:50] filio garbage that you you know what I
[1:39:53] mean?
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; We can't buy our friends. Brother Brown
[1:40:00] talked about that. We can't buy people
[1:40:02] to come to church and serve God. But you
[1:40:05] can be kind.
[1:40:10] Just kind the good Samaritan.
[1:40:14] What must I do to have eternal life?
[1:40:20] We need to ask that question more than
[1:40:22] what must I do
[1:40:25] to belong to a message church?
[1:40:28] What must I do to have eternal life?
[1:40:32] and a pagan
[1:40:34] by religion, Samaritan, a half breed,
[1:40:40] had eternal life. When the believers of
[1:40:43] the day, the priests and the Levites,
[1:40:47] let's say another way. Can I say it
[1:40:48] another way? Is that all right? I I'm
[1:40:50] going to shut up.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; The pastors and the evangelists
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; never had it.
[1:41:01] They never had it
[1:41:04] because they couldn't. They went away.
[1:41:06] They went around.
[1:41:09] They just let him die.
[1:41:11] I know he left the church. Just let him
[1:41:14] die. Ain't got nothing to do with me.
[1:41:16] They didn't like my preaching. Just let
[1:41:18] him die. Let him lay there.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:41:27] love.
[1:41:29] I challenge you to look at this quote.
[1:41:33] It's on the message hub, the eth verse.
[1:41:36] And look at the sycamore tree producing
[1:41:39] apples.
[1:41:42] And the prophet said, "God will judge
[1:41:45] your spirit.
[1:41:49] You might not have everything right in
[1:41:51] life, but if you have the spirit of
[1:41:53] Christ, you'll be there.
[1:41:56] You will be. That will be number one.
[1:42:00] Number one. Let's stand.
[1:42:03] I believe that churches around the world
[1:42:06] have missed that by a million miles.
[1:42:09] That's just my own personal opinion.
[1:42:14] And a lot of it has to do with lifting
[1:42:15] up really good people. Really, they're
[1:42:18] good people. They're amazing people.
[1:42:22] But it's not about that.
[1:42:25] You know, I I pray if if I happen if God
[1:42:28] I pray I don't I pray the rapture
[1:42:31] happens or I I die before Lan. But if I
[1:42:35] happen to be an old man, I don't want
[1:42:37] you to post on the internet that Dale
[1:42:39] was a great person.
[1:42:41] Just say that God was a great God.
[1:42:44] You know what I mean?
[1:42:49] The Bible says that our holiness is as
[1:42:52] filthy rags.
[1:42:56] And there's none holy by God. So when we
[1:42:59] have a great big person die, we post all
[1:43:01] these great things.
[1:43:04] But it's taken away from a great God.
[1:43:09] It's a great God.
[1:43:12] Amen.
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:16] Amen.
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:21] Amen.
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:26] Amen. It's just uh
[1:43:29] you just have to believe that that was
[1:43:32] God that gave that to me.
[1:43:35] It couldn't have lined up more perfect
[1:43:38] with Sister Ruth's testimony.
[1:43:41] That could not have been possible.
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:47] Amen.
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:58] What is that?
[1:44:01] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:44:07] Make it ever true.
[1:44:13] Change my heart again.
[1:44:19] May I
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:33] [Applause]
[1:44:40] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:50] Heat.
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:45:01] Heat.

[1:45:24] Jesus.
[1:45:26] [Applause]
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:37] Let's sing that song. He's got it all in
[1:45:39] control. You know, I want to just sing
[1:45:41] this song to me when we're here. You
[1:45:44] know, you can't make people want to be
[1:45:47] around you.
[1:45:51] You can't dictate what somebody else
[1:45:53] believes in their life.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And if somebody chooses to separate, you
[1:45:59] can't dictate that. That's their choice.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; But you can do this. You can build an
[1:46:05] environment
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; because you're a God. You can build an
[1:46:10] environment around you that is so
[1:46:13] magnetic that people will fly to be
[1:46:17] fighting because of love.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; People will stop cars and stop airplanes
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; and create roadblocks
[1:46:29] because the love of Christ and kindness
[1:46:33] and compassion. I'm not saying this
[1:46:36] cheap stuff. I'm saying genuine
[1:46:40] love
[1:46:42] that it will change those people
[1:46:45] to say, "Hey, you know what?
[1:46:48] I don't see what, but there's something
[1:46:50] about them. I just like being around
[1:46:54] just a race. I don't know what it is. I
[1:46:57] don't know what it is. I just like I'm
[1:47:00] going by, you know, I I this come to me.
[1:47:02] I'm going to share this with you." You
[1:47:04] know, Brother Bram tells a story
[1:47:07] and he was sharing it to
[1:47:11] a brother, it's a minister that's died
[1:47:15] and he was telling them of a family in
[1:47:17] the church and all the things that were
[1:47:19] wrong with them
[1:47:22] in confidence in the vehicle
[1:47:25] and they were on a long drive. You know
[1:47:26] the amount of miles that Perry drove, it
[1:47:29] was actually Perry Green. He was sharing
[1:47:31] it to him and they came within like
[1:47:35] a huge an hour of their house or
[1:47:38] something.
[1:47:40] Brother Brown said, "You know what?
[1:47:42] We need to go by their house."
[1:47:46] And Perry just said,
[1:47:49] "Huh?
[1:47:52] Huh?
[1:47:54] What? You just spent
[1:47:58] you told me all these.
[1:48:02] And you know what? Brother Ram looked at
[1:48:03] him and he said, "Oh,
[1:48:06] I'm so disappointed in you.
[1:48:10] I thought you knew
[1:48:12] love."
[1:48:16] Brother Bram seen their faults,
[1:48:19] but he loved them so much
[1:48:23] that he would go, I a huge distance of
[1:48:25] he said, I just I thought you had been
[1:48:27] introduced
[1:48:29] to love.
[1:48:31] I thought you knew love
[1:48:33] because somebody don't love you. You can
[1:48:35] still take them flowers, ch you don't
[1:48:37] even have to deliver them. You can
[1:48:38] actually have people pay people to do
[1:48:40] it. It'll improve the economy.
[1:48:43] Love
[1:48:46] love. And he looked at him and he said,
[1:48:49] "Oh, I'm so disappointed. You didn't
[1:48:52] just because I told you they're ours.
[1:48:54] I'm still going to go buy their house.
[1:48:58] I'm not avoiding them. I love them."
[1:49:05] Amen.
[1:49:08] He's got it all in control.
[1:49:13] Oh, he's got it all in control.
[1:49:19] He put that reassurance
[1:49:23] way down in my soul.
[1:49:27] He's got it all in control.
[1:49:32] I put my life in his hands.
[1:49:37] I put my life in his hands.
[1:49:42] hand.
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:44] [Applause]
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:11] for me.
[1:50:14] My father knows what I need.
[1:50:19] He's got it all in control.
[1:50:24] He's got it all in control
[1:50:33] way down in my soul.
[1:50:40] God bless you.
