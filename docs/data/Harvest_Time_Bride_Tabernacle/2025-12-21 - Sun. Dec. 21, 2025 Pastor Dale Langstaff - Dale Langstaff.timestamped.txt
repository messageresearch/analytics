[23:15] Hey,
[23:46] Thank you Lord Jesus. Lord we we love
[23:49] you Lord Jesus. We give you all the
[23:51] glory honor. You alone are our Lord
[23:55] Jesus Christ. You alone are worthy and
[23:59] we exalt you and magnify you and glorify
[24:03] your wonderful name. where every knee
[24:06] will bow and every tongue will confess
[24:08] that there's no other God, no other
[24:12] Jehovah Gyra, no other savior
[24:17] but the Lord Jesus Christ.
[24:20] Lord, I pray you'll bless these
[24:21] beautiful people that you purchased with
[24:24] your own blood and predestinated before
[24:27] the foundation of the world to be here
[24:30] this morning, Lord. and many are out
[24:33] because of distance or sickness, Lord
[24:36] God, or even holidays, Lord God. Be with
[24:40] them and bless them and keep them safe,
[24:42] Lord God. And at your appointed time,
[24:45] you'll bring us back together, Lord God,
[24:47] we pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[24:51] Amen.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, that course is beautiful. For
[24:57] he alone is worthy.
[25:00] Don't let us in the world.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; That's our whole life.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; That's our whole life.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ Jesus the Lord. Amen.
[25:09] That's just
[25:11] that that song would be good every

[25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, let us adore him. That's our
[25:17] whole purpose in coming here. Amen.
[25:19] Thank you musicians. And God bless you.
[25:22] We're just uh uh good to be here. Yes,
[25:25] many. I I was thinking when I was coming
[25:28] up here, I said, "This is almost
[25:33] almost like swearing to me." I said, "I
[25:35] felt like we were back in CO when we
[25:37] were only allowed 10 in the church."
[25:39] Amen. Amen. Just many out. Lauren,
[25:42] brother Lauren and Sister Sheila are
[25:44] gone for Christmas. Went on a cruise and
[25:46] be back the 28th. And I know Lanne was
[25:49] talking to sister Ruth and I had sent
[25:51] brother Bernard a message, but Lan was
[25:54] talking to him about getting together
[25:56] and at our place. And so different ones
[25:58] are out for different reasons. Amen.
[26:01] Brother Matt sick and
[26:04] Amen. And brother Jeff and sister Damla.
[26:07] Amen. They were good on Wednesday. They
[26:09] were here. And just God be with them
[26:12] too. Amen. So
[26:14] &gt;&gt; we just just possible we could have more
[26:16] watching online of our own church
[26:20] &gt;&gt; than we do here. Amen. Amen. But God
[26:23] bless them. I pray that I I pray that
[26:26] the kids are okay with Sister Domla and
[26:29] Brother Jeff and
[26:30] &gt;&gt; and uh Brother Matt gets feeling better.
[26:33] Amen. And just uh God is God is very
[26:37] good. Amen.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. just uh maybe one little
[26:42] announcement. Brother Jim got somebody
[26:44] to come and watch uh sister Linda from
[26:48] uh from you know assisted living or
[26:52] whatever. And so he's actually here on
[26:55] every
[26:57] uh every Wednesday.
[26:59] So actually last Wednesday or many as
[27:02] long as the weather's good, you know, of
[27:03] course. But so he will actually be
[27:06] sharing some Wednesdays. he shared last
[27:07] Wednesday
[27:09] &gt;&gt; was really nice and and good and
[27:11] &gt;&gt; that but he can get somebody to come on
[27:13] Wednesday but he cannot get nobody on
[27:16] Sunday
[27:17] &gt;&gt; or not not through the same program
[27:20] anyway.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Well, God bless you. It's
[27:24] just good to be here and and we
[27:27] certainly love you and and appreciate
[27:29] your friendship and even those online
[27:32] and we know many are here just or not
[27:34] here because of of just things that have
[27:38] come up. Amen. But um one other little
[27:40] announcement we might uh talk about is
[27:43] uh next Sunday we were actually thinking
[27:45] of having uh
[27:47] next Sunday I believe it's the 28th of
[27:49] having really a worship service and
[27:51] testimony.
[27:53] Maybe I'll share a little something of
[27:55] the word and having communion and
[27:57] footwashing. If I did, it'd probably be
[27:58] about communion and footwashing. Um, the
[28:01] only reason I talked to brother Matt
[28:02] about that earlier, by the way, brother
[28:05] Matt and Abigail weren't here last
[28:06] Sunday because he said they got right on
[28:08] two feet of snow right on the dot. He
[28:11] said the drifts were much lighter than
[28:12] said we had two feet everywhere. He was
[28:15] I forget how long he told me it took it
[28:17] took him like hours to shovel to the
[28:20] curb or it was a long time anyway. I
[28:23] think it was two hours and something but
[28:25] he said we had 2 ft of snow everywhere.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; I mean the the the lake just dumped on
[28:31] him and uh and then this week he's uh
[28:34] not feeling good. But uh so I talked to
[28:37] brother Matt. He he had called and told
[28:38] me that last Sunday and after church and
[28:41] I said, you know, we would have it on
[28:42] the 28th unless they were gone away for,
[28:45] you know, family Christmas or or
[28:47] holidays or things and then we would
[28:49] move it to the first Sunday in January.
[28:52] So if if a lot are going to be gone, we
[28:54] will move it to the first Sunday.
[28:57] That would kind of be our year end
[29:01] uh communion. Amen. Let's just read our
[29:04] scripture and get into our topic today.
[29:08] Let's just turn to Luke uh 2:11
[29:15] and uh read a scripture here.
[29:19] You can have your seats.
[29:23] Amen.
[29:26] This has been a long time since I
[29:29] ministered on this. We'll just read our
[29:30] scripture.
[29:33] For unto you is born this day in the
[29:37] city of David a Savior, which is Christ
[29:40] the Lord. And you shall be a sign unto
[29:42] you that you shall find the babe wrapped
[29:45] in swallowing clothes, lying in a
[29:48] manger. And as suddenly there appear
[29:50] there was
[29:52] with the angels a multitude of heavenly
[29:54] hosts praising God saying glory to God
[29:57] in the highest and peace on earth good
[30:01] will towards men. Lord Jesus we pray
[30:04] that that whatever your plans were for
[30:06] today it's okay with us. We just are
[30:10] your vessel your tool. We surrender to
[30:13] your will and your leadership of your
[30:14] Holy Spirit Lord God. And Lord, you
[30:17] know, uh, you know, your thoughts before
[30:21] the foundation of the world and what
[30:23] you've laid on my heart to share. But
[30:25] Lord God, if you change them or we go a
[30:27] different route or whatever your will
[30:29] is,
[30:30] &gt;&gt; we give you the glory and honor for your
[30:33] name's sake. Amen. Amen. You may have
[30:35] your seats. Am I on, Vicki?
[30:39] &gt;&gt; My mic.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[30:43] Amen. Well, that's just an amazing
[30:45] scripture. I want to just read a thing
[30:47] and maybe when we get into this or even
[30:49] make a disclaimer. I want my message is
[30:52] today on Christmas and uh and uh I'm
[30:56] going to I'm going to just preach on
[30:58] Christmas uh the truth and the facts of
[31:01] Christmas. But uh in no way if you are
[31:06] in a different spot, I don't feel like
[31:09] I'm elevated because I'm in a different
[31:11] spot than you or or this is not like
[31:14] condemnation and I don't even want to
[31:16] know what you do. And that's between you
[31:18] and God. And and but but you know, I I
[31:22] preached this back in the house before
[31:23] we even bought this. and and I seen our
[31:26] grandkids are getting a little taller
[31:28] and and the the young ones deserve to
[31:31] know the truth.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Um and uh
[31:35] &gt;&gt; and what we do with it is is an
[31:38] individual affair
[31:39] &gt;&gt; and and so let's just not have an arm
[31:41] wrestling mass after I don't want to
[31:43] talk about it after. It don't make no
[31:45] difference to me. Uh I I do what I feel
[31:48] God wants me to do for me the best I can
[31:53] and and even then I fail daily, hourly,
[31:56] minutely
[31:58] &gt;&gt; and every few seconds too
[32:00] &gt;&gt; and uh but I I there is some history
[32:03] involved here
[32:05] &gt;&gt; and there is some truth involved
[32:08] &gt;&gt; and I want to show you some of these
[32:10] things and if you see it differently you
[32:13] know God bless you. Amen. I want to just
[32:16] show you the first quote here. He said,
[32:17] "Brother Bam said,"Remember during
[32:19] Christmas to worship the Lord Jesus.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Worship him and the power in his power
[32:26] and his resurrection." Now, you know, I
[32:28] just shared this one quote here. Brother
[32:30] Bram said multiple times that Christmas
[32:34] should be worshiped.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; That's why I said next Sunday, if we did
[32:37] if we did nothing but worship Jehovah
[32:41] &gt;&gt; and testify and give him the glory. You
[32:43] know, there's some of you have powerful
[32:46] testimonies and Sister Dla is one of
[32:48] them and it's just because she's shared
[32:49] them. But but God is very much alive and
[32:53] well. Amen. And and doing we we actually
[32:55] had a a testimony just yesterday. We
[32:59] celebrated the first birthday yesterday
[33:02] of our little grandson, Oliver. Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And that that's just completely a
[33:07] miracle from the beginning to end. I
[33:10] actually thought when he was born he was
[33:11] under 3 lb, but he was over 3 lb.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; I found that out yesterday.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; But uh God is very good. Amen. And and
[33:20] we just we just know that. And and so it
[33:23] Christmas is about worship. And and we
[33:25] might even get into it uh uh before, but
[33:28] I'm going to tell you another thing that
[33:30] brother Brandham said. He said, "Without
[33:32] Christmas, you would not have
[33:34] salvation." Okay.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Without Christmas,
[33:38] &gt;&gt; there's no salvation.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; So Christmas is real.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just maybe we'll read
[33:44] our Oh, here we go. Here. He said, "If
[33:47] there wasn't a Christmas, there wouldn't
[33:49] even be salvation." Now, we're facing
[33:52] Christmas again. And it's too bad that
[33:54] we've changed the real meaning of it. I
[33:57] don't mean you have, but I just mean
[34:00] around it. You know, I might say things.
[34:02] I'm not pointing at nobody. You know,
[34:04] I'm just saying this is very general
[34:07] &gt;&gt; that the general meaning of Christmas
[34:09] has changed of being the birth of Jesus
[34:12] until well that Santa Claus has taken
[34:14] the place of Christ. I don't mean he has
[34:16] in your home
[34:17] &gt;&gt; but in the world. Amen. I'm
[34:19] &gt;&gt; but and you know the the the lies of of
[34:22] you know all these things and and Santa
[34:25] Claus don't come down a chimney and he
[34:27] can't fit in my chimney and there's too
[34:28] much soot in it. It would be sticky, by
[34:30] the way,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; because I'm burning a little bit of
[34:32] almost wet wood
[34:35] &gt;&gt; and he's far too fat.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we need to be truthful. And
[34:40] brother Bram says things like this that
[34:42] our kids need to know the truth. Jesus
[34:45] came and was born and he brought
[34:47] salvation to the earth,
[34:49] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't now.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; It was probably in April.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Bram said that
[34:58] Jesus was a lamb and if he was born now,
[35:01] he probably was like Matt Lacroy last
[35:03] Sunday. He probably had 2 feet of snow
[35:05] through Jerusalem. He would have froze
[35:07] to death on the donkey. A lot of the
[35:09] roads and the mountains would have been
[35:10] snowed in completely. The valleys would
[35:12] have been full and there would have been
[35:14] no birth this time of year. Amen. But it
[35:17] was a birth.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Bram said things like
[35:20] this. He said, "Christmas is like
[35:22] tubeless tires.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; It's this time of year, but it ain't
[35:26] going to change." Right.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; We can celebrate Christmas April 1st if
[35:30] you want to. That's okay with me.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; But we're not going to change the the
[35:34] world.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Uh scenario. Tubeless tires, brother
[35:38] Bram said, are here to stay. And I hate
[35:40] them.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; And the celebration of Christmas is here
[35:44] this time of year, whether you celebrate
[35:46] it or not. And there's multiple people
[35:48] that don't in no fashion at all.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; At least not this time of year.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's just look in our Matthew
[35:57] 1 and we we're going to read the
[35:59] Christmas story and get into some some
[36:02] history and some facts and and uh here
[36:05] Matthew 1:18. It said, "Now the birth of
[36:07] Jesus Christ was on this wise that when
[36:09] the mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph
[36:12] before they had come together that she
[36:14] was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
[36:16] And then Joseph being before them
[36:20] together. Uh uh sorry. And then Joseph
[36:22] her husband being a just man and not
[36:24] willing to make her a public example was
[36:26] mindful to put her away privately.
[36:30] 20 And while he thought on these things,
[36:32] behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to
[36:34] him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son
[36:37] of David, fear not to take Mary thy
[36:39] wife, for what is conceived in her is of
[36:43] the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring
[36:46] forth a son, and thou shalt call his
[36:48] name Jesus,
[36:50] and he shall save his people
[36:54] &gt;&gt; from their sins.
[36:57] And the last part of verse 23, and they
[36:59] called his name Emmanuel, which being
[37:02] interpreted
[37:03] is God with us. And we know as we serve
[37:06] God, and we know this in the message
[37:08] that we're not serving God in a manger.
[37:11] God is not in a manger. He's not a baby.
[37:14] God is real today. He came down in our
[37:16] age. And and he is our headship. Amen.
[37:20] And he is uh Jehovah Gyra.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; And but this is the truth. and part of
[37:26] the scriptures. Let's look in our
[37:28] scripture Ephesians and we're just
[37:30] laying a a little bit of a foundation.
[37:32] You know, when my studying this week, uh
[37:35] there's a great amount of studying you
[37:37] could go into. Brother Bam mentioned
[37:38] somebody that was preaching an
[37:40] evangelist and he really liked them. I
[37:42] don't have my Bible. I just I'm
[37:43] preaching on my iPad this morning. But
[37:45] the man said, you know, he said if it
[37:47] wasn't sacriiggious, he said, I would
[37:49] take my Bible and I would put it on the
[37:51] floor and I would stand on my Bible.
[37:54] And he said, "Because the Bible says
[37:55] that heaven and earth will pass away.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; But the only thing that will never pass
[38:00] away is God's word.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; God's written word will never pass
[38:04] away." And brother Bram says, he says,
[38:06] "I like that.
[38:08] I like that because it's truth." Amen.
[38:11] And so here we see in 1 Thessalonians 5
[38:14] 20 and 22 why why I'm going into this
[38:16] I'm going to show you some truths of the
[38:19] Bible and of brother Brandham that it's
[38:24] fine if anybody does it fine. You can
[38:26] cherrypick all you want the Bible andor
[38:30] the message
[38:32] and that's between you and God but it
[38:34] won't clear you on that day. 1
[38:36] Thessalonians 5:20 says, "Despise not
[38:40] prophecy.
[38:42] Prove all things. Hold fast to that
[38:44] which is good.
[38:46] Abstain from the very appearance
[38:50] of evil."
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Hosea here the next one. And I'm going
[38:54] to, you know, in the new year I'm going
[38:55] to preach on this. I was talking to
[38:57] somebody about this and I'm I'm going to
[38:59] do a message on this. I believe if God
[39:01] will let me. A lot of times messages
[39:03] come, you know, weeks ahead of time. But
[39:06] Hosea, I think I'm saying that right.
[39:10] 4:6, my people are destroyed
[39:14] for lack of knowledge.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Because thou has rejected knowledge,
[39:20] I will reject thee. Now, that doesn't
[39:23] matter to me if you believe that part of
[39:25] the scripture or not, but I do.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; I do. Now, God won't hold you
[39:31] accountable. We preach that about grace.
[39:33] God won't hold people accountable that
[39:35] haven't been blessed with the knowledge,
[39:37] revelation, or insight of what we have
[39:41] been. But if you ever hear the truth and
[39:44] you turn it down, that's called
[39:45] iniquity.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And iniquity is to know to do right and
[39:49] do it not.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; This is to know the truth. Now, a
[39:53] perfect example of this that I just
[39:55] totally don't understand. and and and
[39:57] I'm I'm just Brother Dale, so I'm
[39:59] preaching what God
[40:02] gives me is I don't understand this why
[40:05] people go to Starbucks
[40:12] &gt;&gt; because and I and I'm going to tell you
[40:13] something. One of my favorite ministers
[40:15] is Osman Bartley and I was telling him
[40:17] my revelation on this and he he he
[40:20] couldn't believe it. He said he like he
[40:23] looked at me like, "Are you sure?" And I
[40:26] just took my phone and I just Googled it
[40:28] like that and in 5 seconds I had it. The
[40:30] CEO of Starbucks says he don't want
[40:32] anybody to come in our store and we
[40:34] don't want no money from anybody that's
[40:37] in or believes in a conventional
[40:39] marriage of a man and a woman. Now, what
[40:43] in the world is message believers doing
[40:45] sitting in a Starbucks when it was based
[40:48] on sex and paganism and their very
[40:52] symbol is the woman in the act
[40:56] &gt;&gt; and the CEO you can Google says we don't
[40:59] want your money.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? I'm just going to tell
[41:03] you brother Dale's opinion. They won't
[41:05] have to worry about getting any of mine
[41:08] &gt;&gt; cuz I would die of thirst and hunger
[41:10] both before I went to one.
[41:12] Yeah,
[41:14] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Because see, my people are destroyed for
[41:18] lack of knowledge.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; But because they reject knowledge, I
[41:23] will reject thee. That's like the the
[41:26] another example to show you this
[41:27] scripture powerfully is the uh power aid
[41:31] drinks.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; The power drinks are all the they have
[41:35] the upside down broken cross of
[41:37] Christianity. The symbol on the power
[41:39] eight drinks is the 666, the mark of the
[41:41] beast. The everything on that can
[41:45] everything on that can is to blaspheme
[41:48] Christ.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Sure is.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; And
[41:54] you have to either be illiterate
[41:58] or unconverted to buy power aid.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; You have to be monster drink. Sorry.
[42:08] Yeah.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, that's right.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; My people are destroyed for lack of
[42:14] knowledge. Amen. God won't smile at
[42:16] these if we know the truth. Cuz see,
[42:19] Satan is going about like a roaring lion
[42:21] seeking whom he may devour.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And and you can be fun. You know, you
[42:26] can be worshiping Satan thinking you're
[42:28] worshiping God.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; And that quote that we put up there and
[42:41] you you don't you can or whatever Vicki
[42:43] the but later down in that quote,
[42:45] Brother Bram said, "You can tell your
[42:47] kids whatever you want about Santa
[42:48] Claus, but my Bible says that you
[42:51] shouldn't be a liar."
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm not going to be caught
[42:55] lying to my kids cuz someday they'll
[42:57] come to you and say, well, is Jesus just
[42:59] like Santa Claus? He ain't really real
[43:01] either."
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what your prophet said.
[43:04] Now, if we get into Matthew 5:17 and 20,
[43:07] he said, "Think not that I came to
[43:09] destroy the law or the prophets, for I
[43:12] came to destroy them, not but to fulfill
[43:15] them."
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; And verily I say unto you, till heaven
[43:19] and earth pass away, not one Watch this
[43:21] now, you need to catch. Oh, now Vicki,
[43:23] don't she's not printing my my my
[43:25] scriptures right off my iPad, but it
[43:27] says not one jot right in the middle.
[43:31] Heaven and earth will pass away. But not
[43:33] one jot,
[43:35] not one title,
[43:37] &gt;&gt; tit shall in any wise pass from the law
[43:41] until it be fulfilled. Now I want to
[43:44] show you this. And brother Brown says
[43:47] every part of God's scripture
[43:50] &gt;&gt; is true.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Including the commas.
[44:02] And whosoever so therefore shall break
[44:04] one of these least comments these least
[44:07] comments
[44:09] and shall teach men so they shall be
[44:12] called the least of the kingdom of
[44:14] heaven. But whosoever shall do and teach
[44:18] them the same shall be called great in
[44:20] the kingdom of heaven. and verse 20. For
[44:22] I say unto you that
[44:25] except your righteousness shall exceed
[44:27] the righteousness of the scribes and
[44:29] Pharisee, you shall in no wise enter the
[44:32] kingdom of heaven.
[44:36] So here in Matthew, here's Jesus himself
[44:39] showing us that all of God's written
[44:43] word of the prophecies in the Bible are
[44:45] true. Now watch how brother Brandham
[44:46] answers this. He says in questions and
[44:49] answers 62, he says, "Every word that
[44:51] you speak in the Bible, you you speak in
[44:54] your Bible, the Lord, we punctuate it
[44:57] with an amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; We believe every word of it. And we
[45:02] teach it just the best of our knowledge,
[45:05] just the way it's written. Every
[45:07] punctuation, every
[45:10] &gt;&gt; hyphen, thank you. And every period, and
[45:12] every comma, JUST THE WAY it's written,
[45:15] to the best of our knowledge." NOW THIS
[45:17] IS YOUR prophet talking about the Bible.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Whether you believe that is completely
[45:23] your choice
[45:25] &gt;&gt; here in another one in perseverance he
[45:28] said then when the word then the Bible
[45:31] is either the word or it isn't. And if
[45:33] it's the word and it's got to be
[45:35] produced everything that it promised.
[45:38] Amen. We believe that everything that's
[45:41] in the Bible is for our church.
[45:43] And if it isn't, then then which is
[45:46] right and which is wrong? Which one you
[45:49] want to take out?
[45:52] &gt;&gt; You see, it's all God's word or to me,
[45:56] none of it is.
[46:00] None or all one. So I believe it. Every
[46:03] punctuation, every line, every
[46:06] punctuation, every comma, every hyphen,
[46:09] I believe the whole thing is the word of
[46:12] God. And brother Bram saying, "And I
[46:14] hang my soul
[46:16] &gt;&gt; on it."
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I I want to give you a disclaimer.
[46:19] I don't I don't mean you, but I said
[46:21] many people don't do that.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Many people don't do that. Like I I I'm
[46:26] just I'm just GOING TO JUST JUMP OUT OF
[46:28] THE BOX for a minute. The Bible says the
[46:30] borrower is the slave to the lender.
[46:33] THAT'S STILL THE TRUTH.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, I don't know how you would buy a
[46:37] house without borrowing money,
[46:39] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE STILL THEIR SLAVE. IF YOU
[46:42] WANT TO JUST JUMP out of that
[46:43] paraphrase, I'm just finishing paying
[46:45] the mortgage on my home farm and so I
[46:47] dropped the insurance on my house.
[46:50] Who do you think called me?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible
[46:56] said, "Hey, Dell, we got a notice from
[46:58] your insurance company. You dropped your
[47:00] fire insurance."
[47:02] They said, "Yeah, I did."
[47:05] They said, "But our law."
[47:09] Oh, they have a law.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; They said our law is
[47:14] Now listen,
[47:18] my mortgage is about the size of a car
[47:20] loan on my home farm.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Now, my land with the house and not all
[47:24] tore down is worth like,
[47:27] let me see, eight times what I would owe
[47:29] them.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; If you owe me a hundred bucks, you're
[47:34] insuring that house.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, the borrower is the slave to
[47:40] the lender. That you might not like
[47:42] that, BUT THAT'S STILL ACTUALLY THE
[47:44] TRUTH. IF SOMEBODY gives you money, they
[47:46] get to dictate what you do and how you
[47:49] do that money.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; AND SO, IF YOU CAME FROM GOD AND YOU'RE
[47:53] A PART OF GOD, God gets to dictate your
[47:55] actions.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S JUST A NO-BRAINER. AND AND
[48:00] THE WORLDLY SYSTEM HAS NO PROBLEM
[48:02] calling you. Yes,
[48:04] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY, "BUT I ONLY HAVE A LITTLE
[48:06] BIT OF PROBLEM. I ONLY HAVE A TEENY
[48:09] MORTGAGE."
[48:10] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; They'll say, "But the letter says,
[48:16] &gt;&gt; "Ensure your house."
[48:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Well, here just to lay a foundation and
[48:24] and and listen, all these quotes I could
[48:27] have gave you doubled. I didn't cherry
[48:29] pick. There's there's multiple, but I I
[48:31] do want to maybe finish today. He said
[48:33] when we get one absolute and that's the
[48:36] word of God, the living word of God. He
[48:39] said by God's word, God's absolute is
[48:43] his word. And when we got one absolute,
[48:46] that's the word. Oh, sorry. I'm
[48:48] repeating that.
[48:51] Next paragraph,
[48:53] an absolute. I I forgot to erase that
[48:55] one cuz I had two lines in one message.
[48:59] Sorry. And now if he's OUR ABSOLUTE,
[49:02] THERE'S NO OTHER ABSOLUTE.
[49:05] If Christ is your absolute, you believe
[49:07] Christ the word.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm just going to step out of
[49:12] this just for a second because people
[49:14] challenge Brother Brown. They go,
[49:16] "Brother Brown like this message is the
[49:19] Bible revealed."
[49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; It But it's not the Bible.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; But it is the Bible. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible so you can understand it.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand the Bible before.
[49:32] Nobody did.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; God had sealed it up. There's no
[49:36] theologian understood the Bible. So God
[49:38] sent a prophet to take the mysteries. I
[49:41] will do nothing. Amos 3:8. I will do
[49:43] nothing except I reveal my secrets to
[49:46] the servants, the prophets.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And those secrets were the mysteries
[49:50] that are revealed. They open their eyes
[49:51] and go, "Oh, praise God." That's cuz he
[49:54] loves you.
[49:56] Amen. But people came to brother
[49:58] Brandham and he said, you know, and
[49:59] brother Bham's message is nothing but
[50:01] the truth. And they said, but you could
[50:03] write another book of Acts or
[50:05] Revelation. And brother Bham said, if I
[50:07] did that, God would take my name out of
[50:08] the Lamb's book of life. And so people
[50:11] that come up and they say, "Well, I only
[50:13] need to preach from the message books
[50:14] and we don't need the Bible no more."
[50:16] They're pagan
[50:19] &gt;&gt; because brother Bam said dozens of times
[50:22] that my words I think about 36 that my
[50:25] words will fail or can fail. But let's
[50:28] read the anointed word of God because
[50:29] they'll never fail.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. See when Paul watch this. Paul
[50:39] saidf follow me as I follow Christ. I
[50:43] want to show you something. We don't
[50:45] follow Paul as he was following Paul
[50:47] when he was killing the Christians,
[50:51] &gt;&gt; you know. So some people when they look
[50:53] at Chris I mean I mean this this is
[50:55] going to be the worst thing I say the
[50:56] whole message. So just for those of you
[50:59] are nervous plug your ears.
[51:01] But those of you or or those of anybody
[51:05] that would say, "Well, this is what
[51:08] brother Brandham did, but he but he this
[51:13] I want to tell you something. That's
[51:15] thinner broth
[51:17] than a chicken that starved to death."
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Because brother Bram took a rifle loaded
[51:26] and was a cracked shot and pointed at
[51:28] that three boys and would have killed
[51:29] them. That's right.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; We going to do that.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, when he was suffering
[51:35] from the death of his wife and his
[51:37] little girl, pulled off his mitt and
[51:39] grabbed an electrical wire that would
[51:41] have blew his body to smither rings.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Because he was in grieving.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; So don't tell me that brother Brham did
[51:51] it. So it's okay. Watch the scripture.
[51:54] Paul said, "Follow me
[51:56] &gt;&gt; as I follow Christ." Brother Brennham
[51:59] said the same thing. He said, "If you
[52:01] can't find it in the word of God, just
[52:03] sit lay it aside. Lay it aside." Brother
[52:06] Brennham, he loved hunting. He You don't
[52:08] have to go to the Rocky Mountains and
[52:10] hunt like Brother Bam. You don't have to
[52:11] buy a big bump buckle, have a cap and
[52:14] wear the same uh you know uh you know,
[52:16] briefcase that Brother Brham had. Maybe
[52:19] you won't. He said see is if what I say
[52:22] is in the Bible follow and it is but
[52:25] brother Brennham was a HUMAN BEING.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; HE LIKED FORD. SO ANYBODY THAT'S DRIVING
[52:31] something different than for
[52:33] sorry
[52:35] &gt;&gt; no no that was the flesh side.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; But brother Brown was God's chosen man
[52:44] of the hour for this age
[52:46] &gt;&gt; to reveal the mysteries of the Bible.
[52:50] But he also was a person. He said, "You
[52:52] know, I like cherry pie. My wife likes
[52:55] something else, but we still get along."
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Wow. That's a mystery.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our next quote. So, we just
[53:12] we laid that down. So, this is where
[53:14] people and and it's and and I like I
[53:17] said, I'm just it doesn't matter to me
[53:19] where you are. I'm just preaching the
[53:21] word.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham preached one thing, and I
[53:26] don't I don't know how to say this
[53:28] exactly, but I I hope you won't leave
[53:31] the church over this, but brother Brown
[53:33] preached the truth,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; but there were things he lived
[53:37] differently.
[53:40] Yeah, that's true.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I don't mean he was a hypocrite.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I just mean he was a human.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I don't mean he was hypocrite. I just
[53:52] mean he was a human. Brother Bram said
[53:54] something like this. He, you know,
[53:55] believe me, I have studied this
[53:58] tremendously.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, when you're looking
[54:01] at Christmas, remember the children.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And he goes all into this a huge amount
[54:08] behind the pulpit.
[54:10] I I' I'd like some people to hear this
[54:12] quote
[54:14] &gt;&gt; that that that have problem with
[54:16] children. And he goes into all this
[54:18] about how children love Christmas.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And then he says something. He says,
[54:25] "Just remember, just remember, Jared,
[54:28] you were a child once, too."
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Just remember, you were five once, too.
[54:37] Yeah.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I done forgot that a long time ago.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; You see,
[54:44] &gt;&gt; sometimes we forget our Just remember
[54:47] you used to wake up mom and daddy too
[54:49] when you were getting
[54:51] &gt;&gt; a bone arrow.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, it just gives us help us to
[54:58] understand that we're not all at the
[55:01] same age of stiff bones and sore
[55:03] muscles. Yeah.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; And believe me, I'm that was for me and
[55:11] Lyn.
[55:12] Wow. We were hanging up these Christmas
[55:14] lights and uh or what? Not Christmas,
[55:18] whatever these lights are. Maybe they
[55:20] are Christmas lights. They're going to
[55:21] stay up year round. But and I needed a
[55:25] massage therapist after I get done
[55:27] climbing the step ladder. I thought
[55:28] sake's alive. I used to make a living
[55:30] climbing ladders. Anyway, amen. things
[55:34] change. Amen. Watch here in our our
[55:36] quote here. He said, "How far have they
[55:38] missed the meaning of Christmas?" And he
[55:40] said, "It's become a commercial act."
[55:43] Now, that don't mean that it has to you
[55:45] or to me. We're talking very general
[55:48] here, but the kids need to the I'm going
[55:51] to hit some facts on on Christmas that
[55:53] the kids need to know that everybody
[55:56] around you is doing this and it's okay
[55:58] if you're their friend. I do not condemn
[56:01] it. You will but you don't have you need
[56:05] to know the truth.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; You don't you need to know the truth.
[56:10] All the holidays have become that
[56:12] mother's day and father's day and you
[56:15] know these are mother's day should be
[56:17] every day of the year but every day
[56:19] ought to be mother's day and father's
[56:20] day but they made Easter Santa Clauses
[56:23] took the birthplace and rabbits and
[56:24] chickens. Do you know I I I know
[56:26] churches that actually have EASTER EGG
[56:29] HUNTS ON SUNDAY MORNING.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And they go outside the sanctuary and
[56:37] the
[56:40] &gt;&gt; and many of them
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm online so I you you would be blown
[56:46] away. Now a painted Easter egg coming
[56:49] out of a bunny rabbit has got what to do
[56:51] with Jesus and the resurrection?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, that's just blight and
[56:56] lies.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; That's just blight and lies. We just got
[57:00] to be truthful.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Santa Claus don't know if you're naughty
[57:04] or nice.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; And he don't know my house address. And
[57:08] he cannot fit down my chimney. And he
[57:10] does not eat the cookies and milk that
[57:11] that's left on the table that aren't
[57:13] left there.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Those are lies.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Those are bllightened lies. Don't go
[57:23] there with your kids.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in it.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; You can still have a big meal. I believe
[57:31] that you should celebrate Jesus Christ
[57:33] and your family and friends and have
[57:37] good fellowship and eat a lot and and
[57:40] and and be thankful and and all this
[57:43] thing, but there's a place THAT YOU
[57:45] CAN'T GO.
[57:47] Y
[57:49] that's right.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Santa Claus has took the birthplace and
[57:53] rabbits and chickens and little ducks
[57:54] have took the resurrection time and it's
[57:56] all about chickens and ducks and eggs
[57:58] and that's what's that got to do with
[58:00] the resurrection. See, it's too bad that
[58:02] we put this before our children.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And many times little boys out here
[58:09] tonight and you tell them they know more
[58:12] about David Crockett. That that's
[58:14] terrible. Nothing wrong with David
[58:16] Crockett, but do they know about the 12
[58:19] disciples,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; you know? Do they know do they know how
[58:23] to sing godly songs?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Do they know anything about the Bible?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; By the way, we're going to the church or
[58:34] somebody or I or somebody's going to I
[58:36] know somebody that wrote a a a family
[58:39] devotions for for parents with small
[58:41] kids. John Garrick did and it's on
[58:44] Amazon and every one of the families
[58:46] that's got small children in this church
[58:48] is going to have one if it comes from
[58:50] the church or comes from me. Amen.
[58:53] That's God's word. You're to you're to
[58:56] raise up in the morning and plant God's
[58:58] word in their minds.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Not lies.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you watch parents, they will
[59:07] dress up their kids in Davy Crockett
[59:09] clothes and sell them and all this. And
[59:11] if you and if we could just take the
[59:13] program of Christ over the people like
[59:16] that. And usually you try to impersonate
[59:18] what you read. What you feed your kids
[59:23] is what they'll live.
[59:25] Amen.
[59:27] So let's go to our next scripture.
[59:29] Jeremiah 10 1:5. And this is the one
[59:31] that makes everyone so nervous. And and
[59:34] I hope you're not nervous,
[59:37] but Jeremiah was actually a legitimate
[59:39] prophet of God.
[59:41] And most people don't believe this and
[59:43] don't believe it applies today. But I
[59:45] want to show you just maybe before we
[59:47] read this scripture. You know, when I
[59:48] preached on Christmas back in the house,
[59:51] we can I preached on I did major study
[59:55] on it. Science, the pagan roots, the
[59:58] surprising facts of Christmas.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Anybody that wants these, I can print
[1:00:02] them off for you. The history of
[1:00:04] Christmas and the Christmas tree and
[1:00:05] Christmas wreaths. Google. Google.
[1:00:09] People actually know this from Google.
[1:00:12] Here, here's another one. I I got these
[1:00:14] folded over so I can Here's what's the
[1:00:16] title of this one from Google. All about
[1:00:18] Christmas trees, the pagan organs, the
[1:00:21] Christian adoption, and the solar the
[1:00:23] solless. The sun's burning out. Here's a
[1:00:27] to-do farms. The history of the
[1:00:29] Christmas tree.
[1:00:31] You know, if if Google knows all about
[1:00:33] this, shouldn't the message believers
[1:00:34] know about it?
[1:00:36] Yeah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Whether you have whatever you have,
[1:00:40] that's your business. And I hear the
[1:00:42] word of the Lord that spake unto you in
[1:00:44] the house of O Israel. Thus sayaith the
[1:00:47] Lord, learn not the way of the heathens,
[1:00:50] and be not dismayed that the signs of
[1:00:52] the heavens, for the heathens are
[1:00:54] dismayed at them.
[1:00:57] For the customs of the people are vain,
[1:00:59] and they are one that cutth down a tree
[1:01:01] in the forest, and workketh the hands of
[1:01:03] a workman, with an axe, and they deck it
[1:01:06] with silver and gold, and they fasten it
[1:01:08] with nails, and with hammers, that it
[1:01:10] move not,
[1:01:12] and they are upright as a palm tree, but
[1:01:15] speak not, and they must be born,
[1:01:18] because they cannot go. Be not afraid of
[1:01:23] them, for they cannot do evil. Neither
[1:01:26] also is it in them. Neither also is it
[1:01:31] in them.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Neither also is it in them. My old
[1:01:35] record player stuck on a crack. Neither
[1:01:37] is it also in them
[1:01:41] to do good.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody just bumped me out of the
[1:01:44] crack. Remember those old records? You
[1:01:46] know?
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:48] Yes.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Watch what your prophet said about it.
[1:01:52] He said, "And give us the spirit, the
[1:01:54] true spirit of Christmas, and today
[1:01:57] that when the pagan celebrations and
[1:02:00] Christmas tree worshiped and friction
[1:02:03] fiction stories, a man named Santa Claus
[1:02:06] and of our Easter bunnies that have
[1:02:09] eggs, that's a special bunny, and
[1:02:12] different fashions
[1:02:14] and that commercial world has
[1:02:15] capitalized on. May it be laid aside
[1:02:21] for God.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Another one. But when Christians,
[1:02:26] Christianity was brought into Romanism
[1:02:30] and it mixed with Dioa.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; And then they had the sun god Jupiter.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; And the sun god of Rome. And the
[1:02:39] birthday that was the the birthday was
[1:02:42] actually December 21st maybe to 22nd.
[1:02:47] Yeah.
[1:02:49] And the Roman
[1:02:52] stated that on the 21st lasted till the
[1:02:55] 25th to celebrate the sun god. And here
[1:02:58] we see here blending Romanism
[1:03:02] with paganism to Christianize.
[1:03:06] Let us make the son of God's birthday.
[1:03:09] And they agreed on it. It's always been
[1:03:11] a symbol of compromising of the truth.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Every
[1:03:20] time
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; it's always been. Now, we we you have
[1:03:24] your own thoughts on Romanism and the
[1:03:26] Catholic Church and all this, but many
[1:03:29] people that believe that don't believe
[1:03:31] this.
[1:03:34] There's not one speck, ditto, or dot of
[1:03:38] God in the Roman Catholic church.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; That's pagan and false
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; from the beginning to the end.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; God help us. 1 Thessalonians 5 4 and 6
[1:03:59] and 20 and 22.
[1:04:02] But ye he But ye, brethren, are not in
[1:04:06] darkness,
[1:04:08] that the light shall overtake you as a
[1:04:10] thief. Ye are children all of the light,
[1:04:13] and the and the children of the day, and
[1:04:16] ye shall not of the night, nor of the
[1:04:18] darkness. Therefore, let us not sleep as
[1:04:23] others, but let us watch and be sober.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Here, watch what it says here. Now I
[1:04:31] read this before.
[1:04:33] Despise not prophecies.
[1:04:37] Prove all things.
[1:04:39] Hold fast to that which is good.
[1:04:43] And abstain
[1:04:47] from the very appearance
[1:04:49] of evil. Here we go look into another
[1:04:52] example here that our prophet said. He
[1:04:55] said this was questions and answers. He
[1:04:57] said, "What about a Christmas play in a
[1:05:00] Holy Ghost church?"
[1:05:03] He said, "Well, if it was about Christ,
[1:05:06] it might be all right. I would be
[1:05:09] delighted if you sisters did a play with
[1:05:12] all our kids." We have more children in
[1:05:13] this church than we have adults, I
[1:05:16] think. And you did a play of the Bible
[1:05:19] scene and the birth of Christ. It
[1:05:22] involves the kids and and it's
[1:05:24] beautiful. Amen. And it's also Bible and
[1:05:26] scriptural.
[1:05:27] He said, "If it was about Christ, it
[1:05:30] would be all right. But if it was about
[1:05:32] Santa Claus, I don't believe in him. I
[1:05:35] done ground away from that. I don't
[1:05:38] believe in Santa Claus at all."
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Some of these little Christmas things
[1:05:44] they have, I think, are
[1:05:47] ridiculous.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:50] But I think they took Christ out of
[1:05:52] Christmas and put in Santa Claus. And
[1:05:55] Santa Claus is a fiction story. And I
[1:05:57] said, I don't mean to be hurting your
[1:05:59] feelings and I hope about the children,
[1:06:01] but I'll tell you here a long time ago,
[1:06:03] 25, 30 years ago when a minister was
[1:06:06] here and had a big paper and he said, "I
[1:06:09] know this real well." He's a bruising
[1:06:12] friend of mine.
[1:06:15] He said, "I'll tell you my kids. I have
[1:06:18] grandkids and I told them that lie no
[1:06:22] more. He said, "My own little kids
[1:06:24] walked up to me after they got about 20
[1:06:26] years old talking about Santa Claus and
[1:06:27] they said, "Why honey? I got something
[1:06:30] to tell you."
[1:06:33] He said after he came back, he said,
[1:06:34] "Daddy, is Jesus fake too?"
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Here the last paragraph of this answer,
[1:06:40] he says, "Tell them the truth.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Santa Claus is a Catholic. Get up about
[1:06:48] a fellow Christian Chris
[1:06:53] Giggles
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Gringles St. Nicholas and it's a German
[1:06:59] Catholic saint from many years
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; doing good. Jesus is the son of God
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; and he really lives
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; and is real.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our kids need to know this. I want
[1:07:15] I want I I I'm not going to be long this
[1:07:18] morning, but I I do have some things on
[1:07:19] my paper here. Things
[1:07:22] he said.
[1:07:24] Now notice
[1:07:26] that our next paragraph he said, Nian
[1:07:28] Council and Ro gave gave it to the
[1:07:31] denominations decrees. They accepted the
[1:07:33] drama dramas instead of the word to take
[1:07:37] down the pagan idols like Jupiter and so
[1:07:40] forth.
[1:07:42] And they changed the birthday from Jesus
[1:07:44] from April to where all nature is born.
[1:07:49] And they changed that up to the sun god
[1:07:51] birthday to the solar system. And it's
[1:07:53] just about one minute different than the
[1:07:55] day that would pass from the 25th to the
[1:07:58] 21st.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And every of us play Santa Claus and
[1:08:03] decorate trees, a heathenism,
[1:08:06] things like that. And they call
[1:08:08] themselves Christians.
[1:08:11] What's the matter with the Christian
[1:08:16] church?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I I would just put a disclaimer
[1:08:21] here. And some of these, not all of
[1:08:23] them, but that one is well after the
[1:08:26] seals.
[1:08:29] That's a year before he was killed.
[1:08:32] Santa Claus took the place of Christ.
[1:08:34] And Santa Claus, there never was such a
[1:08:37] person. It's absolutely a Catholic
[1:08:39] tradition.
[1:08:40] And not anything to do with Protestant
[1:08:43] or anything about it. See Chris or
[1:08:45] Christmas or the birth of Christ. Not at
[1:08:47] all. Not. But Santa Claus is here to
[1:08:51] stay.
[1:08:53] Another one. He said, "We oughtn't to
[1:08:55] have anything to do with Santa Claus and
[1:08:59] things."
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Next one. What kind of worship can you
[1:09:05] get at a church that knows so little
[1:09:08] about God that they put up Santa Claus
[1:09:11] and Easter bunnies in the church?
[1:09:15] Where did they get that? They got it
[1:09:16] from the pagan and made it part of the
[1:09:19] church doctrine. But when it turns, the
[1:09:21] Lord is full of the Holy Ghost. He'll
[1:09:24] cease from all such things and his soul
[1:09:28] will rest
[1:09:30] beginning to love and worship God.
[1:09:33] Yeah.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; What's the more of a myth of Santa
[1:09:36] Claus? Never such a thing. Telling your
[1:09:39] kids lies. You'll be responsible in the
[1:09:43] day of judgment.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; For lying.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Get away from the tinsel of Santa Claus
[1:09:51] and get back to the gift of God and back
[1:09:54] to the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:57] where Satan has robbed all of us of this
[1:10:00] is made a great commercial Santa Claus
[1:10:02] and stole all
[1:10:04] the worship.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And it's become a day of Easter bunny
[1:10:09] rabbits and pink ducks.
[1:10:12] What's that got to do with Easter and
[1:10:15] the resurrection of Christ? Yeah,
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; but the birthday of Christ I believe
[1:10:23] should be a day consecrated consecration
[1:10:28] and worship
[1:10:31] instead of tonight people in church on
[1:10:34] their knees praying and thanking God for
[1:10:37] the real Christmas
[1:10:39] gift.
[1:10:41] Amen.
[1:10:44] I I know you adults know this, but I got
[1:10:46] grandkids here that have never heard
[1:10:48] this preached.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; ever.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Ever.
[1:10:58] Cuz I've never preached it since I Felix
[1:11:01] were small in the house church.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] I want to show you some
[1:11:09] uh Google facts
[1:11:11] of some of the things that go on in our
[1:11:14] lifestyle here. And we might come back
[1:11:17] to these quotes. We're not we're not I'm
[1:11:18] not going to hold you long. I know I I
[1:11:21] hope I'm not borrowing some of you,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; but uh
[1:11:26] it was Queen Charlotte that introduced
[1:11:29] the tradition in the royal court to her
[1:11:32] granddaughter, Queen Victoria.
[1:11:36] And it was her German husband that was
[1:11:39] Prince Albert.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And the first Christmas tree that ever
[1:11:44] hit England was 1848.
[1:11:49] Yeah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And her German king
[1:11:52] was pagan.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; But the Queen Charlotte, her husband was
[1:11:59] King George III, who married Queen
[1:12:02] Charlotte, German born Queen, accredited
[1:12:05] with bringing the first Christmas tree
[1:12:07] to England in the 16th century.
[1:12:15] And it used to be a yew tree which was
[1:12:19] just a branch
[1:12:21] and it later become a whole tree. And
[1:12:23] they put the first tree up in the 1800s
[1:12:26] in December in the Windsor Queen Lodge
[1:12:30] in a children's party.
[1:12:33] 1800s.
[1:12:37] Amen. Remember this has this has no
[1:12:41] eternity attached to it. It had a
[1:12:43] beginning.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something here. Just
[1:12:47] Google.
[1:12:49] He says pagan. Many pagans
[1:12:54] celebrate a Christmas tree in December
[1:12:57] and decorate them and still do this.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And they recognize the winner solus. So
[1:13:05] am I saying that right? Sultus.
[1:13:15] And you they recognize and this is what
[1:13:18] the reefs I you need to know the truth.
[1:13:20] Whatever you do is besides this.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; But the reason for this was they
[1:13:25] believed the sun was burning out.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I want you I I I can read it better.
[1:13:35] Th this this the sun thing. They noticed
[1:13:37] that the days were gradually getting
[1:13:39] shorter and they feared the sun would
[1:13:41] eventually disappear forever and
[1:13:44] everyone would freeze in the dark and
[1:13:46] through this dedication of trees and
[1:13:49] branches and crops would die. And even
[1:13:52] some of their their pagan gods were gods
[1:13:54] of fertilization because of the crops
[1:13:57] and the Christmas reef. when they
[1:14:00] started putting the Christmas wreath on
[1:14:01] the door was to ward out the evil
[1:14:04] spirits of the darkness so they wouldn't
[1:14:06] come into your house.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; It was greenery.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; It's all pagan.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; All pagan.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:21] And they thought that it had magical
[1:14:24] powers
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; that would enable to withstand
[1:14:31] the rigorous winter.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; The first occasion of Christmas trees
[1:14:38] was the Greek and they worshiped the god
[1:14:40] and I couldn't even tell you all these
[1:14:42] gods names.
[1:14:46] an ancient pagan Roman dedicated their
[1:14:48] trees with bits and different things
[1:14:51] here. And the fertiliz the the fertiliz
[1:14:54] gods, they were all they had 12 gods.
[1:14:57] And they normally would put 12 candles
[1:14:59] on the tree
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; all represented
[1:15:04] pagan
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; pagan
[1:15:07] pagan.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And this normally I want to show you
[1:15:14] something here. I missed something here.
[1:15:19] It wasn't until 1840 that the first
[1:15:22] pagan tree was accepted normally in
[1:15:26] England.
[1:15:28] And write this on Google. They said it
[1:15:30] was highly unaccepted
[1:15:33] by the majority
[1:15:35] of Christians. I got another thing to I
[1:15:38] might not find it here exactly, but
[1:15:42] Christmas trees
[1:15:45] were against the law. I actually have it
[1:15:47] on my phone. I actually have the
[1:15:50] newspaper printing print out says notice
[1:15:53] public
[1:15:55] public notice forbidden
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; forbidden.
[1:16:03] It was against the law to have a
[1:16:05] Christmas tree in the states until 1681.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Federal
[1:16:14] offense.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:24] But because of
[1:16:27] Catholicism wanting to join with the
[1:16:30] pagan rather than fight them, they
[1:16:32] compromise all the truth
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; of Jehovah. Do you notice that they
[1:16:38] never took the April birthday,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; but they took the December 21st
[1:16:43] birthday?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who had the priority
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; on the picking?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] The kids need to know the truth. The
[1:16:55] truth of this here.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; The Roman Catholic Church and the
[1:17:00] customs of the pagan was tra
[1:17:02] traditionally helped to converting the
[1:17:05] northern
[1:17:07] German peoples. It's it's actually
[1:17:10] Germanetic people
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and the pre-existing all these gods
[1:17:18] and Rome just said, "Oh, just bring all
[1:17:20] your gods, fill up our churches."
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; we have no problem.
[1:17:33] There was the help in the tradition from
[1:17:36] paganism to people over to Catholicism.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; That's what Google will tell you.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Google.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Witchcraft.
[1:17:51] What's that got to do?
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; In the magnificent birth of Christ.
[1:17:59] absolutely nothing.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; So we we celebrate Christmas,
[1:18:05] but it's about Jesus Christ.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; It's about worship. It's about
[1:18:10] salvation.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] Giving gifts. That's what God gave to us
[1:18:19] was gifts.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's better to give than
[1:18:22] receive. That's good. I mean, that's
[1:18:25] good any day of the week.
[1:18:31] But God wasn't born on December 25th,
[1:18:34] kids.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; He would have froze to death.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; And bunnies don't have colored eggs.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; And a Christmas tree or a Christmas
[1:18:45] wreath has absolutely less than zero
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; to do with God.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And if you wanted to treat, you watch
[1:18:55] this. You know, if you have a brain, you
[1:18:57] can think about this. Like cutting down
[1:18:59] a tree with an axe is death. And we're
[1:19:02] celebrating a birth.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; If you want to have a tree, why wouldn't
[1:19:07] you buy a potted plant that cleans the
[1:19:10] air and bring in a live tree that's
[1:19:13] about life and resurrection and and
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; because you want to know why? Because
[1:19:22] Satan's all about death
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; and destruction.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; God actually gave us trees to clean our
[1:19:31] air. They they put out carbon dioxide
[1:19:34] and breathe in ox or they breathe in
[1:19:36] carbon dioxide. Put out oxygen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Google told me this
[1:19:43] week that MOST PEOPLE GET SICK AT
[1:19:45] Christmas because dad trees carry molds?
[1:19:50] And people realize as soon as they get
[1:19:52] rid of the the greenery in their house,
[1:19:55] they almost immediately get better
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; because they're under the stench of the
[1:20:01] mold from death.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; From death,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; saying they're celebrating life.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:20:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; To be able to
[1:20:42] be in this world and be of a sound mind.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm not going nowhere. and
[1:20:49] telling somebody that's doing something
[1:20:50] different me that they're wrong.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; That's not If they ask you what's right
[1:20:59] and wrong,
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; you're going to make lots of good
[1:21:03] enemies.
[1:21:05] If you start telling people that don't
[1:21:07] want to know what I just told you,
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; cuz see, not all people want to know the
[1:21:15] truth,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; but just for and even some online, I
[1:21:19] know I know some people online.
[1:21:23] This is religious tolerance Christmas
[1:21:26] tree. Anybody that wants this copied off
[1:21:29] history of Christmas tree facts,
[1:21:33] proven facts.
[1:21:35] Pagan worship facts of Christmas.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; You know, Noel Farms, all the history of
[1:21:43] Christmas, pagan.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something good about
[1:21:52] the internet.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; And the truth
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; shall set you free.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] Now, I actually believe
[1:22:06] I actually believe and I believe God
[1:22:08] would teach us that you have the baptism
[1:22:11] of the Holy Ghost. You can go into any
[1:22:15] place where there's a Christmas tree and
[1:22:17] your power that's on you is much
[1:22:20] stronger than any fake power of any
[1:22:24] kind. You don't have to act like you're
[1:22:27] some
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; but when you make a conscientious
[1:22:31] decision
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; to go in their camp
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and bring it into
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Christmas should be a time of worship.
[1:22:54] Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; We have beautiful Christmas songs,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have to sing. There's no
[1:23:01] reindeers that can fly.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You know, and they don't land on my
[1:23:06] rooftop cuz I have steel roof. It's very
[1:23:09] slippery.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; You know, like you see what I'm saying?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; It's all kind of But be careful. I I
[1:23:18] want to I want to I want to give you a
[1:23:20] warning.
[1:23:22] My kids have no clue
[1:23:25] what it's like to live without a cell
[1:23:28] phone and date your girlfriend without a
[1:23:31] cell phone. They think it's always been
[1:23:34] there.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; OKAY. THEY THEY ACTUALLY THINK that
[1:23:39] houses always had running water and a
[1:23:42] bathroom.
[1:23:44] Yeah.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; And you're raising your kids like they
[1:23:47] think there was always Christmas trees
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; and there was always Santa Claus.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And that's a lie.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Because it used to be illegal
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; on this continent.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That's a drastic change.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; That's a drastic change. And so when
[1:24:14] young people come up and they say, you
[1:24:16] know, we had car, you know, when me and
[1:24:18] Len died, like her car never had power
[1:24:20] steering,
[1:24:22] it was it was like you when you you you
[1:24:24] couldn't turn the wheel unless you were
[1:24:25] moving.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And our kids
[1:24:32] farm, none of the tractors had power
[1:24:34] steerings.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hydraulics. What's hydraulics? They
[1:24:39] never existed. the weight trip that and
[1:24:42] then you let it down the ground and put
[1:24:43] it back and click to the notch.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And so this is how Christmas has come in
[1:24:48] the church
[1:24:50] where it's and and watch this. We preach
[1:24:52] this. If you're going to if you're going
[1:24:54] to leave the word, we can leave it on
[1:24:56] everything.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's only one scripture
[1:25:00] in the Old Testament talks about men and
[1:25:02] women's dress wear? There's five about
[1:25:05] Christmas tree.
[1:25:07] Which prophet you want to believe? Wow.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; See, if we start removing the Bible,
[1:25:16] it's it's a very reckless slope.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:25:22] if one's real, it's all real
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; through. Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing, especially when
[1:25:30] history
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; will show you the truth.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; This ain't brother Brandham studied
[1:25:37] these things.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brown read books. He was
[1:25:41] an educated man. He was Brother Brown
[1:25:43] was a selfeducated man.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit came in and
[1:25:51] said there this is and this is the
[1:25:54] truth.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And you need to raise your kids and you
[1:26:02] know this is what's happening now. But
[1:26:04] it always wasn't like this.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:08] you know,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And the truth
[1:26:15] is still good.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And I I believe I totally believe that
[1:26:21] God loves families and God loves worship
[1:26:25] and God provided all your food and and
[1:26:29] give gifts. Always give lots of gifts.
[1:26:31] Everything is about love and kindness
[1:26:34] and grace and mercy.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:37] Yeah,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; but it never happened this time of year.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I do like all the lights because I
[1:26:44] don't like the dark.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; I don't like anything black.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And when it gets dark at 5:00 and I or
[1:26:53] 4:30 and I think 7:00's midnight and I
[1:26:56] go up to bed and then I wake up at 3:00
[1:26:58] in the night and I think my night's
[1:26:59] over, I I went to bed at 7:00. 3:00's
[1:27:02] morning time, it's still dark out and
[1:27:03] I'm like, "Oh, boys."
[1:27:08] Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; But today we bring a Christmas tree in
[1:27:20] this church. Do you know I was watching
[1:27:22] when I was studying this that there's
[1:27:24] churches in this country
[1:27:27] that are bringing in
[1:27:30] drag queens,
[1:27:32] fat old 60y old men dressed in women's
[1:27:35] clothes to talk to the church.
[1:27:40] Yeah.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; It was in Vancouver.
[1:27:44] You see, you see when you start a ball
[1:27:48] of snow and it starts rolling down the
[1:27:50] hill Yeah.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; And you start leaving the truth,
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I pray I pray with all my heart. I'm I'm
[1:28:07] definitely closing that God keeps us in
[1:28:10] the truth,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; balanced in the truth. Brother Dale
[1:28:15] don't want to be in either ditch. Yeah,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; I know we're living in the grace age.
[1:28:22] Praise God for that. And and and I
[1:28:24] believe me, I I believe that and need
[1:28:27] that more than any one of you sitting
[1:28:29] here.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; But there's things that are just plain
[1:28:33] truthful and not truthful.
[1:28:37] And I'm saying with God's help,
[1:28:43] it's worth it to me to be honest and
[1:28:47] truthful.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; I don't desire to say, "Well, you know,
[1:28:51] God changed."
[1:28:55] I don't see that.
[1:28:58] I see Hebrews 8:13
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; says that he's the same yesterday,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; today.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. and forever.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And I believe I even believe you know
[1:29:11] that every service is different but
[1:29:12] there's times where you need to teach
[1:29:15] knowledge truth
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; of the Bible and the trends of the day
[1:29:21] so the young people can put down deep
[1:29:24] roots and when they get challenged in
[1:29:27] the grocery store say why don't you do
[1:29:29] this?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; they don't have to say I don't know
[1:29:37] They can say because I know
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; why do you think God's word says study
[1:29:44] to show thyself approved?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Why do you serve God? Because it's real,
[1:29:52] truthful, and it's still alive and he's
[1:29:55] doing everything for me that I need
[1:29:58] today.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have no desire
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; to leave that. No,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; you watch how the whole trends in in
[1:30:07] holiness and and I mean we preached that
[1:30:10] before and in Christmas,
[1:30:13] you know, watch this. I I I I'm trying
[1:30:16] to close.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Where's my phone? I want to show you
[1:30:19] something.
[1:30:22] This message is the truth.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; There is nothing else.
[1:30:33] Yeah,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; hear me. You can you can do you can say
[1:30:38] anything you want. I'm going down
[1:30:39] worshiping this Bible and the revelation
[1:30:43] that this message is.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; And if we which we are are so blessed in
[1:30:52] our day
[1:30:54] to have the secrets revealed. I want to
[1:30:57] show you something. the Jehovah's
[1:31:00] Witness Church, the 7th Day Adventist,
[1:31:03] the Deeper Life Bible Church, the
[1:31:06] Mountain Five Ministry Church, the God's
[1:31:09] Kingdom Socialists.
[1:31:12] I might be saying that wrong. And the
[1:31:15] Quakers
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; know more about Christmas
[1:31:25] than message people in North America.
[1:31:29] Because none of them celebrate Christmas
[1:31:31] on December 25th. None of them celebrate
[1:31:35] Santa Claus and reindeers on roofs.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to just give you one
[1:31:42] little closeout as we close. Matter of
[1:31:45] fact, you can come, honey.
[1:31:47] If any of you come to meet with me on a
[1:31:49] mission trip and you went anywhere in
[1:31:53] this continent and England,
[1:31:56] you wouldn't even be allowed in the
[1:31:58] Well, you definitely wouldn't be
[1:32:00] speaking or singing in the church
[1:32:03] if they thought you celebrated Christmas
[1:32:06] like most people do right here.
[1:32:12] Most most most
[1:32:15] the whole continent of Africa,
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; the whole landscape of the Philippines
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; is nothing but conventions from December
[1:32:25] 24th till about January 1st or 2nd.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; You know, Pastor Vincent, he has a
[1:32:32] convention at his place. You know how
[1:32:33] long the church service was?
[1:32:39] It was from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30
[1:32:42] at night.
[1:32:44] One service
[1:32:52] and we're going to the same heaven.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; We're reading out of the same message
[1:32:57] books
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; and the same Bible.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Now, they would have a stop for dinner.
[1:33:03] Do you see the difference? When I went
[1:33:05] to the Philippines, I went to church
[1:33:08] four times.
[1:33:13] Actually, no, it wasn't in the
[1:33:14] Philippines. It was actually in Ghana.
[1:33:16] In Ghana, I went to I went to church
[1:33:18] four times on Christmas Day.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Four times.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; It was all about worshiping
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; It was all about worship. The only
[1:33:34] people in the Philippines that had a
[1:33:35] Christmas tree
[1:33:37] was the Roman Catholic Church,
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; not the Seventh Day Adventists,
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; not the Jehovah's Witness, and
[1:33:45] definitely not message people.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; The only time they had camp meetings in
[1:33:51] the Philippines was right over the
[1:33:54] Christmas holidays, Christmas and New
[1:33:56] Year's. A thousand people, totally not
[1:33:59] uncommon, in one place.
[1:34:02] Yeah.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And here in North America, when
[1:34:07] Christmas falls on sun on when Sunday
[1:34:10] falls on Christmas, there's churches
[1:34:12] right in this province that have closed
[1:34:13] their doors.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Closed their doors.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; You see, if you start going in the
[1:34:21] ditch,
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; if you start leaving the truth of the
[1:34:25] Bible,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:27] When our grandkids come up, they won't
[1:34:30] even know what they won't even
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; See, you have to hold the line.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Hold the line. Whatever you do and
[1:34:39] compromise, your kids will do in access.
[1:34:42] Hold the line. What did brother Brandham
[1:34:44] see when he seen the bride coming in
[1:34:46] from all the nations and some of the
[1:34:48] tailwind of the American, I believe it
[1:34:50] was American bride, and they started to
[1:34:51] get out of sin. He said screamed out. He
[1:34:53] said, "Hold the line. Keep your eye on
[1:34:57] Christ.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Keep your eye on Christ. That's all this
[1:35:01] message is. Keep your eye on Christ.
[1:35:04] Yes, without Christmas, there would be
[1:35:06] no salvation. Yes, the son of God came
[1:35:09] in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:35:14] And yes, he was born in a manger,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't this time of year.
[1:35:19] And it has nothing to do with all this
[1:35:21] other commercial
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; and glamour.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; If you if we were serving God like the
[1:35:30] prophet said,
[1:35:32] we would have a church service
[1:35:35] on sun on Christmas.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; God help us. God help us just to to to
[1:35:43] be truthful.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be truthful. Let's stand.
[1:35:51] Amen.
[1:35:56] Let's sing that chorus we sang before.
[1:35:58] Come let us adore. Oh come let us
[1:36:06] come let us.
[1:36:14] Oh,
[1:36:28] heat,
[1:36:33] heat.
[1:36:39] Yeah.
[1:36:41] Heat.
[1:36:59] Heat.
[1:37:11] Heat.
[1:37:20] Yeah. Heat.
[1:37:41] Yeah.
[1:37:45] Heat.
