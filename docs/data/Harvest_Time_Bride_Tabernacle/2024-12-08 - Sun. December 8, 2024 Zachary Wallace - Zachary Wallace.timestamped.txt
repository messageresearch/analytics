[23:35] promise God bless you this morning name
[23:37] is Zachary Wallace I'm from Ohio now but
[23:40] formerly from Arizona and uh run into a
[23:44] few of you through the years but uh I
[23:47] plan on spending quite a few more years
[23:48] with you later but this morning uh
[23:51] brother Nathan Erikson was supposed to
[23:54] be here and then he was going to miss
[23:55] his grandfather's U 86th birthday I
[23:58] think so you know you you got to take
[24:00] advantage of those those when you get
[24:02] older like that and so uh I'm your spare
[24:06] tire preacher today but uh we know the
[24:08] Lord Jesus is the same and so we're just
[24:10] trusting in Him this morning to to uh
[24:13] speak to us so if we could just open up
[24:15] in our Bibles to familiar portion of
[24:17] scripture here Malachi the 4th chapter
[24:21] and we will uh read a portion there and
[24:24] then also in Genesis
[24:34] Malachi chter 4 verse one for behold the
[24:38] day cometh that shall burn as an oven
[24:42] and all that proud and yay all that do
[24:44] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[24:47] that cometh shall burn them up sayith
[24:49] the Lord of hosts that it shall leave
[24:51] them neither root nor Branch but unto
[24:55] you that fear my name shall the son of
[24:58] righteousness arise with healing in his
[25:01] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[25:03] as calves of the stall and ye shall
[25:06] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[25:08] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[25:11] the day that I shall do this sayith the
[25:14] Lord of hosts remember ye the law of
[25:16] Moses my servant which I commanded unto
[25:19] him in Horeb for all Israel with the
[25:22] statutes and judgments behold I will
[25:25] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[25:27] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[25:30] the Lord and he shall turn the heart of
[25:32] the fathers to the children and the
[25:35] Heart of the children to their fathers
[25:37] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[25:40] curse now also at Genesis 19 and just to
[25:45] repeat that first line there it said for
[25:47] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[25:51] an oven so you know I it can be a little
[25:54] cold up here but friends it's going to
[25:56] get warm the day is coming when things
[25:58] are going to burn as an oven and Genesis
[26:05] 1927 we read here of
[26:09] Abraham and it says and Abraham got up
[26:12] early in the morning to the place where
[26:15] he stood before the
[26:18] Lord and he looked toward Sodom and
[26:21] Gomorrah and toward all the land of the
[26:23] plain and behold and lo the smoke of the
[26:26] country went up as the smoke of a
[26:30] furnace you can be seated this morning I
[26:34] I want to take a thought this morning on
[26:36] the Keystone of the Bible the the
[26:40] Keystone of the Bible and now a keystone
[26:45] uh how many here know what a keystone is
[26:48] in
[26:49] construction um so a keystone is say
[26:52] you're building an archway or a bridge
[26:54] and you'll start at two points and
[26:56] you'll you'll lay a brick here and then
[26:57] you'll build another one just just a
[26:58] little bit of an angle and you'll build
[26:59] it up to a certain point and you'll
[27:01] bring the other side up to a certain
[27:02] point but until the Keystone is in place
[27:05] if you put any weight on it it's not
[27:07] stable the whole thing will collapse but
[27:09] you get this Keystone it's a it's a it's
[27:11] an a bit of a pyramid wedge shaped stone
[27:14] and you put that right in the Capstone
[27:17] which is also the Keystone and it sets
[27:18] right in there and once the Keystone is
[27:20] in place it ties the two sides together
[27:24] and then once those two sides are tied
[27:25] together you can actually put a burden
[27:27] and a on there because it's stabilized
[27:29] it can carry the load and it's it's it's
[27:32] it's actually structurally uh stable now
[27:35] but without that Keystone there it's not
[27:38] tied together and things will start to
[27:40] fall apart and so I want to look at the
[27:43] the Keystone of the Bible today and and
[27:45] there's been a few different keystones
[27:47] we can look at one Keystone was John the
[27:49] Baptist he was the connection between
[27:53] the between law and Grace he was the one
[27:55] that kind of stood in that Gap and
[27:57] brother he mentions here he was the he
[27:59] was that Keystone he says what did you
[28:01] see in that Prophet I say unto you he
[28:03] was more than a prophet he was the
[28:05] bright and Shining Light he was the word
[28:07] made light he was the word manifested
[28:10] John came as a manifestation of the word
[28:12] to tie the two together between law and
[28:16] Grace and and it was that that
[28:18] connection and we see that Jesus Christ
[28:20] himself he was the Keystone of of the
[28:24] the the Old Testament and the New
[28:25] Testament tying it together in himself
[28:28] and he says here in the Rapture message
[28:30] uh says Jesus being that Keystone he
[28:32] bear record see he was the Keystone
[28:35] between the old and the New Testament
[28:36] because he had first to die and then
[28:38] Rapture he died come to life and walked
[28:42] around here with us and then he was
[28:44] raptured up because he was the Keystone
[28:47] that tied the two together and so when
[28:50] when you see a keystone it connects
[28:52] things it holds them together so that
[28:54] there's not a a separation and the
[28:57] Keystone of this Bible is what makes it
[28:59] all run together it ties it all together
[29:02] it makes it all work so that it doesn't
[29:05] just fall apart when you try to put a
[29:06] little weight on it you're like wait
[29:07] what's going on I don't understand if
[29:09] you can find the Keystone it'll make it
[29:11] all run in continuity it'll make it all
[29:13] work together now in the church ages
[29:17] brother BR says the Lord gave me a very
[29:19] script a key the Lord where gave me a
[29:21] scriptural key to in to understand who
[29:24] each messenger was for the ages and he
[29:27] says in fact it might be called the
[29:29] Keystone of the Bible it is the
[29:32] Revelation that God never changes and
[29:36] that his ways are as unchangeable as he
[29:39] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[29:41] and forever is the Keystone that ties
[29:44] the entire Bible together when you can
[29:46] look at it and you can recognize that
[29:48] Jesus back there is the same Jesus today
[29:50] the Jesus that was there at the
[29:52] beginning of the foundation of the world
[29:54] that was there at the the crucifixion
[29:56] that's here right now it's the same one
[29:58] you begin to see that continuity of the
[29:59] Scriptures it begins to tie it all
[30:02] together and when you can catch that
[30:05] Revelation you've found that Keystone of
[30:08] the entire Bible and Ecclesiastes 3:14
[30:10] it says I know that whatsoever God doeth
[30:13] it shall be forever nothing can be put
[30:16] to it nor anything taken from it and God
[30:19] doeth it that men should fear before him
[30:22] for that which hath been is now and that
[30:25] which is to be hath already been and God
[30:28] requireth that which is passed so we see
[30:31] that Keystone is that God is unchanging
[30:35] in his ways he is the unchanging God
[30:38] what he did at the beginning we see in
[30:40] the first church now what what was the
[30:42] first church what what what's the record
[30:44] we have about the first church what do
[30:46] we call that what what would what do you
[30:48] call that in the Bible I I teach Sunday
[30:50] school so I ask lots of questions so we
[30:54] have a record in this Bible and it's the
[30:56] record of the first church you know what
[30:58] it's
[31:00] called no try again it's New Testament
[31:03] it's the record of the first
[31:05] church all right go ahead brother Jared
[31:08] hey acts you got it it's the book of
[31:11] Acts that's what the church is supposed
[31:13] to look
[31:14] like that is the pattern because what
[31:17] God did the first time is what he wants
[31:19] to do the next time he didn't start out
[31:20] with a book of Acts church that had the
[31:22] power of God the baptism of the Holy
[31:23] Spirit the speaking of tongues the
[31:25] Miracles the supernatural he had all
[31:27] these things and he says yeah I did that
[31:28] once that was really mistake we're not
[31:30] doing that again my God doesn't make a
[31:32] mistake when he establishes a church
[31:33] it's an acts 238 Church it has the power
[31:36] of God in it that's the church that he
[31:38] establishes and he's the one that's in
[31:40] it living through it expressing himself
[31:42] doing the acts of the holy spirit in the
[31:44] people that's what the church looks like
[31:47] and that's what it's going to look like
[31:48] every time that it's his church now if
[31:50] it's just a religion it won't have it if
[31:52] it's just man-made Creeds and dogmas
[31:54] it's not going to be there but when God
[31:56] has a called out people when God has a
[31:58] church that's what it's going to look
[32:00] like because God doesn't change he chose
[32:04] himself a messenger for that first age
[32:06] it was the Apostle Paul he believed in
[32:08] the Supernatural the power of God he
[32:10] believed in Miracles the raising of the
[32:12] dead he preached the word without
[32:14] compromise and if somebody was saying
[32:17] something contrary to what that Prophet
[32:19] messenger said he says I don't care if
[32:21] it's an angel from heaven now I mean if
[32:23] an angel comes from heaven and tells you
[32:24] something you check it with a word you
[32:28] don't say well he's from Heaven he's an
[32:29] angel yeah well Lucifer was an angel in
[32:31] heaven one time too but if you don't get
[32:33] if you get away from that word you are
[32:35] lost and so that Paul he stood there and
[32:38] he says I don't care if an angel from
[32:39] heaven comes what I'm telling you is the
[32:41] Commandments of the Lord that's right
[32:45] now what God did with that first
[32:46] messenger is the pattern of what he
[32:49] wants to do with the messenger and
[32:51] that's the scriptural key whereby
[32:53] brother Randon was able to identify
[32:55] God's Messengers through those ages how
[32:57] they stayed with that word and how they
[32:59] believed in the the the moving of God
[33:01] and how the the Holy Spirit the pillar
[33:03] of fire was moving in their midst now if
[33:06] you look in in Malachi chapter 3 and 6
[33:08] he says
[33:10] behold it it says uh for I am the Lord
[33:14] Malachi
[33:15] 3:6 and I change
[33:18] not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[33:23] consumed that's so beautiful to
[33:26] me because
[33:28] if if it were to be based off of the
[33:31] works or the ability or the goodness of
[33:35] the people of Jacob they'd be
[33:38] destroyed right but God says I've chosen
[33:41] a
[33:42] people and because of that choosing he
[33:45] he chose them he placed his elective
[33:47] Grace upon Israel he says they are mine
[33:51] if it was not for that Grace if it was
[33:53] not for that they would be destroyed but
[33:55] he says I chose them I'm not going going
[33:58] to change my mind I am God and I change
[34:01] not and it's because of that you are
[34:03] going to be my people why is there a PE
[34:05] a a nation of Israel on this Earth after
[34:08] 2,000 years because God doesn't change
[34:12] he chose them he claimed them he said
[34:14] they're mine and there's nothing they
[34:16] could do to change that they failed him
[34:20] if if there was if it was based off of
[34:22] Works they failed him too many times if
[34:24] it was based off of they they they
[34:26] crucified the very Son of God if it's
[34:30] based off of Works they're gone but it's
[34:32] not based off of works it's based off of
[34:35] the elective love and grace of almighty
[34:37] God he says they are mine and in this
[34:41] day God has said that he will have a
[34:43] bride if it was based off of your Merit
[34:45] your ability your good works you would
[34:47] fail but it's based off of the elective
[34:50] grace of God has declared I will have a
[34:53] bride I will have a people and she's
[34:55] going to be there because he is God and
[34:59] he changes
[35:01] not God chose Israel now they did many
[35:05] things that he didn't approve of and and
[35:07] he allowed many things to happen to them
[35:09] that really he didn't like to to see his
[35:12] people go through all of these things
[35:14] but he permits things and and there's a
[35:16] little bit of a difference when you
[35:17] understand that God will permit things
[35:19] that he doesn't really like he doesn't
[35:22] really like it to be that way uh uh some
[35:25] simple examples here uh he the prophet
[35:28] came to him and he says thus sayith the
[35:29] Lord you're sick unto death prepare your
[35:31] house you're going to die Hezekiah he
[35:35] gets down on his knees and he begins to
[35:36] pray and before the prophet could get
[35:38] out of the palace the Lord spoke back to
[35:41] him and says go back to him tell him I
[35:43] heard his
[35:44] prayer now if God Hears A Prayer then he
[35:48] doesn't change he'll hear a prayer now
[35:50] and he says I heard his prayer go back
[35:52] and tell him that he's got 15 more years
[35:55] and that he can set his house in order
[35:57] and these things things tell him that
[35:59] I've given him a sign and the sun dial
[36:00] is going to turn backwards and put a
[36:02] bunch of figs on it and this cancer or
[36:04] boiler or whatever it is is going to go
[36:05] away and the man was healed he raised up
[36:08] now we we we see that but did you know
[36:11] that it would actually have been better
[36:12] for him if he'd had died right then
[36:15] because later he invited Babylon to come
[36:17] in and see all of his wealth and his
[36:19] children suffered the price because of
[36:21] that and everything he had was taken
[36:23] into Babylon later it would have been
[36:25] better for him if he would have died
[36:26] when that when the word of the Lord came
[36:28] to him and says get ready it's time to
[36:30] go home it would have been better but he
[36:32] prayed and he actually changed that
[36:35] program of
[36:36] God
[36:39] now I want you to think about that he
[36:43] prayed something cont the he had got the
[36:46] word of the lord it's your time to go
[36:47] he' prayed and he' actually changed the
[36:50] plan of God God permitted him to live
[36:53] longer but it would have been better if
[36:55] he would have just accepted what the
[36:56] word of the Lord came to him but I want
[36:58] you to notice the power of prayer if God
[37:01] will answer a prayer even when it's
[37:03] contrary to his perfect will how much
[37:06] more will he answer a prayer when you
[37:08] say Lord I'm believing for me and my
[37:10] household to be saved I'm standing on
[37:12] your promise I'm standing on your word
[37:14] and you're asking according to the word
[37:16] how much more will the god that changes
[37:18] not keep that promise to you that's
[37:21] right look at look at uh Jesus when he
[37:24] came and he said they asked him about
[37:26] marriage and divorce hor and and they
[37:28] says well what about these things and he
[37:30] says well the Lord for the god of Israel
[37:34] for because of the hardness of your
[37:35] heart he permitted it he permitted a
[37:38] writing of divorcement he says but from
[37:40] the beginning it wasn't so and we see in
[37:43] Malachi 2:16 for the Lord the god of
[37:47] Israel saith that he hateth putting away
[37:50] God hates divorce he hates it and yet
[37:54] because of the hardness of their hearts
[37:56] he permitted a writing
[37:58] divorcement but from the beginning it
[38:01] was not so and so we see what some
[38:04] people would look at like almost a
[38:05] change in his opinion or a change in his
[38:06] Pros he says he hates divorce but then
[38:08] he allows it over here like what's going
[38:10] on but he does not change his away he
[38:14] does not change his thoughts he has a
[38:16] plan he has a perfect he has a perfect
[38:18] will but we can get out of that into a
[38:20] permissive will we can get away from the
[38:22] God's perfect plan but no matter what
[38:25] happens it will come around to fulfill
[38:27] the perfect plan and purpose of God the
[38:30] purpose of God has never been
[38:33] defeated now you can take yourself down
[38:36] some bumpy roads but God's going to get
[38:38] you where he said he was going to get
[38:39] you yes sir now what is it that does not
[38:43] change God's nature does not change who
[38:47] he is his characteristics his identity
[38:50] who he really is on the inside that does
[38:53] not change now we we would say well what
[38:55] is that you know what is that nature
[38:58] what is that characteristics well to
[39:00] really get into the nature of God we'd
[39:01] need about a 150 million year series to
[39:05] get into this because the nature of God
[39:07] is just as Eternal as he is and it it
[39:11] would go beyond uh comprehension and and
[39:14] you know we're going to spend all of
[39:15] eternity delving into and understanding
[39:18] the great love of God for God is love
[39:21] what it was to be a redeemer a savior A
[39:24] Healer a father those are his
[39:26] characteristics that's his nature he's
[39:28] always been a redeemer he's always had
[39:30] the nature of a savior of a Healer it's
[39:32] always been there and it's been
[39:34] expressed and it doesn't changed he
[39:36] wasn't a Healer back 2,000 years ago he
[39:38] wasn't a Healer when there was a brass
[39:39] Serpent and now today he's not a Healer
[39:42] anymore if he was a Healer with a brass
[39:44] serpent if he was a Healer when he
[39:46] passed barus he still a Healer here this
[39:48] morning because he is gone and he
[39:50] changes
[39:52] not he's the god of love he's the god of
[39:55] Mercy he's the God of Justice
[39:58] and therefore he's a god of judgment he
[40:01] never breaks his word he hides himself
[40:05] in Simplicity that's his characteristic
[40:08] that's his nature when God does
[40:10] something it's going to be in Simplicity
[40:12] that's his nature and you begin to
[40:14] recognize his nature recognize his
[40:17] characteristics and then you can
[40:18] identify him when he comes in an
[40:21] unexpected
[40:22] way God doesn't
[40:24] change God stays the same but he comes
[40:28] in a way that surprises people they say
[40:31] a baby in a Manger what are you talking
[40:34] about it was God in Simplicity coming
[40:37] exactly according to prophecy and they
[40:40] missed it because they didn't recognize
[40:43] his
[40:44] nature but God doesn't change God is a
[40:48] god of of redemption of Love of Mercy
[40:51] he's a god of
[40:52] forgiveness I was reading the other day
[40:54] in Samuel and it says how Nathan came up
[40:58] to David and told him this story about
[41:00] this man who had committed a great sin
[41:02] and and David got so angry he says that
[41:06] that's that's wrong he says that that
[41:08] person they should that person should
[41:11] die and you know it's a lot easier to
[41:14] see the sin in the person sitting next
[41:16] to you or and your and your spouse and
[41:19] all the faults that they have and you
[41:20] can see it and everybody else but then
[41:23] Nathan just picked that mirror up and
[41:25] showed David David you're the
[41:29] man and there's going to be a judgment
[41:31] on your house he says your children are
[41:33] going to suffer because of this there's
[41:35] going to be War rise up he give he tells
[41:37] him this this curse that's going to come
[41:39] upon his home of judgment because of
[41:41] this and the moment he ceases to speak
[41:45] David
[41:47] says I have sinned against the Lord he
[41:51] didn't make any arguments any excuses
[41:53] any he just immediately the first thing
[41:56] out of David's mouth was I have sinned I
[41:59] was wrong I shouldn't have done
[42:02] that and Nathan said unto David the Lord
[42:06] also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt
[42:09] not
[42:10] die it didn't take six weeks of
[42:13] sackcloth and Ashes for God to forgive
[42:15] David it took one thing a repentant
[42:18] heart the moment David said I have
[42:20] sinned I was wrong and he confessed his
[42:23] sin that instant not 6 weeks later not
[42:25] two years later that instant God says I
[42:28] have forgiven your
[42:30] sin if he would forgive David under the
[42:32] blood of the BS and goats if he would
[42:34] forgive David under that the moment he
[42:36] says I've been wrong I've sinned forgive
[42:39] me Lord that moment he was forgiven
[42:41] he'll do the same thing for me today
[42:43] when I fail and when I fall down the
[42:45] moment that I'll confess and say Lord
[42:47] God I'm wrong I've sinned forgive me
[42:50] that instant my sin has passed
[42:54] away because he's God and he changes is
[42:57] not that word he said to put away thy
[43:00] sin says God hath put away thy sin that
[43:03] word is a bar which means to pass away
[43:08] to immigrate leave one's territory to
[43:10] vanish to perish cease to
[43:15] exist when David confessed his sin when
[43:19] we take what we've done wrong and we
[43:21] bring it before the Lord and he drops it
[43:23] into that ink that washes it away it
[43:26] ceases to exist in the sight of almighty
[43:32] God David didn't have to do no Penance
[43:36] he didn't have to go do any Works to
[43:38] manufacture a
[43:40] forgiveness he just had to confess his
[43:43] sin that's right I feel like we we look
[43:47] we see how God does something the first
[43:49] time and we know how he's going to do it
[43:51] again I want to ask you when you gave
[43:53] your life to Jesus Christ and when you
[43:55] were forgiven of your sins what works
[43:57] did you do to get him to forgive
[44:00] you what merits did you put there and
[44:03] say I deserve this
[44:05] forgiveness
[44:07] nothing if you tried to produce anything
[44:10] he rejected it all you did was come down
[44:13] and you knelt down at his feet and you
[44:15] said God I'm a sinner I'm a failure but
[44:18] I'm coming beneath the blood of a shed
[44:20] lamb that was said you would forgive my
[44:22] sins that's I'm accepting that and you
[44:25] got away from there walked up and you
[44:27] stood away and you were forgiven and you
[44:28] were free from your sin and I want to
[44:31] ask you now when you failed now and when
[44:33] you've made that mistake now how are you
[44:34] going to get rid of that sin are you
[44:37] going to go be really good you going to
[44:38] attend church for a long time and get
[44:39] some good
[44:41] merits same way you did it the first
[44:43] time and he forgave you that's the same
[44:45] way he'll do it this time you come down
[44:47] to him you kneel down at his feet and
[44:48] you say God I messed up I failed I was
[44:52] wrong forgive me
[44:54] Lord don't try to put any of your own
[44:57] abilities and merits into the question
[44:59] cuz that's not how he did it the first
[45:01] time it's by Grace you are
[45:04] saved there was that woman that came to
[45:07] Jesus and you know we don't know her
[45:10] name but we know she was a great
[45:12] sinner everybody knew she was a
[45:15] sinner she knew she was a sinner the
[45:18] Pharisees knew she was a sinner Jesus
[45:21] knew she was a sinner she came in and
[45:24] she began to wash his feet with her
[45:26] tears
[45:27] and those Pharisees were sitting around
[45:30] with all of their
[45:33] self-righteousness which was filthy rags
[45:36] and they were criticizing
[45:38] her and they should have been doing what
[45:40] she was
[45:41] doing right how many times do people
[45:44] criticize the person who's actually
[45:46] doing the very thing that they ought
[45:48] have been doing but she kneeled down
[45:50] there and she began to wash his feet
[45:52] with her tears and she began to repent
[45:54] at his feet and she began to do a
[45:57] service for him because she seen that it
[45:59] needed to be done somebody needed to
[46:02] wash away the dirt and the criticism and
[46:04] the mockery off of Jesus feet and you
[46:06] know what she did she washed his feet
[46:08] with her tears and she wiped off his
[46:11] feet with her hair and she actually bore
[46:14] his reproach when she walked out of
[46:16] there where did all that dirt and that
[46:17] mud off of the road go it was on her it
[46:20] was on her face it was on her
[46:22] hair she bore his reproach and he bore
[46:26] her sin
[46:29] and they were criticizing and mocking
[46:31] her and they were saying oh if that man
[46:34] was really a prophet he'd know what kind
[46:36] of a woman was at his feet oh he knew
[46:39] and he knew who they were and he knew
[46:42] they were worse off condition than she
[46:44] was and he turned to her and he says
[46:47] wherefore I say unto thee her sins which
[46:49] were many are forgiven for she loved
[46:53] much but to whom little Is Forgiven the
[46:56] same loveth little
[46:57] and he said unto her thy sins are
[47:01] forgiven and they said and they that sat
[47:04] at meat with him began to say within
[47:05] themselves who is this that forgiveth
[47:07] sins
[47:09] also they didn't say it out loud he knew
[47:12] the heart and he said unto the woman thy
[47:16] faith hath saved thee go in
[47:21] peace if he forgave her and she was a
[47:24] great sinner there's no questions asked
[47:27] she was a great sinner but the
[47:28] unchanging God forgave her and he'd do
[47:32] it
[47:35] again he doesn't change his ways he's
[47:38] the same
[47:40] God Psalms 103 says bless the Lord oh my
[47:44] soul and forget not all his benefits who
[47:48] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[47:51] Health all thy
[47:55] diseases if you can really catch an
[47:58] understanding of the power of the blood
[48:00] of Jesus Christ that has forgiven our
[48:03] sins forgiven our iniquities then you
[48:05] could lay aside that unbelief that says
[48:07] oh but I'm not good enough oh I'm not
[48:09] you're not good enough you're absolutely
[48:11] right but it's never been about you it's
[48:12] about your sacrifice and the worthiness
[48:15] of that perfect lamb if it was worthy
[48:17] then you are worthy if it was not worthy
[48:20] then you are not worthy you say well I'm
[48:21] not good enough to get healed when you
[48:23] say that you're actually confessing that
[48:25] Jesus Christ was not a sufficient
[48:27] sacrifice but I say that he was the
[48:30] perfect Lamb of God and it was a
[48:32] sufficient sacrifice and therefore you
[48:34] can take possession of every divine
[48:36] blessing of God because he was found
[48:39] worthy and I am found in
[48:44] him Jesus Christ is the one who could
[48:48] stand there and look at that woman that
[48:50] was caught in adultery and he says
[48:52] whoever is without sin you cast the
[48:54] first stone and I say before you throw a
[48:56] stone at your neighbor make sure that
[48:58] you've never committed a sin
[49:00] yourself that's right if you're sinless
[49:03] then you've got the right to condemn
[49:04] somebody if you're not you're nothing
[49:06] but a
[49:09] hypocrite Jesus said whoever is without
[49:12] sin cast a stone at her and they all
[49:15] just turned around and walked
[49:17] away and Jesus said unto her where are
[49:19] thine accusers hath no man condemned
[49:22] thee and she said no man
[49:25] Lord you know there was one person there
[49:28] that could throw a
[49:30] stone there was one person there that
[49:32] had never sinned he could have picked up
[49:35] a throne Stone and thrown it at
[49:38] her but he said neither do I condemn
[49:44] me if he didn't condemn her he's not
[49:47] here to condemn me now and he said go
[49:49] and sin no more I'm so thankful to know
[49:53] that there's a God of mercy and a god of
[49:55] forgiveness no matter how much of a
[49:57] failure you are no matter how much you
[49:59] failed no matter how much you sinned
[50:01] there is a God of mercy and Grace on the
[50:03] throne who still forgives a repentant
[50:07] sinner he could condemn us but he didn't
[50:11] he could have cast us away but he didn't
[50:15] he brought forgiveness he brought mercy
[50:18] and I'm so thankful today to know that
[50:21] that he is an unchanging God and no
[50:23] matter how much you might fail him one
[50:26] day he the god of Mercy that's there to
[50:29] forgive now there will come a day when
[50:32] mercy will be finished there will come a
[50:35] day when salvation will be completed and
[50:38] in that day there will be no mercy or
[50:42] forgiveness to be
[50:44] found but I'm so happy to know that
[50:47] there's still
[50:50] blood there's still
[50:52] Mercy in Lamentations it says it is of
[50:55] the Lord's Mercy
[50:57] that we are not consumed because his
[50:59] compassions fail not they are new every
[51:03] morning great is thy
[51:07] faithfulness oh friends we serve a God
[51:10] who is great in his Mercy who's great in
[51:14] his love and his compassion for us now
[51:17] there will be a day when he's a God of
[51:19] Justice and he has to bring judgment but
[51:22] if you have been found under the shed
[51:23] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ Justice
[51:26] will declare you
[51:29] perfect but if you're trying to get in
[51:31] on your own merits you can just give up
[51:35] now God does not change if he forgave a
[51:39] sinner once that repented if another
[51:42] sinner comes in Repentance he'll forgive
[51:44] them as well he's God he changes not if
[51:48] he for if he rejected those who came
[51:50] with their man-made religion Pharisee
[51:54] self-righteousness he'll do the same
[51:55] thing again
[51:57] God does not change you look at job job
[52:02] stood in the Gap and he believed in a
[52:05] blood sacrifice for his family and for
[52:07] his children and his children were saved
[52:11] because he believed in the shed blood of
[52:14] that sacrifice which was all that he had
[52:16] brother Brandon said in the sermon thy
[52:18] house and you know if there's anybody
[52:20] here that that has unsaved loved ones go
[52:22] to tiffon Georgia thy house
[52:25] 1961 it'll just give you such a joy to
[52:28] know that you have a promise but in here
[52:31] he he says he says uh because he was
[52:34] standing job because he was standing on
[52:36] everything that God gave us to be
[52:38] righteous or gave him was to offer that
[52:41] burnt offering job had done what God
[52:44] required offer a sacrifice and he know
[52:48] that was God's word and it could not
[52:50] fail so did you ever think where them
[52:53] children was they was in heaven waiting
[52:55] for him he's with them today and God
[52:59] saved job's children they were in heaven
[53:01] waiting for him why because he offered a
[53:05] sacrifice and he says God I've done what
[53:07] you commanded everything's gone wrong
[53:09] but I he went out and he sat on that
[53:11] Ashy and he says but I offered a burnt
[53:13] sacrifice this is what God required and
[53:16] he stood on that he stood on that
[53:18] promise and he would not let go of it
[53:21] because he knew it was God's word and I
[53:23] I remember a time when I thought oh I
[53:25] wish I could just go and offer a
[53:26] sacrifice and that my children I would
[53:28] know everything was right and my family
[53:29] and my wife oh that'd be so nice and
[53:32] then I heard the prophet say he says
[53:33] it's easier than that now because we
[53:36] don't have to offer a sacrifice we only
[53:38] have to accept and believe the sacrifice
[53:41] that's already been
[53:43] made Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:46] and you and your household shall be
[53:52] saved God doesn't change if he saved
[53:55] job's children if he saved Rahab and her
[53:57] family that was under that shed blood of
[54:00] that token that she had in her home if
[54:01] he saved the centurion's family that he
[54:03] told believe and you and our household
[54:05] shall be saved then I declare today he's
[54:08] the same God he doesn't change and if
[54:10] you'll be this like job and hold on to
[54:12] that sacrifice your children will be
[54:15] there for he said in Isaiah that they
[54:17] will gather together in that great land
[54:19] and they'll build houses and they'll
[54:20] inhabit them and not another they'll eat
[54:22] plant Vineyards and they'll Harvest them
[54:24] and not another and they shall be there
[54:26] with their offspring that means that my
[54:29] children are going to be there in that
[54:31] land with me because that scripture is
[54:33] my scripture that's my prophecy I'm
[54:35] going to be the one in that Millennial
[54:37] Reign I'm going to be there in that land
[54:39] planting and harvesting and building I'm
[54:41] going to be that one there and it said
[54:42] that my offspring would be with me and
[54:45] God's word cannot
[54:47] fail God doesn't change he doesn't
[54:50] change his mind he never made a mistake
[54:52] he's never failed what he said one time
[54:55] he stands behind minded for all of
[54:57] eternity thank you Jesus God doesn't
[55:00] change that's the Keystone of the
[55:03] Bible
[55:06] healing is
[55:08] available healing is yours to receive
[55:12] God doesn't change when they came out of
[55:14] Israel when uh Egypt they came out under
[55:17] Exodus under a prophetic Ministry that
[55:19] was bringing them to a land of promise
[55:21] the promised word for that hour when
[55:23] they came out under that Exodus they
[55:25] were given
[55:26] Divine
[55:27] Healing there was not one feeble person
[55:30] among their tribes now do you know why
[55:33] there was not one feeble person there
[55:36] just before they left Egypt they had
[55:39] some dinner and what was that dinner
[55:42] they had before they left Egypt what do
[55:44] you
[55:46] remember what do you remember brother
[55:48] what was their dinner they had before
[55:49] they left
[55:51] Egypt it's my Sunday school lesson got
[55:53] to make sure you guys are awake
[55:56] they had a lamb and they had unleavened
[56:00] bread that lamb was a
[56:04] type of the
[56:06] lamb and when they ate the type of the
[56:10] Lamb not one person was feeble when they
[56:13] walked out of Egypt and if the type of
[56:16] the Lamb would bring forth a healing
[56:19] like that what would the literal Lord
[56:21] Jesus Christ that has come to us in this
[56:23] day what would it do to you you don't
[56:25] have to have one feeble person among you
[56:27] you can go forth in strength and in
[56:29] power into this land of promise because
[56:31] we're not eating a type we're eating the
[56:34] reality there's healing in the communion
[56:37] cup there's healing in that partaking
[56:39] because it's a representation of the
[56:44] real I am the Lord Jehovah that Health
[56:48] thee that was the whole medical
[56:51] prescription for the children of Israel
[56:53] in Egypt coming out of Egypt for 40
[56:56] years they walk through the Wilderness
[56:57] and they says well you know listen Moses
[56:59] things are really getting bad we had
[57:01] this come up we had that come up do you
[57:02] think maybe we could go over and and and
[57:04] and start a little psychology
[57:06] course no no he says hold on let me
[57:09] check what the the remedy
[57:12] is yeah hadn't changed I'm the Lord that
[57:15] Health
[57:17] the no matter what came up no matter
[57:20] what the situation no matter what the
[57:22] problem he had one answer and I have one
[57:25] answer for you today
[57:26] the answer is that the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:29] is the Healer there's not some other
[57:31] answer there's not some other solution
[57:33] it's Jesus Christ the
[57:35] Healer now God can he can bless you with
[57:39] some medicine and things you know
[57:40] personally I'm I'm a little skeptic
[57:42] because it's like they're practicing
[57:43] they haven't figured it out yet but you
[57:46] know God can use some things he can
[57:48] bless some things but let me tell you
[57:49] this Jesus Christ is the answer
[57:52] medication is not the answer psychology
[57:54] is not the answer another great doctor
[57:57] is not the answer the answer is Jesus
[57:59] Christ because he is the
[58:04] Healer there was not one feeble person
[58:06] among them and did you know that that
[58:09] healing power was so great that their
[58:11] clothes didn't even wear
[58:13] out their shoes didn't get
[58:17] holes I read something the other day
[58:19] that just struck me and nemiah had never
[58:20] noticed it before Nehemiah 9:21 it says
[58:23] their clothed wax not old and their feet
[58:26] swelled
[58:27] not walking around in the wilderness for
[58:29] 40 years and they never even had swollen
[58:33] feet you see if God was going to fix the
[58:35] shoes and make sure they didn't wear out
[58:37] why not just fix the feet while he was
[58:39] at
[58:41] it you I kind of Wonder Maybe the kids'
[58:44] clothes grew on them while they were
[58:46] growing I mean I don't know but I mean
[58:48] think about who was there Jehovah God
[58:51] anything's
[58:54] possible and who's here today
[58:58] anything is possible you say oh well you
[59:01] know I I was listening to that sermon
[59:02] thy house he says oh well you need a job
[59:04] believe on the Lord he says you need new
[59:06] furniture believe on the Lord and that
[59:09] just struck me I'm like wait a minute
[59:11] you can ask God for
[59:16] furniture don't limit
[59:19] him if there's something you desire in
[59:21] your heart talk to him about it he might
[59:24] just be waiting for you to say something
[59:28] that's Jehovah god of the Old Testament
[59:31] is Jesus of the new he only changed his
[59:34] mask from Spirit to man changed his
[59:38] expression his form God does not change
[59:40] his nature but his form is constantly
[59:44] changing and you know uh back last week
[59:49] uh I was at my house and we had a little
[59:52] problem with the plumbing and so I had
[59:54] to get in there I I do construction so I
[59:56] never call anybody to help me with
[59:57] anything I just do it myself and so I
[59:59] took the plumbing apart and I'm working
[1:00:00] on it trying to get that that sewage
[1:00:03] problem fixed and and uh it's it's
[1:00:05] actually a Wednesday night I'm supposed
[1:00:06] to preach that night and and the house
[1:00:08] is backing up and I'm like what am I
[1:00:10] going to do and so I'm trying to get
[1:00:11] that fixed and somebody upstairs they
[1:00:13] flushed the
[1:00:15] toilet oh man you know you know you
[1:00:17] think you think you're not you know not
[1:00:19] an emotional person or something well
[1:00:20] you get an experience like that you
[1:00:22] might find a little more shou and
[1:00:23] emotion than you knew you had you know
[1:00:25] when you have an exp something happens
[1:00:27] to you and I got you know I let out a
[1:00:29] few hollers and whoops down there and I
[1:00:31] was not real excited about that you know
[1:00:33] I was very
[1:00:37] messy same guy in this suit the same guy
[1:00:40] that had a nice warm shower this morning
[1:00:43] it's the same guy that was that mess
[1:00:45] over there now don't really look the
[1:00:48] same but it's the same person a few days
[1:00:51] ago I was out hunting in the woods and
[1:00:53] we got we got a whole bunch of deer and
[1:00:56] and uh we were you know cleaning them
[1:00:58] out and and it was cold out and you know
[1:01:00] you had blood all over you and just just
[1:01:03] everything was a mess and and you know
[1:01:06] the same person here in this suit was
[1:01:08] literally covered in debris and Gunk and
[1:01:12] blood and and guts and everything just a
[1:01:13] couple days ago same person that's
[1:01:20] right but you know if I have walked in
[1:01:22] this door in that form you might not
[1:01:24] have been so sure about this but you see
[1:01:26] I came in a form you expected I came
[1:01:28] dressed in a suit and tie but if I had
[1:01:31] have come here showed up with with you
[1:01:33] know deer deer blood all over me it had
[1:01:35] been the same person preaching the same
[1:01:37] word but you might not have received it
[1:01:39] because of the way it came that's right
[1:01:43] Jesus don't miss don't look at the
[1:01:45] clothes don't look at the form don't
[1:01:47] look at how he approached look for him
[1:01:50] look for his nature look for who he is
[1:01:53] and when you recognize him then forget
[1:01:55] about the clothes and how he looks oh he
[1:01:57] looks like it's a mess and it looks like
[1:01:59] this it's Jesus Christ that's the one
[1:02:02] you
[1:02:03] found God doesn't change his nature but
[1:02:06] his form is constantly
[1:02:08] changing he came down Through the Ages
[1:02:10] he came to Moses in a pillar of fire did
[1:02:13] you know Moses he met in a pillar of
[1:02:15] fire he gave him a commission he had
[1:02:17] this P incredible experience Joshua came
[1:02:20] and he met that same person but it
[1:02:23] wasn't a pillar of Fire
[1:02:26] all right who wants to volunteer this
[1:02:28] answer it wasn't the pillar of fire that
[1:02:31] that Joshua met who was
[1:02:33] it go ahead you look like you're eager
[1:02:35] to
[1:02:39] answer he met a
[1:02:44] man go ahead brother in the
[1:02:52] back yeah there a man standing there
[1:02:55] with with a sword
[1:02:56] drawn and that man it was a man and he
[1:03:00] said to him take off your shoes you're
[1:03:03] standing on Holy
[1:03:05] Ground and you keep reading and it says
[1:03:08] and the Lord told Joshua this is how
[1:03:11] you're going to win the
[1:03:14] battle you see it was the same
[1:03:18] man that was in that Pillar of Fire the
[1:03:20] same person the same nature was that
[1:03:22] Pillar of Fire it moved out of a pillar
[1:03:24] of fire into a man standing there with a
[1:03:27] sword and Joshua had the same experience
[1:03:30] that Moses had he met the same person
[1:03:32] but it was a slightly different
[1:03:36] form oh don't miss who's in your
[1:03:39] presence because he comes in an
[1:03:41] unexpected
[1:03:42] way Joshua stood there and he recognized
[1:03:46] who he was talking to he took off his
[1:03:49] feet shoes and he bowed himself down to
[1:03:51] the ground it was Jehovah God in another
[1:03:56] form the same God but changing his
[1:03:59] expression how he veils himself how he's
[1:04:02] expressing himself God cannot change his
[1:04:05] nature but his form constantly he's the
[1:04:08] same yesterday today and forever and he
[1:04:10] always comes in an unexpected way and so
[1:04:13] they miss him every single time he
[1:04:14] doesn't come into the big churches with
[1:04:16] the all the fancy religious you know
[1:04:19] paraphernalia Jesus didn't come with
[1:04:21] robes and and degrees and all of these
[1:04:24] things he came as a as a man that was
[1:04:27] born to a woman that wasn't even
[1:04:30] married pregnated by some Soldier they
[1:04:33] said he came he never went to schools
[1:04:36] and got a college degree he was somebody
[1:04:39] they didn't understand where he came
[1:04:41] from they didn't know what was going on
[1:04:44] but you know what he did do he came
[1:04:46] exactly according to the
[1:04:48] word and they missed it because of the
[1:04:51] traditions of
[1:04:53] Grandpa it's exact same thing do today
[1:04:56] Jesus Christ comes and he expresses
[1:04:58] himself he says yeah but grandpa
[1:05:00] said like I love my grandfathers but I'm
[1:05:04] telling you I'm not following what
[1:05:06] grandpa said I'm following what the
[1:05:07] Vindicated word
[1:05:09] said every age God's come down in a
[1:05:12] different expression it was God in
[1:05:13] Ezekiel it was God in Isaiah it was God
[1:05:16] expressing himself coming down through
[1:05:17] these different prophets these different
[1:05:19] Ministries And Then There came one who
[1:05:20] is not just an expression of a part of
[1:05:23] God an expression of a characteristic of
[1:05:25] God it was the fullness of the godhead
[1:05:27] bodily in a man the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:30] the Supreme creator of heavens and earth
[1:05:32] standing on this Earth rejected by man
[1:05:35] forsaken by God and made a sin offering
[1:05:39] for The Souls of
[1:05:40] men oh you look at that cross you look
[1:05:43] at that that man there bleeding and
[1:05:45] bloody and dripping and and and
[1:05:49] rejected that was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:52] that was the prophecy being fulfilled
[1:05:54] and you know what everybody was ashamed
[1:05:56] to be identified with
[1:05:59] him but it was exactly according to the
[1:06:03] prophetic word for that day but they
[1:06:06] failed to recognize it as Jesus said to
[1:06:08] them on the road to amaz this oh fools
[1:06:11] and slow of heart don't you know the
[1:06:13] prophecies didn't you know this was
[1:06:15] supposed to happen exactly this way
[1:06:17] everything's exactly according to
[1:06:19] prophecy nothing here is out of order
[1:06:21] and you're ashamed and you're
[1:06:22] embarrassed and you're confused and
[1:06:23] you're sad and you don't know what's
[1:06:24] going on
[1:06:26] oh why don't you know the word
[1:06:28] concerning your
[1:06:30] day he never changes his nature only his
[1:06:34] form he's the same yesterday today and
[1:06:36] forever he he was the same one that was
[1:06:39] in Noah he was the same one that was in
[1:06:41] Moses he was and you got to keep the
[1:06:43] continuity right because you look at
[1:06:44] Noah and you say oh well here's Noah and
[1:06:47] uh we see that God destroyed the World
[1:06:48] by a flood and God doesn't change so
[1:06:50] he's going to destroy the world by a
[1:06:51] flood again it's like you're so close
[1:06:55] you were really close there but it's he
[1:06:57] said he wouldn't do it by a flood but he
[1:06:59] will destroy the world he is a God of
[1:07:01] Justice he will judge sin he will do
[1:07:04] that but he did it the first time with
[1:07:05] water this time it's with fire and so
[1:07:08] you you got to not just run it
[1:07:10] intellectually through your mind and say
[1:07:11] well God doesn't change this is the way
[1:07:13] it's going to be you line it up with the
[1:07:14] word you look for that characteristic of
[1:07:16] his nature and you'll begin to see how
[1:07:18] God's going to act and what's beautiful
[1:07:21] is once you figure out how God likes to
[1:07:23] do things you can get right in the spot
[1:07:25] where he's going to
[1:07:26] move you can position yourself so that
[1:07:29] you're there when he walks through the
[1:07:31] door if you can recognize how he does
[1:07:34] things here in the sermon identified
[1:07:36] Christ of all ages Topeka Kansas I've
[1:07:39] been going through this series and if if
[1:07:41] you want to have a Revival just slip
[1:07:42] over there it's it's quite a time he
[1:07:44] says remember God changes his form in
[1:07:47] morphe the Greek word means he puts on a
[1:07:50] different mask like in Carmen or
[1:07:52] something or Shakespeare's play he's
[1:07:54] like an actor he Chang es his form and
[1:07:57] that's those prophets were that was God
[1:07:59] in those prophets Jesus said so you
[1:08:01] condemn me for calling myself the Son of
[1:08:03] God and you call them Gods who the word
[1:08:05] of God came to and I'm the Son of God
[1:08:08] how do you condemn me the same thing is
[1:08:11] today it's God manifested in flesh the
[1:08:16] message of the hour the light of the
[1:08:20] day this message of the hour is Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ expressed to a people it's the
[1:08:27] light of the hour it's God manifested in
[1:08:32] flesh you see God didn't just want to
[1:08:34] send a word to manifest it on
[1:08:38] paper God sent a word to manifest in
[1:08:44] flesh in that same sermon he says dear
[1:08:46] Jesus the immaculate son of the Living
[1:08:48] God who is here tonight in the form of
[1:08:51] the Holy Spirit changed his form and
[1:08:54] came down and revealed his word right in
[1:08:57] human flesh Men Women of all walks of
[1:09:01] life showing that he is still alive he
[1:09:04] is the same yesterday today and
[1:09:07] forever when you
[1:09:10] recognize that this message that we've
[1:09:13] received when you recognize what Jesus
[1:09:15] Christ said in Luke 17:30 he says even
[1:09:17] thus shall it be in the days when the
[1:09:19] son of man is being revealed and you
[1:09:21] begin to run the continuity you get that
[1:09:23] Keystone and you begin to see how it
[1:09:25] connects together and then you see that
[1:09:27] Prophet stand there and speak and
[1:09:29] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:09:30] heart of the people that be behind him
[1:09:32] you recognize that's not a man doing
[1:09:34] that that's almighty God come down and
[1:09:37] changed his form changed his expression
[1:09:39] found a vessel he could get a hold of
[1:09:41] and expressed himself as God in
[1:09:45] flesh the revealing of the son of man
[1:09:49] brother brandom says I'm identified with
[1:09:51] a group that knows that he's unveiled
[1:09:54] that know he's the same yesterday today
[1:09:56] and forever and that it's not fanaticism
[1:09:59] it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:10:02] today and forever I'm so happy to be
[1:10:04] identified with a people that we call
[1:10:06] message Believers I'm so happy to be
[1:10:09] identified with people that are
[1:10:10] considered Fanatics to the world that's
[1:10:12] considered Holy Rollers because that's
[1:10:13] been the way it was every time in the
[1:10:15] days of Jesus there was only a couple
[1:10:17] who recognized who he was and everybody
[1:10:19] else rejected him but there was a people
[1:10:21] that said to whom would we go you have
[1:10:23] the Word of Life they re recognize this
[1:10:26] expression they said this is God that is
[1:10:28] expressing himself to us they recognize
[1:10:31] that word of life and I'm happy to be
[1:10:33] identified with a people who has
[1:10:35] recognized the word of life that has
[1:10:38] been
[1:10:39] expressed God in his enm morphy again
[1:10:41] unveiling himself and making himself
[1:10:44] known to his people the great king who
[1:10:46] laid aside his glory yet a little while
[1:10:49] and the world won't see me no more but
[1:10:51] I'll be veiled to them but ye shall see
[1:10:56] me people always miss it they can't see
[1:10:58] it they can't see that it was God in
[1:11:00] Martin Luther they can't see it was God
[1:11:02] in John Wesley they can't see that this
[1:11:04] was God coming down Through the Ages
[1:11:06] fulfilling his word and and God God has
[1:11:09] allotted a certain word for every age
[1:11:12] he's a certain word he says this will be
[1:11:14] fulfilled in this time this will be
[1:11:15] fulfilled in this time this will be
[1:11:16] fulfilled in this time and it's an
[1:11:18] allotted word for each age and then to
[1:11:21] fulfill that allotted word he sends
[1:11:25] right here he says uh somehow we don't
[1:11:27] know how it ever happened but in each
[1:11:29] one of these ages as we look back upon
[1:11:32] Thy word and we see that there was an
[1:11:34] anointing come in that age that
[1:11:37] fulfilled that
[1:11:40] word there's an anointing that's
[1:11:42] released to fulfill the word of that day
[1:11:43] in the days of the the lion anointing
[1:11:45] there was an anointing released with
[1:11:47] that in the days of the ox anointing on
[1:11:49] the people they would offer themselves
[1:11:51] as a sacrifice they'd run to the stake
[1:11:53] they they they they gather the the the
[1:11:55] Ste the altar where they would be burnt
[1:11:56] as a as a burnt at the Stak they'd grab
[1:11:59] the wood and they'd pile it around
[1:12:00] themselves just they were rejoicing they
[1:12:02] would long to give their life as a
[1:12:04] sacrifice you say how could they do that
[1:12:07] there was an anointing there was an
[1:12:09] anointing that age to fulfill that Ox
[1:12:11] anointing where the church would go down
[1:12:14] and and and die in the grave there would
[1:12:16] be a a death burial and resurrection of
[1:12:18] the church we see these things happening
[1:12:19] we see it going down and you you look at
[1:12:21] you're like how could they do that there
[1:12:23] was an anointing
[1:12:25] yeah yeah well how could Martin Luther
[1:12:27] stand there and re reject that entire
[1:12:30] Catholic World system and push it back
[1:12:33] there was an anointing that came H to
[1:12:35] him under a man anointing to fulfill
[1:12:37] that and to accomplish that you say how
[1:12:38] could that be there was an anointing
[1:12:40] that came to fulfill that right in this
[1:12:43] day it's the eagle age and there's an
[1:12:46] anointing that's been released on a
[1:12:48] people that will take a flight from this
[1:12:50] Earth there's been an anointing released
[1:12:52] you say oh how could I be the bride how
[1:12:54] could I fulfill these things there's an
[1:12:56] anointing that's been released to
[1:12:57] fulfill the promised word a lotted to
[1:12:59] this age oh it's God in morphe God sends
[1:13:04] a word he says there would be a a virgin
[1:13:06] born son of the Living God that would
[1:13:08] come there would come one and then he
[1:13:09] sent an anointing upon a virgin that
[1:13:11] brought forth that son of the Living God
[1:13:14] there's an anointing that's released in
[1:13:15] each age to fulfill the word for that
[1:13:18] age that's right now if you look at the
[1:13:20] word for this age you begin to see what
[1:13:23] the anointing upon your life life is
[1:13:25] going to accomplish not trying to
[1:13:28] accomplish going to be accomplished
[1:13:30] because God will have a bride and he
[1:13:32] will not fail he's not going to get
[1:13:34] halfway and then quit God has never quit

[1:13:39] good work will be faithful to complete
[1:13:40] it he knows exactly what he's doing and
[1:13:43] he's going to bring forth a bride that
[1:13:45] will be the Glorious spotless Bride of
[1:13:47] the son of the Living God without spot
[1:13:49] without wrinkle sinless and justified in
[1:13:52] his
[1:13:53] sight now
[1:13:55] here in the Mighty God unveil before us
[1:13:57] the prophet says he broke every
[1:13:59] denominational ve Veil every sound
[1:14:02] barrier that sound that says oh that's
[1:14:05] fanaticism he broke right through that
[1:14:07] that sound Berry come out there and said
[1:14:09] oh them people are crazy he broke right
[1:14:12] through that Veil yes he did oh you
[1:14:14] can't do it you're another nothing but a
[1:14:17] bunch of Fanatics he broke right through
[1:14:19] that no such a thing as Divine Healing
[1:14:22] he broke right through that oh my for he
[1:14:25] was the word he he you can't conquer the
[1:14:29] word of God and there he stands yet
[1:14:32] tonight the mighty conqueror since he
[1:14:35] broke every Methodist and Baptist and
[1:14:37] Presbyterian and every other kind of
[1:14:38] aail he stands among his people tonight
[1:14:42] unconquered by Traditions I don't care
[1:14:45] what somebody's told you what somebody
[1:14:47] said the same Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:14:49] lived 2,000 years ago is here right here
[1:14:51] this morning I don't care who said
[1:14:53] something who started a tradition he is
[1:14:55] unconquered and he Remains the
[1:14:58] Same whatsoever you have need of ask and
[1:15:03] you shall receive it oh but I heard
[1:15:05] somebody say this and I heard somebody
[1:15:07] say that forget the Traditions forget
[1:15:09] those veils that try to Veil him off and
[1:15:11] say you can't access him there is a veil
[1:15:14] that has been rent there's been a way
[1:15:15] provided where you can come directly
[1:15:17] Before the Throne of God and come boldly
[1:15:20] to ask for mercy and
[1:15:23] Grace oh he says and I remember they
[1:15:25] tell me when a plane breaks that sound
[1:15:27] barrier there's no limit to its speed
[1:15:30] and I'm telling you when you break that
[1:15:33] traditional barrier Jesus is way
[1:15:38] back and he isn't
[1:15:42] now do you realize that Jesus Christ is
[1:15:45] not the god of 2,000 years
[1:15:49] ago he's not the man Jesus Christ is not
[1:15:52] the god uh that walked around in Galilee
[1:15:55] that's not where he's at no if you and
[1:15:58] you you watch this so closely if you try
[1:16:01] to worship a historical Jesus of 2,000
[1:16:04] years ago we'll crucify the Son of God
[1:16:07] aresh that's right he's not back
[1:16:10] there he's right here he's the same
[1:16:14] yesterday today and forever he is alive
[1:16:16] they did not kill him and lay him in a
[1:16:18] grave and he stayed there he rose up
[1:16:20] from that grave and he came and he said
[1:16:22] he would be here this morning and he's
[1:16:24] never failed to keep a
[1:16:26] promise he said here if I'm telling you
[1:16:29] when you can break that traditional
[1:16:30] barrier that Jesus is way back and he
[1:16:33] isn't now when you find he's the same
[1:16:36] yesterday today and forever there's no
[1:16:39] limit to what God could do right here in
[1:16:41] this
[1:16:42] convention when you recognize him the
[1:16:44] same when you catch the Keystone of the
[1:16:46] Bible that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:16:48] yesterday today and forever he does not
[1:16:50] change then you can access unlimited
[1:16:53] power here this morning
[1:16:59] morning oh he says show the world what
[1:17:01] they need a a Revival that'll be filled
[1:17:04] and baptized with the presence of the
[1:17:05] Living God and morphe in veiling himself
[1:17:09] into human flesh what
[1:17:12] flesh what flesh is God wanting to Veil
[1:17:15] himself into and change his mask
[1:17:19] into well he did it in the prophet we
[1:17:21] see that we recognize that
[1:17:25] but that wasn't the that wasn't the end
[1:17:26] of the mission that was that was the
[1:17:28] beginning of the mission the end of the
[1:17:30] mission was to have a people that God
[1:17:33] could have preeminence
[1:17:35] in what God began to do to show that I
[1:17:38] can take a hold of a vessel and I can
[1:17:40] enveil myself into that person and it's
[1:17:43] now God in
[1:17:45] flesh that's what his purpose is to
[1:17:47] accomplish in a bride in this day but
[1:17:50] you know what it'll be so simple because
[1:17:55] God comes in Simplicity people will look
[1:17:57] right at it and they'll laugh at it
[1:17:59] they'll call it the crazy Neighbor Next
[1:18:00] Door they'll call it and it'll be Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ in a Manger it'll be Jesus Christ
[1:18:06] walking around with a bunch of fishermen
[1:18:08] catching fish and and just having a good
[1:18:10] time talking with him it'll be Jesus
[1:18:13] Christ unveiled in a human
[1:18:18] being he
[1:18:20] says veiling himself into human flesh oh
[1:18:24] Hallelujah I believe it he broke every
[1:18:26] barrier every Veil every nothing could
[1:18:29] hide his presence when people gets
[1:18:31] hungry in their heart there's a veil
[1:18:34] ready to be broke and you can depend on
[1:18:36] that he rent every veil by his great
[1:18:39] Holy Spirit and here he stands tonight
[1:18:41] the mighty conqueror same yesterday
[1:18:43] today and forever Healing The Sick
[1:18:45] baptizing the Believers just as he
[1:18:46] always did and he's the mighty conqueror
[1:18:49] doomed devils are on the Run yes sir
[1:18:52] they always are when he's around
[1:18:55] I want to testify this morning he's
[1:18:57] around and that devil that's been
[1:19:00] tormenting your family that devil that's
[1:19:02] been haunting you he is shaking in his
[1:19:04] boots right now he's a doomed devil
[1:19:06] that's on the run because he recognizes
[1:19:08] that Jesus is the same he knows his
[1:19:10] power is here this morning and he's
[1:19:12] terrified of the possibility that you
[1:19:14] might recognize the
[1:19:17] same doomed devils are on the Run
[1:19:25] Enoch walked with God and he was not for
[1:19:28] God took him that's right what God did
[1:19:30] once he'll do again we which alive and
[1:19:34] remain shall not prevent them which are
[1:19:36] asleep oh but we shall be caught up
[1:19:39] together we shall be changed there's
[1:19:42] coming a change to our Earthly bodies
[1:19:45] now to kind of bring this to a close and
[1:19:48] look back here at the where we started
[1:19:51] we seeing that behold the day cometh
[1:19:52] that shall burn as an oven now we know
[1:19:54] there's that's coming we know it's going
[1:19:56] to happen but before that happens behold
[1:19:59] I send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:20:01] great and Dreadful day of the Lord so we
[1:20:04] can see how how how this is supposed to
[1:20:06] run together but if we run back in the
[1:20:08] scriptures we can go back and see he
[1:20:11] says as it was in the days of lot as it
[1:20:13] was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:20:15] and Abraham up in the mountain that same
[1:20:18] situation is going to play out again
[1:20:21] that which hath been will be and we look
[1:20:23] at that and we see over here Abraham the
[1:20:26] elected group up here on the mountain
[1:20:28] set aside with God we see over here lot
[1:20:31] the the the the the foolish virgin the
[1:20:33] halfway believer he's down there in
[1:20:35] Sodom and he's surrounded by all these
[1:20:37] unbelievers and we see that God said he
[1:20:40] would send fiery judgment to destroy
[1:20:42] that the day is going to come it'll burn
[1:20:44] as an oven so we see this pattern here's
[1:20:46] lot here's Sodom and Gomorrah here's lot
[1:20:48] over here there's Abraham up in the
[1:20:49] mountains and there comes a man walking
[1:20:52] up the road was it a man man absolutely
[1:20:56] he ate he drank he talked with
[1:20:59] Abraham he discerned the thoughts and
[1:21:01] intents of the hearts of Sarah behind
[1:21:03] him and he said I am going to visit
[1:21:08] you who was that man now that right
[1:21:12] there was the son of man now I don't
[1:21:17] have time but if you want to take a good
[1:21:18] 45 minute study we can get into it but
[1:21:21] if you go to questions and answers they
[1:21:22] asked him now I thought the pillar fire
[1:21:25] was the son of man and I heard somebody
[1:21:26] say you were the son of man and now I'm
[1:21:28] confused he says well let me explain he
[1:21:30] says that Pillar of Fire is actually not
[1:21:33] the son of
[1:21:34] man and he breaks into it and it's a
[1:21:36] really beautiful study he says that
[1:21:37] Pillar of Fire is not the son of man he
[1:21:40] says but you see Jesus Christ he was a
[1:21:42] man and that Pillar of Fire comes into
[1:21:45] the man and when the pillar of fire
[1:21:46] comes into the man now you have the son
[1:21:49] of man which is the logos the word in a
[1:21:53] body yes
[1:21:56] you
[1:21:57] see that Prophet was not the son of man
[1:22:02] and that Pillar of Fire was not the son
[1:22:04] of man but when that Pillar of Fire came
[1:22:06] down the word took control of a body we
[1:22:10] seen the thoughts and intents of the
[1:22:11] heart expressed we seen it was almighty
[1:22:14] God it was the son of man revealing
[1:22:16] himself expressing himself through that
[1:22:18] prophetic Ministry it was a son of man
[1:22:22] revealing the son of man that's the
[1:22:24] Pillar of Fire the logos the word
[1:22:26] expressed in a fleshly body that is the
[1:22:29] son of man and there coming up the road
[1:22:32] to Abraham in the tent was the pillar of
[1:22:35] fire in a
[1:22:37] body that was the son of man and he told
[1:22:40] them these things and Jesus says As it
[1:22:43] was in the days of lot as it was when
[1:22:45] Abraham was there in the mountains as it
[1:22:47] was in that time so shall it be in the
[1:22:49] revealing of the son of man just before
[1:22:51] that ending of time just before the
[1:22:52] closing of the earth there's going to be
[1:22:54] revealing just like it was
[1:22:56] then and now I want you to look at the
[1:22:59] timing it's so beautiful he
[1:23:02] says now Sarah and Abraham they they got
[1:23:04] we down till they was 100 years old and
[1:23:07] I can see Abraham he just after you've
[1:23:09] gone through Elohim son of man coming
[1:23:12] and visiting Abraham and telling him
[1:23:13] these things he says and I can see
[1:23:15] Abraham get up the next morning he said
[1:23:19] dear you know Sarah Sarah was a
[1:23:21] beautiful woman and she was young when
[1:23:24] she was young and he said you know dear
[1:23:26] your hair is turning dark again I see
[1:23:29] the wrinkles going out from under your
[1:23:30] face since last night she said well Dad
[1:23:34] I noticed that your shoulders are
[1:23:35] straightening up and oh my a few hours
[1:23:38] later he was going to get a bucket of
[1:23:39] water or something come back and he said
[1:23:41] Sarah you look beautiful she said why
[1:23:44] Abraham you look like you did when I
[1:23:47] married you he turned them back when did
[1:23:51] that
[1:23:52] happen the next morning after the son of
[1:23:55] man came walking up to their
[1:23:58] door we're not looking for another day
[1:24:00] we're not looking for another age we're
[1:24:02] not looking for another messenger we
[1:24:04] know that after that revealing of the
[1:24:06] son of man comes the next morning his
[1:24:09] body
[1:24:10] change says again he says Abraham just m
[1:24:13] Abraham the next morning getting up and
[1:24:15] he says why Sarah you know your your
[1:24:17] wrinkles are going out of your face says
[1:24:19] it over here again he says Abraham said
[1:24:21] the next morning he looked up and he
[1:24:22] said Sarah honey your eyes are turning
[1:24:25] black again your hair the Grays are
[1:24:27] leaving from
[1:24:30] it now why is that
[1:24:32] important because it shows us a pattern
[1:24:36] it shows us where we're living at today
[1:24:38] in
[1:24:40] 2024 he says here in Easter seal he says
[1:24:43] the he says if you look he says and
[1:24:45] remember after that sign was manifested
[1:24:47] fully to Abraham in his group the next
[1:24:50] thing come was that change
[1:24:54] what's the next thing to come friends
[1:24:56] are we looking for another president or
[1:24:58] another prime minister are we looking
[1:24:59] for some great Earthly thing to happen
[1:25:01] are we looking for no that's not what
[1:25:03] we're looking at we've seen the sign of
[1:25:05] the revealing of the son of man we know
[1:25:07] the hour that we're living in when we
[1:25:09] know the next thing to happen the thing
[1:25:11] that's going to happen tomorrow morning
[1:25:13] is a body change that's where we're
[1:25:15] living at how can I declare that with
[1:25:17] authority because God doesn't change and
[1:25:20] I can see what he did and I know He'll
[1:25:22] Do It Again
[1:25:25] scripture says well let me read this
[1:25:27] here and Abraham said rather that it was
[1:25:29] Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus
[1:25:31] said as it was in the days of that day
[1:25:34] Jehovah the son of man again in the form
[1:25:37] of prophetic like he was would return
[1:25:40] again at the last days just before your
[1:25:43] bodies is going to be
[1:25:45] changed Genesis 19:27 says and Abraham
[1:25:49] got up early in the morning do you know
[1:25:52] what morning that was that was body
[1:25:54] change
[1:25:56] morning he got up early in the morning
[1:25:58] and he went to the place where he stood
[1:26:00] before the Lord and he looked towards
[1:26:02] Sodom and Gomorrah and there was nothing
[1:26:04] but smoke coming
[1:26:07] up Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:26:11] and forever the Keystone of the Bible is
[1:26:13] that God doesn't change and we see here
[1:26:15] Abraham meets with the son of man
[1:26:17] revealing the thoughts and intents of
[1:26:19] the heart the next day his Earthly body
[1:26:21] is changed and he looks out the window
[1:26:23] and there's smoke coming out out of
[1:26:24] Sodom and Gomorrah that's where we're
[1:26:26] living at today we have seen the
[1:26:28] revealing of the son of man we have seen
[1:26:30] the expression of Jesus Christ made to
[1:26:32] us we have heard that he wants to do a
[1:26:34] work in our life he wants that word to
[1:26:36] come and change our mortal body he wants
[1:26:39] to transform us and we're not waiting
[1:26:41] for a million years for that to happen
[1:26:42] we're not looking for it to be some
[1:26:44] other age we know that right now where
[1:26:46] we're at the timing of God's Bible
[1:26:48] there's not the prophecies that remain
[1:26:51] for the coming of the Lord can be
[1:26:52] fulfilled within five minutes of this
[1:26:54] time right now Prophet said that 60
[1:26:56] years ago I think we're there he says
[1:26:59] within 5 minutes of this time the Lord
[1:27:00] Jesus would come he says and not break
[1:27:02] one Prophecy of the
[1:27:05] scripture so where are we
[1:27:07] at going home time you say oh well you
[1:27:11] know this is going on in politics and
[1:27:13] I've got this happening at my job I've

[1:30:31] thousands of people there looking for
[1:30:34] God to move but because they didn't
[1:30:36] recognize how he came they didn't
[1:30:38] receive their healing if somebody would
[1:30:40] have been there and cried out Jesus thou
[1:30:43] son of David have mercy on me he would
[1:30:47] have stopped and
[1:30:48] turned because because they didn't
[1:30:50] recognize his presence his power was not
[1:30:53] released to them but he came just as he
[1:30:56] promised he would
[1:30:58] come God bless you this morning I I've
[1:31:01] just I had good time talking to you

[1:31:12] you and just want to challenge you this
[1:31:17] morning is there something you have need
[1:31:20] of I ask you have you any of you ever
