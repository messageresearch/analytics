thank you Jesus and just a couple announcements or one announcement before we we start in our our message amen just for the meeting after um we'll have our regular dinner and you know we'll just start it whenever we're done lunch probably uh quarter after 1 1:30 or something but the meetings for all all that pay ties and offerings if you don't pay ties or offerings to the local loal Church you have no business in the local church business so so I mean there's there's you different ones that give to different things amen but if the the business of the church is just for ties and offerings and for those people you have the right to know everything everything there's nothing hidden amen and also when we Minister today uh uh or anytime if there's ever you know Satan's not happy you're here Satan's not happy we're here and he for sure ain't happy we're friends like that's guaranteed amen so you know what he'll try to do and so communication is just a great thing just say you know I was just thinking or I just had a thought come through my mind or I didn't even understand or I heard you I do that to my wife I love her dearly I said honey I heard this she said but I said this I said I need a hearing name but you and that's you know have to recognize amen San because you know we're in a late hour we are and and uh so God's going to say some things today because of the time that we're in amen and uh and you know in the Bible it's uh it comes as many different things you know sometimes the Bible comes as a sword sometimes it comes as a hammer sometimes it comes as the cloud and it's all in the Bible and so there'll be people today here that'll be pierced By The Sword there'll be people that are beat up by the hammer there'll be people that feel like they're LED on fire by the fire of God and there'll be people that are sitting in the cloud and I have scriptures for every one of those amen you know we were we were out last night with sister Patty and and her family some of her family her sons is a very fine gentleman extremely fine just I pray with all my heart that I see him sitting here very soon complete gentlemen um but I I told my wife come in here I seen every hour on the clock last night every hour I seen 11 something when came up about 12:30 I seen one something I seen 2:30 2 4:30 something was too early to get up amen because everything is you know we don't wrestle flesh and blood but my desire is not that you would misunderstand me amen it's not that I would misunderstand me but but let's not misunderstand God amen amen and and and it's a mystery but it's not a mystery to you but to this Badger skin it's a mystery it's hard to get it through the filter and our Prophet says some very very tremendous things like some things right out of the and just amazing things amen and and we want to be well I want to Rapture I want to go I'm going to be in the Rapture and I and I don't definitely don't want to be the one holding it up amen God help us Matthew 7 1-5 and we're going to read a bunch of scripture and uh just forgive me for that maybe we'll read a a couple and you can have your seats and and when we uh just even before I read the scriptures I want to publicly make a disclaimer and this is a a very uh uh very is I'm not promoting sin this is a no way these messages are promoting sin but we're continuing on the mystery of omnipotent God in election and it it's amazing it's just amazing amen judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye Merit it shall be measured to you again and why thou beholdest beholdest thou the Mt that is in thy brother's eye but consider not the bean that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mold that's in thine eye and behold the beam is in thine eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the mold out of thy brother's eye let's go to uh James 4 10 and 12 and James 41 and2 we're carrying on completely our message from two weeks ago humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up speak not evil one of another brethren for he that speaketh evil of his Brethren and judges his brother speak as evil of God's law but a judge there is now this is a key part here there is one lawgiver and it's not brother de and it ain't brother brandham either there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy that's election who art thou that judges another I say ouch ouch you may have your seats Lord Jesus God help me hallel help me God to to Just Surrender myself Lord Jesus to your Holy Spirit and Lord May It Be you that ministers this amazing mystery of yourself and how perfect and just it's beyond our human comprehension but you've just laid it down so perfectly God help your servant that that God I know what you fed me and God I just desire with all my heart that these amazing people the elect of God the wife of Christ could grasp could grasp this mystery that you alone are Jehovah you alone are omnipotent and you alone are the King of Kings hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be your name oh Blessed Be Your Name Hallelujah amen amen First Peter 1 12 and I'm just reading the first part of the the scripture just uh to lay the election down you know you know brothers and sisters this is not a religion and this is not a denomination and this is not Creeds or dogmas and we're not following nobody but Christ amen election according to the for knowledge of God God the Father amen let's turn over to Hebrews 51-14 and I want to lay this scripture down and this is what I want to preach on and and I I I pray in in advance that you you'll somehow be able to forgive me because it's going to look like uh it's going to look like uh you know that the house of God is for many things but it's even for correction for brother Dale so when if it feels like correction remember I'm living in a glass house too and my house got broke when God shared this with me you understand because I had to taste of the man of farce and I'm I'm just one of you amen Hebrews 51 and4 of whom we have many things to say now that's Christ it's not about a man and are hard to be uttered that's going to be today seeing you are doll of hearing now that that's not personal I'm just saying God's we're coming to maturity because we could go home this week and for and when for the time ye ought to have been teachers ye have needs that you that one teach you again for which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of the mou now I'm going to tell you ahead of time Christ is talking about the message of the hour and the prophet's been gone for a generation and it's rate full of babies and have need of the m and not the strong meat for everyone that uses the mou is unskillful in the word and unrighteous they're not even converted for he is a bab but the meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those by reason of the use have their senses their senses help me out with that word exercise to discern both good and evil amen and and I pray to God that when when the the preaching Goes Forth this morning I I know you can I know you can because I know you're part of him that your sense your Holy Ghost would discern what Christ is trying to say through just a piece of clay amen amen this is powerful stuff now you know the prophet said in this this Hebrews verses here he mentions the quotes on the message Hub about 10 times but some of the direct V quotes the one direct verse he mentions seven times and this is also wrote in 1 Corinthians 3 1-9 talking about the babes and don't don't let this offend you but I just have to be truthful in 1 Corinthians 3 it was the B because they had the doctrine of following different men including prophets said some of you follow Paul some follow paulus some go to this camp meeting praise God and somebody go to this camp meeting because he's got a plaid t-shirt and some go to this one and that one but in that scripture I understand very clearly then we you haven't read it that it says that God that's Jehovah is the only one that gives the increase he's the lawgiver he's the judge he's the only one that can give life or death and there's a whole bunch of people that are planting seeds and watering seeds and running the combine but there's only one person but put the jour a seed in election amen hallelujah here hearing the prophet said uh in Divine Healing here in a quote directly attached to this Hebrew scripture he said now you'll notice people they can't they they can sit and say well I accept the message I changed that quote he said I accept the Lord and he said you take your word for it and I would too and I can't judge them God does that but in 10 years later from now now make this personal this is the message but in 70 years later after all the greatest preachers in the world preaching the message they haven't grown any he says but in 10 years from now they've never processed a bit just staying right exactly the same place they were 10 years earlier when the prophet went off the scene amen watch this he said you know you grow daily and your heart hungers in your natural for food and he said there's something growing there there's the wife again it's everywhere he said there's something growing inside of you see when you have something inside of you it dictates who you are amen and we have clearly made the this this uh Doctrine in our church or I have at least that if you're not the wife here today of Christ you're not going to Glory CU he don't know you that's just Bible amen and there's multiple scriptures for that but here if we look at another one and this is from Hebrews 5:11 the prophet saying in uh uh the Hebrew series okay he said he said you give a baby strong meat and you'll kill it now these quotes are here for everybody to this everything is very wide open he said that's the reason that so many people here today he said oh I don't believe that and they walk away he said still babies he said they just can't understand he said they can't Gras the truth and it kills them he said Great Mighty things the bride should know today but they stumble over it now I'm going to tell you something he said the next paragraph he said the Deep spiritual Mysteries of the Bride the church is still blinded to it now listen we've been here for a long time and brother Dale don't enjoy preaching as much as going in the Rapture hello our goal is to go into Rapture our goal ain't to build a big church I mean if that happens but we want to take them with us you understand our goal ain't to build a gold steeple our goal our one goal is a Rapture amen and so let's let's just look at some things the prophet says and and I and I I apologize CU I never preach serieses that's just that's not who I am but this one is is huge amen and so this is part two of two weeks ago he said here just laying a foundation I mentioned this quote Wednesday night for those that were here he said that's what the matter with a lot of our old cold formal churches today he said they got churches full of rotten eggs now you're I'm going to just tell you and it's fine if you don't agree with me or not it makes no difference to me CU but if you don't believe that you're his wife you're in trouble trouble amen the only thing they are are professors great message preachers I added that and they've never been with the mate that sounds like marriage to me it really does the mate Jesus Christ the only thing to do is to clean it out and to start over again with men and women who's been in contact with the mate Jesus Christ he mentions that again to his bride his church his wife amen and now how true it is how true that it is to see the mainting time now see we have to have this before we go into Rapture this is in 61 this is in uh a message here the fourth month he said he said now see it's the mainting time that sounds like marriage the mate now ought to be the mainting time when the church gets in contact with Christ and gets the real genine baptism of the Holy Ghost and when that happens there'll be things happen in your body that change it amen amen remember remember brother Dale and I hope you're with me and support me in this remember the quote we read about the prophet saying about that he was a minister and he should wear clergy clothes remember that quote and he said did Jesus wear clergy clothes and he said those are just man's ideas I'm just wearing this suit so everybody's happy I'm wearing a suit coat that's not Christ the devil's wearing a coat too you see no there's nothing wrong with the coat but watch the man's ideas and I promise Christ and and my kids can tell you this and brother Jim can way back in the church that we have enough to minister on then we don't need brother Dale's ideas we don't need brother Dale's ideas and this is no offense to you but we don't need your ideas either amen like we're not going to take mine but we're not going to take yours either amen now now brother Nathan mentioned this and I looked this up and and so he mentioned this yesterday he said but I'm going to read it this is a think command filter this is right this is four months before the prophet died he said now the church filter gets the membership and the things like that when they let them get through with everything and still belong to the church and they get more members and what if you want to what what if we want to the church to night and to filter everybody out besides those who were genuinely word born Christians brother Nathan mentioned this remember if we filtered out everybody that wasn't genuine word born this is our Prophet talking now this ain't brother Dale so you can throw the rocks at the tombstone there'd be many blank sermons preached up against the wall tonight he talk he talked to the message churches he said there' be many blank sermons preached up against the wall that sounds like Wednesday night here sometimes he said it's true because it went through the word filter amen amen now now that's right before the prophet died that's with full upto-date Revelation he said and if we and if I I've got one discern discerned in my heart I hope that everyone listening to me has the same thing that God take us through your filter as David said try me and prove me and see if there be any evil in brother Dale because I brother Dale wants to go to Rapture so I'm not concerned about pleasing men I'm concerned about pleasing Christ Jehovah his Sweet Holy Spirit that's going to be my judge whether I go up and get a body change amen hallelujah God help us so so we're at the end brother Braham said we're at the end 70 years ago and so he's not coming for a little tiny girl he's coming for a mature lady that's that's that's accepted the seed of God and and we're going to a supper we're going to a actually a real party and I'm going to be there and I tell you what you're going to want earplugs they're going to have to be holy ghost filled earplug CU you're going to see the noisiest new body you've ever seen in your life oh Hallelujah can you imagine when we oh no you can't you you cannot imagine but I like trying I like trying amen so we see here in Hebrews 4:12 and I'm just mentioning this quick because we already did Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is the sword and Jeremiah 23:29 the word of God is the hammer and and you can get these later and Deuteronomy 4:24 and Jeremiah 5:14 God is the fire amen and I want you to notice something that happened in our day was the cloud do you know what the cloud represents oh this is powerful represents him coming down himself he didn't send an angel to come down in the cloud he came himself amen the head came down Hallelujah and the C Cloud showed respect and fear of reverence because it was Jehovah himself that came in the presence of the cloud and you can see that in Luke 9:34 and here here the cloud the same Cloud that over saddled Mary and the same Cloud that over saddled Jesus on Mount Transfiguration Hallelujah and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased Hallelujah is the same Cloud that's here this morning ministering his word Amen brother Dale can't make this stuff up amen hallelujah the rock this morning is in the word word The Rock The Fortress the strength it's in Psalms 18:2 and that's why you when when the word of God Goes Forth everybody else hears something different because the word of God is many different things and so see you thought we thought we had God figured out we said well we got the message of the hour praise God we got them figured out he said you've been putting God in a box well we take brother Brown's message and and it it did it on the secrets is was Amos what is it Amos 38 uh the God will do nothing except you reveal the secrets to his servants of prophets there's no doubt about that at all but you know that same Prophet said that God don't show His prophets everything Hallelujah and God only shows His prophets when he needs to show His prophets and you know I'm going to I'm going to show you in this series you know there's a difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament you know Moses wrote the Old Testament and that was law but but brother Dale ain't living under law praise God I don't have to get a lamb or a dove or or uh any of those things to kill amen and my sin ain't just covered I feel a lot better than that I didn't sweep it under the rug and pull the mat down it's completely gone this house is good for allergies because there's no dust around and Paul bought Paul brought Grace and so people mix up the scriptures from the Old Testament and the New Testament and yes the old testament's there to Shadow and give us types and shadows but there a physical type and Shadow of the real Holy Spirit but the election amen changed everything amen I you know I know this is going to shock you so just hang on to your seat belts for a minute but you know that there's things in the Bible there's things in the Bible now this is this was this is our absolute this is Brother Dale's absolute this was brother Brown's absolute this was brother Brown's quotebook by the way and brother Brown came to just explain the scriptures oh that's what that me oh yeah that oh oh I didn't understand that but you know every one of those men of God had their own opinions and it wasn't just brother B there's opinions right in here I I know that's scaring you but I'm going to prove it to you I don't even have the scripture but it was the greatest prophet of all Paul brought Grace now let me ask you a question who ordained marriage Jehovah himself Jesus himself but Paul said I would that you would be like me and not married ouch ouch oh ouch oh I didn't like that now if we would have listened to Paul's message and not followed Jesus message I wouldn't have been born and yet God used Paul like no other man in I'll tell yeah I'm showing you that to show you see don't worship man because even Paul had an idea now he disclaimers that he says I'm saying this by permission but I would that you would be like me and you would not marry I'm glad that was IND doctrin you see so so see we can't put God in a box that's that's God's trying to bring us to maturity I'm not trying to leave the word not one spe we're not leaving the word we're not even leaving the message you know I I'm going to throw this out here let me let me throw this out to I'm I'm going to shock you again you know when brother Brown went behind the the the curtain of time and and he said they they told him they said now you'll be judged for the message you brought and he said will Paul be judged they said yeah Paul will be judged everybody will be judged for each H and he said but I preach what Paul preached and they said what we're resting in that okay but see there's things that Paul brought that were different than the Old Testament oh yeah a whole bunch so don't get hung up with the Old Testament oh yeah you don't think so because they pulled up their fist in that day you know when we were at John and laa Garrett there's some really tremendous videos on uh oh my way my brain uh on the Bible and it showed how in the Bible they were actually human beings like when maew was the tax collector in the Jewish C he wasn't really popular a lot of people never he was a that aw hello hello amen so we see that there was many things but Paul put the fist up with Peter Paul put the fist up with Peter when Peter struggled with the Old Testament and saying I well Peter was a hypocrite actually he never had a backbone you know it's installed right here between your shoulder blades because he he acted different around different people and they're not sitting here CU see if if it was the Jews around Peter actually like Bo you have to be circumcised with the but then if he was withes but if they show up the same time Peter really and Paul called him out for it he said you're a hypocrite he said it don't matter if you're circum or not circumcised it's a tye of the SP so you don't think they had struggles back then uhhuh uhhuh that's just like and and and this is God because I don't even have this in my filter and I didn't even study this so please forgive me but if any one of you scholarly people could look it up but you know we already said Moses wrote the Old Testament and it and it's for us the type in Shadow but it's but just is not direct watch what I'm saying I already did I show you an example about circumcision is that true what I showed you Peter and Paul literally took up arms they actually had strong words I don't have the scripture in front of me because I wasn't supposed to preach that today but God had other plans amen but that also goes for the qualifications of a minister do you know the qualifications of a minister in the Old Testament that Moses wrote under the law are completely different than than Paul wrote in the New Testament amen now if you still believe that you must have the skin cut off and physical circumcised you're Peter because if we went by the law of Moses and the qualifications of a minister we'd be in big trouble we'd be in big trouble because qualification in a minister under Moses remember this was the law remember they got in trouble if they didn't wash their hands three times before they ate the corn and they couldn't go in the cornfield they definitely wouldn't go to the restaurant on Sunday because they would die of the plague that was the law but we realize that the rest was our sweet holy spirit inside us not how good we are on Sunday J you're going to to start a tra because you just that's how myb was raised I know that clearly I I was raised I didn't kick a ball on Sunday I didn't ride a bike on Sunday and if my dad had to drive farther than the GU thing he wouldn't buy gas on Sunday and you don't have to worry to the rest but that was Moses's law and so the qualifications of a minister and I don't even have the scripture because I'm not preaching on this but this is just coming up am if you have a broken arm you can't Minister if you have a if you're unable to uh birth children you're not able to minister as a man now we're ads you know what I mean those are all in the qualifications of your wife must be a virgin that's not what Pauls now if you want to take all those other ministers out a Lotus because there's a lot of people BR there's a lot of people didn't want the family to get in Begg they went to the doctor and you know the head something you know and things like that and and a lot of people got a cked nose and if if you got if you have a birth mark it's the same verse you look it up you don't change me and I ain't read it in 100 years I hav read since the pr in the house if you have a birth you can't I got a I got a little he tip there but Paul came and brought a completely different message and he said if you're the man of one wife period and your house is in order I don't care if you don't believe that it just identifies who you are you're Peter so we see here in the election in the Bible I I'm and I'm going to go to a really amazing character and I'm going to need some some I'm going to need OT and Felix you can get ready but we see in Aon that Joseph lied in the Bible Abraham lied in the Bible Isaac lied in the Bible and Rahab lied in the Bible what are we going to do with the scripture that says there will be no Liars in heaven well I'll give you the answer Jehovah I'm nipplet don't ask me CU like my brain's only three pounds but his is omnipotent El in the Bible you know and and please forgive me I love there's not one person in here I wouldn't give my right finger for the elect in the Bible David took all his clothes off Isaiah took his clothes off for three years that was a long time can you imagine and Saul took his clothes off with all the prophets that's the ministers now now this ain't meant to hurt but you know I preached on this and I read a quote about I preached on through that we had visitors from London and I preached on where brother Brown said I said I and this ain't all my notes either because this is Rerun he said he said I preached to thousands of naked people and then he said no no actually tens of thousands now I don't care if you like that or not that was brother Bram talking so you're G to you know like you have to take that up with him go visit the cemetery and and and then he talks about breastfeeding and then he finishes that quote and he said now if you had your mind in the right place that wouldn't bother you and you know I preach that and immediately after I preached that like like not even five minutes there was a brother that don't attend here met me at the door and he said now if a sister come in in a two-piece bathing suit he said I'd give her my coat said not in this church you won't I said now brother Brown I asked said brother Brown now it's fine if you want to give him the Cod what you do with Isaiah and Elijah said he was there so we're going to give him a c and if you think I'm getting off on something I want to read something the prophet said and this is in 6107 and this is amazing this just blew my mind and this is free we can pass this around after and all that see see I want to be real and if we're just religious like there's some nicer churches in town watch this here brother Brown he said please explain First Corinthians this is in being God being misunderstood this is kind of 61723 I believe this is 61 but he said please explain 1 Corinthians in the 14th chapter verse 34 and 35 let not a woman and be silent in church for it pertaineth to them not to speak and you know he's reading the scripture and that and so they ask the question for if it's a shame for a woman to speak in church now the question is now if a woman with short hair speaks in tongues in the church is that the Holy Spirit or is that a false Spirit Hallelujah anybody have confidence in the prophet is it okay to hi thank you brother ber God bless you Hallelujah well I tell you what I sure love his backup plan Hallelujah paragraph 16 or 60 sorry I have a few things highlighted here he said now this is a real hard question now I I just want to put a little dis here this might shock you what it says you're going to need therapy we didn't bring any pure oxygen to church but it couldn't be arranged uh but I can only answer this the best that I know now I can't I couldn't be the judge oh now bless God brother Dale's been a judge before come on now you I'm not the only one that's been in that car hello now I couldn't judge now this is a woman with short hair speaking in tongues in the service oh bless God that Jezebel I wish you wouldn't come to this place now by the way this is Avail I'm not he said now I think there's many times that we get another question down here and here's somewhere where that goes right along with that he says but if a person was speaking in tongues and they're anointed of God see they may be out of order that may be true but they may be doing something that's uh anointed of God now what he's saying is they may be out of order because they cut their but the speaking in Tong part is Anointed of God what he says and they Sor wait I got mixed up he said but I think that there's so many times that I got another the person speaking in tongues may be Anointed God they may be out of order and that may be true and they may be doing something that's not right talking about cut head now this is the prophet but I wouldn't want to say nothing that it wasn't the Holy Spirit I wouldn't know well you know why in a lot of places that a lot of people knew more than the prophet they thought they just thought that's a joke amen so watch let's carry on is are we doing okay amen I I we're going to a mature church so we're going to leave this place amen uh he says but I wouldn't want to say nothing against it wasn't the holy spirit because I wouldn't know he said now there's many times that people now now this is where you got to hang on there's many times that people misjudge one another and that's a bad thing to do now we read a scripture on judging now see that's the only way we're going to continue to have Fellowship thank you sister Donna there's one person that believes that amen no amen cuz see if we start judging one another said bless God I couldn't do that but bless God you know I I you know bless good you know one respects the person that if you're judged then you're guilty of the whole law so watch this he says caring on he said now there's many times that we misjudge one another and that's a bad thing to do he said said you say why she's got short hair and she's wearing her dress too short bless God doesn't she know that no man will see God without Holiness he said that that's not the Holy Spirit upon her talking about her clothes and her cut hair don't do that don't do that that's not right but you know but you don't know what's in that woman's heart heart now let's go let's just go back to that person that comes in maybe in a bikini now watch this the Bible says that no man comes to the father unless the father draw now her bikini is out of order but I ain't seen her heart it'd be very unusual for a person to come to church unless the father drew them and see what I mean that situation okay watch this so he said you're know the one that and he said you don't know nothing about it he's remember remember the remember the woman at the bar and the prophet judged her and remember that the when he when he contacted the woman's Spirit she shared all she went through he said you know the Holy Spirit would would make her conduct herself a little better you know that may be the truth but I'll tell you something tell you you and I let God now here's where we can do really good let God do the Judgment keep it on the Min and I'm going to blow your mind it's still coming he said let's let's you and I just pray for that person and that'll show and that God will show them the light amen how sometimes here some time ago a man met me aside and he said I had a piano teacher or piano player this does not apply here this is a prophet talking now I kind of felt like that when I preached on the two-piece bikini and the brother that don't go here met me right at the door right after so well I would give her my well you wouldn't know what I would do to him if he did that in church because it wouldn't be he said and I had a now now any let's just anybody's got confidence in the prophet again we got brother Bernard's hand last time sister okay now we got two people brother we got double we're going ahead he said now this is a holy ghost filled Vindicated prophet he said I had a piano player a short time ago and she had a minister and you know she ch and was and man teing pieces tell me more he said a man out there tearing pieces and he said and you call yourself a p preacher he said said I certainly don't agree and you know that that the skirt part up here and the two pieces skirt so and one of them is down here and kind of up here so he's talking about one's kind of like down here and one's kind of up here this is the Prophet this ain't brother preach I just press play and Obey forgive me the kind of skirt like they wear so it's real thin and it shows her under so now it's not just a minir but I can see the flowers on underwear whoa and I was around here and he said I don't think it should be done like that and I really don't but I couldn't they might they might just be spirit filled as anybody now he's talking about this sister with a SE Min skirt that's in two pieces and there's a break in here and she's got cut hair now you know brother Dale had to chew on this for few months you know remember I kept on giving you sneak picks of this message coming is because I was I was eating some meat and it had drizzle in it I'm like oh my goodness what is that but watch this and he said so but she might be just as spirit filled as anybody else he said I don't know God knows that and he said I wouldn't condemn it that woman and say that she's going to Hell by her sight well what are we going to do with no man will see God without Holiness the answer to that question is again Jehovah that's right I I know the devil don't want you to hear this you can be sure of it I'll sleep like a baby tomorrow night and the same person here in church had a lady and she had long hair and long Church long hair and a long dress and she had a buz saw like a DeWalt chainsaw God hallelujah and he said wearing their clothes neatly they should be an example of sweetness and motherly and sisterly he's talking about the woman with long hair and a long skirt he said but when you're quickly when you're real quickly to condemn somebody her and drive her away by throwing her a coat you might harm that Young born baby and so I would that is paragraph 67 if anybody would like to read it it's rest right here everybody's welcome to take a look he said now ain't it funny that the people in brother bram's day had the nerve to come and tear him to pieces wow you see I read that for a reason and there's a bunch more here we can't put God in a box we can't just draw a line on the wall and say well God's like this this this that because God will step out of the box and then what do we do amen and that takes Revelation and that takes discernment and that takes an omnipotent God dwelling in you to discern the contact of another omnipotent God that maybe's in a baby form and they're not really all got all the food that you know about but remember what brother Brown said about the people that were babes they've been preached to for years and they ain't grew up yet now what about the person that ain't been preached to at all wow and he said if you don't agree with me he said that's okay okay he said you see we misjudge these things many times and he said let's always try to think the very best of everyone who's trying to do right we don't know their hard unless you have discernment in this case he didn't even know that wellow he felt like she had a good spirit but our Prophet had discernment he said don't you don't say that they haven't got the right spirit cuz listen now I'm going to say something that will really stab you really stab you for a minute so just be still just a minute the holy spirit is speaking through speaking through a hypocrite exactly I've seen it done he's talking about hypocrites could speak in tongues a hypocrit could do all the things that could impersonate amen so it's not just by it's it's just not by writing it down and figuring God out amen you see what I mean and we we've hurt people in the past you know we're not supposed to have the spirit of Satan where we eat and devour our own we're all in different levels now you know I'm not promoting Min skirts and cut hair and no no and see through so no no not at all it's a it's sin but like could do but do we believe that God could actually change that person supernaturally without offending that person you know like how do we know how God rules the heart of a man but we in our flesh I'm going to fix that I'm going to fix it I'm not you know just out last week and start I said she's used to living with brother Bernard he just looks at something it just comes together because it's a fear I said I look at something and it falls apart me but we think we're all mechanics and we're going to fix God and we've actually hurt the picture no this is what our Prophet was talks about and he goes on here in this quote and I I'm skipping a bunch here please forgive me he's talking about the time when he was he he first came into the Pentecostal people and two people spoke in tongues the first time he ever heard it and he said wow he said I want that and he and he and he wanted to to get to know the people and one was a genuine believer yes sir and the other one uhhuh you remember and then he talks so long on the quote that he forgets the question I love that I love brother Brown he forgets he said now the woman was speaking in tongu said now now woman with short hair speaks in tongues in the church and this Spirit he say the holy spirit is a false spirit so he red do the question again and I'd like to would it be okay if I just finish part of this page now he said now you see now I wouldn't say nothing oh bless God there's a lot of message people should hear that now if our Prophet wouldn't say something but we think we're going to fix it really he said and if you thought the woman wasn't really exactly right having short hair and I believe in you know when he mentions he said but let's believe that she's got the Holy Ghost and if she's in the church I'm going to believe that she has he said did you know that once in a while we might EX examine and find out that we might have a little something wrong oh no bless God I don't have nothing I was born in the church I cut my teeth on the back too I wish there was the front you amen maybe we have a little something wrong too he said you know that's kind of right and he said you know so some somebody might have to tell something a lot of the time people has told me a lot of things that was wrong and what I'm doing wrong and and he said I appreciate it he said now let's say this let's say we believe whatever we believe but if the woman's not exactly a Christian if she's just putting it on God don't judge her that's right and moral and all these things and she's doing that right God will take care of that we don't believe that we don't believe that because I actually had two people that come and said they give the the woman a coat in the Bikini so we actually don't trust the God we say we do God will take care about and he said let's believe that the spirit that's on the woman is the holy spirit see because we don't know and he said now if the interpretation the holy spirit gives he said he's talking here he said if if the person looking like that went to curse Christ or curse the elect something then he said it's very easy to identify who they are amen now you you know I disclaimer that I'm not promoting that we all know for the Bible is very clear but do you see how we have family members that are going to come in this church there's people outside this church in this town are going to come in this church you say how do you know that brother because God told me that I see signs of it every single week you know the people across the road in the white house for no reason at all twice say something like unbelievable com like right out of the blue they bought it one they said we're just so glad that you're just our neighbor in the church and like and you're Dwight's best friend multiple multiple text for no reason just boom boom I've never went to the restaurant with them and they've never came in this church you don't think they're watching you walk in here oh y just let God be God and and and I'll tell I'll do my best to ju if I just take care of myself I'll be more than busy you know what I mean and see that way we can stay together till the Rapture amen because it's just everybody taking care you see me amen and then when these new ones come in they're babies they're going to need milk and just guide them on don't tell them oh for goodness say do not tell them God sent a prophet God sent many prophets the Prophet maybe tell them Jesus Loves You Jesus died on the cross for you amen and if you're part of him you're going to go back to him how about talking about Jesus that's right amen of course we know about Jesus more plainly because of a prophet we know that because of the whole Bible of prophets amen amen let's just move on and I want to go to a couple of spots and we won't be long witness here here Joseph in jere uh Genesis 4633 and 34 and we're we're going to read that and I don't want to have a couple of the boys help me and I want to preach on on the Prophet Elijah and I'm telling you what I needed I I'm telling you well we got to get to the Prophet Elijah that was just unbelievable amen Genesis 46 and 33 and it shall come to pass that when Pharaoh shall call thee and shall say what is thy occupation that ye shall say we are servants trade has been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that may that ye may dwell in the land of Goen Joshua told his dad to Li now that's premeditating lying I think it's pretty obvious to know that Joshua was or Joseph was one of gods amen now we're not condoning lying but is this in the Bible what are we going to do with that we're g to have what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to leave that in God's hands you see see and their day if you were a sheeper for every Shepherd is an Abomination unto the Egyptians I'm skipping David here because I think David's going to be a whole sermon in itself David had a couple issues just a couple whoa but David was God's elect see what I'm trying to say so when we looked at God's elect say oh David you all this and the people living with David oh my goodness they needed imagine I steep down but when we go into it God killed all the deacons and let David di V cuz you know see when we judge this you know what are we going to do with the scripture says touch not my anointed and do the an the ones the people with the Holy Ghost that's not just ministers and do my prophets no harm the anointed is everybody if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not anointed you know you know In the Flesh we treat the people that we dislike the most the worst or sorry the people that we love the most we treat the wor brother to yours if you did that to me I'd punch you in the eye and we think we can get away with it see the people you're close to you show who you really are and so we're close to each other and we're going to see who each other are but we don't need to worry about the other person because brother Dale's got a seven day a week job just take care brother do see do to me amen we sure do so here here is a example now I I'll can I read this scripture I'll come back up but I I want to just do it from memory is that all right here El and a he say I'm going to read this just interpreted allou the week before know he that my that on the right and this was this was a and he but he let's read it first Kings 20 35- 38 and Vicki make sure we get this up because this is just right out of the Bible you know I can't even dream about stories like this first vers 35 and a certain man of the sons of the Prophet said unto his neighbor and the now I told you the story so I'm just cutting the scripture short you can read this first Kings 20 35- 38 said unto his neighbor in the word of the Lord smite me I pray thee and the man refused to Smite him that is verse 35 does everybody see that now how in the world did the the the prophet think that his brother in the church was going to kill him verse 36 and then he said unto him because thou Hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord behold as soon as thou depart from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he has was departed from him Allon found him and slayed him now is that fair do I even understand that can we put God in a box are we trying to understand a sovereign God in election you see what I mean God stretching our thinking he's taking us out of a denominational baby a message baby and bringing us on to True men and women that are of full age that can take the raw meat the word of God God the bottom line is God is God and you're not going to understand God all the time like I'm just like and this comes to me and I'm like I'm going to preach on this 37 and then he found another man and said smite me I pray thee and the man smote him so that the smiting he wounded him and so the prophet departed and waited for the King by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face so what are we going to do with the scripture touch not my anointed there's two brothers trying to kill the prophet one that refused the one that obeyed the scripture died and the one that didn't obey the scripture Liv like whoa would we like to look at what the prophet said in questions and answers he said why did Elijah stand there when God give the Old King into aab a a ahab's hands and he told Ahab kill the king and Ahab refused to do it and Elijah this is questions and answers and Elijah the prophet uh uh there's a word here you're GNA have to help me out because my wife ain't here s n t r y Sentry thank you now the meaning of senty is someone who stands guard or watches against an intruder or unwelcome activity centry and Elijah the prophet had a Sentry so he was standing guard for unrounded unwanted entry they give the example like a guard dog that BS when somebody comes in that they don't know that's a prophet's job okay so the prophet Elijah standing there Sentry and said smite me with thy sword and he wow and then he told another man smite me and the pro and the man hid him with the sword and cut him and he wrapped himself up and disguised and he stood there and here came Ahab Riding on His Chariot and he said what standest thou here about and he said well I was the senty I was standing on guard I was the senty and I was given to care care over a man and he smoke me the prophet's lying now oh my goodness I should have put another liar down in the Bible this is Elijah he's lying to the king he said I was put guard over these people and he smot me to care over a man and he smot me and ran away and he said let him let him go and they told me if I did I'd have to pay for it with my own life so now the prophet's a liar too well will you have to pay and and so the prophet and he said well you will have to pay with your own life and he unrapped himself he remember he was disguised and he unwrapped himself in front of the king and said thus saith the Lord because thou didn't murder the the king down there you'll pay for it with your own life that's exactly right amen so you know the message has been guilty and forgive me I I'm not insulting the message but the message Believers have been guilty of thinking they know everything I'll say it for you amen bless God and many times it's just man's ideas Hallelujah let's look at would it be okay and maybe we'll close on this note and then our top character will be David and and there's multiple other Char is this okay amen I I'm trying to show I I'm not I'm not promoting sin that's that's that's a million miles from the truth yes oh if you only knew how far that was from the truth I believe in Holiness I believe in a woman looking like a woman and I think they're beautiful looking like a woman and a man looking like a man and having a backbone and being a man and a Gentleman and holding the door so it's wife don't even know what the car handles for because he opens the door for her Treat Her Like a Lady and tip her hat like when brother Bram was here what happened to those days you know you go to Uganda with me uh brother Carson and sister Sharon and all the you Jared I got Jared talked into going and the sisters come and take your plate and your silverware and they kneel down in front of you I think they're praying to me or worshiping me no it's just your culture it's respect you see what I mean so so and and and it and it's it's it's re it's it's not bad is what I'm saying it's it's not necessary but it's not evil you see what I mean but but we get I and and I'm going to close my iPad because that's the only way I'll even then um but sometimes things just aren't exactly how you think sometimes let me rephrase it sometimes they aren't exactly like brother Dale even thinks let's just read a couple quotes and and we we need uh you know we're doing good as but uh we have other and and uh so you know so we we look at the scripture and my my my heart's desire now you're going to have to discern this I can't show you my heart but my heart's desire is to be aund I don't want permissive will I want nothing but pure gold spiritually speaking I want the absolute truth and nothing but the truth and I want to feel God see God touch God everything God every service amen huh remember I'm not being this is more real than the yeah you're breathing but people you know and so and and you have the full right the full right especially people that pay ties you have the full right to come to me in private say brother Dale you know I told you now I made a disclaimer I'm going to disclaimer it again but I forgot today forgive me please I told you the last time I preached two weeks ago I said I'm going in this ditch anybody remember that I said I'm going in this ditch because the prophet said sometimes you got to go in this Stitch to pull you out of the rod on the other side but I don't want to be in the ditch I want to be right down the center you see to me I I truly do but I I'm overemphasizing because we're caught in a big rut over here and the ground's all hardened we can't pop the tire out amen amen so watch what the prophet says here about something and I'm going to tell you right now there's almost 100% of you won't believe this but it's still what the prophet said he said then in the church here he said we have our own doctor he's talking about brandom Tabernacle he said this a 59 quote e month he said ' we have our own Doctrine and he said sometimes it leaks out amongst people who comes and says well brother brandham said so and so those things well we got and brother Bram said well we got to have a Doctrine right now you know in our country not that it's a good country but it just happens that we're here this morning um to have a church in a terrible number you have to have a constitution that's just like the law it's you know it's more for the government than for us amen but you know we just write it as close to this as we can so so here's brother Brown saying in Bram Tabernacle we have a Doctrine but sometimes it leaks out in two years down the road in 61 he says now if there's any questions on Doctrine he said don't ask me he said I'd rather you ask your pastor he said you see because it's his duty now I me to tell you something and and and we it's not this don't even apply but you know most people would come to me and they'd say well you know brother now that I know you thinking I'm having a big head I never said that brother Bram said it in 61430 in the super sign he said it's your duty he said if you carry if he's carried you safely this far are with God he'll carry you all the W of the way through so you just go ask your pastor Doctrine because I don't like to answer those questions wow but you know what message believer say well brother Brown said brother Brown said brother Brown said brother Brown I say it too but the problem problem with that is brother Braham said lots of things and it's got to be the holy spirit that brings it together perfectly lined up with this here book called The Holy word of God and and and dad's not saying that brother BR was wrong and it's not saying that but brother Brown's Revelation grew and also early in his ministry he was preaching to babes and his Revelation grew and so his message message changed it was the same God but like for example and I mentioned this before so I'll say it really fast when when he first started preaching he said when you get saved I'm not building a kingdom go to any church you want then he said no then when the seals come out he said come out of her my people wait a minute that's a direct contradiction come out of her my people and be not partaker of her plagues and her sins and now we've come out but we haven't went into the holy of holies amen so now now he also said if you're to know those that labor among you and if your Holy Ghost tells you that that the person standing here is off the word of God run for your life man he said that run for your life don't stay here and say brother Dale led me to hell because you have the Holy Ghost too but don't stay here also and sit here for 10 years 15 years 50 years and be the same size because you won't eat the food that's coming from table that's what he said the first quot remember yeah well that God that's not the way I se it when I was in commun with god well you know that would be a pretty stupid businessman to have the fight Ministry [Music] amen hallelujah so we're we're going on progressive revelation now we're in 6207 we moved ahead another year and a half and here's something else he said and we would see Jesus and you know brother Brown said this and and praise God for the message Hub he said ask your pastor 15 times so if you establish that by the word of God let two or three Witnesses be established it wasn't just something he said and you know you could take different quotes on that where he said it more times he said and the religious question that you might have in your mind I would advise you to ask your pastor and not me because every man lead in his flock and if he's the pastor and he's LED you safely this far trust them the rest of the way and if he's brought you up and you've been filled with the Holy Spirit and he's and the life that you trust that you're living why trust him the rest of the way because he's able to answer your questions Wow Let's stand God help us God help us to be you know God help me I'm I'm a sinner saved by grace Amazing Grace amen and and it's not no big ey and no little you we're brothers and sisters in Christ it's not because I'm fatter or this Pulpit could be level amen it's not like an elevation or nothing like that just it's just God it's just God Amen Hallelujah but I want to show you the real God I don't want to show you the brother Dale God I want to show you the God God the God God that's my whole heart because I I promis God I'm not going to get there them said I told you to tell them and you never did or that that's not that's not going to happen with this person amen I'm trying to show you the real real God but God's trying to tell you that there's some of you who been sitting around for your whole life you're wearing the same siiz pants spiritually speaking because you don't get confidence in nobody and the person you maybe got a little bit of confidence in he died like 70 years ago and you're in trouble you're in trouble you're just plain in trouble you're just plain in trouble amen understanding an omnipotent God in election H that's tremendous God God help me amen you know right when I think I got you know it's like pinning a tail on a donkey that's a poor example but you know right when I think I got it perfect it moves oh man oh God help me I hope I hope God won't show you my faults and and I hope I hope he'll hide them from you but you see what I mean we have to be mature amen and and and we're following God not man and and and you look at how the prophet dealt with these things look at how look at how the brothers attacked him look look at what he said tore me to pieces that wasn't just some friendly meaning in the office like oh well you know I think I see something a little bit different no no they dropped you know I went you know I told you we went and seeing j or Lan's family you know and and we had great time and and different things but we'd went and seen her older brother and her sister-in-law oldest brother you know they'd come over you know their kids are all grown and and stuff she has the doctors have give her so long to live and he can barely walk and they're they're a wreck you know and we're just we're just trying to be available if God wants to do something before they leave this earth and he told me something he said Dale he said my boy still talk about it when we come over to your house like 35 years ago and he was putting his little boys in hockey and they were Americans so they didn't know nothing about hockey and I was telling them all about the equipment and I was young and stupid then and you know all those things and I said well the most important thing about your equipment the most important thing when you fit yourself for hockey is that if you want to fight you drop boys talk about that all the time they never forgot you said when you buy your equipment if there's somebody you want to punch in the nose make sure you can drop the glovs you know spiritually speak I don't like being lonely Heaven's going to have a lot of amazing people in it and I want to be there but there can be a lot of amazing people here on Earth but we can't have the the attitude bless God I'm going to drop the gloves you know in the body of Christ that's not the most important thing if you think brother Dale's wrong just keep it to yourself I mean if I mean if you think I'm off the word you come and show me or but you know like many of the prophets in the Old Testament people thought we wrong but you know this might surprise me they actually had they actually had communion with God too you know there's times that God's servants actually have communion with God and God's not the author of confusion so something's wrong amen something wrong God help us God help me pray for I'm not perfect no but I see these things and I say wow an amazing God there's just I mean we we probably got two more messages on this just people right out of the Bible David's almost his own his own message David's right-hand man and left-hand man was his half sisters two sons and they both God took their life both of them and we know David had major issues but he was elected amen amen God help us amen open my eyes Lord we want to see Jesus to reach and touch him and say that we love
