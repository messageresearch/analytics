[20:43] amen
[20:44] God bless you this morning it's just a
[20:46] great privilege and thank you musicians
[20:49] for the song service and Jared and just
[20:52] great to be here amen we're just going
[20:54] to ask our young magicians to come just
[20:56] as we make some announcements and man we
[20:58] we believe brother Jr was going to
[21:00] minister for us but uh
[21:02] because of circumstances he let me know
[21:07] at quarter to ten last night that he
[21:09] couldn't come and I figured brother Jim
[21:12] was snoring by then because brother Jim
[21:14] was going to pick him up and
[21:16] and uh
[21:18] so I thought I was Minister and I called
[21:21] brother Jim and I was I
[21:24] I was completely prepared maybe tired
[21:27] but completely prepared
[21:30] and
[21:35] so I never said nothing to brother Jim
[21:37] and brother Jim came in this morning he
[21:39] said you know I was awake in the night
[21:41] preaching to myself
[21:45] I said well man if you get a preach to
[21:47] yourself
[21:49] amen so just pray for him he actually
[21:52] yeah left his notes at home and I know
[21:55] how that feels it kind of feels kind of
[21:57] feels like you got your air balloon
[21:59] poked with a needle
[22:01] but God said God knows everything amen
[22:03] God just knows everything you know
[22:06] man and just also
[22:08] just some uh just even on that same note
[22:12] you know God uses all one of us you know
[22:14] it just just only for a second it just
[22:17] you know
[22:19] God never God made us gods
[22:23] but not to each other
[22:27] I'm studying that
[22:29] and you know the prophet said people
[22:31] came to the prophet and they said what
[22:33] should we call you
[22:35] Dr Branham Reverend Branham
[22:38] Bishop Branham man of God Branham
[22:43] and he said if you love me
[22:47] if you love me
[22:49] call me brother Brown
[22:51] if you love me
[22:53] because see we don't have
[22:55] Bishops and
[22:57] you know we're all men of God
[23:01] just kind of be careful with that you
[23:03] know man we we believe in respect but
[23:06] you know what I mean
[23:09] God help us we don't have
[23:12] a hierarchy in the fivefold ministry and
[23:16] or in the bride of Christ
[23:18] we're all brothers and sisters men of
[23:20] God because we were all made in the
[23:22] image of a man
[23:24] Christ Jesus
[23:26] that's beautiful that's powerful amen
[23:29] and and so I'm not preaching but but uh
[23:32] just pray for me I do have a message
[23:33] that's uh
[23:35] either gonna have to be two messages or
[23:37] it's going to be in two and a half hour
[23:39] message and I'm not sure how that's
[23:41] gonna
[23:42] yo but uh and also I I had another
[23:45] testimony for for brother Jim you know
[23:47] got so I said that before I said God can
[23:49] work through us all you know
[23:53] this week
[23:55] or
[23:56] this week
[23:58] God lay something on brother Jim's heart
[24:01] and he said it you know it wasn't Divine
[24:03] and it wasn't like spoken out of the
[24:05] hour and it wasn't but it said it was
[24:06] just something that was there and it
[24:09] kind of wanted to go away
[24:10] so he obeyed it
[24:13] and did it
[24:17] and the person
[24:19] that was the repercussion of him obeying
[24:24] said we never had one crumb
[24:29] once back
[24:31] of food in our house
[24:34] God just randomly looked over the body
[24:37] of Christ and just said
[24:43] the person that got it
[24:45] or we had one Speck of food
[24:47] he said boy God sure knows what he's
[24:50] doing
[24:51] that person I didn't know I didn't know
[24:55] like God knew
[24:58] but God and see God just chose
[25:01] God just went
[25:03] this one this man of God will use
[25:06] tomorrow could be this little man of God
[25:09] this little man of God
[25:10] see because we're all man of God

[25:34] to watch sister Linda this morning
[25:36] remember Sister Linda Delgado heal her
[25:39] completely amen for the glory of God
[25:41] Amen however God chooses you know see we
[25:44] can have the greatest thing is to try
[25:47] not to have an agenda in our minds
[25:50] so I had an agenda brother Jr would
[25:52] preach
[25:53] and you know I I study every week I'd
[25:56] study Thursday you know and so then I
[25:59] thought well then I'm going to minister
[26:01] but see God was working maybe on a
[26:03] different end for the gym

[26:08] to whatever that does Amen so let's just

[34:44] and it was from the hip and I think the
[34:47] Lord is teaching me something brother
[34:48] Dale
[34:49] to rely not so much on my notes but rely
[34:53] on him
[34:54] you know that's that's what I'm getting
[34:56] from this
[34:58] amen so we'll see how it goes amen
[35:02] amen if this goes as good as when I
[35:04] preach it to myself you'll be you'll be
[35:07] blessed
[35:10] uh God you know brother bran says that
[35:13] God has a sense of humor
[35:15] doesn't he so I I look at it this way
[35:18] yeah I chuckle you know with you amen
[35:22] let's all stand
[35:26] first John
[35:31] I want to read some scriptures first
[35:33] John
[35:34] first uh first John first chapter
[35:37] verses five to seven
[35:46] and it goes like this then this this
[35:48] then is the message which we have heard
[35:51] of him and declare unto you that God is
[35:54] light
[35:55] and in him is no Darkness at all if we
[35:57] say that we have fellowship with him and
[35:59] walk in darkness we lie
[36:01] and we do not we and do not the truth
[36:05] but if we walk in the light that he is
[36:07] in the light we have Fellowship one way
[36:09] to another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[36:11] his son cleanses us from all sin the
[36:15] gospel go to the Gospel of John
[36:21] the 12th chapter
[36:29] and one verse 46.
[36:33] I am come a light into the world that
[36:35] whosoever believeth on me should not
[36:37] abide in darkness
[36:40] and if you go to John the same the same
[36:43] gospel John
[36:45] first chapter verse 4.
[36:51] in him was life
[36:53] and the light and the life was the light
[36:57] of men
[36:59] Lord had the blessing to the reading of
[37:01] his word bless the bow our heads for a
[37:03] moment if you will
[37:07] Heavenly Father
[37:09] oh Lord God we thank you Lord for your
[37:11] grace for your mercy
[37:14] Lord here we are assembled together Lord

[37:19] called to call the assembly
[37:22] the assembling of your your people Lord
[37:24] this morning Father
[37:26] Lord the call has gone forth and here
[37:28] the people has assembled themselves to
[37:30] hear from you Lord
[37:32] oh God may you just manifest yourself to
[37:35] them Lord by the word being spoken being
[37:38] preached Lord by your presence Lord

[37:42] Lord God remember each and every one oh
[37:44] Lord remember brother Jr or his family
[37:47] and Lord the Saints there all over the
[37:49] world you live bride father remember
[37:51] each and everyone we pray Jesus name we
[37:53] ask amen you may be seated
[38:03] I preached this
[38:06] sermon
[38:07] in Uganda
[38:09] Saturday morning
[38:13] and uh hey what's good
[38:16] it was good still good
[38:19] the word of God doesn't change
[38:22] you can you can read a scripture you can
[38:25] read a verse today
[38:26] and five years from now who knows how
[38:29] long you can still read it and get
[38:30] something out of it it's fresh it's
[38:32] always fresh
[38:33] it never goes stale
[38:35] Jesus says Heaven and Earth will pass
[38:38] away but my word will never pass away
[38:40] what a thing we can rely on
[38:44] is the word of God
[38:46] now if you look in the scripture now I'm
[38:48] going to be preaching on the light
[38:51] okay the light of God
[38:54] the light uh let's see one four in him
[38:58] was life and the life was the light of
[39:00] man now when we think about the light we
[39:03] look at that we say that's light or the
[39:05] sunshine
[39:07] but when you read the scripture
[39:09] where it says God is light
[39:13] okay that doesn't mean that he he's got
[39:16] a light bulb for you
[39:19] that's not what it means
[39:21] that means that the light is something
[39:23] when you turn the light in a dark room
[39:26] what does it do reveal what's in the
[39:28] room
[39:29] so so this here is the light of the
[39:33] world meaning he is the revelation of
[39:36] the world
[39:38] something that's revealed personally to
[39:41] you
[39:42] now it's not just the Revelation but the
[39:46] life that comes with it
[39:49] that's why he says here in him was life
[39:52] and the life was the light of men so
[39:56] everything all life comes from God
[40:00] okay all life comes from God
[40:02] nature itself
[40:05] shows you everything comes from God now
[40:08] there was another message that uh the
[40:11] the seed of God
[40:14] one thing about God is all life being
[40:17] come from God but everything has a
[40:19] beginning except God
[40:23] accept God God's always been and always
[40:26] will be no beginning no end but we have
[40:30] a beginning
[40:31] Nature has a beginning
[40:35] now where is that where where is the
[40:39] beginning where does that take us okay
[40:44] everything comes from a seed
[40:48] if you look at nature even us we started
[40:51] as a seed
[40:54] like when I was born I wasn't born like
[40:56] this no I was like very minute probably
[41:00] probably I don't know you might see it
[41:02] through a a microscope or something but
[41:06] everything and you look at nature it's
[41:07] the same thing
[41:09] everything comes from a seed and had
[41:12] there's the beginning of you and I
[41:15] and the world for that matter
[41:18] see when God spoke he said let there be
[41:22] did it happen like that no
[41:24] No it didn't
[41:26] but it started why how did it start when
[41:30] he spoke it
[41:31] it had to be
[41:34] Brothers says that every thought of God
[41:37] is a perfect thought he doesn't have a
[41:40] second thought like we do or a third
[41:41] thought
[41:43] so every thought is perfect so when he
[41:46] spoke it that's it now how long did it
[41:48] take they see you know the question
[41:50] about okay the Earth is millions or
[41:53] billions of years old okay and so they
[41:57] questioned the Bible how's that well
[41:59] brother Brian explained it in the
[42:01] beginning God created the heavens in the
[42:03] earth period how long did it did it take
[42:07] millions of years
[42:09] but once it's spoken it has to come to
[42:12] pass
[42:14] but it starts what the spoken word spoke
[42:17] it there it was but it started as a seed
[42:21] now I can only imagine the cree when
[42:24] he's there God is there and he speaks it
[42:26] and he has his thoughts everything that
[42:29] he wants to do you know I was thinking
[42:31] this morning how how did God think all
[42:36] these things
[42:37] you know and what did he see he saw the
[42:41] future saw the pastor saw the present
[42:44] Jesus said
[42:47] I do what my I see my father do
[42:50] like whatever he does that's what I do
[42:53] so he was led Jesus was led by vision
[42:58] now we don't have a vision we have the
[43:01] word
[43:03] see we have the word now we don't have
[43:05] but God saw everything like if I can say
[43:08] this way in a vision form
[43:11] he saw everything the whole Bible
[43:16] the whole Bible the word of God one time
[43:20] was in the thought of God
[43:24] so you take from Genesis to revelation
[43:26] God saw it all in Vision form
[43:30] I believe that
[43:33] so being that he saw in vision for him
[43:35] he says okay this is going to be and
[43:37] this you know and he could see
[43:38] everything transforming right before him
[43:41] in Vision form
[43:43] so he saw at the beginning he saw
[43:45] everything that would come step by step
[43:48] now one thing about God's word
[43:52] it doesn't stand still
[43:55] it moves
[44:00] we have to walk in the light and he is
[44:02] in the light
[44:04] and when that light moves we got to move
[44:06] with the light
[44:08] otherwise we're going to be left behind
[44:11] that's what's happened with
[44:12] denominations
[44:15] denominations what to happen is they
[44:18] receive part of the word part of the
[44:20] word and they stop right there
[44:23] they didn't want to move on but God
[44:24] moves on
[44:26] you see the statue of a perfect man down
[44:29] below its Faith well did God stop there
[44:31] no he moves up and up and up
[44:35] we have to move up and up and up in by
[44:37] Revelation with Revelation it takes us
[44:40] to a higher calling
[44:42] and that's the only way without
[44:44] Revelation you're lost
[44:46] because Brethren says faith faith is
[44:49] revelation and without faith impossible
[44:51] to please God so God Reveals His word to
[44:55] whomsoever he will
[44:58] now God moves God moves in his word
[45:02] and you see it in you see it where
[45:06] just you start where he was restoring
[45:09] his word back
[45:11] in its in in fullness
[45:14] and he did a true Luther Wesley and so
[45:16] on but here you look at justification
[45:21] when the word of God came to Luther he
[45:24] preached justification that's part of
[45:26] the word that's not the full word
[45:29] so God what happened is man took that
[45:32] and says okay we got the word so they
[45:36] stop what happened they died
[45:39] they died
[45:41] spiritually they died so God moves in
[45:45] his word now so justification made way
[45:48] for sanctification
[45:50] Wesley comes on the scene he preached
[45:52] sanctification God still moves on
[45:56] you have today you have denominations
[45:59] out there you have the lutherans and the
[46:01] and Pentecostal for that matter and
[46:03] everything what happened to them how
[46:06] come they're not walking in the light
[46:08] today because they stop moving
[46:12] you've got to move by Revelation you
[46:15] gotta when you read the word of God okay
[46:17] so you get something today what about
[46:19] tomorrow
[46:22] tomorrow has got to be greater than what
[46:24] you read today
[46:27] see God revealing his word to you to
[46:30] bring you up
[46:32] to a place revealing his word so that
[46:35] you can receive from him what he wants
[46:37] you to have
[46:40] in the days of Luther justification
[46:44] that's what God was giving to the to the
[46:48] people
[46:49] justification
[46:51] that's all they could take at the time
[46:54] now when God kept moving he came Wesley
[46:57] came on the scene
[46:59] and he preached sanctification so you
[47:02] don't do away with justification
[47:05] you take it with you
[47:08] it's always there
[47:10] it's always there the word doesn't
[47:13] change so you have just so if you come
[47:16] that way so you're Justified
[47:19] and then you come sanctification you're
[47:21] Sanctified now we don't do away with
[47:24] justification
[47:26] no no no no we it's like uh you know
[47:29] you're carrying your backpack if you
[47:31] want to look at it that way so you take
[47:33] it with you wherever you go
[47:35] so God moves
[47:38] now it came to Restoration of the gifts
[47:44] and when he did when he came to
[47:46] Restoration of the guess what what
[47:48] happened there the same thing that
[47:50] happened with the after Luther died and
[47:52] Wesley died they denominated they
[47:55] stopped right there they died
[47:57] did God stop there
[47:59] no
[48:01] no so where where are we going see
[48:06] if you think about it okay
[48:09] you heard Jesus says I come I come from
[48:12] God I go to God
[48:16] now that's quite a statement
[48:19] can we see that
[48:22] can we see that truthfully by Revelation
[48:25] can we say that I can't I come from God
[48:27] I go to God
[48:30] yes we can
[48:32] yes we can
[48:35] you see God see the word moving now he's
[48:38] moved now to justification
[48:40] sanctification restoration of the gifts
[48:43] but God didn't stop there
[48:45] brother Branham I don't have the quote
[48:47] here which I did but I don't have the
[48:49] quote where he says that God works
[48:51] through justification sanctification
[48:53] restoration of the gift
[48:55] the word
[48:57] the word that wasn't
[48:59] see without the word
[49:02] which is the full manifestation of the
[49:06] word
[49:06] justification sanctification restoration
[49:09] restoration of the gifts was not the
[49:12] full restoration
[49:14] God is restoring his word to its
[49:17] fullness
[49:18] so he's got to take you what the full
[49:21] word not part of it
[49:24] because when you stop you die
[49:28] God moves so where is he taking us
[49:31] to the full word full manifestation the
[49:34] manifestations of the sons of God he's
[49:37] taking us to a full manifestation
[49:41] see without justification certification
[49:43] resource share of the gift will not perf
[49:46] bring you us to perfection
[49:49] they won't
[49:51] so I asked to go what to the full
[49:53] manifestation of the word now when when
[49:56] I say that the full manifestation of the
[49:59] word is the fullness
[50:01] of God's power in demonstration
[50:07] here on Earth
[50:09] by his bride Brotherhood says the bride
[50:12] will have the word or she'll be quiet
[50:16] what did he mean the word we have the
[50:18] word but yeah no she don't have the
[50:21] fullness of the word or she'll be quiet
[50:25] so
[50:26] God's working through uh his word
[50:29] working through his bride and and
[50:33] we're a recipient
[50:35] being Children of the Living God were
[50:38] recipient of God's word because
[50:41] Brotherhood says he says the Bible was
[50:43] written for the believer
[50:46] for his children
[50:49] now we know there's three kinds of
[50:51] Believers in every Church
[50:55] we have
[50:58] a Believer the make-believer the
[50:59] unbeliever the unbeliever
[51:01] he'll come one service he's gone
[51:03] the make-believer can stick around for
[51:05] months or a few years even
[51:08] and what do you do well cause troubles
[51:11] but eventually
[51:13] he'll leave
[51:16] you see God the word of God the word of
[51:19] God separates we don't stand here in the
[51:22] pulpit
[51:24] and say
[51:25] you know you're you're not you're not
[51:27] you're you're with us but you're not of
[51:29] us as the scripture says so be gone no
[51:32] no we don't do that we just please we
[51:34] just lay the word out
[51:37] see Jesus never never fuss with the
[51:40] priests of his day
[51:42] what did he do he just spoke the word
[51:47] except you eat my flesh drink my blood
[51:49] you have no life that's it he says you
[51:51] know he was talking about a spiritual
[51:53] part not the flesh not the body it's
[51:56] fruit but they didn't understand so they
[51:58] thought well this is a hard saying who
[52:00] can receive it so they left
[52:03] see but all he did was lay the word
[52:05] there and it just they they scattered he
[52:09] left
[52:10] you know one thing about when you look
[52:11] at the scripture
[52:13] it says that many are called but few
[52:15] were chosen
[52:16] so many are called
[52:19] to the wedding supper
[52:22] I'll say that way
[52:23] many are called but the few are chosen
[52:26] now what happened we had Jesus had
[52:29] there's a parable there where Jesus
[52:31] spoke about there was this man uh I
[52:34] don't know exactly where it is but
[52:37] and he had land and he had you know
[52:40] money and everything else and he wanted
[52:42] to he wanted he wanted he had a feast
[52:44] and he want people to come and enjoy
[52:46] them
[52:46] and they all make excuses
[52:50] they all make excuses many are called
[52:54] so what he did was he says now he said
[52:57] my servants he says go into the highways
[52:59] and virus and compel the lame the blind
[53:02] the halt to come compel compel
[53:06] chose compel when Jesus came on the
[53:09] scene he says follow me follow me follow
[53:12] me compel compel
[53:14] see so many are called but few are
[53:17] chosen so those that are chosen are the
[53:20] ones
[53:21] they're not going to receive it
[53:25] Jesus said Jesus said he said
[53:28] be ye perfect that's my father is
[53:30] perfect
[53:33] now can you be perfect and just with but
[53:36] just justification sanctification
[53:38] baptism or the restoration of the guests
[53:40] no
[53:41] you can't be perfect you got to have the
[53:43] whole word you got all of it
[53:47] see to come to come as far as the guest
[53:49] and stop there in the Pentecostal church
[53:51] that's what happened brother and says
[53:53] they died when they denominated they
[53:54] stopped
[53:56] so we have to come to the fullness of
[53:58] the word now that's a you know you when
[54:01] you think about it the fullness of the
[54:03] word what's that
[54:05] well that's all the word but what
[54:07] exactly is it the fullness of the word
[54:11] Jesus when he was here on Earth
[54:14] he was a full manifestation
[54:17] of God
[54:20] the fullness of the godhead was in okay
[54:24] he was the full manifestation of God
[54:26] okay
[54:28] now Jesus is in spirit form
[54:32] now here he's in spirit in spirit form
[54:35] but he still wants to fulfill his word
[54:38] he wants that fullness of the mess we
[54:41] have to come to that place of perfection
[54:43] where the fullness of the manifestation
[54:46] of God Is In You and I
[54:51] and what what what the word will do that
[54:55] but we've got to go where the light is
[54:58] going step by step stay in the light
[55:00] stay in the light
[55:02] because that's where the life is and
[55:04] where where he leads
[55:07] I will follow
[55:10] amen so we so we have to stay in the
[55:14] light as he is in the light and we have
[55:16] fellowship with him in the blood of
[55:17] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin so
[55:20] it has it's a personal walk
[55:24] it's a personal walk now I'm leading I'm
[55:27] going somewhere it's okay I'm not just
[55:30] going throwing all I'm going somewhere
[55:32] it's okay stay with me all right
[55:35] now
[55:36] we've gone through justification
[55:38] sanctification restoration of the gift
[55:40] now we come to the word
[55:45] the manifestations of the sons of God
[55:50] is not it's a life lived
[55:53] the fullness manifestation of the word
[55:56] of God in the individual
[55:58] you are a son of God
[56:02] okay
[56:04] so you have in you
[56:07] power
[56:09] we have a new power
[56:12] to create worlds and to go and live on
[56:14] it if if it be the will of God verbum
[56:17] said that
[56:18] that it is in the Bride of Jesus Christ
[56:21] in the in in the children of God we have
[56:24] it now
[56:26] I don't have power
[56:27] this body doesn't have power but the one
[56:30] that's in US
[56:32] Jesus says he says all power is given to
[56:35] me vote in heaven and earth
[56:38] now if Jesus is in you then what's in
[56:41] you
[56:42] power
[56:45] he says he gives he gives uh if I can I
[56:49] don't know if I could yes but it's
[56:51] received him to then give he power to
[56:54] become sons of God even to them that
[56:56] believe on his name so he gave you power
[56:59] to become sons of God meaning
[57:02] you have in you
[57:05] you're the same your word is as good as
[57:08] God
[57:11] so where are where are we going
[57:16] okay where to think about it you know
[57:19] you we live we live our day we live
[57:22] every day we have things that we do and
[57:25] we go about our business and everything
[57:27] else but the way I see it now is that
[57:30] God is leading us to something greater
[57:33] than saying just saying oh I'm a
[57:36] Christian I go to church
[57:38] that's all good
[57:40] but where where is he where is God
[57:42] taking us remember the word moves
[57:46] so where is God taking us so he's taking
[57:49] us to a higher level now if you look at
[57:51] the Statue of a perfect man the right on
[57:53] top is love perfect love agape love
[57:55] that's God
[57:57] God himself
[57:59] okay
[58:00] it's not just saying it's the love of
[58:03] God and you know no it's God himself
[58:08] so let me say this
[58:10] God himself
[58:13] what's the Manifest his word
[58:16] through you in its fullness
[58:19] so what does that make you
[58:21] Sons and Daughters of God
[58:25] when we realize Who We Are
[58:30] when we come to the full revelation of
[58:33] who we are that we are sons of God
[58:36] Daughters of God
[58:38] we will say this is
[58:42] we will speak the word
[58:46] you know I was thinking this morning
[58:48] brother Dale when I was oh man it was
[58:50] good
[58:51] and uh
[58:54] we have to come to a place
[58:57] where we'll speak
[59:00] the word
[59:03] now right now right now
[59:05] if somebody is uh is say it's sick or
[59:08] something like that they come we pray we
[59:10] pray for them you got to speak it
[59:12] you just can't think it so we pray Lee
[59:15] hands Bible says
[59:18] correct okay
[59:19] and God is obligated to his word not to
[59:22] us but to his word so he'll do it
[59:25] he'll heal
[59:26] okay
[59:28] now we we it has to be spoken
[59:31] but I can see today where you as a Son
[59:35] of God a daughter of God you are not
[59:37] well you can speak to that
[59:42] speak to that say cancer
[59:45] and be gone
[59:47] that's it be gone
[59:49] okay
[59:51] that's the full manifestations of the
[59:53] sons of God we we have to the Bible says
[59:57] we will
[59:58] Nature's groaning for the manifestations
[1:00:01] of the sons of God where where where
[1:00:03] where where uh uh we will take our
[1:00:06] position on Earth and we'll speak it and
[1:00:10] it'll be done
[1:00:14] it'll be done
[1:00:16] now I you know you say you know Bible
[1:00:19] says ask not receive not so you got to
[1:00:22] speak it
[1:00:23] and I and I believe this that when we
[1:00:26] come to that place
[1:00:27] something will bother you all you'll
[1:00:30] have to do is speak it now I take it
[1:00:32] from the what the prophet said now I
[1:00:33] don't have my quotes here I wish I did
[1:00:35] but I don't but it's in the message Look
[1:00:37] Away to Jesus in 63. where he talks
[1:00:40] about the third pole
[1:00:42] now the third poll is not a mystery
[1:00:46] you know
[1:00:48] he had Brothers had the first poll
[1:00:50] second pole in his ministry and the
[1:00:52] third Pope but he says he in the third
[1:00:54] poll he talks about it here let me read
[1:00:56] something
[1:01:08] I did highlight I'm glad for a
[1:01:10] highlighter
[1:01:11] otherwise I would have my notes with me
[1:01:14] but
[1:01:15] uh my
[1:01:18] so hot you know it's like uh don't be
[1:01:21] satisfied with the status quo where
[1:01:23] you're at now
[1:01:24] because God has got
[1:01:26] Treasures beyond your imagination yet to
[1:01:30] come
[1:01:32] he says he says here
[1:01:36] and Look Away to Jesus in 63 he says now
[1:01:39] so now I am going to say something to
[1:01:41] you now that I haven't said all along
[1:01:45] and there it and that is the thing that
[1:01:47] we have looked forward for to for so
[1:01:49] long
[1:01:51] for at least many years four or five
[1:01:53] years or maybe longer the third pole
[1:01:55] has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you
[1:01:58] all know what it is
[1:02:00] now remember there never be an
[1:02:01] impersonation of that because it can't
[1:02:03] be see it cannot be now it's he says now
[1:02:06] it's in existence and I and I am warned
[1:02:09] of this that soon right at this time now
[1:02:11] it as it as it could and defies presence
[1:02:14] among you but it will not be used in a
[1:02:17] great way until the council uh begins to
[1:02:20] tighten up and what it does when that
[1:02:22] does the Pentecostal Fork can almost
[1:02:24] impersonate anything they can
[1:02:28] but when that time comes when the
[1:02:29] squeeze comes down then you'll see what
[1:02:31] what you've seen temporarily the
[1:02:33] manifested in the form of of his power
[1:02:35] now if you remember the the third poll
[1:02:39] he talks about it in here in the message
[1:02:41] here he talks about sister Addie says
[1:02:44] the storm uh the squirrels he he doesn't
[1:02:47] mention the fish but the fish was that
[1:02:49] had to do with it and and uh his wife
[1:02:55] now one thing that struck me when I was
[1:02:57] reading this
[1:02:59] is that he didn't ask
[1:03:02] he didn't say in the name of Jesus
[1:03:05] no no he just said it because God told
[1:03:07] him
[1:03:08] say it
[1:03:09] now he says what what you what you see
[1:03:12] temporarily you'll see in his fullness
[1:03:14] when the squeeze come
[1:03:15] when the pressure comes
[1:03:18] now here he says uh
[1:03:26] let me read a little bit here
[1:03:29] well one thing he says he says this this
[1:03:31] will be the thing that is to my opinion
[1:03:34] I don't say the Lord tells me this
[1:03:36] this will be the thing that will start
[1:03:38] the rapturing Fate for the going away
[1:03:40] see
[1:03:42] he says it's tightening and when that
[1:03:44] time comes and when she when the Press
[1:03:46] comes to a place to wear your Presto
[1:03:48] then watch what I'm fixing to tell you
[1:03:50] in a few minutes watch the third pole
[1:03:52] then
[1:03:53] it'll be absolutely to the total loss
[1:03:55] but it will be for the bride and the
[1:03:57] church
[1:03:58] now
[1:04:03] we can argue the point
[1:04:05] or we can believe it or not believe it
[1:04:11] but if Prophet has spoken it
[1:04:14] foreign
[1:04:17] and if we believe that it came from God
[1:04:20] then it has to come to pass
[1:04:23] now the third when it comes to the third
[1:04:26] poll he doesn't talk too much about it
[1:04:27] because the angel warned him don't say
[1:04:30] nothing about it
[1:04:32] so we don't say nothing we don't it's
[1:04:34] the same with us
[1:04:36] we don't say very much about it we just
[1:04:38] leave it alone God will bring it to pass
[1:04:40] what was it it was a manifestation of
[1:04:44] the sons of God brother brought him he
[1:04:47] came to a point he said I am not the son
[1:04:49] of Charles and edible
[1:04:51] I am a son of God
[1:04:53] now who told them
[1:04:56] who told him he's the son of God
[1:04:58] God told them
[1:05:03] I had something I'll share with you this
[1:05:06] okay there was a prophecy in our church
[1:05:08] in in Wellsburg
[1:05:10] and I was doing I was song leading at
[1:05:12] the time
[1:05:13] and I remember it was during the song
[1:05:15] service
[1:05:17] and I'm trying to remember the name
[1:05:20] there was a sister in the church she
[1:05:22] prophesied
[1:05:25] uh Judith Judith Downs
[1:05:28] she prophesied and what she said was the
[1:05:31] truth
[1:05:33] she said and and I was standing up I was
[1:05:36] leading the in in the worship service
[1:05:39] and she said
[1:05:42] she didn't know what was going on what
[1:05:44] the devil how the devil was attacking me
[1:05:45] but she but she said she no this is or
[1:05:49] words
[1:05:50] Satan he's not your son he's my son
[1:05:55] and she said
[1:05:57] your son
[1:05:59] no it wasn't her it was God God said
[1:06:02] your son that is not your son I will
[1:06:04] save
[1:06:06] and she said other things besides that
[1:06:08] okay now that see at that time God this
[1:06:13] the devil was on my tail on my back
[1:06:16] trying to get me to think that had his
[1:06:19] son not God's son
[1:06:22] she didn't see God spoke now son that is
[1:06:25] not your son that's my oldest son
[1:06:29] he's not mine he's my wife's
[1:06:31] but he's not mine
[1:06:33] so it was true and so what it is what
[1:06:36] I'm trying to say is this when we come
[1:06:39] to a full and it has to be by Revelation
[1:06:43] when we come to the full revelation of
[1:06:45] Who We Are
[1:06:47] we will speak it
[1:06:49] we will say it
[1:06:52] I believe before the change of the body
[1:06:56] because that's when we that's when we
[1:06:58] need it
[1:06:59] this happened what the third poll what
[1:07:01] Brethren talked about in that message
[1:07:03] Look Away to Jesus
[1:07:05] it happened here
[1:07:09] see before his debt had happened here on
[1:07:12] Earth the fish the squirrels sister
[1:07:15] Addie the storm his wife all had a
[1:07:19] significance
[1:07:21] in that it it displays the attributes of
[1:07:24] God healing savior controlling nature
[1:07:27] Resurrection
[1:07:32] so all those things are gonna they have
[1:07:34] to come to pass
[1:07:37] and one day one day
[1:07:39] one day the day will come when you have
[1:07:43] such a revelation will hit you
[1:07:45] and you'll say my it's like you know
[1:07:50] brother Brown had those experiences
[1:07:52] where God would come in the room like he
[1:07:55] talks about it it will just take him
[1:07:57] from you know throw him across the room
[1:07:59] but such a powerful Revelation I had an
[1:08:02] experience that and years ago
[1:08:06] in in the church in Chatham
[1:08:08] and I've never experienced anything
[1:08:09] before or after like that it's presence
[1:08:14] where he spoke to me and I shared with
[1:08:15] the church already
[1:08:17] so but if in case you you don't remember
[1:08:20] anyway I was sitting in the back it was
[1:08:22] the end of the service brother draws at
[1:08:24] just dismissed the people he was walking
[1:08:26] away and the presence came on me like I
[1:08:29] never felt before I could not move I
[1:08:32] could not think
[1:08:33] uh it was a humbling experience I could
[1:08:36] not jump I could not do anything
[1:08:39] and the Lord spoke to me
[1:08:41] to sanctify yourself if there's a word
[1:08:43] for you to do later I've never felt and
[1:08:46] I've felt many times the the the
[1:08:49] anointing as a song leader I felt many
[1:08:52] times but that anointing was totally
[1:08:54] different totally totally different so
[1:08:56] yeah but Brothers had those experience
[1:08:58] but the thing is what I'm trying to say
[1:09:00] is
[1:09:01] we have to
[1:09:03] keep that connection I'll say this way
[1:09:05] we've got to keep that connection with
[1:09:07] God
[1:09:08] because one day one day
[1:09:11] that word the full month the
[1:09:13] manifestations of the sons of God it has
[1:09:15] to come to pass
[1:09:17] it's his word
[1:09:20] as long as we stay in the light as he is
[1:09:23] in the light we walk with him day by day
[1:09:26] by day by day by day
[1:09:29] that's where that's where life is
[1:09:31] without the Sun
[1:09:33] the natural Sun there'd be no life
[1:09:36] that's a natural what about the
[1:09:38] spiritual
[1:09:39] without the Son of God the spiritual
[1:09:42] there'd be no life
[1:09:44] there's a lot of
[1:09:46] if I can say this way there's a lot of
[1:09:48] dead people walking around
[1:09:51] they don't know it
[1:09:54] but but see the gospel has come to you
[1:09:57] and I
[1:09:59] we have received it we have it it's ours
[1:10:03] it's yours
[1:10:05] this word of God
[1:10:07] this word it's yours it's yours
[1:10:12] what do you do what are you going to do
[1:10:14] with it
[1:10:17] what are you going to do with the word
[1:10:21] you say well I'll believe it but yet
[1:10:24] that's a good start
[1:10:26] act upon it
[1:10:28] you've heard you've heard the pre you've
[1:10:31] heard it preached and brother Brent says
[1:10:33] you got to see yourself healed
[1:10:36] in your mind
[1:10:37] you ask for healing you act upon it
[1:10:41] the word of God the word says that you
[1:10:43] are a son of God act upon it
[1:10:46] we're so afraid
[1:10:48] that it won't happen
[1:10:52] we are
[1:10:54] I I know I know like you know he has a
[1:10:58] need see my young little brother he has
[1:11:00] an e okay and I'm afraid to I'll go and
[1:11:03] lay hands and say oh Lord you know in
[1:11:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:08] what would stop me from saying that
[1:11:11] not thus say the Lord
[1:11:13] the word of God says
[1:11:16] receive it it's done
[1:11:20] it's done
[1:11:24] foreign
[1:11:26] God spoke it
[1:11:29] he created the world by the spoken word
[1:11:32] we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:11:35] we have the authority to use the power
[1:11:39] that lives in us to speak it
[1:11:44] and I believe with all my heart I
[1:11:46] believe that one day we'll see that
[1:11:48] we'll see that manifestation
[1:11:51] there'll be you will you'll feel that
[1:11:54] little headache come on you or something
[1:11:55] like that and you'll say God's word says
[1:11:57] and and headache leave
[1:12:00] that's it
[1:12:03] protobram talked about there will come a
[1:12:05] time where diseases on the Earth
[1:12:07] they'll come to Jesus on the Earth but
[1:12:09] it will never touch you
[1:12:12] won't touch you
[1:12:15] any all those that have the spirit of
[1:12:17] God born again he said it will not
[1:12:19] affect you
[1:12:22] he said it
[1:12:24] that day is coming
[1:12:27] that Day's coming
[1:12:29] so what have we got to look forward to
[1:12:32] be you know Jesus says again Jesus says
[1:12:36] Be Your perfectness my father is perfect
[1:12:39] he is perfect in every way now mind you
[1:12:43] we're in this flesh
[1:12:45] mind you wouldn't miss flesh but he says
[1:12:47] be ye perfect as my father is perfect
[1:12:49] what He was Jesus walking on Earth
[1:12:53] fullness of the godhead
[1:12:55] now he's in his bride many member bride
[1:12:58] but the power program says a spoonful of
[1:13:01] the ocean is all you need
[1:13:04] you got the ocean
[1:13:05] so if I have don't know if I have the
[1:13:08] ocean and a spoonful that means I have
[1:13:10] the full word
[1:13:12] that has others I have access access to
[1:13:15] the full word
[1:13:17] so what are my needs
[1:13:21] am I sick I have access to the full word
[1:13:25] so if I have access to the full word he
[1:13:27] says by your stripes I'm Healed that's
[1:13:29] mine
[1:13:30] that's mine
[1:13:32] my God shall supply all my knees
[1:13:34] according to his riches and Glory that's
[1:13:36] mine
[1:13:38] that is yours
[1:13:40] every word of God is yours
[1:13:42] all you have to do is act upon it it's
[1:13:45] mine it's mine receive it
[1:13:48] take it
[1:13:50] see it's a personal walk it's you and
[1:13:54] Jesus it's you and the Holy Spirit
[1:13:56] walking
[1:13:57] living
[1:13:59] do you feel like it do you feel it no
[1:14:03] it's not a Feeling
[1:14:06] it's not a feeling if God revealing
[1:14:09] himself to you in his fullness that's it
[1:14:11] personally
[1:14:14] so he wants to bring you to a level you
[1:14:19] walk with him as he is in the light he
[1:14:21] wants to take you by Revelation to a
[1:14:24] place
[1:14:25] where God has seen you before the the
[1:14:28] foundation of the world he's seen you in
[1:14:30] their perfection
[1:14:35] and God has seen you
[1:14:38] in a vision maybe let's say before the
[1:14:41] foundation of the world before he
[1:14:42] created anything he's seen you in
[1:14:44] Perfection so guess what
[1:14:47] you're going to be perfect one day
[1:14:49] whether you like it or not
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:55] because God has chosen you Jesus says to
[1:14:59] the disciples you didn't choose me I
[1:15:01] chose you
[1:15:06] amen amen
[1:15:10] oh my
[1:15:13] so don't be satisfied with the status
[1:15:15] quo
[1:15:17] where you're at
[1:15:19] Press On
[1:15:24] God is moving
[1:15:27] in his word and he's taking his bride
[1:15:30] along with it
[1:15:32] to a higher plane
[1:15:33] to a higher level
[1:15:35] don't be satisfied
[1:15:37] with the way it is
[1:15:41] keep looking up keep and and follow as
[1:15:44] the light is moving you move with the
[1:15:46] light so that's what revelation
[1:15:49] every day is a little bit here a little
[1:15:51] bit there weird upon word line upon line
[1:15:54] a little bit bite a little bit at a time
[1:15:59] my wife
[1:16:02] the Lord told me
[1:16:04] or
[1:16:05] she started getting better
[1:16:07] because he was at one point she was she
[1:16:09] wasn't moving she wasn't talking hardly
[1:16:12] eating anything you get three Spoonful
[1:16:15] down you're lucky that's where she was
[1:16:18] she lost she had lost quite a bit of
[1:16:19] weight and the Lord told me says I will
[1:16:23] heal her a little at a time
[1:16:26] that's what healing is a little at a
[1:16:28] time how long it's going to take
[1:16:31] Abraham had to wait what 25 years for
[1:16:34] the promised son
[1:16:35] well I don't think I will have to wait
[1:16:37] 25 years but since then the Lord told me
[1:16:41] this she has progressed better and
[1:16:43] better and better and you know some of
[1:16:45] you are witnesses to it
[1:16:49] so God's word will come to pass
[1:16:55] and guess what
[1:16:56] if that word is in you
[1:16:59] then you will come to pass
[1:17:06] you have no choice
[1:17:09] you have no choice you didn't choose
[1:17:11] this gospel you didn't choose God God
[1:17:13] chose you
[1:17:17] because if we try to choose well let's
[1:17:20] face it if we try to choose God we'd run
[1:17:22] away from him
[1:17:25] we did I did for years until you came on
[1:17:28] the scene and
[1:17:29] you let me know you know
[1:17:32] praise the Lord
[1:17:35] so the word the word
[1:17:37] as I said you know just here I'm going
[1:17:41] to finish probably with this it has to
[1:17:43] be spoken but it starts from a seed
[1:17:48] and then when you go in the Bible you
[1:17:49] look at it where God created the heavens
[1:17:52] he already created everything 6 000
[1:17:54] years there one thought you know every
[1:17:56] every thousand years he created a
[1:17:58] different thing but it had he spoke it
[1:18:00] now did it happen no it didn't happen
[1:18:01] right away but it happened
[1:18:04] it did come to pass
[1:18:07] so
[1:18:09] you think about it when things that the
[1:18:12] prophet said that's yet to come
[1:18:14] don't look at the world don't look at
[1:18:17] things out there what's going on
[1:18:19] no no no no
[1:18:21] God is
[1:18:22] that doesn't bother God
[1:18:25] so it shouldn't bother us
[1:18:29] you shouldn't bother us
[1:18:31] the things that are happening out there
[1:18:32] in the world
[1:18:33] in the natural the wars and all this
[1:18:36] don't don't let it shake Jesus says
[1:18:38] you'll hear of Wars rumors and Wars but
[1:18:40] the end is not yet
[1:18:42] that's not a sign in other words that's
[1:18:44] not a sign that it's the end
[1:18:47] that's not a sign so they'll look at
[1:18:50] those things
[1:18:51] no no keep your eyes on
[1:18:53] the promises of God's word keep your
[1:18:56] eyes on that
[1:18:58] amen it's like you meditate you meditate
[1:19:01] on what the the the the positive you you
[1:19:04] want to what's positive you want to
[1:19:06] meditate on the word outside of that
[1:19:09] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:19:12] word will not pass away
[1:19:14] so that's your that's your uh your
[1:19:17] anchor
[1:19:18] that's your ankle amen
[1:19:21] praise the lord well that's all I got to
[1:19:24] say
[1:19:26] praise the Lord I don't have my nose but
[1:19:28] hopefully the Lord Lord will bless you
[1:19:30] amen praise God let's all stand
[1:19:41] one thing about God's word
[1:19:45] maybe our last thought he doesn't ask
[1:19:47] you what you think
[1:19:50] God doesn't ask you what you think
[1:19:53] no he doesn't ask you he tells you
[1:19:56] what you should think
[1:19:59] yeah he does that's why he's trying to
[1:20:02] tell you there's something coming
[1:20:04] because the word I said it has to come
[1:20:07] to pass manifestation is the sons of God
[1:20:09] has to come to pass and you are part of
[1:20:12] it then guess what there's more coming
[1:20:16] more blessings
[1:20:18] come a time we'll have the change in the
[1:20:20] body otherwise if we go in the grave of
[1:20:22] course he often is waiting for us
[1:20:24] otherwise a chain will have there'll be
[1:20:27] Resurrection those that remain will be
[1:20:30] caught up with them to meet the Lord in
[1:20:31] the air
[1:20:34] it just it just it kind of boggles my
[1:20:37] mind because God has not given us a full
[1:20:40] revelation of just that the body chain
[1:20:42] he hasn't because if you did you you'd
[1:20:45] be gone
[1:20:47] you won't stay here you disappear be
[1:20:50] gone that's it
[1:20:51] oh yeah so we don't we haven't received
[1:20:54] it yet so we haven't attained that that
[1:20:57] top there the love we haven't got that
[1:21:00] far the Holy Spirit yes brother and
[1:21:02] kindness yes
[1:21:04] but we haven't come to that point
[1:21:06] but we're get we're going there so don't
[1:21:09] stop
[1:21:12] well Don't Stop Believing
[1:21:14] but see Faith come what bye by the word
[1:21:19] hearing by the word of God
[1:21:21] so faith is what keeps us going

[1:26:32] as sitting still

[1:26:37] my mind was just as brother Jim was
[1:26:39] wrote that where the where the Prophet
[1:26:41] said that we had to take the authority
[1:26:43] that he's given to us it's time to take
[1:26:45] the authority and speak it and go
[1:26:47] forward
[1:26:48] speak it and go forward you don't have
[1:26:51] to pray about if it's God's will for
[1:26:53] healing God already give it to you it's
[1:26:55] pain in full
[1:26:57] it's so easy for us to believe in our
[1:26:59] salvation but we don't think God could
[1:27:01] heal us he could save us but he probably
[1:27:04] couldn't heal my knee
[1:27:06] my that's that was just beautiful amen
[1:27:10] next Sunday we want to look into people
[1:27:13] that refuse to move forward
[1:27:16] and people that did
[1:27:18] you're either getting better or worse
