[10:09] [Music]
[10:15] God bless you
[10:19] um and thinking about this weekend this
[10:20] song was on my mind
[10:23] um I was intending to sing it yesterday
[10:25] but I'm glad that it ended up happening
[10:28] today because it feels more real
[10:30] um
[10:32] it's a song we all know and it's a
[10:35] testimony song
[10:37] so
[10:43] [Music]
[10:44] my heart was distressed neither
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] and low in the pit where my sin dragged
[10:56] me down I cried to the Lord from the
[11:02] deep my reclae who brought me from him
[11:07] into golden day he placed me apart the
[11:15] Strong Rock by his eye
[11:23] Amazing Grace
[11:27] oh I'll stand by his grace unto a crown
[11:35] I gave
[11:51] you may be seen it
[11:55] oh praise the Lord
[11:58] it's been a blessing this weekend
[12:01] I don't know if I've been
[12:04] better blessed than this weekend
[12:08] praise the Lord just a short
[12:16] and as for me I'm fine
[12:20] I'm fine
[12:22] the surgeon I saw him three about three
[12:25] days ago for stress tests and he was
[12:27] amazed the progress I made in a short
[12:31] time
[12:32] and I I told him I said well it's
[12:34] because of prayers a lot of people are
[12:36] praying so praise the Lord
[12:39] [Applause]
[12:44] there's a song I want to sing and you're
[12:47] going to help me okay you're going to
[12:49] help me God is good
[12:54] well
[12:55] you know I was thinking of that and I
[12:57] was thinking you know God is good and
[12:59] the Bible says God is good
[13:01] the Bible says God is good
[13:04] but how do we know that God is good
[13:06] think about it how do we know that God
[13:10] is good
[13:11] I mean Satan knows the word better than
[13:13] we do
[13:14] he knows
[13:16] God's good
[13:18] but he doesn't know like we know God is
[13:20] good
[13:21] so how do we know that God is good
[13:25] how do you know if you have somebody
[13:28] that's close to you so that's a good
[13:30] person
[13:31] unless you have a personal experience
[13:34] with that person
[13:36] so that's what we need to do
[13:38] to have a personal experience with God
[13:42] then you'll know that God is good
[13:45] that's the only way you're going to know
[13:46] him
[13:48] in New Birth amen
[13:50] amen Born Again amen
[13:54] I'm going to start the song a little
[13:55] different sister

[1:05:23] getting us all in the same mind
[1:05:26] even if you're on the straight and
[1:05:28] narrow you're on the level your bubble's
[1:05:30] on the level you know what I'm talking
[1:05:31] about even then you're talking about
[1:05:33] miraculous what God's going to do for us
[1:05:35] amen Philippians 2 verse 1.
[1:05:38] Apostle Paul speaking if there be any
[1:05:41] consolation in Christ
[1:05:43] if any comfort of love if any Fellowship
[1:05:45] of the spirit if any bowels and Mercies
[1:05:49] fulfill ye my joy that you be
[1:05:53] like-minded
[1:05:55] having the Same Love
[1:05:58] being of one Accord and of one mind he
[1:06:03] said brother Ben is it going to happen
[1:06:04] God said so
[1:06:06] and if he put this in his word I am
[1:06:09] confident he can bring us to that place
[1:06:12] I believe that with all of my heart I
[1:06:13] believe that do I understand all of it
[1:06:15] and how it's going to work absolutely
[1:06:16] not I wouldn't even be silly enough to
[1:06:19] try to conjecture how it's going to
[1:06:22] happen but God said it'll be there and
[1:06:23] brother Gordon if you said it it's going
[1:06:24] to happen just the way he put it in
[1:06:26] there amen I believe that let nothing be
[1:06:29] done through Strife or vainglory but in
[1:06:33] say this with me lowliness of mine you
[1:06:36] remember last night now the message is
[1:06:38] surrender this is the aspect that we
[1:06:40] need that part of our life to get to
[1:06:42] these places we're talking about Let
[1:06:44] each esteem other better than themselves
[1:06:49] look not every man on his own things but
[1:06:53] every man also on the things of others
[1:06:56] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:07:00] in Christ Jesus now I want to read to

[1:07:22] father in The Gospel not father as it
[1:07:24] would be a priest he says but I'm your
[1:07:26] father in The Gospel as Paul said there
[1:07:29] I have begotten you to Christ and now I
[1:07:32] have espoused you to Christ that's
[1:07:35] engaged you to Christ as a chaste virgin
[1:07:38] now listen to this two times he says
[1:07:41] Don't Let Me Down
[1:07:44] don't let me down
[1:07:47] let's pray over the word
[1:07:49] father we counted a privilege Lord to be
[1:07:51] in your presence
[1:07:53] and father we are so grateful today
[1:07:56] for the Holy Ghost to come into this
[1:07:58] place like you've come this morning with
[1:08:00] all the worship and the prayers and the
[1:08:03] things going up every part of the
[1:08:05] service perfectly in order just as you
[1:08:07] would have it now Lord comes the sincere
[1:08:09] and the most important and sacred part
[1:08:12] of any Gathering or assembly like this
[1:08:14] and that's the preaching of the Gospel
[1:08:16] Lord you never put us in a spot of time
[1:08:20] we're not denominational minded where we
[1:08:23] just take a few minutes and amen and run
[1:08:25] everybody out the door and we've done
[1:08:26] our religion but Lord we come in here to
[1:08:28] settle in and hear from you Lord if it
[1:08:31] takes 40 minutes or 40 hours or 40 days
[1:08:33] and nights we want to hear from you Lord
[1:08:35] Jesus that is our anticipation and Lord
[1:08:39] with this Gathering of people why would
[1:08:41] any man bring a gathering in like this
[1:08:42] and not expect the Holy Spirit to speak
[1:08:44] to him Lord why would anybody come and
[1:08:47] assemble like this without that
[1:08:49] expectation in their heart Lord we don't
[1:08:51] come because it's protractive we come
[1:08:53] because that burning desire in us to
[1:08:55] hear from you that's why we assemble
[1:08:57] father we thank you Lord for that desire
[1:09:00] and that dedication burning in the heart
[1:09:02] of each one we pray that you'll honor
[1:09:04] that today Lord and you'll see that deep
[1:09:06] in their calling to the deep and speak
[1:09:08] to us through Thy word I submit and
[1:09:10] surrender myself to you I Surrender this
[1:09:13] audience to you may the Holy Spirit put
[1:09:16] stops to any kind of interruption or
[1:09:19] thing that Satan might try to put
[1:09:20] whether it be in our mind or some other
[1:09:23] kind of thing May the Holy Ghost take
[1:09:25] preeminence over this service today may
[1:09:27] you speak to us in every single way God
[1:09:29] as we yield our bodies mind Spirit Soul
[1:09:33] all of us to you in the name of Jesus
[1:09:36] Christ we pray and the Saints said amen
[1:09:39] you may be seated may the Lord bless you
[1:09:41] really good amen appreciate your
[1:09:43] patience and with all that singing and
[1:09:45] everything amen we're already up here to
[1:09:48] a little bit after 11 o'clock but amen I
[1:09:51] I somebody said you preached two hours
[1:09:53] and I said yeah but I sang 30 of it
[1:09:56] Hallelujah but but anyways we we
[1:09:59] appreciate the Lord and I I want if God
[1:10:02] will help me and I'm kind of dovetailing
[1:10:04] a little bit with some of the thoughts
[1:10:05] we had uh last night in terms of the
[1:10:09] um the unity of the spirit something the
[1:10:12] Holy Spirit led me to say last night
[1:10:14] that I I enjoyed hearing it and I hadn't
[1:10:19] really thought of it too deeply until we
[1:10:21] got into this uh last night but this
[1:10:24] little statement that was made about the
[1:10:25] young people last night and how that we
[1:10:28] need to encourage I got to thinking
[1:10:30] about the encouragement of young people
[1:10:32] and I thought about myself you know when
[1:10:34] I started preaching I was 14 years old
[1:10:36] and I went many many years without a
[1:10:39] mentor of any kind nobody ever took me
[1:10:41] under their arm and said hey do it this
[1:10:42] way or say that I I learned through just
[1:10:45] blab it and grab it open my mouth say
[1:10:47] something stupid that next time and uh
[1:10:49] and then to say something that worked
[1:10:51] they remember that one put that one down
[1:10:52] in the book and uh the Lord you
[1:10:55] genuinely taught me how to be the right
[1:10:57] kind of Christian but I thought back on
[1:11:00] my life of how many years I suffered not
[1:11:03] having someone to take me by the hand
[1:11:06] and talk to me and explain things to me
[1:11:08] and and and I wonder in the light of the
[1:11:11] message we're going to try to talk about
[1:11:12] today I want to revisit just that idea a
[1:11:15] little bit because when I look at what
[1:11:17] brother Branham said about the cloud
[1:11:19] coming you remember when the prophecy
[1:11:21] the clown the one thing that he made the
[1:11:24] statement about uh in prayer he said now
[1:11:27] Lord you see about the revelation of
[1:11:29] that cloud and how the Holy Spirit was
[1:11:30] going to come and reveal he said and
[1:11:32] especially you young people he said
[1:11:35] about the young people and you know I've
[1:11:37] never really considered myself much of a
[1:11:39] young people's preacher because I've
[1:11:41] always been one of the young people
[1:11:42] myself but I know that as age kind of
[1:11:47] goes on in time I know that age is going
[1:11:49] to take care of that young person thing
[1:11:50] after a while anyways but looking back
[1:11:53] now on my 20s and my teenage years and
[1:11:56] things like that I realized that a lot
[1:11:59] of the hardships that I went through as
[1:12:01] a beginning believer and starting out
[1:12:03] some of it was absolutely unnecessary
[1:12:05] because there were people sitting in the
[1:12:08] pews that had age and experience that
[1:12:10] could have reached out to me and give me
[1:12:12] a little nugget every now and then now I
[1:12:14] don't mean metal in your life and
[1:12:15] micromanage your life and dictate to you
[1:12:18] what you ought to do and not do but just
[1:12:20] words of wisdom from time to time and I
[1:12:23] think that it behooves us in a gathering
[1:12:25] like this to set our affection upon what
[1:12:28] we need to do as the other stage of Life
[1:12:31] coming on the other side of life and
[1:12:33] maybe you're thinking well there ain't
[1:12:35] nothing that I can do for God I can't
[1:12:37] preach I don't pastor church I'm not
[1:12:38] really a musician or singer or anything
[1:12:40] like that yes but if you are carrying in
[1:12:43] your head the hoary head of wisdom today
[1:12:45] you have life stepping stones that you
[1:12:49] can share and show other people around
[1:12:51] you younger how to avoid the pitfalls of
[1:12:55] life I believe the Bible tells us let
[1:12:57] the Elder women teach the younger ones
[1:12:59] and us as young people and treat the
[1:13:02] Elder as fathers and regard them as
[1:13:04] brothers and so forth now if we're ever
[1:13:06] going to come to the place to where we
[1:13:08] as the believing people of God I want
[1:13:11] you to listen close to this if we ever
[1:13:13] come to the places the believing people
[1:13:15] of God that we can come in the harmony
[1:13:17] of the spirit we're going to have to
[1:13:19] remember that the body of Christ ain't
[1:13:21] made up of just old people that walk
[1:13:23] with brother Branham but it's made up of
[1:13:25] the young ones just the same as it is
[1:13:27] the middle age or whatever stage of Life
[1:13:29] they're in it's made up of males it's
[1:13:31] made up of females and we are the the
[1:13:33] body of Christ and members in particular
[1:13:36] so it behooves us as the people of God
[1:13:38] to consider that every single part of
[1:13:42] the body of Christ is important and even
[1:13:45] in society we look at the elderly
[1:13:47] brother Jose sometimes people throw them
[1:13:49] off into society they're useless and
[1:13:51] they don't have any uh way of it and
[1:13:53] then young people are treated the exact
[1:13:54] same way well you're wet behind the ears
[1:13:57] and you don't know nothing don't you
[1:13:58] think that that's kind of a wrong
[1:14:00] statement to put before a child or
[1:14:02] before a teenager or someone they can't
[1:14:05] help it that they don't have the
[1:14:06] experiences they can't help it that
[1:14:08] they're 15 or 19 or 25. amen they are
[1:14:12] walking exactly as God has separated
[1:14:15] them from their mother's womb and give
[1:14:17] them birth in this life whatever stage
[1:14:20] they're in that's where they are but for
[1:14:22] us to be the right kind of people we
[1:14:24] ought to be able to share our
[1:14:26] experiences our testimonies and share
[1:14:28] with each other the things that we know
[1:14:30] in this life I mean if you see young
[1:14:33] girls or doing things maybe that ain't
[1:14:35] all that pleasing to the Lord it always
[1:14:37] baffles my mind why people got to be
[1:14:40] critical why is that the default way of
[1:14:43] trying to help somebody along why not
[1:14:45] come to them with the sweetness of an
[1:14:48] aged person or somebody that's been down
[1:14:49] that road and say now listen this is not
[1:14:52] critical but you know you would look
[1:14:54] nice if you've done this or it would
[1:14:55] sound better if you said that and let me
[1:14:57] tell you a story about so and so but
[1:15:00] many times we approach it with a
[1:15:02] critical ear a critical heart a critical
[1:15:04] mind ready to correct ready to put
[1:15:07] somebody in their place friends do you
[1:15:09] realize the Bible does not give us
[1:15:12] permission to nitpick and micromanage
[1:15:15] and nag each other amen the Bible said
[1:15:18] the only time that you are to go to
[1:15:21] somebody in situations is when you see
[1:15:23] that person overtaken in a fall go back
[1:15:27] and read in the book of Galatians amen
[1:15:29] if your brother offends you rebuking
[1:15:30] between you and him Amen in other words
[1:15:32] talk to him about it tell him how you
[1:15:35] felt about it amen but don't go to
[1:15:37] everybody's doorstep and try to clean up
[1:15:39] their doorsteps amen don't go to
[1:15:41] everybody's house and start looking
[1:15:43] through the cupboards and everywhere to
[1:15:44] see if a television is hiding somewhere
[1:15:46] amen you sweep your steps I'll sweep
[1:15:49] mine and we'll serve God in the newness
[1:15:52] of Life come on somebody say Amen
[1:15:54] amen I know that sounds hard and I
[1:15:56] cannot tell you right away that that's
[1:15:58] one of the hardest things to do is to
[1:16:01] Simply mind your own business
[1:16:04] here we go again brother Jim I'm already
[1:16:06] back in the mode again but you're just
[1:16:09] gonna have to hang with me because this
[1:16:10] is where we had amen it's it's hard for
[1:16:13] us to have that kind of attitude but
[1:16:15] listen minding your own business doesn't
[1:16:17] mean that you you ignore your brother
[1:16:19] ignore your sister but as Paul said here
[1:16:22] be mindful of the things that each other
[1:16:24] is going through you see somebody not
[1:16:26] coming to church for a couple weeks amen
[1:16:28] what's wrong with sending them a text
[1:16:30] message or giving them a phone call or
[1:16:32] putting a card in the mail thinking of
[1:16:34] you just wants you to know that you're
[1:16:36] loved amen I was in a meeting some time
[1:16:38] ago and there was a certain individual
[1:16:40] that was teeter-tottering on suicide
[1:16:43] very very mentally oppressed type person
[1:16:45] had just all kinds of mental battles all
[1:16:47] the time and they confessed to me that
[1:16:50] they was on the verge of putting a gun
[1:16:52] in their mouth amen until one day a text
[1:16:54] message come and somebody said just
[1:16:56] wanted you to know while they're holding
[1:16:58] the gun that you're loved you're not
[1:17:00] alone and Jesus loves you and I love you
[1:17:02] too amen I don't care what anybody says
[1:17:05] A Little Bit of Love Will grind over any
[1:17:08] old sore any old bitterness it will
[1:17:10] bring healing to the body amen if we
[1:17:12] show concerned amen not criticism
[1:17:15] concern
[1:17:17] amen we've been too critical that way
[1:17:19] amen I've lost count of the legalists
[1:17:21] around this message that are walking
[1:17:23] around with measuring sticks in their
[1:17:24] Hip Pocket to see how long the sister's
[1:17:27] dresses are and amen looking around to
[1:17:29] see if there's toenail pain or looking
[1:17:30] around and see if there's a necklace on
[1:17:32] them or some kind of how straight is
[1:17:34] their hair anyways
[1:17:35] and unfortunately you sisters are the
[1:17:37] one to get the brunt of that Brothers
[1:17:39] can hide a little bit easier than the
[1:17:41] women can amen and least little thing a
[1:17:43] woman does somebody's ready to trounce
[1:17:45] on them amen like a lion waiting in the
[1:17:47] jungle of someone another amen don't you
[1:17:49] know what we're doing to our sisters
[1:17:51] when we single them out every time they
[1:17:53] come to church we're making them feel
[1:17:55] like a second-class citizen we're making
[1:17:57] them feel like doormats amen and the
[1:18:00] Bible doesn't support it God condemns
[1:18:02] such a thing and God wants us to show
[1:18:04] love one to another
[1:18:07] and then hang in there with me a little
[1:18:08] while I won't hold you along just about
[1:18:10] three hours don't worry about it
[1:18:13] amen now listen again let's read it one
[1:18:15] more time Paul said fulfill you my joy
[1:18:18] if there be any consolation if there be
[1:18:22] any comfort of love if there be any
[1:18:24] Fellowship of the spirit if there be any
[1:18:26] vows or Mercies
[1:18:28] fulfill my joy that you're like-minded
[1:18:31] now having the Same Love
[1:18:34] having the same mind the word that Paul
[1:18:36] uses here is to agree together
[1:18:39] to cherish the same views
[1:18:42] to be harmonious
[1:18:45] to strive for one's interest or
[1:18:47] Advantage I like this one
[1:18:49] to be of one's party
[1:18:52] and to side with him in public affairs
[1:18:55] in public affairs now you see that
[1:18:57] reminds me brother Adam said it like
[1:18:59] this he said me and the branhams used to
[1:19:02] fight in the backyard
[1:19:04] he said now that was us branham's in the
[1:19:06] backyard he said but let one person jump
[1:19:09] on one of us branhams in the front yard
[1:19:10] and it was a different story
[1:19:13] amen that's what Paul's trying to tell
[1:19:15] us brother Jose he's trying to tell us
[1:19:17] that if we are to be like-minded it
[1:19:19] doesn't mean we have to agree 100 with
[1:19:21] another one
[1:19:24] insert amen here
[1:19:28] come on
[1:19:30] come on don't you get quiet on me I'll
[1:19:31] just get right out in the aisle and look
[1:19:32] you eye about eyeball come on
[1:19:34] right God ain't wanting us to be in
[1:19:37] total Harmony in the way of oh I see
[1:19:39] everything like you see it we will never
[1:19:41] see everything I die there'll be aspects
[1:19:44] of my walk and my vision and my thoughts
[1:19:46] and whatever whatever whatever that will
[1:19:47] not be the same as yours but God didn't
[1:19:50] ask me to be in total complete agreement
[1:19:52] with everybody I know but he asked me to
[1:19:54] live in harmony with him amen if you
[1:19:57] believe in one God if you believe in
[1:19:58] Jesus name baptism if you believe in a
[1:20:00] prophet messenger if you believe in
[1:20:02] wholeness amen there we can shake hands
[1:20:05] and be brothers and sisters
[1:20:08] and in the backyard we might sit in the
[1:20:10] fellowship hall and just just go at each
[1:20:12] other amen but don't let nobody pick on
[1:20:14] you in the front yard
[1:20:16] that's being like-minded having the same
[1:20:19] feeling you know we should never be the
[1:20:21] kind of people that when we see it
[1:20:23] listen I get aggravated that people like
[1:20:25] you do I might be a little bit more
[1:20:26] vocal than some of you are because some
[1:20:28] of y'all too holy to tell the truth
[1:20:31] I get aggravated at folks I see them
[1:20:33] living in a way that they shouldn't live
[1:20:34] I say that's the stupidest thing I've
[1:20:36] ever seen in my life
[1:20:38] my wife tells me all the time you are
[1:20:40] blunt as a hammer you think you're nice
[1:20:42] but you're really not sometimes I said
[1:20:44] well you're probably right about that
[1:20:46] amen but I get aggravated at people why
[1:20:49] I love them
[1:20:51] I haven't given my life In a Pulpit 31
[1:20:53] years around the world because I don't
[1:20:54] want to see people make it I get
[1:20:56] frustrated at him because I know they
[1:20:58] can do better I know they got a better
[1:20:59] potential yet they won't absorb it into
[1:21:01] their hearts
[1:21:03] and yet that frustration you got to be
[1:21:05] careful there's a line there a level of
[1:21:07] frustration as you've got to remember
[1:21:08] sometimes God is the one in control and
[1:21:11] he's allowing that person to go through
[1:21:13] that Valley or that circumstance because
[1:21:14] there's something to mold them on the
[1:21:16] other side and you got to keep your
[1:21:17] little fingers and your little nosy nosy
[1:21:19] out of the business let God do the
[1:21:21] molding let God do the Shaving let God
[1:21:23] do the work on the person come on
[1:21:25] somebody
[1:21:27] you can't always take it into your hands
[1:21:29] as the final outworking of life
[1:21:32] right sometimes I look at people and I
[1:21:34] go feel sad for them that doesn't mean
[1:21:37] that I agree with everything they do
[1:21:38] I've had people in my life and Ministry
[1:21:41] I'm sure you have too that have just
[1:21:43] absolutely had such a spirit they want
[1:21:45] to kill you about things
[1:21:47] I'd have a lot more friends if I wasn't
[1:21:48] a preacher
[1:21:51] I've lost a lot of them preaching the
[1:21:52] truth standing for what's right A lot of
[1:21:54] them just turn their back on you flat I
[1:21:57] mean it hurts you when that happens amen
[1:21:59] but I don't just take that person and
[1:22:01] throw them off in hell and say Good
[1:22:02] Riddance good enough for you serves you
[1:22:04] right I start saying Lord I don't know
[1:22:07] what's going on in the front yard out
[1:22:09] here but God I'm going to do my very
[1:22:10] best to try to win them back with the
[1:22:12] love of God
[1:22:13] doesn't mean you compromise with them
[1:22:15] but it means that if you're going to put
[1:22:16] them in their place you'd be standing
[1:22:18] there while they're in their place with
[1:22:19] your arms out like this and say if you
[1:22:20] want to get straightened out right
[1:22:21] here's the way out I'll help you
[1:22:24] problem is we dig people in a hole and
[1:22:26] we leave them there
[1:22:27] and my Holy Ghost come with an escape
[1:22:29] hatch
[1:22:30] if I put somebody in and if he puts me
[1:22:32] in a trial the Bible said he would give
[1:22:34] me a way out amen amen he said in all
[1:22:37] the trials you've got I provide a way of
[1:22:40] escape to let you escape it amen my Holy
[1:22:43] Ghost has got an escape hatch
[1:22:46] yes sir nothing I get in he can't bring
[1:22:49] me out of it nothing that comes before
[1:22:51] me I could get cornered right up amen
[1:22:53] he's got a way of Escape for me to get
[1:22:55] out of there
[1:22:57] the bride ain't never been cornered into
[1:22:59] a place he can't make a hole through it
[1:23:02] the idea is that we as Christians many
[1:23:04] times you know you hear people even
[1:23:06] blaspheming the message
[1:23:08] they say oh done with them be careful
[1:23:11] Paul himself said he was a blasphemer
[1:23:14] if you'd have been standing there prior
[1:23:16] to Paul's conversion you'd have thrown
[1:23:18] the quotes at him
[1:23:20] you just said well you know Jesus said
[1:23:22] say a word against the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:23:24] never be forgiven but you see God has a
[1:23:26] different opinion than we do sometimes
[1:23:28] right and he looks at people through
[1:23:30] different eyes sometimes
[1:23:32] that's where we need to see people
[1:23:33] Through The Eyes of Calvary Through The
[1:23:35] Eyes of Jesus Christ having the same
[1:23:38] love having a harmony with people
[1:23:42] there are some folks I don't agree with
[1:23:43] because I see things they do and I think
[1:23:45] I shouldn't do that but I'm not going to
[1:23:47] kick them out
[1:23:48] I'm not going to cast them aside we're
[1:23:51] all on a journey
[1:23:56] some of you might be thinking you've
[1:23:57] arrived I got news for you probably
[1:23:59] ain't got started yet
[1:24:01] hello
[1:24:02] hello
[1:24:04] we're just on the way you said well I'm
[1:24:06] an old man old woman that doesn't matter
[1:24:08] where you are rather than look beyond
[1:24:09] the curtain of time there's a woman
[1:24:10] sitting there he said a beautiful woman
[1:24:12] he said she was past 90 when you led her
[1:24:15] to the Lord
[1:24:16] don't ever get it in your mind that age
[1:24:18] means that you're closer to God ain't
[1:24:20] got nothing to do with it amen God ain't
[1:24:22] as respecter of persons or aides or
[1:24:24] countenance or position or Prestige or
[1:24:26] nothing come on somebody
[1:24:28] all he looks at is a sincerity and the
[1:24:32] surrender of somebody's heart
[1:24:34] are they willing to give themselves to
[1:24:36] Jesus Christ or not
[1:24:37] amen amen
[1:24:39] oh praise the Lord let nothing be done
[1:24:42] through life or vain Glory now this is
[1:24:45] the condition that the bride is going to
[1:24:48] be in before the rapture
[1:24:51] looking pretty bleak right now ain't it
[1:24:53] but he's going to get us there sure
[1:24:55] enough now listen to this again the
[1:24:57] message Paradox brother remember says
[1:24:58] now how are we going to lose this great
[1:25:01] race question mark
[1:25:03] it's because we're divided
[1:25:07] how are we going to do it we've got to
[1:25:10] stay together
[1:25:15] because you see if you start drawing
[1:25:17] lines in the Sabbath who don't agree
[1:25:18] with you where does that stop
[1:25:21] and don't forget every time you draw a
[1:25:23] line in the sand on somebody somebody
[1:25:25] can draw the line on you
[1:25:27] this is what Jesus said judge not that
[1:25:29] you turn around and be judged the same
[1:25:30] way
[1:25:31] now if it's something on the basis of
[1:25:33] the word that's one thing the word will
[1:25:35] always separate truth from Air
[1:25:37] there are some people just like Saint
[1:25:39] John 6 6 that could No More Walk With
[1:25:41] Jesus not because Jesus didn't level
[1:25:44] not because Jesus didn't want to see him
[1:25:46] get saved but because they could not
[1:25:48] accept the word they couldn't walk with
[1:25:49] Christ themselves right now notice he
[1:25:52] said the Holy Ghost will take us all in
[1:25:56] it'll be a paradox
[1:25:58] if God ever gets us together
[1:26:01] but he will just trust him laughs
[1:26:06] he knows how to send persecution
[1:26:10] that will run us together
[1:26:13] I don't mind telling you just looking
[1:26:15] around this building this morning all of
[1:26:18] the things we've experienced in this
[1:26:19] province out here the last 20 years I've
[1:26:22] evangelized to you many years now I've
[1:26:24] watched you separated I've watched you
[1:26:26] divide it and I've watched you come
[1:26:28] together under the auspices of the holy
[1:26:30] spirit amen my hat is off to these Godly
[1:26:33] men amen and women around this message
[1:26:34] that have done their best in this
[1:26:36] province right here to find Unity One
[1:26:38] with another amen 10 years ago this
[1:26:41] province was as decided as I've ever
[1:26:43] seen anywhere in the entire continent of
[1:26:45] North America remember the Holy Ghost
[1:26:47] through your determination and your
[1:26:49] desire to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:52] has helped you find Harmony
[1:26:54] don't you know that's what the devil
[1:26:56] hates he knows that in unity There Is
[1:26:59] Power
[1:27:01] amen and if there's power in Harmony and
[1:27:03] unity amen you get one lick of fire to
[1:27:06] put it with another one another one
[1:27:07] another one another one amen it will run
[1:27:09] every devil out of here and put them
[1:27:11] under your feet
[1:27:15] I remember when I was doing the camp out
[1:27:17] there amen one of the first camps we did
[1:27:19] God Almighty I heard one criticism after
[1:27:21] another
[1:27:22] people jumped all over me you ought to
[1:27:25] know better than that but I saw the
[1:27:26] vision
[1:27:27] that the tomatoes and the other people
[1:27:28] had I saw the vision of trying to bring
[1:27:31] people together without one big boss
[1:27:33] over everything
[1:27:35] amen trying to run this on a corner and
[1:27:38] run that one this way listen God wants
[1:27:40] us to be so together that we could chew
[1:27:42] each other's chewing gum
[1:27:45] and in a coveted age that's a pretty God
[1:27:48] that's not a big dose of God's grace
[1:27:51] Amen to be in such a condition that
[1:27:54] you'd even be willing to pull your mass
[1:27:56] down long enough to choose somebody's
[1:27:58] chewing gum
[1:28:00] I don't mean no harm but brother Brenham
[1:28:03] said that's the kind of love we should
[1:28:04] have one for another
[1:28:05] amen don't get me no chewing gum I ain't
[1:28:07] chewing your chewing gum
[1:28:09] remember what he's talking about is he's
[1:28:11] talking about the love we have one for
[1:28:13] another amen you have a personality
[1:28:16] about you you may not always be a people
[1:28:18] person that's okay but you need to be
[1:28:20] available that if someone needs you God
[1:28:23] can use you for that person's life
[1:28:26] right
[1:28:27] this is the reason why people with gifts
[1:28:30] they have a hard time exercising them
[1:28:32] singing and doing other things in the
[1:28:34] body because they feel like they're such
[1:28:35] a strange duck or an odd duck they don't
[1:28:38] feel like they got any value in the body
[1:28:41] every person in this church this morning
[1:28:44] has some value somewhere
[1:28:49] I don't care your age or station or how
[1:28:51] much money you make or don't make you
[1:28:53] have value in the eyes of Jesus Christ
[1:28:56] come on somebody preach to me amen the
[1:28:59] Holy Ghost wants you to see that you are
[1:29:01] valuable to the body of Jesus Christ
[1:29:05] you're not a second-class citizen
[1:29:08] Amen to brother Jose some years ago I
[1:29:10] remember we had that big meeting
[1:29:11] remember we called all the Brethren up
[1:29:13] to the platform garms and show we're
[1:29:16] going to have Unity amen these Brethren
[1:29:18] have kept that alive since the Holy
[1:29:20] Spirit gave that oh God I got criticized
[1:29:22] by preachers
[1:29:24] do you know who you had on the platform
[1:29:26] with you I said well I got two eyes I
[1:29:28] reckon I did
[1:29:30] didn't matter whether I agree with their
[1:29:32] theologies or not
[1:29:33] and not that I disagree with these
[1:29:35] Brethren I don't mean that but I mean in
[1:29:36] general speaking it didn't matter what
[1:29:38] we saw Adam or didn't see amen what I
[1:29:40] saw was the need for Unity amongst the
[1:29:43] body of Christ
[1:29:46] amen but people have such a strong
[1:29:48] stance about everything
[1:29:50] you know and if you don't see this one
[1:29:52] issue Hallelujah then you don't even
[1:29:54] bribe that's not for you to call or
[1:29:56] anybody else to determine that's up to
[1:29:58] Jesus Christ to call
[1:29:59] and if I've got to Holy Ghost and my
[1:30:01] doctrine of my understanding is wrong
[1:30:03] about something that's up to him to make
[1:30:04] it right for me to understand it not
[1:30:07] somebody else
[1:30:08] amen the Bible said the Holy Ghost would
[1:30:10] lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:30:12] didn't say you would
[1:30:15] didn't say I would
[1:30:17] hello
[1:30:19] I'm putting my glasses on to see you
[1:30:21] frowning at me amen
[1:30:23] right that's true notice now let's go
[1:30:25] back to Philippians chapter 2 verse 19
[1:30:27] now
[1:30:28] now I want you to listen at a couple
[1:30:30] things
[1:30:31] Paul identifying Timothy as his son in
[1:30:35] the gospel and uses this term
[1:30:37] like-minded again for Timothy now watch
[1:30:39] us Philippians 2 19 but I trust in the
[1:30:41] Lord Jesus
[1:30:42] to send to methus shortly unto you
[1:30:45] that I also may be of good Comfort when
[1:30:48] I know your state
[1:30:49] for I have no man
[1:30:52] like-minded
[1:30:53] who will naturally care for your state
[1:30:57] now the word he uses here for
[1:30:58] like-minded in this case is equal in
[1:31:01] Soul
[1:31:02] as far as Paul was concerned
[1:31:06] Timothy had the spirit the vision and
[1:31:09] the purpose of Paul's message so close
[1:31:12] to his heart
[1:31:14] that to Paul when Timothy was standing
[1:31:16] here it was the same as if Paul was
[1:31:18] standing there
[1:31:22] I don't know what that does to you but
[1:31:24] I'll tell you what it does to me I want
[1:31:25] to have such the same vision brother
[1:31:27] Branham I want to have such the same
[1:31:29] ideas and the passion and and the
[1:31:31] purposes that brother Branham had in his
[1:31:33] heart for Humanity and for the bride of
[1:31:35] Christ that every time I stand Here it'd
[1:31:37] be the same as the prophet of God
[1:31:39] standing here
[1:31:41] I may not sound like him and say good
[1:31:43] evening friends and I may not amen like
[1:31:45] hunting and running around doing those
[1:31:46] things and out in the wilderness that
[1:31:47] brother Brown did amen but I can have
[1:31:49] the same vision the same purpose and the
[1:31:52] same mind that brother Branham had and
[1:31:54] preach it just exactly like it'd be him
[1:31:56] delivering it himself
[1:32:00] oh I know that that that shakes the
[1:32:03] group I feel it
[1:32:04] you say well that I don't know if I can
[1:32:06] trust that hang on
[1:32:08] what you're saying is you don't know if
[1:32:10] you can trust your feeling about it
[1:32:12] you can trust God's word because he said
[1:32:14] he gave
[1:32:16] some Apostles prophets teachers
[1:32:17] evangelists and pastors
[1:32:19] he gave Farmers Factory workers
[1:32:22] Housewives
[1:32:24] and maybe a lawyer or two every now and
[1:32:26] who knows
[1:32:28] come on
[1:32:30] you understand God set in the body those
[1:32:34] that would have the same vision the same
[1:32:36] purpose well we can't trust men that's
[1:32:39] what the tape people are saying we can't
[1:32:41] trust them to give us the truth we can't
[1:32:42] trust but the Bible didn't say that the
[1:32:45] Bible did not say that brother Branham
[1:32:47] was the only one we could trust in this
[1:32:49] age find it
[1:32:51] find me one place that brother man said
[1:32:53] I'm the only one you can listen to and
[1:32:54] Trust in the last day
[1:32:56] he didn't even believe that about
[1:32:57] praying for the sick
[1:32:59] look how many times he come to the end
[1:33:01] of a prayer line he'd say now to show
[1:33:02] you that this ain't all about me I want
[1:33:04] my brethren to come up here and lay
[1:33:05] hands on the sick too
[1:33:07] same purpose same vision same mind same
[1:33:10] thoughts Same Love same Comfort there be
[1:33:13] any vows of Mercy have that same purpose
[1:33:15] be equal in Soul
[1:33:18] if a man preaches with that kind of
[1:33:20] vision this is why it's always so
[1:33:21] important to keep that message right on
[1:33:22] the Bible and keep that Bible right on
[1:33:24] the message and keep everything married
[1:33:25] together so when you present this to the
[1:33:27] body of Christ amen they can feel it
[1:33:29] just like brother Brennan will be
[1:33:31] standing right here
[1:33:33] I want to preach repentance in Jesus
[1:33:35] name the same as if Simon Peter was
[1:33:36] standing right here
[1:33:41] just the same passion he had at
[1:33:43] Pentecost where he said men and brethren
[1:33:45] what can we do to be saved and Peter
[1:33:47] screamed down repair every one of you
[1:33:49] and be baptized God let my soul be knit
[1:33:52] together with you
[1:33:54] that when I preached repentance in the
[1:33:55] name of Jesus Christ and baptism in the
[1:33:57] name of Jesus Christ let me say it just
[1:33:59] exactly the same way that Peter would
[1:34:00] have said it with those keys jangling in
[1:34:02] his hand
[1:34:05] that way the people can trust the word
[1:34:07] not me
[1:34:09] because that's what we're supposed to
[1:34:10] trust anyways the word
[1:34:12] not just some man cursed it is he that
[1:34:14] leans to the arm of the flesh but not
[1:34:16] the one that leans to the word word is
[1:34:18] what's got the power in it
[1:34:20] that's the one that's got the authority
[1:34:21] in it
[1:34:23] I love this again Titus Chapter 1 Verse
[1:34:25] 4.
[1:34:26] now Paul then calls Titus his own son
[1:34:29] after the common Faith he calls it
[1:34:32] then again in first Timothy 1 and 2
[1:34:35] Timothy my own son in the faith First
[1:34:37] Timothy 1 18 this charge I commit unto
[1:34:41] thee son Timothy
[1:34:42] second Timothy 1 2 to Timothy my dearly
[1:34:46] beloved Son second Timothy 2 and 1. thou
[1:34:49] therefore my son then in Philemon
[1:34:52] chapter 1 verse 10 I beseech thee from
[1:34:54] my son onsimus
[1:34:57] so here these men are being identified
[1:35:00] in the Bible by Paul who said if anyone
[1:35:02] comes contrary even Me Myself and
[1:35:05] preaches anything different let him be
[1:35:06] accursed
[1:35:08] and this Saint Paul tells
[1:35:11] what you've learned from me
[1:35:14] commit thou to the hands of Faithful Men
[1:35:17] and ordain Elders in every city
[1:35:22] didn't say order hey players
[1:35:26] hello I'm telling my age and the young
[1:35:28] people went tape tape what tape Scotch
[1:35:30] tape duct tape
[1:35:32] didn't say take mechanical devices and
[1:35:35] set them up on the platform
[1:35:37] so one thing that I'm so grateful of
[1:35:39] when we hit that coveted time amen we
[1:35:41] might have had to use the internet amen
[1:35:43] but men of God proved that even if they
[1:35:45] shut the church down they'll never shut
[1:35:47] the bride up she'll keep on preaching no
[1:35:49] matter what
[1:35:53] somebody asked me when everything went
[1:35:54] down they said what did you do I said I
[1:35:56] was preaching more during that time and
[1:35:58] I'd ever been preaching in life
[1:36:00] amen I was doing broadcasts every single
[1:36:03] week I was on the internet I was
[1:36:04] recording videos and sending to people
[1:36:06] to preach I preached one here in the
[1:36:08] church amen that I'd preached a month
[1:36:09] before that or something and I sent it
[1:36:11] over amen what I'm trying to say the
[1:36:13] prophet said they'll never shut the
[1:36:15] bride up God will take her up out of
[1:36:17] here amen She'll always have a voice
[1:36:21] that voice is the voice of God to this
[1:36:24] last generation
[1:36:28] and if we've got the same ideas
[1:36:31] the same passion
[1:36:33] let me read it again
[1:36:35] here is the secret of this
[1:36:38] that no one was reading Friday night I
[1:36:40] was going to hit this thing Sunday
[1:36:41] morning
[1:36:42] the word is in the bride
[1:36:47] whether they'll start reading this and I
[1:36:49] punch Samantha I said wait wait till
[1:36:50] Sunday
[1:36:52] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:36:55] knows what he wants done with that word
[1:36:58] and she performs the command of the word
[1:37:01] in his name for she has the saith the
[1:37:07] Lord
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:13] preach right he said then the word is
[1:37:17] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:37:19] pass like a seed planted and watered it
[1:37:22] comes to full Harvest serving its
[1:37:26] purpose
[1:37:27] amen so that bride not only has the word
[1:37:31] and the mind she knows what he wants
[1:37:33] done with that word
[1:37:35] now folks this is where we've got to get
[1:37:37] in our mind if I've got to hold his
[1:37:39] Spirit if I've got to word if I've got
[1:37:41] that seed inside my heart and I see my
[1:37:43] brothers and sisters in a spot to where
[1:37:45] that they don't know what the answer is
[1:37:49] what am I supposed to do take that word
[1:37:51] that's buried in my heart talk to Daddy
[1:37:53] a little while and say help me find an
[1:37:55] answer to help my brother and my sister
[1:37:59] you see divided we're weak
[1:38:03] unified we're strong
[1:38:06] yeah I can't be legalist about this now
[1:38:08] can't be my foreign no more you got to
[1:38:10] keep up keep a little door on your
[1:38:11] circle to let other people in
[1:38:14] uh-huh
[1:38:16] because if you don't that's what we call
[1:38:17] denomination
[1:38:21] let me say to you like the ones I teach
[1:38:22] English as I said denomination say it
[1:38:25] denomination
[1:38:27] that's the spirit of organization
[1:38:30] if they don't agree with me they don't
[1:38:31] agree with you we don't agree with each
[1:38:33] other and whatever whatever if you're
[1:38:34] Baptist you're Baptist you're Catholic
[1:38:35] you're Catholic you're method should
[1:38:36] Memphis whatever you are amen that is a
[1:38:39] disorganized Spirit God don't want that
[1:38:41] in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:38:44] remember the Bible the message itself
[1:38:45] has been revealed will never become an
[1:38:47] organizational thing amen the message
[1:38:49] itself there's no period in the message
[1:38:52] the longer I study it the more God keeps
[1:38:54] revealing in this message but there are
[1:38:56] denominational Spirits right around our
[1:38:58] ranks
[1:39:00] they do everything they can to divide
[1:39:02] and put their little feelers out there
[1:39:04] to see do you see it like I said do you
[1:39:06] agree with me I'm not talking about
[1:39:07] people a man that are living in filth
[1:39:10] that we should agree with them or people
[1:39:12] that live like the devil are completely
[1:39:13] blaspheming the very truth of this
[1:39:15] message amen we've got to be careful who
[1:39:17] we walk with that's true amen but if
[1:39:19] you're talking about little tiny things
[1:39:21] along the way amen when you see a man or
[1:39:24] woman doing their best to serve God Amen
[1:39:26] stop taking them in the mud and lift
[1:39:29] them up and be a brother and a sister to
[1:39:31] them
[1:39:33] amen because any one of us could go home
[1:39:35] with each other and by the end of the
[1:39:36] night pull the book on each other
[1:39:38] you could pull the book on me and I
[1:39:40] could pull the book on you but if we're
[1:39:41] trying to serve God that's the key of it
[1:39:43] all amen if our desire is to serve Jesus
[1:39:46] Christ that's what you focus on
[1:39:50] praise the Lord
[1:39:52] Ryan having the same mind she has thus
[1:39:55] saith the Lord so if she's got it
[1:39:57] word is revealed to my heart let's say
[1:40:00] God reveals something to me and shows me
[1:40:02] something that could help somebody else
[1:40:04] that I take experience and I take things
[1:40:06] that I've gone through and things that
[1:40:08] I've had happen or whatever it may be
[1:40:10] and I take that and I mix it with an
[1:40:12] answer in the word of God and I tell it
[1:40:14] to that brother or that sister or that
[1:40:15] family or whatever
[1:40:16] that's as though God is speaking to that
[1:40:19] person
[1:40:23] it's a hard one to swallow ain't it
[1:40:25] but it ain't your thought
[1:40:27] it's the word of God you're using
[1:40:30] and when God brings you through
[1:40:31] something and you've got a testimony
[1:40:34] that testimony mixed with the word the
[1:40:37] revelation of truth that is God speaking
[1:40:39] to that I'll put him get somewhere
[1:40:42] amen I was reading a thing on Facebook
[1:40:44] the other day some person got on there
[1:40:46] some poor blind deluded keyboard Warrior
[1:40:50] keyboard Warrior that's all they are
[1:40:51] they ain't got enough guts in them to
[1:40:53] stand face to face with the man of God
[1:40:54] or with the servant of the Lord and talk
[1:40:56] plainly to people they've got to hide
[1:40:58] behind a computer somewhere another
[1:41:00] I said ain't no such thing as good
[1:41:01] preachers and right preachers the only
[1:41:03] right preachers there are are the ones
[1:41:05] that puts brother Brennan back in the
[1:41:06] Pulpit well I got news for that bunch I
[1:41:08] never took him out of it
[1:41:10] I pack him with me every time I preach
[1:41:13] you listen to me for 30 minutes you're
[1:41:14] gonna hear me say brother Brown and said
[1:41:16] the prophet said the Bible said
[1:41:17] amen I never took him out of the pulpit
[1:41:20] he's always been here in Spirits because
[1:41:22] I've got his soul his mind his passion
[1:41:25] his ideas
[1:41:26] and having that same soul of that same
[1:41:28] nature and I don't mean literally now
[1:41:30] but that same spiritual something from
[1:41:32] Christ to see the message for what it
[1:41:34] should be that's been carrying with me
[1:41:35] since God anointed me to preach
[1:41:38] I never took him out of it amen only
[1:41:40] those that believe he's never been here
[1:41:42] and never been around they just don't
[1:41:44] understand amen that the very Spirit of
[1:41:46] Elijah never left this age even though
[1:41:49] he pulled the man the spirit remained on
[1:41:51] the people
[1:41:53] amen amen and how's it being fulfilled
[1:41:56] in this day and age will the bride
[1:41:57] brother around however revivalist said
[1:41:59] that's what's going on will she have a
[1:42:01] Ministry he said that's it Apostles
[1:42:03] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:42:04] pastors
[1:42:06] oh thank you Lord notice in Romans
[1:42:08] chapter 12 verse 16. let's put this one
[1:42:11] up together Romans 12 and 16.
[1:42:15] be of the same mind
[1:42:18] one toward another
[1:42:26] does yours say the same thing mind does
[1:42:31] mine not high things
[1:42:35] wow
[1:42:37] so you see the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:42:39] isn't going to be shooting for the
[1:42:41] loftiness of society
[1:42:45] you know she doesn't want to live so
[1:42:47] high and mighty
[1:42:48] that the poor beggar coming off the
[1:42:50] street of the prostitute can't seem to
[1:42:53] connect with him
[1:42:56] praise God
[1:42:58] you know the people that Jesus
[1:43:00] interacted with that misunderstood him
[1:43:01] was these Pharisees that were here
[1:43:04] high and lofty you know the ones that
[1:43:07] understood him prostitutes Beggars
[1:43:09] thieves Liars whoremongers
[1:43:12] you know why Jesus made himself
[1:43:14] available to them
[1:43:16] we almost treat people in the messages
[1:43:18] though if they're just not right up in
[1:43:20] some big lofty Godly business I've seen
[1:43:22] people in the message put one preacher
[1:43:24] up like he's the greatest in the world
[1:43:25] because he has such a powerful gift and
[1:43:28] some little low brother that's barely
[1:43:30] able to harvest speak but yet he's cold
[1:43:31] yet he doesn't have a great delivery and
[1:43:33] they treat him like he's a second-class
[1:43:35] citizen and put this big preacher up
[1:43:37] over there you are doing the same thing
[1:43:40] that every denomination is done for 200
[1:43:42] years
[1:43:45] I don't care if he's Spanish or he's
[1:43:47] German or whatever he might be if he's
[1:43:50] got the Holy Ghost and gifted to preach
[1:43:52] to me he's my brother and I want to open
[1:43:54] my heart to what he has to say
[1:43:58] not everybody's called to preach to
[1:44:00] everybody
[1:44:02] some people are called to certain
[1:44:04] circles of the world and I may only get
[1:44:06] a nugget out of that preaching but in
[1:44:08] that nugget better than nothing
[1:44:12] uh-huh we shouldn't have our favorite
[1:44:14] preachers
[1:44:17] we should have our favorite Jesus
[1:44:21] oh
[1:44:23] aliens were quiet and I know when they
[1:44:26] get quiet usually is when they're being
[1:44:27] preached on
[1:44:30] come on now caught with your hand and
[1:44:32] the cookie jar a little bit are you
[1:44:34] well I know we got our favorites listen
[1:44:36] we can have people we enjoy hearing but
[1:44:38] nobody should be a favorite
[1:44:46] the word should be the favorite
[1:44:51] hahaha
[1:44:53] right but condescend to men
[1:44:57] of low estate
[1:44:59] huh
[1:45:01] kind of sounds like humility to me
[1:45:06] be not wise in your own conceits or your
[1:45:10] own conceptions of what you think and
[1:45:12] what you believe
[1:45:14] Romans chapter 15 now verse 5.
[1:45:17] did I go a bit further thank you
[1:45:20] say it quick before you can say no
[1:45:23] Romans 15 5 watch us now the god of
[1:45:26] patience
[1:45:28] and consolation grants you to be
[1:45:30] like-minded one toward another
[1:45:33] according to Christ Jesus
[1:45:37] did you notice how he introduced this
[1:45:38] the god of patience
[1:45:42] because God knows he's going to need a
[1:45:44] lot of patience until we get like-minded
[1:45:49] come on preach to me now
[1:45:52] right he knows he's gonna have to be
[1:45:54] long suffering he knows he's going to
[1:45:57] have to wait it out because you get two
[1:45:59] two ideas
[1:46:02] and it takes a while just like a
[1:46:04] marriage it takes a while to blend your
[1:46:06] spirits together and to find Harmony
[1:46:09] but you know you can do it if you try
[1:46:12] if you try hard enough you can find
[1:46:14] Unity with somebody you completely
[1:46:16] disagree with
[1:46:21] they said that's the one thing about
[1:46:22] brother Bradham he said that you never
[1:46:24] knew who his friends were you never who
[1:46:25] his enemies were
[1:46:29] well Hallelujah
[1:46:32] should we have the altar call now or
[1:46:36] oh I know it stings it should it should
[1:46:39] shame on all of us me included for
[1:46:42] allowing such foolishness to enter into
[1:46:44] the message of this hour
[1:46:45] this is the smut Brothers said keep off
[1:46:47] it having these attitudes in these ways
[1:46:50] and I don't like that one I don't know
[1:46:51] what that One Believes and I don't like
[1:46:52] the way he says that and I don't even
[1:46:54] know these quotes I don't care whether
[1:46:56] or not somebody believes that God is
[1:46:59] green blue or purple if he's trying to
[1:47:01] serve God I figure all of us will figure
[1:47:03] it out down the road
[1:47:06] just because somebody has maybe a
[1:47:08] different view on something that does
[1:47:09] not mean that I can put them out of the
[1:47:11] body of Christ
[1:47:12] besides how do I know I'm not wrong
[1:47:17] aha
[1:47:19] amen
[1:47:21] oh mercy even the preacher's getting
[1:47:23] quiet on me babies are even getting
[1:47:24] quiet on me
[1:47:26] right second Corinthians Chapter 13
[1:47:28] Verse 7.
[1:47:32] finally Brethren farewell
[1:47:34] be perfect
[1:47:36] be of good comforts
[1:47:39] be of one mind
[1:47:41] live in peace
[1:47:45] and the god of love and peace shall be
[1:47:47] with you
[1:47:52] well now we're supposed to be another
[1:47:54] book of Acts right
[1:47:57] we're supposed to write another book
[1:47:58] right we're supposed to put forth
[1:48:01] another Branch right
[1:48:03] I'll just say the way you Canadian said
[1:48:05] a
[1:48:08] huh
[1:48:09] what if we're going to put it forth and
[1:48:11] this is what it looks like
[1:48:13] an apple ain't going to put forth
[1:48:15] oranges oranges ain't going to produce
[1:48:17] tangelo it's a tangible ain't going to
[1:48:18] produce a pear if we are supposed to
[1:48:20] repeat the book of Acts having the same
[1:48:23] love same mind living in peace one with
[1:48:26] another do you think these disciples
[1:48:28] didn't disagree with each other from
[1:48:30] time to time go back and look at Paul
[1:48:31] and the disagreement he had over over
[1:48:33] John Mark
[1:48:35] the contention was so sharp that they
[1:48:38] couldn't even speak to one another for a
[1:48:40] period of time
[1:48:41] goes to prove there's going to be
[1:48:43] disagreements in the body of Christ
[1:48:45] it ain't whether you disagree is how you
[1:48:47] handle it
[1:48:48] because even though Paul took a stand
[1:48:50] about what he felt about that boy he
[1:48:52] also allowed him to be proven wrong
[1:48:56] because he come along later and
[1:48:58] basically said in so many words I was
[1:49:01] wrong I know I know that's going to take
[1:49:04] a lot of God to get some of you there
[1:49:08] hello
[1:49:10] but that right there is the key to
[1:49:11] Christianity being able to surrender
[1:49:13] yourself to God enough to admit when you
[1:49:15] miss the mark somewhere
[1:49:17] to be able to say you're wrong that's
[1:49:19] Christ and a person doing that I
[1:49:21] misunderstood it I don't see it right it
[1:49:23] should be this way or that way to be
[1:49:25] able to say I was wrong that's Jesus
[1:49:27] Christ in a human heart that make a
[1:49:29] person be that way
[1:49:31] absolutely right amen the Serenity and
[1:49:34] the sincerity of a Christian amen
[1:49:36] doesn't come from how right they are
[1:49:38] it's how willing they are to be taught
[1:49:42] to be corrected by the word
[1:49:45] we should look at ourselves as Christian
[1:49:47] lifelong learners
[1:49:51] we should view ourselves as people who
[1:49:53] are always learning and coming to a
[1:49:56] knowledge of the truth
[1:49:58] amen
[1:50:01] look at this in the same mind the idea
[1:50:03] of the same mind you had Moses and
[1:50:05] Joshua Elijah Elijah
[1:50:08] you have the great leader
[1:50:11] being a great follower as well as you've
[1:50:13] heard me say before great leaders are
[1:50:15] great followers they follow Jesus Christ
[1:50:18] let this attitude or beatitude this
[1:50:21] attitude be in you that was in Christ
[1:50:22] Jesus same attitude or beatitude
[1:50:25] speaking the same Paul said and
[1:50:29] when someone
[1:50:31] looks at that name Branham
[1:50:34] don't forget that Abraham was a father
[1:50:37] of Nations h-a-m means father
[1:50:40] of Nations
[1:50:41] and Branham has got some Sons and
[1:50:44] Daughters here too
[1:50:48] this is the Canadian portion of them
[1:50:53] this is a small cross-section of the
[1:50:55] Canadian bride
[1:50:57] there's the African bride those in the
[1:50:59] western Canada and Alberta and Vancouver
[1:51:01] might be all of these people that make
[1:51:03] up the body of Jesus Christ we're a
[1:51:05] small cross-section of just this little
[1:51:07] part of the body
[1:51:08] but Branham was able to produce children
[1:51:12] oh you say I'm no son of brother Branham
[1:51:15] then I guess Timothy wasn't a son to
[1:51:16] Paul
[1:51:18] as Paul said he was he said Titus
[1:51:21] Timothy and unsummus was sons in the
[1:51:23] gospel to him
[1:51:28] you realize a boy who looked
[1:51:30] looks father
[1:51:34] a girl that looks like her daddy can't
[1:51:36] help it
[1:51:39] you ever heard him say about situations
[1:51:41] where they're not sure where the boy or
[1:51:42] the girl come from or something like
[1:51:43] that and they say oh I know who their
[1:51:45] daddy is you look right at them and look
[1:51:47] right at them and you can see that's the
[1:51:48] daddy
[1:51:49] they don't even need Maury Povich or
[1:51:51] some of these guys on those talk shows
[1:51:52] to tell who the father is
[1:51:54] amen one thing's for sure you look at me
[1:51:56] you look at others you know there's a no
[1:51:58] Rod that big old nose hanging in the
[1:52:00] middle there
[1:52:01] amen we all look just like one another
[1:52:03] the look the features of us amen well if
[1:52:05] it's the nose and the ears and the look
[1:52:07] and the approach and all of those things
[1:52:08] amen that's the same as the father as
[1:52:11] the mother what should it be for the
[1:52:13] sons of the message of this hour amen it
[1:52:16] should be the same purpose the same
[1:52:17] light the same thought the same love the
[1:52:20] same purpose everything the vision all
[1:52:22] of it should be exactly like Father
[1:52:24] Branham was
[1:52:28] you didn't see brother Ben I'm throwing
[1:52:30] people out because he disagreed with him
[1:52:32] the only time brother man was hard on
[1:52:34] people about things is when they
[1:52:35] absolutely became rebellious to the word
[1:52:37] of God
[1:52:38] Rebellion is different
[1:52:40] than disagreement
[1:52:43] even Paul himself said that he had an
[1:52:45] evident pattern in his ministry but the
[1:52:47] man says it's the church age book his
[1:52:49] first his first sign of a god-given
[1:52:51] Ministry was that he was true to the
[1:52:53] word
[1:52:55] he was unorganized and spirit-led
[1:52:59] notice and secondly his ministry was the
[1:53:02] power of the spirit demonstrating not
[1:53:04] only the spoken or the written word but
[1:53:06] the spoken word as well
[1:53:07] and he had evident fruit of a god-given
[1:53:10] Ministry and the prophet of God said
[1:53:12] that every God called ministry will have
[1:53:16] the same thing in them
[1:53:18] somebody tell me how I could have the
[1:53:21] same Ministry of Paul if I don't have
[1:53:24] the same mind as Paul
[1:53:29] so when you see these men preaching and
[1:53:31] all they do is just give a good seminar
[1:53:32] you know right then something is not
[1:53:34] right
[1:53:36] they might be a good person they might
[1:53:37] be a good brother but to be called to
[1:53:39] preach to be stand behind us that's
[1:53:41] right here you've got to have these
[1:53:43] evident things working inside your life
[1:53:46] too many of these guys get behind this
[1:53:48] sacred desk right here and they start
[1:53:49] getting a little favor people like them
[1:53:51] they like what they talk about and all
[1:53:53] of a sudden you watch that person he
[1:53:54] gets him a little group together and he
[1:53:56] starts pulling that group unto himself
[1:53:58] that's a spirit of organization
[1:54:01] listen friend they don't take too much
[1:54:02] discernment to see who's going to preach
[1:54:04] camp meeting sometime who's going to
[1:54:06] preach special meetings it's the same
[1:54:07] people doing the same thing all the same
[1:54:09] time and it's the same bunch of the same
[1:54:11] Ultra doing the same crying and shouting
[1:54:13] that they did the year before that amen
[1:54:15] what is that the spirit of organization
[1:54:20] spontaneous Christian worship not
[1:54:22] manufacturing it
[1:54:28] amen and amen praise the Lord this
[1:54:31] message is not just contained in just a
[1:54:33] few select Ministries
[1:54:36] this is a body working together the body
[1:54:38] of the son of man is made up the
[1:54:40] revelation of the son of man is made up
[1:54:42] of every part working fitly together
[1:54:44] amen without Schism in the body of
[1:54:46] Christ hallelujah amen a housewife could
[1:54:49] have the same vision as a preacher
[1:54:52] matter of fact the prophet of God said
[1:54:54] that a housewife can do more with the
[1:54:55] gospel than a preacher can in the Pulpit
[1:54:57] go look it up that's what he said
[1:55:00] just because you're a preacher don't
[1:55:01] mean nothing
[1:55:02] and the guy is a god you ain't no more
[1:55:04] and a drunk guy saved five minutes ago
[1:55:08] that's right
[1:55:10] oh but how in the world could I ever
[1:55:14] find my place well
[1:55:16] find it in Jesus Christ
[1:55:19] you see if you know that you're a part
[1:55:21] of him then it's up to him to figure out
[1:55:23] where you fit
[1:55:24] I learned a long time ago that I'm not
[1:55:26] the one working this God puzzle
[1:55:29] all the pieces are laying out there and
[1:55:32] all I do is surrender my part to him and
[1:55:34] he knows where I belong in this whole
[1:55:36] puzzle
[1:55:37] if I let him put me in I'll find my
[1:55:39] place somewhere another
[1:55:41] amen and I got news for the devil if God
[1:55:43] ever puts me in ain't nobody can take me
[1:55:46] out
[1:55:48] right same with you nobody can hire you
[1:55:51] nobody can fire you
[1:55:53] amen glory to God once you're fit in the
[1:55:57] body of Christ there is no moving that
[1:55:59] out
[1:56:00] man not enough Devil's out of hell to
[1:56:02] take you out of it
[1:56:03] right
[1:56:05] listen again the prophet says now God
[1:56:07] can bless a man a little bit give him a
[1:56:09] good church
[1:56:10] but he can't be satisfied until he wants
[1:56:12] to be ministered to
[1:56:15] that shows a sign of spiritual sickness
[1:56:18] it's only the feeble that Jesus
[1:56:20] ministered to
[1:56:22] those who desire to be Rabbi doctor
[1:56:24] Reverend all those selfish ungodly
[1:56:28] devilish names he said
[1:56:30] praise God we are brothers we are not of
[1:56:34] this world but that's what people desire
[1:56:37] when they come to a meeting or something
[1:56:39] they walked in with a swelled out chest
[1:56:41] and carry on
[1:56:42] you got to have the very highest
[1:56:44] respects for those people
[1:56:46] says we don't need no respects one for
[1:56:48] another if we want any respects I wanted
[1:56:51] to come from God who gives the true
[1:56:52] respect
[1:56:54] how can you have faith when you seek
[1:56:57] honor one from another
[1:57:03] brother Benham says it's taken it has
[1:57:06] taken the hidden power away from the
[1:57:10] church and it's sapping it away from the
[1:57:12] people why he said we're trying to act
[1:57:14] like the world
[1:57:16] we're not here to compete with the world
[1:57:18] we're here to preach the gospel
[1:57:22] somebody helped me this morning
[1:57:25] amen
[1:57:27] listen
[1:57:28] this is why I stood up here last night
[1:57:31] feeling almost like an orphan at one
[1:57:33] point I couldn't feel where the spirit
[1:57:35] was trying to take us until I got to the
[1:57:37] very end and I told you don't you see
[1:57:38] the Holy Spirit trying to do that no man
[1:57:40] lays his hands on you that you take your
[1:57:43] faith and walk out of here I realize now
[1:57:45] why he was leading us that way he knew I
[1:57:47] was going to bring this this morning and
[1:57:48] I see how it ties in now
[1:57:50] now listen I can't say too much about
[1:57:52] backgrounds of this or that I'm just
[1:57:54] going to say this in a general sense but
[1:57:56] listen we have leaned in this message
[1:57:58] too much to the arm of men of reprobate
[1:58:01] minds or not a reputation I'm trying to
[1:58:03] say amen and we've almost made ourselves
[1:58:05] reprobate I'm trying to say Amen by
[1:58:07] leaning to the arm of celebrities
[1:58:11] just because they're visual just because
[1:58:13] they're on the internet just because
[1:58:14] they got a big church that doesn't mean
[1:58:16] that God looks on them any different
[1:58:18] than he does the little guy back in
[1:58:20] Wyoming that's got about 15 people in
[1:58:22] the church or whatever comes
[1:58:26] God regards and esteems all of us the
[1:58:28] same
[1:58:29] whether it's the little flocking
[1:58:31] Kitchener or whether it's the big one
[1:58:32] over in Vancouver or the one down in
[1:58:35] Tennessee or the one over in Missouri
[1:58:38] God looks at us all the same
[1:58:40] you've heard me say this before but one
[1:58:43] of the things I've always been
[1:58:44] criticized for is they say brother Ben
[1:58:46] what the ministry of the Lords give you
[1:58:48] you go to them little churches I said
[1:58:51] you're crazy how do you think I built
[1:58:52] the ministry
[1:58:54] I didn't build the ministry if I run out
[1:58:56] of these big churches out here I preach
[1:58:58] for every one of them little churches
[1:58:59] nobody wanted to go to
[1:59:02] you know why I did it because Jesus
[1:59:04] didn't call me to preach to a big crowd
[1:59:07] he called me to preach the gospel
[1:59:10] amen be it's a few or be at the midi it
[1:59:12] matters not to me if you see me stand in
[1:59:15] front of five people I preach just like
[1:59:17] this right here
[1:59:19] why because I feel in my heart that the
[1:59:22] purpose of the ministry is to help
[1:59:24] whoever God sets in front of you
[1:59:28] we have such Prestige amongst people you
[1:59:30] know
[1:59:31] they walk around and preachers walk
[1:59:33] around wanting to be ministered to and
[1:59:35] bragged on
[1:59:36] now listen I love for you guys to say
[1:59:38] nice things to me I love to hear you
[1:59:39] people say that you are blessed or
[1:59:41] encouraged by things I preached or
[1:59:43] whatever it may be I love to hear that
[1:59:44] please don't never stop encouraging me
[1:59:46] but remember when it comes to God's
[1:59:49] people we're not to regard one above the
[1:59:51] other
[1:59:54] that is the spirit of denomination
[2:00:01] is that Iran
[2:00:04] one star in the heaven above can't help
[2:00:06] how it's made
[2:00:08] it may not be the North Star it may not
[2:00:10] make up the Big Dipper it may not be a
[2:00:12] part of Orion's belt
[2:00:14] but I'll guarantee if you took all them
[2:00:16] other scars away from Orion's Belt and
[2:00:19] you took all the mother Stars away and
[2:00:20] you had just a Ryan's Belt the big and
[2:00:22] the Little Dipper it would look like a
[2:00:24] pretty empty sky
[2:00:26] and that's what we've done we've taken
[2:00:28] our little shoot guns in the message and
[2:00:29] we my dad just called them shoot guns
[2:00:30] not shotguns we take our little shoot
[2:00:32] guns and we blow out every Star that we
[2:00:34] think don't belong there
[2:00:36] and before long we've just got the
[2:00:37] picture we wanted to create
[2:00:39] but when I look at photos and things on
[2:00:41] the internet of the vast Galaxy and
[2:00:43] those billions of stars I think to
[2:00:45] myself not one of them did God blow off
[2:00:47] the end of his fingers that he ever
[2:00:49] regretted putting there
[2:00:51] every one of them had a purpose to make
[2:00:55] up the family of God
[2:00:58] amen amen he said if one of them got out
[2:01:02] of their order he said throw the whole
[2:01:03] world in chaos
[2:01:06] amen
[2:01:08] science brother Adam said would say that
[2:01:10] those Stars up you understood some of
[2:01:12] you are seeing they burned out years ago
[2:01:15] that might be true Luther served his
[2:01:17] purpose and he went away Wesley served
[2:01:19] his purpose and he went away amen but
[2:01:21] they still made up the body of Christ
[2:01:24] and members said
[2:01:26] friends they coming why would we be if
[2:01:28] there wasn't a Martin Luther
[2:01:30] but if you message people were sitting
[2:01:32] at a table with him and he ordered a
[2:01:33] pint of beer
[2:01:35] rubbed his pipe on his shirt and started
[2:01:37] smoking his pipe telling you how
[2:01:38] Antichrist the Jews were
[2:01:40] what would some of you Believers think
[2:01:42] about a man like that but you know what
[2:01:43] God thought about him God winked at
[2:01:45] their ignorance and he said they don't
[2:01:47] know any better but given time my bride
[2:01:50] will know better than that
[2:01:55] patience
[2:01:57] the god of patience
[2:02:00] oh oh yes
[2:02:03] some big preachers swelling at his chest
[2:02:06] oh that's so and so
[2:02:09] oh that's Dr Reverend
[2:02:15] now you know in this church
[2:02:18] in this church you could be called every
[2:02:20] kind of a name when it comes to being a
[2:02:22] preacher right
[2:02:23] call you minister they call you any kind
[2:02:25] of other thing and you know I appreciate
[2:02:26] people try to show respects but you know
[2:02:29] you can always tell when the idea behind
[2:02:32] that is more about lifting the person up
[2:02:34] rather than the gospel that's being
[2:02:36] preached
[2:02:39] right we don't want that kind of spirit
[2:02:41] honest because remember the Gentile age
[2:02:43] goes out in the worship of Flesh
[2:02:51] amen amen
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:57] brother I said that's what's taken the
[2:02:59] hidden power away from the people
[2:03:01] why because when you start focusing on
[2:03:03] certain parts of the ministry in certain
[2:03:05] areas of the body then you lose sight of
[2:03:07] the rest of them and you know what
[2:03:08] happens when you start losing inside of
[2:03:10] all these other things you can do out
[2:03:12] here
[2:03:13] it's like I had a wife tell me one time
[2:03:15] about her and her husband and you know
[2:03:18] she was always one of these women that
[2:03:19] want to do the big things for the house
[2:03:21] you know organize big parties and
[2:03:23] organize big things you know and stuff
[2:03:25] like that never to do the little simple
[2:03:27] things like the cooking and the cleaning
[2:03:28] and the washing and the whatever more
[2:03:30] like that and she was always wanting to
[2:03:31] do the big stuff and he was getting
[2:03:32] frustrated with her
[2:03:34] I mean he she was a wealthy woman he'd
[2:03:36] come home and she'd have a brand new car
[2:03:37] sitting in the driveway Sam
[2:03:46] I mean she bought it she didn't steal it
[2:03:47] maybe I should clarify that much
[2:03:50] but had all these things going on and
[2:03:52] you know and this man tells me tears in
[2:03:54] his eyes he said I just wish she would
[2:03:56] wash the dishes from time to time
[2:03:58] but to her it was the big things but
[2:04:02] listen what brother Adam said the seals
[2:04:04] he said it's not the big things we try
[2:04:06] to do it's in little things we leave
[2:04:08] undone
[2:04:10] little foxes are what spoils the Vine
[2:04:14] things work a lot better when people
[2:04:16] focus on the little stuff that matters
[2:04:19] you take a small Church you take like
[2:04:21] hear this Sanctuary here I don't know
[2:04:23] how many come brother Dale but I mean
[2:04:25] you you don't have four or five hundred
[2:04:26] sitting here all the time but you know
[2:04:28] people look around at empty pews and
[2:04:29] they get nervous
[2:04:32] where's everybody at why you know well
[2:04:34] something must be wrong with his
[2:04:35] ministry if you don't have a big church
[2:04:38] maybe God didn't call everybody to sit
[2:04:40] under him maybe the 15 that God called
[2:04:43] is the one that God set in there but
[2:04:45] listen those 15 are a part of a greater
[2:04:47] number
[2:04:48] and if you stay focused on your purpose
[2:04:50] God can multiply that 15 to something
[2:04:53] else to something else to something else
[2:04:55] he is still a God that can multiply the
[2:04:58] fishes and the loaves
[2:05:03] but in the idea of it oh to have a
[2:05:06] meeting we've got to have big name brand
[2:05:08] preachers
[2:05:10] my daughter used to tell me that a pair
[2:05:12] of Levi's works the same in the field
[2:05:15] the same as an old
[2:05:18] generic version of pants it's the same
[2:05:20] as the other one does
[2:05:22] they get dirty just the same amen
[2:05:24] American Eagle or Outfitters or Levi or
[2:05:27] or carnhardt or one of those other kind
[2:05:29] of Brands like our brother got there
[2:05:30] amen they all get the same dirt on them
[2:05:33] just the same
[2:05:35] man
[2:05:36] again in spoken word Original Seed now
[2:05:38] listen Brothers said you can only serve
[2:05:40] God and believe the servants that God
[2:05:42] sins and you can only serve God on Earth
[2:05:45] I've read this to you before my word
[2:05:47] again he said that sin on Earth as God's
[2:05:49] servants by divine inspiration interpret
[2:05:52] the word to you so you can only serve
[2:05:54] God as it's divinely interpreted to you
[2:05:57] now what a responsibility Brethren that
[2:05:59] puts on our shoulders to make sure we've
[2:06:01] got the same vision the same mind the
[2:06:04] same purpose the same objectives the
[2:06:06] same goals to deliver it to the body of
[2:06:08] Christ okay take it out of the pulpit
[2:06:10] what about your daddies
[2:06:12] what about you Mom at bedtime
[2:06:14] whenever it's time to read those babies
[2:06:15] stories
[2:06:17] you got to have the same vision that
[2:06:18] comes from the top all the way down in
[2:06:21] order for it to be right with God
[2:06:22] now listen again he says now that's
[2:06:24] what's the matter of the Pentecostal
[2:06:26] church tonight too many differences
[2:06:33] if the church would only be held
[2:06:35] together and quit fussing splitting up
[2:06:38] arguing over a little baptism and things
[2:06:40] should be a lot better off
[2:06:43] One Church against the other that isn't
[2:06:45] Sons
[2:06:47] and God can't trust you
[2:06:51] Divine gifts are very sacred remember a
[2:06:53] person could send their soul to hell
[2:06:55] with one
[2:06:56] which is what Elvis did by the way
[2:07:00] so the prophet is using that in order
[2:07:03] for God to trust us right
[2:07:05] he looks at our Behavior one to another
[2:07:07] as a measuring stick of whether he can
[2:07:09] trust us
[2:07:14] so if I can't trust you and you can't
[2:07:16] trust me
[2:07:17] follow me in tongues and you interpret
[2:07:23] because you get a little feeling in your
[2:07:24] heart glory to God I'm not translating
[2:07:26] that tongue I don't like it God
[2:07:30] why would you prophesy to a bunch of
[2:07:32] people you don't like
[2:07:34] whoa all this Church's getting quiet on
[2:07:36] me
[2:07:39] right it's the truth anyways
[2:07:41] right God wants us to stay in harmony so
[2:07:44] we can show that we do you know the
[2:07:46] prophet of God said he would rather you
[2:07:47] love one another than even love him
[2:07:50] towards it
[2:07:51] again he said today the church the
[2:07:53] reason it's in the condition you want a
[2:07:56] big class in your church
[2:07:58] you failed the church is failing to get
[2:08:00] the prostitute the street walker The
[2:08:03] Bootlegger and what there is with the
[2:08:05] city but that's where Jesus wants us to
[2:08:08] go
[2:08:10] but you see the kind of model ideal
[2:08:13] message person member of the church that
[2:08:15] we want we want somebody that was either
[2:08:17] raised in the message and backslid from
[2:08:18] it or somebody that was around the truth
[2:08:20] for a long time we don't want them
[2:08:22] people that are brand spanking new don't
[2:08:24] even understand the word prayer
[2:08:30] we don't want them people that have no
[2:08:32] clue how to dress or walk or talk and we
[2:08:36] almost get offended when somebody comes
[2:08:38] into the church that has no idea we
[2:08:40] almost look at them well don't you know
[2:08:41] what brother said no
[2:08:43] they don't
[2:08:48] and neither did you before you knew what
[2:08:50] you knew
[2:08:52] come on preach to me now
[2:08:54] God doesn't want us to have this
[2:08:56] all-powerful Elite attitude
[2:09:01] he wants us to be so flexible that if
[2:09:04] we're talking to somebody that don't
[2:09:05] know
[2:09:06] we can come right down to where they are
[2:09:10] and talk the same languages
[2:09:15] amen
[2:09:17] to be able to talk the same language as
[2:09:19] The Bootlegger talk the same language as
[2:09:21] the street walker and get right down in
[2:09:23] their world to be able to have the same
[2:09:25] mind as them
[2:09:32] I've known of people that will get out
[2:09:34] and witness to people saying brother REM
[2:09:35] said I
[2:09:39] understand that they have no idea what
[2:09:41] you're talking about
[2:09:45] it'd be like if you're an engineer
[2:09:47] and you come and explain something to me
[2:09:49] about one of your machines
[2:09:53] I am not a mechanical person I'm going
[2:09:55] to smile I'm going to nod my head but
[2:09:58] know right now I have no idea what
[2:10:00] you're talking about
[2:10:06] I still measure like this twelve and two
[2:10:09] points
[2:10:13] Sam and I was doing some work in the
[2:10:15] house I was cutting some trims she said
[2:10:16] what is it I said 12 and three marks
[2:10:21] I've been a musician my whole life I
[2:10:23] don't know much of that stuff we wasn't
[2:10:25] even allowed to use our hands for
[2:10:26] anything but the piano when I was a kid
[2:10:29] my mother almost had heart failure the
[2:10:30] first time I tried to have my help my
[2:10:32] dad change the brakes on his car
[2:10:35] you know it was just the way it was in
[2:10:37] our home
[2:10:38] so there's a lot of things I don't
[2:10:39] understand so if you talk to me about
[2:10:42] super inflated economics or whatever huh
[2:10:45] what
[2:10:47] inside outside only going wow that's
[2:10:49] interesting man huh I didn't know that
[2:10:53] is that what they say wow
[2:10:56] I'm going to be sweet with you but
[2:10:58] sometimes I don't have no clue what
[2:10:59] you're talking about
[2:11:00] neither does the outside world when you
[2:11:03] try to bring them deep Revelations of
[2:11:04] God that come from the inner Veil and
[2:11:07] bring them to the outer cord and try to
[2:11:09] lead them to Jesus Christ
[2:11:11] amen how about just help them understand
[2:11:13] that the Bible is an infallible book how
[2:11:16] about uh just understand that Jesus
[2:11:18] loves them no matter what their
[2:11:19] background is help them understand no
[2:11:22] matter where they came from God is still
[2:11:24] a lover of Souls
[2:11:28] and if we'll have that kind of Mercy on
[2:11:30] those in the outside world what about
[2:11:32] those in the church that have come from
[2:11:33] backgrounds that they don't understand
[2:11:35] things either
[2:11:37] everybody's got baggage
[2:11:40] I said everybody's got baggage
[2:11:44] and we have to be patient one with
[2:11:46] another
[2:11:47] amen labor with one another support one
[2:11:50] another amen
[2:11:52] oh hey man and amen
[2:11:55] he said that's where he desires us to
[2:11:58] bring them in but we want the guy that's
[2:11:59] got money
[2:12:01] that can pay the best and pay off the
[2:12:04] church debts and things
[2:12:06] you call it the Upper Crust
[2:12:09] there's a lot of crust to it he says
[2:12:12] that's right he said I don't know how
[2:12:13] much upper it is but a lot of crust but
[2:12:16] we must go to the hedges highways byways
[2:12:18] and compel them to come to Christ
[2:12:20] the outcast
[2:12:24] that even includes people in this
[2:12:26] message that have been outcast
[2:12:30] and the pergament church Age The Prophet
[2:12:32] said these early Bishops thought
[2:12:34] they were above the word
[2:12:38] that's what some preachers are they try
[2:12:40] to take brother Ram's message to take
[2:12:41] the Bible and they try to interpret it
[2:12:43] for the People based on what they think
[2:12:46] now if we're going to preach the gospel
[2:12:48] if we're going to take this word and
[2:12:49] share it with somebody else we must
[2:12:51] always remember to subjugate ourselves
[2:12:53] to the star of the age
[2:12:54] brother I wasn't just a prophet he
[2:12:56] wasn't just a teacher he wasn't just an
[2:12:58] apostle an evangelist or he wasn't just
[2:13:00] a pastor brother Branham was the star of
[2:13:02] the age and before anything else falls
[2:13:05] down beneath that star that star is the
[2:13:08] voice of God it is the he the he the one
[2:13:11] he that heard the voice of the spirit is
[2:13:14] that star of the age and what God did
[2:13:16] with him after that whatever gift he put
[2:13:18] him out to that fine but is the man that
[2:13:20] God called first and foremost I don't
[2:13:23] have an opinion about his opinion
[2:13:27] if he said it one way say it just like
[2:13:29] he said it
[2:13:30] repeat it just as he said it if he said
[2:13:33] he messed up on it then say it that way
[2:13:35] amen amen amen
[2:13:38] but too many times we try to twist the
[2:13:40] message to fit
[2:13:43] a denominational taste
[2:13:47] and the only way you can keep this
[2:13:48] message straight keep the thinking man's
[2:13:50] filter on him
[2:13:55] it'll draw in the life of God
[2:13:57] you'll draw in the Holy Ghost
[2:14:01] if you keep the right filter on us
[2:14:04] praise be to God
[2:14:07] where are we at now in this particular
[2:14:10] age this time we're in where are we at
[2:14:12] it's like this
[2:14:14] the further we get in time remember
[2:14:16] Jesus said that there would be an hour
[2:14:18] that would be called the delay
[2:14:20] and in the time of the delay
[2:14:23] that would be the moment
[2:14:24] brother would be against brother Mother
[2:14:27] against daughter daughter against father
[2:14:29] father against son
[2:14:31] people started fussing and fighting
[2:14:33] abusing Servants of God
[2:14:35] my Lord de laeth his coming
[2:14:38] the attitude changes quickly
[2:14:41] whenever we get to this spot to where
[2:14:43] we're not sure if Jesus is coming now or
[2:14:45] 40 years from now
[2:14:47] I know some of you might be thinking oh
[2:14:49] he's going to come any moment we're too
[2:14:51] late you don't know that neither do I
[2:14:53] there might be these boys or old men
[2:14:55] before Jesus comes
[2:14:58] we don't know that little girl out there
[2:14:59] could be married and have 10 grandkids
[2:15:01] of her own before Jesus decides to come
[2:15:03] back
[2:15:03] sorry Grandpa
[2:15:06] we don't know how long it's going to
[2:15:08] take
[2:15:09] but we do know this one thing that in
[2:15:12] the time of testing like this this is
[2:15:15] not the time to turn our guns one on
[2:15:16] another
[2:15:19] folks do you understand that that
[2:15:20] believe the sign group out there and
[2:15:22] John Collins and all these critics out
[2:15:23] there you know the one bit of ammunition
[2:15:25] they use against us all the time that we
[2:15:27] are not Unified
[2:15:30] it's the one thing they've got that
[2:15:32] they're absolutely right about we are
[2:15:34] not unified like we should be
[2:15:37] and I know we get this idea well I've
[2:15:39] got to stand for my principles do that
[2:15:41] in the backyard but when it comes to the
[2:15:43] front yard link arms with your brother
[2:15:45] and say we are together in this fight
[2:15:49] that's the way God wants it
[2:15:53] and then when you get to the backyard
[2:15:54] pound it out
[2:15:57] bring your quotes and all your histories
[2:15:58] and your scriptures and everything and
[2:16:00] dig in there and find out what's truth
[2:16:03] but when it comes to the public View
[2:16:05] what do people see out of us they should
[2:16:08] see a group completely Unified
[2:16:11] anointed together in the spirit
[2:16:13] last statement we're going to close in
[2:16:15] the book of Acts the Bible said before
[2:16:17] the Holy Ghost listen these are the
[2:16:19] first people in all of history in all of
[2:16:22] creation these were the first people to
[2:16:25] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:27] God was going to indwell a human heart
[2:16:29] for the first time in four thousand
[2:16:31] years of man's history and before God
[2:16:34] fed him of the Holy Ghost it said they
[2:16:37] were in one mind
[2:16:38] and one Accord
[2:16:40] and suddenly there came a sound from
[2:16:42] heaven
[2:16:44] as a Russian Mighty Wind
[2:16:47] like how it is in a marriage
[2:16:50] you all just been married for a length
[2:16:51] of time you know how it is you fuss over
[2:16:53] the stupidest things sometimes
[2:16:55] you know I I got two girls now right and
[2:16:58] Sam and I oh God the fights we've had
[2:17:01] through the years we've had some good
[2:17:03] ones ain't we baby
[2:17:06] we've had some we've had some excellent
[2:17:08] fights we've had some fights that should
[2:17:10] go down in wrestling and boxing and MMA
[2:17:12] history
[2:17:14] babies of the family always wanting our
[2:17:16] way one little brat wanting our way
[2:17:19] we've had some knock down dry gas in our
[2:17:21] time
[2:17:22] but that's in the backyard
[2:17:25] in the front yard nobody better food
[2:17:26] with her
[2:17:27] that's my sister
[2:17:29] I'm her brother
[2:17:31] and man just like with our children our
[2:17:33] girls you know how kids are I got some
[2:17:35] good girls but sometimes they get that
[2:17:37] little thing on they want to try to play
[2:17:38] mommy and daddy
[2:17:39] you know we've won we've always been
[2:17:41] Unified
[2:17:43] we've always stood together in the front
[2:17:45] yard it's always been her and I standing
[2:17:47] together on a principle of the truth
[2:17:49] people respect you even though they know
[2:17:52] you disagree they will respect you if
[2:17:55] you show that courtesy and that
[2:17:56] confidence one to another
[2:17:59] amen and her and I you know we were kids
[2:18:01] when we got married Lord I was just
[2:18:03] barely 21 and she just turned 19 and we
[2:18:06] got married let me tell you something I
[2:18:08] believe in getting married as young as
[2:18:10] you could possibly get married I mean as
[2:18:11] far as like you know don't wait till
[2:18:13] like 40 or 50 or 16 get married you get
[2:18:16] married early get married
[2:18:18] you know I mean if you're 40 or 50
[2:18:20] that's fine too but you know
[2:18:22] it actually helps you if you start in
[2:18:25] the beginning that way you can get all
[2:18:26] that child stuff worked out before you
[2:18:28] start growing up a little bit
[2:18:31] amen because I'm a powder
[2:18:34] I know you don't believe that do you
[2:18:36] I'm a powder I don't get my way I pout
[2:18:40] I roll that lip out about halfway down
[2:18:42] in my belly
[2:18:43] I sit over in a corner and I pout
[2:18:46] Samantha say what's the matter with you
[2:18:47] as I'd tell you if I wasn't pouting
[2:18:54] that's in the backyard
[2:18:57] but when it comes to the front yard
[2:19:00] they're not another wing woman that I
[2:19:02] wanted my sign
[2:19:04] then my partner in crime back there
[2:19:08] why
[2:19:09] that's the kind of love that we've got
[2:19:11] to have one for another
[2:19:14] we're always going to be sanding one
[2:19:15] another don't forget the Bible said
[2:19:17] steal on steel will sharpen your brother
[2:19:19] you're always going to be striking them
[2:19:20] spots where you don't always agree
[2:19:23] but remember that the attitude of a
[2:19:25] Christian to be like-minded before we go
[2:19:28] out of here in the Rapture means that we
[2:19:29] may not see that eye but we have to have
[2:19:31] the same purpose and the same vision
[2:19:34] we're all trying to get to the same
[2:19:36] place I was singing about a minute ago
[2:19:38] we're all trying to get to that Heavenly
[2:19:40] home
[2:19:42] we want to lift each other up
[2:19:44] and bring each other to a place to where
[2:19:46] that if you see one down
[2:19:48] do you know that in geese Canadian geese
[2:19:52] do you know when they fly in that
[2:19:54] formation you know that V style the guy
[2:19:57] up here in the front here they're always
[2:19:59] switching around
[2:20:00] they let somebody else have the lead
[2:20:02] constantly to arrest each other and do
[2:20:04] you know that if a goose if it gets hurt
[2:20:06] one Goose will stay back with it until
[2:20:09] it gets where it can go on again and
[2:20:11] then they'll both go together when it's
[2:20:13] well and they'll join the formation
[2:20:14] again
[2:20:15] Hallelujah
[2:20:17] that's the way it is with the little
[2:20:18] eaglets when they get down and they get
[2:20:20] in that molten period where they get
[2:20:21] crusted over those great Eagles up there
[2:20:23] some of them Elder Eagles maybe will
[2:20:25] take that little bits of meat and things
[2:20:28] and we'll drop it down to them little
[2:20:29] ones and they'll come over there and
[2:20:31] they'll pull themselves over and suck
[2:20:32] the blood out of that meat until they
[2:20:34] start getting strength and then they'll
[2:20:36] climb themselves way up high on a rock
[2:20:38] and start beating the crust out has
[2:20:40] formed over their eyes and over their
[2:20:42] wings and they the ones that have the
[2:20:44] strength they they show favor they they
[2:20:48] they give their life they they they baby
[2:20:51] almost in a way of saying they go back
[2:20:52] and watch over them weaker ones until
[2:20:55] they get strength to be able to go home
[2:20:58] oh God how much more should the Bride of
[2:21:02] Jesus Christ with the holy ghost in my
[2:21:05] heart how much more if I see you in
[2:21:07] trouble should I stop what I'm doing and
[2:21:10] work with you until the Holy Ghost can
[2:21:12] bring you back up
[2:21:15] amen amen amen amen amen amen
[2:21:21] too often we just go on about our
[2:21:23] business
[2:21:24] out of sight out of mind it's not my
[2:21:26] problem let everybody work out their own
[2:21:28] things but today what Paul said let
[2:21:31] every mind every man be mindful and mind
[2:21:34] the things of others in other words not
[2:21:36] nosy not in your business
[2:21:38] but be conscious that you may need help
[2:21:41] you you know to me one of the saddest
[2:21:44] things in our churches is to hear people
[2:21:47] backsliding committing suicide getting
[2:21:50] caught in adulteries and then you'd ask
[2:21:53] around about how did this happen well we
[2:21:55] never knew
[2:21:56] you mean to tell me you went to church
[2:21:58] or that person for six months a year 12
[2:22:00] years 10 years and you didn't see signs
[2:22:03] that they were in trouble you know why
[2:22:05] we didn't see it we don't care about
[2:22:07] each other like we should
[2:22:09] we figure like Americans everybody
[2:22:12] should do their own thing and we'll
[2:22:13] worry about us you worry about you
[2:22:16] but if I'm called of God that ain't the
[2:22:18] way
[2:22:19] even if I if you're good enough to hide
[2:22:22] it I should have enough relationship
[2:22:24] with God until I should feel that little
[2:22:26] funny something moving down in my heart
[2:22:28] something ain't right there I need to
[2:22:30] keep my finger on that
[2:22:33] being sensitive to the Holy Ghost
[2:22:36] I know it's going to happen anyways but
[2:22:37] it we should never allow somebody to
[2:22:40] ever commit suicide in this message we
[2:22:42] should never let nobody split their
[2:22:44] marriages up we should never let these
[2:22:46] kids walk off to the world
[2:22:48] if we do it it's our failure we can't
[2:22:51] blame the Bergens we can't blame the
[2:22:53] Collins this we can't blame vgr we can't
[2:22:56] blame the preachers we think are
[2:22:57] responsible we can't blame the church we
[2:23:00] can only blame ourselves if we're not
[2:23:02] conscious of what God's doing or what
[2:23:03] the devil is doing amongst us
[2:23:07] the prophet of God said the Bride of
[2:23:08] this last day brother the man he said
[2:23:10] she'll have the right Spirit to discern
[2:23:14] and withstand
[2:23:17] the Antichrist Spirit amongst the people
[2:23:21] how many times
[2:23:23] that I I've I've pulled people to the
[2:23:25] side be women sometimes I grabbed my
[2:23:27] wife or my brother-in-law or somebody
[2:23:29] there and I pull that sister to the side
[2:23:30] and I say hey something's going on with
[2:23:33] you what's up
[2:23:34] oh nothing oh no I said sister
[2:23:37] the Holy Ghost is showing me something's
[2:23:39] wrong
[2:23:41] and to see many times I've lost count
[2:23:43] Tears start flowing from their eyes
[2:23:46] their bottom lips are quivering they're
[2:23:48] losing their breath hyperventilating
[2:23:49] brother Ben how did you know it wasn't
[2:23:50] me the new God was showing me because I
[2:23:52] care for you
[2:23:54] how can I help you I'm here as your
[2:23:56] brother
[2:23:58] had a brother just the other day going
[2:24:00] through a hard hard thing nobody knows
[2:24:02] my wife don't even know this I picked up
[2:24:04] the phone and I rang him on the phone
[2:24:05] and I said buddy what's going on with
[2:24:07] you
[2:24:08] he said what do you mean I said I'm
[2:24:09] telling you right now don't you lie to
[2:24:11] me what's going on with you
[2:24:14] all of a sudden I heard the other side
[2:24:16] of the phone
[2:24:20] wife leaving him this is happening
[2:24:21] that's happening talk to me
[2:24:24] I'm here
[2:24:25] I'm so glad you called he said I told
[2:24:28] the Lord a few more days I'm going to
[2:24:29] kill myself
[2:24:31] but being sensitive
[2:24:33] being concerned for one another
[2:24:36] will bring us in such Unity
[2:24:41] that pyramid
[2:24:42] that one
[2:24:44] is supposed to be so fitly put together
[2:24:46] to you can't razor blade in between
[2:24:51] you say you're preaching stuff that
[2:24:53] ain't important hold on you hold your
[2:24:55] tongue the prophet of God said without
[2:24:58] perfect love we will never enter that
[2:25:02] place thus saith the Lord it'll take
[2:25:06] perfect love to put you there
[2:25:09] what is the Capstone tell me tell me
[2:25:13] before we get to the Capstone what's
[2:25:16] that next step before we're capped off
[2:25:17] brotherly kindness
[2:25:21] by this shall all men know you're my
[2:25:24] disciples
[2:25:26] Hallelujah
[2:25:30] one form
[2:25:34] why do people get in trouble in our
[2:25:36] churches and we have such little
[2:25:37] discernment
[2:25:39] that when they backslid on God when they
[2:25:42] quit the church altogether
[2:25:44] we see them come in and out of church
[2:25:45] and they maybe go hide in the back or
[2:25:48] they leave before the preaching is over
[2:25:50] with or they sit there with their head
[2:25:51] down not participating
[2:25:53] we sit over in a corner and we talk to
[2:25:55] 12 people about how awful it is and how
[2:25:57] frustrated we are and we don't know what
[2:25:58] to do with them I'll tell you what we do
[2:26:00] make a circle of Love around them
[2:26:04] get some brothers and sisters together
[2:26:06] and put a hedge around them and say we
[2:26:08] know something's going on but we want
[2:26:09] you to know as a body we love you how
[2:26:11] can we help you
[2:26:13] they may absolutely reject you but
[2:26:16] they'll never forget you're there
[2:26:19] hey
[2:26:26] with bomb and Gilead
[2:26:28] amen if that don't pin it down I don't
[2:26:31] know what does
[2:26:35] all of us have those secret things
[2:26:38] all of us me too
[2:26:40] we all have those little secret Parts in
[2:26:42] US that we don't want nobody to know
[2:26:45] God is such a gentleman that he won't
[2:26:47] always reveal things like that to people
[2:26:50] but there is a reason brother sister
[2:26:52] that the Bible said you that are
[2:26:54] spiritual when you see a brother
[2:26:56] overtaken in a phone go to him
[2:27:00] this is not church discipline
[2:27:02] this is a brother
[2:27:04] as a sister in love
[2:27:06] it isn't a if he don't hear you take
[2:27:08] another one with you no no no no
[2:27:10] this is sitting down with your hand open
[2:27:13] your heart open
[2:27:14] how can I help you
[2:27:18] 20 percent if I could even call a number
[2:27:21] I probably shouldn't even call a number
[2:27:22] but I have to give some kind of a model
[2:27:25] of this
[2:27:26] or it won't make sense
[2:27:28] 20 of the New Testament as Doctrine will
[2:27:30] say
[2:27:31] the rest of it
[2:27:33] is about how to live
[2:27:35] how to treat one another
[2:27:37] you look at Paul's writings what they
[2:27:39] call the Pauline Gospels
[2:27:40] Paul will start Ephesians chapter one
[2:27:42] you're sitting in Heavenly places Christ
[2:27:44] Jesus predestinated unto a holy walk
[2:27:46] predestinated in Christ Jesus you were
[2:27:49] after heard the word of Truth sealed by
[2:27:51] the Holy Spirit Promise chapter 2 3 4
[2:27:53] and 5. he starts dealing with the family
[2:27:55] loving one another putting away malice
[2:27:57] getting rid of Envy getting rid of
[2:27:59] bitterness How To Be Wondering uh
[2:28:01] husbands love your wives as Christ love
[2:28:03] the church like last night Christ you
[2:28:05] know loved and gave himself for the body
[2:28:09] Galatians chapter 4 when Paul makes that
[2:28:11] great statement about you are sealed
[2:28:13] with the Holy Spirit promise unto the
[2:28:14] daily Redemption go back and read them
[2:28:15] other verses leading up to it and after
[2:28:17] that but let all evil speak let all
[2:28:19] clamor let all filthiness and
[2:28:21] fornication let all evil speak let all
[2:28:23] of that be put away from you and love
[2:28:26] one another
[2:28:27] John the great disciple amen went away
[2:28:31] in his 90s
[2:28:32] and he got to where he couldn't preach
[2:28:34] brother Jose and the only thing they
[2:28:36] could do was set him down in a chair
[2:28:38] they said they put him in a chair and
[2:28:39] he'd lean up against the wall and he'd
[2:28:40] holler little children love one another
[2:28:43] little children love one another
[2:28:47] I figure a man that had the Revelation
[2:28:50] The Book of Revelation revealed to him
[2:28:52] probably had a little understanding
[2:28:54] about what it meant to be in love
[2:28:57] hallelujah amen
[2:29:00] we don't understand maybe the power of
[2:29:02] it but let me give you a small example
[2:29:04] of it
[2:29:05] brother Branham is out hunting with
[2:29:07] lizard eyes
[2:29:09] and all he saw was the love of a mother
[2:29:11] dear
[2:29:12] go out and give its life for its baby
[2:29:15] brother man said I turned my head and
[2:29:17] waited for that shot to go obviously I
[2:29:19] looked around he was shaking like that
[2:29:20] he said bill I can't take it no more
[2:29:22] lead me to that Jesus you've been
[2:29:23] talking about
[2:29:26] I don't mind telling you the one thing
[2:29:28] we've forgotten in all of our doctrines
[2:29:30] and all of our Prestige and all of our
[2:29:32] eliteness and all of our live streaming
[2:29:34] and all of our big fancy doctors and
[2:29:36] this that and the other all of our big
[2:29:37] reverends and so we have forgotten one
[2:29:39] thing the purpose of this message was to
[2:29:41] fall in love with Jesus Christ the end
[2:29:44] in the story don't pass go don't go any
[2:29:47] farther fall in love with Jesus that's
[2:29:49] the main objective of this message
[2:29:52] brother Branham did not come so we'd
[2:29:54] fall in love with him he came so we
[2:29:56] would fall in love with Christ
[2:29:59] amen amen amen
[2:30:03] your whole purpose in life is one thing
[2:30:07] entertained Jesus Christ
[2:30:11] and if I love him
[2:30:13] how'd John say
[2:30:15] if you say you love God
[2:30:17] and hates your brother
[2:30:19] you're still in darkness
[2:30:21] for he that says he loves God and hates
[2:30:24] his brother is a liar
[2:30:28] and the truth is not any
[2:30:30] not of Cain who is of that Wicked one
[2:30:33] who had that lady of sin attitude
[2:30:36] am I My Brother's Keeper
[2:30:39] well as a matter of fact Big Mouth the
[2:30:42] answer to that is yes
[2:30:44] you are
[2:30:45] and God required his hand at taking
[2:30:48] Abel's life
[2:30:50] set a mark on that boy I'd never go well
[2:30:53] here we are six thousand years later and
[2:30:55] that same Mark is falling all the way
[2:30:57] through here to the end time
[2:30:59] the sword never left his house because
[2:31:01] why not because of worship not because
[2:31:04] of preaching not because of a beautiful
[2:31:06] church or a beautiful order but how he
[2:31:08] felt about his brother
[2:31:10] oh God I wish somebody would hear me
[2:31:11] right now
[2:31:13] this is the thing God wants out of us
[2:31:15] right now this is the next step for us
[2:31:17] here in this province
[2:31:20] is to start opening our hearts more to
[2:31:22] those around us
[2:31:24] how do we not know that the person in
[2:31:26] your community that you go to that bank
[2:31:28] every day and you see on a daily basis
[2:31:30] how do you know that they're not going
[2:31:31] through some of the hardest things
[2:31:32] you've ever seen
[2:31:34] and all it's going to take is maybe you
[2:31:36] meeting another brother in the bank and
[2:31:38] you guys start talking and they see the
[2:31:40] love between you two and they think I
[2:31:42] want that
[2:31:47] sisters forgive me for this but the
[2:31:48] gospel is more than long hair and long
[2:31:50] dresses
[2:31:52] the gospel is being able to project
[2:31:54] thank God for your Holiness but the
[2:31:57] gospel is being able to project that
[2:31:59] kind of feeling toward Humanity
[2:32:01] Jesus said the love of many would wax
[2:32:04] cold
[2:32:05] right
[2:32:06] the only love he said in the last day
[2:32:09] would be between the elected
[2:32:12] that's the only love it's going to be
[2:32:14] left
[2:32:16] and the only way that you're ever going
[2:32:17] to make the great is a Christian
[2:32:19] as if this mind purpose love feeling
[2:32:22] toward Humanity feeling towards your
[2:32:24] brother if that dwells in you
[2:32:28] this is the state
[2:32:30] the bride will be in
[2:32:31] before the Rapture comes
[2:32:35] so if you've got anything in your heart
[2:32:36] in any way shape form or fashion you
[2:32:38] know brother Brian told Perry green
[2:32:40] they were measuring a
[2:32:42] I think it was the bullet counts or the
[2:32:45] gunpowder I guess I suppose had a scale
[2:32:47] that was so sensitive that even a little
[2:32:50] scratch with a pencil across a piece of
[2:32:52] paper or just a light little scratch
[2:32:53] would measure it to some degree
[2:32:55] and brother Branham told Brother Perry
[2:32:57] he put a little tiny scratch on that
[2:32:59] thing so light you barely even see it he
[2:33:00] laid it on there on that scale measured
[2:33:02] it he said see brother Perry not even a
[2:33:04] scratch
[2:33:05] will allow you to go into that place
[2:33:09] and yet we have such anger and
[2:33:11] bitterness and history
[2:33:14] let me tell you about your history
[2:33:16] on your web browser
[2:33:18] when you go into your computer
[2:33:20] Google you know Google is a doctor he's
[2:33:23] a pharmacist he's a he's a politician uh
[2:33:26] he's a lot of things Mr Google is a
[2:33:28] smart guy he got degrees lined all the
[2:33:31] way out the wall this guy he's a smart
[2:33:32] fella he knows mathematics he knows
[2:33:34] everything except for
[2:33:37] well
[2:33:38] how to get the Holy Ghost I haven't been
[2:33:39] able to find him preaching that one yet
[2:33:43] but you can go on there and you can say
[2:33:45] all right maybe a computer getting
[2:33:47] bogged down a little bit and you got a
[2:33:48] big bunch of stuff in there and you know
[2:33:50] all of your recipe hunting and all this
[2:33:52] kind of stuff you know and somebody said
[2:33:54] man it's a slow clean out that browser
[2:33:58] you pull up that little thing on Google
[2:34:00] and it says when how far do you want to
[2:34:02] go back I like that little button that
[2:34:04] says from the beginning of time
[2:34:11] and all I got to do is go
[2:34:13] and it will start erasing
[2:34:18] I wonder what some of you all are doing
[2:34:20] holding things against one another
[2:34:23] holding feelings and memories in your
[2:34:25] heart against things in the past
[2:34:28] maybe what you need to do is stop
[2:34:29] clicking two days ago 10 years ago 20
[2:34:33] years ago
[2:34:35] maybe what you need to do is get the
[2:34:37] Holy Ghost gumption to click
[2:34:39] from the beginning of time
[2:34:46] if we draw lines in the sand and hold
[2:34:48] things against each other tell me where
[2:34:49] where does that end where
[2:34:51] is the stop to that you hold even a
[2:34:54] scratch against somebody that scratch
[2:34:56] will multiply and replenish itself
[2:34:59] I'll never have confidence I'll never
[2:35:01] believe why because you've been so
[2:35:02] perfect
[2:35:04] I'll never trust why because you've had
[2:35:06] everything right
[2:35:07] oh
[2:35:08] oh amen you don't have an a man tape in
[2:35:12] here do you where we could hit the amens
[2:35:14] Amy play the amen tape for me
[2:35:21] I'm saying this to you in the name of
[2:35:22] the Lord Canada not even a scratch
[2:35:25] will allow you in an entrance into that
[2:35:27] place
[2:35:28] whatever you got in your heart
[2:35:31] you better remember that we are all
[2:35:32] growing and transitioning we've all made
[2:35:35] our mistakes and we've all done our
[2:35:36] stupids
[2:35:38] cut off somebody preach to me we've all
[2:35:41] had errors and misgivings in our life
[2:35:44] times we were misguided and even
[2:35:46] deceived for a moment of time
[2:35:49] but God who is faithful
[2:35:51] you're sitting here today why are you
[2:35:52] sitting here today because you're still
[2:35:54] moving in transition
[2:35:55] you're growing you're learning you're
[2:35:57] developing you're taking steps forward
[2:35:58] you're becoming a better Christian a
[2:36:00] better Pastor a better Minister better
[2:36:01] wife better husband whatever it may be
[2:36:03] you're moving on in God's grace
[2:36:05] and if we don't have that feeling of one
[2:36:07] another Grace and transition
[2:36:10] let me tell you what the Bible said
[2:36:12] Jesus said there was a parable one time
[2:36:14] of a man that he had kind of like a
[2:36:18] maybe a little small debt I think one
[2:36:19] time I looked it up and it was like
[2:36:20] maybe 50 U.S
[2:36:23] and the man went over to him and
[2:36:24] demanded it of him he wouldn't you know
[2:36:26] he beat him and threw him in jail and
[2:36:27] all kinds of stuff
[2:36:29] this other guy and I think I looked this
[2:36:31] up if I remember correctly I've got it
[2:36:32] on my notes I'd have to look maybe to
[2:36:33] get it exact but it's like some 40
[2:36:35] billion dollars Jesus uses the example
[2:36:38] and he said not fella come before the
[2:36:40] unjust judge
[2:36:42] and he said
[2:36:43] I'm going to forgive you of that
[2:36:46] he said but you didn't forgive this guy
[2:36:48] over here
[2:36:49] so how am I going to forgive you of this
[2:36:51] right here
[2:36:52] he said whenever he owed him he said he
[2:36:54] took him by the throat
[2:36:56] and said pay me what you owe
[2:36:59] and Jesus used this as an example
[2:37:02] that no matter what your brother does or
[2:37:04] sister does
[2:37:06] don't hold debts against them
[2:37:08] don't hold things against them don't
[2:37:10] hold debts in your heart
[2:37:13] forgive them
[2:37:15] forgive them for everything they may
[2:37:17] have said or done you don't know what
[2:37:22] history in their browser caused them to
[2:37:25] do it
[2:37:27] complexes abuses living with narcissists
[2:37:31] living with fears maybe being beaten
[2:37:34] maybe being dominated maybe being
[2:37:36] micromanaged maybe being lied to maybe
[2:37:39] being deceived or maybe they just had an
[2:37:40] old evil spirit on them
[2:37:42] you don't know what's in somebody's
[2:37:44] history
[2:37:46] and why they choose to do what they do
[2:37:48] and thank God we're not the judge of
[2:37:49] that because we'd be in a bigger mess
[2:37:51] than we are right now
[2:37:53] come on somebody preached to me
[2:37:55] I'm trying to wind it down but I'm going
[2:37:57] to stop when the Holy Ghost tells me to
[2:37:58] you just hang in there with me
[2:38:01] because I feel the Holy Ghost has been
[2:38:03] expressingly very poignant about this
[2:38:05] this weekend let me tell you I had no
[2:38:07] intention of taking these quotes this
[2:38:09] direction but here we are good bad or
[2:38:12] ugly here it is this is what God's time
[2:38:13] to say to us
[2:38:15] and we need to follow the moves of the
[2:38:17] Holy Spirit
[2:38:18] and you precious people anytime the
[2:38:20] Lord's ever used me to speak like this
[2:38:22] to you you have obeyed those words of
[2:38:24] God and you've marched on with them I
[2:38:26] compel you to listen to the holy spirit
[2:38:27] this morning and let God let all of you
[2:38:29] turn a corner and move into higher
[2:38:31] Heights and deeper depths
[2:38:34] I met a person many years ago that
[2:38:37] they were the most ridiculous human
[2:38:38] being they made the stupidest decisions
[2:38:41] I used to think man oh man this guy what
[2:38:44] is a matter to get a little frustrated I
[2:38:46] I say why
[2:38:48] do you do what you do
[2:38:50] just ridiculous stuff extend it for an
[2:38:52] hour and tell you some other foolishness
[2:38:54] I saw this guy
[2:38:55] one day we were sitting in the back of a
[2:38:57] pickup truck
[2:38:59] I've been out working with him we got
[2:39:01] went by to Sonic it's one of these
[2:39:02] little drive-ins back home we got a big
[2:39:04] old drink like this and we were sitting
[2:39:06] back here in the back of the truck
[2:39:06] talking
[2:39:08] and all at once he started weeping
[2:39:12] at 10 years old he was molested by a
[2:39:15] cousin
[2:39:16] a knife held to his throat a gun put to
[2:39:18] his head and made to perform sexual acts
[2:39:21] his daddy was so abusive to him that one
[2:39:24] day as a little boy six like this little
[2:39:26] fella right here put his hands into the
[2:39:28] trunk to try to help Daddy get some
[2:39:30] groceries out and he slammed the trunk
[2:39:32] down on his fingers
[2:39:34] and when this boy started crying mama
[2:39:36] said get him out of there get him out of
[2:39:38] there and his dad said it serves him
[2:39:39] right for putting his hands where he
[2:39:40] didn't belong and walked off
[2:39:42] this guy spent two hours brother Gord
[2:39:44] telling me most horrific things I've
[2:39:46] ever heard in my life out of one human
[2:39:47] being's life
[2:39:49] and I've been around the world and I've
[2:39:50] preached to thousands of people I've
[2:39:52] never heard a story as rough and as hard
[2:39:53] as this kid was
[2:39:55] and then he's dyslexic he's got ADHD
[2:39:58] he's got all kinds of other little
[2:40:00] complexes he's got childhood PTSD he's
[2:40:03] got adult PTSD
[2:40:06] and when he told me his story I began to
[2:40:08] understand
[2:40:10] that was what was motivating
[2:40:13] all of the decisions he'd made in time
[2:40:16] I felt like an absolute scumbag
[2:40:21] and I promised God on that place
[2:40:24] I'll never bring judgment to another
[2:40:26] person
[2:40:27] until I know their story
[2:40:31] because you don't know what you don't no
[2:40:40] that's where we should have such Mercy
[2:40:45] what about God
[2:40:46] who does know your history
[2:40:53] how does he behave towards you
[2:40:56] when you go to pray to him or worship
[2:40:59] him like you have this weekend
[2:41:01] in the morning as he looked down on us
[2:41:03] and say God am I sight you bratty kid
[2:41:07] he opens his arms to us
[2:41:09] and Jesus treats us as though we're a
[2:41:12] brand new baby
[2:41:15] amen amen amen he don't cast us out he
[2:41:19] don't correct us he don't yell at us or
[2:41:22] with us he opens his arms and says come
[2:41:24] here John come
[2:41:25] Daddy's here to help you
[2:41:29] glory to God hallelujah
[2:41:34] he doesn't put his foot on anything you
[2:41:37] low down thing what does Jesus do he
[2:41:40] Stoops himself down
[2:41:44] and he gets down and he talks our talk
[2:41:48] just like you do these little babies you
[2:41:49] know
[2:41:50] this one's still scared of me a little
[2:41:52] bit I'm big I'm scared I gotta turn her
[2:41:54] head
[2:41:57] but give brother Ben some time
[2:42:00] let me get in her world a little bit
[2:42:07] hello
[2:42:11] and I've watched them do it in those
[2:42:12] Chinese kids they come on and they're
[2:42:14] scared of us Americans you know and I'll
[2:42:16] start laughing joking I put a puppet up
[2:42:17] and make some kind of a voice
[2:42:20] I get in their world and all of a sudden
[2:42:21] I'm the best teacher they've ever had
[2:42:24] why
[2:42:25] I could talk to him up here
[2:42:28] Jose and I both are doctors education
[2:42:32] you know what it is brother you could
[2:42:34] stand and use language that people
[2:42:35] wouldn't understand you did it in your
[2:42:37] schools or studies
[2:42:39] but when I'm talking to a common farmer
[2:42:42] a painter or somebody
[2:42:44] I talk their language
[2:42:48] I'm not bragging on me I'm trying to
[2:42:50] tell you that's what Jesus does for us
[2:43:00] God help me say this next bit
[2:43:05] he speaks your broken language of PTSD
[2:43:08] he speaks your complex language
[2:43:11] he speaks your language of fear he
[2:43:14] speaks your language of hurt he speaks
[2:43:17] your language of anxiety he speaks your
[2:43:19] language of being burdened he speaks to
[2:43:22] drug addicts talk he streaks the
[2:43:24] prostitute's language he speaks on your
[2:43:27] lover he gets Right Where You Are
[2:43:33] he gets right down where you are and
[2:43:36] talks just like you are
[2:43:42] I'm mad
[2:43:46] who doesn't read could you imagine God
[2:43:48] could talk in such a way we wouldn't
[2:43:49] understand nothing he ever said or did
[2:43:52] but even when he come to the Earth he
[2:43:54] talked to come and talk
[2:43:56] that's why they couldn't translate him
[2:43:58] for many years they're trying to use big
[2:43:59] words Jesus didn't talk like that
[2:44:01] he taught like a bill hilly
[2:44:04] that's hillbilly back in Tennessee
[2:44:06] he taught like one of the Common People
[2:44:07] the regular people he didn't speak with
[2:44:09] a highly
[2:44:12] as I heard barter Brothers sermon you
[2:44:14] imagine those Jews will be saved over
[2:44:16] there
[2:44:17] watch him when he shows up to Israel
[2:44:20] they said where did you get those scars
[2:44:23] he talks their exact talk
[2:44:25] in the house of my friends
[2:44:31] when he got there amongst those
[2:44:33] Pharisees Simon you know when he put him
[2:44:35] in the corner with dirty feet
[2:44:37] Simon I got something I want to tell you
[2:44:40] he talked just like Simon talked
[2:44:43] but when that little woman got down at
[2:44:45] his feet
[2:44:47] she was anointing him for his burial
[2:44:54] and that lady brought an adultery
[2:44:57] he just wrote down in the sand a little
[2:44:59] while he listened at him cackling
[2:45:01] clock in carry on like a bunch of
[2:45:03] chickens in the barnyard
[2:45:06] he that's without sin let him throw the
[2:45:08] first stone
[2:45:10] I think it was for the eldest to the
[2:45:11] youngest or youngest eldest each one
[2:45:13] just started walking away there's under
[2:45:14] such condemnation
[2:45:16] look at him woman where are your
[2:45:19] accusers at
[2:45:21] he can look to her and said now you're
[2:45:23] Justified as though you never did it in
[2:45:24] the first place Hallelujah the
[2:45:26] revelation of the seventh seal it's all
[2:45:28] been before your eyes he just talked
[2:45:29] regular talk so she can understand him
[2:45:33] glory to God
[2:45:36] he got right in her world
[2:45:40] and condescended to her estate
[2:45:44] he didn't break into the revelation of
[2:45:46] Thunders he didn't break into the
[2:45:47] revelation of the godhead
[2:45:49] he didn't say now woman do you
[2:45:51] understand that I'm not the Eternal son
[2:45:53] do you understand that I came from Glory
[2:45:56] that I am the lamb slate he just said
[2:45:58] where are your accusers at
[2:46:01] you could have said a whole lot more you
[2:46:02] know
[2:46:05] but he reserved all of that for another
[2:46:07] time
[2:46:09] he took what was important
[2:46:11] and he ministered to her at that time
[2:46:15] if we're ever going to get anywhere as a
[2:46:17] body of Christ
[2:46:18] that's the kind of mind
[2:46:21] that has to be in US
[2:46:24] that was in Christ Jesus
[2:46:27] stand with me
[2:46:38] let's bow our heads together
[2:46:45] now just a moment musicians before you
[2:46:47] play
[2:46:51] while you're standing there with your
[2:46:52] heads bound this morning
[2:46:54] lot's been said
[2:46:57] I've certainly
[2:46:59] taking you down many Avenues and places
[2:47:03] without a doubt
[2:47:05] there's been enough said here almost
[2:47:06] this morning to be able to hit any one
[2:47:08] person no matter where they come from
[2:47:13] but while you're standing here
[2:47:15] with your heart focused on the Lord
[2:47:20] with your head bow and eyes closed now
[2:47:24] I want you to think
[2:47:26] you know your heart you know what's in
[2:47:28] there
[2:47:31] does it take the hurt away of what
[2:47:33] people do no
[2:47:35] do you still remember when people has
[2:47:39] done or did or whatever they just some
[2:47:41] kind of past thing sure you remembered
[2:47:44] all the days of your life
[2:47:46] other parts of you that just can't
[2:47:48] forget that molestation or can't forget
[2:47:50] that rape or can't forget that drug life
[2:47:52] or that life of alcohol or addiction or
[2:47:55] just that church history that you come
[2:47:57] from or the way that Pastor treated you
[2:47:59] or whatever it might have been no you
[2:48:01] probably won't ever forget them things
[2:48:03] when Paul said in the book of
[2:48:05] Philippians to forget those things which
[2:48:07] are behind Paul wasn't telling us that
[2:48:09] we would never remember it
[2:48:11] but what he's telling us folks is that
[2:48:14] those memories
[2:48:16] have power
[2:48:18] over your destiny today or tomorrow when
[2:48:22] you forget it you nullify it you make it
[2:48:25] void you take away its power from
[2:48:27] influencing you today or tomorrow
[2:48:31] that's what forgetting means
[2:48:33] I had a sister say to me one time after
[2:48:35] preaching this brother Ben I was
[2:48:37] horribly raped and beaten to death
[2:48:39] nearly how could I ever forget such a
[2:48:42] thing I said sister it's not that you'll
[2:48:43] ever forget it
[2:48:45] but the power of the person that was
[2:48:47] possessed of a spirit in such a way
[2:48:49] drawn after their own lust and things to
[2:48:51] do such a horrific thing to you that
[2:48:52] memory will probably always be with you
[2:48:54] but Christ can give you the ability
[2:48:57] to never let that dominate or influence
[2:48:59] your walk with God except to be in a
[2:49:02] positive way in some manner
[2:49:04] but the negative of it can be taken away
[2:49:06] nullified void May rendered completely
[2:49:08] powerless in your life
[2:49:13] as you're standing here
[2:49:16] you got history in your browser
[2:49:20] Now's the Time to pull up your heart
[2:49:22] before God and say God wipe it
[2:49:25] back to the beginning of time
[2:49:33] clean me out
[2:49:35] delete those hidden files delete those
[2:49:39] cookies in my life delete those little
[2:49:41] tracking things that they put in there
[2:49:42] all that unseen hidden stuff
[2:49:46] because you see in every memory there's
[2:49:47] another little package of memories
[2:49:49] underneath those memories that you don't
[2:49:50] even remember sometimes certain things
[2:49:52] associated with it
[2:49:54] when somebody goes through trauma there
[2:49:57] are certain parts of their mind that
[2:49:59] it's so heavy they can't remember
[2:50:00] certain aspects of it that's your mind's
[2:50:02] way of keeping your sanity
[2:50:05] because to remember that head-on like
[2:50:07] that might be too much for you to drive
[2:50:08] you crazy like the twins brothers talked
[2:50:10] about the one girl could not take the
[2:50:12] pressure of that and it drove her human
[2:50:14] Spirit out of her she went crazy so
[2:50:15] brother Brian said it took me days to
[2:50:17] find that human Spirit bring it back to
[2:50:19] the girl
[2:50:20] said she couldn't take the pressure
[2:50:22] being made fun of as a Christian or
[2:50:24] whatever
[2:50:25] she was a twin her other twin said oh
[2:50:27] forget it they don't want to serve the
[2:50:28] Lord let them jump on a river
[2:50:30] but this other girl couldn't handle it
[2:50:32] it's too much for him
[2:50:33] there were hidden things secret things
[2:50:35] in her that maybe she didn't remember
[2:50:37] herself but
[2:50:39] you click that little button from the
[2:50:40] beginning of time
[2:50:42] God would erase and take away all of the
[2:50:44] Power of even them hidden things you
[2:50:46] don't remember
[2:50:48] you don't need Psychotherapy you don't
[2:50:50] need a psychotherapist or a psychiatrist
[2:50:52] or somebody with that kind of persuasion
[2:50:54] to sit down and talk to you about
[2:50:55] whether your mom and dad was mean to you
[2:50:58] at some point in your life Christians
[2:51:00] you're going to have to start taking
[2:51:01] power
[2:51:02] and take authority over these things
[2:51:04] that plague you your entire days
[2:51:06] now is that time
[2:51:08] as I told you last night I tell you
[2:51:10] again in the name of the Lord like that
[2:51:12] boy brother said he's always looking for
[2:51:14] a place to put his feet on the start and
[2:51:16] he said now is that place son I'm
[2:51:17] telling you in the name of the Lord
[2:51:18] Now's the Time if you want to step up
[2:51:20] higher Now's the Time put your feet down
[2:51:22] start walking like a real Christian
[2:51:24] should walk

[2:51:32] look into your history and things

[2:51:39] he knows how to wash us away

[2:57:50] [Music]
[2:57:54] found I know
[2:57:56] nothing but the blood
[2:58:03] I'm thinking of a church now not long
[2:58:05] ago
[2:58:07] there's some saints standing here this
[2:58:08] morning that
[2:58:10] the number of years ago the Lord sent me
[2:58:12] out there and
[2:58:13] they had all kinds of Divisions and
[2:58:15] things amongst them
[2:58:16] the holy ghost prophesied that night to
[2:58:19] him if you don't have Unity
[2:58:21] if you don't let things go forgive one
[2:58:23] another bind together
[2:58:25] and these Saints they know who they are
[2:58:26] and they know what I'm talking about
[2:58:28] is you're going to lose out God of his
[2:58:30] wife is think completely I I just got
[2:58:33] you know that this little church they're
[2:58:35] not even moving on in Jesus Christ let
[2:58:39] me tell you something brother
[2:58:40] God don't want us harboring feelings
[2:58:42] toward one another
[2:58:44] if your browser is clean this morning
[2:58:47] then keep it that way
[2:58:50] and now I'm going to open it this way
[2:58:52] you might say looking for an altar call
[2:58:55] that's where things are done no no
[2:58:57] the position of your body here has
[2:58:59] nothing anymore to do than the position
[2:59:01] out there
[2:59:02] it's your attitude toward this word
[2:59:04] right here
[2:59:06] now let's sing it again
[2:59:09] you got something in your heart to make
[2:59:11] right with somebody you go over to them
[2:59:13] and you get them by the hand and you say
[2:59:15] I want to repent I want to tell you I'm
[2:59:16] sorry forgive me I want to make this
[2:59:18] thing right I want to get it out of the
[2:59:20] way and while we're singing this is what
[2:59:23] happened in that little church some
[2:59:24] years ago I told him go to one another
[2:59:26] to make things right
[2:59:28] whatever it may be you go get him by the
[2:59:30] hand and say brother sister I want you
[2:59:32] to know I'm sorry you don't have to get
[2:59:34] into a long drawn explanation
[2:59:36] when you click that thing on the browser
[2:59:38] it just wipes it out you don't have to
[2:59:40] explain yourself just say I'm a better
[2:59:42] Christian today than what I was and I
[2:59:45] know I may not have done like I should
[2:59:46] have but I'm repenting I want you to
[2:59:47] know I'm your brother your sister I love
[2:59:49] you and I want to be right with God
[2:59:50] you've got something to make right you
[2:59:52] go make it right while we sing again
[2:59:54] what can wash away my sins
[3:00:00] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[3:00:06] what can make me hold again
[3:00:11] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[3:00:15] [Music]
[3:00:17] oh precious is that flow
[3:00:23] that makes me
[3:00:25] what a snow
[3:00:31] God bless some of you moving
[3:00:34] that's real Christianity
[3:00:38] that's what makes real Christians
[3:00:41] oh precious is the flow
[3:00:47] that makes me wide as snow
[3:00:54] no other
[3:00:56] found I know
[3:00:58] nothing but the blood
[3:01:01] of Jesus
[3:01:06] let's do it one time without any music
[3:01:07] one time I just want to hear them voices
[3:01:09] again oh
[3:01:21] it's all for you Jesus
[3:01:28] ain't that great
[3:01:34] oh sing one more time all your heart now
[3:01:36] oh precious
[3:01:39] ain't that beautiful
[3:01:43] that makes me wide as snow
[3:01:49] snow
[3:01:50] [Music]
[3:01:55] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[3:02:02] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[3:02:10] haha
[3:02:12] oh Hallelujah
[3:02:16] [Applause]
[3:02:19] now the reason I do that it ain't that I
[3:02:21] don't like these musicians play but I
[3:02:24] know how hard they work sometimes they
[3:02:25] need just a few moments to be able to
[3:02:27] worship themselves they're always the
[3:02:29] business in the service of the Lord I
[3:02:31] like to give them breaks from time to
[3:02:33] time so thank you little time with Jesus
[3:02:34] too
[3:02:35] oh any wonderful to us
[3:02:40] I love your friends
[3:02:41] I hope after all the years I've been
[3:02:43] with you you don't think me to be mean
[3:02:45] or cruel or hard or mean-spirited in
[3:02:48] some way and I know for an
[3:02:50] evangelistical sermon this is probably
[3:02:52] one of the worst examples of an
[3:02:54] evangelist sermon to get ever been given
[3:02:56] and not going to apologize for the
[3:02:59] leadership of God
[3:03:02] and I want you to know as much as it may
[3:03:05] be completely off of the regular run of
[3:03:08] what maybe in evangelist you remember
[3:03:09] the Bible said in evangelist is to
[3:03:11] reprove and rebuke with all
[3:03:14] long-suffering and Doctrine
[3:03:16] that's what I did this morning
[3:03:19] and I know be on a shot of a doubt that
[3:03:21] if we listen and obey I said we now we
[3:03:23] me too we listen and obey to these
[3:03:26] things that's being preached and listen
[3:03:28] to what the word said to this morning I
[3:03:30] believe God will bring great changes in
[3:03:32] every one of us
[3:03:34] amen
[3:03:34] [Music]
[3:03:36] now maybe you didn't move at the end of
[3:03:37] the service maybe there's just a big
[3:03:39] whale in your way you know maybe maybe
[3:03:41] maybe uh maybe Captain Ahab can't see
[3:03:44] nothing but the whale there
[3:03:46] but don't let that well kill you
[3:03:50] you got days coming you got time coming
[3:03:53] maybe it may be better a cup of coffee
[3:03:56] sitting at a table that's fine
[3:03:59] I just do what I feel compelled to the
[3:04:00] Lord to do
[3:04:03] but you let that word affect your life
[3:04:07] maybe you say
[3:04:09] I Don't Care About Us in the past but
[3:04:12] the Bible said if you think your
[3:04:14] brothers got ought against you you go to
[3:04:17] them and talk to them
[3:04:20] imagine imagine what kind of people we
[3:04:23] can be
[3:04:24] if when we come in behind those doors
[3:04:27] that we realize it's okay to be
[3:04:29] disagreeable with one another it's okay
[3:04:31] to not always agree
[3:04:33] but to still look at that person and
[3:04:35] feel in your heart I don't agree with
[3:04:36] them certain things they do I wish to
[3:04:38] God they wouldn't do it but that's my
[3:04:40] brother that's my sister
[3:04:42] you know brother Branham said church now
[3:04:44] you listen to me Ontario brother Branham
[3:04:46] said when the people get in that kind of
[3:04:48] spirit of love he said then the gifts of
[3:04:50] the holy spirit will pull right into the
[3:04:52] body of Christ
[3:04:53] and he said when those gifts start
[3:04:54] Milling through the body he said Milling
[3:04:56] he called it Milling through the body
[3:04:58] and start working out there amongst the
[3:05:00] body of Christ he said then let sin
[3:05:02] enter into the camp
[3:05:04] he said the holy spirit will call it out
[3:05:06] right quick
[3:05:07] you see for years we have placed that
[3:05:10] responsibility upon the man that stands
[3:05:11] behind this desk up here
[3:05:13] but it is not always the preacher's
[3:05:15] responsibility to call out sin
[3:05:17] it's yours
[3:05:19] and not even sin but he said what if a
[3:05:22] woman with a red hat come in the bank
[3:05:23] she's dying of cancer the Holy Ghost
[3:05:26] fall on the place thus saith the Lord
[3:05:27] you stole a candy bar or something when
[3:05:29] you was fine go make that rhyme and God
[3:05:32] will heal you that cancer what kind of a
[3:05:34] help what kind of a government could we
[3:05:37] be if we had that kind of love and that
[3:05:39] kind of unit
[3:05:42] I may never live to see it in its
[3:05:44] fullness but God I'll do everything I
[3:05:46] can to sow it into the people I preach
[3:05:47] to
[3:05:55] I love him I love him because he first
[3:05:57] loved me I just can't say no more I I'm
[3:06:00] out of words I keep talking the way I'm
[3:06:03] talking I I'm going to break over in
[3:06:05] another language and you won't
[3:06:06] understand me anyway
[3:06:10] let me explain this to you
[3:06:12] the Holy Ghost is so rich and so thick
[3:06:14] on this platform right now
[3:06:16] that I'm telling you if there's ever
[3:06:18] been a time I know God's pleased I can
[3:06:20] feel the pleasure of the Holy Spirit

[3:06:26] he's proud of us and he's pleased
[3:06:30] with the attitude that we've seen

[3:10:34] walk by nine or ten months you would
[3:10:36] take them to a doctor sure
[3:10:38] because children walk
