just we're going to preach some on T a message what time is it and I really believe you know this is an individual walk God deals with the gentile people individually he deals with Israel as a nation man and you're not here to please me or your wife or your husband not spiritually anyway man you you have to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen and it's it's a it's a it's a marvelous relationship between his bride and Christ the church he is everything he is everything just completely everything amen we are just his tools God can use in the different spot to do his job we are his hands we are everything and we praise him for the opportunity to be just think that part of his plan that he planned and he he scheduled it all up before the foundation World heed you

every Spirit of Satan under the control of you Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah we bless your name amen amen you may have your seats this morning I want to preach on the current events and what time is it and talk about some about what's happening in Israel and different things and we want to use you know our Prophet taught us that the natural always types the spiritual and you know it's very easy for us to see the sliver that's in our neighbor eye but sometimes we got a whole Barn beam in our own eye and we can't see that because it's in my eye and that goes for me too the ministers or or nobody's exempt to that um we all have a a back a backyard let's put it that way amen ministers do too but you know there was somebody that tried to curse the hinder side of Israel and God turned his curses the blessings amen and we just see how how because of us being here for a period of time spiritually and physically people Everything grows common and and we tend to let down the bars and that's why the goats get in and I want to compare this to Israel uh first you know knowing that they were God's nation and you know and then we were grafted in the bride of Christ and and it's just an amazing thing but I want to show you some uh updates and things that the prophet said about it you know when when Israel was attacked physically they had let down their bars you know and and and you know we're not promoting death of any time amen but but God has you know God's in control we know that and you know when when the the those people those murderers terrorist came in that most of the people that were killed L the area they attacked was in the dance most of you probably heard that yeah yeah amen yeah that dance was worshiping Bo buddh I have pictures of St here amen Israel every time God Israel forgot about God God had to chastise them and so will it be spiritually speaking when when you know if if we're in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're going to it'll just be our second nature because it's not even our nature it's Christ's nature and and Christ is the word and so we'll line up with the whole word amen you can't you can't you can't testify of something that you aren't and it'll show by your by your life with the word amen what did John 539 just lay a scripture thing you can pop this up John 5:39 it says search the scriptures for in Ye Ye think you have eternal life and they are they which testify against me yeah me and maybe you yeah yeah and the only way those scriptures can testify against you is if you were outside of some of the [Music] scriptures amen God help us you know and and and you know you just see these things and things that our Prophet said and it just how it's beautiful dve Tales you know the the the we're living in the age where where the anointing on the bride of Christ the word is in the bride of Christ you have thus sayith the Lord you aren't you anymore it's Christ mean it's not you saying this shall be it's Christ saying this shall be you have the right to signature on the bank account amen we don't have all these promises tonight to not have the know how to make a door to CH amen but we're to a time where Christ is coming for a mature bride and we have to be able to take the TRU and the truth will set you free that's right that's right Hallelujah God help us that was a budoo music festival yeah and a spiritual dance a worship now you know see how God God won't be mocked no there'll be many surprises amen many surprises if any of you doubt that I actually have the video of the dance if you want to see what it was like it would be like a rock concert amen and we know that not all Israel are Israel and we know the bride of Christ will be parts of the Bride there and we know the 144,000 is there but we want to look into different things here and I I just want to lay a foundation and and some scriptures I just got to uh look into some things that you know I I it fears me even myself that that you know the Bible says that he's coming for those that are watching for and he'll come like a thief in the night and and you would we don't know when and if we let down our guides and we're unprepared he's going to find us asleep now I know the predestinated bride can't be lost but the predestin bride will be watching for them yeah that's right Hallelujah that's right and let's just look into some scriptures you know the prophet mentioned in the gospel about the Fig Tree and we we mentioned all this and he and he talks about current events before this is men in Matthew Mark and Luke and I want to look in all three of them we got time cuz Luke is really special to me in the back part of this but I'm not you know so if you look at the beginning of these chapters it talks about all the wars and rumors of wars and and you know all the separation and you know not one stone be left upon a stone because Tomac was built with gold between the stones and and you know the the disciples asked Jesus once of these times be and many of those things have already taking place and then so there's many like high the top and we're just going jump and then he said but then you'll see the Fig Tree and when it begins to blo yeah that's where it should catch our attention am man let's go to Matthew 24 and we'll start at 32 and and we're going to read uh we're going to skip around here a little bit just to save time but you know the prophet said multiple times that we've already received our last son you know there's much of the message that's waiting for God something to happen and then that will spark their faith and they'll be ready for Rapture sorry you're going to be lost do say it in the word of God feel bad for you but there ain't going to be nothing else to spark your faith to go to Rapture proph said you're seeing your matter of fact let me back up he said thus sayith the Lord you're seeing your last yeah help Jes and our Prophet said that if God really tells me something really really tells me something I'll say that's how in the world is there believer thinking something's going to happen and then they're going to become a Believer uhoh uhoh you're in trouble you better run for because you're deceived the Bible says that many of those people God give over to a strong illusion that's right that they would believe they were okay when they were not okay and they would believe a lie and be dead God have mercy on us those people believe they're okay matter of fact they actually believe they're real good sincere Believers God help us God help me m m m m trying to figure out my notes Here on my iPad that's Mass confusion help us Matthew 24 we're going to read in verse 32 give me just bear with me for one minute God knows what he's doing Matthew 24 22- 24 maybe we'll go further than that we just a except the days be short and there shall no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days should be short and then if any man shall say unto you Lo Christ is Christ is here or L I believe he's over here believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders and so much that it shall if it were possible it shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you this told you before therefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert don't believe him and behold he's in the secret Chambers believe it not for so wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be I want to tell you something this morning and and and just still laying a foundation but you know if you were shopping let's look physically you know if if you were shopping for groceries this [Music] morning if you were shopping for groceries this morning and you were going to a chain store and they all had the Holy Ghost supplied all the food in the store why would you go to Florida to buy your groceries what's the scripture say Christ is over here let's run and check it up it's the same person supplying the food in the store it's the same Holy Spirit if Christ is over here well let let's go to let's go to BC to get a Gres I believe they'll be better in fres but it's the same Holy Ghost yeah and the Bible says it's a li a lie and don't do it and don't believe it and you see thousands and thousands of people that run here they're run they're looking for something and they're tripping on and they can't find it God help them that's like Israel they were run they we want to be like the neighbors we want to have a cre yeah the prophet came to Israel and said have I ever robbed you have I ever Li to you have I ever put you in armies have I ever oh no no no no no but but we're looking for something yeah looking for it's right in front of you called the prophet of God Amen Matthew 24 I got 30 2 and 34 now learn the parable of the Fig Tree when the branch is yet tender and putting forth his leaves you know that summer is night so likewise ye when you shall see all these things happen know that we are know that it is at it is near even at the door verily verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled now we know that God's word never lies but that Generation by the time frame in the Bible our clocks were off because we're operating on God's clock but a generation by the clock in the Bible that we've gotten in the letter form is already over right so how close are you you're seeing the world armies concentrate right where we won't be here when that war takes place yeah yeah that's right wow you think that's a mistake no no you know you know I could just so many things you know they had an emergency meeting this they had an emergency meeting with the UN which we know the UN is a joke and and it was just an army for the the uh Rome but they had an emergency meeting with the UN and and uh the Saints wanted the UN to give a strong condemnation to the attacking and Russia abstain so there can be no security action what's our prophecy what Russia Russia's at L and Russia will need fuel you know where I'm going what time is it what time is it at the time of War Russia will need fuel and Israel's at War see how things are coming together so quickly and yet we can fall asleep and wonder when we see the Fig Tre but let's just let's just look into the other scriptures let's read 36 but the day and the hour knowth no man know not even the angels in heaven but the father only and let's just jump to 41 just to save time in Matthew 24 42 sorry watch therefore for ye know not the hour or the day that the Lord cometh let's just jump ahead to uh to Mark 13 just laying some foundations of the Fig Tre here barely very I say unto you this this generation shall not pass to all these things shall be done for heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of the day and the hour knoweth no man no not even the angels in heaven but the son neither the son but the father only amen and then we're going to go to Luke our scripture in Luke Luke 2132 and I just want to show you what what God shown us here this morning amen Luke 21 32-36 Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away now here here here's where God's talking to us take heed to yourself lest at any times your heart be overcharged or S with Sur surtin I looked up that word I asked my wife so what's that word mean I don't know and then let me just explain here this is God talking in the gospels and this word serpentin means it means exactly where every one of us are living It's Easy Living it says it's an overabundance of Supply it's access exess like a huge amount amen it's it it's disgust caused by access of drinking or food now here's God telling us he said don't be don't let your hearts come at this time be overcharged with access and drunkenness and the cares of of this life so that the day will come upon you on the letterers now every one of you seen this happen since Monday does it change your life God help us for as a snare shall come verse verse 25 for as a snare shall come on all them that dwell on the Fai of the whole earth watch you therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy and accepted of all these things that shall come to pass and stand therefore for the son of man God help us that in this hour you know God put everything before us to show us what time it is the fig tree has been there for a generation and and we we're living our life I'm living my life sometimes much of the times like it's never going to happen in my day yeah let me just tell you what the greatest events are going to happen in your day let's just look at Israel and see that let let's lay set a foundation of what's going on you know all the wars that have happened in Israel and how the Arab Nations all attacked Israel when they become a nation you know whenever you know in the 40s amen and they had the 1948 war and Israel won and they had the 19676 day war and Israel won and every time Israel won the war Israel asked for peace that I would like to be your friend but they couldn't you say how could they not but they were refused because God hardened their hearts now everything that's happened in Israel is happened in Joshua 11 and I would hugely encourage you when you go home read the whole chapter of Joshua 11 but let's look at Joshua 11:20 and it'll show you what's happening and the same thing now think spiritual with me don't just think natural think spiritual for it was the Lord that's that's that's the top we can't go no higher than that yeah it was the Lord the Harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle don't think spiritually don't think of the bride of Christ the Bible says that if you were of the world the world would love you but when you're not of the world they hate you because you're not of them that's right so so you should not have nobody in the bride hating me that's right yeah that that's kind of the math I learned in high school or then they wouldn't be in the bride it was the Lord that hardened their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle that he might have no favor of the world but that he might mightily oh this should humble you like Jared said destroy them there's going to be a massacre a massacre and I'm going to tell you something what'll happen when the massacre happens the Bible says there'll be a massacre that's that's say the Lord of God word to God the world will turn against Israel and this prop when they see the M do you know you want me to tell you something Biden he's a joker already told Israel make sure you don't do war cries just almost turnning if you got the Holy Ghost you should have some discernment turning it I'm not so sure that carrier be there if the Congress wasn't controlled by a different party as the Lord ha commanded Moses now you let's look into this when Joshua you know that you know I love these scriptures because Moses was God to Pharaoh but when Moses died God was done without wrench man we're past the time of worshiping people you know we had beautiful fellowship at Sharon and brother Carson's and oh if you ever go to sister Sharon she's going to oh you don't go on a diet or you come hungry or something you don't leave hungry that's for sure it was just amazing but we had a wonderful time and they were showing how Wayne Lawson was mentioned we moved Beyond The Prophet The Prophet is Dead period he's completely de I have quot dozens of quotes where the Prophet said my name should never be mentioned he says never look at the messenger look at the message don't look at a F Pastor don't look at a good pastor look at the message that's coming forth watch what they say don't look at the delivery and the gift and how if he's got a $100 hairo and if they got a Roman cathol Church God can care less about that it's what he's saying amen what's the word of God we got the spirit has moved into the prophet is being fulfilled in our lives and we're watching it and we're falling with you a Wonder Foredom fall the greatest event that's ever going to take place in the history of all of God's predestinated plan it's going to happen in your day you should lose your mind hallah Hallelujah and so see God ain't stuck on veger skin you know he had no problem getting rid of the old Tabernacle in the wilderness of the Old Testament when the perfect sacrifice Christ came and he run that Veil from Top the bottom didn't have nothing to do with the kings of the earth they were ton Potter of God he's Jehovah he's the provider he's everything it's all about Jehovah it's not about amen hallelujah we love worshiping people people worship the prophet they worship the best preacher they worship this they worship the building Hall that's right it could burn tonight sir and Earth will pass away but my word my word it'll never pass away his word is never going to burn up it's inside me you can burn me up but it's still myy I am Jesus Hallelujah and so Joshua come on the scene and he just s SP I've said that multiple times your brother's here I have tremendous confidence and I can be in a car accident on the way home don't even cry for me don't have a funeral just cook me and save all the money and send it to missions and what do you Brothers stand up here and start preaching again you say why it won't be you just get out of the way just shut up and get out of the way and let Christ come in amen thank you should be out to teach and handle the word hallelujah and so here we see Joshua God L this his attention from Moses to Joshua praise God he don't worship flesh [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus Joshua was 10 times the warrior than Moses ever dreamed about being and you know Joshua we all think of Moses and every kid in the public school would know Moses name and all this but it was Joshua that conquered the land it was Joshua that had the commission from Christ and to your inheritage you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have the baptism that's better than Moses message I AMC I don't want to live in The Prophet's day I want to live where the unfolding of the Revelation is completely unfolded Hallelujah a prophet I'm heading the top of the mountain piece and the young F ministry will come and open all the revelations up yesus 38 says I do nothing except I reveal the secrets to my prophets but then the secrets unfolded and unfolded and unfolded and the Revelation expanded and expanded and you say how can that be because it's God you can't put God in just one little box from 1945 to 1965 he won't fit in that box no no no w CU there sub boxes bigger I'm still here hallelujah but even when God changed to Joshua as I was with Moses so I'll be in the bright praise God hallelujah hallelu thank you Lord Jesus blessed be your name but when joshu was here on Earth the type of the N there was three cities that Joshua did not come first did anybody know that I didn't either until I studied you know the Bible told God told Joshua I said wherever your foot goes George I think it' be good to have a good walk in life to go into all the world preach the gospel that's the only commission only commission it's not build churches it's not side churches it's not put on Church go just go just go don't take no money you don't need no money don't even take an extra pair of shoes I'll make shoes they'll last in the wilderness 40 years just just go just go just go don't build hospitals don't just go Hallelujah and Joshua went and he did a great work and I'm not beating up Joshua but there was three cities that somehow they could have put him in a wheelchair and put his feet down and just step them and give them a little push I tell my kids I'm getting old and they think I'm kiding them but I know I'm getting old I'm getting really old my leg follow me sometimes I'm F and there was three cities Josh what in the T and you're all looking at me like Brother D that's what the Bible says Joshua 11:22 I feel like you better pull it up because if you don't believe me my voice you maybe need to see it and we're still dealing with this today now three of two of these three cities are abandoned one was the POR City ashad if I'm saying it right was an old sea par and it's in [Music] Ruins and God go is also in RS let's read 22 and there was none of the H you f an who an Anakin left in the land of the children of Israel only daa does that sound [Music] familiar only Baza was like you know God was around then and he's still around only Gaza G Goliath came from gath by the way yeah and Asad there remaining uhoh yeah uhoh uhoh Joshua never did enough walking that's right oh bless God I get tired I get tired I was satisfied with all God had give me and why did I want to have a more spiritual deep infinite Rel relationship with God you know I'm satisfied with the Revelation that the prophet brought and uh oh wow I'm going to say oh here soon because there's a scripture I'm missing but in that same chapter maybe one of you can find it in after 22 it says that God would come against them and utterly destroy them oh actually was 20 the one I read already I'm sorry see Israel will liberate God it's God work said and I'll tell you right now when it hits the screens it won't be 30 yeah and that'll build a hatred yeah yes sir uhuh just say uhhuh s for Israel now we know the prophet said this he said you know I've always had a feeling for the Jewish people he said I've always felt and I you know he always had an awesome feeling for from the Jewish people he talked about the Gentiles taking the message to the Jewish people Jewish people will recognize that that's in' 62 and here's another quote he said the ceing of 144,000 of Israel he said now them Jews he said now this is important because we have friends that aren't here this morning that struggle with this you have to be able to decipher yeah J mentioned that you have to decipher from real br yeah yeah that's right people that hang around right yeah they dress up nice they have really cool s they say all the right L like God bless you praying for you but they carry a 4 in Kazu in their back pocket and you walk by they don't have eyes in your back yeah you might get speared yeah he said I'm not talking about the Wall Street bunch of Jews yeah that's always cheated yeah and sto and everything else that's what the prophet said in the 10 verses but I mean the real believer the real Jew y the nice Jew that kept the Commandments of God on down from there see and the even Believers sometimes or or make Believers or know you have to distinguish the World Bank is run by Jews there are a million miles y huh yeah but there will be an elect lady that's right yeah I'm not worried about all this counterfeit garage yeah yeah but there will be an elect lady that the holy spirit is feeding lip to ear oh tell me more Lord Jesus a little bit more like Rebecca when El went give Rebecca oh I've never seen Isaac but [Music] just tell me more H God help us so we could do you know the old uh prime minister of Israel from 69 to 74 said this I'm just this is maybe not for you but but but Jared said kind of he didn't know I definitely didn't know I was saying this he said when she said she said when peace comes perhaps in time I will be able to forgive you forgive the Arabs for killing our own sons that sounds good right but it'll be much harder uhoh for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their son forced for I know a sense spiritually but that's left because I made a commitment to God that I preach the word exactly how he gave to me regardless if it was just my wife sitting in front of me here yeah because I'm not going to get that and have blood on my hands no it'll be much harder to forgive that you forcing me to hurt you you see what me these people they're not asking for war yeah see the r right of Christ isn't asking for enemies yeah when's the last time you wanted to be a friend with the make believer and you just couldn't be because water and oil won't miss did that hurt you you you're forced to yeah and this world's looking for blenders oh but God's looking for people that got a backbone y yeah that's right push it away help us Jesus oh God amen amen here's some prayers from the Psalms pull this up girls second uh Psalms 1122 6-9 these are good prayers for you to be praying you may not understand it but it's God's purpose and it's in the word of God just leave it in God's hands you don't have to understand it believe it excuse me Psalms 1226 Pray for Peace of Jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee I want to show you something here when God inspired David to write this you don't think he knew that all of Israel was isra but see the rain falls on the just and the unjust so you know right God will still BL the believer you'll have a better crop than your neighbor guarantee you know can I brag on God for just a minute by be did about 55 push off I had the trucker call me out for when I was going to semis he ask me he said hey how' your beans go D he said I've heard yields as low as 17 Bush I just smile and than you I'll go PR you want me to go thank you Jes you think that's a coincidence some of those feels on the same road I live on yeah you think I'm that SM thanks for your confidence but thank you Jesus it rained on their field too but God love oh he can do anything he's Jehovah peace be with those within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces in verse eight thank you J and for my brethren and my com companions companions sa I will now say peace be within thee because of the house of the Lord Our God will I seek th good wow pray for Israel people will die yeah people will have to do things even against their own personal will decisions it'll be terrible war is always terrible y amen Psalms 102 Psalms 102 13-1 15 thou so arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yay the time set time uhoh it's coming for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor her dust thereof so the Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the Earth the glory that will be in herall amen hallelujah God knows what he's doing amen hallelujah let's just look at some other scriptures here where it talks about us be prepared Ezekiel 14 Ezekiel 14:2 says the word of the Lord came unto me saying the son of man these men have set up their Idols in their hearts uhoh uhoh oh dancing to Idols is not that's not favorable but you know religion uhhuh can have an idol in your heart yeah it might be the grocery store that you're going to buy food from in Louisiana yeah and put a stumbling block of their iniquity before their face and I shall inquire and I shall be inquired of it of At All by them therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God every man of the house of Israel Seth up his idols in his heart think spiritually don't think of Israel all day is a stumbling BL to our iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet and I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols who are we worshiping who are we worshiping Hallelujah let's just read just a little further that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart because they all arange EST strange me through their Idols therefore say unto the house of Israel thus sayith the Lord God repent and turn yourself from the idols and turn away your faces from all your Abominations for every house of Israel or the stranger that sojourned in Israel which separate himself from me and Seth up Idols in his heart put a stumbling block of his iniquity before my face and cometh the prophet and inquire him of him concerning me the Lord will answer him by himself verse eight and I will set up my face against that man and and I will make him a sign and a proverb and I will cut him off from Aid the bride ye shall keep and ye shall know that I'm still the Lord wow amen here's here's a warning to Israel in Exodus and this warning can be made to us spiritually Exodus 20 3-6 he said Thou shalt have no other gods before me and thou shalt not make unto thee any dven images or likeness of anything that's in the heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the water or under the Earth and thou shall bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I am the Lord thy God and I am a jealous God visiting the iniquities of the fathers unto the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments see what's happening in the world spiritually and in Israel here in God proven his word this is a 654 quote I have three of them in front of me but just laying laying this out for you he said the Royal Seed of Abraham let me tell you this thus sayith the Lord you have received your last son your last son amen it's going home time for the it's it's actually Pastor you say how can that be the prophet believed it would happen in his death in his death but brother Dale wasn't in yet and all that God give him in his hand n will be lost but we you know the you know there was scriptures here it talks about you know you can maybe I have them here I'll see them you can see the signs of the times and nature I believe just second I don't know if I printed that believe it's John 3 it talks about you know I tell you the signs of the times and you'd recognize the natural signs spiritual signs are right to and you miss it amen God showed us the watch the Fig Tree he told us through a prophet to watch Russia and we're not going to be here when many of these things happen amen I'm not telling you this to scare you in any way shape or form we don't serve God because we're scared amen we serve God because we love him amen but we're living do you know literally literally do you know how fast pass this natural War could turn around how just to let you know late last night when we got home I watched some videos of what Israel's doing the God's and there will be no life saved thousands thousands hundreds of thousands missiles planes and fruit ships in bivy and that's what's going to happen they have the whole world come against Israel and Russia need fuel but I'm not going to be here for that cuz I'm not looking for another sign here's another one in spiritual Amnesia 6 for he says now look I want to ask you something what if he does come tonight 64 oh say he isn't coming I don't know whether he is or not this is your last sign he said remember this I didn't know that had this again he says thus sayith the Lord our Prophet did you ever hear me say that but whatever it is true he said you've seen your last sign that's spiritual and you've seen your last sign anybody watching this need to hear this Pentecostal you've seen your last son you've seen your last sign Pentecostal don't get all mixed up now with that and what he promised Israel after the Rapture we were talking about that brother Christ some of all the great Miracles and signs and wonders and just speaking food on your table and all that thing and I'll be great if it happens praise God as long as sister Sharon's cooking it it'll be wonderful uh but I'm not looking for it because like the Bible said but I thought Elijah was going to come and Jesus said said yeah he has already come and you missed it he said don't get all mixed up now what he promised for Israel after the Rapture now that means I won't be here when I oh I'm going to miss all that cool stuff I don't have a problem with that that ain't for you you're done then now your now is your day and now is your sign and now is your time don't don't reject it don't do it you'd better come in that's we're living literally we might not be here next Sunday I I don't know but that's how you're supposed to live correct Jes I honestly don't know that we will arrive to but if we do we're going to have a good time in the Holy Spirit right that's how right yeah and you're de with me right now when the Bible says he'll come like a thief and you could read many more scriptures that I said about like the good Master he said he put off his com and so the servant slumbered and slept and beat up the M servants and all that and he came in a time when you didn't think he would go the Bible says you didn't expect and that goes for about two men amen God help us another one thus sayith the Lord third one thus sayth the Lord we're seeing our last sign what time are we living in what time are we living in but because of the deception of Satan he has rocked us and the a rocking chair and it never squeaks cuz he's oil the hinges real good he just I can't hear the boms landing I don't feel the earth saken I don't see God moving I don't see God moving brother I don't see God moving no it's because you're Stone blind Y and he gave you a strong delusion because you're a m believer he's going to leave you there amen God help us God help us in this time pray for Israel pray for God's Will and pray that God will come quickly and take us to his perfect plan amen this world's not my home let's stand this world's not my home no I'm just the passing through multiple times here he says watch Russia watch Russia it was his third third Vision where when he had the the visions and and the multiple Visions there it was his third Vision that said watch Russia watch Russia Joshua 11 explains everything that's happening right now and it's prophecy it must happen it will and must come to pass because it's God's word Hallelujah God help us N na are Hallelujah God help us to not be in the state of Slumber yes and sleep and God help us to look at the scriptures and and be on I'm telling you church it's not to impress me it's not important to me you come here don't come here it's important to me you get to have we love you we love you regardless but your Eternal destination has a lot more to do with the next 20 years of my life amen and it should be too but you we need to be honest with oursel and make sure that we we line up our scriptures you know you see so many things even in the ranks of all this Pro you know watch this in all the Revelation that God's given us and Satan's put all this gun on a true bride just this week alone just this week alone you know he's coming for a mature and we got to put our shoulders back this week alone I had two message ministers [Music] you don't fall because you're not going to get there and say well oh bless God you know this Minister he uh he you know he he no that won't work you I say oh bless God you know I didn't go here because I thought here you think of all the message people hundreds more than you can imagine just I was saw brother car just one great close all all the message churches in TR are sitting home on their couch on a regular basis and I looked it up I think the prophet said about 70 some times 72 or 73 times he said never stay home never never I don't I don't have it now he said you go to that church and show what side you're on show what side he said if they don't even if they only have one piece one cherry out of the whole piece of pie that's true he said you'll show the outside world that I'm a Believer I believe I go to the house of God on the resurrection morning yeah oh Satan comes too but we don't want him to be the only one here yeah yeah yeah people think they got their and it's their own doctr y why do you think David said as some have for sake not to sel together as some already have now if you think it was bad in David's day I don't remember the internet was that great in David's time in the Bible and I don't think the head screams that same Spirit yeah was this is what that Spirit now I couldn't mingle with them cuz you know yeah uhh that help us it's a separating time this is spiritually and naturally and I'll tell you what there's going to be

thing and this little thing I want to share this thing I'm going to close with this remember this that your Prophet said you know what he questions and answers in 64 he said this he said be careful who you listen to he was talking about himself cuz he he realized that actually himself was a human yeah mightly used of God like never before yeah all hands down but he said when God really gives me something he said two things he said everything I said he said take back to the word stay back to the word which we can and he said when God really speaks to I'll say th say the [Music] Lord and every one of those quotes I read this morning where thus says the Lord we've seen everything we're going to see yeah it's over it's over it's just we're still here only for a very very very very short very
