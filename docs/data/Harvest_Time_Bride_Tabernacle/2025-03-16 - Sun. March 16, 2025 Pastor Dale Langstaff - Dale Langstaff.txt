their new dwelling place and and so that's two weeks from now we'll we'll give more but next Sunday brother Gabe will be here from Li Ohio and I just really talk to him on the phone and I'm just looking forward to fellowship with him I really felt very kindred spirit just a really awesome brother and of of course I fellowshipped and met him there different times and ministers meetings and different things but a great a great brother also me and Lan had went to see her family and uh come home you know and and had a good trip seeing Sister Laura and uh and Sister Laura is completely healed she has zero pain like that's zero is none zero pain man just God is God is still super and God is still awesome and and uh she's just taken therapy but it's just to stretch her muscles and

they're going to Nic uh Nigeria my wife's gone uh but they're going to to minister in Easter and and she's going with Brother John which is beautiful and we just pray that God will bless them there and Africa it'll be John's first time to Africa for both of them and he's in for a real treat you know in Ministry and also just uh just a couple more things we we uh we fellowship with Len's family and uh some of them are coming to our camp in August and uh they're very they're just unbelievably tender to God's word the last two times I I shared a while ago we actually witnessed to him a bunch about what God's done in our day the last time and like this time a year later she was weeping in the restaurant reading the Bible off her phone to me amen and she was testifying she said I want to be just what God wants me to be like man God can work with that they said they're coming they're bringing their instruments are coming to camp and uh so God's God's doing things God God's just alive as he ever was alive and and we praise God for that and and we just uh love and adore him amen and just uh amen just so I felt like I had something else but uh amen so let's just stand and look at his word today Vicki I'll sing that song at the end we're turn to First Peter 2 amen oh I remember what it was my interpreter many of you weren't here Wednesday my interpreter from El Salvador and Nicaragua when we were there called me on Tuesday when we were at brother Jeff brother Jeff was talking to him when he called and and he invited me to Mexico to a convention there in Easter said there'll be over 1,200 people there and he said we they asked for a minister that had sound Doctrine and he called me and brother John and uh so I got back to him I thought I had escaped completely I said brother Leno I said I don't have the money to to travel now he said he said I'll send you your ticket your plane ticket and that kind of affected everything else but I still didn't feel like uh to go and I've kind of I've kind of somewhat told them that if they can find somebody else but you know the day after I told him I wasn't sure that I could go I we had just a a large amount of things taken care of financially to the even to the church somebody had donated gave a large amount and and and personally somebody said called me and said you know I can I can pay something here and and you know God God is just unbelievable you know and then so like the very next day I was like oh God did I tell him the right answer there was thousands of dollars it changed the picture completely amen and but God knows amen and we're happy to be here and and I told him I actually told him I said well maybe next year but uh an amazing brother if you ever meet brother loo I'd love to have him come here he's a tremendous man of God tremendous there's many of them but he's one of them amen amen sorry for that amen 1 Peter 2 amen starting at verse four to whom coming as unto Living Stones this allowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious now that's you verse five ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices first Peter 2 verse 5 acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ and verse 7 we're going to drop down to 1 Peter 2 uh 1 Peter 2 and verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation and you're peculiar that you shall show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light Lord Jesus I pray that that you will be the one that ministers this morning and Lord just this very very simple but amazing thought that you have a chosen bride in this day and Lord we just pray that you'll portray the the the Revelation and thought that you sent my way to your people Lord Jesus Through the ministering of the word and we'll give you the glory for it and your honor thank you Lord Jesus for your presence and the visitors and The Beautiful People here your bride bless them Jesus in a special way we pray amen you may have your seats we want to go through uh first Samuel and I want to minister on the bride's anointing like David anointing was in the Old Testament King David and we want to minister about yourself but we want to minister and show the parallel of David you know we know that God every time he does something in the word he always reveals it you know he'll show it in the heavens he'll show it in the scriptures he'll he'll send examples ahead of time that's why when we get to the Judgment day you'll have have no excuses why but God's here to this morning to encourage you and recognize you that you're an anointed people today and you're a chosen generation and you're even better than that you're royalty amen you can't get a lot higher than that and it might not look like you are you might say I'm poor and I'm cast down and I'm living in a barn and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I don't nobody recognize me that's exactly how it was with David there was a time when David was anointed king and nobody recognized it that's right his own family didn't recognize it the nation did not recognize it the Israelite people did not recognize it David's first soldier men that went down to the well and kicked the water were not Israelites no you know David never had a throne you don't have a throne yet you know there in your life there's a lot of yets that's right you might not feel like you're wearing the royal priesthood gown yet yet you might not feel like that you're recognized yet you might not feel like you have an army yet you might feel that way you might not feel like you given the respects of Jehovah yet there was somebody else that was in that spot you know in Samuel 1st Samuel 16 1-7 or one we're going to read past that but you know the Lord said to Samuel he said how long will you mourn the old denominational backslid in people that don't want to obey my words why are you worried why do you worry about anybody that don't want to follow whatever God's leading in your heart that's don't worry about anybody else why are you crying about the ones that weren't born for the same purpose as you yeah that's right why are you crying over spilled milk amen but I have a chosen generation and I'm sending you down to Jesse's family and here the prophet was as scared to go and anoint this people he said there's no way God I'm going to minister in that church I could lose my neck he said well take a red heer with you tell them you come in peace and you're here to sacrifice amen and do you know watch this you know it it is so Supernatural God left saw because of Disobedience he was still saved but because of Disobedience and the spirit of God fell on David never to leave even in his shortcomings oh he had a couple of them a couple pretty large ones yes the Bible says it never left him you think you have a couple shortcomings that don't change predestination election chosen you know many are called but there's just a few that's right that are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a be your people amen wow if you recognize the prophet said if you recognize what God has invested and thoughts of you you would lose your mind you would be Stone drunk spiritually I mean we would knock the windows open how long will you mourn all the problems of church politics government politics finances worlds you know you know me and Lan are fastly finding out that life is fleeting and there's some of you here don't know that yet and just hang on you're going to find out really soon one of these mornings you're going to wake up and you're going to go oh uh-oh I never felt that before Oh am I ever whatever that word is you know we supernaturally we didn't know we were going to L's family and we got down there and her brother the day we went was his last day at work it's Lan's closest kin to her closest and he's 66 her closest brother and I'm like whoa I mean all the other ones are what happened where did the hair go it's poof and we were saying come in here you know only What's Done For Christ will last you know if I live 10 years it won't matter one thing what I do physically in any way money I make or houses or lands or nothing I ain't taking none of that the connection or anything with you you should get on a plane and just travel and praise God daily because amen where will you be in 10 years I I know I know it's cold weather here and you know we we need to be you know uh physically responsible we don't have that problem in Canada we're so physically responsible we're spiritually irresponsible amen life is like that you know I was thinking our our we started having games on Friday night the first Friday of every first Friday of every month we had games tonight and I mentioned that different ones you know it was just a few days after we had the games tonight that my nephew and them in birth their baby was dead you know and I thought wow all that you have is the good times that you can remember if you don't never get together with nobody and I ain't here next Sunday don't cry for me I'm in heav it but all you can do is be together be together Fellowship together we have no guarantees about tomorrow you know next Sunday could be a lot different yes that's right amen amen we had just cross the border when my brother called me and you know I I mean many of us have had miscarriages and different things and that and and those are terrible and especially when you want a family and and we ourselves did but when you're going to the to the day that you're thinking you're going to hold your baby in 1 hour and you send it to the funeral home that's that's a little different than a miscarriage I mean because I mean a miscarriage is still sad I'm not downplaying that especially if you're far along but you weren't expecting to hold life that day and get no life but that's the way our life is you think you'll be here next Sunday but who told you that uhuh uhhuh that's why it's it's a this is a celebration and and you know it's so easy to get beaten down and and and and consumed with the surroundings around them David had really good example to be beaten down oh I if I would have been David I would have had some I would have had a complain Department how could David be a chosen royalty King and run for his life yeah you know we're running for our life your spiritual life you're running for your spiritual life you have struggles I know you have struggles cuz I have struggles yeah you're running for your life you're being shot at the prophet said every Cannon is on you because you represent the the the move and life of God every pistol in that's then Satan's Fleet is poined at you he said this he said if he ain't already got you then he's hunting you okay so if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost every gun is on you so you're running for your life Wow but at the same time you're running for your life there's a throne prepared for you do you know that you're going to judge the world and the angels are going to be subject to this little person this little tiny bride that's in a unpainted Church running for her life that nobody would recognize that's right it's like oh don't worry about them they're just like a handful don't worry about David they they got they got military armies and countries you know the prophet said that David's closest men the Hittites recognized the anointing you need to recognize your anointing yes yes you need to recognize that you're chosen don't worry about what brother Dale says to you don't worry about what the person sit right beside you is you can recognize that God called me I'm chosen if your if your closest friend turns you down Jesus never you know it's a revelation that if all of you are lost which I don't believe none of you are that I'll be there it's it's it's right inside me amen Hal huah we need to stop you know and and believe me they s for brother we need to stop crying true wait a minute brother Dale needs to stop crying you can't preach much closer than that did David cry David never cried David wasn't looking for royalty you didn't recognize when you were born you were royalty not until God through Amazing Grace drawed you and you say woo this don't this home don't feel quite right that's right amen it never ever shows that David cried or complained how long will you mourn all the things that you don't have you don't have the kingdom you don't have the riches nobody's recognizing your ministry you all have a Ministry hello nobody's recognizing your ministry nobody's recognizing you as a person they're all looking at some [Music] big but there's one person Jehovah Gyra amen that he's recognizing who were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world Amen you know it's so easy as humans we're still humans and you know and and I I you know we I just believe God's bringing us to a to a Capstone I just believe he's bringing us to a maturity and so like when we become mature we'll cry less brother Dale will cry less if you and every one of you heard me complain or why so when you see me come to that maturity I'll cry or whine less because did God make a mistake no well no no he didn't make a mistake so then why am I whining and and you see what I mean so we're going to we're going to kind of come out of the effects of the Flesh and and come into the the watch this how how God had to tell his prophet Samuel I mean a Vindicated Prophet like no no doubts about this he said I don't see like you see I don't see great Ministries and little Ministries I don't see great special singers and little special singers I don't see great testimonies and little testimonies I don't see great healings and little tiny healings I see the heart amen amen I see the heart I see the desire of the heart is yearning yearning you know our Prophet said this he said I would rather have somebody with the wrong Doctrine and the right Spirit than the right now than the right Doctrine and the wrong Spirit now now that ain't to say that that's not to say we should be wrong because we know the truth so you know but you know when we sat across the people at the table they don't look like you and they're weeping in a public place where you would be embarrassed to say grace over your meal they're weeping uncontrollably to obey God the Bible says that anybody that desires to be filled God will fill them God will fill them God for sure will fill them you can't have a desire that strong I'd say well you know you no no no that's not who we serve amen so God don't see the different levels of respects see the prophet thought that Jesse's first son was for sure going to be the king while he was the eldest well he had been around the longest he had the most wisdom he had the stature and countenance he had the delivery that was amazing to speak in the Kingdom of the you know the Thrones of he was going to conquer the world and God told the prophet he said I can see their heart too and it's not the one I choose it's not the one I choose amen it's so different than our human thing you know and so here you know you are forgot about people you are like not even recognized well you know you know in the world they would say well what church you go to well what denomination is that I don't recognize you right they didn't recognize David either don't you have any more Sons well just this little runny ugly you know squirt and he smells like sheep and the Bible says he was runty and ugly said he had no natural beauty How could a young boy be no natural beauty amen let's look at that now he was with runty and with with all of all Beauty countenance he was ugly now if he was ugly at 10 I wouldn't want to see him at 57 wow amen God help us see God has something for you and you need to recognize who you are for us to recognize our position in Christ you will you know when David look at this and I'm way ahead of my notes but you know when David was was King and he went out in the Army and the people come back fact the Israelite people wanted to Stone David because the other countries had come in and taken their wives captive and you know what the Bible says now that's just at the end of my notes the Bible says that David encouraged himself that's fairly personal he said God I know I'm you you could pray and you say God I know I'm yours because I never chose you God God chose you and you Vindicated it to me and it made it a personal relationship and you revealed yourself to me and you took the scales off my eyes and you showed me that you're my husband and I'm your bride chosen anointed an anointed people wow you know the meaning of Christ in Greek is anointing and the meaning of Christ in the Hebrew is Messiah now that is exactly what is tabernacled inside of you if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you are the anointed messiah in Greek Hebrew because the Bible says that it's no longer I that liveth but Christ Jesus that liveth inside of me how in the world could you have a quiet day how in the world could you be the royalty of a throne with the world as your foot stol and say well I had kind of a quiet passive day today woo because you don't recognize who you are that's right you don't recognize the deity is not in heaven right deity is an earth y amen amen and the world is your foot stol and we watch far brother Dale watches far too much news but it can be in some countries a Time piece for our going home but you see how we're Chosen and anointed people and no matter what people say you know you know if you're breathing today there'll be people that don't like you don't worry about them say praise the Lord I'm sorry I'm I'm sorry I disturb you just breathing but Hallelujah I'm breathing you know we all know that if you do anything for Christ you'll be attacked and we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against spirits that are anointed on people that if you're trying to do something kind the body of Christ wow amazing what God had you know and I I want to show you this brother Dale's still here David was anointed chosen royalty and he went played for his and he played without getting paid for his enemy and he tried to assist his enemy and getting the evil spirit off of his enemy that the very same God that anointed David had put on him woohoo wow wow somebody that's trying to kill your character you would go and sing them a special and visit them in their home and take them you know shepherd's pie and say praise the Lord I need to do that you know that really and more than pray for them take them shepherd's pie and maybe give them you know something and send them flowers wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute D David knew that the prophet had anointed him to be king but there was one thing that David knew too and that was God's time that's right that's right that's right he knew David knew exactly who he was but he didn't push God yeah that's right J bless God I better I better go Minister somewhere bless God I better I better start up and and I mean we we need some more bless God startups cuz cuz we're afraid of starting anything but but David waited on God's time it wouldn't have been super easy waiting when when uh when the spears were shining in the sun all pointing at you and you were hiding in the cave wow David went by choice because the king asked for anybody that could take the thing off of him that God had allowed to go on him the evil spirit and they said well we know this Jesse son and he plays the really beautiful you don't think David knew what was happening you don't think David knew that he was anointed by the prophet to be king and would take over the kingdom and he was going to the one whoa I'm not so sure am I David yet are you David yet wow amen help us Jesus you know I want to show show you something David never had a crown yet you don't have a crown yet but it's coming David never had his royalty robe yet but yours is coming he never had his throne yet that he was sitting on it's it's prepared or being prepared he never had the kingdom under his foot stol yet he never had the this is something you don't have he never had safety yet David never had safety but he was no anointed and he was chosen but he didn't think he had safety not when he was running for his life and hiding in caves he wasn't respected I know that touches many of you probably of us by different type of people he wasn't respected was not respected let me let me David wasn't respected by the Israelites hello you are not respected by what are called Israelites just fill in the blank there you know the word to put in there by people that say they are you're not don't don't don't pretend you are I know I know what you're you're alive I'm alive yet but he was still the bride and the people from another Nation the Hittites like Uriah that David robbed his wife would sacrifice their life they would sacrifice everything to go get the water down in the well that David used to drink out of insanity to fight through the Israelite Army in complete Insanity but they would they would just drop their lives off like dominoes to honor a man that never had all those things because they had read the read the last chapter of the book and they had recognized the Revelation inside here that they couldn't see it with their eyes but they knew he was the man they knew that he was the anointed bride he would be the anointed king soon not yet time time we struggle with time amen you know like this just a small example like I told Leno I said I don't think I can come right now and the next day there was many many thousands come into our bank account maybe I told him one day too soon time maybe May I'm not saying I did but you see what I mean time David waited on time wow those men of David recognized even when the the people around him should have recognized they recognized that David would be the coming King you sitting here this morning do you realize that you're going to be or already are the coming queen amen that's unbelievable do you know you're going to have servants in heaven you're going to say I like green grapes and I want them bake I want the ones that you know you got take two men to carry a Vine and and and just put one in about every two or three minutes make sure you clean them good think about that the Jews our Prophet said yeah will be our servants yes and and we we recognize that because we're not yet we struggle yeah let's look at what the prophet said he said did you notice how God moved Israel into his own anointed time now listen this is going to mean something Joshua waited for for time not how matter or how much the people might say it didn't make no difference to Joshua what the people say I mean he had the odds against them I mean wow couple million to two God gave us this land it's our Promised Land let us go now and take it and they said but Joshua you've lost your commission he said you're all washed up and I don't think you have the anointing now anymore they said this what the prop said why you won't even have nothing to do with the move of God probably some people's told you that before now how in the world when you were in the mind of God and came from God and God asked you permission to send you to Earth and and you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost how could you not have something to do with the plan of God hello you know I'm going to tell you something every one of you don't look for somebody else's approval that's right look for God's approval let God take care of the approving we don't need man's backing in your ministry we don't need man's approval on your salvation on your holy ghost on your election Hallelujah God's going to be this that's right yeah that's right because that's what affects you know when you get the measuring stick out and you start measuring well like I'm pretty good I'm pretty good s SP are you as good as me no no measure yourself to God get Christ out and say now Christ am I pretty good am I pretty good Christ don't measure yourself to each other cuz I'm a failure I was born in sin shaped in iniquity that's right don't lies all the time but see but but see I can see you so I say oh you know you know no no how do how do I measure up to God and you you might surprise yourself really strength if you have the baptism of Holy Ghost you're going to measure up really amazing you're going to be surprised how much God will encourage you you know who is the accuser of the Brethren it wasn't Jehovah uhhuh huh I'm not saying your brother is the devil that's accus I'm saying he's a spirit Spirits y who's the accuser of the brother God's not accusing you how could God accuse himself let that one sink in yeah did Jesus tell the Sadducees and Pharisees doesn't your own Bible say you are a God yeah oh when they picked up the Rocks woo yeah you make yourself more than you are why we know Mary and Joseph you know what the world's telling you you make yourself more than you are I know your past I remember when you were 16 oh I hope you don't remember when I was 16 you know what David cried in the Bible he said don't remember the sins of my youth I like I don't want to tell you my sins of my youth yes amen that's what David cried for don't hold the sins of my youth to my charge cuz I that'll be a really bad day if you did and you know what God has no intention of doing that because you're Justified as if you never did in the first place it wasn't the real you you were tricked into it by the accuser of the Brethren amen you are all washed up the people told Joshua why are you not why are you doing this you used to you used to have thus sayith the Lord in the moment and what was that the will of God but wise and here the godsent pro godsent Prophet knew the promise of God but he also knew that there he was waiting for the promise all we're doing this morning is waiting for the yet it's already yours you already H our deity you already have a throne you already have a robe Crown you already have a crown prepared I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also God's working on our Crown it'll just fit like a glove and all the stars that'll be on your crown will be the ones that you went and played the violin for that had plotted to take you out brother Dale couldn't do it hey hey Saul threw the javelin at David that's right just let that sink in if you think you can do it let's just go to pakist I was invited to India the guy called me twice we'll go to India where if you're caught baptizing you probably going to drown you if you think you if you think you're David and you can play the violin why Saul is planning to throw the javelin at you when you're not even paying attention to him then let's go to India let's go to Pakistan where it ain't safe that's right well if it's God's will you'll be safer there than here but you see do you see how do you see how how we're going to mature and come up into this this thing not only you're going to recognize that you're part of God but you're going to recognize that nothing nobody's opinion testimony NE you don't you know what faith is zero negativity you know we talked about faith on Wednesday night Faith can't be negative faith is always positive the Rapture is positive the Holy Ghost is positive you know serving God's positive like so you're you're breaking up you're you're confusing me you know God's not the author of confusion so you're professing that you're a message believer you're professing you got faith you're professing you got the baptism Holy Ghost but then you're negative and I've been there why why was I there maybe I didn't recognize maybe I was looking at the outside instead of the heart that's right maybe I was I maybe I wasn't looking at the anointing and the chosen I was looking at my own right thoughts maybe I was looking wow amen see The Parables he said when the time come God gave Joshua and those who stayed with him he said they gave it the word for he could not trust others God gave it to his chosen amen elected God is going to give something he's already G it to his chosen elected many are called called that's right but chosen elected he's already already glorified you so he already sees me in with my crown and and I I believe I I pray to God there's stars in there but do you see it do I see yours see that's that's the struggle we have I'm not sure I see yours maybe I should pray just another hour it helps me pray cuz brother Brown said prayer sweetens your spirit it sweetens your spirit and humbles you wow let's read our text again he said 1 Peter 2 and and I I had this scripture down and I read it first but 1 Peter 2 4 and 5 he said whom you as unto Living Stones dis allowed indeed of men now that could be men and women so right there the Bible is telling you don't look at a approval from me or the one sitting beside you now if you get it that's really cool but that's not the that's not the absolute no no but chosen of God do you know most of the people that were chosen of God and stuck their neck out as you would say the whole world turned against them and they look like cockoo they looked like they weren't home but they hadn't met Moses had met somebody and it wasn't no fire that burned in a bush cuz the bush didn't burn he had met a being and Moses didn't go down to I wonder if I will go in the Rapture I wonder if God Will Set Me Free from this ugly body Moses went back there chosen of God and precious now now why do you want my approval if God says you're precious why do you want your brothers or sisters approval if he says you're chosen there's no place in the Bible where you got to get somebody else's approval they may give it to you if they come to maturity also and and praise God that we can have that and that's nice I'm not saying that but when we come to maturity this is an individual Affair we're not Jews he didn't save us by the country he saved us by individual he works with Jews as a country but he works with you individual and you may be ahead of me or behind me but it's you and God that that he's appr proven and shown when he gives you the Revelation that you're elected predestinated all the devils and government and churches and ministers and money in the World couldn't change your opinion amen there's no way in the world that's why if a minister can make you if you if I can make you believe my Doctrine then the next guy can make you disbelieve it that's right but if I show you a Doctrine in the Bible and God says that's it am was it me that showed it to you blessed are you Simon B Jonah for I never he was standing right in front of God Jesus Christ yes who Am I by Flesh and Blood by my Father in Heaven has revealed this unto you and upon the revelation of the rock of Jehovah watch this even Jesus Christ was was showing how Peter's Revelation was from the Anointed God yes that's amen the anointed one hallelujah amen verse 5 of this scripture uh in 1 Peter 2 verse 5 ye also are living stones and are built a spiritual house that's your body a holy priesthood you know this is God that made you a priest Kings and Priests I don't if if God made me Kings and Priests I not really you know I'm sorry I I do like friends I do like partying but I'm not really concerned of your thoughts of me you know you know like some people like for example and I don't say this arrogant I I if I say it arrogant please forgive me I was never struggled with with uh low self-esteem and it that wasn't cuz I had it I don't mean that I I never struggled struggled with peer pressure I failed grade one and was in grade to took speech therapy and they made jokes of me in the bus and I laughed with them cuz I couldn't say m cow I said meow and they nicknamed me mow and I would laugh with the kid that's hilarious and they were picking on me and I didn't even clue into it now you think that's a funny joke that's exactly how you're supposed to be spiritually spiritually you know when I went to high school they could say anything they wanted to me I said I'll meet you outside and we'll sighten up the scar you you ain't going to push me around buddy it was cuz I was strong it was CU God had give me a block for a head or something you see what I mean but but no no no just go spiritually now you're looking at me funny but that's exactly how you're supposed to be with your relationship with Christ it was predestinated you have to have a revelation that you were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and nobody else's opion matters that's right period yeah yeah that's right amen when you get that Revelation you'll be a mighty Army it might be a one man woman or Army but step aside cuz there's a military coming through they say you you need to tell me you only brought like you know you know Jesus said you know get rid of all those men that that are afraid and then he said then go down to the creek and all the ones that slop like a dog get rid of them and just take the ones that he said I just want a few because I don't want you thinking that you had something to do with this brother Dale or brother or sister out there I don't want you to think that you had something to do with this well I don't want you to think you had something to do with this get rid of all the influence in your life amen and then let's throw on all the trials ouch do you know God said that he had to try you as fire to prove that the gold was in you and you know the says that you should just Rejoice say Glory Hallelujah somebody don't like me wo if somebody don't like me that's sure God a lot closer to liking me you're looking at me funny that's Bible I'm going to read the scripture I'm coming up to it it said you should rejoice and be exceeding crazy happy they never came to my party nobody likes me I think I'll go to Africa there's more people there to minister too you got low selfs spiritual esteem you need to raise your spiritual esteem man don't worry you you can't be arrogant spiritually you're miles below that I'll tell you you're a million miles below that you're wondering if you're even chosen he said we need to come into our placing and we'll go home and I'm about ready to go home and see if you recognize who you are you're going to start speaking to your mountains he saying step aside Mountain step aside Mountain Moses why are you crying to me just speak and go forward that's right I what what did what did they tell the prophet we have a Ministry he said I'm waiting to say what you say what do you want to say to say just step aside it wasn't brother Brown I'm coming through it was the god that was saying I'm waiting for what you will say God's waiting to say what will you say the god inside the Holy Ghost inside of you saying I am an invisible Army and he wants to hear you say you know believe with your heart but confess with your uhhuh but we have a silent religion if we had one mistake in this church an only one it's we're too quiet just make some noise for crying out loud amen believe you all believe with your heart but just say Glory maybe the person beside you will have a heart attack but it'll you'll be able to revive him back you'll just say okay brother it's all right I'm still here tell you what if you ever try something like that sometime the god that's living inside of you will lose his mind too he'll be like woo this this seed is breaking shell and I see a spt coming up to the es when [Music] Sunshine oh man oh man I feel like I could preach as in the days of Sodom the coming of the son of man so will it be when the son of man is revealed we are living in this time not no more the church or the bride but not no more the bride is called see it's the day that the son of man revealed I want to just tell you something the son of man is revealed we're not looking I'm not looking for a son of man I've already seen him I met him personally amen and he said I'm not looking to join the head of some organization but he said it's a uniting of a marriage with the bride the groom will come and call us right through this the son of man will come down he already has come down and he's living in human flesh and he's uniting himself together now this is in the promising of his word he's uniting himself together and the church has the word do do we have the Mysteries revealed were the seals open you know do you know the true water baptism do you know who you know there's no eternal hell do you know the Mysteries you know can we go on amen hallelujah amen he's United himself together to do that it'll take the manifestations of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman not a pastor not a preacher do you see what I mean here he said the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh it won't it's not a oneman Ministry no more forget about your favorite nothing you're your favorite you should be your favorite yourself cuz it's you and God yeah don't say well I love this no love yourself wait a minute now but you're dad so you're actually loving God so this this ain't no like self-love if you love it's loving the god that's inside of you you have to love the relationship you have with Jehovah inside of you that's right that's right amen that's right Hallelujah and she'll he's United himself with the bride and she'll go home for a wedding s supper she's United you're uniting already and you're we're going to go home for a supper so we have to come to this maturity where where brother Dale stops crying and I stop complaining we just say hallelujah you don't I mean sister PTY likes me that's a poor example but you know Hallelujah somebody don't like me but Jehovah I mean I was speaking to him this morning am man you got to Reon you got to recognize your connection with God we're looking at each other's approval you you think the approval of a Ministry is if he's got a thousand people in the shirt that's not approval amen we're looking at we're looking at things we can see but God but you you're you're a God you're supposed to be looking at your own heart wait your own heart and you're saying wow I remember being look at when we preach that message about job he said I remember where were you when I laid the foundations of the world I remember when God said let there be I was right there I was the finger the pointed whoa Glory he said she's already United amen and because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to be going to the wedding supper and see the word will unite the person and the two become one you know what I I I I'm afraid sometimes even brother Dale I tell you right pre and we we think we're Jews and we think we're only going to make it if if everybody's got approval of us you know what I'm saying God speaks to Israel as a nation we're not Israel God speaks to you individually that's right that's right and what he tells you it don't matter what I tell you it don't matter what somebody else tells you it don't matter what you're closest well I don't see it it's did you meet the pillar of fire yourself were you the Moses when he was right there and said take off your shoes you're messing up the ground can you imagine can you imagine the ground being so holy that his shoes were going to get the ground dirty [Music] yeah right Revelations 1:6 and Christ made us Kings you you got to put this up cuz nobody's going to believe us Vicki Vicki's actually going to set up my iPad and one of these days we're going to plug it into the TV and you can actually see my notes and everything will come up quotes and everything he said and Christ has now I put the Christ in there because he says he has made us Kings and if you read up further it says Jesus Christ and it's Christ has made you Kings and Priests that's not the five-fold ministry that's not the prophet that's not the people that don't like you or do like you yeah it's fine if you get somebody else's approval and brother Dale would be the first one to like that but I'm not preaching to get people's approval if the whole world don't like me I still know what God told me amen he's made you Kings and Priests unto God and his father and to him be glory and Dominion forever that's right watch this in the in the another quote here Harmony between God and Christ see he said in John 57 19 I mean they were one I mean it's not two gods or three Gods it means god is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth and and Christ is the anointed one that's what God is is Anointed Jehovah Gyra the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end but brother BR here recognizes that there were one and it showed the word life and he showed her and she received it that's talking about you and you never doubt it and nothing can harm you even death and if the seed was planted in you that's a revelation you need to have that's right if the seed was planted in you and the water comes down don't worry about the water God will take care of that amen and then it's got a great potential he says hallelujah he said here's the secret he said you are the word the word is in the bride and you have you know you are Christ it's not hard to believe you got the mind of Christ because you are Christ ah God uh let me see uh you know I was oh forgive me it this just came to me I was watching some false prophets you know that I shouldn't have but you know it shows us where the real is yeah you know you don't have to call God up the cell phone and say God you know what do you want me to do for orders you know let me give you an example you know when Jesus prayed he said you know father take this cup from me but not my will but yours be done who was he praying to you know sometimes as kids we tell our kids to look up cuz God's up there well he's up there too but he's down there too Jesus was praying to himself cuz he was God God was right inside of him so when I when I come to per I don't have to like look at brother Carson which would be a good examp Jared or brother Matt or or brother Lauren or brother Jim or anybody else I like Where's God let me see where's he's in the he's in the sign oh let's get a picture he's let me see let's get a he's in the pillow fire yeah he's in the pillow fire but he's in the bush too he's in the that Moses took off he's in let me see he's in the wind he he was in the darkness he was in the cloud he's in me so when I pray I don't say oh dear Cloud dear Lord Cloud please hear my prayer Cloud I'm not knocking the cloud he was that was the head that was God that was Jehovah but Jehovah is right in here i' say you're Jehovah I need an answer and I'm praying to myself that's why I'm talking to myself I don't need to that's why God said don't you don't have to worry about w we have all this message vocabulary and it's perfectly fine but God's not impressed by your message vocabulary he said don't be like the Sadducees and Pharisees that because of their message bab think that God will answer their prayer better than a little tiny child if I wanted to real answer a prayer I'd go to the youngest kid in here say they pray for me because they have faith that we don't fat people people don't have you know when my hay barn started on fire and God it didn't it was fire that couldn't burn you know God's the same yesterday today and forever just in case you don't know that if you want to come to my house I'll show you the posted scir I never declared the insurance never lost nothing and all that but it was a little silus praying that was like eight years ago that was when we first came in here it was his prayer that May Fire not burn but we said well blast God when we having a big evangelist come you know who's coming to preach our company it's a big popular man we should have Silas preach the camp meeting we should have little Isaiah preach the camp meeting and we'll let Zoe sing the songs with Leah that's right oh you think God a you think God can you're not even converted yet the Bible says that if you don't become like the little you won't even be there so you know show me anywhere in the Bible where it says the ministry has an age limit Jesus was a young boy when he was in the Tabernacle and he confused them all crazy with the word of God it was it they don't have roadblocks they haven't lived long enough to learn to doubt like are of your kids here like brother Bernard are your kids woring if you're going to have enough money to feed them today they they they wouldn't even know what you're even talking about that's right food that's right am cuz they you know what watch this watch this watch this this is as fresh as it'll get when you're born you're not born with doubt are kids born without when you were born is a is a what the natural types of spirit when you were born a little baby were you afraid that your mother wouldn't take care of you so you were born spiritually were you afraid that God wouldn't take care of you when you were first born spiritually but now you got everything and you and you you fill in the blank you've matured so much that you've learned how to doubt hello true learned how to hello that's not the type of matur we're talking about wow God help me if that's what maturity is oh I want to decrease so he can increase watch this here continue this quote he said they do only his will that's talking about you he said and no one can persuade them differently if if somebody can persuade you differently that God ain't living in inside you don't watch this you say well they didn't persuade me but they discouraged me wait a minute that's the same thing if you go home from here and you're discouraged because something didn't happen the way you thought then I just have one little question for you how was God discouraged how could the anointed one be discouraged how could the elected already glorified chosen priesthood kingship be discouraged so you let somebody else bring you down yes they have thus sayith the Lord that means you don't you have thus sayith the Lord that means you that you know what that means that means you'll have the character of Christ so you'll play the violin for the person that hates you and those kind of people God's Not Afraid of give them lots of authority God can just dump Authority on them because you have thus sayith the Lord or you'll be still and you will only do God's work for it's himself that's continuing to I got a punchline here that this is unbelievable this is the spoken word The Original Seed a 62 quote he said you know Jesus Christ when he was on Earth did not fulfill or finish his work on Earth that's right that's right and so you are doing it yeah am amen and how can you do it if oh oh man oh man they didn't oh man I'm hard done by he says here he didn't complete it in his days and all those things that when was here he said he did not complete them when he was here he actually repeats it and so it because it wasn't the time yet it's for you to do them that's right ain't that amazing First Corinthians and we're we're getting down to here near the I think we are we're doing pretty good 1 Corinthians 6 2 he said do you not know that you shall judge the world how could you be press like the whole world's going to be your foot stol but you're you're sad because you haven't recognized doesn't it verse three it says don't you know that you should judge the Angels the Holy Angels the angel that came down and told Mary you are highly favored and chosen among women you're going to judge them and you're having a hard time amen verse 19 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which is in you right now the Holy Ghost is in you what's that make you which ye have of God and ye are not no more your own Revelations 19 6 and9 Revelations 196 29 and I heard as it were a voice of great multitudes and of many Waters as it was a voice of many Thunder you know Thunder in the Bible is God's word you know you know when the seals were open and it talks about the Thunders and that that was the the seals was the written word the Thunder was God's voice it wasn't the Written Letter the Thunder was just the tone of The Voice that's right God did that he didn't do that for my purpose Jesus said he did it so you could hear some heard a thunder it was God speaking this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased serve him amen saying hallelujah he said God omnipotent reth verse 7 and let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and her wife has made her self ready verse 21 and it's granted that well just's finish that verse 8 and it was granted that she should be a raid and clean fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints though so what's it really matter what the devil tells you if you have a revelation of who you are what's it really matter what your brother or sister or somebody from a different planet or church or area or or amen Revelations 21:9 here John talking of course he said and it came unto me the seven angels which were the seven vows full of the seven plagues and talked to me saying come up hither and I'll show you the bride the Lamb's wife amen watch this you know and I'm going to go through this quick we're just quarter 12 amen there's just sry he said watch here in the scriptures brother B about Moses was anointed chosen Prophet it didn't matter what people thought of him amen Moses was waiting you know God said that he testified that Moses was chosen and it wasn't that Moses had to wait on his ministry but God was waiting on the Israelite people to get ready for Moses's Ministry wow Elijah was a Vindicated anointed Prophet chosen we see John the Baptist was a forerunner faithful anointed prophet and you are the same thing today amen it's just different placings amen you are the anointed bride wife of Christ you need to recognize the Royal PRI of the the Kings and Priests that God expects in you amen not that he expects in you that he spoke implied in you here and Lord show us the father and suffice us he says he says and that's the way it is with Christians today we're planted together in Christ and who is the ex exhaust inexhaustible Fountains of life and you're planted in Christ and all you got to do is drink and push out and everything you have need of this should give you great hope I'm not trying this is not a discouraging message this if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're sealed by Jehovah and you were in his thoughts and you know Jesus said in the Bible he said no man go to heaven but first he came down from heaven and he'll Ascend back up into heaven everything you have need of in this journey is here now everything we have need of in the Earthly Journey Divine Healing power of God and all these things and every individual here has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you what are you looking for what you're looking for is false because if you already once you got Jehovah the I am your provider you you have everything he said he said everything you have watch he finishes this he says in this quote he says this is uh he says everything you have need of including the Rapture is inside of you right now I'm not looking for rapturing face I already have rapturing face and more than rapturing face I have rapturing Grace because he loved me when I was ugly amen he loved me before I was even or thought of he loved me before I knew I was I before the foundation of the world I have rapturing Grace it's unmerited unworthy amen he said don't resist that the Rapture is in us now he said I can prove it by the the Bible That's Romans 8 I believe 32 he said those he called he justified and those he justified he's already glorified amen John 3 I'm trying to hurry John 31:13 verily verily I say you that we speak that we speak that we do know you need to have some nose you need to know that you're ready to go it don't matter what happens to me later today or this week or next week and you don't have to have a big funeral over me I'm going to well we won't go into that but you know what I'm saying I have to know I have an experience I met somebody I do know and testify what I have seen and you do and ye do not receive my witness so I'm not talking about you he's talking about the world watch what he tells the world he said if I had told you wor these things and you believe me not how I'm going to tell you spiritual things if I if I tell you Earthly things and say God will take care of your finances and and you know he he'll provide needs and you have trouble believing that how are you going to go on the Rapture I'm going to tell you spiritual things God already sees you already there already in the Rapture it's done history to him he he's watched the movie verse 13 for no man ascendeth up into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven right now and here Jesus was standing right in front of them and Jesus told the first lie there wasn't a lie and he said that he was in heaven but he was sented on Earth you want me to tell you what that is I'm going to tell you another lie like Jesus said I'm already in heaven you said but wait a minute you're preaching to me no I'm my my spirit's already there it's not I hope I go there I'm already there I'm already there when you say but I can see your body well you can see Jesus body amen Hebrews 11:1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen now we mentioned this and I want to just close with just a couple thing I think I'm I got to see the end here soon oh my goodness sorry I want to just touch on a couple things you know I I'm I'm going to go fast on these quotes but this is in the token message he said your faith is common you're looking for something super and it's a dandelion weed it's his up it's everywhere he said you're looking for Supernatural Faith this is a quote in the token this is a 64 quote by the way in in paragraph 18 He said you're looking for something Supernatural I'm not I already am Supernatural what am I looking for something that I already got you're already Supernatural you wouldn't be here this morning if you weren't Supernatural cuz not only crazy men drive two hours or an hour to go hear somebody that's uneducated and don't know what he's talking about but God knows what he's talking about if you think it's me preaching to you you should you shouldn't have wasted your gas coming here this morning he said you're looking for some Supernatural some kind of Supernatural face he said it's not Supernatural face he said it's common face he actually said there's not two levels of Faith it's just Faith it's just Faith you believe God s took away your sins but you don't think you can go in the Rapture well there's not two levels of Fai you you are are you AR yeah it's just like just go grab a dandelion and put the token over your door the H up and grew everywhere in Jerusalem that's what he says I I can't finish reading that because it's it's common that's what the to says Hebrews 12 5 and 8 5 to8 Hebrews 12 for ye are forgotten the exot help me out honey exhortation which I speak unto you is unto children my my son despise thou not the chaste th oh this is you know if you're a son God will correct you amen now God a all I mean by this is recognize who you are this is just God's son so when we talked in the early of the services if you're going through a trial you should say wooo I'm looking for proof I had a hard week well praise the Lord you don't have to go he ain't bothering me sister D it first praise the Lord I heard amen you when you see those trials you should re be exceedingly glad say Glory I'm chosen Glory I'm a king did you ever see a king that never had a headache he say oh why did I run for politics amen God will prove your your anointing and not by the trials but how you handle them amen hallelujah already mentioned about David encouraged himself Samuel skip that amen oh wow we're we're we're there amen let's just read and believe it from the heart he said God takes his children and tests them watch what now this is God so if you're having a hard time don't blame me God tests his child with acid test that's ACI D why does he do that well don't ask me ask God he's proven to you who you are and I'm trying to tell you that if things if you're still waiting on seeing all the things that I've showed you this morning that you are it's God proven it's Vindication that you'll be there but you say well I don't think I can make it that's proof that you'll be there the ones that know they AR you you wouldn't even have that feeling if you weren't already there amen watch this he said he does AIT test and when he places them into the body Christ because he had to test you that they believe he went through these trials they went through these trials and had these experiences and they witness and they are witnesses of his and they know that we're talking about now not just an election not just electional concept but they were born again precious Holy Spirit timed tested and tried until their soul was set like a Flint towards Calvary and yes they were tested but they were Witnesses of his power why are you still here you are witnesses to the power of Christ amen you've had your own battles he said he said though that God built it's like God built a bridge in heaven and it's a fairway for the people he said and you he s he give a place for you to sit under the tree and cool off amen God proven God proven to Satan that you're his my last scripture and quote here Matthew 5 1 and 2 and we're going to close seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain and when he was sit down his disciples came unto him and he said and he opened his mouth and he taught them saying I put that scripture down for you to lay the foundation of where we're at blessed are ye when you're persecuted now Jesus was telling the Believers that now they weren't sitting on pews they were sitting on the mountain side like kind of like we're going to be in Camp you know and on the nice green grass and the breeze is blowing through you can hear the rustle of the leaves and she said talk a little louder because of it Jesus saying that when you see that in your your own life it proves that you're elected it proves that you're chosen it proves that you're Royal it proves that you're a king and and Satan says oh see I told you God don't think much of you because you're feeling down no he's a liar amen verse 11 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad glad for greatest your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets it's actually you know being a Believer being part of the Bride being a wife being being Christ anointed it you're you it's just the time yet you're in you're in the proving stage but you already have that Authority and you're going to step into your throne and the Earth will be your foot stol and you're going to have a robe on and Christ is going to put the crown on your head in God's mind that's already completely finished but you can't see it and even worse than that the people that are beside you that you think are your friends they definitely can't see it well that's just that's just you know let's go see this great over here you know I preached that a few weeks ago you know if they say well Jesus is he's over in the desert no he ain't how could he be over there he's in me and they say well he's in the Holy place no he ain't you're you're running over there to see him he he's ready inside you forget about it being in me you're going to see Christ and you're packing him it's a lie of the Devil he's got you going in circles spitting your wheels you think well I got to call the and I mean it's good to pray for one another and I mean a Unity of prayer and I mean you bring all our licks of fire and we have a great big holy bonfire I believe in all that but you are you have the same power something happens to you you know if you're going down you know that some of the ridiculous things that people believe like you know the the people that put a bun on their head or a cap on their head and they don't believe the ladies could pray without a cap I I asked the one brother I said so you know you're driving with your wife and your family down the road and you go off the road and you hit a tree and her cop falls off and you're dying and the kids are strangle into death but your wife can't pray I said I don't want a god like that I I don't want a God that's tied to caps on my head and tied to ties around my neck I hate ties around my neck I don't want a god like that like what if my tie chokes me and I take it off and then then I lost my God are you kidding and that's what that's the same Spirit when you think you got to go somewhere else to find a bigger or better or stronger Faith or something Supernatural you are deceived you are deceived or or you're unconverted because if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you just need to take a mirror go just hang on oh wow pretty good I'll show my best side cuz did that is is that what the Bible says you're packing the god that you're going to drive and see amen wow amen let's stand amen God man if we you know brother Bown said that heaven would be the noisiest place you have ever been and if I had a prayer request I would pray that you know the Bible says that we're in Heavenly places now that means we need noise I I mean not just noise I I know you know what I'm but you see what if you recognize what God before the foundation of the world thought and thinks of you you talk about being not struggling with with depression your buttons would be popping yeah your head would be so Bak you would need a crutch to hold it up that's what God thinks of you that what what's wow it's a powerful anointing the Bible says that the least comely Parts have double double honor double say oh well that's just that that's just that double if Satan's telling you this morning you're just no I can't do nothing for you know the girl saying but you can pray I can't really do nothing for the kingdom of God God ain't called me to some Supernatural man that's a liar y y That's Right double double double H Satan is a liar he's stepping on you and squashing you you need to punch him in the nose devil oh I can't I'm not really part of the body I'm poor and I don't have a Ministry and and I'm I'm living in a in a cabin and and I can't really do nothing and double double double Bram said the success of his meanings were a couple sisters fasting and praying double double don't let Satan lie to you next time Satan says you're not nothing special you tell him I'm the queen of the king of the universe I'm wearing a royal crown and I got pure diamond gold on my head step aside the bride's coming through I'd sing that song Angels step aside they sang that multiple times in El Salvador Angels step aside because the bride of Christ is coming to the front you realize people are going to fall to their knees as you judge the Earth you don't think so well what did they do for Joseph every knee will bow and every tongue will confess to the spirit of God forget about this fleshly body it'll be the god that's in you there going to be people can you imagine you walking down the street and people just falling over dropping their knees that's what they did to Joseph and the Holy Ghost hadn't even been given yet you need to take the broadcast of Satan and put plugs in it say
