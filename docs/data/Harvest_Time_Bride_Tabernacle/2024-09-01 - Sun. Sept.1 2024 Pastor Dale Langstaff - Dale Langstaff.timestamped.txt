[42:48] the closing of the convention there in
[42:51] Ottawa and they'll be traveling here and
[42:53] preaching for John Dana on Wednesday all
[42:56] these things amen let's turn to Psalms
[42:59] 511 and I want to just uh something that
[43:04] I I I'm not sure if I'll get through it
[43:06] but I'm going to do what God tells me to
[43:09] do and and something that uh if I don't
[43:12] get through it
[43:14] um God help us to understand that we'll
[43:17] preach it twice amen I want to look into
[43:21] something here and tell that that your
[43:25] joy is in the Lord
[43:27] Lord your joy is in the
[43:30] Lord hallelujah but let those that put
[43:33] their trust in thee the Lord rejoice and
[43:37] let them
[43:39] shout for
[43:41] Joy because thou defend them and let
[43:46] them also that love thy name be
[43:51] joyful in thee now now that's
[43:55] powerful that don't say that when you're
[43:58] having trials you can change your
[44:00] joy I don't say that when something goes
[44:04] wrong your joy never changes and and
[44:06] that was amazing when I was studying
[44:08] let's just read that again and let those
[44:10] that put their trust in the Lord
[44:15] Rejoice now I want to ask you this a
[44:17] question this morning he says what you
[44:19] have does anybody else
[44:24] want what you got and what you testify
[44:27] of and your life is anybody else in the
[44:30] world trying to be exactly like you now
[44:34] I want to give you an example you know
[44:35] like when Hollywood if they have a star
[44:38] or a hockey player everybody will buy
[44:40] his T-shirt with his name on
[44:42] it or like if somebody sings and they
[44:44] hold the mic like this or like
[44:46] this and then everybody that worships
[44:48] that person they sing the same
[44:53] way so those people want to be like the
[44:56] other people but is there anybody in the
[44:59] world want to be exactly like
[45:03] you wow and let them shout now that's
[45:08] that's that's pretty loud for Joy
[45:11] because thou defend this them now that
[45:15] means we have absolutely zero worry and
[45:18] let them also that love the Lord his
[45:22] name be
[45:24] joyful in thee Lord Jesus I pray that
[45:28] somehow through my scrambled words that
[45:30] you'll you'll portray to the your bride
[45:33] of Christ here the the thoughts and the
[45:37] I the the the desire that you had when
[45:40] you give this to me Lord Jesus and we
[45:43] give you the glory for it and all of
[45:45] eternity and Lord I pray that you'll
[45:47] change me continue to change me daily
[45:50] Lord Jesus to your perfect statue that
[45:54] you've seen Lord Jesus before the
[45:56] foundation of the world we give you the
[45:58] glory for it in your name amen amen you
[46:01] may have your seats I want to show you
[46:04] something here you in the
[46:06] Bible Joy or joyful is mentioned
[46:11] 430
[46:13] times but happy and
[46:17] happiness is mentioned
[46:21] 10 and I would have never thought of the
[46:24] difference many times we would compare
[46:26] joy to happiness but it's not the same
[46:30] not even
[46:32] close amen not as a Believer it's not
[46:35] even close see Joy has characteristics
[46:38] for God's people for God's wife that's
[46:41] found in his presence see a Believer has
[46:46] Joy because they know their position in
[46:50] Christ it don't matter what falls down
[46:52] around us it don't matter if your house
[46:54] burns or it don't burn it don't matter
[46:56] if you have a flag Tire or don't burn
[46:58] you're it don't change the bottom line
[47:00] is you came from God and if you came
[47:03] from God you're going back to God and
[47:05] what happens in this world whether you
[47:07] obtain riches or wealth or favor of men
[47:10] or not favor of men it don't change the
[47:12] bottom line at all it don't matter if
[47:14] you have 10,000 people in this church or
[47:16] 10 people in this church I came from God
[47:19] and when God reveals that to you your
[47:21] position in
[47:25] Christ you can have joy you know and I
[47:29] I'm going to jump way ahead the Bible
[47:31] says that Christ through even though he
[47:33] realized the the pain of the Cross and
[47:36] asked his heavenly father to take it
[47:39] from him for the joy that was set before
[47:44] him there not a lot of joy in the cross
[47:47] endured the cross and the shame and the
[47:52] the the failure that everybody present
[47:55] would have considered that cross
[47:57] but he
[47:59] knew who he was he knew his position he
[48:04] knew he was Jehovah so it had an anchor
[48:07] of
[48:09] Joy Hallelujah you know why nobody's
[48:12] rushing to the
[48:15] gospel I don't know one person in the
[48:18] world that's negative that people are
[48:21] rushing to be around you know me and Lan
[48:23] went to a funeral this week and this is
[48:25] kind of a community joking so I don't
[48:27] expect you to get it but we were in the
[48:30] community and there's a person in the
[48:32] neighborhood that is just chronic
[48:36] negative Ju Just chronic
[48:40] negative if you knew the whole story it
[48:44] would make you chuckle he had three
[48:46] years crop of beans in the bin because
[48:49] he couldn't sell them he had so much
[48:50] money he was a retired school teacher
[48:53] and his wife was a something they have
[48:56] huge itions they have more money than
[48:58] they could possibly
[49:00] spent but there's never a positive word
[49:03] that comes out of that person's
[49:05] mouth and it was so bad that he caught
[49:07] me at the funeral home he will go out of
[49:09] his way to share his negativity he he's
[49:11] a very good minister of the Gospel that
[49:14] he believes in negativity and he had
[49:17] caught me and my beautiful wife had came
[49:18] from chadam and she caught me and she
[49:20] took my hand and she understood the
[49:22] situation that I was in and she was like
[49:25] Hallelujah yeah let's keep going and I
[49:29] got in the funeral
[49:31] line and the biggest business in dresen
[49:34] is Dennis Jackson that owns Jackson
[49:36] seeds and he came and he he skipped a
[49:39] whole bunch of people and he said Dale I
[49:41] seen you got caught
[49:43] by that positive
[49:48] person see in his life he never ever had
[49:52] anything that he could be joyful
[49:55] about do you know we we don't believe
[49:58] that the the the righteous men the
[49:59] footsteps are ordered of the Lord if
[50:02] your children backside it's part of
[50:03] God's plan they can't be lost if they
[50:06] were in his hand you know if you if you
[50:09] get sick it was part of God's plan CU
[50:10] God couldn't heal people that aren't
[50:12] sick and so praise God I'm sick and I'm
[50:14] not dead yet you know it used to say
[50:17] people would say how are you and they
[50:18] say well I'm on I'm on the right side of
[50:20] the sod you can just be happy about
[50:23] everything praise God it's raining too
[50:25] much this year
[50:27] they figure the bean crop will be really
[50:29] big even though there's killo spots if
[50:31] we get no rain at all does it really
[50:33] matter do you know with the funeral that
[50:35] we went to I worked for those people it
[50:37] was my first job and I was working for
[50:39] them in the 80s in ' 84 and ' 85 does
[50:42] anybody remember that time was anybody
[50:45] born in 84 85 put your hand up if
[50:49] anybody was older me an 84 and 85 I'll
[50:52] guarantee you you got a good memory of
[50:53] that because that's when interest went
[50:54] to 24% at the bank
[50:58] and I remember those people struggling
[51:01] and scrimping and splitting
[51:04] pennies to run a
[51:07] business yes sir I remember them telling
[51:10] us hired men that every time they made a
[51:12] pain at payment at the bank they lowered
[51:15] their Equity so they were still in our
[51:18] rear that's what
[51:20] happened use young people that don't
[51:23] know when when when you get older and
[51:24] you get gray hair and your parents try
[51:26] to warn you of something it's because
[51:27] they lived an experience before you I
[51:30] had Farmers tell me that when they
[51:32] bought a farm it was valued for $100,000
[51:34] and they'd pay 10,000 off it and Farm
[51:36] Credit say it's only worth 80 now so
[51:38] they'd pay another 10 now it's only
[51:40] worth
[51:41] 70 and they'd force them into
[51:45] bankruptcy cuz see you're only wealthy
[51:47] if somebody tells you you're
[51:51] wealthy
[51:52] hello you're only wealthy if the people
[51:55] in the government or in business tell
[51:58] you you're wealthy but that's not how
[52:00] Christianity
[52:04] is amen I I'm going to go and I'm going
[52:08] to close out when Israel was in bondage
[52:10] and they were in
[52:12] slavery and the prophet talked about
[52:14] that and and they could have the Bible
[52:16] says that the the strength of the Lord
[52:18] was the the joy of the Lord was their
[52:20] strength and they were in slavery and
[52:23] Jerusalem was destroyed their walls were
[52:26] knocked down their Gates were burned and
[52:28] the and the the the the the top men of
[52:31] Israel were serving the enemy
[52:35] King but they could their shoulders back
[52:38] and know that I know who my papa is and
[52:41] I'm not in my homeland yet man and it's
[52:44] all burned over and and amen and we
[52:48] ain't got
[52:49] everything but I know it's coming I know
[52:53] it's here I know it's available
[53:00] and his Joy was so powerful that when he
[53:04] served the king now you can read this in
[53:06] Nehemiah the second chapter when he
[53:08] served the king his wine the king picked
[53:11] up his
[53:14] Joy
[53:17] wow oh bless God I don't have a very
[53:20] good
[53:21] job I need a raise
[53:30] you're letting your outward
[53:33] feelings rob you of your Eternal
[53:36] joy and nobody else wants
[53:41] it amen back to this community joke the
[53:46] man that came back to visit me and
[53:48] realize that I had been caught because
[53:50] he had also been caught see people that
[53:52] have bad news like spread in
[53:54] it people that got good news don't
[53:57] spread it at
[53:58] all why are you keeping the joy of your
[54:01] salvation to
[54:02] yourself cuz see this person in the
[54:05] Dresden area had also caught Dennis
[54:08] Jackson and he had to escape for his
[54:11] life too amen and when he come back to
[54:14] me you know you see how people never
[54:18] want to be around that kind of an
[54:20] attitude you know brother Bram said it
[54:22] like this he saidou know the farmer went
[54:24] forth and sold wheat
[54:27] somebody else came forward and sold
[54:28] Cocker birs and
[54:31] weeds and when it came and we're going
[54:33] to I'm going to bring you that quote I'm
[54:35] just I'm just skimming from it from
[54:36] memory from studying but he said exactly
[54:40] what nature was in your seed you know I
[54:43] preached a message and brother Carson
[54:44] picked up on it later I preached a
[54:46] message about what's in your cup and you
[54:49] you mentioned about a year later and
[54:50] that was a long time ago but whatever is
[54:53] in you will come out of you and so if
[54:56] you're a Cocker you're going to fuss
[54:58] fume complain disgust brother Brown says
[55:00] it just like that I I'll read it later
[55:02] on fuss fume complain everything's wrong
[55:05] nobody's right oh the president lost and
[55:09] oh we got a
[55:11] terrible you should say praise God for
[55:14] our government hallelujah we're going
[55:15] home soon Glory I hope they bankrupt the
[55:19] country Glory I hope I lose that farm
[55:22] because I know my redeemer liveth
[55:26] I know that's crazy but don't wake me
[55:31] up because this is an eternal
[55:34] hope amen
[55:37] happiness unlike happiness true Joy
[55:42] satisfies Joy the Bible describes joy as
[55:46] full and
[55:49] complete Joy is not just for a short
[55:51] period of
[55:53] time it's it's it's a decision
[55:57] and a
[55:59] lifestyle
[56:02] ien I mean I can only use the examples
[56:05] that I was raising my daddy was a born
[56:07] farmer I mean as far back as history has
[56:10] it my parents grandparents on both sides
[56:13] of every even me and thew were
[56:16] farmers and my dad lived through
[56:19] droughts that he didn't have to bother
[56:21] combining the
[56:24] crop and he lived through bounties
[56:26] and he lived through strength but he was
[56:28] joyful to tell you I'm a
[56:32] farmer it wasn't all sunshine and
[56:36] Roses
[56:41] amen the world that has no hope is
[56:45] living in disaster
[56:48] state but you're letting some we're
[56:52] guilty it's it you God help us you know
[56:56] that we don't let our circumstances drag
[56:59] us
[57:00] down you know what I mean like you know
[57:02] like you have prayer meeting you say oh
[57:05] man church starts at 10: I got to wake
[57:07] up well praise God you can wake up and
[57:10] praise God that you have a church and it
[57:12] actually
[57:13] starts but see how we are we say oh I
[57:17] was or oh it's Wednesday and I I really
[57:20] don't have the heart to go but but you
[57:24] could not have a choice of going you
[57:26] could live in North Korea or you know
[57:28] one of these places where you wouldn't
[57:30] be allowed to go or you could live in a
[57:31] place where there is no church to go to
[57:33] at all or you could just flat out be Dad
[57:36] or not even a
[57:39] believer you see how you know people
[57:42] they pray for a job you don't watch oh
[57:44] Lord give me a job and they like oh I
[57:45] wish I could have Friday off I wish
[57:50] I you
[57:52] know people are looking for a family and
[57:55] Families will come there their promise
[57:58] and Heritage for God and I was telling
[58:00] somebody about people that we know and I
[58:03] said you watch well I'll give you an
[58:06] example and we know them very well
[58:08] praise God and by the way I'll stop
[58:10] right here and say brother Jeff and
[58:11] sister Doma their a their offer on the
[58:15] house by us got
[58:17] accepted and so it'll be a piece of cake
[58:19] for God to sell their house in Kitchener
[58:21] that's I mean that's not hard at all
[58:23] right for remember how I said it God
[58:26] to sell amen you know I remember when
[58:30] Jeff and dobl were crying for
[58:35] babies it'll be no time at all and
[58:37] they'll be crying to stop
[58:41] them you
[58:46] see you see how we are
[58:49] so flimy and change on our happiness
[58:56] God help us he said Joy satisfies in a
[58:59] way that temporary H happiness will
[59:01] never satisfy sorrow and suffering will
[59:04] come to pass but do Joy continues in
[59:07] spite of
[59:09] hardship Eternal Joy is promised to come
[59:13] and it doesn't matter what the situation
[59:16] is
[59:19] amen you know you we want to be careful
[59:22] what we ask for and pray for God help us
[59:25] you know I can remember remember th this
[59:27] is a bit of an inside joke for me but I
[59:29] can remember before Co I was Desiring to
[59:32] feed a bunch of
[59:34] cattle I wish I wouldn't have had that
[59:37] desire cuz God knew Co was coming and
[59:40] the bottom fell right out of
[59:44] them you see what I mean in every
[59:47] situation you just say oh praise God I
[59:50] got cattle but they're not worth
[59:53] nothing well don't change our Eternal
[59:55] destination
[59:56] it does it change anything back to back
[59:59] to the I I got cut off of this thing
[1:00:01] back to this my first job and this lady
[1:00:03] had died she was uh what was she 68 two
[1:00:06] years younger than my oldest brother and
[1:00:09] far younger than my sister that makes me
[1:00:11] nervous when your siblings start dying
[1:00:13] that's H that means that you know you're
[1:00:15] getting close to the
[1:00:16] mark and I told you how they used to
[1:00:19] scramp in that and we come home from the

[1:02:27] he had Joy he said Jesus looking to the
[1:02:30] AER and finisher of his faith who for
[1:02:32] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:02:35] the cross despising the shame and sat
[1:02:38] down at the right hand of the father on
[1:02:41] the
[1:02:42] throne amen do you recognize your
[1:02:46] position in
[1:02:48] Christ and you're
[1:02:51] depressed that's
[1:02:53] impossible the two don't go together
[1:02:56] man let's look at some scriptures and
[1:02:58] some of these scriptures and we're going
[1:02:59] to go fastly through some of them but
[1:03:01] some of them I'm going to show you what
[1:03:03] the prophet said to this exact scripture
[1:03:07] here in Psalms 518 and 12 it
[1:03:11] said make me to hear the joy and
[1:03:13] gladness that the bones which thou H has
[1:03:16] broken May Rejoice now here's David you
[1:03:21] know David wasn't always in Perfection
[1:03:24] and God had to spank
[1:03:26] him and he's rejoicing in his spanking
[1:03:30] says praise the Lord I got a mama
[1:03:32] that'll spank me Hallelujah I got a
[1:03:35] Daddy That'll correct me would you
[1:03:38] rather not have one of the
[1:03:41] either verse 12 he said restore on
[1:03:43] here's David talking right after he's
[1:03:48] commanding of God breaking his bones he
[1:03:51] said restore unto me the joy of my
[1:03:54] salvation and uphold hold me with thy
[1:03:57] free
[1:03:59] spirit saying that the Holy Spirit was a
[1:04:02] free spirit and restore now watch this
[1:04:05] this is how the the brother Brown said
[1:04:07] it said you notice that brother uh
[1:04:09] brother Brown saying this about David he
[1:04:11] said you know that David never said give
[1:04:13] me my salvation the joy of my salv but
[1:04:17] he said restore it he hadn't lost his
[1:04:20] salvation he he had been a Messi
[1:04:23] believer and he was a drag
[1:04:32] oh bless
[1:04:41] God and everybody cleared out and went
[1:04:44] to the Pentecostal Church could you
[1:04:45] blame
[1:04:47] them you needed counseling to come to a
[1:04:49] message
[1:04:53] church because they were see d David was
[1:04:56] asking for the joy of what God had
[1:04:58] already gave him give me back you've
[1:05:01] already given me my salvation you've
[1:05:03] already give me the truth but give me
[1:05:05] the joy of all the Revelation that God
[1:05:08] has proed to us in this day give me the
[1:05:11] joy that you've taken the scales off my
[1:05:14] eyes and I can read the Bible like a
[1:05:17] brand new book and I can see my name
[1:05:19] here in Ephesians 1 and Romans 8 and I
[1:05:22] can see myself everywhere in the book
[1:05:25] Genesis 1 126 to
[1:05:28] 27 the
[1:05:31] Jo
[1:05:33] huh we should be recklessly
[1:05:39] Joyful recklessly Joyful well Hallelujah
[1:05:43] I ain't got enough money to pay the
[1:05:45] bills Hallelujah I got bills must mean
[1:05:48] I'm
[1:05:53] breathing but you don't oh oh I got my
[1:05:56] hydro bill I got my gas
[1:06:10] bill
[1:06:15] Hallelujah here David and I'm just
[1:06:18] paraphrasing to speed up and this isn't
[1:06:21] why cry but speak David was asking for
[1:06:24] the joy of his salvation what God had
[1:06:26] already given and he said taste and see
[1:06:30] that the Lord is good that's Psalms
[1:06:34] 348 taste and see as the Lord as good as
[1:06:36] not
[1:06:37] unjoy amen and taste and see it tastes
[1:06:40] like the Honey in the Rock is Psalms
[1:06:43] 81:16 you know David was an amazing
[1:06:47] believer an amazing
[1:06:50] believer Hallelujah the Honey in the
[1:06:53] Rock he was singing all these things how
[1:06:55] God was so full he was so full inside he
[1:06:59] said David said this he said my cup
[1:07:02] runneth over surely goodness and
[1:07:05] mercy will follow me all the days of my
[1:07:09] life Hallelujah David was losing the
[1:07:13] kingdom to his son and man he had some
[1:07:16] major
[1:07:18] problems but the joy of the
[1:07:21] Lord God help us
[1:07:26] Hallelujah here brother bram's given an
[1:07:28] altar call and he saidis there no bomb
[1:07:31] in
[1:07:32] Gilead he said this could be your last
[1:07:36] chance to testify of the joy of the Lord
[1:07:40] in your
[1:07:42] life he said the holy spirit's
[1:07:45] here and if you've Fallen weak or
[1:07:48] lukewarm and in your experience you'd
[1:07:51] like to renew it Again David said
[1:07:53] restore unto me the joy of myself
[1:07:56] ation and he said he had lost his
[1:07:59] joy and I think it goes about
[1:08:03] 95% of the message churches
[1:08:08] today they lost their
[1:08:10] joy and nobody wants to be like
[1:08:15] you because you forgot your
[1:08:20] smile
[1:08:21] amen he said oh here's another one he
[1:08:23] said you'll go through trials and
[1:08:25] troubles and ups and downs and
[1:08:27] misunderstandings and that don't have
[1:08:28] one thing to do with it he said when
[1:08:30] Israel had backslid and they were down
[1:08:32] in Egypt and there were Bo they never
[1:08:35] lost their
[1:08:36] Covenant but they lost their
[1:08:39] joy and he said David you know he's
[1:08:42] repeating David hadn't asked for the but
[1:08:45] just to restore the joy of his
[1:08:48] salvation his salvation
[1:08:51] remained but he went off on the wrong
[1:08:55] end and lost the joy of his
[1:08:58] salvation God help
[1:09:01] us God help us in this day you know
[1:09:04] we're going to be squeezed more than we
[1:09:06] are
[1:09:09] today and are you struggling
[1:09:12] now then how are you going to witness to
[1:09:15] anybody and say I have something better
[1:09:17] than you
[1:09:18] have but I'm more depressed than
[1:09:23] you really
[1:09:29] I want to show you some examples of why
[1:09:32] we had the right to be recklessly
[1:09:37] joyful is that all right recklessly
[1:09:40] joyful in Jeremiah 29:11 he says for I
[1:09:44] know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:09:45] you saith the Lord thoughts of
[1:09:49] peace and not of evil
[1:09:53] glory to give you watch this there's no
[1:09:57] word here by mistake to give you an
[1:10:01] expected
[1:10:02] end God knew exactly where you were
[1:10:05] going to
[1:10:06] end exactly how you were going to end
[1:10:09] and all this stuff in
[1:10:11] between is just to see if you can keep
[1:10:14] the joy that's of the Lord remember
[1:10:17] remember I haven't got to this quote yet
[1:10:19] but we're going to get to this remember
[1:10:20] this what's on the inside will magnify
[1:10:24] itself out and so the that the fruits of
[1:10:27] the spirit and and and I'm jumping way
[1:10:30] ahead and all over here but the fruits
[1:10:31] of the spirit were love and joy was
[1:10:34] second and so you aren't telling me this
[1:10:37] morning that you got the baptism of the
[1:10:40] Holy
[1:10:40] Ghost and you're not joyful in any
[1:10:49] situation in every
[1:10:52] situation it's not possible because the
[1:10:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:59] Joy it an apple tree produces
[1:11:02] apples God is love and and God is
[1:11:07] Joy
[1:11:10] amen our next verse next example and I
[1:11:13] got about 10 here Psalms 9110 and
[1:11:17] 11 now this this is why you can be
[1:11:20] ridiculously joyful you know osben
[1:11:23] Bartley really spank me when he was here
[1:11:26] whoa Saturday morning I can tell you the
[1:11:29] service I was rejoicing but I was
[1:11:32] whimpering
[1:11:33] too said Christians don't
[1:11:35] worry about
[1:11:38] anything your kids are struggling
[1:11:41] to that's not worry that's God's problem
[1:11:44] not your problem that's God's problem to
[1:11:47] fulfill the promise amen it's God's
[1:11:50] promise to fulfill the promises that
[1:11:52] that your kids are your heritage and
[1:11:54] they'll be saved it's God's PR say that
[1:11:56] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[1:11:58] and it might be a while for the seed to
[1:12:00] come but just be prepared for twins or
[1:12:01] triplets I mean when they come sometimes
[1:12:03] it's a big Bounty
[1:12:05] crop you don't think so you know we were
[1:12:08] whine let let me just confess to you you
[1:12:11] probably heard some whining from me or
[1:12:12] Jared this year about the
[1:12:20] weather ouch you can say
[1:12:23] yes I'm repenting
[1:12:26] Jared don't even know this but the
[1:12:28] government has done surveys already and
[1:12:30] they figure that the bean crop will be a
[1:12:32] bountiful crop even though there's bare
[1:12:34] ground because there's been so much rain
[1:12:37] that it's going to produce like crazy
[1:12:39] they average the crop you don't even
[1:12:41] know this the average crop they figure
[1:12:42] for the county will be 54 bushel an acre
[1:12:44] which is beyond
[1:12:49] belief and two months ago I would talk
[1:12:52] to any one of you and said you know it's
[1:12:54] been a really hard year for
[1:12:56] apartment oh forgive me
[1:13:01] Lord see I'm guilty
[1:13:04] too because oh it's been really hard
[1:13:07] keeping the house with all these kids
[1:13:09] would you rather not have any
[1:13:11] kids oh my gas bill is really high would
[1:13:14] you rather not have a vehicle you could
[1:13:15] ride a
[1:13:17] bike

[1:13:57] Hallelujah I mean maybe we we don't even
[1:13:59] need all the promises in the book we
[1:14:01] only need a few of them to be
[1:14:05] happy neither shall any plague come nigh
[1:14:09] thy
[1:14:11] dwelling that means you don't have to go
[1:14:13] to the doctor to get
[1:14:15] poked because God poked you before the
[1:14:18] foundation of the
[1:14:20] world and you ain't going to go nowhere

[1:15:16] the outside world you I want to give you
[1:15:18] a testimony if you don't think you're
[1:15:19] being affected do you know when we were

[1:16:31] me I have given to you now this is Jesus
[1:16:37] talking to himself talking to the Father
[1:16:39] which is inside of him and he's saying
[1:16:42] the glory that is mine I'm given to the
[1:16:44] bride of
[1:16:45] Christ now that I'll just tell you what
[1:16:47] I don't think you really get the full

[1:18:54] of your family is you can be joyful you
[1:18:57] know I'm I'm going to guys say come to
[1:18:59] me and and I believe it's God you know
[1:19:01] when we were in New Foundland on
[1:19:03] Wednesday night we prayed for sister
[1:19:05] Sharon's brother and I was thrilled in
[1:19:08] my heart to bubbling over over that we
[1:19:11] went to see them now the doctors told
[1:19:13] him that your Bladers got cancer and
[1:19:15] we're going to take it out and we're
[1:19:17] going to put a plastic bag on the
[1:19:18] outside with a
[1:19:20] host I worked with the man when I was in
[1:19:22] high school that had a plastic bag on on
[1:19:24] the
[1:19:25] outside just in case you've never worked
[1:19:28] side by side with somebody like that
[1:19:29] it's not a pretty
[1:19:32] operation and God completely healed
[1:19:35] sister Sharon's brother
[1:19:37] totally he don't even need to see a
[1:19:40] doctor for a large period of time he has
[1:19:43] no bag he never took his bladder out no
[1:19:47] amen and I'll tell you what when we went
[1:19:50] and seeing him he was a happy man he was
[1:19:54] very very
[1:20:01] wonderful but he don't know the
[1:20:03] Revelation you
[1:20:04] know would you have been so happy in
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:09] situation he was he I mean was he happy
[1:20:14] H I'm just like I would have been
[1:20:18] just the outside man would might have
[1:20:20] been destroyed but the Inside Man
[1:20:21] wouldn't have
[1:20:22] been amen
[1:20:25] what Paul said in the Bible was to live
[1:20:29] is Christ and to die is gain it don't
[1:20:32] matter when you know the bottom line
[1:20:35] like all these other numbers in between
[1:20:37] don't matter you know sometimes the way
[1:20:40] she was paying a lot of bills this week
[1:20:42] you know and she'll show me where all
[1:20:43] the money went CU sometimes I've been
[1:20:45] guilty
[1:20:47] of believing the impossible that all the
[1:20:49] money's
[1:20:50] gone but you know it all that matters at
[1:20:53] the end is is there money in the
[1:20:56] B it don't matter what's in
[1:20:59] between but that's what our joy is in
[1:21:03] Christ Psalms
[1:21:05] 3723 and 24 for the steps of a good man
[1:21:09] are ordered of the Lord and he
[1:21:12] delighteth in his
[1:21:14] ways and though he fall he shall not
[1:21:18] utterly be cast down for the
[1:21:22] Lord upholdeth
[1:21:25] his
[1:21:28] hand Wow Let's Be Sad on that
[1:21:33] note see see how we supposed to we have
[1:21:36] this Joy ain't affected by
[1:21:39] happiness it's it's a different word Jo
[1:21:44] you can be joyful in the midst of Sorrow
[1:21:47] knowing that you're in God's will you're
[1:21:50] part of God Amen we what what do
[1:21:53] Believers have more great joy that in
[1:21:56] death that we'll see each other again
[1:21:58] and fellowship for all of
[1:22:00] eternity this is just a window a very
[1:22:04] small basement window of
[1:22:07] life amen and this is dead dead close my
[1:22:12] favorite scripture Genesis
[1:22:15] 1:26 to 28 and I wasn't going to read
[1:22:19] all this but God showed me some stuff in
[1:22:22] here that we need to look at at for a
[1:22:25] few
[1:22:27] minutes in 26 he said God said let us
[1:22:32] make man in our image and and I'm not
[1:22:36] going to dwell on this part because
[1:22:37] you've heard me say it that's God asking
[1:22:40] you for permission to make you because
[1:22:44] you were in God and and my question to
[1:22:47] that answer would be was who was God
[1:22:49] talking
[1:22:50] to let us who was the US there's only
[1:22:52] one God the only only other people in
[1:22:55] this equation is the predestinated
[1:22:57] election but that's not where I want to
[1:22:59] go after our likeness and let them have
[1:23:03] dominion and he mentions this two times
[1:23:06] in this scripture and I want to show you
[1:23:08] what Dominion means this is for you this
[1:23:11] ain't for the five-fold ministry this
[1:23:13] ain't for the great evangelist this
[1:23:15] ain't for the person that's got a
[1:23:16] Healing Ministry it's for
[1:23:20] you here's God saying let them have
[1:23:24] Domin
[1:23:24] and the word dominion here means to rule
[1:23:28] or have power over your problems and
[1:23:33] situations Dominion oh Genesis 1 26-
[1:23:38] 28 oh Dominion means to have power
[1:23:43] over to
[1:23:45] rule or to have power over your problems
[1:23:49] in situations now God did this before
[1:23:53] the foundation of the
[1:23:58] world so it's not possible that you
[1:24:00] could
[1:24:01] struggle
[1:24:03] because this is God's order that you're
[1:24:07] going to be the
[1:24:08] boss the boss remember remember brother
[1:24:13] Brown preached the message why cist
[1:24:15] speak and Moses came to God like oh I
[1:24:18] got a problem God's like deal with it
[1:24:25] amen and and now now watch I'm going to
[1:24:28] finish this part here he said it was
[1:24:30] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:24:32] fowl of there a and over the cattle and
[1:24:35] over all the Earth and over every
[1:24:38] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:24:42] earth now that totally means that you
[1:24:45] this morning are the god of your
[1:24:50] environment your Earth your situation
[1:24:53] your home you're think you are the
[1:24:55] Dominion the ruler and dictator over
[1:24:58] everything that goes on in your
[1:25:01] life if you came from
[1:25:05] God so we care about the
[1:25:12] election how could we care about the
[1:25:14] election when God gave us we're the boss
[1:25:16] over the dict the uh
[1:25:20] elected it don't matter how they change
[1:25:22] the laws they can't touch God's right
[1:25:25] that's not
[1:25:28] possible amen verse 27 and so God
[1:25:31] created man in his own image and in the
[1:25:34] image of God created him male and female
[1:25:37] created he
[1:25:39] them now it's going to be really hard to
[1:25:41] be not joyful on that note but let's
[1:25:43] look to verse 28 again and God blessed
[1:25:47] them and God said unto them be
[1:25:51] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:25:54] Earth and sdo
[1:25:58] it I means you're the
[1:26:02] boss you are the
[1:26:05] boss you're this is God's
[1:26:11] orders okay and then sedu it wasn't a
[1:26:15] strong enough word for
[1:26:17] God and he goes right on he says and
[1:26:19] have
[1:26:21] dominion so we're to sedo it and be the
[1:26:25] boss ruler over
[1:26:27] it that don't put a lot of people above
[1:26:32] you hello that don't put a lot of people
[1:26:35] above you you see you're God's wife
[1:26:39] you're the queen you're his rib your
[1:26:42] word is as good as
[1:26:44] his you're going to Jud you're looking
[1:26:47] at me like a blank face you're going to
[1:26:48] judge the world it ain't going to be God
[1:26:50] it's going to be the
[1:26:52] bride how could how could you worry
[1:26:55] about some little tiny decision oh I
[1:26:57] don't know what to decide here you're
[1:26:58] going to make the decisions of the
[1:27:04] world Hallelujah and over the fish of
[1:27:07] the sea and over the foul of the air and
[1:27:09] over every living thing that moveth upon
[1:27:12] the Earth that pretty much gives you the
[1:27:15] boss over everything and God give all
[1:27:17] this to you and you can't find joy in
[1:27:20] the promise of your
[1:27:22] life Wow
[1:27:25] amen God help us here we got to my
[1:27:27] favorite quote
[1:27:29] here about the nature of the seed am man
[1:27:33] let's just read this in questions and
[1:27:35] answer 61 he said here's a field and
[1:27:37] it's sewed with cockers and wheat and
[1:27:40] whatever more and weeds and well there's
[1:27:43] a drought on and now it
[1:27:46] doesn't it doesn't seem to matter the
[1:27:49] dro but everything that was planted in
[1:27:51] the field is thirsty
[1:27:55] now I going to tell you something church
[1:27:56] we need to understand this this is going
[1:27:58] to help you greatly there's a lot of
[1:28:01] stuff planted in the field of life and
[1:28:04] there's a drought
[1:28:06] on and the weeds are thirsty just like
[1:28:08] the crop the cockers are thirsty just
[1:28:12] like the crop and God sends the
[1:28:15] blessings of
[1:28:16] rain and everybody become a
[1:28:20] Pentecostal the cocka birds are like oh

[1:28:39] thing but what's in their
[1:28:42] nature shows who they are what's on the
[1:28:46] inside remember what's in your
[1:28:49] cup if you bump me and I spill my cup
[1:28:54] it's not because you bump me it's
[1:28:56] because there's something in here and
[1:28:58] what's going to come out is not because
[1:29:00] you bump me it's because I put water in
[1:29:04] it and so it's going to be water that
[1:29:06] comes out because that's what was put in
[1:29:08] there before the foundation of the
[1:29:11] world watch how the prophet explains
[1:29:16] that and the same rain falls and all
[1:29:19] this and the
[1:29:21] spirit this he calls the rain the spirit
[1:29:23] the Spirit falls on the weeds the
[1:29:25] Hypocrites and it falls on the
[1:29:27] Christians the same but by your fruits
[1:29:30] you shall know them and he said you let
[1:29:32] that sink in for a minute Brethren

[1:32:11] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:32:12] the world elect of God and already
[1:32:14] glorified in Romans 8:26 I believe it
[1:32:18] is and you can't be

[1:32:24] town of Wyoming coming in here like

[1:34:47] preached on the
[1:34:52] Trinity oh oh but bless God we got all
[1:34:55] of God so we don't
[1:34:57] need
[1:34:59] careful be very
[1:35:03] careful amen this evangelist he went to
[1:35:06] a Revival and I was present when he told
[1:35:09] the testimony and he said there wasn't
[1:35:11] one crumb in the house for his wife to
[1:35:12] eat not one crumb you know what he told
[1:35:15] his wife he said you go out in the yard
[1:35:18] honey and get Dand lines and eat
[1:35:20] dandelion soup until they pay me for
[1:35:23] preaching the Revival and when they pay
[1:35:25] me he said I'll wire the money back to
[1:35:26] you can go to the grocery store and buy
[1:35:28] something for the family and he got
[1:35:30] halfway to the Revival now this is a
[1:35:31] true story I'm not making this up and
[1:35:33] this ain't in my notes either he got
[1:35:35] halfway to Revival and his back tire
[1:35:39] blew and he didn't have one copper penny
[1:35:41] in his
[1:35:44] pocket you think you got hard times well
[1:35:47] let me just tell you something there was
[1:35:48] people that lived in the 30s and the
[1:35:51] 20s and they could tell you a thing or
[1:35:53] two to and you can learn from history or
[1:35:56] you'll repeat it
[1:35:59] again and he got behind that car and I
[1:36:02] want to tell you something else George
[1:36:03] hath never had the revelation of the
[1:36:04] Mysteries in this day and the Bible
[1:36:06] hadn't become a new book and he didn't
[1:36:08] know what the Seven Seals was he didn't
[1:36:09] have a clue and he kneeled down in his
[1:36:11] knels and he put both hands up and he
[1:36:13] said God you know I'm in your service
[1:36:15] and I'm going to Revival and I need a
[1:36:17] new
[1:36:19] tire and I bought the first car that
[1:36:21] stopped by
[1:36:24] stop and give him money for a tire and
[1:36:27] said I'm way behind on ties and give him
[1:36:30] some extra and before he even got to the
[1:36:32] Revival service he was wiring money back
[1:36:33] to his
[1:36:36] wife that's what Joy
[1:36:39] is that's that's what Joy is see you
[1:36:42] don't quit serving the lord because you
[1:36:44] don't have your things go bad well like
[1:36:47] I'm not going to have a crop this year
[1:36:49] so I'm just going to close the church
[1:36:50] and just fold
[1:36:51] up well then I'm not
[1:36:54] you know
[1:36:54] what it it show you pretty quick what
[1:36:57] was in this
[1:36:58] cup it sure wouldn't be
[1:37:01] God oh you know well you know God didn't
[1:37:04] do what I expected and we got a really
[1:37:06] fat preacher and you know and he's
[1:37:08] and and I was expecting the
[1:37:11] move I was expecting God to go to the
[1:37:13] cemetery the seminaries and the big
[1:37:15] churches instead of to the to the stable
[1:37:17] in the manger and so because God didn't
[1:37:20] come like I said I'll reject him
[1:37:23] you think those Spirits are dead oh
[1:37:25] they're alive and well the message
[1:37:27] hasn't happened like I thought it would
[1:37:29] portray and I thought God would bring
[1:37:31] and vindicate the message more openly to
[1:37:34] our politicians and all this but instead
[1:37:37] he came to a pig
[1:37:39] pen an old church where they couldn't
[1:37:42] afford to finish Society on the front of
[1:37:43] the wall and the politicians don't even
[1:37:46] recognize
[1:37:49] this you said wow that's it that's it
[1:37:53] that's I can't be God I can't be God
[1:37:55] there's no way that's God because I
[1:37:57] thought God
[1:38:00] would uhhuh what's in the
[1:38:05] cup will come out of the cup what God
[1:38:08] put in the cup your nature you cannot
[1:38:11] change from the nature of what you
[1:38:13] are you are your daddy's
[1:38:18] child spiritually speaking there's just
[1:38:21] things that your daddy spiritually don't
[1:38:22] do

[1:38:30] was going with that story I lost my
[1:38:32] train of thought but that's the truth

[1:38:37] forget if it comes to me I'll finish it

[1:45:53] the Lord is your strength is the end of
[1:45:55] that verse and when when they're writing
[1:45:58] when the prophet's writing this verse
[1:46:00] they're in
[1:46:02] slavery they're in
[1:46:05] captivity and the promised land is in
[1:46:08] ruins the walls have fell down in

[1:46:12] running for their life the renant was
[1:46:15] there and you know I want to tell you

[1:46:19] Nehemiah was a tremendous I listened to
[1:46:20] the whole book yesterday you know
[1:46:23] the king picked up his Joy when he was
[1:46:27] watch this when he was serving the king

[1:46:42] wage he was a
[1:46:44] slave he had a ball and chain on one
[1:46:46] foot but he was serving the king as wine
[1:46:48] and the King could see what was inside
[1:46:51] the cup
[1:46:54] that's powerful and the King allowed him
[1:46:57] because of his Joy allowed him to go
[1:46:59] back to Jerusalem and the queen was
[1:47:01] there was the king and he allowed him he
[1:47:03] asked him how long would it take you to
[1:47:05] go back and rebuild fix your
[1:47:08] city because he was affected by the
[1:47:11] ruins of
[1:47:13] Jerusalem and when they went back to fix
[1:47:15] it not everybody was happy they opened
[1:47:17] the
[1:47:19] church because they had to lay brick
[1:47:22] with one sword
[1:47:23] one thing and a sword in the other hand
[1:47:25] and it got so
[1:47:27] bad it was one for one there was one guy
[1:47:30] laying in the brick and one guy with a
[1:47:35] sword that's how it is if you do
[1:47:37] anything for God they were rebuilding
[1:47:40] Jerusalem and Judah they were rebuilding
[1:47:43] the wall they were putting the gates
[1:47:45] back on the
[1:47:46] city you think it was a walk in the park
[1:47:49] and he says but our joy they were so so
[1:47:53] happy to be laying brick for God with
[1:47:56] the sword in their hand to fight the
[1:47:57] enemy
[1:48:00] off that their slavery King picked up
[1:48:04] on that's
[1:48:06] powerful the joy of the Lord is our
[1:48:10] strength

[1:48:36] with the word of the Lord he said but
[1:48:38] your strength is the joy of the Lord and
[1:48:41] he said you get away from me and hack
[1:48:43] and cut him up with the word and whether
[1:48:46] it be a demon or whether it be an enemy
[1:48:48] or whether it be a sickness or a disease
[1:48:50] or whatever it would be just cut it up
[1:48:53] with the sword of the word and if you
[1:48:55] hack at it first time and you don't seem
[1:48:58] to move it then hack again and hack
[1:49:00] again and hack again and come out it
[1:49:02] with the word of
[1:49:04] God until you chop a hole through there
[1:49:07] and that little chicken will pick out
[1:49:09] its head he's talking about a chicken in
[1:49:11] the egg will poke out its head in the
[1:49:13] eggshell and cut your wig out he said
[1:49:15] Hallelujah that's the next one he said
[1:49:18] amen the battle it's a soldier he said
[1:49:21] the soldier of the cross and it's the
[1:49:23] joy of the Lord was their
[1:49:26] strength God help us Psalms 30 and
[1:49:31] five and his anger endureth for a moment
[1:49:35] but in his favor is life and weeping may

[1:49:52] trials SE no matter what they are on the
[1:49:56] outside it don't
[1:49:59] change our joy it don't change who God
[1:50:02] made us it don't change the promise of
[1:50:05] our destination and you know when we
[1:50:07] come to the end of our life the only
[1:50:10] thing that's going to matter is what
[1:50:11] you've done for Christ will last
[1:50:13] everything else it may be perfectly okay
[1:50:17] but it will make no difference your last
[1:50:20] day on this Earth it'll make no the only

[1:50:26] is what you did for Jesus Christ that's
[1:50:28] right Hallelujah let's stand let's stand

[1:50:59] ain't planted in you amen you know we so
[1:51:04] many times have such short short Vision
[1:51:08] but everything is God's plan look look

[1:51:15] pharaoh and in purpose Harden his
[1:51:18] heart now that's not
[1:51:21] nice to Brak glory to him and he now
[1:51:25] watch this and he God did he hardened
[1:51:27] Pharaoh's heart against his own
[1:51:32] people is it possible that God could be
[1:51:35] hardening the hearts of the
[1:51:38] governments of our
[1:51:40] day against God's
[1:51:43] people and God's doing it on
[1:51:47] purpose to bring glory to him because
