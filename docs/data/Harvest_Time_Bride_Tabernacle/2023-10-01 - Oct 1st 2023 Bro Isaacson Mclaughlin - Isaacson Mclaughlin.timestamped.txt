[31:57] greetings from Africa the S of the
[32:00] family Ghana in Nigeria Mali Uganda
[32:05] everywhere thank you
[32:10] Lord our Prophet told us about three
[32:15] Exodus told us about the first
[32:18] Exodus God raised up a prophet yes and
[32:23] he vate the prophet Ministry with a
[32:25] pillar of Fire and gave him a message
[32:29] for the
[32:31] people and exod means from a place to
[32:36] a in the days of
[32:39] Moses it was an exodos from a nation to
[32:43] a nation that's right amen amen in the
[32:49] days of Paul it was exodos from a
[32:53] religion to a
[32:55] religion yeah in the first Exodus it was
[33:00] from Egypt to isra the second Exodus was
[33:03] from
[33:04] judism to Christianity that's right then
[33:08] in the Third Exodus in these last days
[33:12] God have sent us a prophet also he has
[33:16] Ministry fire and he has given us a
[33:20] message also and this exodos is not from
[33:23] a nation to a nation not from a religion
[33:27] to a religion but from to
[33:30] glory amen and
[33:32] amen and in every
[33:36] Exodus there is what you
[33:39] call it produces what you call
[33:43] twins
[33:44] Hallelujah every Revival produces what
[33:47] TS
[33:49] right the last time we were
[33:51] fellowshipping
[33:53] around another Ephesians and we talk
[33:57] about josa and as we go ahead we will
[34:00] still talk about the ministry of josa in
[34:03] this God told
[34:06] Moses take a man from each right and
[34:11] send them to go
[34:14] his I was surprised that when I was
[34:16] reading the
[34:18] scriptures God told him that they should
[34:20] see how the land is right but God did
[34:25] not told them about the children of Han
[34:31] the all those but God
[34:35] knew that's right
[34:38] hallelujah amen God told him to go and
[34:41] search the land and bring a report after
[34:44] 40
[34:45] days and he told them the land is
[34:48] Flowing with milk and
[34:52] honey the people went
[34:55] second the they saw all those things
[34:58] that God didn't tell them and they saw
[35:00] what God told them also
[35:03] amen and yet they came back and said yes
[35:07] we saw the
[35:09] light and they even brought an
[35:12] Evidence praise the name of Lord they
[35:16] brought an evident fruit of the
[35:19] L so this is
[35:22] it but yet we can't take it right
[35:27] the Lord have
[35:29] Mery they saw the EV fruit of it but yet
[35:33] they said we can take it that's right
[35:36] why can't they take it is because of the
[35:39] other things that they saw that God
[35:41] didn't tell them to look
[35:44] at praise be the name of the Lord they
[35:48] shift they are Focus From the message to
[35:52] the things around the
[35:53] [Applause]
[35:55] message to many backslide from the faith

[37:44] a
[37:45] reason see he take Paul to the death of
[37:48] Arabia for a
[37:50] reason that is why Paul said in
[37:53] Corinthians that my preaching is not by
[37:55] the eloquence of wisdom but by the
[37:59] revelation of Jesus
[38:00] Christ yes sir Paul did not meet Jesus
[38:03] by the
[38:04] flesh by

[38:38] message this message was preach proving
[38:41] his way
[38:44] yes
[38:46] 1964
[38:48] 0816
[38:50] paragraph 1
[38:54] 38 un let that let's go 139
[38:58] not take my
[39:00] time
[39:02] 64816 parag
[39:05] 139 proving his word brother
[39:09] says don't you see in
[39:13] shs stop here
[39:16] a in the last
[39:18] days there is God to be a
[39:21] place prepared for the way to be made
[39:24] manifest am
[39:27] and we are now living by the evidence of
[39:30] the new land amen the Son of
[39:35] God see when those spies came back with
[39:41] the fruit of the
[39:43] land those fruits were evidence that yet
[39:47] there is a land that
[39:51] existed having those fruit of the L was
[39:54] to give them a blessed assurance hallah
[39:58] that we are more than able to possess it
[40:01] am no matter what goes around the
[40:06] evidence Hebrews loving yes faith is an
[40:11] Evidence of things not
[40:15] see is
[40:18] tangible
[40:20] hallelujah amen HEB love is a face is a
[40:25] substance now Faith is the substance of
[40:29] things hope
[40:34] for is a
[40:37] subance faith is tangible sir you
[40:43] hold of things hope for the evidence of
[40:48] things not yet
[40:50] seen so even though they have not seen
[40:53] the land the fruit of it to give them
[40:56] face that there is a land
[41:00] somewhere praise be the name of the Lord
[41:03] is evidence of Things Not
[41:09] Seen let's read Hebrews 11 is good for
[41:13] our not here
[41:15] yes Hebrews
[41:21] 111 to
[41:24] three faith
[41:27] now Faith is the substance of things
[41:32] hopeful the evidence of things not right
[41:37] for by it the
[41:41] ERS which Elders those that were sent to
[41:46] spy the lah they obtain a good report
[41:50] because of
[41:51] Faith through faith we understand that
[41:53] the words were framed by the word of God
[41:56] am so that things which are seen were
[42:00] not made of things we do appear That's
[42:05] right so the people should have hold on
[42:08] to that evidence right of what was from
[42:12] the L but you see I was so
[42:18] surprised I was so surprised in 27 read
[42:22] in numers he said numers
[42:27] and they told him and said we came onto
[42:31] the with thou send us and surely he flow
[42:36] milk and honey that should have been
[42:39] full
[42:40] St God Tau it the prophet spoke it and I
[42:45] believe it
[42:47] and not I believe it but no put that b
[42:52] in your pocket because we are called to
[42:56] be believe we are not called to
[42:59] understand Hallelujah because we can't
[43:02] understand
[43:03] everything and if you know anything you
[43:05] are
[43:07] D it is only a d that knows
[43:12] everything put the back in your pocket
[43:16] amen yes sir that's right unfortunately
[43:18] we are having investigative journalist
[43:20] in the messages today and they Brands
[43:23] and calls exm Believers and all they do
[43:26] on the Internet is to go and search
[43:28] search search and they are not looking
[43:30] for the fruit of the message but they
[43:32] looking for the fult of the message I
[43:35] don't need the F of his message I need
[43:38] the fruit of this
[43:40] message they can only show you the
[43:42] negative part but they can't you the
[43:44] good
[43:45] part they can show you fail prophecies
[43:48] but they can't show you the the
[43:51] fulfilled
[43:52] prophecies they can't take away the
[43:54] healings they can't take away
[43:57] the but with all the investigative
[44:00] journalism it does not prove
[44:03] wrong that's right yes
[44:06] sir said when it looks like the message
[44:09] is faing that is when God steps
[44:14] in the more they try to prove it wrong
[44:18] the more God indicate
[44:20] it yes sir how can a man preach the Mage
[44:23] for 40 years and come back and said that
[44:27] I breach it in
[44:29] ignorance and how can he now come back
[44:33] and unreach
[44:34] it and the people have delivered already
[44:37] and begin to come on Facebook and begin
[44:39] to blast the members who have left the
[44:41] church because of his
[44:43] fallacy and he is bold to say some are
[44:48] because they want to know the which
[44:50] truths thy way is the
[44:54] truth before God sent his message the
[44:59] Bible was
[45:01] there the Roman Catholic church has a
[45:03] bigest b does make the CH of
[45:08] God you go Muslim there is a Bible there
[45:14] go back to Africa some traditional their
[45:16] Bible
[45:18] there so having the Bible does not make
[45:21] you a by believe the
[45:24] Bible is what makes
[45:27] Chris that's so and when these things
[45:30] begin to go
[45:32] around people who are not positionally
[45:35] placed in Christ become
[45:38] Disturbed become confused in their minds
[45:42] and they also begin the investigative
[45:43] journalist
[45:44] work to se to prove but God has already
[45:49] done proving his
[45:52] way right let me read another quote here
[45:56] that would be good for us yes thank you
[45:59] Jesus Hallelujah I want to read from the
[46:02] message the unveiling of God 64 0614 m
[46:10] 64614 m on Ving of God paragraph
[46:16] 22 paragraph
[46:19] 22 he said now my subject this
[46:24] morning I trust that God will reveal
[46:28] this now my subject this morning I trust
[46:31] God reveal this and each
[46:33] time if you who takes the stat and
[46:38] list and I hope and trust
[46:42] that you have had a spiritual
[46:46] understanding of what god of what that
[46:50] God has been trying to get over to the
[46:54] church without saying it right
[46:59] out are we together
[47:01] church we listen to the T read the books
[47:05] the message comes out but you as an
[47:11] individual you need a
[47:14] spiritual
[47:16] understanding of what God is trying to
[47:20] say without speaking it out
[47:24] right that is the problem we have yeah
[47:28] without sing it out
[47:31] why to say
[47:34] here
[47:35] see it's a
[47:38] thing
[47:39] sometime we have to say
[47:43] things in such a way that it might te
[47:50] down it might bring some to go
[47:54] out yeah oh glory be to
[48:00] God when I see some the message I said
[48:04] God bless you you are fulfilling your
[48:05] part of the
[48:12] prophecy you are going out because you
[48:15] are not off in the
[48:17] beginning some
[48:20] to and some to B
[48:24] over but that has done
[48:28] purposely it must be done that
[48:33] way the people are building does around
[48:36] slip of
[48:37] FK that any man can have a slip of T and
[48:41] they hold up to judge a vated prophet oh
[48:46] Lord is that what we are called to look
[48:50] at no Breen we have come this far by his
[48:54] grace am yes sir we going to look
[48:57] forward and cross on for the mark of the
[49:00] higher calling in Christ
[49:04] Jesus sir Hallelujah that's right amen
[49:08] people are busy looking for what the
[49:12] prophet called Human
[49:14] Side in the days of mtin
[49:16] Luther mtin Luther King in the US yeah
[49:20] during that time when there was a lot of
[49:22] things going on somebody wrote
[49:27] letter and they were accusing of
[49:29] something he they claim he said that he
[49:31] did not
[49:33] say then he said so many times this is a
[49:37] woman's side but he didn't said that
[49:41] that is not what we we are called do
[49:45] let's see it here here in the
[49:48] message he cares do you
[49:51] care now paragraph 7 he cares do you
[49:54] care that is preaching
[49:57] 1963
[49:59] 0721 care you can he said now
[50:03] see I always asked you to be
[50:09] careful what you are listening
[50:13] to who is telling you that
[50:16] man the one you claim is a liar is
[50:19] telling you to be careful of what you
[50:21] are listening
[50:22] to can there is a good liar can a liar
[50:26] who knows is lying to you tell to be
[50:28] careful no sir he won't lie you he
[50:30] doesn't need to tell to be
[50:32] careful help you to live anything to be
[50:35] fallen by Li but if he is a liar then
[50:38] he's a good
[50:39] one be careful of what you are listening
[50:43] to see there is so much of it that is
[50:48] just the Human Side yes and
[50:53] unfortunately instead of believers
[50:55] to have spiritual
[50:58] discernment to take the spiritual side
[51:02] they hand on The Human Side to the
[51:04] spiritual side the Lord have
[51:08] Mery but always if there is something
[51:11] that goes for yeah there you go it will
[51:14] speak it is say the yeah there you even
[51:18] the VIS or
[51:20] anything The Vision on the platform in
[51:23] the audience you are doing to yourself
[51:26] it isn't God
[51:28] see God doesn't produce that V you do it
[51:31] by yourself by your faith in the Divine
[51:34] gift but what I want you to watch here
[51:38] God did not send us to look at the woman
[51:40] side of the
[51:42] prophet he a man born in the flesh B in
[51:45] sin he has his person life to live but
[51:48] that is not what we are called to see we
[51:50] have to see the ministry of the
[51:53] Prophet Vindicated by God amen because
[51:57] as long as he woman he will have fault
[52:00] because if he doesn't have fault then
[52:01] he's God it's only God that is
[52:04] perfect that's right but you see the
[52:07] devil is so wise right and he brings a
[52:11] mind of people from the m and looking at
[52:15] the woman side to judge the spiritual
[52:19] side
[52:21] help yeah that's
[52:24] right you see while we are
[52:27] reading this book of numbers while we
[52:30] are looking to
[52:31] Israel the prop how God deals with the
[52:36] natural Church
[52:38] Israel T how God deals with the
[52:41] spiritual Israelites that we are
[52:47] right the same way God deals with
[52:51] that when Israelite was in Egypt they
[52:54] were the people of
[52:57] God but when they came out of Egypt they
[53:00] became the Church of God the church is a
[53:04] call
[53:05] at and they come out with 2 million
[53:09] people and the prophet of God said mix
[53:15] Mor that's right so in every Revival it
[53:20] produces
[53:22] twist right there is a trueth
[53:26] and the false Vine right the presence of
[53:30] the false
[53:32] Vine does not mean there is
[53:37] the and remember without the Gen dollar
[53:43] they canot be counterfeit
[53:46] dollar the counterfeit is made out of
[53:49] the Gen
[53:50] one there is a gen experience of the B
[53:55] of the Holy
[53:56] Ghost and there is impersonation
[53:59] experience of the Bap of the Holy Ghost
[54:02] am thank you Lord Jesus what am I trying
[54:06] to say
[54:08] here the soall denominational
[54:12] Pentecostal two speaking in tongs there
[54:16] are nine spiritual gifts in the Bible
[54:18] Corinthians 13 the only two speaking in
[54:20] Tong as the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[54:24] that's right
[54:25] yeah but there is the holy spirit itself
[54:30] and there is the
[54:32] evidence and before you
[54:36] get the Holy Spirit or before you get
[54:39] the gift of the Holy Spirit you need the
[54:43] Holy Spirit itself yes then we can see
[54:48] the fruit of
[54:50] it but
[54:52] unfortunately the devil has given giving
[54:55] them the fruit for the Holy Spirit
[54:59] that's right so when they see the fruit
[55:02] of
[55:03] it they say oh speaking in Tong is the
[55:07] evidence of the Holy Spirit but speaking
[55:10] in Tong is not the evidence of the Holy
[55:12] Spirit it is one of the gift of the holy
[55:16] spirit so instead of seeking The Giver
[55:20] they seek the gift right but to seek The
[55:24] Giver
[55:25] because when you have a giver you
[55:28] automatically have a gift amen yes thank
[55:31] you Lord like little Daddy come home you
[55:37] a long Tri but oh but I B
[55:41] you I bought you a be I bought you said
[55:44] Daddy I need
[55:47] you I need you I don't need your
[55:51] gift there you
[55:54] go throw his hand around Daddy he said
[55:58] have Daddy to
[56:01] myself
[56:04] daddy have all of
[56:09] you we
[56:11] Believers must not be confused the way
[56:14] the world
[56:16] thinks if the denominational Christian
[56:19] don't takes speaking in tones for the
[56:23] evidence as the Holy Ghost
[56:27] and it is not we must not come to a time
[56:31] a place that will have what we call kind
[56:35] interpretation that's
[56:37] right amen and amen amen we have must
[56:41] come to a
[56:42] place that this great P of Christ that
[56:46] we have received must mean anything to
[56:50] in this world than any association and
[56:53] any friendship
[56:55] because this is our
[56:57] life blessed be
[57:04] the he said we saw it yet nevertheless
[57:09] the people be strong that in the land
[57:12] and the cities are and very great more
[57:16] we saw the children of
[57:17] Anna that is not what God
[57:21] ask there is a main thing and you got
[57:25] evidence is good enough for
[57:29] me because those who claim this message
[57:33] is
[57:34] false they can't produce the life that
[57:36] this message has
[57:39] produced that's right on the day of
[57:43] Pentecost Peter told them that this is
[57:48] that this what is happening is that with
[57:53] the prophet
[57:55] Jo
[57:57] prophesy brother came in the Gap to
[58:01] say before you have this hold
[58:05] that amen right before you hold this
[58:10] hold
[58:11] that so the spies that went to
[58:14] investigate the land and brought the
[58:16] fruit of the land were supposed to hold
[58:20] that amen as an
[58:23] Evidence before they get
[58:26] this but instead of holding onto that
[58:30] they were beginning to look at
[58:34] the right
[58:36] right the Lord help our church amen yes
[58:40] sir the am the land of
[58:45] thees DW the mountains and by the Sea
[58:48] and the coast of Jordan all those
[58:51] excuses does not mean
[58:53] anything yes sir y why don't you come to
[58:55] church you know the government we should
[58:57] shut up
[59:01] Church why don't you come to church if
[59:03] you don't get a v you don't have to come
[59:05] to church why don't you come to church
[59:07] if I don't have a Mas or somebody
[59:08] because somebody not wearing mask those
[59:10] are excuses sir
[59:14] now the
[59:19] is what about the flu we happen before
[59:21] the cor and the flu we had after the cor
[59:23] yeah that's right yes yes sir what is
[59:26] happening Believers need spiritual
[59:30] discernment brother said every believer
[59:33] need a little spiritual
[59:36] discernment to not good from
[59:39] wrong and run from
[59:43] good discernment itself is a
[59:46] gift but if you don't have a gift of
[59:48] discernment you need a lot of worship as
[59:51] a
[59:53] Christian
[59:56] and KH
[59:58] steal the people oh glory to God before
[1:00:03] most yes he did and that's what we are
[1:00:06] doing this morning
[1:00:08] right we are s in every
[1:00:11] cres every unbeliever and every exmed
[1:00:15] Believers and K Ste the

[1:00:28] possess for we are well able to overcome
[1:00:32] it yes sir that is a man with vision
[1:00:35] that's right that's right that is a man

[1:02:02] borderline and look over and said well I
[1:02:06] know it's there but the obstacles is too
[1:02:12] great the obstacles is too great we look
[1:02:17] like
[1:02:18] grasshoppers they push in the wilderness
[1:02:21] but call them borderline believers
[1:02:26] right borderline

[1:19:51] Kenya and Tanzania and the translate in
[1:19:53] their local language I to learn I was
[1:19:56] sharing some experiences I think the bre
[1:19:59] in in Kenya I was selling them in Mala
[1:20:04] when I'm preaching anding and I'm
[1:20:06] studying their local language I preach
[1:20:08] in English they translate until when The
[1:20:10] Interpreter make a mistake I stop andc
[1:20:12] correct them their local
[1:20:15] language and I tell them what I mean not
[1:20:17] what he said so I was telling the church
[1:20:21] in Kenya like that and
[1:20:23] just coincidentally I was preaching and
[1:20:26] the was making a mistake I stop him I
[1:20:29] said
[1:20:30] SBA I lion not what you are saying I'm
[1:20:34] not talking I'm saying lion Simba Sim
[1:20:37] and
[1:20:38] the you see it's
[1:20:41] wonderful like brother will be talking
[1:20:43] to somebody in Finnish you speak English
[1:20:45] and a Finnish girl was here finish y y
[1:20:49] That's right yes sir this is up is a
[1:20:52] truth
[1:20:53] she was hear in
[1:20:55] finish the prophet was speaking English
[1:20:58] thank you
[1:20:59] Lord I want to read from the
[1:21:03] message you know they don't have so can
[1:21:06] cat up he said they are like the
[1:21:09] children of Israel who came out of Egypt
[1:21:13] and sto shut of the promised
[1:21:17] land before the what the prophet said
[1:21:20] before preceding this was talking about
[1:21:22] the Ping the evidence of Tong as
[1:21:25] evidence of the Holy Spirit but I don't
[1:21:28] want to read that long I want to come to
[1:21:30] the main point I want you to have here
[1:21:33] he said the children of Israel who came
[1:21:34] out of Egypt they sto short of the
[1:21:37] promised
[1:21:39] land and that is where we must not come
[1:21:41] to short
[1:21:44] right Redemption isold coming out and
[1:21:49] entering so complete Redemption means
[1:21:51] coming out and entering to com without
[1:21:54] entering to is not a complete
[1:21:56] Redemption so they came out of Egypt all
[1:22:00] right but what happened they got
[1:22:04] short they stopped short of The Promise
[1:22:09] Land which must not be so or which must
[1:22:12] not be our
[1:22:16] Cas he said now those children of Israel
[1:22:19] left Egypt about 2
[1:22:20] million the all together all saw the
[1:22:24] miracles of god all part of the same
[1:22:27] manner and water from the Spirit Rock
[1:22:29] all follow the same Cloud by day and the
[1:22:32] P of Fire by night but only two reach
[1:22:36] the promised
[1:22:38] land was Jesus all two reach the
[1:22:42] promised land right yes sir thank you
[1:22:47] Father thank you
[1:22:48] Lord only two were true or real
[1:22:52] believers
[1:22:53] that is correct right because the word
[1:22:58] tells us that the rest because of
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:04] unbel
[1:23:06] unbelief oh GL Hallelujah
[1:23:10] right the rest died because of unbelief
[1:23:13] and because of unbelief they could not
[1:23:15] enter
[1:23:17] in that is Hebrews
[1:23:20] 3:19 then since that is so and only two
[1:23:25] ended then the rest were not true
[1:23:28] believers what makes the
[1:23:31] difference what makes the difference to
[1:23:35] stay with the
[1:23:40] World and josua St with the word and
[1:23:45] that word say the is milk and honey full
[1:23:51] stop and is your God has given it to
[1:23:56] you that is
[1:23:59] enough
[1:24:01] hallelujah oh praise be the name of the
[1:24:03] Lord to St the
[1:24:05] way when the heart of the TP F at cish
[1:24:13] B josa and KH do not STG for they
[1:24:18] believe the
[1:24:20] word and said
[1:24:24] we are more than able to take
[1:24:27] the they knew they could because God has
[1:24:31] said I have given you the life
[1:24:34] Hallelujah this morning if you need
[1:24:35] healing I have given you
[1:24:37] healing if you need on your I have given
[1:24:40] you if you need bre I given you bre if
[1:24:44] you need of I have giv you fth whatever
[1:24:48] you need I giv you if you need children
[1:24:51] I giv you
[1:24:52] children
[1:24:54] hallelujah what you God I given you I
[1:24:58] have given you this
[1:25:00] land it it and it work and it work
[1:25:05] before work
[1:25:07] again that
[1:25:14] is we are more than able to the land
[1:25:17] they knew they could because God has
[1:25:21] said I am giving you the
[1:25:24] land after all those Israelites saw of
[1:25:27] the power and the goodness and
[1:25:29] deliverance of God they do not enter
[1:25:31] into the
[1:25:32] rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:36] so you can see right now that
[1:25:39] few very few will ever believe all the
[1:25:44] way to receiving the spirit of God
[1:25:49] Amen you
[1:25:51] see
[1:25:53] came to
[1:25:55] differentiate
[1:25:57] when the Baptist says have you received
[1:26:00] the Holy Ghost when you
[1:26:03] believe that mean I believe I receive
[1:26:05] the Holy
[1:26:07] Ghost but said no sir he say since you
[1:26:11] believe yeah that's right from the time
[1:26:14] you believe have you received the Holy
[1:26:18] Ghost oh praise be the name of the Lord

[1:27:05] and did all eat the same spiritual
[1:27:09] meat yes sir and then all drank the same
[1:27:12] spiritual drink for they drun of the
[1:27:16] spiritual rock that followed them and
[1:27:19] that rock was Christ First Corinthians
[1:27:22] 10 verse 5 but with many of them was not
[1:27:27] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:27:30] the wers that's right verse six now

[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:00] examples First
[1:28:03] Corinthians now these things were our
[1:28:05] examples to the intent we should not
[1:28:09] last after evil things as they also
[1:28:15] last neither be Idol as where some of
[1:28:20] them as it is written the people sat

[1:37:54] story Luke

[1:38:00] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:38:04] into the syag God on the Sabbath day and
[1:38:07] stood up for to
[1:38:11] read and there was delivered unto him
[1:38:14] the book of the prophets
[1:38:17] Isaiah and when he had opened the book
[1:38:21] he found the place where it was
[1:38:26] written yeah that was by predestination
[1:38:30] amen right he found the place God made
[1:38:34] his eye to fall that place because there
[1:38:36] was a
[1:38:38] purpose and what place was it the spirit
[1:38:42] of the Lord is upon me because he had
[1:38:44] arranged me to bring the gospel to the
[1:38:46] poor he has sent me to heal the broken
[1:38:49] heart to to pre Deliverance to the
