[31:45] you may have your seat um
[31:49] first
[31:50] i want to thank brother
[31:52] dale insisted his wife your wife for
[31:56] their hospitality we just felt at home
[31:59] and
[32:00] it's always a blessing to meet
[32:03] precious saints precious faith
[32:06] and
[32:08] we need each other
[32:11] and and the prophet said without each
[32:13] other you can you can do it
[32:16] and you know we we speak about love but
[32:20] how to demonstrate love
[32:23] it's on other people
[32:25] of
[32:26] course among us
[32:29] and
[32:30] all over
[32:32] the world anybody
[32:34] you know like the prophet one day he was
[32:36] in a restaurant and there was an old
[32:38] woman she looked like a prostitute
[32:41] and he started to judge her
[32:44] and finally the
[32:46] spirit of the lord came on him said you
[32:49] want to
[32:52] put a spider and to condemn her what's
[32:55] about yourself
[32:57] and so
[32:58] you know the rest of story he went he
[33:00] apologized
[33:02] there was an old sister she passed many
[33:04] years ago she was from germany and
[33:07] and she will go in in a restaurant and
[33:10] she will talk
[33:12] with the lady that served the meal and
[33:14] she is
[33:16] just show love
[33:18] and she will hold her hand and you know
[33:20] when people
[33:22] she has such a love for anybody anybody
[33:26] amen
[33:27] so
[33:28] brother dale asked me
[33:30] um
[33:31] if i could speak a little bit about
[33:36] the way we raise the kids
[33:38] so we have five kids and 14
[33:41] grandchildren so
[33:44] it's not a record but it's hard to beat
[33:48] 14.
[33:50] and then also
[33:53] i don't
[33:55] want to brag on anything because it's
[33:58] the grace of god
[34:00] but
[34:00] our
[34:02] five kids they serve the lord and their
[34:05] husband too
[34:07] and
[34:08] so they
[34:10] they are in message church but they are
[34:12] scattering all over one is in
[34:15] connecticut and the other one in phoenix
[34:18] and another one in the
[34:20] alberta so
[34:22] it's not the bermuda triangle but it's
[34:26] we have to travel to to see them and uh
[34:30] two weeks ago they were with us and
[34:34] it didn't happen since six years to have
[34:37] all the family together and they
[34:39] they celebrate our 70th anniversary
[34:43] suzanne and i so i turned 70. she turned
[34:46] 70. so altogether we have 140 years
[34:51] of experiences
[34:53] and there was a man i heard one day he
[34:55] was a christian he said you know he was
[34:57] old and maybe 85 he said you know my
[35:00] wife and i we have been married since
[35:03] 100 years people say what
[35:07] he said 50 from her side and 50 from my
[35:10] side
[35:13] to have a
[35:15] a family a strong family
[35:18] takes the boat
[35:21] so i will take just a couple minutes
[35:23] before
[35:24] uh preaching you know i want to to
[35:27] preach on prayer
[35:29] prayer or whatever so but i just jut uh
[35:32] through some notes
[35:34] i won't be long but just to
[35:37] share some testimony of as i say it's
[35:41] not only mechanic but the lord that's
[35:44] the grace of the lord
[35:46] so first
[35:50] devotion time
[35:51] so today
[35:54] so everything there is so much to do and
[35:57] communication internet and
[35:59] all those things are
[36:01] against family
[36:04] so but devotion time is so important
[36:07] so when they were just a little kid we
[36:09] have some little chair and i was going
[36:12] in the basement or i or suzanne and we
[36:15] were taking the bible but
[36:18] in image you know just show and we have
[36:21] to we had to go to their level
[36:24] you know you don't take the kid and
[36:27] you place around the table
[36:29] silence don't speak don't move and you
[36:32] take the bible in the beginning was the
[36:35] word and the word what was god what they
[36:37] understand on that
[36:41] you see if you just apply something to
[36:44] be religious because the message say it
[36:47] you are wrong
[36:48] you have to be
[36:51] normal human and go to the level
[36:54] and what you know and while they were
[36:56] growing we were taking uh another bible
[37:01] but with more text less
[37:03] photos or pictures and um
[37:07] and we read pile of books
[37:12] like biography
[37:14] like some saints even brother branham
[37:17] and you know what
[37:20] sometimes you know i was reading this
[37:22] another page papa i know the pages
[37:25] okay so i was reading and i say i said
[37:27] hey now it's time to go to take your
[37:30] baptist you know they were forcing me to
[37:33] go on
[37:35] you see it was not worrying
[37:37] you know when i was catholic with the
[37:39] little little boy who were kneeling and
[37:41] yeah we were catholic and and the radio
[37:43] were
[37:44] listening
[37:47] and happy mariah and stuff like that it
[37:50] was a punishment
[37:52] and you know but we we make it fun
[37:55] and they enjoyed
[37:57] what we were reading
[37:59] to their level
[38:00] and we did the piles of of biography
[38:04] and so that's make a difference
[38:07] and also another point
[38:10] is uh
[38:11] correction
[38:12] you know uh some people are
[38:15] everyone is a little bit different and
[38:17] we know what the bible say about
[38:19] correction
[38:20] it's necessary but see if you go too far
[38:22] away from one side or the other side you
[38:26] are wrong
[38:27] you know sometimes they say uh
[38:30] now with the the worldly people you know
[38:32] they uh
[38:34] they cannot touch a kid they cannot
[38:36] correct a kid but they do a monster
[38:39] you know they don't obey and they are
[38:41] stubborn but there there is a balance
[38:45] you know in a correction it's a raise a
[38:48] cheat children a child is not you do and
[38:52] you don't
[38:53] you have to explain why
[38:57] if you don't want them to see the
[38:58] neighbor because
[39:02] they are not good people
[39:04] and you don't they don't have friend you
[39:06] have to tell them why you explain to
[39:08] them to bring
[39:10] a judgment
[39:12] a
[39:12] balance to understand an understanding
[39:16] you know there is a
[39:18] brother when the
[39:19] uh years ago
[39:21] he was coming with his five kids
[39:24] and they were sitting you know what they
[39:26] were the best one they were sitting and
[39:29] they were not moving
[39:30] the whole service and it was quite
[39:33] strong
[39:34] you know like hey
[39:37] come here and
[39:38] but you know what when they they became
[39:41] teenager
[39:44] they were really
[39:46] against
[39:48] church against everything but he never
[39:51] developed a love
[39:53] and comprehension
[39:55] and it was just like strong
[39:57] it it
[39:58] he did wrong
[40:00] he did wrong you know he went to the
[40:03] extreme
[40:05] so and
[40:08] you know sometimes uh
[40:10] kids they play on our nerve
[40:13] and uh some sometimes you know you lost
[40:16] control
[40:17] a temper
[40:19] especially men
[40:22] amen
[40:26] and you know i was hearing brother billy
[40:29] paul one day he said uh
[40:31] he he told a testimony he said i was
[40:34] with uh
[40:35] with dad
[40:37] he was the secretary and the little paul
[40:41] was coming to see his grandpa
[40:44] and he was just a little boy you know
[40:47] maybe three years old and and so
[40:50] billy paul was saying he said no paul
[40:53] it's not time
[40:55] go back home
[40:56] and
[40:58] you return
[40:59] and then
[41:00] no paul it's not time
[41:02] papi is busy papa is busy so go back
[41:05] home after two three times
[41:08] billy paul lost control and he hit his
[41:11] son start to cry
[41:14] of course
[41:15] and brother branham told him he said
[41:18] billy paul never do it again because
[41:22] when you hit him you hit his angel
[41:29] because you did it on
[41:31] you were
[41:32] angry and he said this is not good at
[41:36] all
[41:37] it could be an effect on the on the kid
[41:40] because their
[41:41] angels see the face of of my father
[41:45] you see
[41:47] you see it's never do that
[41:50] you have to keep your temper
[41:52] and
[41:54] you need the punishment but you talk
[41:56] with them
[41:57] like um
[41:59] my little pierre the oldest uh one day
[42:03] we had a babysitter come at home to keep
[42:06] the kids and he really disobeyed
[42:10] he never listened so when we came back
[42:13] she said
[42:15] he was very bad
[42:17] and the next day
[42:18] i told her you know he was
[42:21] five or six years old i said pierre i
[42:23] explained to him that
[42:25] it was not good he didn't obey and he
[42:29] was stubborn
[42:30] i said now listen
[42:32] i want you to apologize to
[42:35] this lady
[42:36] i said will you
[42:37] apologize he said no
[42:41] so
[42:42] i repeat again to make sure that he
[42:44] understood i said i i said papa i want
[42:48] you to apologize and we'll take the
[42:50] phone and we'll call her whatever he
[42:52] don't remember the detail but anyhow and
[42:55] he was stubborn
[42:57] i said now if you don't i have
[43:01] a plastic
[43:04] i don't know how you call that but you
[43:06] know you understand
[43:09] i said i will have to hit you but
[43:11] it's it's not because i don't like you
[43:14] it's because i like you i know i want
[43:16] you to learn how to obey it's important
[43:20] so are you going to apologize no
[43:23] so the rest of the story you understand
[43:26] but
[43:28] after he was crying so i took him in my
[43:31] arm i said you know papa i love you
[43:33] i said are you going to apologize next
[43:36] time you said yes papa
[43:39] you see and one day my one of my
[43:42] daughter
[43:43] she was
[43:45] in the morning we
[43:47] we want every kids to do the bed you
[43:50] know to fix the bed and
[43:53] we i repeat her many times but
[43:57] you know how it was you know they have
[43:59] so much to study and and rush and
[44:02] and so one morning i went in the
[44:04] basement again
[44:05] so it was it seemed that the drawer
[44:08] vomit clothes you know
[44:12] there was clothes
[44:13] on the floor
[44:15] i didn't like it i i like when it's in
[44:18] order like every family that doesn't
[44:21] mean i'm all the time in order
[44:23] but
[44:25] i was tempted to take all the clothes
[44:28] and all the blanket and to make a big
[44:30] mountain over the bed
[44:33] but finally
[44:35] i prayed i said what should i do
[44:38] oh
[44:39] an inspiration came
[44:41] so i
[44:43] i place replace all the clothes in the
[44:45] drawer
[44:46] and i i fixed the bed and i wrote a
[44:51] little note
[44:53] and i wrote i said
[44:55] dear honey
[44:57] i know you are you were worried and not
[45:00] worried but in hurry you didn't have
[45:02] time and i said dad fix it for you
[45:06] love you with the big art
[45:10] and you knew what it was the right thing
[45:13] to do but after that you know there was
[45:15] a change
[45:17] you see but in fact you know i place
[45:20] myself in instead of christ
[45:22] that's the way the lord did for us you
[45:25] know you you become like christ for your
[45:27] family and uh you are an image a living
[45:31] image of what christ is
[45:34] and so um
[45:37] whatever i'll say about the token you
[45:40] know brother bernam said
[45:44] in the token he
[45:45] spoke about the cartoons
[45:47] and you know the
[45:49] the books uh with the kids you know in
[45:51] his time hey
[45:53] compared with today there was nothing
[45:56] but um
[45:58] he said those cartoons one of those they
[46:01] they will have an effect on your kids
[46:04] so now how much more
[46:06] the video and the game and my son pierre
[46:08] when he was a teenager he was playing to
[46:11] the like fire men in the grocery and it
[46:15] looks so real i said yeah what you know
[46:17] one more one day i
[46:20] doing
[46:22] yeah it's only a video i said yeah but
[46:26] you kill people
[46:28] you know i s this is wrong and for him
[46:32] it was nothing you see little by little
[46:35] why there is so much shooting in every
[46:38] school today because the game they see
[46:40] it you know their their brain their mind
[46:44] is
[46:44] there's a seed there
[46:46] and you see you better to watch what
[46:48] they are listening
[46:50] with internet today it's so corrupted
[46:54] but you have to watch
[46:56] because you know when they are a kid
[46:59] you apply
[47:01] laws because if they are not born again
[47:04] you have to keep them on the law
[47:07] and you you do the law in your house you
[47:09] do that and you don't do that and when
[47:12] they will be older and they will be
[47:14] converted
[47:17] you will not need any laws but you know
[47:20] i was
[47:21] when they were kids of course we were
[47:24] french and
[47:25] and all the kids in the school they were
[47:28] listening uh tv and english so they
[47:30] could have more opportunity to be
[47:33] bilingual and so uh we bought
[47:36] a lot of video of
[47:39] of the bible you know samson esther
[47:42] and abraham and all and so they were
[47:45] listening that
[47:46] i said listen to me
[47:48] i said i don't want you to bring
[47:51] anything else
[47:53] if you do it
[47:54] i will kick out this screen and
[47:59] the video player i said you i i want you
[48:02] if there is something that you are
[48:04] interested in you come and ask me
[48:07] and so
[48:09] but i find out you know
[48:11] you have to to have a balance in that
[48:14] i find out
[48:16] so the more they listen
[48:19] some supposed to be good movies
[48:22] the less thirst they have for god
[48:27] you know paul said
[48:29] all things are laughable to me but i
[48:32] will not be brought under the power of
[48:35] any
[48:36] you know time is short and just to have
[48:39] a distraction soon enough you will find
[48:42] that you lost
[48:43] the love that you have for god or
[48:46] to read the bible or to listen a message
[48:49] okay and so there is another point uh
[48:52] kids they need friends
[48:54] so but you are parents you are the one
[48:57] to choose what kind of friend
[48:59] or which
[49:01] are you going to provide for them and
[49:04] so in the vacation time
[49:06] i was offering the kids so what do you
[49:09] want to have
[49:10] we could have some vacation somewhere
[49:14] close to a lake or mountain camping or
[49:18] to go in michigan or ohio
[49:22] no we want to go in ohio
[49:24] that's exactly what we want too
[49:27] and you know and there they they
[49:30] met other girl and start to write and
[49:33] you see you provide good friends
[49:37] because they need friends so
[49:39] and of course we we had youth camp in
[49:42] the church
[49:43] while i was pastoring the church and
[49:46] before we used to have camp for the kids
[49:50] that they could have opportunity to have
[49:52] fellowship with others and also
[49:56] that they could receive the holy spirit
[49:58] you know praying me thing and
[50:00] and you know and that's
[50:02] did a lot of difference
[50:05] you know and so we um
[50:07] my son-in-law who is the pastor's
[50:09] brother steve uh usually we do two camp
[50:13] per year in the in the winter in the
[50:15] springtime
[50:17] another point is the prophet said make
[50:20] your home a place where it is pleasant
[50:23] to leave
[50:24] you know when you you
[50:26] put some
[50:27] outside you know you make it nice and
[50:31] you provide
[50:32] for them
[50:33] it's important you know and also the
[50:36] atmosphere at the home
[50:38] if you scream at your wife and she
[50:41] scream at you and
[50:42] and she opposed you and uh hey
[50:46] what kind of model they're going to have
[50:48] the best gift you can give to you kids
[50:52] is to love husband and wife to love each
[50:55] other
[50:56] because they learn from you
[50:58] you are the only bible they can read
[51:01] when they were young
[51:02] and so and also
[51:04] um
[51:08] you have
[51:09] especially the man of the family is the
[51:12] provider
[51:13] but the provider is not
[51:15] to bring bread on the table
[51:18] you know in the old time that my father
[51:20] was a father of 12 kids he was a
[51:23] provided provider but he was not a man
[51:26] to take his kids to give them love
[51:29] and to embrace them to speak with them
[51:34] and the kids need that
[51:36] you need a father you have to develop
[51:39] not only that's good to provide to work
[51:42] and
[51:43] almost day and night this is not good
[51:46] but you have to talk with them
[51:48] you have to inquire
[51:51] what do you leave
[51:53] what do you think how are you
[51:55] so you talk with them and to to know the
[51:57] needs
[51:58] so uh
[52:00] so the dialogue you say
[52:02] it's so important
[52:05] so important
[52:06] and
[52:08] you know at school
[52:10] when the kids were at school the teacher
[52:12] they could wait to
[52:14] to know
[52:16] us
[52:17] because our kids they were so different
[52:21] you know they were calm
[52:24] peaceful
[52:25] and they were creative you know in heart
[52:27] they were so good and
[52:30] the teacher many times we heard this
[52:32] testimony we we could wait to to know
[52:35] you
[52:36] what are you to have such a special kid
[52:40] you see that was the atmosphere
[52:43] you see and uh
[52:45] um
[52:46] another point is uh
[52:48] to be faithful dedicated
[52:52] for others because when we have devotion
[52:55] time we we pray for each other for the
[52:58] needs to learn them that they are not by
[53:00] themselves but today there is a tendency
[53:03] even in the people in the message just
[53:06] to listen brother branham listen the
[53:08] tapes but they are alone they are in
[53:10] their home they have no fellowship this
[53:13] is absolutely wrong
[53:16] you see because
[53:19] a church is a body
[53:21] and how could you demonstrate love if
[53:24] you are alone in your house and your
[53:26] kitchen and you don't want to have
[53:28] fellowship with anybody it's just so
[53:30] wrong yeah and so uh
[53:34] fully dedicated uh there was when i was
[53:37] passing the church there was a couple
[53:39] they have all excuses good to not attend
[53:43] the church and so even on sunday morning
[53:46] they place their
[53:48] little boy with their hockey
[53:50] competition so i called them i said
[53:54] now i said you you don't go come to
[53:57] church to bring your kids in a kind of
[54:00] complete hockey hockey competition i
[54:04] said hey
[54:05] do you think that when they will be 12
[54:07] years old and older they will come to
[54:09] church you are a very poor example
[54:12] so finally they
[54:14] they were stubborn so the couple
[54:16] divorces and
[54:20] their son one of her son became
[54:22] homosexual and it was just a mess
[54:26] you see because if you don't and at home
[54:29] the lord has witnessed you know since 50
[54:32] years or about
[54:34] so
[54:35] sister suzanne if you go in the kitchen
[54:37] you hear the voice of the message the
[54:40] voice of the prophet and so
[54:42] and when we were
[54:44] driving to go to the camp i was putting
[54:47] a tape and listening
[54:49] of course they were all sleeping
[54:52] while we were listening but at least
[54:54] it's like the basket of water is you
[54:57] know something that they learn
[55:00] and also another point
[55:02] could be more than that but
[55:04] you
[55:05] hide
[55:07] problems
[55:09] that in the local church like i was a
[55:11] pastor i never mentioned
[55:14] the problems that i could have or some
[55:17] people could have you just present the
[55:19] the good size the good side of every
[55:22] situation you hide and you know even
[55:25] brother branham said
[55:27] don't speak about somebody
[55:31] you hide
[55:33] somebody did a mistake you don't bring
[55:36] that before other people this is so
[55:39] wrong because your kill is influenced
[55:41] you hide you cover with love and if
[55:45] somebody did something wrong try to find
[55:48] something positive to say about the
[55:50] person
[55:51] you see the holy spirit is not the
[55:54] septic tank
[55:56] you know it's something clean
[55:58] it's something you know god will work in
[56:00] certain atmosphere
[56:03] amen okay so i think that's
[56:06] maybe
[56:07] not enough but anyhow so it's some point
[56:10] that
[56:11] i think that
[56:13] make the difference so i apologize i was
[56:16] uh i would like to present a little
[56:18] video of haiti and especially their
[56:21] worshipping but
[56:22] internet was not working i have all kind
[56:25] of problem yesterday and so
[56:28] but anyhow so maybe another time well
[56:31] anyhow
[56:32] so um but this morning we're going to
[56:34] take this topic
[56:36] about uh praying
[56:38] so
[56:39] prayer is uh
[56:41] is my
[56:42] hardest things to do
[56:45] because we are in a nervous world
[56:48] and
[56:49] very busy with all kind of priority and
[56:53] i used to say
[56:55] you know hey wait a minute it's
[56:57] impossible to do everything in life
[57:02] it's impossible there is too much task
[57:04] too much to do
[57:06] even in work in the house and there's so
[57:09] much to do
[57:11] but you have to decide what are you
[57:13] going to neglect
[57:18] because you cannot
[57:20] do it do everything perfectly
[57:22] it's a choice what are you going to
[57:25] neglect
[57:27] so
[57:28] you know uh
[57:29] people
[57:30] when they
[57:32] they like to do something they always
[57:34] find
[57:35] time
[57:38] okay
[57:39] you always uh find time
[57:42] but you have to choose um could you mind
[57:44] to stand up and we're going to read
[57:48] a text
[57:50] it's going to be in isaiah
[57:52] chapter 40
[57:55] three
[57:56] and only one verse
[57:58] 22
[58:05] isaiah 43
[58:09] verse 22
[58:15] while you are turning
[58:17] sister amy
[58:19] sorry too
[58:20] was it working
[58:22] okay wait uh anyhow after the service i
[58:25] will explain to you okay let us pray
[58:27] before heavenly father here we are
[58:30] and
[58:31] here you are too
[58:34] and we believe that your present is here
[58:38] you feel the whole world the universe
[58:42] and you said that you're going to be
[58:44] always with us
[58:45] till the end of the world and you said
[58:48] if there are two or three gather in my
[58:51] name
[58:52] i will be in the midst of them so that's
[58:55] the reason why we come
[58:57] with reverence
[58:59] and
[59:00] we come in asking for forgiveness
[59:03] for you our
[59:05] sin
[59:06] our mistake
[59:08] and
[59:10] we know that you are rich in mercy
[59:13] and you understand and
[59:15] as we ask forgiveness you're always
[59:17] faithful to forgive us
[59:19] we ask you to come this morning and help
[59:22] us while we're going to preach your word
[59:24] and i pray in jesus name amen
[59:29] isaiah 43 verse 22 but
[59:33] tao has not called upon me
[59:37] o jacob
[59:38] but tao has been worry of me o
[59:42] israel
[59:43] you may have your suit so
[59:47] this is quite a fair
[59:50] a verse
[59:52] you know and and
[59:53] god said to israel you has not called
[59:57] upon me
[1:00:01] because you
[1:00:03] has been worry of me
[1:00:06] now let me tell you that
[1:00:09] even if we are christian and we are
[1:00:12] convinced about the bible
[1:00:14] the truth the message but sometimes we
[1:00:18] just get
[1:00:19] tired
[1:00:24] we became idle
[1:00:28] there is no ask
[1:00:30] in our life
[1:00:32] there is we go to church
[1:00:34] and sometimes spiritually and physically
[1:00:39] we are tired
[1:00:41] we are boring
[1:00:43] no expectation
[1:00:48] no demand
[1:00:50] you have to be honest
[1:00:53] we all do that
[1:00:56] some period
[1:00:58] and
[1:00:59] no calling upon the lord
[1:01:02] no
[1:01:03] prayer
[1:01:04] life
[1:01:09] but tao has not called upon me
[1:01:13] oh jacob
[1:01:16] but thou has been wary of me
[1:01:20] could you imagine
[1:01:22] a kind of spiritual
[1:01:25] tiredness
[1:01:27] you know like amnesia
[1:01:31] and brother bronam said the church is
[1:01:33] like a woman in in her month
[1:01:36] you know there is some period you see
[1:01:39] and the church is likewise the same way
[1:01:42] we are not all the time in revival but
[1:01:45] we need to be in revival
[1:01:48] and it's like
[1:01:50] i used to sit to backslide
[1:01:52] it's like to run a car it's a manual car
[1:01:56] and you are
[1:01:58] driving on on on the fifth
[1:02:02] speed
[1:02:03] and
[1:02:04] you you go down to four
[1:02:08] you are still running but you go slower
[1:02:11] and after you go on the third
[1:02:13] and after you go on the second
[1:02:15] and after you go to the first
[1:02:17] at the first speed you don't
[1:02:21] go fast
[1:02:22] but you are still going
[1:02:25] you understand sometimes we are
[1:02:27] christian
[1:02:28] we are not
[1:02:29] backsliding like be in the world and
[1:02:32] drinking or smoking
[1:02:34] but we are going so slow
[1:02:37] you know in french there are it's the
[1:02:40] other word but that's mean the same
[1:02:42] thing you know i try to explain to give
[1:02:43] you uh an idea
[1:02:46] you know sometimes we lose our first
[1:02:48] zeal
[1:02:50] enthusiasts
[1:02:52] and joy
[1:02:54] in the old testament in the
[1:02:56] moses days
[1:02:58] you receive instruction how to build the
[1:03:00] altar according to the model gods showed
[1:03:04] him
[1:03:06] he built the altar and put the sacrifice
[1:03:09] and god
[1:03:11] sent
[1:03:12] down the fire
[1:03:16] see
[1:03:17] and the levite had to bring wood
[1:03:21] every morning
[1:03:23] to keep the fire burning on the altar
[1:03:29] you see
[1:03:31] you catch the idea at the pentecostal
[1:03:34] experience the fire fell
[1:03:37] but they have the responsibility
[1:03:41] they are sacrificed to bring wood
[1:03:45] to the altar to keep the fire burning
[1:03:48] what is wood
[1:03:50] humanity
[1:03:52] it's us
[1:03:54] you see to keep the fire burning we have
[1:03:57] to come to the altar
[1:04:00] every day
[1:04:02] to keep this fire burning if we don't
[1:04:05] bring the the sacrifice there is nothing
[1:04:08] to burn
[1:04:09] there is nothing there is no use for the
[1:04:12] fire
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:15] you see
[1:04:16] that's what we have to do
[1:04:18] just a wonderful type
[1:04:21] and you know the story of samson
[1:04:24] he had a good beginning
[1:04:26] a flirt would die with dalai la and each
[1:04:30] day she was after him to find the secret
[1:04:33] of his power
[1:04:36] and we know the story was in his hair
[1:04:39] consecration
[1:04:42] you see the consecration
[1:04:44] and because
[1:04:46] he neglected he became tired to keep his
[1:04:49] secret
[1:04:51] fell asleep
[1:04:53] and they cut his hair his hair and he
[1:04:56] became after blind
[1:04:58] when you lose your consecration little
[1:05:01] by little you become like blind there's
[1:05:04] a veil you don't see the glory of god
[1:05:06] you don't enjoy the power of god
[1:05:10] the visitation of god
[1:05:12] you see
[1:05:13] israel in their journey they crossed the
[1:05:16] red sea
[1:05:17] after they had the bitter water at mara
[1:05:21] they went through the sin dessert they
[1:05:24] hadn't food
[1:05:26] but god gave them the manna right
[1:05:29] as soon
[1:05:30] they said we are tired of
[1:05:34] that food
[1:05:37] they wanted meat
[1:05:41] and god sent them quails by tons
[1:05:45] and the lord smote the people with a
[1:05:48] very great plague
[1:05:51] and
[1:05:52] he called the name of that place you
[1:05:54] know there was i think two thousand two
[1:05:57] um 23 000 people who died like flies
[1:06:02] and he called the name of that place
[1:06:04] kibrat atahava
[1:06:07] because
[1:06:08] there they buried the people that lost
[1:06:12] meaning
[1:06:15] atahava means sepulture
[1:06:18] of desire
[1:06:21] if you have
[1:06:22] worldly desire
[1:06:25] you just please your flesh
[1:06:29] it's become a sepulcher a death
[1:06:32] of desire
[1:06:34] you see and today with the spiritual
[1:06:36] manner
[1:06:39] get tired of the spiritual manner
[1:06:46] and started to look after the things of
[1:06:48] the world
[1:06:49] you see you are in danger
[1:06:52] but thou has not called upon me or jacob
[1:06:56] but thou has been wary of me
[1:06:58] oh israel
[1:07:01] now we go to jose uh joshua and caleb
[1:07:04] you know there was 12 spies
[1:07:08] two were in the mind of christ
[1:07:12] god ten of them they were tired
[1:07:18] they criticized
[1:07:21] you know
[1:07:22] when somebody is sorry of god
[1:07:24] he always turned around himself and
[1:07:26] start to criticize criticize other
[1:07:29] criticized you know criticize
[1:07:31] and they were saying you are we are not
[1:07:33] able they were looking all the mistake
[1:07:36] of the message people church or whatever
[1:07:39] you know they look at the negatives
[1:07:41] thing you know
[1:07:43] how much
[1:07:44] you know we know we don't have to look
[1:07:46] uh to put our eyes on what's going on on
[1:07:49] all the churches and in the world in in
[1:07:52] all the false doctrine if you feed on
[1:07:55] that
[1:07:57] you won't be a happy people
[1:08:01] you know and those 10 spies they were
[1:08:03] feeding on that
[1:08:05] the negative point
[1:08:07] oh we are tired to wait upon god why we
[1:08:11] should not be in the promised land as
[1:08:13] soon and they start to criticize moses
[1:08:17] but caleb said he still the people
[1:08:20] shout your big mouth because they were
[1:08:23] crying they were saying we're going to
[1:08:25] going back to egypt
[1:08:27] when we were there at least we have
[1:08:29] sepulcher we have cucumber we have
[1:08:32] everything but here we don't know where
[1:08:34] this message bring us
[1:08:38] he quieted them
[1:08:40] and said let us go
[1:08:44] let us go up at once
[1:08:46] and possess it
[1:08:49] for we are well able to overcome it
[1:08:55] you know
[1:08:56] but
[1:08:57] those ten spies they were tired of god
[1:09:00] promises
[1:09:03] tire
[1:09:04] means doing nothing
[1:09:08] one day two men were speaking together
[1:09:11] one of them was giant he was a tall guy
[1:09:14] and the other one very small like me
[1:09:17] maybe
[1:09:19] my last name is petite means small
[1:09:21] hennia the small man admired the size of
[1:09:25] that giant
[1:09:26] my if i was as tall as you are i will
[1:09:31] fear nothing
[1:09:34] i will go in the forest to find the
[1:09:37] biggest beer
[1:09:38] that i could find
[1:09:40] and i will cut him in peace
[1:09:45] the giant was smiling at him and he said
[1:09:48] but
[1:09:49] there is a lot of small bears in those
[1:09:53] forests why don't you go and catch one
[1:10:02] you know sometimes we look at brother
[1:10:04] branham and oh how the mighty man of god
[1:10:08] he was and if i were him i will do that
[1:10:12] and i will do this
[1:10:15] but why are you where are are you not
[1:10:18] going to after small things
[1:10:22] you are sick you pray for people you
[1:10:24] pray for your kids
[1:10:27] why
[1:10:29] you see
[1:10:32] that's what we do something you know the
[1:10:33] prophet the apostle and if i were the
[1:10:37] apostle if i were but
[1:10:38] what is this message what is
[1:10:41] this message about it's about the bride
[1:10:46] it's about you
[1:10:48] you become the bride
[1:10:50] she and him is the same
[1:10:53] the work he did you will do it
[1:10:58] you see
[1:11:00] one day
[1:11:02] we might go tomorrow to niagara falls
[1:11:04] brother robert uh i've been once and
[1:11:07] well we'll see anyhow
[1:11:09] so
[1:11:09] one day years ago they want to do a
[1:11:12] suspended bridge over the niagara falls
[1:11:16] and they were discussing how to start to
[1:11:19] build a bridge over niagara falls
[1:11:24] how to cross the big cables over the
[1:11:27] river
[1:11:28] one day with a wind in good direction
[1:11:32] they send a kite
[1:11:34] over the river
[1:11:36] and then at the tiny small rope
[1:11:40] they attach a bigger rope
[1:11:43] and to the bigger rope they attach a
[1:11:46] cable
[1:11:47] and to the cable a big steel cable
[1:11:52] and finally they were able to build a
[1:11:55] bridge capable to support
[1:11:57] every big train
[1:11:59] you see
[1:12:02] small fate
[1:12:05] you see
[1:12:06] and from the small faith
[1:12:08] you know something you get
[1:12:11] something bigger
[1:12:13] something bigger and finally
[1:12:17] you you you know what i mean
[1:12:20] you see and so you start to exercise
[1:12:23] your faith
[1:12:25] don't stay idle
[1:12:28] send your little kite
[1:12:30] by the wind of the holy spirit
[1:12:34] and you send it by faith lord
[1:12:36] i sent it in your name
[1:12:40] and you see
[1:12:41] and you learn
[1:12:44] to get from god
[1:12:46] you learn to ask
[1:12:48] and you receive
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:52] he said uh in the message where i think
[1:12:55] pentecostal failed he said
[1:12:58] you can never exhaust god's love and
[1:13:01] mercy to you
[1:13:03] you say well i hate to bother you so
[1:13:06] much father
[1:13:08] he wants to be bothered that way
[1:13:11] he does don't never think that you could
[1:13:13] ever ask too much of god
[1:13:16] i believe the scripture said
[1:13:19] you have not because you ask not
[1:13:24] you and you ask not because you believe
[1:13:27] not
[1:13:29] he wants us to ask and believe
[1:13:33] that our joy would be full
[1:13:36] he wants you to ask abundantly
[1:13:41] first start to send your little
[1:13:44] kite
[1:13:46] and ask for a bigger thing he said ask
[1:13:48] for bigger things
[1:13:50] don't limit your faith to some little
[1:13:53] mustard seed
[1:13:56] get on out here to some other kind of
[1:13:59] faith and move out in big
[1:14:02] things
[1:14:04] the little kite
[1:14:06] more and more more and more more and
[1:14:09] more
[1:14:10] big things is just as easy to receive as
[1:14:14] little things
[1:14:17] you just have to believe that's all
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:25] you go on your reclining chair and all
[1:14:28] your worries
[1:14:30] you say and so what
[1:14:33] you see
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:36] he said you can put it right to work and
[1:14:40] it will just be fine
[1:14:43] amen amen
[1:14:46] see
[1:14:48] you
[1:14:49] don't expect
[1:14:51] you receive nothing
[1:14:54] you see and uh sometimes
[1:14:57] you don't have expectation
[1:15:00] and you think you could then you
[1:15:03] couldn't have more than what you have
[1:15:05] now
[1:15:06] okay so in your life
[1:15:08] the problem with us is a tradition
[1:15:12] we come to church
[1:15:13] and even brother robert
[1:15:17] went in a tradition
[1:15:19] while we were with brother
[1:15:22] our brother uh we were the first day we
[1:15:26] arrived he sit at a certain place in the
[1:15:28] table
[1:15:29] and so the next day he went to the same
[1:15:32] place and this morning he went to the
[1:15:33] same place i said now you develop a
[1:15:36] tradition
[1:15:38] but you know that's how we are human
[1:15:40] being but okay now
[1:15:43] i will ask you to follow me with your
[1:15:46] imagination
[1:15:47] suppose there is a wood chest
[1:15:50] okay like five feet long
[1:15:54] two and a half by two and a half high
[1:15:57] and there is a cover a lid right
[1:16:00] okay so now this is uh
[1:16:02] uh this is you that's to represent you
[1:16:05] so now somebody asked you
[1:16:08] to fill
[1:16:10] this
[1:16:10] wood chest with a
[1:16:13] tennis ball
[1:16:14] you know that the yellow tennis ball
[1:16:16] what color it is you fill it up and and

[1:16:24] is more place available oh no no no look
[1:16:27] i i put the
[1:16:29] lid and there i could not add even one
[1:16:31] more ball
[1:16:33] i said are you sure
[1:16:35] now
[1:16:36] i go somewhere
[1:16:38] i bring a big bucket
[1:16:40] of marble
[1:16:42] and i pour the marble
[1:16:44] in the wood chest and i put another one
[1:16:47] and three buckets of marble you know
[1:16:50] marble
[1:16:52] and and i and i said now you see you
[1:16:54] told me there was no more room
[1:16:57] and i proved you there was more room
[1:17:00] because you see there was more room and
[1:17:02] sometimes we come to church
[1:17:04] we well i expect nothing because i'm
[1:17:07] full i am a christian
[1:17:09] there is
[1:17:11] you know there is nothing i could
[1:17:12] receive more than that are you
[1:17:14] sure are you sure
[1:17:17] so now the the guys oh wow

[1:17:36] buckets of sand three buckets of sand

[1:17:43] i said you see you told me there was you
[1:17:45] were full but there was
[1:17:48] room for something else
[1:17:51] and now you
[1:17:52] start to crush your head
[1:17:54] wonderful
[1:17:56] are you sure that you are full with the
[1:17:58] holy spirit
[1:18:01] do you think that you could not have any

[1:19:38] amen
[1:19:40] he said we must go to the apostolic
[1:19:43] faith
[1:19:44] now what is the apostolic fate now
[1:19:46] remember this he said in the revelation
[1:19:49] of jesus christ
[1:19:50] christ is
[1:19:52] the true church in is a continuation of
[1:19:54] the book of acts
[1:19:57] but the book of revelation how shows how
[1:20:00] that antichrist spirit will come into
[1:20:03] the church and defile it
[1:20:06] making it lukewarm
[1:20:08] formal and
[1:20:10] powerless
[1:20:12] tire of god
[1:20:15] tradition
[1:20:16] doing nothing
[1:20:18] it exposed satan revealing his work
[1:20:21] attempted
[1:20:23] destruction of god's people
[1:20:26] in the discredit
[1:20:28] discrediting of god's word think about

[1:21:16] enough holy you see he and he say well
[1:21:20] he said well you know it was in the time
[1:21:22] of brother branham it was good for him
[1:21:25] it was good for wesley and
[1:21:28] for the pentagon you know he put the
[1:21:29] scripture to the word
[1:21:33] you see
[1:21:34] he cannot tell you that the word is the
[1:21:36] word is not true
[1:21:38] but it will delude it
[1:21:41] with anoint with unbelief
[1:21:44] you are not worthy you are not you are
[1:21:46] this and that you see discrete
[1:21:49] and
[1:21:50] he said he knows that if the people get
[1:21:52] the true revelation of the true church
[1:21:56] and that what she is that she stands for
[1:21:59] and that she cannot
[1:22:01] she can do greater worse
[1:22:06] she will be in the invincible army if
[1:22:08] they get the true revelation of the two
[1:22:11] spirits
[1:22:13] working
[1:22:15] don't think about other churches
[1:22:18] think about yourself
[1:22:22] amen don't go too far
[1:22:26] go in your own life
[1:22:29] check what what they will try to do with
[1:22:32] you
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:38] turn your our faith to the father's
[1:22:41] faith
[1:22:43] the church of study should be the same
[1:22:46] as the first one
[1:22:48] right
[1:22:49] and
[1:22:50] the characteristic one of the
[1:22:52] characteristics they were praying
[1:22:54] and fasting
[1:22:57] in the upper room
[1:22:59] they were waiting they were not order
[1:23:02] coffee at tim orton and drinking coffee
[1:23:04] and play cards and have fun they say hey
[1:23:07] we're going to receive the holy spirit
[1:23:09] when we don't know but let us drink
[1:23:11] coffee and have a meal
[1:23:13] no
[1:23:14] they were praying
[1:23:18] they were praying the apostles were too
[1:23:20] busy with the distribution of food and
[1:23:23] they placed deacon to spend time in
[1:23:26] prayers and
[1:23:28] on the world
[1:23:31] you see man even it's mentioning prayer
[1:23:33] first
[1:23:36] now we see there was a time where people
[1:23:38] were taking
[1:23:39] a shower once a week and they were
[1:23:42] praying every day and you know that now
[1:23:44] they
[1:23:45] they take a shower every day they pray
[1:23:47] once a week
[1:23:49] you see cornelius a centurion devote men
[1:23:53] which gave much ants to the people
[1:23:57] and prayed to god always
[1:24:03] always
[1:24:04] because he was praying while he was
[1:24:07] praying he saw an angel who told him
[1:24:10] send
[1:24:11] men to jaffa and call
[1:24:14] for one simian and bring him
[1:24:18] here
[1:24:20] he was in prayer
[1:24:23] when the angel came
[1:24:26] and he told he gave a message and now
[1:24:28] peter was in prayer
[1:24:33] also you see the phone was existing at
[1:24:36] that time
[1:24:38] and you didn't have to pay internet for
[1:24:40] a phone
[1:24:42] you know it was working so he was
[1:24:44] praying
[1:24:46] peter was praying also and there was a
[1:24:48] connection spiritual connection you see
[1:24:52] and uh
[1:24:53] you know the rest of the story uh peter
[1:24:56] was in prison and the church were
[1:24:58] continuously praying
[1:25:01] for peter
[1:25:03] paul at damascus after he met god became
[1:25:06] blind and he was praying
[1:25:10] and he had a vision
[1:25:12] and he saw nanya say
[1:25:14] in vision
[1:25:16] saw paul you see
[1:25:18] the work of the holy spirit the apostle
[1:25:21] established elder
[1:25:23] in prayers they were praying and fasting
[1:25:28] paul saw a vision one night
[1:25:31] a message in dunya
[1:25:34] praying
[1:25:35] and saying come to macedonia to help us
[1:25:40] you see
[1:25:43] he prayed and that's brought a vision
[1:25:47] and you see
[1:25:48] that's the way we the holy spirit
[1:25:50] communicate it's not by phone or email
[1:25:54] or text though though the lord could use
[1:25:56] that
[1:25:57] but now you know we rely too much on
[1:26:00] on
[1:26:01] natural things
[1:26:03] a natural church
[1:26:05] instead of having the supernatural
[1:26:09] god
[1:26:10] okay some some quote on prayers charles
[1:26:13] persian he said i would rather teach one
[1:26:16] man to pray than ten men to preach
[1:26:22] andrew murray we must pray with our eyes
[1:26:25] on god not on the difficulties
[1:26:30] as well chambers there is no other
[1:26:33] activity in life so important as that of
[1:26:37] prayer
[1:26:38] every other activities depend upon
[1:26:41] prayer for its best efficiency
[1:26:45] john bunyan
[1:26:47] prayer is not learning in the classroom
[1:26:50] but in the closet
[1:26:54] and drew murray
[1:26:56] prayer is not asking
[1:26:59] prayer is putting oneself in the hands
[1:27:02] of god and
[1:27:04] at his disposition
[1:27:07] and listening to his voice
[1:27:10] in the deep of our hearts
[1:27:16] prayer is listening
[1:27:18] not just asking
[1:27:21] louis
[1:27:22] he said the more you pray the less you
[1:27:25] panic
[1:27:27] the more you worship the less you worry
[1:27:32] you will feel more patient and less
[1:27:35] pressure martin luther i have so much to
[1:27:39] do that i will spend the first three
[1:27:42] hours in prayer
[1:27:44] wow it was getting
[1:27:47] early
[1:27:48] oswald chambers prayer
[1:27:50] does not fit us for the greater work
[1:27:54] prayer is the greater work
[1:28:00] the el modi
[1:28:02] he who nails the most
[1:28:05] stand the best
[1:28:09] brother branham sometimes we go off on
[1:28:12] the trend at 10 trumps somewhere and not
[1:28:15] think about god
[1:28:17] not pray over it
[1:28:19] ask the lord whether we should do it or
[1:28:23] not
[1:28:24] and we find out that our supply of
[1:28:27] blessing is cut off
[1:28:29] then we wonder sometimes well wonder why
[1:28:32] i can have no more blessing
[1:28:35] you don't watch
[1:28:37] you don't you
[1:28:39] let down in your prayer life you say
[1:28:42] well i'm a christian well that's the
[1:28:44] more sign you should pray
[1:28:46] more than ever
[1:28:48] read the bible every day
[1:28:51] pray every day don't make any decision
[1:28:54] too harshly or too quickly without first
[1:28:58] considering god about it
[1:29:01] ask him shall i do this father ask him
[1:29:05] is it your will for me to do this
[1:29:08] because we don't do that we make so much
[1:29:12] mistake
[1:29:13] then see what the holy spirit will
[1:29:16] speak to you
[1:29:19] it's not only asking is to hear the lord
[1:29:22] speaking to you
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:26] you might not give he might not give you
[1:29:28] a vision but he will speak in some way
[1:29:31] to you to let you know if you will be
[1:29:34] sincere
[1:29:36] and ask him you seem to be saying
[1:29:41] this word means something you know it's
[1:29:43] come from a french word i will explain
[1:29:46] to you
[1:29:47] there was a time they were um
[1:29:52] with clay they were doing a pot
[1:29:54] you know a clay
[1:29:56] and sometimes there was a little default
[1:29:59] in in in the the clay pot
[1:30:02] and they could use they will sell it and
[1:30:05] they could use in in the in there to
[1:30:07] cook something or to put something hot
[1:30:11] but uh the guy that was doing
[1:30:14] the
[1:30:15] the mold or the clay
[1:30:17] they they had the
[1:30:18] walks over
[1:30:20] to hide the holes or
[1:30:23] where it was not perfect or could link
[1:30:28] and so
[1:30:29] the person will buy it looked so nice
[1:30:32] you know
[1:30:33] but there was walks over
[1:30:35] to hide the problems
[1:30:37] that default and so you buy it you put
[1:30:40] some hot water
[1:30:42] and the water go all the way
[1:30:45] and so now
[1:30:47] after a while
[1:30:48] the person
[1:30:49] they start to
[1:30:51] to know about the trick
[1:30:53] and so they they will go to the the guy
[1:30:56] and they say okay now is that with walks
[1:30:58] or without walks
[1:31:02] you see and in french is is it
[1:31:05] esc avec c series watch or without c
[1:31:10] you know see
[1:31:11] and you see in censor or saint-saens
[1:31:14] french in english it's sincere
[1:31:18] are you without walks or you are with
[1:31:21] walks
[1:31:23] you see you cover your imperfection but
[1:31:25] god see it
[1:31:27] we cannot imitate something
[1:31:30] we have to be genuine
[1:31:32] sincere with god
[1:31:34] without walks we come to him we don't
[1:31:37] want to show something that we are not
[1:31:40] amen
[1:31:41] um
[1:31:44] okay
[1:31:52] the prophet said many many places that
[1:31:55] prayer is the greatest power that exists
[1:31:57] in the world you remember that
[1:32:00] amen
[1:32:01] he said prayer is the key
[1:32:04] that's the answer prayer changed things
[1:32:06] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:32:10] was ever put in the control of human
[1:32:13] being in the control of human being
[1:32:16] there is no atomic bombs
[1:32:18] or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[1:32:21] prayer
[1:32:23] prayer will change the mind of god
[1:32:26] did you know that yes
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:30] and there is another
[1:32:32] power that the prophet spoke about
[1:32:35] that is like
[1:32:37] atomic bomb is love now if you can join
[1:32:43] the two together
[1:32:44] what kind of a bomb you're going to have
[1:32:48] you see brother branham said he said all
[1:32:51] my ministry is based on one thing if i
[1:32:54] could love
[1:32:56] something will happen
[1:32:58] and love is project grace take over
[1:33:01] so could you imagine now
[1:33:03] you are a sincere
[1:33:06] christian
[1:33:07] and you are praying with love
[1:33:10] for somebody in hospital for any kind
[1:33:13] what kind of power you got
[1:33:17] sincere without walks
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:24] uh
[1:33:26] in the laodicean church he said
[1:33:29] if you disagree
[1:33:31] you happen to have no bitterness
[1:33:35] no indifference when it's come to
[1:33:37] fellowship with one another
[1:33:41] we love one another
[1:33:43] and if we don't do that
[1:33:46] well
[1:33:47] you will never go no farther in god
[1:33:51] until we do that
[1:33:54] so in life
[1:33:55] you are a christian sometimes it's
[1:33:57] different churches or opinion
[1:34:00] it's it's always it's happening all the
[1:34:02] time but you know and brother perry
[1:34:06] green
[1:34:09] he came in haiti with me
[1:34:11] years ago 2001
[1:34:14] it's over 20 years
[1:34:16] and he said
[1:34:19] brother branham told me that brother
[1:34:22] peregrine who told me that he said after
[1:34:25] my departure there will be
[1:34:27] if i remember well 17 different
[1:34:30] interpretations of the message
[1:34:34] brother nam you
[1:34:36] was following
[1:34:38] and
[1:34:40] and brother greene
[1:34:43] some
[1:34:45] believers were coming in town
[1:34:48] and
[1:34:48] he said they were criticized me
[1:34:52] and another group will come and they
[1:34:54] will criticize and
[1:34:56] and finally
[1:34:59] you know
[1:35:00] 17 different
[1:35:02] attendants or group came
[1:35:05] and one day he received a revelation
[1:35:08] the lord spoke to his heart he said if
[1:35:10] they don't love
[1:35:12] you why don't you love them
[1:35:16] you are not obligated to hate them
[1:35:19] if they don't love you
[1:35:21] why you do the same
[1:35:23] and from that time on it started when
[1:35:26] there was a new comer he started to held
[1:35:29] him he said brother do you need any
[1:35:30] chair or any assistant or something you
[1:35:33] know he changed his mind
[1:35:36] and finally he could count ominate
[1:35:38] doctrine came and finally there was one
[1:35:41] missing
[1:35:42] and he told me that i realized that was
[1:35:44] my
[1:35:45] interpretation
[1:35:50] you see jane chapter 5 16 say confess
[1:35:54] your faults
[1:35:56] one to another
[1:35:58] and pray for one for another that he may
[1:36:02] be healed
[1:36:04] sometimes okay
[1:36:06] i was reading the scripture many many
[1:36:08] times till i heard
[1:36:11] how brother branham
[1:36:13] uh interpret it
[1:36:15] you see confess your fault to one
[1:36:17] another and pray for one another that
[1:36:21] he may be ill not the other person
[1:36:24] you
[1:36:25] you see when you pray for somebody
[1:36:28] god see that's what brother abraham when
[1:36:31] you pray for somebody god see that and
[1:36:34] honor you and reward you and you receive
[1:36:37] healing
[1:36:40] amen could you imagine that
[1:36:42] you receive healing
[1:36:46] in the quote in the message jesus christ
[1:36:48] is the same he said i've seen
[1:36:51] god do great things but the greatest
[1:36:54] thing i ever seen in my life was love
[1:36:57] it's the most powerful force that stop
[1:37:00] anything there is is love
[1:37:03] love that move a mighty god
[1:37:07] he said in god's provided ways that love
[1:37:10] is the most powerful force
[1:37:13] there is in the world there is nothing
[1:37:15] as great as love
[1:37:17] power
[1:37:18] only in love
[1:37:21] power only in love
[1:37:24] amen
[1:37:26] i'm going to surprise you maybe but i'm
[1:37:28] going to read you
[1:37:30] a letter from albert einstein to his
[1:37:33] daughter
[1:37:34] it really moved me
[1:37:36] so albert einstein
[1:37:40] was born march 14 80 79
[1:37:44] and died in 8
[1:37:46] 18 april 55. it's perhaps
[1:37:50] best known as
[1:37:51] for being a theory called physics
[1:37:54] physicist
[1:37:55] and for receiving
[1:37:57] the
[1:37:58] 1921 nobel prize in physics for his
[1:38:02] service to
[1:38:03] theory called physic
[1:38:05] a lesser known fact about
[1:38:08] arguably one of the most intelligent men
[1:38:12] of modern time is that he was also a
[1:38:15] prolific sender of personal note and
[1:38:19] letters upon his own personality
[1:38:21] personalized letterhead
[1:38:24] in the late 1980s einstein daughter
[1:38:28] lieser
[1:38:29] donate to
[1:38:31] 1400 letters written by einstein to the
[1:38:35] hebrew university the text of one of
[1:38:38] them is reproduced below for you going
[1:38:41] to read it having been sent
[1:38:45] by einstein to his daughter this letter
[1:38:47] show a very different side of einstein
[1:38:51] personality and his outlook on the world
[1:38:55] when i proposed he said now that's
[1:38:57] einstein he said when i proposed the
[1:38:58] theory of relativity there a very few
[1:39:02] understood me
[1:39:03] and
[1:39:05] that i will reveal
[1:39:07] and what i'm going to reveal now to
[1:39:09] transmit to mind kind will also collide
[1:39:12] with misunderstanding and prejudice in
[1:39:16] the world
[1:39:17] i ask you to guard the letter as long as
[1:39:21] necessary years
[1:39:23] decade until society
[1:39:26] is advanced enough to accept what i will
[1:39:30] explain below
[1:39:33] there is an extremely powerful force
[1:39:37] that so far
[1:39:38] science has not found a formal
[1:39:42] explanation to
[1:39:45] it is a force that included all governs
[1:39:49] all others
[1:39:50] and
[1:39:51] is even behind any phenomenon operating
[1:39:55] in the universe and has not yet been
[1:39:59] identified by us
[1:40:03] this universal force
[1:40:05] is
[1:40:06] love
[1:40:10] when scientists look for a united
[1:40:13] unite
[1:40:14] unified the theory of the universe they
[1:40:18] forgot the most powerful unseen force
[1:40:22] love is light
[1:40:26] that enlighten those
[1:40:28] who give and receive it
[1:40:31] love is gravity
[1:40:34] because it makes some people feel
[1:40:37] attracted to
[1:40:38] others
[1:40:41] love is power
[1:40:43] because it multiplied the best we have
[1:40:46] and allows humanity not to be
[1:40:48] extinguished in their blind selfishness
[1:40:52] love unfolds and reveals for love we
[1:40:56] live and die love is god
[1:40:59] and god is love
[1:41:02] this force explained everything and gave
[1:41:05] meaning to life
[1:41:07] this is the variable that we have in
[1:41:10] your too far long
[1:41:13] maybe because we are afraid of love
[1:41:16] because it is the only energy in the
[1:41:19] universe that man has not learned to
[1:41:23] drive at will
[1:41:26] wow
[1:41:27] when we learn to give and receive this
[1:41:31] universal energy dear lester we will
[1:41:34] have affirmed that love conquers all
[1:41:41] is able to transcend everything and
[1:41:44] anything
[1:41:46] because love it's the quentin is the
[1:41:50] quintessences
[1:41:52] of life
[1:41:55] i remember
[1:41:57] a
[1:41:58] um little
[1:42:00] there was a woman and she was married
[1:42:03] and her mary was like a beast
[1:42:07] he was so
[1:42:09] hungry sometimes you know she was
[1:42:11] after she married him she was afraid of
[1:42:14] him
[1:42:15] and she didn't know what to do you know
[1:42:17] he was so violent
[1:42:19] and she went to see an old man in
[1:42:22] in the mountain and he has a reputation
[1:42:25] have some herbs
[1:42:26] and medication
[1:42:28] and she went to see him she said
[1:42:30] she explained the problem said what

[1:42:36] i have some herbs but i need
[1:42:40] four
[1:42:42] a hair of a mustache of a tiger
[1:42:47] so
[1:42:49] she said really
[1:42:53] so finally
[1:42:55] she said well if that could cure my
[1:42:57] husband i will
[1:42:59] find a way to find four hair of a
[1:43:02] mustache of her tiger so she went in the
[1:43:05] forest in india
[1:43:06] and she brought meat meat
[1:43:09] and she hiding
[1:43:11] under a tree and she waited and
[1:43:14] and finally after a couple hours the
[1:43:16] tiger came smell it and eat it so the
[1:43:19] next day she did she brought meat and
[1:43:22] that time he was around and she eat it
[1:43:25] and after she started to to get a little
[1:43:28] bit away from the hiding place and she
[1:43:32] gave
[1:43:32] meat and he came and day after day he
[1:43:35] small start to smell the lady and now
[1:43:39] she was approaching him all the time
[1:43:41] all the time and came a time where she
[1:43:45] barely bring the the meat and it was
[1:43:47] right coming next to her and so she
[1:43:50] started to touch him
[1:43:53] a little bit and he looked at her and he
[1:43:55] was eating
[1:43:57] and day after day she was patient and
[1:44:00] one day
[1:44:02] she just started to

[1:44:06] she went a
[1:44:08] full four year four or five enough
[1:44:12] to get four
[1:44:13] the tiger
[1:44:14] looked at her and

[1:44:19] and she she said to the woman i said
[1:44:21] here is the
[1:44:22] air the mustache of this tiger so he
[1:44:26] took it and there was fire next to him
[1:44:28] and he threw in the fire what are you
[1:44:30] doing
[1:44:32] he said well
[1:44:33] he said now he said

[1:44:40] and it will be all right
[1:44:45] conquer with love
[1:44:47] be nice feel it
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:54] he said i deeply regret not having been
[1:44:57] able to express what is in my heart
[1:45:00] which was quietly beaten for you all my
[1:45:03] life
[1:45:04] maybe it's too late
[1:45:06] to apologize but as time is relative
[1:45:09] i need to tell you
[1:45:11] that i love you and thanks to you i have
[1:45:15] reached the ultimate
[1:45:17] answer your father
[1:45:19] albert einstein
[1:45:24] amen
[1:45:27] so prayer is something that you have to
[1:45:30] slow down it's not like
[1:45:32] uh driving through
[1:45:35] what you want
[1:45:36] coffee
[1:45:37] doughnuts and
[1:45:39] and you look and uh hey it's so slow
[1:45:43] this morning and you think
[1:45:45] prayer is something that you have to
[1:45:47] slow down
[1:45:49] and when you nail of course
[1:45:52] you will start to to think about oh i
[1:45:54] have to do to do this thing today i have
[1:45:57] to go there and i have to come
[1:45:59] accomplish that and and you know what
[1:46:02] it's a trick
[1:46:03] you are nailing down
[1:46:05] and
[1:46:06] your mind is busy so write what you have
[1:46:09] to do
[1:46:11] okay and after you go on okay you write
[1:46:14] it
[1:46:15] you write it and after a while it's over
[1:46:18] you wrote whatever you you want to do
[1:46:20] and your mind start to relax
[1:46:23] and you get you know little by little in
[1:46:26] the spirit and you stay quiet
[1:46:29] you close all the doors of your mind
[1:46:32] and take your time and wait what the
[1:46:34] lord has to tell you
[1:46:37] you see it's not just us it's not a
[1:46:39] grocery
[1:46:41] list
[1:46:42] you see it's it's a communion
[1:46:45] you see
[1:46:46] um
[1:46:49] yeah
[1:46:50] so
[1:46:52] the power of decision he said uh
[1:46:54] you know
[1:46:56] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:46:58] today it
[1:46:59] don't get in the spirit enough
[1:47:03] we are too
[1:47:04] much in yourself in our self my if you
[1:47:08] just get out of your your cell long
[1:47:11] enough
[1:47:13] you say well you know our church is
[1:47:16] they have their regular routine oh
[1:47:19] who cares about your routine get in the
[1:47:23] spirit
[1:47:24] then you can see things done
[1:47:29] you see
[1:47:30] i remember one time i was
[1:47:32] in my office
[1:47:34] i was
[1:47:35] nailing praying next to my
[1:47:37] my desk the phone rang so i took it and
[1:47:41] there was a secretary at the bank she
[1:47:44] said mr petey if we understand i don't
[1:47:47] remember exactly what she said if i
[1:47:49] understand you want to change the the
[1:47:52] amount of that money from that account
[1:47:55] to the other one and i was listening and
[1:47:58] you know i was i was my mind was in
[1:48:00] prayer and when she said that you want
[1:48:03] me to do that i said amen
[1:48:06] suddenly i realized
[1:48:08] what in the world
[1:48:09] i said to her
[1:48:11] so
[1:48:12] i didn't know what to do i said i cannot
[1:48:14] explain her because i was praying the in
[1:48:17] my mockery or it was my hang up so
[1:48:21] another time i was praying at pawn range
[1:48:25] and
[1:48:26] i was
[1:48:28] i was somewhere else and i said alleluia
[1:48:33] it was between an ello and hallelujah
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:40] there was a man one day you know
[1:48:42] he went to see a pastor he said pastor i
[1:48:47] don't know how to pray
[1:48:50] i don't know
[1:48:51] well he said this very simple
[1:48:54] he said
[1:48:56] praying is is talking to god oh there is
[1:48:59] a chariot he said praying is talking to
[1:49:02] god
[1:49:03] so you imagine
[1:49:05] that the lord jesus is here and you sit
[1:49:08] down
[1:49:09] oh maybe i should demonstrate in a
[1:49:12] better way
[1:49:13] i hope you are not too
[1:49:16] you know i could be a little bit longer
[1:49:18] but i don't want any help so he said you
[1:49:20] stand you sit down you relax
[1:49:23] and you imagine that the lord jesus is
[1:49:26] right in the front of you
[1:49:28] and you talk with him
[1:49:31] you say you know lord jesus um
[1:49:33] i'm so a bad person
[1:49:35] i do nothing good
[1:49:37] and you talk and you talk and
[1:49:40] and finally after a while you you start
[1:49:43] to feel something
[1:49:45] the lord starts to talk to you
[1:49:47] so you shout your big mouth and you
[1:49:49] listen god
[1:49:51] and after a while
[1:49:53] you know the man like it you know he he
[1:49:56] followed the advice and he liked it so
[1:49:59] much that from that time on he will put
[1:50:02] a chair in front he will sit down and
[1:50:05] he will talk to jesus
[1:50:08] prayer is talking to jesus
[1:50:14] it's very simple
[1:50:16] but finally he gets sick
[1:50:18] and
[1:50:19] he was
[1:50:20] in the
[1:50:21] dying bed or clothes and his daughter
[1:50:25] said papa i'm going in town are you okay
[1:50:28] i will be back in
[1:50:30] one hour or so
[1:50:31] and
[1:50:32] he said oh no don't be wary
[1:50:35] i will be fine and so when she came back
[1:50:39] he was in the bed
[1:50:41] he was already with the lord but
[1:50:44] it was strange
[1:50:46] because he lay his head
[1:50:48] on the next chair the chair close to his
[1:50:52] bed
[1:50:53] and she said to the pastor i said it's
[1:50:54] very strange i said when i find him
[1:50:58] his head wasn't laying
[1:51:01] over the chair
[1:51:02] oh he said i know why
[1:51:04] i teach him to talk to jesus
[1:51:08] well we led the chair there
[1:51:11] amen
[1:51:13] amen
[1:51:18] but the greatest thing i have found in
[1:51:20] christian life is letting the holy
[1:51:22] spirit lead you and guide you
[1:51:26] and his work is marvelous
[1:51:29] he move in the mysterious ways
[1:51:32] his wonders to perform
[1:51:35] you see i gave you the other day the
[1:51:37] example of my five dollar in the bank
[1:51:40] account i went in my knees i said lord
[1:51:44] this is your problem this is not my
[1:51:46] problem and the river i said i know what
[1:51:49] to do to cross the river i said i know
[1:51:52] to do
[1:51:53] we
[1:51:54] we pray
[1:51:55] and we say lord i don't know what to do
[1:51:58] and that's it
[1:52:00] and the reclining chair
[1:52:03] your worry and so what
[1:52:05] you relax yourself you relieve yourself
[1:52:09] you see uh in the hebrews he said and
[1:52:12] when god
[1:52:13] make a promise in the bible i see a man
[1:52:16] here in the wheelchair
[1:52:18] when god make a promise he is guilty
[1:52:23] of that promise
[1:52:25] unless he bring it to pass
[1:52:29] god is guilty when he makes a promise
[1:52:33] and it's got to be fulfilled or god is
[1:52:37] guilty could you imagine
[1:52:41] so god made a promise and you believe it
[1:52:46] right
[1:52:47] and if you don't believe it and say lord
[1:52:50] you said this and that
[1:52:53] you have to respond
[1:52:55] and you know sometimes you say oh this
[1:52:57] is not polite no
[1:52:59] god like it when you take to his word he
[1:53:01] said lord i will not accept anything
[1:53:04] else that what you said
[1:53:07] you give a promise
[1:53:08] you will fulfill it
[1:53:11] amen
[1:53:13] amen
[1:53:16] he said in the believing god he said all
[1:53:19] things are possible to him that believes
[1:53:23] now you know
[1:53:24] if it isn't jesus told something wrong
[1:53:29] is that right
[1:53:31] when then it lays within you
[1:53:36] it's nothing god
[1:53:39] you understand
[1:53:40] he said all things are possible
[1:53:42] okay he said you know if it's not true
[1:53:45] jesus said something wrong but he said
[1:53:48] the right thing
[1:53:49] he said then it lays
[1:53:52] within you it's your responsibility to
[1:53:55] believe it
[1:53:57] and
[1:53:58] i mean
[1:54:00] well
[1:54:01] yesterday or first night i i
[1:54:04] i
[1:54:06] i talked about that you know too often
[1:54:08] we look to our
[1:54:09] ourself and you know
[1:54:12] and this is wrong we look at our
[1:54:15] self righteousness
[1:54:17] and holiness we have none
[1:54:20] god has it you see this is not mine that
[1:54:23] he is
[1:54:24] you see
[1:54:26] now we have to feed on the word
[1:54:30] to become the word
[1:54:32] and it's the same thing today see the
[1:54:34] very thing that the church is watering
[1:54:37] that is the seed the seed of the word
[1:54:41] it's the very word that
[1:54:44] becomes life and carry us to our own
[1:54:47] seed bridegroom
[1:54:50] you see i was reading something
[1:54:54] wonderful
[1:54:55] about bees
[1:54:56] and the queens
[1:54:58] you see the natural
[1:55:00] type the spiritual
[1:55:02] so the queens the bees the queens of
[1:55:05] bees lay her eggs
[1:55:08] in al
[1:55:09] veolus right
[1:55:11] the nurse
[1:55:13] bees
[1:55:14] or workers
[1:55:16] fed the larva with a special food called
[1:55:20] royal jelly from a special glen that
[1:55:24] they have in their head for
[1:55:27] three days
[1:55:29] you understand me so they have fed by a
[1:55:32] natural
[1:55:34] food
[1:55:36] royal jelly for three days for the
[1:55:39] laborers
[1:55:40] you see justification
[1:55:42] sanctification
[1:55:45] step
[1:55:46] listen to the rest it's amazing
[1:55:49] and after
[1:55:51] they feed them
[1:55:53] with honey
[1:55:55] and they become
[1:55:56] these workers
[1:55:59] three days
[1:56:01] a special food
[1:56:03] royal julie after three days
[1:56:06] honey only
[1:56:08] but for the future queens
[1:56:12] with s
[1:56:15] selected
[1:56:18] you know they are just eggs as
[1:56:21] the other one
[1:56:22] they could became just labors
[1:56:25] but after
[1:56:27] selected after three days they still
[1:56:30] receive the same food
[1:56:33] the whale chili
[1:56:36] and because of that their dna change
[1:56:42] and transform them in a queen
[1:56:46] and they will be fed by this kind of
[1:56:49] food for the rest of their
[1:56:55] man life about it
[1:56:58] you know the denomination they have
[1:57:01] honey that's good they have
[1:57:03] spiritual
[1:57:04] jelly but after three days it's over but
[1:57:07] for the bride
[1:57:09] the four days the fifth days
[1:57:12] feed on this
[1:57:13] jelly and they're d and a think about it
[1:57:17] our d and d
[1:57:19] what we are will be change in the moment
[1:57:22] in the winter in the heights will go in
[1:57:24] the rapture
[1:57:26] the word as a power transformation
[1:57:29] [Applause]
[1:57:31] you see the the word you feed on bring
[1:57:35] make you a new
[1:57:37] thing
[1:57:38] a bride
[1:57:40] a queen
[1:57:45] yes
[1:57:46] wow
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:50] a couple of times ago last summer i
[1:57:53] don't remember sister suzanne she find a
[1:57:55] caterpillar
[1:57:57] and she put in a jar with a little piece
[1:58:00] of wood
[1:58:01] and
[1:58:03] the next day
[1:58:05] this caterpillar make a little envelope
[1:58:08] she eyed
[1:58:10] himself
[1:58:12] in a cucumber
[1:58:13] cocoon
[1:58:16] you you follow me
[1:58:17] and so
[1:58:19] i was surprised because just the next
[1:58:21] day or two days after
[1:58:23] just kept up a little disappear
[1:58:25] where is the the
[1:58:27] capital she is in the mysterious
[1:58:31] time of
[1:58:32] transformation you know for us christian
[1:58:36] we wrap ourselves in the lord
[1:58:40] we make
[1:58:41] a new
[1:58:42] habitation
[1:58:46] we hide ourselves in christ
[1:58:50] and of course we took the
[1:58:52] royal jelly
[1:58:54] and
[1:58:55] after a couple weeks
[1:58:57] one day
[1:58:59] once in a while i was wondering if this
[1:59:02] the caterpillar was still alive
[1:59:04] and i was shaking this little jar
[1:59:07] and i could see once in a while there
[1:59:09] was a little move
[1:59:11] small
[1:59:12] but i knew there was life in that but
[1:59:15] one day a wonderful caterpillar
[1:59:19] came out of this hiding place
[1:59:23] was completely different
[1:59:25] than a caterpillar
[1:59:28] was a beautiful butterfly
[1:59:30] that has
[1:59:32] antennas
[1:59:33] big eyes
[1:59:34] and now the big difference this
[1:59:36] caterpillar could fly
[1:59:39] in heavenly places
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:44] could fly she was free from the world
[1:59:46] she could fly in heavenly places
[1:59:49] because it was change inside
[1:59:52] [Applause]
[1:59:55] amen peter said born from uncorruptable
[1:59:59] sea by the word of god could you imagine
[2:00:02] how powerful is the word of god
[2:00:09] wow
[2:00:12] i almost over
[2:00:15] you say praise the lord
[2:00:18] i like so much you i love you so much
[2:00:20] today
[2:00:21] okay
[2:00:22] you see i i brought this quote but i
[2:00:25] would just read the first part
[2:00:28] the word became flesh he said then when
[2:00:31] the human element goes out and the
[2:00:33] spirit of god filled that vacancy
[2:00:36] where you empty yourself amen then will
[2:00:40] be when the church
[2:00:42] it its power of the resurrection of the
[2:00:45] lord jesus will walk in his step
[2:00:48] in his power
[2:00:50] and history
[2:00:52] in his being and his moving you see what
[2:00:55] i mean then
[2:00:56] utah will become words and words will
[2:00:59] become materials
[2:01:01] that's when the church in power
[2:01:06] wow
[2:01:07] how many believe that
[2:01:10] i don't ask you to understand that but
[2:01:13] to believe it
[2:01:14] i believe it
[2:01:16] i believe it
[2:01:20] one day there was a hunter
[2:01:23] and he got lost in the forest
[2:01:26] because of his stubbornness
[2:01:30] he had a compass
[2:01:33] but he didn't use it because he was very
[2:01:36] confident
[2:01:38] in his ability to find his way
[2:01:42] so he was
[2:01:44] walking since a long time when he
[2:01:46] realized that he was lost but was
[2:01:50] already too late to consult his compass
[2:01:54] was dark
[2:01:56] so we built a shelter
[2:01:59] with branches and leaves
[2:02:01] to spend the night
[2:02:03] the next day
[2:02:04] he decided that he was smart enough
[2:02:08] to find his way back
[2:02:10] but the day went through without
[2:02:13] progressing
[2:02:16] at least he decided to consult his
[2:02:19] compass
[2:02:21] he thought that he had been stupid
[2:02:23] enough
[2:02:25] and he reached from his pocket his
[2:02:27] compass and soon he find his way home
[2:02:33] i think you start to understand where i
[2:02:35] i want to come
[2:02:37] our compass is prayer
[2:02:41] you see the word
[2:02:44] the word guide us but we have a compass
[2:02:48] the compass is prayer
[2:02:51] to know what to do to know where
[2:02:54] to act when
[2:02:56] you see
[2:03:00] to listen him in his will
[2:03:03] to surrender
[2:03:04] to him so now
[2:03:06] i'm going to
[2:03:07] [Music]

[2:03:36] angel you know god has a voice and the
[2:03:39] only way to make it

[2:06:40] you now we're in the clouds flying along
[2:06:42] with no pilot and my friend in the back
[2:06:44] seat said we're dead aren't we i said
[2:06:46] there's a very good chance of that yes
[2:06:48] he said what are we gonna do i said i
[2:06:50] don't know but there was a radio right
[2:06:52] there and i handed him the microphone
[2:06:54] and i said start asking for help so he's
[2:06:57] in the back seat reaching up and he said
[2:06:58] hello hello we didn't know any proper
[2:07:01] radio etiquette all we were saying was
[2:07:02] hello and somebody answered back hello
[2:07:05] hello don't you guys know proper radio
[2:07:07] etiquette and i said give me i said we
[2:07:09] don't know nothing tell them we're in an
[2:07:11] airplane with a passed out pilot and we
[2:07:13] don't know how to fly this plane the guy
[2:07:15] said i'm a freighter flying out of
[2:07:16] anchorage on the way to tokyo and he
[2:07:18] said you're telling me you have nobody
[2:07:20] who can fly that plane with you said
[2:07:21] tell them that's correct now you gotta
[2:07:23] understand i am sweating bullets he said
[2:07:26] the first thing i'm going to do is start
[2:07:28] circling so i don't lose you
[2:07:30] because i'll fly out of range of your
[2:07:32] radio and you won't have me anymore
[2:07:35] and he said i'm going to get anchorage
[2:07:36] emergency for you an anchorage emergency
[2:07:39] will be the people that can maybe help
[2:07:40] you
[2:07:41] try to save your life after about five
[2:07:44] minutes anchorage came on said we
[2:07:46] understand you have a passed out pilot
[2:07:48] and those of you do not know how to fly
[2:07:50] that plane we said that's right they
[2:07:51] said well the first thing we got to do
[2:07:53] is find you now never forget what this
[2:07:55] man at anchorage said he said
[2:07:58] my job is to get you home safe he said
[2:08:00] that's my job but he said here's the
[2:08:02] deal if you want me to get you home safe
[2:08:04] you got to promise me you'll obey my
[2:08:06] voice he said you can't see me but i can
[2:08:09] see you and he said if you're not gonna
[2:08:11] obey my voice
[2:08:12] you're gonna die
[2:08:14] when you can't see anything
[2:08:16] you have no idea how disorientated you
[2:08:18] become
[2:08:19] finally he said okay i found you now
[2:08:21] hear me clear
[2:08:23] he said you're four minutes from a
[2:08:24] mountain he said you're going to crash
[2:08:26] in that mountain and die follow my voice
[2:08:29] i never said
[2:08:31] i have to follow your voice
[2:08:35] is that reasonable
[2:08:37] you see i understood without his voice
[2:08:40] i had nothing and do you understand
[2:08:43] without god's voice you have nothing
[2:08:47] nothing
[2:08:48] finally he got us turned and he said i'm
[2:08:51] freezing all the traffic in the area he
[2:08:53] said it's going to take me an hour and a
[2:08:55] half to get you to anchorage and there's
[2:08:56] a lot of weather between you and
[2:08:58] anchorage you're in for a rough ride and
[2:09:00] he said i want you to hear me i don't
[2:09:01] want you to look at what's going on
[2:09:03] outside i don't want you to pay
[2:09:04] attention to the storm just my voice he
[2:09:08] said if you start watching the storm you
[2:09:10] will die
[2:09:12] but i'll take you through it
[2:09:14] now because they cleared all the traffic
[2:09:16] several pilots
[2:09:18] those nighttime freighters those 747
[2:09:21] started talking to us
[2:09:25] they said we're praying for you men
[2:09:30] you're going to make it
[2:09:32] but listen to the voice
[2:09:35] that's the key they said trust the voice
[2:09:39] you realize your head is full of voices
[2:09:41] and everybody in this world wants to
[2:09:43] talk to you and everybody wants to be
[2:09:45] the controlling voice and god says i
[2:09:48] want you to be a living sacrifice i want
[2:09:51] you to put yourself on the altar and let
[2:09:53] my voice be your voice finally we went
[2:09:55] through the worst of the weather but
[2:09:56] there was still more
[2:09:58] and then the voice came back and it said
[2:10:00] now
[2:10:01] i'm going to line you up he said i'm
[2:10:03] going to bring you in right down the
[2:10:05] runway and at the foot of the runway are
[2:10:07] some lights and they're in the form of a
[2:10:09] cross he said don't you forget this
[2:10:12] the cross is the way home
[2:10:17] finally he's bringing us down
[2:10:20] we still can't see anything
[2:10:22] and all he kept saying is stay with me
[2:10:25] my sheep the bible says hear my voice
[2:10:28] and they follow me
[2:10:30] finally just a couple hundred feet off
[2:10:32] the ground we saw the cross
[2:10:34] i landed the plane
[2:10:36] in fact i landed it seven times
[2:10:39] finally it all came to a stop and the
[2:10:41] minute we stopped the pilot woke up the
[2:10:44] voice said
[2:10:46] thanks for listening
[2:10:50] i watch them crash and burn all the time
[2:10:52] because they won't follow my voice
[2:10:55] they don't understand i'm the one who
[2:10:56] can see them even when they can't see me
[2:10:59] but they get the voices in their head
[2:11:02] and they kill themselves
[2:11:05] they self-destruct
[2:11:08] thanks for listening to the voice
[2:11:10] then they put us in a motel room in
[2:11:12] about
[2:11:13] four in the morning
[2:11:15] the knock at my door
[2:11:18] and i opened the door and
[2:11:20] a man was standing and he said hello
[2:11:22] david
[2:11:23] i said you're the voice you're the one
[2:11:25] who got me home
[2:11:27] he said i am
[2:11:30] do you understand one day you're going
[2:11:32] to stand before him and say you were the
[2:11:34] voice
[2:11:36] you're the voice that brought
[2:11:38] me
[2:11:39] home
[2:11:41] if you're not on that altar as a living
[2:11:43] sacrifice
[2:11:46] your head's full of voices
[2:11:49] and then we wonder why kids crash and
[2:11:51] burn
[2:11:53] we wonder why marriages are shattered
[2:11:57] and the lord's saying i'm the one
[2:12:01] who has the voice all i can remember is
[2:12:03] that voice saying stay with me
[2:12:06] stay with me
[2:12:09] don't listen to what's going on in your
[2:12:10] head and don't watch the storm stay with
[2:12:13] me
[2:12:16] and i'll take you through
[2:12:19] tonight you have a god
[2:12:22] who has promised to take you through
[2:12:26] a living sacrifice
[2:12:29] holy
[2:12:32] amen
[2:12:34] [Applause]
[2:12:39] amen
[2:12:40] may we stand up
[2:12:43] what's a moving testimony
[2:12:46] and so
[2:12:48] it's so accurate for ourselves in the
[2:12:50] time we're living
[2:12:52] there is so much confusion even even
[2:12:56] among us
[2:12:57] message believer
[2:12:59] but
[2:13:00] if we listen to a voice
[2:13:04] you know even
[2:13:05] sorry to say that but
[2:13:07] brother joseph you know that the
[2:13:09] philosophy is a
[2:13:12] churches and
[2:13:14] minister does mistake and only
[2:13:17] brother branham doesn't make mistakes so
[2:13:19] we have to skip church and
[2:13:21] this is a nonsense
[2:13:23] you see the ministry
[2:13:25] are there also
[2:13:26] to
[2:13:27] repeat that voice to bring that voice
[2:13:31] to be with the people to communion
[2:13:33] together
[2:13:35] let us pray heavenly father
[2:13:43] thank you so much for your voice
[2:13:45] in that time of confusion
[2:13:49] time of trouble
[2:13:50] time of storms
[2:13:53] of confusion
[2:13:55] and
[2:13:57] everywhere people say listen to me or
[2:14:00] listen to that
[2:14:03] doctrine or whatever but we are so
[2:14:06] thankful
[2:14:08] for you that you send a real voice and
[2:14:12] that was not the voice of a man was a
[2:14:14] voice of god in a man
[2:14:17] and we recognized it
[2:14:18] like a little story
[2:14:21] about beethoven
[2:14:23] and
[2:14:23] the music he composed
[2:14:27] the little girl the blind little girl
[2:14:30] she recognized
[2:14:31] the voice she said that's the master
[2:14:35] and that's the same thing for us we
[2:14:37] recognize through this wonderful message
[2:14:41] we recognize your voice
[2:14:43] and that voice
[2:14:45] will lead us through storm
[2:14:48] deception
[2:14:50] to tempest
[2:14:52] right back to home
[2:14:55] we thank you for the time we had this
[2:14:57] morning we ask your blessing upon the
