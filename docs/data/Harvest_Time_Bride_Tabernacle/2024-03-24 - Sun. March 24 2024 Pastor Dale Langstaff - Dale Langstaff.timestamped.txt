[24:23] amen amen God bless you this morning
[24:25] it's just a great privilege to be here
[24:29] and great great
[24:36] privilege we had the privilege of having
[24:39] our part of our small choir we just love
[24:42] to have Sister Anne and sister Alice
[24:45] next time but they were at our place and
[24:48] so we had a little singspiration last
[24:52] night we had a wonderful
[24:56] time and you could you could tell that
[24:58] your kids came from Heaven because they
[25:00] were just like
[25:02] angels and and that that's actually the
[25:06] truth amen
[25:09] hallelujah just
[25:12] uh just uh want to minister on a a
[25:16] thought here this morning and I'm not
[25:17] sure that I will I will I will finish
[25:20] I'll just uh watch the clock and maybe
[25:23] the clock or God one or the other will
[25:25] tell me if I finish or not but let's
[25:27] turn to Matthew
[25:29] 24:14 and it I would encourage you to to
[25:32] read Matthew 24 I listened and read it
[25:35] many many times and this week I know you
[25:38] have two but Matthew 24 talks about
[25:41] everything in the end times everything
[25:44] preparing for going home in a
[25:47] Rapture and and everything how it will
[25:50] be multiple multiple Parables and
[25:53] Matthew 24 is a long a long verse but I
[25:56] always want to touch on this one verse
[25:58] and I want to go into a a thought that I
[26:01] believe God laid on our heart and and
[26:04] just uh just uh that just came to me
[26:07] just remember next Sunday brother Kyle
[26:08] will be with us and we just look forward
[26:11] to Fantastic fellowship with them and
[26:14] the whole weekend also I put up a couple
[26:16] posters of camper different camps out
[26:19] just under the speaker and I would
[26:22] encourage everybody to to do all you can
[26:25] to be with your brothers and sisters
[26:27] amen let's enjoy each other here before
[26:30] we get there amen it's uh it's not just
[26:34] amen it's a great body worldwide bride
[26:38] amen and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[26:41] shall be preached in all the world for a
[26:45] witness unto all
[26:49] nations and then the end shall come Lord
[26:53] Jesus we pray that you would just uh be
[26:56] with your word this morning and may you
[26:58] just just move the speaker out of the
[26:59] way and even move the hearer out of the
[27:01] way Lord God and may they hear you may
[27:05] we hear you and speak you this morning
[27:07] we pray and we give you the glory for it
[27:10] in your name amen amen I want to preach
[27:13] on a
[27:15] topic
[27:17] uh that you may have your seats that
[27:19] brother Brown mentioned on many times
[27:22] the he preached on it the Revelation
[27:23] that was given to me and the great the
[27:26] angel and and his commission the angel
[27:29] explaining his commission and and uh but
[27:32] I want to show you that you know when we
[27:34] get into the end time there will be no
[27:38] excuses there will absolutely be no
[27:40] excuses so we see in this scripture that
[27:42] we can't go home until all the nations
[27:46] have heard this truth this message that
[27:49] we believe this message of Christ amen
[27:52] and never in a generation before has it
[27:54] been possible through technology amen
[27:58] and even places where you can't go as a
[28:00] human being there is the word of God
[28:03] sent through the waves amen and even
[28:06] what uh you know brother Brown said even
[28:08] with TV he said God meant it for good
[28:11] and Satan used it for evil and that's
[28:13] with all technology but there is a good
[28:16] side to it and it will spread the word
[28:18] of God and I want to look into the signs
[28:20] of the times and Wednesday night we
[28:22] preached on the the five raptures that
[28:24] have happened in the Bible one hasn't
[28:26] happened yet one will happen that's us
[28:28] us going home but the four raptures that
[28:30] have
[28:31] happened amen and so this is not a new
[28:34] thing that's happened it's happened four
[28:36] other times and we're going to be the
[28:37] fifth time to go in a Rapture and that
[28:40] will be Grace amen and so we praise God
[28:42] for that but we see that you know the
[28:45] Bible says that no man knows the time or
[28:47] the hour but we'll know the season and
[28:50] so we wonder how is God showing this and
[28:52] we know this by Israel and the Fig Tree
[28:55] and she'll bring forth her bud and and
[28:57] all these things and we know that Israel
[28:59] maybe I'll just read that this thought
[29:01] what the prophet said you know Israel
[29:02] became a nation in 46 on Wednesday night
[29:05] I think I said 48 and I was off amen
[29:08] forgive me but uh Israel became a nation
[29:10] in 46 and people that were born then are
[29:13] are are still alive but but they're this
[29:16] generation won't pass away so we're at
[29:18] the end times amen as in the days of
[29:20] Sodom and Gomorrah and we so we have
[29:23] arrived in many many areas you know it
[29:25] talks about wars and rumors of wars but
[29:27] the time is not yet now we know that we
[29:29] got lots of Wars but the time ain't yet
[29:31] but we do have Sodom and Gomorrah and we
[29:34] do have the generation of Israel the
[29:36] generation that was born in the time of
[29:38] Israel are going
[29:41] to be soon be a
[29:44] generation so we see that and here
[29:46] brother Bram said this comment so I
[29:48] looked up in the message I looked up
[29:50] God's first Bible amen and uh and I
[29:55] looked up that and then I I'm going to
[29:56] and I looked up another one I said
[29:58] before God does anything and and brother
[30:00] Bram in uh God's first Bible he
[30:03] mentioned that 51 times in the message
[30:06] and before God does anything he mentions
[30:08] that eight times and I want to read just
[30:11] short clips to lay a foundation of the
[30:14] Prophet setting our expectations you
[30:16] know God's coming for those that are
[30:19] watching for him now in Matthew 24 later
[30:22] in the chapter it talks about if the
[30:23] good man knew when the thief was going
[30:25] to come by his house he would have been
[30:27] prepared for him and it finishes that
[30:30] Parable by watch there far because he
[30:34] comes when you do not expect him amen
[30:37] and we are are trapped in human bodies
[30:40] and and even though you have the baptism
[30:42] of the Holy Ghost you are still plagued
[30:44] by this uh by this Badger skin of Flesh
[30:48] and we just in our Natural Body we're a
[30:51] Triune being and our Natural Body we
[30:54] have always been taught that it'll never
[30:57] happen to me
[30:59] it it will happen to everybody else but
[31:01] but not me it won't be me that gets sick
[31:03] or it won't be me that it won't be me
[31:05] that has a bad marriage or it won't be
[31:07] me that am man and it won't be me that
[31:10] the Rapture happens in my lifetime but I
[31:13] believe it will be me amen I totally
[31:16] believe it'll be me I don't just believe
[31:17] it'll be me I believe it'll be us
[31:20] that'll happen our re in our in our
[31:22] generation so let's look at in the time
[31:25] the first Bible God wrote and I'm just
[31:27] going to go through these five this is
[31:28] this this first one I'm going to read
[31:30] it's actually reversed it's a
[31:32] 65128
[31:34] quote so it's rap before God took our
[31:36] Prophet but the first Bible he ever was
[31:38] wrote he wrote in the
[31:41] skies the next uh you know that was in
[31:43] God's provided way of worship the next
[31:45] one is God's first Bible he wrote In The
[31:47] Sky the zoic the
[31:49] Stars the it started off and runs off in
[31:52] every
[31:54] age that's the future home of the
[31:56] Heavenly bridegroom so here we're seeing
[31:58] that God's talking to us in the stars
[32:01] and in the skies in every age amen let's
[32:04] just this just this the lay of
[32:05] foundation just let me slow down and
[32:07] read this notice on this that Christ God
[32:10] wrote three Bibles and the first Bible
[32:13] was wrote in
[32:14] thegu here's another paragraph says
[32:16] always yes sir God provides it and if
[32:19] you'll just watch nature and there's the
[32:22] first Bible watching nature and if
[32:24] you'll notice and you'll never miss it
[32:26] Miss God if you'll just watch nature
[32:31] next quote but let me tell you that
[32:33] there was the first Bible I'm choking to
[32:36] death and that was ever written and it
[32:38] was in the skies and the next quote and
[32:42] the first Bible was written in the skies
[32:45] and Men looked up knowing god was above
[32:50] the next quote he said my first Bible
[32:51] was nature and I learned God through
[32:54] nature that's demonology and we're just
[32:56] we're just finishing this here and God
[32:58] wrote three Bibles one was the zoic one
[33:01] was the pyramids and one was on paper I
[33:03] remember your dad preaching that brother
[33:05] mine it's just as clear as day and and
[33:07] he preached on the pyramids CU he had
[33:09] been there and just like it was
[33:10] yesterday amen I thought of that when I
[33:12] was studying it and let's just look into
[33:14] this next quote here where we looked at
[33:16] and brother Brown says this eight times
[33:18] he said it more times if you if when you
[33:21] search the message if you put less words
[33:23] in you'll get a lot higher number but I
[33:25] want a specific thought before God does
[33:29] anything brother man mentions that eight
[33:33] times and when I was looking for this I
[33:36] was not looking for what I'm going to
[33:38] preach
[33:39] on but two of the eight times he
[33:41] mentions it brother Brown mentions his
[33:43] commission and I'm going to use that
[33:45] commission to lay a foundation and and
[33:49] uh before we actually get to our final
[33:52] thought if God permits us today or next
[33:55] time here just mentioning the short
[33:58] quotes real quick here and the angel
[34:00] came to my commission he
[34:09] said she said now you know before God
[34:11] does anything in the earth he always
[34:13] declares it in the heaven and then on
[34:17] Earth he said the next one he said they
[34:19] watch the Stars before God does anything
[34:22] on Earth and he shows a sign in the
[34:25] heaven before he does it on Earth
[34:28] before he sends judgment before he sends
[34:32] he sent an angel and give a me gives a
[34:35] message and he did that in the days of
[34:37] Noah and here he is in this days before
[34:40] Jesus and I believe he's here now before
[34:43] the second coming now we're getting to
[34:46] where we want to go do you believe him
[34:49] my friends let's go to the next one
[34:50] where he's King of the Jews and these
[34:52] men they waited on one true God and they
[34:55] worship him in the light in this the
[34:57] sacred fire and they would get around
[35:00] these fires and wait on God and many of
[35:02] them had observations and something like
[35:05] that here today and they would go to
[35:07] these places way up in the mountains and
[35:09] they would watch every move of the stars
[35:12] and they claimed that before God does
[35:14] anything on Earth he always shows it in
[35:16] the heavens first and they
[35:20] right that's what your Prophet
[35:22] said always God shows it in the heavens
[35:26] first now if he's a same yesterday today
[35:28] and forever is it
[35:31] possible is it
[35:33] possible he always shows the signs in
[35:36] heaven first since then he
[35:38] did since then then did he ever do
[35:42] anything that he didn't show in the
[35:43] heaven sign first I think of it in every
[35:47] age you wish to God always show does
[35:50] show signs in the heavens first before
[35:53] he does anything on
[35:54] Earth comes from a supernatural drops
[35:58] into nature and it's made manifested in
[36:01] watch this now there's key words here
[36:03] there's here for a reason in every age
[36:06] even though you don't believe it's going
[36:07] to happen in our time in every age and
[36:10] in every time and so this
[36:13] time is no different uhoh wait a minute
[36:18] now oh no you know we're living in a
[36:20] technical age and you know we have a
[36:22] message and you know we're you know uh
[36:25] we're just going to go on and yes we are
[36:27] and and and I know brother BR said plant
[36:30] your potatoes and I'm planting them
[36:32] thinking I won't Harvest them and and uh
[36:35] here here let let me just finish
[36:38] this and before God does anything on
[36:40] Earth I'm still reading these eight
[36:42] quotes he declares it in the heavens
[36:44] that's a revelation God give to
[36:48] me before God does anything usually on
[36:52] Earth he usually speaks it out in the
[36:53] heavens first did you ever notice that
[36:56] he always speaks in the heavens first
[36:58] and The Supernaturals always manifests
[37:00] itself and then it comes down and to the
[37:04] people so we laid a good foundation here
[37:07] to
[37:09] say that if God's ever going to do
[37:11] something great again and take a bride
[37:13] home in a
[37:15] Rapture the foolish virgin will never be
[37:17] able to say I didn't
[37:19] know first off that can't happen until
[37:23] this word's been preached in all the
[37:25] world but but even God even though God
[37:27] called the five-fold ministry which he
[37:29] trusts 100% the true five-fold
[37:32] Ministry God never even left it totally
[37:35] to them because he would even show it in
[37:39] nature and show it in the heavens now of
[37:41] course we know the most important things
[37:42] the word of God and God will always have
[37:44] a true Minister on Earth I'm not taking
[37:47] away from that one Speck amen but we see
[37:50] here that the time is at hands and you
[37:53] know we look at you know we mentioned
[37:54] about Israel it's been 76 years since is
[37:57] Israel became a nation and that
[37:59] generation won't pass away and the Bible
[38:03] says that the the the our promise is
[38:07] three score and 10 in Psalms
[38:12] 910 now you know I you know when I study
[38:15] I I find stuff I'm not even looking for
[38:17] Jared this will give you great hope I
[38:19] there for a while I thought Jared was
[38:20] the oldest man that lived in the Bible
[38:22] but sorry you're second but that's still
[38:24] pretty good you got 962 years so if you
[38:27] live just 10% of that you'll be 96 and a
[38:30] half so you know you really want to lay
[38:32] a foundation for all that's coming up
[38:35] your way but we see that even what the
[38:38] bible promises us that in this
[38:41] generation won't pass away 76
[38:44] years and we know that Sodom has
[38:47] arrived everybody everybody agree with
[38:50] it sodom's arrived okay so now now we
[38:53] still don't know the day but let's read
[38:55] this scripture so we we get a strong
[38:57] Foundation pthew 24 here in 32 and 35
[39:00] now learn the Fig Tree of the par the
[39:02] learn the parable of the Fig Tree when
[39:05] it's branches are yet tender and put it
[39:07] forth its leaves now you know the summer
[39:09] is nigh and so likewise ye when you
[39:11] shall see all these things know that it
[39:14] is near now you know I got in trouble
[39:17] before for other people thinking that I
[39:18] was preaching the raptures near now this
[39:20] is in Matthew
[39:22] 24 I mean they thought it in Matthew 24
[39:25] the Rapture was near for goodness sake
[39:28] if you don't think brother Dell should
[39:29] say it's near what would I preach
[39:34] on
[39:35] woo Hallelujah even even at the doors in
[39:41] verse 34 and verily I say unto you that
[39:44] this generation shall not
[39:46] pass till all these things be fulfilled
[39:48] and Heaven and Earth shall pass away but
[39:51] my word shall
[39:52] not pass
[39:54] away Hallelujah let's just look at
[39:58] you know I want to read just one thing
[39:59] before yeah we're done with the
[40:01] scripture I want want to read a a quote
[40:03] here um before we get into brother
[40:06] braham's commission you know brother
[40:08] Braham said we're living in a unique
[40:10] age and our message is different than
[40:13] it's ever been
[40:15] before because we have the full word of
[40:18] God and our message is not like any
[40:21] other
[40:23] religion because we have the
[40:25] truth we have Christ himself we don't
[40:29] just have a church name we just don't
[40:31] have a Minister's name we have Jehovah
[40:34] amen and so he said this age is
[40:36] different than it's ever been before and
[40:38] he said when a man's filled with the
[40:39] Holy Ghost and he talks about his
[40:41] spiritual vitamins think spiritual with
[40:43] me for for a minute now he said in every
[40:46] other age he said it was there was
[40:48] always a
[40:50] power and he said but the spirit the
[40:52] Holy Spirit has more power and it will
[40:55] lift You Higher and we can go higher and
[40:58] see more and believe more than ever
[41:02] before like Christ see this age is
[41:05] different and brother Brown even brother
[41:07] Brown's message was progressive
[41:08] revelation until God took him home and
[41:11] brother Brown was you know brother Brown
[41:12] was showing up or God was sorry was
[41:14] showing brother Brown more and more and
[41:16] more and more and and brother Brown and
[41:17] we're going to read it in the quote here
[41:18] when the seals were open he said the
[41:20] Bible's a brand new book to
[41:22] me because he was seeing Jesus become
[41:25] more clear and the veil was becoming
[41:28] thinner and and disappearing in front of
[41:30] them but he said and other ages they
[41:33] were powered
[41:35] by automo Automobiles and horse and
[41:38] buggy and even
[41:40] airplanes but he said we're living in an
[41:42] astronaut age and he said it's called
[41:45] The Eagle age and in the Bible God calls
[41:47] the eagle age His prophets and we
[41:49] recognize in the Bible that we'll find
[41:51] in Malachi 4 that he promises in our day
[41:56] don't see you might not want to believe
[41:58] the me uh like how could you believe
[42:00] that the Rapture ain't now or that we're
[42:03] not in the last day but you believe the
[42:05] message but the message ain't coming
[42:07] till the last
[42:08] day I always like reverse math to see if
[42:11] I'm right now the the Bible says that
[42:14] this this this wonderful message that
[42:16] you believe we only get it at the end
[42:19] but we don't believe the ends
[42:22] here well you believe another message is
[42:24] going to come no you don't believe that
[42:26] it ain't going to come I'll tell you
[42:28] what there's nothing that's better than
[42:29] than Christ himself and so he said uh
[42:32] we're in an astronut age and he said so
[42:34] we're the eagle age and he said we
[42:36] recognize
[42:37] sorry and he Likens His prophets to
[42:40] Eagles but he's the great Jehovah eagle
[42:44] and he's able to achieve this he's able
[42:47] to achieve this to himself in a
[42:51] bride wow he makes this so personal it's
[42:54] just beautiful and he's going to in this
[42:56] last day be able to get a bride and with
[42:59] the ministry that's exactly so like a
[43:02] man and wife become one Jehovah gets his
[43:05] bride to him and lives with his bride as
[43:11] wife amen this is in uh the countdown in
[43:14] 64 he's talking about this but watch
[43:16] this and he said you believe on me the
[43:19] works that I do shall you do also and
[43:21] this also but as in the last
[43:24] days but it shall also be fulfilled Phil
[43:27] Jesus said that it would take place that
[43:28] as in the days of Sodom so shall be the
[43:31] coming of the son of man and but we're
[43:34] living in an astronaut age and he said
[43:37] you see the horse rider in the
[43:38] automobile and the airplanes T that he
[43:40] said we go higher than them but they all
[43:43] had a source of power but you have a
[43:47] source of power too he said see all
[43:49] these ages even the airplanes will get
[43:51] caught up in the clouds and they'll hear
[43:53] the air pockets and you know you'll be
[43:55] in an airplane it'll drop and and all
[43:57] these things and they're affected by
[43:59] denomination and Creeds and thoughts of
[44:01] men but we move above that we move into
[44:04] the Heavenly where Jehovah himself's
[44:06] there and he said so we have to have
[44:09] something that's powering us
[44:12] too Hallelujah and he said when we're in
[44:15] that age he said we've get the
[44:17] achievement of the promise in the last
[44:19] age according to Mal Mali 4 and he said
[44:22] it's only
[44:26] him he's talking about the airplanes and
[44:28] the automobiles all wrecking up he watch
[44:30] how he says this too he saidou know the
[44:32] planes are all wrecking up and fussing
[44:34] in the clouds and deciding what kind of
[44:37] clothes they should wear and all this
[44:38] stuff and Creeds and that of
[44:41] men but he said he's keeping us moving
[44:45] until we go beyond any
[44:48] reasoning any reason he said God
[44:51] actually not goes beyond any Tre Creeds
[44:53] or boundaries or thoughts of men and the
[44:55] and Beyond you know people people saying
[44:57] that God's not the same yesterday today
[44:59] and forever amen search the scriptures
[45:02] for in them you shall find eternal life
[45:05] for they testify but watch this he said
[45:07] the ministry what does it do the
[45:09] astronaut sees the planes and everything
[45:11] to date and so does the spiritual
[45:13] astronaut it goes beyond the clouds of
[45:15] the
[45:18] Creeds and the chatter that everybody
[45:21] watch this he said well you what watch
[45:23] this is how Satan deals and we're going
[45:25] to get into this sumon brother braham's
[45:26] Commission and he said watch watch how
[45:28] Satan's telling somebody that wants to
[45:31] be an astronaut so well you can't do
[45:34] that nobody will cooperate with
[45:37] you this a direct quote I'm reading it
[45:40] he said you can't do this he said you
[45:42] can't do that but did you ever notice
[45:45] that he is an astronaut and he goes
[45:47] beyond all those
[45:50] disbelief amen and the astronaut he he
[45:54] said so here I'm I'm closing this this
[45:57] this thought here he says the airplanes
[45:58] and that they're all controlled by a
[46:02] radar but he said you're controlled by a
[46:04] radar too amen that's the baptism of the
[46:08] Holy Ghost amen and that's the anchor
[46:11] holes and that's thus sayith the Lord
[46:14] amen oh it's it's beautiful
[46:17] church when you come under thus sayith
[46:19] the Lord the control towers and God will
[46:22] achieve just exactly what he wants when
[46:24] you go
[46:25] into
[46:27] the heavenlies amen into the astronaut
[46:29] so we look into brother baham and and
[46:32] I'm going to slow down on this because I
[46:33] want to lay this down and then we're
[46:36] going to get into what God's doing today
[46:38] but I want to show you the struggle that
[46:40] brother Braham had and I want to mention
[46:42] something that I mentioned before I
[46:44] mentioned it last week and I've
[46:46] mentioned it many times and it's it's
[46:48] it's Bible and its message but it's not
[46:51] message everywhere the message is
[46:54] different in different places because of
[46:56] people
[46:57] people
[47:01] Amen brother
[47:03] brandham was being it's how he says it
[47:08] he he didn't understand his
[47:10] ministry and he was being plagued I'm
[47:12] I'm just going to paraphrase this this
[47:13] is in a 60210 morning message it's a
[47:16] revelation that was given to me and I
[47:19] ran into this when I was searching
[47:21] before God does anything and out of the
[47:23] eight quotes he mentions this two times
[47:25] and he's talking about before God does
[47:27] anything and he shows his thing and this
[47:29] is this is worth saying we need to
[47:32] understand this perfectly it'll help us
[47:35] he said You know here he had he had got
[47:38] converted and he joined the Baptist
[47:40] Church and he' started preaching and had
[47:42] a Revival and you know the story so I
[47:45] can just go fast in the beginning but
[47:47] when he was baptizing on the uh the
[47:50] river you know the voice came over him
[47:53] and before this time brother Brown was
[47:55] having a lot of visions
[47:57] and it scared him it scared him to death
[48:00] he didn't understand it and he says here
[48:02] right here and these are open for anyone
[48:05] to see this I you can have my papers or
[48:08] or find it yourself he said the girl
[48:10] that I married later she said she took
[48:11] the picture of the pillar of Fire or the
[48:14] dove that came down on
[48:16] him and he said he was afraid and you
[48:18] know it mentions here he says as John
[48:21] the Baptist forun the first coming to
[48:23] Christ message you will forerun the
[48:25] second coming of Christ
[48:27] now I want to ask you a question just to
[48:30] lay a foundation now if brother bram's
[48:32] message was going to forerun the second
[48:34] coming of
[48:36] Christ it kind of Don't It Make logic
[48:39] sense that it would be in that
[48:41] generation or very close to that
[48:43] generation cuz like if it was 500 years
[48:46] down the road he could have picked
[48:47] another brother
[48:49] Brandon you see what I
[48:53] mean that's also a Vindication of where
[48:56] we're at TimeWise amen it's good to
[48:59] recognize where we're at and he said
[49:01] this this uh light appeared on you know
[49:04] we know the pillar fire and it was in
[49:06] all the newspapers and all this stuff
[49:08] and he said when these Visions came he
[49:10] said I guess I would see thousands of
[49:14] them he
[49:16] said I was afraid to tell
[49:19] people brother this is right in the
[49:21] beginning when God's starting to deal
[49:22] with our prophet he said I was afraid to
[49:25] tell people and here he said he said 'I
[49:27] want to say something first he said here
[49:30] when the uh how many here are
[49:33] Spirit-filled and he asked you to raise
[49:35] your hand and he said now I'll tell you
[49:37] that you'll understand surely this is a
[49:39] strange thing to say about this and and
[49:41] I I really want to slow down to to catch
[49:43] what the prophet's trying to say here
[49:46] but he went to a
[49:49] carnival he went to a carnival and there
[49:52] was a young lady
[49:54] there in a tent and she was a fortunate
[49:56] tell her she read your palms and she
[49:59] said my mom I'm just paraphrasing but
[50:02] it's right here in front of me he said
[50:03] my mom always told me that for tellers
[50:06] were were spiritualists and they were of
[50:08] the devil and she's right so he agrees
[50:12] with this mom and this little fortune
[50:14] teller lady was 16 or 17 17 or 18 years
[50:17] old should you say there about and I
[50:19] walked over to her and she said did you
[50:22] know that you're born under a
[50:24] sign and it scared me and I said I don't
[50:28] want nothing to do with that and walked
[50:30] away now we're going somewhere with this
[50:32] this is this is not just reading a quote
[50:35] and he later became the game warden and
[50:39] uh you know and he said and he mentions
[50:41] this exactly this part exactly twice and
[50:44] when the angel came to him in his
[50:46] commission he said one day I was going
[50:48] on the bus and he said there was a great
[50:51] crowd and I had to stand up and I felt a
[50:54] strange feeling and I was always s
[50:56] sensitive to spirits and especially when
[50:58] I would meet one of
[51:00] those
[51:02] people meaning a fortune
[51:06] teller and I would feel real funny and I
[51:09] began to feel that and I looked around
[51:11] and there was a strong woman looking at
[51:12] me and she said I'd like to speak to you
[51:15] now brother Brown was a shy person am
[51:17] man there's nothing wrong with being shy
[51:20] and one
[51:25] day and I'm just skipping a paragraph
[51:28] here he talks about woman he said and he
[51:31] said I was taking off my gun
[51:34] belt got oh
[51:37] sorry one day when I started to take my
[51:40] own life the gun oh the gun one oh God
[51:43] was taking care of his gift sorry
[51:44] forgive
[51:46] me just like when God was taking care of
[51:49] Moses when Moses tried to run away from
[51:51] it and so the back to the woman he said
[51:53] so this woman I said what would you want
[51:57] and she said sir did you know that
[51:59] you're born under a sign and quickly it
[52:01] scared me and I said I don't want
[52:02] nothing to do about this I don't want
[52:04] nothing to know nothing about it and she
[52:07] said haven't you never talked to
[52:11] preachers I say let's read that sign
[52:14] again haven't you never talked to any
[52:18] preachers brother Brown's going to say
[52:20] something really going to knock your
[52:22] socks off here I said I have no use for
[52:25] them that's not it he said I don't go
[52:28] around any anywhere any of that that
[52:31] stuff he said I don't want to hurt your
[52:34] feelings but I don't want to hear
[52:37] anything that you have to say now he's
[52:39] talking about the uh fortune teller
[52:43] person and she said sir that's not a
[52:47] gentleman and I turned to her again
[52:49] brother Brown saying and I said how did
[52:52] you know
[52:53] that and she said brother bram's asking
[52:57] how do you know I was born under a sign
[52:58] she said well when you came on the
[53:01] bus I seen
[53:04] it now she's a
[53:07] devil I'll just jump ahead to brother
[53:09] Brown brother Brown said all the
[53:10] religious people in his
[53:12] life thought he was the devil and all
[53:16] the devils in his life knew he was
[53:20] God do you know when we started our
[53:23] church I got letters from believers
[53:26] mailed to me that said you were the
[53:29] achievement of the
[53:31] devil I have them in my death
[53:34] store I have them in my death
[53:38] store now now now and I'm not bringing
[53:41] myself to brother brown but I just want
[53:42] you to see brother Brown plainly says
[53:45] what I just told you here so all the
[53:46] minister in his life said he had a devil
[53:49] but the Devil Himself recognize
[53:53] God Amen wow
[53:57] and so she turned and she went when I
[54:00] got when he got on the bus she said uh I
[54:03] work at the White House she said and I'm
[54:05] on my way to Chicago to my son who's a
[54:08] minister she said and I'm an astronomer
[54:12] now you see you wonder where I'm reading
[54:13] this quote it's because we're talking
[54:14] about the heavenlies okay I'm I'm really
[54:18] I'm really having lost my mind we're
[54:19] going somewhere with this and she said
[54:21] did you know who when God does anything
[54:23] first thing he does he declares it in
[54:25] the heavens
[54:27] now this is part of brother Brown's
[54:29] commission but we have another thing
[54:31] that's going to happen in our life
[54:33] that's a
[54:34] Rapture and before he declares it he
[54:36] declares it before he declares it on
[54:38] Earth and I said I don't know nothing
[54:41] about this and I turned around again and
[54:44] it kindly made me feel bad because there
[54:46] were so many people on the bus and and
[54:49] it and it it and me being the officer
[54:51] because see now he was dressed in his
[54:53] game warden uh uniform and it and you
[54:57] know he here he's almost being rude and
[54:59] so I thought that it was a gentleman
[55:00] like so she called me and kept calling
[55:03] me and I turned around again I said what
[55:05] do you got to do with
[55:09] me now now now let me just say this
[55:12] again brother Bram didn't understand
[55:13] none of this but but by us trying to
[55:16] understand it it'll help
[55:20] us and she said this this this fortune
[55:23] teller she said when Jesus Christ was
[55:25] born
[55:27] he was
[55:28] born and man came from the East he was
[55:30] born under a
[55:32] sign and that was a wise man I said I
[55:35] have no idea about
[55:37] that and she said well there was
[55:39] astronomers when Jesus was born that
[55:42] watched the heavens now this is the
[55:44] devil talking to brother Brown you
[55:46] understand where we going this ain't the
[55:51] ministers wow and before God does
[55:54] anything on Earth he declares that in
[55:55] the heavens
[55:56] and she said I I said but I don't know
[55:59] nothing about it and she said but when
[56:01] God gives a gift he declares it in
[56:04] heaven and I said but I still don't know
[56:06] nothing about it and she said you were
[56:08] born under a sign and she said if I tell
[56:10] you when you were born do you believe
[56:13] it now we don't think God can do things
[56:16] in our life you know you know the Bible
[56:18] says what is it in Hebrews 11 or
[56:20] something it talks about all the works
[56:22] that the mighty man of God did and that
[56:24] was before the Holy Ghost was given you
[56:27] know the only reason if you don't feel
[56:29] like you have something moving in your
[56:32] life it's because you don't have faith
[56:34] you don't
[56:35] believe because God's doing more than
[56:38] you can even comprehend if you just if
[56:41] you just take the scales off your eyes
[56:42] and look he's everywhere he's he's
[56:47] everywhere amen
[56:51] hallelujah and I said lady you can't
[56:55] read my mind and I don't believe you can
[56:57] do
[56:58] it and she said you were born on April
[57:01] 6th 1909 at 5:00 a.m. in the morning and
[57:03] she said that's when a certain star said
[57:07] Cross or something like that in the
[57:10] atmosphere
[57:12] wow now don't you think if Satan could
[57:15] do that well of course God
[57:20] Amen we we we got to stop insulting our
[57:23] heavenly father amen amen it's not our
[57:27] power but he's ultimate power amen this
[57:31] is beautiful here so she tells her
[57:33] exactly and I said I don't know nothing
[57:35] about it and I could care less this is
[57:37] Brother BR so she said well you may pass
[57:41] it by but said if you would respect it
[57:44] it would shake the world and I said tell
[57:48] this young sailor here he's talking
[57:50] about the person when he was born and
[57:54] she Saidi can't do that I said so then I
[57:57] was almost to my place where I was going
[57:59] to get off the bus and my ignation all
[58:03] came
[58:04] up and my face was all red and I was
[58:07] shaking and I was scared and I was glad
[58:10] to get off the bus see what I'm trying
[58:13] to show you is brother brandham didn't
[58:15] understand how God moved and sometimes
[58:19] in our natural being I'm not saying that
[58:21] we're ignorant but I mean in our natural
[58:23] being you think you got a associat in
[58:26] the in the the you know in your
[58:29] surroundings in the ranks of the message
[58:32] and that and and and we do and there and
[58:34] there's good ones you're sitting here
[58:35] this morning and and I'm not trying to
[58:37] say we're the only ones because that's
[58:39] that's a million miles from the truth
[58:40] but there's ones also sitting
[58:43] there amen and and brother B clearly
[58:46] says this and so we have to be we just
[58:49] have to understand that because it will
[58:52] be a Warfare for us and we'll think that
[58:54] we're the wrong ones
[59:00] amen and so later on I became a minister
[59:03] brother Bram says I became a minister
[59:05] and all these Visions they kept coming
[59:07] many times and then my Baptist Brethren
[59:11] this is where we going you got to catch
[59:13] this my Baptist Brethren they told me
[59:16] when you meet in this conference this
[59:18] Baptist conference like this we'll
[59:21] explain it I'll explain it to them and
[59:24] they said to me Billy
[59:26] don't listen to this move of God don't
[59:29] listen to this in your life
[59:32] that's of the
[59:35] devil now I I'm going to and if this
[59:38] offends you I hope this don't offend you
[59:39] but I had the exact same thing tell to
[59:41] me when we started the
[59:45] church and there was one person in
[59:47] brother Brown's life that supported his
[59:49] ministry one
[59:50] person and that was his
[59:53] wife and do you know if brother brandom
[59:56] would have listened to his wife it would
[59:57] have been easier on
[59:59] God and I mentioned this last last week
[1:00:02] and I'm going to read you the exact
[1:00:03] quote do you know brother bram's wife
[1:00:06] said Don't listen to the
[1:00:10] ministers and because brother brandham
[1:00:13] never listened to the spiritual counsel
[1:00:16] of his wife God literally had to send a
[1:00:20] body angel in the room with
[1:00:24] them
[1:00:26] I know you're struggling to believe that
[1:00:28] but I'm going to read it for
[1:00:30] you he said ' that's of the devil and
[1:00:32] the devil's trying to get at you and oh
[1:00:34] my that would just make me shake and it
[1:00:36] scared me and I didn't want nothing to
[1:00:38] do with that devil we're almost aw I'm
[1:00:40] going to read the other quote and he
[1:00:42] said so I came home and I was Tak he was
[1:00:45] at work and he said I came home from
[1:00:47] work and I was around the house and we
[1:00:49] had just a small house and I was taking
[1:00:51] off my gun belt and I was getting ready
[1:00:52] for lunch and I was going back to turned
[1:00:56] some fish loose in the conservation and
[1:00:58] my wife had dinner ready and there was a
[1:01:00] brother of the brother that played the
[1:01:02] piano in the church that wanted brother
[1:01:04] Bram to go somewhere with them and and
[1:01:07] uh I went around the house and suddenly
[1:01:10] here it came again see brother Brown had
[1:01:13] been listening to the
[1:01:18] preachers and and I'm not knocking pre
[1:01:21] I'm just I'm just saying I'm just trying
[1:01:23] to just get to understand how God moves
[1:01:26] and here I came again and I was with my
[1:01:28] wife and and she he he says in this
[1:01:31] other one he saysi almost
[1:01:32] fainted and the brother ran up to grab
[1:01:35] me and his wife brought a picture of
[1:01:37] water to throw in his
[1:01:39] face this was real this you getting the
[1:01:43] picture and he said I told my wife I
[1:01:46] said go in and call the office and tell
[1:01:48] them that I won't be working this
[1:01:49] afternoon and I don't know when I'll be
[1:01:51] back to work I said honey I can't go
[1:01:54] through the this I'm a sleep
[1:01:57] and he said if them Brethren are right
[1:01:58] meaning the ministers if they're right
[1:02:01] and those Brethren are right those
[1:02:03] ministers the devil's trying to take my
[1:02:05] life and I'm a minister a pastor now in
[1:02:07] the Tabernacle and when the devil's
[1:02:10] after me I got to get rid of it and so
[1:02:13] I'm never
[1:02:15] preaching
[1:02:19] again amen let's just stop there and I
[1:02:22] want to read just a short one on the
[1:02:24] other quote in this Commission now now I
[1:02:27] I hope you all understand how God moves
[1:02:28] I wasn't even looking for this I haven't
[1:02:31] even got to my message I'm going to
[1:02:32] preach on the heavens but when I was
[1:02:35] looking for Heavenly quotes God showed
[1:02:37] me
[1:02:40] this this is in how the angel came to me
[1:02:44] and his commission this other one is the
[1:02:47] revelations and so I was seeing the
[1:02:50] movement of V visions and this is just a
[1:02:52] couple paragraphs but I want you to
[1:02:53] catch how God was working through
[1:02:56] brother Brown's
[1:02:57] wife cuz I mean it's hard to believe me
[1:03:00] even though I'm telling you the truth he
[1:03:02] said and all these things would happen
[1:03:04] and when a little bit later on he said
[1:03:06] it kept bothering me and so much that
[1:03:08] nobody was telling me everybody was
[1:03:10] telling me it was
[1:03:12] wrong and I took off my old stom I went
[1:03:16] off to my old stomping grounds sorry
[1:03:21] yep up here to pray through for a matter
[1:03:24] praying that he'd come
[1:03:26] and it was and I was the game War in
[1:03:28] Indiana and there was a brother of the
[1:03:30] pianoist I I I just I've studied this so
[1:03:33] much I saying it by memory and he wanted
[1:03:35] them to go with them that afternoon and
[1:03:38] he said I can't go I got to go up to the
[1:03:40] forestry and so I was coming around my
[1:03:42] house and I was taking off my gun belt
[1:03:44] and things this a different quote but
[1:03:46] it's the same and I was rolling up my
[1:03:48] sleeves and we lived in a little two
[1:03:49] room house and I was going to wash and I
[1:03:52] was ready for my meal and I was washing
[1:03:54] I was just walking around the side of
[1:03:55] the house and under the baked maple tree
[1:03:57] and something went
[1:03:58] swoosh and just almost would passed out
[1:04:02] and I looked and I know it was that
[1:04:04] thing again and I stepped I stepped on
[1:04:08] those steps and he jumped out of the car
[1:04:10] that this other brother jumped out of
[1:04:11] the car and he said he said he ran away
[1:04:13] he said Billy are you're
[1:04:15] fainting now when you start fainting
[1:04:17] it's it's something more than just made
[1:04:20] up he said and I said no sir and he said
[1:04:22] well what's the matter Billy and I said
[1:04:24] I don't know I said I just go ahead
[1:04:26] brother he said I can't go with you just
[1:04:29] go ahead and he said that's all right
[1:04:30] thank you and he said my wife came out
[1:04:32] and brought a picture of water and said
[1:04:33] honey what's the
[1:04:36] matter I said nothing sweetheart and so
[1:04:39] she said she said come on in dinner's
[1:04:41] ready and she put her arm around me and
[1:04:43] tried to bring me in I said honey I'm
[1:04:45] going to tell you
[1:04:51] something you call them tell them I
[1:04:54] won't be in this afternoon and I said
[1:04:56] media Medi medy mey sweetheart I said I
[1:05:02] know my heart that I love Jesus
[1:05:04] Christ and I know that it passed from
[1:05:06] Death unto life but I don't want this
[1:05:09] devil that would have anything to do
[1:05:11] with me and I said I can't go on like
[1:05:13] this I'm a prisoner and I said all this
[1:05:15] time it kept happening and things in the
[1:05:17] visions and whatever and I said I don't
[1:05:21] know what these Visions are and I don't
[1:05:24] I didn't call it a vision I said I
[1:05:26] called them a
[1:05:28] trance and he said I don't know what
[1:05:30] this is honey and he mentions you know
[1:05:32] brother braham's English he he mentions
[1:05:34] I four times he said I don't want to be
[1:05:37] fooling with this and he said they watch
[1:05:40] this and they tell
[1:05:43] me I had some they in my
[1:05:46] life and they tell me it's the
[1:05:53] devil and I love the Lord Jesus and and
[1:05:55] here is paragraph 141 and this is in how
[1:05:59] the angel came and told me my commission
[1:06:01] and she said media said oh she said
[1:06:04] Billy you ought and listened to what
[1:06:08] those
[1:06:09] people tell
[1:06:14] you God speaking through his
[1:06:18] wife and because he wouldn't listen to
[1:06:21] his wife he had to put together a being
[1:06:24] an angel
[1:06:26] a man to talk to brother
[1:06:29] brown
[1:06:31] man but I said honey paragraph 142 and I
[1:06:35] said but honey look at those other
[1:06:38] preachers I said I don't want it I said
[1:06:41] I'm going to my place in the woods and I
[1:06:44] got this is hilarious this this will
[1:06:47] really make you chuckle he said I got
[1:06:50] $15 and that'll take care of you and
[1:06:53] Little Billy for quite a while
[1:07:00] that was a different world and you got
[1:07:04] enough money it'll take care of you and
[1:07:05] Billy to live on for quite a while and
[1:07:07] you call them up and tell them that I'll
[1:07:09] maybe be in tomorrow or I may never be
[1:07:12] back but if I don't come back in the
[1:07:15] next 5 days tell them to hire somebody
[1:07:17] else in my
[1:07:19] place and I said media I'll never come
[1:07:23] back out of that Woods until God
[1:07:24] promises
[1:07:26] not to speak to me and give me these
[1:07:28] transes ever
[1:07:35] again
[1:07:37] amen so can God speak through your
[1:07:40] wife if she's got the Holy Ghost it can
[1:07:44] be directly from the Throne of
[1:07:47] God Amen let's look in Luke before we
[1:07:50] get into our our thought here Luke 21:25
[1:07:54] and 27 and there's shall be signs in the
[1:07:56] heavens and the moons and the stars and
[1:07:59] upon the Earth and distress and Nations
[1:08:01] and Perle and the Seas and waves and
[1:08:03] roaring and man's heart shall be failing
[1:08:05] for fear and for looking after those
[1:08:07] things which are coming upon the earth
[1:08:09] and the powers in heaven shall be shaken
[1:08:12] and verse 27 and then shall they see the
[1:08:15] son of man
[1:08:16] coming with power and great Glory
[1:08:21] Hallelujah we we see that God is going
[1:08:24] to speak Even in our
[1:08:26] day through the
[1:08:28] heavenlies man I just want to if you'll
[1:08:30] let me go back to the other quote and
[1:08:33] and and just forgive me for a bit I'd
[1:08:34] like to finish this where we were back
[1:08:37] to the other quote I just I just went to
[1:08:39] the other quote because brother Brown
[1:08:42] hadn't mentioned what his wife had said
[1:08:45] in the other
[1:08:46] message and so he went to the little
[1:08:49] cabin and and he said I prayed till 2:00
[1:08:51] in the morning and he sat down and he
[1:08:53] said I was crying and and and he said
[1:08:55] the Lord let me let I said Lord don't
[1:08:58] let this ever happen to me again he's
[1:09:00] he's wanting God to take the gift off
[1:09:02] his life and he said Lord I love you and
[1:09:05] you're my savior and he said let no evil
[1:09:08] can
[1:09:09] take uh this over he said help me Lord
[1:09:14] he here he's praying and asking God to
[1:09:17] to get rid of what God give him he said
[1:09:18] I want to have nothing to do with the
[1:09:20] devil and I love you Jesus and I want to
[1:09:22] serve you and he said just then a light
[1:09:25] came on on the floor and he said I
[1:09:27] looked at the light and he said it began
[1:09:29] to spread out and I looked up above and
[1:09:31] here was a light this light was Milling
[1:09:33] around and he said it was kind of
[1:09:35] yellowish green and Amber and oh I pray
[1:09:37] to God I'll live to see that amen and
[1:09:40] with my natural eyes and the light was
[1:09:42] growing wider and wider and I heard some
[1:09:44] walk I heard some walking someone
[1:09:46] walking and they come walking up to the
[1:09:49] side of me right like my side came
[1:09:52] walking like a man and he had a white
[1:09:54] garment on and bare feet and kind of a
[1:09:56] dark complex hair coming down and he was
[1:09:59] a huge man that makes me feel a little
[1:10:02] better with great big arms and folded
[1:10:04] like this and he started walking to me
[1:10:06] and I was so scared I was biting my
[1:10:09] fingernails in my
[1:10:11] fingers and I thought I'd went to
[1:10:15] sleep you recognize why God had to send
[1:10:17] him an
[1:10:18] angel cuz you didn't listen to a holy
[1:10:21] ghost filled
[1:10:22] wife amen ver paragraph 14 I I I'm
[1:10:26] trying to hurry it's bear with me I'm
[1:10:28] sorry and now he said you might think
[1:10:31] that you would this would make you laugh
[1:10:33] but he said if you know you know I I
[1:10:35] think of this when people want to see
[1:10:37] the move of God you know if you're in
[1:10:38] the move of God and you're not in the
[1:10:39] right Spirit you'd be scared to death he
[1:10:41] said You' think this might make you
[1:10:43] laugh than that but he said if you stand
[1:10:45] there one place you'll feel the same way
[1:10:47] he said that was no vision he's talking
[1:10:50] about the angel the man he said surely I
[1:10:53] know it wasn't a vision he said it was
[1:10:55] no vision that was a man that was there
[1:10:57] and he said he was just the same as I am
[1:10:59] here right now and he was looking at me
[1:11:02] and he said he was getting he he kept
[1:11:04] getting back a hold of my chair and I
[1:11:07] was looking back and he looked around
[1:11:09] right down at me and he said don't
[1:11:12] fear and I said as soon as he said that
[1:11:14] I knew that it was the same voice that
[1:11:17] had spoken to me as a little
[1:11:20] boy and he said I I had never seen him
[1:11:24] before but I recognized his voice and it
[1:11:27] was a deep and he said Don't Fear again
[1:11:31] he said I've been sent from God to tell
[1:11:34] you your peculiar birth and
[1:11:37] life and he said now no one understood
[1:11:40] me he said my ministering Brothers I
[1:11:43] needed to finish this please under
[1:11:45] forgive me he said my ministering
[1:11:47] Brothers didn't understand me my father
[1:11:49] didn't understand me my mother didn't
[1:11:51] understand me and I never understood
[1:11:54] myself
[1:11:58] he said ' I didn't want to be different
[1:12:00] I don't want I wanted to be like someone
[1:12:03] else but you can only do what God makes
[1:12:06] you and he's the Potter and we're the
[1:12:09] clay and he said so I listened to him
[1:12:12] and he said now this was all indicated
[1:12:16] that you were born and to pray for for
[1:12:19] sick people and I said well I don't know
[1:12:21] nothing about praying for sick people
[1:12:23] I'm just a local Baptist minister sir
[1:12:25] and I looked at him again and he seemed
[1:12:27] very kind and seemed like the fear began
[1:12:30] to leave me and I said sir I'm
[1:12:33] uneducated and I could not do such a
[1:12:35] thing this sounds like Moses I could not
[1:12:38] do such a thing as you have ask and you
[1:12:42] have told me that I will do here here's
[1:12:45] brother Brown saying I'm not qualified
[1:12:48] and because he had just said that you'll
[1:12:49] go in all the world and you'll pray for
[1:12:51] kings and Patriarchs and and all these
[1:12:53] big people and and I never re and here
[1:12:56] brother Brown saying he said now I he
[1:13:00] well let me finish and he said how could
[1:13:01] I do that when I just have a grammar
[1:13:04] school education and this is going to
[1:13:06] shock you God was dealing with his life
[1:13:09] then and he said I had never received
[1:13:11] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:16] yet
[1:13:24] wow
[1:13:26] that's paragraph
[1:13:28] 15 on my angel's commission and these
[1:13:31] things were strange to me and I knew
[1:13:33] nothing about them then and I looked up
[1:13:34] again to speak to him and I said sir I
[1:13:38] could not do it and he said as Moses was
[1:13:41] sent two gifts to prove that he was
[1:13:42] Vindicated to the people he said you
[1:13:45] will be given two gifts and he talked
[1:13:48] about his science and his hands and he
[1:13:49] said now you'll be given to take your
[1:13:52] hands and Del lay on the people and he
[1:13:54] said I don't think you're going to he
[1:13:56] said you don't need to think of what
[1:13:58] you're going to say it'll just call what
[1:14:02] they have and you just be real reverent
[1:14:05] and he said I it'll come to pass that
[1:14:08] you'll know the very secrets of the
[1:14:10] people's heart and he said then they
[1:14:12] won't believe the first sign they'll
[1:14:14] believe the second sign and it'll come
[1:14:16] to pass that if you'll be sincere that
[1:14:19] this will get greater and greater and
[1:14:23] greater and so it was to me brother
[1:14:25] Brown said and I said sir because that
[1:14:28] then I'm I'm among my
[1:14:31] brethren and I see these visions and
[1:14:33] these Minister Brothers tell
[1:14:36] me that it's of the devil what you're
[1:14:40] doing in your life is of the devil
[1:14:42] buying this church was of the
[1:14:48] devil and I'm here that God will never
[1:14:51] let that happen to me again and quickly
[1:14:53] he walked in front of me me and asked me
[1:14:55] to stand up and I stood up and he said
[1:14:58] to me knowest thou not the
[1:15:02] scriptures I said well these other
[1:15:04] ministers doesn't know doesn't know
[1:15:07] doesn't agree with
[1:15:10] this and he said if this if this is what
[1:15:13] God would why would they have why
[1:15:16] wouldn't they have had it and he said
[1:15:19] this day
[1:15:21] is he said it is a day now for this and
[1:15:26] this is the hour and I said well why
[1:15:29] was this demon powers of
[1:15:33] spiritualism how did the devil know it
[1:15:35] that fortune teller and he said as it
[1:15:38] was in the days of the Lord he said
[1:15:40] that's the reason I knew that it wasn't
[1:15:41] of the Lord it wasn't the Lord because
[1:15:45] he said our Lord he he's talking about
[1:15:47] the angel he said and as in the Days of
[1:15:50] Our Lord sorry that's the reason I knew
[1:15:52] the angel was of the Lord sorry I said
[1:15:54] that wrong
[1:15:56] and he regarded our Lord as as our Lord
[1:15:59] him and brother brandham and he was the
[1:16:01] angel the man messenger and he say then
[1:16:03] in the days of the Lord when the
[1:16:04] ministers and the priests were in the
[1:16:06] temple they argued what kind of clothes
[1:16:09] they would should wear and the same
[1:16:10] thing and all these astronomers and he
[1:16:13] said that was the way they worshiped
[1:16:16] Jesus they knew him and the clergies
[1:16:19] didn't know him he's talking about the
[1:16:21] devil knew Jesus but the preachers in
[1:16:23] the Bible didn't and he said now the
[1:16:26] devil he said it's a devil the devil
[1:16:29] that said you know that you were you are
[1:16:32] a holy one of God and the priest said
[1:16:35] you are of the devil you are bth the
[1:16:38] devil now they said that to Jesus
[1:16:40] brother Rams just rephrasing that he
[1:16:42] said he's the son of God and the
[1:16:45] ministers here the Min the devil's
[1:16:47] saying he's the son of God and the
[1:16:49] ministers are calling Jesus the devil
[1:16:52] and he said the scare began to leave
[1:17:04] me and he talked about Paul and Silas
[1:17:07] and they they turned the world upside
[1:17:09] down he said the fortune teller said he
[1:17:11] said these men of God that tell you the
[1:17:14] way of life he said who is right he said
[1:17:17] the great deal the great deal the way it
[1:17:19] is today and that's true he said the
[1:17:22] Bible becomes a brand new book
[1:17:26] he said could you see it he said blessed
[1:17:28] are the eyes who can see and the ears
[1:17:31] that can hear for God has did this thing
[1:17:34] and Jesus said no man will come unto me
[1:17:36] unless the father draws
[1:17:39] them and my sheep will hear my voice and
[1:17:41] a stranger they won't follow ain't a
[1:17:44] that amazing how God was was breaking
[1:17:47] his
[1:17:48] commission down
[1:17:53] amen and so brother Brown shows how in
[1:17:57] his life the ministers never even knew
[1:18:01] recognize the gift that was in brother
[1:18:04] Brown's life
[1:18:08] amen and so is it today amen God's the
[1:18:11] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:18:13] let's just was was we're doing good here
[1:18:16] but let's you know we we laid our
[1:18:18] foundation of of God speaks in the
[1:18:20] heavenlies and and I believe we're going
[1:18:22] to go on a Rapture here soon and and and
[1:18:25] so we've read all those scriptures and
[1:18:27] and I just wanted to show you that when
[1:18:29] I was looking for how God speaks in the
[1:18:31] Heavenly here brother Brown's talking
[1:18:33] about his commission and it'll help you
[1:18:36] understand things in your life if we
[1:18:37] understand brother brandham and the
[1:18:39] things that he run into and his life
[1:18:41] amen and so we know and and this
[1:18:44] coming
[1:18:46] uh uh some of you many of you's probably
[1:18:49] seen this online and that but we know
[1:18:51] this coming April 24th we're going to
[1:18:53] have a solar eclipse
[1:18:55] and this will be the four the third
[1:18:57] solar eclipse that's happened fairly
[1:19:00] recently in our time since
[1:19:03] 2017 now we've already laid the
[1:19:06] foundation for our scriptures that a
[1:19:08] Rapture is going to have to happen
[1:19:12] sometime and it would appear like by the
[1:19:15] signs of the times that that's going to
[1:19:17] be soon and so we see that the first two
[1:19:19] solar eclipses that happened in 2017 and
[1:19:23] 2023
[1:19:25] amen uh made an A on the earth made an a
[1:19:29] across the states and in the Biblical
[1:19:32] Hebrew word that a is a ancient uh it's
[1:19:37] t
[1:19:38] AV tog was an X it was a type of the
[1:19:42] Cross but now in April this April in Jan
[1:19:46] uh April 8th 20 uh
[1:19:51] 2024 we're going to have another solar
[1:19:53] eclipse where the Moon which represents
[1:19:56] is just a reflection of the sun watch
[1:19:58] all the natural tapes is spiritual we're
[1:20:01] just a reflection of Christ is going to
[1:20:03] completely blot out the
[1:20:06] Sun and so it'll be Darkness on the
[1:20:09] earth for for a uh a moment and so let's
[1:20:13] just just walk into this so when that uh
[1:20:16] Eclipse that happens in April it's going
[1:20:18] to make it like an AEG so you you can
[1:20:20] pull that up if you got that picture Amy
[1:20:23] but in the Hebrew letter it's it's
[1:20:26] uh Alpha tear
[1:20:29] Alpha which means and we're going to
[1:20:32] read that
[1:20:33] Revelations uh
[1:20:35] 216 we'll pull it up when you're when
[1:20:38] you're done there but Revelations 26 and
[1:20:41] this Alpha here's God signing his name
[1:20:45] on
[1:20:46] America with the Bible making it a thing
[1:20:50] and this was Alpha and Omega the Hebrew
[1:20:52] word means Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:20:54] begin and the end he said here in
[1:20:57] Revelations 21:6 he said I am and he
[1:21:00] said unto me it is done I am Alpha and
[1:21:03] Omega the beginning and the
[1:21:07] end and so we see here in the Bible that
[1:21:11] when
[1:21:13] uh when Jonah when uh Jonah went to
[1:21:17] Nineveh and
[1:21:19] ministered in ancient times they had
[1:21:22] signs in the heavens also too and we
[1:21:24] know the story of Jonah and that and the
[1:21:26] Bible talks about that uh if I find my
[1:21:30] scripture here here we go maybe we'll
[1:21:32] just pull that up uh Amy Matthew 12 41-
[1:21:38] 42 and the men of n of us shall raise in
[1:21:41] the Judgment with this generation and
[1:21:43] shall condemn us it because they
[1:21:47] repented at the preaching of Jonah and
[1:21:50] behold there's a greater than Jonah here
[1:21:54] that's about that's that's Jehovah
[1:21:56] himself and the queen of the South will
[1:21:58] raise up in
[1:22:00] judgment with this generation and shall
[1:22:03] condemn it for she came from the
[1:22:05] outermost parts of the earth just to see
[1:22:08] the
[1:22:10] wisdom of a man that never had the Holy
[1:22:12] Ghost of
[1:22:15] Solomon and
[1:22:18] behold the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:21] here
[1:22:23] amen so we see see here you know that
[1:22:26] Jonah went to Nineveh and they repented
[1:22:28] because they seen the power of God and
[1:22:31] the queen of the South repented because
[1:22:34] she seen the power of God and we
[1:22:37] actually have the power of God they just
[1:22:40] had a types and shadows of the power of
[1:22:42] God but we have the Jehovah Gyra in our
[1:22:46] midst and so many times we don't live
[1:22:48] like that God help us so we see that in
[1:22:51] the ancient times they had a solar
[1:22:53] eclipse and it was in Nineveh and it was
[1:22:58] uh it was during the time that Noah or
[1:23:01] Jonah sorry ministered you know there
[1:23:04] Jonah ministered 40 days and the people
[1:23:08] repented and you if you look in the
[1:23:10] Bible you know God uses numerology so
[1:23:13] many times and so I'm just going to
[1:23:15] mention something here sidestep in the
[1:23:17] Bible you know in the Bible it rained
[1:23:19] for 40 days and 40 nights but it stopped
[1:23:22] on
[1:23:23] 41 most committed murder and hid in the
[1:23:26] desert for 40 years but he come back in
[1:23:30] 41 to rescue a
[1:23:33] people Moses went up in the mountain for
[1:23:36] 40
[1:23:37] days and in the 41th day he broughts the
[1:23:40] Commandments
[1:23:42] back Israel wered in the wilderness for
[1:23:44] 40 years but in the 41st year they went
[1:23:49] to the promised land Goliath tormented
[1:23:52] Israel for 40 days
[1:23:55] but on the 41st
[1:23:58] day David set him straight power of God
[1:24:02] Amen and Jonah preached the message of
[1:24:06] repentance to Nineveh 40 days and on the
[1:24:09] 40 first day God stopped his plan of
[1:24:13] Resto of destroying
[1:24:17] them wow Jesus fasted 40
[1:24:22] days and on the 40 first day the devil
[1:24:28] fled so these are all typologies and you
[1:24:31] know it's wrote in symbols and you got
[1:24:33] to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:24:35] understand this and you say well I don't
[1:24:36] mean nothing to me remember God's hiding
[1:24:38] it from the wise and The Prudent he's
[1:24:41] hiding it from the people that aren't
[1:24:43] his and so you got to have Revelation
[1:24:46] I'm not trying to make the Bible say
[1:24:47] nothing that it ain't saying if you
[1:24:50] don't see it it's perfectly fine but I
[1:24:52] read you all those quotes the foundation
[1:24:54] in the beginning of the message of go
[1:24:56] brother brandom your Prophet said and
[1:24:58] the Bible said that God talks through
[1:25:00] the sky and if he's this you know if he
[1:25:03] ain't the same God he's not a god at
[1:25:05] all
[1:25:08] amen so we see that when this Eclipse
[1:25:11] comes
[1:25:13] through in April it's going to
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:23] cross
[1:25:26] it's going to when it goes through
[1:25:28] America when it crosses America this
[1:25:30] solar eclipse it's going to cross seven
[1:25:32] cities that are named
[1:25:34] Nineveh and they're the same
[1:25:37] name that Jonah preached to and the
[1:25:41] Bible says that they repented but we
[1:25:45] wouldn't because the Bible says not the
[1:25:48] bride I mean you understand but the
[1:25:50] Bible said that ninva repented but this
[1:25:53] generation wouldn't and he would judge
[1:25:55] it now we're not talking about the elect
[1:25:58] lady the elect lady's already sealed
[1:26:00] amen you understand what I'm saying but
[1:26:01] this generation wouldn't repent now
[1:26:04] watch this but there's actually eight
[1:26:06] cities that this solar eclipse is going
[1:26:09] through on April 8 and eight your
[1:26:13] Prophet said is back to the beginning or
[1:26:16] eternity you know where the eight city
[1:26:18] is Nova Scotia
[1:26:22] Canada okay
[1:26:24] I I know this sounds
[1:26:27] crazy you know when I seen this first
[1:26:30] and God spoke to me I went back on the
[1:26:32] internet to find it and they had erased
[1:26:35] the
[1:26:37] cities the fact
[1:26:41] Checkers
[1:26:44] amen I'm telling you I believe with all
[1:26:47] my heart we're going home soon I don't
[1:26:51] know if it'll be this year I don't know
[1:26:53] if it'll be 5 5 years from now and I'm
[1:26:55] not saying change anything you're doing
[1:26:57] but I just believe we I I believe that
[1:26:59] our whole Focus besides worship and
[1:27:02] obedience should be preparing for a
[1:27:05] Rapture I believe that with all my heart
[1:27:07] now now I'm I'm saying you have to we
[1:27:09] have to we would freeze to death if we
[1:27:10] didn't prepare for I'm not saying don't
[1:27:12] prepare for old age yeah I'm prepared
[1:27:14] for old age but I I'm not really sure
[1:27:17] I'll be here for that I I pray to God
[1:27:19] I'm not pray to God I've had enough
[1:27:23] Taste of old age I don't need
[1:27:25] anymore amen I'm I'm dead serious we we
[1:27:28] cannot love this world and and think
[1:27:31] that we're going to be here forever
[1:27:32] you're not going to be here forever you
[1:27:34] weren't born to build a kingdom it's
[1:27:37] God's kingdom you were born to bring
[1:27:39] glory to God and go home I mean I know
[1:27:42] it's a paradox it it messes up your mind
[1:27:45] let me just read some of these cities
[1:27:47] and and I want to show you another
[1:27:49] example this this Dove tales that goes
[1:27:51] forever and and I hope you'll let me
[1:27:53] finish this today but so Nineveh the
[1:27:55] first city is in Texas the next one is
[1:27:57] in Mississippi the next one Nineveh you
[1:28:01] does anybody I wouldn't even have knew
[1:28:02] there was cities Nam like that who would
[1:28:05] pick a name
[1:28:07] Nineveh who picks these
[1:28:10] names Nineveh Indiana he said this will
[1:28:14] be the the highest altitude of the
[1:28:17] eclipse there's a Nineveh and Ohio
[1:28:19] Pennsylvania Virginia New York and the
[1:28:22] eighth one is in Nova
[1:28:25] Scotia is it possible God's trying to
[1:28:27] tell us something is it possible God's
[1:28:30] writing in the heavens of Revelation 216
[1:28:32] that I am the Alpha and Omega and it's
[1:28:34] completely
[1:28:37] finished if you believe this message
[1:28:39] it's finished we're not looking for
[1:28:40] another messenger we're not looking for
[1:28:42] another thus sayth the Lord we already
[1:28:44] got thus sayith the Lord up I me
[1:28:47] everywhere
[1:28:50] amen hallelujah and when you compare I'm
[1:28:53] not trying to make the scriptures please
[1:28:55] forgive me I'm not trying to make the
[1:28:56] scriptures say something that's not
[1:28:58] saying but when you look at this
[1:29:00] generation won't pass away and as in in
[1:29:02] the days of Sodom and you look at the
[1:29:04] signs in the heavens there's a purpose
[1:29:06] for these things amen now you know if
[1:29:08] you look at that so if you look at the
[1:29:11] last
[1:29:12] eclipse solar eclipse that went through
[1:29:15] it went through
[1:29:17] Salem and know and God does there's
[1:29:20] nothing per chance we're not we don't
[1:29:22] believe in luck or just just like oh you
[1:29:25] know what I mean good luck that's that's
[1:29:27] garbage we're
[1:29:30] Believers when God came and the solar
[1:29:33] eclipse the last uh the solar eclipse
[1:29:37] the first solar eclipse it went through
[1:29:39] salom it only went through Seven
[1:29:43] Cities which eight is back to Eternity
[1:29:46] the beginning seven is
[1:29:49] perfection seven is Christ it was
[1:29:52] through in Salem of Oregon and Wyoming
[1:29:54] and and all these Kentucky Mississippi
[1:29:56] South Carolina and all these cities see
[1:29:59] how the the the amazing how God's
[1:30:02] readying these things in the skies and
[1:30:05] unless you really study the scriptures
[1:30:07] do you know before they had the written
[1:30:09] bible that's the only
[1:30:12] Bible the only Bible they read but we're
[1:30:17] so advanced in knowledge we don't even
[1:30:19] use paper anymore praise
[1:30:22] God because everything's on screens
[1:30:24] everywhere and there's nothing wrong
[1:30:26] with that but you see how things have
[1:30:28] changed so much but all our all the
[1:30:30] things that we believe in the Bible was
[1:30:32] was for tolded in the skies how the how
[1:30:35] the how the Shepherds went to Jesus was
[1:30:37] told in the skies how the wise men went
[1:30:39] to Jesus was told in the skies I mean
[1:30:41] everything and we have no problem
[1:30:42] believing that but oh well oh now this
[1:30:44] is a
[1:30:45] stretch or is
[1:30:48] it amen God help
[1:30:52] us
[1:30:54] he said now here the most striking piece
[1:30:58] of evidence is the center line of the
[1:31:00] eclipse that exits the United States it
[1:31:02] ACS directly over and you have to
[1:31:06] forgive me because I'm close to
[1:31:10] but I'm going to name the name of the
[1:31:12] the city and the city that it exits the
[1:31:15] states means the body of Christ and it's
[1:31:19] ch h r i s TI and then that's the first
[1:31:24] word and the next word is c r p
[1:31:28] s the city that the solar eclipse exits
[1:31:33] United
[1:31:34] States and he said that's that City's
[1:31:38] name is the only name of a city in the
[1:31:45] world in the
[1:31:49] world the body of Christ is where the
[1:31:53] soul Eclipse goes off in the
[1:31:56] heavenlies

[1:32:05] know it should change our I mean I'm not
[1:32:08] I mean you got the Holy Ghost you

[1:32:11] know what I'm saying it just change our
[1:32:13] our it it'll it'll it'll bring into line
[1:32:16] our thought
[1:32:17] pattern and when you see these things
[1:32:19] and and and I showed you brother Brown's
[1:32:21] commission to show you that not every
[1:32:25] religious or spiritual person you're
[1:32:26] going to talk
[1:32:27] to is going to see what God's doing I me
[1:32:31] you understand and I'm not trying to
[1:32:33] make something up I'm not trying to be
[1:32:34] like super no no and I I'm not putting a
[1:32:38] day on it I don't mean I mean I still am
[1:32:41] looking for 40 or so

[1:32:46] other way maybe that there'll be spoken
[1:32:48] word grandkids in
[1:32:50] heaven

[1:33:17] ninama and from April 8th the time of
[1:33:21] the eclipse 40 days from a 48 is May
[1:33:25] 18th and it's the day of
[1:33:28] Pentecost amen you can just line up so
[1:33:32] much stuff here here the the next
[1:33:34] example is the third part of this the
[1:33:37] end of this solar eclipse will take
[1:33:39] seven years God always uses numbers in
[1:33:42] the Sev that's completion and Perfection
[1:33:46] example he created the world in seven
[1:33:48] years of and you know so many things
[1:33:50] that God himself was seven
[1:33:57] amen if you want to look at some more uh
[1:34:01] things that maybe are not so uh uh based
[1:34:04] on us so much but uh the
[1:34:10] city in uh
[1:34:14] Texas that the it passes
[1:34:22] through
[1:34:35] sorry it just nameing some of the other
[1:34:37] cities that The in the states that this
[1:34:40] uh solar eclipse will pass through that
[1:34:41] are not named
[1:34:43] Nineveh it's passing through a city's
[1:34:46] name in Indiana called
[1:34:50] Rapture it's passing through will will
[1:34:57] uh a city in Kentucky it's passing
[1:35:00] through where the ark encounter is
[1:35:04] located the full size of Noah's Ark the
[1:35:07] city where Noah's Ark is at is passing
[1:35:11] through Eagle Pass in Texas where
[1:35:14] they're having the states is having all
[1:35:15] the Border issues the solar eclipse is
[1:35:17] passing through it's po when it crosses
[1:35:20] the point at the axe is the area in
[1:35:25] Southern Illinois where it's called
[1:35:27] Little Egypt is the cross of the solar
[1:35:31] eclipse
[1:35:33] amen Little Egypt is Savaged in between
[1:35:37] two other cities that are called Alpha
[1:35:40] Kentucky and Omega
[1:35:42] Illinois both having the 2017th eclipse
[1:35:46] came over their
[1:35:49] cities amen you you couldn't make this
[1:35:51] up there's not a politician in the world
[1:35:53] that can make all this up
[1:35:57] amen and the 2017 and the 24 the eclipse
[1:36:02] that's coming occur directly over new
[1:36:06] the fault line the new magnetic fault
[1:36:12] line the earthquake fault
[1:36:17] line
[1:36:19] amen how close are we when you look at
[1:36:22] all these things amen how close are
[1:36:25] we and if you look at just maybe our
[1:36:28] closing fact here he said one more
[1:36:31] interesting fact
[1:36:33] was that
[1:36:36] uh there was
[1:36:38] 2,422 days between the 17 solar eclipse
[1:36:42] and the solar eclipse that's coming and
[1:36:45] if you look up that number and the
[1:36:48] strong concordance of the Bible it takes
[1:36:51] the word from Exodus 1 19
[1:36:54] which says the midwives answered Pharaoh
[1:36:57] the he the Hebrew women are not like the
[1:37:00] Egyptian women and they are virtuous and
[1:37:04] give birth before the midwives
[1:37:07] arrive talking about the strength that's
[1:37:10] in God's
[1:37:11] anointed at the time ain't that
[1:37:15] amazing how you can just piece these all
[1:37:19] together this just goes and goes and
[1:37:23] goes
[1:37:24] God speaking in the skies
[1:37:29] amen you know this world can't
[1:37:33] survive and we need to recognize that as
[1:37:35] the bride of Christ that God's calling
[1:37:38] us to go home
[1:37:41] amen and we need to bring in the last
[1:37:44] one and you know the Bible or scripture
[1:37:46] that we read you know when this word is
[1:37:48] preached in all the
[1:37:51] nations then the end will come
[1:37:54] but we've arrived to the End Amen and it
[1:37:57] should change it should change our whole
[1:37:59] being now I'm not talking about being
[1:38:01] unwise and don't prepare for winter or
[1:38:04] don't prepare for old
[1:38:07] age but I believe
[1:38:10] that if you look at the signs amen our
[1:38:13] Prophet believed that he would go in the
[1:38:17] Rapture he believed
[1:38:19] that bitterly and if you watch the world
[1:38:23] even the religious word even if you
[1:38:25] watch the message
[1:38:28] world are are we all expecting are we
[1:38:32] all just thinking like you know like
[1:38:35] Jared said during Co you know when when
[1:38:37] you have something like we have an
[1:38:40] anointing on
[1:38:41] us like you talk about a sign that ain't
[1:38:45] just focus on just the
[1:38:47] prophet now he had a special gift
[1:38:49] praying for the sick yes sir he did he
[1:38:51] was the the major Messenger to our
[1:38:54] yes sir he was
[1:38:56] amen but prophets and all the five-fold
[1:38:59] ministry you know the B it was the
[1:39:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost you have a
[1:39:03] sign on you let me bring it down to our
[1:39:05] our language the Bible says that let
[1:39:08] your light
[1:39:10] shine so when you get on this the bus in
[1:39:14] town that the fortune tellers will see a
[1:39:20] light around
[1:39:22] you you say well I don't think that
[1:39:24] would be for me that's what the Bible
[1:39:27] says says you'll be salty but there will
[1:39:29] be an atmosphere brother Brown said you
[1:39:32] are
[1:39:33] amateur
[1:39:36] creators and you you you are you he said
[1:39:40] you are you are Christ you are his bone
[1:39:44] and his flesh and you are the flesh body
[1:39:47] walking in Wyoming today that's Jehovah
[1:39:50] God Christ is the anointed one
[1:39:55] so I'm making it
[1:39:57] personal but watch this but see the
[1:40:00] preachers in brother Brown like not all
[1:40:02] the religious people recognized
[1:40:05] it and amen and even brother Brown
[1:40:08] didn't until the angel came to him but
[1:40:11] God will be sharing things with us and
[1:40:15] yes we're going to go ahead inside this
[1:40:16] church hopefully all this year and it'll
[1:40:18] be nice for when we're
[1:40:22] gone they can do whatever they
[1:40:25] want amen but I believe we're going home
[1:40:29] real soon and I don't believe I don't
[1:40:32] believe and and there was there's
[1:40:33] probably twice as much stuff in
[1:40:35] there
[1:40:37] facts about the solar eclipse than what
[1:40:40] I shared with you there's no way that a
[1:40:43] physical government and a God could come
[1:40:47] together and all the lines line up so
[1:40:51] perfectly it's God telling us
[1:40:53] something this world can't
[1:40:56] survive this this world can't survive
[1:40:58] you know all the news you know what's
[1:41:00] going on everywhere in the world it
[1:41:02] cannot
[1:41:03] survive can't survive and there's
[1:41:06] already War right beside Israel right
[1:41:08] around Israel right almost you might say
[1:41:11] in Israel and all it's got to do is RA
[1:41:14] up the hatred for Israel which that's
[1:41:18] all
[1:41:22] uhhuh the Israel president refuses to
[1:41:26] follow the US plan for a double
[1:41:31] State man that's all that has to happen
[1:41:33] we're not here when that happens you
[1:41:36] know we're not here when the Tabernacle
[1:41:38] is built the prophet said that we're not
[1:41:41] here we're not here for that it'll just
[1:41:44] you say well how are they ever going to
[1:41:45] build the Tabernacle when there's
[1:41:46] already things on the mount one bomb
[1:41:49] just one bomb
[1:41:51] just one bomb
[1:41:53] am but we're not here for that we're not
[1:41:55] even here for any of the atomic bombs
[1:41:58] you do you know that potin warned the
[1:42:01] the the uh whatever the the
[1:42:04] NATO that if they send ground troops
[1:42:07] into to
[1:42:10] Ukraine I'm not afraid of it I say
[1:42:12] praise the Lord hallelujah I want to
[1:42:14] have to pay my
[1:42:16] taxes

[1:42:21] you'll start World War III if you
[1:42:23] sending ground troops in ugan and
[1:42:25] Ukraine and he said I will not rule out
[1:42:28] nuclear
[1:42:30] war amen you you say Brother D why are
[1:42:33] you preaching like this you need to go
[1:42:34] listen to the prophet he preached like
[1:42:37] that he preached like that you people
[1:42:39] building all these bunkers and all that
[1:42:41] and he said you going to be just the
[1:42:42] only thing you need is just be protected
[1:42:44] by the feathers of Jehovah Gyra the
[1:42:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost man brother
[1:42:49] Brown preach like this all the time we
[1:42:51] we don't hear this kind of preaching
[1:42:52] anymore we're going going

[1:43:24] are selling off their wealth their
[1:43:26] stocks turning it to Gold precious
[1:43:28] metals and a lot of their precious the
[1:43:31] the the wealthiest people in the world

[1:43:57] for them it is brother Dale's not
[1:44:01] building a bomb shelter I'm building a
[1:44:04] holy ghost
[1:44:05] shelter and I'm going to recognize the
[1:44:07] stuff that's happening not from a
[1:44:09] political standpoint I'm going to
[1:44:11] recognize it from look at the time clock

[1:45:03] fly
[1:45:05] away man we can't doves don't eat each
[1:45:07] other they don't have G they just eat

[1:45:13] thing is just atmosphere and our home
[1:45:16] should just be am man you don't think so
[1:45:18] it I I'm telling you it's don't put
[1:45:20] everything on the profit you I mean the
[1:45:23] prophet had a special gift yes but he
[1:45:26] had the same Holy Ghost you have it's
[1:45:29] the same God great I mean listen to the
[1:45:31] pro listen to our prophet's message he
[1:45:33] said Jesus was was was God in flesh yes
[1:45:37] he was but he said God made a tabernacle
[1:45:39] and he said Jesus was just the flesh
[1:45:41] body and Christ the Holy Ghost came
[1:45:43] inside him and he was the god that was
[1:45:45] in him when God was done with that body
[1:45:47] he could care less about that
[1:45:49] flesh amen it's not about to bad your
[1:45:52] skin
[1:45:53] so the same holy ghost that was in
[1:45:55] Christ Jesus is exactly in you we're
[1:45:58] living brother Brown said you're living
[1:46:00] a million miles below what God has for
[1:46:02] you A Million Miles because it's it's
[1:46:06] everything

[1:46:19] know that man can imitate and copy even
[1:46:22] uh Satan can imitate and copy all the
[1:46:24] gifts and all these
[1:46:26] things but when things happen that man
[1:46:29] can't control and God's doing it in
[1:46:32] nature in the
[1:46:34] skies you don't have to believe me but
[1:46:36] if you believe your prophet and you look
[1:46:38] at what he
[1:46:39] said and the very very very first
[1:46:44] Bible was wrote in the
[1:46:47] skies and God will still use that
[1:46:50] Sky to write again and he's doing it I
[1:46:54] believe he's doing it right now amen God
[1:46:57] help us to God help me amen just to even
[1:47:01] even when we go on and live our
[1:47:03] lives to always have that

[1:47:15] we don't you know but brother Brown's
[1:47:18] seen so many things

[1:47:23] light over
[1:47:24] you it'll be the world that'll catch the
[1:47:27] environment when they come in when they

[1:48:07] our licks of fire and this place is a
[1:48:09] holy thing and there's people walking in
[1:48:12] here and dropping off money and
[1:48:15] charges and putting us first and
[1:48:17] actually doing different
[1:48:20] things man that's no
[1:48:23] mistake it's an atmosphere it's a
[1:48:26] Heavenly atmosphere it's not about
[1:48:28] brother Dale it's about us all it's
[1:48:29] about God it's the Holy Ghost in every
