amazing amen we just uh just love you and thank you and we just had a good time last night and just uh looking forward to what the Lord will bring this just a wonderful brother that's with us and and I just I just share this so you'll try to understand because sometimes if we don't see the behind the scenes this brother is still waking up at 1 2:00 in the morning because 2:00 in the morning is the middle of the afternoon for him so they're going they're in bad right now okay it's nighttime so if you think he's off they're sleeping at home I'm just you know what saying just you know his his family will all be in bed amen so it just it takes a few days amen travel amen if you never traveled you won't understand that if you do that's the only reason I say that amen but it uh just amazing to be here and am man we just have one testimony we're going to sing a song I Feel the pull just the brother shared about the kite you know you know sometimes we have trials and tribulations and you know every Son of God will be tried and tested to to to prove that they're a Son of God and you might not be able to see see God in your life today but if you can feel the tug on the string you might have cloudes of Health you might have clouds of of depression you might have clouds of finances you might have Satan just building the clouds he's thinking that you're the only one like the prophet there's nobody else serving God but if you can feel the tug he say how do you know I'm connected cuz I can feel the pull oh hallelujah it's an amazing Revelation that God give us in this day amazing Revelation so we have a testimony from Brother Jeff and sister dla and they sold their house in kiter amen God give them Grace to uh you know God's will is perfect every time God's will is perfect every time and his timing is perfect you know they tried before to sell they tried before it to move and in the same time that God blessed them to sell in their house or looking at a place very close to us for just slightly over half price to what they sold for now you know our Prophet said things like this he said anytime you move closer to church you're in God's will now there now there's a church in Kitchener a wonderful brother Jose's church but he said something else anytime you are less burdened by the cares and finances of life and you can get out of debt I know we don't think of this but the Bible's still real and the Bible says the borrower I know what brother Bram said about that but if you're a borrower you have a chain on your leg and if they can get out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt they can spend more Church time more family time more devotion time more prayer time and all these things amen that's amazing and God is very good now now I have their permission to share that amen and just pray for them that it'll just fall together you know it's a hectic time for them because they're going to have a baby too and so they're literally going to have a baby and there's just a lot of things going on they actually haven't purchased the place they're looking at yet can you imagine you know just but God's it's all about him he's completely in control

verse three and also let's prepare uh 1 Peter chapter 2:5 it it says here in Romans chapter 15 verse one we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmity ities of the weak and not to please ourselves let us let everyone of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me and uh First Peter chapter uh chapter 2 verse 5 H Allelujah it says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ may the Lord had blessing upon the reading of his word and you may be seated in the presence of the Lord H Allelujah so uh before I proceed to the word of God I would like to grab this

hour backward yeah we are now uh 13 hours ahead other side of uh they are now sleeping are at home and so just pray for me and uh bless Jes uh uh God can can do anything hallelujah amen so this morning I would like to talk about the topic the royal priesthood Hallelujah the verses that uh scripture that we read it says when we that are we then that are strong right ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves Hallelujah so Amen Let everyone of us please his neighbor for his good edification for even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach the fell on me and ye also as Lively stones are built up ye the Believers yes as Lively stones are built up by spiritual heart house and holy priesthood Hallelujah for what to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ spiritual houses and holy priesthood to sacrifice to offer up S spiritual sacrifices yes now if you talk about priests in the Old Testament they are those people who live with a dedicated life to God and not to live for their own but to serve for their Brethren Hallelujah in when when Joshua had divided the land the Levites which are the priests Hallelujah ah they didn't they didn't have any portion of the land Hallelujah but I believe that God took care of them because their portion is God hallelujah and in Revelation 5: 10 it says that he had he has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth amen so it it is it is uh no it was no no longer not only the Levites but we Hallelujah the Believers yes Hallelujah Christ made us Kings and Priests unto our God hallelujah and Peter said to offer up spiritual sacrifices Hallelujah now we cannot understand this spiritual without uh uh the natural Hallelujah and the natural is Israel is type Allelujah to the church which is the spiritual Israel and now this morning I would like to take an example Allelujah of the journey Israel's Journey from Egypt into the promised land Hallelujah and baham said we know that they have the promised land the natural land but baham said that our promised land is not a natural land no Hallelujah many people he says in uh as I was with Moses so I will be with thee he says many people refer the promised land to the Millennium to the Millennium it is not the promised land had Wars and killings the Millennium won't have any wars or killings it referred to the Holy Spirit the battle grounds am hallelujah our promise is our life in the Holy Ghost Hallelujah they have a promise natural land but our promise Peter said for the promise is unto you and unto your children to your children's children Hallelujah andto all that he is going to call Hallelujah This Promise is for them Hallelujah which is the holy ghost that we can possess that kind of Life Hallelujah and then once we become a part of that body the body of Jesus Christ Braham said by one Spirit yes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by one Spirit we are all baptized into that body and once we we became a part of that body barram said we are not on a picnic Hallelujah we are on a Battleground right Hallelujah so the battle will began will begin Hallelujah and now on Israel's Journey from Egypt into the promised land they have these three stages yeah Hallelujah and uh just like our Redemption Hallelujah so our Redemption is justification and uh sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Israel they also have this Allelujah the church the C out ones when they left Egypt that's justification and then when they cross the Red Sea Allelujah killed all behind them killed the Egyptians killed the world all behind them and through the blood Hallelujah that kills all the human desires the evil desires Hallelujah and God was sanctifying them through the blood Hallelujah of the animals and then the third uh stage is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was when they crossed Jordan into the promised land Jordan means death Hallelujah and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are born into that body of Jesus Christ which is the family of God hallelujah and then you know in the denomination sometimes they say they have this their testimonies oh since I became a Christian I am I am now peaceful I am now of course we we are now resting in Christ Hallelujah but that's the time that battle begin yes battle began Hallelujah because when the greatest battle that happened in the time of Israel was not when they left Egypt the greatest battle happened Hallelujah when they Cross Jordan the battle was intensified when they started to possess the promised land H Allelujah those who Cross Jordan death Hallelujah now in natural battle Hallelujah they need a team you know why today in we call it West philippin sea or South China Sea right and then uh I think just this month or last yeah yeah this month uh last October Allelujah The The J the Japanese uh forces and the US forces and Australian forces they had this war games you know practicing in order to create a a teamwork in order to have a Harmony right hallelujah amen and then even the Philippines we have a an military treaty you know right we always have this uh we call it in our language they call it they called it balikatan it mean military exercises uh balikatan is shoulder Tosh shoulder Allelujah they practice the artillery all the forces the Air Force and the Navy and the ground forces and they are practicing you know huah the the they are uh Hallelujah creating a Harmony between them Hallelujah and there's only one Commander not many Commander Hallelujah and the church is the same thing Hallelujah we have we only have one Commander which is the holy spirit Hallelujah and we need to to fight shoulder Tosh shoulder hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] and uh you know when I was a boy we had uh there is a a camp military camp in our village and uh sometimes when there is no operation sometimes these uh armies uh are drinking you know and then and when they get drunk and sometimes they fight you know but when it comes to operation they have to forget all their differences Hallelujah am they have to support they have to protect their each uh each other Hallelujah you don't have to kill you don't have to shoot your your fellow you know s soldiers because he can protect you as as you can protect him too Hallelujah so you have to Hallelujah fight shoulder Tosh shoulder Hallelujah forget all the differences and especially in this hour for the Believers that Satan is doing everything that he can Hallelujah we should know our enemy it is not the brother it's not the sister hallelujah amen we have the common enemy which is Satan that's right Hallelujah and we we should realize that Hallelujah so uh the scripture that we read it says that we then that are strong ought to Bear infirmities of the weak yes sir Hallelujah and it means we should not we should not uh just live for ourselves but but for our neighbors for our brothers right and baram said uh in the message that day on Calvary he says now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life amen hallelujah eternal life is living for others hallelujah hallelujah eternal life is living for us others true wow we should be a support we should be a help Hallelujah but you Lord remember it says we did that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak to Bear the infirmities of the weak amen hallelujah but the question is how can you bear the infirmities of the weak when you yourself is weak we knew yourself is still a baby Hallelujah but praise God hallelujah I believe we recognize it and even we sing it I am weak but Thou Art strong right am Hallelujah but the reason he gave us this faithful Ministry is in order for us not to remain remain children huh Hallelujah right in Ephesians chapter 4 from verse 11 to 14 it says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for what perfecting for the perfecting of the same sa perfecting of the saints Saints must be perfected they are already Saints and they must be perfected for the work of the ministry for the edifying edifying edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so we can see here brothers and sisters that Paul he was repeating perfecting unto a perfect man measure of the stature of the fullness Hallelujah the word perfect here it means full grown that's right matured that's right adult Hallelujah not to remain children not to remain uh weak Believers Hallelujah that we H for be no more children right yes to to and fr and carried about with every wi of Doctrine by the slight of men and canning craftiness whereby delay in which to deceive Hallelujah God will not marry a baby no Jesus Christ will not marry an immature that's Hallelujah right because an immature it cannot produce Seed Life Hallelujah so he wants us to be matured which is it means perfect Hallelujah because a child cannot help a child is weak cannot help Hallelujah the infirmities of the weak Hebrews chap 5 verse 12 it says for when the time you ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat it seems that the Paul is disappointed maybe Paul is saying oh you've been 20 years 30 years 40 years Hallelujah and you ought to be teachers now you ought to help you ought to teach you to to support and then you are still a baby needing milk and not strong strong meat Hallelujah on now now what is a sign what is a sign of of a child or a babe what is the visible sign that a Christian is still a babe or a child let's read 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto caral Hallelujah so spiritual and caral even as unto babes in Christ so to be babes is to be carnal to be spiritual is to be matured and now Paul here he is not doubting them being in Christ right no no but they are still a babe but even though they are babed but praise God they are already in Christ am Hallelujah babe in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat they canot bear strong meat right Hallelujah that's why Paul said I am just feeding you with milk and another meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able Hallelujah for ye are yet caral right why Hallelujah whereas there is among you enying so enying is one of the sign of cardinality one of the sign of being a babe not matured and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for while while one says I am a PO and another I am of Apollos divisions are you not carnal wow Hallelujah carnality is being yet a b a babe Hallelujah and if you are still a babe Hallelujah Hebrews 5:13 for for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe Hallelujah unskillful for he is yet a babe imagine you will go to battle and you have babes with you instead of a support and they became a burden Hallelujah I hope we are not a burdened church but a support in the church Hallelujah unskillful now here is the sign of a matured one or a matured believer let's read uh John chapter 21: 18 thank you Lord it says verily verily I say unto you unto thee when thou was young thou geest thyself and West with thou West but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall G thee and carry thee with thou West not so when you are still young you wear the clothes you wear the dress that you want to wear and you go to places where you want to go but when you are old you just stretch forth your hands and even though you do not like red shared amen you can do nothing amen it would not your will be done anymore right amen hallelujah but he that yes takes care of you yes Hallelujah when you were young Hallelujah you want to go I want to go there your will will be done hallelujah but when you are old when you are matured you are no longer do doing your own will but somebody's will is being done you learn how to submit your own will into his will amen yes praise God I hope you get it hallelujah amen you learn how to say lord yesen it's not my will be done but your will be done hallelujah and everything that you you you want to do you you think this is good Lord this is hallelujah I think this is good is it good for you is this your will for me and sometimes hallelujah hallelujah even our works you you see oh there's a nice offer a good offer Hallelujah without then just grab that opportunity without praying Lord hallelujah even though you cannot go to church anymore hallelujah thank you Lord you know when Paul when he was yet before his conver his conversion his will was to persecute the Believers Hallelujah but after he was converted amen he was not living by his own it is it was Christ now that lives in him and instead of persecuting giving burdens and now he is now a big to the Believers Hallelujah when he became when he was converted he became con converted Hallelujah he now can say I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live but not I Hallelujah it is Christ that liveth in me and the life is live in the flesh I live by the faith even his faith not his faith by the faith of the Son of God hallelujah who loved me and gave himself for me Hallelujah you know Peter he got a heart for the Lord yes Hallelujah yes when Jesus said oh the the shepherd will be smitten you know scatter and the ship will scatter maybe Peter said Over My Dead Body right Hallelujah and here comes Malco when they were about to Hallelujah arrest their Master right yes sir when Malco was about to uh arrest Jesus and Peter he grab his maybe his maet and then he Hallelujah am and then Malco he did like that then he the heir of Mal was Hallelujah you know it's carnality yes Hallelujah he was caral Mark 10:28 he says then Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed thee Lord what can we get we get we have left all and have followed thee and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house house or Brethren or sisters or fathers uh fathers or mothers or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive 100 fold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life hallelujah hallelujah amen and then before that Jesus said in Luke chapter 22 verse 31-32 and the Lord said Peter uh Simon Simon behold Satan ha desired um to have you that ye may uh sh you as with but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren Hallelujah maybe Peter at the time he was uh his heart was you know for his master and he have done everything but he was not yet converted no right although he got he always got his Mach on his side he didn't became a support but Jesus said in the last part of the Book of Luke in the later part of the Book of Luke chapter 22 Hallelujah and when thou art converted that's the time that you can strengthen amen your brethren when did Peter was converted when he was filled with the Holy Ghost thank you Lord and you know brothers and sisters maybe after Jesus uh after he ascended and then uh now the disci the apostles and the the Believers are now uh preaching the gospel and maybe Peter's neighbors are you know criticizing him Hallelujah I believe Peter he got a family he got a wife because he got a mother-in-law maybe his neighbors are you know saying oh this man is uh he is uh what do you call this uh irresponsible he keeps on leaving and uh Hallelujah it seems uh to them that that Peter is abandoning his family wow but the thing that they didn't know is there are thousands of Soul of souls that right are being helped right being saved being Hallelujah and Peter became a support Hallelujah because he he was no longer living for himself but living Hallelujah for for others after that he was he became converted after he became uh he was baptized was filled with the Holy Ghost amen after Pentecost Hallelujah and he was no longer living he became a support because he was no longer Hallelujah living for his own right he was no longer living by his you know his five senses but by there is now someone who was leading him Hallelujah it it's

WoW instead of look only to the word hallelujah amen thank they didn't depend on the word they didn't walk by faith they walk by sight imagine 40 years all so maturity does not depend on how long you've been a Christian thank you Lord now let's read numbers 13: 26 from beginning at verse 26 and they went and came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of Paran to Cades and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land with thou sentest us and

and by the coast of Jordan Hallelujah but here comes calib calb and calib Ste the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it why hallelujah what that 10 spies saw calb saw them too but what is the difference they depend on their senses while calb and Joshua did depend on what the word says that then they walk by sight but Caleb and josua they walk by faith wow we are Hallelujah are we are will able to overcome it but the men that went up with the them said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up a nil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof they are eating human beings wow how did you say that you went there 12 and then you come back 12 yeah who was the one true yeah that was eaten by those people by the inhabitants of that land right you know because of their you know imag imagination of Their Fear you know and uh they can say you can wow oh Hallelujah and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there was the Giants the son of anoch which come up which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight h Hallelujah wow imagine Elite people Great Men of Israel chosen from every tribe supposed to be strong Hallelujah and would help the weak and because they walk by sight and not by faith because they were carnal by observation Hallelujah of their five senses their report made the week be became more weaker Hallelujah sometimes oh you know you know sister is you know you know that sister is you the brother is uh oh isn't it oh wow our you know you know our pastor you know is like this he done like this huh is it true yeah oh my Hallelujah the weak the carnal hallelujah how long you've been in the message Hallelujah wow chapter 14 verse1 numbers and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in this Wilderness oh Hallelujah and wherefore had the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be AF prid where it not better for us to return into Egypt Hallelujah had the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword do you think God will do it God will allow it no way hallelujah it's only Hallelujah by their unbelief instead of trusting put their all their trust in God hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah were it not better for us to return into Egypt return into the world because they didn't didn't have any confidence to god wow imagine who was leading them for 40 years and everything all that they need all the The Impossible became possible they Pro it for for for 40 years right right Hallelujah and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt Rebellion Hallelujah against their leader wow I don't want the leader that you gave me I want to choose my own choosing Hallelujah then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of non and Caleb the son of je jeoni which were of them that search the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land hallelujah amen yes it is true it is exceeding good land Hallelujah the word is true the uh the promise of God is true Hallelujah and he said if the Lord Delight in us if he will please in US amen how can we please God Amen without faith it is impossible to please him for everyone that Hallelujah must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him wow unbelief cannot please him it's only faith that can please him if the Lord will Delight in us if the Lord please in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey Lord only believe Hallelujah always believe what the word says hallelujah not to what we see or we feel right amen verse n Only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us hallelujah they are just bread for us the time they said we are just grass uper But Here Comes Here is Joshua and calb they are just bread for us bread they are giant yeah giant bread Hallelujah their defense is departed from them and the Lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation B Stone them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel wow Hallelujah verse 40 and they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain saying Lo we be here and will go up unto the place where the Lord had promised for we have sinned and Moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the Commandment of the Lord but it shall not Prosper if it is not against if it is against his will it will not Prosper hallelujah hallelujah go not up for the Lord is not among you that you be not spitten before your enemy PE for the amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the Lord hallelujah therefore the Lord will not be with you maybe they're trusting before we came you know we defeated them Hallelujah and now we can do it again but the Lord is no longer longer with them right Hallelujah but they presumed to go up on the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwell in that hill and Smo them and discomfited them even unto horma Hallelujah Elite imagine the they should be a support right right but what they did is they pulled him down you know Hallelujah because Hallelujah they didn't look to the word they didn't Hallelujah de base the report on their five senses and not to what the Lord says hallelujah I me what did the Paul say concerning Abraham Hallelujah stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief although he is already weak Hallelujah but he just believed but thank God Hallelujah there were Joshua and calib who didn't depend on their senses but they held to what the word said and we need more Joshua and Caleb today Hallelujah now and after this God commanded Joshua to circumcise the people before the face before the face Hallelujah another battle in Joshua chapter 5: 2-5 it says at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Yeshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the the hill of the forkins and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcised all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the children yes sir in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they had not circumcised so here's the thing brother and sisters all the people all the males that came out of Egypt they were all circumcised right right but those that were born in the wilderness no circumcision yeah why in Egypt they don't have a prophet and yet they remember the word the Covenant of God to to to Abraham wow in Egypt they were very busy from their task Masters their obligation to their task Masters and to their families and yet they have time to circumcise why is it that when they came to the Wilderness they were not busy and on most of all they have the prophet yes yes but they didn't have time to circumcise their CH wow children why in bondage Hallelujah you know what this this this point here it only uh confirm or uh yeah magnify the message you know or prove that the message that we have is true yes baham said Egypt left Egypt justification Wilderness sanctification entering Canaan baptism of the Holy Ghost and our circumcision is not in flesh but in spirit in the heart Hallelujah by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so during Wilderness it is not the stage of just no baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the stage of sanctification so there is no circumcision which is the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen is it not you know wow Hallelujah Beautiful Lord now literal circumcision it is the cutting of the skin the outside skin Hallelujah and uh I can relate this because this this is what we do in the Philippines before you became U you turn into adulthood you have during the time of Joshua H Allelujah when you circumcise a baby you know when you circumcise a baby it is not his decision it is the decision of the parents and he do not have any decision you know whether he like it or not his parents his father will circumcise him H Allelujah and at this time they are not babies anymore they have their own decision whether they are going to face that sharp KN or not or no yes but they cannot possess the land except they be circumcised amen is it hurts but they have to accept it Hallelujah the to is Ser huah you cannot possess the land you cannot possess your inheritance you cannot possess the promise Hallelujah without cutting cut all the flesh hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you Lord and our circumcision is in the heart circumcision In the Flesh has done nothing without salvation hallelujah it's the circumcision of the heart circumcision without circumcision has nothing to do with our uh Salvation now Joshua chapter 1 verse 1 to 9 Hallelujah now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of n Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all the people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given you given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness of this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river uprates all the land of the he titites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen no man amen be able to stand before thee all the days of of your life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Hallelujah I will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen now here's the thing brothers and sisters be strongu strong Hallelujah and of a good courage For unto these people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them so in order for Joshua to be strong to lead the people in order for Joshua to lead the people he must be strong and be courageous how to be strong verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law Hallelujah even it see it seems that uh it it don't you know you don't agree with it right if it is the law Hallelujah do it according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left hand that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest West amen hallelujah not your judgment even it seems that your judgment is right right right no you have to do turn it amen amen turn not Hallelujah from it to the right or to the left this book of the law shall not Depart of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to the law to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success Hallelujah have not I commanded thee be strong be strong thank you Lord and have good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee and whether is with thee whether thou goest am I believe this is not only for Joshua but this is for every one of us hallelujah just to believe be not dismayed Hallelujah have faith be still and know that I am God hallelujah Joshua must have to look only to the word and not to trust his own ability then Joshua chapter 3 verse 1 to4 it says and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from cim and came to Jordan Jordan and all the children of Israel and loads there before the passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for for ye have not passed this way hether here to for now and the priest the Levites bearing it the question is who is the leader their leader of course it was now Joshua right and Joshua is the type of the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost Joshua is the leader but when you look them marching it was the priest who are bearing the ark who are bearing the word are the are leading leading them amen who is the leader of the church it is the Holy Ghost where Hallelujah in the ministers thank you Lord hallelujah and then he says yet there shall be a space between you Ed it don't go ahead of your pastor you just support your pastor you just Hallelujah obey your pastor Jesus even you even if it is you think that oh I have a good idea than my pastor you cannot have a higher Revelation than your pastor Hallelujah because if you are the pastor then you are the one that God uh put in the church as a pastor Hallelujah it says the priest you have to Hallelujah follow them that's right 300 3,000 ft in distance 2,000 cubits don't go ahead of your pastor Hallelujah barram said in perian church age but the hidden Mana was a special Revelation because he had to teach the others see was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others he's supposed to be is that right you will never live no higher than your pastor you just remember that see cuz he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's the shepherd he's got to know where the Mana is to feed the ship Hallelujah is that right now let's continue reading Hallelujah Joshua chapter 3 verse 14 and it came to pass when the people removed their tents and pass over Jordan and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they that bear the ark were come into Jordan and the feet of the priests that bur the the ark were deep in the brim of the water for Jordan overflow with all his Banks all the time of harvest that the water which came down from above stood and Rose up upon and hip very far from the city Adam that is beside zaran and those that came down toward the Sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and and were cut off and the people passed over right against Jericho Hallelujah and the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites passed over thank you Lord all dry ground until all the people were pass clean over Jordan now here's the thing brother and sisters Hallelujah imagine if you are the priest of that time and then you see this River with strong current because all the snow were melting melting right Hallelujah and then Joshua will tell you okay you stand in the midst of Jordan maybe oh I cannot do it I still have children little children that I need to support right come on Hallelujah but because they are priest right and priest is to minister to live for their to do sacrifices no matter what Hallelujah even if it if it will cost his life he will do it that's right hallelujah amen but praise God when they started walking when they steep in to that water that the water was divided Hallelujah and they stood there H Allelujah and the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan Hallelujah they have to wait until all thank you Lord hallelujah and the Holy Spirit Joshua was watching there the tribes of Roven the tribes of Judah the tribe of Simeon and making sure Hallelujah that all the Seed of Abraham can possess the land beautiful sir but brothers and sisters here is here are the priests yes amen standing there carrying the Ark of the Covenant you know the material that they made they made
