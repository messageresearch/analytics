[25:36] another year we're still here still
[25:40] together still on Christ's side amen and
[25:44] yes let's just read the first three
[25:46] verses here behold how good and how
[25:49] pleasant it is for bre Brethren to dwell
[25:53] in unity it is like the precious
[25:55] ointment upon the head that ran down
[25:58] upon the beard even Aaron's beard that
[26:01] went to the skirt of His Garment that
[26:03] include the whole congregation the whole
[26:05] body and as the DW of Herman and and as
[26:09] the DW that descendeth upon the
[26:11] mountains of Zion for there the Lord
[26:14] commanded the blessings even life everm
[26:18] more and the Lord commanded the
[26:21] blessings even life everm more Lord
[26:24] Jesus we pray that you'll add the
[26:26] blessing to your word Lord God and we
[26:28] pray that you'll bless your bride this
[26:31] morning and as the word Goes Forth may
[26:34] it it build us up in your faith Lord
[26:36] Jesus and and uh make us more like you
[26:39] Lord Jesus we pray in jesus' name we
[26:42] pray amen amen you may have your seats
[26:45] this
[26:49] morning Lord willing next week we're
[26:51] going to look at part of the Statue of
[26:53] the perfect man and and look at virtue
[26:56] was the main thing but we see here
[26:58] you know as long as we're on Earth the
[27:01] Bible says that you'll know
[27:02] them are we'll know that they're Christ
[27:05] disciples by how they love one another
[27:08] amen and we we need to get you know we
[27:11] need to you you get what you expect amen
[27:15] and and I I've actually been looking at
[27:17] that brother Brandon preached that and
[27:19] and that's very true and you know when
[27:21] you look even and I'm I'm I'm veering
[27:24] off here a minute but even when you look
[27:26] at the Statue of the perfect man you
[27:27] know the bottom of the the perfect man
[27:30] is is Faith and faith is to believe in
[27:33] God but you know there's many people
[27:34] that believe and never go farther than
[27:37] that you know Satan
[27:39] believes and trembles and there's so
[27:42] much more that God has for us up the
[27:45] statue of the perfect man I better get
[27:47] off that or I have to change my notes
[27:49] but we see here that you know God God
[27:52] did God planned his family to be in
[27:55] unity and even as he Compares this to
[27:57] the Prophet here when when he was
[27:59] anointed and it went down over the whole
[28:01] body of the the congregation the whole
[28:03] body of his right to the bottom of his
[28:05] skirt you know and and I want to bring
[28:08] this thought to you this morning you
[28:10] know the Bible says that every seed will
[28:12] bring forth of its kind and that's a
[28:15] really basic seed and that was in the
[28:17] Genesis in the garden but we see you
[28:19] know that cattle bring forth cattle and
[28:22] dog and all these things everything
[28:24] brings forth exactly of its kind the
[28:26] seed won't mix yeah amen but now let's
[28:30] think
[28:32] spiritual you believe you came from God
[28:36] you believe he's your heavenly
[28:38] father and every seed brings forth of
[28:41] its
[28:43] kind that means you're a part of God's
[28:46] family and you'll be a peculiar people
[28:49] you will act different you will have you
[28:51] will have the characteristics of your
[28:54] father which number one will be love God
[28:56] is love he'll have understand
[28:58] understanding and patience he'll
[28:59] understand his his situation but he'll
[29:02] have Unity that will dwell and and we
[29:04] preached that before in the family but
[29:06] the for a father to see the family in
[29:09] unity but to see his Heavenly family in
[29:12] unity and you know this thought was in
[29:15] my my uh me when I was thinking of the
[29:17] end of the year and thinking of all
[29:19] that's went past and the years we've
[29:20] been here and many of you's been in the
[29:22] faith longer than me and and older than
[29:25] me but God's kept us and there's a
[29:28] reason for it is is because we're part
[29:30] of his family and and and we bringing
[29:33] forth the seed that we are it's a seed
[29:36] that he predestinated you too he
[29:39] predestinated you to
[29:41] Unity amen God help us look at the the
[29:45] end of this scripture in verse three and
[29:47] he said there the Lord commanded it
[29:49] wasn't it wasn't a casual thing God
[29:51] commanded
[29:53] blessings on
[29:55] you it it was an order yeah says I know
[29:59] the thoughts that I have towards my
[30:01] family that wasn't in general to the
[30:03] world that was to you I know the
[30:06] thoughts that I have towards
[30:08] you amen and we as individuals in our
[30:12] body Tabernacle of Flesh you know this
[30:14] is this is just a a a blind or a veil
[30:18] amen but we need to we need to look past
[30:21] that Veil and recognize God in our
[30:23] brothers and sisters and respect them
[30:26] equally respect him as
[30:30] God because you brought forth the seed
[30:32] of your kind if you came from God you
[30:34] are
[30:35] God the only Christ that's on this Earth
[30:38] the only anointed ones that are on this
[30:40] Earth is the bride of
[30:42] Christ or the family of God are the only
[30:45] ones that are
[30:47] here you know that the the coming of
[30:49] Christ is in two different stages you
[30:51] know you know we we know he's coming
[30:53] back in an actual Rapture and body and
[30:55] take us with him but he's already come
[30:58] amen and spirit form and the baptism of
[31:00] the Holy Ghost it's equally
[31:04] powerful the only difference in the
[31:06] comings is he's actually going to take
[31:08] us away in the other coming he's going
[31:10] to change our bodies but our bodies are
[31:12] in a process of changing so when our new
[31:14] body
[31:16] comes it'll be accepted that's right you
[31:19] know if let's look over in Ephesians
[31:23] 5 and uh 15 and then we're going to skip
[31:26] a verse and go to 172 21 and and just
[31:29] just looking at Unity this morning and
[31:32] looking at our year end message and
[31:34] where God took us to and and where God
[31:37] will bring us amen and and and how God
[31:40] commanded blessings even life ever more
[31:43] that's eternal
[31:45] life that that's not just this Earthly
[31:47] life this Earthly life is but a but a
[31:50] fainting flame it'll fade away like a
[31:52] plant that comes up and it's dead now
[31:54] it's already this life is already passed
[31:56] for the season of the past
[32:01] summer but your life is forever ever
[32:05] more eternal
[32:07] life is only for those that came from
[32:09] God are only for those that brought
[32:12] forth their
[32:13] seed of their kind and see here in
[32:16] Ephesians
[32:19] 5:15 says see then that you walk
[32:23] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[32:26] now I want to look at that word
[32:28] circumspectly now if you're a lot
[32:30] smarter than me you might know the
[32:31] meaning of that but I never and that
[32:33] word means
[32:35] carefully watching every
[32:40] step
[32:42] avoiding
[32:44] unnecessary
[32:46] risk so let's let's reread that you see
[32:50] that you walk
[32:52] carefully not as
[32:55] fools but as wise and then we drop to
[32:57] verse 17 here here these are God's
[33:00] Commandments to us here Paul's writing
[33:02] this here he said therefore be not
[33:06] unwise but he just said
[33:09] that but he really wants us to get the
[33:11] meaning of this be not unwise but have
[33:15] understanding what is the will of the
[33:18] lord well the will of the Lord number
[33:20] one is for you to have perfect love
[33:22] agape love and and and I was reading and
[33:24] studying brother Bram gave a quote and
[33:28] and I I just I don't even think I put it
[33:30] down CU I read so many of them and this
[33:34] was amazing but he was talking to his
[33:36] second wife and she was asking him a
[33:39] question about who his wife would be in
[33:41] heaven because he had was hopeing
[33:46] media and she said media was saying she
[33:50] said I don't believe I would be jealous
[33:52] of hope you know she loves you too
[33:55] they're compare he she's trying to
[33:56] figure out what eternal life will be
[34:01] like and we know that uh we'll be
[34:05] together in heaven but it'll be like
[34:06] brothers and sisters and there'll be no
[34:09] sex glans there and it'll be much
[34:10] different almost beyond our
[34:12] comprehension but here brother Bram said
[34:14] he said you know media if I went up
[34:20] town I I don't I didn't even have this
[34:22] share I don't know why I'm sharing this
[34:24] but he said if I went up town and there
[34:25] was a prostitute and I hugged
[34:28] her and said I love you would that hurt
[34:32] you she said oh yeah I think that
[34:35] actually would that would affect
[34:38] me and she said he said this is your
[34:42] prophet he said now what if Jesus was
[34:45] here and he walked down the same street
[34:47] of our town and he hugged that
[34:50] prostitute and he said I love
[34:52] you she said oh I would really like that
[34:56] and he said now sister that's the
[34:57] difference of agapy love and F Your
[35:01] Love you're so caught up in your Earthly
[35:04] fleshly
[35:06] love that we can't have
[35:09] Unity because I like a gray car and I'm
[35:12] driving a white car and I hate it cuz it
[35:14] gets dirty you know you know what I mean
[35:16] that's that fio
[35:18] stuff but if we get to the agape love
[35:21] where we can look at our brothers and
[35:23] sisters and say hey you're my brother
[35:25] you're my sister because I see the
[35:28] attributes of your F my father in
[35:32] [Music]
[35:35] you real agape love I'm not talking
[35:39] about
[35:40] Sin amen I'm talking about God's love
[35:44] amen so verse 17 he said therefore be
[35:47] not ye
[35:48] unwise but understanding to know the
[35:51] will of the Lord is and there in verse
[35:54] 18 and be not drunken with wine
[35:58] where there's
[36:00] access but be filled with the spirit now
[36:03] we're going to read some quotes where
[36:04] the Prophet talked about this wine we
[36:08] should be
[36:09] drunk we should be Stone
[36:13] drunk with the Holy
[36:16] Spirit we should be so drunk with the
[36:18] holy spirit that they think we're drunk
[36:21] in the world that's how the new church
[36:23] was and they walked out and Peter said
[36:25] those amazing words he said this is but
[36:27] the third hour of the day he said this
[36:29] ain't new
[36:30] wine but this is that what Joel talked
[36:34] about that the spirit of God would come
[36:36] down on his family on his
[36:40] children and they would be so peculiar
[36:43] they would look so different outside of
[36:45] the
[36:46] veil that they would they would
[36:49] literally be
[36:52] drunk I I would never want to miss a
[36:54] service where anybody got drunk in the
[36:57] spirit
[36:58] ever and I would welcome it without out
[37:01] stretch arms and
[37:04] legs it is the most it's it's something
[37:07] that we don't deserve but it's worth all
[37:10] the golden 10 million
[37:13] worlds amen you know the world says that
[37:16] you'll get to a point that they're not
[37:19] worthy of your
[37:22] presence that's not in an arrogant way
[37:25] but it's just showing how this how God's
[37:29] expecting us to come up in our agape
[37:32] love and and our our unity and
[37:35] understanding and and take all that he
[37:37] has amen amen and just just just one
[37:42] more time mentioning the statue no God
[37:44] don't expect you to stay on the bottom
[37:46] of that
[37:49] statue we must climb it we must climb it
[37:53] amen I got to I got to leave that alone
[37:55] or I'm going to have a double sermon
[37:57] amen God help us here in verse 20 it
[38:01] says or 19 seeking
[38:04] yourselves speaking to yourselves in
[38:07] Psalms and hymns and spiritual Psalms
[38:10] and singing and making Melodies in your
[38:12] heart to the Lord that's the only way
[38:15] that we can worship and pay back to God
[38:17] and show it's actually one way that
[38:19] you'll show who you are it's one way to
[38:23] show whose family you're a part of it's
[38:25] one way to show that you're drunk
[38:29] Amen in the spirit giving thanks always
[38:33] to God for all
[38:35] things and God and the father in our
[38:38] name the Lord Jesus Christ and
[38:40] submitting yourself this is what I
[38:42] wanted this is actually the thought that
[38:44] came to me was this verse submitting
[38:49] yourselves one to the
[38:51] other in the fear of
[38:55] God you know we always like like if you
[38:58] know I mean this goes on it talks about
[39:00] marriage and it talks about wife
[39:02] submitting to your husbands but before
[39:04] God even puts that
[39:06] down we all
[39:10] submit it it's not about wives and Men
[39:13] we're not on an ego trip here let's
[39:14] let's let's deal with the first ego
[39:17] first we're submitting to each
[39:20] other that's
[39:24] right and if we submit to each other in
[39:26] the fear of God
[39:28] we'll help each other and we'll be in
[39:30] unity that's why you'll have specials in
[39:32] the church that's why you'll have
[39:34] musicians in the church that's why
[39:36] you'll have people playing the
[39:37] tambourine and clapping their hands CU
[39:39] you're submitting you're submitting to
[39:41] each other but when you do that you're
[39:42] actually submitting to the
[39:44] Jehovah it's not about me you're not
[39:46] you're not coming here about me it's
[39:47] about
[39:48] Jehovah you submit yourself to one
[39:51] another amen you you you do this All In
[39:54] Worship that's why it's not about one
[39:56] Minister it's now never be a oneman
[39:58] minister ministry
[40:00] again that's why when we were gone
[40:03] brother Mt and brother Carson and the
[40:05] brother that came and visited we're
[40:07] submitting ourselves to for God to use
[40:09] us it don't matter if we're vacuuming
[40:12] the church or cooking a great meal or
[40:14] that somebody's going to cook me pumpkin
[40:15] pie
[40:17] someday that's submitting ourselves to
[40:19] the desires that came from the
[40:23] creation of the family of God
[40:27] if we do that verse we'll have all our
[40:30] problems taken care
[40:32] of when you submit yourself to each
[40:35] other in the fear of the Lord you know I
[40:39] I this comes to me in a funny way and
[40:41] and this is hilarious but you know when
[40:43] I was young and foolish and I was doing
[40:45] a lot and and this actually came to me
[40:48] when I was studying this and that was
[40:50] the verse that I started this whole
[40:51] message from submitting
[40:54] ourselves together in the fear of God
[40:57] excuse
[40:58] me you know I was in the fast lane when
[41:03] I was small and and you know like the
[41:05] 401 the vehicle that goes flying by you
[41:10] and that's the way I was living my life
[41:12] and and
[41:14] uh God has a purpose for
[41:18] everything but you know sometimes I
[41:20] would ask my wife to do
[41:22] something now you think of this and it
[41:25] wouldn't get done and I would go back to
[41:28] her and I think what happened and she
[41:31] said well you never even made the
[41:36] provisions like go to town but I don't
[41:39] have a vehicle to
[41:42] leave you know pay this bill and she
[41:46] said well I would gladly pay it but
[41:48] there ain't nothing in the
[41:52] bank but this is not a problem that we
[41:55] have in the the spiritual Realm
[41:57] God will never tell you to reach out for
[41:59] more of him and accept everything that
[42:02] he has for us and there not be nothing
[42:04] there to reach
[42:06] for that's right we want the fruits of
[42:08] the spirit we want everything in our
[42:10] midst and that's all a part of God
[42:13] you're not going to reach out for
[42:14] healing and not be there that's
[42:17] impossible you're not going to reach out
[42:19] for him to provide your needs and then
[42:21] not be there I I wish I could tell you I
[42:23] I read an amazing quote I sent it to a
[42:25] pastor in yuganda or uh in El Salvador
[42:28] this week but it was another promise
[42:30] talking about you know and and I
[42:32] mentioned this and one of the parents
[42:34] was ecstatic how job got his own
[42:37] children back and here and and it's on
[42:39] my phone I don't even have it here this
[42:41] is just fresh but it was an amazing
[42:43] scripture where God said when the Holy
[42:45] Spirit comes on
[42:46] you and he saves you he says it three or
[42:50] four times he said he saves your whole
[42:53] household amen than saves your whole
[42:56] household your whole brother
[42:57] or it's it's mentioned two or three
[42:59] different ways and I and I I just
[43:01] stumbled on the quote and I said I've
[43:03] never seen it that
[43:07] way because every seed will bring force
[43:10] of its kind
[43:12] amen and of course we're not preaching
[43:14] on that but that's part of submitting
[43:16] yourselves one to another see job he
[43:19] submitted himself under God when he gave
[43:22] a sacrifice for his kids their salvation
[43:26] wasn't even his
[43:28] it was his prayer and
[43:31] sacrifice that per se the kids could do
[43:34] something
[43:36] wrong but we can do the same thing in
[43:39] the family of God in this
[43:41] church you can put a sacrifice over your
[43:43] brothers and sisters and even your
[43:45] pastor if you would be so blessed to do
[43:47] that that if something a mistake come up
[43:51] that God couldn't see it because of the
[43:53] blood of the
[43:55] sacrifice that's called in yourselves
[43:59] together to each
[44:01] other
[44:04] amen God help us here brother Brown
[44:07] talks about this you know in the message
[44:10] Hub you can take the exact verse there
[44:12] and he said submitting yourself in the
[44:14] fear of God he said submit yourself
[44:17] congregation submit yourself to your
[44:20] pastor but he don't stop there he said
[44:24] pastor submit yourself to the
[44:26] congregation
[44:29] he said and if there's little uh clicks
[44:32] or raise up don't take either side but
[44:34] you're submit yourself to the whole
[44:37] congregation it's not about a
[44:39] congregation it's about a
[44:41] family submit yourself to each
[44:44] other you don't have to be afraid that
[44:46] God won't have nothing in the bank for
[44:48] you to hold you you see like the song We
[44:50] sang the new song it's God that's
[44:52] holding you see no man comes to the
[44:55] father but first he draws them that
[44:57] makes your faith actually given by God
[45:00] cuz Faith is the Bel no man can please
[45:02] God except to have faith that's belief
[45:05] but you couldn't even believe unless God
[45:07] first gave it to you to draw you to
[45:13] you sometimes we think oh well you know
[45:15] I'm
[45:17] just
[45:20] amen God help
[45:23] us see you submit each other to your
[45:27] yourself we submit to each other in the
[45:29] fear of God because we're equally
[45:33] created by
[45:35] God that's right do you
[45:39] know we're not different ages in God's
[45:44] thoughts we came in different Church
[45:47] ages but in God's thought you were all
[45:50] created at the same
[45:51] moment let us make you in our image M
[45:56] and female period we all got the exact
[45:59] same
[46:00] birthday imagine when January 26 comes
[46:03] we're going to throw a real party cuz
[46:06] that's when well you were all oh that's
[46:09] the see that's the
[46:13] veil see the
[46:17] difference and so in our Veil we all
[46:19] have likes and dislikes and differences
[46:21] but to God we're exactly the same
[46:24] exactly the same
[46:29] it was either he drew you to himself or
[46:32] you never came from him
[46:35] period that's none of our business now
[46:38] we see the same scripture we carry on in
[46:40] James 5:116 and this is a beautiful
[46:42] thought and i' I've actually preached on
[46:44] this way back in the house and though
[46:46] this is we don't want to confuse this
[46:48] this is not sins we don't have no
[46:51] mediator between us and the father you
[46:54] confess your sins directly to the Throne
[46:58] don't tell me your
[47:01] sins because I'm cursed with a
[47:04] memory and so are you you so we
[47:08] understand that so we're not a Catholic
[47:10] Church where we go to a pope but watch
[47:13] this confess your faults one to another
[47:16] that's submitting yourself in
[47:19] unity that's saying you know I eat too
[47:22] much I drive too
[47:24] fast I like to party every day I like to
[47:26] I have a lot of people around
[47:29] me those aren't
[47:32] sins those are just things that you're
[47:34] working through but that very scripture
[47:37] goes perfectly with submitting yourself
[47:40] one to another or confessing your faults
[47:43] one to another do you know those were
[47:45] different people that wrote that in the
[47:47] Bible Paul wrote Ephesians James write
[47:50] in his own
[47:52] book but see how it's exactly the same
[47:56] no not in words but in
[47:59] spirit the spirit is exactly the same
[48:02] because it was God that anointed
[48:04] them men of old confess your faults one
[48:07] to another and
[48:08] pray one to the other that ye
[48:15] may be
[48:19] healed I wonder if we see less
[48:23] healings because we're too proud
[48:27] yeah to say
[48:30] I I struggle with spending too much
[48:35] money I struggle
[48:41] with uh-huh pray one for another that ye
[48:45] may be healed and we've seen you know we
[48:47] mention healings you know and I I say
[48:49] this just just comes to me fresh you
[48:51] know I mentioned about a bunch of
[48:53] healings from Brother Carson and sister
[48:54] Sharon sister dma had a a beautiful
[48:57] scripture or healing and she' sent it
[48:59] brother Lauren and me were talking about
[49:01] it you know she went into they wanted to
[49:03] induce her so she wouldn't give birth
[49:05] during the holidays and we need to
[49:07] remember them in prayer her due date was
[49:09] Christmas I believe Christmas so she's
[49:12] overrun some anyway you went in you know
[49:14] how doctors they they can only study
[49:16] what they've learned in science and they
[49:18] said oh you know but they operate out of
[49:20] fear amen praise God we this is one
[49:22] thing this message don't operate out of
[49:24] it that's fear if if you ever feel fear
[49:27] in this place it's not of God cuz it's
[49:30] CU God has nothing there's no love in
[49:32] fear perfect love cast on all fear you
[49:36] know what fear is it it fear is the the
[49:41] substance that shows up when you when
[49:44] there's something lacking and you know
[49:46] what the lacking is
[49:49] God so you know I can get on any you
[49:52] know God Satan could never take you or
[49:55] me until God's completely done with you
[49:58] God knew it already exactly your plan
[50:00] when you're going to go either in the
[50:01] Rapture or by the way of the Grave to
[50:03] wake up and come and tell me that it's
[50:05] time for me to get a new body and we all
[50:07] go in the Rapture together cuz those
[50:08] that sleep or we that are alive will not
[50:11] hinder those that sleep so watch this he
[50:13] said if you say well I don't I'm afraid
[50:17] I'm a fearful I don't I don't think I'll
[50:19] go to Uganda CU I'm afraid
[50:22] to it's because something's
[50:25] lacking yeah
[50:30] basically you know what I they okay I'm
[50:33] I'm going to stretch out there but
[50:35] basically you could cross the street
[50:36] without
[50:42] looking if you were that so do to God if
[50:46] you were in a different
[50:48] dimension not no that's just you know
[50:52] serving God is just
[50:54] borderline it's just right on the
[50:59] defensive the world will look at you as
[51:03] Insanity so you know brother Bram said
[51:06] things he said anytime you were going to
[51:07] spread the gospel you're in the perfect
[51:09] will of God you couldn't be no safer
[51:11] anywhere in the world in the perfect
[51:13] will of God you could be in Machine Gun
[51:18] Territory if you're in the perfect will
[51:20] of
[51:21] God so watch this fear if fear is
[51:26] portrayed in a
[51:28] church or in a
[51:30] people it's because the absence of one
[51:38] thing aren't you glad you aren't sitting
[51:40] in a denominational church if you leave
[51:42] this church you're going to go to hell
[51:44] if you quit being a Baptist and you
[51:46] become a Catholic bless God we have the
[51:49] only
[51:54] oh don't ever listen to Fear
[51:57] Church don't ever don't ever listen to a
[52:00] fear sermon If You Preach you we we're
[52:03] not going to heaven because we fear
[52:05] hell brother Brown said if God sent me
[52:08] to hell I would deserve hell and I would
[52:10] still love him in
[52:12] hell cuz he's still
[52:15] God yes sir God help us you know this is
[52:19] kind of the end of the year and you
[52:20] reflect on things but confess your
[52:22] faults one to another hey if we all have
[52:26] a behind her s Israel were God's chosen
[52:29] people balam would have had no problem
[52:32] cursing
[52:33] them except God wouldn't allow
[52:37] it he'd start talking he would start
[52:39] saying oh you know that brother and God
[52:42] would just say he's a wonderful
[52:44] person B that's not what I was going to
[52:48] say you remember that preacher you
[52:52] know and God would
[52:54] just that's what he did to the prophet
[52:56] but
[52:59] Israel God help us Ephesians 5 and 26 27
[53:04] that's a little further down than what
[53:06] we
[53:07] read that he might sanctify us and
[53:11] cleanse Us by the washing of the water
[53:14] of the word you know you know what the
[53:15] prophet said that is he said that's the
[53:18] preaching of the
[53:19] word he said that's you digging into the
[53:21] word that's you feeding on the word even
[53:24] yourself it's a word that washes us
[53:29] clean that he might present you a to
[53:33] himself a glorious
[53:36] church that's actually a glorious family
[53:40] yes he didn't come to save the
[53:42] church he came to save the bright or his
[53:46] family he came to save the ones that
[53:48] came out of
[53:50] him not having spot or wrinkle or any
[53:53] such thing but that should be holy
[53:56] and without
[53:59] blames I believe we're coming to the
[54:01] part where we can forget all these
[54:04] little differences a little different
[54:07] fleshly things and and childly they're
[54:11] childless things brother Brown said that
[54:13] so most of the time it's just very
[54:15] childish
[54:17] things and we'll be members of his body
[54:20] verse 30 for we are members of his body
[54:23] and flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[54:24] bone remember how I said that every seed
[54:27] brings forth of its
[54:30] kind
[54:32] amen if you want to know if you came
[54:34] from God you'll have the attributes of
[54:37] God we're going to go into that next
[54:39] Sunday Lord willing and look at how
[54:42] powerful it is it's not just good enough
[54:44] I I want you this I had to stretch this
[54:46] one a bit and I had to study it but it's
[54:49] not good enough just to
[54:52] believe that's there's many people that
[54:56] will never be in heaven they say well I
[54:58] believe in the Lord I believe in
[55:00] Jesus many many many many many
[55:05] people but if we have his
[55:07] characteristics and his
[55:13] attributes
[55:15] we'll amen show them amen I I'm going to
[55:19] step out bounce here I'm struggling with
[55:22] this whole message but you know
[55:25] virtue the definition of virtue in the
[55:27] English language I have it in the Greek
[55:29] too but it's character and
[55:35] power so you will have God's character
[55:38] and God's
[55:40] power so if you don't have God's power
[55:43] and you don't have God's
[55:45] character well I'm happy you believe in
[55:48] them but that's not
[55:52] enough cuz Satan believes trembles
[55:57] so we look at here we we looked at our
[55:59] scripture about being uh drunk in the
[56:02] spirit and and uh here in
[56:04] Ephesians be not unwise and be not
[56:07] drunken with wine and and I I should
[56:09] have brought that verse down closer to
[56:11] my quotes but I I took some quotes off
[56:15] that here and I'd like to read some of
[56:18] these quotes here he said you
[56:20] know God's the bride the groom and the
[56:23] bride has come forth cuz it's a part of
[56:26] him and the only manifestation that will
[56:29] fulfill the revelation of the spoken
[56:32] bride is if it will manifest the same
[56:36] thing so see we'll manifest
[56:39] character and
[56:41] power amen and if the bride manifest
[56:46] something different than the groom then
[56:48] they didn't come from the
[56:49] groom then it isn't the bride cuz she's
[56:53] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[56:54] and life of his life and power of his
[56:57] power and she is
[56:59] him oh I love this man as a man and
[57:02] woman are one the woman is taken from
[57:04] the his side and she's taken the
[57:07] feminine Spirit from him now we know
[57:09] that from Genesis 1:27 was they were
[57:12] created one person masculine and
[57:14] feminine spirit and when he took Eve he
[57:17] only took the feminine Spirit but they
[57:19] were one first
[57:21] one it was not so from the
[57:24] beginning there were one
[57:26] body oh I want to show you something and
[57:29] and I'm flirting with by the message but
[57:31] I want to show you something you know
[57:32] there's three different
[57:34] manifestations where where Christ came
[57:37] as a
[57:40] man amen Genesis
[57:43] 1:27 he made us in the
[57:46] image
[57:49] man
[57:50] amen uh I just forgot the third one the
[57:55] there the third one
[57:56] uh oh boys forgive me Jesus the third
[58:01] one is the bride and he's the
[58:04] head the third one is he's the head of
[58:06] the body but we're the body oh the third
[58:08] one when John seing him thank you Jesus
[58:10] in Revelation 13 Revelations 1:13 I just
[58:14] had a brain priest when John looked at
[58:17] Christ he said it was like one like the
[58:20] son of man and the head was Jesus and
[58:24] the body had breast
[58:29] hello that was one body three times
[58:33] three times one
[58:36] body so Genesis
[58:39] 1:27 is he created the man male and
[58:42] female in a man Revelations 1:13 John
[58:47] looked at a man that was like a man and
[58:49] it was the man was a head but the but he
[58:51] had but the body had BR was a female and
[58:55] the Christ the bride church today if
[58:57] Christ ain't the head of this church
[58:59] we're dad's door
[59:01] Nails amen he's the boss he's the Holy
[59:04] Spirit and he's dirting I don't even
[59:06] know what I'm preaching but he's the one
[59:08] that's leading he's the brains he's the
[59:12] everything but the
[59:15] body three in
[59:18] one the trinity in one
[59:22] amen glory amen yes sir
[59:27] amen oh Hallelujah and the man and woman
[59:30] are one and the woman is taken theide
[59:31] the spirit the feminine Spirit of him
[59:34] and the flesh was from him and this was
[59:37] both mechanics and
[59:40] Dynamics the
[59:42] wife see when you become
[59:45] wife you can write
[59:48] checks that's
[59:50] right when somebody comes to your house
[59:52] and they're selling uh frozen shrimp at
[59:56] the garage and and salmon your wife
[59:58] knows that you don't want salmon but you
[1:00:00] want frozen
[1:00:02] shrimp she's not the head but she knows
[1:00:04] what the head wants she's in the same
[1:00:10] body I don't know if you're getting it
[1:00:13] and the spirit that's in him the spirit
[1:00:15] of him and the Flesh of him was put and
[1:00:18] put it together and it made the
[1:00:20] mechanics and
[1:00:21] Dynamics that's what we
[1:00:24] have you can't be you can't be you can't
[1:00:27] come from him you can't be bride and you
[1:00:29] can't be wife without having
[1:00:32] both and if you don't have both then
[1:00:35] you're just at the believing stage and
[1:00:38] Satan believes but he don't have
[1:00:41] nothing
[1:00:44] amen until the church comes to both
[1:00:47] Dynamics and
[1:00:50] mechanics it'll
[1:00:53] uh that'll move him to do the things
[1:00:56] that he did and if he hit if here he's
[1:00:59] talking about God he said the the
[1:01:01] prophet is saying this uniquely he said
[1:01:03] when God hit on all 16 cylinders that
[1:01:06] must have been a honking truck when God
[1:01:09] hit on all 16 cylinders so will the
[1:01:18] bride amen for he is in John 14:11 he
[1:01:23] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:01:25] shall he do do also and I give him
[1:01:27] charge of my D mechanics and Dynamics my
[1:01:32] I give him charge of my Dynamics and in
[1:01:35] his mechanics that the world will not be
[1:01:38] able
[1:01:39] to not be able
[1:01:42] to withstand it and I'll raise them up
[1:01:46] again in the last
[1:01:50] day he said he closes this quote out by
[1:01:53] saying he said that's the Easter message
[1:01:56] Dynamics and mechanics are
[1:01:59] together God don't separate
[1:02:02] them so if you got one you got if you
[1:02:05] came from God you got both CU God didn't
[1:02:07] separate
[1:02:08] them amen Matthew 2739 and 43 and it
[1:02:13] came to
[1:02:15] pass that they reviled him now I want to
[1:02:18] show you something I'm I'm showing you a
[1:02:20] mystery God's showing you a mystery it's
[1:02:22] not me I ain't showing you nothing I'm
[1:02:24] God shown you a mystery that if
[1:02:27] you're his bride and the groom had
[1:02:30] mechanics and
[1:02:33] Dynamics I started to tell you a story
[1:02:35] of sister dla did I finish that she went
[1:02:38] to the doctor and she had too much fluid
[1:02:40] around the baby and they the doctor said
[1:02:42] oh the umbilical CT it's going to move
[1:02:44] and we better induce you you better have
[1:02:45] the baby tomorrow tom being a very
[1:02:48] wonderful person and the bride of Christ
[1:02:50] she said let's just
[1:02:52] wait oh I love people like that
[1:02:56] and she went home and prayed she sent me
[1:02:58] a prayer request she went back the next
[1:03:00] week and the doctor that was inv was
[1:03:03] what do they call those baby doctors
[1:03:04] they
[1:03:06] uh whatever they are yeah you be G
[1:03:09] doctor something she whatever she did
[1:03:12] she see uh you know whatever they do to
[1:03:14] the women you know they read the baby
[1:03:16] and she
[1:03:17] said
[1:03:18] oh
[1:03:20] oh you're perfect you have exactly the
[1:03:25] Perfection she was above high she was
[1:03:28] too high she said you have the
[1:03:30] Perfection actually if it was anything
[1:03:32] it was at the lower level the perfect
[1:03:34] fluid and sister
[1:03:37] dma she was looking for a testimony she
[1:03:40] said have you ever seen this before
[1:03:42] doctor and she said no not in my 20
[1:03:45] years being a doctor I've
[1:03:47] never seen the move of God never seen
[1:03:51] the move of God but I did
[1:03:53] today and she ain't had that baby
[1:03:56] yet cuz she was
[1:03:59] perfect amen oh Hallelujah see if the
[1:04:03] groom did the mechanics and Dynamics so
[1:04:07] will the
[1:04:08] bride cuz they're a part of
[1:04:11] them where was I so in this mystery we
[1:04:13] see this that people misjudge no so we
[1:04:17] we believe in miracles I just told you
[1:04:20] two last Sunday and one this Sunday
[1:04:22] already
[1:04:23] amen those are miracles amen those are
[1:04:30] dynamics and I mean those are just the
[1:04:32] ones off the top of my
[1:04:34] head and the ones I know
[1:04:37] about but watch this in Matthew
[1:04:40] 39 Matthew 27 sorry 39 here they passed
[1:04:45] by Jesus and they reviled Jesus waging
[1:04:49] their heads they oh he don't have no
[1:04:53] Miracles he don't have no no character
[1:04:57] he don't have no
[1:05:01] power that's Matthew
[1:05:04] 2739 we need that up there Matthew
[1:05:08] 27:39 and saying unto Jesus that thou
[1:05:12] could destroy the that thou destroyest
[1:05:15] the temple and rebuild it in three days
[1:05:18] he said watch watch how they're tempting
[1:05:21] God save
[1:05:23] yourself if thou be if I I love that
[1:05:26] word if Satan's such a liar if thou be
[1:05:30] the Son of God then come down off the
[1:05:32] cross what they didn't realize was it
[1:05:35] took more Dynamics to keep them on the
[1:05:38] cross than it did to take them off the
[1:05:45] cross that's right they had a
[1:05:47] misunderstanding in their head of
[1:05:51] Dynamics because Jesus said in the
[1:05:54] scriptures he said I could call 10
[1:05:57] Legions of
[1:05:59] angels to destroy the world and set me
[1:06:03] free can you imagine that's like
[1:06:07] having that would be
[1:06:09] like try to comprehend
[1:06:12] that
[1:06:14] character that you have the power
[1:06:17] complete power complete
[1:06:21] decision to destroy the world and take
[1:06:25] those
[1:06:26] complete
[1:06:28] like that would be like my son going to
[1:06:30] a cattle sale with 5 million in his
[1:06:32] account and not buying
[1:06:34] cattle that's not
[1:06:38] possible actually even if it was 10,000
[1:06:42] in his account that's probably not
[1:06:46] possible oh see he took more power for
[1:06:50] him to refuse what he had it took more
[1:06:54] power for brother Brown to say I forgive
[1:06:56] you the young people that were making
[1:06:57] love on the front Pew took more power
[1:06:59] for him to forgive them when he really
[1:07:00] wanted to throw them out in the flesh
[1:07:06] hello that's right you want to see
[1:07:09] dynamics that was
[1:07:11] Dynamics you want to see Dynamics Christ
[1:07:14] staying on the cross for me a
[1:07:17] loser when I was ugly he still loved
[1:07:20] me that's that's Dynamics thank you
[1:07:24] jesuses and you're having trouble with
[1:07:26] somebody on the Pew with you oh my
[1:07:29] goodness watch this and that that's not
[1:07:32] all verse 41 same chapter and likewise
[1:07:35] also the chief priests mocking
[1:07:39] Jesus now now I just got one question
[1:07:41] for you did Jesus have the mechanics and
[1:07:44] the
[1:07:45] Dynamics did he do
[1:07:47] Dynamics did he do them
[1:07:50] repeatedly were they at the stop of his
[1:07:52] finger if he wanted them
[1:07:56] yeah nobody changed him to that
[1:07:59] cross but
[1:08:02] love mocking him with the scribes and
[1:08:06] elders and said he saves everybody else
[1:08:09] but himself he cannot
[1:08:13] save that was exactly the truth he did
[1:08:15] save me he saved all of
[1:08:19] us and in so doing he saved
[1:08:22] himself because unless a corn of week
[1:08:24] falls into the ground Abid Al loone but
[1:08:26] if it dies it'll bring forth
[1:08:33] much amen they they they just said that
[1:08:36] reverse they didn't even realize that
[1:08:38] they were quoting what God was doing he
[1:08:41] saved others but
[1:08:43] himself and saving the others he saves
[1:08:46] himself you know what that's the same
[1:08:48] for your brothers and sisters when you
[1:08:52] you don't think so you parents when you
[1:08:53] hold the token over your family you're
[1:08:56] actually saving them that's what job did
[1:08:58] well the Jailer when he said you believe
[1:09:00] for you and your
[1:09:02] household huh what are you doing he
[1:09:06] saved but himself you were extending out
[1:09:10] the yeah the
[1:09:13] token brother B said this he said if you
[1:09:15] believe that you have if you have enough
[1:09:17] Faith to believe that God give you the
[1:09:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost you have
[1:09:20] enough Faith to claim it for your
[1:09:23] family amen
[1:09:26] wow I like those
[1:09:30] quotes they here they're mocking them
[1:09:32] saying he saved others but himself he
[1:09:35] could not save in Saving the others he
[1:09:38] saved himself cuz we are
[1:09:42] him but they didn't know
[1:09:46] that and if he be king of the Israel let
[1:09:48] him come down off the cross and we'll
[1:09:50] believe him see there was the lie if you
[1:09:54] do something for me I'll believe believe
[1:09:55] you
[1:09:58] yeah that's like a false prophet or a
[1:10:00] false preacher if you give me a lot of
[1:10:02] money I'll I'll
[1:10:07] really
[1:10:09] liar you can be
[1:10:12] bought
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:20] hallelujah let's move on to another
[1:10:23] example of the Dynamics first
[1:10:25] Corinthians 2 7 8 10 and 12 and 14 or
[1:10:30] I'm skipping around on some verses I'll
[1:10:31] tell you when we get to them but 1
[1:10:33] Corinthians
[1:10:37] 2:7 but we speak the mystery of God the
[1:10:42] or sorry we speak of the wisdom of God
[1:10:44] in a mystery even the
[1:10:47] hidden wisdom see not everybody has
[1:10:51] it which God ordained before the
[1:10:54] foundation of the world on
[1:10:57] to our Glory not the world's Glory but
[1:11:02] to your glory verse eight of 1
[1:11:05] Corinthians 2 which none of the princes
[1:11:09] of the world
[1:11:11] knew for had they they would have not
[1:11:14] have crucified the
[1:11:16] Lord you see not everybody had the
[1:11:19] knowledge and wisdom of
[1:11:21] Christ that's how they could say well he
[1:11:24] saved everybody else but couldn't save
[1:11:25] himself they had no clue that when he
[1:11:27] saved everybody else he was saving
[1:11:30] himself that's
[1:11:32] right because we are sheep now the Bible
[1:11:36] says that we're bone of his bone flesh
[1:11:37] of his
[1:11:39] flesh that's pretty much remember the
[1:11:41] one
[1:11:42] body if he didn't save me then how could
[1:11:45] have he looked like in Ro Revelations
[1:11:47] 1:13 like a man what would have happened
[1:11:51] to the body the head wouldn't have been
[1:11:52] a lot of good without a body under it
[1:11:56] so in Saving you he saved
[1:11:59] himself he would have been like a
[1:12:01] beheaded
[1:12:04] chicken Hallelujah see but they didn't
[1:12:08] understand is is that the
[1:12:11] Dynamics The Mystery of the Hidden
[1:12:14] wisdom that God ordained before the
[1:12:15] foundation of Lord be For Your Glory for
[1:12:18] our Glory which is PR princes of this
[1:12:21] world knew
[1:12:23] not not none of them knew had they known
[1:12:26] it they would have not had crucified him
[1:12:28] verse 10 for God has revealed them unto
[1:12:32] us by his holy
[1:12:35] spirit that's to those that have the
[1:12:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the only
[1:12:40] ones that have the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost are those that came out of
[1:12:44] him that Holy Spirit is Christ
[1:12:47] spirit and for the spirit that searches
[1:12:50] all things yay the Deep things
[1:12:55] of
[1:12:57] God verse
[1:12:59] 12 and we have received not the spirit
[1:13:03] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:13:06] god now the bi the verse right prior
[1:13:09] that said those were the Deep
[1:13:11] things but we have received the spirit
[1:13:14] which is of god that we might know the
[1:13:16] things what wait a minute that but they
[1:13:18] said right just a couple verses over
[1:13:21] they said it was
[1:13:23] hidden but it wasn't hidden it see it's
[1:13:26] hidden but it it but two verses down
[1:13:29] lower it says we'll know but it is
[1:13:32] hidden but we'll know but it's not
[1:13:34] hidden from
[1:13:36] you that you might know the things that
[1:13:38] are freely given to us of God verse 13
[1:13:42] which also which things also we speak
[1:13:46] not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches
[1:13:49] see I can't give you Revelation nobody
[1:13:51] can give you
[1:13:53] Revelation but what the the Holy Spirit
[1:13:57] teaches compare comparing the spiritual
[1:14:00] things with the
[1:14:02] spiritual see the mystery and all the
[1:14:06] people that nailed Jesus on the cross
[1:14:08] they never understood they never
[1:14:10] understood the Dynamics of his plan or
[1:14:15] they would have never done it but it was
[1:14:17] hid from them because they weren't part
[1:14:19] of
[1:14:20] him
[1:14:23] Hallelujah and but and verse 14 but the
[1:14:27] natural man receiveth not the
[1:14:31] things of the
[1:14:33] spirit of
[1:14:36] God brother baham said this multiple
[1:14:39] times and I know the Bible says that
[1:14:40] study to show yourself appr proof he
[1:14:42] said you can't study yourself into the
[1:14:44] spirit of God you can't educate yourself
[1:14:47] into the spirit of God Peter could not
[1:14:49] have been educated he could have went to
[1:14:51] all the cemeteries in the world and he
[1:14:53] would have never knew that he was the
[1:14:54] Christ
[1:14:56] because the Sadducees and Pharisees they
[1:14:57] had went to all the cemeteries in the
[1:14:59] world and they could push the needle
[1:15:01] through the Scribe tell you ever lited
[1:15:03] hit but when Christ came in his deity
[1:15:06] they didn't even know who he was they
[1:15:08] were as blind as
[1:15:12] bats
[1:15:16] amen what verse was I on but the natural
[1:15:20] man canot receive these
[1:15:22] things of the spirit of God for they are
[1:15:26] foolishness unto them neither can he
[1:15:29] know them because they are
[1:15:32] spiritually watch this you need to see
[1:15:34] this verse 14 the end of spirit the end
[1:15:37] of 14 for they are spiritually you see
[1:15:41] that last two
[1:15:43] words
[1:15:46] discerned
[1:15:48] spiritually
[1:15:50] discern I can just show you the
[1:15:52] scripture and I can point you in the
[1:15:55] right point you to Christ but it's
[1:15:56] Christ that will
[1:15:58] spiritually and all that came from him
[1:16:01] will spiritually
[1:16:03] discern and those that won't they'll say
[1:16:06] well why didn't he come down off the
[1:16:07] cross he could have built up his kingdom
[1:16:08] here and Peter could have been on one
[1:16:10] side and James on the other he would
[1:16:12] have delivered the children of Israel
[1:16:14] under the the the the the reign of Rome
[1:16:17] wouldn't have that been great maybe we
[1:16:19] wouldn't be under a Roman Dominion
[1:16:23] now but he said this world is not my
[1:16:28] kingdom or I'd fight for
[1:16:31] it but the kingdom that was his he
[1:16:34] fought for that's why he stayed on the
[1:16:37] cross cuz in Saving you he saved himself
[1:16:41] because you were in the same body the
[1:16:43] same
[1:16:46] body oh I love that I that's just crazy
[1:16:50] good you were in the same body as him
[1:16:53] Hallelujah John 6 moving on another
[1:16:55] scripture
[1:16:58] here John 639- 44 and this is the
[1:17:02] Father's will which has sent me that all
[1:17:05] which he has given me I shall lose
[1:17:07] nothing but I shall raise them up in the
[1:17:10] last days now that's also in our
[1:17:12] Ephesian scriptures the first one we
[1:17:14] raised and I got to get to my quotes
[1:17:17] here we're coming we're coming to my
[1:17:18] quotes and this is the will of him that
[1:17:21] sent me that everyone that seeth the son
[1:17:24] and believeth on him have everlasting
[1:17:27] life and I will raise them up in the
[1:17:29] last days and the Jews murmured at him
[1:17:33] because he said I am the bread of life
[1:17:35] that come down out of
[1:17:36] heaven and they said is this not oh
[1:17:41] there you go see they're having trouble
[1:17:42] with that Badger skin they're having
[1:17:44] trouble with that Veil they're having
[1:17:47] trouble with the person that like
[1:17:48] pumpkin
[1:17:49] pie they said is this not Jesus the son
[1:17:52] of Joseph whose father and mother we
[1:17:56] know oh that's why a prophet's not well
[1:18:00] received in his own land because you
[1:18:01] know his
[1:18:04] history how is it then that he saith I
[1:18:08] came down from heaven see they didn't
[1:18:10] understand the supernatural the
[1:18:11] spiritually discerned they never
[1:18:13] understood none of that at
[1:18:15] all and no man can come unto me except
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:20] Father which has sent me draw him and I
[1:18:23] will raise him up in the last there's
[1:18:25] the faith that God it's your faith when
[1:18:28] you get it but God gave it to
[1:18:30] you or you'd never believe on him amen
[1:18:35] now I got a couple a couple
[1:18:39] uh couple
[1:18:41] quotes and we'll
[1:18:43] close I do have another scripture but I
[1:18:46] think we'll say goodbye to
[1:18:50] that here this is an early quote of the
[1:18:53] prophet he said on the day of Pentecost
[1:18:55] they were on one Accord in one place and
[1:18:58] suddenly a sound from heaven and and man
[1:19:01] had nothing to do with it like a rushing
[1:19:03] Mighty Wind and it filled the house
[1:19:06] where they were sitting and the power of
[1:19:08] God struck upon them and they went out
[1:19:11] into the street acting like a bunch of
[1:19:14] Maniacs like they they did down there
[1:19:18] when they came out through the Red Sea
[1:19:19] right they were screaming and carrying
[1:19:21] on and staming and stammering with their
[1:19:24] lips and they were beating on the
[1:19:28] tambourines said such a carrying on till
[1:19:31] the people identified them and stood
[1:19:33] back and said these people are
[1:19:35] drunk remember our first of scriptures
[1:19:38] Ephesians said be not drunk with strong
[1:19:40] drink but be in the spirit watch this it
[1:19:43] was spiritually drunk he said Hallelujah
[1:19:46] I'm going to call me you're going to
[1:19:48] call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you
[1:19:50] might as well start now all right he
[1:19:52] said look
[1:19:54] they were full of new wine he said that
[1:19:58] oh and I I just love that presence I
[1:20:04] mean but you know how he started that
[1:20:06] out he said man had nothing to do with
[1:20:10] it let me see man had nothing to do with
[1:20:13] it the power the the they were all on
[1:20:15] one Accord and suddenly a sound from
[1:20:18] Heaven come down and man had nothing to
[1:20:20] do with it not this
[1:20:23] man if it if this man had anything to do
[1:20:26] with it it was just praying and
[1:20:27] surrendering getting out of the way not
[1:20:30] I I I'm not my own self I'm not the boss
[1:20:33] you're the boss whatever Grace wants to
[1:20:35] do we want it we want more healings in
[1:20:38] our midst we want everything that he's
[1:20:40] got but we have to get out of the way
[1:20:42] for him to do it it's not us that
[1:20:44] decides brother Braham said himself he
[1:20:46] said if I could hear you I'd hear you
[1:20:47] right now but it I'm waiting on I'm
[1:20:50] waiting
[1:20:50] on the head
[1:20:55] he said look they were full of new wine
[1:20:57] that's right the wine that comes from
[1:20:59] God out of heaven and did you ever see a
[1:21:01] drunk man now there's a reason I'm
[1:21:03] reading this scripture he said he is
[1:21:07] just in love with
[1:21:10] everyone uhoh see now I know if you got
[1:21:13] the Holy Spirit you'll be drunk and then
[1:21:16] you'll be in
[1:21:18] love he said they're just drunk he said
[1:21:21] they're just in love with everybody you
[1:21:22] see he don't care he said that's the way
[1:21:25] a man is when he gets drunk on the
[1:21:27] spirit uh-oh the Bible says be careful
[1:21:30] not to drink or a strong drink with
[1:21:34] access but be drunk in the spirit he
[1:21:38] said the spirit of God makes you so
[1:21:40] drunk you forget who's your enemy you
[1:21:43] forget who you don't like you forget
[1:21:45] everything and everybody's in love with
[1:21:48] you he don't care about who's standing
[1:21:51] around you you're the biggest man in the
[1:21:54] country right then because you're
[1:21:58] drunk he says I don't care if your
[1:22:00] neighbor is sitting next to you and you
[1:22:03] want to and and he went to some
[1:22:08] uh fancy Church dignified sorry and and
[1:22:13] your name I couldn't read the word he
[1:22:15] went to some fancy dignified church he
[1:22:17] said just let the Holy Ghost get on you
[1:22:20] one time and see what takes place he
[1:22:22] said get right real good
[1:22:25] drunk he actually says sou drunk and and
[1:22:29] that word s means very or thoroughly
[1:22:33] drunk he said you might go to a
[1:22:35] dignified church but you just get
[1:22:36] thoroughly
[1:22:38] drunk and you'll see what takes place
[1:22:40] you'll say sister or
[1:22:43] brother you're in love with everyone I
[1:22:47] got just my last quote I
[1:22:51] promise see how he said if we're drunk
[1:22:53] in the spirit
[1:22:55] but if we have the spirit we should be
[1:22:57] drunk now he says something a little bit
[1:23:00] different and he said so when you're
[1:23:01] drunk you just love every you could care
[1:23:03] less you could care less if they like
[1:23:05] you or don't like you you still love
[1:23:06] them
[1:23:07] and and you act kind of
[1:23:10] foolish you ever see a drunk man not act
[1:23:12] foolish but if you're drunk spiritually
[1:23:15] you kind of act
[1:23:23] foolishly here's my last quote it's kind
[1:23:25] of a long one but he he hit something in
[1:23:29] a different way here he said when they
[1:23:31] cross over the Red Sea they had a great
[1:23:34] baked Pentecostal Jubilee a camp meeting
[1:23:40] why if it wasn't a Pentecostal meeting
[1:23:43] he said I've never seen one he said
[1:23:45] Moses sang in the spirit and miam they
[1:23:48] all beat it on tambourines danc in the
[1:23:51] spirit and if that ain't Pentecostal
[1:23:53] I've never seen one that's right he said
[1:23:55] God promised to supply all their needs
[1:23:57] for the journey and he promised us to
[1:23:59] supply all our needs for our journey so
[1:24:01] how could you not just be drunk and be
[1:24:03] happy and the same God the same God by
[1:24:07] the same promises the same God made the
[1:24:09] promises now next Sunday we're going to
[1:24:11] look into how do we get God's promises
[1:24:14] that's part of the satue of the perfect
[1:24:16] man and we find out that when they got
[1:24:18] out there little ways they didn't have
[1:24:19] no bread now God had already promised it
[1:24:21] to them and they had already been drunk
[1:24:23] in the spirit
[1:24:25] they didn't get out there and they
[1:24:26] didn't have bread and God rained bread
[1:24:27] down from heaven for them and they
[1:24:29] called it mana and when he went out and
[1:24:31] tasted it they said it was sweet and it
[1:24:33] was very beautiful type of the Holy
[1:24:35] Spirit our life it is a natural bread of
[1:24:38] men on their Journey but we got the
[1:24:40] spiritual bread watch this we got the
[1:24:43] spiritual bread for the spiritual man
[1:24:46] Journey
[1:24:47] here and now if you look and you never
[1:24:50] cease this long journey he said Moses
[1:24:52] told Aaron this is beautiful here he
[1:24:56] said now after this journey he said go
[1:24:58] and take some of that Heavenly Mana
[1:25:01] which is the type of the Holy Spirit and
[1:25:04] put it in the holies of holies for all
[1:25:07] the generations that's us typed us for
[1:25:10] all the generations to come that we
[1:25:12] could get some of the original one body
[1:25:16] it wasn't so from the beginning the
[1:25:17] original Mana was the first food the
[1:25:20] first holy spirit that ever fell we
[1:25:23] could taste some of that save it the
[1:25:24] holies are holies and they could get a
[1:25:26] mouthful of the original Mana that fell
[1:25:29] the first time the power of the Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost he said that's a beautiful type of
[1:25:33] the holy spirit that fell in the day of
[1:25:35] Pentecost when Peter said unto them this
[1:25:38] is that that Joel spoke of and often
[1:25:39] I've thought of
[1:25:42] this he said you'll notice that when
[1:25:44] they were eating the Mana they got drunk
[1:25:48] just as drunk as they could be and was
[1:25:50] stering around like a drunk man he said
[1:25:52] listen he said my C friend he said even
[1:25:55] Mary Virgin Mary that had Jesus had to
[1:25:59] be on the day of Pentecost to receive
[1:26:02] the Holy Spirit and he said you know the
[1:26:04] trouble today is the reason is we're so
[1:26:08] allergic to so many things we don't get
[1:26:12] watch this this is he goes a completely
[1:26:15] different way he said the reason we're
[1:26:17] so allergic to so many things the reason
[1:26:20] we don't have unity in our body in our
[1:26:23] groups the reason that we don't confess
[1:26:25] our faults one to
[1:26:27] another is because you don't get drunk
[1:26:31] enough you believe that he said now here
[1:26:34] he talks about now I'm going to
[1:26:35] paraphrase he talks about a man that was
[1:26:37] from the Salvation armies in England
[1:26:39] time and he missed his plane and he went
[1:26:42] for a walk and he walked with a cop and
[1:26:46] it was raining and there was an old
[1:26:48] drunk laying in the street and he was
[1:26:51] just as Stone drunk
[1:26:54] as could be I told you this quote was a
[1:26:57] little
[1:26:58] different this is all tied into the our
[1:27:01] first quote that we read scriptures
[1:27:03] Ephesians
[1:27:05] 5 and he said the cop and him called the
[1:27:08] the puddle wagon and they were going to
[1:27:11] put the drunk on the puddle wagon and
[1:27:13] brother brandham asked him he said what
[1:27:15] will you do with them and the cop said
[1:27:17] why will take him down and throw them
[1:27:21] throw him in the The Jug and he said
[1:27:24] well well that ain't going to take care
[1:27:25] of him and he said he don't need help I
[1:27:29] said well why the man will catch he said
[1:27:31] the man will catch
[1:27:33] amonia and he said I guess if you took
[1:27:35] them down to the Salvation Army and you
[1:27:38] put them on a little pad warmed them up
[1:27:39] give them some hot coffee and hot bath
[1:27:43] and all these things and here here's how
[1:27:45] brother Brown asked or this guy from
[1:27:47] England sorry it wasn't brother Brown
[1:27:49] he's telling the story this guy from The
[1:27:51] Salvation Army he says sir you can do
[1:27:54] that
[1:27:55] take him to the Salvation Army warm him
[1:27:57] up give him coffee give him a hot bath
[1:28:00] and all these things that sounds
[1:28:02] nice and he said you'll kill
[1:28:06] him and I
[1:28:10] said
[1:28:12] huh that sounded nice to me so
[1:28:16] far here's what the man said he said
[1:28:19] because you don't have the wisdom is
[1:28:22] hidden and it's not given to everyone
[1:28:25] but it's given to you he said you people
[1:28:27] don't understand he said that man is so
[1:28:32] drunk that every pore of his skin is
[1:28:35] filled with
[1:28:37] whiskey and they said he could never
[1:28:40] freeze to
[1:28:50] death he couldn't get cold he was Frozen
[1:28:54] to the curb his clothes were frozen to
[1:28:58] the curb but he said he was so drunk and
[1:29:00] he said the Bible says not to be drunk
[1:29:02] with strong drinks as access but be
[1:29:05] drunk in the spirit he said that's the
[1:29:07] matter
[1:29:08] today he said if you got so drunk till
[1:29:12] our own carcass would be so full of the
[1:29:15] Holy Spirit until nothing else could
[1:29:18] penetrate or Purge in any
[1:29:21] way our troubles
[1:29:24] would be
[1:29:26] over the trouble is that we don't get
[1:29:29] the good
[1:29:31] oldfashioned drunk Pentecostal Holy
[1:29:36] Ghost
[1:29:41] drunk you want to pamper them take them
[1:29:44] to the Salvation Army put them under a
[1:29:47] book of
[1:29:48] Creeds show them some kind of filal
[1:29:52] love give them some some
[1:29:56] coffee and you kill
[1:29:58] him but if he ever comes into the
[1:30:01] presence of Jehova and the baptism of
[1:30:03] the Holy Ghost and he acts like a
[1:30:06] radical
[1:30:08] drunk there nothing could come in there
[1:30:11] he'll have the
[1:30:13] mechanics and the
[1:30:15] Dynamics because he is he got so much of
[1:30:19] God that his outer body watch this like
[1:30:23] a drunk is not in
[1:30:26] control things that your body would
[1:30:28] control and you wouldn't drive into a
[1:30:30] tree and you will like this and you
[1:30:32] would walk up to your enemies and shake
[1:30:34] their hand give them a big hug you'll do
[1:30:36] if you're
[1:30:37] drunk and you'll do if you have the
[1:30:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost let's
[1:30:46] stand how pleasant and how beautiful it
[1:30:51] was when brethren
[1:30:54] dwell together in unity the only way you
[1:30:57] can dwell together in
[1:30:59] unity is if you get good and drunk from
[1:31:02] the Holy
[1:31:03] Spirit you're not you're not going to
[1:31:05] enjoy hanging around me in the
[1:31:07] flesh and many of us will enjoy hanging
[1:31:09] around each other in the flesh but if we
[1:31:12] all get drunk in the Holy Spirit we'll
[1:31:15] love each other's company because we'll
[1:31:18] be in the family in a different
[1:31:21] realm and it'll show show who's in
[1:31:27] control you know I me close with this
[1:31:31] sentence a drunk has no
[1:31:37] fear they driveing walls trees kill
[1:31:41] them they don't even know their dad the
[1:31:43] trucks roll over their head I know
[1:31:45] people from high school they have no
[1:31:48] fear because they're in a different
[1:31:51] realm but spiritually speaking when you
[1:31:53] get in when you get in Christ's realm
[1:31:56] you have no fear you're not fearful
[1:31:58] who's going to take over nobody can take
[1:32:00] over your kingdom your Kingdom's Christ
[1:32:02] Kingdom like if if you think if you
[1:32:05] think some person going to take over
[1:32:07] your body they'd have to take over God's
[1:32:10] body you have no fear and so you're not
[1:32:13] worried about well I don't care what
[1:32:15] they say they do this or that other
[1:32:17] that's and this body's completely out of
[1:32:20] control and you do things and say things
[1:32:24] that you don't even know you're saying
[1:32:25] brother Brown said that he said I have
[1:32:27] to relisten to the tape to know what I
[1:32:29] said when I said
[1:32:32] it cuz he was
[1:32:34] drunk amen God bless you this morning
[1:32:37] God bless you and happy New Year and we
[1:32:40] love you and we want all that Christ
[1:32:44] says for us to get us out of here and a
[1:32:46] body change and and enjoy our life while
[1:32:48] we're here together amen God bless you
