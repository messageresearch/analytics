morning thank you musicians and think you owe you too man it's just amazing to have iliard up here playing and backing up and you know I I can't do it amen amen we all had different gifts and those gifts were given by God for the worship in the body amen given from birth amen it wouldn't matter what you spent on me I couldn't play like that yeah amen just some things aren't possible amen we just uh just remember our prayer requests imagine just welcome and we're so happy to be here I pray that we'll have some spiritual stake first and then we're going to have some physical stake after and and these steak will be the best but the spiritual ones and just an honor to be here and and we sure love and appreciate you all you know just uh a few prayer requests that you can remember and your ways also it's Tim man you know how God the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord it you know we don't believe in perchance or flukes or Miss uh you know good luck or all that stuff is just of the double man we sometimes we slip and we say things that you know we don't even believe you know like good luck what's that mean good what amen but Tim just randomly thought that he needed a new pair of glasses and quit using Vicky's all the time and they wouldn't have to fight when they were sharing glasses and so when he went in he had two holes in his eyes and all this water can drain out of his eye and let the retina would separate and he would be still blind so they're doing surgery like literally when in Canada when they do surgery in six days it's an emergency but they're doing surgery on us by Thursday so of course we remember that and we don't believe we know for a fact it's not God's will that Tim would be blind in one eye it's just Satan trying to if he can't get the spiritual blind he'll try and take your physical sight it's just you don't have no teeth Tim he's just gumming you to death and just smack him in the nose and send them on his way amen it's it's just that simple I mean I don't I hate to be so plain but I mean it's just the way it is he'll try you spiritually you try you physically he'll try you different ways but you just recognize who he is and you say hi he's I seen you come at me last month and you know you can go back to where you're going to be amen amen and also we only remember and just because of the video I I God's helping me to not mention names because sometimes we have to eat what we say and uh but there's a there's a local Message Church in Ontario that that I love I love and uh they're having a hard time amen and I'm sorry and so we're just remembered them man just uh I'm sorry God made me that way I'd pay a million dollars if I didn't cry when I wanted to say something but that wouldn't fix nothing either so but uh they pay very high rent very very hybrid and they're getting kicked out because they make too much noise you know you know this world you know they're looking for something real amen and Satan is an imitator you know and so when they have rock and roll concerts and all this stuff and uh you know bootlegging that that's not you know nobody would complain but if you start worshiping God oh buddy yeah all hella break loose amen is a weight lifting class he said on Saturday night the Pastor said he said they'll they'll be you know what comes with weightlifting is girlfriends and beer and rock and roll and he said it is so loud in there but he said but when we come Sunday morning in worship so they already letting them out of their lease but you don't just pray that God God's got something good for him God's got got the best is yet to come you know they he's been ministering for 33 years I'm just going to say this and and nobody can say because you know we haven't mentioned any names but their rent for a tiny place and their utilities cost them three thousand a month he said when they take up all the ties and offerings he said on a regular basis we're a thousand dollars short he said me and my wife are working to pay a thousand dollars and preach for free yeah yeah and then you got other ministers that would preach in Hollywood TV and make a half a million a year it's not the same God guys it's just not the same God they just we have to recognize that there's two gods in this world and they're both religious we're going to preach on that this morning you know brother Emmanuel and we welcome your family and just just something to be a part of God's family and so brother Emmanuel came and we sat down the first thing I was talking about was three messages that I got on my iPad and you know this is uh the titles of them is seeing God's vision seeing God's vision an amateur creator and the unveiling of God's right arm I was just sit and talk to brother Emmanuel and he said he said that one message is exactly what I'm preaching next week amen amen it was like last weekend you know brother Joseph came and preached I could tell you and Luanne went to the restaurant I I have never I'd have never fellowshipped them with them in person we met and went out for supper Saturday night I never spoke a single word in what we'd preached in this church and he come in and you would have thought he was listening to the video preaching almost word for word and we never spoke a single word on it amen amen God so we serve an awesome God we really serve an awesome God so amen so anyway sorry for that uh but just remember these needs and brother Tim and the local church so they're looking for a place they're moving so the next six weeks the next six weeks back to the the service the next six weeks they can have no musical instruments and no uh Amplified mics they can only talk in a talk invoice with no Amplified mics and they're moving the end of August but they don't know where to so we pray that God would just uh hey man do just something Supernatural and when it comes we'll know it was God let's stand and read his word amen and I just encourage you moms and even Julie's out I promise you your kids don't bother me I'd rather them be sitting in here moving than where I couldn't see you amen it does doesn't affect me I'm not a minister that's affected by kids uh and uh maybe some are but this is not one amen I mean I'm sure I'm not going to get done today and I I uh I promise I'm not going to hurry because uh I believe God's got something for us to see and uh and I I told sister the man I said you know I I this topic will be misunderstood they'll be misunderstood and I and a minister knows that ahead of time and so it makes them nervous you know but uh but it's all right it's all right you know God was misunderstood Jesus was misunderstood and uh but we need to lay the chips down because we're going home soon and uh and uh you know uh well let's let's read a scripture you know amen Matthew 24 24. amen then we're going to read to Matthew we're going to go to Matthew 7. just one verse here for there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they would deceive be very elect amen and let's go to 28 verse 28. verse 28 of 24 but for wheresoever the carcasses there the Eagles will be gathered Hallelujah Hallelujah let's turn to Matthew 7 if you would just before you see to Matthew 7 and 15. we're going to read a few scriptures here 15 to 21. try to lay a foundation and like I said there's just you know I just a lot of stuff here and I want to read some things that our Prophet said and to lay a foundation beware of false prophets which come to you and sheep's clothing but inwardly they are raging wolves and he shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt fruit tree bringeth forth evil fruit Verse 18 and a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree bringeth forth not every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is chewed down and cast Into the Fire therefore by their fruits you shall know them not what they say don't listen to what the person says don't even listen to what I say I mean you can but watch their life the prophet said Don't Preach me a message live me one words are cheap character is hard therefore by the fruit she shall know them 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven Lord Jesus we ask you to bless this word and bless the speaker in the here Lord Jesus in your name we pray amen you may have your seats and maybe we'll turn to Matthew 5 and just lay more of a foundation here right away in Matthew 5 44 and 45 but I say unto you love your enemies and bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father now now there's there's the proof amen that you may be the children of your father which are in heaven for he maketh his son as you and the son to rise on evil and good and he sendeth the rain on the just and the unjust amen Our God's a fair God Our God's a fair God Hallelujah Hallelujah amen we want to look into these scriptures and we're going to dovetail it with the our Prophet this morning but I want to tell you something when you preach on this topic or when I preach on this topic for sure I will be considered a radical now you think that I will just be considered a radical I'm afraid I'll be considered a radical among you but you are considered a radical in this town you are considered a radical maybe in your family if they're not message believers and everybody's considered a radical if they came from God Christ Jesus was considered a radical radical you know the word of God and and just so many things you could say you know I'm happy to be a radical not rude not rude by radical yeah I'm happy to be radical and I'm praying that God will make me more radical not rude but more radical you know in God's Vision he always had a difference than the Christians thought in the Bible the Believers in the Bible always were outside of God's vision almost always show me one prophet in the Bible that was perfect even they missed the prophet the vision I'm going to show you prophets that that screamed at other prophets tell them to why'd they do that because it was God they never caught the vision Joseph was one when he brought his children to be blessed he screamed down and said no and it was God that did it and many times we're sitting in church and we say no don't do that God I don't like that I don't like that person I don't like that decision I don't like that gift I don't want to go to that place I don't like that building I don't like I don't like what you're doing God I don't like my family I don't like my pastor I don't like I don't like the message I don't like it amen why it's because they're never seen God's vision God's Vision you ain't never going to go to Bible study Bible School Cemetery and understand God's vision man you ain't never going to understand and you can Minister your whole life and maybe not fully understand it and it's only by Amazing Grace and by an amazing Revelation the Flesh and Blood there is no fivefold Ministry that's going to get you to understand God's vision they could preach still they didn't have a voice they could be the most amazing top ten in the world but it'll be revelation and Amazing Grace there'll be Revelation and amazing neighbors that's why in message churches people are walking out after sitting in them for 40 years did they have good ministers preach them oh buddy no revelation amen and we're living in a world today this is where we are so radical if somebody just looks at me I just I don't like you I just I I don't I mean I hope that's not everybody it's because we're living in a world that's very tolerable oh oh I understand you had a hard life praise God a hard life you don't even know what heart is that amazes me in my very small brain that you know suicide in North America and the UK is like at raging Heights and you go to the poorest countries in the world where they have less than nothing and the zoo right suicide rate is almost zero when you get that one figured out let's talk you don't even know what hardship is our world is very tolerant and they're teaching it well they're not teaching your kids because we're converted but if your kids are in school they're teaching them to be tolerant understand every situation but God didn't understand every situation he only understood his word he understood one thing and that was his word and everything outside of that was the devil and we're looking at message people I can tell this is this is we're not going nowhere this morning this is going to be a while but we're looking at message churches you know I went to Message Church with somebody for years some of you sitting here this morning went to church with her for 20 years and I seen her online yesterday and she was at a gay pride parade yep kids painting on the tombstone are all painted up love brother Matt love oh you hurt my feelings bless God that's exactly what I did sister I was just like how in the world I'll tell you how in the world well number one it's called Satan but number one the prophet said that we've let down the bars and the goats have got in and in one place he said they ate all the Sheep food and the other places said the Sheep got out in multiple places he said we're trying to bring Hollywood into here if you're looking for a good preacher you get rid of me and if you're looking for a new building well I mean I don't know we've got to get Tim's iFix and then we'll make it look pretty or something what's that got to do with God God used a donkey to talk to a prophet the donkey was Stone bride and if it hadn't been for the donkey God would have killed the prophet maybe we need to listen to vote a donkey and see we have a we have a thought of God and God goes outside our box and we well we just write God off well you know inside my box you know we're only going to make it if we're came from God it'll be election you'll have to accept the election but only by election let me read you a quote to lay a foundation there's so many I was I put so many down brother Emmanuel and then we'll see I was typing in my iPad this morning and I came to church and I was remembering more examples in the Bible when I was here not everything that's religious and confesses this message will be in heaven a million miles from it a million miles amen let me read you a quote to lay a foundation and I mean it's this quote I don't have up Vicky we're going to put some up on the screen this one I didn't add amen you know the only way we can accept God is to have come from God but another way to say it is the only way you can accept the word is actually be the word that's what Joseph said last Sunday it was the greatest phrase I've heard you can't just you can't say well that was good preaching oh praise God no no you actually are the word it's the only way you can accept the word amen you become the word man this world's just gone completely insane I I don't know where I'm going this morning but but God doesn't I've seen a thing on Disneyland I tell you what parents our kids are all grown but don't show your kids Disneyland Nursery Disney I've seen the video from the guy that's the head of Disneyland it's on my phone they have set up Council things where you can go in and the counselor you'd change your sex their whole goal in all the movies now is tolerance and you you probably are a cat or you know calf or a woman or something different man really careful not to pay our ties to Satan by supporting Satan's kingdom amen God will hold you responsible because you're a steward of God's money that's like if you go to Starbucks you're supporting Satan's kingdom don't do it that's radical but it's the truth it's radical see let me let me show you this he said Kane Kane was not a non-believer now the prophet says different things you know let me lay a foundation here real quick excuse me boys I'm trying to be careful on my voice or I'd be a lot more radical there's other places where the Prophet will say different things where King was a non-believer but in this quote he talks about how King and let's just go with this for a second here he said Cain was not a non-believer Cain was a Believer and he said oh May the Holy Spirit now question quite quiet in us and get our added our attentions back to Genesis and live in this picture Cain was not a non-believer and this is a long quote but we need to hear this amen Cain was a believer Cain was a message believer in a big Message Church in Canada Earth Saints and if a Believer is all that God requires Oh I thought oh bless God I know this message I've been I was born here and if a Believer is all God requires then God was unjust for condemning gain and accepting other believers oh how in the world amen Cain was not a communist Cain was not an infidel Cain was a religious message believer I added the message part and notice he came to worship God and not only was he a Believer but he was a worshiper he was one of these people amen not of a false cult but a worshiper of Jehovah God and our Prophet says let that soak in We Believe for far too long the people wearing the name tag message we're a brother and sister I know that's radical it might be less than church next Sunday but I'll still have God notice the worship prayer of God I've heard people say all you have to do is confess Jesus as the Son of God and be saved he said the devil's done the same thing and they're not saved you know that he said it takes more than that he said the devil said I know who you are the Son of God the Holy One of Israel wow he said Cain no he's repeating himself this is the same quote he said Cain was a Believer and acknowledged the Creator and not only that but he was a worshiper and now he goes in I'm going to skip some here he says I know he goes into the east side of the garden and uh he's talking about Cain and Abel and they were in the garden together work in the fields and he's and I just paraphrased some of that and he said now they were trying to worship God and Cain built himself an altar or a church and Abel built him one and Cain made a sacrifice and Abel made one and came down to worship and Abel did the same thing now if God only no this is a I'm reading word for word now if God only requires faith in God and a confession those are all good by the way we're going the right way but if God only requires faith in God and a confession and an altar and a church membership and a sacrifice and a membership of a loyal loyalty to a church and part of your money and your time in worship and your sincerity and that's all you believe then God was unjust do not accept Cain but I thought those were all good things I mean have faith have a confession I mean have a home Church believe the message man we're going the right way now this is where you're going to want to fight and shush in your seat belts you're going to want to fasten your seat belts because you know and I'm going to say this I'm saying this very blind I'm sorry you're here brother Emmanuel like a look out don't tell anybody but uh you know people will come and say you know you got to be balanced in the message what's that mean I'm not balanced I mean I got a bubble in the middle but when I lay down I don't lay flat balance the message what that means brother Matt is you know what it means compromise that's exactly what it means it means we can let a few things go now now I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you what the truth is that whether you believe it that's that that's entirely up to you and God but our prophet's quote book was the Bible and I believe for one second that every single word the prophet said was us saith the Lord or even correct but I do believe that thus saith the Lord is in the message and I believe that God sent the rev the the revealing of the Bible to that prophet and he revealed the 100 truth but whether he drove a Ford or a Chevy really means little to me or wore a big buck buckle and a cowboy hat oh are we still we're still somewhat together but there was things so so the prophet said this if you don't like this then you're not going to like the prophet and then I'm in good company so that's okay but the prophet said everything I say take back to the word and if when you do that now I'm not saying he was a word prophet if you can't even be saved without believing it okay well that's fairly radical but I'm saying the prophet had ah what's the right word ah like fleshly desires that had nothing to do with the word of God that is recorded you see what I mean like I'm trying to say this like like he wanted to live in the wilderness no God wouldn't let him you see what I mean like uh uh like many of the prophets ran out of God's will in the Bible when it got like famed it didn't rain and it was so somewhat together man but when people say when people say you got to be balanced on the message they're not meaning brother Matt that well uh they're not meaning that what we just described they're meaning we can compromise they're meaning like you know uh like there's I disagree on the prophet like he said you could cut your little girl's hair I don't believe you can no that's not a Halloween Health decision I'm just saying you see what I mean I'm not starting to cut my girls bangs because she's three because how am I going to explain to it when she's nine that she can't I'm just not going on those Waters hello if you do no problem but there's a lot of waters that have been muddy and it's turning into what I just said about people that some of you sitting here today went to church for for 20 years that's a fair amount of time and they're at the LGB 02 Cube taking their whole family and then he walked away you know the prophet preached against Christmas trees many churches many believe many ministers will have a message a Christmas tree in their charts and take pictures of their family in front of it and I'm just thinking uh why uh I'm like I mean we're not trying to grow the church in numbers praise God for that that's huge in the states I've had message Believers change charts and say praise God I feel a lot more brother Matt because I don't get preached against Christmas anymore so if you want to pick your pastor on somebody that don't tell you the church truth and lies to you change churches because I ain't getting up there and God Walk You by me and say you lied to them that ain't happening that ain't happening not not as long as I got a little sound mind up here that's not going to happen that's not going to happen I know you think well where in the world's he going well the prophet throws Us in here right on this quote he said Easter is coming up soon and this lovely city and across other nations they will spend tens of thousands of dollars to send Easter flowers All Around The Altar and brother that's pagan God never ever had an altar with Easter flowers on it that was of Cain and put it on there and it's coming to Easter and they don't even the world's gone even Easter now watch this I I have a backup plan you know there's words I'm reading on here Easter Christmas and everything else is just a great commercialization and it's nothing about God in it and what in the world's Easter got to do with a rabbit and a chicken and a yellow duck and something like that and yet we just Pagan and heathen we're just as Pagan as the heathens are and we're worse than they are in Africa and I'll tell you what or a lot worse oh about 10 million times because I've been to Africa and yeah watch this now here's where the punchline is nobody's run out yet and yet you put up with it you put up with it no that's an exact quote and yet you put up with it and he says God help us to shun these things and let the sunshine of God begin to bathe down and expose these things and let's walk in the light now I'll just tell you what there's about 50 percent of message churches and about 100 in the state that if you preach that you wouldn't have to worry about having a traveling Ministry you're a radical you're radical radical what's radical he talks about us putting on fancy clothes at Easter and all these things and spend the thousands of dollars and and uh and and letting people come in that are you know just pay a big money to the church so we can build a recreation room and that he said but there it is he said where did it come from he said we see it right here he said where did it come from it came from Genesis and it began with Cain he said look at here those things you want to give me attention now this is our Prophet saying he said now you want to give me your attention now he said Here Comes the two minds and they're coming up and they still exist in Wyoming not in well no sorry they still exist in Ontario today and he goes into the parable and he talks about the the sower of good seed and Bad Seed in that and receiving the gifts and and I'm just going to drop down here and he says uh he said both are going into the seating he said the world gets more wicked and the church gets more powerful amen and I don't mean all this is called church but he meant Born Again Believers not just members but the ones that got the spirit and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says now in paragraph 33 he said now notice these two Spirits was on those on those boys back in Genesis and now Cain was just as formal as Abel was if God only wants someone to be standing there and say well look at here Abel I'm going to be accepted to well why and see he said well I believe in God and King said I do too he said but I worship God he said well I do too he said but I get my offerings to God but he said I do too he said but I believe in God he said I do too he said but I offer God prayer and he said but I do too He suggests as formal as the other he said why is that cause he said it's God by election elected his church and he said they both grow together and I'm just jumping some paragraphs because we got to move on amen but in the last days he said let me it says it'll be so close to you communist is not Antichrist it's styling and he mentions all these people but Jesus said that the Antichrist would be so close to the real message believer I added the message believer that it would deceive the message people but it won't deceive the elect because it's not possible and the Antichrist religion the Antichrist is religious and and this is I'm moving over on this I'm going to go on he said the Antichrist is religious and he said let that soak in a minute he said the Antichrist is a Christian professing religion and Judith the head of it was a Believer added the number of the treasures in the church the brother of the same church and went in and out among them and he was the devil professing to believe a Believer and this is a last sentence on this quote he said Shake Yourself now for a minute he said May the Holy Spirit do it and Shake you back to your conscience wow tolerance let's be tolerant God wants us to be tolerant so our family will commit tolerance if we're going to be like them just join them amen Hallelujah we're To Be A peculiar people and we see this world as full even in the message full when you say with God's word you'll be radical amen and the make-believers and the unbelievers will never see it but the word can never deny the word amen the word can never Delight the word let's just read some and move on to this amen and uh just I'm sorry I just I I mean I believe God wants us to hear this amen we wrestle not against uh Ephesians 6 12. we'll lay a foundation we'll get into our first examples here we wrestle not and this wrestle means to take part in a fight or a hard struggle we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and principalities is a place against powers and against rulers of darkness in this world and against spiritual wickedness message wickedness in high places amen for the only way for us to recognize this and and realize the problem is to accept the truth message wickedness hello okay Vicky you can pull up our first quote see seed is not air with Chuck and we'll read it and then we'll get into some scriptures here did you ever see an eagle compromise no sir this is 65 uh no that's the wrong one sorry still the wrong one sorry well you can you can find it and I'll I'll just go on did you ever see an ego compromise no sir he said there's no compromising in him neither does a genuine Christian he ain't soft he'll hunt until he finds it amen yes sir and he'll find his meat and he wants his fresh manna I'm just jumping to read the highlights so it's time that for the Eagles in this day to get flying higher and to dig into God's promises and to live on the the literal food that's been killed for us to take and I'm just dropping down to paragraph 126. in the red there and no more he said watch this he said we have no more prayer meetings no more organized uh agonizing with God to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever and he said they've just they've just let it down and got denominational and they put their name in the book he said they got lazy and stuffed and maybe I didn't even put this one in there Vicky sorry he said maybe they got lazy and soft and he said they sat back and then they're gloating on some kind of dead carcass he said then they're supposed to be at least he said then they supposed to be at least a hawk he said that's similar to a brother to an eagle amen and they they sit on high for rotten caucus and man-made Theology and where does it get that he said you tell them that the days of Miracles is passing no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said all this is nonsense and you mean to tell me that that eagle would eat that kind of garbage he said he couldn't do it he said no sir and he said now he promised us a full Square meal a seven course meal in our day and he said the Seven Seals are open and everything's ready in God's word for us to receive it and he said so the church has lost their identity as lesser than a bird brother the eagle of God's prophets amen that's a 65 quote and the Sea does not air but the shock came in God help us God help us amen let's turn to Genesis 4 and we'll go into our first character here in in the the first quote should be uh Joseph meeting his brethren uh Vicky but Genesis 4 1 maybe we'll look at the scripture first and here we see in one and I just paraphrased this first verse here and Eve conceive and bear came and then verse 2 and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and Cain talked to Abel his brother I mean I'm trying to make this personal and we're going to go into there's there's like a dozen examples in the Bible and Cain talked to his brother and it came to pass it when they were in the field the king rose up against his brother and slew him in verse 9 and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I thy Brother's Keeper and then in verse 11 God said unto Cain he said and now Thou Art cursed amen and now though our curse God help us let's look at what the prophet says about that amen he said now you watch here along the uh this destruction here the how do you say that word honey uh long the lineage of man came down through the the sons of Canaan and they went to to we know that Cain were just fast forward here Cain was they were scientists and smart and intellectual and and you know marvelous men and they they tempered steel and Built Homes and did all these things but Abel's group were Wanderers Wanderers Kane's group they were working with copper and worked with metal and that and both these groups of 104 and both these groups were religious and Cain was religious as Abel was religious and God draw the line which was right Cain was just as religious as able and they both built altars they both believed in God I know I'm reading this double but it's a different quote and they both worship God and they both brought gifts now watch them two seeds one was always fighting the other sounds like a message one fighting the evil trying to destroy the righteous seed and he tried to destroy Abel and he did it but God raised up Seth and he took his place and he thought he had Jesus right there and then he slew the babies he thought he had Moses so he was always trying to kill God in the Believers he tried to kill the babies and kill Moses and he tried it every way he could to destroy this seed and when he killed Christ on Calvary here's Satan he said by God raise up the same an evil religious seed is persecuting the righteous lead today that's the bottom line if we got the right quote the evil religious seed is persecuting the righteous sea today he said you see it thousands though they all bless God they just see it come they they they're more balanced than the message no you're not balanced when you're attacking a believer that's not balanced that's evil amen you see it he said they're trying to destroy the righteous branch of God amen amen let's just go to another want to hear the next quote here the mark and we're going to drop the highlight of 21. now he said we find out that Cain listen to the enemy and he said what happened he said because he became the first murderer and he said he he became the first one to be jealous on Earth though this I want you to catch his part he said now tell me where the pure line up from God came from tell me how that pure that jealousy came out of the pure lineage of God well it never of course he said where did that murder come from he said where did it come he said where did that all that kind of Spirit come from out of Abraham never he was directly from God he's got a question mark with that he said it couldn't have he said it come from Satan in a message search that's what this was in the garden it was a message of that day in the garden he said that we came from Satan it's exactly where it came from and he said the next paragraph he said now that you find that he was the first murderer and he was the first one to have jealousy he said Lucifer got jealous of Christ Michael and brought right down to earth and was transferred into man where'd it come from see Lucifer wanted to be the head in heaven he wanted to take the worship for Michael Christ he wanted to be God and so then when he comes right down the fights right into message churches today this was a message Church in the Garden of Eden amen and Satan threw Cain taking on this evil took the first Mark and God marked them God Mark King amen God help us let's go to Romans 9 and 13. and we're going to look at this and this is this story is still taught of Jacob and Esau and this is the whole story is in Genesis 27 and just for a matter of time because I want to put some some Bible examples out there but it's election brothers and sisters and not everybody that says Lord Lord are going to be there not everybody that says Lord Lord to this message and I believe a prophet's going to be there they're not even your brother and sister they're on the devil their father's the devil Jesus was the first to say that and that's not wrong for us to say that recognize the spirit amen he said his written Romans 9 13 it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated now let's pull up the next quote and and I mean that's that whole story goes into Genesis 27. amen but let's just see what a prophet talks about this he said now as ever it now has now as ever it's being the same thing so is it today no I don't like that but it's still the truth but we're not recognizing it I don't think most people do amen it's not what the people are saying listen there's and I'm not preaching against I'm not trying to take over the states or something but it's not that you say you believe the word but are you living the word amen are you the word amen this message about being in the vision of God Amen we are God's right arm on Earth and and you know you could go into that being brother Emmanuel and I I promise I won't say more in this quote but I'm going to show you this example to to shake you he said you know on the first day of Pentecost when the apostles went out and preached and three thousand read it to the message devil the devil never even got off his chair he never even got excited and like we get all excited because we baptize people and I would too but Satan never got excited because new Believers came in the church but when those same Believers walked by a blind person on the side of the church and said they never had a prayer meeting either not at that time but they prayed regularly and they walked by that blind person and they were God now they were God in flesh and they said well we don't have no money but silver and gold don't we have but you just rise up and you can walk you're you're healed and all hell hit the fan because it showed the power was in the right hand and that we were God's right arm it wasn't what we were saying it wasn't how many members we had in the church but now we became God's right arm that our Prophet clearly taught us that when Jesus went to the right arm of the father it wasn't that there was two people sitting there it was God's power it was in his right arm it was the type amen we got to get to that point if we're ever going to leave this earth to hold up on the Rapture ain't God to hold up in the Rapture is the bride amen God help us it's the same today and the natural church and the spiritual have class when they come together well just let me tell you what the natural Church in the spiritual church are all message churches I don't clash with the Baptist not at all I got lots of Baptist friends no class at all wrestling Holiness they watch lots of rape videos there'll be there'll be ones from those churches watching this morning they never once rebuked me but look out message Believers oh bless God Satan's not going where the battle ain't Satan's going right to the front lines and he's weaving in among all God's elect and he's putting on a beautiful suit and he's maybe even go and learn how to like have an opera voice and talk properly and not say the ain't word and he said now the natural tries the match Are Spiritual and it always goes carnal impersonation he said this isn't God does God change his mind it's a 65 quote paragraph 41 he said now God has his church called name set aside and he said the age that she lives in and he'll reveal himself to her each and every time amen and 43 I'm just reading the highlights you know you can you can read it on the screen or or we can get it to you imagine by keep it in mind that he knows what's in your heart and he knows what you mean and no matter what you say no matter what we say he knows what we meant he's talking about God amen that what I'm trying to tell you is there's people saying all these wonderful things oh you know brother Matt oh you know bless God we baptize you and you got the Holy Ghost and you know the prophet was wonderful and he was by the way and you know and all this stuff but the devil because Satan's sliding right into the family of God if he could to Upright the home he's trying to Upright the home of God amen why do you think he's trying to divorce parents hello you think that's just perchance that like 80 percent of people get divorced is he's trying to divide and conquer Divine and conquer amen Burger 41 44 and we're just going to read the highlight and they say they're always not nature natural tries since Cain destroyed Abel the natural always strives to destroy the effects of the spiritual you know what did Jesus tell the disciples this is fresh what did Jesus tell the disciples when they came back to God and they said you know we've seen a bunch of message Believers and they were casting out demons along the way but we never went to the same Cemetery school that they went to so we rebuked them oh boys I've seen that spirit before praise God and they came to Jesus and he said you did you did uh-huh he said if they're on our side and they're rebuking evil spirits huh jealousy came from where huh he said just he said you'll find the same thing today the very same thing today he's repeating it he said it proves that it came from Satan because it's jealousy and impersonation of the truth and so we really believe that God never changes his mind about Christmas trees I mean he had Jeremiah write it in the Old Testament don't take the ways of the Pagan that go out in the forest with the Knacks and deck it with gold and silver now if you want to believe that Prophet then how are you going to believe the next prophet I guess we're going to quit preaching Moses Oh no I got it I understand we rate the prophets brother Matt one to ten and if you're on the bottom well I see like we said a few weeks ago we're only going to invite season ministers what's a seasoned minister one that compromises like the prophet I just read this quote this week you know the prophet said that you're born with your gift so and the gift is not yours president it's God so now how do you season God smoke him put him in The Smokehouse I mean like see we say things and there'll be people sitting here you know oh you know he's preached for 500 years I'm going to tell you what I just called up devil devil I just how do you start making a check like Devil hey it's just as simple if it ain't God devil I know we we established at the beginning that's radical I'm sorry huh man the Hebrew series the next one in this 57 there's not a title on yours that you put on the screen but I put in here this is a Hebrew series chapter 7 the second time he said unless we're born of the spirit of God and elected you're lost amen it's not him that willeth nor him that runeth but it's God that showeth Mercy amen and Esau tried to become a Christian and he couldn't do it he said the Bible said he wept bitterly seeking the place of repentance and he couldn't find it he said and then before he was even born God condemned him because he known he was rotten a shaster in his heart now I'm going to I want to show you something because I really don't I'm afraid you're not getting this but but we're gonna We're not gonna let this die until we know amen and God knowed by foreknowledge he knew it and he said I have loved Jacob and hated Esau and Esau looked more like a message gentlemen ouch he was refined he had went to message Cemetery no those last Parts I added he stayed home but took care of his blind daddy and he fed the cattle and everything else and he was a good boy and Jacob was a shyster he was a mummy's boy and an old-fashioned he even lied now I I'm in a flight I'll tell you there's lots of examples in the Bible where the prophets lied and God never once even remembered that they never even it never showed that they apologized for it now I'm not promoting lying but I'm promoting the election and the true bride of Christ you see what I mean like so I mean if you find out that I lie you can correct me and you should okay it won't be intentional I'm positive but but do you see all these other examples see we're not getting there because we we are good people brother Matt well bless God I wouldn't vote for that Pastor because I remember his past bless God but in that same church they got deacons that got five wives and and go preach for ministers that got multiple living wives our Prophet said that birds with feathers flock together you won't see this brother going to preach for another Minister that's got two living wives in the same church building something will freeze over before that happens oh brother Dale you're radical no I'm not radical I'm just truthful amen Jacob was a liar a Storyteller what was he and you have to admit it the Bible admits it and brings it he said run around doing everything he said his mama hung around with his mama and but yet Jacob with all his ups and downs and all his lying and failures and deceitfulness and his ways he still showed respects to the birthright so I want God I might lie still cheap I'd be wrong if I did by the way but but I want God I want him no matter what I want God amen he showed respects to the birthright and that was the Keynote he see Esau was twice the gentleman Jacob was and he said if you were judging them today uh Esau would be a way better member in the church thousand the sort of prophet said one thousand to one if you didn't know him but God took Jacob wow he said no no this even spoke to me watch this you know you got to look past all what I'm trying to tell you is look past all this chaft and looked at the real grain you know I got this throat because I blew up the combine on Monday Monday brother Matt my kids all the dirty work for me and man I couldn't breathe almost immediately and then something else happened I think but we're looking at the shaft you know there's a lot more chaff than there is green when you look out the back of my combine when I'm going through the field it looks like a dust storm there's a lot more crud going out the back than there is coming in the bin but what's coming in the bin is valuable well we got our eyes on the we got the eyes on Hollywood oh my God oh I see a thousand to one if you didn't know him but God took Jake anyway oh here he says he says here he said here Paul was a minister and you know we we love these scriptures because we know the end of the story and that but you know how many of you though where Paul went around and murdered your kids and your dad would you just jump in and sit in his church and listen to him preach the next Sunday brother Dale would have a trouble with that I'd have to have a couple prayer meetings but that's exactly the way we are today amen he said here Paul he said he said what would you do with Saint Paul he said he wanted to be a minister he said it was an old hook no juice and his old most setting ways and he said he was going around setting faces staring churches apart killing people arguing and committing all these things and people said Paul committed the unpardonable sin and you know what God said to him and the message believer said now Paul's committed the own part of no sin he showed disrespect to the Believers he's murdered them he's tore up their churches confessed them to the government threw him in prison and this is what God Said he's my servant I'm like hello no no no God God whoa whoa whoa wait wait a minute that you he's hello God says he's my servant God you need to reconsider let me tell you what he did haven't you read the newspaper God amen now we're the exact same today so we're looking at all the chaft but look in the heart look at look sin back from a distance like you know like they say Let me let me just finish this quote he said God takes the man this is this is a powerful line the prophet says he said God takes the men and makes him different it's not the man taking God becoming different that's a very different statement he said God takes the men and God makes that man different but we got a lot of men in the message that are taking the message God and think they're becoming different and it's Satan amen and God takes his man and he makes them different and it's not what you do or what you will or what you think it's what God does there you got it there's the story it's what God does Hallelujah so we know that that whole story if you want to read that on Esau and Jacob is chapter 27 in Genesis and we're just going to keep radon rolling by there amen Hallelujah see the discrepancy you don't have these quotes Vicki and I'm just going to read this it's a 60 five quote he said now as I've said he said now as I've said Judith Judas had real Faith had no real Faith sorry had no real faith he had make believe faith he had faith that he thought that that was the son of God but he didn't know that it was the son of God now that's a huge difference I think this is truth but I'm living the truth that's different amen amen amen a huge difference now he but he didn't know it was the son of God and he did it and he wouldn't have sold him he wouldn't have done it sold him for 30 pieces of silver he wouldn't have done it if he had a new a man who will now I put this in capital letters this is this is see the discrepancy a man who will compromise on this word of God being the truth he's got to be a make-believer he's got to have make-believer faith a man that'll compromise on the Bible in the word you know let me give you an example he said we get message people where like they were raised in a message Church they get married and they get divorced so maybe they leave the church for like two months they won't marry a marry another woman and then they come back to church say I'm still a message believer supposed to do with that brother Matt like see sin is one thing but but what's what's the word I'm looking for but but uh to know to do right and not do it iniquity iniquity that's another whole world okay that's what I'm talking about compromise so you know you can marry two women so you left the church for two months you went married to women then you wanted to come back and bring your religion to me God don't want you you think God's going to forgive inequity let me give you another example well there's no there's no Christian Believers in the message to marry so we'll go Mary we'll compromise we'll marry somebody that believes in Jesus well I mean it's a three Jesus but and so they go out in the world and they marry a three Jesus and then they come back to church and say no accept me I'm going to pay my tithes and the Bible says absolutely under no conditions absolutely under no conditions Mary a three God person Mary make believer and it says the Bible also says how can light and darkness walk together and how can two walk together unless they agree absolutely now there's three scriptures and you expect that well oh bless God this guy was like he never had a belly he was like he was bad like I mean he even left weights and so I married him but now I'm going to bring him to my gospel sorry and when you say that people say oh you're not forgiving you're radical you're radical I only put the Christmas tree in the back seat radical radical what did the Bible say did you know had you read that oh yeah but I was backsplitted did you still know and our churches are becoming full of that garbage and the Bible says he'll speed you out of his mouth it's going to get so tight before we leave this world hell's come up house come up it really has come up I'm telling you you know we we are alive today and somehow God's got to protect us but there's a difference between things you don't have to do and things you do have to do like like for example let me give you an example I'm losing you but if you go to the grocery store you need to buy groceries like maybe you can't manufacture well you shouldn't buy sugar so like that's that that'll kill you that causes cancer and make you fat like me so but maybe you need to buy something that you can't grow in your garden when it's cold that's the only place you get permission but that grocery store sells liquor now I know people that are more radical than me they say well I won't go to the store because they sell liquor so I'm not going to the store well hmm you'd really have to look hard to find another store but now put that whole scenario now if you go to the bar where you wouldn't have to be now I know some of the best restaurants are bar restaurants and even you know and you know I mean I've eaten those but do you see where we're going there's things that you must do and then there's things that you don't have to do you know what I mean gotta look at those two things differently he will God help us it's it's like and I'm not going there but it's like the internet nor a prophet used to preach about TV and he said then that Satan brought a trick and moved the teeth the well the prophet used to preach about going to movie shows then he said he moved the movie show in the house now now now I have heard not from brother Brandon himself because he was dead before I was born but I have heard from his kids the brother Branham watched Gunsmoke and Bonanza western movies Gunsmoke and Bonanza but I want to tell you something we're living in a different world than when the prophet was here yeah I'm just going to be flat out honest with you I got a sore throat or I'd be jumping a lot more this week on my video thing even in studying it if I was online online I mean completely in the message mode brother Matt through the Wi-Fi and if you went from one scene to another there was pornography come up and I'm talking about scenes that weren't fit for me to see so we're Beyond preaching about TV you'd have to start preaching about pastors using the internet to search a message that's crazy but that's where we're living and it might actually get to that point but what I'm trying to tell you is Satan is a slicker and he's coming in every corner to try to break down God's family and we we need to be really careful we need to recognize Satan he's religious and he's a sharp dude he's religious and he's a sharp dude he ain't no hairy beast coming in amen sit back and watch how people treat one another you want to know the character of a person watch how they treat one another you know they used to say he said you girls if you're looking for a husband and you look at some get some fat guy like your dad that's real ugly and all the other girls run from and stand back and watch how he treats his mother or better yet even better yet his grandmother and if he ever goes and sees her and that's exactly how much he'll visit you when he gets done with you it's called character it's called election and it's in the real bride of Christ bride don't destroy bride you would be just Jehovah does not destroy Jehovah Jehovah is not in a competition with Jehovah my big toe is not trying to be my head and my head right now is trying to be my arm you understand jealousy can I share one more example with you pilate pilot let me share a pilot pilate had a choice to make he said Matthew 27 17 and we're going to close soon because we're not going to finish and I'll pull up somewhere I was remembering today pilot Matthew 27 17 therefore when they entered in together pilate said unto them whom will ye that I release unto you see pilate had a choice and even our Prophet when I'm preaching election this morning but you'll only be there if you're elected but you could still refuse the prophet said multiple multiple times you're a free moral agent he also said that Judas name was taking off the Lamb's Book of Life so don't get too heavy duty on that you won't even be there if you're not elected but if you're elected and you tell God I hate you enough times you know God has a way of bringing people around and changing that hate to love like breaking your legs and you know working on you but here pilate had example he said who would I release unto you Brabus or Jesus which is called the Christ see even pilate knew God and then we know the story he said pilate in verse 19 he said pilate's wife said unto him and and the prophet dramatized us here said Pilots ain't ready to give judgment on Jesus and he said a horse man comes up and runs up and gives pilate a note and it's from his wife and he said don't have nothing to do with this just man because I've suffered many things in a dream last night and and the prophet dramatizes like this he said now if you were sitting in that courtroom he said you would see him read that note and pilate's face turned white and His Hands start to quiver reading the note and his knees wobbling as he stood up he knew he knew and his wife knew for sure he knew the father's wife sat on them have nothing to do with this just man for I've suffered many things in a night in a dream because of him and verse 20 the chief priests and Elders watch this the message people and the and the uh what's the word uh season the message and seasoned ministers in the message persuaded the multitude that they would ask for Barabbas and Destroy Jesus now that's today's scripture a matter of fact I'll even tell you this that's thus saith the Lord because I was there when God gave it to me yep the religious people in The Message Church what you say you say no you went too far the Bible says that Jesus went to his own at his own refused him not oh they just don't see it the same as us careful careful praise God I'm not looking for a traveling Ministry I'm not looking for a Ministry period 20 and the chief priests message believers and the seasoned message believers persuaded the church members to ask for Barabbas and Destroy Jesus and Spirits don't die it's the exact same in 2023. I said it before I said if you ever get persuaded or get persecuted it'll be from inside the church if I ever go behind bars it'll be cause a message person testifies against me it will not be it it will not be my neighbor's brother Matt it will not be they're highly respected among them yep because Lucifer was in heaven and he wanted the worship of Jesus Michael that's the exact same spirit and it is extremely healthy with all this fresh rain it's growing like crazy natural types of spiritual there's no drought in the spiritual uh-huh that's far out ain't it amen if you put up the true Easter seal there and just uh put up the second one I think it is we're just going to skip the first one it was mostly talking about King nabel but if we go to uh uh sorry well I mean we're just read them both because I can't find the word I'm looking for all right paragraph 70 76 and the sons of Cain rather the Sons of Satan and the Sons of Satan came the sons of King Cain was the son of Satan and so there you have it the sons of King today you say are you sure brother Brown they were questioning the prophet you're questioning me this morning I said yep I'm sure I'm positive he said Jesus said 77 he said when when he was here on Earth he said he told them religious Believers he said you are our other father is the devil and yet they were Pious and religious and Scholars and they had great buildings and he said they failed to recognize the Christ and they failed to catch it in their day said the same thing they failed to recognize the day we're living in he said we jump down to paragraph 79 what's highlighted and we know then that's the same devil in the beginning was the one who personated Cain and persecuted his brother and killed them he said it's the same thing taking place today the same leaders have persecuted Jesus and killed them and they forced him to a decision the same thing that forced back in the Garden of Eden and they forced to make a decision he said well what about this the sons of Cain the Sons of Satan said in paragraph 80 and we're just going to read the highlights and now that was all that was and all that would be and all the kingdoms of the world and he said these are mine this is talking about Satan he said these are mine and I'll do with them whatever I want to and I'll make them fight and make them do this or anything and he claimed the kingdoms of the world and so when we can see how greed and selfishness comes into policies or politics and we can see them where where it's in the church and the church leaders are greedy and selfies and it comes into the church he said just in the end of 81 just this highlight he said what what was Paul the political side he said they could find nothing against him so here the government of the day see what I said the world will not condemn you the government pilate couldn't condemn Jesus but the seasoned ministers could wow amen and the policy the politics of the day you can find nothing against them even so much that pilate said unto himself pilate said I find no fault in them and he said then it comes to the church and he said they the church the message church and he said they're forced to make a decision after the political world had set Jesus free to cooperate with such a spirit as it was in the church he said what was in what was in the politics to show that if Satan lost his battle here he was still had something in reserve so what the prophet's saying is when Satan lost the battle and and pilate said I don't find no fault in Jesus in the political world Satan had already infested the message church and he said I'll kill him from the church wow amen amen God help us God help us to recognize him man we're going to go into some more things when we come back I mean we got Joseph and his boys and many more examples that we'll we'll finish out if God permits us to do amen amen it's a let's stand amen we don't want to hold you long him in how you preach for another hour on the Same Spirit but the results are saying is Satan is a Slicker and he's if we let the bars down well it's already happened the saints come into the church and even when our Prophet was here he said the churches have Believers and make Believers and non-believers and you'll recognize Satan by his character and by if he says well you know he meant the Bible means you know you know when the conversation starts oh brother Matt well you know compromise if they call you radical you're radical because you want to go marry a denominational girl or man radical when the Bible tells us the Bible tells us three times through four times never under no conditions Mary and unbeliever never never that's never holiness the Bible says without holiness no man will see God we're living in a world where Hollywood's coming in the church oh but in the religious ranks Mary non-believers non-believer sits home believer comes but they've done it intentionally they're like slapping in God but intentional is Iniquity you know what's wrong you say well God will understand God will not understand God will not understand he's coming for a peculiar bride that'll look different and all the Jezebels in the world amen and that's who he's coming to marry amen and I'll tell you right now the farther we go along and I I'm sorry to tell you this I really am the farther we go along and the farther the Rapture is is not come you're going to become more radical and radical radical they're radical I want to tell you this morning things give you the power I'm going to preach that sometime to make a world and live on it and you do not have to be affected on whether it rains or sunshines tomorrow I'm not a factor because this I have no love for this world the love of the world and so I'm not I'm not connected I want to be connected to God but not to the world I'm disconnected to the world and as they separate you're going to be so the saints come in like a flood but God's raised up a standard and that standard was the baptism of the Holy Ghost where you could speak a world into existence and go live and you know what that world is it's peace and yourself it's you and Christ and you're not real I'm not concerned what you know I'm not concerned about people see you have hot no believer no believer has low self-esteem no no believer God does not have low self-esteem of himself and you you can't be of God and have low self-esteem I don't mean that sounds arrogant but amen God knows who he is and where he stands and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's not going to change amen God help us God help brother Dale wow yeah we've come all this way we've come all this way to the map and then we're going to start letting go with this thing and that thing we can really we're going to start we will paint our face just so we're getting married that'll be all right because it's the wedding really I've had message Believers tell me that well we never wear makeup except on our wedding well I hope you enjoy help it'll be fairly unpleasant there but you have a nice wedding because watch this this is as fresh as it gets what's God taking a picture of you when you're old or young you take a picture at your best at your wedding and he'll say Jezebel in this message probably 95 percent oh bless God I just want to look good for my pictures yeah yeah you'll look good for God's pictures too see if it's in there it's see you know I'm combined in wheat now and it's done growing and it's completely mature and if there's a stock of Timothy in the field brother Matt I can identify that's Timothy this is we if there was a stock of Oats come up I can identify there's the oats they look completely different because they're mature and they look different in the wheat and barley and rye grass and Quack grass not but all in their maturity they all look like blades but now it's went into quackgrass and Timothy and crab grass and barnyard grass and and barley and oats and rye grass and God's just going that's mine oh rye grass oh no that's blood but that's that's still the truth it's blood that's the truth we're we're not in a baby age we're in a mature age we've had all this strong food this seven course meal since the seals have been opened and there's no Mysteries that aren't unveiled the prophet is come and the Bible's brand new and like that's why it's so hard when you're making a message because God I'll just get something and I'll put it down on my iPad and I'll completely leave it alone I'll get something else to come in a different field and I'll just put it down too I'll put something else down and then all of a sudden there'll be like a tidal wave and it'll just go and I'll look into it and it would just go and go and go I looked into Yesterday put down all my thoughts I woke up this morning I wrote three things before I left my bedroom coming out in three more thoughts and I came this morning they were just flooding just because because it's all understood God wants you to clearly understand who he is because when you go like when you go to see Isaac Rebecca had never seen him but she knew Eliezer had just brought Rebecca look at when when God went to see Abraham Abraham had never seen because of it but if you had seen him because he knew I made it's just amazing Revelation election of Revelation it's just it's just beautiful amen God help us God help me I hope I hope you got what God wanted I seen I'm old enough to see how people that grew up have changed I've seen message people change I've seen I've seen message people go out on Devil's Night trick-or-treating I've seen them do all these things close their Church on Christmas hire only Elite ministers I've seen all these changes I grew up in the Holiness Church where you in the dream of cutting your hair or wearing anything than a skirt to the floor standards completely gone completely women preachers anything goes it's it you know what it is it's that new love it's that new love it's called tolerance and the Bible says that that new love was an abomination it's that new love yeah abomination he's saying there's got to be a drastic difference a drastic there's got to be a radical difference between us and that radical that'd help us God help us I mean you're not we're not going to save anybody be becoming them it only is going to make you lost also amen I'm sorry I'm sorry for being so radical mascots please [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] yeah let everything that I knew be pleasing to you pray [Music] that I pursue thank you Lord me please [Music] thank you Lord Jesus let's try to sing that course of that song we were talking about before amen amen we're just going to sing the the course we're going to get the words printed up amen he's the same God I'll tell you the words before we sing it he's the same God I spoke to the woman at the well he's the same God whose wonders were too many to tell he's the same God who parted the Raging Red Sea and he's exactly the same guy [Music] just [Music] ice [Music] too many days [Music] the lemonade [Music] and he's the same guy today [Music] foreign [Music]
