[21:39] cut up a signal
[21:42] just a prayer request just before in an
[21:44] announcement for read our scriptures
[21:46] Easter weekend Mike Allen from Ohio is
[21:49] going to be with us he's actually coming
[21:51] over his his kids March break so he will
[21:54] actually be with us on Wednesday night
[21:56] and Saturday night we're going to have
[21:58] Fort Washington communion that's Easter
[22:03] weekend amen and he'll be here Sunday
[22:06] with us so whatever date that is I think
[22:08] it's about the ninth or something like
[22:11] that but Easter weekend that Saturday
[22:15] um you uh
[22:17] hypothetically Saturday will probably
[22:19] have service whenever it's convenient
[22:22] for everybody but five six o'clock
[22:24] something like that I mean that's
[22:26] flexible
[22:27] I'd like to have Sarah to your service
[22:29] earlier because then people can go back
[22:32] and be not tired for Sunday
[22:35] hey Matt so that'll be a real blessing
[22:37] and also we we changed the posters out
[22:40] here for the July first weekend and so
[22:44] there's updated posters there for the
[22:46] family camp at Silver Lake and the youth
[22:49] Rally or weekend at John dankwas and I I
[22:53] would hugely
[22:56] encourage you if if I'm your pastor be
[22:59] at one of those meetings
[23:01] unless you're sick or dead
[23:03] amen amen I just I just
[23:06] I mean if that offends you I'm sorry but
[23:08] amen I don't believe in sitting home
[23:11] and I don't believe in going to a
[23:13] denominational charge
[23:15] that's just they they don't have no food
[23:17] they don't even have the same God
[23:19] so uh then not only they don't have food
[23:21] they don't even have same Gods amen
[23:23] let's just read our scriptures and we're
[23:25] going to continue on the same thought
[23:27] and and I you know what the prophet said
[23:29] Romans 10
[23:31] and uh
[23:34] my print on my message thing iPad comes
[23:37] up small room it's 10 and 14 and we're
[23:40] going to read a couple scriptures and
[23:42] you have your seats
[23:43] amen you know the prophet said in the
[23:46] message he said the hardest thing God
[23:48] ever did
[23:49] is have him have one person
[23:52] listen to another person and get the
[23:55] first person to believe that the second
[23:56] person
[23:57] is used in speaking for God
[24:00] the hardest thing God ever did amen all
[24:03] the way through the Old Testament in the
[24:04] New Testament you think of you know the
[24:06] prophet even mentioned in quotes as they
[24:09] withstood Moses they said you know Moses
[24:11] you're not the only one that God speaks
[24:13] to
[24:14] and you know amen we know what happened
[24:17] amen
[24:20] Hallelujah
[24:21] and how shall they
[24:23] call on him in whom they have not
[24:26] believed and how shall they believe in
[24:28] him by whom they have not heard and how
[24:33] shall they hear
[24:35] without a preacher
[24:37] and how shall they preach except they be
[24:41] sent and as it is written how beautiful
[24:44] are the feet of them
[24:46] that preached the gospel of peace and
[24:50] bring good tidings
[24:52] and good things good tidings of good
[24:55] things man just one more scripture
[24:58] we read it last week yes we
[25:01] scroll back up second Timothy 3 and 16
[25:03] and all scriptures is given for
[25:06] inspiration of of inspiration of God and
[25:09] is profitable for Doctrine and reproof
[25:12] for correction and instruction and
[25:14] righteousness and verse 17 and that the
[25:17] man of God make me perfectly
[25:20] and thoroughly finished Lord Jesus we
[25:22] ask you that the blessing to your word
[25:25] and may you come and minister to your
[25:27] bride this morning we pray
[25:30] amen
[25:32] amen just you may have your seats just
[25:35] uh
[25:48] carrying on our thought for last week
[25:49] and just actually just come to me I
[25:51] forgot earlier I'm sorry in my today
[25:54] this very day today
[25:57] exactly nine years ago we had our first
[26:00] church service
[26:02] exactly nine years ago and I would say
[26:04] that God was more
[26:06] than faithful
[26:08] and he's done exceedingly above
[26:11] everything
[26:13] you could even ask or think he's done
[26:15] exceedingly above everything he's ever
[26:17] told me
[26:19] he would do when he called me there was
[26:21] things that God said that he would do
[26:24] and I couldn't imagine nine years ago
[26:27] that we would be and and God would have
[26:30] held us and kept us
[26:32] the same
[26:33] but it's by the grace and love of
[26:36] almighty God Amen we love that this
[26:39] morning amen and we bless them amen so
[26:42] we look into this thoughty man you see
[26:45] that that we know that the holy spirit
[26:47] is our head
[26:49] and and if the holy spirit is in our
[26:51] head then we're all lost
[26:54] we're all lost
[26:55] and and the Bible says to know them that
[26:58] labor among you and if you don't know
[26:59] them that labor among you you need to
[27:01] pray and and fast and and dwell in that
[27:04] and watch the person that's labored
[27:06] among you
[27:08] amen we're taking our character with us
[27:10] you know in no way are these messages
[27:14] there's no way is God trying to I I God
[27:17] don't believe in respects the persons
[27:19] and in no way is the holy spirit
[27:21] ministering this thought with respect to
[27:23] the ministers
[27:25] that that's not the case and if you know
[27:28] me if you don't know me if you think
[27:30] that amen uh that's the farthest thing
[27:33] from my thought
[27:34] but we are living in a laodicean world
[27:36] that headship is a major problem and we
[27:39] mentioned that last week where where
[27:40] nobody submissive to nobody nobody obeys
[27:43] the government or the police or the or
[27:45] their husbands and the parents kids
[27:46] don't you know the Bible says in the
[27:48] last time the kids will be rebellious to
[27:50] parents amen and all these things it's
[27:53] nobody wants to answer to anybody but we
[27:56] all have a head and no matter how high
[27:58] you go up on the the lottery Christ is
[28:01] our head and believe me Christ can give
[28:04] you a spanking like nobody can give you
[28:08] Hallelujah
[28:11] Grace will ultimately protect his holy
[28:13] ghost feel bright and if there's
[28:16] somebody hurting his bride
[28:18] he can take you by an untimely death
[28:23] amen
[28:24] so you can have faith and you should you
[28:28] know the prophet said this also he said
[28:30] you know you stay with your pastor
[28:34] but if he leaves the word of God you run
[28:37] for your life
[28:39] run for your life
[28:41] now you may have things that you know
[28:43] but but the prophet said many things in
[28:46] this and well let me read some of these
[28:48] quotes just to show you this he said
[28:50] being a Christian today we deal mostly
[28:51] with this he said oh how could it be
[28:54] that Believers have so many different
[28:56] ideas
[28:58] how in the world could the message of
[29:00] God the the the full revealed truth of
[29:04] the Bible through that God sent that's
[29:07] just beautiful and perfect
[29:11] through the humblest person that ever
[29:13] breathes
[29:14] next to Christ
[29:17] and you have people that are as
[29:19] different as the black is from the white
[29:24] our Prophet said how in the world could
[29:26] that even be he said it was the greatest
[29:28] thing we deal with he said so many
[29:30] different thoughts and many different
[29:32] angles and approach to the gospel and he
[29:34] said everyone is claiming that they are
[29:36] perfectly right and the next fellow is
[29:38] totally and completely wrong
[29:42] this is a direct quote by the way
[29:45] and he said when you see that from
[29:47] someone doing that then you're pretty
[29:49] well sure
[29:51] your party washer
[29:54] that you're on the line
[29:58] he said the Bible says that he that
[30:00] thinks he knows something
[30:02] he knows nothing
[30:07] wow
[30:09] amen here's another one there's so many
[30:11] isms and Fashions and everything else in
[30:13] the world today in so many different
[30:15] ideas he mentions that phrase dozens of
[30:18] times I I brought even ones that I liked
[30:21] and I left them in my desk because
[30:22] that's all we would have read this
[30:23] morning amen and things and he said the
[30:25] father he said he knows that we're not
[30:27] trying he hears a prophet watch this he
[30:30] said he says Thou knowest that I we're
[30:32] not trying to say that here on this
[30:35] platform that we're the only one that
[30:37] have your message
[30:40] whoa
[30:42] how in the world did the prophet that
[30:44] brought the message
[30:46] say that
[30:49] he was teachable
[30:52] our Prophet was teachable
[30:55] he was teachable God helped brother Dale
[30:58] to be teachable
[31:00] Hallelujah
[31:03] amen he said
[31:08] he said I'm trying to tell them and
[31:10] every believer and everyone that
[31:12] believes that it that to be brought
[31:15] that's brought into relationship with
[31:18] the Lord Jesus
[31:20] Christ
[31:21] amen now we have to have a relation we
[31:24] have to not just have a relationship
[31:26] with the Lord Jesus Christ But first you
[31:28] have to have a revelation or an
[31:30] understanding or both
[31:32] of who your lord Jesus Christ is
[31:35] Hallelujah and he ate three or four
[31:37] people amen and he ain't just the body
[31:40] in flesh he is a the spirit of God
[31:44] almighty
[31:48] he is Jehovah Jireh he said there the
[31:51] trouble of the church today he said now
[31:53] listen to me and he said he said this is
[31:56] amazing this in Jehovah driving this
[31:57] this is a direct quote from the prophet
[31:59] he said there's trouble in the church
[32:00] today and he said now listen to me
[32:03] and these next words you know this is
[32:05] the truth this is the prophet he says I
[32:07] love you
[32:08] and he said you know I do that
[32:11] and he said but there's a thing and it's
[32:13] with you he said there's been uh
[32:15] different uh you know doctrines are
[32:18] different things in doctrinations he
[32:21] said but the thing is that you've been
[32:23] indoctrinated sorry with so many
[32:26] different ideas
[32:30] amen I don't want you to learn brother
[32:32] Dale's ideas
[32:35] I am just a mouthpiece
[32:38] for brother for God Jehovah's ideas
[32:41] man just the whole word of God every
[32:44] line upon line precept upon precept it's
[32:47] all good for Doctrine and amen even the
[32:49] ones that brother Dale don't like
[32:52] Hallelujah he said you've been
[32:55] indoctrinated with so many ideas tell
[32:57] you don't know what to do
[32:59] he said and now that's the truth and he
[33:02] said now one Miracle could happen here
[33:04] in a foreign country he names a foreign
[33:07] country and he said over there in some
[33:09] of those countries over there and
[33:10] thousands of people with border Christ
[33:13] and the same Miracle would happen right
[33:15] here in Wyoming and you'd be sitting in
[33:17] your Pew saying I wonder if that's God
[33:27] he said but when the Lord comes and does
[33:29] something here you go oh wow I guess um
[33:32] maybe I could he said what the problem
[33:34] is
[33:35] is your attitude
[33:39] wow

[33:45] just trust God
[33:48] man you know in Colossians 4 and and
[33:52] this is just beautiful let me just read
[33:53] this said in Colossians 4 he said
[33:55] Masters give unto your servants that
[33:57] which is just in in for Colossians 4 1.
[34:01] he said Masters give unto your servant
[34:02] thou which is just an equal knowing that
[34:04] ye also have a master in heaven
[34:07] man we're not preaching respects of
[34:09] person
[34:11] but God has a program and a way he goes
[34:14] and continue in prayer and watching the
[34:16] same with Thanksgiving and here here the
[34:19] scripture you know what they use a uh a
[34:22] difficult English word but I mean it's
[34:24] here with all
[34:25] it means always be here with all the
[34:29] definition of here with all is Old
[34:31] English but it means continually here
[34:34] with all praying also for us
[34:37] talking about the ministers
[34:39] that God would open our
[34:41] open us a door of utterance our big
[34:44] mouth and speak the mysteries of Christ
[34:46] for which I am also a slave in bonds to
[34:52] Hallelujah
[34:55] that we might make manifest as we ought
[34:58] to speak here's Paul saying I need your
[35:01] prayers the greatest messenger in the
[35:03] Bible he wrote All mobiles all the New
[35:05] Testament he brought was a messenger of
[35:08] grace and mercy Moses brought the law
[35:11] Paul brought grace and mercy and here
[35:13] he's saying pray for me
[35:16] pray for me
[35:17] the Christ will open Revelation is given
[35:21] by Jehovah God and that I might utter
[35:23] and speak What God Says walk in wisdom
[35:26] towards them that are without Redeeming
[35:29] the time and let our speech always be
[35:31] with Grace and season with salt that we
[35:35] may know how we ought to
[35:38] answer
[35:39] every man
[35:42] as we read that song pleasing God help
[35:46] me
[35:47] there are situations that you will deal
[35:49] with
[35:50] that we need God's help
[35:52] I need God's help we all need God's help
[35:54] you got families here this morning your
[35:57] parents you need God's help raising
[35:59] these kids they need the baptism of the
[36:01] Holy Ghost and you can be the best
[36:03] prayer in the world and it'll be a
[36:05] catastrophe you need Jehovah God's
[36:08] anointing
[36:09] amen it's beyond man's ability
[36:12] but God does have principles to build up
[36:16] and support you and if you do all in
[36:19] your ability
[36:20] then God will back you up
[36:23] Hallelujah you know Israel just had to
[36:26] show up for those battles
[36:29] and God took care of the rest
[36:31] you know when Israel went and he had
[36:34] Joshua I was I read all of Joshua this
[36:36] weekend and as the armies you know God
[36:40] called Joshua and Joshua was The
[36:42] Greatest Warrior of all and greater than
[36:44] Moses and and they divided the promised
[36:47] land to the people of Israel and here
[36:49] Joshua was going to war and God said
[36:51] whoa whoa whoa you got way too many
[36:52] people in your church
[36:54] that's a new doctrine
[36:57] wow you know our Prophet said he said I
[36:59] want to character of the people
[37:02] you could have hundreds and hundreds of
[37:03] people but if they don't have no
[37:04] character
[37:06] amen
[37:08] God wants character we want Believers
[37:10] now we want new people to come in and
[37:12] taste and see what we've seen as good
[37:14] but God but in a relationship we want we
[37:17] want real brothers and sisters brothers
[37:20] and sisters with the backbone to stand
[37:22] up for what's right and just and true
[37:25] for their family and their Church
[37:28] Hallelujah
[37:30] God help us
[37:33] God help us here you know here's a
[37:37] saying that I and I seen and I wrote it
[37:39] down and it's good when he said you know
[37:40] leaders and pastors and Ministry of the
[37:43] fivefold ministry should lead you closer
[37:46] to Christ
[37:48] and not farther away
[37:50] Hallelujah
[37:53] closer to Christ
[37:56] if they're building you to themselves
[37:58] this is not brother this is not a
[38:00] kingdom building except for Christ
[38:03] and this is a multi-member bride we're
[38:06] just a piece of the toe or little finger
[38:08] and the whole body of Christ it's not
[38:10] just Wyoming going in a rapture
[38:12] it's a many-membered bride from around
[38:15] the world
[38:17] Hallelujah
[38:18] don't don't watch it watch this this is
[38:21] a really good scene
[38:23] he said ministers
[38:25] should point you bull you closer to
[38:27] Christ
[38:29] he said don't put them too high on a
[38:32] pedestal
[38:37] that they would hinder your personal
[38:39] relationship with Christ
[38:41] you can
[38:43] go directly to him
[38:48] amen
[38:50] many times in the church world
[38:53] I mean I mean we believe in respects but
[38:55] we should respect everybody I totally
[38:57] you know how I preach the scripture is
[38:59] touch not my anointing do my prophets no
[39:01] harm everyone with the baptism of the
[39:03] Holy Ghost is Anointed
[39:05] hey man that's not just for Minister
[39:07] food
[39:08] ministers can use that self-serving
[39:10] that's for the bride of Christ
[39:13] amen be not respecter is a person the
[39:15] least in the body can judge the needs in
[39:18] the body
[39:18] Hallelujah that's not justified
[39:21] ministers
[39:24] God help us Ephesians 4 let's read a
[39:28] scripture here Ephesians 4 11 and we
[39:30] know this is very much and he gave some
[39:32] Apostles and some prophets and some
[39:34] evangelists and some pastors and some
[39:37] teachers
[39:38] and for the perfecting of the Saints and
[39:41] the work of the ministry and for the
[39:43] edifying of the body of Christ God help
[39:46] us that we're edifying Christ and not
[39:48] edifying our own personal Doctrine or
[39:51] our own personal Church
[39:55] people will ask you if you're a
[39:57] Christian or
[39:59] people ask you if you're a Christian
[40:00] Uptown you say well I go to
[40:03] this church
[40:05] or so-and-so is my pastor
[40:08] because you know that most of the world
[40:10] will know them
[40:12] but what's wrong with just saying yes
[40:14] I'm a Christian
[40:15] I believe in Jesus Christ
[40:17] as my Lord and Savior
[40:20] hello
[40:21] you know I have the quote and I don't
[40:22] have it in front of me but I have the
[40:23] quote if you ask me the prophet said
[40:25] that about the I thought it was the
[40:27] Herald's Revival one of those Christian
[40:29] magazines and he says the only problem
[40:31] that I dislike about it and I've
[40:32] mentioned this before here I I had the
[40:34] quote and I found it I dug I dug deep
[40:38] he said as they matching names see it's
[40:40] not we're not we're not it's names you
[40:43] know like when we announce our
[40:44] anniversary meetings now I told you Mike
[40:46] Allen's coming in Easter but you know
[40:48] when we announce our our anniversary
[40:50] meetings in November
[40:53] the holy spirit's preaching
[40:57] amen
[41:03] we're in bodies
[41:04] boiled up
[41:07] you know
[41:10] ought not to be that way
[41:13] do we come to the unity of the faith
[41:14] verse 13 till we come to the unity of
[41:17] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[41:19] God unto a perfect man and the measure
[41:23] and Stat the stature
[41:26] fullness of Christ God help us
[41:29] God help us I want to find a one that
[41:34] just uh
[41:36] I know I read this last week
[41:39] he said please church have a little
[41:41] faith just a little while he said you
[41:43] must come under teaching he said and I
[41:46] read this last week I'm just he say I
[41:48] don't need anyone to teach me
[41:50] after the Holy Ghost has come and I have
[41:52] the Holy Ghost and he said friends that
[41:54] gives me just a little room to doubt
[41:56] whether you really even got the Holy
[41:58] Ghost
[42:00] he said you're acting in the weight and
[42:02] doing he said the same Holy Ghost that's
[42:04] teaching you
[42:06] but teachers in the body
[42:09] amen
[42:11] our Prophet that's not the only time
[42:15] he mentioned that
[42:19] here he said in another message in
[42:22] Israel and the church
[42:25] in paragraph 104 he said well they say I
[42:28] don't need anyone to teach me glory to
[42:30] God I got the Holy Ghost well then the
[42:32] Holy Ghost was wrong when he put some of
[42:34] the teachers in the church God put them
[42:38] in the church as teachers and that
[42:40] settles it and why did he put teachers
[42:42] in there he said if the Holy Ghost was
[42:45] going to do all the teaching
[42:47] I bring that up not because we're
[42:50] edifying ministers but I bring that up
[42:52] because we're living in a society around
[42:54] us that refuses to sit under anything
[42:59] and so they stay home and think they can
[43:02] press play and obey
[43:04] and
[43:06] they're deceived
[43:08] I had a person that was was messaging me
[43:11] and he was sending quotes and and we
[43:13] believe these quotes where where the
[43:16] Prophet had said he had come back to the
[43:18] Tabernacle to soar up food and Pastor
[43:20] Neville was going to use to start up
[43:22] food to serve the people and he said see
[43:24] the prophet's the only one with stored
[43:26] up food
[43:28] and I said the Bible says that you'll
[43:30] never be perfected under only a
[43:32] prophet's Ministry
[43:36] amen the Bible says that the secrets and
[43:39] the Mysteries will come to the prophets
[43:41] but he had fivefold Ministry
[43:44] and now you can't throw the prophet out
[43:47] see the other people they throw them out
[43:49] but the other people they only want a
[43:51] prophet
[43:54] confused
[43:56] and doctrines see the prophet said like
[43:59] this and different he said everybody in
[44:01] their mind has built a picture of God
[44:05] that's what that's what our Prophet said
[44:07] multiple quotes I could find dozens of
[44:10] them you have mercury he said you're
[44:12] made a thing of God
[44:15] and if the minister or the fivefold
[44:17] ministry or God himself steps out of
[44:20] that
[44:21] you draw a line
[44:23] the prophet said he said we're building
[44:24] a house not a wall
[44:26] and he said it takes a lot better Mason
[44:28] to turn corners
[44:31] we're building a building which is this
[44:33] is a house
[44:35] we're not just
[44:37] and so God
[44:38] turn corners
[44:40] and when you turn corners most people
[44:43] want to just go straight
[44:45] it's much easier to go straight well
[44:48] that's what I've always known was
[44:50] straight
[44:51] Matt
[44:53] help us Galatians 1 8 says but though we
[44:57] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[45:00] gospel unto you
[45:01] then that which we've preached unto you
[45:03] let them be a curse as we said before so
[45:07] say we now again
[45:09] here's Paul in the in the New Testament
[45:12] twice immediately back to back
[45:19] If any man preach any other gospel unto
[45:22] you then what we have received then let
[45:25] them be a curse you know the scripture
[45:28] in the the New Testament where Paul and
[45:30] I don't have in front of me and I'm not
[45:31] going there but where Paul said he said
[45:34] I fear
[45:36] and God's not given us a spirit of fear
[45:38] but Paul feared that people would come
[45:41] and preach another Jesus
[45:43] and see Paul wrote Ephesians 5.
[45:47] where he said it was the fivefold
[45:49] ministry was for the perfecting of the
[45:52] Saints and the work of the ministry and
[45:54] to come into the unity in the body of
[45:56] the Perfection of Christ it wasn't about
[45:59] the fivefold ministry it was just God
[46:01] worked through them
[46:03] amen God it's all about Jesus Christ
[46:06] everything is about Jesus Christ
[46:10] amen
[46:12] everything
[46:13] is about Jesus Christ
[46:15] Isaiah 28
[46:19] and 9.
[46:22] we read that
[46:25] no we did not sorry apologize Isaiah 28
[46:29] 9 Whom Shall he teach knowledge and whom
[46:32] shall have understanding of Doctrine
[46:34] them that are weaned from the milk and
[46:37] draw it from their breasts
[46:39] 14 for life for precept must be upon
[46:42] precept
[46:43] and precept upon precept and line upon
[46:46] line and here a little there a little
[46:49] for with stammering lips and another
[46:51] tongue will he speak to his people to
[46:54] whom he said this is the rest wherewith
[46:58] ye shall cause
[47:00] the weary to rest it's not in the
[47:03] fightfold ministry it's not in man
[47:04] you're not resting in man you're not
[47:07] even rested in a man's message it's
[47:09] Christ it was Christ's message it was
[47:12] the Christ is the word and the word is
[47:14] the only thing that will never pass away
[47:16] you're resting in peace with the truth
[47:20] he's giving you the truth and you can
[47:22] just you know it's the right it's not
[47:24] like how do you know you go to because
[47:26] it's it's an n-word piece you've
[47:31] it's hard to explain
[47:33] besides predestination
[47:36] see you've been there and it's like you
[47:38] you recognize my sheep hear my voice and
[47:42] another and another they'll not follow
[47:50] amen
[47:52] thank you Lord
[47:54] my rest and this is refreshing yet they
[47:58] they would not hear
[48:00] that's
[48:03] see God's had a program
[48:06] that he would Minister through
[48:08] ultimately keeping God at the top
[48:12] totally got at the top
[48:15] the people have wanted to go straight
[48:17] directly to the top
[48:19] and bypass
[48:21] amen
[48:22] just like just like the work of Grace
[48:24] amen we believe in Salvation we believe
[48:27] in sanctification
[48:29] and we believe in the baptism of the
[48:30] Holy Ghost you don't just go from a
[48:33] sinner to Holy Ghost
[48:38] you have to repent
[48:42] God won't fill a cup
[48:44] that's dirty I don't want to drink a
[48:47] water out of a dirty cup
[48:50] God help us
[48:52] God help us not to skip
[48:54] the prophet said it like this he said
[48:56] you got
[48:57] the buggy on the top of the tree
[49:00] or you got the cart in front of the
[49:02] horse
[49:03] horses don't push very easy
[49:06] but that's how multiple people
[49:09] are trying to serve God God help us
[49:12] God to laid this out of planning man
[49:17] all we do I do is obey therefore hear
[49:20] the word of the Lord yeast and you
[49:23] scornful men that rule his people
[49:26] which are in Jerusalem help us Jesus
[49:29] that will that will obey God Amen to to
[49:32] get God's got the best thing for you
[49:35] and all you got to do
[49:37] is follow his Commandments
[49:40] amen he said here in this in the Seal of
[49:42] Christ he said they've rejected the
[49:45] truth when it was presented and then
[49:47] their ears are sealed up
[49:49] and they've turned
[49:52] to religion they've turned away from God
[49:54] and went to religion
[49:58] Hallelujah that's that's that's not in
[50:00] the denominations that's in the message
[50:04] it's not in the denominations they
[50:06] they've sealed up and their eardrums are
[50:09] punctured
[50:11] and because because they God's given
[50:13] them over to a strong delusion that they
[50:16] would believe a lie
[50:18] and they've turned away from the truth
[50:21] and God's given them a religion
[50:24] God help us
[50:25] God help us
[50:28] just like he said in the Christ the
[50:30] mystery of God revealed you know as
[50:32] chamber and James restood Moses
[50:35] and in there when they came out of Egypt
[50:37] he said you know
[50:39] they they wanted to do it their own way
[50:42] but God had a way
[50:44] God had a way
[50:46] God help us here here in some messages
[50:48] and and we're just we're teaching this
[50:51] morning but we want to do we want to
[50:53] know the truth amen here multiple times
[50:56] the prophet said that the Judgment seat
[50:58] the church is the Judgment seat of God
[51:02] the perfect type of the church the
[51:04] church is the Judgment seat and judgment
[51:07] begins in the house of God now how is
[51:09] that going to work for the people that
[51:11] don't attend church
[51:12] how's it going to work for the people
[51:13] that don't even believe in church
[51:15] there's people that believe this message
[51:17] with their whole heart they attended
[51:18] here they didn't believe in church
[51:20] buildings they didn't believe in
[51:21] communion they didn't believe in the
[51:22] fivefold ministry
[51:25] but they have the complete library in
[51:27] their house
[51:28] but wait a minute but that Library
[51:30] teaches church and fight for Ministry
[51:33] and communion and foot washing
[51:35] how did that happen
[51:38] no
[51:44] the very words that they say they
[51:46] believe
[51:47] they are rejecting the very Christ
[51:50] that they say I is my boss
[51:53] to reject him
[51:55] amen Christ said with the the word of
[51:58] God said was communion in foot washed he
[52:00] said this do till I return
[52:03] amen I know he's returned in the
[52:05] fullness of the word and I know the
[52:07] seals are open and the Bible is a brand
[52:09] new book and we have all the Mysteries
[52:11] but we're not going to Rapture yet
[52:13] I'm still here and so that so their
[52:16] their false teaching was this they said
[52:19] well Christ has already I believe that
[52:21] Christ came down in Revelations he come
[52:23] down in the cloud the headship and we
[52:25] have the fullness of the word we have
[52:27] everything that we'll have in heaven
[52:29] here
[52:29] except our glorified body
[52:33] we have just as much power here as we'll
[52:35] have in heaven
[52:37] he's given it to you already it's
[52:38] already paid for you're not going to
[52:40] have more power when you get to heaven
[52:41] but you're trapped in a flesh body
[52:46] that's the difference
[52:50] amen God help us
[52:54] in six he uh speak to the Rock
[52:57] the beginning of his message he said
[52:59] we but they've come to the place of
[53:01] Kenner spania
[53:03] in the time and he said I told this a
[53:04] great judgment seat and Israel came to
[53:07] the place of kedar spania where they had
[53:10] to make a decision and it says the great
[53:12] spring well there's a little Wells here
[53:14] and perfect types of the church he said
[53:16] the church is the Judgment seat where
[53:19] Heaven
[53:20] is a great judgment seat of God but the
[53:23] little Wells represent the little
[53:25] churches all out there the judgment
[53:27] begins
[53:28] in the house of God and there's where
[53:30] judgment begins
[53:33] and here's people came to the prophet
[53:34] and said now you're preaching the word
[53:36] of God and you need to back off the the
[53:38] doctrine of women and Holiness and and
[53:41] all these different things and he said
[53:43] God called me to preach his word and if
[53:46] preaching his word hurts me
[53:49] then
[53:52] he said you tell me I'm hurting my
[53:54] Ministry when when the Judgment seat is
[53:57] the house of God
[53:59] he said see it was God's plan
[54:02] and so to hear the prophets in the bible
[54:04] it's just I I hope you'll catch us but
[54:07] the prophets saying thousands of years
[54:09] in advance you know there was prophets
[54:11] in the bible they've seen our cars on
[54:14] the road
[54:15] you know that
[54:17] amen they did they seen the Chariots of
[54:20] Fire with lightning coming out the front
[54:22] of them and going without horses and
[54:24] they were prophesied on the Bible like
[54:26] three thousand years before cars came on
[54:28] the road
[54:29] can you imagine the the the the prophet
[54:32] mind living in a horse and buggy in
[54:35] Stone Age seeing cars going down the
[54:37] road 100 kilometers an hour what's
[54:39] lightning coming out the front of them
[54:41] and steering without a horse
[54:46] no wonder the prophet said that I was
[54:48] troubled in my head
[54:52] hello
[54:54] he's like
[54:56] whoa
[54:58] but God gave that to Prophets
[55:02] now watch this God gave something else
[55:05] to a prophet
[55:07] and that's second Timothy 3.
[55:10] now we know that all scripture is good
[55:13] for
[55:14] our our all scriptures good for our
[55:17] spiritual life
[55:19] and all scriptures line upon line
[55:22] precept upon precepts
[55:24] amen we believe if it's in the Bible
[55:27] it's part of God and it's for our growth
[55:31] and our good
[55:33] and so is this one
[55:36] second Timothy 3
[55:39] verse 1 and know this also
[55:42] that in the last days that perilous
[55:45] times
[55:47] shall come
[55:49] here's a prophet
[55:51] they're seeing thousands of years in
[55:53] advance
[55:54] and he's seen the family of God sitting
[55:57] in church
[55:58] and he's seen everyone's mind watches

[56:04] our day know the thoughts and and of the
[56:07] heart and the mind
[56:10] sure he did yes sir he did so is it just
[56:12] feasible to think that the prophets in
[56:14] the old time Testament knew the thoughts
[56:16] and hearts of the Mind
[56:18] thank you so the prophets three thousand
[56:22] years ago thousands and thousands of
[56:23] years ago they've seen us sitting here
[56:25] in Wyoming and they seen your mind
[56:30] and they seen the god that you had in
[56:32] your mind
[56:36] they said it here read in the scriptures
[56:39] the perilous times will come for men
[56:41] shall be lovers of their own selves

[57:40] what laws that Canada has brought in
[57:43] and then a wonderful country like Uganda

[57:50] opposite laws the difference black is
[57:51] from the white

[59:45] about our prophet
[59:46] he went to the cave for days prayed and

[1:01:30] labor among you a really Holy Ghost
[1:01:32] filled Pastor you can go anywhere to
[1:01:35] church you want
[1:01:36] we because it's not my church
[1:01:39] it's not anybody's church it's Christ

[1:01:48] else's Ministry praise God
[1:01:51] pray for me
[1:01:53] that I'll get to that stature too
[1:02:00] we have to realize this it's not a
[1:02:03] personal competition
[1:02:04] it's not who brings the most brownies
[1:02:06] every Sunday but it's not who's the best
[1:02:09] speaker every Sunday some of God's
[1:02:11] ministers that were the worst ministers
[1:02:14] in the world God called
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:19] they couldn't speak good they couldn't
[1:02:21] they didn't know
[1:02:22] look at Dwight Moody he's eight millions
[1:02:25] of people and he couldn't even talk he
[1:02:26] spit most of the time
[1:02:29] Dwight Moody see
[1:02:34] but we're flashed
[1:02:37] but we're not flesh
[1:02:39] but we war against flesh we war against
[1:02:42] the spirits of Flesh and we have the
[1:02:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost and our soul
[1:02:47] and and but we have a white dog and a
[1:02:51] black
[1:02:53] and you'll have that white dog and a
[1:02:54] black dog until you leave this world
[1:02:58] but you will be triumphant and you will
[1:03:01] prove to Satan that the second Eve the
[1:03:05] the bride in this last day she'll never
[1:03:08] bow
[1:03:09] Hallelujah
[1:03:11] to the spirit of the age
[1:03:15] amen I I'm going to slow down someday
[1:03:18] and I have the the meanings of some of
[1:03:20] these words you can look into natural
[1:03:22] affection and we already said one
[1:03:25] possibility that it is one on one
[1:03:28] possibility one thing that it is and you
[1:03:29] know
[1:03:30] just just think of Canada and you'll
[1:03:32] understand what I mean
[1:03:36] an Abomination to God
[1:03:39] the most disgusting vile
[1:03:42] taste in God's mouth
[1:03:46] an abomination
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:54] but that's the same Abomination it is
[1:03:56] for a man or woman to put on the
[1:03:58] opposite person's garment
[1:04:00] it's the same word used for op same sex
[1:04:04] as it is for opposite clothes
[1:04:08] it's disgust and vomit and puke
[1:04:12] in God's mouth
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:18] God help us
[1:04:20] natural affection
[1:04:22] I have a quote here
[1:04:24] and and you know not that
[1:04:27] I'm just on to that
[1:04:29] forgive me
[1:04:32] but you see natural affections and I'm
[1:04:34] not preaching
[1:04:36] I'm preaching on Spirits you understand
[1:04:39] preaching on Spirits I'm not telling
[1:04:41] anybody when they should do anything ask
[1:04:43] God
[1:04:46] but another thing is not to affection is
[1:04:49] the world is fastly realizing
[1:04:53] that nobody's getting married
[1:04:55] and nobody's having children
[1:04:59] do you know the prophet said that
[1:05:01] motherhood
[1:05:03] would be lot our Prophet said that
[1:05:06] motherhood would be lost in the end days
[1:05:10] the people would choose to have a puppy
[1:05:12] dog or a kitty cat
[1:05:14] nothing wrong with them individually
[1:05:17] instead of having a baby
[1:05:19] what changed
[1:05:21] the figure of my body
[1:05:24] nope now watch this I'm not I couldn't
[1:05:27] preach this everywhere but I can preach
[1:05:28] it here
[1:05:31] a prophet said
[1:05:33] things really strong
[1:05:36] we're really strong
[1:05:40] you know the prophet said that the
[1:05:42] problems of the world was they give
[1:05:43] women to vote
[1:05:46] you know what our Prophet said
[1:05:48] that the country that's that's going to
[1:05:50] knock you out stocks
[1:05:52] everybody got to see butter
[1:05:55] that our country should have never give
[1:05:56] women driver's license
[1:06:10] and he also said that if the woman was
[1:06:11] out of the kitchen
[1:06:16] now I'm talking about
[1:06:18] mothers
[1:06:19] now there's people here that their kids
[1:06:21] are grown like Patty's kids are
[1:06:23] complete adults
[1:06:25] for our kids are complete adults
[1:06:28] and only one home
[1:06:31] but whoever invented daycare
[1:06:34] for message believe in mothers
[1:06:36] of minor status
[1:06:39] in a homosexual world
[1:06:42] I'll just tell you what
[1:06:44] it's of the devil
[1:06:50] don't worry I'm not looking for a lot of
[1:06:52] invitations
[1:06:55] our Prophet said
[1:06:57] and I'm preaching faster I had the quote
[1:06:58] right here in front of me
[1:07:00] that parents should always pray
[1:07:05] for your daughters
[1:07:07] to marry Young
[1:07:13] you know why you're shocked
[1:07:15] because of the spirit that's in the age
[1:07:20] it's called the end time
[1:07:22] now I'm going to clarify I'm going to be
[1:07:24] perfectly balanced he said I'm not
[1:07:26] talking about children getting married
[1:07:29] but he also said
[1:07:31] that my mama was 15 when I was born
[1:07:34] at born and my daddy was 18. that means
[1:07:38] she was married when she was 14. if you
[1:07:40] do the math
[1:07:41] and he said we were all kids and grew
[1:07:43] together and it was good
[1:07:46] oh
[1:07:48] let's try preaching that in a career
[1:07:49] based Church
[1:07:52] where you have doctors and lawyers
[1:07:55] coming out of daughters of message
[1:07:57] believers
[1:08:04] anything sinful about being a doctor
[1:08:06] lawyer
[1:08:07] no
[1:08:11] but the Bible said natural affection
[1:08:15] it is not natural
[1:08:17] for you not to desire
[1:08:20] a mate of the opposite sex
[1:08:24] period
[1:08:25] that's natural
[1:08:30] so anything that is not natural
[1:08:35] okay let me rephrase that so anything
[1:08:37] that's not natural
[1:08:39] and the way of blgb2
[1:08:42] or a career woman
[1:08:44] or you don't even desire
[1:08:46] or you might even preach against
[1:08:49] is an abomination
[1:08:55] is an Abomination because it is just
[1:08:57] natural
[1:08:59] for a person
[1:09:00] of a not now now listen the Bible says
[1:09:05] you will never marry a non-believer you
[1:09:08] in the Bible God never even forgive
[1:09:10] Israel for it ever
[1:09:12] they're in hell for it
[1:09:15] two cannot be equally unequally yoked
[1:09:18] together
[1:09:19] so I'm not talking about making
[1:09:21] something happen
[1:09:22] and you need prayerful fasting
[1:09:25] dedication
[1:09:28] and believe me
[1:09:30] you want your rib
[1:09:33] like I'm not talking about just flying
[1:09:35] off the handle
[1:09:37] but I'm talking when you lose the desire
[1:09:40] huh
[1:09:42] natural desire I have no desire no
[1:09:47] desire who who orchestrated marriage in
[1:09:50] the Bible
[1:09:52] God Christ Jesus
[1:09:56] so if you're 45 and you're just getting
[1:09:59] out of college
[1:10:01] you're what the prophet seen two
[1:10:03] thousand years ago
[1:10:09] ouch
[1:10:10] I hope some ministers don't listen to
[1:10:12] this
[1:10:20] there is nothing more beautiful watch
[1:10:22] this when the Bible talks about in
[1:10:24] Ephesians about husbands leave your
[1:10:27] husbands leave your mom and dad and
[1:10:29] cleave to your wife and the two shall be
[1:10:31] twang one flesh and and and he's and
[1:10:34] what's and what's Paul say what's Paul
[1:10:36] say what's Paul say and he says and this
[1:10:39] is a great mystery
[1:10:43] oh you want to believe is a great
[1:10:45] mystery
[1:10:46] it's a great
[1:10:49] but I speak considering Christ in the
[1:10:51] church
[1:10:53] now if that mystery that's great is
[1:10:56] messed up in flesh
[1:10:59] you know where I'm going
[1:11:01] is probably messed up in the spirit
[1:11:10] and that's why our Prophet said the
[1:11:13] greatest problem the church is everybody
[1:11:15] has a different idea
[1:11:20] how in the world that our God loved us
[1:11:23] so much
[1:11:24] you think it was some small thing that
[1:11:26] you know what you know
[1:11:28] and I don't mean what I've taught you I
[1:11:30] don't mean that once back I mean what
[1:11:32] God by Revelation gave you by
[1:11:34] predestination and your eyes are just
[1:11:36] the scales just fall off your eyes and
[1:11:38] you're just like wow
[1:11:41] I see God coming like like look oh hello
[1:11:51] Church
[1:11:53] Church
[1:11:56] we've lost the sincerity and the first
[1:11:59] love
[1:12:01] and you're not recognizing
[1:12:04] there's people
[1:12:08] Jesus said that no man can have it
[1:12:11] unless my father give it to me
[1:12:14] drawn the greatest event of your life
[1:12:18] was feeling the pull
[1:12:21] and when you felt the pull you should
[1:12:23] just scream and holler and jump and
[1:12:27] dance and lose your mind
[1:12:31] because I have Woods right in my
[1:12:33] immediate blood family
[1:12:35] you can look them straight in the eye
[1:12:37] brother Matt and lay it right out in
[1:12:39] English where anybody with the brain
[1:12:41] could understand
[1:12:43] and they'd look at you like a cow
[1:12:45] looking at a new game
[1:12:51] and our Prophet said ourself
[1:12:54] that there were things
[1:12:56] in Jesus Christ
[1:12:58] that you did not even need a revelation
[1:13:00] prayer
[1:13:02] and one of them was sick and see
[1:13:06] if you just read the Bible
[1:13:09] just in black and white
[1:13:11] and you can have a fifth grade education
[1:13:13] or a second grade I failed grade one so
[1:13:16] you don't have to be brilliant
[1:13:18] and you just read it
[1:13:20] it'll tell you exactly what happened
[1:13:25] God
[1:13:27] has got their eyes
[1:13:31] looking right at it
[1:13:33] looking right and the Bible says the
[1:13:35] blind's lead in The Blind
[1:13:42] and they both fall into ditch
[1:13:46] and you can see what's in this you can
[1:13:49] see this anointing the spirit that's in
[1:13:51] the world
[1:13:52] and it's trying to make the women men
[1:13:55] and the men pussycat woman
[1:13:58] and it is a perversion and it is from
[1:14:01] the bottomless pit of Lucifer hell
[1:14:06] and you need to run as far away from
[1:14:09] that devil
[1:14:10] is the the East is from the West
[1:14:14] it is puke disgusting and vomit to God
[1:14:20] that's exactly why Satan is God
[1:14:24] we are plagued with it in this country
[1:14:27] like a plague of leprosy
[1:14:30] it's worse than covet
[1:14:32] you'd have to be hundreds of feet away
[1:14:34] from me
[1:14:41] it's catching like fever fire
[1:14:48] God help us
[1:14:50] we can't run from this we need to
[1:14:53] understand it but it's what the prophets
[1:14:56] seen God showed it to the prophets and
[1:15:00] the prophets wrote it down
[1:15:02] for your benefit
[1:15:05] for my benefit
[1:15:07] and he said but
[1:15:10] but why
[1:15:15] when you get over there
[1:15:17] and the bride of Christ from all the
[1:15:19] other ages to come and you walk in and
[1:15:21] they don't you walk in from the last
[1:15:23] days
[1:15:24] and you meet Paul and John and that you
[1:15:27] imagine Matt when you beat them and they
[1:15:30] say you me to tell me
[1:15:32] that you survived
[1:15:35] the anointing
[1:15:36] that was on this age
[1:15:39] how in the world
[1:15:42] did you ever make
[1:15:44] now they're already there and they'll
[1:15:46] watch this our Prophet said that our
[1:15:49] Prophet said that I could bring up the
[1:15:50] cool fruit
[1:15:52] they're already there and they already

[1:20:17] the greatest things that was ever
[1:20:19] created in the message ranks God Bless
[1:20:23] the people that worked on that
[1:20:25] where you can go in the Bible and pull
[1:20:27] up every scripture and see every single
[1:20:29] time our Prophet mentioned that exact
[1:20:32] verse that was the greatest invention
[1:20:35] praise God I'd give my right arm for
[1:20:37] that
[1:20:39] amen
[1:20:42] the prophet and a lot of these verses

[1:20:49] but here in this one here saying Heaven
[1:20:51] a form of godliness the Divine the power
[1:20:53] thereof many people would come to the
[1:20:56] prophet and say now these people that do
[1:20:58] these things that are pleasure like
[1:21:00] lovers of pleasure and all these things
[1:21:02] well they're the Communists because
[1:21:03] during the time of threat or Prophet

[1:22:17] quote they just make you look silly but
[1:22:20] they're not sitting under the fivefold
[1:22:21] ministry they don't have a home Church
[1:22:23] they don't have a pastor that's part of
[1:22:24] the message they don't believe in paying
[1:22:26] tithes and offerings that's part of the
[1:22:27] Bible and the message
[1:22:31] but they are ever learning
[1:22:34] but they're never able to come to the
[1:22:37] understanding
[1:22:40] in the gospel of the truth
[1:22:43] God help us
[1:22:47] here let me read some quotes here

[1:23:18] going to just highlight them I've
[1:23:19] already mentioned them
[1:23:21] and wow God help us
[1:23:27] this is beautiful and this is what is
[1:23:29] going to happen in the last days here in
[1:23:31] Jehovah Jireh 64. the prophet said he
[1:23:33] said God promised to appear in the last
[1:23:36] days
[1:23:37] so Satan's come in like a fly literally
[1:23:39] hell is coming up in our country
[1:23:42] amen hell is coming up but the but God
[1:23:45] has brought up a standard against them

[1:23:49] and you'll be saved
[1:23:52] amen for me and my house I believe
[1:23:55] he said God promised in the last days
[1:23:57] that he would appear again in the last
[1:23:59] days and the form of human flesh
[1:24:03] again
[1:24:04] now this is a direct quote
[1:24:08] I'm not adding one word
[1:24:10] in your flesh
[1:24:15] God
[1:24:17] is appearing
[1:24:19] in your flesh
[1:24:21] today
[1:24:22] and you're a peculiar people and you're
[1:24:25] to to repel and to your atmosphere of
[1:24:29] the Holy Ghost is pushing back
[1:24:31] The Wiles of the devil
[1:24:34] amen you you got the whole armor of God
[1:24:36] on it like the Bible talks about
[1:24:39] to push back the spirits that are trying
[1:24:42] to engulf your family
[1:24:44] golf the cherish and golf Womanhood and
[1:24:47] go up your daughterhood motherhood
[1:24:49] fatherhood Baron husbandhood
[1:24:53] it's all coming in
[1:24:56] they talked about the the family altars
[1:24:59] the problem we have in the church is
[1:25:01] bring the family altar in the home
[1:25:04] or to teach your kids how to pray read
[1:25:07] them the Bible tell them the family
[1:25:09] stories
[1:25:10] mothers it's your duty to homeschool
[1:25:13] your kids
[1:25:15] homeschooling wasn't around when Jesus
[1:25:18] was born
[1:25:19] or or I mean I mean homeschooling was I
[1:25:22] mean it wasn't public schooling you know
[1:25:24] you know what public schooling come out
[1:25:27] you can Google it public schooling come
[1:25:30] out when the like the Catholic Church
[1:25:32] said he said give me your children until
[1:25:33] you're seven and I'll have them forever
[1:25:36] and the government to demoralize God's
[1:25:39] family God's family not the not the
[1:25:42] world God's family the government come
[1:25:45] out with it made it High Cost of Living
[1:25:47] so the wife had to leave the house
[1:25:50] and because the wife left the house you
[1:25:52] had to send your kids to public school
[1:25:54] and they could indoctrinate your kids
[1:25:56] with nothing less than the devil
[1:25:58] themself
[1:26:00] and now because the wife's out from
[1:26:02] underneath the headship of the husband
[1:26:06] and God the devil created shift work
[1:26:10] they are just passing blurs in the day
[1:26:15] and you think oh bless God
[1:26:17] he's really blessed me with this job
[1:26:22] it might have been Lucifer that blessed
[1:26:24] you with that job
[1:26:26] dude to break down the family altar can
[1:26:28] you can you explain to me how a husband
[1:26:30] and wife working on different shifts and
[1:26:33] the kids in public school when you're
[1:26:34] going to have family author excuse me
[1:26:37] and you were
[1:26:39] when
[1:26:43] yep
[1:26:45] God give you children you know when when
[1:26:47] the prophet would dedicate your children
[1:26:49] back to God and trusted those kids unto
[1:26:52] you for you to teach
[1:26:54] not the government
[1:26:58] and praise God that we that's one
[1:27:01] Freedom we still have is coming to
[1:27:03] church and the next one is we have
[1:27:04] complete freedom to keep your kids home
[1:27:07] and teach them
[1:27:09] a parent has the right to teach his kids
[1:27:12] the doctrines they believe
[1:27:14] so you can homeschool your kids teaching
[1:27:17] them the message and the word of God and
[1:27:19] the life story of the prophet
[1:27:21] and you choose by choice to send them to
[1:27:25] Lucifer huh that's that's insanity
[1:27:33] I've said here and and this is a radical
[1:27:35] thing to say but if you could send your
[1:27:38] kids to public school then I could watch
[1:27:40] pornography
[1:27:45] because that's exactly what they're
[1:27:47] getting in school
[1:27:49] and they don't have the baptism of the
[1:27:51] Holy Ghost
[1:27:55] and don't think for one minute I believe
[1:27:57] in that garbage
[1:28:01] hello hello
[1:28:02] somebody oh
[1:28:04] I think
[1:28:06] I thought I was fighting that battle
[1:28:08] alone
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:16] I don't think these quotes are read very
[1:28:18] often Flash and red light of his coming
[1:28:20] he said I can hear some of you sisters
[1:28:22] saying well maybe it's right present
[1:28:25] uh and you say oh I obey my husband I
[1:28:28] make him obey me
[1:28:31] he said but there is where you're wrong
[1:28:33] you stay home
[1:28:35] uh chastened he said I don't care
[1:28:38] and and then the person replies he said
[1:28:41] but I don't care what the Bible says it
[1:28:43] says about it you leave
[1:28:46] you leave me alone this is a wife
[1:28:48] talking to her husband
[1:28:50] amen listen sister it wasn't in the back
[1:28:53] Dark Ages
[1:28:55] that voice today he said and again they
[1:28:57] say I'm a modern woman I live in America
[1:29:00] I have a right to choose yeah you have a
[1:29:02] right to choose you could find yourself
[1:29:03] right in hell
[1:29:06] well that's no more than you live in a
[1:29:08] Hog Pen
[1:29:13] I wouldn't make a whole lot of
[1:29:14] difference
[1:29:15] here's the prophet Calling America a Hog
[1:29:18] Pen
[1:29:19] the sister thought it was a privilege to
[1:29:20] live in America because she had the
[1:29:22] right to choose she had a right to be a
[1:29:23] woman
[1:29:26] and the prophet called that hopping it
[1:29:28] wouldn't make one bit of difference to
[1:29:29] God where you lived
[1:29:31] you know Jared come down last Sunday
[1:29:33] night and he said when did they pass
[1:29:35] these laws where you could be in jail
[1:29:37] we're posting this online the government
[1:29:38] could watch our video they could come
[1:29:40] and arrest me and put me in jail for
[1:29:42] online you say and I know you'd say and
[1:29:44] I appreciate it he'd say well you know
[1:29:46] you're not Char you know you're not uh
[1:29:48] actually put there yet and that can you
[1:29:50] imagine hiring a lawyer at like 200 an
[1:29:53] hour to fight you to keep you out of
[1:29:54] jail for five years do you know that
[1:29:56] there's 69 countries in the world that
[1:29:59] that's illegal
[1:30:00] and 39 of them are in Africa
[1:30:04] Jared come down last Sunday he said I
[1:30:06] never thought I'd move to Africa but
[1:30:07] maybe it's looking better all the time
[1:30:13] here the prophet said it won't make one
[1:30:14] bit of difference to God where you live
[1:30:23] and you men that'll let your wife do
[1:30:24] that
[1:30:25] you're no longer a son of God
[1:30:28] no you kind of fell to Sodom that's
[1:30:30] right you let the women boss you around
[1:30:35] wow
[1:30:37] see it's it's not people it's the
[1:30:39] spirits
[1:30:41] man we're not against women it's spirits
[1:30:45] amen let me finish this quote I said
[1:30:48] that God what God promised in the last
[1:30:50] days to return again in human flesh and
[1:30:52] that's in your flesh like he did in the
[1:30:53] days of Sodom just like in the days of
[1:30:55] Sodom when God's going to come back
[1:30:57] again as in the days of Sodom God which
[1:30:59] was Christ manifested in flesh he's now
[1:31:03] what's in his church his bride and see
[1:31:05] they're coming together and it's uniting
[1:31:07] time in the churches uniting
[1:31:09] the church is uniting and the nations
[1:31:12] are uniting the governments are uniting
[1:31:15] and the bride in crisis United see it's
[1:31:18] uniting time that's why the U.N is
[1:31:21] getting stronger that's why NATO's
[1:31:22] getting stronger but the Bride of the
[1:31:24] true bride of Christ is getting stronger
[1:31:28] man it's going home time God the prophet
[1:31:31] said that God made a body
[1:31:33] and came and seen Abraham
[1:31:35] he just threw a guy at the body and
[1:31:38] Three Angels Came to Abraham but God was
[1:31:40] one of them
[1:31:42] and Abraham recognized God
[1:31:45] and said my Lord and two went to Sodom
[1:31:48] and today
[1:31:50] God has made a body and he's tabernacled
[1:31:53] in it and it's called his bride
[1:31:56] amen
[1:31:58] amen
[1:32:00] Amen Let me just lay this down and next
[1:32:03] Sunday we're maybe going to talk some on
[1:32:05] children and different things and
[1:32:08] I got multiple things where you know uh
[1:32:11] just
[1:32:12] just really scriptural things amen he
[1:32:15] said what happens here out of marriage
[1:32:17] he said here's another place in the
[1:32:18] Bible he said out of marriage goes the
[1:32:20] vows obey
[1:32:23] he said the meaning of obey means a
[1:32:25] keeper at home chasing of good works
[1:32:30] he said and she'll laugh at your face
[1:32:32] and go on and goes to the power plant or
[1:32:34] to somebody's office my husband
[1:32:37] and oh I doubt that he said if if these
[1:32:41] forces today such a disgrace to put
[1:32:44] women
[1:32:45] in these jobs he mentions police force
[1:32:47] and different things amen and then the
[1:32:49] Bible says that she's supposed to stay
[1:32:51] home and be chastened and a keeper at
[1:32:54] home
[1:32:55] now you know this is the truth
[1:32:59] a huge part of the message I'm preaching
[1:33:01] that
[1:33:04] a huge part
[1:33:06] but that's part of the message
[1:33:08] this is a
[1:33:10] 6306-23 quote
[1:33:12] flashing red light if it's coming this
[1:33:14] is after the seals
[1:33:16] this is the prophet We Believe
[1:33:19] but we don't read this quote
[1:33:21] because
[1:33:24] you fell into the Trap of buying two
[1:33:26] cars in a fancy house and so you both
[1:33:28] work I let the devil raise your kids and
[1:33:30] you say well I put the token over my
[1:33:32] kids

[1:33:48] but she keeps her boss's books
[1:33:52] and yours too see yes ain't that so
[1:33:55] fuzzy
[1:33:58] what kind of a man would send their
[1:34:00] wives their little cute Queen to rub up
[1:34:02] against some other man
[1:34:09] I ain't talking about good women now he
[1:34:12] said I'm not throwing like this to you
[1:34:14] Goodwin Godly women
[1:34:15] he said
[1:34:17] he said I'm talking about what you find
[1:34:18] one
[1:34:20] in this age he said they won't listen to
[1:34:22] the word
[1:34:23] he said let's keep the Bible let's keep
[1:34:25] it in your Bible
[1:34:27] he said they won't listen to the word
[1:34:29] keep this is what they tell the prophet
[1:34:31] they said you keep your Bible and preach
[1:34:33] it to yourself we don't want to hear
[1:34:35] that
[1:34:36] obey stuff
[1:34:39] yeah and you wonder why
[1:34:43] because they don't want the obey stuff
[1:34:48] you wonder why the church is the one
[1:34:49] because people won't sit on they don't
[1:34:51] want nobody wants to obey nobody
[1:34:53] oh bless God we're all obeying God but
[1:34:56] nobody's obeying anybody
[1:34:58] wives aren't obeying their husbands but
[1:35:00] they're but they're still believers
[1:35:02] their husbands aren't obeying the
[1:35:04] fivefold ministry but they're still
[1:35:05] believers
[1:35:06] and the five-fold ministry and obeying
[1:35:08] God and they think they're still message
[1:35:10] preachers
[1:35:13] ouch
[1:35:15] and they're all deceived
[1:35:18] amen but see children

[1:35:30] amen having a good name and a good
[1:35:32] testimony in the community amen
[1:35:34] these are all parts of the scripture
[1:35:37] amen but I believe in predestination and
[1:35:40] I believe that the seals are open and I
[1:35:42] believe the Bible is a new book in that
[1:35:44] but we've heard that thousands of times
[1:35:48] and it's good believe me I love it
[1:35:51] but we need some teaching on this
[1:35:53] he said before I go back he said 26
[1:35:56] women drivers almost caused me to get
[1:35:58] killed
[1:35:59] and he said he said we kept count of it
[1:36:02] and he said they made a mistake when
[1:36:04] they gave her a driver's license
[1:36:11] they put her out boating
[1:36:13] and they put her out in these Public
[1:36:14] Works
[1:36:16] he said then you women get out of the
[1:36:17] kitchen you're out of your place
[1:36:20] he said whether she's preaching the
[1:36:22] gospel
[1:36:23] or what's the difference in a woman
[1:36:25] preaching the gospel
[1:36:26] or a woman being a policeman
[1:36:29] if she's out of her place
[1:36:30] they're both wrong
[1:36:33] but see we'd like to point fingers at
[1:36:35] the denomination
[1:36:37] but we don't want to point them out
[1:36:39] ourselves
[1:36:42] amen
[1:36:44] he said man
[1:36:47] man was this is what he says here this
[1:36:50] is this is another quote he said man was
[1:36:52] not made for woman but woman was made
[1:36:54] for the man man was not the byproduct of
[1:36:58] the woman but the woman the byproduct of
[1:37:00] the men
[1:37:01] and he said let the Holy Spirit keep its
[1:37:03] sweetness through and make you a
[1:37:05] different person and you'll believe it
[1:37:08] the Bible said so now if you doubt this
[1:37:11] then read First Corinthians 11 chapter
[1:37:13] 11 and then you'll go out and find out
[1:37:16] if it's not the truth find out if it's
[1:37:19] not the truth in other scriptures like
[1:37:20] Isaiah 6 Isaiah 5 and O Mine and all
[1:37:23] through the scriptures in Colossians and
[1:37:25] Galatians where Paul was saying to obey
[1:37:27] your husbands and just like that
[1:37:30] no
[1:37:36] but
[1:37:37] he's a disgrace to mankind to let alone
[1:37:40] let alone the kingdom of God that will
[1:37:42] let you do such a thing because he fears
[1:37:46] you talking about the husband the
[1:37:47] husband fears his wife more than he
[1:37:49] fears God and you'll kick him out and he
[1:37:52] don't care if God kicks him out but he
[1:37:54] don't want his wife to kick him out
[1:37:57] that's right I'm not scolding you you
[1:38:01] women are men I'm only warning you thus
[1:38:04] saith the Lord get right with God
[1:38:09] I believe that would be a good quote to
[1:38:11] read
[1:38:12] don't you think
[1:38:14] thus saith the Lord
[1:38:17] get right with God
[1:38:20] wow
[1:38:21] but until you're born of the spirit of
[1:38:23] God in that life
[1:38:25] and that life of the devil Still Remains
[1:38:28] in you
[1:38:29] he's telling you you're not even a
[1:38:31] believer until you got the baptism of
[1:38:32] the Holy Ghost
[1:38:35] he said neither male nor female is
[1:38:38] accepted or dispelled he said we're all
[1:38:42] one in the sight of God when it comes to
[1:38:44] this
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:48] your heart is the womb and you know what
[1:38:50] I'm speaking of men and women your heart
[1:38:52] is the womb and the womb is where it
[1:38:55] holds the seed
[1:38:57] the seed of the Gospel
[1:39:01] and now what's happened is the heart is
[1:39:03] the womb and Faith cometh
[1:39:05] by an open ear that is not sealed by
[1:39:10] theology
[1:39:12] Faith cometh by hearing to hear and the
[1:39:15] word comes into the mind and you make
[1:39:17] your mind up
[1:39:19] a boat
[1:39:20] the word
[1:39:22] God's given you a free moral agent that
[1:39:25] you have the right to decide
[1:39:28] if you'll be affected by the spirits
[1:39:32] of the age
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:36] God help us
[1:39:39] amen Proverbs 22 and we're going to
[1:39:41] close here shortly here Proverbs 22 1
[1:39:44] says a good name
[1:39:46] think of this in a spiritual life
[1:39:49] all have a spiritual and physical type a
[1:39:54] good name is rather to be chosen than
[1:39:57] great riches and loving favor
[1:40:01] rather than silver
[1:40:03] and gold
[1:40:11] that's not you can put that in a good
[1:40:13] name in the community
[1:40:15] do you know the prophet when they were
[1:40:17] making deacons that they would go out
[1:40:18] and check in the community whether the
[1:40:20] person that they were going to make a
[1:40:22] deacon in the Tabernacle had a testimony
[1:40:24] that was worthy of what he said
[1:40:32] if you have a bill you should pay it
[1:40:36] if you have a dirty language you need to
[1:40:37] scrape it up
[1:40:39] amen it's a testimony
[1:40:43] experience
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:47] God help us
[1:40:53] Amen Let me I'm I'm winding this down I
[1:40:56] mean I want to close with this he bring
[1:40:59] and that is another quote here
[1:41:02] and as he's bringing the groom and bride
[1:41:05] and they come forth because it's because
[1:41:08] you're part of him and it can only be
[1:41:10] the manifestations of the full
[1:41:12] Revelations of the word of God
[1:41:16] see if we're anything diff like
[1:41:19] what's John 1 was in the beginning was
[1:41:22] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:41:25] the Word was exactly God
[1:41:27] and then you dropped to verse 13 it says
[1:41:29] and the word became flesh and daught
[1:41:31] Among Us
[1:41:32] and today you're that flesh
[1:41:35] but you're also that word
[1:41:38] and but are we reading the word
[1:41:42] but then that's part of you and if it's
[1:41:44] not part of you then you ain't part of
[1:41:46] him
[1:41:49] it's just not the one part that God
[1:41:51] predestinated you it's all this part
[1:41:54] amen
[1:41:56] and if it does something different than
[1:41:58] the groom then it isn't the bride
[1:42:00] because she's flesh of his flesh and
[1:42:03] bone of his flow and life of his life
[1:42:05] and power of his power she is him
[1:42:08] so if you're living if this word steps
[1:42:11] on your toe then you're not you're not
[1:42:13] even a part of him yet
[1:42:15] because your thought pattern and
[1:42:18] everything characteristics exactly
[1:42:20] Christ
[1:42:22] which is the word which is all the word
[1:42:27] and the word didn't change
[1:42:29] because we're living in the 20th century
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:35] God help us men and women
[1:42:38] are one and woman was taken from his
[1:42:40] side and she was taken she had taken a
[1:42:43] spirit and that was a feminine Spirit
[1:42:46] from him and the flesh is from his side
[1:42:49] made both the mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:42:52] of his wife and the spirit of him and
[1:42:55] the Flesh of him put together made the
[1:42:59] mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:43:02] in the church
[1:43:03] that's why in so many cases
[1:43:06] in so many places there's something
[1:43:08] missing
[1:43:10] because it's not Unified
[1:43:12] it's not coming together
[1:43:14] because it's under another spirit and
[1:43:16] that's intentional
[1:43:18] by the devil's
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:22] amen God help us
[1:43:25] man let me close with this thought
[1:43:27] there's something for the parents
[1:43:32] to chew on
[1:43:34] amen and let me tell you this our
[1:43:36] Prophet said this and I don't have this
[1:43:39] exact quote right in front of me but I I
[1:43:42] have it and I can get it to you he said
[1:43:44] never look to me
[1:43:47] my life is an example because I have so
[1:43:50] many mistakes in my life I don't say
[1:43:52] that to to discredit the prophet at all
[1:43:55] but he's saying I I was human
[1:43:58] and so now I'd like to say the same
[1:43:59] thing now you're going to say when I
[1:44:01] preach and say but Dale I remember you
[1:44:02] didn't do that
[1:44:04] my kids will say that
[1:44:06] see Satan will remind that to you
[1:44:08] but I was just human
[1:44:11] so I made mistakes too but now I can
[1:44:14] look back at my mistakes and say whoo if
[1:44:17] I could correct you and you could go
[1:44:20] more straight instead of curving like I
[1:44:22] did
[1:44:23] that's what the prophet did
[1:44:25] amen
[1:44:27] so when I tell you this the first thing
[1:44:28] the Satan is going to tell especially my
[1:44:30] kids is well you sure never lived that
[1:44:37] and then see then you can't get nothing
[1:44:39] out of it
[1:44:41] you know we should never call each other
[1:44:44] names
[1:44:46] have spirits
[1:44:49] we should never I'm guilty of this I've
[1:44:51] repented
[1:44:53] you should never call your kids
[1:44:56] things that they are not
[1:45:01] they might do dumb things but they're
[1:45:03] not done
[1:45:06] and you should not say that they're dumb
[1:45:08] and they got it from you because you're
[1:45:09] dumb
[1:45:12] because those are spirits
[1:45:14] and they'll grab onto that spirit and
[1:45:17] they'll accept that spirit and they'll
[1:45:19] be exactly what they you expect of them
[1:45:23] so if you say they're dumb and they came
[1:45:26] from you and you're dumb well they ex
[1:45:28] they know that to please you they must
[1:45:31] be dumb
[1:45:37] here's some short parent advice and we
[1:45:40] might touch on this again
[1:45:41] he said
[1:45:43] quit yelling at your kids before they go
[1:45:46] to bed and expect them to sleep
[1:45:49] well
[1:45:51] it's a spirit
[1:45:54] did I yell at my kids well I've already
[1:45:56] repented so you can't remember that
[1:45:57] because you have the same
[1:45:59] characteristics as Christ so it's in the
[1:46:01] sea of forgetfulness so if you're
[1:46:02] remembering it then you know
[1:46:05] who
[1:46:07] praise God for that sea it's awful Big
[1:46:10] Brother Matt where I live amen I keep
[1:46:13] throwing stuff in it the water keeps
[1:46:15] coming out brother Matt
[1:46:18] quit yelling at your kids in the morning
[1:46:20] right after they wake up
[1:46:22] and expect them to do well in school
[1:46:24] that day
[1:46:34] watch this
[1:46:36] talking about things that we say
[1:46:39] and call
[1:46:40] he said
[1:46:42] you know and I say this I say you know I
[1:46:44] failed grade one and I was I I
[1:46:46] was actually in school I'm sure
[1:46:48] my teachers wish that I would have died
[1:46:50] or something because I was a thorn into
[1:46:53] not that I wasn't bad I just was I just
[1:46:56] didn't know nothing except math I could
[1:46:58] do anything math but anything else
[1:47:00] and then
[1:47:03] God turned me how to read
[1:47:05] when he called me to preach
[1:47:07] he didn't teach me that school I just
[1:47:10] barely sleep through
[1:47:12] I can remember when I went left
[1:47:14] Elementary School and went to high
[1:47:15] school and I filled out for a four-year
[1:47:18] course a general course and my principal
[1:47:20] went up to the high school and he said
[1:47:21] are you kidding that kid's they
[1:47:23] said if he gets through two years of
[1:47:25] high school you'll be lucky they put me
[1:47:27] in the course in high school
[1:47:29] that was me
[1:47:32] the special ed if they can't do it with
[1:47:34] your hands you can't do it at all
[1:47:37] I'm telling you the truth
[1:47:39] and I was there about one month in this
[1:47:41] kid why are you in this course he said
[1:47:43] you're perfectly a four-year person
[1:47:47] huh
[1:47:49] he said you set the tone
[1:47:51] for your children
[1:47:53] now watch this we set the tone for our
[1:47:55] home
[1:47:57] and a strong home sets a tone for this
[1:48:00] church
[1:48:01] what you bring from your home
[1:48:04] is how this church is
[1:48:06] huh
[1:48:08] this is this is the truth
[1:48:13] you set the tone
[1:48:15] for your child's voice
[1:48:18] and what they'll always remember in
[1:48:20] their head
[1:48:25] is your voice
[1:48:29] God set the tone in our day
[1:48:32] by a prophet
[1:48:35] and he showed us what real Christianity
[1:48:37] was and humility
[1:48:40] I'll just tell you what brother Branham
[1:48:42] was a Christian
[1:48:44] period
[1:48:50] he said what they'll always remember in
[1:48:52] their head
[1:48:53] and you become their inner voice now
[1:48:56] watch this don't you think spiritual the
[1:48:58] prophet through God became the Inner
[1:49:01] Voice of Truth in our day
[1:49:05] hello he sure did
[1:49:07] you can you can you should listen to The
[1:49:09] Prophet at home and you should read the
[1:49:12] message and I do and you should have the
[1:49:15] prophet play by your bad side or in the
[1:49:17] kitchen while you're washing the dishes
[1:49:19] and you hate doing them
[1:49:20] maybe you hate washing the dishes but
[1:49:22] you like listening to the prophet and
[1:49:24] it'll go better what you hate
[1:49:27] you sat on the atmosphere
[1:49:29] he said you become the inner voice just
[1:49:31] think of how God's voice
[1:49:34] in this day was the prophets
[1:49:38] you become the inner voice
[1:49:40] to your children
[1:49:42] don't become
[1:49:44] their inner critics
[1:49:47] you know
[1:49:49] I can preach this part very plainly
[1:49:56] I struggled in school
[1:50:00] but my my home
[1:50:02] was a backbone
[1:50:04] when I come home I was a human I was the
[1:50:08] son of God
[1:50:09] I was the son of Iliad Helen
[1:50:13] I was no less than that
[1:50:16] but when I went to school I was
[1:50:23] see how if my mom and dad would have
[1:50:26] treated me like I was treated at school
[1:50:28] I'd never be standing here today
[1:50:33] because I'd have so many complexes I'd
[1:50:36] probably be in a rubber room right now
[1:50:37] bouncing my head around
[1:50:42] they sent me from school in grade two
[1:50:44] when I failed grade one to learn how to
[1:50:46] talk
[1:50:48] because I couldn't speak properly
[1:50:51] I'm telling you this because you might
[1:50:53] portray the same thing to your kids
[1:50:55] don't do it
[1:50:58] yeah you know Dory was total one of the
[1:51:00] smartest men in the world
[1:51:02] that they sent him home from school
[1:51:05] and you remember who that was
[1:51:08] Albert Einstein
[1:51:10] and the teacher came to his parents they
[1:51:12] sent a letter home with him just like
[1:51:14] David sent the the the the the the the
[1:51:15] the the suicide letter with the with uh
[1:51:18] helped me out with the soldier you know
[1:51:21] to kiss Mariah because he wanted to take
[1:51:23] his wife
[1:51:23] amen and he sent the letter home with
[1:51:26] Einstein and his mom opened the letter
[1:51:28] in front of the little boy your parents
[1:51:30] need to listen to this
[1:51:32] and the teacher told the
[1:51:35] the mother on the letter that the son
[1:51:36] was carrying his own his own destiny he
[1:51:39] said your son
[1:51:41] he's completely no good for nothing
[1:51:45] you know
[1:51:46] like hope he stands in front of a train
[1:51:49] uh he can't survive in this classroom
[1:51:53] and he's going to have to
[1:51:58] this is true story
[1:52:00] completely true
[1:52:03] you're not believing me I could tell
[1:52:07] and the sun's watching there
[1:52:10] watching his mom
[1:52:12] you just let her
[1:52:15] great big old crocodile tears
[1:52:19] biggest barrels are coming down her face
[1:52:22] my son says
[1:52:24] oh what's the letter saying mom
[1:52:30] and you know sometimes in the Bible it
[1:52:33] was all right to lie
[1:52:35] I know you almost fell off your chair
[1:52:37] but God never ever rebuked people that
[1:52:39] lied in the Bible
[1:52:40] like Abraham when it was his uh was it
[1:52:43] was she said it was her sister you know
[1:52:45] Abraham would have killed the other guy
[1:52:46] if he wanted to come back and ask
[1:52:47] Abraham for permission it was Abraham
[1:52:49] that died
[1:52:50] I don't even understand that myself I'm
[1:52:53] not portraying lice but the mother the
[1:52:55] son asked the mother said what's the
[1:52:56] letter say Matt this is a true story
[1:52:58] have you ever heard it before it's a
[1:52:59] completely true story
[1:53:00] and the mom said this letter says that
[1:53:02] you are so brilliant and so amazing and
[1:53:06] so Advanced and education
[1:53:09] that you are beyond the classroom's
[1:53:11] ability and you're going to have to move
[1:53:12] the classroom because you're smarter
[1:53:15] than everybody
[1:53:20] and he became
[1:53:23] what his mother said
[1:53:25] by a lie
[1:53:31] he said don't become
[1:53:33] their inner critic Speak Life
[1:53:37] speak love
[1:53:39] speak bravery
[1:53:41] speak kindness now think spiritual think
[1:53:45] of each other speak hope
[1:53:47] speak wisdom speak truth
[1:53:51] and most of all
[1:53:53] your brothers and sisters in the church
[1:53:55] most of all
[1:53:57] listen
[1:54:03] just listen
[1:54:09] wow
[1:54:12] listen
[1:54:16] speak to life
[1:54:19] we're all one in Christ
[1:54:23] speak bravery you'll make it you're a
[1:54:26] part of him
[1:54:27] speak kindness
[1:54:29] God made you perfect from the beginning
[1:54:32] amen speak hope it's almost over
[1:54:36] amen speak wisdom you got the best thing
[1:54:39] in the world ever had
[1:54:42] and the truth is
[1:54:43] it's no less than Jehovah God
[1:54:46] a hundred percent
[1:54:48] you ain't leaving this and finding
[1:54:49] anything there ain't nothing to leave
[1:54:53] but stand
[1:54:57] God help us
[1:54:59] pleasing
[1:55:04] amen
[1:55:06] and really think of those words you know
[1:55:08] and I think of them because me and
[1:55:10] Luanne are making some decisions we pray
[1:55:12] that
[1:55:13] you'll remember us in prayer this week
[1:55:15] or that we're
[1:55:17] looking at maybe getting a vehicle
[1:55:21] and we'll probably know this week if we
[1:55:23] buy the property in Uganda
[1:55:30] we really want God
[1:55:33] to know it's God
[1:55:35] we really really do
[1:55:38] for sure God knows my heart Better Than
[1:55:40] I Know My Own Heart
[1:55:43] I just pray that God will

[1:58:09] short testimony
[1:58:12] we went uh Friday to Kitchener to to
[1:58:16] have fellowship with some pastors
[1:58:18] and uh
[1:58:20] a break like him on in our van on the
[1:58:22] way
[1:58:24] so I called the mechanic and he said
[1:58:26] well just put a little brake fluid in it
[1:58:28] should be all right
[1:58:29] of course I didn't want to miss the
[1:58:31] fellowship with my brothers
[1:58:34] and we we did have meat in our vehicle
[1:58:37] for other people so
[1:58:39] we sit beside the road it'd be kind of
[1:58:41] nasty and and uh
[1:58:44] so we got the kitchen and we're coming
[1:58:46] home and our brake light came back on
[1:58:47] again and so Luanne went to work on
[1:58:50] Saturday to watch the old sister lady
[1:58:52] friend and so I went out and I put more
[1:58:55] brake fluid in it and Luanne drove home
[1:58:58] Saturday night with zero breaks or close
[1:59:03] to zero breaks
[1:59:05] called and she said honey I have got no
[1:59:07] breaks
[1:59:09] you can pick me up and break
[1:59:12] I was thankful that that was the 401.
[1:59:15] two hours from home
[1:59:17] there's a little shorter walk from
[1:59:18] brigdon than it is from Kitchener you
[1:59:21] know God cares about his children that
[1:59:25] totally cares and something else that we
[1:59:27] we are praying about is
[1:59:31] foreign
[1:59:33] if this property is to be
[1:59:36] purchased by us in Uganda I believe I
[1:59:41] will have to go there
[1:59:43] to take some money and sign my name and
[1:59:48] so I'm looking for a brother
[1:59:51] that would
[1:59:54] help me find my airplane
[2:00:00] oh so it'd be just a short trip but we'd
[2:00:05] probably be gone one Sunday just leave
[2:00:07] on a Monday or Tuesday and come home on
[2:00:09] a Monday or Tuesday
[2:00:11] I'm not I I don't like going anywhere
[2:00:15] alone
[2:00:16] I
[2:00:18] I take my honey with me everywhere but
[2:00:21] if somebody wants to see Leo's church
[2:00:24] for five days
[2:00:26] and have a rocket trip
[2:00:28] we pray that we're supposed to get the
[2:00:30] land
[2:00:32] and you could come with me
[2:00:37] God bless
[2:00:40] thank you
[2:00:42] foreign
