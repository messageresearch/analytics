[25:33] [Music]
[25:35] jedan their
[25:39] family and
[25:43] Vanessa is
[25:47] there living a
[25:51] testimony for the
[25:53] community may their light shine bright
[25:58] so bright and may they be so
[26:04] salty that it creates a

[26:40] but he's sure worthy this morning amen
[26:43] and just uh Jared and Julie and their
[26:45] family and Vanessa's out and when
[26:48] somebody's out it's a huge uh huge
[26:52] pocket amen and
[26:55] jar ask me
[26:58] uh my thoughts on it and and I
[27:01] encouraged them to go man they they did
[27:05] a they did a church in Sombra a very
[27:09] very small Church probably half as big a
[27:11] sanctuary as ours it's it's a very
[27:13] narrow church it's like a Community
[27:15] Church an independent church and they
[27:17] did a much much work on it and the
[27:19] people really really loved them and they
[27:22] wanted them to come be in their
[27:26] service
[27:28] and
[27:30] uh man just uh but I mean our our desire
[27:34] is that there could be a testimony just
[27:36] Jared's family walking in that church
[27:38] can you imagine the questions that'll
[27:40] come up why why just why man the prophet
[27:44] said that the only Bible that most of
[27:46] the town will read is your life you
[27:50] won't have to preach a word just live
[27:52] your life amen so we of these people in
[27:56] the church I've known my whole life man
[27:59] so uh just uh so that's that's why
[28:02] they're out and also remember sister
[28:04] ptty she just had a she worked in nights
[28:06] and had a hard night and and no sleep
[28:09] and she messaged us this morning and and
[28:12] just that God would bless her and give
[28:15] her a sister Patty has a hard life at
[28:17] work and at home man if you know the
[28:19] situation amen and just that God would
[28:22] show her grace and
[28:24] mercy in her life and and we really mean
[28:27] that you know I woke up this morning
[28:29] thinking you know looking at the clock
[28:31] and was up early and I was thinking even
[28:33] even when I showering I said you know
[28:35] Joseph and sister Meer they'll be
[28:37] they'll be on the road and and then I
[28:39] think of mat and Abigail next and I said
[28:42] you know you don't we don't drive that
[28:43] far to see people I mean we'll be
[28:46] disappointed if we do and and and even
[28:50] though we appreciate each other but when
[28:53] he comes oh I'm I it's just it's just
[28:57] crazy crazy good just really really good
[29:00] amen we just we just uh we love him this
[29:03] morning amen amen we're just going to
[29:05] turn to our scripture just uh
[29:08] uh just pray that you'll help me preach
[29:11] this
[29:12] morning uh
[29:15] just picking you know uh a minister
[29:18] normally has many many many many
[29:21] messages that he's thinking of or
[29:23] meditating on but the Holy Spirit really
[29:25] spoke to me something from last week and
[29:28] when uh when our brother Isaac's in
[29:30] actually just a word of announcements
[29:33] he's going to be here the first
[29:36] of October the first Sunday first two
[29:40] weeks from
[29:41] today um we have a we're going to on the
[29:44] Saturday and we'll get home very late
[29:46] and so it worked out for him to come but
[29:48] he he mentioned something about and our
[29:50] prophet and I have these quotes and and
[29:52] I I need to go fast through the
[29:53] beginning of our message or I'll never
[29:55] get to the the meet of where I want to
[29:56] go but he mentioned our Prophet said
[29:58] that we would have another Ephesians age
[30:01] and this age and the Ephesians age was a
[30:04] very mature age amen let's we better
[30:07] read our scripture I I'll start
[30:08] preaching and you'll be standing all
[30:10] Hebrews
[30:12] 121 Hebrews 121
[30:15] and2 man just as you're looking to that
[30:17] I'll just carry on that and the he the
[30:19] Ephesians Church age was very mature age
[30:22] and had a grip on the word and and he
[30:24] just you know as I studied that and even
[30:27] brother ising said you know there was
[30:29] there was 11 members in the Ephesians
[30:31] Church age and Paul Paul the greatest
[30:33] Apostle ministered to them for 13 years
[30:37] and they they were a dynamic just like
[30:39] we have the revealed word in our day and
[30:41] the Mysteries are unfolded in the Bible
[30:43] is a brand new book but Jesus just had
[30:47] one thing wrong with them amen and I say
[30:50] God help me God help me that just in
[30:53] studying that it really ministered to me
[30:55] and and you know here when when we when
[30:57] we would just read our scripture sorry
[31:01] therefore seeing we also are compressed
[31:04] about by so great a cloud of
[31:07] witness wait which does easily so easily
[31:10] beset us and let us run with patience
[31:13] the race that is set before us looking
[31:15] onto Jesus the author and finisher of
[31:19] our faith who for the joy that was set
[31:22] before him endured the
[31:25] cross did ured the cross despising the
[31:28] shame and is set
[31:31] down of the father let's just turn to
[31:33] another scripture
[31:35] here a couple more Mark
[31:37] 4 Mark
[31:41] 4 Hallelujah and we're going to read
[31:44] Mark 4:18 and
[31:46] 19 and this Parable Jesus talked about
[31:49] is
[31:51] from and 18 and these are they which are
[31:56] sowed among thorns MNS and such as heard
[31:59] the word and the cares of this world and
[32:02] the deceitfulness of riches and the lust
[32:05] of other things entered in and choked
[32:08] out the word and it became
[32:11] unfruitful Hallelujah let's turn over
[32:13] just before you're seated one more time
[32:14] sorry for Luke 123 and 48 Luke 12:43
[32:20] blessed is the servant whom the Lord
[32:23] when he cometh shall find him so doing
[32:26] 44 of the of a
[32:29] true ruler over all that he has but but
[32:34] and if that servant say in his heart the
[32:37] Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin
[32:39] to beat the manservants and the maids
[32:42] and eat drink and be drunken and the
[32:45] lord of the servant will come in the day
[32:48] that he lookth not for him and the hour
[32:51] when he be not aware and will appoint
[32:54] him his portion with the unbelievers and
[32:57] the servant which knew the Lord's
[33:00] will which knew the Lord's will and
[33:03] prepared not himself neither did
[33:06] according to his will shall be
[33:10] beaten with many stripes iniquity to
[33:14] know to do right and not do it but he
[33:18] that knew
[33:21] not worthy of Stripes shall be beaten
[33:25] very few for whosoever much is
[33:31] given of
[33:33] us much shall be required and to have
[33:40] committed they will ask much Lord Jesus
[33:42] we ask that you'd just add the blessing
[33:45] to our word and we just pray that you'll
[33:47] come and just Minister this morning and
[33:50] we
[33:52] pray and everything that's done Jesus
[33:55] name amen man you may have your seats
[33:58] this morning I'm just sorry you're just
[34:00] laying a foundation of the scripture you
[34:02] see in the scripture there's much much
[34:04] talk about this and much warning about
[34:07] this and and and we we need to be
[34:09] careful in the Ephesians Church age they
[34:11] had they had the revealed word for their
[34:13] age they had a great leader they had and
[34:16] and and were mature dedicated people and
[34:19] were on the word of God but they just
[34:21] had one little tiny
[34:23] flaw Hallelujah God help us to to
[34:27] measure up you know I I just want to
[34:29] read a quote because it was I'm I'm
[34:31] ministering this message a lot from
[34:33] Harvest
[34:36] time before he went home but I I seen a
[34:40] nugget in here right at the beginning I
[34:41] wanted to grab that we ministered on you
[34:43] know recently we ministered on John
[34:46] seeing uh son of man Son of God in the
[34:49] the golden candlesticks in the church
[34:51] ages and I wanted I I just seen
[34:54] something you know and I I when we were
[34:56] ministering I showed you or God showed
[34:58] us how that we were in the Son of God
[35:03] before the foundation of the world when
[35:05] John seen him in the church ages we were
[35:07] there and John said in Revelations he
[35:10] said it looked like the son of man but
[35:14] he was confused because the bride was in
[35:16] him amen and listen to what the prophet
[35:19] said in the meaning the other night in
[35:20] the assembly he said I wondered if John
[35:22] saw me when he saw the Nations gathered
[35:26] and Propet says did he see me he says
[35:30] surely he
[35:31] did surely he saw you now John saw the
[35:34] son of
[35:37] man how did he see you he saw you in the
[35:41] son of man it looked like it looked
[35:44] almost like the son of
[35:45] man I I thought it was I thought it was
[35:49] him but there was
[35:50] a he said surely he did if your name was
[35:53] in the Lamb's Book of Life and a part of
[35:56] Christ before for the foundation of the
[35:57] world oh that's that's that's a good one
[35:59] man thank you Lord
[36:02] amen oh yes amen so the prophet you know
[36:05] when he ministers he'll he'll mention
[36:07] different things at the beginning of his
[36:08] message and that was one of those quotes
[36:10] that that was burning up his heart and
[36:14] uh he wanted to it he ministered the
[36:18] Harvest Time and the Harvest time if
[36:20] you've ever listen to that message is a
[36:22] lot about the Temptation Of Satan
[36:24] tempting Jesus and the wilderness and we
[36:27] want to close with that but we go back
[36:29] to our Hebrews 121 and we look at this
[36:32] scripture here for for a bit this
[36:34] morning and we see in in verse two it
[36:37] says looking onto Jesus and I looked in
[36:40] my study Bible and uh and when I was
[36:43] studying this week and it it breaks down
[36:46] a lot of the words and it takes them
[36:47] back to the Greek and I want to part
[36:50] just for a second and lay help lay a
[36:52] foundation that looking part when you go
[36:54] back to the Greek I'm not even going to
[36:55] pretend to say those Greek words but it
[36:57] says from and see is the Greek word is
[37:01] the definition of that Greek word is
[37:03] looking is from and to see and it
[37:05] literally is rendering to look away from
[37:09] and he said but it implies that it is to
[37:13] give one's
[37:14] undivided attention to be fixed on
[37:19] something it's not the preacher amen
[37:23] this is the person has turned away from
[37:27] all other things in order to gaze
[37:30] intently on an object a Believer whose
[37:33] Vision should be filled is Christ fixed
[37:38] on him rather than being
[37:42] filled with
[37:44] distractions we are living in a
[37:49] world of
[37:52] destructions man the the the modern so
[37:55] science and and you know all that goes
[37:58] with it the internet you know I I I
[38:00] shared testimonies uh a few weeks ago
[38:03] when we were preaching and and uh how
[38:05] how uh and we we sold those wagons was
[38:08] one of the testimonies that God did an
[38:10] non-believable thing uh every time God
[38:14] does something it's unbelievable but
[38:16] true and we went down was an Army a
[38:19] minite man that bought these wagons and
[38:22] we were actually able to witness to them
[38:24] and and and uh it's just our world has
[38:27] fell apart it's not is falling apart it
[38:29] has fell apart and their Amy Community
[38:33] I'm not going to dwell on this their
[38:34] Amish community they are stopping to
[38:37] stopping to have the kids ride their
[38:39] bike to school because they're afraid
[38:40] they're going to get
[38:42] abducted I'm just like there's nothing
[38:45] left in this world nothing the bride of
[38:48] Christ needs to come to this realization
[38:51] that we need to go
[38:53] home amen and you you see see the
[38:56] government talking about this winter
[38:59] coming up and things uh changing and you
[39:02] know the prophet said I listened to clip
[39:04] of of his message this morning and he
[39:07] was talking about we're coming to a
[39:08] Kadesh
[39:09] Baria and you're going to have to drive
[39:11] a stake down really
[39:14] deep and it's going to be an individual
[39:17] stake it's not going to be what our
[39:19] church believes it's going to be what do
[39:20] you you believe and the prophet was
[39:22] saying he said that's what the three
[39:23] Hebrew children did when they were
[39:26] challenge they said I won't go that
[39:30] far
[39:32] period period And there's going to be
[39:35] some periods that you're not going to be
[39:37] able to be some
[39:40] wishy-washy I think God will understand
[39:44] there's going to be some periods let's
[39:46] look at some scriptures just fast I'm
[39:47] just paraphrasing First Kings 18- 21 it
[39:50] says how long halt ye between two
[39:55] opinions
[39:57] First Kings 18:21 1 Kings 18:21 how long
[40:01] halt you between two opinions here here
[40:05] here's God saying you you must decide we
[40:08] got to drive an anchor down deep and the
[40:10] world and the distractions and all the
[40:12] things that's out
[40:14] there this world ain't our
[40:16] home and we really need to lay down our
[40:19] fation and see here we see in Hebrews 12
[40:22] that was saying that we are compressed
[40:24] about by such a cloud of witnesses you
[40:26] know what it's talking about there when
[40:27] they're writing the Scriptures it was
[40:28] Hebrews 11 and it names all the great
[40:32] the great Heroes of the faith and and I
[40:35] want to I want to lay a foundation and
[40:36] tell you this they never had a perfect
[40:38] sacrifice that was just with lambs and
[40:41] goats they never had the baptism of the
[40:43] Holy Ghost and they were a lot better
[40:45] believer than brother Dale is they just
[40:47] stepped out in faith and they just
[40:50] blindly believe that someday a perfect
[40:52] sacrifice is coming and me and you have
[40:56] that perfect sacrifice we have it all
[40:58] revealed in the word of God we have we
[41:00] have a Christ Jesus a perfect sacrifice
[41:04] and we have it the word revealed so we
[41:06] can understand it
[41:08] all and do we measure up to them I'm not
[41:11] saying measure up to each other I'm
[41:13] saying measure up to the word of God
[41:16] we're compressed about by such a great
[41:19] cloud of
[41:20] witnesses let us lay aside all the
[41:23] distractions of
[41:25] leysia who Who Do You Love I titled my
[41:28] message this morning

[41:42] it rained or it snowed it didn't matter
[41:44] if I had money or didn't have money I
[41:47] thought about one thing and that was my
[41:49] bride period I slept thinking bride I

[41:59] but we're distract brother Dale's
[42:02] distracted God help me God help
[42:06] me God help we need
[42:10] blinders

[42:23] and go forward you know we've preached
[42:25] those messages you don't if you're the

[43:16] to drive down that steak either I I I
[43:19] know we a't catching the the full
[43:21] comprehension you are not catching the
[43:23] full comprehension that's what our
[43:24] Prophet said and I have the quotes in if
[43:26] I don't get to them you you they're
[43:28] right here on my iPad or or some of them
[43:30] I printed out he said they never had sin
[43:33] taken away from
[43:35] them I'm not comprehending that and I
[43:38] know you
[43:39] aren't it was just covered
[43:43] up hello and we have the baptism of the
[43:47] Holy we literally have a spoonful of
[43:49] Christ in each
[43:54] individual wow
[43:59] God help
[44:02] us here he says the restoration of the
[44:05] brid tree he said they never they' never
[44:07] seen the Holy Ghost they were believing
[44:08] for the the perfect they were looking
[44:11] forward to the promise but they never
[44:14] had never had the Holy Ghost but they
[44:17] believed in a good testimony and if they
[44:19] stopped the mo of lions quenched the the
[44:22] fire and escaped the edge of the sword
[44:24] the women received their
[44:26] dad their dad their their loved ones
[44:29] from the dad without without without a
[44:34] promise It's s a prophec it without a
[44:37] promise and oh but they look forward to
[44:40] under sheep skin under the sacrifice of
[44:42] sheep and that they divorc
[44:45] sin that it could only cover
[44:48] sin but they believed that there was
[44:52] coming a perfect
[44:54] sacrifice and they serve their God that
[44:58] good without the
[45:00] perfect and now we're sitting here with
[45:02] the perfect and we're influenced by the
[45:04] devil and internet and money and we are
[45:09] we are I am I I you shouldn't you know
[45:13] we are you know I if you listen to the
[45:17] news they talk about you know when the
[45:19] money will be gone will be digital
[45:21] currency that affects
[45:24] me maybe it don't affect you
[45:26] something else does the health Minister
[45:29] has already said in Canada that that we
[45:31] need to be wearing masks that's that's a
[45:33] lie of the devil that's ridiculous it's
[45:36] complete
[45:40] scam that affects
[45:42] me I say every time I see some of that I
[45:44] say God take me out of this word I don't
[45:48] I don't even want to be here but see
[45:50] those people lived under
[45:52] persecution and they took their stake
[45:54] and they drove really deep
[45:57] and they never had what you
[45:59] had they never had the baptism of the
[46:01] Holy
[46:03] Ghost and they never even had a perfect
[46:05] Christ
[46:07] sacrifice so it covered up their sin but
[46:09] it didn't take the desire of the sin
[46:11] completely
[46:14] away oh wow that's what it's talking
[46:18] about in Hebrews we're compressed about
[46:19] with such great cloud of witnesses it's
[46:23] like they did that and we did who
[46:28] really
[46:30] amen God help
[46:33] me God help me he said in an influence
[46:37] message he said when they looked and
[46:39] they they saw
[46:41] God sitting way up high he's talking
[46:44] about John here he said and his train
[46:47] filled the place he's seen he's seeing a
[46:48] real example here's John looking at
[46:50] Christ he said he's seen a real example
[46:52] he saw the one that could put his
[46:55] confidence in
[46:57] in amen hallelujah God help
[47:01] us this is actually sorry this is
[47:04] actually talking about
[47:08] uh the prophet in the Old Testament when
[47:10] he was looking to the king
[47:12] Isaiah and he was he the king everything
[47:15] the king did he was worshiping the king
[47:17] king
[47:18] Uzziah and he said and the King
[47:21] fell and here's
[47:23] Isaiah uh he's a prophet
[47:26] and he stumbled at that and he had to
[47:29] come to God and God showed him a vision
[47:31] he took a cool of fire and touched his
[47:32] lips but he seen a real example you know
[47:35] I'm telling you this morning church we
[47:37] have to focus on a real example let me
[47:39] read you a story that come up and if
[47:42] it's possible some of you maybe have
[47:43] heard this before if said but this when
[47:46] I heard this and I was printing it on my
[47:50] iPad it was all I could do to not cry
[47:55] the way had went on a walk and I was
[47:57] studying and by and this is a testimony
[48:00] of a preacher
[48:02] that and he said when I went to
[48:05] China matter of fact even this week I I
[48:08] listened to a few of the messages in the
[48:11] convention uh over the beginning of the
[48:13] month from yuganda you know some of
[48:16] those
[48:17] Services I just don't understand but
[48:19] some of those Services were like four
[48:20] and a half hours
[48:23] long that I mean there were they were
[48:25] still working been two hours later that
[48:28] would have lost me let me show you the
[48:30] example from China he said when I went
[48:33] to China he said we had service from
[48:34] 8:00 in the morning till 5:00
[48:36] p.m. and he said there was 22 Believers
[48:39] that came and he said I asked the
[48:42] Believers he said now what happens if we
[48:44] get caught has anybody heard this
[48:47] story thank you brother he said what
[48:50] happens if we get caught and he said
[48:51] well you'll get deported within 12 hours
[48:54] and we'll get three years of
[48:57] prison and he
[49:00] said
[49:02] wow they still count by the
[49:06] way and he said well how many have you
[49:08] been in prisoned for your faith
[49:11] already and
[49:14] 18 out of 22 put their hands on three
[49:19] years in prison for the faith and you're
[49:23] afraid to come to Faith that the
[49:24] government closes it of
[49:26] Co Believers in China
[49:29] aren't which Heaven are they going to
[49:32] the same Heaven as
[49:35] us you know all these other great in
[49:39] Hebrews 12 I'm not making this up all
[49:41] those other great Heroes that our
[49:43] Prophet said were great Heroes disobeyed
[49:45] the government in Hebrews
[49:47] 11 the government said Daniel don't pray
[49:52] period and Daniel didn't just pray but
[49:55] he actually opened his windows and did
[49:57] out
[50:00] loud we're living that it's against the
[50:03] law to preach on the street it's against
[50:05] the law to testify with the speaker you
[50:07] know you know Amplified things what
[50:11] Daniel
[50:12] do not not I'm I'm just saying you like
[50:20] Daniel watch this so they
[50:23] said he said how how many of you
[50:26] believers do you know or are under your
[50:29] ministry there was 22 came to his me 22
[50:34] and they they looked among
[50:36] themselves he said 20
[50:39] million 20 million that's with the
[50:44] N million can you think of 20 million
[50:47] people that believe this message in
[50:48] Canada in Canada 20
[50:53] million and he said
[50:56] and I checked this I actually asked
[50:58] Google the guy in the telling the story
[51:01] he said there's 1.3 billion there's
[51:03] actually 1.4 and a half billion people
[51:06] in
[51:08] China so 20 million
[51:12] said 20 million he said I had 15 Bibles
[51:16] and so there was 22 of them so he said
[51:18] seven were without Bibles and he said so
[51:20] when they got their Bibles I said let's
[51:22] turn to Second Peter chapter 1 and
[51:25] immediately Ely some of the people
[51:26] handed their Bible to the people next
[51:27] door to them and he he said I thought
[51:30] when I was
[51:32] preaching that's weird so he said I went
[51:35] to the
[51:37] after the ones that handed the Bible
[51:39] next door to the on beside or actually
[51:42] actually he did go to them after but he
[51:44] seen when he read the scripture that
[51:46] they recited the whole chapters from
[51:48] memory and he said I went to her after
[51:51] and I said I see you didn't need your
[51:52] Bible because you had it all in your
[51:54] mind can you imagine chapters not verse
[51:57] chapters in their mind he said where in
[52:00] the world did you ever get to recite or
[52:03] memorize chapters of the Bible she said
[52:07] in
[52:09] prison you have much time in prison and
[52:13] she said whoa whoa wait wait wait wait
[52:14] wait but you're not allowed to have a
[52:16] Bible in prison how do you memorize like
[52:18] you I would I would need I would believe
[52:20] me I'd need big print and like flashy
[52:23] letters and a highlighter and everything
[52:25] to memorize and they said oh no no no
[52:28] you're not allowed Bibles in prison but
[52:30] the Believers when they come in they'll
[52:32] write out little verses of the Bible and
[52:34] put it in there hide
[52:36] it and then you will memorize from the
[52:39] piece of paper and you but they'll steal
[52:41] the piece of paper oh he said oh yes
[52:43] they take the piece of paper so she said
[52:45] that's why you're intent on memorizing
[52:47] it as fast as you can before they come
[52:50] and take the
[52:54] paper I'm
[52:57] thinking
[52:59] love
[53:09] live I said so the time came he was
[53:12] there for three days the time came and
[53:14] he was about to leave them and they he
[53:18] said is there something I can pray for
[53:20] you to you know help you bless you
[53:24] before I go
[53:26] and they said you know in your country
[53:28] you're allowed to gather whenever you
[53:32] want as much as you
[53:37] want they said would you please pray
[53:41] that our country would be like your
[53:46] country and the guy said no I will not
[53:50] pray that
[53:54] prayer
[53:58] that sounds
[54:00] radical he says you see here you came on
[54:03] a train for 13 hours on public transit
[54:07] to hear me he said no this don't apply
[54:10] to this church sorry brother Joseph
[54:13] sister my or brother Matt said but here
[54:16] if you have to drive over an hour to
[54:18] church you just don't
[54:21] come think of all the Believers that
[54:23] just don't bother coming to church
[54:28] period he said
[54:31] here you sat all day on a
[54:34] floor for three
[54:36] days and in our country if a minister
[54:39] ministers for more than 40 minutes
[54:41] people would get up and
[54:43] leave he said not only did you sit here
[54:46] for three days but you sat on the floor
[54:48] for three days with no chairs and no air
[54:50] condition here in our country he said if
[54:52] they don't come and the pews aren't
[54:54] padded and the the air condition ain't
[54:55] set at the right temperature they might
[54:58] not leave but they want to come
[55:00] back cuz it's
[55:03] not
[55:07] comfortable he said in our country we
[55:10] have on the average of two Bibles per
[55:12] household or family but nobody reads
[55:16] them but in our your country you have no
[55:20] Bibles and you just copy what you do on
[55:22] a piece of paper and you don't read
[55:25] you memorize chapters of the Bible
[55:29] chapters he said no he said I'll never
[55:33] pray that your
[55:35] country becomes like
[55:40] us love you know before we go in rapture
[55:47] we may feel some of
[55:49] that we got just a little taste of that
[55:51] in a
[55:53] preeminent in our past
[55:57] history how did we
[56:01] do up J deci the prophet said
[56:04] this in the church age message he said I
[56:07] wonder if we're sufficiently
[56:12] impressed with the word of
[56:18] God I
[56:22] wonder that help us
[56:26] let's turn to Hebrews
[56:29] 11 and verse 32 and we'll just read the
[56:32] end of the chapter I'm not reading the
[56:35] whole chapter and even the verse be
[56:37] actually let's read the verse uh verse
[56:41] 31 even before it you can put it
[56:47] up
[56:53] um sorry no let's start at
[56:58] 32 32 and what shall we say then what
[57:02] shall I say what shall I more say the
[57:06] time would fail me to tell you of Gideon
[57:09] and all these people Samson and
[57:12] different people David and Saul and all
[57:15] the prophets who by faith in verse 33 by
[57:20] faith subdued kingdoms WTH righteousness
[57:23] obtained promises and stopped the M the
[57:25] Lions quenched the violence fires
[57:27] escaped the edge of the sword and out of
[57:29] the weakness made strong and waxed the
[57:31] violence in fight turned to fight in the
[57:33] armies of the Allies the women received
[57:36] their dad and raised the life again and
[57:39] others were
[57:40] tormented not esap Escape uh not
[57:43] accepting Deliverance that they might
[57:45] obtain a better resurrection and others
[57:49] had Trials of cruel mockings and
[57:51] scorning yay whosoever bonds and
[57:54] imprison M and they were
[57:56] ston saw a ther and tempted and were
[57:59] slain of the
[58:01] sword and about sheep skins and goat
[58:04] skins being desolate Afflicted and
[58:07] tormented whom this world here's Paul
[58:10] saying whom this
[58:12] world wasn't even worthy of their
[58:16] presence they wandered in deserts and in
[58:19] mountains and dens and caves and Earths
[58:22] and all these Haven
[58:23] obtained a good report through
[58:27] faith received
[58:30] not the promise of Christ the Holy Ghost
[58:34] in their
[58:36] day
[58:40] wow and God has gave us so
[58:44] much I
[58:46] wonder are we sufficiently impressed you
[58:50] know see our Prophet said that we are
[58:52] going to live he he even said this that
[58:54] in and the Leo theine Church watch watch
[58:56] what watch what I I I know you have the
[58:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's it's
[59:02] around around outside you so I I I
[59:06] encourage you to build an atmosphere
[59:09] around you watch what you're up against
[59:12] you're living in a Leo I know we're in
[59:14] the bright age if you got the baptism of
[59:16] the Holy Ghost you're in the bright age
[59:18] but in the Bible scripture it goes as
[59:20] far as Le to see in church age and that
[59:22] was the only church age in the Bible
[59:24] where Christ wasn't even allowed in the
[59:28] church now you're up against that
[59:30] anointing I don't mean you've accepted
[59:32] it of course you have it you have the
[59:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost but you're up
[59:35] against that anointing and then our
[59:37] Prophet comes and he's revealed the word
[59:40] through the the word comes to the
[59:41] prophet the secrets and he's revealed
[59:43] the word and he said in this day with
[59:45] this message of truth that we have we're
[59:50] going to leave an Ephesians Church age
[59:52] again and it's a powerful Church age age
[59:54] we we want to watch how Paul expressed
[59:58] the church age in Ephesians 1 amen and
[1:00:02] and it was tremendous Church
[1:00:06] age but they had
[1:00:09] relaxed at the
[1:00:12] end and they were not sufficiently
[1:00:15] impressed to have First
[1:00:18] Love they had everything else and I
[1:00:22] believe with all of my
[1:00:25] and that includes my
[1:00:26] heart that we're very close this world
[1:00:31] cannot
[1:00:33] survive it C it cannot
[1:00:35] survive I'm not putting a date on I
[1:00:38] think we just cannot
[1:00:42] survive you say that's radical Brother D
[1:00:46] you need to listen to our
[1:00:52] prophet he was convinced happening his
[1:00:55] day and that was a lot of things that
[1:00:58] happened since
[1:01:00] then but because he was a
[1:01:03] prophet you could see so there's no it
[1:01:07] it got so dark in 77 where people
[1:01:09] misunderstood them he got so black past
[1:01:15] 77 that a Vindicated God called Prophet
[1:01:19] scripturally
[1:01:20] based couldn't even
[1:01:22] see it was completely
[1:01:30] black and that's where you are this
[1:01:35] morning black I don't mean you are black
[1:01:39] you're in that time frame of
[1:01:43] black and it behooves us to gird up our
[1:01:48] loins and
[1:01:51] check who and what do we love
[1:02:02] would you be like the three Hebrew
[1:02:04] children when the king says you know
[1:02:05] just fall down it's not really a big
[1:02:07] deal just just you know we we we need to
[1:02:11] do this and and they say you
[1:02:15] know we know our God can save us but
[1:02:18] we're not concerned whether he does or
[1:02:20] not we're not going
[1:02:23] there
[1:02:25] what I want to tell you this morning is
[1:02:26] they didn't know the end of the story at
[1:02:29] the
[1:02:30] beginning uhuh Daniel did not
[1:02:34] know Daniel did not know there's no copy
[1:02:37] in the Bible or even our Prophet that
[1:02:40] said that Daniel knew that when he got
[1:02:42] dropped in those
[1:02:43] lights that the
[1:02:47] atmosphere they wouldn't touch it Daniel
[1:02:50] didn't know but they had a
[1:02:53] backbone comes right here from the head
[1:02:57] down and they
[1:03:02] said you cross the
[1:03:08] line let me show you let me show you you
[1:03:11] know there's so many things here here in
[1:03:13] the key to the door let me I to a point
[1:03:17] where where the Prophet said that Satan
[1:03:19] never changes his tactics and I want to
[1:03:22] show you how the prophet tempted
[1:03:25] Jesus he's tempting you the exact same
[1:03:27] he tempted me the exact same way what
[1:03:30] watch what he did first off he tried to
[1:03:32] get Jesus to deny the word I'm G I'm
[1:03:35] jumping way ahead forgive me he denied
[1:03:37] the word and then we realized okay now
[1:03:38] these are believers they actually got
[1:03:40] the Holy Ghost so they won't deny the
[1:03:41] word then he tried to make them super
[1:03:44] religious super spiritual and and go to
[1:03:48] the like just
[1:03:53] woo and then when that one happened he
[1:03:56] tempted him if you don't want to be
[1:03:59] super extreme on the supernatural side
[1:04:04] that's what he did that's what our
[1:04:05] Prophet said we're going to get there
[1:04:07] then he said well then I'll give you the
[1:04:08] whole world and you can be the head of
[1:04:10] it
[1:04:13] all and our Prophet
[1:04:16] said he sted in you the same
[1:04:18] way if he can't get you to leave the
[1:04:20] word oh like we're we're grounded there
[1:04:23] okay I'm got you with that then he'll
[1:04:24] let's let's be super like uh like super
[1:04:27] messy you know just sloppy like you know
[1:04:29] what I mean like just like goo
[1:04:32] like like just
[1:04:34] super I I I'll I'll explain
[1:04:38] myself and people would go just right in
[1:04:41] the ditch of that now we believe in
[1:04:44] that
[1:04:46] okay but he was trying to get Jesus go
[1:04:49] one extreme first to leave the word then
[1:04:52] to be sloppy in the word
[1:04:54] and then well if you won't do that then
[1:04:57] the last one will for sure get you he
[1:04:59] took him up and he said now all the
[1:05:01] world
[1:05:03] mine it was it still
[1:05:06] is and if you
[1:05:08] just I I got the power I can give it to
[1:05:11] you so I can make you a big shot this
[1:05:14] what the prophet said I make you a
[1:05:15] pastor I make you a deacon I can make
[1:05:18] you a king I can make you a ruler I can
[1:05:21] make people think you're really
[1:05:22] something big
[1:05:29] you don't
[1:05:31] change amen here he says in the message
[1:05:34] the key to the door he said sin the
[1:05:36] meaning of sin is Miss the mark you're
[1:05:38] shooting at a mark with a gun and you
[1:05:41] miss it that made me think of Jared this
[1:05:43] this morning Jared shot a shot a
[1:05:45] Canadian goose in his uh he he got a new
[1:05:47] gun and he was telling Tim about it I
[1:05:49] think it was Tim he was telling Tim
[1:05:50] about it he was he was shooting at this
[1:05:52] goose and he knew it was off to the one
[1:05:54] ins side he said he said I didn't want
[1:05:55] to shoot in its body he said I want
[1:05:57] because it makes him blow up uh and then
[1:06:00] they you know they ate him for breakfast
[1:06:02] uh and he said so I aimed about three
[1:06:04] inches from the top of its head and he
[1:06:06] said I just lowered a little bit he said
[1:06:08] I just cut its neck right
[1:06:10] off but he said sin is you're aiming at
[1:06:15] something and you've missed the
[1:06:18] mark he said you better adjust your gun
[1:06:21] because something's wrong you've missed
[1:06:22] the mark and you got to come back and
[1:06:24] try over again he said it means to turn
[1:06:26] around you missed the mark and when a
[1:06:28] Christian wants to be a Christian and
[1:06:30] you just join a
[1:06:31] church you've missed the
[1:06:35] mark
[1:06:36] amen when you just join an association
[1:06:40] or a
[1:06:41] Ministry you've missed the
[1:06:44] mark Hallelujah God help
[1:06:47] us God help us and your desire the Lord
[1:06:51] just laying a foundation the Lord God
[1:06:53] maybe we don't feel that just that tug
[1:06:57] of love like we should remember it was
[1:07:01] their first love they had no
[1:07:03] distractions when you have your first
[1:07:04] love you can't think of nothing but he
[1:07:06] said it's your desire and these things
[1:07:09] will be
[1:07:11] done as he said to John thus it behooves
[1:07:15] us or becoming to fulfill all
[1:07:18] righteousness he says here so many
[1:07:22] quotes that the prophet mentioned about
[1:07:26] being in line and in Mark and and that
[1:07:29] he you know the prophet told the story
[1:07:31] about he said he was a tropper and and I
[1:07:34] don't have this one right in front of me
[1:07:35] it's probably my iPad but he said you
[1:07:37] know he
[1:07:39] said if I wanted to catch a he said
[1:07:41] he said this what our Prophet said he
[1:07:43] said Church Believers are like this he
[1:07:46] said I would draw a hole in a hollow log
[1:07:49] and he said I would put a tack from my
[1:07:51] dad's from his dad's uh toaca tack it
[1:07:56] was a packaging or something and he said
[1:07:58] it was really shiny and he said I would
[1:08:00] drill another hole this is in the
[1:08:02] Harvest Time message he said I would
[1:08:04] drive another hole so the sunshine would
[1:08:06] come in and shine on that
[1:08:09] t and he said the loves a Shiny
[1:08:13] Toy like Church Believers if I find this
[1:08:16] quote in my thing I don't want to stop
[1:08:18] to find it on my he said that would
[1:08:21] put his hand in that hole and grabbed
[1:08:24] the
[1:08:26] tack and he would be there the next day
[1:08:28] when I come back because he wouldn't let
[1:08:30] go of the shiny
[1:08:33] toy he was completely free all you said
[1:08:36] to do is just let go the world pull his
[1:08:38] hand
[1:08:39] up he said Hollywood
[1:08:44] shines but God glows in Holiness and
[1:08:47] humility Simplicity amen we're not we're
[1:08:52] not
[1:08:54] he Saidi wonder if we've lined up with
[1:08:57] Hollywood and we've grabed on the shiny
[1:09:00] toys and we won't let go and he said
[1:09:03] that would cost saon its
[1:09:06] life because he was completely
[1:09:09] free but he wouldn't let go of the
[1:09:12] world and the
[1:09:15] distractions of the
[1:09:17] shinness God help us he said in the
[1:09:21] Harvest Time also he said the Christian
[1:09:22] is to reflect Christ it's like the moon
[1:09:25] reflecting the sun he said it's it's the
[1:09:28] absolute it's the absolute he said a
[1:09:30] Believer only reflects the Son of God in
[1:09:33] the absence of the Son of
[1:09:35] God he said it's a light of the Bible in
[1:09:38] the scriptures being Vindicated in our
[1:09:40] life it's the word that makes the light
[1:09:44] Darkness Hallelujah that's what Jared
[1:09:47] and Julie's family will be doing this
[1:09:49] morning and and Vanessa in in a in a
[1:09:52] dark denominational world
[1:09:55] World there be the light reflecting
[1:09:58] Christ that's what we'll be doing when
[1:10:00] we go to the grocery store and buy a
[1:10:01] head of lce to be the Light of Christ
[1:10:04] reflect you don't think they know oh
[1:10:06] boys oh
[1:10:09] boys oh yeah they
[1:10:12] know
[1:10:13] amen they must know or our testimony
[1:10:17] would be
[1:10:18] Mar
[1:10:20] Hallelujah God help us at this time
[1:10:31] you know it's Revelations 2 where it
[1:10:33] talks about the Ephesians Church age and
[1:10:35] then uh let's just turn to Ephesians 1:1
[1:10:39] and just read that before we go into the
[1:10:41] temptation of Jesus and and and I know
[1:10:43] there's just so much you could stop on
[1:10:45] that but here here in Revelations 2 is
[1:10:49] is uh John revealing what Christ has
[1:10:52] done onto him about the the Ephesians
[1:10:54] Church Age and and they were perfect
[1:10:58] except they had relaxed at the end and
[1:11:01] and by by the word of our Prophet that's
[1:11:03] exactly what we're living in is we're
[1:11:05] living because we've received the word
[1:11:07] for our day and the message and the
[1:11:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not in a
[1:11:11] leot to and church age and yes in a way
[1:11:14] we're in the bride age but here are a
[1:11:16] prophet saying you're actually in the
[1:11:17] Ephesians Church age but you don't want
[1:11:20] to be like them we don't to end like
[1:11:22] them we can't end like them the Rapture
[1:11:24] must
[1:11:26] happen amen watch how Paul talks to them
[1:11:28] in Ephesians 1:1 he said Paul an apostle
[1:11:31] of Christ Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:11:33] God not the will of men to the Saints
[1:11:36] which are at
[1:11:38] Ephesus the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:11:41] here Paul's talking about the church
[1:11:44] they weren't babies they believed the
[1:11:47] truth they were they were
[1:11:51] us they were us and their that
[1:11:59] Hallelujah God help
[1:12:05] us to not be
[1:12:08] distracted God help us to not grab
[1:12:11] something shiny you
[1:12:15] know when you have the baptism of the
[1:12:17] Holy Ghost that'll you'll be able to
[1:12:20] discern Christ you can't be part of
[1:12:23] Christ and not who else is a part of
[1:12:26] Christ it might take it might
[1:12:31] take but Satan can't hide
[1:12:34] forever he couldn't hide from Christ and
[1:12:37] he can't hide from Christ revealed in
[1:12:39] flesh
[1:12:43] today not all that says Lord Lord and
[1:12:46] not all that says they believe this
[1:12:47] message will enter
[1:12:52] in because in the Bible he says that
[1:12:55] many he would say I don't
[1:12:58] even know
[1:13:00] you depart from me you workers of
[1:13:05] iniquity that's not to say that the
[1:13:07] message is false that's to say that
[1:13:09] people are religious and they will
[1:13:13] compromise Satan is a Slicker he's the
[1:13:16] shiny toy sitting amongst the church
[1:13:20] people are grabbing on to and they
[1:13:22] refuse to let go Hallelujah here let's
[1:13:26] go to Matthew 4 and we'll look at this
[1:13:28] temptation of Jesus and we'll just read
[1:13:30] what our Prophet says about
[1:13:35] this
[1:13:41] Hallelujah Matthew Matthew 41 he said
[1:13:44] when Jesus was led up of the spirit Into
[1:13:47] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:13:49] devil and when he fasted 40 days and 40
[1:13:51] nights he afterwards hungered
[1:13:54] and when The Temper came unto him he
[1:13:56] said unto him Thou Art the Son of God
[1:13:58] command these
[1:14:00] stones to be made bread and here's what
[1:14:03] the prophet said in and this is the
[1:14:05] Harvest Time message he said Satan never
[1:14:07] changes his tactics neither does God it
[1:14:10] just
[1:14:11] changes the age or the
[1:14:14] time Hallelujah so we're under the same
[1:14:17] influence Hallelujah and he said he
[1:14:20] tried to give him he tried to give Jesus
[1:14:23] natural bread just like he did to Eve
[1:14:26] see Eve the first uh bride fell but the
[1:14:31] second one would never fall he said if
[1:14:33] you'll just eat this and take this or
[1:14:35] something of another he's got it and he
[1:14:38] said that's what he does to every
[1:14:39] organization and every individual he
[1:14:42] tries to give them the natural things
[1:14:44] that you can look at and take it away
[1:14:47] from and and it's taken away taking you
[1:14:50] away from Christ well look at the big
[1:14:53] churches and why they've got millions in
[1:14:56] it and the biggest in the city and we
[1:14:58] got the mayor that goes to our church
[1:15:00] and we got the all the educated uh you
[1:15:03] know he mentioned the DDS and the LDS
[1:15:05] and the
[1:15:08] phds he said that's just what Satan does
[1:15:11] the world he's trying to compare don't
[1:15:14] compare to the things of the world don't
[1:15:17] compare your church don't compare
[1:15:20] yourself to the church or the church
[1:15:23] church is but compare yourself to the
[1:15:26] word of God to the Bible That's the
[1:15:29] matter with he said that's the matter
[1:15:31] with our cets and our singers and so
[1:15:33] forth he said we've got to tr like
[1:15:35] Hollywood and Hollywood Glitters but the
[1:15:37] gospel glows it's a lot different
[1:15:39] between a glitter and a
[1:15:41] glow he said glow and humility he said
[1:15:45] God's humility glows and the believer no
[1:15:48] matter how arrogant sat Satan is
[1:15:53] Hallelujah he's offered he wanted God
[1:15:57] Jesus to leave the
[1:16:00] word of course we know the scriptures
[1:16:04] and Jesus answered him he said but it is
[1:16:06] also written that ye shall not live by
[1:16:08] bread alone but by every word that
[1:16:11] proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:16:13] God and then the devil took him up into
[1:16:16] a high city SED him on the Pinnacle of
[1:16:19] the temple and he said unto him if thou
[1:16:22] if
[1:16:23] that same Devil's alive and well well if
[1:16:26] you got the Holy Ghost you'll see it my
[1:16:31] way he's very
[1:16:34] healthy cast thyself down for it is
[1:16:38] written that the angels will give charge
[1:16:41] concerning thee and they will lay their
[1:16:43] and hands shall bear thee up unless thou
[1:16:47] Dash thy foot against the stone he said
[1:16:52] notice here that Satan failed in his
[1:16:54] first attempt and his second scheme he
[1:16:56] said was he he failed in his first one
[1:16:58] to disbelieve the word so now where you
[1:17:02] got to be real careful watch this watch
[1:17:04] what he says here he
[1:17:07] says he says now you want to be real
[1:17:10] careful and just sit here another few
[1:17:12] minutes on this part he said it makes he
[1:17:15] wants to make you a super natural offer
[1:17:18] I'm going to come and do all
[1:17:22] this
[1:17:26] just before the
[1:17:29] closing he said no you won't stay away
[1:17:33] from the word so then I'll give you a
[1:17:34] supernatural offer and he said I'll tell
[1:17:37] you what he said you can get up here and
[1:17:40] you can drive off the temple and bring
[1:17:41] it back and he said you can show off to
[1:17:44] the people see God don't show off for
[1:17:47] nobody amen it'll be a it'll be a
[1:17:51] private uh you know display you know
[1:17:54] look at how Christ when he went to the
[1:17:56] the the pool of bassetta you know there
[1:17:59] was one that was predestinated to be
[1:18:01] raised up you know they you know the
[1:18:03] same devil would say well let's go to
[1:18:05] the cemetery and raise them up that
[1:18:07] wasn't the will of
[1:18:09] God hallelujah for he said boy but they
[1:18:12] got them here he said now watch he said
[1:18:14] you watch to the end he said where this
[1:18:17] temptation comes he said maybe it might
[1:18:19] be some of you might speak in tongues
[1:18:21] and you might think you got it or he
[1:18:23] said you might even prophesy or you
[1:18:25] might even uh prophesy or interpret it
[1:18:29] prophecy he said I've seen people stand
[1:18:31] up and prophesy and contradict the word
[1:18:35] as far as the East is from the West he
[1:18:38] said it's the word that you live he said
[1:18:41] them Supernatural gifts he said Satan
[1:18:43] can handle them hand them out in
[1:18:47] handfuls certainly he said that don't
[1:18:50] mean one thing he said didn't Jesus say
[1:18:52] many of will come in my
[1:18:54] name in that day and the Lord will say I
[1:18:58] prophesied in thy name and all this and
[1:19:00] he said I never knew thee depart from me
[1:19:03] the worker of iniquity see Satan's doing
[1:19:06] the same thing in his church today is
[1:19:08] he's using distractions and if he can't
[1:19:11] use the distraction of the world he's
[1:19:12] using the
[1:19:13] distraction of the message or
[1:19:17] Supernatural things to take you off the
[1:19:20] attention of being focused intently
[1:19:23] looking onto Jesus the author and
[1:19:27] finisher of our
[1:19:29] faith how course here we say here that
[1:19:32] Jesus said unto him he said it is
[1:19:34] written again that you shall not tempt
[1:19:37] the Lord thy God and again the devil
[1:19:39] taken him to an exceeding high mountain
[1:19:42] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[1:19:44] earth and the glory of them the glory of
[1:19:46] the earth and he said unto him he said
[1:19:48] all these things I'll give you I'll make
[1:19:50] you rich I'll give you a job you never
[1:19:52] in church I'll give you a job you never
[1:19:55] even have to think about
[1:19:57] church if thou will just fall down and
[1:19:59] worship
[1:20:01] me
[1:20:05] Hallelujah a prophet says this he says
[1:20:08] Satan's third scheme he says we'll get
[1:20:11] to it quick and he
[1:20:12] said he's closing his
[1:20:15] service he says his third scheme was a
[1:20:18] Temptation and if other if the other
[1:20:21] ones didn't fail then this one won't you
[1:20:23] see he offers him a position in the
[1:20:26] church like he did to Jesus I'll give
[1:20:28] you the world I'll make you a king or
[1:20:31] I'll make you something that you'll
[1:20:32] belong to I'll give you this he said
[1:20:35] I'll make you a minister he said I'll
[1:20:37] give you a gift of laying on hands God
[1:20:39] sent it in the church all these
[1:20:44] things amen if you'll
[1:20:46] just worship me just go off the word
[1:20:50] just take your focus off of Christ
[1:20:53] and that's what we're living in this day
[1:20:57] if the Ephesians Church age had the the
[1:20:59] word for their day and they relaxed at
[1:21:03] the end and lost their first
[1:21:05] love history repeats
[1:21:08] itself when you hear the testimony from
[1:21:11] people living in China and other
[1:21:13] countries how are we going to measure
[1:21:16] up to our love our love of the word
[1:21:23] I'm not saying that you will measure
[1:21:24] yourself to a Chinese believer or some
[1:21:27] of these other people but what about
[1:21:31] your love for the word choose you this
[1:21:35] day who you'll
[1:21:36] serve is it a priority it it you know
[1:21:40] when you have your first love it it just
[1:21:42] consumes your whole
[1:21:45] body I don't believe that most of
[1:21:49] us are completely consumed
[1:21:53] we're convinced but are we
[1:21:55] consumed I wonder God
[1:21:59] wonders and it really God just spoke to
[1:22:02] me when brother Isaacson and and brother
[1:22:05] Jose's last Sunday he talked about
[1:22:07] living in Ephesians Church age again and
[1:22:10] seeing how they've relaxed and you just
[1:22:12] look at how the age that we're living
[1:22:16] in and look at the fire amongst the
[1:22:21] Believers
[1:22:28] wow are we burning up to do his will or
[1:22:33] are we building our own
[1:22:35] kingdoms God help
[1:22:38] us God help
[1:22:42] us I believe it's a question that we
[1:22:45] really have to ask because he's coming
[1:22:47] for a mature bride and he's not going to
[1:22:49] come for a bride that's distracted by
[1:22:52] whatever it would be distracted that
[1:22:54] Satan will use different tactics and and
[1:22:56] he'll study you to know what you'll fall
[1:22:58] for if you'll fall for money he'll offer
[1:23:00] it to you if you'll fall for popularity
[1:23:03] in a big position he'll offer it to
[1:23:06] you whatever's important more important
[1:23:09] in you than Christ Satan will dangle
[1:23:13] that shiny thing to you and you'll stick
[1:23:16] your hand in to take
[1:23:19] it and our Prophet said it was like the
[1:23:23] charge they wouldn't let
[1:23:26] go and it cost aun's
[1:23:31] life
[1:23:33] amen God gave us his word for our
[1:23:36] protection Holiness and and these things
[1:23:39] you know look at look at when the the
[1:23:41] the the sons of men married the
[1:23:43] daughters of Satan the prophet said God
[1:23:47] never forgave them you mixed marriage
[1:23:51] God never forgave them they never seen
[1:23:54] the promised
[1:23:57] land you can't cross the line with
[1:24:00] God this we're not we're not playing
[1:24:02] religion we're not we're not building a
[1:24:05] kingdom not our
[1:24:07] own and there's things that God's going
[1:24:09] to say you got to stop the Box stops
[1:24:12] right
[1:24:16] there and this same message I kept this
[1:24:20] quote from last I'm going to shake you I
[1:24:23] mean God shaking you sure I'm going to
[1:24:25] read what our Prophet said in the same
[1:24:28] message harveston that's about a 4our
[1:24:30] message by the way he covers a lot of
[1:24:32] hay in that message I mean he actually
[1:24:35] preaches like three or four messages in
[1:24:36] one I just took the back half of the
[1:24:39] message where he talked about the
[1:24:41] temptation of
[1:24:44] Jesus but I really believe you know in
[1:24:48] the past history of our last three or
[1:24:50] four years we've seen more happen in
[1:24:52] Canada than I personally Dale langa
[1:24:55] would have ever believed would ever
[1:24:57] believe do you know in our country in
[1:25:01] Canada but there's still ministers in
[1:25:06] prison you can say oh bless God they
[1:25:08] don't believe the M
[1:25:12] careful
[1:25:14] careful our Prophet said that in our day
[1:25:16] that ministers will give their life for
[1:25:17] this word are you willing
[1:25:20] to are you willing to drive down the
[1:25:24] state or are you going to
[1:25:28] bend Under
[1:25:30] Pressure if you looking for an example
[1:25:33] look at all the the heroes in Hebrews
[1:25:39] 11 They're Your
[1:25:41] Heroes who's your hero
[1:25:47] today in studying this week you know the
[1:25:50] prophet said of course we know this
[1:25:52] whole world is Satan's domain he owns
[1:25:55] this world
[1:25:57] 100% don't fall in love with it too
[1:26:01] much he ain't giving it to
[1:26:05] you
[1:26:07] amen this isn't the Harvest Time message
[1:26:11] right before in
[1:26:13] December of 64 about an hour before he
[1:26:16] left and he said he he he in 281 he says
[1:26:21] he says I'm a Christian what what church
[1:26:24] do you belong to he said I was born a
[1:26:27] brandom and he said I've always be a
[1:26:29] brandom it's talking about your birth
[1:26:34] Christ you were born in the family of
[1:26:36] God you were actually born in the family
[1:26:38] of God before the foundation of the
[1:26:39] world and John seen you in Christ in the
[1:26:42] church ages and Revelations but you he
[1:26:45] had to come and and take back what the
[1:26:47] what had been robbed from you in your
[1:26:50] flesh life and redeem you back and he
[1:26:53] justified you now you watch it Justified
[1:26:55] you know what the prophet said to that
[1:26:56] you never really sinned wasn't the real
[1:26:59] it wasn't
[1:27:00] you it was this but this ain't
[1:27:03] me this ain't me Justified as if you
[1:27:07] never did it in the first place you know
[1:27:08] the prophet said in studying this week
[1:27:10] he said he came to redeem back those
[1:27:12] that were
[1:27:13] already in
[1:27:15] him you don't get no better than that he
[1:27:18] knew the world wouldn't accept him so
[1:27:20] the ones that were already his he
[1:27:21] already them he just was well I'm just
[1:27:24] taking them
[1:27:27] back W Hallelujah that should just raise
[1:27:32] you up watch what he says here in 82 he
[1:27:34] said notice Eve she met uh Eve met her
[1:27:39] and so did the second Eve met he at Nan
[1:27:43] Rome and they gave it to the
[1:27:45] denominational Creeds and accept the
[1:27:47] dogmas instead of the word now this is
[1:27:49] in Harvest Time this is right here on
[1:27:51] the pulpit if anybody wants to read this
[1:27:53] I advise you to fasten your seat
[1:27:56] belts he says they've taken down the
[1:27:58] Pagan Idols like Jupiter and so forth
[1:28:02] and they put up Idols like Paul and
[1:28:04] Bernard Barn
[1:28:06] barus see God remember we preached on
[1:28:09] the
[1:28:10] tools God don't expect you to worship
[1:28:12] the
[1:28:14] tools this is the prophet of tul telling
[1:28:17] you don't worship
[1:28:19] me he said they took down Jupiter and so
[1:28:22] forth and they put up Paul and barnas
[1:28:24] and he said they took down the sun gods
[1:28:27] and and the moon gods and he names some
[1:28:30] of these and the moon God and around I
[1:28:32] can't even say the words of them and
[1:28:34] made her being a mother of the sun god
[1:28:37] which was Jupiter and they changed the
[1:28:39] birthday of Jesus I'm I'm reading
[1:28:42] exactly what your Prophet says and they
[1:28:44] changed the birthday of Jesus from April
[1:28:47] to where all nature and so forth where
[1:28:50] he was born under the ram and cause
[1:28:53] because he was a ram
[1:28:55] changed changed that up to the sun God's
[1:28:59] birthday in a solar there where it makes
[1:29:02] it one day and there's just one minute
[1:29:05] difference between the day and when it's
[1:29:08] passing into the 25th day of December
[1:29:11] the son God's birthday not the Son of
[1:29:14] God but the son as you in every one of
[1:29:18] you play Santa Claus and decorate your
[1:29:22] trees it's heathenism and things like
[1:29:25] that and they call themselves
[1:29:32] Christians what's the matter with you
[1:29:36] Christian
[1:29:38] Believers that's paragraph 182
[1:29:44] 282 oh I don't like that
[1:29:47] part well he didn't finish there well
[1:29:50] there'll raise up somebody Among Us who
[1:29:53] can preach the word and tell the
[1:29:55] truth and God vindicate and prove it to
[1:29:58] the people that he's the same yesterday
[1:30:01] today and forever and you don't need
[1:30:03] some
[1:30:04] cemetery and you don't need some
[1:30:07] theology we need somebody that will
[1:30:10] stick to the word a prophet that's right
[1:30:13] and God promised to do it and he said
[1:30:16] there where Eve failed so Eve failed so
[1:30:20] did do so did the church and they gave
[1:30:23] way to their denominational rules of
[1:30:27] men and they were ruled by men and not
[1:30:32] controlled by the holy
[1:30:35] spirit
[1:30:37] anymore let's
[1:30:39] stand amen you know as much as our Bible
[1:30:44] teaches us fivefold Ministry not we're
[1:30:47] not worshiping the fful ministry we're
[1:30:49] not worshiping a good pastor or or a
[1:30:51] bake name church or we're not even
[1:30:53] worshiping the prophet all these things
[1:30:56] but look at into Hebrews 122 looking on
[1:31:00] to Jesus your in your your your complete
[1:31:05] attitude was to be focused on Christ
[1:31:09] Christ avoiding all
[1:31:13] distractions
[1:31:15] amen
[1:31:17] love who or what is your love
[1:31:23] Satan will try to just pull it you know
[1:31:25] we preached that message just a few
[1:31:29] months ago about being
[1:31:31] radical and when if you're not careful
[1:31:35] Satan knows the word he knows the
[1:31:40] message and many times when Satan will
[1:31:42] come to you he'll say preach the message
[1:31:45] in balance and what he means is
[1:31:50] compromise
[1:31:52] that's what he means
[1:31:56] compromise our Prophet clearly stated
[1:31:59] strongly
[1:32:00] stated that
[1:32:02] Eve was one
[1:32:06] word one word
[1:32:10] not one three-letter word not surely
[1:32:15] die but God said you would surely
[1:32:20] die and God help us if we're going to
[1:32:24] believe the truth and we're going to
[1:32:26] believe the right I've said this years
[1:32:28] ago I said this when we started the
[1:32:29] church I said if we're going to look
[1:32:31] like the church next door let's just go
[1:32:34] there it'll be
[1:32:37] easier but the Bible says to be
[1:32:40] peculiar to stand out not arrogant I
[1:32:44] don't say arrogant but peculiar humble
[1:32:47] you and people will look at you and go
[1:32:49] whoa what is
[1:32:53] you know we've got so far from the truth
[1:32:56] that when the truth presents itself
[1:32:58] people don't even know what it is you
[1:33:00] know my my my son Brent that's not here
[1:33:02] in Fellowship right now today yet you
[1:33:05] know the girls there all wear their
[1:33:07] skirts and and and he's all over the
[1:33:09] Internet the things and here here he's
[1:33:12] out of fellowship with God and he's
[1:33:13] preaching every
[1:33:16] day God's got a sense of humor he's
[1:33:19] preaching every day he thinks he's
[1:33:20] avoiding God but he's preaching every
[1:33:21] day justifying the the girls in in
[1:33:24] California ask them if that was forced
[1:33:25] on them by dress code they don't even
[1:33:28] know what a dress is like it's brother
[1:33:30] can you believe that like like
[1:33:33] dress listen you dressed up for
[1:33:36] Halloween you were
[1:33:41] dressed how did we get that far I'll
[1:33:44] tell you how we got that
[1:33:45] far we let down the bars and the goats
[1:33:48] got
[1:33:50] in and now how it's been accepted for so
[1:33:54] long it's been accepted for so long that
[1:33:57] when you take a
[1:33:58] stand you're
[1:34:01] radical you're
[1:34:03] radical
[1:34:04] radical a radical Hebrews
[1:34:07] 11 every one of those Heroes of
[1:34:11] Faith were hands down
[1:34:14] radicals radicals and a lot of
[1:34:17] them that radicals they didn't who told
[1:34:22] Daniel that he must pray out loud and
[1:34:24] open the windows God
[1:34:26] never but he refused to change his
[1:34:29] lifestyle for a
[1:34:32] government
[1:34:33] refuse I
[1:34:36] refuse let me ask you
[1:34:38] this if you get caught what happens to
[1:34:43] us you get deported in 12
[1:34:49] hours and I get three years in
[1:34:54] prison would you have went to church
[1:34:56] that
[1:35:01] morning I'll tell you what if you would
[1:35:05] have went to church that
[1:35:06] morning you would have been in a lot of
[1:35:08] prayer that
[1:35:11] week a lot more prayer than I was in
[1:35:13] this
[1:35:16] week this message probably was not for a
[1:35:19] single person in here but for
[1:35:24] God help
[1:35:25] me God help
[1:35:28] me not to accept the bend so much that
[1:35:32] when you see something straight you
[1:35:34] don't even
[1:35:35] recognize it it's being
[1:35:39] real anything God
[1:35:41] valued he
[1:35:44] hid public show Hollywood we're going to
[1:35:49] show the world lots of spiritual gifts
[1:35:53] you don't know God at
[1:35:55] all he hid the diamonds he hid the gold
[1:35:58] hid the silver he buried
[1:36:01] everything he hid
[1:36:03] Holiness he hid
[1:36:07] everything and the disciples came to him
[1:36:09] and said why do you preaching
[1:36:11] Parables you know I had
[1:36:14] somebody acquainted with the message and
[1:36:18] it's not here and you know in you know
[1:36:22] watch Satan watch
[1:36:24] Satan I'm closing in
[1:36:28] Revelations when it says that when the
[1:36:30] seventh angel begins to sound the
[1:36:31] Revelation period of God will be
[1:36:35] finished that Revelation is who God is
[1:36:39] the anointed one Christ
[1:36:41] Jesus amen Revelation period the person
[1:36:44] asked me he said well see we still have
[1:36:46] more Revelations to
[1:36:48] come because when that seventh angel
[1:36:50] came he just
[1:36:52] revealed just one for the
[1:36:56] one but you know God has a sense of
[1:36:59] humor as I looked in the scripture I
[1:37:02] realized that Jesus said that it was
[1:37:06] revealed to you and to them it wasn't
[1:37:10] given said why do you preach in Parables
[1:37:13] and Mysteries and he says because to
[1:37:16] them it's not given but unto you to know
[1:37:20] the
[1:37:22] Mysteries with an
[1:37:25] S
[1:37:27] plurals
[1:37:30] amen and we've been given so
[1:37:34] much wow so much God help us we're
[1:37:39] compressed about by such a cloud of
[1:37:41] witnesses how will we measure
[1:37:45] up with the perfect sacrifice and the
[1:37:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost God help us to
[1:37:51] put our stake down deep I challenge you
[1:37:54] drive your steak down if it's worth
[1:37:56] serving God choose you this day who you
[1:38:00] will serve I won't back up I'll go down
[1:38:04] serving this God and this truth and this
[1:38:07] message
[1:38:08] with amen hallelujah God help
[1:38:14] us amen what are you
[1:38:17] playing amen yeah just stand

[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:59] the time to look around
[1:39:04] me I see the sign of his appearing
[1:39:12] everywhere the things he said would come
[1:39:17] to pass are now before us
[1:39:22] and I can see a strange excitement in
