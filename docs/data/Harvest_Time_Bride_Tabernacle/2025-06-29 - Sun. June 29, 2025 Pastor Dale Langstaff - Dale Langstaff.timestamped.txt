[0:04] Lord to bless them wherever they are and
[0:06] I know this weekend was the Ottawa camp
[0:09] and just it'll be winding up I think
[0:11] today but just uh just pray that uh good
[0:14] things uh the Lord has really used that
[0:16] wonderfully. Amen. So amen. We'll just
[0:19] ask uh brother Junior to come and open a
[0:22] word of prayer and just invite him in
[0:24] our midst this morning. Amen.
[0:34] Praise the Lord.
[0:36] Hallelujah. Just lift your hands above
[0:38] your head. Just give the Lord a hearty
[0:40] praise. Hallelujah. He's worthy to be
[0:43] praised. He's worthy to be praised.
[0:46] Hallelujah. Let us all bow our hearts
[0:48] reverence in prayer. Let us approach
[0:50] your heart and finish up our faith.
[0:52] Divine Father, Lord, as we come in your
[0:56] presence once more again, Father, we
[0:59] want to give you thanks, Lord. Father,
[1:01] we want to acknowledge your presence
[1:03] with us this morning, Father. Lord, as
[1:06] we come this morning, Lord God, let self
[1:09] be slain, Father. Lord God, let our
[1:12] imagination be brought down this
[1:15] morning, Father, in the name of Jesus.
[1:19] Father, we pray right now, Father, that
[1:21] you may come and bless this service,
[1:24] Lord. Bless the songs and the scripture.
[1:27] Father, bless your servant, Lord. May
[1:31] you anoint him, Father, and use him in a
[1:34] mighty way, Lord God. Even the vessel
[1:37] that you you will use to bring the word,
[1:39] Father. Lord God, may you use him in a
[1:42] mighty way in the name of Jesus. Father,
[1:46] let every heart that is present this
[1:48] morning, Father, ready to receive your
[1:51] word, Father. Lord, we want to thank
[1:53] you, Lord God, for what you're doing in
[1:56] this age and time, Lord God, in this
[1:59] last days that we're in, Father. And
[2:02] Lord, as a prophet said, when we come
[2:04] together, we must cherish these moments,
[2:07] Father. Lord God, we thank you for the
[2:10] prophecy. We thank you for the unveiling
[2:12] of the word in our day, Lord God, that
[2:15] we can stand upon your word, Father. And
[2:18] Father, we thank you, Lord God, for the
[2:21] moving of the light, Father. And the
[2:23] light is moving today, Father, in this
[2:26] Asian time, Lord God. And Father, Lord
[2:29] God, may you bless every person tonight,
[2:31] this today, Lord. Bless those that are
[2:34] not here, Father. May you visit them
[2:36] Lord God like you visit Abraham when he
[2:39] was there at Mamry. Father Lord God may
[2:42] you visit your people Father in the name
[2:44] of Jesus. Lord God and Father make we
[2:48] recognize the day of our visitation
[2:51] father. Hallelujah. In the name of
[2:54] Jesus. Lord God every spirit be on the
[2:57] subjection this morning father as we
[3:00] give you all the glory and the thanks
[3:01] Lord. And what we fail to ask this
[3:04] morning, fail not to grant it, Lord, in
[3:07] the name of Jesus, as we say, amen.
[3:11] Praise the Lord. Praise his name.
[3:14] Amen. Thank you, Jesus.

[24:16] are here that's drove many hours or
[24:19] miles, Lord God, to come.
[24:23] Lord, may you meet every need
[24:26] represented here this morning. And we
[24:28] put Satan under our feet this morning in
[24:31] Jesus Christ's name. We love you and
[24:34] adore you. And may you speak through
[24:36] your word, Lord God, and through the
[24:38] minister to to to bless your people in
[24:43] this time in this day. We pray.
[24:46] Hallelujah.
[24:48] We pray you'll hear our humble cry.
[24:52] Your word says you'll never leave us nor
[24:54] forsake us.
[24:57] We love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you.
[24:59] Thank you, Jesus.
[25:02] Hallelujah.
[25:04] Hallelujah. He's wonderful.
[25:08] Our Lord and Savior is wonderful this
[25:10] morning. Amen. God bless you. God bless
[25:13] you all and just God bless our visitors
[25:15] and you're very very very welcome and
[25:19] just look forward to fellowship after
[25:21] service. Let's turn to our scriptures to
[25:23] second Peter 3:9. We're going to carry
[25:26] on our topic from last week completely.
[25:29] I very very seldom preach
[25:33] uh more than one message in the same
[25:35] topic a series but but God uh has his
[25:40] perfect will and way. Second Peter 3
[25:43] and9.
[25:48] I believe
[25:51] with these messages
[25:53] that the Holy Spirit is trying to get us
[25:57] to pick up on something that we've maybe
[26:00] made the message something
[26:03] that the Holy Spirit didn't.
[26:06] And we maybe made the message, what we
[26:08] say is the message and it's the truth
[26:11] and it's the revealed word of God, but
[26:13] we maybe made it something that our
[26:16] prophet never. I will guarantee you
[26:21] before we leave tonight, I'm going to
[26:22] read quotes
[26:24] that will shock you of what our prophet
[26:27] said. And I I'll also guarantee you that
[26:30] there's probably zero churches in the
[26:32] message that are preaching
[26:35] what the prophet said in those quotes.
[26:40] We might have a different idea of grace
[26:44] than what the Holy Spirit did.
[26:47] And the Lord was not slack concerning
[26:49] his promises, as some men count
[26:52] slackness, but longsuffering toward us,
[26:57] not willing that any should perish, but
[27:01] that all
[27:02] should come to repentance. Lord Jesus, I
[27:05] pray that you will reveal your thoughts
[27:08] and your heart to the people like you
[27:11] did to me, Lord Jesus. And we'll give
[27:13] you the glory and honor for it. In your
[27:16] beautiful name we pray. Amen. You may
[27:17] have your seats.
[27:21] Amen.
[27:23] God was not willing that any should
[27:25] perish, but that all should come to
[27:28] repentance. Now you'll see that
[27:30] scripture that he does not slack
[27:34] concerning his promises. You know we
[27:37] have many many promises in the Bible
[27:40] especially as parents that we can claim
[27:43] our children and put the token over them
[27:45] and our our lost loved ones and
[27:47] different ones like this. And we want to
[27:50] just jump to Revelation 7. And I want to
[27:54] read some things here and show you some
[27:55] things that the prophet said about the
[27:57] tribulation and about the uh the
[28:00] multitude with the white robes. And it
[28:03] it I I would believe in many cases, you
[28:05] know, it will surprise us. And and I
[28:08] believe if we're going to er
[28:12] on the side of mercy, we should heir on
[28:15] the side of grace. If you're going to
[28:16] make a mistake this morning, give too
[28:19] much mercy. If you're going to make a
[28:22] mistake this morning, offer too much
[28:24] grace than what the Holy Spirit wanted.
[28:27] Amen. And he will see your heart
[28:31] and judge you accordingly.
[28:35] But if you get lifted up in yourself
[28:39] and you have a judgmental spirit,
[28:43] God will show you like he did our
[28:45] prophet your sins when he saved you.
[28:48] Amen. Remember when the prophet went to
[28:51] the restaurant and he was condemning the
[28:54] woman with the policeman and God had to
[28:56] give him a vision and move him behind
[28:58] the door and showed him his vision, the
[29:01] vision of what he looked like.
[29:05] Sometimes Christians have a really bad
[29:07] memory.
[29:09] You were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[29:12] and you come to the world telling lies.
[29:15] [Music]
[29:16] Come on. And you don't give grace to
[29:18] somebody else that's still in that
[29:20] state.
[29:21] God have mercy on me. And God have mercy
[29:25] on you. That's right. You just came to
[29:28] the greater revelation quicker than your
[29:31] other brother and sister.
[29:33] We're all at a different spot of
[29:35] revelation. We got We're blessed beyond
[29:38] measure. Not all are though.
[29:42] Yet. Amen.
[29:46] Revelation 7:9. And after this I beheld,
[29:50] and lo, a great multitude, which no man
[29:54] could number
[29:55] of all nations and kindreds and people
[29:58] and tongues. And they stood before the
[30:01] throne and before the lamb clothed in
[30:04] white robes.
[30:06] And the psalm the palms were in their
[30:08] hands. And they cried with a loud voice
[30:11] saying, "Savior to our God which siteth
[30:15] upon the throne and unto the lamb."
[30:19] Excuse me. Verse 13. And one of the
[30:22] elders answered me, saying, He said,
[30:24] "What are these which are way a raid?
[30:29] and white robes. We're going to look
[30:31] into this. You know, John didn't know
[30:33] who they were. John wrote Revelations.
[30:36] You see, John was a Jew and he
[30:38] recognized the Christian Jews. He
[30:41] recognized the 12 tribes of Jacob. He
[30:43] would have recognized his own people,
[30:45] but he didn't recognize these people.
[30:47] But they were given the olive branch of
[30:50] grace.
[30:53] Said, "Who are these?" Yeah. Who are
[30:56] these that came through the great
[30:58] tribulation?
[31:00] Uh-oh.
[31:02] We always believed
[31:05] in many places. It's been taught
[31:09] that it was a foolish version.
[31:12] And our prophet said that some places,
[31:15] but he said other things, too. And what
[31:17] are we going to do with them?
[31:19] And on to the lamb.
[31:27] And hence cometh they in verse 14. And I
[31:29] said unto him, sir, knowest thou not?
[31:32] And he said unto me, These are they
[31:34] which came through the great
[31:36] tribulation, which have had their robes
[31:38] washed, and made them white by the blood
[31:42] of the lamb.
[31:45] For the lamb was in the midst of the
[31:46] throne, and shall feed them and shall
[31:48] lead them. Verse 17, and onto the
[31:50] fountains of water. and God shall wipe
[31:53] away their tears from their eyes.
[31:57] Now, you know, many places in the
[31:59] message, and I'm not trying to change
[32:01] anything. I'm just going to read what
[32:02] the prophet Vicky will put the quote up
[32:04] here below. But this quote here is from
[32:07] Revelation 7:9. And these are things
[32:10] that the prophet said
[32:13] about these scriptures.
[32:15] See, John being a Jew didn't recognize
[32:18] every one of them. He had seen the 12
[32:19] tribes of Israel, the 12,000 out of
[32:22] every tribe.
[32:24] Amen.
[32:27] And they were not the church. They were
[32:30] sorry. John recognized the 144,000. Yes.
[32:35] But these were not the the Jews. The
[32:39] Bible said these
[32:41] were Israel. But watch here. We jump
[32:43] down to another paragraph. He said,
[32:45] "After this, here comes the bride.
[32:49] Wait a minute. The bride came through
[32:52] the tribulation.
[32:54] Prophet said some did here
[32:57] and after this now comes the bride.
[33:00] After this I held up the great multitude
[33:02] that no man can number. And he said
[33:04] watch here at the end of this paragraph
[33:06] this quote. He said there's your temple
[33:08] unics. See the Jews were always servants
[33:11] in heaven. You are considered the bride
[33:14] of Christ. You're the queen in heaven.
[33:16] So you're not the one that's vacuuming
[33:18] the floor of the pearly gates.
[33:23] He said, "There's the Unix. They were
[33:25] the 144,000,
[33:29] just a little temple guard, the Jews,
[33:32] but they're going to be with the bride.
[33:36] They're going to be her escort."
[33:39] And the 144,000 is the escort to the
[33:43] bride, the temple Unix. Look, I want to
[33:46] just go to the next quote there,
[33:48] questions and answers. And watch what he
[33:51] said. He said there, watch here for us.
[33:52] He said, we come over back in verse 14.
[33:55] Verse 14's talking about the
[33:56] tribulation. And it says, why with the
[33:59] bride wherever they are? Absolutely.
[34:03] He said, the unics travel with the
[34:05] queen.
[34:08] I'm going to drop to the next paragraph.
[34:10] He said, "Notice, and after this, a
[34:12] great multitude that no man could number
[34:14] and no people or no tongue." He said,
[34:17] "There's your gentile bride coming up
[34:21] right there."
[34:24] You see, you thought you had to go in
[34:26] the rapture to be a part of the bride.
[34:29] But your prophet never said that.
[34:33] That was your own idea. Yeah, I believe
[34:37] many of the bride will go in the
[34:38] rapture, but our prophet said the
[34:41] rapture would be so small that it
[34:42] wouldn't even be missed.
[34:44] And so you think the people that miss
[34:46] the rapture are outside of grace? It's
[34:48] not at all what he taught.
[34:52] He said, "There's the gentile bride
[34:54] coming up, all right, and they stood
[34:56] before their lamb, and there's their
[34:57] savior, the lamb." He said, "That's not
[35:00] law.
[35:01] That's the lamb grace.
[35:07] God help us. One more script uh quote in
[35:11] the Christ the mystery of God revealed
[35:15] here. He said the great ransom body came
[35:17] all through the ages comes up and it's
[35:19] going to be the the great throne there.
[35:22] Revelation 7, it expresses this and this
[35:25] great number that no man could number
[35:27] through the ages that comes up there
[35:30] that walk in the light of the Bible as
[35:32] far as it is revealed to them.
[35:36] And he finishes that quote and he said,
[35:38] "Now Christ and the church are being
[35:40] made known and the whole thing is a
[35:43] revelation of God that God's taken Eve
[35:46] back to her rightful position
[35:49] and again with her husband." Notice and
[35:52] God and her husband with the church.
[35:56] It's the church, his bride.
[36:00] Wow. You know, the Bible says, "Let
[36:02] everything be established by two or
[36:04] three witnesses." And see, you know, we
[36:07] have to be careful that we if we see
[36:09] somebody in a different revelation than
[36:12] what we're at, a different level
[36:14] spiritually than what we are, we just
[36:17] put sinner tag on them. Come on. But our
[36:20] prophet never did that. No. I just
[36:23] showed you three quotes
[36:25] where the prophet said that there will
[36:26] be some of the bride
[36:29] come through the tribulation.
[36:32] But he totally thought that the bride
[36:35] would go in the rapture.
[36:39] Amen.
[36:40] He said, "Watch watch how Yeah. I I I
[36:43] believe sometimes that we've come so far
[36:45] in revelation that we forgot the most
[36:48] important thing.
[36:50] He said, "Let's take the simplicity of
[36:53] God that has placed us here, us here,
[36:58] and use it to win souls for Christ."
[37:02] What's the very most important thing you
[37:04] can do? I I'm going to shock you. I'm
[37:06] going to make you fall down. It's not
[37:08] witness the message to anybody.
[37:13] I'm going to prove that the last quote
[37:15] where brother well maybe even here
[37:17] brother Brown says it well right close
[37:19] we're going to get to it he says it
[37:21] wouldn't matter a a bet
[37:24] your baptism
[37:27] that's not what brother Dale said that's
[37:28] what the prophet said
[37:30] now we of course he taught that you
[37:32] should be baptized in the name of the
[37:34] Lord Jesus Christ what let's let's just
[37:36] jump into this he said we need the fire
[37:38] of God the love in our hearts that we
[37:42] can get warned by some historical
[37:44] doctrine. You know, many churches, it's
[37:47] all they're preaching is the doctrine.
[37:49] Just give them the doctrine. The
[37:51] doctrine won't save anybody.
[37:54] There'll be lots of people in hell with
[37:56] doctrine, message doctrine. We'll be in
[37:59] hell. Come on now. But we've got to have
[38:02] the Holy Ghost now. And they went for
[38:04] only with one objective. That's right.
[38:07] One objective. That was their only
[38:09] objective. to win souls for Christ.
[38:12] That's right. One motive. Love. Love.
[38:16] That's all. That's right.
[38:19] Their motive wasn't to get them to a
[38:21] message church. It was to win souls for
[38:25] Christ.
[38:26] And one motive, love.
[38:30] One love.
[38:33] That's right.
[38:37] He said, "How we see a group of people
[38:39] here that's just anointed by the Holy
[38:41] Spirit and you go in there and there's
[38:43] just something happens to you. Just
[38:45] something that would take us all there
[38:47] with me, my friend, and us together. Go
[38:50] out there. Go out of here under the
[38:53] influence of the Holy Spirit and win
[38:55] souls
[38:57] for Christ."
[38:59] Amen. Listen. Listen, my friend. By the
[39:02] grace of God, with all I can do, I
[39:05] promise God I will pull every soul if I
[39:09] have to make it and compel it and
[39:12] everything else to come to Jesus Christ.
[39:15] God help me forever
[39:19] to win souls to Christ
[39:22] is my prayer.
[39:25] Wow. Acts 4,
[39:28] Lord. Acts 4 and 8 to 12. And Peter
[39:31] being filled with the Holy Ghost said
[39:33] unto them, "Ye rulers and people and
[39:34] elders of Israel, if ye this day have
[39:38] examined the good deeds done to this
[39:41] impruded man, by what?" This was a
[39:44] diseased man. by what means he's been
[39:46] made whole. Be it known unto you,
[39:48] children of Israel, that by the name of
[39:51] Jesus Christ
[39:53] of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, God has
[39:56] raised up from the dead, and by him this
[39:59] man stand here before you whole. And
[40:02] this is the stone which was set
[40:06] at not of ye builders, which has become
[40:10] the head cornerstone, Christ. That's
[40:12] right. There's one way that you're going
[40:14] to get to heaven and it's by Jesus
[40:17] Christ.
[40:19] And neither is there salvation by any
[40:21] other for there is none other under
[40:23] heaven given to given among men whereby
[40:27] you must be saved. That's right.
[40:31] Watch here to quote this exact parallel
[40:33] to verse 12, that last verse we read.
[40:36] And God's provided way. He said, "But
[40:38] there's a place that God has chosen to
[40:40] put his name." And now there's no other
[40:42] place in the Bible given where God will
[40:45] ever put his name, but only in Jesus
[40:48] Christ. For he's the son of God, taking
[40:51] the name of God, God's human name. And
[40:53] there's no other name given under heaven
[40:55] whereby you must be saved. That's right.
[40:58] He said, "I don't care what
[41:01] your doctrine is. Methodist, Baptist,
[41:04] Presbyterian,
[41:05] or whatever you want to do. Only through
[41:09] the name of Jesus. Will every knee bow
[41:12] and every tongue shall confess that he
[41:16] is Lord God." Amen. God help us to
[41:20] recognize the importance our we were
[41:23] blessed here to be Christ in flesh to
[41:26] win souls not necessarily to win them to
[41:29] our church not necessarily to win them
[41:31] to our doctrine because there's
[41:34] different levels of revelation there no
[41:36] new soul is ever going to come in to
[41:40] your revelation when you've been in the
[41:41] the word for years never going to happen
[41:46] if you give a baby steak it'll kill
[41:48] Yeah.
[41:52] There's nothing wrong with milk.
[41:57] That's right.
[41:59] Bless the Lord. You know, I eat steak
[42:01] often. Bless the Lord. But I eat it with
[42:04] milk.
[42:06] It helps it slide down the ticker.
[42:10] That's right.
[42:12] Amen. Some of the greatest revelations
[42:15] that God give us, our prophet gave us
[42:18] will slide down better
[42:21] with milk.
[42:24] That's right. In Acts 20
[42:28] and 28, the end of it, it says, "Which
[42:31] he has purchased by his own blood."
[42:34] Says, "Feed the flock of God which he's
[42:36] purchased by his own blood.
[42:43] unconditional covenant God made with his
[42:46] people. I want to just read another
[42:47] quote here
[42:49] from our prophet. He said, "Now, you
[42:52] never Jesus never said, "No man come to
[42:54] me except the father draws him." That's
[42:56] what Jesus taught us. That's what the
[42:58] Bible says. You see, you don't seek God.
[43:03] God seeks you.
[43:06] I I just want to stop there for a
[43:07] minute. That's grace. Yeah, that's
[43:11] crazy. I want I want to throw something
[43:13] else in here. You know, God wants to
[43:14] show you something. If there's ever a
[43:16] Gentile in the world
[43:20] that feels a tug of God on your heart,
[43:23] just one in the whole world of nine nine
[43:26] billion or whatever it is, but billion,
[43:28] not trillion, billion. If there's one
[43:31] gentile person that feels the tug of God
[43:34] in their heart, one grace ain't over,
[43:37] Sister Patty. Yeah. Just one. If there's
[43:41] one person that's a Gentile that
[43:44] supernaturally feels a tug on their
[43:47] heart, grace ain't over. Because it's
[43:50] not until God leaves the Gentile people
[43:53] and looks at the Jewish nation that
[43:56] grace is over for the Gentiles. But I
[43:58] tell you this morning, that ain't
[44:00] happened yet. Cuz brother Dale's still
[44:02] here and I still feel the tug on my
[44:05] heart. Amen.
[44:08] And it offends me
[44:11] for anybody that would insinuate or say
[44:13] that grace is over. That is the most
[44:15] disgusting thing
[44:17] that could ever happen or come out of
[44:20] anybody's mouth. Yeah. Praise God. It's
[44:23] a self-righteous spirit that I'm in and
[44:27] you're out. Oh, help him, Jesus. Watch
[44:30] that.
[44:33] It's me and you. It's Oh, it's me.
[44:37] It's us three. But you can't come.
[44:43] No. No.
[44:46] No. No. It's for whosoever. God is not
[44:49] slack
[44:51] concerning his promises like some
[44:54] messagemen
[44:57] concern slackness.
[45:02] But he would that none would perish.
[45:05] It it I want to show you something in
[45:08] that that none would perish. That does
[45:10] not mean that all are going to come to
[45:12] the statue of the perfect man in
[45:15] fullness,
[45:17] but they still be saved. You know, I
[45:20] want to go back to Revelations chapter 7
[45:22] and and that verse there, I forget. I
[45:24] think it was 14. You know, when it said
[45:27] about the multitude that no man could
[45:29] number,
[45:30] I want that. I'm I'm driving this home.
[45:34] Is that Bible?
[45:36] Okay, that's Bible. We're okay with
[45:38] that. And they had white robes.
[45:41] That means they were saved. Brother Bam
[45:44] said, "You're saved when you get the
[45:45] Holy Ghost."
[45:48] Okay, that means they had the Holy
[45:50] Ghost. And yet our prophet said that the
[45:53] rapture, the bride would be very tiny.
[45:56] Just a few. All the examples in the
[45:58] Bible was in Noah's day there was only
[46:00] eight went into the ark.
[46:03] You know, uh in in Israel's day, there's
[46:06] only two that went into the promised
[46:07] land of the original 2 million. The
[46:10] bride was always small. But you see, but
[46:13] this is bride also
[46:18] in a different spot.
[46:22] Amen. My God.
[46:26] Back to our quote here
[46:28] said, "God is he said,
[46:32] I'm just reading down a couple lines.
[46:34] God is seeking the lost, not the lost is
[46:36] seeking God. And you can't do nothing
[46:38] with it. You're not saved tonight by
[46:41] your own merits of your own or anything.
[46:44] You're saved because of God's sovereign
[46:48] grace
[46:49] called you to Jesus." And that's the
[46:52] only way. It ain't whether you keep the
[46:55] Sabbath
[46:56] or you keep a new moon or whether you
[46:59] eat meat or whether you eat this or that
[47:03] or whether you go to a message church or
[47:05] not.
[47:08] You're saved by grace
[47:10] and grace alone.
[47:12] Amen. Now, a message church is the the
[47:16] complete statue of the perfect man in
[47:18] Revelation. But not all will come to
[47:20] that.
[47:24] Amen.
[47:27] Don't Don't run away yet. I'm got I got
[47:29] some really Watch this. Brother Bam
[47:31] said,
[47:33] "Now before the creation, there was a
[47:35] creator
[47:37] that created the creation." And what do
[47:39] you I mean he said as long as you're
[47:41] wanting and hungering I just said this
[47:44] as long as you're wanting and hungering
[47:46] to get more of God.
[47:49] There's more of God somewhere calling
[47:51] you to him. You see or you wouldn't be
[47:55] hungering for something that ain't
[47:57] there.
[48:00] There's the creator.
[48:02] And now there's a place that you can
[48:04] cross to get back. I just want to jump.
[48:07] I I want He's talking about if you
[48:09] backslide there's but when you're down
[48:12] when you backslide
[48:14] you're not lost.
[48:16] That's right. That's right. He said
[48:18] backsliding is not lost. I want someone
[48:20] to tell me where backsliding is lost and
[48:23] prove it in the Bible. Backsliders were
[48:26] never lost. They were only out of
[48:29] fellowship. Yes. Yeah.
[48:32] That means there's a lot of backsliders
[48:34] today. Cuz there's a lot of people don't
[48:37] attend church. So, they're out of
[48:39] fellowship. But it don't mean they're
[48:41] lost. They're out of fellowship. Watch
[48:44] what he says here. Israel backslide, but
[48:47] they never lost their covenant. Their
[48:50] their their covenant. They lost their
[48:52] praise and joy, but they never lost
[48:54] their covenant. David lost the joy of
[48:57] his salvation when he took Basheba
[49:01] uh uh Uriah's wife, but he never lost
[49:04] his salvation. He never said, "God, save
[49:07] me." He said, "God, give me my joy
[49:09] back." But he was a sinner. But he
[49:12] wasn't lost.
[49:16] So you got to be careful how you judge
[49:17] sinners.
[49:20] If there was a man took another man's
[49:21] wife and murdered the man, we would
[49:24] judge him. No, it every honest person
[49:28] put their hand up.
[49:32] If there was a man sitting in this
[49:33] church and he killed another man's wife
[49:36] and killed the man, you would mark that
[49:39] man. Is that not the truth?
[49:42] But your prophet said he wasn't lost. He
[49:46] never asked for forgiven. He said, "Give
[49:47] me the joy.
[49:49] back. Not my salvation.
[49:53] We don't believe that.
[49:56] We don't believe that. Because if you
[49:58] believe that, you want to judge the
[49:59] other person today.
[50:07] God forbid I ever did that. But if I did
[50:10] that, you'd write me right off.
[50:12] And the very prophet you would come and
[50:14] hear somebody else preach said I wasn't
[50:16] lost.
[50:26] See, God can give more grace than the
[50:28] children can.
[50:32] He said, "Oh, watch this. This is still
[50:34] the prophet." Paragraph 0107. Vicki, I'd
[50:37] like to see that one.
[50:40] Oh, there's so much legalism today.
[50:46] Guess who he was preaching to?
[50:49] Us.
[50:51] There's so much legalism today.
[50:55] Touch not, taste not.
[50:58] You don't do these things legally.
[51:07] Wow.
[51:09] Amazing grace. Now, I'm not promoting
[51:11] sin, but I'm promoting grace.
[51:15] Back off and give people mercy and
[51:18] grace.
[51:20] People, Christians, Holy Ghostfilled
[51:23] Christian, fall down.
[51:29] [Music]
[51:31] Your prophet said that the natural types
[51:33] of spiritual. That's right. Is that
[51:34] right? Old people fall down more than
[51:37] young people all the time.
[51:45] Bless God. I've been in the message
[51:46] church for 40 years. You're about to
[51:48] fall down.
[51:52] You know, in the old age home, they give
[51:53] people walkers, wheelchairs.
[51:56] They give people nurses for escorts cuz
[51:58] they go to the bathroom, they fall flat
[52:00] in their face right before they're ready
[52:02] to sit on the commode.
[52:07] Wait a minute now.
[52:10] Your prophet said that's a perfect type.
[52:14] You thought that you got stronger when
[52:15] you get old. No, your spiritual.
[52:22] See, Paul got Christ left Paul's
[52:26] infirmity in the flesh because he had so
[52:29] much revelation.
[52:32] He wouldn't fix his
[52:35] problem. And he said, "My grace is
[52:37] sufficient for you." Because he would
[52:39] get high and lifted up and his head
[52:42] would get woohoo.
[52:50] And brother Brown prayed for those
[52:51] people when he was here. They were
[52:53] called waterhead babies.
[52:57] And there's a lot of people sitting in
[53:01] message churches
[53:04] with waterheads.
[53:08] Water head babies.
[53:12] Amen.
[53:14] Watch what the This is This is Watch
[53:18] what our prophet said.
[53:24] her next quilt. Vicki,
[53:30] no, you're a different place than me.
[53:33] There you go.
[53:35] I'm going to take my time on this one
[53:37] cuz this is my whole message right here.
[53:40] This a 61 quote.
[53:43] Brother Bram said, he said, "What's the
[53:45] matter with you Christians today?
[53:49] Why you won't accept that? break down
[53:51] these walls where these poor humans are.
[53:57] The people that believe in oneness, they
[53:59] want to go and fellowship with the
[54:00] assemblies of God.
[54:03] And the Assembly of God congregation,
[54:05] they want to worship with the oneness.
[54:08] And the brethren desire to do that.
[54:12] And they are that way. But as long as
[54:15] the devil can make them
[54:18] fight
[54:20] fight. As long as you're judging. Now if
[54:23] you weren't here last Sunday, you go
[54:24] back and listen to the video. But the
[54:26] Bible says the Bible says judge not
[54:31] and by what me if you were to judge by
[54:34] what measure you judge will it also be
[54:37] measured unto you.
[54:41] Now, that's just pretty simple.
[54:44] So, if you see somebody and it's obvious
[54:48] that they don't have the revelation or
[54:50] understanding of God's word,
[54:55] whose fault's that?
[54:58] It's not your fault.
[55:01] And it ain't God's fault cuz God has
[55:03] children of different ages.
[55:06] Yeah, just leave it alone. You know, if
[55:09] you were a parent and you know, in my
[55:11] family there was eight kids. So when my
[55:13] sister got married, I was seven. That
[55:16] means my when my oldest brother got
[55:18] married, I was eight. He could have beat
[55:20] the living stat out of me.
[55:26] But if he would have, my mom and dad
[55:28] would have stepped in and protected me,
[55:30] but not us spiritually.
[55:32] See, if old Christian, if the if the
[55:35] 20year-old brother was going to beat up
[55:37] on the sevenyear-old son, we'd just say,
[55:40] "Ah,
[55:44] he shouldn't be that young anyway."
[55:50] What's the sevenyear-old got to choose
[55:52] on his age?
[55:54] See that sevenyear-old is seven years
[55:57] old because that's exactly the will of
[55:59] God when the father drew him
[56:04] cuz no man come to that to Jesus unless
[56:06] the father draw him. So God drew people
[56:09] at different ages. So some are 20, some
[56:12] are 30, some are 40, but some are five.
[56:17] So we're just going to kill all the
[56:18] 5-year-olds.
[56:21] Jesus.
[56:24] You see what I mean? But a 5-year-old
[56:26] don't have the understanding as a 20
[56:28] year old or a 30year-old or a 40y old.
[56:32] But he's a 5year-old. Just let him serve
[56:35] God in his understanding as a
[56:37] 5-year-old.
[56:41] Just let him be five. If he stays in
[56:44] that family, he'll grow.
[56:49] That's right.
[56:51] That's right. That's what the prophet's
[56:52] saying here in this quote.
[56:54] That's right. Amen. Next paragraph.
[57:05] I'm on 242.
[57:08] Now you see here what I mean, brethren,
[57:10] is I'm driving towards one thing. This
[57:14] is our prophet
[57:16] Jesus Christ and the unity of the church
[57:20] by the body of Jesus Christ. It's about
[57:23] unity.
[57:25] That's my whole purpose is unity. That
[57:29] was your prophet that said his whole
[57:31] purpose was saving souls and unity.
[57:34] Unity. That's right.
[57:37] Watch this next paragraph. Now, I don't
[57:40] say nothing about
[57:42] the baptism.
[57:46] Hey, if you aren't baptized in Jesus
[57:48] name, you aren't going to hell. Now,
[57:51] that's nonsense.
[57:59] Wow.
[58:01] You know, we mentioned last Sunday like,
[58:03] you know, there was actually people that
[58:04] received the Holy Ghost. They hadn't
[58:06] been baptized. All the new people that
[58:08] Peter preached to, they they added 3,000
[58:11] to the church. They never had time to
[58:12] baptize 3,000 people. The thief on the
[58:15] cross was saved, but he never was
[58:18] baptized. He got to heaven, but he broke
[58:21] the rule.
[58:24] Prophet said that's nonsense.
[58:29] And yet he preached it. We know that the
[58:31] name of Jesus Christ is the right proper
[58:33] water baptism. I'm not preaching against
[58:36] that.
[58:37] But the emphasis.
[58:40] So when what the prophet's saying here,
[58:42] now I'm not putting words in his mouth.
[58:44] If you go out to witness to somebody on
[58:46] the street at the grocery store today,
[58:48] don't ask him what their baptism is.
[58:52] Ask them if they know Jesus Christ.
[58:56] And Jesus Christ will bring them to the
[58:58] proper fulfillment of the word.
[59:00] Maybe they're just five spiritually.
[59:04] Amen. Watch this. 44. And I tell you
[59:07] what happened the other day. Now he's
[59:08] going to tell you an experience in this
[59:10] quote what happened. He said he was in
[59:13] Texas and the oneness church 72 of them
[59:17] had sponsored his meetings.
[59:21] 72 of the oneness church had sponsored
[59:23] his meetings. No. The brother didn't
[59:25] believe in oneness. Not like your
[59:28] finger.
[59:30] And he had Assemblies of God preacher on
[59:33] the platform.
[59:37] And he said at the end of that
[59:39] paragraph, he said he was the finest man
[59:40] I've ever met. His wife was converted
[59:43] from Catholic and he was a she was a
[59:46] real saint and he was a real man of God.
[59:50] I'm going to jump a paragraph there,
[59:52] Vicki.
[59:54] I'm going to jump to 46. I'm going to
[59:56] jump that paragraph. See my paragraphs
[59:59] and here in verse chapter uh 246. And he
[1:00:03] said, but they were he he before that he
[1:00:05] was talking he listed a bunch of
[1:00:07] ministers and assembly of God church and
[1:00:10] he said those are Christians or real men
[1:00:13] of God. This is almost a 62 quote by the
[1:00:16] way.
[1:00:20] But they were all men of God and God had
[1:00:22] given them the Holy Ghost. How's that
[1:00:24] happen?
[1:00:28] If it wasn't grace of God, we'd all be
[1:00:31] gone with our fussing and things. That's
[1:00:35] exactly right. But it was grace that
[1:00:38] binded us together. No wonder we can
[1:00:40] sing, "Blessed be the ties that bind our
[1:00:43] hearts in Christian love." What what the
[1:00:47] prophet is telling you here is you got
[1:00:49] your emphasis on doctrine.
[1:00:53] And your prophet had his emphasis on
[1:00:57] salvation, grace, and unity.
[1:01:02] He did. I'm going to show you right
[1:01:03] here. We're not done yet.
[1:01:06] And so, you know what?
[1:01:11] 47. So, you know what? You can follow me
[1:01:13] right there. I'm not making this up. You
[1:01:15] know what? The general superintendent,
[1:01:18] the big most popular preacher
[1:01:21] of the witness church called me up and
[1:01:24] said, "Do you know what you did last
[1:01:26] night, Brother Brandham?"
[1:01:29] He said, "It was my second night there."
[1:01:32] He said, "What what did I do? We had a
[1:01:34] wonderful meeting."
[1:01:37] He said, the minister said to brother
[1:01:39] Brandham, he said, "You had a sinner.
[1:01:42] You had a man on your platform that was
[1:01:45] a sinner. Uhoh.
[1:01:48] Uhoh.
[1:01:51] He was judging.
[1:01:53] Yeah. Uhoh.
[1:01:56] Anybody else here but ever judged
[1:01:58] before?
[1:02:04] The Bible says, "Don't judge
[1:02:08] unless you get judged the same
[1:02:09] strictness.
[1:02:13] Brother Bram said,
[1:02:16] "I don't know it. Where was he?" And he
[1:02:19] names
[1:02:21] the assembly of God. Mr. Pertie names
[1:02:24] the preacher. And brother Brown said, "A
[1:02:27] sinner."
[1:02:29] What?
[1:02:32] He's Assembly of God preacher, brother.
[1:02:37] He said, "Yes."
[1:02:40] Now, this is a oneness. I I'm I'm going
[1:02:42] to take my I'm just slowing right down.
[1:02:44] Now, this is a oneness minister that's
[1:02:46] judging. He said, "Yes, but he's still a
[1:02:50] sinner because he hasn't been baptized,
[1:02:56] right?"
[1:02:58] Uh-oh. That's how you rate them. If you
[1:03:02] got baptized in the titles, you're a
[1:03:04] sinner. But if you're baptized in the
[1:03:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you got
[1:03:08] the Holy Ghost, right?
[1:03:12] Wrong.
[1:03:15] Now, we know the right way. The Bible's
[1:03:17] very clear.
[1:03:18] Be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:03:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:03:24] But watch what the prophet said.
[1:03:27] And brother Bram said, "Pray, tell me
[1:03:30] why."
[1:03:31] Brother Brenham said he's got the Holy
[1:03:34] Ghost.
[1:03:37] Now, I'm just going to give you a sneak
[1:03:39] preview, but Brother Brennham, by the
[1:03:42] anointing of God, could look into
[1:03:44] people's lives.
[1:03:46] Cuz he's seen visions.
[1:03:49] So, here's a religious person that
[1:03:51] Brother Bram just preached for saying,
[1:03:53] "You got a sinner on the platform." And
[1:03:56] Brother Bram said, "But I can see that
[1:03:58] he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[1:03:59] Yeah. Do you know that still happens
[1:04:01] today?
[1:04:06] Sure does.
[1:04:10] 51. 251
[1:04:13] about the middle there. And he said to
[1:04:16] brother Brandham, he said, "What did
[1:04:18] Peter say?" Now he's preaching to
[1:04:21] brother Brandham. He thinks he's got the
[1:04:24] correct revelation of the word of God.
[1:04:27] Oh, that sounds like believers.
[1:04:30] I've had some of them come up to me
[1:04:32] after I preach. Yeah.
[1:04:35] And Peter said in the Bible, repent and
[1:04:38] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:40] for the remission of sins, and therefore
[1:04:42] your sins cannot be remitted until
[1:04:45] you're baptized in Jesus' name. And
[1:04:49] brother Brandham asked this minister
[1:04:51] that was legalistic and judging. He
[1:04:55] said, "Is that the Bible formula,
[1:04:58] brother?"
[1:04:59] You got that up there? Yeah. Right at
[1:05:01] the bottom. Is that the formula, my
[1:05:04] brother? That if you ain't, you know,
[1:05:08] repent and remission of sins and be
[1:05:10] baptized and that's beautiful and I love
[1:05:12] it. I agree with it and it's Bible.
[1:05:19] But you got to make the Bible all
[1:05:21] doveetail.
[1:05:23] You can't just take this scripture and
[1:05:25] it out and it out.
[1:05:29] So, brother B asked the brother, he
[1:05:30] said, "Is that the formula, brother?" He
[1:05:33] said, "Yes, sir. That's the formula."
[1:05:35] And so, that minister that you had on
[1:05:38] the platform is still a sinner cuz he
[1:05:41] ain't been baptized correctly.
[1:05:48] Oh,
[1:05:50] 252.
[1:05:52] And brother Bram said, "Well, God upset
[1:05:56] his own apple cart then in Acts 10:49.
[1:06:01] For while Peter yet spake these words,
[1:06:04] the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard
[1:06:06] the word preached,
[1:06:08] and they were not baptized at all."
[1:06:12] Then God give the Holy Ghost to people
[1:06:16] that wasn't even converted.
[1:06:21] Where in the world are you standing?
[1:06:29] Wait a minute now. Don't judge me. Don't
[1:06:31] throw no eggs at me.
[1:06:37] That's Bible.
[1:06:39] That's what brother Brown said, but
[1:06:41] that's also Bible.
[1:06:43] See, God is omnipotent
[1:06:46] and he might work in a different way
[1:06:48] than what you think he must.
[1:06:51] You know, when Jesus came to the earth,
[1:06:53] they thought he would come to the
[1:06:54] church. The Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:06:56] thought that he for sure would come to
[1:06:58] the temple, but he came to a barn.
[1:07:02] And so they rejected him because he
[1:07:04] never came to their assembly. Yeah.
[1:07:07] Yeah. Your prophet says, "Now, where in
[1:07:11] the world are you standing now?"
[1:07:15] See, one man was willing to place a
[1:07:18] minister in hell
[1:07:20] over baptism.
[1:07:23] And I'll guarantee you that's still
[1:07:25] happening because spirits don't die.
[1:07:32] You can just do a little shout for me.
[1:07:35] Amen.
[1:07:37] Spirits don't die.
[1:07:41] And here this minister came back to
[1:07:43] brother Brandham. He said, "Well,
[1:07:46] that this spirit don't die either." He
[1:07:48] said, "You know what we're going to do?"
[1:07:51] He said, "We're going to draw a little
[1:07:53] ring and we're drawing you out of our
[1:07:56] circle and we're not going to talk to
[1:07:58] you no more
[1:08:00] because we don't like how you read the
[1:08:02] Bible." Half the word.
[1:08:05] cuz the prophet was off the word, a
[1:08:07] minister of the word. You know what is
[1:08:09] it? Amos 3:8 says the God will do
[1:08:11] nothing except he reveals his secrets of
[1:08:14] the word to the prophets.
[1:08:17] And here the prophet is correcting
[1:08:20] another brother and he says, "That's it.
[1:08:24] I'm not going to talk to you no more
[1:08:26] because I don't like how you preach."
[1:08:29] Yeah.
[1:08:31] And brother Brown said, "Well, then I'm
[1:08:34] going to draw another circle and I'm
[1:08:37] going to draw you right back inside it
[1:08:39] again." He said, "Cuz you can't put me
[1:08:42] out cuz I love you. You see, you just
[1:08:46] can't do that." Said, "There's too many
[1:08:49] brethren out there that love me and
[1:08:52] believe in me." Said, "And they'll come
[1:08:54] anyhow." And I said, "They're they'll
[1:08:57] come and you can't draw me out. And if
[1:09:00] you draw me out, I'll draw you back in
[1:09:03] and make the circle. Make one circle."
[1:09:06] And then watch what he puts there right
[1:09:08] at the bottom.
[1:09:12] Cuz God by his grace, let me draw
[1:09:16] another one and pull you right back in.
[1:09:21] Now, here's somebody that's judging
[1:09:24] somebody in church, a minister. He's
[1:09:26] actually judging the prophet.
[1:09:30] And watch how not only did Brother Brown
[1:09:33] not judge him, but he said, "I'm going
[1:09:34] to pull you right back in to my circle."
[1:09:38] Because I love you.
[1:09:41] Romans 8:31. We're We go fast. We're
[1:09:44] We're almost done here. Amen. God,
[1:09:47] you're pulling wonderfully.
[1:09:51] You know, we I I I just want to I don't
[1:09:53] want to leave anybody misled this
[1:09:56] morning. The message is the truth, and
[1:09:59] we have the revealed word for the day,
[1:10:01] but that gives you no right to judge
[1:10:04] somebody that ain't where you are.
[1:10:11] No right at all.
[1:10:13] Matter of fact, the very word of God
[1:10:15] will judge you back
[1:10:18] because it was amazing grace. Amen.
[1:10:22] Romans 8:31. And what shall we say then
[1:10:25] to these things? If God be for us, then
[1:10:27] who can be against us? He that spare not
[1:10:30] his own son, but delivered him up for
[1:10:33] us.
[1:10:36] All
[1:10:39] how shall we not with him so freely give
[1:10:43] us all things
[1:10:45] see God give you freely your amazing
[1:10:49] grace and your amazing revelation and
[1:10:52] your amazing Holy Ghost but that spirit
[1:10:55] of legalism would like to keep it from
[1:10:57] somebody else
[1:11:02] I'm going to be there but he won't
[1:11:08] We don't talk.
[1:11:12] Uh,
[1:11:14] we also freely give us all things. Who
[1:11:16] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:11:19] God's elect?
[1:11:21] You see what I'm saying? God's saying
[1:11:24] you don't have We We read last Sunday,
[1:11:27] who was it that condemns? It was Christ
[1:11:30] that died.
[1:11:32] If you died to re to save my sins, then
[1:11:36] you can judge me. But God died to save
[1:11:40] my sins. And so there's only one person
[1:11:43] that can judge me, and that's Christ.
[1:11:46] And he ain't judging me.
[1:11:53] Who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:11:56] God's elect? Who? Us message believers
[1:11:59] can. We have the revealed word.
[1:12:03] We have a prophet that came and showed
[1:12:05] us the truth.
[1:12:09] Really?
[1:12:10] That's not what the Bible says.
[1:12:13] It says that was grace.
[1:12:17] Blessed art thou,
[1:12:19] Simon Barjonah.
[1:12:22] Because the ministers uptown never
[1:12:24] revealed this unto you. Blessed art
[1:12:26] thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood
[1:12:29] never revealed this unto you, but my
[1:12:31] father which is in heaven came down and
[1:12:35] showed you his whole plan.
[1:12:38] And because God did that, you're going
[1:12:40] to high and lifted up
[1:12:42] and get arrogant.
[1:12:45] That should make you meek and humble and
[1:12:47] say, "I can't believe you saved me,
[1:12:50] Jesus." When you knew the pit of sin I
[1:12:53] was in, I was way down in the mud.
[1:12:59] When you pulled me out,
[1:13:04] amen,
[1:13:07] it is God that justified.
[1:13:11] It's God.
[1:13:13] It's not the message believers. No, it's
[1:13:16] not the ones that have been in 30 years,
[1:13:18] 40 years, or 70 years.
[1:13:22] It's God.
[1:13:27] That's right.
[1:13:30] Who is he that condemnth? Is it not
[1:13:33] Christ that died? Yay. Rather, I read
[1:13:35] this last week. And is raised again, and
[1:13:37] even at the right hand of God, make an
[1:13:39] intercession for me. Do you know God
[1:13:42] himself is praying for the little child
[1:13:45] that's just getting saved?
[1:13:48] And he's praying that God will give him,
[1:13:50] nurture him, and give him the right kind
[1:13:52] of milk and just the right amount of
[1:13:55] times and do his feeding on demand. God
[1:13:58] don't believe in hourly feeding.
[1:14:03] You know, some mothers, they feed their
[1:14:04] baby like at 8:00, 4:00, you know,
[1:14:08] whatever, every 8 hours. But God plans
[1:14:11] on feeding on demand. When the baby
[1:14:13] cries, "Give me more of God." He just
[1:14:16] whoop pops it in there. I'll take more
[1:14:19] of Jesus.
[1:14:22] The bottle's already warm. Heaven's like
[1:14:25] a great big microwave.
[1:14:27] Boy, how do you think he made all the
[1:14:29] bread to feed the children of Israel in
[1:14:31] the desert?
[1:14:33] Yeah. I mean, God just
[1:14:39] Amen.
[1:14:41] Imagine that Christ Jesus loved the
[1:14:43] sinner so much that he was making
[1:14:47] intercessor intercession for him.
[1:14:52] Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:14:54] Christ? So tribulation or distress or
[1:14:56] persecution or famine or nakedness
[1:15:00] or peril or sword as it is written for
[1:15:04] thy sake shall we be killed all the day
[1:15:06] long. We are counted as sheep to the
[1:15:08] slaughter day. In all these things we
[1:15:11] are more than conquerors through Christ
[1:15:15] that loved us. And I am persuaded that
[1:15:18] neither death nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:15:23] principalities, nor powers,
[1:15:28] nor things present,
[1:15:30] nor things even to come,
[1:15:33] nor heights, nor depths, nor any other
[1:15:36] creature,
[1:15:40] even if it's a makeeliever,
[1:15:43] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:15:46] love of God
[1:15:50] which is in Christ Jesus.
[1:15:55] Wow.
[1:16:01] Amazing.
[1:16:04] There was just one place that God chose
[1:16:07] to place his name.
[1:16:09] The chosen place of worship the prophet
[1:16:11] preached. It was in Jesus Christ.
[1:16:16] the chosen place of worship.
[1:16:19] Amen.
[1:16:22] Wow.
[1:16:24] We're looking for a quote here.
[1:16:29] Amen. God help us.
[1:16:37] One second. Sorry.
[1:16:44] Amen. And I want to close on this quote.
[1:16:47] I read this quote last week
[1:16:52] and I God's just laying it on my heart
[1:16:54] to share it again. And we're going to
[1:16:55] close this one quote, honey. Uh Vicki,
[1:16:57] it's the last one we read last week,
[1:16:59] right at the beginning, right above part
[1:17:02] two.
[1:17:05] For you that weren't here and maybe
[1:17:06] didn't see the video,
[1:17:09] this is a 64 quote. This is after the
[1:17:12] seals.
[1:17:16] seals were wrote in ' 63
[1:17:19] about the third month.
[1:17:23] I'm waiting for Vicki to pull it up
[1:17:24] right before part two.
[1:17:29] God's word calls a total separation
[1:17:33] from unbelief.
[1:17:36] But unbelief ain't what you think it is.
[1:17:39] It's not a lesser revelation.
[1:17:47] Just give me the next paragraph.
[1:17:49] 75.
[1:17:56] I closed on this one last and I won't
[1:17:58] take as long. Paragraph 75. Just the
[1:18:00] next one up.
[1:18:02] To all those believers,
[1:18:06] you're a bunch of change
[1:18:08] in God's pocket.
[1:18:13] You need to see this.
[1:18:16] If you're legalistic this morning, you
[1:18:17] need to see this quote. I'm going to
[1:18:20] make this really nice and put it on the
[1:18:22] chalkboard out there.
[1:18:24] To all you message believers, you're a
[1:18:27] bunch of change in the pocket of God's
[1:18:30] hand.
[1:18:33] And God
[1:18:37] pulls this change out and there's
[1:18:39] pennies, there's nickels, dimes,
[1:18:42] quarters, half dollars, and dollars, but
[1:18:46] they're all coins.
[1:18:49] And now that is the world
[1:18:52] that's in God's hands.
[1:18:54] And there's some people that are just a
[1:18:58] one penny Christian.
[1:19:01] I don't want to be a one penny
[1:19:03] Christian, but I'll be happy to be a one
[1:19:05] penny Christian rather than beyond
[1:19:06] saved.
[1:19:09] But there's some Christians that are
[1:19:10] just a one penny Christian. That just
[1:19:13] means they don't haven't got the
[1:19:16] revelation of they don't understand
[1:19:17] God's word. They haven't came to it.
[1:19:20] Amen. And God can only use them for a
[1:19:23] penny.
[1:19:26] That's all they can buy. But don't you
[1:19:28] reject them.
[1:19:31] If they can't believe the real truth,
[1:19:35] don't turn them down
[1:19:38] and don't say they're not saved.
[1:19:41] Don't kick them out and say they're not
[1:19:44] in the kingdom of God
[1:19:49] because God
[1:19:52] uses pennies.
[1:19:58] Amen.
[1:19:59] The church,
[1:20:01] every church,
[1:20:04] every church and especially message
[1:20:08] churches.
[1:20:09] You might hate me for this. That's
[1:20:12] between you and God.
[1:20:15] They don't like that quote.
[1:20:19] And all the churches and message
[1:20:22] believers have judged people because
[1:20:24] they never measured up to their own
[1:20:27] personal revelation.
[1:20:31] And the prophet said, "Leave it alone."
[1:20:36] Don't disown them. Don't kick them out.
[1:20:41] You know, God probably wouldn't call a
[1:20:42] penny to minister. He might not call a
[1:20:45] nickel to minister.
[1:20:48] He might have a dime just minister once
[1:20:50] in their life. Do you know God raised up
[1:20:53] Esther for one message?
[1:20:57] One message. She never had to preach
[1:20:59] again. She went to the king, her
[1:21:01] husband. Wives can preach to their
[1:21:04] husbands. Oh yeah. No other men, just
[1:21:06] her husband. Oh yes.
[1:21:12] Esther was raised up for one message.
[1:21:14] Maybe she was a quarter.
[1:21:18] Maybe the regular people are 50 cents or
[1:21:22] or whatever. Maybe I'm I'm I'm probably
[1:21:25] a a quarter preacher and all maybe all
[1:21:29] the rest are silver dollars,
[1:21:32] but I'm still worth a quarter.
[1:21:35] And it takes four quarters to make a
[1:21:38] dollar. And you can't make that dollar
[1:21:41] without a quarter of me in there. That's
[1:21:44] right. Never. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you get
[1:21:48] rid of this quarter, you're only worth
[1:21:50] 75 cents.
[1:21:53] So, watch this. I'm closing on this.
[1:21:56] This is I mean, this is as fresh as it
[1:21:58] gets. But in the natural, if you're in
[1:22:02] the workforce, you put other people down
[1:22:05] so you get promoted.
[1:22:08] You step on other people's heads
[1:22:11] so you can get the promotion in the
[1:22:13] race.
[1:22:15] That's not how it works in the family of
[1:22:17] God. No, you don't come and step on
[1:22:20] other Christians and say, "Well, I pray
[1:22:22] more than them or I even go to prayer
[1:22:25] meeting."
[1:22:27] Like, that would really cut out a lot of
[1:22:29] people.
[1:22:31] But that ain't nothing to step on them
[1:22:33] and say, "Well, I'm better because I
[1:22:35] come every Wednesday night." Don't make
[1:22:38] me one speck better to step on somebody
[1:22:41] that can't never come
[1:22:43] because I don't have that watch this
[1:22:46] authority.
[1:22:49] God never gave me that authority because
[1:22:53] the price never came from my pocket. You
[1:22:58] see, it's like this in a family when
[1:23:00] your kids are small and they're asking
[1:23:02] me for my money.
[1:23:05] I have the authority
[1:23:07] to say you'll either do this
[1:23:11] or there won't be no money.
[1:23:13] But when your kids grow up and they have
[1:23:17] their own money and they come and ask
[1:23:18] the same parents for advice, you do not
[1:23:21] have the same authority
[1:23:25] because it ain't your money.
[1:23:28] You can say, "Little child, I think
[1:23:30] you're making a huge mistake. I wouldn't
[1:23:33] go down that road. I think you're going
[1:23:35] to have a train wreck. I done got that
[1:23:38] t-shirt and all that. But if it's his
[1:23:40] money,
[1:23:42] watch this. If it was his blood
[1:23:45] and his sweat to put the money in here,
[1:23:50] then he has the authority.
[1:23:53] And God gave that authority to one
[1:23:55] person,
[1:23:56] one name under heaven that every knee
[1:24:00] shall bow and every tongue shall confess
[1:24:04] that Christ Jesus is Lord of all.
[1:24:08] And it's only by his blood that he has
[1:24:11] the authority
[1:24:13] to dictate. Leave thy family alone.
[1:24:19] Yes, sir. Don't take none away that when
[1:24:23] I poured my blood and water out
[1:24:27] and was beat beyond recognition.
[1:24:31] You know, I was seeing a quote and if
[1:24:32] you read in Luke, do you know when the
[1:24:34] people seen Christ after he was scared,
[1:24:38] they they they were they they were it
[1:24:40] was the Bible says it was like
[1:24:42] stunnable.
[1:24:45] the human.
[1:24:49] The Bible says that his bones looked out
[1:24:53] through the back of his flesh because
[1:24:55] the Romans had a way of torturing that
[1:24:58] the whip had scourged and they would
[1:25:00] wrap that whip around and then jerk it
[1:25:02] and literally rip the flesh
[1:25:05] off the bone. That's right.
[1:25:11] And then they smacked him up against the
[1:25:13] tree. the cross. And he had to push that
[1:25:17] wounded back up and down on the tree to
[1:25:19] take every breath.
[1:25:22] Every breath. Every breath. Like when he
[1:25:24] say down, he had to slide his wounded
[1:25:26] back up the tree
[1:25:29] and then slide back down. And he was
[1:25:31] sliding his hamburger up the tree
[1:25:37] for that little 2year-old kid
[1:25:40] that you want to judge.
[1:25:44] God's saying, "Bank off.
[1:25:48] I have the authority." Amen. I am the
[1:25:51] only one that has the authority.
[1:25:54] Brother Bible, please preach. I The only
[1:25:57] place that God put his name for worship
[1:26:01] was in Christ Jesus alone.
[1:26:07] Period.
[1:26:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:12] Amen.
[1:26:13] G. When we get that revelation,
[1:26:17] the body of Christ will come in perfect
[1:26:20] unity.
[1:26:22] Perfect unity. Cuz it won't matter to me
[1:26:25] one speck what level
[1:26:29] you're at. Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[1:26:34] That's right. If you got You know, you
[1:26:38] you think I'm not preaching Bible. Your
[1:26:40] Bible says that the first
[1:26:43] shall be last
[1:26:47] and the last shall be first
[1:26:53] and that whom much is given
[1:26:57] much required will be required
[1:27:02] and to whom few is given
[1:27:06] see God don't even judge the pennies and
[1:27:10] the nickels and dimes like he does the
[1:27:12] dollars
[1:27:13] to whom much is given, much will be
[1:27:16] required. And what the Bible's saying
[1:27:18] there is if you're just a nickel, God's
[1:27:21] going to have a lot more
[1:27:23] than the dollar.
[1:27:27] Now, if you're sitting in a message
[1:27:28] church this morning, you're not just a
[1:27:31] dollar,
[1:27:34] you're a silver dollar.
[1:27:37] You're not just a dollar, you're
[1:27:38] actually a silver dollar.
[1:27:41] But you can go in the same pocket
[1:27:44] with a copper penny.
[1:27:46] Let's stand.
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:52] Amen.
[1:28:01] That's Bible.
[1:28:03] Who is it he that condemnth?
[1:28:06] Was it not Christ
[1:28:08] that died? Amen. Amen. God help us.
[1:28:12] Amazing grace. You know, we should
[1:28:14] praise God for the abundant of
[1:28:17] revelation we have. I praise God. It's
[1:28:19] nothing but amazing grace. How sweet the
[1:28:23] sound that say I am not worthy to save
[1:28:27] the wretch like me.
[1:28:31] But that's God. He's omnipotent.
[1:28:33] God chooses,
[1:28:36] you know, God chooses who he'll give the
[1:28:38] bigger talents and the lesser. And that,
[1:28:44] you know, when this master came back and
[1:28:46] he'd give five talents to one man, was
[1:28:49] it five or 10? Three to another and one
[1:28:52] to the one.
[1:28:55] He judged them all except he exactly the
[1:28:58] same except the man that buried his.
[1:29:02] He gave the same reward to the person
[1:29:04] that had two talents as the one that had
[1:29:07] five.
[1:29:09] Uhoh. That don't line up with my
[1:29:12] doctrine.
[1:29:14] You better read your scripture.
[1:29:16] Amen. Same reward. The man that had two
[1:29:20] talents is the one that had five.
[1:29:23] It was only the one that buried it and
[1:29:25] never went out to find lost souls.
[1:29:28] Which watch this? Because the one that
[1:29:31] buried it, he was afraid he would lose
[1:29:32] it.
[1:29:34] The only, the prophet said, the only
[1:29:36] thing that has any value in the world is
[1:29:38] lost souls.
[1:29:42] If we were doing God's will, we take
[1:29:44] that one penny and try to find another
[1:29:46] penny and win souls for him. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:50] God bless you. God bless you. I tell you
[1:29:52] what, next week it'll be maybe Junior
[1:29:54] will be preaching next week. I hope so.
