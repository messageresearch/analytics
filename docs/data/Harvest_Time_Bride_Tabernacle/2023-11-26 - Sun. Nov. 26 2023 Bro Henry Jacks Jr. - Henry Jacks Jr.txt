bit slower this morning and give you a lot of meaning that you can understand where I'm going with it you know some persons may not even understand but you know when the prophet say faith is a revelation we must understand understand that you know when he said that the the we are invisible Army Invincible Army Hallelujah he he break up that can said the word invincible mean unstoppable

is talking about now not in the future but now praise the Lord and you know I just want to get into the word if you can stand just to the reading of the word of God hallelujah in the Book of Matthew we're going to turn back to the Book of Matthew chapter 16 Matthew 16 from verse 13 the word of God said when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asks his disciples you know this city is located in Israel it is located in Israel Hallelujah he ask his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man H and as we say that the son of man is Christ embody in a body that's the meaning for Son of Man Christ embod himself in a body Hallelujah and Christ means the anointed one Christ means the Messiah the sent one can I say this you are Christ you are the son of man amen do you believe that praise the Lord so he asks them right whom do say whom do men say that I the son of man am verse 14 and there s some say that thou art John the Baptist some say Elias and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets now Jesus is going to get personal now verse 15 he said unto them but whom say he that I am this is personal this is not about the public this is about you Hallelujah who do you say that I am praise the Lord verse 16 and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ Thou Art the Messiah thou are the sent one hallelujah praise God the son of the Living God what a answer what a response to the question Jesus asked in so much in verse 17 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou wow you think blessing is about material things but when you get Revelation you are [Laughter] blessed Hallelujah I said when you enjoy peace and Tranquility you're blessed it's not about material things alone blessed are though Hallelujah Simon B Jonah remember Simon means a wonderer and Jesus said I'm going to bless you Hallelujah he said for Flesh and Blood had not reveal it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven praise this is a divine revelation flesh could not reveal this to you you can't be seated Hallelujah glory to God flesh could not reveal this to you brother Dale you could not learn this in the seminars Hallelujah you did not learn this at home Hallelujah it takes a divine revelation for you to understand who I am for you to know who I am glory to God remember the flesh Hallelujah it cannot it cannot see or experience the supernatural because it is the flesh the flesh cannot see it Hallelujah it takes the divine revelation it takes an eye opening it takes an understanding from God for you to see the supernatural before you Hallelujah because the flesh is blind to the things of God hallelujah so it takes Christ Hallelujah glory to God he said and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter not Simon anymore Hallelujah but Thou Art Peter and Peter means Stone the word Peter in the Greek mean pachos which mean Stone oh God hallelujah praise God he said no heart a stone Hallelujah and Upon This Rock I will build my church Hallelujah Hall he never say it's going to build brother Dale Church this is not brother Dale Church Hallelujah this is Christ Church glory to God this is a beautiful building but the building is not

is so rich in Mercy it is rich in Grace the biling man of that Hallelujah can I preach this morning the building may not have peace the building may not have Grace but the body possessed it the Bible say in him was full of grace and truth hallelujah glory to God there was a time when the body of God was walking down the streets of Jerusalem and they began to look at him and said look at the temple oh beautiful is the temple Hallelujah they were more interested in the natural Temple more than the temple of God that was standing before them hallelujah oh Jesus looked at the temple and said not one stone shall be left upon another all this what you're looking at it's going to come to a time where it's going to be destroyed Hallelujah as a matter of fact the glory of God is not in it Hallelujah the glory of God is not that not in the temple you know the glory of God has moved out of the temple out of the natural Temple and now the glory of God is in a body is in a body not made with man's hands Hallelujah there was a time when the glory of God was there but then God shift it you know he said I will restore back the Tabernacle of David Hallelujah and here was the Tabernacle of David walking in the streets of Jerusalem and they could not recognize it they didn't even see it Hallelujah it was hidden from them glory to God their eyes was close to it Hallelujah but here Jesus said I will build my church Hallelujah I will build my church you are God's Church you are God's Building you are God's body Hallelujah he said I will build my church and the gates look at it Gates plural Gates of Hell Hallelujah shall not Prevail against it don't you know Hallelujah that devil recognize who you are the devil knows who you are the devil knows who you are if you should leave tomorrow and go to a different country the devil knows who we are tomorrow brother D and sister Lan will be going to Elsa Vador the same devil that they encounter in Canada is there and let me

devil knows who you are the devil recognizes it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said and the Gates of Hell the gates now let's talk about it the gates would have mean religious religion Hallelujah religion would have means the Scorpions the serpents not a literal Scorpion or a literal serpent but he speaking of the devil and and demons demons are against the Church of God and demons have possessed people hallelujah to go against the Church of God Hallelujah but Jesus said it shall not Prevail against it you know why because in that church in that body there is there Li and authority of godall there lith and authority of God in that body Hallelujah the devil recognize Authority the devil said have you come to torment me before my time look at now the devil knows when his time is short the Bible tell you that the devil know Satan knows when his time is short that's why he's trying to create a v now Hallelujah he knows it that's why the devil he said Jesus do not send me out of this city you know what just send me in the swine just send me in the swine Hallelujah the church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ the son of man the word the son of man is used 81 times in the New Testament you hear that it is used 81 times 32 times in the Book of Matthew 26 times in the book of St Luke 14 times in the book of St Mark and nine times in the other gospels in the other in the other Epistles letters nine times in the other EPS 81 times it is used in the New Testament and the son of man means Christ ody in a body and here in the in the city of Cesar Philippi when Jesus had that conversation the city is located 25 miles Northeast of the Sea of Galilee not for from this city 14 miles away from this city was Mount man you know what m m is Mt IR is a place where Jesus transfigured before his disciples in the Book of Matthew 17 Hallelujah it is said that the trans figuration happened on Mount IR just 14 miles from cisar Philippi Mount irman is Israel highest mountain it Summit 9,232 ft above sea level is actually in Syrian territory mer mountman is 11,000 ft above the level of Jordan Valley so high that it can sometimes be seen from the Dead Sea oh praise God at the other end of Palestine more than 100 miles away now wonder why Jesus choose this particular Mountain M Hallelujah it is the highest mountain in Israel he never choose M carel he never choose Mount olives he never choose Mount Zion oh praise God there are so many mountains in Israel but he chose Mount IR why Hallelujah and cesari Philippi it is St that it is the most Pleasant sites in Israel it is on a Terrace 1,150 ft High overlooking a fertile Valley Hallelujah remember most of Jesus Ministry Jesus have to go through Hallelujah Israel n because he was rejected in Jerusalem the Bible said in St John 1 he came unto his own and his own receed him not that's why Jesus had to go Hallelujah to the Widder spread of Israel all of through all of these places then he chose Mount Hallelujah Mount to transfigure before his disciples in so much that when they saw is SPL when they saw his glory the Peter said let us build three Tabernacles what they saw they saw Moses they saw Elijah and Jesus which which is the glorified word hallelujah and he said let us be Tre Tabernacles but then the voice said no this is my my son here in him Hallelujah so is it today there's not there's no Tabernacle for Moses today no Tabernacles for Elijah but the glorified word of Jesus is present today and that is what we're feasting on today the glorified word that's why brother Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12 Hallelujah verse 12 for by one Spirit one Spirit we are all baptized Jesus said Upon This Rock will I build my church you ready for it Upon This Rock will I build my church for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and the body is the church that Jesus said I will build my church Hallelujah in verse 13 and he said and we all made if Jesus build his church upon the Revelation the church is established upon the Revelation and The Church Must constantly feed of the revelation of Jesus Christ in verse 13 when he said and we all made to drink Hallelujah all made

today Hallelujah and that Revelation that Revelation comes in three steps knowledge understanding and wisdom Hallelujah we said last week that knowledge means information it means the facts Hallelujah God he appear to the Prophet Daniel when Daniel was there in Babylon they were in bondage thank God that we're not in bondage now that's right Hallelujah we are free we are free because the son had

he said I understood by books of the Prophet Jeremiah that after 70 years be accomplished you know what the prophet said about that it was about the 68 years that he had begun to search that he had begun to dig deep hallelujah thank God Hallelujah when the time is coming close God has inspired some group of people to start digging in the word that they understand that their transition is there Hallelujah their transition is near can I say this today our transition is near Hallelujah because we're drinking of the spirit of God and we are constantly getting Revelation so he giv to us that your transition is near hallelujah it's about time we're about to leave this place Hallelujah when we look and see what is happening in the world all of these wars and earthquakes happening in diverse places pestilence disease breaking out what is it events made clear by prophecy Hallelujah Daniel said I begun to pray I began to pray I began to seek the Lord then the God sent his Angel Gabriel and the angel Daniel 9:22 and when the angel came to him he said I come to give you skill you know what is that skill knowledge I come to give you knowledge and understanding and and with that understanding you shall get wisdom Hallelujah he said I come to give you skill and understanding last week I said that the devil does not fear you when you when you learn about the resurrection he doesn't fear you you can learn all you want about Resurrection you can learn all you want about the Rapture that doesn't scare the devil that doesn't scare the devil you can learn all you want about the baptism about marriage about about Hallelujah the glorified word you know what the devil is not scared what scare the devil is understanding when you understand that you are the resurrection Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life the that's what scared the devil the prophet said the devil is afraid of Revelation can I say this the devil is afraid of the true church the devil is afraid of you and I today Hallelujah you know what when we walk on the road and when the devil see us he's getting scared you know why because we come to m his business theia gadara said why have you come to torment me before my time Hallelujah but glory to God when we walk on the road brother tale because there is life in you there is Grace in you there is Mercy in you and when the devil see Mercy coming Life coming truth coming the devil start to get scared I said why have you come to torment me before my time but you know what Hallelujah God has to send us hallelujah to some Mary Magdalene God has to send us to some Med gadara that need Deliverance that was oppressed by the devil Hallelujah so God had to sent his agent down there to deliver them because you know what is in that agent Authority Authority and the devil knows that he recognized it you know what the devil wanted to do was to kill that man you know what the prophet said about this man this man he was a father he had a wife he had a home that's what the prophet said this man was a father and he had a wife and he had his home but the devil the devil took him away from that took him away from his home took him away from his wife but Jesus came to restore him back to deliver him and to restore him back back to his family back to his home back to his wife hallelujah thank God today thank God today that the body is present the body is present today to restore back people back to their home you have the authority to restore back people to their home you have the authority to restore back a man to his wife you have the authority to restore to restore back a wife to her husband you have that Authority you can imagine that man probably these children will say mommy when where is Daddy when will Daddy come home hallelujah oh my I just can imagine oh the wife must have been crying nights Hallelujah having sleepless night Hallelujah looking looking out the doors for the return of her husband you have that Authority you have the power Jesus said in the book of St Luke 10 verse 19 I give unto you power Hallelujah I give unto you power you know what that power means it means Authority because in the very same verse in the same verse of St Luke 10: 19 he said I give you power even power over the enemy Hallelujah I have given it to you Hallelujah Christ didn't went away with the authority last week I said there are three groups of people that has been always been anointed in the Old Testament and I mention that the three groups of people are Prophet Kings and Priests and I said to you that you are the three groups of people did you know Let me refresh back your memory remind you because sometimes God has to refresh back our memory because we keep forgetting what we possess we keep forgetting the power that light in us the prophet said that the church is the younger prophet he said Elijah types Christ Elijah types the church and that elij Elisha is the younger prophet he said the church is the younger Prophet when we hear of prophet brother Dale we think of prophesying prophesying prophesying Hallelujah we think I just prophesying but the Bible said the word of the Lord came unto his servants the prophet Hallelujah that's why they call the prophet a son of man Hallelujah because they recognize the Divine leading of God upon on that vessel that's why they call him a son of man Daniel a son of man what is it the Divine leading upon his life to be obedient to the word to walk according to the word the Bible said Enoch walked with God and he was not found you know what the prophet said that walk represents that's a prophetic walk he live a prophetic life a life a life fully Hallelujah obedient to God a life full of faith can I say this a life full of Revelation Hallelujah he walked in Revelation and he stepped out in Revelation one day I just can imagine when he said honey you know what I don't think you're going to see me anymore he just step out in Revelation that's why the Bible said and God took him and he was not found hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God a life full of Faith a life full of Revelation Hallelujah he said blessed are thou Simon of bar Jonah lot of person believe that when you have house when you have car or so much food you're blessed you're so blessed but you know what material things just doesn't make you blessed Hallelujah you know what when the Bible said in Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the name of God and our father Jesus who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings you know what that all can also means every every spiritual blessings that blessings means Joy it means peace God has given you peace and once you have peace you're are blessed when the storm comes and the flood comes I'm talking about your situation and you can find calmness you can find joy and said you know what I'm going to praise God Hy out go this pain man rock my body but I will praise God Hy out you're are blessed when the tree boy was cast in the fire hallelujah what was steering at them was a was that H was the enemy because the fire represents the enemy you know what they weren't looking at their destructions they were looking at the joy you know I believe that they were even citing the Psalms of David y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no Heil because you know what perfect love casted out all fear I will not fear the hands of the devil because I have Christ in my soul you know what the the prophet said they were having a Revival in that fire burdens in so much that the Son of God stepped down hallu Hallelujah the Son of God leave the throne and Ste down himself he didn't send Michael he didn't send worood he didn't send Gabriel he came himself Hallelujah you know what my sons is down there I feel I feel the worship Hallelujah and the worship get to me and the Bible said that the princes were sitting Hallelujah and jump up and said have we not cast threee person in the fire Hallelujah one of the prince say yes it is true but it said I saw the fort hallah IAI for you know what I'm going to give you the description this for is not the Son of God it is Christ the sent one the Messiah that came down to deliver me to deliver you Hallelujah and the word of God said Hallelujah there not even fire could hurt them when Jesus said in St Luke 10: 19 he said nothing shall hurt you Hallelujah nothing shall hurt you nothing Saints you have the authority you have the power nothing can hurt you because the authority lies in you it is in you you know that the devil knows that the devil knows that he can't hurt you but that doesn't stop him to scare you that doesn't stop him from scaring you he knows that he can scare you but he knows that he cannot hurt you Hallelujah he knows that if I can just Kure them and let them think that higher I can hurt them I can have I can put them in one little corner Hallelujah and I can throw some punes but when you understand who you are that you are the Son of God I will not be defeated I will not bound in that circumstances I will not stand in this condition I know where I am evil sea can obey me even the trees can obey me I have the authority it you know what you want me to go a little bit further even the devil can obey you the devil knows that he knows that the devil knows that when you understand who you are even himself have to be subjected to you you know that there's a difference brother Dale between prayer and command big difference sometime our situation doesn't need prayor brother Matt it doesn't need prayor you know what it needs it needs commanding and sometimes when the situation is calling for commanding we keep praying we keep praying we keep praying and we're not getting we're not seeing the result we need to change and approach it's not is that does not require praying in his command you have the authority to command your situation you have the authority to command the circumstances around you you have that power inside of you in the book of St Luke St Matthew St Mark Mark chapter 11 Jesus the Bible said he felt hungry when he came to the Fig Tree he fell hungry but the Fig Tree didn't bear the Bible said Jesus cursed it he cursed it then the disciples when they saw it the other day they start to Marvel they start to Marv you know what Jesus didn't pray he commanded it creation recognize Authority when the word of God said the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God we must understand what that statement means what that scripture means when the word creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God you know what that mean when the sons of God when creation responds to the command of God that's what what it means Hallelujah that's what it means when the word creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God it doesn't mean to keep reciting it over it means you need to respond respond to the command of God that's what it means he said Jesus curs the fig tree they begun to Marvel Jesus start to show them the difference between prayer and command Hallelujah he said if you speak to this mountain if you speak to this mountain and tell it to come out of his place it shall obey you that means you command it situations require some situation doesn't require prayer it just require command you have the ability you have the power to command your situation to command your environment you know what this environment that I'm in I'm tired of this I'm commanding it I'm Shifting the Atmosphere you have the power to shift Your Atmosphere Hallelujah you have the power to shift Your Atmosphere did you know that you can shift Your Atmosphere even at your workplace did you know that even when you go to the supermarket and you feel the the presence of certain spirits around you you can shift that atmosphere when you go out to heat you can shift the atmosphere wherever you go you are an atmosphere shifter because you know what you're carrying the glory of the glory inside of you Hallelujah you are a glory carrier you know the beauty about this Glory carrier it doesn't leave you you know what the beauty about this Glory carrier if you lay in if you lay if you lie your bed in hell is there some situation is hell but Jesus said I'm dear with you you know what some situation you may take a SHP and go to the own utmost path of the sea is still there Hallelujah the glory the glory doesn't leave you you know what we're changing from glory and to glory and to glory and to glory and the beauty about this Glory you know what it does you're pregnant with it thank you Lord you know what even even in the natural in the natural the natural types of spiritual a female in the natural when she's pregnant she has to careful of what she eat Hallelujah she doesn't eat any anything like that no she's careful because she's carrying life she she understand she's aware that what she consumes in can affect what she's carrying on the inside she started to take precaution when she steps Hallelujah she doesn't just step down she has to take precaution Hallelujah of how she step of how she walk Hallelujah she's very careful the natural types of spiritual what about the spiritual hallelujah hallelujah what about the spiritual you know what we have to feed on what the life requires us to feed on because everything that we heit it affects the life inside of us each steps that we walk it affects the life inside of us the footstep of a righteous man is ordered by the Lord is ordered by the Lord what we heat affects on the inside that's why brother Paul said it is not high but the Christ that liveth in me is the Christ dwelleth in me Hallelujah you have the authority to forgive sins you know what Sometimes some people they can't even pray because you know what they don't know how to approach God they don't know how to approach God to ask him for forgiveness but they may know how to approach you Hallelujah and you have the authority to forgive them they asked Jesus what Authority you have to forgive sins he said the son of man has power to forgive sins Hallelujah to forgive sins did not brother James said confess your faults one to another confess your faults one to another what do you think brother James would say that if you did not have the power to forgive sins you know that when you're confessing the false one to another it means I'm forgiving you I am forgiving you you know what and when I forgive you Hallelujah you know I'm giving you peace I'm giving you the joy of Christ that you may go with the joy that you may go with the peace that you may go with freedom Hallelujah when I Jesus when they brought the woman that was caught in the act of adultery the very law said she must be stoned to death but Jesus did opposite of what the law said the law require Stone to death which is condemnation Jesus never come to pass condemnation he said I come that that I might give them life and give them more abundantly that's my purpose thank you that's my purpose so when I see somebody on the street and they're telling me about their pth pass the experiences my first impression is not to condemn you it's to give you life it's to give you a new chapter it's to give you a new beginning I don't care what you did yesterday I don't care what you're doing now you know what I am here I come to turn on the light there's a man to switch on the light Hallelujah follow me as I follow Christ I come to lead you in the right path Hallelujah that's our purpose here because we are the son of man up on the earth you are Christ hallelujah oh Jesus I have understanding of who I am I have a knowledge of who I am you know what and I'm a and I have a apply the wisdom the application of it the prophet said Jesus he knows who he was he understand who he was and where he come from and it works for him he said if that work for Jesus it can work for you too isn't that right you know what Jesus said I come from God and I'm going back to God hallelujah hallelujah can say I come from God yes sir and I'm going back to God hallelujah because the same characteristics that is in Jesus is inside of his body you know what the Bible said in Ephesians 2 he has Quicken it us Quicken it the word quick Quicken it means to make alive to become alive you are alive unto God that means you're pass from death which is condemnation Hallelujah condemnation you have pass from Death unto life which is the newness of life and that newness of life now is when it bringing out the things of Christ the characteristics of Christ the nature of Christ that's the newness of Life Hallelujah because now and the Bible said and has raised us up Hallelujah he has raised us up Hallelujah we are raised with Christ Hallelujah we are raised with Christ that raised means Resurrection now wonder why Paul said in the book of Colossians 3 he said we are risen with Christ that's why brother Paul said in Philippians 2 he said I want to know him and the power of his resurrection you know what when you know him and the power of his resurrection you know things that concern you in Christ you find yourself doing it you know what I am Christ upon the Earth my purpose is to give life is to give Grace is to give peace Hallelujah that's my purpose thank you Lord Sometimes some people hallelujah you know what some situation even most counselors know this some situation when people are telling you about their problems their problems and so forth you know sometimes it just require a simple solution a simple solution but you have Sometimes some people just giving them a whole entire chapter or even a book go do this go do this go do that go do that darly just need just a simple solution you know what is that mean the Bible said because he said the spirit worketh in the children of Disobedience that's how simply is the spirit work in the children of Disobedience because your Disobedience the spirit is influencing you to do this to do that to misbehave to behave this way to your husband to behave this way to your wife to behave this way in your workplace because you're disobedient so all it needs stop being disobedient move away from that come down cloth yourself with humility understand where you went wrong acknowledge you're wrong you know sometimes they all need to say I am sorry I am sorry that's all it needs you know what I was wrong yesterday only you know the way that I talk to you I was wrong I shouldn't have talked to you that way Hallelujah you know what I shouldn't have moved the chair I was wrong to move the chair because if I didn't move the chair it wouldn't create that argument even want to create that hostility that we're encounter within the home so all we need to do is just acknowledge when we are wrong that's all it needs the Bible said a soft hand turn to we Ro but Grievous words s of anger Hallelujah but sometimes when we fail to understand come back down to Revelation the three steps of Revelation knowledge understanding and wisdom know when to apply wisdom know when to to use the application of wisdom into the situation that's all he needs turn your to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 amen do you love him this morning praise the Lord you know I will be going very quick after church you know my boss asked me to um I was supposed to do some work yesterday but I didn't finish so he wanted me to finish it today I said I'm going to church you know what but I said I

you know sometimes when you need strength to pray I must be there with you to help you pray sometime when you need a Hands to Hold I must be there to hold your hands and said you know what you're not in this alone I am here with you I am fighting with you you know what the battle is not yours alone it is the Lord and if it is the Lord it concerns me it concerns me amen praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 1 brother Paul said cease not to give thanks for you I'm so thankful for you today amen making mention of you in my prayers wow my Lord Brother Paul you was speaking to the Ephesians Church I made mention of you in my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom that can also means Revelation the spirit of wisdom also means Revelation glory to God hallelujah Revelation the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of ation is the spirit of Christ you know when you get Christ you get a complete package it's a complete package you get everything now wonder why the prophet said when you have the Holy Ghost inside of you I want this to sink deep in your heart he said when you have the Holy Ghost inside of you all that you got needed of in this life all he never said some is said all that you got he needed of in this life is already he never said it's going to be he never said it's going to be he said it is already in you when you have him you are the full package it's already in you Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him can I use the word in him instead of a because we are in Christ Hallelujah we are in Christ isn't that right Hallelujah in the knowledge in him Hallelujah the eyes of your understanding you see the word understanding keeps coming you up understanding the highs of your understanding being enlightened thank God for our understanding being enlightened through Revelation Hallelujah my understanding is to be the Son of God my understanding is that I am the resurrection and the life my understanding that I am the light of the world I am the salord of the Hur I am the way I am the truth I am the life you know what can I go B further I am Grace and you know what I'm not just Grace I am full of it I am full of grace you know what I have mercy to give blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy Hallelujah blessed are the pure in spirit Hallelujah blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the hurt you know what I am full of the Beatitudes up on the mountain Hallelujah we may not be up on the mountain that Jesus was when he preach the Beatitudes but we are in the mountain of Christ we are on the Mountain of God today that's why this church is built up the church Hallelujah is situated on the mountain of God and the Mount of God is Christ himself Hallelujah when the Bible said in the book in the Old Testament and Moses went in the mount what is that Mount I thought it was on the mount it means he went into the spirit of God he went into the spirit of God in so much that when he came down from the mountain his face was So Glorious they could not look at him they had to cover their faces Hallelujah we are in the Mount of God which means the spirit of God you know what mountains mean elevated the spirit of God means elevated hall hallelujah when you're in the spirit of God it carries you up you are on a mountain you are elevated Hallelujah you have climbed up hallelujah thank you Jesus Ephesians 1 he said to know what is the hope of his calling Hallelujah and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints thank God what a price that brother Paul pray that prayer oh my God hallelujah you know what we should all pray that same prayer for each and one each each other Hallelujah we should all pray that prayer for each other for us to have the knowledge the understanding and the wisdom of God that should be our prayer because when we are of us have that we will work together and we will be in one line Hallelujah the Bible said in the Ephesians 4:3 one of the responsibility of the fivefold ministry is to bring them to the understanding of the Son of God hallelujah it's about Unity Revelation brings Unity Jesus can I Heck on that again Revelation brings Unity Revelation is not separation how could people say that God is giving them Revelation and they're way over there and her person is way over there that's not Revelation when we have revelation we come together there must be a coming together that's what Revelation does it bring us together Hallelujah you know what what you know what Jesus said to Peter Peter when you are converted strengthen your Breen he never said stay away from your breing Hallelujah strengthen your bre can I say this when we drink in the spirit we are strengthening each other you know what that word drink also means to it means food it means nourishment you know what my duty is to give you nourishment is to nourish you is to give you food that's why brother Paul said I must give them strong meat Hallelujah strong meat because we're drinking in the spirit Hallelujah I am strengthen you Peter when you're converted
