amazing god wow amen God bless you and God loves you and we love you right after God is and God cares about our lives and our situations and and our needs he cares about us all amen God had great plans for us and he still has them they haven't changed amen amen just one announcement before we preach the March 2nd will be uh when we do our finances and and stuff business hope there all that's are welcome that's part of the church the body and and uh that supports the church we'll vote on the the BR the brothers and uh do our business and also the 23rd uh Zachary is coming uh to minister for us we have a few few different Brothers down the road that are coming just next months or different things but Zachary will be the next brother we talked to Brother Kyle he going to come in about six weeks and different ones we talk to and and uh we met uh just a just a quick testimony on we went to the ministers meeting that's in Ohio and and it was more than wonderful and uh and uh there was 31 ministers there and almost majority of them two-thirds of them at least were pastors huge amount and uh you know even even this message this morning i' say you know you know when a minister messages it's not for it's it's not necessarily for every individual it's it might not even be for one single person here the message this morning not not me for one person present but it might be for the spirit of the age and the environment and the world we're living in it might be for the people that you're rubbing shoulders with yeah yeah okay amen but I would I would say this and I say this with uh uh you know maybe I'm out of order to say this but I would tell you this and and all the people are represented the ministers are more united than the people they they literally are it was it was unbelievable we were like the first man to leave at 7:30 and we were there at 6:00 or 10:30 I mean and it was good we drove back cuz they had freeze and rain the next morning and you know they they they talked about things and I mean generally about don't judge one another God uses pennies some people grow slower than others all those things some of those things the people we thought that had it they quit the people we didn't think that have it they'll be there yep all those things that amen ministers you'd be you would be stunned to know the unification of the ministers but it was it was that awesome of a meeting and amen and so we just praise God for friends so we did have one quick announcement Lan was the only Minister woman there and they were very concerned that you know we were letting wives in the Pulpit that's a joke brother Chad said we're not telling nobody we C women preachers amen that's just a inside joke but it was amazing and and many many friends actually de George Smith was there he wants to come to our church he's coming this year this summer um we've actually built a real friendship he is hilarious is actually the truth he's if you see him with his his hinder side he is just a clown I mean in a good way he's a wonderful brother and uh uh I said do you want to come he said I course I want to come there amen and just uh uh just a multiple good things we also met a brother that we hadn't seen for years and years and when I say years probably 20 years Jim Swanson is uh you I remember him I remember him preaching a message in chatam I never forgot it was the last message he preached there he said God has given me the the spirit of wire cutters to cut the barbwire fences and set his people free I told him that I said I remember I remember it like unbelievable because I was in that situation and God preached to me he didn't remember the message himself oh I said me and my wife do amen God ain't here to put you in bondage no no no period of any kind of bondage amen amen so it was wonderful let's stand and we'll read his word just uh you pray for me I pray for you God will speak through US amen Matthew 11:6 and then we're going to read Romans 8:28 amen are this is just a complete opposite of what we preached last SU Sunday and uh um last Sunday preaching on reverence this exact opposite Matthew 116 and blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose Lord God I pray that you'll just just uh unite us this morning unite us in your word and Lord help us as we show the scriptures and and your word Lord God that may you anoint it and be with the speaker and the hearer Lord God that will understand your plan in your beautiful name we pray amen you may have your seats I'd like to to uh Minister on this and like I said already this this is not that I don't feel that here at all so this is not uh an inside uh you know meal or whatever if it any say could be for me uh more than anybody but I've been working on this for weeks and God just unfold even this morning God give me something in the shower and I and I put it on my phone and put it on my iPad when I came here but I want to show you this scripture Matthew 116 that John here gave Jesus the greatest insult the greatest disgusting insult that could humanly be given now John was and you know I I would say this that you know uh let's just look at the meaning you know the meaning of offended is to uh re be resentful upset wounded displeased put out angry disgruntled insulted or indignant now that's that's the exact opposite of reverence excuse me and here we see that John was in prison and he sent his disci in this scripture he sent his disciples to see you know are Jesus are you are you the one are you the anointed Messiah are you the Christ are you the one that was promised to come for us or have we missed it all and should we look for another and I want to I want to say this I know and you know this is uh subject to your interpretation of the word you know when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost we become it's Christ in us now I know there's some scriptures talks about that you know you're a babe and you grow but Christ was never a babe amen Christ was never a baby so if you've there and there can be no two men living in a body so if you're dead and now Christ lives in you then you are the example Christ you are Christ so it's not us and you know we we even pre preach this a different way about the Father the father's never offended with his family and and believe me this is God it's a completely different thing but God God's dealing with something in the environment of where we live in the world in the environment not just this church but and and even the ministry and all the churches represented and it's a spirit on the age and and so but we are not we are not got the spirit of this age but we're we're rubbing shoulders with the spirit of this age and so we got to make sure that we keep the spirit of the age out and we have the spirit of Christ inside of us and so here God and the prophet gives some amazing quotes later on but here John comes and he he bluntly publicly insults Jesus to the to the highest degree you couldn't have been assaulted anymore because number one John was the closest person to Jesus alive he didn't just introduce Jesus he he was there to pronounce him and he he he was the messenger before God and I step aside I I must decrease so you must increase and he and he walked right with Jesus and he still couldn't figure them out but what I want to show you in this scripture is when John left Jesus gave John the highest regards and the greatest blessing of any breathing man on the earth he never said well never did think much of John anyway I never did think John had the Holy Ghost I never did agree with John's Doctrine he was always kind of leaning the one way no Jesus never that he said what did you go out to see he said I want to tell you something there's a man that has never been greater born of a woman than the man that just insulted me to my face can we do that can we say that about our enemies that say I don't think you got it I don't think you're called I don't think you're part of the family I think you're off I think you're missing it I don't think you're on the word can we just can we say wow brother Brown gave some quotes about that people that would come and insult we should get to a point that we would come that the people that come and say you know I I don't agree with that brother Dale he's just a ridiculous he he's not nothing he's you know he's just a like some of the insults that I got letters that get sent to me you know he's not called he just repeats what other people repeat and and you know he he had a high ego and he just left the start as he was a baby and all those those and you just say oh God bless you I pray for you I think you're amazing child of God he said said you would get to the point that you could pray for your enemies now see if we take the scripture and I want to keep this right in the scriptures now if we take that all things work together for good How could a holy ghost filled believer ever be offended well I don't like how you do that I think that's wrong but it was God's plan God put you in that position well God I I don't like it that that you know I well I don't I I don't but and you can't put that that all things are worked together for good to them that love God according to his purpose according to his not brother Dale's purpose or not Wyoming's purpose or not even you know the message purpose that but to God's purpose and so we're filled in a world of offenses I mean anybody that's breathing knows that he said this what the prophet said he said how can you tell he said 'well just give them the word test he said you you can know it he said' just speak the word and see what they say about it but I just give you the word test if you can be offended is Christ Living in you cuz Christ could not be offended let me say it like this like I can only preach from my standpoint like whether you're serving God or not don't offend me because I work out my own salvation with fear and trembling whether you see my Doctrine or not don't offend me cuz that's between you and God not between you and the pastor and whether you come to this church or not it don't offend me either cuz it's not my people it's God's flock and God calls whoever he wants to call in places whoever it calls so see we get really when we really get out of the way and we're dead you can poke somebody in the cket and say you're disgusting you got a boy orderer and then I'll say Well they're dead are we dead well we we can compare if we're dad what let's finish this quote we can compare this if we're dad I mean if the World's dad or if we're individually Dad I'm not saying by by how we handle the word see see if they don't believe it that that just if they don't believe the word then it just shows that they don't have no seed germ in them and they're deceived amen here's another one he said the one thing you can know if you're a Christian is when you're fully agree with the word of God you know I'm going to tell you something most message Believers hang on don't agree with the word of God yes Mo I mean the Bible under proper definition they don't believe it no they do not believe it I'm going to show you some examples you can't say we might get this I'm going way ahead of my myself but you can't say well brother Brown said if you go to a church and and you think he preached off just spit out the pit don't stay home we have 50% of this message sitting home somebody well well you oh bless God brother Brown you know what you know what they were sharing at the ministry meeting it was really good you see you know what's the evidence of the holy spirit it's not believe the word for your day oh but that's what brother Brown said well I know it is you see he said well if you believe the word for the day the one of the ministers said he said I know a whole bunch of gay people that believe in brother Brown is prophet and the message hour is true but they're gay will they be in heaven wow but the Bible says when the spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide you into all truth we know there's people staying home and I'm I'm I'm sorry I'm messed up here but God ain't and we know there's people staying home because their Pastor would say the brother Brown made mistakes so they are qualified to break the next scripture that says Don't forsake the assembling of yourself together and go to a pastor that makes mistakes that qualifies you like one qualification qualifies you to break another scripture I want to give you an insight to this brother Brown said 224 times mistakes and almost 100% of them was him me we I and everyone 224 times so if your pastor says brother makes mistakes brother B said he makes mistakes that's right brother B said there ain't never a man born that's infallible that's right God is infallible prophets are not infallible brother Brown said brother Brown said in questions answers said it three times and I'm way way way out to Lun chair in my head but he said three times he said my answers are not in ible uhoh if you can be offended by that you're not born again that's right if you're going to be offended by that you're not born again here here in Hebrews 511 it says whom have many things to say unto you and it's hard to UT seeing that you are dull of hearing and when the time has come that you ought to be teachers you have need to be teached again because the first principles of the Oracles of God being such as need milk and not strong meink and everyone that needeth milk is unskillful in the word of God righteous for he is a baby and strong meat belongeth to them that are not offended full age even those by reason who use the senses exercise tries to discern both good and evil wow so here in Matthew we see that John came and he sent his disciples to see are you it is this message this message of of Christ and salvation and Grace you know I want I sh you that message was rejected by the church they loved the law so I mean even Peter struggled that with Paul because he thought you should be circumcised literally in the flesh Paul brought Grace and there's many different definitions where the The Message Church will grab on to law when Paul's was I I want to show oh man alive this is unbelievable but let me show you something example do you know the very definition of qualification of a pastor that if you took the Old Testament Paul couldn't preach cuz he had a bad eye so when Paul gave the qualifications for New Testament ministers he gave it completely different than the Old Testament because he would have disqualified himself brother Chad Lamb couldn't Minister because he's bald and that's in the ex act same verse of the one that you might believe bless God I'm not preaching on that but God is Paul had a bride eye you can't be a minister in the Old Testament with the bad eye but you think you got God figured out and you can take and pick this and I'll pick this the brother says something wrong I'll stay home and I'll watch brother Brown said God will never use a mechanical device for his holy spirit to go flu so we should all go home listen to all the ministers on YouTube and really be blessed to God no no no that's unscriptural God could have chose the whole world he could have ch donkey women men you know the Sun the moon all these things to preach but he chose the man so all you that are living on the diet of the YouTube you're puking cuz it's not scriptural God chose a man now is that evil to watch no no no it's not even to you see with me and if you can be offended by that but that's God's word amenes see the Bible says that you must be born again and the Holy Ghost cannot be offended it's not possible a dad person cannot be offended Christ ain't offended because the world won't choose him he knew that from the beginning amen the problem is with the Believers the heaven went far enough now brother Brown gave that clear quote to every one of you know he said Billy Graham would go to Ministry and I'm just I got the quote right in front of me but I'm just saying up from things he said you know he had preached and the 10,000 would get converted come back a year later and there'll be 10 there he said you never took them into Christ they were on the journey oh praise God they were on the journey but you know brother Brown said things like this he said before you get the baptism of the Holy Spirit God gives you a new spirit and he said almost all believers stop when they get the new spirit because they become gentle and respectful and and say God bless you and courtesy and all that and that was just this a quote brother he said God just give you that spirit so you could put up with the Holy Spirit or get along with the Holy Spirit is what he said and so you sto way short and you can tell that when people can get offended so if you can get offended how I eat dinner or don't eat dinner or because I'm ugly and fat or skinny and tall remember Jesus was insulted he just smiled and said wow amen you didn't go far enough when you got the new heart the new spirit God puts the holy spirit in there right beside your new spirit and the cross becomes lined up with feathers amen and you can say anything you want to about me if I have the Holy Spirit I'm glad you're not my judge whether I'm going through or qualified or child of God or called to the ministry or pra God Amen blessed are those that are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven anden we've all had a certain amount of C blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted the prophets which were before you it's Matthew 5:10 and 12 so God came down and put his own Spirit into us and then so see I said it was not necessarily in this church but in your Christian Journey if you can see somebody get offended you know watch watch let me back the card up you know and this is God coming to me you know see brother Brown and and it's the truth but you know see how you have to bring everything and caught new and brother Bown said don't give me one scripture give me the flow of the scripture from Genesis to Revelation and blend them together that the spirit of the the when the spirit of Truth is come he'll let him lead and guide you in all truth that's not leaving the scripture so you know when you say and I believe it I I actually do believe it but you know the the the the the the the the proof of the Holy Ghost is believe in the word for your day but you know I've had Brothers Tell Me That by this message and by what brother Brenham William Mary Brenham says they're they're totally legally qualified to divorce and remarry oh totally they they give me the quote 100% press God for a prophet brother Bram said that the Bible was his absolute it was the uninf fallible anointed word of God he said multiple times my words can fail but let's read the let's open up the scriptures CU these words will never fail so try to Remar with scripture it's not possible you can remarry under one condition die you have to murder your other partner or pray they die or get in a car accident give them a ticket to goly in the US they'll probably crash especially if there's Russians on the plane I mean there's different ways to go about it amen plane had three major plane crashes in the United States in 8 days I think I'll fly from somewhere else yeah praise God hallelujah amen so see see people are twisting this message brother is my pastor that's a bunch of Amen you know blaspheme you know there's a place in the world that says that if God himself came today that he would push play and Obey really it's the headquarters you know Catholic church has a headquarters you know amen so you know so you know what I mean that don't take away nothing it don't discourage me but when the spirit of Truth has come he'll lead and guide me in all truth amen don't live by your it by yourself it's Christ that liveth in you when you receive the Holy Ghost amen so let's just go we're growing day when we get bigger I'm just I'm trying to get to my main text here he said when somebody talks about you he said it won't hurt them when they laugh at you and insult you he said don't pay no attention to you he said they got one thing he said they're just he said you're so full of the glory of the Holy Ghost he said when they come up and say you're nothing but a great big hipocrite brother Dale will you say well praise the Lord God bless you too all right remember read the quote this is Divine Healing when you know certain certain things are going on at the church and you ought to not be going he said you just pray about it amen once here let's just go fast and get into our main scripture here John 3 three Jesus and said ver except the man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven that means you have to die and when you're dad you can't be offended so let's just look at some other scriptures here before we go into our main text John uh or Hebrews uh 10:9 for I came for I came down from heaven not to do my will but the will of him that sent me now any one of us here that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know brother Brown said but being a Christian is living for others you're not here to make a big bank account no it's fine if that comes along you maybe you'll share it with me or something or we'll go on a trip together but you're here to live for others brother bam you know what brother bam said he said I couldn't go to Mexico after i' ate breakfast in Texas and I crossed the border and there was a baby there with a big stomach that was starving to death he said I could never be a rich man I could never have $100,000 in the bank and Drive by that boy with a big belly and know that he would die of hunger said I couldn't do it amen not to do my own will but to do the will of him that sent me and John 4:38 what oh look at the Tren here John 4:38 and when he said un me lo I come to do thy will oh God that's that's this scripture is for every one of us I come to do thy will oh God I didn't come to do brother Dale's will I wouldn't be preaching here this morning but I come to do God's will oh Lord amen what's the next scripture John 4th oh I might have been given those scriptures sorry they're on top one to I might have been giving them the opposite way John 4:34 Jesus said unto them my my meat is to do the will of him that said me that's for you that's that's for you and me my my real meal is to do God's will because I'm not alive no more amen hallelujah and we're actually just getting into but here's a quote here before we bre dive into like I got multiple examples in the Bible how before the holy most of these are before the Holy Ghost was given the people could not be and believe me I mean it was right to the point of death they could not be offended and they never had what you have so we got great hope watch here what brother bam said he said you know now you know Christianity has changed so much and these last days I want to just put in a disclaimer here I'm just stepping out of what the prophet said it's a lot more the last days now than than it was when he said this now you know Christianity has changed so much in these last days now you know you got to Baby the people you got to promise them a whole lot you got to give them a whole lot make them believe well if you come to church I'll make you be like the Usher the Deacon the piano player you know I'll let even this he said that's not Christianity CH Christianity is not being baby Christianity is rugged he said right Christianity is not being hot hot bad plant he said a hot bad plant a hybrid plant mostly he said you have to spray them with all kinds of little jugs to keep the mosquitoes off them you know I was talking thinking about this when we had Camp me I had one brother say after he slept in his tent two nights he said you know I had a sore back for two or three days after so it was a tent it was 2 days of your life half the world sleeps on the ground all the time we are so separated from reality you wouldn't believe it try sleeping on Sand I mean your forefather slept in a straw tick we put straw ticks Under the Tent oh oh I don't think I I'll come next year I can't sleep in a tent oh by the way I won't give to missions either cuz they sleep in a tent every day CU they're homeless rugged Christianity is not a hot Bud plant you spray them he said keep the bugs off he said that's because of weakness that's the way you have to do with a lot of Christians you have to spray them with a lot of promises and you don't need to do that with the real genuine healthy plant it don't need nothing the bugs stay off it that's calling Jesus on the scene a 64 quote let's get into the meat and bones of our message here here we have an example of nahem in 2 Kings 5 1:4 and I'm not going to read the scriptures I'm going to tell you the story he was a great Soldier and they had went against Israel and captured prisoners so you know there's other countries thinking they're going to take over CA Canada they're going to come in with their military and they're going to capture us and we're going to go back and be forced labor under their thing I'm I'm just trying to make this Bible thing this is what happened now I'll guarantee you it wasn't a pretty sight the syrians had gone down by companies and had brought away captivities of the land of Egypt a little maid and she waited on non's wife she was a prize of war and a slave let me rephrase that she was a prize of War her parents were probably killed for sure her dad and she was a slave and she was The Spoils of War now I'll guarantee you I'm that little Ma I would have had a chip on my shoulder and it wouldn't have been no little chip it would have been the size of a Tomahawk chess missile and Ne man her Lord got leprosy had leprosy and he was hiding it from the people cuz they would have took him out of the city because he had a big job so he was like most of our offenses and sins we tried to hide them from all our public people and put a smile on WE tape a smile on we hide our leprosy under the coat and they were doing things to hide his leprosy or his own government would have put him away and he would have lost his pension plan and she said I would to God that you known that there's a real God in Israel a real man of God wait a minute wait a minute wait she was offended you know offended people never help you she was a prize of War she was a slave she was in a another country by force and she was going to help her her most chosen enemy Hey listen I can help you I can't help you but my God can help you and he sent a prophet in my home country and if you go see him he'll take care of your problem just like that a little Maid would the God my Lord were with and she said unto her mistress I would the God my Lord were with the prophet that was down in our country he could recover him of his leprosy I would have been praying with to God that he'd cut your throat I'm just telling you cuz I'm still human and there's a whole buch more of you that in the secret heart of your thing wouldn't be thinking that the most worst enemy I'm going to help you in Acts 6 here they needed Godly men to help run the people of God and Stephen was one that stood out as a godly man and he was like most well he was like many Godly man you know yeah I wish I would have put this in I just read a St and it's a big old man in this in maybe England even he said you know anybody that speaks the truth is hated remember I showed I I wish I had his name anybody if I tell you the truth that's why the churches that tell the real truth have empty seats but if I said you can just oh just love you know this place would fill right up praise God and Stephen was the man and he told them the real truth step was full of faith and power and had great signs and miracles among the people he was a man of God but the problem was that the Believers that were with him didn't want the truth that's the truth see and you can read that in verse Acts 6 I put a few scriptures down but I'm just trying to and acts 7 is where it really comes down and they stoned Stephen and called upon their God they thought they had the same God as Stephen oh my goodness I'm going to take care of that Pastor and they were praying to their God thinking they had the blessings of God just like Saul I'm doing God's work killing people and they God and saying the Lord Jesus oh here this was Steven actually sorry he called then Steven called on to his God saying Lord Jesus sorry I receive my spirit and he kneeled down but the people that were stoning him believed they were doing God's will cuz they were they were actually pricked in their heart but they were Believers maybe we'll read that acts 7:54 and when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gased on him with their teeth yeah but him being full of the Holy Ghost look steadfast up into heaven and seen the glory of God Jesus stand at the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing the right hand of God and they cow cried with a loud voice and plugged their ears and ran to him in one Accord and caused him to go out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their coats in the young man's feet whose name was our greatest Messenger to this AG the New Testament age Paul you know they mentioned that at the ministers meeting said who would have believed that Saul had the baptism of the Holy Ghost bless God I would have never thought he would have made it he wrote all the New Testament most of it and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice saying Lord okay this is how offended stevenh was now he told them the truth not like let's back to C up if you watch this story number one Steph never asked for the job they looked for holy men that was stood out that knew the word of God and Stephen was picked and he said it was full of power and full of the Holy Ghost he never asked for the job and then they didn't like what the Holy Ghost told them in his testimony and this is how offended he was he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice Lord Lord lay not this sin to their charge and he and when he had said this he died offended well I don't think I'm really you know you know God's trying to I'm showing you something see you know there's there's not a and this is what the minister said there's no continuity in the body of the Believers today like the Believers that say we should take every word that brother Brown says th say the Lord don't come a half an hour early for service probably 50% of them don't even come to service or brother Brown said don't shrink your post of Duty Put Your Shoulder to the wheel and really help the work of God in the local assembly the pastor don't have to do all the shovel in the snow and cutting the grass oh I don't mind doing it by the way but it I mean I'm not I'm not preaching that's what our Prophet said that's right that's a prophet you love yes sir you wonder why you don't see God it's cuz you don't mow the grass you wonder why you don't see God in the service this morning you never shoveled the snow in the sidewalk you wonder why you don't see God you never came a half an hour early you wonder why you don't see God CU you don't want to hear truth truth truth you're hated for truth Daniel Daniel was a real man of God he he he he chose in his heart that he wouldn't defy his body Temple by eating the king's meat and the wine amen and they threw him in jail because they hated Daniel he was so blessed that the king watched His blessings and they said hey if I hang around this guy it might be a benefit you know like when I go to the cattle say everybody wants to sit with Tommy temps it's cuz he feeds 5,000 cattle and he's probably worth like 100 million but I don't think it rubs off on me I mean he's my friend i s my you see what I mean but that's how it is like that's why everybody wants to go to like that church because they think the holy ghost that they got it'll rub off on them or the gift that they got brother Braham said if I try to be one of those people I'll be a clown but we're all trying to be clowns cuz we want to hang around those people thinking oh bless God we'll be we'll get what they got no I don't what they got I want what Jesus got brother bam said he said I'm afraid that we're getting you to the spirit of the pastor and I add even the prophet we got the spirit of the Prophet but what about the Holy Spirit what about God like I don't have to wear a belt buckle where cowboy hat have a have a have a gun and have a moose on my we we could hang moose here oh that wouldn't that look cool a big old antler and a fool that would really and a fish well and and that's okay and they're and I like that and they're nice and and it's not evil and all that but that was just the fleshy life of enjoying the environment of I'm happy it wasn't like thus saith you got to be that way amen and here when the king said he said then Daniel said unto the king oh King live forever they thre Daniel and J he done nothing nothing wrong by the way except pray and he never changed his testimony because they pressured him he still opened the windows and Daniel was so offended that when the king that threw him in jail came to find him he said oh King live forever my God has sent an angel to shut the lion's mouth that they may not have hurt me now I mean anybody throws me in the lon stand I'm not going to tell to live forever I'm going to hope that they have a short life maybe like uh amen wow let's look at the three Hebrew children meach and abedo mesach Shadrach Meshach and abedo sorry I I had all three here and they told the King Nebuchadnezzar they said you know we're not even careful how we'll answer you you know I want I want to throw something out here if you believe a minister is called of God it has nothing to do with the flesh like less than zero and if he's a man of God and he's careful what he says what God tells him he's he's a liar that's right amen cuz he ain't If he if I'm saying my words well they're they're they're they're not life and spirit and life they're death and destruction but if I'm saying What God Says see the three Hebrew children they were saying the words of life and they said we're not even going to be careful to say them to you cuz you only have power because my God allowed you to have the power and we're not afraid of you and they say if it be so that our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from this burning furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King but if not it's okay we're cool with you and we're cool with dying no they they they now that's being offended bless God I'm not doing nothing more in the church I ain't even going to sweep my 15 22 and 28 and behold a woman from Canaan came from the same coast and cried onto him saying Lord Lord have mercy this is the greatest one of all oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is gevy vexed with the devil now I just want to just go we we we're doing we're blowing this right off the charts for time but you know there's no Greater Love next to God's love than a father or Mother's Love people talk about a mother's love she carried that little baby she felt it move and everything and and just the the the feminine Spirit of a mother is to nurture and to just grow and everything to help that little baby that that mother heart was breaking because her daughter was vexed with the devil I mean she was at the lowest web of her Christian walk I mean she could just barely get in the church she was like oh my her burdens were yeah is that is that true were her burdens big her natural love for her daughter and she came to the one that she knew had the answer you with me so far hang on you're going to be surprised and Jesus answered her not a word you know that made me think of something I was fellowship and I talked to Paul Fontaine by the way next month he's coming on a Wednesday night you pick the Wednesday night if you want to see him come every Wednesday cuz I don't know which Wednesday it is he has two families that moved to Windsor and he's coming up to pray over their house and he's coming down to have fellowship with me and he said' it have to be a Wednesday and he said' it'll be one Wednesday in March but I he had text me and asked me about some Bel some people that were fellowshipping with his church that were by me and he wanted me to connect with them and somehow that text got mixed and I answered him like four months later and I'm like oh oh brother Paul I know you're not going to believe this yeah I know I know what you're already thinking that you know what he was thinking I don't like him I'm not fellowship with him I'm not connected with you that guy's a loggerhead you know he's you know come on everything you going think of and he was just trying to take care of a little sheep but I just missed it Jesus answered him not a word I said oh Paul I'm begging your forgiveness I never I there's no intent ear at all you ever pray and not get an answer and Jesus answered her not a word and the disci Les came and besid him saying send that woman away she's bothering us she bothering us she keeps on praying and all this crying and you know I heard a churches don't want people to make noise and cry I'll just tell you what noise will never scare me or the Holy Ghost you can cry weep run shout jump quiet does it makes me nerous I'm afraid everybody died I'm going to have a lot of funerals on Monday or something but you can weep and worship God and shout and like lose your mind and I want to be close to you if you see me leave the Pew and come over and stand up beside you when you're just going like this and raymen I'm going to want that pale to Splash on me if it ain't my pale of water I want to get the splashes off of yours bless God so we just put that devil to rest right now next time Jesus the next time the Satan tells you I'm making too much noise in church that is straight from the pit of Hell that ain't possible in worship it's not possible to make too much noise in worship it's not possible to be too drunk In Worship wow thank you Lord but Jesus answered and said unto him I'm not sent till the L sheep of the House of Israel now Jesus our lord okay let me just tell you what anybody a gentile in here were you offended at what he said he was saying it to the Gentiles he said I'm not sent to the last sheep of the House of Israel and then she came and worshiped him oh I'm not going to that church CU that Pastor you know he he says the truth and I have a hard time entering into worship cuz I'm afraid what he's going to minister after and saying Lord help me Lord help me I I just want to I'm trying to put Flesh on this that mother's heart was vexed and breaken and she was balling her face off and she was a wreck because the love of her heart was laying in a bad vexed with a demon that's right a woman was desperate and she had the right attitude she she had all these things but Jesus answered and said it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it oh that would have done her right there you'd be surprised what pastors talk about when pastors get together it's not me that I would cast it to dogs oh bless God that would have made the hair stand up on the back of my neck well Glory Hallelujah where's the next closest Message Church see she had approached the Lord Lord in the wrong way she had done everything right but at that point God wasn't sent to the Gentiles he was sent to the Jews and so she when she called him Lord you know and so watch how you take the scriptures the Bible said that he came to the world because he loved the world none would be lost and yet he's calling her a dog she was part of the world but see how you got to get the spirit of truth and the continuity of the script scripture at that time in the beginning of Jesus ministry he was sent to the Jews and his own refused them and he blinded them temporarily and grafted Us in and we don't want to get an eagle for that because if he cut off the natural Branch how much more can he break off the grafted Branch he said it's not children's meat that I give you to the dogs now I just tell you what like what would you think if I invited you over for supper I I remember remember having this question about somebody you know when we were young and we had young children then a few a very few maybe not too many we went to a couple's place and you know I from birth could not stand respector of persons I just I couldn't I couldn't from grade one kindergarten and you know I remember going there and me and L maybe Jared was born and they had all the kids sitting in a different table cuz might spill the milk and they gave them like hot dogs or macaroni now they probably loved it but we were sitting up with the candle and the lace tablecloth and we got like the shrimp and the the shrimp and the and the shrimp and the and the shrimp and the the the the the the smoke brisket and you know I come home that bothered me because the kids were like second class I hate that spirit I hate that Spirit God hates that spirit I hate respector a person it's a sin you're guilty of everything in the Bible you respector a person now in this minor case uh probably the kids were happy with their hot ducks and that but you know don't we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lie and if you pull your hand out of the pale of water it'll go love and you despite how important you are and this woman was so offended now she came and addressed God in the wrong way but then she came and worshiped God which she could do that and now this is the third strike in you're out and she said in verse 27 she said yes Lord truth Lord and yet even the dogs eat hot dogs even the dogs come to the table with the lace curtain and eat what the Masters put on there and Jesus was stunned he was stunned he was stunned it was like somebody hit him on the forehead with a bat he was stunned yeah and Jesus answer said unto her he said oh woman wow great is your faith be it unto thee according to thy will thy daughter will be made whole this very hour what would she a God if she would have been offended I mean I'm only human she had lots of opportunity to get offended I mean I would have been rating the choir with her and I would have said yes sister I understand your story bless God I'm almost getting offended just hearing it wow child Le make Believers believe so much false justifying forsaking thems together justifying everything they can find in the me justifying remarriage in the message justifying sitting home and listening to the YouTube internet the favorite preacher you want to hear justifying and and they got they got message bless God they got message I'll show you my quote and at the same time Shing their dropping their duties of supporting God's Kingdom in a local assembly or a local col or wherever God would place you maybe you need to move praise God brother Jeff moved amen see Ro Romans you know the people that would say that that would make prophets INF followable I'm going to read this and and this ain't I'm we're we're we're we're we're break down the end but Romans 8 see you know when you say the spirit of truth comes it will lead and guide you Romans 11:29 says for gifts and callings are without repentance so in the five-fold ministry uhhuh plus pray and Obey because God will obey this message that came out of a man's life mouth not every word of it he won't he's the god that gave it he's God himself God don't have to listen to me God is the one that speaks to me God don't have to listen to His prophets he's the one that speaks to the prophets it's the other way around it's God doing the given that's right wow he said now genuine Holiness Holiness is not part of me it's part of Christ Christ his Holiness watch what the prophet says here and I'm this is this is just to show you know there's spir it's not here but it's spirits in the things even US minister talked about it's things in the world it's coming around watch this I don't have one of these in my notes brother Bram said that the Gentile age started in Daniel and it started with Prophet worship and he said about one dozen times he said it will go out the exact same way if you were like all 12 of those quotes I will be very glad to send them to you it will go out the exact same way so if you believe we're at a Rapture time or we're at the end that means that the majority of the message will worship the prophet amen and you know the people that worship the prophet they think the pastor's wrong the teacher wrong the Evangelist is wrong the apostles wrong the missionaries wrong but the prophet what are you going to do with Romans [Music] 11:29 now now if you don't know me very well this message is Vindicated sent by God God will do nothing but he sends his secrets to the servants the prophets brother Brown is a major prophet to this age but if this offends you that what brother Brown says then you're worshiping a prophet that ain't infallible by his own words and he's not deity of God and he made loads of mistakes if you want to take every you know some people even for Christmas I'm going to preach on Christmas but I'm going to do it in July I'm tell you ahead of time or August and I'll show you everything but you know a lot of people that do things at Christmas time and you know by the way brother Brown said Christmas ain't going away and and I get together at Christmas just in case in case you had a heart attack but it a lot of people that go way out on Christmas they say well look at what the prophet did well the prophet also tried to shoot people he also tried to shoot himself and he also tried to commit suicide by grabbing the electric fence that's right so like see there's a veil and then there's thus sayith the Lord that's right he he had thus sayith the Lord this message you know I'm I'm going to give you a quote I'm going to jump I'm going to jump something and I'm going to leave it with you and I'll give you the answer when we quit this message I I'm going to give you the answer please don't walk out if you anybody starts walking out I'm going to give you the answer before you hit the door this message is not the absolute but inside the message is the absolute that's right this message is not the absolute you know even brother bam said himself he said we have no book but the Bible I think I'll witness and hand out a church book oh no brother B said we have no Creed but the message oh no no no book but the Bible no Creed but love no you know how's that go you know that's right the message is not the absolute but inside of it is the absolute Donnie Reagan said that but if I had said that you probably would have left the church but Donnie Reagan said it so he's Vindicated so brother Braham said I have no Holiness to present to God he said I make thousands of mistakes each month each year and surely I do here's another one here's the answer here's these answers are not infallible see because the scriptures are infallible and as far as I know they line up with the scriptures and I hope to make this plain that the tapes are kept now for everyone that want to get it and I could have it but I know that the scriptures but I know that the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not if that offends you you don't have the Holy Ghost that I have you don't even believe the prophet cuz he said that about like 36 times or something like that you know maybe that's enough for you maybe it's got to be hundred yeah I'm ready to vomit these people that worship the prophet they give me their pet quote that they can marry their you know their second third fourth wife but they W give me no scripture though no I won't give you that Matthew 1919 or I won't give you 1 Corinthians 7 no no to 10 you know I W I'm not going to give you those [Laughter] ones what ones you think brother brandham read yeah yeah he didn't read his own message he was the message he was preaching the message he said I made many mistakes and still make them and always will make them amen prophets are not infallible they're not Angels they're men you know the main people I'm closing on this when we preached on reverence the main people that were offend offended in the Bible the the two main examples in the Bible was Moses and the children of Israel they were offended with God every day Moses was offended with God when he called them he was offended with God when he sent him and he was offended with God before he could go into the promised land and the children of Israel were offended all the time all the time we looked at that last week so where do where do you sit or where do we sit or where does the world sit well there's never been a time in history when there's been more division more divorce more separation you know it used to be back about World War II you know you were committed you know like like divorce was like 1% you know you went to the same I'm not saying you have to I don't mean that cuz we had to come out of her my people and move into the truth but people never moved they never moved from the province they never moved from their Church they never quit their job whatever their dad was they were that for 100,000 years after and and then never they married the the neighbor's daughter and but now we have so much Earthly and phys spiritually and we're all offended or we deal with it I should say we deal with it but we can get to a point you know every one of those examples except Acts was before the Holy Ghost was given and I mean they were Radical decisions like people getting murdered and dying and if you testify and believe and I do that we're living in the greatest age we have never had the revealed word all the Mysteries are open the seals are broke the Bible's a brand new book it's I'm in love with God and and and and I I've seen them unveiled completely in the three room house and I've even had Fellowship not just in the kitchen in the living room but even in the bedroom and you can still get offended you if that's the case with the truth then you need to look in the mirror if somebody can show you Bible with scripture or Bible with the message Hub that's get what the prophet said directly to that scripture and that starts a little in you everybody's like oh I don't like where that's going you know if there's just a little oh oh oh just a first little hint of oh I'm offended there ain't one Speck of God in there because that is God man the revealed word the spirit and Truth when it comes and the message is when the spirit of truth comes it will lead and guide you in all truth the same as the Bible brother Brown said don't just give me one verse don't give me one verse but do it in continuity with the scriptures continuity by established by two or three Witnesses just the flow of God's spirit because remember even in this message he hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babe such as would learn you know and I've said this before and and I am going to shut up and I I I hope a couple of you will shake my hands before you leave but you know every doctrinal issue the brother Brown preached he preached both ways and he did it for a reason God allowed it for a reason for people to get if I didn't leave yep because you'll take your side and you won't look into what God's really trying to show you and brother Brown said this ain't leaving the word center of the road was the right place to be I could I could give you one dozen examples where brother Brown said exact opposite 100% exact opposite 100% not sort of 100% opposite white horse rider he believed it was God he changed and believe it was the devil that stumble you not at all it just says praise God he showed him the truth and he wasn't offended when God showed him the truth hallelujah you know brother Bram was praying for a prostitute and told the prostitute said you'll make a wonderful pastor's wife Hallelujah you didn't like that one did you yes sir he said it I can give it to you oh Moses wouldn't have qualifi or Paul wouldn't have qualified cuz he had a bad eye so we get so steeped in our doctrine that we divide and I want to just tell you something I've seen something this week and you know God brings everything in Contin I want to show you something when I went to bed last night I listen I've been last few months I've been listening to the New Testament and I I went to bed like at 7:00 so I can listen two hours of the Bible and I shut it off whenever I shut it off and you know it takes about three nights to go through the whole new testament and you know of course I do fall asleep when I turned it on last night guess what it was the first scripture that come up randomly I had no idea where I was stopping it my taex scripture today I just said thank you thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus I love you too God just does little things like that all the time he's awesome I lost with my train of thought what I was going to tell you about something I seen this week but amen God help us you know the minister said at The Minister's meeting you know what we were convinced was right we found out was different the people we thought thought that had it all they're not with us no more oh that's what I it come back to me God thank you Jesus the person was talking about they said in this age everything is even even physically the natural tapes of spiritual everything in this age please get this and I I promise I is to divide us the government is divide you the government everything is right I don't care if it's on living in the country vaccinations uh money retirement plan I don't care what it is it's divide and conquer politics is of the devil divide and conquer well bless God this is my fa bless God this my I I'm not speaking to you no more now hear me church and that's a type of the church it's to divide and conquer and Satan knows exactly what he's doing he's dividing in families he's dividing kids he's dividing schools he's dividing churches and bless God you you drive me crazy because you don't see it like me and there's no place in the scripture where you got to see exactly Paul and Peter never seen it exactly the same and some of the ones that strongly the one that Paul fought with and separated with they come back together at the end of their Ministry bitterly disagreed betterly disagreed that's right when Jesus said there will be one here among you that will betray me and and I'm going to close matter of fact you can come honey I want I want to leave this with you there wasn't one disciple there wasn't one person in the church that knew who it was Peter was one of the with a baked mouth like me he said is it me Lord that would sell God for 30 pieces of silver they didn't know they walked with the word but they didn't know you think you're walking with the word and you know just exactly everything bless God he revealed it to me I'm glad he' revealed it to you but if he revealed it to your brother just slightly different we can still walk together a little bit we can maybe just you know we can still have them you know I don't mean that you're going to be like you know you would hold the door at the grocery store for somebody that may be a gay or lesbian cuz you don't know them but you wouldn't maybe hold the door for amen God help me God help me let's still now open my [Music] eyes I want to seeus and TCH and say we love the our us [Music]
