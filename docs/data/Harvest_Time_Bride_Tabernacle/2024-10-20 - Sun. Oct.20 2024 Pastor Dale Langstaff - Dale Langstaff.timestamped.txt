[33:01] Ruth's song was so amazing that we just
[33:03] have to get out of the way brother
[33:04] Brown's greatest gift was just just just
[33:07] get out the way just get rid of all your
[33:09] thoughts and your this and that you know
[33:11] the Bible says don't even worry about
[33:13] what you would say and just a short
[33:15] testimony last week we went to a uh we
[33:19] left here and went to an anniversary
[33:22] thing
[33:23] and and I'd asked prayer that we could
[33:26] be a testimony and and and you
[33:29] know uh you can you can have your seats
[33:33] if you want to you know we we went we
[33:35] went to the mission field with those
[33:37] people before we had kids before we came
[33:41] into the message
[33:44] and there was multiple married couples
[33:47] that
[33:48] went and we were the only ones that were
[33:52] there or
[33:54] invited we haven't seen those people and
[33:57] probably 20 to 25
[34:00] years I want to show you what an
[34:02] omnipotent God you know you don't have
[34:04] to think too hard about serving God you
[34:07] just have to die like sister R song you
[34:09] just have to get out of the way you know
[34:11] we were somewhere this week and we were
[34:13] planning on stopping somewhere and we
[34:16] went by the place and I said oh man we
[34:19] you know Jesus said in the Bible I had
[34:21] an appointed appointment we didn't even
[34:23] realize it was an appointment we we I
[34:25] was going to turn around the driveway
[34:26] and Lan said oh just go up up to the
[34:28] next Road or something you know we went
[34:29] back and and those people wanted to know
[34:32] all
[34:33] about what Christ is what you are they
[34:37] took all our information and you know
[34:39] it's like brother Brown said he said we
[34:41] don't have no Creed but
[34:44] love no membership but
[34:48] fellowship and no book but the Bible we
[34:51] don't have nothing but Christ and if we
[34:52] have anything but Christ we're just an
[34:54] adulterous amen and and and she was
[34:57] there and it's like can you tell me
[35:01] more but you just take it for granted
[35:03] but we went byy their place we could
[35:05] have kept on going that wasn't really
[35:08] the purpose of our whole day but see God
[35:10] had an appointed time that said even
[35:13] when we missed it we' turn around amen
[35:17] and I want to tell you back to this
[35:20] anniversary those people have already
[35:23] come by our house this

[56:59] know just to clear up
[57:02] something
[57:04] Hallelujah many person believe that this
[57:06] woman in Revelation 12 represents the
[57:10] wife of
[57:11] Christ but according to the Book of
[57:14] Revelation here look at the
[57:18] description he said there was 12 star up
[57:21] on her head right Hallelujah 12 star
[57:25] where which represents the tribe of
[57:28] Israel right
[57:30] yeah the church has always been called a
[57:34] woman type of
[57:36] woman but this woman here does not
[57:39] represent the bride of Christ right it
[57:42] will represent Israel as a nation amen
[57:45] yes
[57:46] sir before before Christ came on the
[57:50] scene Israel was split into two Kingdom
[57:54] right y Hallelujah the kingdom of the
[57:57] North and the kingdom of the South
[58:00] Israel was the kingdom of the north and
[58:03] Judah was a kingdom of the South yes sir

[58:08] the Kingdom of the South Hallelujah and
[58:12] there were 10 tribes there in the
[58:14] Kingdom of of the north right there was
[58:17] a division but according to the Book of
[58:19] Jeremiah God said I'm going to bring
[58:22] them back
[58:23] together and according to the book of
[58:26] Ezekiel when the Bible said and the
[58:29] spirit of God was upon me and he carried
[58:33] me in the valley of the dry bones what
[58:36] did the prophet what did the man of God
[58:39] see he saw Israel was ruin God was
[58:43] showing him the ruin of the nation
[58:46] Israel and the resurrection of the
[58:49] nation is coming back together as
[58:53] one beautiful Hallelujah
[58:57] the bones that were scattered it was
[59:00] showing them that they were scattered
[59:03] right hallelujah thank you Lord many
[59:06] persons are looking at the war that is
[59:08] taking place in Israel right
[59:11] Hallelujah they're looking at the war
[59:14] Hal and they're bringing him back to the
[59:15] scripture and according to

[59:21] prophecy God said I will bring them back
[59:24] together as one
[59:26] amen One Nation not two yeah hallelujah
[59:31] amen so the human here represents the
[59:35] nation Israel right and right throughout
[59:39] the ages
[59:41] Hallelujah the devil is always
[59:44] Hallelujah attacking God's people right
[59:48] glory to God Amen right throughout the
[59:51] ages but here we see a key o I we see a
[59:57] key here in Revelation 12 in order to
[1:00:00] conquer the enemy hallelujah amen and
[1:00:04] the key is not the amount of books that
[1:00:08] you read no not amount of knowledge that
[1:00:11] you accumulate through reading the
[1:00:14] prophet messages
[1:00:16] right that is good but it's not good
[1:00:19] enough no
[1:00:20] no it's not the amount of knowledge that
[1:00:23] you know of this word right no
[1:00:27] Hallelujah the Pharisees they knew the
[1:00:30] word amen because they were caught in
[1:00:33] the word back to the word
[1:00:36] right and Jesus was the word that was
[1:00:40] manifest before their eyes but they
[1:00:42] could not recognize it amen what it
[1:00:45] require is revelation right because he
[1:00:49] said the letter kill it but the spirit
[1:00:52] giveth
[1:00:53] life
[1:00:54] Hallelujah and the the Bible said you
[1:00:58] overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:01:03] this blood is not the red
[1:01:05] substance that was in the body that was
[1:01:09] called Jesus right
[1:01:12] Hallelujah it was not this blood that he
[1:01:14] was speaking
[1:01:15] of in The Book of Leviticus 17: 11 he
[1:01:20] said the life is in the blood of the
[1:01:22] flesh there you
[1:01:24] go so the the blood of God is the spirit
[1:01:29] of
[1:01:30] God

[1:27:26] him Jesus Hallelujah action Hallelujah
[1:27:31] not just in action also but in life
[1:27:34] right yes the very life that you live
[1:27:38] right hallelujah thank you he must show
[1:27:40] people that that's Christ that's Jehovah
[1:27:44] God walking in two Fe
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:50] hallelujah many times we quote that same
[1:27:53] verse
[1:27:55] oh Jehovah God walking again in two
[1:27:58] feet but yet still our action is
[1:28:01] different
[1:28:03] yeah our action is totally different
[1:28:06] from what we actually saying right
[1:28:09] Hallelujah because the Bible said how
[1:28:13] can a man say that that they love God
[1:28:17] and hate their brother right how can
[1:28:20] they say that they love God and hate
[1:28:21] their brother right their action is
[1:28:24] speaking different right but the Bible
[1:28:27] said by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:28:30] word of Our
[1:28:33] Testimony
[1:28:34] yeah my testimony is not just in not
[1:28:38] just in words but it must come in the
[1:28:43] very life that we
[1:28:45] live the very action towards one
[1:28:48] another when we come together in
[1:28:50] Fellowship amen there's must only one
[1:28:53] thing that be Hallelujah that be
[1:28:56] detected among us and that's love love
[1:28:59] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus love
[1:29:02] covers a multitude of sin love
[1:29:07] conquers love
[1:29:09] heal Hallelujah love delivers thank you
[1:29:14] Lord thank you Jesus oh praise
[1:29:22] God let me say this know the holy spirit
[1:29:25] is leading me into this Hallelujah
[1:29:29] probably it would be helpful to somebody
[1:29:32] and probably will not be helpful to
[1:29:33] somebody but there's listeners that is
[1:29:36] listening to us right amen right
[1:29:39] sometimes people may need prayer say
[1:29:42] they need prayer but sometimes you know
[1:29:44] what they need just hug yeah yeah right

[1:29:52] ears God still loves you that's all they
[1:29:54] need sister
