[25:40] I choose to do I beg God to take it from

[26:10] differently or something you know what I
[26:12] mean and just don't go in you know if
[26:15] you don't understand somebody just say
[26:19] it's between them and God you know what
[26:21] I mean like it's
[26:22] you know we all had different you know
[26:25] households and we all had the same exact
[26:28] same word of God and the exact same
[26:30] message
[26:32] amen
[26:33] but you know different things you know I
[26:35] was uh
[26:37] I share this with you just sort of
[26:39] this is to this is to punch the devil in
[26:42] the nose
[26:43] you know we we had a beautiful weekend
[26:45] last weekend
[26:46] and when we get home
[26:49] me and my wife uh share everything
[26:53] amen we Have No Secrets
[26:56] amen and I got home after the weekend
[26:59] and you know well let me let me tell you
[27:01] a different way
[27:03] uh
[27:04] I told my wife something that happened
[27:08] and and uh but you know sometimes a
[27:12] reaction or something that happens can
[27:15] be read differently by the by different
[27:17] people
[27:18] you know let me let me and I'm not just
[27:20] uh I believe this is is God's grace to
[27:24] us Amen Let me let me give you just a
[27:26] little example you know I was I was
[27:29] bidding on a a Farm property very close
[27:32] to us
[27:33] and it was selling by auction
[27:36] and the auctioneer it went up to you
[27:39] know the price that it was worth
[27:41] and he said now we're going to take it
[27:43] is stopped and I was the highest bidder
[27:47] and he said no we're going to take a
[27:48] time out and you know you can talk with
[27:50] your wife or you know go talk to your
[27:52] dad or
[27:53] you know it was just take a breather and
[27:55] walk around
[27:57] and you can you know consider this huge
[28:00] decision
[28:01] like you know like youth would buy a
[28:03] house or something it's a big decision
[28:05] and then he said we're going to come
[28:06] back together and we're going to put it
[28:08] back up for auction
[28:10] and he was going to talk to the
[28:12] landowner and he was she's not bothering
[28:15] us the dog brother that's what I'm
[28:16] talking about if you have tiny tiny kids
[28:18] you don't have to run out with them I
[28:21] mean you know if you need to
[28:23] but if your kids
[28:25] you should travel to the other countries
[28:27] where the dog runs through in front of
[28:28] the pulpit and the chickens are over
[28:30] here and the neighbors walking cows by
[28:32] over there and they're screeching and
[28:34] the you know
[28:36] I mean if you were distracted by all
[28:38] that you don't well don't go overseas on
[28:41] an open amen because you just couldn't
[28:44] even focus
[28:45] you know
[28:46] Amanda so so they they uh you know of
[28:51] course the auctioneer you went and
[28:52] talked to the homeowner and said you
[28:53] know the property owner said are you
[28:54] happy with the price and he was he said
[28:56] I'm willing to sell it you know if you
[28:57] get more fine I'm only sells this and
[28:59] they put it back up for sale
[29:01] and it went another
[29:03] almost hundred thousand but 80 some
[29:06] thousand and I did not buy it and but
[29:09] I'm telling you the story for purpose
[29:12] and the guy that was bidding on it his
[29:15] son was a lawyer
[29:17] and he walked around all the people to
[29:20] try to figure out who was bidding
[29:21] against his dad
[29:23] now he's a lawyer
[29:28] now somebody else had to be doing
[29:30] something
[29:31] to make that go up a hundred thousand
[29:34] and that person was me
[29:37] but he didn't know how I was doing it he
[29:39] didn't know who I was
[29:42] because at the moment that the
[29:45] auctioneer connected with me I would
[29:47] wink at him
[29:50] one eye wink
[29:54] now see if that was somebody looking at
[29:57] that
[29:58] they could say well you're flirting with
[30:00] me or you know you're you're you're
[30:03] doing differently you know an eye link
[30:05] can mean flirting an eyewing can mean a
[30:08] stranger's coming in the house honey
[30:10] let's change the conversation and I wink
[30:12] can mean uh I'm gonna play a trick on
[30:15] The Kids Honey watch this you know what
[30:17] I mean
[30:19] and so I told sister Lil Wayne I said
[30:21] you know I'm at home and I was talking
[30:22] to one of the sisters at church and I
[30:24] get up and I winked at her
[30:27] and I thought oh boys
[30:33] Amen to see
[30:35] now I'm very very happily married
[30:39] very happily married
[30:42] and you see but you see Satan is still
[30:45] alive
[30:47] I don't even know why I did it
[30:49] thank you for talking to me it wasn't do
[30:52] you see what I mean
[30:56] but Satan could tell the sister hey you
[30:59] know that pastor's got a lustful Spirit
[31:01] on it oh bless God

[35:12] have religious concepts of prayer and we
[35:15] think we need to yeah you know be always
[35:18] uh talking when we pray but prayer and
[35:20] meditation would be close Brothers amen
[35:23] and and we see that you don't have to
[35:25] talk when you pray
[35:27] okay
[35:28] prayer is like a relationship with your
[35:31] your wife or a brother or sister or
[35:33] whatever it's a two-way conversation if
[35:36] one person does all the talking
[35:39] I I would almost I would almost I'd be
[35:42] gonna go out in the limb here a bit but
[35:44] in a lot of cases that French Shepherd
[35:46] relationship will end
[35:48] because every relationship is a back and
[35:51] forth now don't I don't matter if it's
[35:53] your brother and sister or your friend
[35:55] or if you have a friend and you do all
[35:58] the talking and all the calling and all
[36:00] the driving and that friendship will end
[36:05] I have many I could experience amen it's
[36:08] just it's just the way we are but so
[36:11] also is prayer
[36:13] amen and you know Jesus said in the
[36:16] Bible he said don't be like the
[36:17] Sadducees and Pharisees and you know I I
[36:19] studied this you know in different
[36:21] things you know I just say God help me
[36:25] I'm not worried about you just I mean I
[36:27] am but you know what I mean God help me
[36:29] I'm not throwing this on you but you
[36:31] know we have this religious concept and
[36:33] sometimes somebody you know brother Ben
[36:35] talked about you know the reverence and
[36:37] the Bishops and the doctors and in the
[36:39] ministry and and that's fine if they are
[36:41] you know I don't want no part of that
[36:43] amen and and but we just have to be
[36:46] careful you know our Prophet said in
[36:48] church order and Doctrine amen Fred's
[36:50] coming in brother Tim that's good amen
[36:53] God bless you this morning brother Fred
[36:54] amen you know Jesus in the word of God
[36:58] said himself he said don't be like the
[37:00] religious people decide to see some
[37:03] Pharisees he said you don't have to come
[37:05] and you know and even Dwight Moody said
[37:07] the the prophet he said you know the
[37:10] news people are trying to figure out why
[37:11] do they come and hear you I I know this
[37:14] morning that you're not coming to hear
[37:16] Brother Dale that failed grade one
[37:18] amen it has nothing to do with brother
[37:21] Dale and if you if if it did you're
[37:24] going to be deadly disappointed because
[37:26] I got zero education amen but it's
[37:29] Christ amen and here Jesus said he said
[37:32] don't be like the Sadducees and
[37:33] Pharisees where they they stand on the
[37:35] street corner and they want people to
[37:37] hear their fancy words
[37:40] amen now listen I'm going to bring it
[37:43] really closer the message has a
[37:45] vocabulary
[37:46] you can speak to Vanessa's message and
[37:49] it's not wrong and we love the message
[37:52] and it's the only truth
[37:55] Matt
[37:56] but you can speak mad mad message
[38:00] vocabulary that Christians won't even
[38:02] understand you and brother Ben mentioned
[38:04] that on the weekend and I talked to
[38:05] brother my my brother in the flesh was
[38:08] here on Friday night and brother
[38:09] Emmanuel preached a beautiful message
[38:11] but see you can be so much in the
[38:13] message people speak in Chinese
[38:18] you know the seals and the cloud and the
[38:20] the Mysteries and you know Guan and
[38:24] you mad
[38:27] like God uses servants and God used
[38:30] brother Brown was the major prophet to
[38:33] this age and his message is the truth
[38:36] and you have to believe his message
[38:38] it's not actually his message it's this
[38:41] reveal
[38:43] so like it's just this revealed so you
[38:46] have to believe this revealed maybe
[38:48] that's clear I have to believe this
[38:49] revealed but but if you go witness
[38:52] brother Bradley people are going to like
[38:54] huh
[38:57] you say well no they should know him
[38:58] listen my wife was born in Burn Indiana
[39:02] she went to Jay County High School in
[39:04] Indiana
[39:06] see I met her at a Holiness whooping
[39:09] yard Campground
[39:11] 1500 people there whatever
[39:13] they used to open up the walls of the
[39:15] church and block your two by four or
[39:17] post under it because it would get so
[39:19] hot it was huge
[39:22] amen
[39:24] and my wife will look you straight in
[39:26] the eye with a straight face she went to
[39:28] to she went to a a bible school and you
[39:32] uh by Indianapolis and then went to
[39:35] nursing school in Fort Wayne and after
[39:37] we were married we never one time had
[39:39] she ever heard the prophet
[39:41] the message of a church the name
[39:45] anything it was Chinese
[39:50] she was she was going right around where
[39:52] he lived and that's the gospel truth
[39:56] God brought her out of Indiana and
[39:58] brought her to Canada and then showed us
[40:00] the truth
[40:02] so see
[40:04] you see where I'm going with that so we
[40:06] have to be you know the prophet preached
[40:08] about like the kids should be able to
[40:10] understand
[40:11] we're not supposed to be baked you know
[40:13] I mean there's time for that there's a
[40:16] season for everything but you see what I
[40:17] mean so so here's Jesus saying don't
[40:20] pray like decide to see some Pharisees
[40:22] where they pray and it's all a big long
[40:25] you know these big words that you have
[40:27] to go to the day what's that mean honey
[40:29] my wife my dick so what's that word mean
[40:31] honey oh that oh thanks
[40:34] meh our Prophet said in church order
[40:37] Doctrine watch this you saw and by the
[40:40] way when I was handing out flowers I'm
[40:42] glad we have song leaders that sing
[40:43] songs we don't know
[40:45] amen thank you Jesus amen I don't want
[40:49] to hear the same song every day even my
[40:51] favorite song
[40:52] amen see we're not looking for
[40:54] Perfection and I mean I like good
[40:57] singing I don't mean that but I meant I
[40:59] like the Holy Ghost best
[41:01] I just like the Holy Ghost best
[41:03] and see he's a full variety and so here
[41:06] you see these things uh uh where where
[41:09] we we got this idea in our head hear the
[41:12] prophet said a church order and doctor
[41:14] he said the song leader you know he'll
[41:15] come up sing a song of songs and he
[41:17] asked somebody to come up and pray
[41:20] oh buddy I've been in some meetings
[41:23] where they need to read what the prophet
[41:24] says in church order and doctors
[41:27] do you know the prophet said a church
[41:28] ordered a Doctrine to preach 30 to 45
[41:31] minutes no more
[41:36] he said bring out your point drive it
[41:39] home clench it
[41:40] shut her down
[41:43] now I did he do that of course not but
[41:46] he was laying down a foundation for the
[41:49] ages
[41:50] he was laying down a foundation for
[41:52] brother Dale that he's been gone 70
[41:54] years and brother Dale's still dating
[41:57] he's still digging I'm digging up that
[41:59] foundation not because I want to hurt it
[42:00] no I want to I want to understand it
[42:03] wow
[42:05] now there's nothing wrong with good
[42:07] preaching I could have listened to the
[42:08] minutes the G3 and I can listen to him
[42:10] for days Brother Band he's just saying I
[42:13] could listen like I mean they're just
[42:15] Spellbound
[42:17] but see it's about God Amen and see here
[42:21] here the prophet says the church order
[42:23] not he said don't invite somebody up and
[42:25] pray for the governor now the Bible
[42:27] itself says pray for our leaders
[42:29] but what the prophet is saying is do
[42:31] that in secret
[42:33] he said don't hear and pray for a half
[42:36] an hour
[42:39] oh I love our prophet
[42:41] man he I can understand that kind of
[42:44] language
[42:45] amen
[42:47] and yet the Bible says to pray without
[42:49] ceasing but in private
[42:52] see it's a perfect understanding amen
[42:56] you can't pray too much our Prophet said
[42:58] you can't pray too much but don't get
[43:00] into the show
[43:02] amen it's fine to be nice and correct
[43:05] and proper and decent and that but but
[43:08] don't be see show is fake
[43:11] see it's it's a see show is a it's a
[43:14] it's a screen set and behind it it's
[43:17] Hollow
[43:19] amen we want some substance some real we
[43:22] want a body we want something with amen
[43:25] we don't want just a covering
[43:30] religion
[43:32] amen God help us so but wow when brother
[43:36] Emmanuel tombi said Friday that Jesus
[43:39] come back to disciples and he said you
[43:41] couldn't even tarry with me an hour
[43:43] oh wow
[43:46] wow
[43:48] I don't want to tell you what brother
[43:49] Dale thought
[43:52] brother Dale thought wow
[43:55] when's the last time I did anything for
[43:57] one hour
[44:01] you know I failed grade one because my
[44:03] attention span was about that short
[44:09] I was a I was a seeing moving person
[44:14] you know what I mean I wanted like I
[44:16] wanted like fireworks you know this
[44:20] sitting still stuff
[44:25] and it hit me right there right there or
[44:28] something
[44:30] and I was like wow
[44:33] I want to show you something and it it
[44:35] you know so I'm going to show you
[44:38] something in the Bible that was saved
[44:40] but but he liked it elected and a
[44:43] prophet
[44:44] it was just he was elected
[44:47] a prophet and he had the blessing of a
[44:51] prophet
[44:52] but he was unconverted
[44:56] oh
[44:58] like
[45:02] Jacob
[45:09] I'm going to show you in the Bible
[45:12] he was prophets are prophets are born
[45:16] his dad give him the blessing
[45:18] his name was Sister planter
[45:21] he was predestinated
[45:25] but he wasn't converted
[45:28] oh
[45:30] amen now let's just set this aside for a
[45:32] second you know the scriptures just
[45:35] forgive me for uh being man there's a
[45:38] lot of stuff in prayer here let's go to
[45:41] Luke Luke 6 12 and uh actually maybe
[45:45] I'll pull up my iPad because I got some
[45:46] of these buried in here but uh I just
[45:49] want to lay a foundation then we're
[45:51] going to we're going to close looking at
[45:52] uh Jacob but uh
[45:56] um
[45:59] forgive me if I'm bumpy this morning I'm
[46:01] trying to uh work off my iPad and not
[46:04] print off a book every morning
[46:07] amen Luke 6 12. and he came to pass in
[46:10] those days that he went into the
[46:12] mountain to pray
[46:14] it's just it's talking about Jesus
[46:17] and he continued there
[46:25] all night
[46:33] wow
[46:34] you say oh well bless God you know he
[46:36] was the son of God and you know what do
[46:38] you expect no no no no no no no
[46:41] he yes he was the son of God but he was
[46:44] still in flesh and so the Bible brings
[46:46] us around to us you know the prophet
[46:49] said oh I couldn't even tell you I think
[46:51] about 30 30 times you know he talks
[46:54] about the all-night prayer meetings that
[46:56] don't mean you're doing the talking
[46:59] see back to this relationship you know
[47:01] God wants to do something
[47:03] like the disciples said to Jesus teach
[47:06] us how to pray and I you know and so
[47:09] we've started something different on
[47:10] Wednesday night you know I went in my
[47:12] Concords of a Bible actually it's not
[47:14] even my Bible and there's about oh
[47:16] there's a lot there's probably 300
[47:18] scriptures that give prayers in the
[47:20] Bible
[47:21] so when you come on Wednesday night
[47:22] we're reading and looking at a prayer
[47:25] and then we close the service in prayer
[47:28] but uh you know but you you look at this
[47:30] and you see here that uh prayer
[47:35] was a major
[47:37] Savior and event relationship amen oh
[47:41] sorry back to I lost my so here you see
[47:44] in the Lord's Prayer it ain't just Jesus
[47:46] us like
[47:48] Jesus pay my Hydra bill I want to buy a
[47:51] new tractor I've seen the new car you
[47:54] know
[47:54] my house is falling down
[47:57] and I don't like my job
[47:59] and I don't like my pastor here
[48:05] but look at look at the look at the
[48:07] Lord's prayer Our Father
[48:10] Who Art in Heaven
[48:12] hell would be thy name worship
[48:15] worship prayer worship yup yup Hallowed
[48:18] be thy name
[48:20] you're the boss thy kingdom come
[48:23] and thy will be done I've been asked for
[48:26] nothing yet
[48:28] Jesus
[48:30] what about my
[48:33] thy will be on earth oh that's even in
[48:36] my family in my life
[48:38] as it's already done in heaven
[48:40] now this is the first thing give us this
[48:43] day our daily bread
[48:46] that's the first give me
[48:48] in the Lord's Prayer
[48:50] but it's almost over
[48:52] now I thought there was a lot more gives
[48:53] me
[48:55] I like to give to me
[48:59] Our Daily Bread
[49:01] and forgive us our trespasses
[49:04] as we forgive those
[49:06] who trespass against us
[49:09] and lead us not into temptation but
[49:10] Deliver Us from Evil
[49:13] for thine is the kingdom back to worship
[49:16] and thine is the power
[49:19] and thine is the glory
[49:23] forever and ever
[49:24] amen
[49:26] there wasn't very many Gift means of
[49:28] that prayer
[49:30] see that was God that was God teaching
[49:33] us how to pray
[49:34] and there's times when you will pray
[49:37] or you're actually husbands there's
[49:40] times that husbands need to
[49:42] let their wife talk
[49:47] amen
[49:48] she has half your brains
[49:51] she has all your looks
[49:54] and she has at least half your wisdom
[49:57] whether you're a male chauvinist or not
[50:02] amen
[50:07] but but God needs to talk to us
[50:11] but he can't talk to brother Dale unless
[50:13] I'll go in my closet
[50:14] and let him talk you know the Bible says
[50:16] to pray in secret
[50:19] and what you do in secret God will
[50:21] reward you openly
[50:23] because prayer has a way
[50:27] of taking brother Dale out of brother
[50:29] Dale
[50:32] it has a way of humbling ourselves and
[50:35] coming so God can talk to us and God's
[50:39] the Capstone head amen he's the king of
[50:42] the house
[50:43] amen
[50:46] wow
[50:47] you know so our Prophet you know in the
[50:50] one scripture
[50:52] uh
[50:55] it talked about
[50:57] just not me sorry
[51:06] and then one job is it's like oh here we
[51:09] go
[51:10] you talked about uh pray without ceasing
[51:13] and oh you talked about you'll see this
[51:15] scripture sorry I'm sorry there's
[51:18] unbelievable how many scriptures there
[51:19] is
[51:21] you know you know let's look at
[51:22] Ephesians 5 20 and 21. and here brother
[51:25] Ben mentioned this and I want to I want
[51:28] to move our prayer into another part you
[51:30] know our our prayer fellowship with God
[51:33] will be in secret
[51:35] but there's something else we need to
[51:37] pick up here and and and and we we got
[51:40] to use a bunch of the Bible to pick it
[51:42] up and that Ephesians 5 20 and and 21.
[51:47] it talks about here and brother Ben
[51:49] mentioned this and I uh 20
[51:55] okay and I want 21 sorry
[52:00] cementing yourselves
[52:02] oh
[52:04] one to the other
[52:06] now that's going to be hard to get
[52:07] reverence and Bishops out of that one
[52:10] now we all had different callings and
[52:12] and positions you know I'm not taking
[52:15] away from that
[52:16] but that's surrender
[52:19] is to happen in prayer
[52:24] amen
[52:25] you know if
[52:27] just be you know
[52:29] God planned on us being able to
[52:31] communicate with one another
[52:34] and not everything being judged
[52:38] remember what we talked about before
[52:40] brother might pray
[52:41] just you know what I'm saying now
[52:44] you see what I'm saying I'm trying to
[52:46] get you somewhere here see the scripture
[52:49] talks about
[52:51] uh oh man I'm still having trouble
[52:56] forgive me
[53:02] my main scripture
[53:14] well it's like this we're not going home
[53:15] until we find it
[53:24] oh my
[53:27] I'm sorry
[53:28] it's my first day
[53:31] amen
[53:33] there's there's a scripture in the Bible
[53:35] it's only laid my finger on
[53:37] that that the Americans use a lot where
[53:40] I talked about if the people will humble
[53:42] themselves
[53:45] they come to God
[53:47] and pray
[53:49] he'll heal their land
[53:52] well
[53:53] the prophet you know it don't say it in
[53:56] the Bible
[53:59] amen honey if you find that for me so
[54:01] much the prophet don't they don't say in
[54:04] the Bible assemble together
[54:06] and yet the prophet said every time he
[54:09] quoted that scripture every single time
[54:12] 21 times to be exact
[54:14] he said
[54:16] that you shall assemble together
[54:18] to pray and he said at once they will
[54:21] assemble to pray every time the prophet
[54:24] was preaching and he mentions that
[54:26] scripture
[54:27] he says you would Assemble
[54:29] to pray
[54:30] amen and the Bible talks about and
[54:33] there's we're going to look into other
[54:35] scriptures where it talks about when the
[54:37] people were came together
[54:40] how
[54:42] the the fear of God fell on the people
[54:44] around them because they were together
[54:48] the fear and power of God was together
[54:51] amen it was that the praying together
[54:53] and he says and I don't want to show you
[54:56] something when the when the politicians
[54:58] use that scripture and it's a nice
[54:59] scripture and it fits but it's not
[55:01] talking about the land
[55:06] the prophet said that
[55:09] it's talking about this land
[55:12] and the prophet said he said you are the
[55:14] salt of the earth
[55:15] and if you don't pray
[55:17] or you don't come together and assemble
[55:19] the self together
[55:21] he said the salt and I got this quote
[55:23] here and I'm going to read it somewhere
[55:24] but he said the salt is going to lose
[55:26] its savor
[55:28] amen
[55:31] he said
[55:33] that's my Jacob folks
[55:36] amen let's just read a couple quotes
[55:37] here he said when
[55:40] when he thought how he would had been
[55:42] deceived by his brother this is a Jacob
[55:44] quote too also and he called them to an
[55:46] all-night prayer meeting God knows what
[55:49] the church needs
[55:52] there's some more preaching
[55:55] which which preaching is good because
[55:57] like we have the truth
[55:59] so that is good
[56:01] here hear and hear him he said the
[56:03] reason that this one you caught me early
[56:06] amen the reason that we don't see
[56:08] miracles
[56:12] all night prayer meanings and things
[56:14] that we used to have is because
[56:16] something has happened and the Holy
[56:18] Spirit
[56:19] cannot
[56:21] be blessed
[56:23] wow Ken
[56:26] amen God help us
[56:28] and so I I searched that scripture amen
[56:34] Matthew 5 13 I just found it
[56:37] let me re let me read you what he says
[56:39] here he said here's just one of his
[56:41] quotes this is a uh
[56:44] uh let me read the scripture you're the
[56:46] salt of the earth but if the salt no no
[56:48] oh no that's the wrong one we don't want
[56:50] that one sorry
[56:52] the salt has lost its savor
[56:55] where with so it'd be salty it is hence
[56:58] good for nothing and cast out to be
[57:02] trotted underfoot and our Prophet
[57:03] dovetailed that
[57:05] with prayer
[57:07] together
[57:10] and you see Jesus came back to his
[57:13] disciples together
[57:16] he said an hour
[57:19] you couldn't pray you couldn't pray an
[57:21] hour
[57:22] just one hour you couldn't pray with me
[57:24] amen
[57:26] God help us amen
[57:28] God help us to see he said see we
[57:31] haven't humbled ourself to come under
[57:34] God's anointing through prayer
[57:38] and maybe that's why the land
[57:41] ain't always healed
[57:45] because if the people will humble
[57:46] themselves see see you can pray in your
[57:50] closet
[57:51] and that's a certain kind of humbling
[57:52] but when you come together and submit
[57:54] yourself to one another
[57:57] that's another kind of humbling
[58:00] amen
[58:02] amen
[58:05] you know what I'm saying anybody that
[58:07] stands behind this desk it don't matter
[58:08] if you lead songs or sing a special or
[58:10] pray or something and something just
[58:12] don't flow like you can't find your
[58:13] verse like me this morning because I'm
[58:15] trying to use my iPad not print paper
[58:19] amen and the devil will just step in
[58:21] there and put up the butterflies
[58:24] you see
[58:26] but it's but it's here's God you see
[58:29] that's the humbling
[58:31] and when you come down God comes up
[58:34] amen
[58:36] and so when you bow down in prayer amen
[58:38] it's powerful
[58:39] amen
[58:42] powerful what God plans
[58:51] uh Second Chronicles 7 14.
[58:54] yeah let's pull that up
[58:58] I don't know why I didn't print it off
[58:59] no but sorry
[59:04] Satan you're going to lose
[59:07] I hit it on the top of my quote sheets
[59:11] amen
[59:12] and behold them he said now you can say
[59:14] I can show you
[59:16] here he says I can show me somebody that
[59:19] belongs to church he says oh here sorry
[59:22] let me start again he said now can you
[59:24] show me somebody that belongs to church
[59:26] he said thousands he said can you show
[59:29] me somebody that shouts
[59:31] thousands and believe me and I I'd be
[59:34] one of them I like that can you show me
[59:36] somebody that speaks with tongues
[59:37] thousands somebody that works miracles
[59:40] thousands but show me somebody that has
[59:43] size in Christ
[59:45] for the Abominations
[59:48] done in the church
[59:51] the Bible says in land the prophet says
[59:54] in the church
[59:55] you can't see a lot that are praying
[59:58] you can see a lot that are doing other
[59:59] things
[1:00:01] you can't see a lot that are praying
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] he says I'm just reading the Highlight
[1:00:07] tonight listen
[1:00:11] he oh he says we've lowered the bars and
[1:00:13] let sin come in and tonight we've
[1:00:16] listened to the knock come out our door
[1:00:18] and we return oh unto me my people and
[1:00:22] call on my name and assemble myself
[1:00:24] together
[1:00:26] and pray and you'll hear from heaven now
[1:00:29] the scripture don't actually let's read
[1:00:31] this if my people that are called by my
[1:00:33] name shall humble themselves
[1:00:36] and pray and seek my face and return
[1:00:39] from thy Wicked Ways then I will hear
[1:00:41] from him then I will hear from heaven
[1:00:44] and will forgive their sins
[1:00:46] and heal their hands
[1:00:49] now my question to you is why did the
[1:00:51] prophet every single time he say that
[1:00:53] say assemble themselves
[1:00:57] well you I I will break that down I
[1:01:00] believe for you
[1:01:02] amen of course he had uh visions and
[1:01:05] insight but this is wrote in a plural
[1:01:08] standings
[1:01:10] this ain't wrote like if one person
[1:01:14] that's called by my name no if my people
[1:01:18] if my church let's see if my church
[1:01:21] that's called by my name if the bride
[1:01:23] that's called by my name
[1:01:25] will assemble myself will humble
[1:01:28] themself and humble in themselves see
[1:01:30] it's all plural and our Prophet took
[1:01:33] that rate out and put a symbol
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:40] and turn from their wacky ways they'll
[1:01:42] hear from heaven
[1:01:43] and will forgive their sins and I'll
[1:01:46] heal
[1:01:47] their land
[1:01:50] this land
[1:01:52] even this land
[1:01:54] amen amen Even in our day even this land
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:04] thank you Jesus in the expression he
[1:02:06] said the Pentecostal church has been
[1:02:08] expecting a visit from the promised land
[1:02:10] and the restoration of the gifts and so
[1:02:12] forth but as soon as it began to speak
[1:02:14] in tongues and interpret it begin to
[1:02:16] organize and different organizations
[1:02:19] separated each other I mean that was one
[1:02:21] thing with this weekend it was beautiful
[1:02:23] to see people from Windsor to Toronto
[1:02:26] amen it was just beautiful
[1:02:28] organized and separating themselves on
[1:02:31] things like that
[1:02:32] he's talking about tongues and
[1:02:34] interpretation
[1:02:36] and you battled around for 40 years
[1:02:38] though it's it's now 100 years battled
[1:02:40] around for 100 years and you keep
[1:02:41] modeling as long as you do that but when
[1:02:44] you get yourself together like they did
[1:02:47] in the day of Pentecost and come
[1:02:48] together and expect God to do something
[1:02:51] if the people that are called by my name
[1:02:53] will assemble themselves
[1:02:58] and get together and pray then I'll hear
[1:03:01] from heaven now if we would do that we
[1:03:04] can expect something
[1:03:06] until you do that we might as well not
[1:03:11] expect it
[1:03:14] wow this is expectation
[1:03:17] 610207 paragraph 29.
[1:03:20] until you come together and pray
[1:03:23] you might as well not expect God to move
[1:03:26] expectation
[1:03:28] 610207 paragraph 29.
[1:03:31] he says you might as well not expect it
[1:03:33] because it's not coming
[1:03:37] we've got two full we've got to fully
[1:03:41] obey God's word
[1:03:44] wow now I would not now I'm studying
[1:03:47] okay so I'm looking at this from a study
[1:03:49] path so I'm digging through the Bible to
[1:03:52] see where it says assemble and pray
[1:03:54] it's not there
[1:03:57] but this our Prophet seeing this
[1:03:59] scripture
[1:04:00] as a symbol and pray because it's wrote
[1:04:03] my people
[1:04:05] my bride my church and themselves humble
[1:04:10] themselves amen so hear God and through
[1:04:13] our prophet he don't want you just to
[1:04:15] humble yourself to God only
[1:04:20] but each other
[1:04:22] what brother Ben say Sunday when he said
[1:04:25] if people had something he said now
[1:04:27] that's Christianity
[1:04:29] now that's when you can go and say Hey
[1:04:31] you know I
[1:04:35] that's Christianity amen
[1:04:38] even brother Nelson mentioned something
[1:04:40] that that don't make you that's just
[1:04:44] that's a real thing that takes it off
[1:04:46] the stage
[1:04:48] a stage is just a set where only you can
[1:04:51] see the front but when you turn around
[1:04:53] this there's no back in it
[1:04:55] we got some pictures taken like that in
[1:04:57] in the mall in Edmonton it was all
[1:04:59] Western pictures and they just tied them
[1:05:01] around our neck and it was just the
[1:05:03] front half
[1:05:05] that's what
[1:05:08] that's what the church has become so
[1:05:09] much
[1:05:10] it's just a stage we come Sunday morning
[1:05:12] when we put on our best plate
[1:05:17] we write down the scriptures on paper so
[1:05:19] we don't get lost as a minister
[1:05:22] because we don't want to be real to the
[1:05:24] people
[1:05:26] I'm only human
[1:05:28] guess what you are too
[1:05:30] man and God loves that but he wants us
[1:05:33] to see us take her
[1:05:35] pillows off
[1:05:38] the real one to another
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:43] fully obey until we fully obey
[1:05:49] I'm just dropping to where I highlighted
[1:05:50] and all them other isms that you got on
[1:05:53] you'll forget your differences when you
[1:05:56] come together
[1:05:57] and pray
[1:05:59] amen see it's just a way of humbling
[1:06:02] yourself and when I expect some and then
[1:06:04] I'll expect something to happen from
[1:06:07] Heaven you won't be worrying about
[1:06:12] what sister potty brought for lunch
[1:06:13] today
[1:06:15] you know you know what I just try and
[1:06:17] think of something if you know what I
[1:06:18] mean
[1:06:19] like what I did yesterday you know what
[1:06:21] I'm saying
[1:06:24] like
[1:06:25] hey
[1:06:27] as believers
[1:06:29] we should just be we're supposed to be
[1:06:31] friends
[1:06:33] if you know eternity don't have a number
[1:06:36] that's a long time
[1:06:38] and after a long time it's still there
[1:06:43] and our Prophet clearly said I heard it
[1:06:45] last night when I had my iPad going all
[1:06:48] night
[1:06:49] and woke up in the middle of the night
[1:06:50] he said it's a real place
[1:06:53] we're real people there
[1:06:55] if you don't like me here
[1:06:57] you're going to have trouble there
[1:06:59] That's why nothing but perfect love will
[1:07:02] be there in my head it may stop it's you
[1:07:07] know what I'm saying
[1:07:11] we might as well start being real here
[1:07:13] you know amen
[1:07:16] I'm not saying be be careless and
[1:07:18] intentionally sloppy but
[1:07:22] if we make a mistake we're humans
[1:07:26] you know if you did some of the things
[1:07:28] our Prophet did you know he was
[1:07:30] comfortable you know the prophet the one
[1:07:32] time he jumped up on the platform and
[1:07:34] daggled his legs over and was preaching
[1:07:36] a message
[1:07:36] I wouldn't try to do that today I'd
[1:07:38] probably kill myself
[1:07:40] but you see what I mean he was
[1:07:41] comfortable with the people he was
[1:07:43] comfortable with himself he was
[1:07:45] comfortable with the word of God because
[1:07:47] he was in fellowship with God
[1:07:50] in my head he wasn't proving nothing it
[1:07:54] was God can prove everything
[1:07:57] in my head I don't I don't study the
[1:08:00] week before and think wow I'm going to
[1:08:02] prove to the people I'm of God
[1:08:05] are you kidding
[1:08:07] that church is down the road
[1:08:10] amen or do you know what I'm saying
[1:08:12] denomination Like Son you can't
[1:08:15] manufacture God
[1:08:17] that's Grace
[1:08:21] amen what you do in secret God will
[1:08:24] reward you openly
[1:08:25] but even in the prayer
[1:08:28] amen there's where you'll pray for your
[1:08:30] Governors and all your whatever
[1:08:34] but God even expects us to be together
[1:08:38] amen and pray I'm going to find this
[1:08:40] here's another one he said my people
[1:08:41] will assemble themselves if my people
[1:08:44] that are called by my name shall
[1:08:45] assemble themselves together and pray
[1:08:47] then I'll hear from heaven and heal
[1:08:48] their land it's their body and there and
[1:08:51] here he says that he says he says they
[1:08:54] are the salt of the earth
[1:08:57] you know you you can read that scripture
[1:08:59] No it's not talking about the Earth all
[1:09:00] those politicians think they're going to
[1:09:01] heal the states this Earth is the
[1:09:04] devil's domain until the Millennium it
[1:09:07] ain't going to be healed
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:10] until we go in the millennium
[1:09:13] but we are the salt of the earth and if
[1:09:16] the salts left the Savior then
[1:09:18] warehances are good for nothing is cast
[1:09:20] aside
[1:09:21] at the feet of men
[1:09:23] you recognize that salt is Savor and it
[1:09:26] connects it connects prayer connects
[1:09:31] we must be connected
[1:09:34] to God
[1:09:37] when's the last time we talked to God
[1:09:39] when's the last time brother Dale talked
[1:09:41] to God for an hour
[1:09:43] amen I love in the wintertime I'll come
[1:09:45] here on an off day and spend an
[1:09:47] afternoon in the church and just amen
[1:09:49] I'll pray kneeling down I'll walk around
[1:09:51] praying I'll sit in different people's
[1:09:53] Pew and pray for them and I'll walk
[1:09:55] around the whole place and pray and I'll
[1:09:57] be mopping praying and and the man she's
[1:10:01] just God wants to see you know what God
[1:10:03] wants to see
[1:10:04] yeah well let me let me rephrase it like
[1:10:06] this when I was
[1:10:10] well let me say like this when I was in
[1:10:11] a courtship
[1:10:14] I was I almost said when I was in love
[1:10:18] I was never in a hurry
[1:10:23] you know when it was time to leave I was
[1:10:25] planning on leaving at six and seven
[1:10:26] came and went eight came and went nine
[1:10:28] came and went
[1:10:31] and then I left
[1:10:34] my brother Dale don't pray like that
[1:10:45] but when brother Dale does
[1:10:49] you see
[1:10:52] when we pray like that
[1:10:54] where you get lost in prayer
[1:10:57] you just
[1:10:59] like whoa
[1:11:01] That was supposed to be somewhere
[1:11:09] that help us
[1:11:11] man that helped me
[1:11:13] now let's look at our example
[1:11:17] in the Old Testament
[1:11:19] and Genesis
[1:11:21] oh where'd you go
[1:11:26] you know oh
[1:11:32] you're saying uh
[1:11:34] my iPad played a trick on me
[1:11:38] you know here in Genesis 32 you can pull
[1:11:41] this up Amy and go through it as we go
[1:11:43] and I'm going to read some quotes from
[1:11:46] you here and you know we're so blessed
[1:11:48] with the truth and the message and it
[1:11:51] took the scales off her eyes and and so
[1:11:54] the Bible is even Jesus here is thanking
[1:11:56] the father he said I'm glad you hit it
[1:11:58] from the wise and prudent
[1:11:59] and you revealed it on to babes
[1:12:02] that would just learned amen and so
[1:12:04] there's things wrote in this chapter
[1:12:05] that our Prophet grabs up
[1:12:07] amen and you can tell and and you can
[1:12:10] see how
[1:12:11] the stroke but here Jacob had been
[1:12:14] blessed from his dad by he was a he was
[1:12:17] a Deceiver
[1:12:19] and had tricked his dad from his mom and
[1:12:22] he had taken the family blessing and
[1:12:24] then he had laughed and now he's married
[1:12:26] and God's actually blessed him and he's
[1:12:28] very wealthy he has much possessions but
[1:12:31] now he's coming back to meet the very
[1:12:34] brother that he sabotaged
[1:12:37] tricked amen
[1:12:39] and he scared
[1:12:42] to death
[1:12:45] and at this point he didn't have a
[1:12:47] backbone yet it's instated later in his
[1:12:51] life
[1:12:52] and so he sends out he takes his
[1:12:55] possessions and let's just go to uh a
[1:12:57] nine or six Amy
[1:13:00] well actually actually sorry forgive me
[1:13:03] let's go back to three
[1:13:05] and Jacob sent Messengers uh before him
[1:13:08] to Esau his brother and the land of
[1:13:11] Surrey the country of Edom and here here
[1:13:14] he had no backbone
[1:13:17] he said he said I'll give everything I
[1:13:20] own including all my kids and wife as
[1:13:22] long as I keep my neck
[1:13:25] boys I'd really want him as the guard of
[1:13:27] the home
[1:13:29] wow
[1:13:31] amen now let's just drop to six and The
[1:13:34] Messengers kept returning to Jacob and
[1:13:38] they said Esau your brother has come to
[1:13:40] met us and he has 400 men Army
[1:13:44] with them
[1:13:45] Jacob had close to zero
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:51] he was petrified the Bible says later in
[1:13:53] this scripture he was petrified and well
[1:13:56] here he says and the Sabbath and Jacob
[1:13:58] was greatly afraid in distress and he
[1:14:00] divided his people with them at his
[1:14:01] flocks and his herds and Campbells into
[1:14:03] two bands he said I'll sacrifice to you
[1:14:05] all
[1:14:06] songs I can live
[1:14:08] oh bye day
[1:14:15] amen
[1:14:17] let's just drop to nine and Jacob said
[1:14:20] here Jacob you know I was just you can
[1:14:24] stay there for a minute
[1:14:26] we're a lot like Jacob
[1:14:31] when we pray an hour
[1:14:34] it's when we're afraid
[1:14:38] when we pray an hour we got an army
[1:14:40] after us
[1:14:44] might not be our brother might be the
[1:14:46] government might be the tax collector
[1:14:48] might be the rent collector might be the
[1:14:50] mortgage the banks
[1:14:52] might be our car it might be our wife
[1:14:56] huh oh god oh I'm in a mess
[1:15:01] fix me
[1:15:04] God's like
[1:15:06] who are you I haven't got you in my
[1:15:08] contacts
[1:15:14] you know when you get a text message and
[1:15:16] the people in your contacts are named
[1:15:17] don't come up so we're like oh God I'm
[1:15:20] in a pickle I'm gonna pickle I'm gonna
[1:15:23] be kicked out this though that's
[1:15:27] guy's from the other side of the world I
[1:15:28] don't know who he is
[1:15:32] well because you'd never talk to him
[1:15:36] people you don't talk to you don't put
[1:15:37] in your contact
[1:15:39] but God's the same way
[1:15:42] Oh you mean you're a small G God so
[1:15:44] would God be any different if you never
[1:15:46] talk to him do you think God puts the
[1:15:47] ones that are of the devil your father
[1:15:50] Satan they're not in his contact
[1:15:58] oh
[1:16:04] Jacob was a scattered
[1:16:08] and the prophet said how he wrestled all
[1:16:10] night
[1:16:12] and God sent
[1:16:14] the Bible says a man he wrestled with
[1:16:16] the man
[1:16:18] but that was God
[1:16:22] it's a god came and he wrestled with God
[1:16:24] and he was bargaining with God if you'll
[1:16:27] pay my bill God I'll go to church next
[1:16:28] Sunday God I'll even put money in the
[1:16:31] offering if you pay my bill twice
[1:16:34] oh yeah that's how it works
[1:16:37] and he was trying to put God in a
[1:16:39] headlock
[1:16:41] you don't think so read this chapter
[1:16:44] he wrestled and wrestled Jacob had to
[1:16:47] get Jacob out of Jacob
[1:16:50] brother Dale has to get brother Dale
[1:16:52] with a brother Dale
[1:16:53] and
[1:16:55] anybody that has a relationship with
[1:16:57] God's going to get themselves
[1:16:58] out of themselves
[1:17:01] amen and Jacob said oh god father of
[1:17:04] Abraham my God the my father of Isaac
[1:17:06] the Lord which which said unto me
[1:17:09] returned unto thy country in the Kindred
[1:17:11] and I will deal
[1:17:16] well with thee so he's telling he now
[1:17:19] he's preaching to God God you promised
[1:17:21] bless God God's like I don't even have
[1:17:24] you in my contacts who are you
[1:17:32] he says I am not worthy of the least of
[1:17:34] all these mercies and Truth which thou
[1:17:36] has showed unto thy servant
[1:17:39] because God bless them for with my staff
[1:17:42] I have passed over Jordan and now I am
[1:17:45] come
[1:17:46] the two bands deliver me I pray thee in
[1:17:49] the hands from the hand of my brother
[1:17:51] and from the hands of Esau for I fear
[1:17:53] Him
[1:17:56] I wonder how much Jacob prayed all night
[1:17:58] before he feared somebody
[1:18:03] Spirits don't die
[1:18:06] it's a perfect shadow of where we're
[1:18:07] living right today
[1:18:09] perfect shadow
[1:18:11] so I fear Him let's see will come and
[1:18:13] smite me and the mother
[1:18:16] with their children
[1:18:18] Jacob
[1:18:20] was afraid
[1:18:22] when brother Dale gets afraid
[1:18:27] and when you get afraid
[1:18:33] that's not the only time God wants to
[1:18:35] hear from us
[1:18:44] that'd be like your wife only coming to
[1:18:45] you when you were afraid
[1:18:47] or she only comes to you when she's sick
[1:18:53] you know
[1:18:56] and thou setest I will surely do good oh
[1:18:59] I loved it man he we we're bold
[1:19:05] God now listen to me
[1:19:08] you said you would surely do good to me
[1:19:12] and make thy seed the sand
[1:19:18] and God's like
[1:19:20] we better keep wrestling
[1:19:33] man
[1:19:39] the drop down to 24.
[1:19:41] and Jacob had sent everything ahead
[1:19:46] everything
[1:19:47] he don't
[1:19:49] including his wife and children
[1:19:54] and then Jacob was alone with God
[1:20:01] Jacob was left alone and there he
[1:20:03] wrestled with the man God
[1:20:05] until it was the breakup day now
[1:20:10] because you're blessed
[1:20:13] and you're in the message
[1:20:17] you don't even
[1:20:19] every other denominational Church to
[1:20:21] read that as an angel or a man
[1:20:24] our Prophet taught us zillions of times
[1:20:26] it was God
[1:20:29] it was God
[1:20:32] amen and when he saw that he prevailed
[1:20:35] not against him
[1:20:37] he touched the hollow of his high thigh
[1:20:40] see here Jacob I lost one of my
[1:20:45] Jacob
[1:20:48] wouldn't let him go
[1:20:50] until he blessed them I wanted to read
[1:20:52] that part
[1:20:56] but see
[1:20:58] it was coming the breaking of day
[1:21:00] and he needed to let him go and he saw
[1:21:03] that he did not Prevail against him he
[1:21:04] touched the hollow of his thigh the
[1:21:06] hollow of Jacob's sight went out a joint
[1:21:09] as he wrestled with them and he said let
[1:21:12] me go here's God talking to Jacob let me
[1:21:15] go
[1:21:16] for the day breakth and he said I will
[1:21:19] not let thee go
[1:21:21] accept you bless me
[1:21:25] that's where each one of us have to be
[1:21:27] like so locked in with God
[1:21:31] that you don't want to separate
[1:21:34] from God
[1:21:36] amen and he said unto him what is thy
[1:21:38] name and he said Jacob and he said thy
[1:21:41] name shall be called No More Jacob for
[1:21:43] as a prince hast thou power with God and
[1:21:47] with man and hath prevailed and Jacob
[1:21:51] Osman said he said tell me I pray thee
[1:21:53] thy name
[1:21:57] and he said unto
[1:21:59] yeah wait
[1:22:07] sorry
[1:22:09] yes he said and Jacob's asked him he
[1:22:12] said tell me I pray thee thy name and he
[1:22:14] said wherefore is it that thou doest
[1:22:16] thus ask for my name and he said and he
[1:22:20] blessed him there and Jacob called the
[1:22:22] place
[1:22:24] help me out honey
[1:22:27] pennio
[1:22:29] for I have seen the face of God
[1:22:32] and this is where I got my title
[1:22:35] and my life
[1:22:37] is preserved
[1:22:40] I have seen the face of God that was an
[1:22:43] all night
[1:22:45] prayer meeting
[1:22:47] sadly it was when he was in fear
[1:22:52] but God
[1:22:55] never failed to come through now here in
[1:22:57] the message in his presence
[1:23:01] the prophet said pinnacle Pinnacle we're
[1:23:05] going to say it that way if I'm wrong
[1:23:06] forgive me Pinnacle the word pinnacle
[1:23:09] means in the Hebrew the face
[1:23:12] of almighty God
[1:23:14] now there's where even this where Jacob
[1:23:17] or the scriptures is wrote I have seen
[1:23:20] God face to face
[1:23:21] but the Bible earlier said
[1:23:24] there was a man
[1:23:27] I've seen God face to face Panico
[1:23:29] it means the face of God and Jacob was a
[1:23:33] little Shaker and ran his name Jacob
[1:23:36] means the supplanter or Deceiver
[1:23:38] and his life he had run away from God
[1:23:41] but when he got one on one in the
[1:23:43] presence of God the Pinnacle in the face
[1:23:45] of God when he got in the Pinnacle the
[1:23:48] face of God
[1:23:49] he got a hold of God and he wouldn't
[1:23:52] turn him loose and if we would stay
[1:23:54] until
[1:23:56] and he and he stayed there until set up
[1:23:58] and God said let me go the sun's arising
[1:24:01] and he stayed in the face of God until
[1:24:03] son up
[1:24:05] and then he went away Justified and
[1:24:07] saved amen you know the Bible clearly
[1:24:09] and our Prophet clearly said that that's
[1:24:12] what Jacob received the Holy Ghost
[1:24:14] there's a perfect type of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:16] because you know as believers
[1:24:19] when you're converted
[1:24:21] you walk different
[1:24:24] amen you're not a believer
[1:24:28] and got the old things hanging on your
[1:24:30] life
[1:24:30] that you brought to the relationship
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:35] amen there's no way
[1:24:38] Jacob was a perfect he was named the
[1:24:40] prince
[1:24:41] but his hip was out of joint
[1:24:44] he walked the rest of his days with the
[1:24:46] limp he said the church needs to do like
[1:24:49] Jacob did pray until they get a v-day
[1:24:52] victory day he said Jacob wrestled
[1:24:56] wrestled he said he wrestled all night
[1:24:58] with the Lord so there's multiple places
[1:25:01] the prophet called the man the Lord
[1:25:04] he wrestled all night with the Lord but
[1:25:06] he said I'm just not going to let you go
[1:25:10] till you give me Victory what he was
[1:25:12] saying is I'm just not letting I'm not
[1:25:15] stopping praying
[1:25:17] to U.S or my prayer
[1:25:22] wow
[1:25:24] wow
[1:25:26] God help us
[1:25:29] amen here's the one where we talked
[1:25:30] about you know I'm just going to read
[1:25:32] this in church order
[1:25:33] just for amen he said don't stand there
[1:25:37] like the Hypocrites and do it for a long
[1:25:38] time and pray long prayers and say
[1:25:41] this and that and the other and showing
[1:25:44] off
[1:25:45] he says
[1:25:46] God help us amen God help us in our
[1:25:48] church ranks and when you pray enter
[1:25:50] into that closet and do it in secret
[1:25:53] amen this is your one-on-one fellowship
[1:25:55] with God
[1:25:57] amen and he'll reward you openly he
[1:26:00] talks in here church over he said he
[1:26:03] said when you come and have
[1:26:05] have prayer and the song later calls
[1:26:07] somebody for us he said don't pray for
[1:26:09] sister so and so and brother so and so
[1:26:12] in the hospital and so and so and so and
[1:26:14] so and so and so and remember the
[1:26:17] government and all this he said that's
[1:26:19] for your private prayers
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:24] amen God help us amen
[1:26:27] amen I'm just looking for
[1:26:41] an email

[1:26:45] here Psalms 89 6 and 7 are just
[1:26:48] finishing our
[1:26:50] some of our scriptures
[1:26:53] may God help us all amen God help me
[1:26:55] amen
[1:26:56] we know that assembling yourself
[1:26:58] together
[1:26:59] it's not a law but if we can
[1:27:02] amen and even for prayer I mean it's
[1:27:05] just so powerful amen
[1:27:10] Psalms 80 89.
[1:27:13] I can't read my writing now
[1:27:15] Psalms 89 I think it is six and seven
[1:27:33] who in heaven can be compared to the
[1:27:36] Lord
[1:27:37] oh that's beautiful who among the sons
[1:27:41] of the mighty can be likened
[1:27:44] unto the Lord
[1:27:46] he is Jehovah
[1:27:49] but watch the next one but God is
[1:27:51] greatly to be feared
[1:27:54] in the uh
[1:27:57] assembly
[1:27:58] of the Saints
[1:28:01] if the Believers the people if the bride
[1:28:06] would humble themselves assemble
[1:28:08] themselves
[1:28:10] come together and pray
[1:28:13] we'd really see something
[1:28:16] here he said God would greatly be feared
[1:28:19] in the Assembly of the Saints and to be
[1:28:22] made in reverence of all them
[1:28:26] that are about him
[1:28:28] amen there's power
[1:28:31] in assembling
[1:28:32] there's power in prayer but there's
[1:28:34] power in the Assembly of prayer and
[1:28:38] prayer beings Prophet said many many
[1:28:41] many things
[1:28:44] about the all-night prayer meeting just
[1:28:47] you could just go on and on and it
[1:28:49] wasn't that it it had to have a Time on
[1:28:51] it that it was
[1:28:53] but to pray until you prayed through
[1:28:57] pray till you got your answer
[1:29:00] pray till you had enough time that God
[1:29:02] could talk back to you
[1:29:04] amen did God have a relationship
[1:29:08] that you'd be on the contacts of God
[1:29:11] when you come back in need
[1:29:14] God help us
[1:29:16] God help assist them
[1:29:20] you see in the scriptures also Daniel we
[1:29:22] didn't mention Daniel even the Bible
[1:29:25] says when Daniel knew that the decreed
[1:29:27] was passed
[1:29:29] knew it was passed
[1:29:31] you know I'm back and looked at that and
[1:29:33] studying
[1:29:34] you know it don't mention
[1:29:36] about Daniel in that chapter and how he
[1:29:39] prayed before the decree was passed
[1:29:42] you read that chapter where it talks
[1:29:44] about Daniel praying three times a day
[1:29:46] it said that
[1:29:48] it said that he was greatly loved by the
[1:29:51] king and the other people of the Kingdom
[1:29:53] were jealous or envious of them
[1:29:56] and it said when Daniel
[1:29:58] when Daniel knew that the decreed was
[1:30:01] signed
[1:30:02] he never changed his
[1:30:04] form of worship
[1:30:06] he opened his windows just like he
[1:30:08] always did
[1:30:10] and he prayed out loud just like he
[1:30:12] always did he prayed three times a day
[1:30:15] you know God must have been working on
[1:30:16] me on this message because you know when
[1:30:20] it was a little bit nicer me and Luanne
[1:30:22] were coming back from I don't even know
[1:30:24] where it was and and I'll be honest
[1:30:26] it kind of Jarred me a bit or whatever
[1:30:30] the right word is amen we were coming
[1:30:33] back
[1:30:35] and we were on the 401. we stopped in
[1:30:38] the rest area
[1:30:41] and Luanne went into the bathroom I
[1:30:43] don't even know why for a reason I'd
[1:30:45] stayed there I think we had a trailer or
[1:30:47] something
[1:30:49] and there was another
[1:30:51] person or whatever whatever they were
[1:30:53] doing walking around people that pray
[1:30:55] regularly in the different times of day
[1:30:59] and they were in the middle of the
[1:31:00] parking lot where the semis pulled
[1:31:02] around and went behind the McDonald's in
[1:31:04] the drive-through
[1:31:08] now I'll tell you right now
[1:31:10] they don't have one Speck of what you
[1:31:13] have not not even a speck you need a you
[1:31:16] need a microscope to see what they got
[1:31:18] compared to the Revelation and the word
[1:31:21] of God that you have
[1:31:22] and it was time for them to pray to what
[1:31:24] they call God
[1:31:26] he dropped his mat right on the pavement
[1:31:30] took off his shoes and bent over on his
[1:31:33] head man I sat in the truck
[1:31:36] and watched that
[1:31:37] in a bit of all
[1:31:41] if he could worship a false god
[1:31:44] that powerful
[1:31:50] and we're his wife we're the bride of
[1:31:52] Christ
[1:31:54] wow where do we come in
[1:31:58] amen God help us
[1:32:00] sing that song in a Sweet Hour of Prayer
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:09] many things our Prophet said about you
[1:32:11] know the power was in unity and coming
[1:32:13] together and forgetting our differences
[1:32:16] in unity
[1:32:18] and he literally changed that scripture
[1:32:19] every take every single time he
[1:32:21] mentioned it every single time you go in
[1:32:23] the message hub
[1:32:26] and he calls it assembled themselves
[1:32:29] together
[1:32:30] pray it was it was a power and the unity
[1:32:34] of Prayer
[1:32:39] and he said some pretty strong things
[1:32:41] about that he said
[1:32:43] that's why we're not seeing what we
[1:32:45] think we should be seeing
[1:32:47] and we won't do it until we get serious
[1:32:51] in a relationship with God
[1:32:53] God help us amen
[1:32:55] amen
