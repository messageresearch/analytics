We're just grateful to the Lord for his mercy, for his grace, and um so nice to see everybody in the house of God today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to have this beautiful afternoon. And I open the door and it's warmer here than it is back at home. So I I thank thank the Lord for that. You talk about a miracle. &gt;&gt; Warmer in Canada than it is in the southern Tennessee. Amen. It's pretty pretty good. It's pretty good. So, we um uh just literally coming right in. Got to the border down there and they were just one thing after another after another and I was looking and looking at my watch and things and I thought, "Now, Lord, you open the Red Sea for Moses. You're going to have to open these trucks up and things for me." And just a little bit after praying, all of a sudden just jammed all these lanes. All of a sudden, they started moving right on. And so I said, "Well, thank the Lord. He knows how to handle things, don't he?" Amen. And so, it's a real privilege to be here as always. I want to say thank you to Brother Dale and the church body for receiving us. It's always a privilege to be back in the house of God. So many nice, familiar faces all around. Just God bless each of you. Certainly salute all of the ministry here, Brother Norbar and Brother Jose and the different brothers. We appreciate all of you. And and um Amen. As always, the Lane Staff family, you know, they're like my family, you know, and so it's that's one reason it's home. Amen. And I I'm pretty sure some of y'all might debate that. Hey, brother Ben, wait a minute. You know, uh we're family, too. I know you might think that. Well, I feel the same way about you that you're thinking about me. That's for sure. And so, it's nice to be here. So, I thought before I preach a little bit, it be all right. I'm going to sing a song if you don't mind. All right. Yeah. I don't have Samantha with me. School time is in and so she's locked in. But uh you know, you'll have to put up with me for just a little bit. I guess be all right. So we thank the Lord. All right. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing a little bit and then get right into the preaching of the word of the Lord. Somewhere beyond the grave, there is a land. A place Jesus went to prepare by his own hand. But for the save by grace there is our resting place. And in a few more days [Music] I'll be going home. Some call it heaven. I call it home. Some call it dreaming. Oh, let me dream. Some call it paradise. Somewhere beyond the sky. I call it heaven. I call it. Someone said you can go back home again. Things will never never be as good as they got good news for you. When heaven comes into view, one glimpse and you'll know the best is yet to come. Some call it heaven. [Music] I call it home. Some call it dreaming. [Music] Let me dream on. Some call it paradise. [Music] Somewhere beyond the sky, some call it heaven, but I call it home. I'm going to sing that second verse again. Some said you can't go back again. I want you to listen to this. Things will never never be as good as they have got good news for you. Yes, sir. Comes to you. I know the best is yet to come. Some call it heaven. Sing it if you know it. I call it home. Some call it dreaming. Just let me dream on some call it paradise. Yes, sir. Somewhere beyond the sky. Some call it heaven, but I call it home. Oh, some call it paradise. Somewhere beyond the sky, some call it. It's my future. I [Music] praise. [Music] Oh, thank you Jesus. Oh, bless his holy name. [Music] I faced a mountain like I'd never faced before. That's why I'm calling on you, Lord. I know it's been a while, but Lord, please hear my prayer. I need you, Lord, and I'm not ashamed to say. I hope I can get through it. This song blesses me. Sometimes it takes a mountain, [Music] a trouble sea. Sometimes it takes a desert to get a hold of me. Your love is so much stronger than whatever troubles me. Sometimes it takes a mountain to trust you and believe. [Music] Forgive me, Jesus. I thought I could control whatever life would throw my way. All that this I will admit has brought me to my knees. I need you Lord. I'm not ashamed to say to say sometimes it takes a mountain. Sometimes the trail will see. Sometimes it takes a desert to get a hold of me. Oh, your love is so much stronger. ever troubles me. Oh, yes it is. Sometimes it takes a mountain. I just say amen. I trust you and believe. Your love is so much stronger. troubles me. Oh, sometimes a mountain to trust you and believe. Sometimes it takes a mountain. You say, "But what about faith? What about the word? What about all these things we've got confidence in? All of that is true. But you listen to me, human beings, sometimes human beings need encouragement and handfuls on purpose. &gt;&gt; We need the Holy Ghost sometimes to drop things into our pathway to let us know we're still saved, still loved. So our name is on the book of life, the Lamb's book of life, to know that we're still Christian. That he still wants to fool with us, still wants to use us, still wants to bless us. Sometimes it takes a mountain to trust you and believe. And the church said, "Amen." Oh, to trust you and believe. [Applause] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen and amen. Let's stand together. Get right into the preaching of the word of the Lord. Ain't Jesus good? &gt;&gt; I love him with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; Not only has he been good to me, but he's stood by me every step of the way. &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful for his mercy. &gt;&gt; You know, the fact that he just keeps on fooling with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that may not bless some people, but it blesses me. &gt;&gt; God absolutely, I can promise you friends, God absolutely loves the children of God. He loves the people of God. No matter what's going on in our lives or how far it looks like things are going, you know, off the beaten path, &gt;&gt; human beings still need encouragement from the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful to be one of those humans that is encouraged of the Lord. Amen. If you have your Bibles this evening, we're going to go to a couple places. We'll start in St. John chapter 3 verse 16. Very familiar little Bible scripture for us that we learned. Perhaps one of the first ones we ever learned. It might be just this one right here. And so want to look at a couple things that Brother Ram said here in just a moment. But I I want to speak to you this evening, the Lord helping us upon the world is dying for love. The world is dying for love. St. John 3:1 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Then I want to go to one more scripture if we can uh get into the Bible in the book of Corinthians. We're going to look at just one more verse of scripture. We're going to pray and I'll let you be seated. Amen. And we're going to get settled in to hear what the Lord's going to speak to us. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 13. And I want to pick up verse um 8. 1 Corinthians 13:8. Charity never faileth. &gt;&gt; But where there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. Let's pray together for the word. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much for the opportunity to be able to come into your house tonight. It's just a wonderful feeling, Lord, to walk into the building full of the saints of God, to feel that great expectation of your spirit hanging in every heart. &gt;&gt; Lord, my heart's expecting, too. So many things, Lord Jesus, that we want to know from your presence. So many things we want to learn from you. May we sit as it were at your feet tonight to be able to learn from the great teacher, the great rabbi. Father, we love you and thank you for this opportunity to read the word. And Father, the Bible said that any man or woman that would read it, blessed are they that read and hear the words of these prophecies. And father, we thank you for even being able to read it to have understanding, common understanding that we can hear your truth. We thank you for all of the safe journey of every wayward pilgrim traveling in this great life to come into this joint fellowship tonight. Thank you for every leader and for every son and daughter of God gathered here tonight. Lord Jesus, if there be one amongst us in any way, Lord, that possibly might be fighting a great battle greater than they've ever expected in their life, may tonight you come to their pew and visit them with your great delivering power. If there be those that are discouraged, may they be encouraged. Those that are sick, may they be healed. May your power, your grace, and your mercy move and wash over us tonight and through thy word that we might be recipients of everything you want to say to us as we open our heart both speaker and listener and commit it and dedicate it to you, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. And the saints said, "Amen." God bless you. May be seated. Amen. So good to see everybody. Amen. The house of the Lord. Did you leave this for me? Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. Thank you. You know me well. I didn't bring one with me. It's sitting back here on her in the car somewhere. Amen. And uh and see this is why I call them family right here. They know me already. Amen. And I Amen. I appreciate that. Amen. So very much. And and so um so many things that I think when I get up here, I'm going to say this and comment on that and whatever more. And you know, just time gets away before you even know what you're thinking about saying. And uh I just got to looking at some things, you know, coming up the road. I was just meditating and I still had about two or three directions that I wanted to go. And uh I thought, well, now if I start that, they start at 3, we'll be done at 8. And then I thought another one. I thought, will that be a good text? I thought, no, if I start that one, 5:30, we'll be in the middle of a great altar call, more than likely. Amen. So, you know, you just kindly trust the Lord in these matters. You don't always know exactly which way the Lord's going to send you, but I studied and I've applied myself for this meeting this weekend, and I'm looking for the great Holy Spirit to speak to us by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I believe he can sure do it. Don't you think so? &gt;&gt; Now, we're living in a time that is we know the world in the condition as is, I mean, you and I both can agree wholeheartedly that the world is indeed dying for love. But uh I I I don't want to just leave it just in that form. But I I want to show how that we as the people of God can get to that place of the love of God and declaring it not only to those around us and those that need to hear it, but also how to receive it within oursel. And uh there's many many things that I'd like to share with you. But I'm going to quote some of this instead of reading some of this. And so if you got your uh your tablet or your pencil or your paper, your phone, wherever how you keep a note, I'm going to give you as many scriptures as I can throw your direction and you you get them ready and uh study them. And uh I want to start you out on uh Matthew 24 and verse 12. Now again, I'm going to try to quote some of this rather than spend a lot of time reading because uh you know uh you you know uh you know how I am. You all know what kind of preacher I am. And if I do too much reading, we'll be here two and a half hours. And Amen. It's not that it's a problem. We enjoy the long service if the Lord's in it. I told somebody one time, I said, "A guy preaching under the inspiration for two hours," Amen. He didn't preach long enough. Anybody that preaches out from under the inspiration, 20 minutes is too long. Amen. That's right. It needs to be inspired. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want the Holy Spirit to be on it. And so we we want to look at this great subject. Amen. And I just want to call your attention to this scripture in Matthew 24 because iniquity, Jesus said, shall abound. The what? The love of many shall wax cold. Now, I I want to call your attention to something right quickly. And I want you to realize this kind of love that he's referring to. He's not referring to agape love per se. He's talking about the ailio love or the human love or the compassion that someone would have, amen, for another human being. And the prophet described it like this. He said many many years ago and this is back in his many many years ago. He said that when uh someone died in the community, said everybody knew about it, they'd rush to help and benefit and support and and and prop up and things. He said, "But now," he said, "In this day," and he's talking in the 60s here. Amen. He said, "You don't even know that your neighbor has died until you read it in the newspaper somewhere." He said, "What is it?" He said that the love amongst people has gone down, down, down, down until Jesus said the reason for it being that way is because iniquity has abounded amongst humanity. Now I want you to think in your mind about what iniquity is. The prophet tells us it is to know to do something uh according to the word, according to scripture, not just according to your thought of it now, but according to the word and fail to do it. And yet we realize that a person that has been baptized with the Holy Ghost, amen, that has the agape love of God in their heart, can even in that form of it, humanistically speaking now, can get colder and colder on the Lord. He told them in that first church age because you left your first love. Now notice the love itself was still there. The love itself was still accessible and you was able to access that a genuine agape love of God. But they were the ones that fell away from the fire, from the heat, and from the passion of serving Jesus Christ when he fell on the day of Pentecost. Stay with me a little while. Amen. Now, remember, the Holy Spirit then is calling a bride in the last day to do what? To demonstrate love in the greatest age of hatred that has ever been on the face of this earth. I thought about this coming up the road, Brother Jim. How evil man can become. How hateful they become. How that everything about them just gets worse every year. Every year. Every year. Amen. And if you've been watching any of the politics in the United States, which I'm sure you have, Amen. you can see on display almost weekly or daily. Amen. the depravity and the absolute depths of degrt that humankind has got, especially down there in that cursed place, amen, called the United States of America. Amen. Trump might be a lot of people's savior. He's not mine. I've already give my heart to my savior. Amen. I'm not looking for politics to rescue me. Come on, don't get quiet. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible didn't say that politics would come in the last day and turn our hearts back. Amen. It said that Malachi 4 would. Amen. Christ would come, Amen. to return our heart back to the original faith of the fathers. Amen. The same faith that produced for them the agape love of God. I heard brother say it just this week. He said they didn't go out and build a bunch of schools and and build up a bunch of money and a great big old tithing account and millions of dollars and buildings and things. You know what he said? They divided among themselves severally as they would that they could have all things in common. Amen. I'm not suggesting we become the Amish or something. Amen. and go out and go live in some cave somewhere or another. Amen. But the love of God constrain them people. Amen. Don't put nothing first but Jesus Christ and body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if we do that and we keep that focus, you could be a multi multi-rillionaire. If your heart is on God, you'll always do the right thing. I feel that if God can trust you with your soul, he can Amen. ent and trust you with your walk and trust you with the word and things that he'll trust you with money. But let's be honest, it's become an Achilles heel for many of our church people. &gt;&gt; I was listening this week to a message called Presuming 11762. Everybody had him say something that really stuck with me in a way that I never thought of it just this way before. But he was talking about how that the Pentecostal people have become so fashionable. He said, "But I wouldn't care if a man come and preach in overhauls to me." &gt;&gt; He said, "As long as he brings the power of God and the word of God. He said, "But then some little curly-headed fellow he called it, comes." He said, "He dips that head and poses for the camera so they can put those curls out there and show, amen, the advertisement of it." And he said, "Pentecost, you backslid from what you originally had." In other words, the love of praise, the love of attention, the love of a building or a big society had replaced the genuine love of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; All right, message people. Now I'm coming home. Amen. If that was that way 60 years ago, what about some of our people around the ranks? Amen. We have been just to say it just in a very very plain way. We've had the revealed word thrown in our lap. Forgive me for that, but it's the truth. Amen. We've had the word thrown in our lap. And what are we doing with it today? The same exact thing they done with it 60 years ago. Amen. Trying to build better and get better preachers, more educated this and more money that. Amen. And we've left the main thing which was the love of God. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; The love of Jesus Christ inside the human heart that brought a man to his knees in repentance every time. Brought a woman to her knees in repentance. Brought families back to the family altar, reading the Bible and doing devotions, giving their heart to Jesus Christ. Amen. And if we had more of that, you'd see a whole lot more in the churches that were walking where they should walk. But the reason we have so much discouragement is because we've allowed the love for everything else to take place of the love of God. &gt;&gt; Well, not so many amens now, but I'm still in it. &gt;&gt; And I'm still telling you the truth, and it's right. &gt;&gt; And if you if you know what's good for you, shake your head this way. Don't dare shake it that way, &gt;&gt; cuz I'm telling you the truth, brother. And it's not just Canada. It's not just the United States, but all around the world, this lady seeing thing is swallowing people up &gt;&gt; quicker than we can keep count of who's going out. &gt;&gt; God help us. As Jesus said, because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. This word, Amen, waxing cold simply means to cool by blowing. You see, friends, we're living in the most connected age that we've ever lived in. You can get on your your cell phone, your tablet. They're doing it tonight. You can stream online. People from all around the world sitting in their bark lounger. They're lazy boys. Is that all right if they got one? Amen. Can sit right here and enjoy service with us. And yet people can sit right families and individuals alike can sit right across from one another at a kitchen table and be so disconnected they don't even know what's going on in each other's lives. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you a story. It's a little rude in a way, but I I feel led to tell it. Some years ago, there was a young woman that got on one of these uh dating websites and she had decided she wasn't going to serve the Lord no more. And and uh she was just kind of toying around with her husband a little bit. wasn't being really faithful. And he told a story how that she told him later that she'd be sitting right in the bed next to him and they'd be sitting there, maybe their head up against the headboard, maybe reading or talking or whatever they're doing. She had her phone out and said she was sitting there making fun. My husband don't even know that you and I are talking. I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie. And this, that, and the other. Sitting right in the bed next to her husband and flirting with her little side thing she had going on. &gt;&gt; We're living in the most connected age we've ever been. But we're more disconnected now than we've ever been in human history. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen to brother Ben, young people. This thing is not something I'm going to tell you is of the devil. I'm going to tell you it's not good. It's not bad. It's off the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And I'm going to tell you, if you don't have the Holy Ghost, you'll never know how to manage it right. &gt;&gt; It'll get you every single time. And except a man be born again, he'll get in trouble. Except a woman be born again, the devil will get them through some kind of divisibility. We got to pay attention to these things. Preachers are running around still preaching against television. Let Let me tell you something right now. You can preach on the TV all day long. This thing I got laying up here way worse than a television ever thought about being. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will take you into every library. It'll take you into every smut thing. It'll take you into everything you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. Kids walking around with ear pods and and ear ear things in their ear. Amen. Listening to all kinds of ungodly filth. And mom and dad walking around their head in a cloud. Don't even know what's happening. Amen. Don't just preach to me about television. Amen. Don't just preach to me about devices, but preach to me in love. Hallelujah. That'll take my heart away from all of that. And put it back in the word of God where it belongs. &gt;&gt; That's right. For he that loves the world or the things that are in the world, the love of God is not even in that person. &gt;&gt; But if God's love was there, Amen. And you wouldn't have to worry about kids reaching for the wrong thing, adults reaching for the wrong thing, middle-ag and whoever more, families reaching for the wrong thing. The love of God would burn so deeply and so brightly that they would want nothing more but more of Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I I know how we feel about it. Preach against it. We did that on the tele on the telephones many, many years ago. Where'd they go? I bet every one of you's got a telephone in your house. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even in the church. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Jose. Amen. And what I'm trying to tell you is that we tried for years to shove this stuff out of the church. Just like Christmas, the prophet said, is here to stay. So is this stuff here to stay. &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of whether or not we get out there with picket signs and down with technology and down with the rudeness of the world and down. They'll never listen to you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. The main thing is to go back into that human heart. Are you listening to me tonight? Say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody help me preach a little bit. The main thing is go back into that human heart and let the love of God change them forever until something in them don't even want to look at it no more. That's right. &gt;&gt; We preached it and preached it and had one prayer line after another and one altar call after another and the best in the message and the best on the face of this earth have preached it to the people that need to hear it. And yet it still goes on. &gt;&gt; What's missing? The love of God that takes away the sins of the world. The love of God that takes away the burdens and the guilt. The love of God that takes away all of the devices and Satan's traps in this last day. Kids go to school, they're going to need electronics. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sure. People are gathered in a church like this, we're going to have electronics all over the place. Amen. I need a microphone to preach. I need one. &gt;&gt; Amen. because my mouth is so little. You know, you can't hear me unless I have one. Praise the Lord, somebody. &gt;&gt; Man, we have these things a part of our life. They're part of your job. They're part of everything. But what have they served to do? Disconnect people one from another. &gt;&gt; Phones that can reach to the other side of the world, as I said, and hearts that can't even reach across the table. &gt;&gt; That's the age we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a hard thing. We got churches on every corner, streaming services full of sermons, and enough teaching to fill the internet 10 times over of the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Sure. And yet here we sit around hearing all of that, knowing all of that, having the Bible in every form, and having the message in every form we can have it. And yet we still come to the house of God and sit in a pew and feel like somehow Jesus don't love me. That's right. &gt;&gt; But you say, "Brother Ben, I I I I know what the profit." It's the more there's a difference between knowing what Brother Brandon said about it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And having the revelation of it deep in your heart yourself. &gt;&gt; Sure. Oh, you say now preacher, you're going to fool around and you're going to get beside yourself. Well, I'm happy. Leave me alone. Don't bother me if I get next to myself. Just let me go on. &gt;&gt; I don't know no better know how. So, you might as well just let me go on. Now, watch this. In the resurrection of Lazarus, brother said, "We've got plenty of teaching, plenty of churches, but we need more of my messages, more in my books, more of my sermons, &gt;&gt; more gifts. &gt;&gt; We need more of the most anointed evangelists in the world. We need more of the love of God." Can you imagine this prophet saying to us that these things are more important than gifts or anything else? More important than prophecy, tongue or anything else? Where they are there, they will fail. &gt;&gt; Like you take for example the great controversies over some of the things that didn't come to pass in brother Brennham's visions. And people have have lost their mind and quit God and quit church over the thing with the brown bear. &gt;&gt; Oh, a vision is a thus sayeth the Lord. That's right. As God is concerned, when God tells you something's going to happen, it's going to happen. But the human element &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; can cause it to fail. &gt;&gt; And just because Brother Brandham was supposed to shoot a brown bear doesn't mean that he was going to actually be there to shoot the brown bear if he wasn't there to shoot the brown bear. &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you a little example. Now, brother Bam told us, he said, "God's part happened." &gt;&gt; Brother Bisll just told us a story some years ago how that brotherham had told him what happened. He said, "Only the second time I ever failed the Lord like this was when I listen to that bunch of preachers in Africa down there. &gt;&gt; God's part, God brought the vision exactly where it needed to be. But where there is prophecy, it can fail. &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that can't fail. That's the love of God." I'm going to go on record and say something else to you. Do you know what held brother Brandham when he realized he messed up? You know what held the prophet when he took that amoeba and like to die over listen that bunch of preachers? How many times did he stand on the platform and tell the people, "I can't do nothing. I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord to come and if he'll come, I know he'll do the work." How many times did brother Brandham see failure after failure at that platform &gt;&gt; and still want off preaching? &gt;&gt; You don't imagine in your mind that every person that come through the prayer line got healed, do you? &gt;&gt; You're silly if you think that. &gt;&gt; You're living in a delusion. &gt;&gt; The prophet told us himself that many of them come through the prayer line never even got nothing from God. Many of them didn't have the kind of faith they needed to get what they needed from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they what you done. An angel of the Lord stood there and told him, "You'll pray for kings and everything else." And here this prophet stands in Minneapolis and made a challenge that some blind girl was going to see and he failed. And brother stood right there on the platform, prayed and prayed and prayed and she was stone blind. You know what the Lord told him? He said, "You made a challenge that not even I made when I was here in my human body. I never said that it's going to be certain certain way if you pray for people." He said, "If you can get them to believe, &gt;&gt; you don't demand God. You don't command God. &gt;&gt; You believe God. &gt;&gt; And if it's his will, it happens the way he says it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; But there is a human element. &gt;&gt; I told a little group of people here just the other weekend, back in the summer, I should say, that some of the most precious things that I've ever learned in this message was from Brett Brennham's humanities and his mistakes. I come to respect him deeper, respect him more and love the message even more. When I could hear a prophet stand up and say, "I got under a bunch of pressure and told a lie." &gt;&gt; That helps me. &gt;&gt; Maybe it don't help you, but that helps me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to hear brother Brandham go through all of these ups and downs of Christianity and yet right to the end, he stood faithful. What done that? &gt;&gt; Not the messianic sign. Not the sign in his hand. Not that he was Malachi 4. Not that he was Revelation 10. Come on, somebody help me. &gt;&gt; That's not the thing that held him. But what held him was the love of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; To know God loved &gt;&gt; that he loved God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the main thing. Amen. If a man lives long enough and old enough, and if he gets down in his age, something like that, he's going to have to quit preaching. let me get a little age on me or something like that. I may not be able to sing anymore. My hands might be so arthritic ridden or something like that. I might never be able to play the piano at some point in my life. That doesn't take God out of me. &gt;&gt; That doesn't take me away from loving him. &gt;&gt; His love is what holds us &gt;&gt; more than anything. The prophet said, he said, "That's right." He said, "You can't borrow $5 without $10 worth of security on it this day." He said, "That's right. no love because iniquity shall abound. That's what's the matter with the world. They're dying for love. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at a couple little things here. Now, they shall wax cold. Again, Matthew 24:12. Trill or grow cold by blowing. Chill by blowing. Grow cold by blowing. In other words, love does not die instantly, &gt;&gt; but it freezes gradually under the cold winds of sin and iniquity. &gt;&gt; You take a church, brother, sister, and I've seen this in my many years of traveling. You take a group of people that's on love in love with God and on fire for God. Bring them into the church and let that group start criticizing, &gt;&gt; start nitpicking everything that moves. You take that individual or that church or that people or that family, &gt;&gt; you'll watch what they used to have by the love of God starts dwindling away. Looks like &gt;&gt; they don't raise their hands no more. &gt;&gt; They don't amen no more. &gt;&gt; They don't have a commitment to want to be clear about the things of God. They just want to debate something all the time. &gt;&gt; And I want to be very clear, a debating spirit is an antichrist spirit. Just take me for example since I'm standing here. You got something wrong with something I preach and you instantly the first thing you can think of is how you want to straighten me out or correct me. You need to get first the baptism of the Holy Ghost and or you need to get that old devil off you that's got you in that kind of mindset. The love of God would never put a man in such a condition or a woman in such a condition. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God would make you say, "Maybe I don't understand what the brother's saying, but Lord, if I'm wrong, help me understand what's true." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you don't see that in our churches. &gt;&gt; You know what? You see a bunch of professional debaters. &gt;&gt; And if you say 1962, my God, heaven help you, it was 1961, you have committed the unpardonable sin. All right. &gt;&gt; They know it right down to the uh uh uh and the dthe and but but they will hold your feet to the fire over something that doesn't even mean eternal life. &gt;&gt; The elected cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; I don't sit around worrying about everything preached and oh somebody preached something wrong. Everybody preaches something wrong at some point in their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what holds me is not my theology, but the love of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a whole lot more neology anyways than theology. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Forgive me. That wasn't even fair. But that's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, plenty of teaching, plenty of churches, but we need the love of God. Now, what happens when the love of God starts cooling down in people? All right. Now, I want you to think about what we've seen over the last many years of being in the message. When you get somebody that they have so cooled down in their love for Jesus Christ, doctrine or their point of doctrine becomes a weapon. Right. &gt;&gt; People that do not have the love of God, now listen close, will weaponize the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You take somebody, you know, their kids aren't saved and that father in that home, we'll use for example, has got this idea that, boy, I better lay down the law. I'm gonna lose my children. If you don't love them right, &gt;&gt; no matter what he says will never prosper him or benefit him, &gt;&gt; it'll actually drag him down even further. &gt;&gt; And the weapon will become a word &gt;&gt; of of of ammunition, of of debating, of of downgrading, devaluing, of of shoving in the mud and kicking in the face and throwing sand in the eyes and the whole thing. &gt;&gt; They become bullies. Spiritual bullies. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we wonder times why families in this message, the second these kids get old enough to do something, they run 40 ways to Sunday. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Maybe it's because every time you told them that uh when somebody said Merry Christmas one to another, you put them in the in the middle of hell for saying Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; I wish people believe the message like they're supposed to believe it because the prophet said Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a tree. He gave gifts. He wasn't a pagan. I heard him say it just the other day. He said Christmas should be a day of worship, not celebration. &gt;&gt; That's your prophet saying that. &gt;&gt; But many of our kids run out the back door and quit the message over simple things like being so dogmatic and so legalistic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm coming anyhow, devil. You might as well buckle up here. I'm coming. &gt;&gt; Right. Every little thing. Well, glory to God. Your dress better be right to the floor. &gt;&gt; And yet, Brother Brandham's own daughters Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can see photos where media and every one of them have their dress right below their knee. The prophet said the rule is standing or sitting cover up that knee. Why? Cuz the Bible said this part is the nakedness of a person. &gt;&gt; That's a truth. &gt;&gt; And if a man's got so many problems he's lusting after somebody's calf, he needs a Holy Ghost. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Right? But the point I'm making is this is what happens when the love leaves the home. When love leaves the church, the pastor goes on the attack. He picks out every little thing that he don't like and and the evangelist will pick out everything and they just hammer hammer hammer. You can do it if you've got the love of God in your heart doing it. &gt;&gt; But if the love isn't there, it becomes a weapon. &gt;&gt; And instead of encouraging people to come to Christ, &gt;&gt; it shoves them right out the back door. It encourages them to leave. &gt;&gt; Cuz the world doesn't want to hear a weaponized message. They can tell. You can't bluff humanity. &gt;&gt; When a preacher gets up if he's got the love of God, you can feel he loves you. &gt;&gt; He might be ripping the hide right off your bones, but you know he's loving you. But if it becomes a weapon, you can tell by the lack of the output of the spirit of God that the thing is more just trying to get people put in a position to where that whoever it is that's got that agenda feels comfortable that now they've accomplished what they wanted to accomplish in their heart. There's many, many, many of our families that are sitting right now at a home somewhere or somewhere else with a broken heart over the way that the truth was handled in their lives. &gt;&gt; And you know what they need? They need somebody from the inside to go to the outside and show them the love of God. That it may have been preached, it may have been taught, it may have been believed, but God, this is a brand new morning and yesterday ended last night. We can go on in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We can go on in Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm not a debater. If anybody knows anything about me at all, I'm a peacemaker. But mercy, Lord Jesus, when this anointing comes on me, it is just as rough and hard and rude as it can possibly. Why? Because the love of God constrains you to set before the people only that which will help them instead of hurting them. And if we don't have this love in our heart, &gt;&gt; the message will become a weapon for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. And we don't want to weaponize the message. We don't want to make the message a weapon to prove our own points. &gt;&gt; Listen to me carefully. The message in the Bible isn't here to prove my point. &gt;&gt; My point needs to be proved by the message in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the the the truth of God not mixed with the love of God can be a a killer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say now, brother Ben, now wait a minute. Paul said that the letter killth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the spirit gives life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So if the word is not mixed with love, &gt;&gt; it'll kill you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It'll lay you into a place to where you yourself don't even know &gt;&gt; how to feel about Christ, &gt;&gt; about yourself. &gt;&gt; It'll leave you in a state of confusion. &gt;&gt; Words. Amen. In case you forgot it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of us that are so, you know, our whole attitude and our whole way of life is glory to God. If I can just read it, if I can just hear the prophet say, "That's all I need, it'll kill you." Right. &gt;&gt; It'll kill you dead if you don't have the love of God in there. &gt;&gt; To know how to place that word and put it in its right position. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's a reason why we got so many dead churches. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; They care more about programs and everything else. The love of God is not there. Tell me, how in the world can message churches become so polluted with their own ways &gt;&gt; until to them the only time somebody dances as if they're a wedding &gt;&gt; or a birthday party &gt;&gt; or some kind of a thing like that &gt;&gt; or we get at a volleyball game and people will dance around. Woo! Look at you see that point I made and then come in church and set like a bunch of bumps on a pickle. [Music] The Bible said, "If the love of God is in you, you'll love not the things of the world." But if you love the world and the things that are in it, the love of God is not even in you. You can't have it both ways. It's one or the other. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Oh, if their grandson kicked a soccer goal, they would run around the benches and slap somebody off their head and whoop bigger Yahoo and everything else in the world. But then you can come and preach the word of God under inspired preaching and not even claw their mouth open to get a pry their mouth open to even get an amen, hallelujah, and praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I won't say the love of God ain't there, but it's cooled off so cool it has no control over you anymore. &gt;&gt; You've allowed the world to blow and project this thing to you. Amen. Amen. Until you no longer have that real feeling. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I in this tonight I'm bringing these five points. The first one I'm working on now is this love lost. But now I want to talk for a little bit about love revealed. Now 1 John chapter 4 verse 7 and 8. Amen. If you like to turn in your book, you can. But I'm going to put it right here for you. 1 John 4 and then 7 and 8. Now watch how John puts this. This is a beautiful way to express exactly what we should be right here in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's an easy thing to say amen to, isn't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's an entirely different thing alto together when brother or sister has offended you. &gt;&gt; Woo! Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Did you get that amen tape made up yet? I may need it. &gt;&gt; Now, think about it. John commands us to love one another. &gt;&gt; Not make excuses for one another, &gt;&gt; but love one another. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want us to overlook sin. He &gt;&gt; doesn't want us to overlook wrong. If you see a brother overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual, go to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's just scripture. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; That's right. But then when you've been hurt, &gt;&gt; somebody done you wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know the first instinct, don't you? Glory to God. I'm not going to that church no more. But they'll go to Walmart. &gt;&gt; I've had plenty of those mean people say things to me at Walmart and hurt my feelings and I didn't do nothing to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I still go to Wally World whenever I need something. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I went to that church and somebody offended me so deeply. And so we think to oursel, "Well, I want to get my kids out of that mess." We do them a great disservice by taking them from the very place where they could best learn to discern between right and wrong, good and evil. &gt;&gt; You're going to get offended in church. You're going to get your feelings hurt by people in church. There are going to be hypocrites, devils, liars, losers, and everything else in the world. You are going to cross paths with some of the worst of the worst. But you're also going to cross paths with some of the best of the best. &gt;&gt; And for all categories of life, you've got to have enough love in your heart &gt;&gt; to be able to overlook many of these things. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know how it goes. If people don't dance our tune, &gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't want to dance with them no more. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Y'all come for revival. &gt;&gt; That's what we having. &gt;&gt; We're going to have good oldfashioned revival. Get this stuff out of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Now, watch what John says. Everyone that loveth is &gt;&gt; my goodness. So if I've got the Holy Ghost, this is an automatic part of my nature. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My nature, if God is in there, my nature is to love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to work for it. I don't have to fight for it. I don't have to work it up and try to figure out how to get there. It's automatically a part of my nature. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if God is in there, I will automatically express love to you. &gt;&gt; Then tell me where does all this foolishness come from? People sitting in pews next to each other that have absolutely had grudges against one another for 40 years. &gt;&gt; They wronged me in 1962. They wronged me in 1948. &gt;&gt; They need the Holy Ghost. They need to be born again. &gt;&gt; Cuz the love of God would give them a feeling. Well, maybe brother didn't mean it that way exactly. Or you might say, "That man absolutely meant that, but I'm going to forgive him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to have mercy on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm sure at some time in my life, I've done the same thing to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, folks, if we want to go out of here in the rapture, the resurrection, there's only one pathway that takes us there. Perfect love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't think so? Go back and listen. Adoption. Listen at your prophet. When he said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, it'll take perfect love to put you in that place." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't have it, you ain't never going to have it. &gt;&gt; It takes God to put you in a spot. Amen. &gt;&gt; To where you can show this selfless sacrificial love. Amen. Not just a love that I agree with you when you agree, but a love that even when things are not so agreeable, &gt;&gt; I can continue believing and having faith and prayer, holding out hope. &gt;&gt; Just go back and read the first couple chapters of Genesis. Do you are you aware or do you realize that God talked to Cain more than he ever did Adam or Abel in the first four chapters of Genesis? &gt;&gt; Had more conversations with Cain. &gt;&gt; You know why? All he had to do was tell Adam what he done wrong and set the law and the word out there. The day you eat, there's the day you die. He told Abel, revealed to Abel what the revelation was. We don't even know if that came by voice or just revelation. &gt;&gt; But the moment that he comes to Cain, do like your brother. Even after he messes up and God's going to put a mark on him, send him out. God's talking to him all over again. Don't you see why? That's what love does. &gt;&gt; It reaches out to those that are unreachable. &gt;&gt; It tries to touch those that are untouchable. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It tries to go to the depths of the places that no one else wants to go. My goodness. He that loveth not knoweth not God, &gt;&gt; for God is love. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Now, let's look at uh a little statement here in divine love in 1957. He said, "Do you remember my sermon Sunday? The little mainspring in the middle of the watch times that watch to everything." He said, "When God is love and love, now watch this now. When God is love and love moves into our heart, it times every emotion, every right with God's Bible." &gt;&gt; So the main spring of that watch places every synchrony in its proper order. The minute hand, the hour hand, the second hand, a device that sets off the alarm, &gt;&gt; one that controls the dates and the calendars and the beeping and whatever else it can do. &gt;&gt; The mainspring is what controls and listen, not just controls it, but synchronizes all of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; So if we go to a church, Brother Jim, and the gifts are out of order, people's emotions are out of order, &gt;&gt; things are not operating in a in a in a in a a synchronization of the spirit. &gt;&gt; When the song leader leads singing, half the people aren't singing and threequarters of them are sleeping. And &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then the pastor gets up and preach and he has to apologize 37 times cuz I don't know what's going on. Something's wrong. I &gt;&gt; something seems to be so out of order. Wonder what that could be. &gt;&gt; Wonder if the reason other things are not in sync, it's because the mainspring isn't operating like it needs to. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the love of God controls everything else. &gt;&gt; Y'all ready for this quote? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "If you had perfect love, you'd have perfect gifts." &gt;&gt; Why? Because love would control anything that gets in error. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't be deceived. If we ever try to move into the spirit of God to the place to where we start moving into gifts and supernatural things, you're going to have problems. You're going to have errors. You're going to miss the mark. You're going to say things that aren't that way and should be this way instead of that. You're going to have every bit of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if the love of God is present &gt;&gt; in the church, in the leaders, and the person themsself, &gt;&gt; when the word tells them that they missed it, &gt;&gt; they're going to have something in them to say, "Oh, Jesus, Lord, &gt;&gt; please Lord, don't don't let me get in that shape. Don't let me get in that mile. Lord, I just want to be right. Lord, I just want to do. I want to be a blessing to the body. I want to be." But not this attitude of glory to God. I'm gifted. So is the devil. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Gifts don't make you saved. Gifts don't make you born again. &gt;&gt; I've met too many preachers in my lifetime that spend the majority of their life running around bragging about how gifted they are. &gt;&gt; In the eyes of God, a preacher ain't no more than a drunk that got saved 10 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll help you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but you say they're preachers. I They are servants to the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And I'll agree. Those that rule well should be worth kind of worthy of double honor. That's true. But never should we ever look at a gift and that gift be equated or be equaled up to that man has the Holy Ghost. Just cuz he's gifted doesn't mean he's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of them standing behind the platform that's not even born again, much less how are they going to get you to born again when they ain't themselves. That's right. &gt;&gt; The little mainspring controls everything. Then says these words, "The world is sick and tired of looking at great big spires, fine dressed people, and a bunch of isms." &gt;&gt; What they want to see is the genuine love of God &gt;&gt; projected in the hearts of his people. &gt;&gt; That's what the world is looking for. The world is dying. &gt;&gt; Love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, let's go back to the uh 13th chapter of Corinthians again, but let's pick up the first three verses. Now, I want to move on to my next point tonight, which is love tested. Now, we've seen love. Amen. Uh lost. We're looking at love revealed to the human heart. Now, love tested. I'm kind of segmenting some of these things off into like a little point so you can keep it running in your mind. big big subject and I just want to kind of partition off if you will or section off these five main points. Now working on this third one here. 1 Corinthians 13 1-3. Love tested. Now though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity, I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. &gt;&gt; And if I have not charity, Paul said, I have nothing. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the man that is saying this? This is the same man that said, "I speak in tongues more than y'all." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Same man that wrote the Bible. &gt;&gt; Many, many prophecies in those books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it now. Oh, but you he was Paul didn't say if I don't know that I'm a church age messenger, I have nothing. &gt;&gt; He even put his own gift in with this sir &gt;&gt; cuz he said where there be knowledge it'll fail. &gt;&gt; Tongues will cease. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I had to forget everything I ever knew and learned &gt;&gt; to know Jesus Christ as my savior." &gt;&gt; He put every gift, even his own. &gt;&gt; He put every calling, even his own. &gt;&gt; That if he didn't have charity, every bit of this would fail. Why? This is the main spring. This is the main spring that controls everything else. If Paul wouldn't have had this, he would have never been the Paul that we know. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, we'll never be the bride that Jesus wants to show. &gt;&gt; My So he uses this love, this Greek word Philadelphia, which is brotherly love, affectionate love. And then again the fellowship love or the sharing or participation love. The gifts that operate are operated for the sake of participation. Remember that church is not a spectator sport. &gt;&gt; I I know I've told you this a 100 times, but I'm going to say it again. God didn't expect you to come to church and just sit and spectate. [Music] He wants you to participate, &gt;&gt; which means everyone has a role to play. &gt;&gt; Right? God's not just the God of the pullpit up here. He's the God of the audience out there as well. &gt;&gt; The pastor or the evangelist or teacher, apostle, prophet is not the only one that can go out and pray for the sick. &gt;&gt; That's just the only one many people accept. &gt;&gt; You know why they do that? Not because they have real love, they have respect of persons. &gt;&gt; But if I'm sick and you're born again, I don't care if you're just a housewife. I want you praying for me. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; If you're a child and God has moved on your faith and you've got faith, I want you praying for me. That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't need just some preacher to come lay his hands on me. I don't need just some great man of God. That's respect of persons. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "But if brother Brandham was here, &gt;&gt; well, let's just see if that check will cash, can we?" &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said many, many times, I'll give you one and you can go do the homework yourself. But he said, "Brother Bram, is it true that only you should be preaching and nobody else should preach?" &gt;&gt; Mercy, brother, no mercy. Where did you hear that? &gt;&gt; I never said that. Why? I'm just a little pebble on the beach. You see, cuz brother Bradom wasn't overwhelmed and and and and and so plumbed to the bone with this respect to person stuff like we see today, &gt;&gt; you know, cuz the way some people are, brother Joseph Ran, I'm believe he was still here, Rebecca or Smith, George or somebody come walking through here, people would sit in the pew go, "Oh, oh my, oh my, the prophet's family. Oh my, so anointed." No more anointed than I am in a pull pit tonight. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; If some great visible preacher in the message come walking in here and sat on the back pew, many of you could barely even follow a half of what I'm saying. For one, wonder what that brother's doing. &gt;&gt; And many will listen to see what he's amening to see whether they can amen or not. &gt;&gt; I've seen it many times, brother D. Some pastor sitting on the platform like this and I start preaching something he don't exactly agree with. Man, I'm in territory I don't even know I'm in, but I'm there. And the people know it, too. &gt;&gt; Cuz all of a sudden, he gets that look on his face. &gt;&gt; And somehow another the amen start dying down. &gt;&gt; Respect of persons. &gt;&gt; When you don't have the love of God, this is what starts infiltrating our churches. &gt;&gt; My my my. So we have to test this love to make sure that it lines up with the word. Now listen to this. Brother said why some people can't keep the victory. He said the love of God, God is love. And unless each one of these gifts is put right in the center of love, &gt;&gt; it becomes selfish and indifferent. &gt;&gt; Now listen what happens when love is missing. It pulls itself off, isolates itself &gt;&gt; and fuss and stew. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hesitate to say what I'm getting ready to say &gt;&gt; because I'm getting ready to talk about a man we all know and loved. &gt;&gt; He's gone now. &gt;&gt; But at the end of this man's ministry, this is what started happening right here. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before he went on, I was the only approved evangelist in the country. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there was only one other pastor that had thus sayeth the Lord. All the rest of them were wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; I don't put people in hell for things like that. But this is what brother Brandham said. When the love of God starts leaving you, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; when love cools down, this is what happens. &gt;&gt; Watch that amongst people in the churches. When that love starts dying down for truth and for fellowship and brotherhood, they start getting nitpicky &gt;&gt; and then the sisters are watching to see what kind of dress that girl walked to the church with. And oh my god, I can't believe. And tell everybody on the way home, I can't believe that sister wore that dress. Well, mercy, what in the world does it matter? That thing's so tight she can't move without sinning. &gt;&gt; What was worse, the dress or your stinking rotten loveless attitude? &gt;&gt; That's right. words. Amen. In case you forgot, I don't mean to keep reminding you, but it keep seem like you keep forgetting it somehow. &gt;&gt; The attitude changes in a person like that. They go from being loving and accepting, opening their arms and opening up the borders and skirts of mercy &gt;&gt; to start becoming nitpicky as hard as they can nitpick everything they nitpick. I don't like this and I don't like that. The Bible said don't sit in the seat of the scornful. But if the love of God is missing out of that heart, that's exactly what you'll end up doing. Sitting in the seat of the scornful &gt;&gt; cuz we don't always get things like we wanted. &gt;&gt; Like take for example sitting in a little local church. It's hard for some people to uh to to open their heart to a revival in a local church. But but make no mistake, the best revival we can ever have is a local revival. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church still holds the power of having a local revival. &gt;&gt; But if we get cold indifference, &gt;&gt; somebody says, "Well, you know what? If I was to say to you, let's call a prayer meeting tonight and stay all night long and pray, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Already your minds go to a place. &gt;&gt; Well, I've got this thing and that thing and this is arranged and we got to be back to do this and &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that it's always expedient. I'm not saying that it's always the right way to do things, but with the love of God in our hearts, something should be inside us to say, "Perhaps maybe I could put that off and maybe make that prayer meeting if the Lord wants me there." &gt;&gt; See, I'm not saying that we'll instantly be agreeable, but there'll be an agreeable spirit within us. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God help me this right. That's the reason why when you go to the desert, you see that old sticker on the side of the cactus. There's no there's no water in it. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason people get so sticky in church. &gt;&gt; There's no love in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. You take some person coming to church, some girl standing there, she got toenail paint on or uh you know, her hair is trimmed on the bottom or some little thing, dressed shorter than it should be, you know, and tape message people how they behave when they see things like that. &gt;&gt; Instantly the word becomes a weapon. &gt;&gt; But you see, you don't know that person's backstory. &gt;&gt; That's right. And you don't know how many devils laid how many traps and they're succeeding in taking that precious soul and binding it up full of complexes and fears and anger and bitterness and everything else in the world. And if we as the people of God continue to weaponize the word, &gt;&gt; they'll never get saved &gt;&gt; nor delivered. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the minute they take a look at your attitude toward them, &gt;&gt; they're going to walk right straight out the church. &gt;&gt; And yet the statement is still true. The world is dying for love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They need it. &gt;&gt; And they need to see it out of us. &gt;&gt; Instead of pulling out a list of quotes, &gt;&gt; how about just good oldfashioned friendship? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's good preaching, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, listen to it again. &gt;&gt; Let me make sure I refresh your mind on this. He said, "That's right. Without these gifts in the center of love, it'll become selfish and indifferent." &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Pull itself off, isolate itself, fue. But when it's anchored in the middle of love, it'll be fellowship everywhere. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's exactly what we need. The church is dying for love, brother. &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on to my fourth point. Love working. Now, Romans chapter 5:E 5. If you got your Bible, I want you to look at this with me. Romans 5 and5. Now the Bible said, "And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us." Now this word he uses here is deep compassion. You see true love moves from the heart but compassion is doing the will of God. So some people think that love and compassion is just making excuses for everything. But love is corrective &gt;&gt; and true love wants to correct &gt;&gt; correctly [Music] &gt;&gt; not so they get up there and say why prophet said and one thing and the Bible said and I mean it &gt;&gt; but true love of God wants to approach the people with such a spirit such a feeling do yourself a favor if you think that I'm being hard on you tonight which I can tell some of you think I am when You go home tonight or tomorrow, whenever you get a chance to, go listen at it. 11762. Presuming Brother Brham has tore the hide off these people for 1 hour and 35 minutes. The hardest preaching you've ever heard in your life. And he is slamming the women for their hair and slamming the men for their attitude and slamming the church for getting cold. He is nailing them to the wall. &gt;&gt; He gets so hard it almost grieve you. But then at the very end of the service, he's praying and I know how he feels cuz I've been there many times. He said, "Father, it's so hard to cut and slay and whip and beat and things." He said, "You don't want to do that to the people." He said, "But they've got to see what's right." &gt;&gt; And the prophet knew that little church was beginning to backslide. &gt;&gt; He went in there with the love of God. And if you go listen at the end of it, person after person's up there praying, you can hear men crying out to God and different things like that. You see, the love of God corrects correctly. &gt;&gt; It don't just come in and just slap everybody in the head and say, "Straighten up." The love of God brings instruction. It brings a conviction. The compassion of doing the will of God brings that feeling where the Bible said like this that the godly sorrow in the heart works repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is this kind of love that touches the untouchable &gt;&gt; and heals the unhealable &gt;&gt; and it'll go farther than any gift. &gt;&gt; Cuz some people got that attitude in their mind. Glory to God. All they got to do is get in church and be preached, too. &gt;&gt; But when they go to church and hear preaching, what do they see after the preaching? Come on. &gt;&gt; Many times bunch of arrogant people walking around. Glory to God. We're in the message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're so holy with their nose in the air. If it if it rained, it'd drown them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Yet they claim they've got the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Great commission. The leper passed by with no arm and he said I took him in my arms and began to love him. He said the people said now brother Brandham don't you do that. He said but the world is dying for love brothers. &gt;&gt; He said he just wept when he saw somebody that cared. &gt;&gt; He said now you take your brother in your arms. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If doesn't make things a little different, he said the love that worked on that leper will also work on your brother that you think &gt;&gt; is wrong. &gt;&gt; We talk about divine healing as believers. &gt;&gt; But we talk about it from the aspect of someone, some great preacher again laying hands on somebody and somebody with great faith believing, "Oh my," and we testify, "Brother so and so prayed and glory to God." But do you realize the prophet of God said that God can heal an old grudge &gt;&gt; with just a little bit of love? &gt;&gt; You see Jesus, my flesh brother, my brother, called me today and he was telling me something the Lord had laid on his heart. Isaiah 53, he was wounded for our transgression. So forth and so on. He said, did you notice this? He said, he said, he was wounded. The chastisement of our peace was upon him for grief and sorrows. He said, "Did you notice those have nothing to do with eternal life?" &gt;&gt; I thought that was pretty good. &gt;&gt; I said, "That's right. That's temporary in this day." &gt;&gt; But someone with eternal life can become wounded, &gt;&gt; can grieve and have sorrows, &gt;&gt; and they want healing from almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they might have a little thing in their heart and they hold on to something. Hold on to something. Then all of a sudden they come to the prayer line and they pray out, "Oh God, oh God, I need deliverance." And then God will move and they'll scream and they'll run and they'll jump and they'll do all kinds of things. But really what they need is healing. &gt;&gt; And sometimes just a little old bit of love. &gt;&gt; Will heal a broken heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all thought I was going to preach this way tonight. You wouldn't have come, would you? &gt;&gt; Holy cow. There's a whole lot I could have streamed somebody better than this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't hide it. I can tell by seeing the looks on some of y'all's faces. This is burning some of you up. &gt;&gt; Really good. &gt;&gt; But it's good. Good. &gt;&gt; You know why it's good? Because God wants us to be right with him. &gt;&gt; Tell me I don't have I'm telling you what the Lord said in his word. &gt;&gt; Now, if it fits you, it fits you. If it don't, it don't. That's up to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The world. Now, think brother sees this leper come along &gt;&gt; and he hugs him. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. I heard a brother saying just the other day, he was in uh Africa, I think it was, or one of those places, and said, "Somebody had this real awful disease." And they'd warned him. Now, brother, you stay away from this woman now. She's real sick, and don't you get around her. She's real sick and on like that. And so, he said, the Holy Ghost had talked to him said the Lord was going to heal her. He said, I just pushed past the whole crowd and went up there and he said, I just put my arm around her like that and said, "Now, sister, God wants to heal you in the name of Jesus Christ." And prayed for her. them brothers were almost falling in the floor. Oh God, he's got that disease. &gt;&gt; God turned around and healed that woman. Why? Just a little bit of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I don't mean like he put his arm around her ungodly like he reached around like this to pray for cuz she's sitting in a wheelchair. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the very fact that he wasn't tainted or or or you know or marred or scarred by her being there, &gt;&gt; just a little love &gt;&gt; cause her to reach out and get a hold of divine healing. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I'm about to say something to you. I hope you're ready. &gt;&gt; How many spiritual lepers have we turned a blind eye to and walked beyond? &gt;&gt; Yeah. world &gt;&gt; because they were missing certain things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe they missed the right attitude. &gt;&gt; You know, dealing with family can be like that sometimes. You get amongst your own people and they got a rotten attitude and we almost want to cast them over to the devil. I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet of God said about a man woman that's in a fuss and a woman gets a little bad spirit on her? You know what brother said? Do go get her flowers and candy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not me, brother. I'm going to put my foot down and you'll do it for your last time one day. &gt;&gt; Cuz any woman worth her weight and salt ain't going to put up with no Hitler like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good preacher. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; There's many of our sisters gone and their bodies are still there. &gt;&gt; Their marriage is over, but they're still in the house. &gt;&gt; Why? the lack of love amongst the people. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Some of our big herculean men, some of our big strong men, some of you men wouldn't cry or you wouldn't tell somebody you loved him or you cared for them because that would make you less than a man. What makes you less than a man in the eyes of God is that you will not express love to those he gave to you expressively to love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can y'all hand a little bit more? &gt;&gt; First John chapter 4 verse 18 and 19. I didn't realize this was going to get so tough tonight, but here we are. &gt;&gt; I was convinced this is going to be one of them sugar sticks and candy canes and lollipop messages, but holy smokes, here we are. &gt;&gt; Woo! Preach Jesus. I'll say amen. 1 John 4 18 and 19. Now watch what John says. There is no fear in love. &gt;&gt; Why do we fear? &gt;&gt; Because somewhere along the way we just don't have the kind of confidence in God that we need. or somewhere our revelation of how he loves us is missing somewhere. [Music] &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Now, think of a time that you thought God should have blessed you, &gt;&gt; but he held it from you. &gt;&gt; How did you react to that? &gt;&gt; What was your attitude whenever you thought God should give you this certain job promotion, but then pulled your candlestick? &gt;&gt; Yeah. or wouldn't allow you to go up in management or wouldn't allow you to make that extra so much dollars. &gt;&gt; How did you react when you felt like the Lord took it from you? &gt;&gt; Or maybe some of you dealing and battling with a long time sickness and deep in your heart you start wondering, "Does God even care if I'm well?" &gt;&gt; Jesus. So, you know what happens, don't you? All of these things begin to cycle in our minds. &gt;&gt; And because we're just not sure what the will of God is about certain matters cuz he don't always tell us, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then we start questioning and those questions and doubts bring fear. will &gt;&gt; I just went through something here myself just earlier this week where I had a a situation some years ago that was just a very traumatic it was awful awful awful awful it's almost like a uh there was a a repeat scenario this week of a certain thing and it was almost like PTSD you know like the the soldiers that get that what brother used to call shell shocked &gt;&gt; and I was hyperventilating oh God the Lord just said to me settle down. &gt;&gt; It's not the same. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; But fear &gt;&gt; because there's a a gap in our understanding &gt;&gt; where we don't know between what happened and what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; That little empty place in between. Oh, and that's where the devil likes to work on you the most. &gt;&gt; Yay. Hath God said? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And before you know it, he's planted a bunch of doubts and fears and everything else in your heart, and you're wondering if God can even hear your prayer. &gt;&gt; But you know what fixes that? Love. &gt;&gt; Staying in love with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Staying in love with him to the point of saying, "God, I don't care what you put in my pathway. I don't care what hardship comes my way. I don't care if I'm sick every day of my life. I don't care if I struggle and I ain't got enough loonies to rub together for a hamburger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know he loves me. &gt;&gt; I love him and I know he will take care of me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If we keep that kind of spirit in our heart, what does it do? What does it do? Cast out fear. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you see he that because fear he says hath torment. He that fearth is not made perfect in love. That word perfect is mature, complete, mature. We love him because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; So a love that has reached full maturity will drive out all fear. Right? &gt;&gt; Because when the agape love of God moves into the bride of Christ, the fear of death, the fear of retribution, ah, that's a big one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I I'll say it like this. There's many of us, okay, me too, &gt;&gt; that have got a laundry list of things in our past that we knew were stupid when we did them. Amen. &gt;&gt; We remember them. &gt;&gt; We know they're there. &gt;&gt; Can still see the same hands that done it, the same mouth that said it, the same eyes that looked at it, the same ears that heard it, and the same feet that went to it. &gt;&gt; And then you come to church and you're going, "I'm so glad Jesus set me free. I'm so And the devil says, are you?" It could be something as simple as remember that scar on your arm, that little remember all them years you smoked, &gt;&gt; that little pain in your hip, remember when you was drunk and done such and such. &gt;&gt; And while you're sitting in the house of God, Satan is working right here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Trying to bring every accusation, trying to point your mind into that direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of what if? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the reason that God ain't healed you, the reason that God ain't touched you, you know the reason you ain't no better. God is getting even with you. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But the love of God &gt;&gt; takes that liar and says that is not the way my Lord treats me. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he corrects me, he's not correcting me because I'm some unruly thing that he likes taking pleasure and beating on and and making playing some trick on me or or some kind of a stunt on me. If if he corrects me, it's because I need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because I deserve it. &gt;&gt; There's a difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. God puts upon us what we need, &gt;&gt; not what we deserve. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If I got what I deserved, &gt;&gt; if you got what you deserve, you wouldn't even be sitting here tonight. &gt;&gt; But the grace and the love of Almighty God doesn't give me what I deserve. Brother Dell, he gives me what I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If I got what I deserved every time I deserved it, I would be a little greasy spot right down here. &gt;&gt; Not what I deserve, &gt;&gt; but what I need. &gt;&gt; You see, the love of God frames it. Brother Derson said, he puts it in my heart in the right way. I know &gt;&gt; that he's dealing with me as God dealeth with sons. &gt;&gt; Cuz God knows if I had to reap out every crop I ever sowed, &gt;&gt; but for the grace of God, it would send me away from the Lord, not to him. &gt;&gt; Let me go just a little bit further. Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1960. It wasn't so from the beginning. Love casts out fear, doesn't it, friends? The whole world is dying for love. &gt;&gt; That's one of the great things that we leave out of our Pentecostal blessing. Too much of it is love that mixes it together. Listen to this statement. The mortar that makes gifts and all the things operate of God perfectly in is love one for another. &gt;&gt; So it' be like if I walked out here and some of you that frame and do construction things, I put a bunch of blocks together and a bunch of wood and stuck them together, but I had no adhesive. &gt;&gt; I had no fasteners. &gt;&gt; I had no way to tie it together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First wind or storm or whatever, somebody bumped into it, over it would go. &gt;&gt; We've done that for 60 years now. We've built up our quotes. We built up our scriptures. We put our doctrinal points. We put our revelations, our understanding, and we framed it all together until it's this big, beautiful building. &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden, here comes the big bad devil. &gt;&gt; And the first trial he brings through the church, he huffs and he puffs and blows our house down. &gt;&gt; Why? We've got all the right material, &gt;&gt; but the love of God is the one that ties all of that. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Think about this a minute. of all the things that we've been taught in this message, everything that we know in the Bible, [Music] &gt;&gt; we could sit for days and discuss things that we've learned since we've been Christians. &gt;&gt; So, what are most churches focused on? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Church order, &gt;&gt; seals, &gt;&gt; the thunders, &gt;&gt; the revelations of God, &gt;&gt; all of that is wonderful. &gt;&gt; But if there's no love there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's nothing to hold it together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you have God saying certain things that will leave you completely without understanding. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; For example, take this day. I just went through the Parkview Junior High School series where Bram starts at the tabernacle with man running from the presence. And then uh he goes into um um the bonds woman can't be uh heir. The seed not with the shuck I think was the name of it. He goes on to Melzdc later after marriage and divorce. And as he's building up, you can tell from man running from the presence of the Lord that brother Rama is trying to build the confidence to go do what God's telling him to do. go back into the 50s and read the book where he said in the conduct, order and doctrine, he said, "If I was to take this Bible and preach marriage and divorce, it split up every church &gt;&gt; in the country." &gt;&gt; Could he have taken the book and thrown the book at these people for the way they were living &gt;&gt; and the way they were doing and how they were married? You better believe he could have. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But for 15 years, something, Listen close, &gt;&gt; don't miss this. Don't fail this. for 15 years. Something constrained him and held him &gt;&gt; until one day he was out in Arizona, a little place called Fanger Rock, and the Holy Ghost came down and told him because of misinterpreted theology, &gt;&gt; but go back and tell him, "Go in as you are, &gt;&gt; and teach your children not to do that thing again." &gt;&gt; What was it that held him &gt;&gt; from weaponizing the word? God in his love saw that many of his children had been told wrong. &gt;&gt; And their honest hearts and their true genuine faith was latching on to what was preached to them by people they thought were God's servants and God's children. &gt;&gt; And instead of brother Brand weaponizing the word, &gt;&gt; you see what a difference it makes when love's there. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a quotation. That's what's the matter with the churches today. These rickies and &gt;&gt; ricketettas. &gt;&gt; It only took brother Brandham somewhere around the period of a year before he started saying how the Lord spoke to him and said some of those are God's children. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Well, why didn't brother just go on with his attitude? Glory to God. I'm the prophet of God. They're wrong. The Bible said they're wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell them about it. What changed him? &gt;&gt; God's love. &gt;&gt; God's love in him. Because you can't give them a right, proper chance if you've already taken their final outworking into your hands. &gt;&gt; Calling them Ricky and Ricada made many of those people feel like there was no chance for them. &gt;&gt; That's why God dealt with him &gt;&gt; so that he could spread the skirts of mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To give him a chance. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Love is what done that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You go home with me and I go home with you. By the end of the day, you can pull the book on me and I can pull the book on you. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; But what keeps us from harboring feelings and things against one another? &gt;&gt; God's love. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's love to say mercy of God will not allow me &gt;&gt; to hold a sin against my brother &gt;&gt; and if he's overtaken in it. See the Bible didn't say if you see sin go tell him about it. The Bible said if he's overtaken in it &gt;&gt; cuz all of us are going to have sin in some point. &gt;&gt; Three eye blings, two head nods, one grunt. I heard somebody clear the throat a minute ago. Let's try it again. I'm I'm hoping you'll do a little bit better this time, but all of us are going to have sin at some point. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Bible said, "He that's born again does not commit sin." Same man turned right around and said, "And he that says he has no sin's a liar." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, sure, &gt;&gt; we could throw the book at one another right now, &gt;&gt; but the love of God in my heart for you and the love of God in your heart for me &gt;&gt; will not allow you to see wrong in me. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you won't see the mistakes, the errors. Maybe brother Ben needs to do something better. I get that. I get that. &gt;&gt; But love will cause you to reserve and hold your opinion. and pray for me &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; and hold me up before the Lord and then if you see me overtaken in something love will cause you to say brother Ben can I please talk to you just a minute I I think I can help you with something &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I I I always love the guys for me it's the guys believe me when I tell you women try it too but I'm glad it's the men I love it when they come up to me and say I want to correct you on something I know already right there. Uh-uh. No, sir. Uh-uh. We ain't talking. No. Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you see arrogance, &gt;&gt; you ain't going to help me when you're arrogant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you come to me and you've got love in your heart, &gt;&gt; brother, I want to share something with you. The Lord let me see something that I I hope maybe I might be wrong possibly, but I I want to talk to you about it in case maybe Satan's trying to do. I just want to be a friend to you. &gt;&gt; That's when you know &gt;&gt; that the love of God is moving in somebody's heart. &gt;&gt; We should correct our children that way, &gt;&gt; our grandchildren that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should correct the big kids that way. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The little kids that way. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we had more of that, this is what Jesus said. I'm closing right here. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples. &gt;&gt; Is that you have love one? &gt;&gt; Stand with me. This is what I call the true mark of the bride. Not perfection and knowledge, not eloquence, not gifts, but love. Love is the very nature of Christ in his people. And I've got a little note down here like this. When divine love returns to the church, not emotionalism, not just tolerance, but when God's holy love is born of the Holy Spirit in their hearts, the world will know that Jesus Christ is still alive in his bride. And if the world is dying for love, let that love be found in you tonight. &gt;&gt; Let it be found in your home. Let it be felt in every handshake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be seen in your forgiveness and your compassion. Because as brother Ram said here, the main spring of love operates everything else. &gt;&gt; This is not just a theory we live by. &gt;&gt; This is the life of God inside the heart of the elect. &gt;&gt; You see, friends, you may not understand maybe some of this hard preaching, and you don't understand me kind of knocking at it. There's a majority of you here that are 100% on board with me, but you think I can't feel that thing kicking against me while I'm up here under this anointing. &gt;&gt; Why do you think I'm I'm dealing with you the way I'm dealing with you? Why you think I'm preaching the way I'm preaching? Not to be hateful, but because the devil hates this. &gt;&gt; He knows that if the true church ever gets a true revelation and how he works in the framework of the church, that she'll be an invincible army. That's right. &gt;&gt; And one of the first things that Satan tries to take from the people &gt;&gt; is fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go back and listen to a little message called restoration of the bride tree. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said that when that palmer worm, that was the first one, I think, wasn't it? The palmer worm comes and started eating at the tree, you know, he said first thing he hit the leaves. &gt;&gt; He said what those leaves represent? Fellowship among the brethren. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isolate. Pull them off to the side. We're the only ones that's they're not right. We're right. &gt;&gt; How is it, friends, that brother Brandham to the very end of his life when people would draw him out, &gt;&gt; would take his gospel pencil and draw them back in. &gt;&gt; And yet we get all the way here 60 years later when we're supposed to be mature with this word &gt;&gt; and pencil. We've done thrown it in the in the pencil case and stuck it under the &gt;&gt; school desk many years ago. We don't draw no more. We don't pencil no more. &gt;&gt; We've decided we've got our own little circles and that's what we're going to run in. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; A pastor uh had left a certain church here some time ago and I was meeting with some of the officers and they were asking me questions and one brother said, "All I want to see is the clicks and things busted up amongst the churches." That's right. &gt;&gt; Real fellowship. I said it has to start at the top. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How in the world could we even have the good fellowship that we've had in here tonight? I've enjoyed the service tonight. &gt;&gt; I thought it's been wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. I agree with that. Not because I'm preaching it, because how the spirit of the Lord has just been so wonderful in here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. But how could we have ever had this kind of feeling if brother Dale and Brother Jose and these brethren hadn't felt in their heart, let's come together as brothers? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You remember many years ago, Jose, this area of Canada was one of the worst in the world for fellowship. Remember at the little old church there? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I called these brothers up on the platform and I said, "We have to separate these boundaries. We have to get away from these divisions and things." And all of us men stood on the platform and locked arms and promised before the people of God that we would link together. You know, that's been going on 15 years or so, and we're still doing it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there were men in that meeting that called me on the phone afterwards. I'm not linking arms with them bunch of devils. &gt;&gt; I said, "Then evidently, you don't want to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; We're all going and you're just going to have to accept we're going to be there if you plan on going, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had another fellow call me from that same meeting. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, I'm ashamed of you. I said, why? You should stand for what's right. Some of these guys had problems with interracial marriages and and and uh certain ways of how women dress, whether they had little fake nails on and just you just name it. That stuff was thrown in my face every time I even sat down. And I couldn't even hardly eat an ice cream cone without hearing something about some about mixed marriage or some other kind of stupid thing that they could not get off of. &gt;&gt; I got so sick to my stomach of it. I asked a man one time. I said, "Do you know anything about St. John 3:16?" &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son." &gt;&gt; I said, "If we miss that, we've missed the whole message." &gt;&gt; That's right. But I learned these many years later, I have learned when we lose the love of God, &gt;&gt; we weaponize the word, &gt;&gt; it becomes a gun that we turn on everybody that don't agree with us. &gt;&gt; And it's evidence that God's love has seeped out of our heart. It's cooled down the blowing of all of the, you know, people talk and they blow. &gt;&gt; That's why we call them blow hearts. [Laughter] That was all right. Write that down. I don't want to forget that one. I'm getting closer to 50. That happens more now than I remember it happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is what it will do. God's love, listen closely. I'm closing. God's love will restore the warmth of divine love to the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His His love, his real love will restore that warmth of divine love. You You may have it in you. You may have it, but if it's been cooled down by circumstances, cooled down by a bunch of things, &gt;&gt; you're not lost if it's still laying in there. &gt;&gt; And there's still time while God is here dealing with souls &gt;&gt; to get in the presence of the sen &gt;&gt; and let him warm up that old cold love that you've let wax cold for everybody. &gt;&gt; Bow your heads with me just a moment. And I want you to continue listening just a moment on the music if y'all don't mind. Just a moment. I I want you to think now. Every head bowed, please. Every eye closed. Now, I want you to think now all this that I preached to you tonight. If you're standing there this evening and this afternoon, I guess it would be, and you got some little thing in your heart, some old critical spirit, some old nitpicking thing, and you maybe you've been hurt and offended, and you've just gotten angry at the whole mess. I hope the reason you're here today is because someone like me gives you hope. I hope that's what I represent to this little portion of Canada. I hope that's the reason you saints come together and drive these distances to come hear me preach to you. I hope I represent a warmth and a love. I hope that I've been a a representative to you all these years as an evangelist. I hope I've represented before you a a a victory and a life and a gospel that can be attainable and that if you go past what you think is the point of no return, that doesn't mean God's done with you. I hope that's why you're sitting here this afternoon &gt;&gt; is because I trust I found favor with all of you. &gt;&gt; Well, if it be so, then you trust me as a servant of God tonight. I've preached this to you because the Lord told me to. Not because I have an axe to grind or because I'm trying to be mean or hateful, but because I feel like we're in a spirit in a time &gt;&gt; where the bride is getting ready to come into that capstone of love like she's never been seen or understood before in her whole life. &gt;&gt; And it is time, friends, to lay aside all of the foolishness, all of the silliness. &gt;&gt; Amen. all of the nonsense and the legalism and the overg grace, the too much grace people that just let everything go. It's time for us to get balanced back up in our heart. And the only way we're going to balance all the things moving around the little watch of life is if that main spring is moving properly. So, while you stand here before the Lord, would you just be willing to say, "Brother Ben, in my heart, I know that I've let these things cool me off. And the love I used to feel, it just isn't there anymore like it used to be. I'm colder than I've ever been. But I want to lay in the presence of the sun. I want to lay in his presence and be warmed up." Who feels like that in here? Would you raise your hand to the Lord and say, "Father, &gt;&gt; oh my, look at these hands going up everywhere. &gt;&gt; Oh my." Of course, I know the arrogant, the proud, the ones that feel like they've already arrived. Of course, they're going to feel like a message like this is just not, "Yeah, this isn't their speed." People will hear it on the internet or they'll come sitting a service like that and preaching like this don't even affect them anymore. Why? The love of God has gotten so cold until it's just dead or it was never there in the first place. One or the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So friends tonight, if you can feel that little tugging of the Holy Spirit in your heart, &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; that little something moving inside of you that says, "Get that criticism out of your heart. Quit being skeptical. Quit weaponizing my word. Quit turning that word against everybody that don't agree with you. Quit having that separation isolation type spirit, fussing and stewing. If you hear the Holy Spirit dealing with you like that, I wonder if you'd just step out of your seat and walk up here to the front. Just step out in this aisle and come and stand here and rededicate your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and say, "As of tonight, Lord, I'm going to be a brand new person starting right here tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who among us would like to be the first brave one to show in their testimony? I'm coming. I'm going to stand right up here in this front. I'm rededicating my life to the Lord. I'm done with this lifestyle. I'm done with this attitude. I'm done with this spirit like this. I want God I want Jesus to change me completely. &gt;&gt; God bless these folks. &gt;&gt; Who else wants to step out here on this aisle and come up and say, "I want to be a testimony. Now, it makes me wonder when you raised your hand, did you really mean it? Or were you just doing that to be nice? I mean, do you really want to get right with God? Why don't you come stand in this aisle and say, "Jesus, change me." &gt;&gt; There you go. That's That's the way. Who else would like to join these up here? There's a lot more hands that went up. &gt;&gt; Won't you put some footsteps on your testimony? Say, "God, I'm going to stand here tonight and rededicate myself to you." &gt;&gt; God bless each one of these coming. Be brave, friends. God don't want you to be a coward or be laidback with some kind of fear or something like that. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ben, if I go up here, everybody will see me. Fine. Fine. Let them see you. &gt;&gt; It just puts that much more pressure on you to be that much more sincere. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; if you mean business with God, God's going to mean business with you. Praise be to God. Somebody else that would just like to say, "I'm I'm done with this. I got to get this stuff out of my heart. It's been laying there too long and things are so out of sync in my life." Well, it's because that main spring ain't turning like it used to. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Anybody else would like to join this little group up here in the front? &gt;&gt; Let me linger just another minute or two in case the Lord's dealing with somebody's heart. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together all of us. &gt;&gt; Fatherless &gt;&gt; Lord for this little group that's gathered up here tonight Lord Jesus. Father, they don't come up here just for show. This is not just for a public demonstration of something, but Lord, your word sharp and cutting and right down between the soul and the spirit, between the marrows of the bone. Father, you've went right down into the very precious part of our heart and you've dealt with us expressingly. Now, Lord, these souls come before your presence, wanting, Lord Jesus, a great change in where they've been, that old critical thing or that skeptical thing or that weaponizing the word or isolation or whatever thing may be working on them. Lord, they've let hurts and pains and ills and betrayals and all those kind of things and disloyalty and what more? They've let it scar them and hurt them and blow upon their life until they become cold and wounded and scarred away from fellowship and religious actions that are necessary for a Christian such as brotherly love and fellowship. those religious, godly, true religious behaviors. They're not things, Lord, we put on because we're taught to do it. It should be the very nature of us. But Lord, the devil has tried to ransack these children of God's life. But Lord, we pray tonight the Holy Ghost will drive away every one of these evil things. And may the heat and the light of the Holy Spirit, may it come fall upon every heart, every life, every soul, every mind, every spirit. and may it drive away the coldness of this hour and may you warm their heart again in the love of God. If there be sin there, may you forgive them of it, Lord. If there be sickness, may you heal them of it. If there be a wound or a sore in their spirit, may you send the balm of Gilead to heal their spirit. Whatever it may be tonight, Lord Jesus, may the spirit of God move expressingly to every heart and every life. visit them right there where they're standing. Lord, we pray, Father, in the name of Jesus, I pray you'd bless every life. Father, there's ministers standing here, Lord, how they've been so betrayed and lied on and rebuked and everything else. But Lord, hear these brethren stand here as a testimony tonight. They're not going to allow this lady of seeing coldness to take the love of God out of their hearts. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. If that happens with the leaders, may it happen with the very smallest one among us here tonight. For every Zakius in his tree, for every Sarapheneician woman, for every rich young ruler, God, may your Holy Spirit come upon the scene and work in that heart, Lord, a work that only you can do. &gt;&gt; Grant it, my father, we pray and ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Would you just raise your hands up to the Lord with me and say, "Father, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for speaking to me. Thank you, Lord, for dealing with me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for having mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Thank you for letting me know you're not done with me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for letting me know I haven't gone too far, &gt;&gt; but your hand is still on me. Your grace is still on me. Your mercy is still with me. You're still leading and guiding. You've done everything you promised. You have not left me. You have not forsaken me. You're right by my side. I thank you tonight, Lord, for being an allsufficient God. I thank you tonight, Lord, for blessing the people of Canada. I thank you, Lord, for these repented hearts, for these tender spirits and souls that want to be blessed by the moving of the presence of God. May the Holy Ghost come into this place tonight, Lord, and drive away every evil thing. We thank you Lord for warming our hearts by the presence and the light of the sen of God. And may the Holy Ghost we pray continue to take our footsteps from here Lord. May we not fall into error. May we not fall into gross sin. Keep us Lord by your hand. &gt;&gt; Undergard us by your strength. May your mercy and your love support us and hold us up Lord. May the tenderness that we used to have as young Christians, may that sweetness that we used to have as believers when we first come to your truth when you first moved on our hearts, Lord, may that just enter back into our hearts now, Lord God. May all that old crusty thing, may that old attitude, that old nature, that old spirit, that old gotcha thing and get you thing and show you thing and make a point thing, may all of that be drove from us, Lord, tonight. May we come back to being like little children, &gt;&gt; tender and sweet, flexible and forgiving. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my Lord. Thank you, my Lord. &gt;&gt; How we bless your holy name. &gt;&gt; How we bless your holy name. Just help me love him now everybody. Just help me praise him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love you so much, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; We love you so much, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, this is the condition them old Pharisees and Sadducees got in &gt;&gt; when you showed up in human flesh. They were so critical. They were so crusty. They were so set in their ways. They couldn't see the very Lord of Life standing in human flesh. Oh, God. And our people are drawn to that very same thing. The hour has repeated itself to where modern-day Pharisees, Sadducees are standing in our churches with the same old attitude, the same old spirit. Oh, but God don't let that affect or overcome the little bride of Christ. May the spirit of the living God that purchased her for her his possession. Lord Jesus, may you open our eyes and illuminate our hearts to see the evils around us and not to be affected by it. Help us, Lord, to always keep your love &gt;&gt; first and center in our life and foremost. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; As your Bible tells us, people are going to get wicer. They'll get more evil. They'll get seducing spirits will be on the rise. &gt;&gt; Sin on every hand. But oh God, may the little bride be hid in your pavilion, &gt;&gt; covered over in the love of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, love of God. How rich and pure, [Music] how menless and strong. It shall forever more into [Music] the saint. and angels song. All love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong. It shall fall. [Music] song. I'll sing it one more time. Oh God, how rich you [Music] fall. more into the saint [Applause] shraise. [Music] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Just to show you this isn't just show for me here. About a month ago, I was at a certain event. It's a goth and there's a man that I'd known since I've been a boy several years ago betrayed me as a friend deeply. Hurt me very deeply. Literally just turned his back on me. And I forgive the man for what he done, of course, and how he did it. And I even understood why he was doing it on his part of it. Anyways, but somehow I just was so hurt and broken over that. I forgave him, but I just didn't seem I couldn't seem to get over it. I was going up the aisle and I looked down that way. mind. I can see the back of his head and I thought I ain't getting into that. I walked out the building, went all the way around the other side to avoid him. And I got in the car and went back to the house and seemed like the Lord was dealing with me half the night. I could hear brother Brown when he came that message while we're in our denomination. He said some of them Christians said they passed the other side of the street and went up wouldn't even look them that way. And I thought, yeah, even though I could stand with every right, justify everything that I felt, God dealt with me. You think I'd have done it that way? How do you think I would have acted if I saw that same man? Next day went back to this thing and I was walking up been several hours and I was walking up a certain place and my daughter was standing there next to me. She said, "Oh, daddy, there's that man." I could hear Brother Bram talking about when he told that lie. When they called the next day, Joseph said, "Daddy, you want me to tell him you're gone?" or something like he said, "See how sin corrupts?" My middle daughter said to me, "There's that man again." And I said, "Not this time." I went straight up to him and I got him around the neck and I hugged him. He looked at me. He said, "I've missed you." So, I missed you, too. You know, the minute I did that, that thing went carried it a long time now. But this is what I'm talking about. the purest among us, the most just among us. You can have the purest of motives, the purest of ideas, but the love of God will take you farther &gt;&gt; than even what you yourself want to go. And this is what brother Bram said, live for the man that would kill you. He said, that's real love. He said, ' Because if you can live for that guy, listen to these words. He said, you're staring heaven right in the face. [Music] So if we don't have this in our heart, when Jesus comes to take us out of here and the rapture, resurrection takes place, if we don't have it, we'll be left sitting right here &gt;&gt; with all of our excuses, with all of our justifications, with all of our reasons why we're right. the last year and this year especially, the Lord's really been dealing with me because I realize age-wise, I'm kind of at a spot now. I said to a young man the other day, I said, I can't I told him, I cannot believe I'm getting ready to say this to you, but I am old enough to be your daddy. I never thought I'd ever reach a place in my life in words that ever come out of my mouth, but God's been dealing with me. I looked at it the other day. I'm 14 years from my s first social security check. Okay? If I go another 20 years, I'll be 68. That's just 20 short years. The prophet said like a little buzzer goes off in you. And I thought, I'm at that point in my life where I'm going to have to be more serious about anything I've ever said or preached or done &gt;&gt; than I've ever been in my life because you'll blink your eyes and you'll be standing there nearing 70 and knocking on 75 and 80. My mother turned 89 this year. Time don't stop for nobody, but the hour is drawing close, friends. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've got to have this in our heart &gt;&gt; or we won't go when Jesus comes to kid us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, &gt;&gt; don't let it stop here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feed it. &gt;&gt; Feed it the word. And when that old thing comes back to you, that old memory or that old feeling, something comes back to you and says, "I remember when that guy done that." Just kick it out of your mind and say, &gt;&gt; "I might remember it, but the love of God will not." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And just throw your hands up and say, "Lord, fill me so much with your love until I can heal the unhealable, save the unsavable, and reach the unreachable." Because God only has one pair of hands in this day, and that's yours. And we're the only ones that can reach a dying world. &gt;&gt; And the world is dying for love. &gt;&gt; Where are they going to see it? &gt;&gt; In us. &gt;&gt; How rich and pure, how meless. and strong. It shall [Music] endure the saint and just one more time with all your hearts. Oh god. [Music] Yes. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Saint [Music] Amen. Amen. Just uh ask brother Ben just to see God in our midst. [Music] Now, the home church knows where I'm going. Brother Brandon, did I tell you what I was preaching on? &gt;&gt; Did I send you any quotes? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did I send you any verses? &gt;&gt; None. &gt;&gt; In the last 6 months? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Probably 10? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Nothing. &gt;&gt; I preached five services ago on compassion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was eternal life by a pagan believer that by religion was pagan. And because of compassion and the good Samaritan got eternal life. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I never preached seriousness. I preached four messages in a row on love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I read every scripture, every quote. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everything that I could find in four scriptures. And this last Sunday, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said, "If God will give me enough grace, I'm going to change the topic." And God had a sense of humor and came and preached on it again. Hallelujah. Love. Amen. You know, brother Bam said the evidence of the Holy Spirit the first time he said it was love. &gt;&gt; And then he said God his revelation grew and he said it was the revelation of the word for your day which is still love. &gt;&gt; And the definition of God, God was the word and it was love. This message is love. And you know when the woman came and washed Jesus' feet in the cinnamon's house and she had much sin and cinnamon thought Jesus shouldn't have been letting her wash her feet. He said, "Because those that are much forgiven are able to love much &gt;&gt; much much love." Amazing love. You know, you know, and we're just clo I what an amazing God we serve. Amen. You know, I just, you know, we should never ever ever judge anybody. &gt;&gt; I have no right to judge anybody. 64 quote. God said that all the people were were money in God's pocket. And he said all the he said don't kick them out. He said even if they can't believe the truth, God uses pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters and silver dollars. He said Lot was a penny and Abraham was a silver dollar. He also said in drawing the circle of the message, and I know this is rerun for the home church, but it was about a man that was on the pulpit that had a trinitarian baptism. And brother Bam said he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they were going to exclude Brother Bam from the things. And he said, "If you think you're right and all the denominations and all the other people are wrong," &gt;&gt; this is how he said it. He said, "That's the poison breath of Satan." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because, and he finished it because how do you know you message believers that when you get there, you might have been believing it just a little bit different &gt;&gt; than what God intended you to see it? And that'll make you just bow your head and say, "Oh, Lord God, &gt;&gt; oh Lord God. &gt;&gt; I'm just pointing all the fingers at me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to point them at anybody. Just point them at me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God uses lots of people. Lots of people that I've judged in the past. God's used &gt;&gt; lots of people. Just leave it alone. God's got a whole family, a whole flower garden. You just love them. Love, love, love. Love covers a multitude &gt;&gt; of sin. It was love that held them on the cross that paid for my sins. Don't worry about your kids' sins. Just love them. &gt;&gt; Love them. &gt;&gt; Love will take care of their sins. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember Job? Job's kids were saved because of Job's sacrifice for his kids as per chance. &gt;&gt; Love, love covers them all to just look the other way in love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a lot I I I it hurts me, Lord, but love. I don't agree with it, but love. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's amazing. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's sing. song. More than ever before, Lord, I love you. Amen. With some fellowship after. More than ever before, Lord, I love you. More than ever before, Lord, I need you. And more than ever before, I want you to tell you I love you now.
