[58:41] this great time amen this end time here
[58:45] and the thought I want to share this
[58:47] morning
[58:48] is follow the anointing to the full age
[58:52] amen amen follow the anointing to the
[58:56] full
[58:59] age to the age of maturity amen if we
[59:04] notice that the word says that the
[59:07] Apostle teaches he said have your senses
[59:11] not sense but
[59:14] senses we remember we know in the
[59:17] message of prophet thought us about the
[59:19] six
[59:21] sense which is the super
[59:24] sense all right yes sir which is the
[59:27] super
[59:28] sense but Paul the Apostle now is not
[59:32] refering to the super sense no sir
[59:35] because it is in the same book that he
[59:38] would have read for chapter
[59:40] 11 about faith and the great warriors
[59:44] that gone before about faith amen have
[59:49] you ever wondered and excited how
[59:53] he excited how he put sister Raab yes
[59:58] brother in the Hall of Faith amen Amen
[1:00:01] brother think about it yes my sister
[1:00:04] they
[1:00:05] have had her name in the book of Faith
[1:00:09] that's powerful is that right glory to
[1:00:12] God you I call her
[1:00:16] sister because she has been
[1:00:19] transformed she was a seed of God the
[1:00:24] foundation sometimes the to our to our
[1:00:28] full age have been messy right cannot be
[1:00:32] even talked about right many many of us
[1:00:34] don't even like to remember how
[1:00:36] pass is that
[1:00:38] right you don't become sheep you are
[1:00:42] sheep GL only Abraham seed can receive
[1:00:46] the Holy Ghost so you don't become seed
[1:00:49] you are seed already but you come to
[1:00:52] full age the full age the age of
[1:00:55] understanding
[1:00:57] and so he never says you're going to
[1:01:00] express the gifts of the Spirit no but
[1:01:04] he says your
[1:01:07] senses the five senses right see hear
[1:01:11] smell tasting and
[1:01:13] feeling the natural senses he was
[1:01:16] refering to here exercise your
[1:01:21] senses right Hallelujah glory to God
[1:01:24] Amen mhm
[1:01:27] it's interesting when you exercise
[1:01:30] something or someone you train them yes
[1:01:34] amen right you are forging them to
[1:01:37] another level Amen brother amen to God
[1:01:41] Amen so he says in the at the full age
[1:01:47] the age of
[1:01:49] maturity you at that level you are able
[1:01:53] to train amen you are senses yes to a
[1:01:58] level of discernment amen amen there you
[1:02:02] go amen wow
[1:02:05] amen yet the Apostle Paul says in 1
[1:02:09] Corinthians
[1:02:12] 2:14 the natural man yes cannot amen
[1:02:17] receive the things of the spirit of Amen
[1:02:21] neither can he know them because they
[1:02:23] are foolishness on Amen they are
[1:02:27] spiritually
[1:02:28] deserved so it's impossible for us to
[1:02:32] train our natural senses to receive the
[1:02:36] things of the spirit because that will
[1:02:38] be contrary to the Worden amen
[1:02:40] hallelujah amen you remember the prophet
[1:02:43] says he said this is an unbeliever amen
[1:02:46] to God this is an
[1:02:49] unbeliever oh Hallelujah so he had to be
[1:02:52] converted now as long as you are here
[1:02:55] this let is still an unbeliever right so
[1:02:58] you get up in the morning this morning
[1:03:00] says I've got to be in Fellowship yes
[1:03:02] but the unbeliever says I'm tired
[1:03:07] yeah the unbeliever said my back is
[1:03:12] hurting right Glory but the believer on
[1:03:15] the inside said I've got to go to
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:19] church so there was always a war a
[1:03:21] battle between the believer and the
[1:03:24] unbeliever amen
[1:03:26] amen pre that's right morning the
[1:03:30] unbeliever is tired yes but on Monday
[1:03:33] morning to go to work the unbeliever
[1:03:36] gets
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:41] well so you cannot have you cannot put
[1:03:44] your trust in on the unbeliever you put
[1:03:47] your trust in The
[1:03:48] Believer the glory am the spirit
[1:03:54] man Hallelujah
[1:03:56] like it you see that and so what you do
[1:04:00] in training your senses is to
[1:04:04] produce what the spirit will accept
[1:04:08] amen amen not you cannot train let me
[1:04:12] say this again I want everybody to be on
[1:04:14] the same page with me you cannot train
[1:04:17] because the word exercise mean train you
[1:04:19] cannot train your senses to receive the
[1:04:21] things of the spirit
[1:04:23] amen it's impossible amen yeah yeah but
[1:04:26] you train your senses to produce what
[1:04:31] the spirit will
[1:04:37] accept you see glory to God it's no this
[1:04:42] starts and just to pile a few that we
