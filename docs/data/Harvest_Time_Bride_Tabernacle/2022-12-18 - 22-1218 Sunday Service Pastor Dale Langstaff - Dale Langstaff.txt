here friends people that love you Lord Jesus sacrifice their life died out to themselves surrender to you Lord Jesus we praise you thank you for it in your beautiful name we pray amen amen God bless you all this morning amen it's awesome to be here this morning we're just going to go to our scripture right away just continue to pray for our trip to Uganda just things change almost weekly on that amen and just uh also me and my wife are to meet brother Ben later today and making more plans to for Uganda and we had plans to meet him yesterday and the states got pounded with the snowstorm he was like four or five hours late at least amen hard to believe we got green grass but amen but God knows everything amen and just read our scripture we're going to turn to Isaiah 7 and 14 and I was reading wearing my my dad should go this morning I woke up this morning thinking of Dad amen if you had a Godly dad man which many of us did or have like I had you're very blessed this morning man just many things in our life Satan tries to slip away on us you know I remember my dad I never I never remember my dad without family altar ever breakfast was family author after breakfast the day never started without spinning around and praying at your chair how many of us you know God forgive me help me it didn't matter if he was combined in a hundred thousand dollars worth of crop that day after breakfast he had family altar period and it was known at our house when you come in if you heard people praying you waited at the stairs before the door was opened we didn't stop Finley altar for anybody those were Godly men but were Godly men God help us amen amen amen I want to God wants to preach this morning on his plan and this was just beautiful you know when the prophet when I seen the quote on the prophet he said when he caught the revelation of this well I'll read it to you but he just lost his mind worshiping God it was just beautiful amen and therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign and behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel let's turn to Matthew 1 Matthew 1 and 19. now this was given in Prophecy approach 800 and some years before Christ gained Matthew 1 19 then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take thy unto thee Mary thy wife for thou which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a key part here and she shall bear forth a son and thou shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins and now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets what we just read earlier and behold a virgin shall conceive it shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emmanuel being interpreted God with us Lord Jesus we ask that you just said the blessing to your word this morning and your beautiful name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning I just find it hard to work all chained up amen amen you know we want to look in the scriptures this morning and we want to look into and and my uh where did I put my my title was living in the thoughts or the mind of God living or being in the thoughts in mind of God and we know it in the scriptures in the Old Testament that you know when the uh the ark of the covenant was around they God had put guards around the ark and we know that in Revelations that John said what those guards were and Revelations 4 7-10 he talks about what these guards were and they were the the four beasts amen there were the lion the calf the man and the flying eagle and they were on all the four sides of the Tabernacle to protect the holies of holies amen but now in the New Testament God has that she's going to help me this morning God has a God has a new testament and Covenant and it is still guarded this morning and you know I want it before we maybe go into that and just explain that I want to show you that most people misinterpret the guardian there's people that have come to this church and have walked out of this church are not here this morning because they've misinterpreted the guardian now if you know the Bible says and we'll have that scripture and we'll read it later if you know to do right and don't do it it's iniquity I'm bad but the guardian of the temple and the whole plan that Christ came in a in a little babe was to us in the mind of God the Plan of Redemption it was Grace to us it was Grace to the world I said let me rephrase it like this it was Grace to those that would accept it there that's more true and so God put guards around this and you know men have brought this and you know the word of God himself is is Grace you can look at all the different spots of the guards see God knows what you need to do to go through and so he put it in his word and that was Grace and people walk away from it on a daily basis others and this goes straight to damnation amen straight to damnation every example in the Bible that that you know you whether you're comfortable with or not comfortable with God put it there and it was Grace it was for your own good God knew what it would take you to go through and Satan is a liar and Sly this morning I want to tell you there's something I I just recently seen something actually it was this morning God knows what he's doing God knew what I was going to minister and I want to tell you how Sly The Devil is this morning you know when our co-works they re-identified the definition of a woman now that's not a surprise to you maybe but the at the end when they were doing it the judge refused to identify a woman yeah she gave a reason but we'll save the reason I want to show you the spirit behind us you know me and my wife and many of you here know people that walked away from Grace the word of God and one generation they were right where the courts are today do you know I have relatives through marriage and relative blood relatives that have kids that are gay and lesbians and it was only their parents that the women started wearing pants if I came here this morning and I had a dress on and I was wearing my wife's glasses you would know that there was something mentally wrong up here mentally wrong and yet you know in the Free Methodist Church when I was born my birth was when they voted for women to wear pants my dad helped build the Holiness Church was when when the Free Methodist people voted to wear wedding bands cut their hair and wear pants and those people's children are gay and lesbians this morning I'll read you the quote where the Prophet said that God made man a man and he gave Matt a dress in the Bible and if you're a woman this morning and you're wearing pants whatever your excuses your kids will be gay and lesbians amen it's Grace you call it freedom World calls it Freedom it's Grace the very people that voted for the women to wear pants their kids are gay and lesbians I could name the names every one of my kids would know who they are you come to me after off the line I'll tell you definitely who they are there's Christmas parties that are not happening to this this year because the parents are my age and their kids are getting lesbians amen don't think the devil don't know what he's doing let me read the quote for you just and I ain't proud I don't know where this came from but I'm not preaching on this the prophet warned us of this watch us and Satan's eating and the prophet said notice this and this perverse generation it was man it became from man to woman and from woman to man and don't know it the very product of Satan's Eden and if you'll watch it in the streets today that's our modern people okay now watch I'm going to finish this quote same one drops down another paragraph said God made man a man and he made woman a woman and God gave them different dress hello do you know what every country of the world I might not go and understand their language but when I get off the airport and I landed The Layover they have a dress for a woman and a path for a man and they're speaking every language in the world it's called that International Airport and watch what he finishes here and he said God dressed some different and he meant for them to stay that way and act that way what is the feminist Spirit and the other is masculine and he separated Adam in the garden and he did this and separated them since Satan's eat them and you know when you look at Grace Jesus coming in flesh was Grace Jesus coming being born of a Virgin Mary was Grace but Jesus given us his word was Grace it was Grace now for all those ridiculous people that say they say you can't wear a dress over pants amen you're ridiculous because if you're wearing underwear this morning it's pads the our Prophet called Grandma's underwear shorts but if you're a lady you have a dress over your sharks amen so we're balanced if it's minus 40 degrees and you're going to freeze to death and you're going horseback riding or you have to work for a living outside women are going to wear pants but you'll put a dress over it your outerwear will be addressed or your kids will be gay and lesbians you come to me after I'll give you two examples everyone you know very well within 45 minutes Drive of this church amen you see all these things the fivefold ministry was Grace for us all these things I'm going to give you an example next week of a of uh of an example in the Bible you know of an example where the man had sinned and he tried to hide it and God brought him Grace and he refused to Grace and nothing but the grace of God he changed his mind and accepted to Grace and was saved I don't think we'll get there today but all these things are Grace Deuteronomy 22 5 what we wear is Grace amen Hebrews 12 14 without Holiness is Grace amen Malachi 4 5 is Grace I'll send you Elijah the prophet's Grace to us amen and we see that in our day we're not in the Old Testament age and The Mercy Seat is not guarded by the four beasts this morning but I want to show you what's guarded by and I I get off on that side lane but I want to I want to nail down what Grace is Grace is not getting your own way Grace is the word of God amen your people say well I I say well what about this part of the Bible and they say well I don't you know God don't see that in me that's that refuse Grace amen I still refuse Grace and that's what the world's done and that's why they're in the state that they're in and he said you know here The Mercy Seat was guarded in the Old Testament by the Beast but today it's guarded differently oh it's beautiful this is where the problem let me read what the prophet said he said I was sitting the other day and I saw this and he said I jumped up and ran around and around and around my chair and I was saying Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory to God going around and around my chair it was God's grace to us that we've seen in the word where it says to get to heaven you must be to be a child of God you must do Man Without Holiness no man will see God it's Abomination for women to whatever those pertaining to a man and a man to wear with a woman Grace you know I heard a minister just recently you know what when the when the when the feminist Spirit cut their hair off it was immediately after that God took their husbands and their sons to kill them in World War one and two Grace Grace how could the world Miss Grace you know our Prophet said that everything that god Jehovah could have done to save the world he did and he came and his own received them not I want to read you this quote in Revelations 61 where the Prophet preached on Revelations and he said now we're living in another age Glory I love the seeds don't you now God has a mercy seat today see he had a mercy seat in the Old Testament and the priest would go in once a year and take this the sins of the people and get forgiveness and the holy of holies okay but today we're living in a new age don't you love this age now God has the same Mercy Seat two and it's guarded today do you believe that where is The Mercy Seat found today now this is what the prophet jumped up and ran around his chair singing Glory Glory Glory losing his mind where's The Mercy Seat found today The Mercy Seat is found in your heart and in my heart where did it come to but in the heart of men see it was when the Holy Ghost was given it was God and what did it do the Holy Ghost it came into the heart of men this is paragraph 323. if you want this after in Revelations is I right he said now let's mark it down here he said get ready to draw it out he said The Mercy Seat is the Holy Ghost Grace put in your heart and mind there's Grace here as long as there's the bride of Christ Holy Ghost filled Believers on Earth it's Grace you say well it's it's here because you're packing it okay do you know our Prophet said that on road rage that how you would respond or to something like that could affect that person's eternal destination that's your grace to the world amen but so many times when people have been given Grace and showed Grace in the word of God they've just turned it down just turned it down God help them amen see so all right guarding The Mercy Seat today now God has he hasn't got the same guards as The Mercy Seat today but it's in the hearts of men oh man with the Holy Ghost and then he goes into that paragraph where he's seen it and he got blessed amen now you see in the in the in the Bible God the prophet used another example for guarding the The Mercy Seat he said The Mercy Seat was the four Gospels and the four gospels were guarding knacks which was where the Holy Ghost came through in the Bible ain't that beautiful this morning so you see three types in the Bible we see the old Tabernacle where the holy holies was and God had the four beasts around the Tabernacle guarding it and then when Jehovah himself came and this day the perfect sacrifice where it wasn't just a covering of sin but it actually took the sin away he wrote all about it in the gospels in the New Testament Matthew Mark Luke and John and then acts came and he and the day of Pentecost which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Grace was planted in the heart of the Bride oh it's beautiful this morning you are walking Grace when you go in the grocery store and somebody looks at you this morning they're looking at Grace oh man if you could just comprehend this and [Music] concerns when you see g64 this is well after the seals here in God's life it's eternal life the hearing in paragraph the 12v cycle of God is life eternal life in the beginning now we know we know that if you got the Holy Ghost and you're going to heaven if you've got eternal life you always were Eternal amen and see why you can Pike Grace this morning is God was Grace God came in grace to the world and if you are part of God and you were in God's loins you have the same character as God because you're the same genus God and so you are little you you are like your daddy God grace he said God you know we we know this and we've been taught this but we'll go into this a bit you know before God was God he was despaired he was an Elohim it was the logos and he had many attributes now I want to read this he said you know God is life eternal life in the beginning was God and he said no just I'm reading from the prophet he said he wasn't God at that time because God in the English means an object of worship so there was nothing but him that's a paradox it's beautiful when you get it he wasn't God but he was God he wasn't nothing but he was something oh it's beautiful see God always was and there wasn't nothing but him and he was eternal just Eternal one and there was no moon and there was no stars there was no Angels there was no nothing but at in this beginning we called him God the Father and he had all these attributes in him let me go into this and he mentions all these attributes but see these attributes if you're eternal if you're going to heaven you know in John 13 it says no man goes send up to heaven but first he came down from heaven first you're not going to be Eternal unless you always were eternal and the only one that was eternal was the logos of God the spirit of God said in them had all these attributes but there was nothing but him and me and you Say Amen because I was there see what he was having these thoughts I was that what do you have on the cross I was there when he came as a baby in the manger I was there oh that's beautiful when they spit on him I was there you know the Bible says these things say blessed are you if you're persecuted for my name's sake for they stoned the prophets and killed me praise God I had somebody at a Christmas party said I heard a lot of negative think about you praise God I said I'm in good company wow I'm in good company if somebody comes up and says I heard a lot of negative about you say I'm good good company they stoned the prophets and they killed Jesus they sown the prophets and they killed Jesus they called him about the devil chief of the devils that the devil was casting out the Devils they thought he was born before marriage he said you heard a lot of bad things about me oh praise God they said the same thing about Christ oh my recognize the spirit who persecutes the bride Lucifer amen he had all these attributes he had a night no remember he was just him but he wasn't nothing but I was there it was him and me and him and you but we ran him but we weren't recognized but we were in his loins oh my you're you're far too quiet this morning and it is these attributes to be a father and in him was the attribute to be God wow he wanted to be more he don't want quiet worship enema is the attribute to be a son he wanted to be Christ he wanted to be Jesus in him was the attribute to be our savior oh thank you Lord and it was the attribute to be my healer oh hallelujah thank you Lord and then it was all these things that we see now just displaying his attributes let me just tell you something now if you were in him you'll display those exact same attributes amen and those are those exact same attributes will be displayed until Christ comes and takes us home the bride the Holy Ghost filled people and the rapture oh my now if you ever think in the beginning that if you had eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and eternal life had no beginning and it has no any and so if you have eternal life you were always you were an attribute of God thinking before there was anything but him oh I love the prophet man he's a he's a good man it's just good food your form your shape and what you are now it is just a negative of the positive Hallelujah this ain't the real me I have a theophany waiting for me and when you come up around 20 22 years eggs you're just a negative then death develops in the picture and death develops a picture to the positive when you're in your Prime he's talking about being 20 and 22. but then when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting for us and this just displays and now shows what God done let God be in God and he created the angels and the sons in Christ Jesus and he became a savior when Jesus died I want to tell you something this morning this is I don't mean that I'm going to finish this quote but what's you know God God help me God help me and God help us you cannot change the world but you can change the world you can change the world from yourself you can say like they said in the Bible for me and my house I'll serve the Lord for me and my house I won't do that you know I was out in the restaurant the one time and and somebody was talking I said I won't I'm not going there I won't go there with you well he was discussing something that was undiscussable because see the Bible warns us it's Grace that's not my anointed that's Holy Ghost filled people that's not ministers I do my prophets no harm no that's Ministry that's Grace you know the prophet talks about people that came against this ministry they didn't end well for them because see they didn't listen to Grace anybody that won't listen to this grace that's why the wrath of God when it comes will be so fierce because he showed it and you refused to amen wow so we will portray these same attributes I I started to say he said what spirit is it that somebody's trying to do something for God and somebody will beat them down what spirit is that I don't care what any one of yous do if it's for the kingdom of God do and better and further the kingdom of God if it's a sister being a Sunday school teacher or singing a special or playing the piano or cooking me a pie or something on this oh well that's it they're doing that another system can do that a lot better huh amen that never came from Christ see when the disciples came to Christ and they said we've seen some people casting out devils and demons but we didn't recognize them and they didn't go to our church and they definitely didn't go to our cemetery and so we stopped them we didn't think they were qualified whoa and Grace said what if they're on our side you did what you know I read quotes the other day and studying and preaching you know it our prophet was amazing he asked some questions and answers they said should we ever attend a church that don't teach the message that you teach I'd like to read you that quote but I don't have it in front of me it's on my iPad it'll shocked you what he said I'll just paraphrase it said questions and answers in 64. it's the first message of questions and answers and it's right before he talks about the uh the the gifts and going to the two prophets and 144 000 right before Pentecost before we leave the service it's way down it's about 350 paragraph or something I haven't memorized he says 100 should you ever go to a church that don't teach the message that the prophets 100 percent he said most definitely he said go and get all you can he said if they just believe that Jesus was the Christ then take that and leave the rest see by you go and you can be a really bright light you could be a really bright light and maybe they didn't read this today but they'll see this and you they might be in sin in many areas I can give that quote to you to my I won't have to search for it I've already got a picture of it yeah I said take what the truth is and just he said no he did say don't join me man the attributes of Christ see not all Israel's Israel and not all this Brides bride and the brideless bride will not be fighting the bride and that also the bride this Pride they won't be worried about the ones that didn't get Grace they'll be trying to show Grace to them but they won't be trying to cram it down their throat you know why there's a very simple reason because Christ never crammed it down your throat he gave you free choice he showed it to you and he showed it to you and he brought brother Matt by your way and brother Jared and brother Evans and brother uh Bernard and Vanessa and sister they brought all these people out he showed it he said oh this is so pretty look at their dress but he didn't force him he made you a free moral agent that if you really didn't want Grace how do you explain that the U.S government had to explain that when the man that they were offered part into and the president parted them and the guy brought it back and it wasn't on a stamp you know letterhead from the government and he brought it back and he said you're mocking me for I'm going to give my life for running in the army from the soldiers and they went ahead and killed them and he had a pardon from the president they come up and they had to make a ruling they said apart is only a parted if you'll accept it see Deuteronomy 22 5 where it talks about dress it won't do you one bit of good if you don't accept it you know Hebrews 12 14 without Holiness no matter we'll do you one bit of good if you don't want holiness Malachi four five six and five five and six God will send Elijah to the prophet to reveal all the secrets wow still laying stuff right there wow Matt Lacroix wow that guy must have knew him sister Patty oh before the foundation of the world unbelievable won't do you one bit ago if you come with that and they said what are you trying to mock me for what are you trying to mind wow here let's finish this quotes and all these things and attributes that God had was just so that in the end the Bible would say Jesus said now you will know that I am of the father and the father is in me it's Jesus talking and you is in me and I in the father and it's a god becoming triangle oh it's beautiful your own wife you and your husband is just a shadow to the negativity to the the shadow a negative picture of God and his wife the church oh my god wow see all of you that have an unbelievable not go to the park perfect marriage it's just a shadow of the perfect marriage between God Christ Jesus and the bride oh thank you Lord and see it's just God's attributes displaying in Shadows and types like the Old Testament was talking to you oh isn't it wonderful hey man here's another one he says the word Hebrew was Elohim all sufficient one to self-exist the one the strong one and him was the attributes to be a father and then him the attributes to be a son the Savior and the attributes to be Healer not to be a god this is just another quote amen and there's nothing and there was nothing but God and God Alone God God you're either a hundred percent God this morning for your loss no wow you see the scripture here let's go to Acts 2. Acts 2 36 and we'll just see it here here it was Grace to the world and we know these great scriptures let's go to 36 therefore let the house of Israel know us surely that that God with that has made Jesus whom ye have crucified both lowered and Christ and drop down to 38 and Peter said these great words well we go 37 and now they heard this and they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do and Peter said those words he said unto them repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you know this gift all started when Christ came in a major it all started well I mean it started before in the mind of God but it was in process when Jesus came the gift of the Holy Ghost and This Promise is unto you and to your children and to all that is afar off even in Wyoming to as many as the Lord thy God called and many other words today testify and exhort saying save yourself from this toward untoward generation and gladly they received the word and gladly and gladly they weren't force-fed and gladly they received the word of God and were baptized and the same day was added to the church about them three thousand wow mad Grace you see here here John explaining how Grace was portrayed let's go to John 16 and just laying more laying more down for us see Christ couldn't stay here In the Flesh you know brother Ben NORAD typed it so beautiful like yes Jesus came and and he and the great thing was he came to die on a cross and pay the sins for me but there was something really great that happened even before that just actually very great he became me he became flesh see God became a man and so he could understand you before he even paid the price for you he had to know you oh it's beautiful John 16 6 and even five he said but now I go my way five he said but now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asked me whether I go with C watch this as long as Christ was here as long as Jesus was here and obeyed and grew up in a teenager and a boy he was only in that form in that form he was only wherever he was so good things happen where he was in that form but where he wasn't he wasn't in that form now we know you couldn't put all of God in that body that's not possible so God was other places but in the form of Christ in flesh he could only be one place it was wherever he walked good things happen and then Jesus explains this to the disciples he said and six section six but but because I have said these things unto you sorrow has filled your heart nevertheless I tell you the truth that it is expedient for you that I go away they're like no it is expedient that I go away for if I go not away then you the comforter will not come but now that I'm going away then watch this oh watch this now you are the comforter and you are the comforter and you are the comforter and you are the governor you and you and you you you you and so you're a whole bunch of places now but before that he wasn't there oh my you see that John 16. John 16 7. nevertheless I tell you it's expedient I must go quickly for you that if I go away for if I go not away the comforter it won't come but if I depart you got that up there I will send him to you to you and those that are all afar off and as many as the Lord thy God it's called and put in my head oh my Hallelujah Hallelujah I will send them on to you and then he will come and he will reprove the world of sin are you Grace this morning did you catch that but Jesus said it was expedient that I go away because if I don't go away you can't become like me that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's called the anointed one Christ is called the anointed one the Holy Ghost is the anointed one amen so that's the Holy Ghost so if I don't go away then you're not going to get the Holy Ghost and so you won't be anointed like I am en now he I know he was the fullness I can't clarify he was the fullness we're not the fullness but it's still the anointed one all right and he said but then when he comes hey and when he comes who when who comes it's not Christ because he's gone what is Christ it's not Jesus because he went away but Christ is the anointed one so in the beginning of eight and when he comes the Holy Ghost he will reprove the world of sin where's the Holy Ghost today it's not just out there no no it's not just out there it's guarded it's guarded in your heart it's guarded in your heart you get that you see how the the Tabernacle in the wilderness it was guarded by the beast when Jesus came and they wrote the New Testament about Jesus life and history it was guarded by the the the the Gospels the gospel American Luke and John guarded acts when acts was going to come what's acts the Holy Ghost he will reprove the word of sin and righteousness and of judgment listen that's why the Bible says why in the world do message people got to fight and call up the judge and at the at the government courts when you're going to judge the world you're already judging the world did you see it you see it I'm not making this up the other day there was an example many years ago excuse me and and there have been somebody connected to a church and and and the the people connected around that had many Spirits or issues it wasn't in this country was a long ways away and I'm not connected or nothing and I'm just trying to show you and it was it was around a message church and somebody from many miles away told me he said the Pastor turned up to the authorities and the cops the Bible tells us the Bible says to have Matt's little kids and Leah and Curtis judge the situation it says that the little ones the least and the littlest among you could judge us better than the Earthly judges and our Lord it's because of this verse right here John 16 8. and righteousness and judgment will come from you and I will and he will come the anointed one Christ it'll be Dale Christ it'll be Evans Christ it'll be Matt Christ it'll be Jared the Holy Ghost the holy spirit it's the anointed one are you getting it and you will reprove the world of sin the world the people in your circle will have as much grace as you have if you go to the Christmas party tonight at the Holiness Church and you go there with the judgmental and and dynamic Spirit that's what will be portrayed out to those people but if you go with love and kindness let me see the attributes long-suffering kindness Mercy gentleness patience by all these things we'll know that before the foundation of the world before God was God and before there was angels that you were in his loins oh my God that's just crazy good like that but now the balance is we can only give them what Christ give us the prophet said in church order and Doctrine multiple times he said take everything back to the word of God and run it through and this was his absolute Church ordering doctor I'd give you the quotes for her multiple times dozens of times see see the prophet didn't come to write a new Bible the Bible is already given the prophet came to reveal the Mysteries what was that about the white horse rider oh that saved and disguised what was that about marriage and divorce oh what was that about predestination I never ever seen my name in the Bible before the prophet showed me the revealed word I I never knew that I always was before I came to the rub to to a message that God had sent a prophet that was divinely inspired of God and revealed that I always were so see if I show here that your body is a temple of the Lord and you don't you don't cut holes in it and you don't put glue on it and you don't paint it like a barn and all these things and you say well but I do that but you know God don't see it because because he sees my heart oh I'm like that she's my heart I don't see that so then so then immediately immediately I'm not Grace to them because because I can't find it in here I can't find it in here you know the prophet was preaching but I I just love our I tell you what if you you want to bless your heart get an iPad or laptop go to questions and answers don't listen to it only and sit in front of that screen and listen to it and watch the words go and watch them answer questions about this right here he's so perfect you see it was Christ see see watches he would say things that I would disagree no I don't she almost grab onto something they asked him can you cut girls hair you asked brother Dale so you know you thought it was something that was good they asked him to think and he said Grace Grace I'm looking for Grace can you cut girl's hair can't a woman don't cut your hair woman don't cut your hair Gloria's hair is so long for a woman girl girl child he said can't find it in here he says I guess if you you know if it's getting in their eyes and he cut their bangs they're just a girl girl I guess it would be all right I'm like a woman cut their hair absolutely not I'm not cutting my girl's hair I never ever one time cut my girls in who's hide the scissors okay but see the prophet our prophet is it in here can girls cut their hair says well woman not to cut their hand you see let me give you another example you thought I was thinking of something else they said I own a Sloan and I know it's wrong for women to cut their hair can you imagine if I owned a slow how many years would come here to check I know none of these would I wouldn't either somebody asked brother Brandon my questions today it's N64 after the seals so he he had all his revelation they said I own a saloon and I cut hair and I know the message that you teach and the Bible says for women not to cut their hair and I don't believe in cutting hair but I cut other people's hair they come to me I'd say you look for a new job you know the prophet never said that oh he did it now I'm going to be blind honest with you he never actually answered that question but she said and I Merit and they like but she colored hair she called it something else she called it what do they call it what do you call it died okay and what do you and he the prophets suck well I can show you he never actually answered her cutting people's hair that came to her but I'm telling you right up it's wrong but he never answered it you see those people came to her for that service he didn't justify he just didn't touch him I'm just telling you what he said but regarding color you know what he said I'll tell you what brother Dale's gonna drop the Mets even if I don't have Nets the day I come home and I see my wife's got blonde hair she'll had the first black guy when we come to church that you've ever seen you know what our Prophet said I don't see it in the Bible I guess it would be okay to color your hat I tell you what I'll tell you my daughters if you start coloring your hair because of that question I think you'll be brain dead that's what I think be brain cancer but they sell the profit finish stock it's natural for a woman the one of them you see how perfect see so when somebody comes and says I can only give you what I've been giving and that's what's in here ain't that amazing amazing brother Mike you want your wife to start coloring your hair you want her to have blue hair the prophet said it'll be okay I'm like really that's perfect because he had a perfect message and it's because it wasn't him it came from God it came from God amen oh I'm sorry Grace see when Christ came in a Manger it was Grace because he was the perfect sacrifice and when he went away he gave that job to you that's that we're going to finish this next week I'm going to show you the example or more than one but one for sure somebody in the Bible that had sin tried to hide it it was revealed a prophet came and gave him Grace he denied the grace and on second reconsideration he finally accepted it and was made pures of living amen see if the people in your life will accept Grace that's why your life is so important because most people in our day and age are on a screen you can't hardly buy paper anymore voice of God don't even sell paper anymore they're definitely not reading this paper the world but they're reading you and if you got smut on your life they have a hard time clarifying whether that's Grace or bondage the world calls it freedom but it's bondage God help brother Dale you know we don't have to judge the world well if if you're going to judge it like Christ would the Bible says judge not lest ye be judged but this will do it for you like if you walk out of the church because you don't believe this I mean well I'm not even I don't even know how to answer that I I almost said sorry but I'm not sorry because see this is this is it amen amen God help us amen the world is walking away from it you don't think so just go to another church and look at pants I want any one of you I'm I challenge you to come and ask me after who one generation their grandma wore a dress the daughter wore pants the granddaughter's gay she's sleeping with a woman or a guy that's that's saith the word of God you know what it is our Prophet said I tell you I can hardly stop it's a perverted spirit if it ain't in here more than that it's perverted if you try to take Grace away from me it's perverted because Christ gave it to me if you try to wear pants and God wanted you to wear a dress it's perverted it's perverted that's the state that our worlds is one generation perverty God help the so-called believer why don't we recognize this brothers and sisters brother Matt I don't want to know what and I haven't heard nothing I don't want to know what they said about you sister Patty brother I don't it's none of my business what God said about you you see what I mean and Christians are burning up the airlines did you know did you know should we pull up that scripture blessed are you when the people come to your church for a Christmas party and say I heard a lot of negative thing about you brother Dale and all these accusations and all that and Christ says oh praise God he says be exceedingly happy praise God see if I had a clean slate I would have had the same character as Christ because they stoned the prophets called Jesus Baba's about father of the devils born out of wedlock for Verity that's what they were calling them I feel like I'm in really good company really really good company but believers watches but make Believers I am gonna I am gonna try to close but make believers with itchy years that don't want to hear the truth and and Christ has given them over to a strong delusion you got a year for all the garbage tell me that's juicy tell me that again and they'll be lost because of them accepting Grace they've denied it they've denied the very Giver of it oh my I I hope I tell you what God loves you God has God has
