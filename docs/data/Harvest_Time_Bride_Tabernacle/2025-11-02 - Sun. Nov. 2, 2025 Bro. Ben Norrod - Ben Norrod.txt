Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, it's just so good. Amen. Just a couple announcements and we want to show some pictures. I I know uh brother Bernard and Sister Ruth were out this weekend. He had to write a big exam in Toronto. So, if anybody's wondering where they are, it's just uh just pray for Brother Bernard. He just got his diesel mechanic. So, I mean, they're in good shape. We pray and just and bless them and their family is just beautiful. But he had a major exam this uh weekend. And so, they're spending the weekend with family. And also, I have something to correct. I made a mistake, misspoke or just my stupidity or ignorance or whatever. I I had announced when I was doing the prayer request last Sunday about Sister Cindy and she was going for uh Cindy Ward was going for an exam this week and it wasn't that she or for a surgery sorry exam [snorts] uh she was actually going for consultation but I said on her surgery that it was 5050 chance that she could die. It was actually a 50/50 chance that the surgery will be successful. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; So that was nobody's fault but me. So you can throw your eggs or Amen. It was I didn't mean to mislead anybody on that. But we do pray for Sister Cindy. Me and Lang go visit her. She's in Sia Hospital. If anybody wants to go see her, it's you'll be the one blessed more than her if you go bless her. She would love to be in she her surgery is her goal is as long as she's on the earth, she would love to be with us. She'd like to be mobile and functionable so she can have a normal life. Walk, be in fellowship in church and that. She's having trouble walking. She's having trouble with one arm. But God knows everything. Amen. God's it's just an amazing God. And we love him. And I by no way did I mean to mislead. I didn't mean to uh I I apologize for that. Not to uh to show that uh you know something that wasn't true. Amen. There. Amen. Amen. And we're going to show some uh pictures of of uh uh Jamaica. Brother Osman Bartley's This is Brother Osman Bartley's church building. And we'll just stop there just for a second. We We have lots of time. We got lots of food after. We got more food than you can eat after. I promise. Uh I just a short testimony. He asked brother Osman how they were doing and uh and his house and his goat in his barn and his house was not touched and his goat barn which is uh flimsy. &gt;&gt; He he is a man of labor and work. And he said he he he's banded the whole barn over the roof with wire to to the ground before the hurricane. So he was working his his bones off and he never had a single goat or nothing lost or the barn or so nothing that Osman Bartley owns is damaged except crop. He said the crop was all damaged but this is her church so we can show um some example. Now we will we will this is inside. So we and even this even these pictures you know we can praise God for everything. The wood and the rafters are still there. This is very easy to repair. Piece of cake. &gt;&gt; Pop some tin on paneling inside just like new. I want I want to read uh something. I took a picture of it. I could because I'm communicating with Osman Bartley and uh I told him I said, "I wished I were a millionaire and I could really bless the bride of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this was his response to a man that's digging for money. which he is not. He said, "Your prayers and your care already from the heart will manifest blessings." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's That's a man of God. That's a man of God. Amen. That's a man of God. I also did ask him. I said I said, "Are you and Barbara all right?" I said, "You got food, you got water." And and unbeknownst this this would surprise you. They have less food than they have water. He said there's all the crops were destroyed. There's no banks open. There's no stores open. And there's no food. Food inflation prices will go right through the roof there. And he said there's no hydro, no phone lines, and no internet or nothing. He was operating on his generator. But we'll just go through these pictures not to take too much time. And this is all the church. the ceiling has fell in and and uh so if anybody I mean we're not campaigning for money but I personally am going there and I personally will help fix this. Amen. Brother Osman deserves a church uh building more than I do. Um that that's uh some of the believer's houses. So uh they're lacking roofs. This is another believer's house. believer's house that goes to Osman Bartley's church. That's another believer's house. And that's another believer's house. Everything's there but the roof. Amen. But God protected Pastor Osman &gt;&gt; tremendously. Amen. And his his own uh Amen. And we praise God for that. So Amen. Maybe we'll stand and just sing a song as our brother Ben comes. He's got it all in control. See? &gt;&gt; Yeah. [music] Amen. He's got it all in control. He's got it all in control. He put that [music] way down in [singing] my soul.

[music] Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. I'm so thankful for his mercy and his love to us. He's been so so very good to us. Now, I certainly enjoyed last night's service, and I trust it was a blessing to you. [applause] Praise the Lord. Nice to hear all those big amens after that hard preaching last night. I thought, well, Ben, Norod, you've done it again. And there'll probably be about four or five in the church this morning. Won't be a whole lot around. But, I I'm very thankful to the Lord that you u you you're tough Christians. You can take some good hard preaching. And I'm pretty thankful the Lord for that. So, you know, it's not everybody that can do it. [laughter] No, no, it's not everybody can do it. Some people, they just just almost faint right in the floor when you get a little tough on them. And, you know, and I I just was thankful. It's a a good message to preach for us. I thought it's a little bit of a tough thought that we have to kind of digest and really take into our heart and really give accountability for a lot of things. But, you know, this is kind of where we're at, folks. This is the hour we're living in and this is the time to get things straightened down, tightened up. And you know the old sailors used say batten down the hatches. Whatever those hatches are, we need to batten them down. Don't you think so? Amen. Praise the Lord. And so, uh, we just thank the Lord. And you, you can be seated for just a little bit if you want. I'm I'm going to sing to you a little bit before we preach. Uh, just want to say, uh, how much I appreciate the opportunity to be here as always. Brother Dale is, um, uh, he's just such a close, dear friend. And I I just so thank the Lord for him and his family and and um I was congratulating Amy back there, but I said, "I just got one question for you." She said, "What?" I said, "Where was my review of the resume?" And I wonder why Uncle Ben didn't get a chance to go over this whole matter before we [laughter] Amen. But anyways, he um I I'd like to meet you, brother, after service for sure. Wesley, was your name right, Wes? I asked Amy if she calls him Wesley when she's mad. I said, "Are you there yet?" And she said, "We are." Amen. So [laughter] I said, "Well, that's about right. That's marriage." You know, that's the way it goes. You know, my full name is Benjamin Jesse Norod. And I always knew when I was in trouble, my mom said, "Benjamin Jesse." And uh-oh. Right then, you knew you better back off. We walk it back, my son. You You went too far when you hear that called out. So we we thank the Lord. But uh what a privilege it is to be here. Thank you for your all your hospitality and uh all of your nice comments. And you know, I just there's something about you people here that has been so very special to me through the years. And uh you know, I just can't begin to express the love that I have for all of you and for brother Garcia and his nice wife, sister. My goodness, we we love these folks right here so much. [applause] me and um brother Jose, the Lord willing, we're going to El Salvador come the first weekend of December. He's uh he's going a little early and I'm going down. And I had I was telling the this morning a brother had heard cuz I've been asking people to pray of course going to the meeting and things and some brother called and um he he left me kind of a message get back with him. I said yes. He said I heard you're going to El Salvador. I said yes sir. He said who you going with? I said, "Well, I'm meeting the pastor and some of them down there." He said, "So, your wife is not going?" I said, "Not not originally. No, that wasn't in the plan." He said, "Well, she is now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, &gt;&gt; Amen. So, [applause] [cheering] I received the finance right away and I was able to go and find the ticket and they put us on the same flight all the way up there and back. We're right next to each other all the way down there and back. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So I I was grateful to that. There was a prophecy given in the bed one night. We were laying there just kind of praying many many years ago. First moved to Tennessee. First couple years of I think we were there maybe oh I moved in May of 03 and I guess this was around sometime around ' 05. And we were laying in the bed just praying one night and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord moved over me in prophecy and God spoke and said that he was going to take her gift, shake it before the world and that she would sing to the world. And do you know that that's happened just exactly like the Lord said it. &gt;&gt; I've been around the world at least one time and she's been halfway around it with me and I I just thank the Lord for that. So I think the Lord's got a blessing for those people in that music down there somehow. And so we're thankful for that. [applause] And I guess sister, are you going? Are you going with brother? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, now see, that's an even double blessing, is it? Now you'll have sister down there with you. Well, that's [applause] that's fine. That's really really fine. I thank the Lord for that. So, it's just been a wonderful weekend. I can't explain it, but just the peace that I've felt within myself traveling. And I I don't know when I have felt as relaxed and at peace as I've felt making this trip out here this weekend. I don't know what you all prayed for me, but you keep praying that. I need that more [laughter] and more. I just been a I was up before daylight and just praying, talking to the Lord, and just so many wonderful things in prayer were happening and God just meet me right there. Different requests and different needs and oh, it's just been a wonderful day before the Lord. So, we're just thankful for it and and uh God helping us. And I I want to talk to you just a moment about Jamaica myself cuz I was at brother Bartley's and many of those saints down there. And I wrote brother Keith Reed and I asked Brother Keith if they're okay and he sent me a thumbs up that they're fine. So, we're thankful for that. Now, those people down there, let me tell you something. They need God to come down there and help them in the way of the gospel. So any missionary program you've got at all that has any worth to it at all, send it to Jamaica. They need it. Those ministers are crossing back and forth. And those brothers, they preach all the time and go and uh I was with one fell out there u old brother Lewis and he he he drove a car from the 80s. You know, Brother Lewis, I know you do. It broke down times trying to get over to brother um Black Eagle. Um it's Brother Brady. That's right. And and poor little old car. We get about halfway up and the brother jump out there and he, you know, and I'm sitting in there looking through the little crack in that hood over there and and all of a sudden I see fluid squirt like this around the side of it and the old fella go and he and I hear him holler. It's almost like a pilot holler contact and he go that thing just squeal. I just bowed my head and prayed. I thought well Lord I I guess I could walk it from here but I'd rather go in this car. It hadn't really backslid. It was just kind of laying down on God a little bit, I think. You know, it wasn't exactly as spiritual as it needed to be. I don't know if it was backslid yet, but uh but I was laughing about it because I thought, well, you know, here we sit in a modern convenience feeling inconvenient. And uh you know, I thought, well, shame on me for even thinking that away. So, I I don't know if this had anything to do it or not, but I sure put my head and prayed and I just bowed down. I said, Lord, just help them figure it out whatever's going on because this is for the gospel sake, not for our comfort. And just a few seconds after I said in Jesus name, amen, I heard it go wrong. And it went right on. So anyways, he's a pastor. He's a he's a he's a a great man of God. And those saints down there, they they need that support. They need that help. I mean, I'm not saying they're poor and outcasts. There's other places way yawn more poor than Jamaica. But they're doing a good work on that island. And I think God's with them. And um I got to laughing because there's a Manchester, Jamaica. And so I walked up to the platform that night and I said, "It's good to be home tonight." &gt;&gt; And they said, "Home? Home? Why home? This is Jamaica, not home." I said, "We're in Manchester, aren't we?" They said, "Yes." I said, "That's where I live is in Manchester." &gt;&gt; And they said, "No, Manchester, Jamaica." I said, "Oh, you don't mean Tennessee." I said, "With all these hills in this country out here, I thought for sure we was back home in Manchester, Tennessee." And so, oh, it was a just a wonderful time. And the Lord permitted I just wrote brother Keith matter of fact for all this come up this storm everything and I told him I've been burdened to go back and uh I don't know when or how maybe in the turn of the year and you know get a chance to set the the flight up I want to get back down there and preach to those precious people. There was um a situation there's a brother he was up on the mountain he was almost blinded with cataract and things and not not cataract but glaucoma it was do you remember the brother's name &gt;&gt; Ginger Hill? Yes sir. That's exactly where it was. Yes, that's the one. Brother Morris. We went up there and I was sitting in the room with Brother Morris and he said, I didn't know him, he didn't know me. And of course, we were just talking and fellowshipping and got about the time I guess service is going to start and he stopped and looked at me and I'm just giving this testimony for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, cuz uh my going to Jamaica came to me in a dream. I was actually in Chadam at that little house that Curtis had there on the side of his home. I stay in that little parsonage there. they had or they made it to parsonage. And in that dream, I had just come back from I I guess I would been in Europe for a couple days. I've been in Belgium and uh France and England preaching revivals and uh meetings there. And I come right back off the plane, went straight to Ontario. And I was staying out there and in this dream, I was trying in the airport, I was trying to get to Jamaica as hard as I could go. Every outlet, every turn, every exit and I kept going around Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica. Where's Jamaica? How do I get to Jamaica? Jamaica. And I woke up from that and I thought, Lord, do you want me to go to Jamaica? [laughter] I thought, well, I don't even know exactly how I'd get there. I don't know anybody. And do you know within about 30 minutes, there was a brother called me and he said, "Brother Ben, I want to ask you a question." I said, "Yes, sir. Have you ever thought about going to Jamaica?" [applause] I said I said, "Yes, sir. It's crossed my mind a time or two. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; And so he um so he he arranged the the trip for us to get down there and connected with brother Keith and some of the brothers and they arranged the meeting for us to go. And I was sitting with brother Morris on Ginger Hill up there. And uh Brother Lewis had packed me all the way up the top there. And we were sitting back in one of these rooms around the corner of the church light. And he just I noticed when he was talking to me, he kept looking above my head like that and trail his eyes. And he looked back at me and he looked up and he'd trail his eyes. And every few minutes he was doing that like that. And we talked and talked just about normal things and this and that. And he said, "Well, brother Ben, I'm going to let you go." And he said, "I know that God has sent you here." He said, "Because all the time we've been sitting here fellowshipping about 10 or 15 minutes." He said, "The pillar of fire just keeps going back over your head like this over and back and forth." He said, "I know that you're God's servant. You've been sent to us." Do you know that night there had been some representatives from VGR that had come in for with the sole purpose of making Brother Joseph Brandom an eighth day prophet telling him to quit preaching to play nothing but tapes and to quit allto together believing in any other kind of thing except for return ministry and a few things and the Holy Ghost put it I didn't even know it until I was done preaching two hours I laid into that thing about how you've got to go to church and brother Brandham didn't believe things like that and that's not what the Bible teaches us. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And when I got done, some of these people run over to me and said, "You don't know what's been happening here, do you?" I said, "No, I really don't." Evidently, they've been just assaulted for two straight weeks, these men coming in doing those things. Now, I'm not casting any aspersions on Brother Joseph for the VGR, but there are people in every organization and in every group and every, you know, circle or whatever you want to call them that'll do these kind of things. And they're just they're just troublemakers and they should be weeded out all together and made to repent for the evil things they're doing in the name of this message &gt;&gt; and in the name of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Those things ought not be. Christians go to church. We believe in five-fold ministry. And I I have no problem with brother Joseph being a prophet. There's many prophets in the New Testament. But every prophet must acknowledge God's star of the age. And there's only one star and that one star was William Marry and Brandon. Let all apostles, prophets, evangelists, let them acknowledge what he wrote and said was the commandment of the Lord. Oh, you say that's strong. No. But he said, I preach what Paul preached. And he was the seventh angel to reveal the book of Revelation to us. We have no problem believing that. I have no problem with there being other prophets on the earth. No sir, &gt;&gt; not at all. No, sir, I don't. Because in the book of Acts alone, there are 13 recorded in the book of Acts alone. &gt;&gt; So, we don't have problems with that. God sent prophets to this generation, but there's only one star to God's age. One voice. And all of us have to say what that voice says. Amen. So, we thank the Lord. And the Lord does I could just talk to you all afternoon about it. I mean, he done so many things down there. And I I'd like to go again if the Lord help us. And so pray with me, will you about those things and pray for us with Honduras coming and then uh excuse me uh El Salvador, I mean to say and u and pray for us with um uh with that burden. And uh there's some little transitioning things ministry-wise happening for me. I'm not exactly sure what's going to be or how it's going to work, but uh I've got several little things that's coming on, new things that I'm going to try to see what the Lord will say about it. And I I I won't say too much about it out loud because I don't exactly know the directions or how it's but you just pray for me. The Lord help me give me some wisdom about some things. Uh I haven't been able to travel for a couple years. I tried with brother Dale one year and uh you know they gave me trouble with the visa and I I didn't I couldn't hardly get there and I ended up not end up being not not able to go at all. And I I I'm ashamed to have to say that that didn't work out like that. Brother Lane staff was so nice. He helped me with the ticket and everything. And I still got that money. Little fool. I'm going to use it one of these days, the Lord willing. Uh, but my my health after that hit I took with CO, my health wasn't good. &gt;&gt; And I'm an alpha. I'm stubborn. I'm proud. And I don't like to admit when I've been kicked and I'm down. But I had to finally just kind of say, you know what? I'm not well. So, I've taken a couple years and I've really been working on things. And I'm so happy to testify that God has just completely restored me all together. [applause] I'm so thankful to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I had what they call long COVID. You know, I had blood pressure problems and you name it and all that kind of stuff. But the Lord has been gracious to me. The lady gave me an examination the other day. She said, "Your lungs are perfect. Your kidneys are perfect. Your liver is perfect." &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful to the Lord for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, with all that said, we love you. God bless you. Thank you for your nice participation and support of this meeting this weekend. And uh you know, I I hope y'all know that I don't put on this ain't just me acting like a preacher. I genuinely love you. [laughter] I really do. And I I thank the Lord for the opportunity to get to shake your hand and talk to you and you know and and uh sometimes you know when you get in a crowd like this it's hard to grab everybody but you you just know that if I saw you across the room brother or sister don't matter I wanted to say hi to you or shake your hand or God bless you some way. [applause] So we thank the Lord and u at that point now I'm going to go over here to this pen and sing a little bit and then we're going to get right into the preaching of the word of the Lord. Are you looking forward to what the Lord's going to say this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Me too, folks. Too &gt;&gt; the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; My sleep is gone. My heart is full of sorrow. I can't believe how much I've let you down. [singing] I dread the [music] pain that waits for me tomorrow.

Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; I'm not on an ego trip. I'm nothing on my own. &gt;&gt; I make mistakes and I often slip. Just common flesh and blown. But I'll prove someday just what I say. I'm of a special kind. For when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. &gt;&gt; For he knew [singing] me. [music] Yet he loved [singing] me. [music] He whose glory makes the heaven shine. [music] So un worthy [music and singing] of such mercy. When he [singing] was on the cross, [music] I was [singing] on his back. I'm not [singing] on [music] an ego trip. I'm [singing] nothing on my own. [music] I make mistakes and I often slip. Just [music] common flesh and bone. [singing] [music] But I'll prove someday just what I say. I'm of a special kind when [music] he was on the cross that day. The bride was on his mind [screaming] for he [singing and music] knew me. Sing it. Oh [screaming] yet he loved me. [music] Oh, he [singing] whose glory makes the heavens shine. Oh, I was so unworthy. [music and singing] of such mercy. [music] [singing] When he was on [music] the cross that day, I was [music] on his mind. [music] And [singing] the look of love was on his face. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The thorns were on [singing] his head. The blood that ran down that scared [singing] roll. [music] It cr all his eyes were on the ground that day. He looked ahead [screaming] in time. When he was on the cross that day, [music] I I was on [screaming] his mind. Oh yes, he knew [singing] me. Oh yes, he loves me. Oh, he whose glory makes the heaven shine. [music] Oh, so unworthy. Yes, I was. [music] Such mercy when he was on the cross. [music] I was on [singing] his [music] mind for when he was on the cross [singing] that day. Oh, help me sing it now. You and I were all [screaming] hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. Woo. [music] Oh, bless his holy name. &gt;&gt; He's all I need. &gt;&gt; He's all I need. [music] When I need someone to talk to, he's always there to hear my prayer. each time I [music and singing] call him. And on this friend I can rely [singing] [music] to be my strength as life goes by. He [singing] the Lord of all and he's all I need. [music and singing] He comforts me [singing and music] when I'm weary. [music] Jes [singing] pain. He fills [music] my deepest [singing] longings. Time and time and time again. [music] He's my soul's inspiration. Amen. [music] He's my heart's glory. consolation. He's [singing] my everything. He's [music] all I need. [music] He's all I need. I want you to listen this morning. I dare not turn to any other. Some of you need to hear this next line. For he's [singing] a friend. [music] A friend that's closer [singing] than any brother [music] and this friend. I can't rely to be my strength as life goes by. He [music] is the Lord of all. Remember the Jose and he's all remember the name. I need [music] comfort me when I'm weary. I'm going to tell you something. [music] They told me because of the way CO hit me, I'd never be able to hold long notes or sing like this anymore. So, I'm just going to go ahead and let you know I'm about to kick the devil in the mouth for a little bit. He comforts [singing] me [music] when I'm weary and hees every pain. [music and singing] Listen. Fills my deepest longings. Time and time and time again. He's [music] my soul inspiration. My heart [music] is [music and singing] my everything.

[singing] Jesus is all I need. One time heers prayer. He [singing] answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus is all I need. He answers prayer. How many believes he does? He answers prayer. [singing] Jesus is all I need. [singing] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [applause] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up. This word means to seize suddenly, to snatch away by force, &gt;&gt; or to rescue eagerly. This is not known as much of a violent act, but rather a lover's pull. &gt;&gt; Third pull to be honest with you. &gt;&gt; To be clear, the same word is used in Jude verse 23 is saving others, pulling them out of the fire. Harpadozo caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. I want to read to you now from the rapture message. Brother Beam said, "But to the church, the bride, the rapture will be a revelation to her." Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's revealed to her &gt;&gt; that the revelation, the true bride of Christ &gt;&gt; will be waiting for that revelation &gt;&gt; of the rapture. That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you this morning on the reason for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; for the presence that we feel in this place. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We know that it is nothing more and nothing less than the presence of almighty God. And &gt;&gt; Father, we look to you this morning to come by your word, &gt;&gt; not only to anoint me and to anoint them, &gt;&gt; but to open our hearts that we might speak and receive that which you want to give to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; We pray, Father, that your word will be broken to us like the bread of life. And may we as your hungry little eagles open up our mouths to receive today what the engrafted word would want us to have. We commit this service both speaker and listener in Jesus Christ's name. And all the saints said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May the Lord bless you. The rapture is um a beautiful subject and as honestly as I can express it to you, I don't think I'd ever be able to get it done in this particular service. If I had 10 in a row, I don't think I could get it done. There's so much in it. And um but it's um a vital subject for us because of the time we're living in, the hour living in. We need to make sure that we're ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus. And you know, you hear so much preached about it at times. You hear folks talking about the rapture, rapture this, rapture whatever. And um you know, it's almost kind of like we I I know this going to sound a little rude in a way, but it's almost like we just blow it off like we don't even care that it's coming. &gt;&gt; We know why that is. Is because Jesus told us that before the coming of the Lord or the second portion or this portion we're waiting on now, that there would be a time of delay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And in that time of delay, that's where people would have a tendency to kind of uh look to the left and the right. And if you study it closely, their attitudes begin to change. They start smiting God's fellow servants and the uh the men of God and the people of God and so forth like that. And so the delay is a hard time for people. And of course, they had the same thing at the first advent of the coming of the Lord. There was a delay between the voice of Malachi and the coming of John the Baptist. And by the time that Jesus arrived, the prophet said there were only six believers in the Ladyan, what he called the Ladyan Old Testament church age. And during that time, that little handful that held on, Simeon and Anna and some of them like that, they were looking for the coming of the Lord. And they knew that God would come, maybe perhaps not in their generation, but they knew he would come according to prophecy. and they were making their hearts ready at any moment that the Messiah might show up. And one of my favorite passages and you know if I could have chose some places to be in life and you know if I was a time traveler you know what I'm talking about if I could get in a little egg or a buggy or a machine or some kind of thing and push a button and go somewhere. I would have loved to been standing there that day in the temple when they brought Jesus in to be circumcised on the eighth day and watch old Simeon pick him up and say let the Lord servant depart in peace for I've seen God's Christ on the scene. I I would have loved to seen that. I would have loved to seen the look, amen, on John Baptist's face when he was standing there on the riverbank. Amen. This man that was a cousin according to the natural way of life. Amen. As far as they were concerned, Amen. And come by the family way of being a cousin. Amen. And then let him stand there on that bank. Amen. And look over and see the pillar of fire above Jesus and that revelation striking. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. I would have loved to been there to see that. Amen. But we know that people in the message of that day because that's what they were following had come to such a a place that there was a a rudeness about them when it came to the truth. As I said yesterday, Amen. The people had so lost their love for the things of God until they weaponized weaponized rather the message of that day. Amen. They didn't take the quotes and the scriptures and the things that have been given to them from all the prophets and things and try to weave them together to make the people come closer to God, but rather it became a tool or a weapon or a device for them to call men unto themselves for the call the people and subjugate them to themselves until Jesus said, "Woe unto you lawyers," which was an interpreter of the word that day. He said, "Because you stand right in the door and will not allow them to pass through into eternal life." These men were the custodians of the message of the hour. But because they had an evil heart and an evil spirit and because they had lost all the love that a person could have for the word of God. Amen. But you say that only come in the New Testament. No, no, no. One of the first things that Jesus said in the commandments, he referred back to Moses when he talked to the rich young ruler. You know the commandments and things. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, thy strength, thy soul, thy mind, thy spirit, and thy purpose. Amen. In other words, the love for Almighty God was present then, it's present today. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the big differences between us as believers and the rest of the organizations, denominations, and everything else is that we know who we love. Yeah, [applause] &gt;&gt; the word, the message of the hour has revealed to us the true nature of Jesus Christ, his personality, what kind of person he is, and who he is by God's prophecy and promise of the last day. Amen. Stay with me a little while. Amen. The delay brings about, Amen. the uh uh expression or the manifestation, if you will, of every unbeliever. But so does it bring the believer, amen, into their apex and into their zenith of believing Christ. &gt;&gt; Listen to me carefully and don't fail this. We do not become what we become when everything is positive. &gt;&gt; We will never express perfect [screaming] love &gt;&gt; unless there's perfect hatred all around us. Yeah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "But brother Ben, we can express it at any time." That's true. But the darker it gets, the brighter the light can shine. [applause] &gt;&gt; And brother, [screaming] there will be a body on this earth that will overcome hatred and everything the devil has to offer. And by the grace of God, we will express [screaming] perfect love. &gt;&gt; In an age of perfect hatred, &gt;&gt; people don't trust. They don't have confidence. Even church people don't feel they can trust one another. &gt;&gt; They spend a lot of time mistrusting one another. How could we ever see God move in a united body when we stay so divided in our hearts? [applause] &gt;&gt; I said, "Wait a minute, preacher. I thought you were going to talk about &gt;&gt; I am." &gt;&gt; You'll see in just a moment how this all works into what we're getting at. &gt;&gt; You know, and the rapture for a lot of people is just an event. I want you to notice that a lot of folks would believe the rapture to them is just an escape from bad. &gt;&gt; To them, it's like a fire escape. &gt;&gt; I'll live in my house or the be work in this building and do anything I want to do and live anyway I want to live and well if I get in some trouble there's a fire escape and I can run out of here. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not a fire escape and neither is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Y'all get so quiet for I got something on my face. Oh, it's these band-aids holding my mic still. Oh, I see what you're see looking at. &gt;&gt; That must have been what surprised you so much. I It couldn't have been what I preached. Surely it couldn't have been what I preached. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ben, there's nobody like that." You would be absolutely shocked. &gt;&gt; How many people in this message only want the goodness of God if it means escaping hell? &gt;&gt; Brother, let me [screaming] go on record. I don't serve him or love him because I want to escape hell. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, if his will would be for me to go to hell. &gt;&gt; If that's what he wants for me, that's what I want. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not there yet, but that goes to prove your love needs to mature. &gt;&gt; Because when you fall in love with Christ in the right way, you're not looking for what you want. &gt;&gt; You're looking for what he wants. I'll agree with you. The real elect of God cannot be sent to hell. That's true. But if a man or a woman that really loves Jesus thought for a moment [screaming] that it would please God to not let them be a part of the bride. If they really loved him right, they would say, "Father, not my will but thine." Lord, [applause] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, somebody. &gt;&gt; That is the nature of the true elected. &gt;&gt; Woo! Somebody don't like that. Well, I'm so sorry. You're just going to have to tough it out cuz here we are. &gt;&gt; Well, but I want to be bride. I want to [screaming] be elect. You can't make yourself that. &gt;&gt; That comes by God's choosing and God's election. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You cannot make yourself. You can't pray yourself into bride. &gt;&gt; There will be many categories of people that will even live outside the city and be saved people that were never bride. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Gar and I was talking last night about St. John 3:16 and talking about God so loved the whole world. And this is what the prophet said. God projected his love to everyone. His love has been projected to the whole wide world. But election comes in in in accordance with the will of God. His love will not allow him to contradict his own word. So if his love would allow him to contradict his word, what kind of love you got? &gt;&gt; You could live any way you want. drink and smoke and cuss and lie and cheat and everything else in the world. Well, God loves me. &gt;&gt; He sure does. &gt;&gt; That's why when you do such things, he'll burn you up when you come to church. [applause] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Cuz he loves us &gt;&gt; and he wants us to be right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. I heard brother Bon say it just the other day. He said talking about drinking whiskey and things like that. He said that if a person wants to drink like that, there's a toxin in there that blanks out their mind. And I'd never heard Brother Ben say this before till the other day. He said, "My goodness, if you had a sickness," he said, "that was blanking out your mind, you would run everywhere you could looking for a doctor to help you figure out how not to have a blank mind." He said, "And yet people will go out [screaming] and buy it by the barrel loads." &gt;&gt; It goes to prove that Satan has moved on this generation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. until well they feel they can do anything they want. And most of these organizations will preach, don't worry about it. God loves you. &gt;&gt; He may love you and he may project his love to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But if he doesn't correct you or if you don't correction, &gt;&gt; you cannot find proof of the love of God. &gt;&gt; His proof that he loves me is that he corrects me. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'm not just here as a Christian by happen stance. I am here by the corrective and the guiding hand of Jehovah God. &gt;&gt; I am living [screaming] as I live because he loves me enough to tell me the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And one thing is for certain, as you'll see in a few moments, if you want to make the rapture, if you want to go on the resurrection, there's a certain life that you're going to have to live &gt;&gt; in order to get out of here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, insert amen here. &gt;&gt; A lot of [screaming] people think, I'm going to make the rapture cuz mama's got the token on me because I love Brother Bradom. You will not make the rapture in those conditions. [applause] &gt;&gt; The rapture is only for the Holy Ghost filled. &gt;&gt; Now, don't split hairs with me. I'm talking about real born again. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about people with gifts and feel the Holy Ghost. I'm talking about the absolute [screaming] authentic baptized changed from the [laughter] &gt;&gt; I get to talk in that way and I want to shout, not preach. Hallelujah to God. Amen. That's [screaming] who I am. Change that St. Paul sky blue sinkilling devil chasing. That's what I got in my [screaming] heart this morning. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have it when Jesus comes, you will be left here. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe the you will be left here. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe the pro you will be left here. Let's go into this a little bit, can we? &gt;&gt; Now, we realize that the pattern of this, look at it again. First Thessalonians 4. The Lord himself should descend with from heaven with a shout. That's a message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The voice of the archangel is the voice of God. That voice will be in the bride. I know I about shock some of you Canadians to death until you some some of you almost take a deeper breath when I say this. I knock the wind out of you. But I believe it to be the truth. I believe the bride of Jesus Christ when the time comes for change. I believe the real elect of God will be able to speak her own body change. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's just going to be some great planes falling out of the air and trains derailing. That's denominational dogma. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The rapture and the coming of the Lord will be a total [screaming] secret. &gt;&gt; Only those that with a trained heart will know him when he comes. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Now, watch the pattern of this. And the dead in Christ [screaming] shall rise &gt;&gt; first &gt;&gt; first. Then [screaming] we were to alive and remain. &gt;&gt; So look at the pattern of it. The dead will rise first. So Jesus as he leaves that seventh dimension and comes and sweeps through the sixth dimension will gather up all the saints of each age. This is where those elect told brother Ramy beyond the curtain of time that Jesus comes, he will come to you first. That's right. He will descend from the seventh dimension down into that sixth dimension rolling fields of blue grass. And he will go to each leader of each age and say, "Collect your group. It's time to go back." Now remember, he does not meet upon the earth. We don't meet Jesus on the earth yet, but we meet him somewhere between his home and somewhere between our home, which is in the air. We're translated up into that dimension where we will meet the saints of God for 3 and 1/2 years of the wedding supper. You know why brother Brandham said we meet each other first? &gt;&gt; Cuz he said when that hour arrives, &gt;&gt; he wants you to make sure you knew who made it and who didn't. &gt;&gt; Said that &gt;&gt; cuz you couldn't enjoy Jesus if you were sitting around wondering if mama made it or daddy made it or whoever didn't make it. &gt;&gt; But you'll be able to gather and shake hands with the saints of God. Now whether you believe it's a natural table and we're all going to be catered by the angels, fried chicken and and ters and maiders and whatever you believe about it doesn't matter. It is three and a half years of a gathering place with the saints of God. And at the end of that, Jesus comes back for the third part of his coming on white horses to the battle of Armageddon to deal with all of those sinners, those denominations, and those things that will go down in the battle of Armageddon. But on this side of the rapture, it's a secret. &gt;&gt; Cuz the rapture itself, reason number one, &gt;&gt; the rapture is about a uniting. &gt;&gt; Don't misunderstand what I'm getting ready to say, but as far as the rapture goes, I'm already in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Now, wait a minute, brother Ben. You're still in that [screaming] old body." I didn't say it wasn't. &gt;&gt; The saints are still here. Didn't say they weren't. &gt;&gt; But the problem is, you think the rapture is a one-time event. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not. The very moment a believer receives the Holy Ghost, [screaming] they are &gt;&gt; caught up. &gt;&gt; Did not the Apostle Paul say, "We have been risen to heavenly places in Christ Jesus." [screaming] &gt;&gt; What is that? Rapturing revelation, rapturing power, rapturing faith taking us out. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's a process. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And yes, it's going to take time. my body to catch up with the final moment of the rapture. &gt;&gt; But I'm already in it. &gt;&gt; I just heard brother Bon say on Who's this Melzdic a few weeks ago. He said if you are here in the air, &gt;&gt; if you are here in the air, he said you take this body [screaming] to meet the &gt;&gt; theophony. &gt;&gt; Well, how can I be in the air already if I'm not already in the air? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Only the born again know what I'm truly talking about. &gt;&gt; The rest of the world has no idea what's taking place. &gt;&gt; It's a secret. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's an invisible union between you and Jesus. &gt;&gt; Cuz you see, this union is the revelation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Your love affair with Christ. Hey, &gt;&gt; brother Dale and I was fellowshipping last night a little bit and we got done with everything and he was saying, you know, you can't miss the relationship. I said, "Oh, that's right." He said, "The relationship is everything." Yes, sir. I just kept quiet cuz he didn't know what I had in my notes this morning. I didn't want to let the kitty out of the bag too much. But, oh, how true it is. &gt;&gt; The real reason for the rapture is not so I can escape Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; No way. My real reason for the rapture is because I can finally unite fully fully &gt;&gt; with my bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ. [laughter] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Friends, do you understand that if heaven was nothing more than an old tinge shack? &gt;&gt; If Jesus was there, that's what make it with heaven. Make it heaven for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't need gates of pearl and streets of gold and I don't need all that. And if he wants to give it to me, amen and hallelujah, and so be it. But if it was nothing more than a mudill on the side of the road, &gt;&gt; as long as Jesus is there, that's all I care about. &gt;&gt; Cuz he is what makes this worthwhile &gt;&gt; as far as preaching goes. Think about a man getting up here and preaching and no Holy Ghost, no anointing. &gt;&gt; You know what makes preaching so enjoyable for me? This part of it right here is because I get to fellowship with him so deeply when I get to preach. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Cuz he comes in such a special way when he's dealing with the people. And I love this part of it. All the other stuff of preaching. You can have it. But this is I like &gt;&gt; being under his anointing and his [screaming] presence. And think about it one of these days. We're going to live in it and never leave it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you're not in love with him, then you have no reason for rapture. &gt;&gt; If your only reason is because well, you think it's a good part of Christianity. Oh, it's something to do. &gt;&gt; It's not that at all. It is the completeness of the union between the bride and Christ. Also, it is the finishing of all redemption. &gt;&gt; Right? Remember, redemption is not completed completed until your body is changed. &gt;&gt; You've got the earnest. Now, you've got a little portion of God down inside of your heart. You got what the prophet called a down payment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Mercy me. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Woo. If the down payment makes me feel this way, what do you think the whole thing's going to look like? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Glory to God, &gt;&gt; brother. is going to be beyond anything we could ever imagine or think. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's a truth. &gt;&gt; The rapture is for a ready bride. &gt;&gt; Notice in Revelations 19, it said, "The bride hath made herself ready." Did you notice &gt;&gt; she didn't make herself bride, &gt;&gt; but she did make herself ready. &gt;&gt; Come on now. You can't make yourself bride, &gt;&gt; but you can make yourself ready. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Why? Cuz if my name was on the lamb's book of life, [screaming] that titled de of redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; And redemption is [screaming] not completed until I'm ready to go meet Jesus. Praise Jesus. &gt;&gt; The rapture [screaming] is God's way to remove the bride before wrath. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You know, the beautiful thing of this is whenever it comes time for the change of our body, we will not even know the day nor the hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. It'll be just a normal day, &gt;&gt; just regular old things happening. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, Juliet will hear that ladder hit the top of the window. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And she'll hear a voice. Come on, Juliet. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's time to go home. &gt;&gt; It's time to [snorts and clears throat] get out of here. Come on. Come on. Shh. Shh. Be quiet now. We can't let the church here. They got to go through tribulation. But the rest, don't let them denominations hear you. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, all those days that those women were standing around, Amen. waiting on that rancher to come back, do you know that that little lady, they'd say to her, "What you waiting on? He's coming for me. He promised me. He's coming for me. Oh, why don't you just go ahead and sit down? Sit down. I might wrinkle my dress. No thanks." &gt;&gt; She stayed virtue. She's stayed all these things. And you know how she knew he was coming? This is the guy in the west, remember? And when them wagons go rolling down in the west, they always create a cloud everywhere they go. [applause] &gt;&gt; Woo! Hallelujah [screaming] to God. Hallelujah. And brother, that's how we know our bridegroom was coming for us because he came in the form of a cloud. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say now. Now, brother, be careful. I've heard guys preach that one off [screaming] in the air. And I've heard the ones that refuse to preach it go off in air, &gt;&gt; too. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; That wasn't just rocket ship smoke. &gt;&gt; That was our Lord up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; And it was all part of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not one event, not just one phase, but a process that began on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; He was only gone 10 days, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He promised he would return. He was only gone 10 days. He came back to them on the day of Pentecost. And that's what started the rapture for the church. &gt;&gt; Every message had a part of the rapture. &gt;&gt; They without us cannot be made perfect. So they had to be sewn in the ground. &gt;&gt; Wesley had a part. Luther had a part of the message. Pentecost had a part of the message. that all of these little loose ends had to be tied together &gt;&gt; so that the message would be so clear that the bride would know what to expect, how to make ready, and when it's time to get out of here, be ready to get out of here. &gt;&gt; What do y'all reckon's been happening in these times you've been coming to church and hearing this message and that thought and that revelation and God speak that and God do that? He has been working you through a process to get you ready for the finality of rapture, which is the change of your body. &gt;&gt; Let me prove that to you right now. Genesis 5 25 or 24, excuse me. The Bible said, "And Enoch walked with God." &gt;&gt; There has been cosmonauts. There has been astronauts. He was the first was not. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; For God translated him. Now this word uh walk it literally means to walk about to live to conduct oneself in continual fellowship. So Enoch didn't just get up one morning brother Dale and say you know what I think I'll just walk with the Lord. And God came down say oh that pleases me. Off you go. &gt;&gt; We use the expression he took a stroll but that was one stroll of many. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Cuz for Enoch, this was a daily walk, &gt;&gt; an everyday thing, an everyday walk with God, an everyday moving forward with the things of God. &gt;&gt; It was not a halfway life. [screaming] &gt;&gt; It was a continual walk &gt;&gt; of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "Well, you know, I've had so many things in the past and I've been this and I've been that." We're not talking about what you was. We're talking about what you are. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; God ain't looking at what you was. He wants to know what you are right now. &gt;&gt; What does your faith say? What does your life declare? What's your heart say? Come on, somebody preach to me. &gt;&gt; He wants to know right now [screaming] where's your heart right now. &gt;&gt; If you're halfway in and halfway out, that testifies what you think about what's coming in the future. Right? &gt;&gt; Cuz many testify with the way they walk &gt;&gt; as to what they think is getting ready to happen in this world, &gt;&gt; folks. &gt;&gt; How much longer do you think we could possibly have? For the first time since the prophecy was spoken in the book of Revelation, and brother Brandham reiterates it to us in 1954, we now have a pope from the United States. &gt;&gt; Don't say America. You're America, too. He didn't say America. He said the United States. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Canada is not the image to the beast. The US is. &gt;&gt; We are the ones that have the ability. And look at the setup of it. Now, I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to prophesy something, but my what better setup will we have right now for nearly 90% of Trump's office is his cabinet is Catholic people. &gt;&gt; The future president of 2028, highly possibly JD Vance, is a Catholic to the four. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What better [screaming] man if our new pope is still alive in four years &gt;&gt; to go to JD and say, "You belong to me, &gt;&gt; and this is the way you're going to do things." And the Bible said that he gave them power to speak as the beast did before it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There ever was a lamp trimming time. Now is that time. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Notice again, Enoch's entire [screaming] lifestyle was in step with God's rhythm. God said, "Do this." He said, "Yes, sir. God, do that." Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He had this testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Now, all the years I've been walking, I've had some scraped knees and bruised elbows. But in order to be the kind of human I need to be, I don't stop walking because I scrape my knee. Right. &gt;&gt; I don't stop walking because I trip over my big old long feet &gt;&gt; and fall on my [screaming] face. You know what I do? I get right back up &gt;&gt; and I keep on walking &gt;&gt; cuz you know 15 or 20 years or whatever. It's just a little tiny few seconds for God Almighty. He's not even looking at the length of time knowhow. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. People say, "Well, I've gotten so far. If we only knew how far the hand of God reached for us, we'd quit saying that foolishness, &gt;&gt; right? I love it." That's right. Now, watch this spiritual parallel. In Galatians 5:16, the Bible teaches us to walk in the spirit, &gt;&gt; so the bride's [screaming] rapture is the they're talking about the translation now is the ultimate final walk home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Think of it. On this earth, one day there'll be missing people." &gt;&gt; You ever been to Walmart or some of these places and they put these missing photos up in that little box? &gt;&gt; One of these days, mine's going to be there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "If 500 went out of here in the rapture, &gt;&gt; the world would know nothing about it." &gt;&gt; In another place, he said, "How do you know it's not going on all the time?" &gt;&gt; Oh, you see, we've got certain things in our mind because we're dogmatic. That's why &gt;&gt; quite honestly we haven't died from denominational prospects and ideas and conditions and theologies of this. We think God just has to do it in our little box of things. God does what he wants to. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But as far as first Thessalonians, the event of the rapture, this is a universal thing. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, there's no way God could be taking people off the earth privately." How do you know? How do y'all reckon that people knew whether Philillip was there or there? &gt;&gt; He was in one city. God translated him to another. Nobody knew nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Just a few people standing right there saw him just caught away. They might have not thought nothing about Well, praise the Lord. God done something. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 15 years later, anybody ever Philip, what happened, old brother Phillip? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We don't know but what God is doing things all the time right underneath our nose. &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Now watch. We are to walk in the spirit not walk in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Walk according to the spirit. Listen to this. He swore by himself. He said just walk unconscience of fear. &gt;&gt; Walk unconscience of criticism. &gt;&gt; Walk unconscience of the world. Walk as you walk in Christ. walk with him, not paying attention to the right hand or the left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, how do you do that? Uh-huh. You got the same look on your face whenever I ask myself the same question. &gt;&gt; It's easy to read this, &gt;&gt; but to do it is an entirely different thing. When your heart is so gripped with anxiety and fear and you don't know how to think or do or act or whatever, then you just pull these quotes out. You say, "Well, brother said, walk uncons. Okay, I'm going to do it." And you're scared to death like a little boy whistling in the graveyard pretending he's not scared. &gt;&gt; So, how am I going to get to a place to where I can walk unconscious of everything else around me? &gt;&gt; Says, "If something comes up in the church, walk with God." Hallelujah. Says, "If sickness strikes you, walk with God. If the neighbor don't like you, walk with God." Are you getting the essence of it? &gt;&gt; How [screaming] am I going to get there? Just keep walking. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't stop. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm scared. I'm fearful. Okay. Keep walking. &gt;&gt; Eventually. Eventually, brother Jose, you'll hit a spot &gt;&gt; to where all of that will just go behind you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And yet many of us get scared or fear or something strikes a sickness and we stop in our tracks. [gasps] That's just what the devil wants you to do. &gt;&gt; The doctor looks at you and says, "You've got dementia. You've got this, you've got cancer, you've got that. All of a sudden, that fear strikes your heart [gasps] and you stop walking. &gt;&gt; That's the key. The key. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; The key. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Don't stop walking. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Catch a vision of a well person and just walk right into [screaming] it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, what if I do? Well, don't know what to do. The Bible said just stand there and wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's true. Just stand and wait on him. When you can't walk, then [screaming] stand there and wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; But standing there is a lot different than stopping there. &gt;&gt; I stand and wait on the Lord cuz I know he'll make a way. When there's a wall in front of me, I know he'll make a way through it. &gt;&gt; But when someone stops, just flat out stops, it's because they have no ambition to keep on going. Oh Lord, if sickness strikes you, walk with God. The neighbor don't like you, walk with God. Just keep on walking. Enoch one day walked like that. You know, he walked all the way home. He got so far up the [screaming] road. Glory. I love this quote. That he didn't want to come back anymore. Amen. He said, "That's right. Walk with God. The doctor says you're going to die. Walk with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4:1. Now, Paul is going to tell us how we're supposed to walk. And remember, the rapture is a uniting with Christ. Here we go. I beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. This word he uses here is axios which means to be in balance with the value given. So walk equal literally means to walk equal to your qu to your calling rather. So the rapture bride isn't walking aimlessly &gt;&gt; but proportionately. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God's grace. &gt;&gt; I may not be able to behave myself and get through it. Boy, this blesses me. &gt;&gt; God's grace. Every time I take a step forward, there is [screaming] a measure. There is a measure of God's grace. Hallelujah. That meets Oh my Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, mind you, he don't pull out the fold, the full possession of He don't dump it all [screaming] on you at one time, &gt;&gt; but he gives you enough to be able to take &gt;&gt; the next step. &gt;&gt; Jesus, heal my eyes. Jesus, heal my eyes. Jesus, heal my eyes. Paul said, Paul, my grace &gt;&gt; is so I would [screaming] like for someone to show me &gt;&gt; where Paul's eyes ever stopped him from writing the Bible. Lord have mercy. [applause] &gt;&gt; What it prove [screaming] God's grace was proportionate to where he was at. &gt;&gt; He needed to write the letter to the Ephesians. God grace was there to let him write these. See what big letter I [screaming] write. &gt;&gt; That's right. told him Galatians, "You love me so much at one time, you would have plucked your own eyeballs out to give them to me to fix my eyes." &gt;&gt; But it was given to him because of the abundance of revelation, &gt;&gt; so he wouldn't get lifted up in pride. &gt;&gt; But God's grace met that standard, that condition. And every time Paul needed to go forward, &gt;&gt; there was enough grace there to meet that next step. &gt;&gt; And enough to meet the next step. and enough. Say, "Brother Ben, are we ever going to run out?" Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Are you joking me? &gt;&gt; He is the inexhaustible fountain of grace and life. [applause] &gt;&gt; He is an abundant supply, an inexhaustible [screaming] fountain of grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; So walk proportionately. Walk in a balanced way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice, oh my notice how the walk is just as predestinated as the baptism. &gt;&gt; We talk a lot about rapturing faith, but don't forget there's going to have to be some rapturing works go with our rapturing faith. There's a lot of people that don't believe in works. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe the Lord. I trust God. I love him. God don't care if I smoke or dip or vape or &gt;&gt; God don't care if I sit around and watch pornography. God don't care if I hate my neighbor. God don't care if I Y'all look at me like you ain't never heard nothing like this before. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about people out there. I'm talking about people that walk in the same churches you walk into. believe, claim to believe the same things you believe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of these places I go around the world, they're pitiful, but nothing like right here in North America. &gt;&gt; Between the Canadians and the Americans, we are the most pitiful of all the bunch. &gt;&gt; Because we have used the message for every excuse there is to live any way we want to. But if you plan on going out of here, your walk must be balanced. &gt;&gt; You can't be living in sin and then claiming grace. You can't be living like the world and then claim grace. You can't live like the devil and claim grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There should be a lot bigger amens on this. [applause] Canadians, have you gotten so soft on sin and so light on sin and so tolerant on sin that you don't even like a preacher preaching this way? What's the matter with you? &gt;&gt; You better wake up and pinch yourself. &gt;&gt; The devil's not [screaming] playing games. Even if you are. [applause] &gt;&gt; And when somebody starts living wrong, [screaming] &gt;&gt; if the word don't correct them and get them right, &gt;&gt; they are on their way to hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember folks, hell was created for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; Hell was not created for human beings. &gt;&gt; God never intended for people to go to to hell. He never wanted humans to go to hell. He was not willing that any [screaming] should perish. Amen. &gt;&gt; But because he's a just God, &gt;&gt; when people contradict and cross up his word, &gt;&gt; there's no other place they can go. &gt;&gt; God don't send anybody to hell. &gt;&gt; Man or woman sends themsself there by disbelieving the word of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's why they do what they do anyways. They don't believe. &gt;&gt; They live an unbeliever's life, but they hide it under religion. The devil's deceived you, my brother. The devil's deceived you, my sister. Repent and come back [screaming] to God or you're wind up in the tribulation or worse. &gt;&gt; This rapture is not for just any old willy-nilly thing that wants to come along. Well, I believe the message. You better straighten up and live a life that shows you believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz there'll come an hour of the voice will say, "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The unchangeable word. This is in July of 1960. [snorts] He said, "But a man seldom will you ever find one that'll lay down his life for the cause of Christ. He won't even call out of his shade tree and go to church. &gt;&gt; He won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend Wednesday night prayer meeting." &gt;&gt; That's right. He says, "Amen. It's a shame. It's a disgrace." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now listen close. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the angels don't visit the churches. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason the angels don't visit homes. &gt;&gt; We've got to get to deep sincerity of this thing. Yeah. Yeah. [applause] &gt;&gt; So, if an angel won't visit a church that's backslid and won't visit a home that's backslid and won't repent, by the way, &gt;&gt; then how do we think Jesus is going to come take us out of this world? &gt;&gt; If our life is any less than that right there, &gt;&gt; if an angel won't come to me, how will Jesus? &gt;&gt; Oh, mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth. [applause] If an angel doesn't feel comfortable to be in, they come from a heavenly place, friend. And if they come into their home, the atmosphere should match what's in our home, then what's in heaven. &gt;&gt; But if every time they come in the home is nothing but a bunch of fussing and fighting and lying and laughing and gossiping and everything, how can [screaming] an angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; ever feel comfortable in that atmosphere? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when we come to the house of God, We must be pure people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you walk in here a sinner or a backslider or somebody trying to get your life right with God and you don't know any better, this does not apply to you. But if you claim to be a believer and you're a regular and you're still living like the devil, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; don't expect not even Jesus or an angel to ever come to your house. &gt;&gt; He'll only come where he's welcome. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The words amen in case you forgot it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I know. I know. I've been getting kicked at this whole service. Some There's somebody in here or people in here don't like what I'm preaching. That is too bad. You don't like it, go ahead. You can leave. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to keep you here. I'm not trying to joke you or laugh you or or or entertain you to keep you here. If you don't want to go on the rapture, then you're in the wrong church service. Cuz I'm talking [screaming] about only those that are dedicated to the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah [screaming] to God. Hallelujah. We want to be ready when he comes. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe the World Series got you more excited than this did. &gt;&gt; No thanks. &gt;&gt; Wow. I turned the TV on last night. Look at it. I've always liked baseball and I flipped it on a few minutes just to kind of see where they're at. [snorts] And I'm sitting there watching these people and this guy hit a big thing and they run to certain bases and jumped around all that. Them people were screaming. &gt;&gt; They were hollering. &gt;&gt; They had towels in their hand, brother. And they were going like this. &gt;&gt; I thought, my God, what a bunch of unholy rollers. &gt;&gt; But we come to the house of God. We hear the word preached. We hear the truth manifested before us. We feel the presence of God around the building and we sat there like an old bump on a pickle. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't mean quietnatured people. I'm talking about people that are stubborn and resistant to the moving of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; We ought to be worse than what they are. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz they'll finish that game as they finished it last night and then people will talk about it for a few months and that'll be it till the next season comes along. But we've been talking about this for over 2,000 [screaming] years, &gt;&gt; and it still should excite the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But some people will get so excited over a puff bag of air. &gt;&gt; That's their God. &gt;&gt; I teach some of these Europeans and some of these Chinese kids that's big on football. I don't mean American football now. I'm talking about football. Football &gt;&gt; and uh soccer. Thank you. and and and when the World Cup is going on, these kids will come in. They don't know any other English. Normally, I can barely get them to say two words. But when it comes to football, they are the most English- speakaking people I've ever heard in my life. &gt;&gt; They'll tell me stats and figures and who's doing what and how they did it and when they done it. I think, my lord, that's the problem. I just need to be teaching these people English through football. But that's become their God in this last day. &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul prophesied in the last day that would come those scoffers, &gt;&gt; lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; you'll be left sitting right here. &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing wrong with liking ball games or enjoying sports of some kind like that. I believe there's a balance to all of those things. Just like Christmas, just like anything else you look at, there is a balance to every single one. Oh, I hit the buzz word. Some of you anti-Christ people almost swallowed your gum. You shouldn't have gum in church in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, preach to me a little while. &gt;&gt; Right. But I'm telling you, brother, in the name of the Lord, everyone's got a balance to everything, &gt;&gt; but Holy Ghost gives you a right balance in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you don't have the Holy Ghost, you'll you'll go out of step and out of sync every time. &gt;&gt; Did you notice those last ones in Brother Ram's vision, the masterpiece, they got out of step at the end, &gt;&gt; but that didn't stop them from making it cuz there was a voice that told them to get back in line. Oh my, &gt;&gt; I never saw it that way before. &gt;&gt; They got a little bit out of step. [screaming] That's true. But just because they got out of sink a little bit didn't mean they weren't correctable. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean they wasn't teachable. Hallelujah. [screaming] That's the way it is with a child of God. Lord, I may be wrong, but teach me, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Correct [screaming] me, Lord. Help me get right with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yes, sir. It'll take that born again experience, washed in the blood of the lamb, &gt;&gt; sanctified, &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; or they'll never make that rapture. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. And from that time, could you get a little bit more of your time? &gt;&gt; And that's called from that time. When the church comes together in the resurrection, the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ will have to be in the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can't copy anything like it. &gt;&gt; You can't make nothing different from it. It's got to be the same holy soul &gt;&gt; that dwelt in Christ. And when the rapture comes, [screaming] when that body comes, his bride that was torn from him or the Holy Ghost will bring that bride &gt;&gt; and exactly dovetail. I love this word &gt;&gt; will dovetail right into the body &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, [laughter] &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm not so certain, but I'm not ready to speak your language, Jose. Oh, glory to God. Remember, we are trying to become the stature of a perfect man, [screaming] not men. &gt;&gt; This is not the stature of perfect men. &gt;&gt; This is the stature of a one perfect man. And there was only one [laughter] and that was Jesus Christ. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And his life, his spirit, his love, everything once it unites into the body of Christ, when the rapture comes, it'll perfectly tail. &gt;&gt; Oh, help me, Lord. Help me. All right, son. I'll help you. Uh, Jesus, I'm having trouble praying. I'll help you. Don't worry. I'm your advocate. Thank you, Lord. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; My faith will be his. &gt;&gt; Get this right. &gt;&gt; Not like his. &gt;&gt; My faith will be his. &gt;&gt; My patience will not be like his. It will be. M &gt;&gt; let me go a step further and finish it off. My [screaming] love will not be mine or like it, it will be his. [applause] &gt;&gt; Do you realize you can't forgive unless you've got that? [applause] &gt;&gt; And faith and forgiveness go together. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, if you want rapturing faith, you're going to have to have rapturing forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Mercy. I hope some of y'all are writing some of this down. Never remember it when I get out of here. &gt;&gt; Oh, [screaming] glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Again, in his eye, be not afraid. Since the days of Luther, they lived under justification. The days of Wesley, they came a little higher. The church become in the minority under sanctification. Then come the Pentecostal move which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the restoration of gifts. Now we're going above that. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; For some people you don't get no higher than the gifts. &gt;&gt; But the gifts are not the end of it. &gt;&gt; You know some people still have that idea. For them, the best that the bride can offer is some gift in the pull pit &gt;&gt; or a bunch of gifts in the church. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; I read it to you last night. Whether it be prophecies, they'll fail. Whether it be tongues, they'll cease. Whether they be good gospel preachers, they will fall. They will make mistakes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; So, how [screaming] much higher can we go? &gt;&gt; More. He said, "We're going above that to the capstone." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You see, that pyramid within itself is imperfect. &gt;&gt; And the capstone is a perfect pyramid within itself. Oh my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And without that, the rest Oh, [screaming] hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without that, the rest of it cannot be made perfect. But once he sets down, [screaming] &gt;&gt; the rest of it becomes a perfect. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm about to say something to you. I hope you're ready for it. Martin Luther hated the Jews, called a man of Christ, smoked pipes, and drank beer. Wesley hated predestination. Pentecost got off denomination and evidences. Amen. But where they were imperfect, &gt;&gt; that capstone makes them all perfect. Well, if it made them perfect with what little bit they knew. &gt;&gt; I said if it made them perfect with what little bit they knew. &gt;&gt; What about the [screaming] rest of us? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Preach to me. &gt;&gt; What about the rest of us? Imperfect human beings. But when he sits down, &gt;&gt; it makes me perfect. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; He said, "The church, the spirit that's in the church and the spirit that's in him has to be &gt;&gt; the same." Oh, &gt;&gt; brother. [applause] When &gt;&gt; I was in Jamaica, some of them saints would amen like this. Amen. M. I feel like saying the same thing. Amen. M. &gt;&gt; Glory [screaming] to Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what language to pick, but I want to pick one of them. [sighs] &gt;&gt; December of 59. What was the Holy Ghost given for? Now, we're going to show after a while that just those who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that rapture. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; That's right. The rest of the dead live not for the space of a thousand years. That's right. Just Holy Spiritfilled people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was all that went in the rapture. Next point, the rapture is the presentation of the completed elect. &gt;&gt; Romans 12:1 presents your bodies a living sacrifice that he might present it to himself. Ephesians 5:27, that he might present to himself. So present your body as a living sacrifice &gt;&gt; so that he can present it to himself. So what's the rapture going to be? The formal presentation of a completed bride. &gt;&gt; It's just like whenever somebody's getting ready, the preacher standing up there and everybody's standing up there and all of a sudden you hear that [music] &gt;&gt; everybody stops and they take Now listen close. Listen, listen. [screaming] Don't you fail this in the name of the Lord. They take their eyes off the groom and the preacher. &gt;&gt; The attraction changes from the groom and the bride's groom. The uh the advocate for the bridegroom. Amen. Uh uh the porter. I was trying to think of the word that Jesus called him. Amen. The one that would be like the best man. The one that stood by the bridegroom that prepared everything. Oh, &gt;&gt; when they hear that music played, &gt;&gt; the bridegroom might have come out and all those people might have been out there and they all might have been sitting, "Oh my, look at the groom. Look at his tux. Look how he is." All of a sudden, [music] what happens? Everybody stands up. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; And they see her come walking through. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The focus changes from the bridegroom &gt;&gt; to the bride. And one of these days, brother, one of these days, Jesus is going to come and he's going to meet us in the air. And the focus, Hallelujah to God, [screaming] is going to change from the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; To the bride. &gt;&gt; I don't want to scare you, but that's what God's been doing for 60 years now. preparing and presenting &gt;&gt; the wife of Jesus Christ. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say it's all about Jesus, but then Jesus would turn around and say, "Oh, but she's I'm all about her." &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You say that's impossible. No, it's [screaming] not. &gt;&gt; He said, "What sir is the attraction on the mount today? &gt;&gt; He's moved from the prophet &gt;&gt; to the prophecy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you are the reason &gt;&gt; for the rapture. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you. He is my reason for the rapture, but I am his reason for the rapture. [laughter] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to take it easy on me, Lord. You're about to kill me. [laughter] The prophet of God said that Einstein had discovered that if objects could move at 1 billion miles per second that they could pass through one another. You see CNN, Fox, MNS, MSNBC, all the Canadian channels, all the Africa channels, Jamaican, Trinidadian, all of the Hispanic countries and all of Latin America where they don't have a camera fast enough to catch Jesus when he starts moving. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he'll move faster than a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. And he'll move in such a way that only the bride will be looking for him. I've waited my whole [screaming] life to say to the devil, "Now you see me, now you don't." Cuz [screaming] one of these days he'll come down, swoop in here, and he'll take me out of here before you [laughter] could even blink your eyes and battle him. [applause] [gasps] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; In St. John chapter 14 2 and 3, he said, "It my father's house are many mansions. If it were not true, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you." This word prepare means to put in proper order. &gt;&gt; To arrange and make ready in proper order. You see what I am here matches what he's doing over there. [applause] &gt;&gt; In my new house, brother Jose, in the new place that I dwell, there will be no Netflix, Prime Video. There will be no gossip. There will be no this and that and internet chat rooms. And there will be none of that. My character here will match what's going on over there. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I was preaching the other night and I said, "If God gives a man the desires of his heart, my portion of the river of life will have D flowing through it." And after a church brother come by and he said, "And don't forget Taco Bell right next to it." Oh my. Praise be to God. Amen. It's going to be built. The prophet said he'll build it to [screaming] your liking and your specification. He already knows what you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So my life is a reflection here &gt;&gt; of what is going to be there. &gt;&gt; So he's putting everything in its proper order. Imagine &gt;&gt; the prophet said right now he's working on that city. &gt;&gt; And while he's working there, I'm busy working over here. Amen. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Making sure my prayer life is right. Making sure my heart is right. Making sure the things I do for God is right. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Let me read this and let's close. 1 Corinthians 15:51-52. Behold, I show you a mystery. You know what was a mystery to them is no longer a mystery to us. &gt;&gt; Paul could talk about it, but Paul didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not unless he knew something from what God showed him when he went beyond the third one when he entered that third heaven. God may have understood and showed him this and he wasn't permitted to say it. But there was not another person on this planet. John wrote about it and put it in the book of Revelation and the symbol was there, but John didn't understand it. Peter had the keys to the kingdom, but Peter didn't understand translation. Those other ones had great works of God, great God, great of God, but they didn't understand that. But where they didn't, we do. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Behold, I show you a mystery. Yes. &gt;&gt; And in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; the mysteries of God should be finished. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; That's why for people around this truth that that still look at brother Brandham as like he's optional, the message like it's optional. Well, I can have the Holy Ghost. I can be born again. I can get right with God and I don't need the message. You are deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; God didn't send that star to this age to light up just a certain portion. And God was only going to hold that certain portion accountable. That message was sent to this age. And the entire [screaming] world is responsible for what he preached. [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "If you even hear that there's a prophet in the land, you're responsible to go check it out." &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, &gt;&gt; there'll be those that won't hear these things and they'll have their own journeys and their own routes. &gt;&gt; But if you want to make the rapture, &gt;&gt; cuz you see, to be saved, all you have to know is Jesus by salvation. &gt;&gt; He can forgive you of your sins. He can forgive you and and and save wash you and save you. &gt;&gt; But if you want to make the rapture, &gt;&gt; you need to know the name William &gt;&gt; Brandom. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ben, be careful. I know where I'm standing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Obviously, you don't. That's why I'm preaching it. [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't you tell me that. All I need to know is the name of Jesus. Them first early Jews had the same idea. And Paul told them, "Follow me as I &gt;&gt; Come on. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You ain't getting all scot-free. You pulled this up. You pulled this out of my gift. And I'm going to deal with it before we quit." The message is what prepares us to get out of here. And if you reject the message of William Brandham, you'll be left sitting right here. &gt;&gt; It's not optional. &gt;&gt; It's not like, you know, when you go buy a car and they ask you what options you want. Well, I want power windows. I want warming seats. The message is not an option. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To get ready to go out of here and to meet to meet Jesus and the coming of the Lord. The message is essential. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad to see these preachers shaking their head. Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz we've got what what else could we preach? &gt;&gt; You listen to me. We had the Bible for 2,000 years and never understood what it really meant until Malachi 4, Elijah come and straightened it. Amen. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Until that prophet straightened it out. &gt;&gt; We didn't even understand what the book of Revelation was. &gt;&gt; Men had probed at it and probed at it and probed at it. Charles Taz Russell, the leader of the Jehovah Witness, had the bride, 144,000. &gt;&gt; Larkin believed in Trinity and had all kinds of other things going on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when Elijah come, &gt;&gt; he took a big step back. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he looked at all of these things. &gt;&gt; And he said, "My goodness, the body of Christ is the sickest body I've ever seen in my life." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She don't even know who the church is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She don't even know who the bride is. Well, look at this guy. He's saying the bride is going to go through tribulation. Well, my goodness. Where does he get that? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Do you realize this is the only man on the face of the planet with the only revelation that the people needed and nobody knew what he knew? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They had portions of truth. &gt;&gt; Cuz of course, the seventh angel had no specific message in himself. Well, so where was he supposed to get it? &gt;&gt; Pull it out of thin air? &gt;&gt; No. He went and collected all of the truths out of all of those lost ages, all of those ages that had partial things. &gt;&gt; Amen. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And when the seven seals came open, that's where he began to positionally place everybody. &gt;&gt; He said, "I no longer call you church. I call you bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cuz the church Oh, glory to God. Cuz the church will go through the tribulation period. That's right. He said that's that sleeping remnant, that sleeping virgin, that foolish virgin. But the wise, &gt;&gt; the wise [screaming] went in with him cuz they had oil in their lamps. [applause] &gt;&gt; They come to that 144,000. He said, "That's the Jews." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their names are on the Lamb's Book of Life. They'll receive two prophets. &gt;&gt; Did you ever stop to think about the type there, Billy Graham and or Roberts represented the two angels went down to Sodom, right? &gt;&gt; Did you notice after their message was completed &gt;&gt; that Lot I just heard it in the Bible yesterday? I was listening to the audio book and I was going up the road listening to my little Bible program and I caught something I never saw before. When the men come to the door wanting to bring those men angels out so they could have their way with him. &gt;&gt; Lot, he was just a penny anyhow. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He didn't have enough quality about him to be able to stand against sin. &gt;&gt; Cuz he wasn't like Abraham, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The Bible said his righteous soul &gt;&gt; grieved him, &gt;&gt; hurt him, afflicted him. &gt;&gt; He wanted to do the right thing and God recognized it as righteous. As I heard a few days ago, Abraham praying saying there, Lord, if there be 40 in the city, if there be 30. See, that's where a real believer does. &gt;&gt; No real believer wants to see anybody lost. [applause] &gt;&gt; I said no believer wants to see anyone go to hell. &gt;&gt; That's right. [applause] &gt;&gt; And God sent them angels down into Sodom. Did you notice &gt;&gt; after the message had been delivered, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord told Lot, "If you don't get out of here, I cannot bring judgment against this city." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, how about this little one? Isn't it a little one? I can go to that one, right?" He said, "Why sure you go there, but you've got to go because I can't bring judgment until you leave." Did you notice two angels brought judgment on the homosexuals? &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, it wasn't just homosexuals. It was perverted of all kinds. &gt;&gt; Well, I know I'm in Canada. I got to be careful because you got your little hate crimes and all that. I don't hate nobody. Let me be clear. &gt;&gt; And if Carney or Trudeau or anybody's listening to me right now, I don't hate anybody. &gt;&gt; I want to see them all saved. &gt;&gt; Or whatever big brother wants to listen to me. I want to see them all saved. &gt;&gt; But God reserves his own judgment for what he thinks is wrong. I don't have to say a word about it. &gt;&gt; But these two angels begin to speak and judgment fell upon that perverted city. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And here we come all the way to the end time. We've had an Abraham &gt;&gt; who turned his back to the people. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; God discerned through an ham. Right. The angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham. Why'd Sarah laugh in the tent? Is that right? &gt;&gt; We've seen that last sign that come before what? Before the change of their body. Yes, sir. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right after that, what do you have? Moses and Elijah in Sodom &gt;&gt; with the power of the sixth seal to speak &gt;&gt; to speak fire. Those two angels. Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah &gt;&gt; right down in Sodom. The type was laying right there in front of my face all these years and I saw it to just yesterday. &gt;&gt; The two witnesses will bring judgment. &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. Elijah was raptured up because God loved that spirit of Elijah because it was obedient &gt;&gt; and because he was faithful to the truth &gt;&gt; and he loved that spirit so much. God would not allow Elijah to be killed. &gt;&gt; So he took him up in a cloud. &gt;&gt; And do you know what made Elisha the man he was? When he saw Elijah caught up into the cloud. &gt;&gt; You might as well sit down. Obviously I'm not done preaching yet. &gt;&gt; Sit down. Go on. I'm not done yet. You keep pulling. I'm going to keep preaching. We ain't there yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But do you realize that Elisha seeing Elijah caught up was when the mantel fell back on him. Same thing in this hour when we see our Elijah caught up in the opening of the word. That's where the manel falls on us. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And God loved that spirit of Elijah. When Elijah, Elisha, John the Baptist, Brother Brandham, and it connects and continues over into Israel &gt;&gt; with Elijah the prophet. [applause] &gt;&gt; They torment those people so badly. The Bible said when they kill them, they lay in the streets for three days and they give gifts one to another. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then the spirit of life enters back into them. &gt;&gt; Guess what happens? Guess what happens? They're caught up &gt;&gt; into a cloud. &gt;&gt; You have the three raptures of the old, three raptures of the new, with Jesus being the keystone right in the middle. &gt;&gt; That connects both of them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If the only way to be a part of the bride was you had to hear the message of your hour, &gt;&gt; right? The people that wanted to be bride in Luther's day had to hear Luther. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The people want to be bride in Wesley's day had to hear Wesley. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you think we're going to be bride &gt;&gt; if we don't care nothing about what Brother Brham taught us? &gt;&gt; You're going to have to get back to studying &gt;&gt; what he said. Cuz you know we got we got too many preachers that are professional quoters. &gt;&gt; That's all they know. They couldn't preach if they wouldn't say the Bible said the Bible said brother said brother. What about inspiration? &gt;&gt; There must be some inspiration in what you're hearing &gt;&gt; to be able to minister to the people what was said. &gt;&gt; And if I'm going to say what he said, I've got to say it in the same inspiration he said it in &gt;&gt; or I'm not saying it like he said it. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; We got too many preachers now that they think rapturing faith. Okay, I'll just read it and you believe it and that's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; if we don't have some inspiration, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; if we don't have an awakening within oursel, &gt;&gt; no matter how much you read, &gt;&gt; study, or listen, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; when Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; you'll be left sitting right here. Now I'm done. Let's stay. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm just a troublemaker. I think I think that's all I &gt;&gt; That's all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. either listening to me today, if you know your heart is not ready for the rapture, if you know after listening to what I'm preaching today, perhaps you didn't even understand much of what I said, that's fine, I have to preach to the Christians in here, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you're standing here this morning and in your heart, you know, you're just not ready to meet Jesus. &gt;&gt; Would you be honest enough with God? Now, bow your heads. Close your eyes. No, everybody. Just real reverend. The reason I want you looking around is because somebody might think, "Oh, somebody might see me." And they won't put their hand up. This is pretty serious for me. as a Christian, as a preacher, it's pretty serious for me. I I want everyone to feel comfortable. So, please just just give everyone some privacy in your heart. You know, cuz see, friends, you don't realize sometimes I preach things like this and preachers get under conviction, put their hand up. That's hard for them of a congregation looking at their pastor doing something like that. They start think, well, something's wrong with him or whatever. But I want you to be able to be honest. No matter where you at, &gt;&gt; no matter what occupation you might be, &gt;&gt; no matter what position in the church you might be, if you hear me this morning preaching and you in your heart, you're convicted and you know, I'm not ready to meet Jesus if he comes. Would you slip your hand up to the Lord? God bless you and you and you. You and you and you and you and you and you and you. My goodness. Now, remember, I'm not talking about you with the Holy Ghost that you're just struggling or having problems or just having difficulties. I I don't mean you Christian people now, but those that are not born again. You know that your life isn't converted and you know that you just battle the world all the time and desires of the world all the time and &gt;&gt; you struggle, but you just don't know what the next steps are and you don't know how to Well, this is how you this is your next steps. Just put your hand up to the Lord and say, "Father, that's me. &gt;&gt; I need salvation. I need to be saved. I need to be sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost. I need to be converted. &gt;&gt; God bless every hand." Now, perhaps you're your backslid on the Lord or cold or something. Maybe you'd just like to say to the Lord Jesus, "Father, as I stand here today," Lord, I I I don't want my life and my heart to be some kind of scandal or some kind of constant misstep. Lord, I want to rededicate my life. Many come here last night. I was so happy to see preachers and everything come up here want to rededicate their life to the Lord Jesus. And so maybe you wasn't here last night or maybe you're just hearing this today and you want to say, "Brother Ben, I've just lived such an awful life and been so out of touch." But can I remind you the first song I sang to you tonight? That very first one I sang this morning. All you have to do to Jesus is just say, "Please forgive me, Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they can be white as snow. &gt;&gt; If you're some of those Christians or confessed or potential Christians, I'm talking about running around everything in the world smoking and vaping and drinking and cussing. And some of you men and women alike. I've seen it on both sides. Not just men, but women just as addicted to things like pornography and social media sites to where they're flirting with men and women alike and doing all kinds of ungodly things. Or some of you sisters may be sneaking around cutting and trimming off your hair or wearing makeup or something like that. Do you know that according to God's Bible, you cannot enter heaven like that, sister? Brother, if you're just mean to your family, your wife, you're just a dictator and everything's got to be your way and you're just some old hardhearted hard-headed type thing and rule your home and weaponize the quotes and just live and rule in fear. Do you know the Bible said, "My brother, you can't go to heaven like that." Maybe you're someone sitting in the sound of my voice &gt;&gt; that needs real forgiveness in their heart towards someone else. You're holding some bitterness or some grudge. My Christian brother or sister, do you know that the Holy Ghost will not allow you to do that? How can you love God whom you say you've you have not seen and not love your brother whom you have seen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you women running around doing things in the goal of you man doing it and then turn around and let your family get away with the same things. If the angels won't visit you, how can Jesus? &gt;&gt; You're going to have to repent today and make your heart right. Are you hard-hearted and become so stiff-hearted that nothing moves you, nothing affects you? Well, I can do a few little things and dip and lie and cuss and oh, don't bother me none. If that's the condition of your heart, my brother, the Holy Ghost, you have not. Sister, if it's gossip all the time and you stretch your ear to hear every old filthy thing about the church or the pastor or somebody else, don't call yourself the name Christian anymore until you get that straightened out. cuz the angels of the Lord will not visit you and Jesus will not come for you if that's the condition of your heart. And some of you listening to me right now, you listen to me good. You may be receiving your very last o last opportunity to get this straightened out. So don't you take this lightly. Take it seriously with everything that lay within you &gt;&gt; because brother Bram taught us that we don't know when the rapture could come. Jesus could come before I finish this prayer for you. &gt;&gt; You want to be ready. &gt;&gt; I wonder again maybe I'll make another call just in light of how the Holy Spirit's leading me. There'd be more in here that would just say, "Brother Ben, you're right. The Holy Spirit's right. What you're telling me is true. I've got these things in my heart and I need to be right with God and I want to put my hand up. I'm not ready in this condition like I am. Let me try it one more time now. Raise your hand to the Lord who feel that way. &gt;&gt; Sure. There we go. I'm going to pray for you now. Jesus sees every hand that is raised, whether in the back, in the front, in the middle, sound room back there, or the piano over here, or the music behind me, or even the little ones over here in this fellowship hall, or those that are streaming online. God sees every hand that's going up. Heavenly Father, it's the most important thing cuz you told us what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul. We don't want to be like that, Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't want the pull of this world to become so great. We don't want the effect and the a effect of this world to become so strong that we lose our love and our desire for the things of God. If we have no vision for ourselves, we'll perish. And all we can do, Lord, is put the word before us. Let that be our guide. Let that be our vision. that our hearts can be right before you. If our homes aren't clean, &gt;&gt; if our lives aren't clean, &gt;&gt; you can't come for us. &gt;&gt; I pray for every hand that was lifted that said, &gt;&gt; "I'm not ready to meet you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not ready to meet you, Jesus. I pray for every hand." &gt;&gt; God, may your Holy Spirit visit them right there where they are. You don't need a passport to go to them like I did to come here. &gt;&gt; You don't need to go through some travel person or some gate agent or some kind of border patrol. You don't even need anything except for them to open the door as it was wrote of the little picture that the artist put together. And the man criticized said the only problem with your Jesus standing at the door knocking is there's no knob on the outside. He said, "You see, sir, the knob is only on the inside cuz he cannot come in unless you open the door and invite him." Father, may these that had their hands raised, Lord Jesus, may they open up &gt;&gt; grab that knob inside their heart as it were and turn it and open up the doors to welcome you into their life. &gt;&gt; They may not be able to solve every problem they got today. They may not be able to put behind them every memory and every sin and every wrong. Maybe they've got cleaning up to do. But Lord, if you'll just let them somehow, if they'll just open up the door to you and you'll just come in there and help them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are the problem solver. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and may you move into every heart &gt;&gt; into every life. &gt;&gt; And may you do your great work. I pray Lord Jesus. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, &gt;&gt; but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, &gt;&gt; whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. Oh Jesus, whether we go by the way of the grave or whether we're translated, &gt;&gt; let us live in you. Pray you'll move on every heart &gt;&gt; and every life &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord. I wonder if those that you had your hands raised, maybe you'd just like to raise your hands up to the Lord and say, "Thank you, Father, for touching me." &gt;&gt; All of us have got something to praise. All of us have got something to be grateful about. &gt;&gt; I want each of us just to thank the Lord in our own way. Can you &gt;&gt; hallelujah? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Get us a song ready there, will you, sister? Anything you want.
