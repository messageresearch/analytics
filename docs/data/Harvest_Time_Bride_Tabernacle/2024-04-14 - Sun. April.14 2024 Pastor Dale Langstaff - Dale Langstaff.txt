cuz he had two other offers out of London and they were as good or better and uh he said you know I really felt like the Lord wanted me working for you and I don't know what his religious background

privileged to be here just uh pray you just remember me this morning I just feel amen thank the girls for their special they had no idea what I was preaching on this morning and it was uh really wonderful amen and uh just a few announcements Junior's coming on Wednesday um most of us know Junior and so if he's not busy he might even preach next Sunday That'll be amazing I'd have a whole whole Month of Sundays off in a row God is very good amen but we pray for his safety and all these things and um also just uh a Jared's testimony it was a lot better than he said OT it was a lot better and he said you know God can do anything anything at all that's right I happen to be a part of that operation a little bit and many of the cattle we sold we got two to four times what we paid for in December two to four times yeah that's that's you know when you're just part of God you know it's just he just he knows what he's doing you know amen also we we mentioned about uh the world event amen and brother Dale lives it I don't just preach it because I told you last Sunday I'd actually considered selling a farm not that that will matter whether it's uh but uh Iran any anybody's heard this knows this maybe Iran for the first time in history since Israel has become a nation has bombed Israel they bombed them yesterday or today missiles and uh so there's so there's an update with that am I is my mic on I can't hear myself uh so first off with Israel's war in the Gaza Strip Biden they had some human I'm just telling you they had some people there feeding the people and they got killed and Biden said if you don't bring in humanitarian Aid we're pulling all our pulling all our support sounds like prophecy to me and then uh within a day because things are going fast uh you know there's things going over there and we're not going to get into it in great detail but but Iran has bombed Israel directly it's the first time ever that they haven't went through terrorist groups and so Putin has went on record and Biden he said if you think you're going to support Israel and we're not going to support Iran you're having a dream said if you bomb Iran with Israel we're bombing Israel with Iran and I have those videos on my phone for anybody like to see them and I'm just na even enough to believe part of these people and I'm telling you we're going to go home very soon it's just it's just you don't have to believe me but it's going to happen it's going to go happen and also we want to pull up a a picture whenever you want Amy just along that same testimony we were blessed to uh we we did cancel church on Wednesday but we were able to get our U on the wheat when many people didn't but God is very very good and this brother here is a good friend of mine and I'm preaching today because of what I talked to him about in the Ottawa convention in November or October he preached the message for I think over 50 years he's he's African he was born in Zimbabwe I believe he moved to London England and he died instantly at his church on Wednesday and left a family and a church with a big surprise no Pastor no husband no Daddy I don't believe he had been sick a day in his life and but you know I remember Peter Chandler the easy way to remember him would be this everybody that was around him was more important than him that that's just that's just how he was made and that's just how he lived his life he will be there I'll guarantee you and if I could be him I would be he was a great great man of God and uh and we thank God for his life and being able I you know I had some questions about going to the convention but I'm sure glad I was there now you know sometimes we wonder why we didn't get pictures you know I talked to him privately I talked to him with Len I seen him not privately that you know I never got a single picture in the picture with him but uh it don't matter I was his friend and I remember when we started the when God started our church 10 years ago it's over 10 years now and we were at John Dan was for a big International Convention there was preachers there from all over the world literally that is the truth when they preached that International conventions they had three preachers preach in one message correct three I believe they timed them and we went over to Brother jun's house of Filipino Brothers and there was a hundred people there there was some of the most popular preachers in the world were there Peter chander came and sat with me amen amen I told the man when I went upstairs Wednesday night I said I'm a little jealous it wasn't me I'd rather be there in him be here amen amen I I really believe we're going home soon and these brothers that are going are going to come and knock on our door and if I'm still here when they come and knock on their door I'm me tell you what brother Dale is going to lose his mind I just tell you right ahead of time I'm going to completely lose my mind amen let's stand amen I talked to Peter Chandler about this in Ottawa convention and I want to preach on prayer man it's a girl special was very timely now we're going to turn to First Peter or sorry second Peter 2 verse three 2 Peter 2 verse three and we'll just read one verse and you can have your seats man if you remember Peter Chandler remember his family and his church amen he was a very very unique Pastor he had a very very unique gift you have never heard if you've never heard him you've never heard a man like him ever he would put up one verse he'd say wow that's pretty special and he put up a quote he said that's pretty amazing he exhorted on that he put up another verse and in about 30 minutes he'd say well I think we're getting almost done he'd close the service man he went all over the world many preachers all over the world all over Africa many places I talked to this oh yeah he was here he preached for US 35 years ago 25 10 talked to Pastor Bartley Pastor Bartley said I preach for him a couple years ago and he preached for me like 5 years ago manen amazing Brothers amen hallelujah amen amen before we read our scripture you know this message I'm preaching to myself this is not geared to this church this is not geared to any single individual so don't take it personal you can throw all the eggs at me it'll it might I don't want it to come across like that it's not God's intent it's not my intent amen and through cons covetousness shall they with foreign foreign feain words sorry make merchandise of you whose judgment now is long time lingered not and their damnation slumbereth not Lord Jesus we pray you'll add your blessing to this word and bless your bride of Christ in a supernatural way Lord Jesus just many out but bless them too Lord Jesus and we pray that you'll be with the ministering of the word Jesus in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats we see here that Peter is talking about that they will make merchandise of you now I I love the message Hub and pray that God will bless the people that made it but brother Brown never commented on this exact verse but he had commented on two verses before it but he commented six times on the very next verse and the next verse it talks about you know uh false prophets and different things we're going to read a couple scriptures later down but I want you to in the Bible it talks about false angels and it said if God the next well maybe pull up the next verse I don't have it in my iPad it said for if God God spare not the angels that sin but cast them into hell and delivered them into chains of Darkness to be reserved for judgment amen we can go back to our other scripture am or we're going to jump ahead to verse 20 actually but uh here the Bible's talking about angels that God didn't spare and brother Bram commented to that because of a prophet he had Insight that we don't have and he said these Angels were men he said they were Messengers actually he said they were preachers and if you and the Bible's talking here about false prophets and false preachers and there's people that are preaching the word false and God will take care of them people and here the Bible talks about them as Angels but God never spared the angels in heaven and brother Brown breaks that down and we're not going to go into that cuz that's not we're preaching on but he talks about the language there and how it's an A and it's meaning men and it's meaning Messengers meaning ministers ministers that have been false brought false word Andor made M merchandise out of the people and I want to tell you something this morning church is not about a business and it's not about popularity it's about God it is about God it's not about who's your pastor any amen it's about God it's not about this building it's going to burn down someday I hope not till I'm gone but you see what I'm saying and we're living in a world if you're not in a church that they're and I oh I pray you that's not the case here but if if you're not in a church that's making merchandise of you you're in a world that is and if you think you can work hard and get rich you're having a dream you're having a complete dream I was telling some minut nights down there I said you know well you're just having a dream I'm not going to go to that because if you make anything the government takes it and if you the government don't take it then you give it to all the merchandise of Walmart and and uh in Amazon and Hollywood before that let me just read a quote to lay a foundation this this was my last quote so I'm preaching the end of my message we can go home I said oh Church leave Hollywood uh Delila he's talking about Samson alone she'll take your soul he's just talking about Hollywood the world the system the system will take your soul this a prophet that believes in predestination this is a 63 quote by the way he said she's going to kill you it's not the the Delila it's the spirit they've made merchandise of us all you're either buying Hollywood videos or you're buying stuff from Amazon that you don't need or you go to Walmart and you buy something you don't need and it will kill you and she's this is the spirit the spirit is choking the spiritual life out of you there you go this a prophet that had predestination he didn't he didn't make no disclaimers for that the spirit this this this Delila spirit is choking spiritual life out of you leave her your Hollywood Showmanship on the platform your Hollywood your tensil your meetings that has to got to be so just just got to be all in an evangelist come to town you have to promise him so much money or he won't even wholeheartedly to God and the word let's cry out once more Lord show us your presence and here here's here's the prophet talking about we are becoming merchandise of other people amen now we we must live in some country so we will have to you know obey by those merchandise laws but God help us when we're making choices that we're not just becoming merchandise of where you shop and where you live remember I talked about just making payments to John Deere or New Holland amen you can you can and I there's nothing wrong with having whatever you need I'm not preaching against Goods or not not at all but if you're living if you're working for your own kingdom your new car your new truck or your new house or or your new uh entertainment center or even your new entertainment center in the church if we could get a better entertainment center here and and you know what I mean then you're become merchandise your property of somebody else's because you can be bought you can be bought amen what's your price for your soul what would you give for your soul in exchange for your soul and the whole world and and God helped me because brother Dale deals with this also and so let's just drop to verse 20 and it says for if after they had escaped the the PO the help me out honey pollution of the world through knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome and the L matter is worse with them than the beginning that sounds like people that knew God but were really tied up in the world events I mean in their job in their Walmart in their shopping in their 700 pairs of shoes or whatever they got it'll be different for each one of us that's amen and verse 21 for it had been better for them to not have known the way of righteousness that's pretty powerful then after they had known it to turn from the holy Commandments and delivered unto them been delivered unto them but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb that the people have turned to the vomit again and the s to the wallow in the mud the dog has turned to the vomit now that scripture is talking about Believers and you become a Believer and then you know you like a nice car and you like 20 pair of shoes or or whatever it is or you like 700 movies and you're just consumed with the latest of whatever it is and you become merchandise you're selling your soul and that spirit is killing your spiritual life brother Brown said it will actually take your life get away from her amen and I want to show you uh exactly where we're going on this brother Brown said I wonder if we're I'll tell you ahead of time we're not we're not I'm not even you know we preached on worship and this is kind of the same way you know David was a man after God's Own Heart and there was too many prayers for me to write down I never even counted them too many prayers that David prayed in a in a worship song type of way you know we don't have to put God in a box prayer ain't just like you know standing in a corner or you know or kneeling or you know you can pray and sing you can pray and worship you can you can you can do all the kinds of things and that's why David was and and literally literally literally we've been doing some of them in Wednesday night and there was sheets of prayers in the Bible from the prophets but David had the most prayers and most of them were wrote from songs but you know you know and and so I got disclaimer this is not the case here I feel extremely love more than I would even remot remotely deserve from you people so I'm I'm preaching to myself but you know we don't ever want to get that we have to be good anybody can sing is special anybody can preach that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen uh anybody can lead son Sunday school that's got the baptism of The Ghost and got a heart for it you know what I mean Jesus preached on the hillside it's not about the steeple or it's not about the gold in this building and or you see what I mean it's not about those things he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed do you know we read the scripture last week he said David said or Peter said before they were going to kill Peter he said all I can do is bring the word of God into your remembrance but you know I wonder many times and and believe me the devil reminds me of this quite regularly uh said you know you preached that 10 years ago or you preached that or you know the people have heard that for 50 years I wonder if you're sufficiently impressed with God Jesus that's what the prophet said in the perous church age he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I wonder if it like we're like well there's no way Jesus Is God because I know his parents so I'm still looking to where the Jews are he said let me give you a thought here he said how do we pray he said we pray in jesus' name don't we he said every prayer in his name or is there or there isn't any answer yet in John 1 maybe you can pull that up Amy in John 5:14 he said we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if you ask anything according to his will he will hear us and if we know that he hear us then whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desire of him now we asked what is the will of God he said there's only one way to know the will of God and he said that's by the word of God Amen it don't matter how that word of God comes it's still the word of God Amen and we're because you know never before you know when I was a kid when you went into the Arenas the the the puck boards were white but we have so many distractions because everything is screaming By Me By Me by me you know and you go to the grocery store for milk but you'll leave with a package of cookies a pair of socks an iPad uh you know maybe a snorkeling tube maybe even a canoe because they have everything y that's right and then next month you get the Visa bill and you go golly Matthew 6:1 19-21 it says lay not up for yourself Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust th corrupt and where thieves do break through and steal but lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven where neither moth or rusters corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal for where your treasure is there's where your heart will be also amen and and you see like I know you've heard that longer than I've probably been alive some of you but it's still the truth and it it listen I we're not preaching about owning things that we need or you know we would freeze to death and and but we're just saying like our our thought pattern our our we merchandise whose merchandise are we are you God's merchandise or are you Hollywood's merchandise or are you Walmart's merchandise or you Amazon's merchandise that's a good question for us to ask this I want to mention on prayer and I want to read it from two two uh or three standpoints I want to say how much should we pray how should we pray and we'll get to the third one here I want to read three or four quotes where brother Brown talks about how much should we pray friends you may laugh too much you may talk too much and you may walk too much but you'll never pray too much I would that men would pray everywhere lifting up holy hands another one he says with your prayers I sure I'm sure that we'll do our best that we can for the glory of God and Prayer Changes Things prayer changes death to life prayer changes sickness to health prayer it changes a sinner to a saint it's prayer he said if you laugh too much you may sh too much and you may eat too much but you'll never ever pray too much but the Bible says I would that you men would pray everywhere lifting up holy hands so he said you will never ever pray too much here's another one he says he said you might eat too much you might drink too much this is a 65 quote 65 218 you might drink too much you might laugh too much and you might walk too much so he's not even talk promoting exercise but you'll never pray too much I would that man would pray everywhere and so we're going to look into some scriptures and say well how much should we pray how much is enough prayer you know you can be in a a meditation of prayer and you know prayer ain't about just I mean it's wonderful to be gathered in church but your whole B your whole life can be prayer you know when you you know brother Bart sends me videos all the time he's driving he's got music playing prayer praying preaching praying and that your whole thought pattern is around God God Amen but the World's Screaming out there education screaming out there jobs are screaming the governments are screaming everything's so loud in your head you know you can come and pray and not say nothing just sit and have your thoughts on God you know when you call on the phone are you always the one talking do we ever stop for God to talk dear father pay my bills pay my taxes that they came they're huge this year and God you know I need this and I need that I and God help me and save and God but who's talking on the other end I'm cutting off everybody amen including God Ephesians 6:18 let's pull this up Amy pray always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watch watching there onto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints that's Ephesians 6:18 always always brother Garth has mentioned you know his job he he's got a lot of time alone so he can spend it with God and he can listen to the message he can read his Bible but he could even pray because you you're in you have that ability amen what do you listen to when you're going down the road what's your train of thought do you ever pray for your kids do you ever pray for anybody or you just pray when you need money merchandise 1 Thessalonians 5:17 pull this up Amy 1 Thessalonians 5:17 now this is a new testament by the way this what we're living well that's a long verse pray without ceasing Jesus Luke 18 1-5 you know if somebody don't pray enough brother Brown's going to answer that but it's because it's we're geared to Hollywood there's no flashing lights there's no whistles there's no train there's no excitement you know what do they call those movies that are like uh you know action-packed what's the action in prayer if I come to the church and I'm here all alone and I sit here for an hour and walk around and pray for one hour there's no Hoopa unless it's me hooping myself I'm not here here for nothing else here in Luke 181 and we're going to read 1: 5 and then 7 to8 maybe I'll tell you when we jump and he spake in Parables unto them to this end the man ought always to pray always but God I got two jobs God my taxes are due the end of April but God I got 15 kids or verse two saying there was a city there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded men and there was a widow in the city and she came unto him saying avenge me my adversaries and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself no here's Jesus given a parable and he's not just giving chatter but we don't believe this brother Dale don't I I I want to think I do but and I I try to but do we by our actions do we and here's Jesus showing us something he said but afterwards he said unto himself this King he said though I fear not God nor do I regard this woman at all I could care less about her she's bothering me yet because this Widow keeps coming to me she's making merchandise of me she's taking up my time I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she w bear me out now this is a guy that could care less about the woman and could care L about God he's just flat out selfish and he's selfishly thinking in his mind she's using up my time then we have a god let's jump to seven and so not God avenge his own lacked uh-oh which cry day and night unto him though he bear alone with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find Faith so he still find us praying what God's saying is if you come and you bring your petitions you know the Bible and we're going to go into that you know God's changed his mind because of Prayer amen God God is we're connected if you're part of the family of God you know you if anyone's a father here have you ever changed your mind because of the kids you knew they shouldn't have the ice cream but when you know when brother Dale said they should get it you know I'm I'm just you know what I mean you know like I know there's a better way but oh just this one time all right you don't think God thinks like that he does cuz he we we have examples of this but he's saying what when when you're his elect that means you're connected you're a part of him so you're you're his right arm and you're telling God the body saying I want a wave but the body says no no don't wave at them we don't like them but the hand says I want to wave anyway and the okay wave what are we his elect amen yes for sure we are Hallelujah God will be touched there there's a purpose in prayer a strong purpose in prayer but because of the the the the environment that we've raised up in you know when when when me and brother G were born it was a lot Tamer than it is now you know we still had the rotary phones and no cell phones internet what's that computer it's as big as this Pulpit I remember the first one came in the library it was about this typing if you took eging in high school when I was going through everybody looked at you like now everybody tapes if you took taping in high school you were going to be somebody's secretary and I was going to be a part of that operation amen look in chronicon Corinth how do I say that Chronicles 4 two says continue in prayer we can go to the next one the same book in Chronicles 1:9 I might be saying that wrong cuz I'm c o o SS i a n claan sorry Colossians 4:2 says continue in prayer Colossians 1:9 says for this cause we also since a day we heard don't cease to pray for you to the desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge and the will of all wisdom and understanding wow now we get to where should we pray and how let's go to Matthew 6 Matthew 65-13 and and God Jesus himself God himself is going to show us how and where to pray Matthew 6 starting verse 5 he said when thou prayest Thou shalt not be like the Hypocrites are for they love the Hollywood they love to pray standing in the synagogue and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen am men but verily I say unto you that they have their reward verse six but thou when thou prayest enter into the closet and when thou H has shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when y pray you don't have to know all the words but when you pray use not vain repetition as the heathens do for they think because they're heard by their much speaking verse eight but be not ye therefore like them for your father now see now we're connected to your daddy your daddy knoweth what things you have need of therefore you ask him before you ask him but he still likes you to ask him after this manner therefore you pray Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name verse 10 thy kingdom come and thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debtors as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory you notice that prayer was all about God it was his kingdom he was the father it was about his glory glory it was about his will and his kingdom coming and you see here that is when God's teaching us how to pray that if you're a Believer and and these things aren't happening we need to check our life and we need to see who we've sold out for and who are merchandise is amen and if the Bible says that things will happen when you pray and these things don't happen what could be the reason it's we know it's not that God's a liar we know that it wasn't a short fall of God it has to be within ourselves cuz we know God's word can't lie and we know God can't like so he said what's wrong and I'm glad you asked cuz our Prophet told us what it was and I I'll tell you where we're at in this after but in this uh quote well here I can tell you it was Abraham and his seed after him it's a 614th month quote he said all the ministers today he said we're having such a hard time to get the people out to prayer meeting on Wednesday night they love their television programs and they love their watches amusements now now I I I'm going to stop here again again like I know that we have a unique situation in our church some of you are driving away some of you live farther away than we ever deserve for you to ever come and we work in shift work we're not throwing the eggs at that amen we're just looking at this Spirit they love their amusements Sunday they don't want to come to church on Sunday many of them they tell me the ministers tell me that the church's pews are empty and emptying out because the people are beginning to go and the world offers so much glass and so much fancy and so much T tenso that the things of the world that the people are falling for it and I'm not saying that we are falling for it but we're affected by it because the world and everything is making merchandise you know if they were going to build a store if they were going to put a Tim Hortons in Wyoming or or a Walmart in Wyoming they would see how many people are here and they would calculate the merchandise of the people living here that are going to become property to them uh-huh they don't build Walmarts in the desert amen not there's nothing wrong with going to Walmart but are we selling our soul for these fancy things he let's continue here he said now the shows that are at now that shows that at the beginning he's talking about these people that are affected by the world fancy let let's go back and just the tinel of the world and and the people are falling out and the fancy and the class and they they offer a better class the world the pews are emptying out even on Sunday he said now that shows that at the beginning they had nothing to start with now that would be really hard on the tape Library church because the very same Prophet said they never had nothing to begin with for if you love God you couldn't I couldn't you couldn't wire you away from church he said they couldn't chain you away from coming to church he said they couldn't hide a Believer from God now if he's in your heart and you're part of the family oh you might be all deceived now there's many people that actually think that they're all right now we're living in a world like that you know you know this is definitely is not affected to us but you know we just came past Easter and I I see things and I'm connected you know just like you do and there was a very Evangelical Church that on the Sunday before Easter they had the front all decorated with palm trees and bunny rabbits that have colored eggs and the pop was the pulpit was completely covered up this is Sunday morning and they had the kids come up to get a dra lie the bunnies don't have eggs that are colored blue and yellow and then they left the sanctuary this is evangelical church and they went out in the yard and helped the kids find the magic of a bunny that has an egg that's colored the Bible says there will be no Liars in heaven there won't be those kind of liars that's for sure how in the world did this happen what in the world does that have to do with the Sunday morning church service that ain't us now but the Bible says if God would carry will I even find faith on the earth these places that are doing it they would have never believed on it 25 years ago not even close a million miles from some of those same places people run the aisles when they got blessed under the real anointing of God Amen so it would do us to be cautious amen hallelujah let's watch here where he goes amen and there's many people that actually believe think that they're all right but if you don't stop and watch your life you'll see that the spirit of God isn't there you know it affected me when Peter Chandler died I know I'm not like him everybody that's around me are they more important than me wow see see how God's spirit can be so Dynamic you know when we were just there I'll show you something this is a man that's preached for like over 50 years when he we went to a pastor's only dinner in in cubec somewhere we're in Ottawa and he comes by me now I'm the kid I'm the new kid he's a pillar he comes by me he says brother Dell pray for me he said I'm preaching tonight would I have done that to him or was I just had the ability to preach you see the spirit wow wow God God help me forget about you God helped me God saved me if there if it doesn't cope with the Bible then there's something wrong with the experience that's in you have so you must come back and line up with the word of God and see if your life lines up with God now just one more paragraph 56 and he said if you love the world more than you love prayer meaning if you'd rather watch the television program than pray there's something wrong with you he said if you'd rather take a Sunday afternoon and D ride instead of go to church there's something wrong with you because your heart is where your heart is because where your heart is there's where your treasure will be also said the Lord Jesus and your heart is built into it see you if you're part of God you're you're built to communicate with God I don't care if you're in the barn and you pray it's not about prayer ain't the qualifications of prayer ain't closing your eyes the qualifications of prayer ain't kneeling down amen and you can to have a humble Spirit you can bow on the prayer the qualification of prayers could be driving the big maic wide open with your eyes paying attention to all the idiots on the road but you can still be praying amen the qualifications of praying ain't talking all the time you got to let the other person on the other end of the line talk once in a while he said if your heart ain't built into it you're a part of it you're you've become a part of Christ because you're built into the structure of Christ because you're the bride of Christ if you love him that's if you love come to prayer then you're you're connected you're you're just right into it because you you is it amen God help us amen amen okay so we we looked into how often should we pray and how and where should we pray but the last thing I want to look at is are we Believers when we pray John 1413 and 14 and we're going to close on these verses here this is a powerful thought we might have a a quote in here but a powerful thought here and whatsoever you ask in my name that I'll do now that's that's straightforward so it if if you ever pray and it's not answered there's a problem and the problem ain't God you know the Bible says if your heart condemns you not is everything right you know God has the prophet said this said if if your heart condemns you he said God has no obligation he's no connection to you at all so whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and if you ask anything in my name now he repeats it why would he repeat it why would Jesus Christ repeat himself the very next line he don't actually say it's got to be a big name preacher he just says if you pray it's finished boom let's move on what's the next object Mark 11 24 actually let's go to 23 Mark uh 23 I didn't put that scripture down so I got to wait for you Mark 11:23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain that you be now this is Jesus in the Bible this this ain't the prophets this is actually the the Son of God say this mountain that thou shalt be removed and cast into the SE and thou shalt not doubt in thy heart but shall believe that these things which thou sayest shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sa wow that's that's pretty heavy duty if you really think about that let's go to verse 24 for therefore I say unto you what things whosoever you desire When you pray and you believe you already have them and you shall have them do we are we believers do we actually believe that you know I'm give you an example of the Believers in the Bible Peter was in jail and there was a whole bunch of message Believers in their house they prayed for Peter God answered their prayer just exactly like this scripture Peter just walked up this is before the baptism of the Holy Ghost had come and this was before the perfect sacrifice had come they were still killing lambs and goats just covering up the sin the sin that the desire of sin hadn't even been taken away yet so like my goodness imagine what we could do and Peter came and he knocked on the door and they sent a little girl they sent Leah to go answer the door and Leah come back and said he's there what I want you to watch the scripture the Bible says they sent little girl and she said God answered the prayer he's there and the Holy Ghost filled Believers the the mature Believers the seasoned Believers the Holy Ghost hadn't been given yet but you know what I'm saying the seasoned Believers looked at the childlike faith and said you've seen a ghost I want to just ask you something is see spirits don't die so we're exactly the same today would have it been easier for that girl to see the actual Peter or to actually see a ghost who would have made the ghost see they believe that God could have made a ghost of Peter but they didn't believe God could take Peter out of the jail that's a new kind of a religion which one of you can think about your ghost and make a ghost and stand at the door so they believe that God there's no way God's going to do what we want because that's that's just not even a possibility but got to do something else so you seen the ghost yeah we we're the same way we're the exactly the same way if we're not careful wow wow amen God help us they're already yours see if you're connected only you and God know if you're connected only you and God know if you came from God Only You you only know brother Brown said when we pray it softens our spirit it changes us we're not the same anymore you can't go into prayer and walk out and be the same person you never see a hard person walk out of a prayer thing and it's not about show you know the Bible talked about fast and if you were going to fast don't tell me about it don't tell me you so wash your face it's not about a competition oh bless God I I pray three and a half no no just 35 I come and I wanted to pray an hour but I quit early I was tired who am I telling this to why am I telling this amen Luke 119-13 God help us God help us to we we we we're going home and we have to recognize Our God you know you know I mentioned to you about and I did something that was unbelievable you know I'm not just preaching I'm living it you will your life will change you you know we you know I mentioned to some of you we we considered we called a couple people about selling a farm and and I told L man I said I felt like God give me a flat no flat no just but I didn't like the answer cuz I already had it in my mind I had the money I already spent I'm just being I'm trying to help you so I called the real estate agent I said this is what I want she said you'll never get it God had already told me that I know you just don't do that that's just me I'm still praying through God has another way so then he takes cows that you pay $1,500 for and sells them for $4,500 because he knew that all along but I didn't believe him it was a ghost I seen a ghost huh you're no different than they were they walked with Jesus hello luk 119 and I say unto you ask and it shall be given now that's just straightforward seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open to you it it there's no disclaimer except that your heart condemn you not are you a Believer are you the elect are you come from the father are you part of the father and it shall be open unto you for everyone that receiveth he it's he that seeketh and findeth and to him that knocketh shall be open unto him and if the son shall ask bread of any of you fathers will you give him a stone or if he shall ask a fish will you give him a serpent but or if you shall ask of an egg and you will offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil now how to give good gifts unto your children how much more does your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him it's not hard for him but do we believe not hard at all here in Matthew 21:22 and we see in the scriptures before this maybe we'll read it we got time let's go to verse 20 Matthew 2120 I didn't put two of these verses down I just I'm kind of pulling it out of context to go in prayer but here here are the disciples where Jesus is is teaching them to pray that's what Jesus is doing us today but they're not getting it they're walking with the Lord Jesus and when the disciples saw they marbled because oh golly I mean I read the Bible I mean I went to a message church for years but I wondered where God was I don't see nothing now watch this the disciples were right with Jesus how could they live with Jesus they slept with Jesus but they marbled marveled wherever Jesus was there was always miracles there was always noise and miracle Les so what were they marveling about they seen more than we'll ever see the disciples Marvel saying how soon did the Fig Tree wither away and Jesus answered and said unto them very very I say unto you if you have faith and don't not you shall not only do this but do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say to this mountain be removed and cast into the sea thou sh it shall be done now watch the next verse here the disciples marveled I want you to I want you to get that in your head like how could you do it God Jesus said all things whatsoever you ask in prayer we pray but we don't expect it brother Dale don't many times do we really think it's just it's just done if he ask and pray are believing you shall receive it amen Mark 11:21 let's moving faster here we got to we got to move on Mark 11:21 and Peter calling into remembrance the same scripture about the Fig Tree which was car and it withered away and Jesus answered and said unto him have faith in God verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be remember moved and cast into the sea and shall doubt not in his heart but Shall Believe these things which shall come to pass whatever so he saith therefore I say unto you that whatsoever things you desire wow I desire a couple things like deci side the church and you pray When you pray believe that you receive them yeah yeah that's right that's right I wonder if God like the church sided you know I'm not trying to make this a joke this is the Bible it's very simple it's it's we're stretching our faith how big is your God Amen let's look at some quotes where the Prophet talks about this he said so there therefore that's the reason said the prayer of the faith shall save the sick and an individual's prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous male man availeth much oh if you only knew that in your hand Christ gave you the authority with his name by being a Christian the most powerful weapon that the world has ever known prayer and if even it even changes everything it'll change the mind of God and I it did it it did do it after the death was pronounced to a man and he prayed and God's Prophet had to go back amen we're going to read that scripture in Isaiah here another quote he said now I appreciate your prayers Prayer Changes Things and there's only one thing that can change the mind of God and that's prayer you know I want to throw something out to you sometime and I won't do it unless God tells me to but I've had the thought go through my head I said you know we've had a lot more people coming on Wednesday night I've been preaching on Wednesday night so one of these Sunday mornings would we have a full house I'm not going to preach we're just going to all pray I bet you a lot of you would be shocked he never said we got these things by preaching you never said we got all these things by preaching you can actually preach too much he said that in church order and Doctrine 25 to 35 minutes shut her down a lot of people should read that quote amen you know what I'm saying you know when I was a kid when I was a kid and we never had the light of the age that we have now you know we never had a prophet when I was a kid it wasn't recognized to me yeah and we'd come to church and everybody on that side and everybody on that side we sech front and one person on each side would pray out loud and when they stopped the person beside them was next they started praying and next and next and next and next and next till the very end the pastor prayed when we went home oh bless God oh we got to have we got to have a well-known preacher we got to have I never read that scripture I never read it anywhere I never read where he had to have a turnaround collar and a big education and be a dynamic speaker said pray just pray oh bless God we're going to let the preacher pray I have more faith in these kids praying than I probably have in my own prayer you don't think so when God never when our shed was on fire but the fire wouldn't burn in the shed it was Silas that prayed with Patricia in the car fire they don't burn I don't have to read the Bible about the the testimonies in their Bible I can read my own Bible the shed's on fire but the shed don't burn nothing's lost and there's no claim and there's no even repair bless God and there was no big preacher that preached and there was no big preacher that prayed but Silas and Patricia in the car I wasn't praying I was going like a maniac huh oh bless God that's not the format we're thinking maybe we missed the format what what what did we read the quote he said we're expecting something on the platform like a good operation on the platform bless God we're going to vote this pastor out we got one that's a lot more flang bant you don't think think that happens that's why the prophet talked about it amen God help us hallelujah I don't know where he stopped here there's only one thing that changed the heart of God was prayer and that's a pretty good bit to me isn't it that's the truth he said prayer changed is everything he said you know prayer can't change he said you know prayer can change the mind of God these are all different quotes multiple zillions of quotes I only took the simple ones showed simple prayer is the most powerful weapon other quote he talks about this they can that's put in the control of a human being there's more atomic bombs and more hydrogen bombs and none of them are as powerful as prayer he said prayer will change the mind of God did you know that it did so Isaiah 38 Amy you know some of us and I I don't want to know but you you go home and you ask God I'll I'll guarantee you that some of us I hope not but I'll guarantee you there's some of us here today that actually sit in a week service and listen to more preaching then they do praying the whole week you listen to two hours of preaching and I'll bet you there's people sitting here that don't pray two hours all week you listen to an hour and a half of me talk and a half an hour on Wednesday but you don't pray two hours because that would be like you have to pray like 20 minutes a day 15 minutes a day you don't pray any on Sunday because you're getting up to go to church like you don't have to pray that day because everybody at church is going to pray for you I I wonder hey I don't pray Sunday morning unless it's like God help me strength me I mean you know what I mean like pray I mean other than pray for the service cuz I'm coming to the service the world's trying to make merchandise of you property buy my movie buy my high heel shoes let's go to the and none of these things well some of them let's go to the gym buy a ticket for the gym when you could come and work for brother Dale just Square Bal it'd be free but see they make merchandise the Gym's fancy you can stretch and and do sit-ups at home for free but no we're going to pay for it we're going to pay and go to a place where there's bare naked people when you can do chin up put your feet under the couch and have somebody sit on the couch and knock yourself out jump on the floor and do a 100 push-ups like they do in the Army you don't have to pay anybody to do push-ups yeah go to Walmart you need mil you come over there with a Zony TV or something because like it was 50% off I would have been crazy not to buy it merchandise Jared was looking at Machinery the other day we deal with this all the time I'm getting gray hairs for a reason he was looking at Machinery he said Dad it's it's free it's it's almost free I said Jared we have more Machinery than we have land if they give it to you what would you do with it but but it's free it don't M free it's going to rest it's going to sit and Sh and rest you don't have nothing to do with it but see how we think it's a lie of the devil and we're just spinning our wheels and God's up there crying because he put it all right here watch this Isaiah 381 how do you say this guy's name honey who's it Hezekiah and in the days of Hezekiah he was sick unto death and the uh Isaiah the prophet went to him and saith thus sayith the Lord that he had the spoken word you know brother Braham said this he said when God tells me something I say thus sayith the Lord that that's that's the word of God that's the Bible that's what the prophet said here like that I mean if if a if somebody came to me and say thus sayith the Lord You're a dad man next week I'd pretty much believe it not in this case thus sayith the Lord set your house in order for Thou shalt die and not live and when Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the Lord and he said now remember Lord I beseech thee how I have walked before thee in truth and was a perfect heart and have done th which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept sorely and when it came then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah now he was still on the train leaving from telling him thus says the Lord You're a dead man you know can you imagine if he took a flight the ticket was paid to the other end he whoa whoa lay the plane stop the train get me off I'm going the wrong way the word of the Lord came to Isaiah that sounds like somebody that don't know what they're doing it's not the case at all it sounds like a father that's touched by the pain of his kids it's a father that cared go and say unto Hezekiah thus sayeth the Lord the god of David thy father that I have heard thy prayer and I've seen thy tears and behold I will add onto thy days 15 years and I will now now watch this he he he only prayed for life but I I I I was I literally had already put this verse in my iPad and I changed it and I took it out God couldn't just do that part now he had he had thus sayith the Lord you get me okay he said I will had 15 years to life but God God was so much turned by his motivation of prayer and he couldn't he that's all he'd asked for but God was on a roll that was coming down the mountain and he couldn't stop and I will also deliver thee and thy City out of the hands of the king of the Assyrians and I will defeat this I will defend this city and this shall be a sign unto thee the from the Lord that the Lord will do this thing that he has spoken and behold I will bring again the Shadows of the degree this degrees which is come down and the sun in the Sun and and he lowered the Sun by 10° backwards also the sun returned 10 10° by which degrees it had it was already down you know last or a couple Sundays ago we talked about watching the signs you know the this brother he never asked for that he never asked for them to save the city but God probably figured up there he said what good is it going to be if I give him 15 years extra and then the enemy comes in and Spears them with a spear so I got to like overprotect them amen Hallelujah God help us do we believe this do we believe this are we Believers how often should we pray we have everything right but prayer everything right Wow Let's just finish on the quote I read first and we're going to close Just Once More Time Lord 63 oh Church leave Hollywood dalila she's going to kill you she's choking the spiritual life out of you leave her your Hollywood Showmanship oh bless God on the platform your Hollywood your tensil your meetings that has got just to be so the preacher got to just handle it so and walk just so and wear the right uniform and all got to be in a great baked Church like the rest of the world it's got to be one of the biggest and come how ridiculous shows where your treasure is your heart's there turn turn from this and show us your presence turn turn wholeheartedly to God and his word and let's cry out once more Lord show us your presence let's stand amen God help us God help me you know we're we're so digitally programmed how things we think always have been but who said that amen who said that it's just our our it's like a carryover of religion that well we've always done it this way is that because God wanted it done that way God help us prayer the greatest weapon that we have we don't need a bunker we need prayer amen we're at a going home time and it's going to be a prayer praying people that are going to go home I don't mean from a I don't mean from a a sadducee and Pharisee standpoint that you know it's got to be you know there's people that have prayer on the internet and they will have and and and that's fine it's not evil it's their what they believe in but I don't I don't believe in it because I've never seen them yet invite a child to pray or a sister to pray they always hire the most popular preacher in North America to pray and I can't sit in front of my computer and pray under the anointing of God because our Prophet said God will never use mechanical devices that's for the tape church too it's on scriptural to have a big shot pray online it's on scriptural God said to pray in your closet pray the prophet said the prophet said I didn't read that quote the prophet said brother Brown said he said when you pray alone you pray differently see if I pray here on Wednesday night that that's that's the truth for brother Dale if I pray here on Wednesday night I'm I I pray differently because I'm more I'm more pronounce to name every name just right and every you know and not forget a name and all this but if I pray when I'm here alone God knows my thoughts that you thoughts are your families are just running through my head and say oh got to be with them be with them oh be brother Brown said you pray differently how H who would pray pray poorly when they're praying being video camera to go on the internet if you did they'd never have you again but who decides
