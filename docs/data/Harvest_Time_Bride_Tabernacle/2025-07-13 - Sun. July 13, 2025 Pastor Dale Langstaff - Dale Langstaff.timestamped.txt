[26:49] those songs, Lord Jesus. Thank you for
[26:51] the revelation that you gave us in this
[26:54] day to know who we are, Lord God, in
[26:57] you.
[26:58] Lord, I pray you'll be with every soul
[27:00] that's represented here today. Lord,
[27:03] meet every need that's represented.
[27:06] Lord, you're the great provider.
[27:08] Whatever the need is in the body of
[27:11] Christ, Lord God, you've already
[27:12] provided it. And Lord, we welcome you in
[27:15] this place. And Lord, we pray that
[27:18] you'll speak through your word to your
[27:20] bride today and bless them, Lord Jesus.
[27:23] Help us recognize
[27:25] your plan for us, Lord God. We pray your
[27:29] beautiful name. We pray. Amen.
[27:33] Amen. Amen. Maybe you can be seated just
[27:36] for a moment. Thank you, musicians. Man,
[27:39] just uh couple of announcements. Um just
[27:42] uh next weekend uh John Dana
[27:46] uh in Missaga has special meetings. It's
[27:49] a brother preaching from South Africa.
[27:53] So there's two services on Saturday.
[27:55] There's a Saturday at 10:30, there's
[27:57] Saturday at 700 p.m. And then Sunday
[28:01] morning, it's at 11:30. It's quite a bit
[28:03] later than our service, but I would
[28:06] highly encourage anyone that could go to
[28:10] go. I actually strongly considered
[28:12] cancelling our service here,
[28:15] but I'm not going to do that. I'm not
[28:18] going to do that because of the
[28:19] visitors. We've had different visitors.
[28:22] See, we were out this week and we were
[28:26] at a bread bakery and I was talking to
[28:29] the the owner, the man that bakes the
[28:31] bread and and he was talking about
[28:33] church and I give him a card and uh you
[28:37] know this week when I was meditating on
[28:39] what to do with service, I felt like God
[28:42] just said like this. He said, "What if
[28:45] they showed up and you weren't here?"
[28:47] Amen. And we've also had Steve and uh
[28:51] the other brother from Jamaica come and
[28:53] different ones. But uh so we are going
[28:55] to be here. But if any of you are
[28:58] missing next Sunday because you're at
[28:59] John Denquas, you sure got our support
[29:02] and condolence and and different ones.
[29:04] We we're actually encouraging to go and
[29:07] me and Lan will be there Saturday
[29:08] morning.
[29:10] And uh so we just believe that that's
[29:14] Scott's will for this time. Amen. Also,
[29:18] after that, camp's coming up very
[29:19] quickly. We just can we coveret your
[29:21] prayers. It's uh well prepared, but just
[29:25] uh that God would help us have a
[29:27] wonderful time in his presence. Amen. At
[29:31] that time, Amen.
[29:33] Amen. So, next Sunday, and man, if you
[29:36] want any information, talk to us, look
[29:38] at the flyer. You can look online or
[29:41] contact us. There might be different
[29:42] ones going. If if one or two wanted to
[29:45] go together and go as a ride or
[29:47] something, it would be a real blessing.
[29:49] It shows our support and friendship to
[29:51] them. They're a bunch of them are going
[29:53] to be at our camp also. And and it's
[29:55] just a beautiful relationship. Amen.
[29:59] Amen. Amen. Let's just stand and we read
[30:01] the word. I'm going to turn to Joel 3
[30:04] and read 14. And I want to preach on
[30:08] I want to preach on right in the fence.
[30:13] I want to preach on riding defense.
[30:18] And I really believe
[30:20] God has something for us today.
[30:27] You know, this is God's word right here.
[30:31] And that's powerful.
[30:34] The only thing that'll never pass away
[30:38] is God's word. and
[30:40] multitudes multitudes
[30:44] in the valley of decision.
[30:48] For the day of the Lord is near
[30:51] in the valley
[30:53] of decision. Lord Jesus,
[30:58] I pray that you can use this vessel to
[31:02] show your people what you revealed and
[31:05] just showed unto me, Lord God, from your
[31:07] word.
[31:09] and all will be blessed. And we praise
[31:11] your name for it. In your name. Amen.
[31:13] You may have your seats.
[31:16] Multitudes,
[31:18] multitudes in the valley of decision.
[31:21] Jeff, will you turn the lights on there?
[31:22] Bottom switch right there.
[31:25] And the day of the Lord is near.
[31:29] And we know the day of the Lord is near.
[31:33] And there's multitudes of us in the
[31:35] valley of decision.
[31:37] And you know in our in our message and
[31:40] in the Bible, you know, we know
[31:41] Ephesians, the first chapter of
[31:43] Ephesians, we know Romans 8 talk about
[31:46] predestination and and we believe in
[31:48] predestination and being elected and
[31:50] called and all those things. But our
[31:52] prophet taught us that if you push
[31:55] predestination or election in the wrong
[31:58] way, you will bring disgrace on God's
[32:01] word. And you can be 100% predestinated
[32:06] and elected
[32:09] this morning. And I believe you are, but
[32:12] you still have to make a decision.
[32:15] You can't ride the fence. You can't just
[32:17] say, "Well, I'll be just wherever God
[32:19] wants me to be, and I'll just, you know,
[32:22] I can't change my decision." That's
[32:24] that's completely a lie from God's word.
[32:27] God's actually changed his mind. His own
[32:29] word. God told Prophet, you'll die. and
[32:31] and he prayed and God changed his mind.
[32:33] Give him 15 more years and multiple
[32:35] decisions like that. The very first
[32:37] character we're going to look at in the
[32:39] Bible was God would have gave him grace.
[32:43] And you know, God is not looking for a
[32:46] bride that's right in the fence. He's
[32:48] not looking for a bride for him to make
[32:50] all the decisions. You know, God said to
[32:53] Moses, he said, "What do you say?" He
[32:56] said to our prophet, there was times
[32:57] where he said to our prophet, he said,
[32:59] "I'm waiting to see what do you say."
[33:01] You know what the prophet when the young
[33:02] couple in the service when when they
[33:04] told him before that they have a trap
[33:06] set for you. Amen.
[33:10] It was people it was his decision to
[33:12] pass on grace.
[33:14] I wonder what we would pass on today to
[33:16] somebody that was misbehaving in the
[33:19] church of God. Would we pass on grace or
[33:22] we pass on judgment
[33:24] just to fill our religious
[33:27] esteem or our our our position what we
[33:31] think. Amen. Multitudes. Multitudes in
[33:34] the valley of decision.
[33:38] The day of the Lord is near. In the
[33:41] valley of decision. Let's look over just
[33:43] to lay a foundation. And we're going to
[33:44] look at multiple characters in the Bible
[33:48] that had to make decision. in Joshua 24
[33:53] and we see here
[33:57] multip uh Joshua 24:15
[34:01] 15
[34:03] actually let's read 14 for therefore the
[34:05] fear of the Lord and he served them with
[34:07] in sincerity and truth and he put away
[34:10] the gods which were the fathers and
[34:12] served the other side of the floods in
[34:14] Egypt and serve ye the Lord and here
[34:16] verse 15 verse 15 If it seem evil to you
[34:22] to serve the Lord,
[34:24] then choose you this day.
[34:27] Who you going to serve?
[34:30] Amen.
[34:32] Even though we have predestination, God
[34:34] still expects you to choose. God still
[34:36] gave you free moral agency.
[34:40] Who you going to serve?
[34:42] You can't ride the fence no longer.
[34:46] You know, brother Baron preached
[34:47] messages on decision. You have a
[34:49] decision. Everything in your life is a
[34:51] decision. And sadly, most decisions
[34:55] are made out of fear.
[34:58] You won't take a risk.
[35:00] Most decisions
[35:02] are made out of fear. First Kings 18 and
[35:05] 21.
[35:08] And Elijah came to all the people and
[35:10] said, "How long will you halt between
[35:13] two opinions?"
[35:16] God's saying that today.
[35:19] We've halted a long time between two
[35:23] opinions.
[35:24] If the Lord be God,
[35:27] let's give him all we got. But if Balum,
[35:32] then follow him.
[35:34] And the people answered him.
[35:38] Not a word.
[35:40] See, the people that Elijah was coming
[35:42] to, they were right in the fence.
[35:46] Oh, wow.
[35:47] They were right in the fence. They
[35:49] didn't want to decide between Balum and
[35:51] God. They wanted both.
[35:55] But this God that we serve, he was
[35:57] either number one or he ain't even in
[35:59] the picture.
[36:03] Amen.
[36:04] That's great.
[36:05] Help us, Lord.
[36:07] You know, your silence is a loud no.
[36:11] Your silence is a loud decision against
[36:14] God.
[36:15] You can't ride the fence.
[36:19] Amen. I don't mean to be arrogant or
[36:21] rude,
[36:22] but what did the prophet Isaiah say? He
[36:25] said, "For me in my house, this boy's
[36:28] going down serving the Lord."
[36:34] Amen.
[36:37] In the valley of decision here, Brother
[36:39] Bram said, "While you're making
[36:41] decisions, you decide.
[36:44] Why halt you between two opinions?"
[36:48] Here's a prophet that believed in
[36:49] predestination.
[36:53] But he taught every service
[36:56] that you need to decide.
[36:58] That's right.
[36:59] You know, you'll decide in your life.
[37:01] You'll decide whether well you know you
[37:03] might not make many decisions when
[37:05] you're young but you'll decide when
[37:07] you're growing up maybe will I go to
[37:08] school or not go to school secondary
[37:11] school why I get a job or be lazy will I
[37:14] marry or not marry will I have a family
[37:16] or not married where will I live will I
[37:18] move a million miles away from my
[37:20] parents where will I work
[37:24] I serve God
[37:26] and how will I serve God you know the
[37:29] whole world is serving Not.
[37:33] Well, just go out to the grocery store
[37:34] and ask anybody, "Are you a Christian?"
[37:36] I'll bet you nine out of 10 people would
[37:38] say, "Yes."
[37:42] But will you serve God with your whole
[37:44] heart?
[37:47] Will you serve him in everything you can
[37:49] do? You know, the Bible talked about
[37:50] giving to God until there just wasn't
[37:53] nothing to give.
[37:55] I don't mean money. That means your
[37:57] talents, your life, your strength. You
[38:01] know when you are weak, God is strong.
[38:03] You say, "Well, I I just don't have the
[38:05] strength to do that." But God can do it
[38:06] through you.
[38:07] You just stand up and God will make you
[38:09] strong. You say, "Well, I don't have no
[38:11] ability." God gave you're insulting God
[38:12] cuz God gave you your talents.
[38:15] Amen.
[38:16] all these things where you choose you
[38:18] know when you come to and and I don't I
[38:22] I want this to be positive but you know
[38:25] you can tell somebody's choice by how
[38:27] they value something you know when when
[38:30] you're coming to a marriage of your wife
[38:32] I'm just going to say because I'm a or
[38:33] you know your your your fiance or your
[38:36] wife you know you spend a lot of time
[38:38] with her buy her a lot of flowers and go
[38:39] to a lot of restaurants
[38:41] but when your love grows cold that all
[38:44] goes away you don't buy or nothing. You
[38:46] never go to the restaurant and you work
[38:49] like a maniac and you never spend time
[38:51] with her.
[38:54] Why did you marry her?
[38:56] Why did you make a commitment to God to
[38:58] not spend no time with him? You know, do
[39:01] you go to work more early than you go to
[39:03] church? Brother Bam said that you would
[39:05] never miss church for work, but you can
[39:08] miss work all the time for church.
[39:11] There's none of us believe that.
[39:14] We say we believe the prophet.
[39:18] But see, your dollar that you're working
[39:19] for is depreciated like millions of
[39:22] times. And now, you know, I was I was
[39:24] watching a I read a thing uh you know,
[39:27] on the internet. They said in in ' 65, I
[39:30] believe it was. You could buy a house
[39:32] for a bar of gold. They said you can
[39:35] still buy a house for a bar of gold
[39:36] today. The bar of gold ain't changed
[39:39] any. It's still just a bar of gold. But
[39:41] your number ain't worth nothing. So go
[39:44] ahead, work hard. Their doors open, Tim.
[39:46] Go ahead and work as hard as you want
[39:49] because it ain't worth anything.
[39:51] The house that cost 70,64
[39:54] costs a million3 today,
[39:58] but you're making lots of money.
[40:01] But in Venezuela, they don't bend over
[40:03] to pick it up. They use the the sweep
[40:05] the street sweepers to pick up the
[40:08] paper. Yeah.
[40:11] Street sweepers to pick up the paper.
[40:17] Amen.
[40:19] In this message, we've pushed
[40:21] predestination and election so much that
[40:24] people think they can just do nothing. I
[40:26] believe I can sit home. I don't have to
[40:29] go to church. I don't have to support a
[40:32] church. I can come whenever it's
[40:33] convenient. I don't have to give. I
[40:36] don't have to sing a special. I don't
[40:37] have to. I don't pray for anybody. I
[40:39] never prayed for the service ever in my
[40:41] life.
[40:43] Never put forth anything. Never never
[40:45] done anything. Never shovel the snow.
[40:47] Never clean
[40:49] because because I'm elected. I'm
[40:51] predestinated.
[40:53] Genesis 4 3-7. Here we see here that in
[40:57] the process of time it came to pass that
[41:00] Cain brought a sacrifice of the fruit of
[41:02] the ground and Abel brought a sacrifice
[41:04] of the first thing of his flock and the
[41:08] Lord had respects to Abel offering but
[41:12] to Cain's offering he had not respects
[41:15] and Cain was very wise and his
[41:17] countenance fell. And then in verse six
[41:19] and this is what I want you to catch.
[41:21] And the Lord said to Cain,
[41:26] I believe, let's just rephrase that. And
[41:28] the Lord said to us this morning,
[41:34] why art thou wroth?
[41:37] And why does thy countenance fall? If
[41:40] thou doest well,
[41:43] thou shalt not be should thou not be
[41:45] accepted.
[41:47] God gave Cain a space to repent.
[41:54] Cain was right in the fence.
[41:58] Cain made a decision
[42:01] to not serve God.
[42:04] Cain could have been safe
[42:08] 100%.
[42:11] This is God talking to him.
[42:19] If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
[42:21] accepted? Of course you would be. But if
[42:23] thou doest not well, sin lith at the
[42:28] door.
[42:32] Amen. Sin. Let's go to Acts five.
[42:37] And we see here Acts 5 and and uh we're
[42:39] going to read 19.
[42:42] Maybe we'll start at 17. Vicki, Acts
[42:45] 5:17. But here we see the twel apostles
[42:48] and they had been out and they were
[42:50] preaching in Jesus' name. And it was a
[42:52] new doctrine
[42:54] because many
[42:57] were still under the law and didn't
[42:59] believe in the grace of Jesus and
[43:01] salvation.
[43:03] And here the high priest rose up and
[43:05] they seen that they were in the
[43:06] synagogue and they were furious. The
[43:09] religious people were furious because
[43:12] the apostles had made a decision to
[43:15] serve Jesus
[43:16] and they took them and they threw them
[43:18] in prison.
[43:21] Verse 18, they threw them in prison and
[43:23] the angel of the Lord came to him and
[43:25] opened the prison doors and brought them
[43:27] out and said, "Go speak."
[43:32] Oh wow. I thought I didn't have to say
[43:34] nothing for God. Verse 20 says, "Go and
[43:39] speak in the temple to the people the
[43:42] words of life." See that the apostles
[43:44] couldn't ride the fence.
[43:48] But I I'm not gifted. I'm not called. I
[43:50] don't I don't even have a church
[43:51] building.
[43:53] I don't have a place.
[43:56] Nobody's supporting me.
[43:59] I just left prison.
[44:06] Let me let me ask you something. If you
[44:08] had been put in prison for disobeying
[44:10] the government of the land doing
[44:12] something, would you went right back out
[44:14] as soon as you get out and did the same
[44:16] thing again?
[44:18] Just think of CO
[44:21] and any of the CO laws. If you had got
[44:24] your bank account frozen and they let
[44:26] you out and not froze your bank account,
[44:28] would you go right back out and do the
[44:30] exact same thing again?
[44:34] They did.
[44:37] They did.
[44:40] But we wouldn't
[44:43] cuz we're educated.
[44:48] And you know what they said there? You
[44:50] know, you can read this all in this
[44:52] chapter.
[44:54] I don't have it.
[45:01] Maybe we'll drop to verse 40.
[45:05] Actually verse 28. Sorry. And here here
[45:08] when they they went right back out to
[45:10] the temple, they started preaching in
[45:11] Jesus' name. Now that was an order of
[45:13] God
[45:15] and they were rearrested and they said,
[45:18] "Didn't we not tell you to not do this
[45:22] and preach in God's name?
[45:24] Didn't we like what are you not getting?
[45:28] But see, God was looking for a decision.
[45:32] He was looking you're in the valley of
[45:34] decision.
[45:36] Choose you this day who you'll serve.
[45:38] They couldn't ride the fence.
[45:42] You know, if you jump down to verse 41
[45:44] and they departed from the presence of
[45:46] the counter rejoicing because they were
[45:49] counted worthy
[45:51] to suffer shame for the name of Jesus.
[45:54] They went right back out. But if you see
[45:55] this in here, they Oh, actually verse
[45:58] 29, Peter answered and the other
[46:00] apostles answered and said, "Ought we
[46:03] not obey God
[46:05] rather than men?"
[46:08] But see, God was looking for a decision.
[46:14] God wasn't looking for somebody that's
[46:17] right in the fence. If it if you're just
[46:20] right at the fence and you go whatever
[46:22] the decision is of least resistance,
[46:26] you're not going in the rapture
[46:29] because there'll be hard times before
[46:31] the end and you'll go the way of least
[46:34] resistance. So you'll surrender.
[46:37] Amen. 1st Samuel 17, we see here David
[46:41] and verse 32. 1st Samuel 17:32. And
[46:45] David said unto Saul, "Let no man's
[46:47] heart fail them because of Sam, because
[46:50] of Goliath,
[46:52] cuz thy servant will go and fight the
[46:55] Philistine." See, David had nothing to
[46:59] do with Goliath. He was a squirt.
[47:03] He was a little kid.
[47:05] He wasn't even to the age of
[47:07] accountability yet.
[47:13] But his mom and dad had raised him well.
[47:19] And he knew the promises of God. And
[47:22] that uncircumcised Philistine was
[47:25] blaspheing his God. And David refused
[47:30] to be silent. And let me just tell you
[47:33] what, it was all uphill for David
[47:35] because his own brothers attacked him.
[47:39] His own brothers said, "You're just
[47:41] showing off. if you're just putting on a
[47:42] big show and why don't you go back and
[47:44] just smell like the sheep and go watch
[47:46] the sheep in the pasture you little
[47:48] squirt.
[47:51] But there was enough people around that
[47:52] they went and rehearsed the words to the
[47:56] king.
[47:58] And David said, "I'll fight him
[48:02] because God delivered me from the lion
[48:04] and the bear and he'll deliver me from
[48:07] the hand of this Philistine."
[48:10] And so Saul said to David, "You go and
[48:14] the Lord be with you."
[48:17] But I'll tell you what, if you were your
[48:19] children today,
[48:23] just think of your children, would you
[48:25] support them to fight Goliath?
[48:30] No. God's got an army. He's got the
[48:32] Israelite army. Why? God's supporting
[48:34] the Israelite army. Why does he want my
[48:37] little kid?
[48:41] God was looking for a decision. He's
[48:44] looking for people with a backbone
[48:47] that'll make a stand.
[48:51] Amen. Rebecca,
[48:54] let's go to Genesis 24.
[48:57] And we see here in verse 55 here his
[49:00] brother and mother which were a type of
[49:02] the preacher in the church. They said
[49:04] let let Rebecca stay with us just a few
[49:07] days. It's no big deal if we we don't
[49:11] really serve God with all of our heart
[49:13] all the time. Like let's take a holiday
[49:15] for 10 days.
[49:18] Like I mean she's going to be gone
[49:20] forever.
[49:25] Yeah.
[49:26] Yeah.
[49:27] Amen.
[49:29] And Eleazar, Abraham's servant, said,
[49:31] "Hinder me not, seeing the Lord has
[49:33] prospered my way, that I may go to my
[49:37] master." Like, you know,
[49:41] that would have been a hard decision.
[49:45] You're saying goodbye to your daughter.
[49:46] They never had like uh video calls then
[49:49] or, you know, all these things.
[49:54] It wasn't like they were going to see
[49:55] him very often. Probably about once a
[49:56] year in the camel. Probably never again.
[50:02] And they said, they said, "Well, we'll
[50:04] call Rebecca and we'll require of her."
[50:09] And they called Rebecca and said unto
[50:11] her, "Wilt thou go with this man?" And
[50:12] she said, "I will go.
[50:17] I will go."
[50:20] You know, Isaac and Rebecca was a
[50:22] perfect type of Christ in the church.
[50:24] Christ and the bride, but Christ has got
[50:27] a lot of bride represent saying their
[50:29] bride. But they're not saying, "I'll
[50:31] go."
[50:33] because she left all her comfort,
[50:36] all her wealth
[50:38] to go through a desert of robbers
[50:42] and pirates
[50:45] on an air conditioned Campbell
[50:48] with no water
[50:50] and the ice supply would run out and the
[50:54] water of leather jugs. Can you imagine
[50:57] what that tasted like? It would have
[50:58] just been just like drinking out of a
[51:01] copper jug.
[51:03] Not hardly.
[51:07] She was with her mom and her dad. She
[51:10] was on easy street.
[51:12] Yeah. Yeah.
[51:14] And she never It wasn't even her fault
[51:16] that she had to make the decision. But
[51:18] God had moved her to a place and a
[51:22] position. And God's moved every one of
[51:24] us to a place and a position where you
[51:27] can't sit on the fence no more.
[51:30] You got to say, "I'll go." And if you
[51:33] don't answer, it's no
[51:38] well things happen.
[51:44] Genesis 6, we see here Noah,
[51:48] God was so distressed because of the
[51:50] earth, Noah 13, that the end he was
[51:54] going to judge the world and send a
[51:56] flood on the world. And God asked Noah
[51:58] to do something completely ridiculous.
[52:01] And if you don't think so, you need to
[52:03] take a trip down to see the ark and
[52:05] you'll see how big it was. They never
[52:07] had cordless tools by Well, they were
[52:09] cordless, but they were powered by hand.
[52:11] Yeah. Hand tools.
[52:14] And to think that God would ask one man
[52:18] to build an ark and it had never rained
[52:21] before. He He needed counseling. He
[52:25] needed a lot of counseling.
[52:28] No. And if you drop down to verse 22 of
[52:31] Genesis 6 and it says, "Thus Noah did
[52:34] according to all God had commanded him.
[52:38] So did he." See, Noah didn't ride the
[52:42] fence.
[52:44] Amen.
[52:46] Multitudes, multitudes
[52:49] are in the valley of decision,
[52:52] and the day of the Lord is near.
[52:56] In the valley of decision, you know, and
[52:58] and and we're going to go into more
[53:00] characters, but Kadesh Barnea was a time
[53:02] when Israel came to Kadar Bernnea and
[53:04] they had to decide if they were going to
[53:06] serve God or go into the promised land.
[53:10] And you know, they never served God.
[53:12] They wandered in the promised land for
[53:14] 40 years. That was after Kadar Bernia. I
[53:16] believe it was just shy of 40 years
[53:19] because of their decision at Kadar
[53:21] Bernia.
[53:23] See God God require even though you're
[53:27] predestinated,
[53:28] God still requires
[53:31] an answer.
[53:34] Far too much in the message church,
[53:36] we've preached election, election,
[53:38] election. You're okay. You're elected.
[53:40] You'll be there cuz God will be there.
[53:43] That's true. If you make the right
[53:44] decision,
[53:46] you still have to make the decision. He
[53:48] said, "All that believeth on me shall be
[53:50] saved."
[53:53] And all that don't are already
[53:54] condemned.
[53:56] Amen.
[53:59] Daniel, Daniel 6, I love this. I love
[54:02] Daniel. He was He was amazing.
[54:07] But here, let's just We got time and
[54:09] let's just go through this. Daniel 6:4
[54:12] it said, "And the the president and the
[54:14] priests sought to find accusations
[54:16] against Daniel concerning the kingdom."
[54:19] You see, they were jealous of Daniel
[54:21] because Daniel was watch this. His king
[54:25] was an evil man.
[54:27] He was a pagan, wicked beast.
[54:33] But Daniel was such an upright and
[54:35] honest man. An evil beast recognized the
[54:40] qualities of judgment and Daniel.
[54:44] And all the the acquaintance around the
[54:46] king were jealous of Daniel and they
[54:49] said, "We got to find an error or fault
[54:52] and not mad." Watch what it says. Though
[54:56] they could but they could find no
[54:57] accusation nor fault in so much that he
[55:00] was faithful, neither was there any air
[55:03] or fault in him.
[55:05] And so the only way they could do in
[55:07] there was to find out how he served his
[55:11] God.
[55:13] And all the priests of the kingdoms,
[55:14] they decided, they made the king to make
[55:16] an accusation, which the king would have
[55:18] never done except he had a big head. And
[55:20] he wanted everybody to serve him. And
[55:22] they said, "Well, write an accusation
[55:24] for 30 days." Just 30 days. I want to
[55:28] break that down really carefully. That's
[55:31] in verse uh you got that up, Vicki?
[55:32] That's in verse seven.
[55:35] They made a petition that any any god or
[55:38] man for 30 days save the king. It's the
[55:41] end of the verse. 30 days.
[55:46] Just 30 days.
[55:48] It's like if you just miss prayer
[55:50] meeting four times, one month. You can
[55:54] start right back up again, but just miss
[55:57] for one month.
[56:00] He said, "That's not too bad.
[56:03] I can pray at home.
[56:06] Well, Daniel could have prayed at home.
[56:10] Let's drop just drop to verse 10. Don't
[56:13] we love Daniel?
[56:15] But there ain't very many Daniels today.
[56:19] Now, when Daniel knew
[56:22] that the writing was signed,
[56:26] see, Daniel wasn't an uneducated man.
[56:30] He went to his house and he closed all
[56:33] the windows and pulled the curtains.
[56:39] He went to his house
[56:44] and his windows being open and his
[56:47] chambers towards Jerusalem, he knelt
[56:50] down his knees three times a day and
[56:51] prayed and gave thanks before his God as
[56:56] he had always did.
[57:00] a four time.
[57:05] A four time.
[57:10] And let's just go back to the beginning
[57:12] of 10. And when Daniel knew that the
[57:14] writing had been signed,
[57:22] Daniel disobeyed the government.
[57:27] You can't like Daniel. That's not
[57:29] possible for you to like him. He
[57:32] disobeyed the government.
[57:36] You think he's a hero.
[57:44] He's a hero because he disobeyed the
[57:46] government.
[57:49] You know, Daniel could have pray. God
[57:50] never even told Daniel he had to pray
[57:52] like that. There's not one place in the
[57:54] scripture, matter of fact, matter of
[57:56] fact, the scripture says the opposite.
[57:59] The matter of fact, the scripture says
[58:01] when you pray in your house, enter into
[58:03] your closet and what you do in secret,
[58:06] God will reward you openly.
[58:09] So he actually had Bible to protect his
[58:12] own skin.
[58:17] But watch the end of verse 10. And
[58:21] Daniel did as he had a forang.
[58:26] He never changed his religion
[58:29] to follow the law. And he had Bible
[58:36] to justify it.
[58:43] Multitudes.
[58:45] Multitudes
[58:47] in the valley of decision.
[58:52] The day of the Lord is near
[58:55] and the valley. You know why the day of
[58:56] the Lord is near in the valley of
[58:58] decision? If you make the wrong
[59:00] decision, you're lost.
[59:09] Luke 1 28
[59:13] talking about Mary. And the angel came
[59:16] unto Mary and said unto her, "Hail thou,
[59:18] thou are highly highly favored.
[59:22] The Lord is with thee, and blessed art
[59:24] thou among women." And drop to verse 38.
[59:28] And you know the story that you know
[59:30] Mary was going to be God was going to
[59:33] bless her to bring forth Jesus.
[59:36] And Mary said, "Be it unto me.
[59:39] Behold," and Mary said, "Behold the
[59:42] handmmaiden of the Lord. be it unto me
[59:45] according to thy word.
[59:49] And the angel departed from Mary. I want
[59:52] to tell you something.
[59:54] If Mary hadn't said those words, she
[59:57] would not have been the mother. She
[59:59] would not have been the body that God
[1:00:02] would have used to bring Jesus. She had
[1:00:05] to surrender and answer the angel
[1:00:09] before he left.
[1:00:12] She had said, "Okay,
[1:00:14] I'm on board. I'll do that."
[1:00:21] That's right.
[1:00:22] Wow.
[1:00:24] Genesis 12,
[1:00:26] let's go start at verse one. Abraham,
[1:00:29] Abram,
[1:00:30] before he was Abraham. And now the Lord
[1:00:33] said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy
[1:00:35] country, and from thy kindred, and from
[1:00:37] thy father's house, unto a land that
[1:00:39] I'll show thee."
[1:00:42] In verse 5, "And Abram took Sarah, his
[1:00:45] wife, and took Lot his brother, and all
[1:00:47] their substance, and gathered all the
[1:00:48] souls that they had begotten, and went
[1:00:52] forth to the land of Cain."
[1:00:58] If you drop to verse 7, and the Lord
[1:00:59] appeared to Abraham and said unto him,
[1:01:01] thy seed will I give this land, and
[1:01:04] there shall built an he an altar before
[1:01:07] the Lord who appeared unto him. In verse
[1:01:10] 9, Abraham journeyied, going on still
[1:01:14] farther towards the south.
[1:01:17] See, God was looking for our father
[1:01:19] Abraham to make a decision.
[1:01:23] If you would have been riding the fence,
[1:01:24] you'd say, "Well, can I serve you, God,
[1:01:26] in my family's country?" Like, I have to
[1:01:30] leave my family that brought me up in
[1:01:32] the church.
[1:01:34] What would be the purpose of that, God?
[1:01:40] Abraham,
[1:01:42] Moses, Hebrews 11,
[1:01:45] Hebrews 11:24.
[1:01:48] We see here by faith Moses when he come
[1:01:51] to years refused to be called the son of
[1:01:55] Pharaoh's daughter
[1:01:57] valley of decision choosing rather to
[1:02:00] suffer affliction with the people of God
[1:02:03] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:02:07] for a season a seeing the reproach of
[1:02:10] Christ greater than the riches and
[1:02:12] treasures of Egypt for he had respects
[1:02:18] unto the recoccupants
[1:02:21] of the reward.
[1:02:23] Moses,
[1:02:26] oh, Moses had a hard decision.
[1:02:31] I mean, he had a he had a Leoan
[1:02:34] decision.
[1:02:36] He would have been in more than a
[1:02:37] million-doll house. He would have been
[1:02:39] in the palace
[1:02:42] and he would have hit pick of a queen
[1:02:46] to rule Egypt.
[1:02:49] Yeah. He had a hard
[1:02:54] a hard decision.
[1:02:56] Moses Moses decision was you never miss
[1:02:59] work for church. And so he chose the
[1:03:02] church and let Egypt go by.
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:11] Does that make sense today? No. It
[1:03:13] didn't make sense back then either.
[1:03:16] Did it make sense that Moses would flee
[1:03:17] for his life because of something that
[1:03:20] he thought God told him when he could
[1:03:22] have been riding in the king's palace
[1:03:24] giving out orders? No. Made no sense at
[1:03:26] all.
[1:03:28] But multitudes, multitudes
[1:03:31] are in the valley of decision. And no
[1:03:33] decision means you're not going to be
[1:03:36] there.
[1:03:40] First Kings 17.
[1:03:44] Amen.
[1:03:46] First Kings 17:8. And we go to 15. We'll
[1:03:50] just bounce around here on these
[1:03:51] scriptures. And the word of the Lord
[1:03:53] came to Elijah
[1:03:55] telling him, saying, "Arise and get thee
[1:03:56] up and go down, for I've commanded a
[1:03:59] widow woman there to substain thee." And
[1:04:02] he went down and he came to the widow
[1:04:04] woman. Verse 11. And here the widow
[1:04:08] woman. She was going to fetch. And he
[1:04:11] called unto her and he said, "Bring me,
[1:04:12] I pray you a moral
[1:04:16] of bread in thy hand." And she said unto
[1:04:18] him, "As the Lord thy God." See, you
[1:04:22] know what? This wasn't the widow woman's
[1:04:23] fault. God Elijah had held up the rain.
[1:04:29] Elijah had held up the rain. And so
[1:04:32] people were starving to death and the
[1:04:33] water and the creeks were drying up.
[1:04:37] And she said, "As the Lord thy God
[1:04:39] liveth." She was a believer.
[1:04:42] She said, "I have not one cake. I have
[1:04:46] nothing to give you,
[1:04:48] but a handful of meal in the barrel and
[1:04:50] a small oil. Behold, I am gathering two
[1:04:53] sticks which type the cross which is
[1:04:54] crucifixion
[1:04:57] that I may dress it and me and my son
[1:05:02] shall die.
[1:05:08] Amen.
[1:05:12] What's the Bible say? If you if you try
[1:05:15] to save your life, you shall lose it.
[1:05:17] And those that lose their life shall
[1:05:19] save it.
[1:05:21] She was going to lose her life. And
[1:05:23] watch what the prophet said unto her.
[1:05:26] Verse 13. And Elijah said unto her,
[1:05:28] "Fear not, but go do as I have said, but
[1:05:32] make me a cake first."
[1:05:36] Now, that's that's a little bit
[1:05:37] ridiculous.
[1:05:39] Where was Elijah's compassion on the
[1:05:41] widow woman?
[1:05:43] Feed me first, you can die.
[1:05:47] And bring it on to me. and after make
[1:05:50] thee and thy son for thus saith the Lord
[1:05:54] the barrel meal. Amen. And watch if you
[1:05:57] go to verse 15. And she went and did
[1:06:00] according to the saying of Elijah
[1:06:08] to the point of starvation.
[1:06:12] She obeyed.
[1:06:15] Wow.
[1:06:16] The widow woman had to make a decision.
[1:06:20] Now, have I showed you a lot of people
[1:06:22] that had to make decisions
[1:06:24] in the Bible? Now, in what world would
[1:06:28] we think that we're predestinated
[1:06:31] so we can ride the fence?
[1:06:39] If you're riding the fence, it just
[1:06:41] proves you're not predestinated.
[1:06:43] If you're not making a strong decision
[1:06:45] for Christ, even to the point of your
[1:06:47] own life, it proves you're not
[1:06:49] predestinated. It proves you're not
[1:06:51] elected. If you would do anything but
[1:06:54] serve God and God is second place in
[1:06:57] everything in your life, you don't have
[1:06:59] to get up and testify for me. I can
[1:07:00] clearly see where your God is.
[1:07:03] It's very clear.
[1:07:07] If serving God don't hurt you,
[1:07:11] it's very clear what your decision is.
[1:07:15] Because in every one of those people in
[1:07:17] the Bible, it was ridiculous. They were
[1:07:19] beaten, threw in prison, starvation,
[1:07:25] through to the lions.
[1:07:27] They didn't have to do it. They did They
[1:07:30] did not have to do it.
[1:07:38] Amen. We have another story and we're
[1:07:40] coming here doing good. Amen. In First
[1:07:43] Kings 18, this is ahead of the one I
[1:07:46] just shared where God had Elijah stop up
[1:07:50] the rain. And and it hadn't rained for
[1:07:52] many years. And so God told him to go
[1:07:55] see a Ahab.
[1:07:58] And Ahab seen Elijah. And he said, you
[1:08:00] know, you're the one that's causing all
[1:08:02] the problems.
[1:08:04] and Israel.
[1:08:06] And Elijah said, "No, no." He said, "I'm
[1:08:08] not the one." He said, "You are." And
[1:08:09] Jezebel, the woman you married, you
[1:08:12] brought the pagan kings in and all this
[1:08:14] stuff.
[1:08:18] I'm not the one that's troubling Israel.
[1:08:20] It's your lack of commitment.
[1:08:23] It's your lack of commitment to get rid
[1:08:25] of all the foreign gods in the country
[1:08:28] that's causing all the troubles in
[1:08:30] Egypt.
[1:08:32] He said, you know, this is a prophet
[1:08:33] talking about in and a quote here. He
[1:08:35] said Elijah was sitting there for three
[1:08:37] years under the anointing and he said
[1:08:40] that they the crows kept feeding him at
[1:08:42] the river and he said eventually these
[1:08:44] pagan people and Ahab they said I wonder
[1:08:47] where that holy roller is. Why? You
[1:08:50] know, maybe he was right after all.
[1:08:54] Maybe we should have got rid of all of
[1:08:55] our gods.
[1:08:58] And so they started to hunt for Elijah.
[1:09:02] And Elijah told him, the Lord came to
[1:09:06] Elijah and said, "You better go show
[1:09:07] yourself to those people. They're
[1:09:08] starting to have second thoughts."
[1:09:16] Amen.
[1:09:17] And if we go to first kings 18 verse 18
[1:09:20] and Elijah answered and he said I have
[1:09:22] not troubled Israel but thou and thy
[1:09:24] father's house in that thou has forsaken
[1:09:27] the commandments of the Lord and thou
[1:09:30] has followed Balum. 19 And now therefore
[1:09:32] I send gather all of Israel unto the
[1:09:35] mount Carmel and all the prophets all
[1:09:38] you makeeliever backbone wishy people o
[1:09:41] bail them. 450 false prophets
[1:09:46] to the grove to the grove that eat at
[1:09:50] Jezebel's table. See those false
[1:09:52] prophets? You know why they were false
[1:09:53] prophets? Cuz they were getting a free
[1:09:55] paycheck from the king's wife, Jezebel's
[1:09:58] table. They were more worried about what
[1:10:00] they had in their belly than what they
[1:10:02] had in their soul.
[1:10:04] Amen. That's what the Bible says. They
[1:10:06] were eating it just and verse 20. So
[1:10:08] Ahab sent and all the children of Israel
[1:10:10] gathered and gathered all the prophets
[1:10:12] on Mount Carmel. And then here we see in
[1:10:14] verse 21, and Elijah came onto all the
[1:10:17] people and said, "How long are you going
[1:10:19] to halt between two opinions?" You know,
[1:10:21] I I want to I want to just and this is
[1:10:24] this is not brother Dale. I I struggle
[1:10:26] with the same things you struggle with,
[1:10:29] but I wonder if we compromise as much on
[1:10:31] our religious faith as much as we have
[1:10:34] in our life. If our kids do that, will
[1:10:37] they will there be anybody serve God?
[1:10:45] We won't need churches in 50 years. We
[1:10:47] won't have to worry about the government
[1:10:48] closing them. We'll close them cuz you
[1:10:50] know when the prophet was here, they
[1:10:52] went to church almost every day.
[1:10:56] I know you don't get saved to go to
[1:10:57] church, but they sacrificed every day.
[1:11:00] Yeah.
[1:11:02] You know, we talked about how, you know,
[1:11:03] how it was in the any of you that were
[1:11:05] around in the 50s and 60s
[1:11:07] when brother Brown was here in the
[1:11:09] revival times, the church
[1:11:12] way back in the Wesley church. We used
[1:11:13] to have 10-day revivals. You go to
[1:11:15] church every day for 10 days and twice
[1:11:16] on Sunday both times.
[1:11:19] I was on Google. I was on YouTube and I
[1:11:21] seen I seen one of the churches in
[1:11:24] Toronto had a prayer service on Friday.
[1:11:26] You know that pastor came to me when I
[1:11:27] went to Africa with him about 8 years
[1:11:30] ago
[1:11:32] and he told me, "Dale, I'm considering
[1:11:34] closing Friday night prayer meeting
[1:11:35] because nobody shows up."
[1:11:40] And he still had it on and he still was
[1:11:42] publishing it on YouTube. And it was one
[1:11:44] of the first times I'd seen I said,
[1:11:45] "Wow, I didn't even know he still had
[1:11:47] it." If we compromise that much on our
[1:11:51] importance to serve God publicly,
[1:11:54] publicly. You can confess all you want
[1:11:57] in your house publicly.
[1:12:01] Publicly.
[1:12:03] We will not need no baptisms cuz we
[1:12:05] won't. That's only publicly. That don't
[1:12:07] save you. We'll have no child dedication
[1:12:10] cuz that's only publicly that you're
[1:12:11] giving your child back to God. You'll
[1:12:14] never come to church and for sure not
[1:12:17] for prayer meeting.
[1:12:22] That's exactly what happened in Israel.
[1:12:26] You want you know what you say that's
[1:12:28] just brother Dale. You're going off on a
[1:12:29] limb. The Bible says that if God never
[1:12:32] shortened the days in Revelation that
[1:12:35] none,
[1:12:37] not even you would be saved.
[1:12:41] And you know what that goes for brother
[1:12:43] Dale too.
[1:12:45] You know I can remember this kid. I
[1:12:47] never thought twice about going to
[1:12:48] church on Sunday night, Wednesday,
[1:12:50] Friday, whatever. That was just it was
[1:12:53] just what you did. I know I know the
[1:12:55] devil goes to church, too. And I know I
[1:12:57] know you don't have to go to church to
[1:12:58] be a Christian. If that's how you feel,
[1:13:01] I don't know what you do with the
[1:13:02] scripture that forsake not assembling of
[1:13:04] yourself together.
[1:13:06] And all the more as you see the day
[1:13:07] approaching.
[1:13:11] But that's not my confession. If that's
[1:13:14] how you feel, that's how you're teaching
[1:13:17] your children,
[1:13:18] you won't have to worry about them being
[1:13:20] in a church. No, you won't. You want to
[1:13:23] you're you're training them very well.
[1:13:25] They will look at the parents and what's
[1:13:28] important to you and and what will be
[1:13:32] least important to the kids.
[1:13:36] What you do in moderation, the kids will
[1:13:39] do in excess.
[1:13:43] What did brother Bam say? He said it
[1:13:44] used to be wrong to go to the movie
[1:13:45] shows. He said Satan pulled a fast one
[1:13:48] in and moved the TV right in on the
[1:13:49] house. So he brought TV in the movie
[1:13:50] house.
[1:13:53] Well, you do in moderation.
[1:13:58] Your kids are doing access.
[1:14:01] Now we know the prophet loved gunm smoke
[1:14:02] and bonanza
[1:14:05] and he said the only problem with TV was
[1:14:08] the filth that was on it.
[1:14:10] So, I mean, there's not no filth on that
[1:14:13] screen. It's the word of God. There's
[1:14:16] nothing wrong with the screen.
[1:14:19] But if you compromise and you just start
[1:14:20] watching a little bit of filth
[1:14:23] while they, you know, just a little bit
[1:14:25] of nudity,
[1:14:27] then your kids will be nude.
[1:14:31] If you see Hollywood stars swabbing all
[1:14:33] over each other on the TV screen and you
[1:14:36] watch that with your children, then your
[1:14:39] children will actually act that out
[1:14:42] because you were okay with it. You were
[1:14:44] okay with it on the screen, but they'll
[1:14:46] do it in the flesh.
[1:14:52] 21 Elijah said to all the people,
[1:14:56] "How long will you halt between two
[1:14:58] opinions?
[1:15:00] If God be God, then let's follow him.
[1:15:04] And if he's not, let's build a kingdom.
[1:15:06] Let's get two jobs. Let's buy a new
[1:15:09] house.
[1:15:12] But if Baalum,
[1:15:14] then follow him. And the people answered
[1:15:16] him,
[1:15:19] not a word.
[1:15:22] You know, spirits don't die. Temptations
[1:15:25] don't change.
[1:15:27] And then Elijah said to all to all the
[1:15:29] people, he said,
[1:15:32] "I even only have remained a prophet to
[1:15:34] the Lord, the Balum's prophets." And
[1:15:37] let's just jump down. And he said, "Let
[1:15:39] them therefore give us two bulocks, and
[1:15:42] they can choose the bulocks themselves,
[1:15:44] and cut it to pieces, and lay the wood
[1:15:46] in the fire,
[1:15:48] and I will dress the other bulock." See,
[1:15:50] Elijah didn't even have to pick which
[1:15:52] bulock he had. He let them have the
[1:15:54] preference.
[1:15:56] And he said that let's just decide that
[1:15:58] the god that answers with fire that he's
[1:16:02] the real god. In verse 24 and and you
[1:16:04] call on the name of your gods and I'll
[1:16:06] call on the name of the Lord and the god
[1:16:08] that answers with fire let him be the
[1:16:10] god. And all the people answered and
[1:16:13] said it is well spoken. Now this is the
[1:16:16] first time
[1:16:18] that the children of Israel had answered
[1:16:21] Elijah.
[1:16:28] He said what a great hear the prophets
[1:16:30] talking. He said what this is a message
[1:16:32] of a verse connected right to this verse
[1:16:34] said what a great man Elijah was. How he
[1:16:36] went out there led by the spirit of God
[1:16:38] and challenged Ahab say bring up all
[1:16:40] your priests and let's see who God is.
[1:16:42] And he walked around and he said, 'Well,
[1:16:44] you know, when when Ahab's God never
[1:16:46] answered, he said, 'Well, maybe he's
[1:16:48] gone fishing.
[1:16:50] Maybe maybe you should holler louder.
[1:16:53] Maybe he fell asleep.
[1:16:58] Maybe you maybe he can't hear you. Maybe
[1:17:01] you need to cut yourself and show your
[1:17:02] sincerity.
[1:17:05] And Elijah was mocking them. And when it
[1:17:08] came to about the evening time is where
[1:17:11] we're living right now.
[1:17:14] If we get about one more country going
[1:17:16] to war, there won't be many places to
[1:17:17] hide
[1:17:28] about the evening time
[1:17:31] and Elijah cleaned the altar and he
[1:17:34] brought his sacrifice
[1:17:37] and he just said, "Lord, I've done all
[1:17:40] that you commanded me." And you know
[1:17:43] what happened?
[1:17:47] God answered.
[1:17:50] He answered with fire. And he here's
[1:17:52] what the prophet says here. He says, "If
[1:17:54] you say you're a believer, God will
[1:17:57] vindicate it." And he said, "You don't
[1:18:00] you don't have to presume nothing. It's
[1:18:03] God that will consume you. You don't
[1:18:06] have to have any pre presume. You don't
[1:18:10] have to presume anything." thing. He
[1:18:11] said, "God will consume you." Just like
[1:18:14] he consumed the sacrifice, God will
[1:18:17] consume your body because your body is
[1:18:20] the sacrifice for God.
[1:18:24] Amen.
[1:18:27] Wow.
[1:18:32] Here in choosing the bride, the prophet
[1:18:34] says, "Many times men and women, they
[1:18:36] hear God's truth. They see a vindicated
[1:18:38] and proven truth, but yet they won't
[1:18:40] want to hear it. And for some other
[1:18:43] reason, some other choosing that they
[1:18:46] have
[1:18:48] the valley of decision.
[1:18:51] Then face to face with the truth, their
[1:18:54] ears are closed up to the gospel
[1:18:57] and they'll never hear it again. Eli,
[1:19:01] watch this. Elijah gave them
[1:19:05] a choice
[1:19:07] which they shall choose you this day who
[1:19:10] you'll serve. And if God be God, serve
[1:19:13] him.
[1:19:15] And if your world is that great, then
[1:19:18] just serve your world.
[1:19:24] Amen. here in spiritual and we're
[1:19:27] closing here in spiritual and neesa he
[1:19:30] talks about he said you forget who you
[1:19:32] are
[1:19:34] and then the days of Elijah and Ahab he
[1:19:37] said when they had to make a choice who
[1:19:39] they would serve
[1:19:41] they actually and and the prophet said
[1:19:43] in spiritual amnesia he said you forgot
[1:19:46] that you're a believer
[1:19:50] that's when you get to that state that's
[1:19:53] why you don't act like a believer
[1:19:55] because you forgot your identity.
[1:19:59] Kar Mia, prophet preached the message,
[1:20:03] why halt you between two opinions. If
[1:20:06] God be God, serve him. And if he's not
[1:20:08] God, then don't serve him at all. And if
[1:20:12] a real experience of God is what it
[1:20:14] takes to get sin out of a man's heart,
[1:20:16] there's only one savior of the world and
[1:20:19] it's the blood of Jesus Christ who
[1:20:21] freely poured out from Calvary for the
[1:20:24] remission of all sin that man has
[1:20:26] committed. And he was wounded for our
[1:20:28] transgressions, bruised for our
[1:20:30] iniquities by the chastisement of our
[1:20:32] peace is upon him. And by his stripes
[1:20:38] we are all healed. I want to close with
[1:20:41] our opening scripture. I just want to
[1:20:44] read a few extra after that. Joel
[1:20:46] 3:14-17.
[1:20:49] Multitudes, multitudes
[1:20:52] in the valley of decision. For the day
[1:20:54] of the Lord is near
[1:20:57] and the valley of decision. I and I want
[1:20:59] to clarify that the reason the day of
[1:21:01] the Lord is near is when you make your
[1:21:04] decision,
[1:21:06] it will affect your eternal destination.
[1:21:09] Watch verse 15. And the sun and moon
[1:21:12] shall be darkened, and the stars shall
[1:21:15] withdraw to shine, and the Lord shall
[1:21:17] roar up out of Zion and utter his voice
[1:21:19] from Jerusalem, and the heavens and
[1:21:21] earth shall be shaken.
[1:21:23] Well, that's happening. Lots of
[1:21:25] earthquakes,
[1:21:27] lots of floods.
[1:21:29] But the Lord will bring hope to his
[1:21:31] people and strengthen the children of
[1:21:34] Israel. So shall ye know that I am the
[1:21:36] Lord your God dwelleth in Zion, my holy
[1:21:40] mountain. Then shall Jerusalem be holy,
[1:21:43] and there shall be no strangers
[1:21:45] pass through her
[1:21:48] anymore.
[1:21:51] Amen.
[1:21:53] God help us.
[1:21:56] Multitudes, multitudes
[1:21:59] in the valley of decision.
[1:22:02] Amen. I I believe many of us I I I
[1:22:05] believe myself
[1:22:06] it's the valley of decision.
[1:22:09] You know, you know, we sing the song,
[1:22:10] you know, it hasn't the the the bride,
[1:22:14] it hasn't worked out exactly like we
[1:22:15] thought. We thought the rapture would
[1:22:17] have already taken place. We thought it
[1:22:19] would happen in the 60s or 70s.
[1:22:23] But we're still here
[1:22:25] and there's still grace.
[1:22:28] That's right.
[1:22:28] But because of of the way Satan is
[1:22:31] working, Satan is putting the bride of
[1:22:34] Christ to sleep.
[1:22:37] That's right.
[1:22:37] He's just He is He just turned the heat
[1:22:40] up like the frog
[1:22:43] really, really, really
[1:22:47] slow.
[1:22:51] And you're going from alive to cooked
[1:22:54] and you don't even know it.
[1:22:58] Amen. God help us. Let's stand.
[1:23:10] I believe and I believe the Bible
[1:23:13] clearly shows this and teaches this that
[1:23:16] not only God wants to know where you
[1:23:19] stand, but God wants the public around
[1:23:23] you to know it also.
[1:23:26] You weren't you weren't God didn't just
[1:23:29] send you to earth to save yourself.
[1:23:34] But does your family know your your
[1:23:37] testimonies? Do your family know? You
[1:23:39] know, I I and I can only use my own
[1:23:41] personal ones. You can fill in your own
[1:23:43] personal ones. You know, before my dad
[1:23:45] died, it didn't matter who came over to
[1:23:47] his house.
[1:23:49] Didn't matter if it was the queen or me.
[1:23:52] If there was church at the church, he
[1:23:54] went.
[1:23:57] Okay.
[1:23:59] You know, this week coming, I have
[1:24:01] friends that we've known for 30 years
[1:24:04] and I we invited them to supper and they
[1:24:06] said we can come on Wednesday night. I
[1:24:08] said that won't work. Come any day by
[1:24:10] Wednesday.
[1:24:13] And it's not about Wednesday, but I just
[1:24:16] told that visitor
[1:24:18] that I have a conviction on Wednesday.
[1:24:22] That's going to church.
[1:24:24] I don't party on Wednesday.
[1:24:26] That's right.
[1:24:27] Amen. And that's what God expects for
[1:24:30] all of us in in our own way, in our own
[1:24:33] decisions. Amen. Do you like You know,
[1:24:35] you know, Sister Dama was telling us
[1:24:37] when Margaret was over, they went and
[1:24:39] see the farm and the the neighbor Jeff
[1:24:42] and Damas went and showed them the farm.
[1:24:44] Margaret couldn't contain herself to ask
[1:24:46] the guy. He said, "Are you a Christian?"
[1:24:48] Do you know that's what God expects? God
[1:24:52] expects you to speak it.
[1:24:58] Speak it.
[1:25:00] We can't ride the fence no longer.
[1:25:03] There's some things I don't do.
[1:25:06] Period.
[1:25:09] Because I believe in God.
[1:25:12] Amen.
[1:25:13] God help us. God help us. Cuz it it's
[1:25:16] just getting, you know, religion is
[1:25:18] getting less radical all the time.
[1:25:21] Yeah. less radical. You know, the Bible
[1:25:24] says that God called us a peculiar.
[1:25:28] That's right,
[1:25:30] people.
[1:25:33] Peculiar. That means you don't do things
[1:25:35] that the world does around you.
[1:25:37] That's right. Do
[1:25:38] you know you can give an example? That
[1:25:40] anointing is powerful this morning. You
[1:25:42] know, in the Bible when it talked about
[1:25:43] wearing jewelry and the braided hair
[1:25:46] because in the Bible times, if you
[1:25:48] braided your hair with stuff in your
[1:25:49] hair, you were a prostitute.
[1:25:51] Now, that's not the case at all today.
[1:25:54] But you see how the Bible teaches us
[1:25:56] that what they what you what the what is
[1:25:58] accepted in the world of Hollywood,
[1:26:01] believers don't do because you're
[1:26:04] peculiar.
[1:26:08] But the church has got so much that we
[1:26:11] can just fit right in.
[1:26:17] That's not who God's servant. That's not
[1:26:20] who God's calling.
[1:26:24] Anything God valued, he hid from the
[1:26:27] world. Anything he covered up in nature
[1:26:30] was valuable. Diamonds, gold, and his
[1:26:34] bride. If he wanted some cheap jezebel,
[1:26:36] they're a dime a dozen.
[1:26:39] But he wanted a peculiar
[1:26:41] real lady. That's right.
[1:26:45] That wasn't afraid of keeping her
[1:26:47] decency.
[1:26:49] for him. Amen. God help us. God help us.
[1:26:52] Man, I I pray to God the rapture takes
[1:26:55] place. Where will I be in 20 years if
[1:26:57] the rapture don't take place? It'll be
[1:26:59] nothing but grace.
[1:27:01] It'll be only grace. If if I'm still
[1:27:03] here, it'll be one word, grace. Grace
[1:27:06] and mercy. Cuz brother Dale, I couldn't
[1:27:09] do her. I could not do her. And I'm
[1:27:11] afraid you couldn't either. God needs to
[1:27:14] come and take us out of this place.
[1:27:17] Amen. Multitudes. Multitudes.
[1:27:21] Multitudes. And the valley of decision.
[1:27:24] The day of the Lord is near.
[1:27:27] And the valley of decision. God. Jesus
[1:27:30] help us. Amen. Have thine own way.
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:38] Have thine own way,
[1:27:42] Lord.
[1:27:44] Heaven
[1:27:46] way.
