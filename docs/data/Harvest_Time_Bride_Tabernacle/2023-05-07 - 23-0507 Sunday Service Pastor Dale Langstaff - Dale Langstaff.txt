man just some prayer requests before we look at the word of God today um I I just covet your prayers on these these are our possible places that we might go to minister Pastor Jose has asked us to go to El Salvador and Minister the first week of December that his mom and dad are both alive both in their 80s and uh so we've told them we would go and we desire to go and also brother Jose's are just a good friend a very good friend probably our closest sister Church in the world in the flesh amen and we have many friends and also you know we desire to go to Uganda in February that will depend on you know God's leading and also it would depend on if Pastor Leo was able to come here with Pastor Sande if they came here we might change that but I had another prayer request is Pastor uh Samuel and I can't say his last name from the Philippines I've met him different times but he asked me to preach a camp meeting uh the end of October the 1st of November I don't normally leave home at that time of year and so I told this pastor I said it's in Michigan the southern island of the Philippines and I told him I said you know we're planning on going a few other places and I said you know I might need somebody to pay my airplane ticket and I do have I can't leave the church and he gave me an open door he said you can come this year or next year and preach you camp many whichever God gives you a thing amen so we just uh we definitely aren't going because of we're just trying to follow God's leading amen amen and we give him all the glory let's just uh look at the word of God while you're standing in Amanda just awesome and we just pray that you pray for us I want to preach on a topic and and the word of God it just has a way of growing unbelievably amen but I want to preach on your theophany is a part of God your theophany is apart or came from both God amen let's turn to uh Hebrews 7 1-3 and then we're going to read uh Revelations and we just pray that God will help us just as many different many many many different ways to go almost completely different topics amen but we just pray God's leadership for this Melchizedek king of Salem Priests of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed them to whom also Abraham gave a tent of all the first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also the king of Salem which is the king of peace verse 3 without father and without mother without descendant having neither being a beginning of days or an end of life but made in the likeness like unto the son of God abideth the priests continually still there today Hallelujah let's turn over doroth there's just so much just turn over to Revelations one one Hallelujah just really pray that you'll open up your hearts to God's word amen you know this king of Salem that here Abraham met was the king of the king of the Heavenly Jerusalem there's no less than Jehovah God himself amen hallelujah and this Revelations 1 1 and the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent it and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep these things which are written therein for the time is definitely at hand Lord Jesus we ask that you would just add the blessing to your beautiful word this morning and Lord we know that the bride of Christ is here assembled this morning because they brought their Holy Ghost licks of fire lord Jesus and we feel we're in your presence Lord Jesus from the worship service and we ask that you would bless your bride here Lord Jesus and we pray Lord Jesus you know the many different ways you could go on this topic multiple different ways Lord God we just want to go the way you want to go this morning Lord Jesus that I pray you'd preach to me Jesus and show me who you are more clear and more perfect today as you minister to your bride of Christ this morning and you're in beautiful name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning as you're seated amen we see here that you know we mentioned many times we preached on different topics like this amen and so many people have their opinion and uh thoughts on who God is amen and and that's that's good as long as it lines up with the word of God Amen but but I want to read you something that uh well I'm just going to go to the end this uh I want to read you a quote from the Hebrew series and and I I tell you where this thought came from you know we went to the friend of luance that was a funeral and uh you know uh like Luanne was in her realm she these were people she knew more than me and I'm sitting back and looking at the brother in the casket and I'm looking at his grandkids he had four generations going up saying goodbye they're their daddy and and how Grandpa and great grandpa I was kind of looking at pictures with the great grandson and my mind was racing about this life and and what's it all about you know we say goodbye and we're so sad but this is life and you know the prophet said he said when you're born when you have a baby that's death you've entered into your death that's amazing amen when we're boring we come here on Earth and it seems so real but it ain't real at all it's a shadow and a type of the real and we've left our real body and our real me and this ain't me and this definitely ain't you and and but we get so caught up in the use and the means but it ain't even the using the me's because it ain't even us amen and I said God like I'm I'm almost confused and help me and and wow and you know you know in the natural and I'm not following my notes at all but you know in the natural anytime a body is entered into another body in the natural if you have surgery and you take somebody else's whatever the doctor will give you antibodies or Auntie because your body naturally will fight it your body will completely refuse it to attack it and kill it and everything and you know the prophet said I just that's just physical the prophet said in just so many ways to preach this message he said in every Revival Jordans were born he's on Jacob Jesus and who betrayed him I forget the Judas they were believers it's a different appetite and I'll tell you this morning that if you came from Genesis 1 28 and when God made Man In His Image if you were part of that God making you you're definitely going to have an appetite of God that it's just it's just it's just black and white science that is a physical impossibility for you not to have an appetite of God when you are God because your theophany was built in God you know we're going to look into this so much but uh it's just God even made the theophany of this theophany of God was when he made his son Jesus and you know in the world the world the denominations they're thinking that we got three Gods up there we got the father and we got a son and we got the Holy Ghost and somebody came to brother Brown and it was it was it was just beautiful How uh brother Branham that was he said brother Branham he said I'm coming to to straighten you out on your doctrine of the godhead you know I had uh I had somebody uh from a denominational Church put a comment on a friend of mine from Africa and he said you know that brother branham's a Doctrine on the godhead was was uh uh almost heresy is so deceived you're so very deceived because this person he said he said well hey brother Bram said he said well definitely I want to be straight no to the word of God so help me out and he said well you know and the godhead there's three personalities you know watch our prophet he was just amazing he said can you repeat that he said well like you know the theologians in our church and you know the denominations of we know that the godhead three personalities to prophecy could you repeat that and he repeats that and he said could I ask you where you learned that from and he said oh I learned that in seminary Bible school he said well I'm not the least but surprised but he said you need to go back to your science book and he said you know you can't have a personality without being a person and every individual person has its own individual personality and the personality always goes back to one single person my personality is completely different than anybody person in here so guess what even science proves that there's one God because there was one personality love for you amen hallelujah is it a god it's just amazing who's Christ but see we get so wrapped up back to we get so wrapped up in these bodies you know and we hang pictures up like this and pictures of our prophet and pictures of the pillar of Fire on our Prophets that's all death he said Jesus now that you're gonna have to hold your seat belts on this one he said Jesus body In the Flesh brother Matt was no different than horse I have a quote my iPad no different a horse or a cow or a dog he said it was 16 elements of cosmic light and all these things that came together and it was just flash period period and that flesh is definitely not sitting in heaven because the Bible says the Flesh and Blood don't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven God just had oh it's just amazing he said see when when the Three Angels Came to Abraham he said literally God just God came out in his theophany and he said he literally just grabbed the elements and threw 16 helmets together and stepped into a body and walked up and he said no to the Archangel he said Gabriel he said come over here he said whoa whoa step in that and he said I might go Angel he said step in there but I don't want to we'll do it anyway and he said they walked right up to Abraham and flesh bodies and they said it doesn't matter what the picture was that Abraham was looking at he said he didn't recognize the flesh Jesus hadn't even born yet and Abraham didn't hang pictures in his tank they didn't stick to the studs but he said they're Supernatural always recognize this the spiritual always recognizes the supernatural and he said there was just there was just oil in Abraham that blended with the oil and the angel and he said that's God it had nothing to do with flesh because when God disappeared he just dropped the Flesh and went right back up to heaven and he said it was exactly the same with Mary when Jesus was born and married he said sure he came through the Virgin he just pulled the 16 elements together dropped it in her room and was born as a baby it didn't have nothing to do nothing absolutely nothing to do nothing to do was flesh the same God came in the pillar of Fire To The Burning Bush to Moses the same God claims the pillar fire when Israel left Egypt and he stopped them that day was the same God that came in the cloud to lead him in the daytime it was the same God that came down in our day and west exact same guy God is the spirit and all those that worshiped him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and he said if you were and in the beginning God said and I preached this in Africa and it's just the place blew up but he said God said to you because you were in God he said you we know this and I preach this and I said it makes me very happy to preach this but if you're going to live eternally if you think you're getting to heaven and you're going to stay there forever then you always were there and John you know I'm just not even looking at my iPad but John 3 13 says that if you're ever going to go to heaven that first you ascended from heaven amen and when you came from the theophany of God you were little different than Jesus you are but little see Jesus was God and you were God's expression first God thought about brother Dale and then he spoke it into existence amen and there is no way if you ever see a Christian doing something I know you could stumble and fall because this flesh is weak but the spirit is willing but if you see a Christian with an appetite for evil they're a twin it's just it's just it's impossible for God to reject himself if if if if I want a blood transfusion and I go if I'm gonna have a big surgery and I don't want to take somebody with hypothetics blood I can go and give my own blood and put it in the fridge and they'll start and when they put that back into me it's me me won't reject me God is the word and God became flesh and dwelt among us but God is in the word and if you are rejecting one respect one Speck of the word if you have trouble with one Speck of the word you weren't part of Genesis 1 28 God made man and woman together and one person in His image because it's just physically impossible for God's antibodies to reject God in the same God amen and I don't mean that it's sinful to hang up pictures of of Jesus or a prophet not but when you get to heaven I don't mean to disappoint you but brother Matt don't look for that picture you're not going to have done Jesus by that picture because that's not how our Prophet said that Abraham identified him when he came to the angels look at the difference between Abraham and lot my lords he was a Baptist wow that's why a Christian when this is a shadow and a type oh wow you got to be careful getting too wrapped up with this world because this world needs it on our homes we might go through seasons in our life where I went through a season where I got carried away with that God will definitely bring you up short amen we are living a lie because this ain't real matter of fact our Prophet said we're probably going to get into a battle and slow down so much on such Deborah he said you have to die to see the real he said because this is a negative and he said you can't even see the picture of brother Dale until I die oh so Lord just come and take me home amen he said we know here's the people knowing that Jesus was the devil because he said before Abraham was I am and they said they're like you're just 50 years old you imagine God putting up with idiots here he's he's Elohim the beginning no beginning yeah yes 50 years old and they need to go back to school for longer and he said unto them he said before Abraham was I was and he said he said who was the I am he said the he said he was a pillar of fire the burning bush he said I am that I am he said there he was and it's the often he formed there and he said he was called the Son of God the I am the Jehovah Hallelujah God showed us he said here Thomas came up to him and he said he's Thomas they're walking with Jesus on Earth and he said Jesus said we would like to see the father wow I preached all those years and that's all you got out of it just thought he said you know I've been using that long how long 50 years he said if you've seen me you've seen the father this is in the Hebrew series the great great messages to watch it brother Brown talks a lot in the Hebrew series about your theophany talks about it thousands of times and then he comes in before he dies and choosing of a bride and who is this my cousinik and it's just loaded with who you really your theophany amen and here he says he says what happened do that five minutes before here Jesus was the logos now now when the Bible calls Jesus God making his logos brother branham's own words was he said we call that the theophany so when God sent Jesus out in his logos that was his theophany there was no you could have said God sent me out in his logos we just logos another word for Easter that's that's what the prophet said amen and how our bodies were made of six different 16 different elements and uh oh he talks about sorry just what I said there now here here he goes he said boy he said you can glory in this flesh you you boy you can glorify in this flesh but the spirit has a soul in there and my brother that's right he said but your flesh is just the dust of the earth like an animal your flesh is no more than an animal and he said if you just uh if you just lusted after the flesh or the things you see after women or the other things the difference he said it's still animal he said that's right he said that's right he said you shouldn't do that the spirit of God will lead you to higher places and not exactly right he said now there's the great theophany standing there he's talking about Jehovah God before he went to Abraham amen I'm just trying to find out and he said here he said you know the two angels they came and we know they drunk the Flesh and drunk Malek and ate the Flesh of the calf and all that he said he said now when they came to Abraham and when Jesus came God sent him out from him and it's theophany but the ones that ate flesh I wasn't their theophany because see often he can't eat meat he can't drink it's a spirit and so God literally when I remember I said when he brought the angels together and that they had to step out of their theophany and step into flesh and that was God in flesh and then he stepped right back out of the flesh laid the flesh down and went back to heaven in his theophany oh it's beautiful amen Hallelujah but what I wanted you to get was that are these bodies are no different than animals there was another one where he said we were the same as a horse or a cow or different things but this here all this was just flesh and you see people worshiping the Flesh of even Jesus Christ The Flash was just flash it was just it was just I mean yes Abraham fell down to worshiped him it was just flesh when the flesh was here and man it was just now all it was was a 9 16 trench for God to take a bolt off and as soon as he was done with it he put it back on the Shelf God so he would need to look at it that'll help us look at each other and every situation different we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but of both principalities powers in high places amen here here and pulling away the armor of God he said and you think of a mother's love and now there's a paragraph paragraph 220 he said in the whole armor of God he said no you think of a mother's love now but God said that a mother might forget her baby but I can't forget you see he said your name is engraved in the palms of my hands and he said he loves you he said don't worry about it he said he's taking you his word just to keep it on amen see we we you know you know you may love your your wife or your husband or your mom or your dad or all that but that there that love that you have for each other is a fallen love it's a filial love and it seems so real and so powerful and and amen in the right realm it is but the prophet said he said you know see if you had somebody mistreat your wife in The filial Love realm you would take him out but in the agape love you would go to prayer meeting and pray for his soul and so you know without even answering the question they said what realm are we dealing in most of the time on Earth you got help brother death because you know this seems so real but it's so not real Amen in Revelation 10 1-7 you know we talked about the mighty angel coming down and and he put his foot on the land of the sea and and you know we know that that in the end times that all the Mysteries would be revealed and I'm just going to read the last prophet but in the days of the voice of the Angel when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries of who is Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ all the mysteries of God shall be finned he says as he declared it to his servants the prophets amen before you go on a Rapture this morning you're going to have to know who Jesus Christ is you know this brother that came to the Bro the prophet told him about the the godhead had had three personalities brother Branham told him but he finished that story he said well you can only receive this by Revelation he said well oh no he said I wouldn't accept that by Rubble he would accept the priest from his church oh my goodness he would have preached his Bible School Doctrine over Revelation and brother Brown looked at him he said say that again I don't know if he did in that part he said the Bible says without faith no man conceived God and faith is revelation you say I won't accept the godhead by revelation like some some some so-called Christians they say the dumbest things out of their mouths it's just unbelievable oh no I won't because I got to have something physical to see that well really well you got to get converted then because faith is revelation and without Revelation without faith no man can please God so you're not even my goodness you want to prove God you say you know like the prophet said to the man he said you you have a wife he said but you love her he said we'll prove it he said I want to buy some of that love but how much is it in the store prove it you can't see some things are just by facing man Hallelujah in the natural we're in the flesh amen and you're in this you know we couldn't take on somebody else's body but here here here we got so many people professing to be Christians and they're taking on Antichrist spirit in almost everything they do he said it's it's physically scientifically impossible the Bible says that God said Esau have I hated Jacob I don't hate it God hate it he wasn't a part of that theopathy when God made in Genesis 8 1 28 amen God help us God help us amen Souls that are in prison he said the mysteries of the Seven Seals he said when the Seven Seals were open he said it opened the entire Bible he said the Seven Seals it was with the seven Mysteries and the Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it all and also the book of redemption for the New Testament amen God help us he said and we already said this if a person's Eternal you're always eternal amen and this Aztec here here you know you say well who was this Melchizedek that came down and looked like a it looked like a you know somebody say well you know Abraham called him uh recognized him as God because he paid them ties and in Hebrews 7 4 it talked about he was a person but then when he was done that Journey he just laid down that person amen God all the time Christ was the fullness of God revealed in our day Hallelujah First Timothy 6 15-16 he said which is in times past and his times past he showed who he would bless only uh the king of kings and Lord of lords he said who only hath Immortal dwellings in the light which no man can approach unto he said whom no man has seen nor can see and to whom be honor and Power Everlasting talking about who God is and yet you know in our in our day in our day we want to put a picture up of somebody and every religion in the world they got to hang a picture a picture but it's a picture of a fallen state watch this watch this and we're going to go into that next week even in Jesus Christ's name okay case it was a phone state our Prophet said that he said it just like this he said Jesus was flesh Christ was Jehovah God in it that's a direct quote the direct quote I have it in my death do I quote amen see see God had to pay because of God's law he had to pay the Redemption for sin and and watch this it was it was he was he he was redeeming you it wasn't even you that did it and we're going to get into that in Revelations because you were Justified and and you say well how's that explained he said well that was what G brother Brown told the story of the pawn shop the rightful owner didn't have the person in the pawn shop and Jesus came and Justified you or redeemed you out of the pawn shop and come back to the owner that you were all along see there's crud in a pawn shop that people pick up on the side of the road they mad the pawn shop didn't really own it and Satan definitely don't own you and so Satan's trying to take your flesh and use your flesh but he don't even have ownership oh my God help us in this day to stand up for Who We Are it's by revelation and you'll know by revelation by your appetite by your desires it won't be by your mistakes you'll still make mistakes because you're Tabernacle you're trapped in flesh trapped in flesh and you might make a hundred mistakes a day but your desire is better and only you and only you and God Alone know whether that's truly desired to change or be more perfect amen Hallelujah but a person that was made in the image of God here's here's God I just loved it I I mean it's the greatest the greatest phrase you could ever make but here's God in Genesis 1 28 he says he's talking to you and he says let us you're part of the US make you flesh but I'm going to make you in my image and when okay and when he finished that sent that that verse brother Mike where I wasn't made in this body and what God was saying is I'm going to take you from I'm going to take you from me and make a body but it can't be seen that's what he said you can't see us theophany it's invisible it's a spirit but it was a body and that's why and it was a male and female body is a masculine and feminine Parts we're both in this body that was invisible except to God and your theophany may be invisible to these good old eyes but if you have a connector inside which will pick up the the ways of the Holy Ghost It's Not Invisible to the spiritual eye amen because blood and water don't mix and when you just come together amen it's just it's just something it's just a glue it's an unseen positive magnet that is let's go there's nothing you can't see nothing oh man glory be to God Amen it's beautiful amen it's theophany who you are your theophany come from God Amen there's so little to do with this you know our our funeral services I mean we should be I know we're Tabernacle here but we should almost be wishing it was awesome instead of crying over our loved ones you can't comprehend the Bible says how amazing see that was the original that's the picture and this is really blurry wow Hallelujah the revelations the the whole Bible is a revelation of God and there's no other way to know God Only by Revelation to whom the son will reveal here here's here's here's the Bible breaking it all down and and the religious person just miss it completely whom the son will reveal him and it's hid from the wise and the prudent but by Revelation he'll reveal it unto the theophany the logos the low guys that God spoke out of himself was your theophany there don't have to be a lot of revealing there because it's the same ocean amen same water amen it's the amorph faith of God the Greek word the the word of God in morphe means change or to change the mask and the prophet tells the story of this he said my daughter was in a a play in the Victoria Playhouse would just say it like that or what he didn't obviously mention that name and he said he said there was a Felix in the playhouse and he played he was popular and really cool him and Iliad and they played multiple parts and so one time they would come out and they were the king next time they come out and they were the beggar something for me the king of kings came to be a bagger in a barn there wasn't even a room for him in the end but it was exactly an identically the exact same feeling to know you the exact same person he was saying in this place he said that person played three different parts in the play but it was exactly the same person and the Amore of God was just changing his mask or a change he said God the Father God the son was not three gods and we know this of course we know this but it was three acts of one God and there you have his God the Bible being revealed in the last day so here he he mentions this and who is this Melchizedek he said God in more faith was the pillar of Fire God and morphe was Jesus it's going to shock you but God in more faith is the bride today the bride of Christ it's God above us our Prophet said that by the way and who is this mycosidic paragraph 43 he said it's God above us it's God in us and God With Us the all-consuming god spirit of God you know I I would I would you know like I've said you know if you get married and not you're going to take pictures of your wedding now but be careful with the picture thing spiritually speaking don't get too consumed with pictures I mean clouds are nice and fires are nice you want to see who God is put a fire picture up you want to see who God is put a picture of clouds up nice puffy clouds because people are putting God in a box says that my God don't come like this and he don't look like this and he don't act like this but then it can be my God and to that part they're right it's not their God because God is Elohim and God comes in many hundreds of thousands of different forms you say how's that possible Bible promised that in this day he would have a many-membered bride the second Eve I would not fall amen many membered bride and that's Elohim and he's oh how are you going to put them pictures up that's that's God that was that was a logos of God that he said in Genesis 1 28 that the prophet said we call our theophany Hallelujah amen thank you Jesus amen I gotta put on my glasses to read this quote and who's this Melchizedek paragraph 48 he said you'll notice here tonight that eternal life was with him in him and in his thinking it was all eternal life and before there was ever there was an angel or a star or a cherubim or anything else it was eternal amen and if you have eternal life tonight you always was not your being here not this flesh this wasn't but the shape and form of that infinite God me in you said if you were Eternal if you are Eternal you always was not this not this clay don't hang the picture up with brother Dale because you're not going to see the god because the prophet said that your theophany it's invisible you don't wonder why the twins can persecute the other twins because they can't see it you wonder why they can't recognize the revelation of Jesus Christ Revelations 1 1. and they see three Personalities in the same Jehovah God is because there were twins wow he says he's coming in already he said he isn't and if he isn't infinite God then he isn't God he said he was omnipotent and all these things he was and he said if he isn't then he can't be God he's all-knowing all the places because he's all these things amen and God he's like the wind he's he's a being he's he dwells in a house being omnipresent omnipotent knowing all things makes him omnipotent present because he knows everything that's going on he said he watches he goes into this I don't even say this like this is the kind of God you're serving he said he said if a fleet he says it's right in this paragraph he says if a flea bites his eyes so you you've got a dog or cat that house he knows a number of the hairs on that dog cat he knows how many if it's got fleas but he knows how many fleas is God and he knows how many eyes he's biting when the fleas are biting their eyes and he knew that before you got the pet because that's the kind of God we see and yet you have churches and churches and churches actually I don't know any churches other than Believers that actually even believe in predestination you tell me one you tell me one organization the teachers and preachers predestination and yet I can't read the Bible in a daytime in devotions and not see predestination election called chosen uh are you with me brother how can they read and there's a chosen elected called the the hello what Bible are they reading what version are they reading talk about Revelation they don't even have understanding of English to win wow and that's the infinite God that we can't comprehend this this is a quote this is the infant God that we can't comprehend in our minds and this part I'm adding and so we try to build a picture and put God in a box and hang them on the wall wow or we put them in a casket say what a great person that flesh was but it ain't even me I don't want people to come and look at the something that ain't me why does somebody want to look at a negative that's not even clearly me I know I know what you're thinking I had all those thoughts too you know what if we get where God wants us to get we won't be nowhere for the good brother man we won't be I think I walk around it's so different for me and I I can only preach about me or things I know but you know brother Bernard I used to dream about you know I'll have an Empire you know I'll do this and I'll lay this out and I I go in those same buildings down I'm just like and I come in the house and I'm like what happened I'm like because if we were in that plan if we were part of that Genesis 1 28. all this here stopped is getting farther away we're I'm still walking by it I still like your Pulpit brother Tim but it's getting farther away I think it just don't have the same thing to it because it it's not even real that's crazy I mean that's crazy I sit and think about that all week and I'm like looking in the scriptures and like I went into the softening and stuff and literally some of this some of the verses had like almost 100 quotes to I couldn't read them all brother Matt you know what I do I scroll to 65 and start backwards I fall asleep reading quotes from one verse and then I try to I try to I have like a wheelbarrow and I try to put that all together and go that's physically impossible nobody could make because that's a god that we serve and that's the thoughts that God had of you man it's it's it's amazing amen and if you wasn't in his thinking there's no way absolutely if you wasn't in Genesis 1 28 . there's absolutely no way that you're going to be there remember how the scriptures read not him that willeth nor him that runeth but God we call Delaware and so we're living our life brother Matt around people by Revolution and discernment wow revelation I remember your dad talked about the sermon brother Matt sermon reckon that being able to see a theophany sister Patricia it's not with these eyes your sister Patty amen anyone okay it's like that was kind of you know you ever see somebody brother might say that was kind of weird but it was never ever the same logos you never walk up to God if you're if you're a child of God you're never going to walk up to God and say that was kind of weird are you kidding that's the same material and so we got Believers doing Believers Believers doing things that and going places that and wearing things at the logos couldn't wear or persecuting the logos that the logos would never persecute for you know the plans that I have for you these aren't just Earthly plans to prosper you for all of eternity How Could You persecute that huh twins literally 20. wow First Timothy one here and I'm this is a repeat brother Brown I'm quoting to some of the thing but first Timothy 1 to 3 and 16 you can pull this up I don't believe I read this other than through the prophet said without controversy great is a mystery of godliness it's definitely a mystery most people have no even in the ranks of the message or was manifest God was manifested in the flesh handled to hands eaten the meat got eaten meat God drank God slept God cried and God Came Down In the Flesh and he died in Christ and so that he could redeem us back to the Flesh and that's why God had to be a man in the first place to fellowship and to be worshiped see God had to be a man for two reasons number one it had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer oh that's beautiful whoa it had to be one of us brother Matt to pay the price for one of us so God couldn't pay the price he didn't qualify but he's God and so he made the qualifications by just going there was Jesus thank you very much Mary thank you for your contribution to the that's unbelievable and then see God couldn't die and I've had message people attacked me on this it's all right it makes no difference to me at all they said well if if Jesus flesh wasn't God then then our sins aren't paid for but anybody with a hair brain would know that God can't die because then he wouldn't be God I love a prophet he says the only the second reason that Jesus had to come in a body God had to come in the body called Jesus was first to be our Kinsmen Redeemer and second is it's impossible for God to die it's also impossible for God to sin and Jesus Took the sins of the world and the prophet said that when Jesus gave up the goat that day Elohim the theophany of God you ready you believe the prophet it left him because God couldn't be sin so our God completely Hoodwinked Lucifer oh that's just crazy good Satan said you know Satan was trying to kill all the prophets and the apostles down Through the Ages because he knew Jesus was going to come he knew God was going to come and try to be a kinsman redeemer and pay the price for sin and see Jesus and Satan's a king and he don't really want to give up the throne you know he uh-huh but but he's gonna have to give it up but so rather so he was killing all these babies anybody that looked like God he just John any of those people just get the king to you know kill the babies under three or two or uh-huh you're getting the picture and he looked at Jesus and he looked at Jesus the Satan looked at that and he goes no no God wouldn't God wouldn't stand there I know God knows no way God has to take that and then he looked at Jesus when they spit in his face look you don't think Satan's looking at that brother man I guarantee he was looking at that he had his binoculars looking at that he was looking to see if his his countenance changed if if his damir change brother man he was just looking see Jesus because if Satan would include in that God was Jesus he wouldn't he would have just stopped but he would have top pilot in the floor and said buddy let him go give them Barabbas but he he looked today yes this is the Elohim the infinite in more faith no no no yeah there's no way he'd take that and then Jesus went to the cross to pay the price for brother Dale and all the theophanes the all the logos that he spoke in in Genesis 1 28 all the logos he spoke to him he went to the cross for that and when he was dying there Satan had no clue what was God and because he said well God can't be sin and then and then the Lo the theophanes the the logos of God right when Jesus is ready to take the sin and die he leaves them and then when he resurrected he went down to Hell he said hello Lucifer I'm here I said no no no I'm not answering that door there's no way I mean he said he's the death go ahead and tell you something brother Matt our Prophet said when I was studying this week he said God took all you know when a bee stings you and it blows out their back end and they can never sing again normally they die spiritually the devil Badness he just stung somebody he's a dead man he can just go over there and flutter because he's a dead man and God took that stinger tabernacled in the flesh and he can never ever watch this I know you don't you're not going to believe this I can just tell by your accent our prophecy brother Brown he can never touch your flesh again because this is your stinger it's gone it's gone it's gangan it's ganga you don't have two it's completely gone he said here and we're like wow guy 46 who is this monkey in the beginning God dwelt alone and his attributes and Assad teaching God was his thoughts amen and when he spoke his thoughts it became it became me and you to be king the word because see in Genesis 1 28 that had already been calculated in God's sights and now he speaks it but it wasn't about it yet it was just the Elohim of God the theophany it was a body but it was an invisible body oh I'm just crazy about that amen it took another whole chapter in Genesis 28. God had to finish the the the the the the the the the creation got to finish the creation before he said okay I'll throw these 16 things together and I'll make Adam wow amen just so many quotes are not we know the Bible said Adam was lonely and God made him help make you know what the prophet said about that he said Adam was a flesh being in Genesis 2 about halfway down when God actually made the Flesh and Eve was still tabernacled in him and he said Eve's theophany was around Adam yep that's why he said when he fell Adam knew exactly what he was doing to redeem her it's just like Jehovah God knew exactly what he was doing when he had to be a Kingsman Redeemer to change his mask and go from the king of kings and Lord of lords where they have no elections in heaven the only King of Kings and the only Lord of lords there ever is ever will be and ever has been to become a beggar he knew exactly what he was doing and you know why he did that oh buddy because your theophany was around Adam it was around God and oh boyzone boyzone boys oh this is man you should try to study this kind of stuff and you're just like oh God amazing Jehovah amen we never want to be and we always have been guilty of putting God in a box to all the people that have trouble with Pentecost they either want it or don't want it or you know what I mean or anything I always put God in a box God's gonna be for them God's going to be this way I got plans that God's Gonna and you can't even see the yellow end yeah yeah the oh wow that's expressed here and I'm sorry to rerun this in Genesis 1 26 he said God God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion Dominion at that point and and the 27 we weren't even human being flesh then we weren't even human beings okay let me repeat that I don't think you got that God said let us make Man In His Image that's a god and we and the likeness of the god and let us be our God because we have Dominion who has Dominion of the world God but God said I had Dominion of the world what did God say to Moses he said why are you crying to me just speak it I gave you the commission what do you think he's saying to his bride right now my wife don't have to call me before she gets groceries we don't have a household like that praise God revelation's higher than that so you don't have to get me to sign a withdrawal form from the separate bank account a separate bank account it's a separate God anybody's got a separate bank account for the wife's got a trinitarian god it's all right if you do but you see what I mean and so this is Genesis 1 27 maybe you can pull this up Vicki and so God created man in the image and in his own image in the own image no we're not flesh yet and in the image of God he created he him male and female so let's put down all the sisters really that's disgusting you know my wife came to me privately when we were in Uganda and there was a person there always speak very much in disclaimer and uh and you know he would kind of like Get me get me I need water I need I need and here's the bride of Christ and she came to the Lord and she said I don't like that spirit like his wife wasn't president see in God's mind they work together they were not separated and for goodness sake they weren't lower and he created he him male and female created he god Jehovah God damn oh I understand we all have different positions I'm not Christ I'm not the prophet you know what I mean I wish there wasn't we're looking for a young pastor we just have different positions but not get me see the Bible says in James if we have respects for repersons that were guilty in this area that we're guilty of the whole law now watch us watch this I know you're not gonna like this and I'm I'm sorry ahead of time but when you put up a picture it's respects you know when you go to a big church meeting they take a picture of just the pastors but not the way but God created he them male and female I'm not saying it's sin I'm just twins you know what I mean yeah just watch that oh I know what the devil's telling you oh bless God the woman wasn't part of the original Creation in the flesh praise the Lord I'm above her that's a shadow that one Lucifer that ain't even the real Genesis 1 26-27 that's the real I'll take that one thank you very much uh -huh wait is that Bible the prophet said that that this flesh was a negative to the real and and when you are born as a baby didn't you just have any more babies when they're born they're dead I love holding dead babies except when they need a diaper change that's that but we're all excited and then watch watch out you had us this all wrong and I had it all wrong and I studied this ever since the funerals I'm sitting at the back and I'm looking at they had them high in the casket and you could see his whole body just almost from his toes to his I'm thinking we in our heads think babies born all that so I'll give them to brother Dale I love that you can't move and run away so I can hug him but then when I die we cry and when I die that's life that was the baby's born that's death wow how's this song go he said how sweet to hold a newborn baby but how much more that he'll face a world of sin uh-huh and heartache and death and pain a pain ain't part of God deathly amen this is completely the negative we're living in negative don't get uh if we have a funeral here before next Sunday and with me just go what where's on I was just born I went back to my original logos of God and I'll tell you what I'll be losing my mind that our Prophet said it'd be the noisiest place there so there'll be no Canadian Spirit there wow oh that's unbelievable but it's true questions and answers 57 and I got to stop sometime but questions answer 57 paragraph 8 23. he said now when he the logos went out the watches just a quote and anybody can see this now when he's the logos one out of God it was God coming from one big Fountain into a body form of a man and it was the logos that we call our theophany so everything I'm telling you I gotta I definitely have a backup plan I've had people come to me and they say well you know I had people literally somebody I had people that didn't like what I preached and they went to other ministers as far away as Tennessee they said what do you think brother Dale got that from praise God that guy had some discernment he said did you ever think that brother Dale may be studied maybe it's maybe just possible brother Matt it's just possible so it would say hey say this and I said well what are you gonna do with this but he said well this I said what are you gonna do with this scripture and these quotes oh well brother Brown he was wrong in that area or the Bible he the Bible you know what he told me about the Bible this is true story brother Matt there's millions that have this feeling it was wrongfully interpreted from the Greek and Latin oh my oh my is right you know what twins Judas Iscariot love Jesus when Jesus sent the disciples out he did the Miracles Judas Iscariot was with the disciples when they came back and they were rejoicing brother Matt rejoicing when the demons the Demons of the devil what this is this is crazy he was with the disciples when they were rejoicing when they come back to the Lord Jesus that the Devils were subject to him and he was a Devil Himself oh wow and those people sit in message churches or stay home look up wow you know I've never you know me like I mean days went out with them God Jesus Christ the anointed one sent them out and they come back rejoicing to Jesus Christ Jehovah God and flesh that the Devils were subject to him and you know what he answered Rejoice rather that your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life you know what he knew and he sure did know he sure did me no wow he knew amazed amazed most people you know what the world just lived through most people have zero actually thank you you're read my mind a negative zero and that's why Satan has been able to pull the wool over there Church who was God who is Ellen used who is out in Mount Pleasanton Who's That Monkey please who's God who's the melchized who's Jesus Christ God I know you've heard this ten thousand times but I'll just say to you God is an object proportion so that's just a meaning for a part of another hymn it was a spirit with lots of different masks he had a stressor full of mouths my wife sent me upstairs she said yeah I said you know I got to look spiffy because she looks spiffy and I said what do I wear today and she said well maybe go to the second drawer in aisle three and get a vest and I pulled the drawer out and it could barely open because there were so many like so lack of clothes in there that it wouldn't even open and I came down with the wrong one and she said oh that was in drawer three down different you know and we spend so much time but it was a different mask that's all it was God just went to his dresser and he was who was it in David when he killed Goliath I'm asking a boy who's it tall the Great I'm asked and who it is in the bride of Christ in a world that's gone completely insane that's what he said completely insane that you would actually still come to church on a Sunday morning and listen to the word of God with pleasure it's a god it's a god it's the god it's Elohim it's that's better it's Elohim in a mask wow amen can I read one quote here invisible Union of Christ this is one month before the prophet died almost to the day 11 25. I'll read this quote and we'll shut her down you know I just brought just a couple papers I never read any of them they were out of the thousands you know in paragraph 122 he said you remember I mean I mean it'd be some reading and we'll stop in the highlights for a second but you remember when it went down the grain began to ripen you find that the grain can ripen and everything in the stock is has to die Hallelujah but you can see where we're standing life life is in the grain and this body is stock it's Jesus body was stock oh there's a thousand people that don't believe that but it's still a stock amen the life is in the grain just exactly like the same grain that went down on the ground the same Jesus in The Bride the same Jesus you don't believe that or you wouldn't even be in your seats the same Jesus in Bride form but Jesus was God and he just said and the same Jesus in brideport I'll let you finish that one the same power the same church the same thing the same word the same word sucked up through those and ages and came out here and came to a head here and all the life that went through here was picked up in his people the bride and now it's forming into the head for the Rapture speaking tomorrow night and he said he's I'm just going to skip a paragraph and go down he's just talking about now you're he said when you you when you got born again you were remarried again your spiritual union your your natural life in the world but eternal life is a germ that was given to you in the beginning none of this life body is just to prove to Satan that he'll have a bride in this age amen now your old book is gone and your your old Union meaning this book and now your name your names in the old uh has been transferred when he took you out of the pawn shop and God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness he's talking about you being redeemed here and he said and your name's in The Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life redeemed Hallelujah the the bride the new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life the marriage certificate it's the Eternal Gene the Eternal Gene from the beginning that takes hold when you were Justified Hallelujah Romans 5 1 you need to pull that out this isn't important this is a climax of the whole message Romans 5 1 yay Roman said they are being justified by faith what's Faith Revelation being justified by faith now if you look in the definition he's probably going to go into the but it's as if you he said I'd ever sinned brother Dale never sin this body say son sin but the the Me from Genesis 1 26 and 27 it never did no send it now that was a little gossip Jehovah God it was a million miles from sentence and you look up the word here the word means it does doesn't mean forgiveness it means Justified that you didn't mean it doesn't mean you were forgiven for instance have you heard of me oh he talks about a story a drunk and he says if you've seen me and you thought I was drunk you say I forgive you he said now if I didn't do it if I did it I was guilty but you can't forgive me when I didn't do it but yet oh wow and the word justify is oh you never did it amen nobody has that Revelation but believers nobody it's not regarded at all how is it done in God's book the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage of divorcement and death is there and it's not even in the memory of God you're Justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused and you never done it in the first place the old Union so look at this I want I want you to catch this and I promise I'm just finished it's Satan is the accuser of the brother but how come yeah that every one of us have had there's only one it wasn't God that accused you accused you've never done it in the first place the old Union's in the sea of forgot to forget unless he he wasn't married you wasn't married to it to begin with this this old flesh I was never married to this old flesh even though I'm I'm locked in this flesh it's not a part of me from the beginning he was the bridegroom born your shame he himself took your place and he predestinated you the bride the before the foundation of the world and the Bible says that you are predestinated seed how did how did you come to do this he said you just you were deceived into your first marriage you were deceived you had nothing to do with your first verse into adulterous parents like Eve it's no fault of your own it's no fault that I was born in the Earth there's no fault of your own but by the natural birth you came after Eve and who committed adultery and the reason you were born adulterous is you're a sinner to begin with this part of your body and you was deceived into it but it was no fault and it ain't your fault you never did it because the little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world and God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and like the little Eagle story uh I actually skipped this but he talks about the eagle and the farmer and you know the story about that he put an eagle egg under the chicken and and you know the ego just didn't feel at home he that's why he said like you got people going to message churches or doing things that that Eagles don't do in the chicken barnyard so if they're doing them they're chickens period amen we want to make sure that our life proves that we're not chickens when you're standing here completely Justified as oh you never did it from the beginning and this is my message to the to the bride now he said you go off as we go off the air in a minute he said standing here standing in God's word with God's word amen every Dot and jot and title where you're standing I'm trying to tell you get away from the shock God's a separator get away from the shot get out of here get out here in the wheat where you can ripen before the sun and hear the coming of the combine I stand Here completely you're standing here you are this morning amen if you're not comfortable in the barnyard with the chickens you're standing here completely Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah and talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good more thankful than anything I know the per the you're the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God and every man and woman that was born of the spirit of God Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ believes every word of God and stands through it through every sin and never sinned in the first place sorry you're completely by our faith the blood of Jesus can give you if a man if I was supposed to die this morning and a man took my place I can not die for that sin somebody's already taken my price we know that was God himself in Christ Jesus and Jesus the word took my place and he became me that sinner that I might have be might become him the word amen true the church Hallelujah and the spiritual reunion of Christ and the bride is the flesh is becoming word and the word is the Flesh manifested and Vindicated happening in our day and we're nearing the coming of Christ and the uniting of the Bride to the word and the where the word becomes the bride and you're standing completely you've never sinned in the first place and God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness and you never did it and your accusers and you were accused of it by an accuser but really in the beginning you were predestinated I'm going to add this you were the logos the theophany you don't say that here predestinated to be a son and daughter of God and you're standing there completely washed never did it wow thank you Lord Jesus amen Hallelujah take a picture so I know where to start next time let's stand amen no man a descended up into heaven but first he came down from heaven even the son of man which is there now amen Hallelujah God rich and amazing plan that God had you know the the the prophet and some of these quotes just I'd say from memory you know he said God was not a slothful businessman he never left nothing to purchase well I perchance got a good church and perchance I got a good pastor per chance we had a good evangelist come by you per chance I ran to the altar perchance no no no it was you are the logos of God which the prophet said we call our theophany but that's a key part I want to leave with you you'll have the exact same appetite as your daddy you are she you are part of him and if you well nothing the god can do what'd you do if God wouldn't be welcome in a certain place you won't be either or you weren't or you're a twin period amen see In the Flesh and this is where we are so then I it's a promise I'm closer you can play that honey in the natural the daddy thought that Eliezer or uh sorry Isaac and Jacob you thought Isaac was going to get the blessing but he gave it to Jacob the world thinks that they're by education and Bible schools and by fancy big churches and gold platforms and and refined creatures that they're getting the blessing of God remember when Joseph brought his kids to Jacob the bless them crossed his arms God Jehovah the Elohim the logos crossed his arms for brother now he crosses entrepreneur wow thank you Lord Jesus it's beautiful God bless you this morning he man he loves you you you're him you're him how could he not love him the Bible says it like this he says no man ever hated his own flesh now I'll guarantee you the Bible says also that if you being evil and how to give good gifts to your friends how much of the Lord being holy not how to give good gifts to you now if no man ever hated his own flesh do you think God Hates Us do you think God hates his own logos you think God has a problem with the old his own his very own theophany logos of course not wow and you can all tell by beautiful yeah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for revelation thank you Jesus that sounds like home to me that's where [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
