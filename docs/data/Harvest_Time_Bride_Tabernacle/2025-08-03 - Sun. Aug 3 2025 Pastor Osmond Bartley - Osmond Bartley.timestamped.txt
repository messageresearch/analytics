[16:37] to each other, brother and sister, and
[16:39] I'm not used to that.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; So, um, we I guess we don't say that a
[16:44] lot at home. I think my mom and dad when
[16:46] they were younger, they did that a lot.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; So, if I don't call you brother or
[16:51] sister, it's not that I don't mean that.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.

[16:58] of a funny thing to come out, I guess,

[17:02] &gt;&gt; Um, can we put this down a little?
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[17:04] &gt;&gt; we'll put it down just a little bit. We
[17:06] just have this one.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh, okay. This
[17:13] is called an old hymn medley. Come up
[17:16] here with me.
[17:18] Um, yeah, old him medley. And I I like
[17:22] to put a lot of different songs
[17:24] together,
[17:25] &gt;&gt; right? And so, uh, this is something
[17:29] about that name. His name is wonderful.

[29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, help it not to just be our head
[29:52] knowledge.
[29:54] And we're just repeating what's printed
[29:56] on a paper like anybody could. But as
[30:00] the bride of Christ this morning, help
[30:03] it to be our heart and our soul that
[30:05] said, "Lord,
[30:07] &gt;&gt; you're welcome. You're not just welcome
[30:09] in this outer part, but you're welcome
[30:11] in our body, and our tabernacle
[30:14] &gt;&gt; in every part of us, Lord God. Every
[30:17] room of every door is open, Lord God.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; We praise your name today, Lord God. We
[30:23] just
[30:26] we just bask in the presence of this
[30:29] weekend. Lord God, we're almost we're
[30:32] almost done that we're in the last
[30:34] service
[30:36] is like a blur
[30:38] of time.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; But we sure thank you for the
[30:43] opportunity for the word that's went
[30:45] forth. Lord God,
[30:48] &gt;&gt; we love you abundantly. Lord God, be
[30:50] with your servant this morning. have

[31:00] not just your servant but be with the
[31:03] hearer
[31:04] &gt;&gt; that you would anoint us
[31:06] &gt;&gt; and lead us.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Guide us
[31:11] &gt;&gt; and may we not just hear but may we be
[31:13] doers of the word

[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats for just a
[31:23] moment, man. Just a great privilege to
[31:26] be here. Wow.
[31:29] What happened last service?
[31:32] That's just that's just unbelievable.
[31:35] Amen. Just thank you all for coming. And
[31:37] those that you drove or or bought rooms
[31:40] or or motel or that you you have no
[31:44] idea.
[31:45] You you might not know till you get to
[31:47] heaven what it meant to God that you
[31:50] came and sacrificed and and you did
[31:52] something out of your comfort zone. This
[31:55] is out of our comfort zone. I mean for
[31:57] some of us
[31:59] &gt;&gt; I'm very comfortable.
[32:01] This is my life. I was born on this kind
[32:03] of property.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; But you know God sometimes needs us to
[32:08] get us in our comfort zone. I just want
[32:09] to before a pastor comes you know I want
[32:11] to mention like the word has been
[32:14] amazing. Yeah.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; And you know, we heard a lot this
[32:16] weekend about fear
[32:19] &gt;&gt; and we heard about purpose last night.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; And you know, brother Osman brought it
[32:23] so beautifully. You know, the three
[32:24] Hebrew children, they they uh before
[32:28] they went in the furnace, they said,
[32:29] "Even if we die."
[32:32] &gt;&gt; So, they weren't convinced they
[32:33] wouldn't.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; And asked her, she said, "Well, even if
[32:37] the king kills me."
[32:39] &gt;&gt; So, she wasn't convinced.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; But I want to get to be a people that
[32:43] I'm convinced.
[32:45] And if you want to ask me to come and
[32:46] pray for you, you need to be a person
[32:49] that's convinced.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; When David went to Goliath, he never
[32:53] said, "Even if Goliath kills me."
[32:56] &gt;&gt; David said, "I will take that giant
[32:59] now."
[33:00] &gt;&gt; It's not maybe I will. I'm not sure if
[33:03] God's backing me.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[33:07] We need to get beyond the I don't knows.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; We need to get to the purpose. that when
[33:13] you have a giant in your life, you say,
[33:15] "Just give me my slingshot."
[33:18] &gt;&gt; And I just need five stones of grace,
[33:22] &gt;&gt; it won't take all five.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; And do you want me to tell you what
[33:25] David did?
[33:27] &gt;&gt; He not only took down his Goliath,
[33:30] &gt;&gt; he didn't just kill him.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; He stood on him.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; You know, when David cut off Goliath's
[33:37] head, he stood on his enemy.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; He put Satan under his feet. Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; David was a boy,
[33:45] &gt;&gt; a little boy.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; He would have stood on the chest of that
[33:51] giant to cut his head off.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's amazing. Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; An amazing God we serving today.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave us a little test this
[34:04] morning.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; God gave us just a little test. He's
[34:08] seeing Were you here?
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you hear the word?
[34:13] &gt;&gt; You know when a teacher teaches a lesson
[34:15] that he gives us a little test.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; So a sister got hurt on the trampoline
[34:21] &gt;&gt; hurt badly.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And God wanted to see if we had a
[34:26] purpose. And then when we prayed that we
[34:29] could have prayed and said, "Well, even
[34:30] if God don't hear our prayer,
[34:32] &gt;&gt; you know, the doctors, and we believe in
[34:35] doctors,
[34:36] &gt;&gt; and doctors can stop and and take away
[34:39] things." But you know something our
[34:40] prophet told us,
[34:42] &gt;&gt; sometimes we call an ambulance as if the
[34:44] ambulance is going to heal us.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Those doctors can stop all injury, but
[34:51] they can't heal nothing.
[34:53] They can stop any further injury and any
[34:55] further pain.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; But there's one person that healing
[34:58] comes from.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; One person. You understand? One person
[35:02] &gt;&gt; right in that ambulance and ain't going
[35:03] to do no healing.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to be give me my giant.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; It's going to be thus sayaith the Lord.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; It's all right.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; It's all right. You know, I remember
[35:16] when my and pastor, you'd come. I
[35:19] remember when our grandchild was born,
[35:21] it was very early, the last one. And and
[35:24] they were, you know, the doctors come in
[35:25] and and they were telling the the the
[35:28] the parents, you know, they said, you
[35:29] know, the baby, it was very early. And
[35:32] the baby, he says, the baby could be
[35:34] blind. The baby could be death. The baby
[35:37] might not have a heartbeat. The baby
[35:39] might not have lungs. It might have to
[35:40] be on oxygen. The baby might the baby
[35:44] might have Down syndrome. The baby might
[35:46] not, you know, be mentally sound.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And the mother
[35:53] started to like lose her mind.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Were you there? Is this true?
[36:02] And I said to the mother and my son, I
[36:06] said, "This is nothing but fear.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; There's nothing but fear."
[36:13] &gt;&gt; I said, "Everything will be okay." We
[36:16] pray, we laughed and we said, "Listen,
[36:18] Riley and Brent said, "Everything will
[36:20] be fine."
[36:22] &gt;&gt; And everything's just fine.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Every test they put on that, he's just
[36:26] fine.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; You got to be careful with that fear.
[36:30] Amen. Yeah.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; You know, I I mentioned one thing and
[36:33] Pastor Osman, please come. You know,
[36:35] when Jesus went and prayed for the
[36:36] little sick girl in the room, he said,
[36:37] "Everybody get out of here.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Get out of here.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; We don't need no more fear and doubt and
[36:42] wondering and gawker, slow down, and
[36:46] &gt;&gt; get out of here. We just need the ones
[36:47] that have a purpose.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Purpose,
[36:51] &gt;&gt; giant.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; There's no competition here."
[36:55] &gt;&gt; It's not maybe I'm going to take down
[36:57] Goliath. Yeah,
[36:58] &gt;&gt; I'm already taken.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus name. Amen. God bless you,
[37:04] Pastor Osman.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege to have the
[37:08] family of God. Man, I can't imagine. I
[37:11] like to try, but I can't imagine what
[37:13] heaven's going to be like when I'm with
[37:15] brother John Garrett, Le Ministries, his
[37:17] brothers, all of you. Just think for
[37:20] eternity. Just think about that. Won't
[37:21] be like a 4 day weekend.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; No, no. We'll have a 400 weekend and
[37:25] that'll just be the preview. Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; 4 million over the weekend. I mean, it's
[37:29] just beyond comprehazing.
[37:34] You have a thought and you'll be with
[37:36] your best buddy. The presence of God.
[37:39] Amen. God bless you. I I I would sing it
[37:41] if I could, but I can't.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Let me just uh But uh Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I keep falling in love.
[37:54] Heat. Heat.
[37:55] [Music]
[38:03] [Applause]
[38:05] Heat.
[38:18] Heat.
[38:25] [Music]
[38:27] Heat. Heat.
[38:33] [Music]
[38:34] [Applause]
[38:37] [Music]
[38:42] Heat. Heat.
[38:44] [Music]
[38:50] [Music]
[39:02] should be refilled with your love of the
[39:04] Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; You know when you know when we say we
[39:12] keep falling in love with him, it's
[39:14] about each other actually.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; You know that, right?
[39:19] You know, I've known people, they love
[39:20] God so much and they pray and I'm I'm
[39:23] preaching up here. I had to rebuke some
[39:25] people not long ago and I'm up there
[39:28] preaching and all they do is pull a
[39:30] message book and reading while I'm
[39:31] preaching.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; And I rather rebuke that spirit because
[39:34] that could never be the spirit of God.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; No way.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; You know,
[39:38] you know, you got people praying as loud
[39:40] as they can and they don't love their
[39:42] brothers and sisters.
[39:44] So, you know, when we say we keep
[39:46] falling in love with him over and over,
[39:48] I'm in love with you, you're in love
[39:49] with me,
[39:50] &gt;&gt; the closest we will ever get to Christ
[39:52] is when we walk wash one another's feet.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And I've been just meditating there. And
[39:58] you know, when Jesus said, "Whatever you
[40:00] do in his name,
[40:02] uh, whatever you do, do it in his name."
[40:04] And we everywhere you go, people say,
[40:05] "Oh, praise the Lord. In the name of
[40:07] Jesus, this in the name of Jes. That's
[40:08] more than that, you know."
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Anything anybody can say Jesus.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Anything can say in the name of Jesus.
[40:15] It mean more than that.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; When you do things in the name of Jesus
[40:18] is when you take his place,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:22] &gt;&gt; When you stand in his place and do it.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; This is how Galatians 3:27 says, "For as
[40:31] many as being baptized into Christ, you
[40:32] put on Putting on Christ is more than
[40:34] the water of baptism."
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Putting on Christ is when you take his
[40:38] place.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's when you take his
[40:42] place. When you put him on, you take on
[40:43] his role.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. You want one more
[40:48] singing from Barber?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; We're having a great time this weekend.

[40:58] happy. It's just a different atmosphere.
[41:01] From I started I would you know, brother
[41:03] Dale called me twice. He said, "Go, come
[41:05] on, preacher." But I was trying to hide.

[41:52] church every time? I said
[41:54] &gt;&gt; I I I I whenever I sing at church, it's
[41:57] like I'm inspired
[41:59] &gt;&gt; to do a song. I just don't sing because

[48:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop God's
[48:45] &gt;&gt; word from coming to pass in our lives.
[48:48] Amen. Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; You know, as I'm standing here before
[48:52] you, I
[48:54] want to say I appreciate the words and
[48:57] you know, when I listen to the words
[48:59] from brother Junior from Friday night
[49:02] and
[49:06] &gt;&gt; brother John Garrett, you know,
[49:08] yesterday and
[49:11] &gt;&gt; these words just playing over in my
[49:12] spirit.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's like the words are
[49:15] unfolding before me every day seeing
[49:17] what happened and
[49:19] &gt;&gt; you know we're being given a test.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; You know, let me see whether you guys
[49:23] believe what you preach.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I I appreciate it. Really
[49:29] appreciate it. Everybody, you know,
[49:31] singing and
[49:32] &gt;&gt; we're in the last days.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; You read the book of Luke chapter 21.
[49:39] Jesus
[49:40] outlined all the things that we ought to
[49:42] look for. The book of Matthew chapter
[49:46] 24, Jesus outlined it again. There was
[49:49] never a season in humanity on earth here
[49:53] because everything is governed by
[49:54] season.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; That you we see so many preachers
[49:57] rising.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Everybody become prophets, prophetists,
[50:02] preachers, everybody have a word.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it's a season
[50:07] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said they're going this season
[50:09] is going to come on. Why? Because men's
[50:11] heart failing for fear. People want
[50:14] something.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; I have never seen so many apostles and
[50:17] prophets rise up around the world now.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; And you know and I tell you what they've
[50:23] got they have got great crowds too.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Great mega thing is just popping up all
[50:28] over the place. You know, I'm not
[50:30] criticizing nobody, nobody thing, but
[50:32] I'm just saying
[50:34] &gt;&gt; people are hungry.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; People are hungry for something.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; And you got to give them something, you
[50:43] know.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; But then again, the same word says there
[50:46] will be famine.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; In Amos 8 from verse 11,
[50:51] &gt;&gt; he never said faming for the word.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Fing for earing.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go. Yeah.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Faming for hearing.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; When you read uh 2 Samuel
[51:04] &gt;&gt; and you read there, God says
[51:08] that famine means I won't be speaking.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; You remember with Saul?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Saul inquired of the Lord and the Lord
[51:20] did not answer.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:24] So we got to fabricate things to give
[51:26] the people because they're hungry.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; So we have to put things together
[51:31] because you know you come you need
[51:33] something.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And so that's the platform that is
[51:36] forming now
[51:37] &gt;&gt; people not hearing from God.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; No no
[51:40] &gt;&gt; notice what Saul after Saul stopped
[51:43] hearing from the Lord.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Even when the music from the anointed
[51:48] David was being played, it wasn't
[51:51] helping him. No,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; that's when he start to throw javelin
[51:56] &gt;&gt; to kill David.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of us preachers because we're
[52:01] not hearing from God, all we can throw
[52:04] are javelins.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Not no inspiration. So, we are throwing
[52:09] javelin. Javelings, which is fear.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; We're trying to kill. And you watch
[52:14] everybody. If one rise, one little
[52:16] prophet rise up on social media, another
[52:19] one rise, what is he doing? He's trying
[52:21] to throw dabbling across this guy,
[52:23] &gt;&gt; because he's this guy's trying to rob
[52:25] his bread,
[52:27] &gt;&gt; trying to cut his bread.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And so another one rise is throwing
[52:31] javelin.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; If God was speaking to you, you don't
[52:35] need to throw javelin.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; You listen to anointed voice of God.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Such as I have I give. I come to give
[52:43] life.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; But this morning, let's have a wonderful
[52:49] lesson. by the grace of God here. Amen.
[52:52] Thank you for the song.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; And the songs that came before and my
[52:57] heart is just being blessed and
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; You know, and it's the Holy Spirit is
[53:02] just leading me in the direction because
[53:05] I've got other preachers at church
[53:07] instead of being
[53:09] pulling in the direction of teaching
[53:11] more at church.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; You know, because everything is a part
[53:15] of the kingdom of God.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know that's what I've been
[53:19] doing and
[53:19] &gt;&gt; right
[53:20] &gt;&gt; during the week I have Bible studies and
[53:23] I have people from Pakistan

[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just stand together and turn
[55:48] to Ephesians chapter 4. We're going to
[55:51] read from verse 11 through to verse uh
[55:54] 13. And very interesting
[55:59] for our lives that we focus on this.
[56:01] Father, I thank you so much for this
[56:02] great day, Lord. A great day of the
[56:05] feast of Christ standing in our midst,
[56:07] Father, and inviting us to drink, drink
[56:12] of this water of life, Father. Lord, we
[56:15] can only turn the pages of this book and
[56:18] oh, we can read from it, Lord, and it
[56:21] can just stop there. But we're depending
[56:24] on the Holy Spirit, Father, to just come
[56:26] and bring a word from these these words,
[56:29] God, to our hearts, Father. And it is
[56:32] more than just enjoying a preaching,
[56:35] more than just enjoying a word, God. But
[56:37] Lord, as we drink and drink, there is
[56:40] something coming out.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet remind us Lord in his in his
[56:45] teaching, he says that everything that
[56:47] we have got need of in this life is
[56:49] already in us. Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; He said even the rapture and all we has
[56:53] to do is to just drink and drink and
[56:56] drink and
[56:57] &gt;&gt; it will come out.

[58:35] of God
[58:36] &gt;&gt; oh you're God you're a God of purpose
[58:39] &gt;&gt; they're all workers come up here from
[58:41] Jamaica and Lord someone never being in
[58:45] a church and it takes Canada to bring
[58:47] them to the world.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Beautiful.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. It's beautiful, Lord.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless God. You're awesome.

[58:58] &gt;&gt; You're amazing, God. Amen. Thank you
[59:01] again in Jesus name.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The guys that brother Junior work
[59:06] with, they're they're from Jamaica,
[59:07] different parts, and they're here on the
[59:09] farm work.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And he brought them to church.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. and they're oh they they they
[59:15] enjoy the word of God.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; In Jamaica they they they don't go to
[59:19] church.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; But it takes the work to bring them to
[59:22] church.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't God awesome?
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't God He knows how to bring people
[59:27] in, you know.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; God is awesome.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; They come to work and end up in church.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless God. You know,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; amen. Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 11.
[59:40] We're having a good time, you know. Give
[59:42] me some time.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said Christ God Christ
[59:47] himself and it says and he gave and I
[59:51] want us to look at that word gave. And
[59:53] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[59:57] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:00:00] and teachers
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; for
[1:00:03] the perfecting of the saints. That's the
[1:00:06] purpose. Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, now remember these are gifts because
[1:00:10] if you notice in verse 8 he said and he
[1:00:13] when he ascended on high he led captive
[1:00:16] with the captive and he gave gifts unto
[1:00:18] men.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; So these apostle is a gift. A prophet
[1:00:23] prophets are gifts. I'm not talking a
[1:00:24] major prophet of of an age. No.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; You know a major prophet is is is not
[1:00:30] quote unquote a gift but is a messenger
[1:00:32] to the age.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. But you got prophets a
[1:00:35] gift and evangelist is a gift. Uh pastor
[1:00:38] is a gift and teachers are gift and so
[1:00:42] he said the purpose of that is for the
[1:00:44] perfecting of the saints. That mean the
[1:00:46] saints will be getting to perfection.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Or for the work of the ministry. All
[1:00:50] right.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Good for the edifying of the body of
[1:00:53] Christ.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, till we all come into the unity of
[1:00:59] what?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Not faith but the faith. Mhm.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So you got faith and you got the faith.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; So it's you have your faith which is
[1:01:08] without that you cannot please God but
[1:01:10] you got to come to the faith of the
[1:01:13] gospel.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; You got to come to the faith. Now this
[1:01:16] faith was established upon the apostles
[1:01:18] doctrine.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Upon the go apostle doctrine. Right.
[1:01:22] Because there's one place in the Bible
[1:01:24] that the word doctrine mentioned in this
[1:01:25] acts 2:42.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; They all continued that steadfast in the
[1:01:30] apostles doctrine.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Right? That's where Christ established
[1:01:33] his church. All right.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Good. And so look at this part of it.
[1:01:37] And of the knowledge of the son of God.
[1:01:40] So the saints which is the church
[1:01:43] coming to the knowledge of the son of
[1:01:46] God unto a perfect man
[1:01:50] onto the measure
[1:01:53] of the statue
[1:01:55] not just of Christ
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; but of the of
[1:02:01] the fullness
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; of Christ.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So the the thought that we
[1:02:09] can study on this morning is the full
[1:02:11] measurement.
[1:02:14] If you want us to put a title to that, a
[1:02:16] little focus on this, the full
[1:02:19] measurement.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; You know, a a lot of times we we, you
[1:02:22] know, growing up and different heroes in
[1:02:25] the ministry,
[1:02:27] the focus was so much on the five-fold.
[1:02:31] And nowadays, there's been such a war
[1:02:33] over the five-fold. and the five-fold is
[1:02:36] not needed anymore and all that type of
[1:02:39] thing and and and the emphasis placed on
[1:02:42] the five-fold ministry and you know it's
[1:02:45] just it's just sad out of ignorance. I
[1:02:47] said that you know uh
[1:02:52] we lose focus of what that is and you
[1:02:55] know uh the Bible said he gave gifts and
[1:02:57] sometimes we take it and it wasn't given
[1:02:59] to us
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; right
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; you know a lot of us take and wasn't
[1:03:02] given because my father was a pastor and
[1:03:04] so I'll be inheriting the chair
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; and it's more than that
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; you know my grandpa was a pastor of this
[1:03:11] and so I'm in line to inherit this
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; the gifts are not inheritance
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; they are given
[1:03:17] And so sometimes the pastor may not be
[1:03:20] the brightest guy among the preachers,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; but he has the gift of a pastor,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; you know, and so everything is just
[1:03:27] upside down sometimes in some areas,
[1:03:29] brother John.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That you know, you're surprised. And so
[1:03:32] the the saints will never come to
[1:03:34] perfection if the gifts are not placed.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; We can have a whole bunch of church and
[1:03:39] all we have is just a ritual over and
[1:03:41] over again,
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; right? because it's not being done
[1:03:45] properly,
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; you know, because I take the gift of an
[1:03:48] apostle and I feel that you can't talk
[1:03:50] to me because I have it and it was not
[1:03:52] my gift,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; but because I like it, I take it.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Just like an evangelist, you read six
[1:03:59] message books and you travel the whole
[1:04:01] world preaching and you you don't have a
[1:04:03] gift of an evangelist and you read six
[1:04:06] more and then you want a pastor. And so
[1:04:08] I ask you, who are you? No. Why? Last
[1:04:10] year you was an evangelist. Oh, I got
[1:04:12] promotion, brother Barkley. I'm a pastor
[1:04:14] now. And so it's much more than that,
[1:04:16] Satan.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I I'm your brother. I I want
[1:04:20] to tell you the truth,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's much more than that.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; But then when I say that the emphasis is
[1:04:26] placed on the on the on the fivefold
[1:04:29] when you're talking about the ministry
[1:04:32] and uh but but there this is what
[1:04:35] sometimes we miss.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in verse 11, till
[1:04:42] we all
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; come to the unity of the faith.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; That part of it is being
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; pushed aside,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. Because nowadays you may
[1:04:56] come to church and you know you're
[1:04:58] looking for it for Wednesday night or
[1:05:01] some of us do come and Sunday morning
[1:05:04] and you come you fold your arms and you
[1:05:07] expecting to be preached to.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; You know when you come with your burdens
[1:05:12] and you needed to be lifted by one
[1:05:14] person.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; All right. That's right.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And then uh you know you have no
[1:05:19] business who want to die die who want to
[1:05:21] sick. sake is is the pastors or the or
[1:05:24] the responsibility of the the the the
[1:05:28] evangelist. That's their job because the
[1:05:31] Bible speaks of fivefold,
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; But we forget that we all
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; has a responsibility.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have a responsibility
[1:05:44] to come to the full measure. Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Come to the full measure of the statue
[1:05:52] of Christ.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Every one of us saints of God,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; just as our God can speak to brother
[1:05:58] day, your pastor, he can speak to you,
[1:06:01] Sister Vicki.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; But he will never tell you to take his
[1:06:06] position.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; That's not of God.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; But God can speak to every one of us.
[1:06:11] And so,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; amen. We has to understand that when we
[1:06:16] talking about the full measurement, it
[1:06:18] is pointing to every person that are
[1:06:22] believers.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have to express
[1:06:28] the fullness of Christ.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Every one of us.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Now, we have different measures of
[1:06:39] course.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; To express the fullness of Christ.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; We were all created in the image of
[1:06:47] Almighty God. Every one of us in this
[1:06:50] building.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And I and as we said last night, God uh
[1:06:55] created us in a certain measure. And
[1:06:58] then later on in the life, God said,
[1:07:00] "Well, I'm thinking of something extra
[1:07:02] for you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to add it to what I
[1:07:06] put already." No.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Everything that God have for your life
[1:07:12] is already in you.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; But it takes seasons and season to bring
[1:07:20] that out.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. One time I was just a boy.
[1:07:25] Amen. But I I was always a husband.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; I was always a father. I was always a
[1:07:32] grandfather.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And all of that was in the loins of my
[1:07:36] father. All about me was on the loins of
[1:07:38] my father. But then there was a time
[1:07:41] when I was a little boy running all over
[1:07:43] the place. And as a Caesar changes, I
[1:07:46] become a teenager. And as a Caesar
[1:07:49] changes, I became a father. And as
[1:07:51] another Caesar come, I know a grandpa.
[1:07:54] And who knows if God permits another
[1:07:56] part of my attribute coming out which is
[1:07:59] called a great great grandfather.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; It was always there in the plan of God.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; But as she the Bible says Ecclesiastic
[1:08:06] 3:1 everything is governed on by season
[1:08:10] and a time and season for everything
[1:08:13] under the sun.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; So you are always who you are.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Come on saint. Hallelujah sir.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; A perfect man there the Bible speaks of
[1:08:28] is uh Amen. Glory to God is a complete
[1:08:33] man.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; When God speaks of the word perfect,
[1:08:38] he's referring to a complete man.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians chapter 1, Amen.
[1:08:44] in verse 22, Amen. speaks of who Christ
[1:08:48] is. And uh Christ being resurrected from
[1:08:52] the dead, the Bible says he's far above
[1:08:55] all principalities and power and might
[1:08:58] and dominion and every name that is
[1:09:01] name, not only in this world, but also
[1:09:05] in the in that which is to come. And he
[1:09:09] put all things under his feet, and gave
[1:09:12] him to be the head over all things, the
[1:09:16] church.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] which is his body.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And the fullness of him that fill all
[1:09:27] and in all.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So the church is the fullness of Christ.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; That y
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Christ is the head of the church.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; And it it is useless if we're here
[1:09:44] worshiping and Christ is not the head.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; If you disconnect my head from my body,
[1:09:51] I am dead.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; I am a lifeless corpse.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; So Christ, the Bible said God, Amen.
[1:10:01] when he worked in Christ, when he raised
[1:10:03] him from the dead, he placed him to be
[1:10:06] the head over all things, even the
[1:10:10] church. Amen. And the church is now
[1:10:14] expressing the fullness of Christ.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; We cannot express nothing less.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; But the fullness of Christ. Because
[1:10:25] remember, Amen. for your hand to to
[1:10:28] operate it get the intelligence from the
[1:10:30] head.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; If your finger is to operate, the
[1:10:34] intelligence come from the head.
[1:10:37] And so if you disconnect this
[1:10:39] intelligence, you have no life in you.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And so when you understand that the
[1:10:48] church, the body is complete when she
[1:10:52] enters union with Christ.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, beautiful
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Christ. Amen.
[1:11:01] And she is now a complete Christ.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we talk about Christ, do
[1:11:08] realize that the church is the Christ
[1:11:12] that is representing the kingdom of God.
[1:11:15] You're in hurt.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the truth.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And I love the word of the Bible says we
[1:11:24] have fellowship one with another.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have fellowship with you which
[1:11:29] is actually the God in you.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; The Christ in you is able to connect
[1:11:35] with me
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; when the Christ in me as Paul says the
[1:11:39] works that I'm doing is not myself.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; It's the Christ working through me.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; That is why a true believer that is
[1:11:50] filled with the spirit of God, we don't
[1:11:53] see colors or nationalities.
[1:11:56] We see Christ
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; and that Christ cannot be counterized.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; You cannot put him in a region or a
[1:12:04] custom. He is universal because he's a
[1:12:08] spirit.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Now is the words to his wife constantly
[1:12:15] ringing in her ears. The prophet says
[1:12:18] when Christ said because I live in the
[1:12:20] book of John chapter 14 from verse 19.
[1:12:24] The prophet said when Christ says
[1:12:26] because I live you shall live also. He
[1:12:30] said he was speaking and he is still
[1:12:32] speaking to his wife.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. Yeah.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; He took the ultimate manifestation
[1:12:41] of God in Christ
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; to bring those disciples to the
[1:12:46] knowledge of the son of God.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; And this knowledge does not come by just
[1:12:53] reading and reading. It comes by
[1:12:56] revelation.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. hit them and that brought
[1:13:01] that knowledge of the son of God that
[1:13:04] the ministry is bringing us to is what
[1:13:08] produced the joy that those apostles
[1:13:11] found.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said to them in John chapter
[1:13:16] 16 22, when you get that joy, he said,
[1:13:19] you are sorrowing now, but when you get
[1:13:22] that joy, no man can take it from you.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't understand it. Amen. When
[1:13:28] you put that to John chapter 14 from
[1:13:31] verse 9 from verse 19 Jesus said a
[1:13:34] little while and the world won't see me
[1:13:37] but you are going to see me.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was she talking about? They
[1:13:42] walked with Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; They h with him. They fished with him
[1:13:46] and they fellowship with him and all
[1:13:49] those miracles were good. But when they
[1:13:52] saw, Amen. their witness, Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; They witness him hang on the cross.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; They knew that his body was wrapped
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; and placed in a super,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But then here is he standing before me.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; He's standing before them in that room.
[1:14:15] Amen. And he said to them, "I'm not a
[1:14:18] spirit. Feel my hand and my side. It is
[1:14:22] still me. He went further. He said,
[1:14:24] "Give me something to eat. Let me show
[1:14:27] you and my spirit." Oh, when the joy
[1:14:32] filled their hearts,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; you know what they overcame? They
[1:14:36] overcame the fear of death.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; My Lord God, now he's alive. Oh, death,
[1:14:43] where is your st?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; No grave can hold this body. My Lord
[1:14:50] went and he became the first fruit of
[1:14:53] them that slept.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That joy.
[1:15:03] Oh, God.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You ever thought of that before?
[1:15:08] Amen. The knowledge of the son of God is
[1:15:12] lacking.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Knowledge is lacking.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm not talking the
[1:15:19] intellectual hash of knowledge. I'm
[1:15:21] talking the knowledge revelation of the
[1:15:24] son of God.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; When knowledge is absent, fear is
[1:15:30] present
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; and doubt will be lurking around your
[1:15:34] home. Doubt will be lurking around the
[1:15:37] church.
[1:15:39] And for therefore you find there is no
[1:15:42] joy in fellowship.
[1:15:44] Brothers and sisters, coming to
[1:15:47] fellowship now become like if I can and
[1:15:50] when I want to
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; because there is no joy of us coming
[1:15:55] together because iron shorten iron and
[1:15:59] if I mean I amen it's supposed to be
[1:16:02] time where I look at you as the body of
[1:16:05] God the body of Christ. I'm discerning
[1:16:09] the body of Christ. This is more than a
[1:16:12] a piece of bread and drinking wine.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Call that communion is good.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; But this is more than that. Brothers and
[1:16:20] sisters,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; no wonder communion today with the
[1:16:24] literal bread and the wine become a
[1:16:27] ritual,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Because people still not discerning
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; the Lord's body.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; It's not that bread. Hallelujah.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; It's you and I. when you there ought
[1:16:41] have to be a time you can only wait for
[1:16:44] Sunday morning because I want to shake
[1:16:47] your hand. I want to greet my sister.
[1:16:51] Why? Because I acknowledge that we are
[1:16:55] all here temporarily.
[1:16:57] We all here we need to enjoy the company
[1:17:01] of each other. But all that is lost. I
[1:17:05] come when I want to and I come when I
[1:17:08] can and if I feel like. Oh God, help the
[1:17:12] church today who is called the body of
[1:17:15] Christ. We have to express the full
[1:17:19] measure or we're expressing none at all.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Look at this.
[1:17:37] God creates attributes in us.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And it was the prophet who came and
[1:17:43] taught us.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; What it meant
[1:17:47] when he said all that God was, he poured
[1:17:49] into Christ.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was, he poured into
[1:17:53] us.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; The song we sung to be like Jesus.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful song,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; But that's the message,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; right? Yep. Yep. Yep. That's right.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; The time of Abraham.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; We said a lot of things last night, but
[1:18:08] it's okay if we say it again.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to hear it.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; In the time of Abram as he interceded
[1:18:15] for the life
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; for Oh, glory to God. For you. Okay, let
[1:18:19] me back up a little bit.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Colossians chapter 1
[1:18:25] and verse 15, and let's look at it if
[1:18:28] you want to. Glory to God a little bit
[1:18:31] here.
[1:18:32] bad.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1
[1:18:39] verse 15- 16
[1:18:43] speaking of Jesus Christ who is the
[1:18:46] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[1:18:49] of every creature.
[1:18:52] For for by him are all things created
[1:18:57] that are in heaven and that are in
[1:18:59] earth, visible and invisible,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; whether they be thrones or dominions or
[1:19:06] principalities or powers. Can we say
[1:19:09] that together? All things were created
[1:19:13] what? By him and for him. That's
[1:19:19] interesting.
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:23] So it's not for us, it's for him.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; So I don't own the church is for him.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if all things Amen. If you
[1:19:42] heard the words of worship in Revelation
[1:19:45] 4:1 from the four 20 the 24 held on the
[1:19:48] four beasts they confirm it this verse.
[1:19:52] Amen. For all things were created for
[1:19:54] his pleasure.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Which means his will, his favor, his
[1:20:00] satisfaction.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So whatever comes out, God let it comes
[1:20:05] out to satisfy himself.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You heard what I just said. Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; So all things were he created.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; So no matter how we we enjoy it or we
[1:20:18] express it, he brought it out of us for
[1:20:22] his satisfaction.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; No matter how it looks. And so the book
[1:20:28] of Genesis chapter 126, God shall let us
[1:20:32] create man in our own image. What? After
[1:20:38] our likeness.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. the image after the likeness in
[1:20:43] Genesis verse the next verse.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; God created
[1:20:48] man in his own image. You don't see
[1:20:50] likeness there.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You don't see likeness there. He said
[1:21:00] this is how I'm going to do it. I'm
[1:21:02] going to create man out of my own image,
[1:21:04] after my likeness. And then he actually
[1:21:06] create man. Man was a spirit man.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Sure was
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; all every every attribute of God was
[1:21:15] already created in man.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; But the likeness comes from you.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; The light, you know, because God Amen.
[1:21:32] All things were created for him and by
[1:21:34] him. So God will set conditions and
[1:21:38] situations
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; to bring out his likeness through your
[1:21:42] life.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Right.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Which means to act like him.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; To bring out an attribute.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So we cannot just get up and manifest
[1:21:59] the attribute of our home. God create
[1:22:02] the situation.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; God create the condition. I'm getting
[1:22:10] there. You may not. Some of you trying
[1:22:12] to Oh, where's he going? I get
[1:22:15] understand. I can see the expression of
[1:22:16] the fishes.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; God. Okay. Okay. Let me just bring it
[1:22:20] down. Brothers and sisters, God is not
[1:22:22] going to hold you by the collar.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Squeeze your collar like robots.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; I said, "Act like me.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Act like me." No. No.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; God create the situation.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Bring you to the situation.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There you go.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Because there's an attribute of God in
[1:22:43] you that he's pulling out.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; God says, Amen. God could have gone to
[1:22:51] Sodom and Gomorra and destroyed himself
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; without saying a thing to Abraham.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; God don't need to consult us. Right.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; But God said, "I'm going to tell
[1:23:02] Abraham."
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; What was God doing? Oh, hallelujah.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God was pulling out
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; of Abraham an attribute called
[1:23:12] intercessor.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You heard the fullness
[1:23:17] now.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; You see the the complete measure
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; is image and likeness.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; You see the full measure now?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Image and likeness.
[1:23:30] Oh, glory to God.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; That's the full measure.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We're getting some here
[1:23:36] this morning.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; So, sitting down in church, you're
[1:23:38] enjoying some service. Hey, saints,
[1:23:40] there are some things that God will put
[1:23:42] before you.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; It's not to destroy you, but to pull out
[1:23:45] a likeness,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; to pull out an attribute
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; that sometime it laid dorm on for 40
[1:23:51] years.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; God said, I'm going to pull that out of
[1:23:54] you. Oh, I'm going to pull that out of
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; because I'm looking for full measure.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want half. I want full measure.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, God will let your God will let your
[1:24:07] pastor hate you. God will let your
[1:24:10] pastor speak evil against you. And God
[1:24:12] knows that that cannot defeat purpose.
[1:24:15] He's just bringing something out of you.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to love him anyhow. I'm going
[1:24:19] to respect his office. You didn't know
[1:24:21] where it's coming from. God was bringing
[1:24:24] out his likeness.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Woo. God.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; There are many more we can talk about in
[1:24:34] the house of Isaac.
[1:24:36] You remember that? Amen. Before the
[1:24:38] foundation of the world, God says, and
[1:24:41] brother Paul pick it up in Romans
[1:24:43] chapter 9:1.
[1:24:44] He said, "Before there were he bonded,
[1:24:46] before there were evil conceived, he dam
[1:24:50] Jacob have thy love and Esau have
[1:24:53] hated." Is that what the Bible says? I
[1:24:55] tell you where it is.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; But then you saw the actual happening of
[1:25:01] it. Brother said, "I if he was choosing
[1:25:04] a man, he would have choose Esau
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; because he was more manly."
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; But it's not what you choose, it's what
[1:25:10] God says.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Y
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; think about it.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; He created for himself, not yours.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; We're having a good time this morning,
[1:25:28] isn't it?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And you think about it. Glory to God.
[1:25:32] Amen. Isaac favorite. You know, the
[1:25:34] Bible really clearly say Isaac favorite
[1:25:37] was Esau.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And Rebecca's favorite was Jacob.
[1:25:44] That's the truth.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints of God. And you know what?
[1:25:49] Rebecca used deception.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; To bring Jacob forward for a lifelong
[1:26:00] blessing
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; and the fulfillment of covenant.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what it just says?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; What did she use?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Deception.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. See, see
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; to the unlearned and ignorant like some
[1:26:16] of us,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; we said it's deception.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; But in God's plan is fulfillment of the
[1:26:22] word.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; In God's plan is bringing forth his
[1:26:30] purpose.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; She deceived Isaac.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Everything. She at one point Jacob was
[1:26:38] so scared. Jacob said that mama you know
[1:26:41] then well you know what if daddy finds
[1:26:43] out won't I be cursed
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; mama don't know would I be cursed if
[1:26:48] daddy find out that I'm actually
[1:26:50] tricking him to get this and she said
[1:26:52] you don't worry about that let all the
[1:26:53] curse come up on me
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I will take all the curse that you think
[1:26:58] of
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; that's a mama's love glory to God
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; and then and then you wonder brothers
[1:27:05] and sisters you know but God create that
[1:27:08] Yeah,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; it was designed by God
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and God was just sitting on the banister
[1:27:15] of glory and God inspired Rebecca to do
[1:27:19] that. Yes, God did.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Incredible.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; To produce the full measurement.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Jacob lived and suffered deception under
[1:27:29] the hands of his in-laws. But God's
[1:27:32] method of training him for promotion.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Mhm.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; God's method of training us many times
[1:27:47] is pain,
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; suffering,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; rejection,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; isolation,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; but God is training us to bring out the
[1:27:58] full measurement,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; all things created by him.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And for him. Do you know the Bible said
[1:28:06] God created evil?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:4, God created evil for the
[1:28:12] day of the wicked.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; That's why Job says if good come from
[1:28:16] God, why can't evil?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; So you can imagine my crop there and
[1:28:20] Amen. all of the crop die. And you know,
[1:28:22] God was just saying, "Let me see what
[1:28:24] he's going to do now."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There you go.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; For sure.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; sis? Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, there was no sun and the the mean
[1:28:34] the worms come out and this amen and
[1:28:36] devoured my crop and here I am go to
[1:28:38] church. I preached in church last week.
[1:28:40] God is a good God. Let's keep praising
[1:28:43] in every situation.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And then God said, "Let me see whether
[1:28:46] you believe what your preacher or not."
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And here is my crop devoued. I'm coming
[1:28:51] to church next week with my wings
[1:28:53] dropped because my crop died. And I just
[1:28:57] preach and tell somebody else to be of
[1:28:59] good courage. I told somebody what Joe
[1:29:02] been through and here I am with my wings
[1:29:05] dropped and my face drop and oh God says
[1:29:09] I need the full measure son.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God allowed it and in spite of all
[1:29:16] that I supposed to be worshiping God.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; I'm supposed to be worshiping God. He
[1:29:23] created all things for his plan. You
[1:29:26] know some things God do. We just don't
[1:29:28] know why.
[1:29:30] That's right.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Can I can I encourage us? We shouldn't
[1:29:35] ask him why.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; If we understand the knowledge of God.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know God formed the first
[1:29:45] religion?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus confirmed that to the poor little
[1:29:51] sister up there. She's my sister in the
[1:29:53] way.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Nobody mentioned her name, but she's my
[1:29:55] sister at the well.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, sir.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody called her name.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; But she's my sister.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Graham says that she was a true
[1:30:07] daughter of Abraham.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And only true seed of Abraham can
[1:30:11] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; So, everybody call her the woman at the
[1:30:16] but I call her my sister.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. You know her past. I know
[1:30:22] she married five times and the one that
[1:30:24] she was living in was not hers. You
[1:30:25] don't need to remind me of that. She's
[1:30:27] my sister.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Is that right, church?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus said Jesus said it is my utmost
[1:30:35] important because when I do what I see,
[1:30:37] my father does.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; My father sent me to her because she has
[1:30:41] to be sealed in.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I imagine God watched a little girl grow
[1:30:47] up in our city and she married and the
[1:30:50] first marriage never worked out and she
[1:30:52] was and she tried the second one never
[1:30:54] worked out and the Oh, come on. Can you
[1:30:56] are you counting?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; And she got the third one never count
[1:30:59] out. Oh God and every mother-in-law,
[1:31:03] every family in the community would tell
[1:31:06] their boys don't go there.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; But Jesus.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; For the Lord, God was watching his
[1:31:19] daughter going through that.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He sure was.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; All things were for him.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; She gone four now.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; She's gone four now.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. And those in-laws probably
[1:31:35] biting their nails.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; What's next?
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Is she going to leave him again? I don't
[1:31:42] know. I don't know who the f
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I believe God put it there for us.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; All that.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Five marriages. That's a simple church.
[1:31:53] Yeah.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And she was living with a guy who wasn't
[1:31:55] even sure she was going to marry him or
[1:31:56] not because everything else still
[1:31:58] working.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And Jesus tell Jesus tell the disciples,
[1:32:02] "Guys, I I've got a mission. You can't
[1:32:03] come.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; this is not for you. You go buy food.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; You can't handle this.
[1:32:11] [Applause]
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; You can't handle this.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It's bigger than you do.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Can you hear me in the
[1:32:21] back? You can handle this. This is
[1:32:23] bigger than you. You go buy food. Yes,
[1:32:26] sir.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus, I've got needs. I've got You know
[1:32:27] what I mean? I've got needs.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; It's necessary. It's important. I have
[1:32:32] to go to Samaria.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; This is when Jesus actually confirmed
[1:32:38] the religion separation.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; God himself started it
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; when God had a group all of us the whole
[1:32:45] creation and God take out a group of
[1:32:48] people and said this is my set. This is
[1:32:50] my people. This is high of a apple of my
[1:32:53] high. God gave them a bunch of laws for
[1:32:56] themselves.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Abram didn't have it. Edom never needed
[1:33:03] it.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Abram, I mean, Adam never need it.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; My brother H never need it.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; But then God just have a group of people
[1:33:12] set them aside and said, "This is yours.
[1:33:14] This is yours. And if you do that, you
[1:33:15] do that and then I'll do this
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; and you must keep it throughout your
[1:33:19] generations.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And Jesus came and said to the woman
[1:33:22] says, "Well, we have church up in the
[1:33:24] mountain." In fact, she had because
[1:33:26] Ephraim build
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Ephraim build altar up the mountains.
[1:33:32] Give them.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; And that well Jacob was owned by Jacob.
[1:33:36] Hallelujah.
[1:33:37] And she says, "Well, we worship up here
[1:33:39] and you people says Jerusalem is where
[1:33:43] is where people are to worship." Jesus
[1:33:45] said, "You are so right. We we look at
[1:33:47] that pronoun. We we know who we worship
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; because this is where you're supposed to
[1:33:54] come to church."
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "This is the season. I'm
[1:34:00] here."
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; I am here now.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All that place of worship
[1:34:07] is going to change. Uh region of worship
[1:34:10] is going to change. Uh nationality is
[1:34:13] going to change. Glory to God. This is a
[1:34:16] spiritual worship.

[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Was it

[1:34:33] I said when you know if you notice
[1:34:34] something of Jacob was so repentive he
[1:34:37] the Bible said he bowed seven time
[1:34:39] before Esau when he reach Esau

[1:35:14] what are these for, brother? Take them.
[1:35:16] Take them. You know, these are for you."
[1:35:18] He's trying to bring gifts for
[1:35:20] repentance. He said, "I don't need it.
[1:35:21] Keep it."
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Bobby said, "You found grace in the
[1:35:25] sight of Jesus."
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; He did.

[1:35:35] out of Esau?
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; The one that God says I hated his ways.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that God would
[1:35:42] anoint a bunch of birds to go and feed
[1:35:44] his prophet?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Not dogs,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; the clean pretty ones,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; but meat eaters.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Ravens.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The food measure.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; We're talking about
[1:36:01] Is that right, city of God?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that God will anoint
[1:36:05] your neighbor that hate you so much with
[1:36:09] grace?
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that God anointed
[1:36:13] the Egyptians that hated the Israel all
[1:36:16] along and enslaved them. Amen. It's so
[1:36:19] much so that God said, "Borrow from
[1:36:21] everybody all you can."
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; It's so much so before they left. Amen.
[1:36:26] They were just saying, "You want more?
[1:36:27] What else you want?" Amen. You You think
[1:36:29] you got enough? You think No, these were
[1:36:32] slave masters. Same to their slaves.
[1:36:34] Amen. You think you got enough gold? Oh,
[1:36:36] you want silver, too? Oh, yo, you sure
[1:36:39] you got enough? They left Egypt pretty
[1:36:42] rich.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Because God anointed the enemy of God
[1:36:50] with grace.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] Wow.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I look at it this way. The hatred and
[1:37:06] the jealousy towards Joseph was God
[1:37:11] molding and forging and training Joseph
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; to bring out attribute
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; for preservation.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. They hated him
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; in so much so that Joseph brothers and
[1:37:27] isolated him and threw him in a pit and
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; you know, and they sold him out and
[1:37:31] Joseph, you know, it was the Bible says
[1:37:33] after Joseph saw them and all of that,
[1:37:34] he spoke to them in a different language
[1:37:36] and cuz he knew the language.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; You see, he never allowed the pit the
[1:37:40] prison
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; and the different region to change his
[1:37:43] original language.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; That's a message in itself,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But he maintain the lang. He could speak
[1:37:49] the language.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; But then he came over Egypt and learned
[1:37:52] another language and then he it
[1:37:54] obviously he spoke to them through
[1:37:55] interpreter.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; He dressed different.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; They couldn't recognize him.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Everything changed. His features
[1:38:07] changed.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And he he purposely spoke to them
[1:38:10] through interpreter.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He did. Then the Bible says after
[1:38:13] a while the all his visions came back to
[1:38:15] him
[1:38:16] and when the brothers came so repentant
[1:38:18] before him and say, "Oh my God, we're
[1:38:20] sorry, Joseph. Relax. Relax." God made
[1:38:22] you do it.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; God anointed you to hate me.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; God anointed you to to despise me. God
[1:38:32] anointed you to go back and tell your I
[1:38:34] mean your daddy a bunch of lies.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:38] And then God all that the whole
[1:38:41] community now forget the visions of
[1:38:43] Joseph all that he had and oh I knew he
[1:38:46] was a liar and here he is he's dead and
[1:38:49] all those features that he got seems to
[1:38:51] go but no the vision tret has to come to
[1:38:54] pass.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:58] All that surround Joseph was God
[1:39:01] maturing an attribute
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; in Joseph to manifest his likeness
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; for his own pleasure.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; God blinded Jacob so that the younger of
[1:39:15] Joseph's sons, Amen, could receive the
[1:39:18] anointing from the father.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; A new chapter that God established from
[1:39:25] the beginning. Because God, the prophet
[1:39:28] said, God does not improve upon his
[1:39:30] word.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; God infiltrated
[1:39:36] into the house of Egypt, into the house
[1:39:39] of Egypt and Israelite.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what was it? God was
[1:39:45] training Moses.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; To be a messenger for that dispensation.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. That's unusual.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's an unusual anointing.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And then what is it? Glory. Amen. Moses
[1:40:01] went down to Ethiopia. Remember in the
[1:40:04] book of Kings, first Kings and Ezra
[1:40:07] chapter 9, God said to Israel, you do
[1:40:11] not marry their sons or your their sons
[1:40:15] marry their daughter. I am separating
[1:40:18] you from all of the nations. Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; But yet God in all of that, God slipped
[1:40:23] in grace.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Can we talk a little bit more?
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; God slipped in an Ethiopian wife to
[1:40:32] Moses.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You didn't see that, did you?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Huh? You know, the
[1:40:39] prophet of God preached a message, why
[1:40:41] are we not a denomination?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; In 1958,
[1:40:45] why he said that? He said because
[1:40:48] denomination separates brotherhood,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You said that.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Denomination separate brotherhood.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; That's about the truth.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; The same prophet says,
[1:41:09] I'm going to show you something here.
[1:41:15] this 1960.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; 58. You say, "Why are we not the
[1:41:21] denomination?" Some of us take it up so
[1:41:23] much and think that the church next door
[1:41:24] is denomination. It's not.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Denominationalism is a spirit.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; You can be sitting in a message shirt
[1:41:32] for 50 years.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Now, you're just a sweet little
[1:41:35] Catholic.
[1:41:39] Yes, sir.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:41:45] I've seen
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; sweet little Catholic brother.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Nobody can talk to you. Nobody can teach
[1:41:50] you nothing.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You knows everything.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; A sweet little theologian.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Help us Jesus.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet says.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Determined to speak. I want you to get
[1:42:02] this church this morning which in the
[1:42:05] different denomination you are still the
[1:42:07] church of the living God together.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:42:12] I wonder if you realize what's happening
[1:42:14] in these meetings,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; God is bringing a generation to
[1:42:18] understand God.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Yep. Yep.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; My little Pentecostal brother last night
[1:42:27] in some in some countries you you you
[1:42:29] would throw in my head a long time.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You would fling me. Oh, you're not come
[1:42:32] because you don't believe the prophet.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Just before I came, there was a lady
[1:42:37] came to me. She says, she said, "Brother
[1:42:39] Bartley, um, you know, there's a
[1:42:40] Pentecostal church down the road and
[1:42:42] they don't believe the message and there
[1:42:44] was a lady down there sent up to my
[1:42:45] church requesting prayer."
[1:42:49] But because we don't believe that we
[1:42:51] supposed to pray for the other churches,
[1:42:52] what do you think? Oh my Jesus Christ.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; No, I'm I'm I'm I'm speaking the truth
[1:42:57] before you, my brothers and sisters. We
[1:43:00] don't believe that, you know, because
[1:43:01] they're denomination. We don't believe
[1:43:02] that we should pray for them because,
[1:43:04] you know, they're not in the message. I
[1:43:06] said, "Then who you ought to pray for?"
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you. I I love that statement.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; He should now in every different
[1:43:24] denominations, you are still the church
[1:43:27] of the living God together. He said,
[1:43:28] "This is the thing I want to get to
[1:43:30] you." Oh, God.
[1:43:33] that we are not really divided.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; We are the stones that cut in different
[1:43:41] forms all to the glory of God.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, look it up.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Finally, the message discernment 1960.

[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; He said nationalism it was separate
[1:44:02] brother wood.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; So that we can have a whole nice group
[1:44:06] of people under the but we are
[1:44:07] separated.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; You can have all of us and then we come
[1:44:10] to brother day church and before you
[1:44:12] know it you have five different churches
[1:44:13] under the same building.

[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Anointed people understand what I'm
[1:44:21] saying.

[1:44:24] churches under the one pastor.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. Amen.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; That's the That's a That's a building
[1:44:31] with five different denominations, sir.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Can I go further?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; We should never judge the man by the
[1:44:44] denomination that he belongs to.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; We should always judge him by the spirit
[1:44:49] he has.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I'm preaching here this
[1:44:56] morning. Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; The brother, I don't remember his name.
[1:45:02] He's sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
[1:45:03] brother. He came before I preached last
[1:45:05] night. Amen. And he hugged me so tight.
[1:45:07] I haven't had such a hug in a long
[1:45:09] while.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And he hugged me and he squeezed me.
[1:45:13] Amen. And I and he, as you introduced me
[1:45:15] as Pentecostal, brother. And I tell you
[1:45:17] what, and he squeezed me. Amen. Listen
[1:45:20] this carefully. And when he squeezed me,
[1:45:22] he was praying for me. He said, "May the
[1:45:24] Holy Spirit anoint you to speak to us
[1:45:27] tonight." And I know that God had Elijah
[1:45:31] for this age. And his name was William
[1:45:33] Brandom, the Elijah for the age. And he
[1:45:35] was just ministering in my spirit.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. What an
[1:45:41] anointing.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; What an anointing. Is that right,
[1:45:45] saints?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; You think about God creating nothing can
[1:45:49] happen unless God allow it. So God of a
[1:45:52] Baptist stone down there, God of a
[1:45:54] Methodist stone up here, God of a
[1:45:56] Pentecostal stone over there. Oh, God of
[1:45:59] another Catholic stone. Who created it?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says all things. It never say
[1:46:08] everybody. He said all things were
[1:46:10] created by him and for him.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Can I say this more?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Can I go further?
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said judge him by the spirit.
[1:46:22] See whether he is latter rain, former
[1:46:25] rain, inner rain or outer rain or no
[1:46:28] rain, whatever it might be, we should
[1:46:30] never judge him by that. But we judge
[1:46:33] him by his spirit.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; We ought to concern the spirit.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What the man has in his
[1:46:40] mind. Oh God,
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; what he has, what he's trying to
[1:46:45] achieve. If the man is a gift or no
[1:46:48] matter what it is, how great the gift
[1:46:50] is, you judge him by the spirit.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; God created.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Can I testify to you?
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; I personally have been transformed.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I've been transformed. Hallelujah.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; When I just came to this message and you
[1:47:09] know you know so much. We were so bright
[1:47:12] up here brother John
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; but you know you read like four or five
[1:47:15] books per per week and you were so
[1:47:18] packed. I was so full. You know this
[1:47:21] this is no stomach to what I had
[1:47:22] spiritually

[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; You know we have can I remind you?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:47:50] 2:00 ain't coming to bed. Yes. I soon
[1:47:52] come to more house
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; and I I would do that. You know what I
[1:47:57] would do? I would walk down to the the
[1:47:59] the little church down different areas
[1:48:01] and I would sit in the back because I
[1:48:03] was so heady and they had the little
[1:48:06] Bible studies and I know what I know and
[1:48:08] I was like, "Okay."
[1:48:10] And I would pop some questions in their
[1:48:12] little Bible studies because I know it.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; You see that spirit?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; I know it. And then they couldn't answer
[1:48:19] what I asked them. And then, man, I
[1:48:21] would
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; whip them.
[1:48:24] I would slaughter them with the word,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; you know, and I would do I'm confessing
[1:48:29] it. Is that all right,
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; man? I would slaughter them with the
[1:48:33] word because I know so much. And at the
[1:48:35] end of it, I walk out and I felt, man, I
[1:48:37] just killed them with the word
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; and I felt so good about myself. I
[1:48:42] slaughter some people and I wasn't
[1:48:44] giving life.

[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; God had to convert me.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I had no message, but I wasn't
[1:49:10] converted.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; God had to convert me and said, I never
[1:49:15] said my word for that.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have the full measure. You are
[1:49:21] in my image, but you are not manifesting
[1:49:23] my likeness.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus went into a He went into the
[1:49:28] village and they brought sick and lame
[1:49:30] and dumb and everybody in the Bible said
[1:49:33] Jesus had compassion.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I never had compassion. I had pride.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And Almighty came to his church. He fed
[1:49:45] 5,000 miraculously. How many love them?
[1:49:48] He's fed 7,000 another time. How many
[1:49:52] did he said follow him? No. Hallelujah.
[1:49:55] They went their separate ways and God

[1:50:11] road and uh greet a person. Uh show them
[1:50:15] love. Uh show them kindness.
[1:50:18] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was, he poured into
[1:50:24] me.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Love, love, love, love.

[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Let me go for it a little bit more.
[1:50:43] Right.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Has God's people failed them in
[1:50:48] worshiping when they worship idols?
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; And God said, Moses, I said it last
[1:50:57] night, Moses,
[1:50:59] all along, God said. Listen what God
[1:51:01] says. God says, Moses, I've heard the
[1:51:04] big cry of my people.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; I am come down to deliver them.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; This is the time when the people
[1:51:10] backslid
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; when they worshiping the golden calf.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; What did God say? Moses, your people.
[1:51:15] Before
[1:51:19] it was God's God was that my people.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Read it in Exodus chapter 32.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; God said to Moses, "Your people got
[1:51:26] slain
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; and they're worshiping idols."
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. God. Hey, God. Hey, God is God
[1:51:35] is awesome. Is that right?
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; He has ways and means to put words. Oh,
[1:51:39] God.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; God. All along they were God's people,
[1:51:43] but now they always just say, "God,
[1:51:44] Moses, your people down there giving
[1:51:46] trouble. I'm going to destroy them and
[1:51:49] build a nation out of you." Remember,
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Moses kids were half Egyptians,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Sorry. They were half Ethiopians, right?
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; My apology cuz his wife was Ethiopian,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And Moses was Israelite. So they were

[1:53:23] them. They don't have a clue what
[1:53:25] they're doing."
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; As they pick the stones up the stone,
[1:53:30] Stephen, Amen. He said, "Father, forgive
[1:53:33] them. don't even lay their sin to their

[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; God said don't bring them in. But yet
[1:53:53] still, as a matter of fact, he didn't

[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; a God that brought in Esther. And even
[1:54:27] though Vashi, Amen, refused to come to
[1:54:30] her husband and all of that, it was
[1:54:32] God's plan. Oh yes. God said, "I caused
[1:54:34] her to reject the king's command so that
[1:54:37] Esther can come in and bring her in the
[1:54:40] kingdom for this purpose."

[1:54:52] don't eat that, and if you eat that,
[1:54:54] this will happen to you. And then God
[1:54:56] turn around and tell Peter, "Don't you
[1:54:58] ever call anything thy great."

[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; He went in the desert by himself, left
[1:55:38] the servant in Beetho, and said, "I'm
[1:55:40] going to die." And he went there, lay
[1:55:42] down to die. The angel woke him up,
[1:55:45] found food, and gave it to him.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; You know what? He ate it. And what

[1:56:16] was not about Elijah.

[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; When you're mature, you understand that
[2:07:48] God can take a drunk card off the road
[2:07:51] and bring me in church and save him. God
[2:07:54] can take her right out from over there
[2:07:56] and
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; bring her in the church and marry a
[2:07:59] preacher. Yes, he will.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; God can tell a Joseph to marry Mary. God

[2:15:26] just a real quick story. I want Ken
[2:15:28] Rhonda to come and sing Amazing Grace.
[2:15:30] And I'll add the words when I can. But
[2:15:32] uh you know there was a story goes right
[2:15:36] along with your message pastor that uh
[2:15:39] kids in the classroom the old days the
[2:15:42] one of the kids lost their watch.
[2:15:44] Parents bought him a watch. Kids lost
[2:15:46] the watch. Somebody stole the watch. And
[2:15:48] so he ran to the teacher and said
[2:15:50] somebody stole my watch. The teacher
[2:15:52] asked all the kids and said hey we got
[2:15:54] to find this watch. You know and nobody
[2:15:57] would surrender the watch.
[2:16:01] And so the teacher said, "We got to all
[2:16:03] line you up across the chalkboard." He
[2:16:06] said, "We want everybody close your
[2:16:07] eyes." He said, "I, the teacher, I'm
[2:16:11] going to check all your pockets and I'm
[2:16:13] going to find a watch."
[2:16:16] And so the teacher did. We'll just say
[2:16:19] the teacher found the watch in my
[2:16:22] pocket.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; The teacher found the watch in the
[2:16:25] pocket. And the boy
[2:16:28] that had the watch was just completely
[2:16:31] humiliated
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; because he knew that the teacher knew
[2:16:37] that he was a liar.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; And so 25 years later, he's a grown man.
[2:16:43] He's got a family. Teacher calls him up.
[2:16:46] He sees the teacher at a reunion.
[2:16:48] The moment he seen the teacher's eyes,
[2:16:51] he relived the watch. He said, "That
[2:16:55] teacher knows that I'm a liar."
[2:16:59] And so he was all embarrassed and just
[2:17:01] could hardly control himself. And he
[2:17:03] went to the teacher and he confessed to
[2:17:06] the teacher. He said, "All I could think
[2:17:07] about is you finding the watch when you
[2:17:10] lined us up in the chalkboard." He said,
[2:17:12] "I knew you know who had the watch." And
[2:17:15] the teacher told him years later
[2:17:19] said, "I closed my eyes, too, because I
[2:17:23] never even trusted myself."
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; She said, "I didn't know you had stoli.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; I just went by every kid with my eyes
[2:17:30] closed and I checked every pocket
[2:17:33] because I didn't even trust me to know
[2:17:36] to know who had the watch."
[2:17:39] And 25 years later, here's the brother
[2:17:42] thinking that teacher will still hate me
[2:17:43] and think I'm a robber.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; The teacher said,
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; "I don't know. Cuz my eyes were closed."
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't know cuz my eyes were closed.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; That's kind of got me. God's eyes were
[2:17:57] closed, too.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
