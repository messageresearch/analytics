TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he'll be with us so we don't we have him until the following Tuesday he goes back on the 14th and just uh just just keep them in your prayers like the the services and we want to see God we we don't want to see just people people are nice but we want to see God amen amen Matthew 9:36 and 38 to 38 and I want to preach on something or God wants to preach on something your ministry in the body of Christ and and and even before we read the scriptures I want to I want to put a disclaimer out there I'm not talking about ministers only because our Prophet said that every single person here this morning as their own ministry as their own Ministry and that's not talked about very much but I want to talk about that and how that we are to build up the body of Christ by supporting other people in their Ministry and in their battles because if you have a Ministry this morning you have a battle and so you have both hallelujah amen Matthew 9:36 but when Jesus s when he Jesus saw the multitudes he was moved watch that watch that characteristic amen he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and they were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd and then he said unto his disciples the Harvest is truly plenteous but the laborers are very few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he'll send forth laborers into the Harvest and let's just turn to another scripture here I'm just 2 Chronicles 20 and I want to read 15 I believe and we're going to preach on Jehoshaphat this morning some and just uh how God works in his body 2 Chronicles uh 20 15 hearken ye all Juda Juda and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and thy King J josifi thus saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor be dismayed by the reason of the great multitude for the battle it's not your yours but God's Hallelujah and God tells them what and where that'll it'll happen amen Lord Jesus we ask that you would add your blessing to the reading of the word this morning Lord Jesus and we just give you the glory and honor for it in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning I just want to read some quotes just to lay a foundation here right at the beginning amen of our are scriptures here here the prophet was saying he said you know he preached many times the greatest battle ever fought he said he said we are his the soldiers of the Cross and let's press the battle and pray and study into his word amen he said here I'm just trying to find my SP here hallelujah amen there we go revelations in the 60s he said that's the reason we have such a battle is because when we're when we Minister the word god exposes the devil see that tells us what He is amen and and God and so many times here the the prophet ministered and is saying you may not be a preacher and you may not be a minister or you may you may not do these things but he said the holy spirit is calling every one of us into our ministry amen and the greatest the greatest mistake and the greatest fear that we do in the church is we don't support one another like we should and their battle we look at a brother or sister going through a battle and we have all the advice in the world to help them fight their battle when all we need to do is support them to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling amen it don't matter if it was a deacon in the church or a mother raising her children for the glory of God raise up the child and the way you'll go and he won't depart from it amen it's not a fast food restaurant where you drive through and the Victory is won like that but it's a battle in the ministry of the word amen and participation is what helps you know the prophet said he had a had a sister come to him and he said oh he said that was such a terrible Serv Serv she said I couldn't understand a thing you were saying by all the hollering and screaming and amen and Hallelujah and the prophet came back to her and he said sister I couldn't even preach and I'd be scared to death if there wasn't holler in a screaming and saying hallelujah am man there's lots of places literally dozens and dozens of places where the Prophet said he said there would be a gift but he said it's you people that operate the gift he said I know No Control in the gift but it's so for your gift too you can see a sister gifted with hospitality and you'd only be a you'd only be a miserable uh person to go there and insult everything she was doing to to to give you kindness and hospitality and honor your presence in her midst amen you'd say oh the potatoes are burnt and the steaks dry and and she gave her heart to give you her best her best amen God help us you know we see a song leader behind the pulpit or or whoever would be you know you could see your pastor or Minister and he would come up behind the pulpit and he's stuttering and spitting and and like maybe like Dwight Moody he say why would you ever come and hear him you don't you don't realize that behind the scenes there's a battle going on and the prophet say I catch that and I caught that and I can feel that it might and I and I don't feel that here it's not the people in our midst but the prophet was preaching to the tapes and the spirits and online and we're online amen and you KN you would know that Satan was botl anything for the kingdom of God like just like it would be for a mother trying to raise her family and the and Satan's Eden and everything's turned against her you could give her all the advice in in the world but what about just cheering her on that's what about just praying for her just saying sister you're doing a fantastic job in a few months it'll be a lot easier amen amen you see a song leader that misses a tune or a piano player not and we get oh why do we get a better musician why did you just cop or show your hands or wave or smile or amen hallelujah God help us and and and that's not the case here this is not for us but you know we're going into meetings and there will be different people here this weekend and there'll be different Spirits here and there'll be different leaderships here you know you know you know the prophet said this he said God made man and made man man made slaves I want to tell you something this morning and it could shock you you're not my slave if you are run for your life but I want to tell you something most of the Bride don't know that we worship man so much we worship our pastors and we worship the prophet and we worship this and we worship that and we should respect each other but not worship you're no nobody slaves this morning if you are you're Christ slaves man he's the only one that's worthy he's the one you know you know brother Braham said Christianity was living for others and he said we have an example of that Christ he left the Splendor of Heaven he left the cush's can you IM you can't imagine I can't we try there's there's no way that your three- pound feeble brain if you die in University you'll never comprehend that amazing love and he loved you so much that he would leave the safety and the godhead oh my where could we go with that but we're part of him and so when you see a brother or a sister in whatever gift they have strugg you say oh that was the best I never had better food I never seen the Church cleaner I never heard a better song later amen amen and you with with with with that you just the devil just flees away amen hallelujah God help us God help us in these things you know we've been doing the sound and and and you know to to to to show the truth you know our Prophet said truthful things but our Prophet wasn't negative we never want to be in the negative realm but he said hard things that were truthful amen I mean they were only hard if you struggled with the truth amen God help us to be men and women and and and you know what I saying is God's given you each one a gift and there's some people that don't know this but you don't need permission from nobody because for the foundation of the world God give you that gift and you don't need permission from anybody to operate that gift [Music] hallelujah amen I've called to I have Minister preacher and they say well I'm going to ask permission of my pastor permission oh yeah got one question for them did your pastor call you and if he did I don't want you to come and minister no thanks just stay right where you are I'm scared to death of that amen now I I don't mean respectful I'm talking about people that amen that that that are their sister churches people you know it's slavery it's worship of a man amen you know we were doing the sound this week and Vicki was here and and I tell you I'm completely illiterate and where computers are concerned but it it it's a major ordeal to put everything over and I messaged one of our sister churches in the area and I I don't say this to be negative but it's just factual I'm trying to show you something and and you there'll be there'll be things like I said this weekend come in and I messaged a person and I said I know you have a great sound person that's good at live streaming and I said I I I give him my number I said I'd like to them to come and help us hook up our we put up a people's mic so your worship during the service can go through the video amen and she said well I send it through to him and he's going to get back to you after he asked this pastor I thought after he asked this pastor to help a sister Church do live stream video for the glory of God go I was just like my I would never want to go to that church amen we need to we need to recognize Satan and watch how and but you know God's God's called us to to you know the prophet said this he said every time Israel went into battle you know what they sent out first the musicians and it was to raise the praise and worship of the people and and and to to change the whole trend of the people it was like go on to battle those soldiers didn't even realize it don't matter if you were a minister song leader or mother or the gifts of helps or Hospitality it was like go in and and take your Mountain amen but so many times we we we we see our we see the soldiers fall on the Wayside because they've had no SS of encouragement from the very people that were on the same team you know if we were playing a team a game we're not all going to fight for the ball we're on this same team we get the same Glory when we get there amen it don't matter who scores it was our team that won the bride Hallelujah am man I don't have to beat up a brother or sister to take their Glory from their gift but we're seeing it happen all the time they saidwell if it ain't my name on the brochure if if I'm not paid or if it ain't my Ministry or or this is the this is the most govern if it's not my home Church bless God it's a spirit that we deal with in Leo deia but our Prophet said that the Le to see and age stopped and the end of Pentecost the church age they don't have no business here in the bride age amen we moved way on be side it stopped in the end of the denominational Church ages the end of the church age brother Brown said the the leine church age ended at the end of Pentecost wow so what's it doing here he said people's rights it's all about me it's all about me if if my name ain't on if I don't have my picture amen you know sis Sister Abigail did our poster and it's beautiful and but you know and this is just me I I I don't mean this is sin but I want to show you Spirits Spirits there you know Satan he don't come in like a roaring lion he comes in dressed like a preacher he's got the nicest suit on this morning amen God help us amen I told Sister Abigail I said don't put the host pastor's picture on so what's it you ever see churches advertise for their special meeting the host pastor's picture is bigger than the speaker's picture like as if the people in the church don't know his picture I mean you already know I'm ugly and I got to put the picture on the poster to remind you of that I mean you ain't never seen brother Bartley before and he just comes in really small and then that seed grows he grows and it's then it's got I got to ask my pastor if I can buy a car I got to ask my pastor if I can buy groceries amen I got to ask my pastor if I can go to another church and help them do their live streaming services before their special meetings by the way I haven't heard back from not that I care amen I it's not what Christ did that wasn't how the prophet preached living for others to lift somebody else up no matter what behind the scenes he said he said quotes like this in the greatest battle ever fought he said do you know the secret was the sisters he said we had meetings where there was two sisters for the whole week they fasted and prayed the whole week nobody ever seen their picture on the poster and he said 100% of the benefit of that meeting was the gift of those two sisters and their gift of Prayer Warriors Prayer Warriors and our Prophet recognized them publicly amen amen you know it's like the prophet preached about if you stick your hand in the pale of water and you pull it out that's how big your picture will be when you pull your hand out of the pale of water you know he he he he ministered everything in in in the ministry about if you could make make yourself small small small small small small small and God can make somebody the whole bride large amen we're not if we are we're wrong we're not building individual kingdoms it's all the kingdom of Christ it's all for the glory of God it's nothing to do individually we're a family we're get the family inheritance oh God help us God help us to recognize these things and and and and expose the devil amen we can't live it for somebody else but don't put yourself in bondage that's amen man you have a Ministry the greatest gift you could to win souls witness the prophet talked about the Holy Spirit moving through the people and he said the holy spirit's pulling on to you and he said you may not minister or be a missionary but you'll have a testimony amen can you imagine watch this we're not far from can you imagine get to the spot that you got to ask permission to give a testimony come on you got to ask anybody permission to worship Goden you know what that is that's the chain yes of religion domination it's ownership it's flesh ownership it's dict leadership is evil from the pit of Hell amen God help us God help us let me read a quote in 63 he said and we have seen his star and come to worship Him and this is a longest quote I'll read this morning but I I'd like to just lay a foundation he's talking here about Joseph and Joseph had realized that Mary was pregnant and he wanted to put her away and there was no prophets in the land at that time amen and here's where he gets in he said now there wasn't a prophet in the earth in those days and he said one who could come to Joseph and give him thus sayith the Lord and so the Lord took a secondary way a secondary way see that's secondary way could be your gift watch this he said took a secondary way and that's the reason that God took the welfare of his own son to the man Joseph in a dream and he said if you'll yield yourself to God just drop to the next paragraph then he he was just he said if you'll just yield yourself to God God has many ways uhoh Oh I thought it was just the ministering of the word bless God oh that's that's a major way but God has many ways that he calls and reveals himself to you see see many gifts many ways many gifts it might be in a in a fantastic meal of hospitality and and you'll be just blown away by kindness I'm serious and God will reveal a mystery to you and say this is Supernatural in a world of people's rights amen he said it might not might not you might not be a prophet and you might not be a teacher and you might not be a Sunday school teacher and you might not be a preacher but there's a way there's ways that God will reveal himself to you see whether it might be in dreams and it might be in some other way if you'll just submit yourself like Joseph like Joseph Hallelujah he let him get to sleep he let Joseph get to sleep and he sent the angel of the Lord to him in a dream and the angel of the Lord came to him Amen to Joseph amen and and of course revealed the mystery of Mary amen we we want to be careful that we don't step in the way of what God predestinated gave in gifts in the body in the body and we focus too much on on Hollywood popularity on whoever's on the screen amen but it's a body it's families that make up the family of God it's husbands and wives and homes and children amen God help us here let's just go and to 2 Chronicles 20 and I'm just going to go through this scripture here here Jehosaphat had became king and he was a Godly Man and and had done great things took down Idols in the country and and this you'll find in chapter 19 before this chapter and here in chapter 20 you know the beginning of the verse many three or four countries raised up against josaphat in battle and this was an amazing thing to me he said you know people are good at giving bearers of bad news but they're not so good at Living Good Tidings and so everybody came to josaphat and told him he said oh he said there's like there all oh if you've never experienced that try to do something for God and everybody will come to they go so they're not encouraging you in your battle of your gift they're trying to discourage you uhuh you don't think that's happened happens all the times happens multiple times amen and they told J Jehoshaphat you know how many there was and how close it was and in verse three it says Jehoshaphat feared and himself of course he feared because all he had heard so far was bad news amen and he set himself to the Lord and proclaimed proclaimed a fast through all Judea and here Judea gathered themselves together and and now watch I want to show you in verse four he said Judea gathered themselves together and they asked the help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judea oh they were pulling up reinforcements now I I wonder when they pulled up those cities if they had to ask permission like they were calling on the Lord and then you'll see here that they they came forth and seek the Lord and they prayed and and they were you know in verse 5-13 he said here here jehoshaphat's praying and the people are praying and they're reminding god of what he's done now they didn't really need to but they're reminded God of how he's been with them and brought them out and how he's gave them the land and all the promises he's done and now he's reminded he said but now God whoa we're we're here to do our gift and Minister all that you've given to us and we got this fierce battle Hallelujah they reminded God of all he'd done in the past and they asked God how in the world are you going to get us through this one now I want to tell you something this may surprise you but God never spoke through a minister God never spoke through a prophet and it may surprise you but if you look in verse 14 the holy of the spirit the Holy Spirit spoke you hanging on through the congregation oh somebody spoke out during church somebody spoke out during church and this is what they said in verse 15 he said hearken ye oh Judea inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King of Jehoshaphat now why wouldn't the god went to the king I mean many times you could have and I'm not I'm I'm not preaching against Ministry I'm one of them I'm trying to show you I'm trying to make the play we're brothers and sisters we all have gifts the gift of ministry is without repentance it's no different than the gift of Sunday school teaching or Hospitality or the gifts of help if you change a spare tire on a sister's car that's a widow amen how do you rate the gift of God Amen Hallelujah he said thus sayith the Lord now watch this this came through the midst it said in verse 14 that the spirit of the Lord came in the midst of the congregation now I meant that everybody was in unity it wasn't an individual War fair or win if they were in this together they were either all going to win or all going to die amen I'm trying to show you something amen when we become to a mature level we'll we'll have each other's back you start talking to me about a brother or sister in this church and my ears are plugged I don't want to hear it it's garbage I'm not a garbage can I don't sit out on Thursday for the garbage man to pick me up [Music] hallelujah amen God help us Be not Afraid or be dismayed in verse 15 by reason of the great multitude for the battle is not yours it's not yours but God I'm in it but it's still not yours but God I feel like I feel frightened but it's still not yours but God I'm overwhelmed it's still not yours but God I can't do nothing on my own it's still not yours when you're weak he is made strong in my weakness many many Sunday mornings I'll wake up early some oh God I can't do this I I got what what could I give you I could give you nothing I couldn't give you done I just I just Sunday morning I'll just I I'll try to and I'm not puffing my I'm trying to show you I me mature stuff I just try to get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller but the spirit of religion is get bigger uh God help us God help us see when you you this affects me you know with the the poor countries and and other things it's affected me because Christ came to us no good people he left the Splendor of Heaven to come to the Earth and die as is a is a as a criminal a butcher L literally butchered him and we see the bride wife and I I I I think about stuff like I I know I know I know there's a I know there's a lot of stuff in this but you know you see churches where you know like we we're very comfortable and I have a pastor right now begging me to come to India he's probably sent me 1,000 pictures yeah Church in the tree sitting on the mud they pass out food so they don't starve to death after church some Churches got to have gold Steeples and brass door knobs and ceramic child floors and other ones don't even and and them aren't all evil but our Prophet said some things about them he said God never give us commission to build hospitals or churches or I mean it's it's fine to put a new sidewalk in we'd get muddy feet and place would be a mess but but he said Minister your gift Minister your gift preach the gospel preach the gospel be a minister of your gift to the bride of Christ I wonder if we're fulfilling that like we should I'm gonna shock you to death that Pastor in India I don't even know if he has a revelation of this beautiful message if God told me to I'd go to him and the partly literally thousands of people every time we get built up in ourself God can never touch you you think you got a great ministry be prepared it's going to collapse you think you're great somebody buy a casket because amen because God you'll be like a dad bed to God Amen it's it's time in the body that we puff each other up in Christ in Christ you're doing a great job you're doing an amazing job the food is unbelievable I can't believe that you're so kind because every one of us with this truth are in an unbelievable battle amen it's a battle for your eternal life and what would be wrong with with a brother or sister cheering y on see the natural types of spiritual in Israel every time they went into battle every time they used the Arc of the Covenant and the holy of holies was going into there the praisers and the worshippers went first so let's just look at how God thinks about cheerleading on Christ anointed wife let's just look at that amen when we look here in our scriptures here in 16 and 17 God tells them what to do and where the battle will be and then in 18 and 19 Jehoshaphat and all Judea and all of Jerusalem worship and praise God hallelujah and they obeyed the Commandments of verse 16 and 17 where God told them just just you know like he said ad ministering the word he said amen I'm not there yet he said don't check your bank account uhoh uh and don't check your clothes robe and don't see how many shoes you got no that's Bible but that's Insanity it is but it's still Bible because see if we have the faith that we're supposed to have we'll know that God's in control of everything and God will provide where where it's just just it's impossible possible to provide but see it's not impossible for Jehovah amen and here's what Jehoshaphat was up against and here when we look into how they here in verse 21 uh in verse 21 of this chapter here he said here they go and they're obeying the Commandments of what God told them to do and and Jehoshaphat counsel the people in verse 21 and he said when he had counseled the people he appointed the singers of the Lord now those singers were encouragers of the battle that wasn't even theirs who amen and he appointed the singers of the Lord that they should praise in the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and said praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever now now this battle wasn't even theirs and and I want to show you something most of the time when Israel sent the musicians out it was they were phys God was physically using them in the Battle of War but in this case but in this very case they never did that at all then God never God never even worked through through human flesh in this case not not not in battle not in battle only in music only in encouragement oh God bless you God bless you in your gift God bless you as your servant God God bless you as you're growing verse 20 verse 22 he said and when they began to sing and praise the Lord said and embarassments against the children of the amorites and the moabs and and ambushments against the people that came which came against Judah and because of encouragements and because of worship because of encouraging somebody else in their gift God Smite them all smot them all amen you know when you see a minister you know maybe maybe Pastor barley he's preached for a hundred years and it won't be the case but but you know you see somebody and and you just feel like you'd have to be a minister to understand what he's going through and that's it's not the time for you to be quiet and say oh I'm also I S the time it never was the time in the battle when there was a battle going on noise was what fought the Battle noise and worship and encouragement look look at even our prophet in studying this week you know said look at David we mentioned that Wednesday night he said I I tell you David was anointed of God before he was anointed amen you don't think so when he went to David's diad and he brought all the popular Preachers by they did that's how the Bible said it and they couldn't believe it wasn't the first son and and and and God had to rebuke his own prophet and he said you're looking at the Statue of the man but I'm looking at the heart I'm not looking at his bodily features and so you say well how did you know David was anointed over because God said he was looking at his heart God had already Chosen and many of us this morning we are in the the phase of David a perfect time type of David where David then when he got anointed everybody recognized oh he's gifted he was already gifted he was already gifted but here now David's gifted and he don't have a kingdom he don't have a throne he don't have an army he don't even have Israelites that like him you know that you know that David when he was when he was running for his life and the and the the uh the people had conquered the well at Bethlehem the palestin the I can't think of their name had conquered the well and and watch how David was David's just David's just very casual thought wow I'd like the church David just casually mentioned I'd like David's heart yearned for the time when he was a little boy and we down to the well in Bethlehem and and he drunk of that water that Abraham water that fleshly water he just yed for the time when he was at peace but he was in a bottle and his own people didn't support him you know if you read the B the scriptures in the Bible all the PE all the people that supported David when he had 30 men and three went down and fought in the well none of them were Israelites none of them none not one Hallelujah and watch how David's Fest desire was like their command amen look at it like this I'd like to get together for Fellowship I'll be there I'd like to David just casually think and because those people had no take for their own personal welfare but everything was regarded to the kingdom sound for me the kingdom of God your desires our Command amen watch this in David we we went back to this here David was anointed he never had a he never had a throne he never had an army he never had a kingdom he never had all these things but he was still God and I know a bride wife that's sitting here and you might be in the smallest Church in Canada and you might be in the ugliest Church in Canada but there's going to be a day when the Great Rapture is going to take place and you'll be sitting on the king of kings and Lord of lords beside the throne and judge the world Amen amen it'll be because of predestination and amazing love amen see how the people supported one another they never went let me see that won't work for me you see when somebody's in a battle and they reach out for help brother man and and the person you reaching up for help for they look and they go that won't work can you imagine the battle that just increased for that person but when can you you imagine the same person would reach out and say yes brother I'll be there I'll pray for you I'll I'll be yes I can help you and they're just like amen what are families for brother Brown said he said we would fight together in the backyard and he said because I was the oldest I would decipher you know kind of hey hey that's that's aning but when we stepped out in the front yard and all hell came against us hello hello we were shoulder toosh shoulder amen hallelujah amen we need one another I love you I need you I'm nothing it's not about me it's about Christ we need each other we we we you know when the more of a pressure comes in God God forbid it would happen that we'll go home sooner than that we we we need fellowship and kindness and and amen you know brotherly kindness is right under the cstone amen amen that's supportive that's supportive in your struggle and it don't matter if you made a mistake oh bless God they shouldn't have bought that that's why they're having Financial who cares I wasn't asking for a dialogue of counsel I was just looking for cheers of Victory as you go into battle amen amen God help us you know the story they were all smitten Jehoshaphat and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem none of them none of them none of them that's not very many none of them came into battle because they encouraged each other by worship and their gift amen God help us he said he said here in having a lot law of the Shadow he said many of you know the order of the battle they would always send the musicians out first and then it was a battle that was coming amen we're all we're all in a battle we're living in an age of we we want to get in a shell and be off to ourself and we don't want to talk to anybody don't I don't want to hear anything I'm I'm barely surviving on my own amen but God never made us like that he never made us like that what you know what's it say confess your faults one to another now that that's the that's the oh it's all right sister I I I had that that you know I just man it's not a competition it's not a competition amen if if if man what's the Bible it say it says the least will be the greatest the last will be first the first will be last we don't see that amen Prophet Pro talked about we we you know and these are so true but you know in the in the scheme when we mentioned the prophet we missed the theme he didn't he didn't he said I can't even pray for somebody unless I put myself and there's you and we just so we so fastly in a religious way just SPO off some prayer like oh God God help them take care of that situation I can't understand it Mike but did you try to live with them for a day amen cuz CU in living with them for a day was their battle amen oh God help us and we see here so many times look at look at here when when a uh Joshua took on Jericho and they took on the world city of Jericho and God delivered them you know it was just it was just a uniform battle you know I just I just see God help us but you know we we got to get unified it we got to get we got to come together and and it's not about my opinion or your opinion and I don't have a thought coming and I don't understand half as much as I wished I did I pray for God to open my eyes more and more amen but you see when when these great battles that we read in the Bible took place and the great victories that happened it was because the people worked together and they were unified and they weren't a amen when when J when they came here against Jericho and they marched around you know everything about that was ridiculous they marched around Jericho for six days one time and all they did is blow trumpets just just put that spiritually they'd be like me coming to your house for six days just saying oh everything you're doing is wonderful that's what I me they were they were encouraging each other in fellowship and worship and and then on the last day they went around seven times and they had a wild Revival and the blew Trum and God delivered them amazingly amen unified and all those people gifts guess what bless God of I can't play the guitar nobody's playing the guitar why I hate the drums well if I can't have a harp in my church and I don't want no string instruments amen help us Jesus you know our Prophet said when studying talking about David and looking into David so much he said David this was before the Holy Ghost was given David chased away demons playing a string instrument and you know how the prophet finished that quote he said God have mercy on you people that don't believe in string instruments no Holy Ghost given yet played the string instrument W see the gift amen and we see this amazing story about the seven priests that beared the ark and the trumpets of the Rams went forth this is in Joshua six talks about where they took Jericho and on the seventh day they compressed the city seven times and the priests blew the trumpets and it shall come to pass it when they make the long blast of the Ram's horns when you hear the sound of the trumpets that now maybe we pull this up Joshua 65 I want to oh oh we can't pull that okay we got a we got a roadblock here well that's all right Satan you're still going to lose because God help you next weekend amen but Joshua 65 he he said you know and it shall come to pass when they press that when they make the long blast of the ram horns now it was the priest that blew on the ram Thorns that when you hear the sound of the trumpet that just the ministers Oh no just the adults Oh no just the men oh no oh was it all the people including the kids all the people shouted with the loud Shout I'll tell you something right now if that wouldn't happened those walls would have never moved would have never they would have never moved you're wondering why walls aren't moving you wonder why walls aren't moving because you're not obeying the prophecy uhuh this was this was an order of of all participation amen hallelujah and the walls of the city s fell flat and the people ascended up straight there now those walls that fell flat now when the Bible says they fell flat I believe they fell flat but they were big enough to ride chariots on top I think there would have been a little for the matter would have no no it said flat flat amen God help us amen we we try to analyze everything I want to close with this last story that girl Amy can you turn the fans on I'm dying up here up here uh and it must be a hundred we're not in Uganda um here in Second Kings 5 and I want to close with this story and maybe finish with some quotes here we had nahem was the captain of the host of the king of Syria and if you drop down on that first verse it said that he was a mighty man of value but he had leprosy actually let me read that but he was a mighty man in the middle there it says but because of him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria so God had actually worked in his life amen but nahem had two battles he had two battles one battle was he had leprosy and the Second Battle was he was proud and I want to show you in this scripture that nahem never conquered that alone they never conquered none of the battles alone you see God has a plan God didn't leave us alone that's why he said we should not forsake the assembly the C together bring your licks of fire together and and and and and see we we we feed off of each other amen we we rub the shoulders with our Believers the like price is Fai amen how can two walk together unless they agree but we agree amen and here we see in nem's life that he had leprosy and he was hiding it like most people hide their sins because of the de City would have realized that he would have lost his position and lost his place but there was a little slave girl and I want to ask you something what was the benefit for that little slave girl to help n him absolutely nothing did she get more pay after did she get a better bed or bedroom or a plusher job or did she get her picture on the poster she saved nem's life life just like you'll Save a believer's Life by witnessing sharing the gospel and say this is what God did for me this is what God's doing in our time amen I don't mean you'll throw your pearls before the swine god'll tell you when you don't have to ask your pastor you got the Holy Ghost you'll just feel that little ticker go you'll see the door crack open a little a spat and you'll uhhuh amen and she said but there's the prophet and if you get to his word you'll be saved see how this battle wasn't hers and chances are if nem would have died she would have been closer to being free than if he lived see she was a slave huh see how she had the same characteristics of Christ when he left Glory To Die for a sinner like brother Dale living for others at all costs living forever the prophet said multiple multiple multiple times I couldn't read all the quotes where he said Christianity was living for others amen just it can be just in a little kindness and then we see you know the reaction to nahem to the prophet and the prophet uh sent his servant and nahem didn't like the word that God give to him and we've all seen that and people in our midst where the word will come forth and you'll know you'll know you you experienced it I'm sure in your life where somebody's struggling with the true word of God that's getting Clos am how do we help them do we avoid them that's that's how we help them do we side with them say oh I understand your position this is no how did here the servants help nak him they said you know th this is it's not really that big a deal you know you've built this battle in your mind but you know I I know it's but like it's it's just like you're going to die if you don't obey the message of the hour you're never going in the Rapture but like if you just you know like I I mean you might like the tribulation but like I think it be all right if you just went down seven times just just kind of like they were just kind of like putting butter on the wheel just saying you know maybe you should reconsider your actions like it's possible really that you'll be completely clean you see that see that but not us not us typical Message Church you know oh bless God I know they're in a trial but like amen I I don't say that to be you know but and that's not the case here it's this is not for us this is only because you you'll see at other places I really do I I'm I'm saying that dra I don't feel that from one single one of you here not one not not even not even a spe praise God Amen look at the the beauty of the church it's the character of the people and oh wow you amen that's that's amazing but see how we could guide people in they never these people never went back said well I wonder if we could go talk to the prophet and change the word change the prophecy or you know what I mean they they what was already laid down they just tried to encourage them in their battle you know what me I've seen it before let me give you an example I you some of you are looking at me like I'm a ghost or something I've seen it before when I was leading songs when I was young and maybe I just was I I'll say I was just right off the musician was perfect and I was like in another place and you know you'd see half the people they and the other people that really helps you fight the battle see what I'm talking about if you have any experiences sometime you should come up and Lead song sometime but what be wrong with just like doing anything just make noise I can't fix the problem I can't sing but I can stand up and smile or slap my hands I you know that and this is definitely not n of my notes do you know that it's scientifically proven the Clapping Your Hands I I even foret I read it so long ago I forget it Clapping Your Hands stimul your nervous system and rebuilds like it's it's one of the healthiest things you can do it's cling your hands it's just particip just and and and maybe the person really is doing a terrible job but but going along with it ain't going to help it I'd raise oh you know we've all heard this with me and the well me I said you know we see people before we had kids you know because we didn't have kids for a few years and we said oh I'd never do that bless God I I'll do m oh oh bless God that came back H I had somebody tell us that we probably said that about your kids they said when you have kids you have a new boss in the house it's a kid that's born well you know it's a growing process amen sometimes we just think people are all going to be the best at what they do it's a growing process we can we can we can we can support one another and and grow and in our ministry and we're actually going to come to the stue of perfect man we're going to be ready for adoption because God will actually see the character and he'll give you the pen and say you can sign the checks now because he can see the maturity and amen and it won't be I got to ask my pastor amen I I don't say that out disrespect but that flourish me the pro our Prophet said our Prophet said that ministers were born and and you know and our Prophet clearly taught that we didn't believe in a bishop over a bishop yeah but I'll ask my pastor that sure sounds like a Bishop over a bishop to me I mean I just can't see it any other way if God leads me to go to India or China or hope not TR but you know somewhere like that and I said well I gotta well who's the boss the god that asked you amen I know that's kindergarten to us because we see it but people don't see it I'm telling you they don't see it actually the majority of this world don't see it you you you people have come from churches that don't see it this is not a this is not a dictatorship this is not a religion this is not a a church click I don't that's garbage I mean this is a family do you ever see a click in a family hallel that's unbelievable no matter how big the family is they're not a family clicking the immediate family we don't have grandkids in this family they're all born of the Son of God Amen oh God help us God help us amen God help us to recognize that we're all in a battle until we go home we're in a battle and we need to support one another that don't mean you'll have all the answers you know look at the prophet's wife she came and said Billy I don't understand this and I he said you don't have to understand that he said but I don't know like people can't I it's just hilarious to me people come to Prophet say but you don't know your Bible because you know I I'm I'm educated and I know all these verses he said you're right I don't know my Bible but I sure know the person that wrote the Bible amen I don't know my Bible either but I sure talk to the person that wrote it I mean I'm in communication daily amen God help us God help us not to build a kingdom of a man

another amen and recognize that all all every person in the body has the value of eternal life 10,000 worlds he said the prophet said if the Bible if the the least of these would pray for you the very least amen the very least you got a problem this morning have the little children pray for you you want to see a miracle I've seen that in my life amen when we had our shed fire it was it was I think it was a uh Jared's little boy was in the van praying like the shed should have burned down wasn't some big Pope preaching it was a little boy praying with sister amen we don't see these things because we're humans we don't recognize them and we we we we we rate everything by Statue we got to get rid of that devil get rid of that devil don't look at me don't don't look I was showing Junior I mean God bless our prophet he was like I mean he was amazing he was more amazing than anybody on this Earth knows knows God used them for a tool and he said dozens and dozens and dozens of times don't never look at me I'm loaded with mistakes now you talk about coming humble you talk about coming humble when God trusted him and used him mightily like never before in history of the world but he had the ability of making himself small and God had the ability of raising them up amen you want to be raised up this morning in Christ you make somebody else a preference you make somebody else a small person you lift somebody else up and as you do it on to the least of one of the little ones you've done her Ona me amen amazing let's stand amen God help us you know I punched in in my search as I studied this and I've had this in my books for weeks punched in word and battle and I'll tell you what there was more quotes that come up than you could read Word Battle Word Battle it wasn't a direct it wasn't always together but just in the same paragraph the word word and the battle amen and we know that our Prophet taught us that every gun is turned on his wife and we need to come together and support the real the the real bride you'll be able to tell you won't have to ask your pastor because the holy there's a union you know I won't need a picture of Pastor Bartley when I pick him up at

that part of the the the the the the the tapes not just amazing he he say just one moment ago you ask God that that that I I I know I mentioned that before that just blows my way to think that that I had a thought and I think you know and it went all through all the politics in heaven got right to the top and he sent it back and brother Bram had to process it in his head and speak it and it took five seconds and you don't think God can take care of your battle oh my my amen you could just we could go forever on this look at Paul and Silas in jail how did they break out of the locks and the stocks in the inner of the jail worship worship praising God I mean just go on and on and on look Peter when he was in jail and they prayed for Peter Peter come out and they thought he was a ghost and they said well we prayed but we don't believe God would ever answer our prayer you know like you serve such an amazing God that even in your unbelief God still answered the prayer that's unbelievable but it's true and God gives you these beautiful examples and we just oh well that's a nice story no that's that actually happened they actually prayed they had no belief that God would answer the prayer and they confessed that he was a ghost at the door and the people when they come back the girl come back and said there's no way that happened Peter's in Joe but your Jehovah your Jehovah could pass over your even unbelief and operate the gift of the holy spirit that was planted there before the foundation of the world and raise up your little faith like the prophet would have the girl with the shoes and the crutches and he'd say sit over there and he she was as she watched her face brew and she say hey let's put those shoes on amen God help us God help us to to to to to live for others and I don't mean and when I say live for others that don't that don't mean hurt yourself there's things that you can live for others that will edify yourself live for others just a little thing that
