Leo and Uganda and Pastor Nelson in El Salvador ones that we have talked to this week amen and bring greetings just uh God is good also just to bring up to your memory uh we have sent a church text out for uh junior it's generator and just we're going to be by so if God has laid it on your heart to to do something for brother Junior and his household the generator amen would be a blessing for them and God will certainly bless you for sure he will bless you because his word says that but he'll also bless you if if he laid it on your heart yes am amen God is very good amen it's just H we love you all we just uh I was going to sing a song I was thinking we maybe he'll sing it when when we close we had a just a amazing service Wednesday night one of the best Services we've had in this church since it's been here it's just it was Supernatural from the first song we have come into your house to magnify your name and worship you and literally the power of God just fell like that it's beautiful you know just praise God that I could be a part of it amen amen let's just take our Bibles and and look into God's word and you know the prophet said this we're going to turn to Mark 12:24 uh said you know if you can't believe uh the the person preaching in this case maybe your pastor or the minister if you can't believe that I'm God's servant or you can't believe that I'm ministering God's word then there's no way that I could do anything for you God can only do something for you through the fivefold ministry if you believe in them that's why the scriptures say and this is clearly a positive thing and clearly your choice to know them the labor among you cuz we know that there's more wolves than there are sheep and uh that's because Satan knows his time is near the end and uh so I just say that to lay a foundation amen if if you know the brother Braham said this in a quote and I might not get to it he said you know God never sent us to show the word god showed us in Mark he said go into all the world and preach he never said teach the word he said preach it was under the inspiration of the word Paul said I don't come to you with flowering speech and fancy words and all this but in power and demonstration of Jehovah which is still the word man we're not leaving preaches and leaves the word well he's just a he's just an antichrist but you know we can have the word word it just memorize the word but it's the anoint the letter kth but the spirit it's God's holy spirit it's not the spirit of a man it's God's holy spirit Hallelujah I want to I want to just uh let's read our scripture verely verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it die it bringeth much fruit fruit you may have your seats Lord Jesus we pray that you'll add the blessing to the word and Lord I pray that through my stumber lips and and and bad English that you'll you'll portray what you uh brought to me Lord Jesus and may they catch it in their heart the truth the true revelation of what you're bringing this morning in your name we pray amen you know the I'm going to say something extreme here do you know that there's you know we believe that the we if you're a Christian this morning you have eternal life that you came from God and so you have a seat of God we believe in predestination and the seed of God but I'm going to show you something this morning that is more important or equal to being predestinated or being a seat of God now those are huge words I almost had to check that myself no I did have to check that myself something that's more important than being a seat of God or predestinated or coming from God and I know you're going to shut down as soon as I say the word and I'm just sorry for you but I'm going to give you multiple examples where the Prophet said it was more important it was everything and we failed in this one-word category I failed and I believe we've all failed and that's atmosphere nothing can grow even though it came from Jehovah without atmosphere nothing can grow and God will hold us responsible brother mam said that for not creating the proper atmosphere and when somebody says they're going to hold me a responsible I check into that and say okay I don't like that feeling so do I want to go down this road or can I handle the responsibility amen like marriage or borrowing money or anything you're responsible so are you big enough to handle the responsibility he said you are creators and you create the environment around you and if you don't create an atmosphere for life to come forth God will judge you everything takes an atmosphere to grow takes an atmosphere to bake a cake it takes an atmosphere to bring life takes an atmosphere for everything is conditions you know I when we went to the one ministers meeting and the ministers I I uh really had their attention I said you know in the farming life especially in corn it's seed to soil conversion you know we've been preaching on conversion and seed to soil conversion I have the worst corn crop I've ever grew in my life this year and is because the ground was terribly prepared in the spring it was seed to soil conversion if you are very good atmosphere now listen I'm going to show you what the prophet said so you don't have to get nervous unless you don't believe the message of the Bible amen but the wrong kind of an atmosphere will either stagnate or actually kill and the reason that many young people have left the church that are predestinated and have not brother bam said you cannot have the baptism of the Holy Ghost without atmosphere you and I get it it's not possible so the seed of God have stood up and went out the doors because there was no atmosphere to bring forth life amen and he also said that you can bring forth life any way like even false life can bring an atmosphere he said a chicken egg can hatch in an incubator a puppy can bring forth a chicken egg you can put it in a blanket you can put it by the heater you can put a heat lamp over it that's why he said that you can get the Holy Ghost somewhere else than here he even named the churches because if they if you're the seat of God that's God's business but if the other people create the atmosphere and it'll bring forth life and you know I talked to many ministers around the world and that but let let's just let's just look at some things the prophet said before we say that you know so we know that life can come forth by many substitutes but we are responsible God's responsible for who's predestinated but you're responsible for the atmosphere that you created when they're in your environment amen now we know that the devil has put all the guns on the truth and we also know that the devil's in church this morning because the brother Bram said that the three kinds of Believers a make believer nonbeliever and just plain a false believer amen and so you know in a small church we don't like to think of that it's much easier to think of that three kinds of Believers in a big congregation because it's easier to hide but I I I'm I I I'm just this is coming back to me so I'm just going to share you know I've talked to PE preachers all over the world and and even before I say that if you're wondering why is brother Dale going down this road well number one God told me to and number two Jesus did Jesus did I'm going to show you in Mark 8 or John 8 sorry Jesus did and I I think he's a pretty good example and uh also I know that he showed me this I talk to ministers all over the world that have people come up and rehash the message after they preach brother Osman told me he said you know brother Dale he said every time I preach on morning he said there's two brothers go outside the church and repr preach my message all the things I have wrong hband Bley brother Leo and yuganda had a brother go around and tell all the people in the church why they didn't have to pay ties and offerings because that was Old Testament you know you don't have to do that stuff don't matter what your pastor says don't listen to him I know the truth cuz God revealed it to me too and I had ministers talk to multiple people like that and you know and I'm I said to say I I want to break this yoke this honest but every single church that I've attended in Ontario had that Spirit every single church I can tell you the places where the people come out and congregated and chewed up everything the pastor had said after he preached and I don't want to have to bring this up again but it ain't going to happen here it ain't going to happen on this property because see Jesus when it happened to Jesus he left cuz he didn't know the property but in this case I own the property so it'll either be stopped or you'll be asked to leave because there was people here repeatedly if my doctrine's wrong you have two options pray that God converts me or leave cuz I there's not one person sitting here this morning that I solicited to come here not one person if it if if the is it was my own kids is um is that the truth did I go to any of your houses and beg you to attend I know that's the truth let's look at what the Bible said he said they wrote the Bible in word form and Jesus called it a seed but a seed cannot bring forth unless in the right condition in the right environment so it don't even matter that we're predestinated when we don't have the right environment now though that's like that's like I had to you know I had these thoughts back when we had camp meeting you know I very very very seldom do I get a a message like the day before I'm preaching I've been feeding on this for months I'll start putting quotes and scripture in my phone and they'll be scattered I have to erase a 100 pictures before I can get back to the message that I had a thought of months ago that's just the way God leads here's another one he says what is it it's creating an atmosphere he says hallelujah he said Brothers he said if the atmosphere does it he said it's exactly right he said look at the hand hatches an egg he said it's not the hand egg it's the atmosphere he said you can put that egg under anything incubator I mean we already went there he said it's the atmosphere he said that's right the atmosphere is where the power of God moving in one Accord one place gathered together under one atmosphere expecting God to move with signs and wonders it's the atmosphere God can't do nothing without atmosphere absolutely nothing it don't matter you have the revealed word if you're a tiger that's got the revelation of the revealed word you're Satan's got that he knows this message in the Bible better than we do and trembles but he don't have the atmosphere he said the whole atmosphere here he said Lord create an atmosphere and my soul are one Accord he said our hearts are hungering to see an atmosphere the atmosphere is what brings it the atmosphere would bring it and if every person could get in one Perfect Harmony and be settled and get in the natural way because the atmosphere is what Hatches the Egg he says here he says you cannot get the filling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost cannot with atmosphere oh bless God I know the message I study it daily Don't Mean a Thing watch this back in our scripture in John 12:24 maybe you can pull this up and they came to they came and they wanted to see Jesus and he came to the disciples seeing him at night and and he was he was spineless because he didn't want the other Church religious people to see him and he so he came to Jesus late and this is how Jesus answered he said verily verily I say unto you that I'm the seed of God but unless I die I won't I will abide alone now this is God now if God had to have the atmosphere to rot here's Jesus himself I have to get in an atmosphere where my life becomes nothing nothing and if I don't get in that atmosphere I will be nothing is that what Jesus said it will bite alone now let me just say was Jesus from God did Jesus have the SE God Jesus was Jehovah but he had to come in an atmosphere it's an atmosphere that brings life Hallelujah we've built everything around the word here's here's I want to show you you're saying you watch this you're saying brother Dale you're putting too much into the scripture John 1224 I'm sure glad you asked me that our Prophet said this he said wonderful but Christ never told us to build some else like that he said preach the gospel and the gospel this he directly mentions this scripture and he said the gospel isn't word only it's through Power and Demon power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit and it would produce the sign of Mark 16 where he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs will follow them and the word itself the word itself is dead until it becomes an action that produces life that's why I could preach the message where you know brother bram's testimonies are fantastic and they're Vindicated and they're real and there's no doubt about it but you got to have your own testimonies Amen brother Dale has his own testimonies I can preach a whole sermon on my testimonies where fire don't burn where you can drive in a Ravine and you don't tip over and on and on and on and on and on and the devil will confess your testimony and then this is where he goes into the same quote this is in his India India uh trip report and he said except the corn of wheat falls into the ground it buys alone and when the words brought forth the heart of faith and it makes every promise in the Bible live again he said you got to live the it's the germanization of the word he said it self lives and receive received in the right place under the right conditions and every seed will bring life again and it's put there under the right condition atmosphere and Brethren I would say this with reverence and respect this is Brother Bram identifying our scripture that we read our text I would say this with reverence and respects Brethren as your brother knowing that maybe before tonight that I will stand in the Judgment seat of Christ in heaven and look and may say this that the atmosphere the atmosphere always brings forth the product and he goes into explaining the hand and the chicken and how all the eggs can a and then he said watch this he says I don't care whether you're a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian it's the atmosphere on the word he said if the word which is the a is in the right atmosphere and it's in a a presbyterian or whatever it is that produces the same results it's produces the born child again it's right Brethren whether you're Pentecostal or Full Gospel orever it's the atmosphere it's the atmosphere now you can have the atmosphere and if you don't have the truth it won't matter because there has to be a germ seed of life but we have lots of germ seed of life of young people that aren't in church this morning because the atmosphere has stunk really bad now if you've got to create an atmosphere your faith will do it and there in the upper room in one Accord in Heavenly places rushing Mighty Wind come in he said the atmosphere was right it takes the atmosphere to do anything yeah that's right he said you know the regular produce talking about chicken and egg again it say he said it's in the right atmosphere I'll hatch anyhow listen Brethren man that loves God and got the right kind of atmosphere he could get into it'll produce a newborn baby just as certain as I'm here this morning he said it's the atmosphere that counts let the little handful of people sitting here tonight and get into perfect atmosphere and watch what takes place it'll not be feval once Among Us or crippled or walk or death or dumb he said it's the atmosphere it's the atmosphere and we know what's happening in our midst because we have the truth and Satan knows it he knows he's only got to do one thing he can't take the truth from you cuz you already got that and you say well I didn't find well you had that before the foundation of the world you had the predestinated seat of God so Satan already started partially defeated but he only had to do one thing and he's done it really really really well but he's created an atmosphere you know why the brother Bram said he said it's not about the word he said it's it's not about my word and and this word and brother Brown said to it's the spirit that brings life it's the spirit that brings life you know there's everything in the Bible and in the message has two sides but it's when you bring them together in the right spirit amen amen we don't have a problem with being too noisy in church amen you noise won't scare me by the way it might help me to push me over I want to show some things and then I want to I want to just read a couple really short things and then I want to go into where I know you're questioning why I bring this up let say again Jesus dealt with this and a lot of people in the past that were definitely true of God which God will straighten out in the Judgment were Vindicated true men of God that affected my life were destroyed because they were too afraid to deal with the atmosphere but brother Dale ain't if you got a wrong spirit and atmosphere around you it might be all right if you're quiet but if you start making noise I'll throw you out of every hole of the wall it won't I won't even say I'm sorry or wave on the way out or nothing because Jesus did I I know I'm scaring you but Jesus did just just take my word for it Jesus did he said I don't believe in fuss and God sent us to pray me to pray for the sick preach the gospel thousand that would believe it why would I send time on one fanatic that don't believe it he said you know there's millions and millions and millions of people you here are guilty of it you're preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching over and over and over and over and over again you're like oh this brother Dale again and there's millions that never even heard the name of Jesus Christ one time not one time that's why a pastor has to go to the mission field get regener ised he said you're never in the wrong if you're preaching the gospel in the mission field never never that's a big word never said our greatest commission was to go into all the world not stay brother Brown said this I I didn't bring the quote up because I just had too much stop I mean unbelievable but he said he said I'm not called to just sit here and preach to you over and over and over and over over over again and you all fall asleep because there's other people that actually like to hear them preaching they just sitting there w he says I don't debate with anybody I don't believe in fussing with people the gospel wasn't made to fuss about he said I don't believe in fussing with people but when it comes to the spot that they're laying there they try to drag you into it I've listened to some of you try to to to tell me your Revelation that's off the word and you want me to agree or not and I'm just sitting there like oh I hope this day ends soon I don't want to be rude but like you're trying to drag me into your belief I had visiting ministers come here this year and saying I want I don't want to I don't want to talk to some people because I don't want to catch their Spirit brother Brown said he said I'd like to go to every one of your houses but he said I'm called to minister the word I have to get God's spirit can you imagine if I was preaching D spirit this morning place would clear right out we need God's spirit I don't want your spirit and you don't need to get mine brother Brown said I'm afraid I'm a fears that we're getting the pastor Spirit if he's a big fat guy and eats a lot then we all eat a lot if he's got a big belt buckle like this then we all get one the big Hut if you all four-wheel drive truck we all buy four-wheel drive trucks we ain't got the whole Holy Spirit we got the spirit of the pastor that's why people could have semis to truck around wooden briefcases of brother brandham because they were getting brother brandham Spirit they would make cardboard briefcases and truck them down with Van trucks across the states selling a a cardboard duplicate of the van brute kicks they were making millions and millions of dollars doing amen oh that was a really quiet one still the truth praise God wow wow I put one quote in there twice that's amazing God must have really wanted me to say that one John 8 John and John you know brother Osman Bartley when he was preaching our camp me he preached almost the whole services on John I think wow I'm going to have to go through and listen to that a whole bunch of times it was just incredible John has tremendous words in the Bible amen but you know here is Jesus and I I want uh John 8 yeah we start the whole scripture this whole chapter be great to study and I'm not going to read every verse but I always want to give you the scene where God dealt with a situation now here it says in 20 it says that these words Jesus spake in the he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour wasn't come so here's Jesus behind the pulpit preaching in the Tabernacle correct so we've laid the scenes but they had not been taught Church order and Doctrine yet amen and they had not learned that the the spirit only deals through one person at a time and so when Jesus is ministering right they said he was ministering in the temple correct that's that that is what 20 says okay that the people actually talk back to him so they were really out of order but let's go to verse 23 and let's show you how Jesus didn't Overlook their eror now you can read the whole chapter but I'm just going to things and Jesus said unto them ye are from beneath and I am from above and ye are this world and I am not of this world and I say therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for ye believe for if you believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins now you can only imagine the powerful words that they were saying to Jesus before I read that scripture now I showed you right there how Jesus dealt with them preaching back to him Jesus didn't like blow over it he gets called the outat verse 27 and understood not that he spake to them of the father they didn't understand Jesus revelation correct now in defense of the religious message Believers of that day Jesus was bringing a new message he has going from law to Grace and they love law because they liked working you know I'm just naturally like Grace because I like staying in the living room I just my kids say you're going to die in there it's all right with me I like Grace you want to work hard knock your boots off it's all out there you can do whatever you want that's how some of us are spiritually now let's just jump to verse 30 and as Jesus spake these words many many praise God hallelujah Church somebody help me preach somebody many said I believe yes well Hallelujah there was some Believers in the church and then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him ye continue in my words and ye are my disciples indeed now that's good preaching but we just Dro down to verse 37 and there's lots of goodies right in between there but I'm just trying to not Bor you with the word of God this is in the same setting the same same service the same Tabernacle and the same Minister I know that you are Abraham's seed this is Jesus talking unto the unbelievers but if ye seek to kill me because my words has no place in you they were sitting in exactly exactly the same Tabernacle at exactly the same message Jesus did didn't go he didn't just skip over and say well maybe if I avoid them they'll go away he just called them out you either line up believe shut up that's what Jesus did verse 38 and I speak th that I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen with your father father and they answered him and said unto him Abraham is our father bless God I was raising the mess I went to Bram Tabernacle Hallelujah and verse 40 but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God and this did not Abraham Abraham never tried to kill God here they were believing Abraham's message but the Believers coming up in Abraham's message wanted to actually kill the very God that Abraham had preached because they wanted to worship the Abraham being their father amen and ye do the Deeds of your father and then said they unto him we weren't born a sinner and fornication we have but one father even God's our father bless God Abraham was of God and so are we of God and Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceedeth forth and came from God neither I came onto my came I of myself but he sent me and why do you not understand just my simple speech it's just very simple speech I'm I'm trying to love you I'm trying to create an atmosphere I'm wooing you on to myself and you're just blight F and despitefully rude trying to abuse me he said even because you cannot hear my words verse 44 and ye are of your fathers the devil and the lust of your fathers you do and he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth now wait a minute but they were Abraham's sons they came out of the message Church of the day Father Abraham because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie and he speaketh his own for he was a liar he is a liar and the father of it talking about the devil and their daddy verse 45 let's watch how Jesus is dealing with unbelief in the Tabernacle just to bring it to remembrance we did say that he was preaching in the Tabernacle correct okay verse 45 and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which ye which of you convinced me of sin and if I say the truth then why do you not believe me he that is of God hears God's words and ye therefore Hearth them not because ye are not of God and verse 48 and then answered the Jews and said unto him say that we say we not well that thou art a Samaritan hast thou have a devil here's the devil saying that God has a devil sounds like a politician or somebody you know when they accuse somebody else of a problem that's in it's always in their own life they're accusing exact same problem you know verse 49 sorry I lost my place and Jesus answered and said I have not a devil watch this watch watch this very closely please if you just catch this part just hold your thing but I honor my father and you are dishonoring me now when brother Dale preaches from here and you come here by free choice and I preach on adoption which is in the Bible in the message brother Brown said this he said adoption is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said it's positionally placing you in the body of Christ that's a direct quote I have them memorized and you go outside this place and you say something opposite of what I just preached you're in danger of Dale when I preach that you're going to be married here I was just listening to God Christ being revealed in God I've listened to it for a week every night going to sleep I relisten to it and relisten to it and relisten to it and I have a p I actually had to get up last night cuz my pencil was gone from my nightstand and I look at it when I something jumps at me and brother Bram and I write down the time and then I go look it up and brother Braham was saying in Christ revealed in God it's a 63 old7 message somewhere in there and he was talking about he is the husband and we are the wife and we become impregnated with the Holy Spirit and when you become impregnated with the Holy Spirit even if you commit adultery you cannot take another seed now that's thus say the word of God and you go out in this property and you start contradicting that brother Dale don't do it I'll tell the deacons to do it and you will be no more because I didn't sacrifice my life savings buying this property every penny that I have on my line of credit is because I bought this church and I've tried to repair it for the glory of God to have the devil come in here and contradict what God's preaching you do dishonor me 53 verse 53 and then the Jews said unto him now we know that thou H has the devil because Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my Saints he'll never taste death and let's jump to 55 and finish this out here and he said yet ye have not known him it's talking about God but I know him and if I shall say that I know him not this is Jesus talking about Jehovah if I should say that I don't know God then it would make me a liar like you are but I know him and I keep his saying and your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad and then said the Jews unto him Thou Art not yet 50 years old and H has seen Abraham and Jesus said unto them verily verely I say unto you before Abraham was I am and they picked up stones and cast it onto him hid himself and when went out from the Tabernacle going through the midst of them and so passed by you say brother Dale why are you bringing up this defac of atmosphere when you're preaching on atmosphere because Jesus did and when we get it corrected the atmosphere will be proper you know God's not the author of confusion amen if I'm a liar don't come here that's very simple God's truth is a liar that put you in a really bad spot but Galatians 5:1 1923 just laying we're almost finished we're just laying a nice Foundation here we're going to ain't that beautiful how you know people don't deal with situations I had a brother tell me and you know he was talking he said well you know you will always have all the guns are all on us we know the guns are on us but all Satan's guns are on you but you have a Haven of Rest okay and that's called the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then you have an Earthly Haven and that is a place that you Abode in like your home and you don't need to let people in your home that don't agree with you that are fers or abusive or you're not going to marry somebody that's going to beat the snot out of you or all this stuff and likewise is it in the house of God Amen let's read this Colossians 5:19 and now the works of the flesh are manifested in which are these adultery fornication uncleanness and ex levious living adultery witchcraft hatred and all you can see all these things here envy and murders dark drunkenness these are all of the flesh you know I I me just pull off from the scripture you know I was looking up nickan spirit and praise God for Google cuz it gives you a lot of scriptures you know the nickan spirit was it went right back into and I didn't put the scripture down because it didn't really apply but the nicod of the spirit is when the the the the the minister is pushing on the Ley but it can be the other way you know the Bible says don't muzzle the ox the Trump Thro the corn but the nickan spirit was when Israel was Abode that the man SLA with the women and committed adultery and when the I believe it was Moses but whoever it was that was in charge then come up and all the people that had done that were killed and it was a nickola the spirit because they were because of sin they were trying to force the preachers not to preach against it bless God you got the wrong man behind the pulpit CU none of you hired me God hired me first amen God help us shows all envy and murder drunkenness R all these things you can see this that they which do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God not enviance hatred Strife if you Strife wrath you're not going to inherit the kingdom of God that's the Bible I know it's something that we don't read a lot anymore most people's home but most people's homes got like an inch of dust on them but maybe you read it on your phone like I do but it says if you're in Wrath and strife and all these things you're not inheriting the kingdom of God if you think you are you're deceived this is New Testament Bible I mean we don't need a message to know this I don't even need a prophet to identify this it's I just I just learned a little bit of English and failed grade one and couldn't spell nothing in grade two but I you know but watch this but 22 but the fruits of the spirit are left Joy even though I'm going through a trial I'm still happy praise God glory peace longsuffering even if I don't agree gentle goodness and Faith maintenance Temperance and against such watch what brother Brown says this I'm going to shock you with this one this is the greatest quote ever he says I would rather have the word wrong and have the right atmosphere woo but bless God I'll come and debate I'll show you my five quotes if you come and show me my five Quotes no that ain't what he said that ain't what he said he said and when it gets to a spot that you can have tender love to every human being something happened to you for God so loved you when you were a sinner and an alien away from God and an enemy and Commonwealth I'm sorry I couldn't put these up there I mean I could if I would have but uh Commonwealth of God and he loveth you that he gave your life for sure and I want to tell you something if anybody in my whole life ever has a question about anything just come to me and ask and just a normal kind of thing brother Dale is not a perfectionist and brother Dale has lots of airs lots and lots of airs I eat too much that's one really bad one but you see I mean there's nothing wrong there's a way to say Hey Brother Dale can I get together with you you know uh somewhere and and just you know or or just hand me a note you know a sest you put a suggestion in the offering box if you don't you don't put no money in there just put a suggestion in D I don't like you praise God I don't need your money anyway it's up to God if you give it to God because I just give it I just pass it on to God because you know pastors pay TI too holy ghost fil pastors pay TI see ministers aren't Above the Law watch this but if you get a spirit in you that you're better than somebody else I I hate respects the persons I just it vomits me I was like that in grade two I mean I I just don't I don't go there then you're worse than everybody else that I know of cuz I don't care if you are correct in your theology you need to catch this one this is in this is by the way at 61 this is a late quote quote brother Brown didn't say this before he got great Revelations like the seals bless God this is after the seals this is after the breach message when the fullness of the godhead bodily had come down and he said if I've ever preached an inspired message like these seals it was these messages he said if you're correct in your theology and your motives and objectives are wrong I'd rather be wrong in my theology than be wrong in my heart that's right the spirit of God dwells in your heart so any of those spirits that are of the Flesh and they come out you just need to pray like God help me die more I got to die some more oh I got to die see if you have a thought you know some of you weren't here on Wednesday night I shared something with the church but I came here on Monday with kind of a heavy heart and you know brother Dale has thoughts and you know expectations and I desire that people would be blessed and hear the word of God and and you know positive things and God showed me something I Comm in you still you need to die you thought the church would be full by now you need to die you thought people would like you that came to church you need to die see you can never say something to a dead man that hurts them you thought people would appreciate your ministry you need to die just die die die die die die don't matter what happens if there's only two here and I have to travel to heaven 500 to preach to I I I'll travel once a year die die if you're disappointed in the ministry that God's given you die if you're disappointed in God die so I came Monday the only thing that could come out of my mouth once I'll I'll normally pray for families and even sometimes walk around sit where you sit and pray for try to pray for every person in the church but it's like I some somebody comes up my mind and say oh die so oh this situation die oh what about this oh die what about oh die die what about die wow and then we came in on Wednesday night and from the very first ding of the piano god the Holy Spirit fell like an atomic bomb you know I went home Wednesday I went upstairs to go to bed just before midnight CU I was just vibrating I just driving home say oh thank you Lord thank you Jesus everything looked brighter the moon was different I said oh thank you Lord we're driving on say oh thank you Lord that was amazing thank you Jesus he's amazing the atmosphere around Christ is amazing that's amazing be wrong in your theology but be right in your atmosphere nothing gives you the right to treat people less you treat people at the some some do you treat strangers better than your wife and kids and and many of you treat people at the grocery store better you know you go to the grocery store your wife's coming behind you just go on you make her open the door even though she's got a weak arm but a stranger goes you go first what a hypocrite and then we come to each other and we think well I've been here longer I know more God revealed unto me something bless God my Revelation I ain't Chang it for nobody well praise God you a ain't change for nobody but your spirit's wrong watch our closing scripture here Ephesians 4 and I'm only going to read part of 11 now I know you nobody's going to like this one but I just I me know it's just the old word of God it's just it's only in the New Testament it's it's just the servant Paul that wrote it and you know he probably wasn't you probably got a greater Revelation than him and I understand all that stuff and but we'll just repeat it for sorry to bore you Ephesians 41 and he gave unto some and he gave unto some now who did the giv God God gave on to some let's go to the next verse for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of themselves oh for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the man measure and stature of the fullness of Christ let's stop there let's go back to verse 11 and he gave unto some let's go to verse 14 that we might henceforth be no more babies on Mama's mou toss to and fro carried about by every Revelation that God thinks you gave to you that you think think God maybe gave to you but he didn't give it to the five-fold ministry he gave it to the you know God is a decent businessman and when God gave the five-fold ministry it's unlikely that he'll give a revelation to Curtis or ilot ahead of the five-fold ministry I don't mean that God can't talk to them oh I'm not saying that but I but I'm just saying he gave oh he can speak to anybody that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's only God that woes you on to Christ but he gave henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about by every windy Doctrine by the Sligh of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in waight to deceive thee now I'm going to tell you what they might wait lie wait to deceive thee but it ain't going to be on this property it's not going to be not as long as I'm breathing it won't be on this property and I hope that part that my kids inher and Us in her because I could go and brother Carson could be the pastor brother mad amen they're going to take the services when I go to Salvador and whoever else God leads they lay weight to deceive see it's like this church it's it's very very very simple things are very simple in life like if if if a minister preaches something okay whether you like it or not and then somebody else has a different Doctrine one of the two are wrong and it's up to you to decide but there to leave them together God's not the author of confusion so it's not possible that they could come together two can't watch together unless they agree so there's people that brother Dale don't have fellowship with because they're just plain don't agree okay you know what I'm saying like if I invite you all over for breakfast I don't invite some people because we don't agree you'll notice there's churches that never invite us or Fellowship it's because we're not agreeable that's not wrong it's just you have the total right brother brother Brown said this that you as a Believer should know those the Bible says know those that labor among you but he said you have the right to choose the pastor of the home church that has the doctrine that you feel comfortable with and even the environment and and personality that that dovetails with your life you might like a skinny Pastor that laughs all the time or or a tall giant or you have that right but you do not have the right to touch God's anointed and do my profits no harm you don't have that right and I God help us verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may we grow up in him when all things which are the head Christ see the five-fold ministry is not the head it's Christ if I preach anything but the Bible and the message and Christ I'm wrong but it's not up to you to correct me it's just up to you to leave brother Brown said things like this that if you chose to come here I have this I have this is this okay is it okay to quote brother Brown he said if I choose to leave you in into a Jehovah's Witness Doctrine and you're okay with it you just stay right on with me that's what your Prophet said now I can assure you brother Dale ain't going there that that's like just but that's what the prophet said but you don't have the right to try to change my Jehovah's Witness Doctrine you have the right to choose to stay or to leave but you don't have the right to change my now that is exactly what our Prophet said [Applause] amen man that was hard to get out verse 16 from whom the body is fitly joined together and compacted by which every joint is supplied according to the effectual working working and measure of every part making increase the body until the edifying of itself in love amen I'm not done but I'm going to stop I have something I'm going to print off here it's not going to be up today but it's going to be up out in the hall and it's going to basically say this on this church property there's no talking or discussing or ministering on the Bible or the message unless you've been invited by me or you are me 1 Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints see God actually likes Church peace in all the churches because of the Saints praise God yeah 1 Corinthians 14 1 Corinthians 14:33 but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints but we are happy to encourage Fellowship you can come to my house every morning for breakfast we normally have baby breakfast sausages normally have a whole slew of eggs we buy 10 dozen eggs at a time or more you know and we normally have potatoes because we're not really R race people but we welcome lots of Fellowship you can't have too much fellowship with the family of God that's not possible well I guess brother Brown did say you could do everything too much but pray but in our world we don't have too much Fellowship no no we welcome lots and lots of Fellowship but we're not going to give way for confusion or a Pulpit for the devil because the devil never helped pay for this place and it's definitely not dedicated to him and so Ephesians 427 says neither give a place for the devil we need to pull that one up Amy and if anyone's found doing this giving a place to the devil they're going to be asked to stop and if they don't they're going to be asked to leave now in Jesus case he was the one that left in my case it's different and Jesus the reason Jesus left was he said this world is not my home if it was I would fight for it but he said I could call 10,000 Legions of angels to destroy the world and set me free but this world wasn't his kingdom neither is this world my kingdom but God has chose to bless us with this price to edify and magnify the bride of Christ glorify Christ and even in our shortcom failures we're still going to have the fivefold ministry on a regular basis John brother John Garrett is coming October 13th and he'll be here on Saturday and we can party huge on Saturday Fellowship amen Saturday night and John Garrett October 13th that's a nice scripture to end on ain't it amen amen go be on to something new whatever God has for us if you want want me to preach on something you ask God about it because God's Supernatural oh man I start out and I just like boom boom boom boom I love preaching on being his wife being impregnated where I could never loose going home to live with him predestination I mean those are things the Rapture I mean how could you not want to go in the Rapture and you'd rather stay here and see the gifts of the Spirit how could you not want to be the wife and only be a bride when what the wife can sign on the checkbook how could you not want to be adopted so you're positionally placed like the son where he was inherit everything that means I get all of God 100% like brother Brown said the spirit of Christ is in everyone that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the exact exactly the same identical Holy Spirit so we could read the scripture in John 1 what is it 20 or something or 13 where he became flesh and he's still flesh walking Among Us let's stand we're going to sing that song we have come into his house to magnify his name and worship Him Hallelujah e equ at least equally because if without you can be the seed of God now he will never allow this to happen but he would have to move you out of the way and speak through a donkey to create an atmosphere because he couldn't lose any of the seeds that are in his hand so if we being donkeys in this church can't create enough atmosphere for my kids to come back or your kids to come back or even the Town come back God will move us out of the way and bring another donkey in that'll create an atmosphere because he won't lose the seed but he will hell you live he will judge you eternally for not creating the atmosphere for the seed that he places in your life so I want to just tell you something I just happened to have a really awesome daddy that was an amazing prosperous farmer and you can't cannot be seed it is not possible to be seed and place in a growing atmosphere and you can hate God as much as you want you can hate me as much as you want and it don't matter how much your hatred is if the atmosphere is correct you will grow period remember the sidewalk where brother Braham talked about they poured sidewalk and poured concrete over every they did everything to hide the seed from the [Music] son you can't stop seed you might be a seed of God here this morning say I'm going to go my own way I'm going to do my own thing I'm young and I'm going to spread my wings and I'm going to set the town on fire I just tell you something if you're a seed of God God will create an atmosphere it won't matter if you're carried by tens of thousands of years of bad choices in your life don't matter if you got a foundation buried under the deepest part of Hell God will put that condition for that seed to grow do you know do you want me to tell you something I grow elf Alpha and they have actually discovered elf Alpha roots in caves caves multiple hundreds of feet deep if you're the seat of God you can try to run from God good look because it's a law it's a natural law under the condition you will grow it's just plain life it's just law Hallelujah God bless you we love you love you all we only want to be right we only want to be right we don't we just want to be right that's it I tried to show you Bible I only desire to be right but I'm not afraid of God what God will do for us God can do anything God wants to do we just want it to be God what it meant you understand I didn't mean that like I me I'm not afraid of any anything God desires God can do I didn't mean I was Stronger Than You
