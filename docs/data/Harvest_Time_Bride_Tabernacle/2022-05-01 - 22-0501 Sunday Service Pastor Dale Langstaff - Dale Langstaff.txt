musicians and jared and it's just a wonderful presence it's being his presence hallelujah we're going to read a scripture and you can have your seats a man just see lauren brother lauren and sister sheila just remember them amen just keep brother jim in your prayer also sister linda had been in the hospital she got brought home but brother jim's having some difficulties man god says delivered them amen every time and he still will amen just pray for him uh first john 4 and 18 first john 4 and 18 and i want to preach the next couple sundays or god wants to i want to title this living living in god's vision amen if you are his and predestinated you are living in god's vision hallelujah there's no fear in love but perfect love cast this out fear because fear hath torment we don't have torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love lord jesus may you just uh bless your word lord and just as we look into really you lord jesus we pray that you just take the scales off our eyes and take the stops out of our ears and just tell us and show us you and we'll praise you for all of eternity your beautiful name we pray amen man you may have your seats this morning it's just a just an amazing scripture here and you know you could go so many ways with this you could preach for the rest of time and this and i really uh i thought it was going to be two messages and then god kind of put it into one message and then i just had a lot of different confirmations even up to this morning and it was just really really fantastic what god is amen and what he wants to show you this morning and in the next few days amen i really want to stress before i start you know we are not a religion this is not a religion of any kind this is a family or a love affair both completely god knew you before you knew yourself there's no chance nothing is by perchance i want to just to lay a foundation i want to read just a couple other scriptures galatians 2 and 20 just to uh show you some of the thoughts of god and then just dive into this you know galatians 2 and 20. i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live but if you were crucified you're dead yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me let's go to romans along the same line romans 14 and 8 and this will lay our foundation for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord and whether we live therefore or we die we are the lords that pretty much takes care of fear amen that pretty much takes care now we know believers can't die because you've already died to be a believer you must have died but i want to show you and this was one of the confirmations that came to me you know the prophet had a picture of of you know a bunch of lights and he was kind of in the background preaching and there's a lot of lights in the picture and i've seen the picture multiple times it's i like a picture of somebody theophany or somebody before they die i'm sure i'm sure you've all seen it and i could actually i might even next suddenly show the video amen but in this picture and in this video brother branham tells perry green he says do you see the picture of the man's face behind me matt anybody heard that amen and he says i i hadn't heard it maybe ever for a long long time and he says he brother perry says he says yes he said i see it now he said now that you mentioned it and brother brown said he said now that's my old man and he said he looks like an indian and he said the reason he looks like an indian was because my grandma was an indian now watch what he says and he shows perry with his hands he says now when the holy spirit god comes and tabernacled into me my old man leaves me and he's behind me watch us i want you to catch us he has no power but he negs on me daily when you have those thoughts that i'm going to do something that's off the word that's your old man you're still a believer you're tabernacle but he paul said i die daily but the prophet said he's there he has no power so you know we have to be so careful in this this journey that we go with you now by that vision and i can show you that video there's a video of it in that you can be a believer now i'm not preaching sin you know that you know that i'm not preaching that but your flesh ain't perfect now it will get perfect it will it will it will get as perfect as it you know it's a journey but from the time you believe and christ comes into you he accepts your belief you're a believer but your body falls down or can't let me tell you that let me tell you now watch this keep this in your mind you are you are god's vision but so was rahab but she was a prostitute now i didn't say god made her a prostitute but that was her own nature and as she matures it got laid down you say well you don't have to brother dale you're going out on a limb hey when the when the spies went to rahab she said what'd she say she said our hearts burned she's still a full-fledged prostitute she's our hearts i think the bible says by hearing you know faith comes by hearing she said when we heard i'm a prostitute when we heard our hearts were whoa whoa so so watch us now a religious christian say oh bless god i was never a prostitute bless god i never went to that blessed god dirty house bless god i'll tell you she's oh god there's another lady like that in the bible too and god said he had an appointment with her all right so adjourns goodbye so judge not unless you be judged you could be no i'm not saying to sin i'm not saying that's a ticket sin but i'm saying you can be baptized with the holy ghost and your old nature is nagging you that's it's nagging you it might take you a couple days to lay down a sin now god will help you and you'll do it because because the bible says this body will come in subjection but it might not be like blitz lightning that's why we're still here because if it was blitz lightning then you just go like enoch and you'd be raptured you wouldn't even have to wait till the general retro wow ain't that something see you know in this picture of love there's no fear in love you are as free as can be but you know when you look into this it's so beautiful the bible says that no man ever hateth himself amen and the bible then maybe we'll turn to that ephesians 5 29 30 and 32 and god's talking here in ephesians 5 about marriage and husbands what but it was it was really wasn't that at all you can use it for that but was actually the marriage of christ and his bride and that's why he says in chapter 32 he said this is a great mystery now when you look into that it says no man never ever hateth his own flesh but nourishes it and nourished it as even the lord does the church now watch us why did god nourish the bride or the church because we were his foundation because a piece of him god isn't completely god without you because he dropped the seed of him in you before the foundation of the world and we as members of oh this is just unbelievable of his body now i just got done telling you it was his body members of his body and his flesh and of his bones see god's saying you love yourself and god loved himself too and now not now but you were a part of god see you always were a part of god or you won't be there and so that's why it's such a i know this is and even brother steve watch even what brother steve preach touched on and it was i just it took me all week to get over the weekend it was just beautiful it was just amazing you know he talked about samson was god's prophets or prophets are born did he make a mistake oh he made a he made a really but where is he at the end of his life the old nature he was flirting with a girl the old nature but his hair still grew amen it's beautiful see it's oh bless god i never had trouble with swimming like samson did careful see you actually when you're saying that let's go back to this other scripture when you're saying that but we are part of god so when you see somebody attack a believer when you see message believers attack believers even make believers could have attacked samson could have attacked graham could have attacked the woman at the well could have attacked david could have attacked me and they could have attacked you would jesus say i love how jesus puts it he says don't be bothered that they're attacking you why they attack me they i talked to all the prophets before there was you he even tells us the different scriptures to be rejoiced and being said praise god they lied about me hallelujah [Music] because see god couldn't lie about god you say oh now this just who was the accuser of the brethren the brother and the bride who was an accuser of the bride let's look at that revelations revelations we have it here somewhere oh maybe i have it here revelations 12 and and uh 12 while you're while you're pulling that up i want to read a quote 65 the invisible union of the bride of christ see you are living in god's vision and i get it next week i believe we're going to go into some of those visions that the prophet said said you want me to tell you what when you're predestinated and you're here and you're when you're rejoicing in the word nobody nobody can take your place absolutely nobody you are a part of god you came from god you're going back to god and there's that part of god that no that even god himself and the other part's gonna take your part my big toe never be my heart and my left ear will never be my right ear amen and my nose will never be my eyes she said well god don't need me bless god that's a lie from hell hallelujah here's the prophets talking about grain and ripening and i want to say this you know and he talks about that the grain will put all the life and emphasis into the the seed the the he's talking about the plant you know the wheat coming up or the grain coming up and the corn and i've seen that you know in times of drought especially especially in corn stocks you'll see that where when the corn is putting the cob out the corn is putting the cob out and you run into a dry season maybe late in august first of september and all the leaves on the bottom of the corn will die right up to the cob and that stock will empty every drop of moisture out of that stock to push the power into the kernel it'll die to save the colonel christ died to save the colonel it's just powerful it's just it's just amazing and he says so he said well you're separated from your first union and your spirit by spiritual death and you're born again and remarried again by a new spiritual union and it's your natural life and things of the world but of the eternal life that's the germ that's the key part that's the germ or g i'm sorry gene of god that was in you from the beginning he said now your old book is gone what it means by god don't misplace it it's it's back here it talks to you daily he said well you didn't need to you you don't need to you well you can look at it's gone it's gone from here but it's it's kind of like here remember it's powerless now your old book is gone with your old union and your name and your old and it's been transfigured and you say what do you mean tell me about my old book you see god put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you with this old man behind here talking to you daily saying his lies are still perfect in god's sight like david was perfect in god's sight at samson and rahab the woman at the well the real them now i'm going somewhere with this watch us he says now your name's in the new book of new book not the book of life not the book of life but in the lamb's book of life he said that's the land well that's what the lamb redeemed now your old book is your natural union but your new bride but you're new the bride hallelujah and your new life is the lamb's book of life and your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal gene from the beginning takes hold and now you're not watch this you're not forgiven you're justified because you didn't do it see you were tricked from eve it's nature in the garden and you say but brother dale bless god i know i've seen you do that and brother brown tells two stories about that i'm gonna go into he said you know if you see me you said you've seen me smoke it and he found out later i did it and you come by and you say well well you know i forgive you for smoking he said forgave me i didn't smoke he said but but but i'm going to forgive you he said you can't forgive me because i never did it and he said that's just like you the bride and christ wow you know you won't hear that at the corner church see god couldn't forgive you because the re because watch oh wow you came from god and god can't see sin he can't be sin so he can't forgive you because he knew you were him but he could redeem you from the pawnshop but it wasn't you that did it so he redeemed you and you're justified as if you never did it in the first and in god's thoughts you didn't smoke not the real you oh this nature from eve did and he's taking it from you or or looking at pictures or whatever it would be see god ain't getting that prostitute see see what god's marrying is a virtuous pure garmented with the word why royal seed of abraham and she never was touched by man's hands that's the germ that he put in you oh this might have made a mistake or two but god's looking at the film that he printed before this flesh was there because you were in the thoughts of god and he said all these wonderful people i'm going to just put up wow oh it's it's you won't get this is no great book amen hallelujah and your knowing life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate eternal gene from the beginning who takes hold he said now you're not he's oh here he says you're justified glory he said justifies romans 5 1. therefore in the beginning he said you're justified by faith hallelujah he actually says here he says you're not only forgiven but you're justified and then he corrects himself in the next page he said now when you look up the word the word don't mean forgiven so he watch watch this i want to i want to show you something for all the people that take every single word that the prophet he says now you're not only forgiven but you're justified glory justified like romans 5 1. the very next line look up the word the word don't mean forgiven so you're not forgiven the word means justified he says it don't mean same line it don't mean you're forgiven but he just said i was forgiven see for instance you heard that i i drunk got drunk and did some evil things and and all these other things and you come around to say you found out i didn't do them and he said well come around and say i forgive you to forgive me what are you you forgive me for what he says you can't forgive me i didn't even do them he says now if i didn't do them if now if watch this this is important he said now if i did do it i'm guilty but i but i could be forgiven and i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm justified because i actually done it it's just see it was he said now if i did do it i'm guilty but you could be you could forgive me if i did do get drunk you could forgive me but i but i'm but i wouldn't be guilty you see if i did do it if i did get drunk you could forgive me and i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not justified what he i'm sorry for that's confusing he gives an example he gives an example and he talks about a woman that lives improper in her life in her flesh he tells us earlier in the same message the bride union i i it's on my ipad he talks about that that woman in her flesh she can be forgiven but she'll never be justified in her flesh because she actually did an act that she was supposed to do but he said this life the predestinated life it's completely different amen but the word let's continue on paragraph he said but the word justify is though you've never done it amen it's not even regarded at all so all the faults that believe or see in your life what are you gonna do with that quote or what are you going to do with the scriptures but the word justified says though you never did it in the first place amen not even not even regarded at all how is it done in god's book of the sea of forgetfulness see god can't remember what your flesh did wrong but all the believers can but if they got the character of christ they won't be able to either because the prophet told us he said you can't stop a bird from flying over but you can stop from building a nest oh bless god i'll tell you a whole bunch of stories about brother dale why he used to do this when he was earlier you know and they'll lay a whole bunch of eggs up there because you let them nest you know the bird always nests really close to the mind you see satan's playground the cues are the brethren we're getting to this revelations where was i wow he said how's it done he said it's in god's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book the church get this part your old book and your old marriage of divorcement is in dead and god see a forgetfulness he don't know he's god but he don't know that you did it whoa watch us it's not even in god's memory amen you're justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you were accused of drinking and smoking and living in proper and looking at bad pictures you were accused and you the real you and you never done it in the first place now the old union is put in the sea of god's forgetfulness and you wasn't and you wasn't married to it to it to begin with watch was it your fault that's what he's saying he said he's the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you and he took your place when he died for us that was for our watches see he didn't die for your predestinated seed because your predestinated seed never did it he died for your flesh so he could take that and put it in the sea of forgetfulness man oh it's beautiful he said the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place and he took your plies for you and you were predestinated in him to be his bride before the foundation of the world so the bible said so you were his predestinated seed let's go to revelations 12 7 and to 12. this is where he says he says it was accused you was accused that you did it amen this is how by god's revelation when somebody's coming up and accuses the brethren now see god knows your heart god knows if you love the word amen that you know you know the vindication of of being you know with the baptism of the holy ghost is believing the word for your day man believe in the whole word of god amen being able to say amen to it but it don't mean you're flesh it's a process for your flesh watch this and there is a war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels under leia and they prevailed not neither was their place found in heaven okay now watch this i've got to stop here now where did you come from if you're going to heaven you came from heaven no man came from no man's going to have unless he first came from heaven that's important in this scripture we got to remember our destiny okay next one hallelujah and the great dragon was cast out in the serpent the old serpent called the devil and satan which deceived the whole world now it's not your predestinated seed remember that because you're not deceived you're here this morning you're not deceived deceived the whole world and he was cast into the earth and he and his angels were cast out with them okay it's the next verse and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now he's come the salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god now who's that that's us that's our salvation the kingdom our strength god's our salvation our strength and our kingdom amen like the lord's prayer thy kingdom come thy will be done amen hallelujah and the power of christ and the accused [Music] and the accuser you know god always uses flesh to work through amen let me let me let me let's do it let's do a trial is god here this morning but but the bible says no man's ever seen god but you brought god because god's in you so god's here this morning and you so who are you you're a small g god okay watch us and the accuser uh for the accuser of the brethren is cast down which accuses them before god day and night so anybody he says well bless god i went to that church and not now there is places that are off the word that ain't to say you know if there was somebody that's off the scriptures you say well this is what the scripture says and they're not lined up i'm talking about people putting guilt on holy ghost-filled believers god's predestination accused in god's predestination that's what we're talking about the next scripture is important oh sorry sorry and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony that's us right we're confessing christ and the word of our testimony and they love not their lives until the death that means you don't need to wear a mask regardless what the world lists us yeah i'm afraid of dying you know what you do with that verse amen therefore rejoice oh you have it now that means we should be rejoicing right you know i want to tell you a story in the middle of this we went to a wedding yesterday and they were happy at the wedding and there's nothing wrong with that how can you be god's family and be sad you think jesus is in heaven like oh my but see the prophet called us starchy and he said if you don't have no emotion bury it your daddy so you're in a love affair with christ and you're i never seen anybody at the wedding fall asleep and for sure not at the reception or after the kisses they were like but if you were starting at that wedding your starchy this morning because you're still packing the same flesh if you were happy at the wedding in the flesh you'd be happy this morning because that's just how that's why africa is like that you know it don't matter where you go to africa and i'm just giving you a paraphrase you can always disorder it they're well done because they're just bouncy type of people they have no problem they get to church they're just therefore rejoice now that don't mean you haven't now remember we came from heaven so we're just on a trip here and sometimes when you go camping to algonquin park my kids have told me this if it rains the whole trip it's not the greatest you know you can kind of prepare that's what we're in we kind of prepared but it might rain a bunch when we're here because watch this scripture and ye that dwell in them now that's us right because john 3 13 says that no man ascended up to heaven but first he came down from heaven first and the son of man that was talking to him said he's there right now oh that's dead my favorite scripture but you're going to rejoice all ye heaven and ye that dwell in the heavens that's me i'm there right now but i'm preaching to you this morning i'm no different in christ you say you're lying to me well then i'd like to see you tell christ he was lying because he was standing right in front of him he said christ jesus is there right now and he's telling them he's already standing in jerusalem but watch this is the part you need to but whoa to the inhabitants of the earth it's reigned in a golf course and the inhabitants of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth his time the accuser of the brothers satan and he's attacking things on the earth but we're not of the earth we came from heaven so he might try to get to our flesh but he'll never get to the predestinated sea amen because our predestinated seed ain't from the earth amen we know that our flesh is because flesh and blood don't carry the kingdom of heaven amen this was our proving ground to satan the god in this age would take a wife a bride and she would be a happy bride see let's go back to our first scripture there's no fear in love you can't serve god and be in fear you're not get if i mean unless it's some kind of a warp deal you're not getting married and fearful of the person that you're married wow can i finish this quote how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent even it ain't your fault no did you ask to be born in the flesh it's not your fault it's no fault of your own by your own birth you came after eve who had committed adultery and that's the reason you were born an adulteress you're a sinner to begin with the flesh that's right but you was deceived into it and you had no no you ain't your fault it ain't your fault that's how you never did it the real you it's the next prayer it's 2 30. he said you never did it because the little germ that's in you was to be with you before the foundation of the world and that's the germ that god put a name to in the lamb's book of life now he says something about this he says now you heard the story of my little eagle in the barnyard and the head farmer found an egg and he put it under the chicken and the eagle was in the barnyard and that eagle was eating grain and it was scratching in the the stuff but it wasn't supposed to scratch in that stuff it wasn't me but was it his fault was it his fault that the farmer went took the egg put it under an eagle no wasn't his fault none of that stuff in that chicken yard none of that stuff went on in the chicken yard will be held accountable to that eagle but when the lord jesus flew over and he went whoa uh huh ray up our hearts burned within us he said we never had strength in our legs to stand for fear of the things that your god had done wow no wonder our prophet could say that believers would walk where angels had more sense to go he said where angels would fear to tread wow god help us god help us see what god thinks of you love love you know if you we're going into let me let me go into first john 4 and 17. now we read 18 and i want to go back a verse for satan's to to clench something 17. we're not talking about love that's like [Music] it goes you don't have to put clothes on this morning someone at the wedding forgot to get dressed this love can still speak the truth you want to read a good scripture you read all the chapter 4 first john it's all about love therefore is our love made perfect that we may be wimps and you say that's off the word brother that's a lie boldness though we may have perfect love that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he was so are we this world see christ himself don't even lower you below him remember that old man the indian head oh he sure does oh yeah he tells you about the chicken yard remember when the chickens hate that thing and the farmer brought out the bean meal and the corn had mold in it and you ate that corn and you were supposed to be eating just fresh cut flesh that's the indian man he's powerless but he's talking to you and you need to tell him a few things like uh where he's going and and like a few other words like uh femi's the boosh and shut up that was one of the only french words i could remember in school you know femi chaboosh i mean it was important he needs to tell satan that amen i know you're in i know where you came from and i know where you're going man but i also know where i came from and i know where i'm going to because i'm living the vision that god had oh that's beautiful this ain't no denomination this ain't about brother dale preaching they're saying about this church they're saying about the church in wyoming this ain't about any church this ain't even about the mess this is about this is about a wedding this is about christ and a bride a wife a wedding we're going to uh can you imagine the party there i mean we went home at nine o'clock last night but can you imagine like a thousand years a party i mean they're gonna have good pepsi there just think of that think of how christ is going to dance with his pride for 1 000 years you say oh damn bless god i would never do that that's what the prophet said though god anointed him and he went dancing too remember david's wife when david danced oh he was dancing under the anointing of the spirit but he got so consumed in the spirit that he took off his clothes you know see see we have this hard dutch canadian cold weather philosophies like of course we believe in being modest and women and men's apparel and all that that you have to do that to get to heaven how come god never judged david for that instead he cursed david's wife for laughing at him now when you get that one figured out i'll ask you another question you see love see the bible says will be peculiar that's why women will look like one you know what i'm talking about you know holiness is beautiful if you don't think so go look at the mennonite people they still have it i ain't seen an ugly mennonite girl yet it's just it's just like a radiant it's because it's god he said well bless god careful no man will see god without holiness wow but david was so consumed he was so happy when the ark watches that was just a type wow that means our prophet said i know you say well bless god he's careful our prophet said he's here right now not a type he said right now and when you could feel his presence in the worship service what was this i'll just say ouch ahead of time for you like brother steve i'd say ouch once or twice when you say ouch and the reason you could stay in your pew is because you're starchy dutch cold canadian that goes for me too because it's not a tight now it's the presence of jehovah god your groom and if david in a type in the old testament before the baptism of the holy ghost was given danced so violently that he tore his clothes off and god never rebuked them and you could stay in your pew all put together and i got nine fingers pointing at me are we going to a wedding the prophet said clearly multiple times we're already married and we're we're already been pronounced wife you have to be if you're a small g god and we're going to the party but the wedding is part of the party careful you don't get too much carry over amen oh bless god i was raised that's the old indian because he don't want you to break loose in the presence of your lord he don't want you to show us why did satan fight jesus michael the angel god jehovah god only one reason because he wanted your worship your worship he don't want to be prayed watch us don't get it wrong satan was in heaven and that's where pure holy people go watch this satan didn't come to earth to get the praise of prostitutes that's cheap praise god cast saved earth but satan wants your praise and if the next thing to your praise obviously you can't give it to him watch this i'm preaching to myself the morning you'll ever know the next thing he'll do if he can't take your praise which you can't give it to them because you only have one husband one lord so it's impossible for you to praise them but it's not to praise the lord at all he'll keep this thing oh don't don't say you don't think so spiritual what did the lady say when he came to our prophet remember he said you brag on jesus too much what did sarah call abraham this has nothing to do with flesh brothers listen brothers and sisters when we get to heaven brothers aren't the head we're we're his bride period this has nothing to do with some cheap stupid hitler dictatorship this has to do with worshiping god but sarah called abraham my lord but that's just how we should be with our lord not not each other but it's it's all the what what was the scripture it's a mystery concerning christ and the church he just told you about husbands and wives just so you knew what pain she was on so when you come to a love affair with god you should be drunk stone drunk in the presence of jehovah god that's why that's why this is no game that's why on friday night lucifer imitates god's jehovah presence before the foundation of the world and gets people to go out and drink happy water to get drunk in an imitation of the real genuine baptism of the holy ghost and the life that'll follow it and when they ask peter they come out of the upper and he said you are stone drunk and peter said this is that the jewel spoke of and it's just the third hour of the day watch this satan will deceive brother dale he knows that i'll brag on jesus he knows i won't he knows i won't br that's oh let me rephrase that he knows i won't brag on him so he'll get me not to brag on anybody like jesus and he ain't got your praise but he's getting the same effect that wow amazing amazing love see this is not no religion this ain't no church this ain't about churches saying about pews this is about jehovah god a life in a marriage and uh just it's just amazing that you never did it the real you never did it in the first place wow john 15 13 we're going to close soon with this he said no greater love hath a man then he'll lay down his life for his friends i want to close with this thought how could jesus lay down his life when our prophet said it wasn't the nails that held them there jesus said himself itself to the disciples when he had peter put his sword away he said don't you know i could have called for ten thousand legions of angels to destroy the world and set me free you know how christ could die for you you could look in the scriptures let's just let's just tell the story here for a second if you give me a couple minutes look back in genesis where god made mad it made this man first in genesis i don't know if it's one or two but it says it made god made man in his image male and female but it was one person and then about seven scriptures verses now said god made flesh made a flesh man made abraham in the flesh he had already made the man in the image of god and then so watch us so so all you sisters god made man and woman in his image then he made the flesh body and then he cracked the rib off of the one and put it in the woman directly the image amen now you could say you i know some ministers would say well the man was the image of god and the woman was the byproduct in the flesh maybe but not in the creation not in the spirit you go to genesis i'm not sure where it is but i think it's genesis 3 right near the beginning he said god made man in his image man and woman in its image it was one person he hadn't made the body yet hadn't made the body yet so no greater love hath a man that he would lay down his life he wasn't just laying down for his friends he was laying it down for his wife wife male in the first image there wasn't male or female man was made in the image of god you say woman was made the the see what i'm trying to say is we were made in god's image and he laid down his life for his wife it's beautiful and you just look at how that goes in in the to uh predestination and all of these things it's just amazing amazing thank you lord amen hallelujah no greater love at the man to lay down his life now we in our flesh will surrender our will of this flesh to the real person inside you know back when we read our first scripture there's no fear and love god never forced himself on anyone but the reason god drew you was he was in you that's amazing through predestination that's why not all you know i you know i gotta i gotta tell you i gotta show you something somewhere here i'm sorry just oh wow well i might go into this part of my i can't find my scripture right now well maybe if i opened it up and maybe i could but the bible says i can't i can't lay my fingers on the scripture but the bible says if you were of the world they'd love you but see because you're of god i know it's here so much but because you're of god they hate you that goes right back to genesis see the ones that were made in the image of god sorry i can't that's for next week amen but you were made in god's image and that's the reason the world hates you so if we go back to the people matt you know the people and the prophet and and i'm i'm not taken away from what the prophet said but you know the prophet said we misunderstand the prophet the prophet said in this last time that the bride will become unified but the bible says that not all israel was israel and only two went in and so when people put posts on the internet or stuff and they actually well you know the churches are really gonna the churches will never all come together no because they're not all bright don't matter what you put on the sign it's your life see it didn't matter what israel called for a king is there life will you watch us will you go to the promised land that proves your life the ones that are in the pro not gold the ones that are in the promised land will all be in unity but it won't be see we're we're doing a crossover you're looking at the flesh you think well all the all the people that say he said don't preach me a message live me one don't tell me a testimony which they're good and and telling the message too is good but if you can live it those are the ones that have went over those are the ones that will be unified that man so don't be discouraged when you say well not everybody's come together yet so i still got a little bit of time that's an old man telling you that that's all that meant on you because the ones that are there they're already unified because see i'm here but i'm already in heaven so i'm already unified because i'm not really here i'm actually there but i'm talking to you but i'm actually there because god's talking to me there sending it down to me here that's crazy but that's true that's crazy that's true man if you ever get a hold of that that's how peter that's how god could call peter that was that's how he could call brother dale when he felt great that's nothing to do with flesh absolutely nothing to do with flesh nothing to you with flesh i know the bible says study show yourself proof and i do that but how would a peter studied when he couldn't read and write his own name it's nothing to do with flesh has everything to do with jehovah man what our prophets say my greatest gift is getting out of the way just shut up and get out of the way and then it's all god amen let's stay thank you lord oh he's he's amazing thank you lord hallelujah i'll tell you this this morning church no fear and love god's not afraid that you won't make it you might be afraid you're not going to make it that's that's that indian head but god ain't afraid god already he see he knew before you knew and that's that's just amazing no fear in love how could he love you because he knew it's beautiful amen thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord you are we are i i believe with all my heart every person here you are literally living with brotherdale's mistakes i'm literally living the vision liter you see the footsteps of the lord are ordered of the lord i'm man this is unbelievable how did god send the spies to a prostitute whorehouse the footsteps of the lord are ordered of the lord and even in your shortcomings it's unbelievable he's here this morning like you never believe remember our prophet said all the denominational word would preach that jonah had backslidder run from god and our prophet said he was perfectly in god's will and your shortcomings your god will see maybe god i'm not saying god made you sin but god will turn that to his glory he will take your mud and turn it to diamond and he knew that jonah had to run from him and he had to prepare a fish and when he went out to it do you think of this he went out to a heathen nation he then i i'm going to shut her down on this he went out to a heathen pagan country superpower of the world and they put sackcloth on their animals jonah's message was so powerful because in their pagan sin god used their pagan sin watch this if you got a pagan problem this morning god used their pagan sin to convert them because they worship the god of the ocean and jonah walked out of the god of the and they just recognized god there's god just like moses was god the pharaoh he was he was jehovah god to pharaoh jonah was jehovah god to those people but he wasn't but he was and they were so affected in their sin it turned up to god wow take that devil take all my mistakes god will turn them to his beauty and see what you think of that oh it's it's just unbelievable you can see why it's not hard to man gotta just come with the thought and i'll just look that up and it's just like dump a whole pail of thoughts and i just looked them all up and just oh it's unbelievable just that's nothing nothing to do with flesh nothing you never came to god god took you oh man let's sing the size off he's he's unbelievable church oh man he became me i might become him by grace [Music] in my grace [Music] took my place [Music] me so that i might become him hallelujah me so that i might become in my grave [Music] hallelujah think of those words he took my place [Music] [Music] his words are so beautiful i started to tell you [Music] god sent it back to me to finish my story i said in genesis when god made us in his image and then later on he made flesh he made the body god's not marrying somebody that had ever touched sin because he's marrying the image the image the first image he's not marrying the man he's marrying the first image that he created because god is a spirit and those that worship him must worship in men spared and a truth he made a body and he and tabernacle but he ain't marrying the body he's marrying the image so if your body fell down and you were in rachel rahab's whorehouse he ain't marrying that body i i tell you why because he brought the lineage of himself right through those lineages rahab and then david came up and david had stole the other man's wife and christ came right through thousands he came right through all that sin the house and david stealing the wife and prostitution and all that he came through all that but he did because he didn't take the bodies oh he took the image that was in his mind that's why he say you didn't do it you were tricked but it wasn't i married you and then some other things happened but it wasn't it wasn't the person i married because oh oh that's just crazy that's just crazy you can just take all that garbage and just leave it to the man behind oh he became me so that i might become him by grace he became me hallelujah i might become him [Music] hallelujah lord thank you jesus he took my [Music] [Applause] he became me so that i might become him by grace oh hallelujah lord jesus we love you thank you for preaching this morning lord you just you just you're just amazing you literally just blow our minds how you're just so wonderful blessed to be here beautiful lord i pray that through all these scrambled stories and words a rape from your throne that you would show them to these beautiful bride of christ your thoughts that you had planned in your mind before the foundation of the world how in your mind the marriage had already taken place because you made it that there couldn't this covenant couldn't be broken because it was already signed hallelujah you came yourself and you placed a part of you in each one of us and there's no fear that you'll be lost thank you lord jesus blessed be your beautiful name hallelujah thank you jesus for your wonderful presence please don't ever take it from us please come and show us as we live in this flesh and we fight battles and demons of the flesh may your sweet holy spirit come and take every
