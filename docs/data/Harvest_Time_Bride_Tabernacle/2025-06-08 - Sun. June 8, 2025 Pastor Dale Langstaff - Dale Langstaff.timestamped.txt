[17:17] world. Hallelujah.
[17:20] We love you, Lord Jesus. Bless your
[17:22] bride here. All that have come
[17:25] represented here. And Lord, we just pray
[17:28] that you'll be with us here in this
[17:30] place. And even those that are watching
[17:33] online right now, Lord God, because of
[17:36] of sickness or distance or different
[17:38] things, Lord God, bless them, Lord. And
[17:41] may you be with the ministering of your
[17:43] word, Lord God. We pray in Jesus' name.
[17:48] Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:51] Amen. God bless you. God bless you all.
[17:56] It's good to be in his house today. And
[18:00] Amen. I couldn't believe the furnace was
[18:02] running this morning when we got
[18:04] here. I don't know if the furnace and
[18:07] the calendar have got mixed up and the
[18:09] time of year it is, but uh Amen. It's
[18:14] good. Thank you, musicians. Thank you,
[18:16] Jared. Amen. We're going to take our
[18:19] Bibles and turn to 2 Corinthians 5:20.
[18:23] We just welcome everyone and our visitor
[18:25] and just good
[18:27] to good to be
[18:30] here. Amen. We want
[18:33] to look at a thought
[18:36] here that God desires us to come to.
[18:41] Amen. And many of the bride of Christ
[18:45] will. Amen. And now then we are
[18:50] ambassadors
[18:52] for Christ. As though God did beseech
[18:55] you by us, we pray you in
[19:00] Christstead. Be ye reconciled
[19:03] to God. Amen. Amen. Lord Jesus, we pray
[19:06] that you'll add your blessing to the
[19:08] word and and just be with every heart
[19:10] and hearer here this morning and be with
[19:12] the speaker. Lord, we thank you for
[19:14] touching my voice and my body and Lord,
[19:17] God bless those that have prayed for me
[19:19] in sickness. Lord, just be with this
[19:22] word today. In your name we pray. Amen.
[19:25] Amen. You may have your seats. Just uh
[19:28] thank all of you that have prayed for
[19:29] me. Wednesday night, I had almost zero
[19:31] voice at all, but God is good and and we
[19:36] just praise him for his touch. We want
[19:38] to look and title our message today on
[19:43] ambassadors. Amen. And you know,
[19:45] ambassadors is more than somebody that's
[19:48] a citizen of a country. It's more than
[19:51] somebody that's just a uh you know, you
[19:54] know, a a citizen or a member of an
[19:57] organization, but it's somebody that can
[19:59] be trusted and and and put confidence in
[20:03] to be sent out in a representation.
[20:06] That's right. for another government.
[20:08] That's right. And here here Paul's
[20:10] telling us in Corinthians that now we
[20:12] are God's ambassadors. That's why we are
[20:15] not our own, but we are Christ. And we
[20:18] are actually not speaking our own
[20:20] thoughts, but we're speaking Christ's
[20:22] thoughts. Amen. We're not speaking our
[20:24] own words. We're speaking Christ's word.
[20:26] And and you know the prophet goes into
[20:28] this a bunch but you know if we look in
[20:29] Ephesians
[20:31] 2:19-21 he says now we are therefore
[20:34] therefore ye are now more strangers and
[20:37] foreigners but citizens with the saints
[20:42] and the household of God. And you're
[20:44] built up upon the foundations of
[20:45] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[20:49] himself, being the chief cornerstone in
[20:52] whom all the building fitly framed
[20:55] together and groweth unto the holy
[20:58] temple of God. Amen. You know, to be an
[21:02] ambassador, Brother Bam said in in the
[21:05] end time seats, he said because Christ
[21:07] has died and resurrected that we're now
[21:09] his delegates. Yeah. And we're we're set
[21:12] forth for a witness to Christ. That's
[21:15] right. Amen. Now, you'll see here in the
[21:20] meaning of an an ambassador, who is an
[21:22] ambassador? An ambassador is an
[21:25] accredited diplomat. It's an accredited
[21:28] Christian. Yeah. A person that's sent
[21:32] from heaven,
[21:34] sent from a country to be its official
[21:37] representation.
[21:38] Sure. Yeah. Here on earth. That's right.
[21:41] Now, I believe for the bride of Christ,
[21:44] that should be the goal and that should
[21:46] be the purpose for every one of us here.
[21:48] We know that we were in the mind of God
[21:50] and we came from God in Genesis 1:26 and
[21:53] 27. And so, we're citizens of another
[21:56] country,
[21:58] but we're sent as ambassadors to
[22:01] wherever God's placed you. Amen. That's
[22:04] right. To not be your own thoughts. No,
[22:06] brother said you don't have a thought
[22:08] coming,
[22:10] but are you going to be trustworthy
[22:12] to carry God's thoughts?
[22:15] You know, a pastor is the highest
[22:17] ranking official representing a country.
[22:20] Yes.
[22:23] That you've left and you're stationed at
[22:25] another place.
[22:27] They are officially essentially sorry
[22:30] the
[22:31] boss of the ambassador to the country to
[22:35] be the head of state in another country
[22:39] and they represent their home country
[22:41] the entrance the interests of God. They
[22:44] negotiate agreements and foster
[22:48] relationships
[22:50] in the host country. You know, God has
[22:52] no hands
[22:55] but your hands. Amen. God has no body
[22:59] but your body. Amen. He has no mouth but
[23:03] your mouth. God's not here in a separate
[23:05] body. God's here in your body.
[23:09] You are his ambassador. That's right.
[23:12] You are the official voice
[23:16] for the host country.
[23:18] Glory
[23:21] on behalf of God. You're a crucial
[23:24] role in maintain God maintaining
[23:27] relationships
[23:29] with mankind. Yeah. God came down and
[23:32] became a man. Yes. And he placed his
[23:34] spirit in man. That's right. So he could
[23:37] have a relationship
[23:40] with mankind. Amen. I want to look at
[23:42] here are seven
[23:44] marks or seven examples or seven parts
[23:49] to being an ambassador. And we'll look
[23:52] at some things that that you know after
[23:54] this the Bible and the prophet said
[23:56] about
[23:57] ambassadors. But first off to be an
[23:59] ambassador you must be a citizen. Yes.
[24:03] Of the country you're representing.
[24:05] That's right. You must have come from
[24:07] God to represent God. Amen. There will
[24:11] be no elegance. There will be no
[24:13] foreigners representing the home
[24:15] country. And we see that in 2
[24:18] Corinthians 5:17, it said, "Now that if
[24:22] any man be in Christ,
[24:24] you're a brand new creature." That's
[24:27] right. Hallelujah. Amen. Even first
[24:30] Peter 1:18 and 19, it says we're
[24:33] redeemed by the precious blood of
[24:36] Christ, which makes us a member
[24:38] membership,
[24:41] a
[24:41] citizen of heaven. These are
[24:44] qualifications and marks that would
[24:48] show if you qualified to be an
[24:51] ambassador for God. Yeah.
[24:55] You must be the person that would be set
[24:58] out for an ambassador must be above
[25:01] reproach. That's right. It must not have
[25:03] a dou doubtful character. And Christ
[25:06] requires his ambassadors
[25:09] to live above suspicion. Yes. Christ's
[25:13] not going to send somebody out that's
[25:16] got dual personalities.
[25:18] He's got dual message. It's confusing.
[25:21] Yes. He's going to have a very clear
[25:23] message
[25:25] that sent out. God, help us to not have
[25:29] any smut on our testimony.
[25:32] Help us our lives would line up. We see
[25:37] here in 2 Corinthians, the same
[25:39] scripture, if you read the last part of
[25:41] that, it said, "Old things are passed
[25:43] away. And behold, all things become have
[25:47] become new."
[25:50] Even Philippians 2 and 15 it says that
[25:54] ye may be
[25:55] blameless and harness harmless the sons
[25:59] of God
[26:01] without rebuke. These would be all
[26:06] qualifications for an ambassador of
[26:09] Christ. But here we see that Paul said
[26:12] that God's made us his ambassadors.
[26:15] Amen. But do we qualify?
[26:19] This would be some of the
[26:21] qualifications. Three, for a
[26:23] qualification, he said to be an
[26:25] ambassador, you must be selfless.
[26:28] You must be willing to put aside
[26:30] completely
[26:32] your own interests.
[26:34] To do the will of Christ.
[26:38] God help us. Here Paul said in 1
[26:41] Corinthians 15:31, he said, "I protest
[26:44] by your rejoicing which I have in Christ
[26:47] Jesus our Lord that I die daily." That's
[26:52] right. Paul had to die daily. He had to
[26:55] die to his thoughts and his agenda and
[26:57] his will to let Christ live in him. John
[27:02] 12:24 says, "Verily the same thing." He
[27:05] said, "Verily, verily I say unto you,
[27:07] here Jesus is talking." He said, "Let
[27:09] the corn of wheat fall into the ground
[27:11] and die, it'll buy alone. But if it
[27:14] dies, it bringeth forth
[27:17] much fruit." This was a qualification
[27:21] that we must
[27:23] have to be an ambassador for Christ.
[27:27] Here in Galatians 2:20, it says, "I am
[27:29] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[27:32] live, but yet not I. It's not me that
[27:35] liveth, but it's Christ that liveth in
[27:37] me." That's right. And the life which I
[27:39] now live in the flesh, I live by the
[27:42] faith
[27:44] of the son of God, who loveth me and
[27:48] gaveth
[27:50] himself for me. All
[27:54] qualifications to be an ambassador. See,
[27:57] you know, if you you know, if you think
[27:58] of this naturally, you know, the best
[28:01] example, and forgive me for for but you
[28:03] know, every government has their own uh
[28:07] theme that they get voted in for. And
[28:09] you know, the best way to to look at
[28:12] that would be in the states, you know,
[28:13] they just got a new president. And so
[28:16] when he would send somebody out, you're
[28:19] speaking for the president. Yeah. And
[28:22] you're going to have a short life in
[28:24] that job if you start speaking your own
[28:26] thoughts. That's right. That
[28:29] government's going to give you the
[28:32] right. But we know that every government
[28:34] on land will crumble. That they're only
[28:37] for a phrase of time. But our heavenly
[28:40] kingdom is eternal. That's right. Yeah.
[28:43] And it'll last for eternity.
[28:46] That's right. Amen. God won't send out
[28:49] ambassadors
[28:51] that aren't preaching, aren't
[28:53] witnessing, aren't living his life.
[28:55] Amen. Another qualification for being
[28:59] ambassador, you must be in constant
[29:02] connection with the King of Kings.
[29:05] You're not going to be too busy building
[29:07] your own kingdom and raising your bank
[29:09] account that they're going to turn to
[29:10] digital currency.
[29:13] No, but you're going to be in a constant
[29:14] frame of prayer.
[29:17] That just just I don't mean on your
[29:19] knees all the time, but I mean when you
[29:20] wake up in the morning, you're praying.
[29:22] When you're driving your car down the
[29:24] road, you're praying. When you're at
[29:27] work, you're praying.
[29:29] You're in constant connection
[29:33] with the boss, Jesus Christ.
[29:37] Because see, if you're not in constant
[29:39] connection,
[29:40] you don't know what he wants. Amen. You
[29:43] don't you're not up to date with the
[29:46] format for the day. You know, us in the
[29:50] flesh, we we worry so much about our
[29:52] fleshly body that's going to ride away.
[29:54] But most of us eat regularly at least
[29:57] once a day. Yeah. But what about being
[30:00] connected to the throne?
[30:03] Amen.
[30:04] If we ate as much spiritual food as we
[30:06] ate physical food. Yeah.
[30:09] That's right.
[30:11] Amen. That's right. Number five, to be a
[30:14] qualified as an ambassador for Christ,
[30:17] you must be steadfast
[30:20] and loyal.
[30:22] That means in hard times,
[30:25] you have a backbone. You see this in
[30:28] Acts 16 where Paul healed the woman that
[30:31] had the devil and the the men there in
[30:34] the city were making money on her,
[30:36] laughing at her and making jokes of her
[30:39] and she was following Paul and Silas and
[30:41] and it was disturbing Paul and he healed
[30:43] her and cast out the evil spirit.
[30:47] That sounds like a nice thing to do.
[30:49] Yeah. But they took them and they
[30:52] whipped them and beat them and put them
[30:55] in jail and put them in stocks. Yeah.
[30:58] Because they did
[31:00] what the master
[31:02] Yeah. said to do. Sometimes in your life
[31:06] if you're following the word of God,
[31:08] you're going to get whipped and you're
[31:10] going to get beaten out the country and
[31:11] you're going to be putting stocks in
[31:13] that country and you're going to be in
[31:14] the other country's jail. Amen. Because
[31:17] you're following the orders. That's
[31:18] right. From the host country. Glory.
[31:23] That's right. Amen. Here in Ephesians
[31:25] 6:20, it says, "For I ambassadors in
[31:28] bonds." Paul talking. I'm ambassadors of
[31:31] bonds. It's a union connection whereby I
[31:34] may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
[31:38] Paul Paul, if anybody in the scripture
[31:42] Yeah. didn't back down from the gospel.
[31:45] No. Even Peter, he he confronted him to
[31:48] the face of people that would He said,
[31:50] "If anybody come to preach a different
[31:52] gospel than this gospel, let him be a
[31:54] curse." Sure.
[31:57] Paul was a man's man.
[31:59] Yeah.
[32:01] Just let that sink in for a second. It
[32:04] was no
[32:05] mistake that Jesus chose him as the
[32:08] ambassador. Yeah. To bring the
[32:11] dispensation of grace. Yeah. There's not
[32:15] another man in the Bible
[32:18] that could have changed the dispensation
[32:20] from law to grace and to works to love
[32:24] but Paul.
[32:26] Yeah, that's right.
[32:30] Because he was a man.
[32:32] He was a man of God. When he got the
[32:34] orders from
[32:35] glory, nothing stepped in his way.
[32:39] Travel never stepped in his way.
[32:41] Poisonous snakes never stepped in his
[32:43] way. Prisons never stepped in his way.
[32:47] Locks and gates open. He shook off
[32:49] serpents as his hand. Said, "I ain't got
[32:52] an appointment."
[32:54] Yeah. For the diplomat, the host
[32:56] country.
[32:58] Hallelujah. Number six, you must be able
[33:01] to diplomat. You must have diplomacy.
[33:05] The art of negotiation.
[33:08] Now that that sounds that sounds like
[33:10] that's an ability of yourself. No, cuz
[33:13] we have no wisdom of our own.
[33:17] But in James 15, it says, "If any man
[33:19] lack wisdom,
[33:21] let him ask of God that giveth all men
[33:25] liberty,
[33:27] how to handle every situation
[33:32] in your life." That's right. in your
[33:34] community, in the country that you're
[33:37] the ambassador for.
[33:39] See,
[33:40] God will give you the wisdom to deal
[33:44] with the negotiation.
[33:46] And lastly, as we come to the end of our
[33:49] our requirements as an ambassador is you
[33:52] must know the
[33:54] language of the people where whom you
[33:57] live.
[33:58] You must know the language of the
[34:01] country that God sends you to. And I
[34:04] don't mean just the language, but you
[34:06] must understand the the uh the what's
[34:10] the word I'm looking for? Understand the
[34:12] the traditions.
[34:14] [Music]
[34:15] The country
[34:17] that God will send you to. You know,
[34:19] every country has unique traditions and
[34:22] what we would call evil maybe is
[34:24] standard equipment in another country
[34:26] because it was just laws of men.
[34:29] Men make a lot of laws in churches,
[34:32] but they're just man's laws.
[34:37] I'm thrilled to live under the
[34:39] age that Paul brought of grace and love.
[34:43] Amen.
[34:45] You must understand the language of the
[34:47] country. Let me give you an example of
[34:49] this in Luke 10
[34:53] 30-35. This may surprise you here. Jesus
[34:56] said, he said, "A certain man went down
[34:59] from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell
[35:02] among thieves and they stripped his
[35:04] raignment and wounded him and departed
[35:07] leaving him half
[35:10] dead. And by chance there came down a
[35:13] certain priest."
[35:15] Now, that guy would have for sure took
[35:17] care of him.
[35:19] Well, he he's a priest.
[35:23] They came by the way and when he saw
[35:24] him, he passed on the other side. See,
[35:27] he would fail the ambassador
[35:29] qualifications. Yes.
[35:32] This is Jesus giving this example. Yeah.
[35:35] Jesus is showing us
[35:38] what our age
[35:39] is and qualification for being an
[35:43] ambassador. And likewise a Levite. Whoa.
[35:47] Oh. Oh, that's another minister.
[35:51] Uhoh. When he saw that place, he came
[35:54] and looked on him and passed by also
[35:58] on the other side. But a certain
[36:00] Samaritan,
[36:04] as he journeyed, he came. And when he
[36:06] saw
[36:06] him, he had compassion upon him. That's
[36:09] right. and he went to him and bound up
[36:11] his wounds and poured oil and wine and
[36:14] set him on his breast and bought for him
[36:18] in the end to take care of him.
[36:22] See, you must understand the
[36:24] language of the country that's sending
[36:27] you out. Yeah. And what Christ intends
[36:30] for you to do
[36:33] as his missionary, as his ambassador.
[36:36] Yeah.
[36:39] How are we supposed to live our daily
[36:40] lives?
[36:44] Well, we'll know if we're connected to
[36:45] the throne. That's right. On a regular
[36:48] basis. But this is just a small part of
[36:52] the qualifications where Paul said in
[36:54] Corinthians that Christ has made us
[36:56] ambassadors. Yeah. He He Christ can't
[36:59] survive without ambassadors.
[37:03] He's got them all around the world.
[37:05] Yeah.
[37:07] ambassadors. 2 Corinthians 6:1 it says,
[37:10] "We then as workers together with him
[37:13] beseech you also that you receive not
[37:16] grace of God in
[37:18] vain." What are you doing with what God
[37:21] gave you?
[37:24] God gave you a lot. He gave you his
[37:27] everything.
[37:31] Amen.
[37:32] See, when Christ sends out us as
[37:35] ambassadors, we'll go with the full
[37:38] resources and the full power of heaven
[37:41] behind us.
[37:43] For he's all sufficient and we'll go in
[37:46] Christ in Christ Jesus
[37:53] name. Here our prophet said this is a
[37:57] just a
[37:58] fantastic example of brother Bram
[38:01] mentioning how we will live as
[38:03] ambassadors. Harmony is now exists
[38:07] between the groom and his bride and he
[38:11] shows her his word of
[38:13] life. That's because she's connected to
[38:15] him. That's right. And she receives it.
[38:18] Now here's the secret.
[38:21] He gives his word to the bride as it was
[38:24] in Mary. And the bride has, you see, if
[38:27] you're connected, now that's the key.
[38:28] You got to be connected. You have to be
[38:31] a citizen. Yeah. And you have to be
[38:33] connected. You'll have the mind of
[38:35] Christ. And she'll know what he wants
[38:37] done with the word. And she performs the
[38:40] commandments of the word in his name.
[38:44] And she has thus saith the Lord. That's
[38:47] an ambassador. Yeah. for Christ.
[38:51] That's somebody that's not living with
[38:53] his own agenda. You know, you're not
[38:55] even living in the country you're born
[38:57] of. You're not even living the country
[38:59] you're a citizen of.
[39:02] Cuz you're a heavenly citizen. That's
[39:04] right. Amen. You have heavenly laws.
[39:08] That's right. Your heavenly laws
[39:10] overrule your earthly country you're
[39:12] living in. That's right. Amen. If you
[39:15] don't think they do, you need to reread
[39:17] the Bible. Because all the apostles and
[39:19] disciples in the Bible, their heavenly
[39:22] loss overruled all the governments of
[39:25] this earth. That's right. That's right.
[39:28] Every one of them.
[39:32] And those that are in the bride, those
[39:34] that are his ambassador will only do his
[39:37] will. And no one can make them do
[39:39] otherwise. Them are the only people
[39:42] Christ will send out for an ambassador.
[39:44] He ain't sending you to another country
[39:46] and not sure the decision you'll make on
[39:48] his behalf.
[39:52] He'll never send you. He'll know that
[39:54] before he sends you.
[39:58] And they'll have thus sayith the Lord or
[39:59] they'll keep still. And he did not and
[40:02] Christ did not complete all his work
[40:04] while he was on the earthly ministry.
[40:06] See, it wasn't the time yet.
[40:09] Come on now. But he does those works
[40:12] through you today. That's why you're the
[40:16] ambassador for Christ today. He does
[40:18] them through you. And for is not yet the
[40:21] time when he would have done them. And
[40:23] he'll fulfill all that's left to do
[40:27] until the end of time. That's right.
[40:30] Through a group of
[40:31] people that'll be ambassadors
[40:35] that'll be part connected to them.
[40:37] that'll be a citizen of heaven,
[40:40] that'll left their their own will for
[40:43] his will
[40:45] and obey
[40:47] directly his thoughts. Oh, God, help us
[40:50] to be one of those people. You know,
[40:52] it's good to be a citizen, but just just
[40:55] think of this, you know, on this earthly
[40:57] kingdom, if you get a job as an
[41:00] ambassador, you're highly esteemed.
[41:03] That's right. That's right. But that's
[41:06] what the bride of Christ is in the
[41:08] Bible. You're highly esteemed. You're
[41:10] already glorified.
[41:12] Those that he called, he already he
[41:14] filled and glorified. And and you're
[41:17] you're recognition in the world to
[41:20] standing that your voice represents
[41:23] somebody bigger than you.
[41:25] That's right. God help us. God, help us
[41:29] not to stop less than what he has
[41:31] planned for us.
[41:33] Philippians 2:5 and 11, he said, "Let
[41:36] this mind be in you which is in Christ
[41:38] Jesus." That's what'll
[41:41] qualify as being ambassadors who being
[41:44] in the form of God thought it not
[41:46] robbery to be equal with God. When your
[41:50] son is an ambassador for Christ and you
[41:53] qualify and he trusts you to be a
[41:57] testimony for his kingdom,
[42:00] he's making you equal. Your your voice
[42:03] is his voice. That's right. Your
[42:05] commandment is his commandment. What did
[42:08] he say to Moses in the Bible? He said,
[42:10] "Why cry to me? Speak.
[42:12] Speak and go forward. Speak this. Step
[42:15] aside.
[42:17] Angel, step aside." The bride of Christ,
[42:21] it's coming through.
[42:23] Hallelujah. But he made himself of no
[42:26] reputation and took upon himself the
[42:29] form of a servant and was made in the
[42:31] likeness of men. Being found in the
[42:33] fashion as men, he humbled himself and
[42:36] became obedient.
[42:39] That's another requirement of an
[42:41] ambassador. Obedient. Obedient. That's
[42:44] right. Even if they whip you like Paul,
[42:47] put you in jail and stocks. Yeah.
[42:50] Obedient unto death. even to death of
[42:54] the cross. Therefore, God has highly
[42:56] exalted him and given him a name above
[42:59] every name that at the name of Jesus
[43:01] every knee will bow and things that are
[43:03] in heaven and things that are in the
[43:05] earth, things that are under the earth.
[43:07] And every tongue will confess
[43:10] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[43:13] of God.
[43:15] God help us. Amen. to be one of these
[43:18] ambassadors
[43:20] in another country.
[43:24] Hallelujah.
[43:26] God needs it more than ever now. Yeah.
[43:29] As the world falls
[43:31] apart, there's one part that's not
[43:33] falling apart. Heaven and earth will
[43:36] pass away, but my word,
[43:39] thus sayeth the Lord, will never pass
[43:40] away.
[43:42] Amen. He's preparing a kingdom. We'll
[43:45] reign with him in the millennium for a
[43:47] thousand years. Yes.
[43:50] Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he
[43:54] said unto me, "My grace is sufficient
[43:56] for thee, for my strength is made
[43:59] perfect and your weakness, and most
[44:03] gladly, therefore, I will rather glory
[44:05] in my infirmities."
[44:08] See, you won't always be accepted in a
[44:10] foreign country.
[44:12] Come on.
[44:14] Amen.
[44:16] You're not a citizen of that country.
[44:18] You're an ambassador to that country.
[44:21] So, you have a different set of laws
[44:25] than that country that you're living in
[44:27] has.
[44:30] Amen.
[44:33] God help us.
[44:37] That the power of Christ may rest upon
[44:41] me. Amen. When God trusts you with his
[44:44] word, when God trusts you with thus
[44:47] sayaith the Lord, when God sends you out
[44:49] to a strange country and says, "You know
[44:53] my
[44:54] will, perform it."
[44:58] God help us.
[45:02] Hebrews
[45:03] 5 8 and
[45:06] N. Therefore,
[45:09] Jesus were a son and yet he learned
[45:13] obedience by the things that he
[45:17] suffered. Now, friends, we're living in
[45:20] a a time, a very unique time. The Bible
[45:24] says the Leoian age, the last age in
[45:27] Revelations. Yeah. And it's not a time
[45:31] of learning obedience by the things that
[45:32] you suffer. It's in an age where if you
[45:37] if it's something you want to do,
[45:40] everything
[45:41] goes. And there's no obedience to no
[45:44] inner voice. There's no obedience to the
[45:48] word of God. But see, even God himself,
[45:51] Jesus himself in the flesh body learned
[45:55] obedience. That's right.
[45:57] by the things that he suffered and being
[46:00] made perfect became the author of
[46:03] eternal
[46:04] salvation unto all them
[46:08] that would obey him.
[46:10] It was because of God, Christ obedience,
[46:17] you have to make a
[46:19] decision. Will I be an ambassador for
[46:22] God no matter what?
[46:26] It's a decision you'll make every day.
[46:29] That's right. Paul made it every day. He
[46:31] said, "I die daily." But Paul was into
[46:33] shipwrecks and prison and and you know,
[46:36] and all these things, wrongfully
[46:38] accused, whipped and beat. Yeah. Because
[46:41] he wasn't afraid
[46:43] to be an ambassador
[46:45] for
[46:47] Christ. And many things if we're going
[46:50] to suffer, most of us in our flesh body
[46:53] will take a second look
[46:55] at
[46:57] say because we're living in the age
[47:00] that'll go the least resistance.
[47:03] This will hurt me the least if I go
[47:06] here. Yeah. God's not looking for those
[47:09] kind of people. No, not at all. He never
[47:12] was.
[47:14] He was looking
[47:16] for sons and daughters
[47:20] that would obey regardless. Yes.
[47:24] Here our prophet says why does he stand?
[47:27] The reason in Revelations 81 17 and 18,
[47:31] he said, "If the children are hes and
[47:33] hes of God and joint hes with Christ,
[47:36] see, if we're a part of the heavenly
[47:39] kingdom, if we're citizens of heaven,
[47:42] then he can trust us to be
[47:45] ambassadors. And if so, then we'll
[47:47] suffer." Uh-oh.
[47:49] Yeah. You're going to suffer. Come on.
[47:51] You're going to suffer because you'll
[47:53] take the name of Christ. That's right.
[47:57] that ye may be also glorified with him.
[48:00] If you don't suffer for Christ, you'll
[48:02] never be glorified ever. You won't have
[48:04] to worry about the good parts. That's
[48:06] right. Come on. For I reckon that the
[48:08] suffering of this present time is not
[48:10] worthy to be compared to the glory that
[48:13] will be revealed in us. In us.
[48:18] God help us. Unless we suffer with him,
[48:21] we cannot be an ambassador for him. for
[48:25] we will suffer
[48:27] to reign. The reason is this that
[48:30] character is simply never made without
[48:33] suffering.
[48:35] Christ will always make sure that you
[48:37] have the character to handle the
[48:39] authority.
[48:43] Character is a victory, not a gift.
[48:49] Man without character can't reign
[48:51] because power apart from character is
[48:54] satanic.
[48:56] But power with
[48:58] character is fit to rule. And since he
[49:02] wants us to share even in his
[49:06] throne on the same basis that he
[49:08] overcame he sat down on his father's
[49:10] throne.
[49:12] Then we'll overcome and sit down with
[49:14] him on his throne.
[49:17] God, help us to be one of these people
[49:19] that God could send us
[49:23] out as ambassadors,
[49:26] trustworthy. Yes, sir.
[49:30] Be willing to suffer
[49:34] for Christ.
[49:38] It won't necessarily always be easy.
[49:42] We're not living in a Christian nation.
[49:45] No.
[49:46] Not even close.
[49:50] God has sent you to a heathen nation.
[49:52] That's right. To have the testimony of a
[49:55] heavenly kingdom. Amen. That'll never
[49:58] pass away.
[50:01] That's right.
[50:05] God help us.
[50:08] Who can he trust?
[50:12] You know, before he can send you out as
[50:14] an
[50:15] ambassador, God will give you the
[50:18] pressure
[50:19] test. That's right.
[50:23] Because everything God valued, he put
[50:25] under pressure. That's right.
[50:28] Diamonds, gold, silver, he buried deep.
[50:34] He put them under pressure. Yes. To see
[50:37] what they were made
[50:38] of. Yeah. Some just comes up as coal.
[50:44] But some comes up as diamonds.
[50:48] You got to be willing to take the
[50:50] pressure and suffer with Christ.
[50:53] And he's got to know that he'll never
[50:56] send you out as an ambassador if you got
[50:58] a wishy-washy character.
[51:02] He'll never send you out if you got a
[51:03] doubtful. If he's not sure how you'll
[51:06] stand That's right. under pressure.
[51:11] Amen. How will you stand if you're Paul
[51:15] that sent to prison unlawfully?
[51:19] See, Paul was a Roman. Yeah. Romans
[51:22] couldn't beat Romans without a without a
[51:24] trial. They couldn't whip him, put him
[51:27] in jail without a trial. Yeah. That's
[51:30] why when they let Paul loose, the
[51:31] authorities feared for their life
[51:35] because they didn't know Paul was one of
[51:36] them. Amen.
[51:39] Come on.
[51:41] Uh-huh. Amen.
[51:44] They fear for their life. That's why the
[51:46] Bible says, "Touch not my anointed."
[51:49] Yeah.
[51:51] You don't go around whipping God's
[51:53] ambassadors.
[51:55] Or you're not going to make out too
[51:57] well.
[52:00] Vicki, on my messenger, I have a picture
[52:03] of a little boy. It's It might be back
[52:05] three or four. It's a straight
[52:08] picture. I'd like you to put that
[52:11] up. It might not be as nice as your calf
[52:14] picture there,
[52:16] but on my Facebook Messenger, it might
[52:19] be back a half a dozen. I'm going to
[52:21] close with this
[52:23] story. And this story don't sound very
[52:28] inviting or encouraging until the very
[52:31] end.
[52:33] But God will send us through trials like
[52:36] this story
[52:38] to see what you're made of.
[52:42] This little boy was 6 years
[52:45] old when his parents took him to an
[52:50] orphanage.
[52:53] Amen. And the day that they took him is
[52:58] erected in his soul for all of eternity.
[53:04] See, sometimes when God sends you out as
[53:06] an ambassador to another country, you
[53:08] think God is whipping you. You think
[53:12] God's sending you to a terrible country
[53:15] as punishment.
[53:17] But like Job, he's sending you because
[53:19] he has full 100% confidence
[53:23] in your life. And he couldn't send
[53:26] nobody else
[53:28] but you. And you think he's putting you
[53:30] under pressure
[53:33] to be mean,
[53:35] but he's actually putting you under
[53:36] pressure cuz he knows you can take the
[53:38] heat. That's right.
[53:41] Don't misunderstand God.
[53:45] And it was erected in his soul. And he,
[53:47] you know, this little boy tells the
[53:48] story. He said, "My mom gave me the last
[53:50] tight height hug." And she said, "I'll
[53:53] soon be back for you, Jesus."
[53:57] And he said, "I stood there in front of
[53:59] the orphanage with a teddy bear and a
[54:02] backpack with two changes of
[54:05] clothes." You know, the Bible says that
[54:07] when you go out to foreign countries,
[54:09] don't even consider what you will speak
[54:11] because I will anoint you with the power
[54:14] of God and it'll come forth as oracles
[54:17] out of your mouth.
[54:19] When brother Bam said he would travel
[54:21] and speak to kings and authorities that
[54:23] they made ministers made fun of him and
[54:25] thought he had had a bad dream,
[54:28] mocked him.
[54:32] And he said, "Days turned into weeks
[54:36] and weeks turned into years
[54:39] and I never saw my
[54:41] mother
[54:43] again." And he said, "I noticed that all
[54:46] the other people in the
[54:49] orphanage got adopted out to new
[54:52] families and left with big smiles on
[54:54] their
[54:55] faces." You couldn't find my picture on
[54:59] Facebook Messenger. Oh, yeah. It's up
[55:01] there.
[55:04] Sorry. They all got adopted out, left
[55:07] with big
[55:08] pictures. But you know, the Bible says
[55:10] that you will be an oddball.
[55:13] Yes. and you'll be a peculiar people
[55:16] and nobody will adopt you.
[55:26] He said, "I stared at the ceiling
[55:28] thinking my parents were some kind of
[55:30] secret agents and would sometime return
[55:33] for me,
[55:35] but they never did." just just to see.
[55:39] He
[55:40] said, "I found that at the age of 13, I
[55:44] found myself spending time in the
[55:47] kitchen using leftover sugar and
[55:49] leftover cocoa making chocolate
[55:54] bars." And I would wrap up the paper and
[55:58] the people in the orphanage called me
[55:59] the candy
[56:01] kid. And I would sit at traffic lights
[56:05] and sell my chocolate bars that I
[56:10] made in the
[56:13] orphanage. He said, "The one time I was
[56:15] selling at the traffic light, a man
[56:18] wanted to know who had made it." And I
[56:19] said, "Oh, it was just me." He said,
[56:22] "I'll take 500 of them tomorrow for a
[56:25] business thing that I'm doing." And he
[56:27] said it was the first time I set up my
[56:29] business into a dismatic official
[56:33] registration of my business into and he
[56:36] said I reinvested all that money from
[56:37] the 500 chocolate bars into equipment to
[56:41] make candy
[56:43] bars. And he said when I become
[56:46] older I returned to the exact same
[56:49] neighborhood I was born
[56:52] heaven.
[56:57] And he said, "But this
[56:58] time when I returned, I returned with
[57:01] tears of
[57:03] joy. I had the sadness of how I had
[57:07] left." But he said, "I returned with the
[57:10] keys to a new home."
[57:13] He said, "I went and found my
[57:15] parents that were living in their own
[57:19] struggles and I handed them the
[57:22] keys to the
[57:29] home." And he said something that most
[57:32] of us haven't been able to do.
[57:35] He said,
[57:36] "Parents, I want to thank you." Yeah.
[57:39] For leaving me at the orphanage
[57:42] because that
[57:43] orphanage made me the man that I am
[57:48] today.
[57:50] Here's the keys
[57:52] to your home. You blessed me
[57:56] tremendously
[58:00] because you sent me
[58:04] through hardship.
[58:07] And we think because we get a little
[58:08] bump in the road in our spiritual walk
[58:11] that God's turned everything against us.
[58:13] Come on. And he's building you to the
[58:17] son and daughter that he can send out as
[58:21] ambassadors. That's right.
[58:23] with full trust
[58:26] with thus sayith the Lord
[58:30] with the keys of death and hell
[58:34] to Peter. Did he seem like the key
[58:37] person that you'd give the keys to death
[58:38] and hell to kingdom of heaven? the keys
[58:42] to the kingdom. It said it's all yours
[58:46] because of suffering.
[58:50] You become worthy to reign.
[58:54] God help us to understand God. Yeah, God
[58:59] will send things and and it's because he
[59:03] tremendously loves you
[59:05] and he's just making
[59:08] sure that you'll follow when other
[59:11] people truly do come against you and
[59:14] whip you on justly. Will you stand with
[59:17] the truth
[59:20] in a foreign country? Thank you, Lord.
[59:22] as my testimony
[59:25] as thus saith the Lord.
[59:30] I pray at some
[59:31] time God would trust us.
[59:35] I I pray he would. I would pray that we
[59:38] would come to a place. I believe we
[59:40] will.
[59:42] You know, you know, I want to say this.
[59:44] Brother Bam said this. You know, men
[59:46] aren't born men.
[59:49] When you get the baptism of the Holy
[59:51] Ghost, you're a baby.
[59:55] You're a baby.
[59:58] And you
[59:59] grow into adoption.
[1:00:02] You grow into the ability to be sent out
[1:00:06] as a
[1:00:07] trustworthy, completely committed
[1:00:10] ambassador.
[1:00:11] Here's my keys. Here's my checkbook. And
[1:00:15] here's exactly what I expect.
[1:00:18] And no problem. Your word is as good as
[1:00:22] God's. Yes. Oh, wow.
[1:00:27] Wow. I pray to God I'll come to that
[1:00:30] someday. I I I I humbly pray that God
[1:00:35] could trust me. Yes, Lord.
[1:00:39] To win souls for him, point people to
[1:00:42] Christ Jesus. And just what what would
[1:00:46] you know a good example in closing said
[1:00:49] what would Jesus do in this exact
[1:00:53] situation?
[1:01:02] Let's
[1:01:07] stand. Help me Jesus.
[1:01:14] Let's sing. Lord, my heart can grow so
[1:01:17] far away and go
[1:01:18] away. Lord, my high can
[1:01:23] grow so far away and
[1:01:29] anchor. And yet for me, your love, it's
[1:01:35] still the same.
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:52] My head bow down and pray. Grant your
[1:02:01] name.

[1:02:11] holy name.
