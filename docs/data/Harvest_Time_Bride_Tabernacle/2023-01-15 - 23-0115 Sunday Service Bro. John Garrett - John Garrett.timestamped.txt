[16:20] we didn't hear from Sister Patty I'm
[16:22] sure she's probably coming or manner
[16:25] maybe Ruth and brother Bernard sister
[16:28] Ruth but a different one just remember
[16:31] the ones we seen brother Jim this week
[16:35] and they're doing very good you know
[16:37] he'd be here if he had somebody watching
[16:38] sister Linda he was actually going to
[16:40] try and be here today in different ones
[16:42] brother John Blackman's doing well
[16:46] we actually realized some some positive
[16:50] things we're trying to
[16:52] get him to watch his services online and
[16:54] he's going to a service in the home but
[16:56] but uh we want to

[17:16] would you like to be picked up like once
[17:18] a month or

[17:21] something special

[17:31] Uganda God's just things are just coming
[17:34] together so beautifully and I know uh
[17:37] brother Jose is getting excited and
[17:39] different ones and uh just uh you know
[17:43] not that so much that we would have a
[17:45] good time but the presence of God would
[17:47] be Supernatural it's just amazing it'd
[17:51] be amazing man we'll sing this song and
[17:53] then we'll
[17:55] let our brother John come in
[17:58] you're welcome to sing it with us we're
[18:01] but you know the world don't see God's
[18:05] plan
[18:07] like God sees it amen and what God the
[18:10] what God called important the world
[18:12] called foolish you know the Bible says
[18:14] through the foolishness of preaching
[18:17] it's completely ridiculous it makes no
[18:19] sense at all
[18:20] but God would bring men to him
[18:23] amen and what man you know what the
[18:25] world sees is a little Lighthouse and
[18:27] small and insignificant and you're
[18:29] really not doing much for God
[18:31] says one soul
[18:34] one so I would have came for one
[18:37] ten thousand ten thousand worlds
[18:41] amen amen
[18:44] amen
[18:46] there's the lighthouse on the hillside
[18:51] that over looks like seeing and when I'm
[18:58] tossed it stands alive
[19:04] that I might see and I
[19:09] like that shines in darkness now we're
[19:14] safely lead me home if it was sinful
[19:21] that lighthouse
[19:24] the would say another mode and I
[19:30] thank God for the light of us
[19:38] [Music]
[19:44] the lighthouse
[19:46] and from the rocks
[19:53] [Music]
[19:59] I might clearly see
[20:02] if it was
[20:08] [Music]
[20:17] [Music]
[20:24] the big ships they don't say this way
[20:29] anymore and there's no use
[20:35] [Music]
[20:46] [Music]
[20:55] [Music]
[20:56] and I thank God for the lighthouse
[21:03] is
[21:04] [Music]
[21:16] [Music]
[22:00] [Music]
[22:07] around me
[22:10] that I might clearly see
[22:15] if it was
[22:18] [Music]
[22:27] amen thank you Lord Jesus so true I mean
[22:30] let's stand and
[22:32] we'll just invite our brother John to
[22:34] come maybe we'll sing only believe
[22:36] amen as their brother comes
[22:40] out of you just talking to Brother John
[22:42] just over breakfast I really find this
[22:45] is an amazing thought you know I only
[22:47] believe thinking of it is your god is as
[22:50] big as you have faith for him
[22:52] if you have a problem in your life and
[22:54] you say God can't do it he can't do it
[22:56] for you because you don't believe you
[22:57] can do it but if you have the faith to
[23:00] believe that he can do it that problem's
[23:02] a piece of cake to God it's it's not
[23:05] even he won't even get a strain or pull
[23:07] a sweat or nothing just if you would
[23:10] just only believe amen our Prophet
[23:12] taught aside
[23:13] the angel loved this song because you
[23:15] just had to believe God can do the
[23:18] impossible I could never do it
[23:21] God could do it
[23:23] [Music]
[23:44] foreign
[23:55] [Music]
[24:04] do you believe this morning
[24:07] God can do anything above and beyond
[24:10] anything that we can believe anything
[24:13] that we've ever experienced
[24:16] we just have to believe I
[24:21] uh in keeping in line with what
[24:24] brother Dale was saying our pastor
[24:27] I was just thinking you know a lot so
[24:29] many times we often think if I just had
[24:31] more of the Holy Ghost I just need more
[24:34] you know I would overcome or this would
[24:36] change if I just had more
[24:38] and and I was thinking about that you
[24:41] know when we say that we limit what God
[24:43] can do we're saying that one drop of the
[24:46] Holy Ghost is not enough to change your
[24:48] situation
[24:49] and it doesn't matter what gift you've
[24:53] been given how much of the Holy Ghost
[24:54] you have God can change your life he can
[24:57] change we can't place limits on God the
[25:00] the truth of the matter is is so many
[25:02] times
[25:03] thank you musicians
[25:05] um the truth of the matter is is so many
[25:07] times we limit what God can do with any
[25:09] amount of Holy Ghost he gives us by not
[25:11] yielding ourselves to his will and to
[25:13] his plan amen
[25:15] so I greet you all in the name of the
[25:16] Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be with
[25:18] you again this morning I certainly
[25:20] appreciate the uh the honor and the
[25:22] privilege to come and speak with you and
[25:24] share what's on my heart and I just pray
[25:26] that it's a blessing to you
[25:28] um I'm just going to take a very simple
[25:30] thought this morning so much so that I
[25:32] believe even our our young children
[25:34] should be able to follow along and
[25:36] understand
[25:37] and uh I just want to take my time and
[25:40] talk a little bit about forgiveness this
[25:42] morning
[25:44] um if you would turn with me to the to
[25:46] the gospel of Matthew in chapter 5 and I
[25:49] apologize up front if you're if you're
[25:51] going to put scriptures up on the screen
[25:54] I got a bunch of them so you don't
[25:55] don't feel bad if you can't catch them I
[25:57] won't have any you turn to all of them
[25:59] but we'll read read a few and I'll read
[26:02] quite a few we're going to start in
[26:04] Matthew chapter five and we're going to
[26:05] go to um
[26:06] verse 7. this is the the defining sermon
[26:11] of the ministry of Jesus Christ
[26:14] this is a Sermon on the Mount that's
[26:17] commonly referred to as the Beatitudes
[26:20] this uh this message that Jesus Christ
[26:23] gave is is the gospel it is it is a road
[26:28] map to the believer of what we should
[26:30] aspire to what what is possible in our
[26:33] lives uh and honestly I don't think we
[26:36] talk about it enough we we could never
[26:38] go wrong going over this or we'll start
[26:41] at uh verse 7 and Jesus says to the
[26:45] people there he says blessed are the
[26:46] merciful for they shall obtain Mercy
[26:49] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[26:51] shall see God blessed are the
[26:53] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[26:56] children of God
[26:57] blessed are they which are persecuted
[26:59] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[27:02] kingdom of heaven and blessed are ye
[27:04] when men shall revile you and persecute
[27:06] you and shall say all manner of evil
[27:08] against you falsely for my name's sake
[27:12] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[27:14] is your reward in heaven for so
[27:16] persecuted they the prophets which were
[27:19] before you
[27:21] amen let's just go to him in prayer once
[27:24] again this morning Father as we approach
[27:26] your word I pray Lord that you would
[27:28] reveal yourself to us
[27:30] Lord I pray that the kingdom that you
[27:34] preached about would come into our
[27:36] hearts and would be revealed through us
[27:39] Lord I pray that you would meet every
[27:42] need
[27:43] according to your riches in glory
[27:45] whether it be healing whether it be
[27:47] marital whether it be Financial Lord we
[27:50] we know that you are the god of the the
[27:52] impossible that you can do anything
[27:55] Lord we ask humbly that you would
[27:57] forgive us our
[27:59] our faults and our sins Lord we we
[28:02] humbly admit that we don't get it right
[28:05] so many times we miss the mark
[28:08] and Lord we just we present ourselves
[28:10] before you claiming the blood of Jesus
[28:13] Christ this morning to cover us Lord may
[28:15] you look upon the shed blood of your son
[28:18] and see that and not our sin humbly Lord
[28:21] we ask that you would help us to to move
[28:23] forward and in a way that pleases you in
[28:26] every area of our life
[28:28] Lord Deliver Us from temptation
[28:32] Lord in this world where the there's so
[28:36] many voices Lord may we hear your voice
[28:39] above all others
[28:42] Deliver Us Lord we pray
[28:44] for yours is the Kingdom and The Glory
[28:46] forever amen
[28:48] amen you can have your your seats this
[28:51] morning thank you
[28:52] once again for having me I I sure
[28:55] appreciate it you know
[28:57] um
[28:59] we just uh we love and appreciate you
[29:01] all and we've been friends for such a
[29:04] long time
[29:05] uh that it always feels like coming home
[29:08] when we're here and it is coming home in
[29:11] so many ways because
[29:13] um uh you know we're family
[29:15] you know we might come from uh different
[29:19] parts of the world different countries
[29:20] different nations but uh we're family
[29:23] you know one time
[29:25] they asked Jesus you know who is my
[29:28] neighbor you know and he said the people
[29:31] that are around you and these are the
[29:34] people that I want to surround myself
[29:35] with
[29:36] Amos I just want to like I said talk a
[29:38] little bit today about forgiveness you
[29:40] know um in the the the scripture we just
[29:45] read in Matthew chapter five there are
[29:47] two things I'd like to pull out of there
[29:48] today and and the first is uh blessed
[29:52] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[29:54] mercy and the second is blessed are the
[29:56] peacemakers for they shall be called
[29:58] sons of God and there's two there's
[30:00] there's one thing that that links these
[30:02] two verses together and it is the idea
[30:05] or the concept of forgiveness
[30:07] and um
[30:11] I find that forgiveness is one of the
[30:13] most difficult things for for the
[30:15] believer for anybody really uh to do
[30:18] it's it's it's hard it's not natural to
[30:21] Simply forgive you know many times we
[30:23] say we we've forgiven somebody or you
[30:26] know we've gone past it but um
[30:29] so many times we rehearse these things
[30:31] in our mind the hurts that we've gone to
[30:33] the things that we've we've experienced
[30:35] and and and forgiveness is is so much
[30:38] deeper than just saying you know I I'm
[30:40] not going to hold it against that person
[30:41] or I'm not going to let it go and I
[30:43] think by the Lord's uh Grace this
[30:45] morning we can maybe uh deepen our
[30:47] understanding of it
[30:49] um
[30:50] I I don't know why people don't preach
[30:52] on the Beatitudes more I I really don't
[30:54] you know people especially in the
[30:56] message we're used to hearing about the
[30:58] stature of a perfect man you know and
[31:00] Peter's words that he gave us but within
[31:03] the the Beatitudes I think we find a uh
[31:06] a clear picture of of not not just
[31:10] brotherly love and kindness and charity
[31:12] and Faith and Hope but we find something
[31:14] that's so deep that that speaks to every
[31:18] aspect every area of our life and then
[31:19] there then then Jesus goes on and tells
[31:21] us there's a blessing if you do this you
[31:23] there's you will be blessed and so I
[31:26] like that and I wish more people
[31:27] preached I was thinking about it and I
[31:30] I've been in the message for about 25
[31:32] years now
[31:34] and I cannot honestly recall one time
[31:36] where I've sat in a sermon and uh heard
[31:40] a message Minister preached on the
[31:42] Beatitudes
[31:43] and I I uh that's not a condemnation of
[31:46] anybody maybe people just think they
[31:48] can't improve on what Jesus said and you
[31:50] certainly can't but um to me it's uh the
[31:54] longer the longer I uh
[31:57] I I'm in the word the more I'm in the
[31:59] word the more I'm growing the more my
[32:02] the spirit points me back to the words
[32:04] of Jesus in the attitudes and the The
[32:07] Compassion that he had for others and I
[32:10] love the Mysteries and I love the Deep
[32:12] things of God and and I especially love
[32:14] it when somebody who's you know a
[32:16] teacher more so than me for sure
[32:18] preaches it because I really enjoy it
[32:21] but I'm I'm I find myself being drawn
[32:23] more and more to the simple things that
[32:26] speak to our everyday and common lives
[32:28] and and in the in the Beatitudes we
[32:31] didn't read them all but we find such a
[32:33] depth of character that we we should all
[32:35] aspire to and we find a description I
[32:39] think of what uh Jesus said that his the
[32:43] people of his kingdom would be like you
[32:45] know if you want to find the people of
[32:47] God you find the people who are Meek you
[32:49] find the people who are peacemakers and
[32:52] there you'll find God
[32:54] and so uh just pulling this morning a
[32:57] little bit about uh the merciful and the
[33:00] peacemakers and I want to try to link
[33:01] them together with the with forgiveness
[33:03] so you bear with me as I build a
[33:05] foundation for this but um
[33:08] the mercy is always associated with
[33:11] forgiveness and withholding punishment
[33:14] in Psalms 51 David writes he says have
[33:18] mercy upon me o God according to the
[33:20] love and kindness according unto the
[33:22] multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out
[33:24] my transgressions
[33:26] mercy and compassion go hand in hand and
[33:30] mercy is the fruit of compassion
[33:32] and I say that because uh
[33:36] to be merciful it means that you are in
[33:39] a position of of authority a position of
[33:42] power right you cannot be cannot be
[33:45] merciful to somebody unless you are
[33:47] above them in some way now I don't mean
[33:49] like we're better than somebody or or
[33:52] anything like that but what the thing is
[33:53] is that when you are in a position of
[33:56] authority you are able to be merciful to
[33:59] people who do not deserve Mercy who do
[34:02] not deserve that they they deserve
[34:04] justice then you are able to give mercy
[34:06] and say I'm withholding Justice and that
[34:09] that's that's what God has done for us
[34:11] he he in a position of authority and
[34:13] power we have transgressed as law we
[34:15] deserve punishment we deserve the cross
[34:18] ourselves but he says no and gives Mercy
[34:22] the dictionary says Mercy is a noun uh
[34:26] it defines it as a mission performed to
[34:28] alleviate suffering it's a an event to
[34:32] be grateful for
[34:34] um but I would say so much so that acts
[34:37] of Mercy are are defining of those who
[34:41] follow him and he's you might say well
[34:42] John I'm not in a position of authority
[34:45] but the truth is is that you are each
[34:47] believer We Stand upon the authority of
[34:50] the of God's word and we have the power
[34:53] to give mercy and just become dispensers
[34:56] of Mercy especially to those who have
[34:58] wronged us the people that have heard us
[35:01] that we are in a we're no better than
[35:04] them we're no no you know not higher
[35:06] than them but because we stand upon
[35:08] God's word we're given a position of
[35:10] authority and power the Bible says
[35:12] whatsoever you bind on Earth will be
[35:14] bound in heaven whatsoever you loose on
[35:16] Earth will be loosed in heaven so we are
[35:18] giving power to to forgive and to have
[35:21] mercy upon others
[35:23] now in in legal terms Mercy refers to
[35:26] compassionate Behavior such as when a
[35:29] judge shows leniency or clemency
[35:32] this is with Grace compassion and
[35:34] tenderness and but I would say that
[35:36] Mercy is a gift given to someone who is
[35:40] suffering by someone acting with
[35:42] compassion
[35:43] and I'd ask you to keep that in mind
[35:45] because we'll come back to it to it
[35:47] later because many times we think of
[35:49] Acts of Mercy as as some Grand idea of
[35:52] some Grand gesture
[35:53] but the thing is is that when you give
[35:55] when you give Mercy when you give
[35:58] forgiveness it comes number one it comes
[36:01] from that position of influence that
[36:02] position of authority
[36:04] but it it acts in such a gentle way
[36:09] there's a gentleness that comes with
[36:10] Mercy that is like the gentleness of of
[36:13] the dove of the Holy Spirit the
[36:15] gentleness of Jesus Christ
[36:17] and mercy what it does is it makes room
[36:20] for others it makes room for
[36:22] reconciliation it makes room for peace
[36:25] it makes room for for people to come
[36:27] together and unite because we're not
[36:29] holding one another Hostage to our past
[36:32] hurts and our past wrongs that we're
[36:34] able to move past those things amen
[36:38] you know sometimes Mercy is simple and
[36:41] sometimes it means you know not
[36:42] complaining at the restaurant when you
[36:44] get bad service
[36:45] sometimes it means uh
[36:49] correcting someone you know and and
[36:52] doing it in in a way that's not coming
[36:54] from a uh well I'm better than you or I
[36:56] know more than you you know and I
[36:59] um you know I always pray that if I
[37:00] would say something that's out of line
[37:02] that that the the pastor or another
[37:04] Minister would come and correct me and
[37:06] say well brother John you know the you
[37:08] know maybe think about it this way
[37:10] uh you know and we have to be be willing
[37:13] for that type of Correction sometimes
[37:15] Mercy means you know you don't make it
[37:17] difficult for the person who's offended
[37:19] you to apologize
[37:21] sometimes you uh you have to take a step
[37:23] forward in the other direction amen
[37:26] in the book of in the Gospel Matthew
[37:28] just a little ways away in in chapter 18
[37:31] we'll get to it in a few minutes
[37:33] uh Jesus tells the story of an
[37:35] unforgiving servant who was a receiver
[37:38] of mercy and then failed to extend it to
[37:40] to people uh that owed him we'll get to
[37:44] in a minute but I want to I want to
[37:46] capitalize on this for just a moment
[37:48] that the extent to which we receive
[37:51] Mercy is the same extent to which we
[37:54] should freely give it we have been given
[37:56] much mercy and much grace and so we
[37:58] should be able to freely give it to
[38:00] others
[38:01] and I think one of the best definitions
[38:03] of Mercy that I've ever heard is is that
[38:07] somebody is you're standing before
[38:09] somebody who needs punishment and
[38:11] instead of punishing them you throw them
[38:13] a party instead
[38:14] that's that's Mercy when somebody
[38:17] deserves absolutely 100 percent deserves
[38:20] punishment and you turn around and you
[38:23] do good for them and you bless them and
[38:25] you know unfortunately that's the thing
[38:27] that's in many of our Lives you've all
[38:28] experienced it we have all experienced
[38:30] it where people have heard us
[38:32] undeservedly done things against us said
[38:34] things about us and yet the spirit of
[38:37] Christ and the spirit of reconciliation
[38:39] the spirit of Mercy says I forgive you
[38:41] it's all right sometimes it means giving
[38:43] a person an opportunity to hurt you
[38:45] again
[38:47] think about it
[38:49] that you know a person has said
[38:51] something evil against you said
[38:53] something and yet a spirit of compassion
[38:56] a spirit of Mercy moves you towards them
[38:58] and says
[38:59] I'll offer you trust again I'll love you
[39:02] anyway despite this
[39:04] now I don't mean that you stay in
[39:06] abusive situations certainly not
[39:09] and and you know at some point you do
[39:12] have to walk away from some people but
[39:14] the spirit of Mercy says you walk away
[39:17] from them in the right manner that
[39:19] you've done everything that you can do
[39:20] to reconcile you've done everything that
[39:22] you can do to bridge the gap between you
[39:25] and that other person this hurts you
[39:28] um in in the book of Ephesians Paul says
[39:31] this he says with all low lilist
[39:33] lowliness and meekness with
[39:35] long-suffering for Bear one another in
[39:38] love
[39:39] and I think sometimes that's so
[39:42] difficult for us to do because in our
[39:44] human nature we want to respond to hurts
[39:47] we want to respond to the things that
[39:49] people say about us or the things that
[39:51] you know when people take advantage of
[39:52] us because we have a sense of justice
[39:56] but you know the thing about the
[39:57] merciful is the merciful or patient with
[40:01] the faults of others there's patience
[40:03] that comes with it and you realize I
[40:05] think at some point you come in in your
[40:07] Christian walk and you realize not
[40:09] everybody's on the same level
[40:10] not everybody has the same depth of
[40:12] understanding not everybody has made it
[40:14] through the steps to understand the the
[40:17] power of forgiveness the power of
[40:20] compassion and and you have to bear with
[40:22] people you have to you have to
[40:24] understand that and meet them where
[40:26] they're at
[40:27] you know and
[40:29] um you know people we get taken
[40:31] advantage of people you know uh they say
[40:33] things about us They
[40:36] you know I I often you know I think
[40:39] about this you know I've preached them
[40:40] in many places
[40:42] um from from the jungles to you know
[40:45] nice churches like this and and uh I
[40:48] always say well you know you did okay if
[40:50] you get you get invited back you know
[40:52] you know that people you know maybe
[40:54] saying God bless you that was a great
[40:56] sermon on your way out the door but if
[40:58] they don't invite you back you know
[40:59] there was something they didn't quite
[41:01] agree with and I'm just the type of
[41:02] person you know I'm just I I'm just I am
[41:05] what I am you know I'm like Popeye the
[41:06] Sailor Man you know I'm what you see is
[41:09] what you get and um you know sometimes
[41:11] that's abrasive to people
[41:13] um but there's been plenty of places
[41:15] I've preached at that haven't invited me
[41:17] back you know and and that's all right
[41:20] you know you just think sometimes uh
[41:22] well you know uh
[41:24] well praise the Lord we're all in
[41:26] together anyhow you know and and uh you
[41:28] know just pray that God will be with
[41:30] them and and you don't take offense at
[41:32] it but
[41:33] uh many many times I think you know
[41:37] uh people invite you to preach somewhere
[41:39] because they uh or a fellowship because
[41:42] they you know by association they're
[41:44] like it's a A
[41:47] legitimization or a you know an approval
[41:51] of this ministry or this gift and so you
[41:53] know sometimes you got to be a little
[41:54] bit careful but you know I've never
[41:55] turned down an opportunity to preach
[41:57] anywhere
[41:58] and um you know I've had I've had people
[42:00] tell me it's like well you shouldn't you
[42:02] shouldn't do this or you shouldn't maybe
[42:04] you know think about what uh where
[42:06] you're preaching at because uh you know
[42:07] you got to protect your gift
[42:09] and
[42:11] I I couldn't disagree with that more I I
[42:13] really just I can't I understand the
[42:16] concept of of protecting yourself by you
[42:19] know from Association but you know what
[42:20] Jesus preached everywhere he talked to
[42:24] everyone and he wasn't he wasn't
[42:26] somebody who was a respecter of persons
[42:29] that said well I can only go here or I
[42:31] can only I can only preach on a Sunday
[42:33] you know there's there's some ministers
[42:35] that won't go unless they can preach on
[42:37] a Sunday you know there's there's
[42:39] well let me get back on my notes Here
[42:44] last
[42:45] when we consider the the Staggering debt
[42:49] that Jesus forgave for us
[42:52] and the
[42:54] smallness
[42:55] of the debts others have towards us
[42:59] it's it's simply ungracious for us to
[43:02] not forgive them
[43:04] when God has done so much for us
[43:07] that we would we would not forgive
[43:09] others is is beyond comprehension let me
[43:13] play for you uh
[43:15] a clip from the prophet here I'm going
[43:17] to hold this up so hopefully the
[43:18] microphone catches it let me know right
[43:20] away if you can't hear this
[43:22] brother Branham talking here
[43:27] [Music]
[43:30] with purple stuff on her lips and her
[43:34] toenails painted the same way the little
[43:35] pair of these little lambara clothes and
[43:38] a poor old thing or hide hanging down
[43:40] like this on her arms
[43:43] arms so I guess we should paint him with
[43:45] a hair that was colored blue and I
[43:48] looked and I thought oh my two old man
[43:49] sat there in his summertime one of the
[43:51] big army Overcoat on a scarf hanging
[43:53] down like this saying that poor lady
[43:55] with a beer
[43:57] and one of them looked up and see
[43:59] everything you think the rain will hurt
[44:02] ourselves went to the rest
[44:04] room and I stood there I said God you
[44:06] and your Holiness how could you ever
[44:08] stand to look at that when it kills me
[44:09] to look at I said why don't you scrap
[44:12] the thing off the Earth
[44:13] don't let it you're no longer I said my
[44:15] little Sarah Rebecca there had to be
[44:17] raised up and such as that I said God
[44:19] strike it from the earth you're holy how
[44:20] can you do it something said to me get
[44:22] behind the door I went back behind the
[44:24] door stood there I'll wait a little bit
[44:26] of vision come I saw a world turning
[44:29] and around the world was a myth
[44:31] that looked like blood spraying around
[44:34] and I looked in there there I was doing
[44:37] things wrong every time I do something
[44:39] wrong my sins and start before God and
[44:41] God would slay me for it but Jesus is
[44:44] standing there like a broker he'd call
[44:46] it
[44:47] I'd see the tears run down his cheeks
[44:49] and I do something else bad is right but
[44:53] hold it keep it from from touching me
[44:55] from killing me God would kill me the
[44:57] daily the other day you die and I'll
[44:59] look at it and then the vision I went up
[45:01] to him I said Lord I'm ashamed of myself
[45:03] they'll leave my book laying there at
[45:05] all kinds of evil Rhode Island I said
[45:07] will you forgive me Lord did I put you
[45:08] in that condition that my sins cause you
[45:11] to have to die for me all I am please
[45:13] forgive me for my sins I won't do that
[45:15] no more you reach back tapped his hand
[45:17] like this and wrote across the book with
[45:19] his own blood pardon throw the door
[45:21] behind him then he did he opened up a
[45:23] new book I said Thank You Lord I'll do
[45:26] anything you tell me to do I love you
[45:28] Lord Jesus he said now I freely forgive
[45:31] you for all that you've done and then he
[45:33] turned and I've seen the woman said but
[45:35] you want to strike her off the face of
[45:37] the Earth
[45:38] oh I felt about that being I said
[45:41] forgive me Lord when the vision left me
[45:43] I walked out to the little table where
[45:45] she was at and I said how do you do and
[45:47] she looked up she was half drunk she
[45:49] hiccup the couple times said oh hell on
[45:51] and I said may I sit down she said thank
[45:54] you I have company I said I didn't mean
[45:56] it in that way I just hate to say a word
[45:58] to you and she said say on and I sat
[46:01] down I said how long you've been leading
[46:02] this life
[46:04] she looked over at me and poor old thing
[46:06] and I thought mine no matter what how
[46:09] what she's went through and I told her
[46:11] what happened I said you pardon me she
[46:14] said are you that Minister down here Mr
[46:16] Brandon this is I said I am
[46:22] she said sir
[46:24] she said my husband was a preacher
[46:28] she said
[46:30] after he is dead I have two girls
[46:33] they're Sunday school teachers both of
[46:35] them and she told me the story what
[46:37] happened the way she's leading she said
[46:38] I'm past hope I said no you're not no
[46:40] you're not
[46:41] she said I want to straighten up but she
[46:43] said I have no place to start I said
[46:45] what right now God showed me behind the
[46:47] door that Vision there we want to strike
[46:49] you open he said he forgive me and I
[46:52] want to condemn you ladies forgive me
[46:54] there she took a hold of my hands I let
[46:56] her right out of them little shorts on
[46:58] right in the middle of that floor like I
[47:00] didn't knelt down and we had a real
[47:01] prayer meeting there when I got two
[47:03] people were crying walk around there
[47:06] okay well
[47:10] wow wow
[47:11] so many times in in our humanist
[47:15] we look at others
[47:18] and we we somehow put ourselves above
[47:21] them
[47:24] you know and I I understand that
[47:26] sometimes
[47:27] when we're when we deal with people who
[47:30] know truth and they they they know God
[47:33] in
[47:34] they still hurt us you know like
[47:36] sometimes we think to ourselves
[47:38] you know but that person is a Christian
[47:41] you know that person is a Believer you
[47:43] know and so we want to have less Grace
[47:45] for them because they know truth
[47:49] but the truth of the matter is is that
[47:52] those are the people we should have the
[47:54] most Grace for
[47:56] those are the people that we should have
[47:57] the most understanding the most
[47:59] compassion for that
[48:01] they're not as far along the track as
[48:03] they ought to be uh
[48:04] and we ought to pray for those people
[48:07] Paul tells us in Ephesians 4 and 32 he
[48:10] says Be Kind one to another
[48:13] that's not being kind to the world
[48:15] that's not being kind to the uh
[48:18] people necessarily that you run into but
[48:21] he's talking about the church be kind
[48:24] one to another tenderhearted forgiving
[48:25] one another even as God for Christ's
[48:28] sake has forgiven you
[48:30] in Colossians he says
[48:33] in chapter 3 and verse 13 He says
[48:35] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[48:37] another If any man have a quarrel
[48:39] against you even as Christ forgave you
[48:42] so also do ye
[48:45] you see God offers us forgiveness even
[48:48] when we don't ask for it he waits on us
[48:50] and he doesn't treat us any different
[48:52] because he doesn't remember our sin
[48:55] he treats us from with love despite what
[48:57] we do before we ask for forgiveness he
[49:00] doesn't change his thoughts about us he
[49:02] doesn't change his opinion of us
[49:04] in the in the book of Hebrews in chapter
[49:07] 10 he says and their sins and iniquities
[49:10] will I remember no more
[49:14] you see he doesn't even see it that
[49:16] bumper of blood that that brother
[49:18] Branham spoke of protects us when we
[49:22] deserve death when we deserve judgment
[49:24] when we deserve justice
[49:27] he says no
[49:30] Micah the prophet he said who is a god
[49:35] like unto thee that part of iniquity and
[49:38] passes by the transgression of the
[49:40] remnant of his heritage
[49:43] who is a God Like thee that pardoneth
[49:46] iniquity that iniquity means who knows
[49:49] to do good and and does it not that's
[49:51] iniquity
[49:53] he pardons it and passes by the
[49:56] transgression of the remnant of his
[49:57] Heritage he retaineth not his anger
[50:00] forever because he delighteth in Mercy
[50:03] he will turn again and he will have
[50:05] compassion upon us
[50:07] he will he will subdue our iniquity
[50:15] think about that
[50:17] that when when you know that you have a
[50:20] besetting sin when you know that you
[50:21] have a problem when you know that you
[50:23] have uh something in your life that you
[50:26] just can't shake God says I will subdue
[50:31] it I will take care of it
[50:35] he says and he will cast their sins into
[50:38] the depths of the sea I just love it
[50:41] oh you know we said we talk about the
[50:44] Sea of of forgetfulness and that's where
[50:46] the idea comes from from Micah and he
[50:50] and he says that all of it's cast into
[50:52] the depths of the sea and it'll be
[50:54] remembered no more
[50:56] I praise God because forgiveness for me
[50:59] doesn't always come naturally it doesn't
[51:01] always come easily many times you know
[51:03] in the the places that I've been hurt
[51:06] you know I I I feel like justice should
[51:09] be served I feel like you know uh I
[51:12] didn't deserve that I didn't deserve to
[51:14] be spoken wrongly if I didn't deserve to
[51:16] be taken advantage of
[51:18] you know and I I want to go back to the
[51:20] law of Moses where it says if a man
[51:23] causes a blemish in his neighbor as he
[51:25] has done so it shall be done to him
[51:26] breach for breach eye for eye tooth for
[51:29] tooth
[51:30] and that's Justice
[51:33] a wrong for not a wrong an eye for an
[51:36] eye
[51:37] but that's not the spirit of Christ
[51:40] it's the justice of God to hand out not
[51:43] the not our Justice
[51:45] Peter
[51:47] famously asked Jesus he said
[51:50] Lord how off shall my brother sin
[51:52] against me and I forgive him till seven
[51:55] times
[51:56] and Jesus said unto him I say not unto
[51:58] thee until seven times but until Seventy
[52:01] Times Seven
[52:03] and see there's it's not the number you
[52:06] know it wasn't the number that we're
[52:07] counting until we reached 70 times 7 but
[52:09] but it's the spirit of forgiveness that
[52:11] we are always going to forgive those who
[52:15] have done us wrong we're not going to
[52:17] hold things against them and this is the
[52:19] forgiveness and Jesus's response is the
[52:22] Forgiveness of the father
[52:25] uh
[52:27] the parable I mentioned just a few
[52:29] moments ago I'll go ahead and read it
[52:30] Matthew 18. Jesus tells this Parable he
[52:33] says therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven
[52:35] likened unto a servant or unto a certain
[52:37] King which would take account of his
[52:39] servants and I think this this Parable
[52:41] goes so beautifully with the uh the clip
[52:43] of brother random that we just listened
[52:45] to and when he had begun to reckon one
[52:47] was brought unto him which owed him ten
[52:49] thousand talents and for as much as he
[52:52] had not to pay the Lord commanded him to
[52:54] be sold and his wife and his children
[52:55] all that he had and payment to be made
[52:58] and the servant fell down and worshiped
[53:00] him saying Lord have patience with me
[53:02] and I will pay thee all and the Lord
[53:04] that servant was moved with compassion
[53:06] and loosed him and forgave him the debt
[53:08] the same servant went out and found one
[53:11] of his fellow servants which owed him a
[53:12] hundred Pence and he laid hands on him
[53:15] and took him by the throat saying pay me
[53:17] what thou host
[53:18] you know so many times I I find I find
[53:22] myself in my human nature that that's my
[53:24] reaction when somebody has hurt me when
[53:27] somebody's done me wrong is I want to go
[53:29] and take them by the throat and say you
[53:32] know you're wrong it's not it's not I
[53:35] don't want to take them by the shoulders
[53:36] and hug them and forgive them
[53:38] and I pray Lord help me
[53:41] amen but
[53:43] uh
[53:44] the his fellow servant fell down on his
[53:47] feet and besought him saying have
[53:48] patience with me and I will pay thee all
[53:51] and he would not but he went and he cast
[53:53] him into prison until he should pay his
[53:54] debt when his fellow servants saw what
[53:57] was done you see people watch us
[54:00] people watch us and see what we're doing
[54:03] you know there's nothing that we we do
[54:04] that is hid in a corner
[54:06] everything will be brought to the light
[54:08] especially if you're a child of God you
[54:10] can't you can't go around doing the
[54:12] wrong thing it'll catch up with you God
[54:14] will God will bring a recompense if you
[54:17] do the wrong things to bring you back in
[54:19] line with his word
[54:20] you can go a long time you can go an
[54:23] awful long time in in doing the wrong
[54:25] thing but at some point God will bring
[54:27] it bring you back into line and I you
[54:30] don't want to get spanked by the Lord
[54:31] uh then as Lord after he called unto him
[54:34] said oh thou Wicked servant I forgave
[54:36] thee all that debt because thou desires
[54:38] me should us not thou also have had
[54:41] compassion on thy fellow servant even as
[54:43] I had pity on thee and his Lord was
[54:45] angry his Roth and he delivered into the
[54:48] tormentors till he should pay all that
[54:50] was doing
[54:51] and then Jesus says so likewise shall my
[54:54] heavenly father do also unto you if ye
[54:58] from your hearts forgive not everyone
[55:01] his brother their trespasses
[55:05] notice it needs to be from the heart
[55:07] that forgiveness has to come from the
[55:09] heart forgiveness can't be just lip
[55:11] service and you know you know in
[55:14] yourself when you're you're forgiving
[55:15] with lip service because it all gets
[55:18] rehearsed in your head every time you go
[55:20] to bed you wake up and you think about
[55:21] things
[55:23] uh in The Book of Leviticus in chapter
[55:25] 19 it says Thou shalt not hate thy
[55:28] brother in thine heart Thou shalt in any
[55:31] wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer
[55:34] sin upon him thou shall not avenge nor
[55:37] bear any grudge against the children of
[55:40] thy people
[55:41] but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[55:43] thyself
[55:46] now maybe today I'm talking to people
[55:48] who don't have a problem with this maybe
[55:50] today you know I'm I'm preaching more at
[55:53] myself as I was I was talking to to our
[55:55] pastor on the on the trip here to church
[55:57] you know I I
[55:59] or maybe it was at breakfast this
[56:01] morning you know I told him I said you
[56:02] know I'm in a situation with somebody
[56:04] and I know that eventually
[56:07] we're going to part ways I I know that I
[56:11] but I said you know right now there's
[56:13] something between us and I said before
[56:15] we part ways I want us to be reconciled
[56:18] you know I don't want to part ways under
[56:20] under uh bad feelings towards one
[56:23] another or you know and my prayer is
[56:25] Lord you know in every situation don't
[56:28] ever let me part ways with somebody one
[56:31] of your children without being just as
[56:33] as right with that person as I can be
[56:36] you know because I believe that Jesus is
[56:39] most concerned with our Inner Man
[56:41] you know he he's interested in our heart
[56:44] he's interested in the condition of our
[56:46] heart and the spirit we have and his
[56:48] kingdom is a Kingdom built upon
[56:50] forgiveness
[56:51] from the if you read the Bible it is
[56:54] from the time where uh the sin and the
[56:58] fall original fall everything is built
[57:00] to forgiveness to forgiveness of of as
[57:03] many as could be saved as many you know
[57:06] and so why would we withhold forgiveness
[57:08] if anything if there should be any
[57:11] Hallmark of the Christian experience it
[57:13] should be our willingness to forgive
[57:15] others what they have done to us
[57:17] like I said so many times though
[57:19] unfortunately forgiveness doesn't come
[57:21] easy uh more often than not it doesn't
[57:24] come completely or fully
[57:28] many times we we forgive but we hold the
[57:32] hurt in our hearts
[57:34] and the next time that person offends us
[57:36] we we go back through the litany well
[57:38] they did this and they did that and
[57:40] they've done this and you know and it's
[57:42] just this is all adding up
[57:43] you know and we hear the the phrase
[57:45] forgive and forget
[57:47] and unfortunately I don't think that
[57:49] forgiveness and and forgetting are are
[57:52] necessarily I don't think it's possible
[57:55] necessarily to forget unless you got bad
[57:56] memory
[57:57] you know we're always going to remember
[58:00] what someone has done
[58:02] it we shouldn't feel like you have to
[58:05] forget like oh if I don't forget I'm a
[58:08] bad person because the things that we
[58:11] endure the the experiences that we have
[58:13] where where we are hurt are one of the
[58:16] greatest tools for molding our character
[58:18] you would not be the person you are
[58:21] today without the hurt and pain that
[58:24] you've went through in the past
[58:28] you would not be the person that you are
[58:30] today if you didn't forgive yourself
[58:34] of the hurt that you've caused others
[58:37] and if you've gone through life up to
[58:39] now thinking that you've never hurt
[58:41] anyone
[58:42] if you've gone through life up to now
[58:44] and it never occurred to you that at
[58:46] some point
[58:47] I might be the problem in this
[58:50] relationship
[58:51] then I I humbly say
[58:55] you're wrong
[58:58] I don't I don't I don't know your lives
[59:02] but there is not one of us who has never
[59:04] caused defense to another
[59:06] there's not one of us who has who has
[59:08] never crushed the spirit of her child I
[59:11] I tell you what I
[59:13] it is it is heartbreaking to me and I
[59:16] see my son 10 years old right
[59:18] and
[59:20] I I speak she he so sometimes he's so
[59:23] very sensitive in his spirit and I speak
[59:24] a little bit too sharply to him and I
[59:27] see this look cross his face
[59:29] and it's it's hurt
[59:33] and you know I it breaks my heart you
[59:36] know that I did that and I and I you
[59:39] know quick to try to apologize and to
[59:42] say oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to say it
[59:43] that sharp
[59:45] but there's been plenty of times in the
[59:47] past where I've said things
[59:49] to to my other children or to my wife
[59:52] and I didn't realize that I was the
[59:54] problem
[59:55] and there's many times that we do things
[59:57] and we think that well you know I was
[59:59] right I was justified in my anger I was
[1:00:01] justified in speaking sharply because
[1:00:03] they should have known better I was I'm
[1:00:05] justified in treating this person this
[1:00:07] way
[1:00:08] because I'm in the position of authority
[1:00:11] and so that I can dispense Justice
[1:00:14] instead of being merciful
[1:00:18] because Mercy says
[1:00:20] I'm in a position of power and authority
[1:00:23] I'm not going to take you to task I'm
[1:00:25] not going to hold you to account I'm not
[1:00:27] going to keep this against you
[1:00:30] and so
[1:00:31] we learn by the things that we suffer
[1:00:33] just as Jesus did
[1:00:36] you know we're we go through life we're
[1:00:38] going to be hurt
[1:00:40] but we have to learn to move past that
[1:00:42] we have to learn to move past
[1:00:44] the hurt that we've caused others and
[1:00:46] for forgive ourselves
[1:00:48] we're certainly not the person that we
[1:00:51] want to be you know but hopefully as we
[1:00:53] we walk with the Lord that we're not the
[1:00:55] person we we were five years ago
[1:00:58] and it's a shame sometimes you know when
[1:01:00] I talk to people I that you know they
[1:01:02] tell me that their children are you know
[1:01:04] uh live five hours away from them they
[1:01:07] never see them and then you get to
[1:01:09] digging a little bit and you find out
[1:01:10] that the the kids and the parents you
[1:01:12] know they they just had a relationship
[1:01:14] where they didn't match they didn't mix
[1:01:16] and and things children were hurt and
[1:01:18] parents were hurt and there's no
[1:01:20] reconciliation I think that's one of the
[1:01:21] worst things in the world for children
[1:01:24] to be
[1:01:25] uh so hurt that they can't be around
[1:01:27] their parents anymore
[1:01:31] I don't mean that we let people just
[1:01:33] abuse us and walk all over us but what I
[1:01:35] do mean is that if we can offer Mercy we
[1:01:39] should offer it if we can extend
[1:01:41] compassion we should extend compassion
[1:01:43] because I'll tell you a secret
[1:01:44] forgiveness is not about what it does
[1:01:47] for the other person so much as what it
[1:01:49] does for you
[1:01:51] you see many times people cause offense
[1:01:54] in the end and we get upset and we walk
[1:01:57] around and we're thinking about it and
[1:01:58] we're just you know we go to bed
[1:02:00] thinking about it we wake up thinking
[1:02:01] about it we wake up in the middle of the
[1:02:03] night thinking about it and we think
[1:02:04] about all the the history of it you know
[1:02:07] and and we get real historical and it's
[1:02:10] like they did this they said that and
[1:02:11] then I said this and we go through it
[1:02:13] you know and and
[1:02:15] we hold that person hostage in our mind
[1:02:18] I'm not going to forgive them I'm going
[1:02:19] to let them know that you know by my
[1:02:21] attitude by how I treat them that they
[1:02:23] hurt me that they they've done they've
[1:02:25] done me wrong and they need to recognize
[1:02:27] you know
[1:02:28] or maybe it's just me maybe I'm the only
[1:02:30] one who ever does that
[1:02:33] but I tell you
[1:02:35] that person more than likely has already
[1:02:37] gone on they don't unfortunately many
[1:02:40] times people don't care that they've
[1:02:42] hurt you many times people don't care
[1:02:44] about the things that they've said
[1:02:45] they're they don't think anything else
[1:02:46] about it even if they know that they
[1:02:48] hurt you unfortunately many times they
[1:02:50] they they just move on with their lives
[1:02:52] and here we are stuck for for weeks or
[1:02:56] months or years thinking about how
[1:02:58] somebody has treated us
[1:03:01] when we finally forgive
[1:03:03] that per it has nothing to do with that
[1:03:05] person it has to do with us and letting
[1:03:08] go of things
[1:03:11] and so
[1:03:14] I would encourage you this this morning
[1:03:16] you know if there are things in your
[1:03:18] life
[1:03:19] that that are always coming up
[1:03:22] things that you think about over and
[1:03:24] over and over that you've not been able
[1:03:26] to get past
[1:03:28] I would I would I would suggest to you
[1:03:30] that perhaps you've not forgiven
[1:03:33] because it's a little bit like the
[1:03:35] church bell we have up there in the
[1:03:36] tower
[1:03:38] if we go and we send one of the children
[1:03:41] back there to to ring the bell this this
[1:03:43] is kind of a little bit like forgiveness
[1:03:45] when you when you forgive somebody
[1:03:48] you you ring the bell you hear the ding
[1:03:51] the dong the ding the dong and that's us
[1:03:54] rehearsing the hurt in our mind
[1:03:57] it goes back and forth but when we
[1:03:58] forgive just like that Bell gradually it
[1:04:02] goes away it slows we stop thinking
[1:04:04] about it so much we get over it until
[1:04:07] it's done and we've released it now
[1:04:11] unfortunately you know if it if you're
[1:04:13] if the pain and things in your life are
[1:04:16] like that Bell and they're still ringing
[1:04:17] and you still wake up and you're still
[1:04:19] thinking about things and every time you
[1:04:21] see someone or or you talk to someone
[1:04:23] and they mention this person I mentioned
[1:04:25] that and you can't let go of things it's
[1:04:27] because you've not truly forgiven in
[1:04:30] your heart
[1:04:31] I say Lord help us because I say Lord
[1:04:34] help me because you know I I'm real good
[1:04:37] at holding grudges believe me I wish I
[1:04:39] wasn't I wish I could sit here and tell
[1:04:41] you that I have no problem with
[1:04:42] forgiveness I have I have no problem
[1:04:44] with uh letting things go and I can just
[1:04:46] forget them but unfortunately that's
[1:04:48] that's not me it's not my nature I I
[1:04:50] hold on to things and um I I testify
[1:04:53] this this morning this sermon is
[1:04:55] probably not for you this sermon is
[1:04:57] probably for me
[1:04:58] uh because I need to forgive I need to
[1:05:01] be able to let things go I need to be
[1:05:02] able to to to to look at somebody and
[1:05:05] shake their hand and hug them around the
[1:05:07] neck and not have things in my mind that
[1:05:09] that why did they treat me this way why
[1:05:10] did they behave in this manner towards
[1:05:12] me why have they done this this thing
[1:05:15] I need to be able to let it go
[1:05:17] and so my prayer is God help me to
[1:05:19] exhibit Mercy to that person
[1:05:24] help me to it doesn't matter if they're
[1:05:25] a Believer it doesn't matter if there's
[1:05:27] somebody on the job side it doesn't
[1:05:28] matter who they are let me exhibit mercy
[1:05:31] and compassion
[1:05:35] because I mean honestly you know I don't
[1:05:37] know there I don't know their situation
[1:05:39] I don't know why they why they did
[1:05:41] something the way they did it I don't
[1:05:42] know why they said the things that they
[1:05:44] said you know I I want to believe that
[1:05:46] most people are good-hearted people that
[1:05:48] that most people don't walk around just
[1:05:50] being curmudgeonly and and and just
[1:05:53] trying to offend people you know I think
[1:05:55] many times people offend us and that
[1:05:57] they don't even
[1:05:59] they didn't mean to
[1:06:00] you know but we can take things and you
[1:06:02] know because of our complexes and
[1:06:04] because of our past experiences and we
[1:06:06] can take and run with something and hold
[1:06:08] on to it and and make some make a
[1:06:10] mountain out of out of a molehill
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] many times the people who hurt us the
[1:06:19] most are the the ones that we most
[1:06:21] deeply care for
[1:06:24] the people we look up to
[1:06:26] the people we expect you know that well
[1:06:29] they would never do such a such a thing
[1:06:32] and unfortunately
[1:06:35] the
[1:06:36] one of the most sad things the
[1:06:38] relationships that we have the longest
[1:06:41] are some of the relationships that we
[1:06:44] most quickly throw away
[1:06:47] over not forgiving
[1:06:50] because we
[1:06:52] aren't peacemakers because we're not
[1:06:55] merciful
[1:06:57] Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers
[1:06:59] for they shall be called the sons of God
[1:07:02] and you cannot be a peacemaker unless
[1:07:04] you are well-versed in forgiveness
[1:07:08] you know I I wonder sometimes you know
[1:07:10] like I said not many ministers preach on
[1:07:12] the Beatitudes not many ministers take
[1:07:14] this type of a subject we're often a lot
[1:07:17] more comfortable talking about godhead
[1:07:19] or serpent seed or this Doctrine or this
[1:07:21] Mercy or this you know Revelation and
[1:07:25] and don't want to get into the weeds of
[1:07:28] how we live our lives and how we become
[1:07:30] more like the God we serve
[1:07:33] and I was thinking about this you know
[1:07:35] as I was reading uh this this blessed
[1:07:39] are The Peacemaker and so
[1:07:41] what what is my conception of a
[1:07:43] peacemaker what do I think this what do
[1:07:44] I think this means how do I apply this
[1:07:46] in my life is it is it me mediating
[1:07:48] between my children and arguing over you
[1:07:51] know if they're arguing over toy and I'm
[1:07:53] like no well you can share it and you
[1:07:54] can you can have 10 minutes playing with
[1:07:56] it then you can have 10 minutes you know
[1:07:58] that's kind of like the uh one of the
[1:08:00] most basic ideas of of peacemaking
[1:08:06] but then you have the example of what
[1:08:08] brother Branham did in that clip I pray
[1:08:11] played for you where as a peacemaker
[1:08:14] he's reconciling someone to God
[1:08:18] that he took on the role of a
[1:08:21] intercessory role for someone
[1:08:23] and and and then move them into a right
[1:08:26] relationship and part of being a
[1:08:27] peacemaker in our lives when we talk
[1:08:29] about forgiveness is to be able to when
[1:08:33] when somebody has ought against you and
[1:08:35] they recognize it and you and you are
[1:08:37] butting heads that you come together and
[1:08:39] you make peace so that that person can
[1:08:40] be right with God because when you have
[1:08:43] ought against your brother or you have
[1:08:45] ought against your wife or you have
[1:08:46] ought against somebody at work you you
[1:08:48] can't be right with God when you hold it
[1:08:50] in your heart
[1:08:52] and peacemaking is is not the absence of
[1:08:55] conflict it's not the avoidance of
[1:08:57] strife or or say you know appeasement
[1:09:00] you know peace at any any price and I
[1:09:03] think many times as a husband a young
[1:09:05] husband I fell into this you know you
[1:09:07] and we almost make a joke of it though
[1:09:09] yes dear Yes dear you know because we we
[1:09:12] don't want to get into an argument with
[1:09:13] the with our spouse
[1:09:15] but that's not peacemaking
[1:09:17] that's just avoidance we're just
[1:09:19] avoiding the issue we're avoiding
[1:09:21] talking about it peacemakers are the
[1:09:23] ones who reconcile things
[1:09:26] and Jesus teaches us he says in in
[1:09:28] Matthew in another place he says
[1:09:29] moreover If thy brother shall trespass
[1:09:31] against thee go and tell him his fault
[1:09:34] between thee and him alone
[1:09:39] and if he shall hear thee thou has gain
[1:09:41] thy brother that's the point
[1:09:42] that's the point of of going and
[1:09:44] confronting someone that's the point of
[1:09:46] of of saying hey you hurt me is because
[1:09:49] you want to gain your brother you want
[1:09:51] to be reconciled you want to be in a
[1:09:53] right relationship with the people that
[1:09:56] surround you
[1:09:58] Jesus goes on he says but if you will
[1:10:00] not hear thee then take with thee one or
[1:10:02] two more that in the mouth of two or
[1:10:04] three Witnesses every word may be
[1:10:06] established
[1:10:07] and
[1:10:09] honestly I'll tell you I think this is
[1:10:11] probably one of the most
[1:10:13] ignored versus the one of the most
[1:10:15] ignored things in the Bible
[1:10:18] by by anybody message Believers included
[1:10:22] I know because every time that I've
[1:10:25] exercised this scripture
[1:10:27] and done what the Lord commands people
[1:10:30] get nervous
[1:10:31] what are you doing what's your agenda
[1:10:33] what's your what's the point what are
[1:10:35] you trying to do you know and people get
[1:10:37] all nervous about it and the point is is
[1:10:39] I want I want there to be nothing
[1:10:42] between us
[1:10:43] I don't I don't you know but people
[1:10:45] aren't used to it
[1:10:47] they're not used to that type of thing
[1:10:49] and that's a shame
[1:10:50] that's a that's a real shame that in the
[1:10:53] the ranks of the church when you go to
[1:10:55] your brother and to try to to gain them
[1:10:58] that they get nervous and scared and
[1:11:00] wondering what on Earth you're doing
[1:11:01] standing at their door
[1:11:04] um
[1:11:05] you see the witnesses aren't there the
[1:11:07] witnesses aren't there as Witnesses of
[1:11:09] what the Act was done necessarily
[1:11:11] they're not Witnesses it's not that you
[1:11:13] went and told them what was done and so
[1:11:15] now they're Witnesses against their
[1:11:16] brother but what they are there is to
[1:11:18] prove that you are doing something out
[1:11:21] of pure motive and a pure heart in your
[1:11:23] and to help you to to try to reconcile
[1:11:25] and and then you know Jesus says if they
[1:11:28] neglect to hear the witnesses tell it to
[1:11:30] the church and if you neglect to hear
[1:11:32] the church it's reconciliation
[1:11:33] reconciliation we're doing everything
[1:11:35] that we can finally you know that we can
[1:11:37] do to reconcile
[1:11:39] and if the person won't reconcile
[1:11:44] kick him out of the church
[1:11:47] wow nobody wants to read that scripture
[1:11:51] you know because
[1:11:52] you know in the simplest the simplest
[1:11:55] way what a trespass against you
[1:11:58] what is a trespass because we consider
[1:12:00] all kinds of things trespasses
[1:12:03] somebody doesn't greet us on the way in
[1:12:05] a church
[1:12:06] somebody doesn't call us when we're sick
[1:12:09] somebody you know looks at looks at us a
[1:12:12] little funny
[1:12:13] and we we hold that against them
[1:12:16] that's the trespass
[1:12:19] you make it the trespass
[1:12:22] and if we go strictly by what Jesus
[1:12:24] Christ commanded
[1:12:26] and we we should go and make that right
[1:12:31] and if you go to somebody who's done
[1:12:32] that and then they you know are done
[1:12:34] done something to us and they won't make
[1:12:37] it right can you imagine going through
[1:12:38] the steps where if they won't reconcile
[1:12:41] over such a small thing that you would
[1:12:43] kick them out of the church
[1:12:44] but see the church that that the kingdom
[1:12:47] of God that Jesus Christ is building
[1:12:49] is one of unity and Oneness
[1:12:52] people will hurt us offenses will come
[1:12:55] but we must be reconciled to one another
[1:12:58] Jesus says what he's saying here is give
[1:13:00] multiple multiple opportunities to
[1:13:02] reconcile and if you don't succeed try
[1:13:05] try try again
[1:13:08] amen
[1:13:13] it's ironic that that peacemaking is
[1:13:15] some of the most difficult and messy
[1:13:19] emotional work that you can do
[1:13:21] it takes time it takes emotional energy
[1:13:24] it's like when you are I know some of
[1:13:27] you like to go uh camping and out there
[1:13:30] in the in the the bush and
[1:13:33] it's like when you're trying to cross a
[1:13:36] creek on slippery rocks you know you got
[1:13:39] to get to the other side
[1:13:41] but the it's risky
[1:13:43] you know you can slip you can fall you
[1:13:45] can hurt yourself you get you get
[1:13:47] bruised
[1:13:48] sometimes you don't make it across the
[1:13:50] stream on the first try
[1:13:52] but when you make it across the stream
[1:13:53] You've Won your brother
[1:13:58] and say well I've done everything I can
[1:13:59] do I've made tried to make things right
[1:14:03] and at some point
[1:14:05] you're right at some point when you've
[1:14:07] done all that you can do
[1:14:10] sometimes you just have to walk away
[1:14:11] from it and you have to let it go
[1:14:14] and Paul tells us that in the Book of
[1:14:16] Romans in chapters 12 he says as much
[1:14:19] lieth in you
[1:14:22] as much as life in you he says if it be
[1:14:25] possible as much as life in you live
[1:14:27] peaceably with all men
[1:14:29] you know because there comes a point
[1:14:30] when you do have to separate you do have
[1:14:32] to part ways because of disagreement
[1:14:35] but that shouldn't be because of our
[1:14:37] lack of willingness to reconcile it
[1:14:40] shouldn't be because of our lack of of
[1:14:42] desire to bring unity in the body
[1:14:44] you know sometimes there's there are
[1:14:46] people you just you have to just say I
[1:14:48] agree to disagree
[1:14:49] you know and but you know what when you
[1:14:52] agree to disagree do it agreeably
[1:14:55] you walk away loving one another and
[1:14:57] being Brothers
[1:14:59] amen so we have a god-given a
[1:15:02] scripturally directed responsibility to
[1:15:04] pursue peace
[1:15:06] Paul says in Corinthians 7 15 that God
[1:15:09] has called you to peace
[1:15:12] sometimes we we disagree
[1:15:14] but the spirit of a peacemaker is one of
[1:15:16] a bridge builder to it doesn't matter
[1:15:19] what we've disagreed on we're still
[1:15:20] Brothers we're still fighting for one
[1:15:22] another we're still in this together you
[1:15:23] know the truth is
[1:15:25] and I I say this and I'm careful to say
[1:15:28] it because it can almost sound
[1:15:29] denominational you know that uh the
[1:15:33] truth is is we have more to unite around
[1:15:36] than we do to divide over and that's
[1:15:40] that's just that's the real truth of the
[1:15:42] matter you can see you know
[1:15:43] denominational churches will unite
[1:15:44] around that that ecumenical movement
[1:15:46] well we all believe in Jesus we all
[1:15:48] believe the Trinity we all believe this
[1:15:49] stuff and so we're brothers you know
[1:15:51] under the Catholic Church even you know
[1:15:53] the the daughters we came out from her
[1:15:56] but within the message
[1:16:00] there's more that we we agree on than
[1:16:02] what we disagree on you know and I find
[1:16:04] that the things that we often that we do
[1:16:06] disagree on
[1:16:07] are just plain silly
[1:16:09] and they don't matter that it's just
[1:16:11] somebody's opinion or their
[1:16:12] interpretation and you can agree on 99
[1:16:14] things and then separate over the one
[1:16:16] and ought not to be
[1:16:19] right amen so we got to build those
[1:16:21] bridges yeah so as I'm winding down here
[1:16:25] let's let me uh I know I'm not going to
[1:16:27] get through all my notes but let me
[1:16:28] hurry along and uh let's talk about how
[1:16:32] we can do this
[1:16:33] when when you've been hurt how do you
[1:16:35] build the bridges how do you forgive
[1:16:37] and the first thing
[1:16:40] we should do is talk to God about it
[1:16:43] the first thing we should do is talk to
[1:16:45] him
[1:16:47] I find that when I have something where
[1:16:52] there's a division between me and a
[1:16:54] brother that if I go and I pray to God
[1:16:56] about it
[1:16:57] it gives me tenderness towards that
[1:17:00] person
[1:17:01] it forces me to have a change in
[1:17:03] perspective
[1:17:04] because you know it's one thing to go to
[1:17:06] God and complain and and rehearse you
[1:17:09] know like he hasn't heard you rehearse
[1:17:11] in your mind a hundred times before you
[1:17:13] actually go and pray about it like he
[1:17:15] didn't know about it from the beginning
[1:17:16] anyway
[1:17:18] but what it does is it gives it gives
[1:17:19] him the opportunity to speak to you in a
[1:17:21] quill and a still and quiet moment
[1:17:25] and I find that that many times the Lord
[1:17:27] shows me that
[1:17:29] that is my attitude or my behavior
[1:17:32] that's hindering the reconciliation I
[1:17:36] told you I'm very good at holding
[1:17:37] grudges
[1:17:38] I I wasn't lying or being facetious
[1:17:42] it's just just our nature my family we
[1:17:45] we hold grudges
[1:17:47] and um
[1:17:50] well I I don't have the time to tell you
[1:17:52] but
[1:17:54] family
[1:17:55] goes away I I didn't meet my grandmother
[1:17:58] on my dad's side
[1:18:01] even though she raised my dad for most
[1:18:03] of his life I didn't meet her until I
[1:18:05] was about 13 years old
[1:18:07] because of grudges
[1:18:09] hurts
[1:18:13] their their family in my family that
[1:18:17] you know they get got to arguing at
[1:18:19] different points in their life that that
[1:18:21] we haven't seen in years
[1:18:23] that's sad
[1:18:24] it's sad but
[1:18:26] I say that to tell you
[1:18:28] you know that that holding on to things
[1:18:31] causes a division that ought not to be
[1:18:36] and and Jesus is very clear on the next
[1:18:38] on the next step towards the path of
[1:18:40] forgiveness is to take take the first
[1:18:42] step
[1:18:43] he says Jesus says so if you are
[1:18:46] offering your gift on the Altar and
[1:18:48] there you remember that your brother has
[1:18:50] something against you
[1:18:54] see if you know that you've done
[1:18:56] something against your brother the
[1:18:57] expectation is that you've already gone
[1:18:59] and apologized
[1:19:01] but if you remember that your brother
[1:19:03] has done something to you leave your
[1:19:05] gift there in front of the altar first
[1:19:07] go and be reconciled with your brother
[1:19:09] and then then come and offer your gift
[1:19:14] probably another one of the more ignored
[1:19:16] Commandments that Jesus has given us
[1:19:20] probably the most ignored
[1:19:24] see we're to make the first move
[1:19:27] we have to take the initiative and and
[1:19:30] forgiveness even when we're the offended
[1:19:33] party
[1:19:35] help me to live that
[1:19:37] I say Lord help me help me to live this
[1:19:42] verse
[1:19:45] conflict and division is never resolved
[1:19:49] accidentally
[1:19:50] people don't don't argue you don't bust
[1:19:53] and fight or have have issues and then
[1:19:55] wake up one day and it just magically
[1:19:57] has all disappeared
[1:20:00] reconciliation takes worth
[1:20:02] sometimes maybe it's a letter sometimes
[1:20:04] maybe it's a phone call sometimes you're
[1:20:06] visiting someone's house
[1:20:08] but
[1:20:10] we we're called to take action
[1:20:13] if we're at fault we're called to take
[1:20:15] action if our brother's at fault we're
[1:20:16] called to take action
[1:20:19] that's just as straight as it can get
[1:20:22] so when you talk to talk to the other
[1:20:24] person
[1:20:27] uh and what I'm trying to do here is
[1:20:28] just give you steps towards
[1:20:30] reconciliation how do you do this
[1:20:32] there's a process that that'll help you
[1:20:34] through this
[1:20:35] remember the words of Solomon in
[1:20:37] Proverbs 15 a gentle answer turns away
[1:20:39] anger but a harsh word stirs up Wrath
[1:20:43] remember the words of Jesus the meek
[1:20:45] shall inherit the earth
[1:20:46] and you go to someone in meekness and
[1:20:48] humility and you you work through
[1:20:51] something Paul wrote in Ephesians 4 29
[1:20:53] he said let no corrupt communication
[1:20:55] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[1:20:57] is good to the use of edifying that it
[1:20:59] may Minister Grace unto the hearers
[1:21:03] that's that Mercy I'm talking about
[1:21:05] that we go we go to someone and we we
[1:21:09] tell the truth
[1:21:11] we don't
[1:21:12] look you know sometimes sometimes it's
[1:21:14] okay to be truthful with people when
[1:21:16] they've hurt you
[1:21:17] and sometimes it's okay to tell them
[1:21:20] you did this it made me feel this way
[1:21:23] sometimes it's okay to to go to people
[1:21:27] and not withhold things
[1:21:30] the more you withhold the more you keep
[1:21:32] in your heart
[1:21:34] and we should put it all out there
[1:21:37] so you can go to somebody and you can
[1:21:39] empathize with them you can consider
[1:21:41] their situation
[1:21:42] and you can
[1:21:44] cooperate together to try to come to
[1:21:46] some sort of an agreement
[1:21:48] and I would say this that this the
[1:21:50] attitude to keep in the in
[1:21:51] reconciliation
[1:21:53] is is that the act of coming together
[1:21:56] and reconciling is
[1:21:59] more crucial than you being right
[1:22:03] you know I I sometimes I have to come
[1:22:05] and I have to approach a problem and say
[1:22:06] you know it doesn't matter
[1:22:08] if I'm right
[1:22:10] I might believe I'm I'm right
[1:22:12] but you know but what is more critical
[1:22:14] is that the relationship is restored
[1:22:17] amen
[1:22:18] and then lastly stop talking about the
[1:22:21] people
[1:22:22] who have hurt you to other people
[1:22:26] there's a there's a old Spanish proverb
[1:22:28] that says whoever gossips to you will
[1:22:31] gossip of you
[1:22:33] and I I can thankfully say that
[1:22:36] there's one area in my life I've never
[1:22:39] had a problem with I detest gossip
[1:22:43] it is it is no wonder that the Bible
[1:22:45] tells us you know talking about the
[1:22:48] tongue because
[1:22:49] it all it does is undermine somebody in
[1:22:54] your in your view in your eyes when you
[1:22:56] talk about somebody and sometimes I I
[1:22:57] get it sometimes you have to have
[1:22:59] somebody to talk to you know you have to
[1:23:01] have a friend that you can confide in
[1:23:03] but when you go and you talk to people
[1:23:05] and the and the aim is oh did you hear
[1:23:07] oh did you hear what this person did
[1:23:10] well I never
[1:23:12] and the goal of then is it is it like
[1:23:15] some sort of reconciliation you know and
[1:23:16] then you get the real gossipers at the
[1:23:18] end of it oh well we just need to pray
[1:23:20] for that person
[1:23:22] they just need more of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:23] because they must not have enough
[1:23:26] and we sit there and
[1:23:28] and talk about people
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:36] let me see what I can skip here because
[1:23:37] I'm I'm winding down
[1:23:46] no one can become a peacemaker until
[1:23:49] they have found peace themselves
[1:23:53] we cannot give others what's not real to
[1:23:56] us
[1:23:57] and peacemaking begins with the
[1:24:00] experience of peace in our own hearts
[1:24:02] Paul the Apostle begins all of his
[1:24:05] letters
[1:24:06] he says Grace and peace to you
[1:24:10] from God our father in the Lord Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ
[1:24:16] we have to experience the grace of God
[1:24:18] before we can experience the peace of
[1:24:20] God
[1:24:21] we have to come into a relationship with
[1:24:24] God through Jesus before we can really
[1:24:26] truly be givers of peace
[1:24:30] we have to know peace within ourselves
[1:24:32] before we can make peace in our
[1:24:33] relationships
[1:24:37] and as I said earlier a few moments ago
[1:24:39] self-forgiveness is just as important as
[1:24:41] forgiving others
[1:24:43] I don't know if you're like me at all
[1:24:45] but
[1:24:46] there there are things in my life things
[1:24:49] that I've done that you know I've gone
[1:24:51] and I've tried to make right you know
[1:24:53] and I asked for forgiveness and been
[1:24:54] forgiven
[1:24:56] but I still feel shame over it you know
[1:24:59] I still feel regret and remorse that I
[1:25:02] ever did something like that
[1:25:04] and and if we're not careful we can
[1:25:07] allow that the devil to beat that drum
[1:25:09] in our ear saying you're not worthy
[1:25:11] you're not worthy if you're a Christian
[1:25:13] if you had the Holy Ghost you would have
[1:25:14] never done that in the first place you
[1:25:16] would have never thought that you would
