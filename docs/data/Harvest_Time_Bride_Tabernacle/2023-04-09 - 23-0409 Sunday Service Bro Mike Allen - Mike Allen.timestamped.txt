[21:53] when he told you you're not good enough
[21:56] when he told you you're not right
[22:00] when he told you you're not strong
[22:03] enough
[22:04] to put up a good fight
[22:07] when he told you you're not worthy when
[22:11] he told you you're not loved when he
[22:14] told you you're not beautiful
[22:17] you'll never be enough
[22:21] fear he is a liar
[22:25] he will take your breath stop you in
[22:30] your steps
[22:32] fear he is a liar
[22:37] he will rob your rest steal your
[22:41] happiness cast your fear in the fire
[22:48] because fear he is a liar
[22:53] when he told you you were troubled
[22:56] you'll forever be alone when he told you
[23:00] you should run away you'll never find a
[23:04] home
[23:05] when he told you you were dirty and you
[23:09] should be ashamed when he told you you
[23:13] could be the one the grace could never
[23:16] change
[23:19] fear he is a liar
[23:22] he will take your breath stop you in
[23:27] your steps
[23:29] fear he is a liar
[23:33] he will rob your rest steal your
[23:37] happiness cast your fear
[23:41] in the fire
[23:44] because fear he is a liar
[23:49] let your fire fall and cast out to all
[23:53] my fears
[23:55] Let Your Fire Fall For Your Love Is All
[23:59] I fear

[24:09] feel

[24:18] let your fire flow Your Love Is All I
[24:22] feel
[24:24] fear he is a liar

[24:49] cause fear
[24:51] he is a liar
[24:54] cast your fear in the fire
[24:59] cause fear
[25:01] he is a liar
[25:11] fear he is a liar
[25:15] that's our subject this morning
[25:18] but before that is what I say
[25:20] Happy Easter he is the reason he is
[25:23] risen
[25:24] and I just wanted to
[25:26] if I didn't take time to recognize the
[25:29] resurrection before I started preaching
[25:32] what kind of Easter Service would it be
[25:35] Sonia asked me if I was going to be
[25:37] preaching in Easter Service
[25:39] I said well I don't think it's exactly
[25:41] an Easter service but
[25:43] but I decided we're going to turn to
[25:45] Matthew chapter 28.
[25:48] and we're just going to throw this right
[25:50] in here because if it wasn't for the
[25:53] resurrection we would be able to fear
[25:58] so it does fit
[25:59] I'm just going to go ahead and take this
[26:01] off
[26:02] this morning and
[26:07] I'll have you seated for this and then
[26:09] when I get to my main scripture here
[26:11] then I'll have you stand for the reading
[26:13] of the word
[26:16] in chapter 28 verse 1 I have to get
[26:19] there myself
[26:24] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[26:27] draw toward the first day of the week
[26:28] Came Mary Magdalene
[26:31] and the mother married to see the supper
[26:34] and behold there was a great earthquake
[26:37] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[26:39] heaven and came and rode back the Stone
[26:42] from the door that set upon it
[26:44] he wouldn't do that just for no reason
[26:47] something great was about to happen
[26:49] the Lord announces great things with
[26:52] signs and wonders in the Earth with
[26:54] earthquakes when he died on the cross
[26:56] there was an earthquake and the world
[26:58] went dark and that veil was rent
[27:02] because a new day was coming
[27:05] because we were now going to not be able
[27:07] to look at the veil but we're going to
[27:09] be able to enter into the Veil
[27:17] the descending to roll back to someone
[27:19] from the door that sat up on it his
[27:20] countenance was like the lightning and
[27:22] his Raymond was white as snow
[27:25] and for fear of him the keepers did
[27:27] shake and become as dead men
[27:29] I would imagine you see an angel you
[27:32] walk in there
[27:33] that would be a frightful time
[27:35] especially if you're the Roman soldiers
[27:37] guarding the tomb
[27:39] of the man that everybody was afraid of
[27:41] that he was and they'd heard the stories
[27:43] that there was going to be this
[27:45] Resurrection I would be afraid
[27:48] and the angel answered and said unto the
[27:50] women now here come the Believers here
[27:52] come the women here here come the bride
[27:58] and the angel answered and said unto the
[28:00] women fear not
[28:03] fear not ye for I know that you seek
[28:06] Jesus which has crucified
[28:09] are you seeking Jesus this morning
[28:12] are you seeking him every day of your
[28:13] life are you looking for him in every
[28:15] aspect of your life
[28:19] he is not here for he has risen he said
[28:22] come and see the place where the Lord
[28:24] lay
[28:26] because he has risen
[28:28] Satan thought he had put him in the
[28:30] grave for good
[28:32] he thought he'd nailed the last nail in
[28:35] the coffin
[28:36] but on this day the third day
[28:39] he had arisen and he was alive and he
[28:42] would later on appear to the disciples
[28:46] and commune with them
[28:50] in the Great and Mighty conqueror
[28:53] in 1957 brother Branham says this good
[28:56] morning to you
[28:57] a very happy Easter to each one of you
[29:00] this is one of the greatest days in
[29:03] commemoration of the resurrection of our
[29:05] lord it's one of the greatest days of
[29:07] all the world's history it's the
[29:09] resurrection and we're so happy to be
[29:11] here this morning on this great day and
[29:13] see the sun rising and the flowers are
[29:16] rising from the earth everything speaks
[29:18] Easter that's the beauty of spring
[29:20] everything speaks Resurrection the
[29:23] flowers are coming up the trees are
[29:25] coming back in the Boom the Lambs are
[29:27] lambing the cows are having calves and
[29:28] all that and everything speaks of the
[29:31] Resurrection how can you deny the
[29:33] resurrection
[29:34] all you have to do is look at that
[29:36] nature because nature proclaims the
[29:39] Lord's Resurrection
[29:42] everything speaks of Easter and now let
[29:44] us power heads just one moment
[29:46] father God into thy presence we come and
[29:50] we are expecting thee to give to the to
[29:52] us this morning just a little extra
[29:55] blessing from heaven
[29:57] some little touch of Easter in our own
[29:59] Souls
[30:00] some little touch of Resurrection in our
[30:03] own Souls we all have areas of our life
[30:04] that we need a resurrection in whether
[30:07] it's fear whether it's sickness whether
[30:09] it's discouragement whether it's worry
[30:11] whatever it is we have a little part of
[30:13] our life that we need because we're in
[30:15] human flesh the soul is veiled behind
[30:17] Badger skin Fallen flesh a fallen Spirit
[30:20] a fallen mind that that's influenced by
[30:23] the things of this world we all need a
[30:26] touch of Resurrection this morning and
[30:28] brother Branham here in this prayer he's
[30:30] saying just just a little extra blessing
[30:33] from Heaven some little touch of Easter
[30:35] in our own Souls individuals not the
[30:38] church as a whole but each one of you
[30:40] can have your own Touch of Resurrection
[30:42] this morning
[30:48] and when we leave here we might say as
[30:50] those who came from Emmaus
[30:52] did not our hearts burn within us
[30:54] because of his presence
[30:57] for we ask it in his name and for his
[30:59] glory amen
[31:02] that's what I want to leave here I want
[31:04] to be able to say did not our hearts
[31:05] burn within us because he was speaking
[31:07] to us along the way is because we were
[31:10] walking and we were expecting a
[31:12] resurrection in our own life we're
[31:14] expecting to raise up out of this debt
[31:15] and one day we're gonna we're gonna step
[31:17] from this body we're going to step into
[31:19] eternity and we're going to lay down
[31:20] this whole Badge of skin and we're going
[31:22] to take on a glorified body and we're
[31:24] going to be resurrected just like he was
[31:26] resurrected to his glorified body we're
[31:29] going to be resurrected into our
[31:30] glorified body to live with him forever
[31:32] to reign with him forever to come back
[31:35] in a millennium to rule and Reign Over
[31:36] this Earth for a thousand years and then
[31:38] to go and end with him and to a new
[31:40] heavens and a new Earth and a complete
[31:43] full body a fullness of Resurrection
[31:45] that's what we're looking forward to
[31:47] this morning
[31:49] what we're looking forward to very soon
[31:51] the signs and the times are all around
[31:53] us that our Resurrection is near our
[31:56] Rapture is near that we're going to lay
[31:58] down this old dead decaying flesh this
[32:00] whole dedicating body this old dead
[32:02] decaying mind this old dead decaying
[32:04] fears and all that we're going to lay it
[32:06] down and we're going to put it aside and
[32:08] we're going to step into that glorified
[32:10] body and we will reign and we will know
[32:12] as we are known we will be just like him
[32:15] because we are him
[32:17] amen
[32:20] all right and this morning I want to
[32:22] speak on fear he is a liar I'm gonna if
[32:26] you want to stand for the reading of the
[32:27] word here real quick and I'll just read
[32:30] one
[32:32] scripture here I
[32:36] and then
[32:37] it's been good to be here with you all
[32:40] and just kind of hate seeing where it's
[32:43] Sunday and we'll be heading home this
[32:45] evening and
[32:47] because you know it's hard to break away
[32:49] when you're with the body of Christ
[32:51] it's hard to break away when you're just
[32:53] having a good time of fellowship and
[32:56] enjoying everybody's presence and all
[32:58] that
[33:00] and we're going to turn to first John 4.
[33:03] we're going to read seven through eight
[33:04] and if I could get some water that would
[33:06] be awesome
[33:13] I'm going to just read Verse 18 here
[33:15] real quick
[33:17] in first John chapter 4.
[33:23] there is no fear in love but perfect
[33:25] love casteth out fear
[33:27] because fear hath torment he that
[33:30] feareth is not made perfect in love
[33:34] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[33:37] we come before you this morning Father
[33:40] Lord and humbleness of mine Lord
[33:43] to seeking your word father to seeking
[33:46] your guidance in our life father God and
[33:48] Lord we just we just want to remember
[33:50] you on this Resurrection Day father this
[33:53] day that's been set aside to to remember
[33:55] that you went to the grave but you

[34:02] you come forth in glory and you come

[34:10] and and Lord not only live but Lord we
[34:13] can live without fear in our lives
[34:15] father because knowing that you Rose
[34:17] that means it will rise father knowing
[34:19] that you Rose that means we have an
[34:20] advocate with the father it means that

[34:25] our troubles in all our trials and all
[34:27] our fears and all our wants and
[34:28] everything down upon you father Lord we

[34:46] more like you make it into your image
[34:48] board we commit it into your hands
[34:50] father we commit the service in your
[34:51] hands Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray
[34:53] amen
[34:55] amen
[34:57] fear he is a liar
[35:02] now I'd heard that song that Sonia is
[35:05] saying there
[35:10] many times
[35:11] but I always said if always thought it
[35:13] said fear is a liar
[35:15] but then I got to listening to it and I
[35:17] I heard it
[35:19] and it hit me
[35:21] it just hit me one day it says fear he
[35:26] is a liar
[35:28] and what that told me was is because
[35:31] fear he is a liar I could personify fear
[35:35] now I know what fear is it's a demon and
[35:38] if it's a demon then I know what I'm
[35:40] fighting if it's some emotion out here
[35:42] but some kind of complex or something
[35:43] like that I don't really know what I'm
[35:45] fighting a lot of times but because I
[35:47] can identify it as a being come from
[35:50] hell all of a sudden I can say oh the
[35:54] same thing that works against Satan is
[35:55] going to bork against his demons the
[35:58] same thing it works against cancer is
[35:59] going to work against fear the same
[36:01] thing is going to work against
[36:03] sin in our lives is going to work
[36:04] against fear that is the word of God in
[36:07] our lives
[36:09] but we fail to recognize what we're
[36:11] fighting a lot of times we think we're
[36:13] fighting our own mind we think we're
[36:15] fighting our own complex we think we're
[36:16] fighting all this but really it's a
[36:18] demon that's coming against us that's
[36:20] trying to tell us that we're this is
[36:22] trying to tell us that we're that what's
[36:23] trying to tell us why we aren't is
[36:25] trying to tell us we're not a child of
[36:26] God is trying to tell us that we have
[36:28] everything to fear it's trying to tell
[36:30] us that that cancer is a reality it's
[36:32] trying to tell us that that depression
[36:34] is a reality it's trying to tell us that
[36:35] anxiety is a reality it's trying to tell
[36:37] us that we're not a child of God is a
[36:39] reality but it's not I stand here to
[36:41] Proclaim Freedom this morning because
[36:43] fear he is a liar because he is a liar
[36:47] that we don't have to listen to it
[36:48] because all we have to listen to is the
[36:50] truth and what is truth it is the word
[36:53] of God and the word of God says I am
[36:55] free the word of God says I have a sound
[36:57] mind the word of God says that cancer
[36:59] can't come against me it says I am
[37:01] already healed by his stripes
[37:04] past tense yesterday he did it on the
[37:07] cross he did it when he took the stripes
[37:09] he healed me already you believe it you
[37:13] accept it in your life
[37:18] you're responsible
[37:24] fear he is a liar
[37:28] and I just listen to these this song
[37:32] when he told you that you're not good
[37:34] enough would God tell you that you're
[37:36] not good enough no
[37:38] there has to be a demon
[37:41] when he told you that you're not right
[37:43] did you repent did you ask for
[37:46] forgiveness
[37:49] I'm right
[37:51] I'm right Satan I repented I I I I went
[37:56] back and asked the Lord to forgive me so
[37:57] now I'm right I'm in a right spirit with
[38:00] the Lord you are a liar
[38:02] I'm not going to listen to you anymore
[38:05] get behind me Satan
[38:11] when he told you you're not strong
[38:13] enough well the word says I'm not strong
[38:15] enough I'll agree with you on that but
[38:17] it all says my strength is found in
[38:19] Christ and it says I can do all things
[38:22] through Christ who strengthens me I had
[38:25] a reality yes in this flesh I am not
[38:28] strong enough but in the night of Christ
[38:30] and when I'm walking him when I'm
[38:32] walking in the spirit when I have the
[38:34] bathroom it's the Holy Ghost I am strong
[38:36] enough you are strong enough this
[38:39] morning to put all things behind you to
[38:42] put Satan under your feet
[38:44] quit listening to him
[38:48] quite less any time he's a liar he's a
[38:52] liar
[38:54] you don't have to list the time you've
[38:57] gave your heart to Christ you've been
[38:58] baptized with the Holy Spirit he is a
[39:01] liar saying you are a liar saying you're
[39:04] a liar
[39:08] I will not listen to you anymore though
[39:11] you come at me with my bed though you
[39:13] try to put the pressure on now you're
[39:15] trying to put anxiety on me no you try
[39:17] to tell me my children are lost I will
[39:20] not listen to you because I am Christ
[39:22] and I stand strong in his word because I
[39:25] have the baptism only good
[39:28] Glory
[39:32] it's not us it's him doing it through us
[39:38] what's your confession this morning
[39:41] he said he is
[39:43] in Hebrews
[39:48] he said he's the god of our profession
[39:51] of our confession
[39:53] no I'm not saying it just right
[39:55] I'm already losing my voice
[40:02] I'll tell you how he is
[40:04] I preached yesterday
[40:06] I preached hard
[40:08] I preached about the denominations in
[40:10] the message
[40:11] he's trying to tell me I was wrong
[40:14] you know what
[40:16] fear he is a liar
[40:19] fear he is a liar
[40:22] trying to get me down
[40:23] they'll try to get you down
[40:25] oh he tried to give me this last few
[40:28] weeks tell me that I had some kind of
[40:30] heart problem or I had some kind of met
[40:32] brain problem I had had some even some
[40:35] Rogue test that said I might have had
[40:37] many strokes
[40:38] well you know what that was all fear
[40:42] and I got to I I went so far to get the
[40:45] proof on magnetic tape
[40:50] but you know he tried to convince me
[40:52] that
[40:54] you know he tried to convince me I
[40:55] didn't have the Holy Spirit
[40:57] though in my heart and my heart and I
[40:59] knew that I knew
[41:00] but I had to stand up against him
[41:03] you have to stand up against him
[41:06] whatever he's telling you this morning
[41:08] you stand against it you confess the
[41:10] opposite of it if he's telling you
[41:12] you're lost you say no Satan I'm saved
[41:14] if he tells you you don't have the whole
[41:15] baptism the Holy Ghost you say Satan
[41:17] I've got the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[41:18] Talk the same for a little Feud He likes
[41:21] to talk to you talk back
[41:24] tell him who you are
[41:27] tell him that you had the baptism of the
[41:29] Holy Spirit
[41:30] because he's going to tell you you don't
[41:31] he's going to tell you you're going to
[41:33] die he's going to tell you all this
[41:34] stuff well you just start confessing the
[41:36] opposite Satan I got the baptism of the
[41:38] Holy Ghost and there's nothing you could
[41:39] do to take it from me
[41:43] Satan I've been healed because the Bible
[41:45] says by his strengths I'm already healed
[41:46] and even if I die in this life I get the
[41:48] ultimate healing so you lose anyways
[41:51] I don't care anymore
[42:01] he tells you you're not strong enough to
[42:03] put up a good fight oh it is profession
[42:06] of your mouth you don't have to have
[42:07] some big strong brawny muscles all you
[42:09] have to do is say I am healed all I have
[42:12] to do is say I have the baptism Holy
[42:14] Ghost all you have to do is say I am a
[42:16] message believer this message of the
[42:17] hour all you have to do is say I am a
[42:20] Christian
[42:21] profession it's not strength and brains
[42:24] and Brownie and all that it's the
[42:25] strength to believe and confess it with
[42:28] your mouth you've talked you speak it
[42:30] you tell him who you are you you you
[42:35] quit saying already yeah yeah right
[42:37] right saying I I I I do have this and
[42:40] and I do make these mistakes and and I
[42:43] did saying yesterday and and we go on
[42:45] and we go on this Rabbit Trail we go on
[42:47] this Rabbit Trail and
[42:49] excuse The Voice
[42:56] we're getting on these rabbit Trails of
[42:58] I ain't I can't
[43:01] well my dad told me one time he said
[43:02] can't you never could do nothing and you
[43:05] know what can't never could do nothing
[43:07] but can can
[43:09] I can do this I can step out on the
[43:12] faith of God I can become a Believer if
[43:14] I'm not strong enough I can become
[43:15] strong enough if I have weak faith I can
[43:17] have weak faith if I'm lacking in this I
[43:20] I don't have to lack in it if I kneeling
[43:23] I need healing I have healing already
[43:25] the Bible already said it
[43:32] he told you you're not worthy oh you're
[43:35] so worthy he went to a cross to die and
[43:38] sacrifice himself for you that he would
[43:40] go to the grave and take your sin upon
[43:42] him
[43:44] that's how worthy you were
[43:46] oh he didn't do that for you I was
[43:48] saying shut up
[43:50] I'm tired of your voice let me get some
[43:52] duct tape put on your mouth
[43:54] let me put some duct tape of faith on
[43:56] your mouth let me put some duct tape or
[43:58] confession on your mouth you're going to
[43:59] shut up in my sight for Satan or I'm
[44:01] going to beat you down and I'm going to
[44:03] beat you down and you're going to hate
[44:04] being around me when I get out of bed
[44:05] you're going to start trembling when my
[44:07] toes Hit the Floor you're going to start
[44:08] trembling saying because I've had enough
[44:10] of and I'm going to confess it from this
[44:11] day forth from this day forth from this
[44:14] day forward say no more from this day
[44:15] for is making confession from this day
[44:17] forth tell him who you are and tell him
[44:20] what you need and that you already have
[44:22] it
[44:23] [Applause]
[44:25] it came to confession
[44:30] despite of the symptoms
[44:34] oh I'm feeling down today who cares
[44:37] praise God I'm saved praise God I'm in
[44:40] I'm in the battle for the Lord
[44:57] when he told you you're not loved
[45:02] why would he go to the cross
[45:06] if I wasn't loved
[45:09] why would he send me to church if I
[45:11] wasn't loved why would he give me a
[45:12] pastor to sit under if I wasn't loved
[45:14] why would he give me children if I
[45:16] wasn't loved why would he do this give
[45:18] me a job and give me money and all that
[45:20] if I'm not love not that science if you
[45:22] don't have a job and that we have
[45:23] different situations trials would go
[45:25] through
[45:26] but why would I care
[45:29] if I wasn't loved
[45:31] a lot of people don't care that don't
[45:33] feel like they're cared for they're
[45:35] going to try to end their life
[45:40] but he cares
[45:43] it says he cast all your burdens on me
[45:46] for I careth for you
[45:50] cast all your worries on me for I careth
[45:52] for you
[45:55] so the word tells us he cares
[46:00] oh when he told you you're not beautiful
[46:04] oh but I'm the bride of Christ
[46:06] he's not going to marry some ugly no
[46:09] good
[46:10] ragged dirt all over my face he's going
[46:13] to clean me up first
[46:15] if it takes that
[46:17] but when he presents me to the world
[46:19] like we were talking yesterday about the
[46:21] bride when when he presented when we
[46:24] present the bride she's beautiful
[46:27] I don't think I've ever seen an ugly
[46:29] bride
[46:31] she's all dressed in her white and she's
[46:33] all done up and and she stands there and
[46:36] she's radiated if you see a bride or
[46:37] even a new mother there's something that
[46:40] just radiates out of them there's a
[46:42] beauty that passes all understanding
[46:44] that this radiates out of a true bride
[46:48] of a true Holy Ghost filled lady that's
[46:51] walking down to meet her husband as the
[46:54] bride of Christ as we are truly filled
[46:56] with the Holy Ghost and we walk out and
[46:58] we're presented to the bride as a bride
[47:00] of Christ there's a beauty that radiates
[47:03] out of the bride and you can't put it
[47:05] down the world can't they have nothing
[47:07] like it they try to make themselves
[47:09] beautiful they try to they try to paint
[47:11] their faces they try I don't know why
[47:12] I'm going to not so many times this week
[47:15] but they're they try to do themselves up
[47:18] and and they instead of beauty they try
[47:20] to attract themselves to to their
[47:22] nakedness to their body and they try to
[47:25] show forth but that's that's reserved
[47:28] for for the husband
[47:30] in the secret Chambers but there's a
[47:32] beauty that goes beyond that there's a
[47:34] glow that comes out of it whether
[47:37] brother Branham said that that Hollywood
[47:40] is beautiful but the word of God glows
[47:45] I think that's how it goes I have a sore
[47:47] in my notes somewhere
[47:51] their beauty is Vanity
[47:53] they're saying look at me
[47:55] look at my beauty look at my body look
[47:58] at this look at that that that's vanity
[48:00] that's vanity but what we're looking at
[48:04] we want to show look at me as I show
[48:07] forth Christ
[48:08] look at me as I show forth his life his
[48:12] Beauty his humbleness his his
[48:15] meekness his long suffering his glory
[48:18] look at me as I show forth that I don't
[48:22] need to to come out and try to be a
[48:25] brawnian and my shirt split open and
[48:28] chest sticking out and all that and and
[48:31] chicken legs showing out with shorts and
[48:34] all that
[48:37] I don't need any of that
[48:41] I spend my time sitting in the word of
[48:43] God
[48:44] and there's a beauty that starts to
[48:47] build inside of you
[48:48] and when he tells you you're not
[48:50] beautiful
[48:51] say are you saying Christ isn't
[48:53] beautiful
[48:55] I'm him
[48:56] are you saying Jesus Christ isn't
[48:59] beautiful
[49:00] are you trying to say the word isn't
[49:02] beautiful it doesn't bring peace it
[49:04] doesn't bring joy it doesn't bring
[49:06] happiness
[49:08] oh I'm a living example of his Beauty
[49:13] why because I've eaten the word and I
[49:15] become one with it
[49:17] and now I'm prophesying to the world
[49:20] remember Revelations 10 11. I'm
[49:24] prophesying to the world I'm living a
[49:26] life to this world of the beauty of
[49:29] Jesus Christ I'm showing forth his
[49:31] Beauty I'm showing forth his love in my
[49:34] life and how I treat others and how I
[49:36] conduct myself and how I act or react
[49:39] with my kids how I can react with my
[49:41] wife how I act and react with my
[49:42] employer how I act and react with my
[49:44] employee fellow employees and all that
[49:46] each day in my life I'm showing forth
[49:49] Christ's Beauty now do we mess up yeah
[49:51] we mess up but we quickly repent
[49:53] and we turn it back and we say Lord
[49:55] forgive me I'll not do it again which we
[49:58] know we'll probably do it again because
[49:59] we're in Fallen flesh
[50:01] but it's not what he's looking at he's
[50:03] looking at that heart's desire he's
[50:05] looking at the beauty of the heart but
[50:07] Satan's going to point you to the flesh
[50:09] he's going to point you to your Fallen
[50:11] body he's going to point you to your
[50:13] Fallen mind and your Fallen spirit
[50:16] and he's going to tell you that's who
[50:18] you are and it's just an old fear tactic
[50:27] brother Branham and the unpardonable sin
[50:35] you know the Fallen body I had to have a
[50:37] cataract surgery now I got to read have
[50:38] reading glasses
[50:41] so there ain't no Beauty on this natural
[50:43] flesh
[50:44] but what Christ is doing
[50:47] but one day I'll have a glorified body
[50:48] and I won't need these sister who man
[50:51] you won't need those
[50:56] the unpardable sin in 1954 verse 31 it
[50:59] says that one sacrifice forever he made
[51:02] his offering giving his own life sit
[51:04] down at the right hand of the Majesty on
[51:06] high and we have a high priest setting
[51:08] in the Majesty of God
[51:11] in the presence of the great creator
[51:13] making intercessions Upon Our profession
[51:15] there were intercessions Upon Our
[51:17] professions or our confession
[51:21] he's making intercessions for that
[51:26] then he said in verse 19 having
[51:27] therefore Brethren boldness to enter to
[51:30] the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[51:33] so when he was died on the cross and
[51:35] that blood was shed and we come
[51:36] underneath that blood
[51:38] we have boldness now that we can enter
[51:41] into the holy is the holiest remember
[51:44] the veil was rent it was split open so
[51:46] that would hid the hallways of holies
[51:48] before in the law if you were to enter
[51:50] into that holiest of holies you would
[51:52] die
[51:54] if you weren't
[51:55] properly prepared for it but now it's
[51:59] been split and it's wide open and now we
[52:02] have the covering of the blood on us
[52:03] that when we need something we can
[52:06] boldly go in remember Esther didn't know
[52:08] who she was at the beginning
[52:10] after she was married to a two Xerxes
[52:13] and but she still prepared herself in
[52:16] the right way but when it came down to
[52:18] when this action had to be done she
[52:20] boldly went in
[52:22] found favor with Christ
[52:25] she had already prepared herself she had
[52:28] already taken on that messenger and went
[52:30] in that way the message of the hour the
[52:33] word of Christ and here we are we can go
[52:36] in boldly in the holiest of holies when
[52:39] we have a need when Satan's trying to
[52:41] pound you down he's trying to tell you
[52:43] you're worthless and trying to tell you
[52:44] you're no good trying to tell you that
[52:46] you'll amount to nothing we can boldly
[52:48] go before the throne
[52:53] into the Hoist of holies
[52:55] and he would say here in verse 33 in
[52:58] paragraph 33 says think of it
[53:02] no fear
[53:05] that's the greatest plague there is in
[53:07] the Christian church today is afraid
[53:12] the biggest
[53:14] plague of the Christian church
[53:18] is there afraid because they don't know
[53:20] who they are
[53:23] and they're so timid and they're let
[53:25] Satan beat him over the head was just a
[53:27] little tiniest thing the littlest
[53:29] tiniest mistake and all of a sudden
[53:31] you're lost
[53:33] the blood didn't lose its power when I
[53:35] was first saved
[53:36] so when I messed up over here it's not
[53:38] going to lose its power then either it's
[53:40] going to make me white as snow
[53:42] but the greatest plague is fear is to be
[53:46] afraid and the reason they're afraid is
[53:48] because they're not taught right and
[53:50] settled right on the gospel
[53:53] they come in under the guise of
[53:55] accepting Christ and his blood and
[53:57] accepting forgiveness like that then all
[53:59] of a sudden Satan says well you got to
[54:01] do this right
[54:02] you got to do that right you're going to
[54:05] have to go and bow down 10 times and
[54:08] walk backwards 10 times and you know you
[54:10] weren't really baptized right because
[54:11] you didn't go fast forward or whatever
[54:13] and and and you know and on and on and
[54:17] on the list goes on and on and on and on
[54:19] and saying to sit there and beat you
[54:20] down beat you down beat you down and but
[54:22] then you go over in Ephesians it says
[54:24] you are predestinated to be conformed
[54:26] Into His Image there's nothing we can do
[54:29] if we're predestinated it has to come to
[54:32] Prohibition so we can sit back and we
[54:34] can rest in that predestination
[54:37] because he's doing the work in US we can
[54:40] sit there and we can rest in that and we
[54:42] don't have to be afraid anymore when we
[54:44] make mistakes we don't have to be afraid
[54:46] when Satan tries to put some kind of
[54:48] evil upon us we don't have to be afraid
[54:50] when Satan tries to tell us that we're
[54:51] not good enough we don't have to be
[54:53] afraid when he tells us that we're not
[54:55] really his because
[54:57] he said he predestinates Those whom
[54:59] before knew he predestinated
[55:00] predestinated and we're all the way up
[55:03] to we're going to be going into a
[55:04] glorified body
[55:09] and I like this and I'm going to
[55:11] personalize this to you guys
[55:14] he says there's no reason why
[55:18] Harvest Time Bible Tabernacle
[55:21] couldn't be a beehive of a power
[55:24] of the power of God buzzing with the
[55:26] glory of God flying from everywhere
[55:29] it's a little tiny Church
[55:31] there is no reason
[55:34] you shouldn't be a Powerhouse of God
[55:37] if you keep listening to Satan telling
[55:39] you that you're no good telling that
[55:40] you're lost or whatever you'll never be
[55:42] a Powerhouse of God because you'll be so
[55:44] concerned about your own self that
[55:47] you'll be no good to the body of Christ
[55:54] he says the power of God buzzing with
[55:55] the glory of God flying from everywhere
[55:58] this little old hole in the wall here
[56:00] almost as known throughout the entire
[56:02] world this little spot you're setting in
[56:04] tonight because not of what William
[56:07] Branham but because of Jesus Christ not
[56:08] because of Dale Langston but because of
[56:10] Jesus Christ not because of the body of
[56:12] Believers here but because of Jesus
[56:14] Christ has been made preeminent and is
[56:16] put being put forth as
[56:19] the Supreme Being ruling over this
[56:22] church
[56:26] the Son of God the gospel that they're
[56:28] content that they've contended for no
[56:30] sir I had nothing to do with it not at
[56:33] all it was him who did it and made this
[56:35] place known throughout the world when it
[56:37] was nothing but a little fifteen hundred
[56:39] dollar structure something like that
[56:40] fixed up here with no floor but it's God
[56:43] Almighty Almighty Who does these things
[56:45] now we have boldness enter into the
[56:47] holistic by the blood of Jesus by a New
[56:50] and Living Way not the old way by a New
[56:53] and Living Way that was the dead way an
[56:55] order of the law but now we enter by
[56:58] grace through the Holy Spirit oh I hope
[57:01] you see it nothing that you could do the
[57:03] law was Works Touch not handle not taste
[57:06] not eat no meat keep sabbaths new moons
[57:08] all forms of worship that what man did
[57:12] what man did
[57:17] but in this New and Living Way it's
[57:19] nothing that we could do it's what he
[57:22] does for us by Grace we just accept it
[57:26] Grace Christ takes away the sin we
[57:29] believe that hear the gospel believe it
[57:31] accept it and then if we truly accept it
[57:32] from the death of our heart God gives us
[57:34] the Holy Ghost as a witness
[57:38] sounds real complicated doesn't it
[57:41] and I'm going to have to go and
[57:44] I'm going to have to not eat meat on
[57:45] this day I'm going to have to not do
[57:47] this over here and and I can't have any
[57:50] more steak or anything like
[57:55] wrong Church of being for that
[58:00] we gotta have a little fun right
[58:03] but a New and Living Way not justified
[58:06] by works not justified by the law
[58:09] but by the grace of God and accepting
[58:11] the work that he did on Calgary
[58:15] if we ever get that right in our mind
[58:19] we will have no fear because we'll know
[58:22] that because he saved us
[58:25] all the promises are ours
[58:30] every promise is ours if we ever come to
[58:33] that exact that perfect realization that
[58:35] he died on the cross to save us and we
[58:38] become him
[58:39] and he remember he said all that was in
[58:42] the father reported into Christ and all
[58:43] those Christ he poured into his bride
[58:47] so if everything that Christ is is
[58:49] poured into you
[58:53] you have access
[58:55] to everything
[58:58] you have access to a sound mind he says
[59:01] I give you a sound mind not a fear not
[59:03] of worry
[59:05] and I'm you can go look up the
[59:07] scriptures later and get the exact
[59:09] saying of it
[59:12] so what do we have to worry about Brian
[59:15] what do we have to worry about you know
[59:16] what it is a lot of times you get people
[59:18] out there and they they come to Christ
[59:20] and and they they love they love the
[59:23] gifts and they love the science and they
[59:24] love the Wonders all that and they
[59:26] become engaged to Christ and all they
[59:27] ever do is they stay engaged to Christ
[59:29] and all they do is they walk around
[59:31] engagement oh I'm Christ I'm Christ I'm
[59:33] Christ I'm Christ but they never go all
[59:35] the way and consummate the marriage
[59:37] there never will go all the way and go
[59:38] through the ceremony and become one with
[59:40] him and go in and lay themselves bare
[59:43] and lay themselves in an intimate way
[59:45] and become one with him
[59:49] but they stay in engagement and they
[59:51] wonder why I have so many troubles in my
[59:53] life they wonder why I have so many
[59:55] fears in my life they wonder why I have
[59:57] so many mind battles in my life because
[59:58] they haven't fully entered in and become
[1:00:00] one Christ they haven't consummated that
[1:00:02] marriage they haven't taken on his name
[1:00:04] but they like staying in his presence
[1:00:07] because being in his presence there is
[1:00:09] no other place to be that will make you
[1:00:11] feel so safe and so secure but they
[1:00:13] could never seem to get their mind
[1:00:14] around fear they can never seem to get
[1:00:16] their mind around it that they could be
[1:00:18] healed they never seem to get their mind
[1:00:19] around that they have the Holy Ghost
[1:00:21] because all they're doing is walking
[1:00:23] engagement
[1:00:25] engagement doesn't make you married
[1:00:27] completely
[1:00:33] means you have a relationship with him
[1:00:36] but you have not taken his name
[1:00:39] you have not taken on his likeness you
[1:00:42] have not taken on his his
[1:00:44] um
[1:00:45] all that he was
[1:00:47] you have you're afraid to take on the
[1:00:50] shame that he faced you're afraid to
[1:00:52] take on everything that he had to go
[1:00:55] through because when you marry him all
[1:00:57] of a sudden the sufferings that he
[1:00:58] suffered you suffered with him with
[1:01:00] everything that he went through you went
[1:01:02] through with him and you have to
[1:01:03] identify when he hung on the cross you
[1:01:05] have to identify yourself on there on
[1:01:07] the cross you have to I go to the cross
[1:01:09] with him you have to lay down all
[1:01:11] yourself and go to the cross with him
[1:01:13] and be willing to die to yourself like
[1:01:15] he was willing to die to himself and lay
[1:01:17] it all out for you now all of a sudden
[1:01:20] you're in engagement and all that but
[1:01:21] you don't want to go into marriage
[1:01:22] because you want to be able to flirt
[1:01:23] with this and you want to be able to
[1:01:24] flirt with the world over here but all
[1:01:26] of a sudden he's asking you to come into
[1:01:28] the bride chamber he's asking you to
[1:01:29] come into the full marriage and he wants
[1:01:31] you to identify with him
[1:01:34] as one and go to the Cross lay down all
[1:01:38] your wants lay down all your desires lay
[1:01:40] down all the worldly desires and go in
[1:01:42] and take on his word and take on his
[1:01:44] name and all sudden when you take on his
[1:01:46] name guess what you have to act like him
[1:01:48] because you are his representative on
[1:01:50] your Earth and if you truly love him you
[1:01:52] will not be afraid to rep be represented
[1:01:55] with him you will not be afraid to put
[1:01:57] his name out there you won't be afraid
[1:01:59] to write a check with his name on it and
[1:02:01] be identified with him oh I am Mrs Jesus
[1:02:04] Christ here's my check for healing here
[1:02:06] I Mrs Jesus Christ here's my check to
[1:02:08] overcome depression here's my G here's
[1:02:10] my check to overcome whatever it is in
[1:02:12] your life I stand Here identified with
[1:02:15] Christ I don't care what kind of name he
[1:02:17] has out here in the world I'm going to
[1:02:19] stand right here the world may ridicule
[1:02:21] they may make fun they may ask why
[1:02:23] you're doing this and why you're doing
[1:02:25] that I don't care I'm identified with
[1:02:27] Christ and all that he is I am
[1:02:31] fear you are a liar that is opened up to
[1:02:34] me I could step into that today if you
[1:02:37] haven't stepped into that fully today
[1:02:39] you step into it for you today do it
[1:02:42] today today today today
[1:02:45] don't wait tomorrow maybe too late
[1:02:53] walking out these doors maybe too late
[1:02:55] he may drop dead right here
[1:03:06] if you're just walking around engagement
[1:03:07] with the Lord
[1:03:09] you don't have a full relationship
[1:03:13] and the Satan has every right to put
[1:03:15] every fear upon you
[1:03:17] he has every right to torment you
[1:03:20] because you have no protection you have
[1:03:22] some partial protection you can get into
[1:03:24] a scene of Revival and go to a church
[1:03:26] meeting get all the fields and all the
[1:03:28] joy and all the tangles up and down your
[1:03:30] spine a lot and you'll have a little bit
[1:03:31] of victory for a few minutes but as soon
[1:03:33] as you walk out these doors guess what
[1:03:36] you're by yourself again
[1:03:39] it may last a week it may last a month
[1:03:43] but if you haven't went in and married
[1:03:45] him
[1:03:46] you're the subject of all back
[1:03:53] God testifying of his gifts so don't
[1:03:55] fear fear is of the devil Everything
[1:03:57] Jesus would say fear not fear not
[1:03:59] constantly fear not fear not is that
[1:04:01] right always fear not now God don't want
[1:04:04] you to fear he wants you to believe so
[1:04:06] every one of you believe with one Accord
[1:04:09] one Accord every one of you
[1:04:13] with one Accord all be believed
[1:04:16] imagine if you got everybody that says
[1:04:19] they're a believer
[1:04:20] to fully believe the word of God how
[1:04:23] powerful we would be
[1:04:26] Satan would not be able to stand we had
[1:04:29] walked into we'd have a convention
[1:04:30] meeting and I would think it was was it
[1:04:34] funny
[1:04:36] all he had to do was walk down the
[1:04:37] street and people repented
[1:04:40] because he had such a relationship with
[1:04:41] the Lord that brought fear upon the
[1:04:43] people
[1:04:44] about repentance upon the people
[1:04:48] just walking down the street you know
[1:04:50] each and every one of us have that same
[1:04:51] ability we let laodicea get that out of
[1:04:54] us
[1:04:55] what makes us any difference in the
[1:04:56] church age Messengers what makes us any
[1:04:58] different than any great Christian that
[1:05:00] was out there whether it be moody
[1:05:02] whether it be funny whether it be
[1:05:03] Sweeney whether whatever whatever it was
[1:05:05] whether it be Wesley healing praying for
[1:05:08] a horse that was lameed and getting
[1:05:10] right up and going on what makes us any
[1:05:12] different than nothing everything that
[1:05:15] they did is at our fingertips
[1:05:18] we can live a life that is so close to
[1:05:20] Christ that people would see the glow
[1:05:22] coming off of us for miles around and
[1:05:25] Satan's demons would flee just because
[1:05:27] the presence of God is so strong in our
[1:05:29] life that they would be so afraid to
[1:05:31] come around us and people would just
[1:05:34] start repenting just coming into your
[1:05:36] presence that is possible for you
[1:05:39] but Satan's devised the world to get us
[1:05:42] so distracted and so we got to do this
[1:05:44] and we got to go out here and we gotta
[1:05:46] we gotta do this for this person over
[1:05:48] here and and we got this entertainment
[1:05:50] we want to do and and we go and we go
[1:05:52] when we go and we forget
[1:05:54] our first and foremost thing is we're
[1:05:56] the pride of Christ
[1:05:58] and our first our call is to be on
[1:06:02] display
[1:06:03] our cause to walk out on display to this
[1:06:06] world
[1:06:09] think about that think about that
[1:06:12] if you're not on display
[1:06:15] you're backsliding
[1:06:18] you need to repent of it now
[1:06:21] and there are times that all of us
[1:06:23] backslide mother Brown said he backslide
[1:06:26] it ten thousand times a day or whatever
[1:06:27] a thousand times a day
[1:06:29] of the prophet backslood
[1:06:32] who are we
[1:06:35] he walked in vision
[1:06:38] he'd walk the story he'd see a vision
[1:06:40] he knew that he knew that he knew who
[1:06:42] God was
[1:06:44] we don't walk in Visions a lot of time
[1:06:47] and we walk by faith so much we can
[1:06:50] question our faith at times
[1:06:51] We can question who we are when we start
[1:06:54] listening to the Enemy by cause we're
[1:06:56] not getting into the word of God how do
[1:06:59] you become Christ you get into the word
[1:07:00] of God how do you become Christ you get
[1:07:03] in the message of the hour you start
[1:07:04] reading it you don't have to understand
[1:07:06] it
[1:07:08] you just get in that presence
[1:07:11] and when you have time and need of it
[1:07:14] he'll bring it back to you remember us
[1:07:17] you don't have to be a minister to get
[1:07:19] into the word of God and to read the
[1:07:20] message and all that you don't have to
[1:07:22] be able to break it down like a minister
[1:07:24] can
[1:07:25] you don't have to be able to break it
[1:07:26] down like brother Brandon did all he's
[1:07:28] asking you is to get into his presence
[1:07:31] when you sit there with your husband or
[1:07:33] your wife and a lot of times you get in
[1:07:34] the presence all you do is sit and you
[1:07:36] listen
[1:07:38] you may not say a single thing
[1:07:42] or he may just both sit there and you're
[1:07:44] just in the presence of each other
[1:07:46] and in that presence you're learning
[1:07:47] each other you're learning what the she
[1:07:49] likes she's learning what you like
[1:07:52] and but if you get busy sometimes you
[1:07:54] forget
[1:07:56] what they like
[1:07:57] sometimes you forget what Christ's like
[1:07:59] sometimes you forget that you are a
[1:08:01] Christ child and then that liar called
[1:08:04] fear
[1:08:05] can come around
[1:08:07] can influence your mind tell you you're
[1:08:10] not his tell you you're not saved tell
[1:08:11] your you're lost tell you're not healed
[1:08:14] tell you're going to die tomorrow tell
[1:08:15] you that you're blasphemy whatever it is
[1:08:18] fear he is a liar
[1:08:24] there's no need the Christian people
[1:08:26] seem to be back in a corner oh I'm
[1:08:29] afraid
[1:08:30] and this is from God's covenant with
[1:08:32] Abraham and his seed in 1956.
[1:08:35] why you ought to be the most freest
[1:08:37] people in the world
[1:08:38] oh brother Brown
[1:08:41] would I get in the millennium
[1:08:45] I ain't waiting for the Millennium I am
[1:08:48] right now
[1:08:51] we don't have to wait it is ours now all
[1:08:55] that was in Christ he pulled he has
[1:08:57] poured into us a lot of people they say
[1:09:00] oh I'll wait to the next Revival oh I'll
[1:09:02] wait until God does some kind of
[1:09:04] Supernatural side of my life no waiting
[1:09:06] you don't have to wait
[1:09:08] we don't have to wait until we're in a
[1:09:10] perfect body to know what Christ is we
[1:09:13] don't have to wait to know that the
[1:09:14] promises are you do not have to wait
[1:09:16] till tomorrow to get your healing you do
[1:09:18] not have to wait to get set free from
[1:09:20] depression anxiety fear whatever it is

[1:16:34] oh but we listened to that demon of
[1:16:36] Torment
[1:16:38] whether it's in that demon of fear I
[1:16:39] listen to demon of fear for as many
[1:16:40] years
[1:16:47] a little testimony
[1:16:57] yeah we're warm
[1:17:02] I walked around in fear
[1:17:05] for years
[1:17:07] even preaching
[1:17:09] I was in fear
[1:17:11] I thought I was lost
[1:17:13] I thought I'd sin too much went away
[1:17:15] went too far across the line and all
[1:17:18] that
[1:17:18] and I walked with that demon of fear on
[1:17:20] my shoulder every single day
[1:17:22] I'd get up and that he was there I'd lay
[1:17:25] down he was there and I would give him a
[1:17:27] little room here and I made a little
[1:17:29] room for him I guess
[1:17:30] to come on into my life
[1:17:33] come on into my life
[1:17:35] and you know what
[1:17:37] I would read the scriptures in Hebrews
[1:17:38] chapter 6. they knew the truth and
[1:17:41] walked away
[1:17:42] and that really didn't fit me or heated
[1:17:44] into verse 10 26 he the senateth
[1:17:47] willfully
[1:17:48] oh man I would do I was to a point where
[1:17:51] listening to messages I was in the
[1:17:53] messages I knew that wasn't an end or
[1:17:55] knew of somebody that wasn't
[1:17:57] condemned all that I mean Satan had me
[1:18:00] wrapped around his finger
[1:18:03] and I remember sitting at
[1:18:05] I was going to work and I had a I had a
[1:18:08] nervous breakdown
[1:18:09] we'll just put it that way
[1:18:11] I had a nervous breakdown
[1:18:13] and I thought I was lost
[1:18:15] I was on the phone calling my pastor I
[1:18:17] was on the phone doing this that and and
[1:18:19] for years
[1:18:21] instead of just letting it putting it
[1:18:22] aside
[1:18:23] when I knew I hadn't
[1:18:26] I kept bringing it up
[1:18:28] in my mind I keep playing to it I'd keep
[1:18:31] listening to it and you know when you
[1:18:33] keep listening to it
[1:18:34] it just stays there it doesn't go
[1:18:36] anywhere
[1:18:37] I remember sitting and I decided I was
[1:18:40] listening to all the messages I started
[1:18:42] in 65 I was working my way backwards
[1:18:45] and I was coming to the Hebrew series
[1:18:47] and I knew I was going to be coming up
[1:18:49] to
[1:18:50] it was time to listen to Hebrews chapter
[1:18:52] 6.
[1:18:53] as I I'm working I'm in a room by myself
[1:18:56] and I'm like
[1:18:58] I'm going to put this on and
[1:19:00] accidentally put on Hebrews chapter 7
[1:19:02] instead of six
[1:19:04] I was like
[1:19:05] you got another day you don't have to
[1:19:08] face that fear
[1:19:10] and I get in the van to go and I've got
[1:19:12] an hour and a half drive back to Lima
[1:19:14] I'm working in Columbus Ohio at Ohio
[1:19:16] State
[1:19:17] I got an hour and a half drive to go
[1:19:21] and
[1:19:23] Lord's like no you're listening to
[1:19:25] Hebrews 6 today
[1:19:27] I'm like no and I was refusing
[1:19:31] I was at for that much fear
[1:19:35] and he uh I stopped to get gas and you
[1:19:39] know when the Lord wants you to do
[1:19:40] something he'll make it unbearable
[1:19:43] it's finally I put the Hebrews 6 on
[1:19:48] that was my Deliverance
[1:19:51] I faced the fear
[1:19:53] I listened to it and they're like that
[1:19:55] has nothing to do with me
[1:19:59] and I was just afraid
[1:20:01] I let some little demon of fear sitting
[1:20:04] on my shoulder
[1:20:05] tell me did it go completely away then
[1:20:08] he'd come back and try
[1:20:11] he comes back and tries but I recognize
[1:20:14] it
[1:20:15] and like you say guilty behind me
[1:20:18] guilty behind me
[1:20:20] you think of
[1:20:21] you think of David
[1:20:25] I was in the Bible said I was telling
[1:20:27] brother Dale I do this devotional with
[1:20:30] some non-denominational and
[1:20:32] denominational
[1:20:33] I think there's a Catholic in there I do
[1:20:36] a devotional in the morning I was
[1:20:37] invited to join in
[1:20:40] read a devotional and then we discuss it
[1:20:45] and
[1:20:48] so
[1:20:50] it's kind of interesting because you get
[1:20:51] to hear a lot of different perspectives
[1:20:53] and then they're hearing a lot of stuff
[1:20:54] they've probably never heard before
[1:20:56] they have been introduced to the Statue
[1:20:58] of a perfume man
[1:21:00] yeah
[1:21:02] they were talking about fear
[1:21:04] was it fear or was it
[1:21:06] had to do with fear
[1:21:08] the good thing about David
[1:21:11] he come into the camp of the Israelites
[1:21:14] the Israelites
[1:21:16] were at war with the Philistines
[1:21:18] and they were afraid
[1:21:21] they were scared to death
[1:21:23] they had some Giants in their life they
[1:21:25] had some Giants of anxiety they had some
[1:21:27] Giants of of cancer they had some Giants
[1:21:30] of not being saved they had some Giants
[1:21:32] and not having the Holy Ghost in their
[1:21:33] lives
[1:21:34] and they were trying to work their their
[1:21:37] courage up and all that Here Comes This
[1:21:39] little tiny Shepherd boy
[1:21:41] into town
[1:21:42] he'd been out on the back side of the
[1:21:44] desert
[1:21:45] he had been listening to the Seven Seals
[1:21:48] he had been looking at the church ages
[1:21:49] he had been reading the message of the
[1:21:51] hour he'd been reading in his Bible it
[1:21:53] had been reading our opening scripture
[1:21:55] where it says there is no fear and love
[1:21:59] is Christ
[1:22:01] and he's been out there and he had a few
[1:22:03] Giants come in his life trying to steal
[1:22:06] his happiness trying to steal his Joy
[1:22:08] trying to steal his little children and
[1:22:10] he got out there and he he killed him
[1:22:12] and here he comes in and he hears this
[1:22:14] giant this giant of doubt in the camp
[1:22:17] this giant of fear in a camp proclaiming
[1:22:20] how he's going to beat the Israelites
[1:22:22] down
[1:22:22] he goes why aren't you guys doing this
[1:22:24] evening you imagine he's been he's been
[1:22:26] in the word he's prayed up he's been
[1:22:30] looking at it
[1:22:31] he's been watching it he's been that's
[1:22:34] his whole life has been just wrapped
[1:22:35] around that and he's been in the word
[1:22:38] every day and all of a sudden he comes
[1:22:40] in and these Israelites had gotten out
[1:22:42] of the out of the word and got out of
[1:22:44] the out of the line with Jehovah and
[1:22:47] they let a little fear of a giant of
[1:22:49] fear came into their camp and he steps
[1:22:52] forward and says I'll go fight him
[1:22:55] why because he had been in the word
[1:22:58] because he'd been listening to the
[1:23:00] message
[1:23:01] and when fear presented itself he could
[1:23:03] stand boldly before it
[1:23:06] and he could take the five stones of
[1:23:08] Jesus the five stones of Faith the five
[1:23:12] stones that that never all smooth that
[1:23:15] had made him and he could sit there and
[1:23:16] all he had to do was launch one Dart
[1:23:19] take that out
[1:23:21] and he didn't stop there either
[1:23:23] he said I'm tired of this fear I'm tired
[1:23:25] of this doubt I'm tired of the
[1:23:26] suppression I'm tired of this anxiety
[1:23:29] he said I'm going to take the enemy's
[1:23:31] word and I'm going to take that sword of
[1:23:33] his word and I'm going to cut his head
[1:23:35] off with his own his own devices I have
[1:23:39] no fear of you and he took that sword
[1:23:41] the enemy sword that seemed to be a
[1:23:43] giant sword bigger than him he took that
[1:23:45] fear like I I looked into my fear when I
[1:23:48] listened to Hebrews chapter 6 I stopped
[1:23:50] and I looked into that fear and I
[1:23:52] stepped into that fear and I took that
[1:23:54] same fear that he was trying to heap of
[1:23:56] me and I defeated the enemy that way
[1:23:59] David walked up to the that big giant of
[1:24:02] doubt that big giant of fear and took
[1:24:05] the fear that he was trying to kill him
[1:24:07] with and slew him for good once and for
[1:24:10] all you can do that this morning all you
[1:24:13] have to do is step into it all you have
[1:24:15] to do is accept it all you have to do is
[1:24:19] believe it quit listening to the enemy's
[1:24:21] doubts listening to what he tells you
[1:24:25] know he says he's given us a place of
[1:24:28] rest
[1:24:29] in Psalms 27 it says the Lord is my
[1:24:31] light and my salvation of Whom Shall I
[1:24:33] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:24:34] of whom shall I be afraid when the
[1:24:36] wicked even mine enemies and my foes
[1:24:38] Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they
[1:24:40] stumbled and they fell Satan can't even
[1:24:42] stand against you if you're in the word
[1:24:44] if you're hidden in his presence if you
[1:24:46] hidden your life in his word he will
[1:24:48] stumble and he will fall he will try to
[1:24:50] get you down but he will stumble and he
[1:24:51] fall he cannot get a stronghold in your
[1:24:53] life when you are in the word when you
[1:24:55] are bathing in The Lord of Jesus Christ
[1:24:57] and you have taken on all him he cannot
[1:24:59] get to you
[1:25:02] he'll come up and he'll try to eat your
[1:25:04] flesh you'll try to eat your mind he'll
[1:25:05] try to take your joy he'll try to take
[1:25:07] your happiness away he'll try to take
[1:25:09] all that from you but he has to he'll
[1:25:10] stumble he'll fall when you hide
[1:25:12] yourself in the word of God
[1:25:14] though a whole should can't and he'll go
[1:25:17] back and get more enemies more demons
[1:25:19] and try to come at you on different
[1:25:20] different angles and all this and and
[1:25:23] all of a sudden you're all messed up and
[1:25:25] all that but if you stand there in his
[1:25:27] word he says though a host shouldn't
[1:25:29] Camp against him and my heart shall not
[1:25:31] fear
[1:25:32] your flesh May fear your mind may be
[1:25:35] fearful of all that but your heart your
[1:25:38] soul it won't be afraid
[1:25:40] death comes knocking on your door
[1:25:42] the Satan's trying to make you afraid
[1:25:44] you're ready to go you're ready to walk
[1:25:47] through that door you're happy you're
[1:25:49] joy and he can't understand why you're
[1:25:50] not afraid and you're shaking and all
[1:25:52] that
[1:25:53] when cancer comes to your life and
[1:25:55] you're not afraid of it and you're
[1:25:56] sitting there saying I'm Healed I'm
[1:25:57] Healed I'm Healed when depression comes
[1:25:59] to your life and you just take a stand
[1:26:00] against it and you rise up and you
[1:26:02] become happy and he starts to tell you
[1:26:04] you can't do this and that and you
[1:26:05] refuse him and you look back at him
[1:26:08] he doesn't understand it
[1:26:10] says my heart shall not fear the war
[1:26:12] should rise against me and that's why
[1:26:13] I'd be confident one thing I desired of
[1:26:15] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[1:26:17] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:26:19] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:26:21] of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for
[1:26:23] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:26:25] in his Pavilion and the secret of his
[1:26:27] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:26:29] me up upon a rock and now shall my head
[1:26:31] be lifted up by mine enemies round about
[1:26:33] me therefore will I offer in his
[1:26:36] Tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[1:26:38] I will sing yea I will sing praises unto
[1:26:42] the Lord
[1:26:49] don't give you
[1:26:51] the unconditional Covenant that God made
[1:26:53] with people don't give you permission to
[1:26:55] sin now remember that but I'm trying to
[1:26:57] get this fear knocked out of you you're
[1:26:59] always scared about something don't be
[1:27:01] scared God has promised God has to do it
[1:27:03] if you believe it if you're the Seed of
[1:27:05] Abraham someone said to me like the
[1:27:07] Baptist friends used to say what
[1:27:08] difference does it make the one that
[1:27:11] went off into eternal security they said
[1:27:12] why why don't make any difference to me
[1:27:15] I'm saved glory to God I can do what I
[1:27:17] want to do that doesn't show you're
[1:27:19] saved that's right that just shows that
[1:27:21] you're not saved that's right that's
[1:27:23] right if you're saved you don't want to
[1:27:24] do those things that's right so there
[1:27:27] that's not the fear of whether you
[1:27:28] believe God and are his out of you
[1:27:32] if you don't want to do it you're his
[1:27:35] means you're saved
[1:27:38] you must be born again what do we do
[1:27:40] what do we got to fear about we should
[1:27:43] be the freest happiest people there is
[1:27:45] anywhere and we don't have to guess
[1:27:47] about it God's in our midst and proves
[1:27:49] it that's right and it's according to
[1:27:51] his word and his spirit
[1:27:56] but when you this is in expectation but
[1:27:58] when you stand under Divine promise of
[1:28:00] God
[1:28:01] there is no fear in God that's right
[1:28:03] it's bound to be it's perfect it's never
[1:28:05] failed it will never fail because God
[1:28:08] cannot lie
[1:28:18] Fury is a liar he will take your breath
[1:28:21] stop you in your steps fear he is a liar
[1:28:25] he will rob you of your rest steal your
[1:28:27] happiness cast your fear in the fire
[1:28:29] what fire the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:33] you cast your fear into the Holy Ghost
[1:28:37] because fear he is a liar they told you
[1:28:39] you were troubled
[1:28:40] you'll forever be alone
[1:28:43] no the presence of Christ is with me
[1:28:45] wheresoever I shall go
[1:28:47] I'm never alone
[1:28:49] but he'll try to isolate you and make
[1:28:51] you feel like God doesn't love you
[1:28:53] and that you are alone
[1:28:55] when he told you you should run away
[1:28:58] you'll never find a home oh how many
[1:29:00] times has he told you you should just
[1:29:01] walk away from the word God doesn't love
[1:29:03] you the people don't love you this
[1:29:05] person doesn't love you you'd be better
[1:29:07] off in the world and you'd have more
[1:29:08] friends in the world and and you'd be
[1:29:10] able to go to this party to do whatever
[1:29:11] you'd hang out with them
[1:29:15] he's told you you should run away
[1:29:18] he'll never find a home but I found a
[1:29:20] home in Christ
[1:29:22] my life has never been the same
[1:29:24] I would never know
[1:29:27] this church here if I hadn't found
[1:29:29] Christ
[1:29:30] and I feel just as home here as I do at
[1:29:32] my home Church
[1:29:36] when he told you you should run away you
[1:29:38] should never find a home when he told
[1:29:40] you you were dirty and you should be
[1:29:41] ashamed
[1:29:42] oh
[1:29:43] I was dirty once
[1:29:45] that I was washing the blood of Christ
[1:29:47] and I'm not ashamed of that blood
[1:29:51] when he told you it could be the one
[1:29:52] that Grace could never change
[1:29:54] I'll just look back at your life
[1:29:56] see where you were see where you're at
[1:29:58] today
[1:29:59] Grace has changed
[1:30:11] you think about shamgar
[1:30:14] everybody remember shamgar the little
[1:30:16] farmer
[1:30:18] fitting story for
[1:30:19] a pastor here
[1:30:23] the farmer shamgar
[1:30:27] he raised some grains and all that for
[1:30:29] his family they eat and all that
[1:30:32] but the Philistines every year would
[1:30:34] come in and take his happiness
[1:30:37] take his Joy try to take his life try to
[1:30:40] take everything that he had
[1:30:42] he got tired of it one day
[1:30:45] he said enough is enough
[1:30:48] and all he did is he took just what he
[1:30:50] had there a little Ox ago
[1:30:52] it's a little stick here 600 demons
[1:30:55] coming at him 600 Philistines coming at
[1:30:57] him he said I've had enough
[1:31:00] and he took that Ox go to Faith and all
[1:31:03] it takes is a little Mustard Seed of
[1:31:04] faith
[1:31:05] there it says the Mustard Seed if you
[1:31:07] had
[1:31:08] Faith the size of a mustard seed you
[1:31:09] could say to this mountain be plucked up
[1:31:11] and be thou removed and cast over here
[1:31:14] all sudden you got to get mad enough of
[1:31:17] that demon in your life
[1:31:19] you got to get tired of it enough that
[1:31:22] you're willing to stand there and die
[1:31:26] no matter what it takes you stand there
[1:31:28] if you got to be at the altar for three
[1:31:29] days straight
[1:31:30] you stay there
[1:31:32] you got to be in prayer for three days
[1:31:34] straight you stay there whatever it is
[1:31:37] you stay there don't just stop when it
[1:31:40] first starts to tingle don't get up but
[1:31:42] make sure you go all the way
[1:31:46] man I would I going back I think I
[1:31:49] mentioned it Wednesday
[1:31:50] when
[1:31:52] Satan was he was hounding me you don't
[1:31:54] have the Holy Spirit you don't have the
[1:31:56] Holy Spirit and you're going to have to
[1:31:57] get up there and you're going to have to
[1:31:58] walk in front of that group of people
[1:32:00] and you're gonna have to be embarrassed
[1:32:01] you're a minister and all this and and
[1:32:03] you're going to have to go up to before
[1:32:04] your pastor and tell them that you're
[1:32:06] battling this and all that and I
[1:32:08] remember the first time I tried to get
[1:32:10] rid of it
[1:32:11] I stayed for a few seconds a little
[1:32:13] emotion
[1:32:15] I get up and it was still there
[1:32:18] but this last time
[1:32:23] we had a prayer line
[1:32:25] and I said now or never
[1:32:28] I want to battle this all the rest of my
[1:32:30] life or
[1:32:31] or I'm going to go humble myself and I'm
[1:32:33] going to go before the congregation
[1:32:35] and I'm going to go off to brother Wayne
[1:32:37] I'm going to say I'm battling with this

[1:33:23] your brother's not going to do it he can
[1:33:25] pray and put his shoulder against you
[1:33:27] but you have to be willing to die to
[1:33:29] yourself and put it before God and let
[1:33:32] him come in and do it shamgar decided
