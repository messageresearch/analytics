[16:49] Christ.
[16:51] [Music]
[17:05] Even when we don't feel good, he's still
[17:07] good.
[17:09] Amen.
[17:16] John 10:7.
[17:19] Amen. And I want to preach on
[17:23] something that
[17:25] has been on my heart for a while and and
[17:28] uh this is going to be a probably a part
[17:33] one of part two. I believe next week
[17:35] we'll preach on it the same thing. But
[17:38] uh just God wants to make sure we
[17:41] understand him correctly. I think I
[17:43] believe that. Amen. And I want to preach
[17:46] on grace.
[17:48] Amen.
[17:50] John 10:7-11. And then Jesus said unto
[17:53] them again, verily, verily, I say unto
[17:56] you, that I am the door of the sheep,
[18:00] and all whoever came be
[18:03] thieves and robbers, but the sheep do
[18:06] not hear them.
[18:08] But I am the door,
[18:12] and by me if any man enter in, he shall
[18:14] be saved and shall go in and out and
[18:18] find pastures. Lord Jesus, we pray that
[18:20] you'll add the blessing to your word
[18:23] this morning. Bless your bride. And Lord
[18:25] God, just be a man ministering, Lord
[18:29] God, but may it be your your thoughts
[18:31] from heaven. and may somehow the hearer
[18:34] pick up that spirit
[18:36] of what you're trying to say to us,
[18:38] Jesus. And we give you the glory and
[18:40] honor for it in your name. Amen. Amen.
[18:43] You may have your seats this morning.
[18:45] Amen. I want to read that verse 9 again.
[18:48] Here's Jesus talking. He said, "I am the
[18:50] door and by me if any man enter in,
[18:55] he shall be saved."
[18:58] Period.
[19:01] Amen. Amen. And he shall go in and out
[19:06] and find pastures. You know, let's just
[19:08] look over to lay a foundation a bit. And
[19:11] and this, you know, I it it's it's it
[19:14] just really the message really grew when
[19:17] you look into the mercy and grace of God
[19:20] is just it's just overwhelming in our
[19:23] day. But Romans 8:33 and 34, whom shall
[19:27] lay anything to the
[19:31] God's elect?
[19:34] It's God that justify you.
[19:38] We We need to be really careful with
[19:40] that because if brothers and sisters
[19:43] don't measure up to your own personal
[19:45] conviction, you need to just leave it
[19:48] alone.
[19:50] Amen. And it's all right. We all have
[19:52] our own personal convictions. You might
[19:54] like wearing a white shirt on Sunday or
[19:56] you might like, you know, something like
[19:59] that. You might not like wearing a watch
[20:01] on Sunday or whatever. And if God give
[20:04] you that conviction, you hang on to it.
[20:06] You go to your grave with it. But don't
[20:09] share it to me. Don't share it to me.
[20:13] Watch this. Who is he
[20:17] that condemnth?
[20:25] Wow.
[20:28] It is Christ that died,
[20:31] not you.
[20:36] Ra, yay. Rather, it's he's raised again.
[20:40] And who even is at the right hand of
[20:42] God, which we know that's power, who
[20:44] also maketh intercession
[20:46] for us.
[20:49] Who shall lay any? Who shall who is he
[20:53] that condemnth? You know, if we're not
[20:56] careful as Christians and believers, you
[20:58] know, we can go out and and have parties
[21:00] and and fellowship, and we should. We
[21:02] should do that all the time. You can't
[21:04] fellowship too much with believers. You
[21:06] should learn to be yearn to be together
[21:09] with believers.
[21:11] But if we're not careful, the
[21:12] conversation will turn because we're in
[21:15] flesh bodies and we're humans and we
[21:18] have our our own convictions are dear to
[21:20] us. It will turn to somebody that don't
[21:25] have the same convictions as us.
[21:33] That's right.
[21:36] And we mention it that their conviction
[21:39] is different than us. Yeah. Do you know
[21:42] that in the Bible it was God that told
[21:45] Peter, I said, "Blessed are you, Simon
[21:46] by Jonah, for flesh and blood didn't
[21:48] reveal this unto you, but my father
[21:50] which is in heaven, and upon this rock
[21:53] of revelation will I build my church."
[21:56] You know, you can't show nobody nothing
[22:00] except God do it. It's God's revelation
[22:03] to anybody. Okay? So, you God's got this
[22:07] huge family and they're all on different
[22:10] levels.
[22:11] But they're still God's family. You
[22:14] know, there's different levels in
[22:15] heaven. There's servants in heaven and
[22:17] there's the the the queens in heaven and
[22:20] there's all these different things
[22:21] that'll be in heaven, but they're still
[22:24] in heaven.
[22:31] Who is he that condemnth?
[22:35] It was Christ that died. Yeah.
[22:38] Like, I wonder if Brother Dale would
[22:41] condemn somebody that Christ died for,
[22:43] what Christ would think of that. I know
[22:46] I've been guilty of that in the past.
[22:49] 100%.
[22:52] And I imagine if you're breathing this
[22:54] morning, if possible, you might have not
[22:57] have been as guilty as I have been many
[22:59] times. But probably if you're breathing
[23:02] maybe even once or twice in your life,
[23:05] you might have crossed that line, too.
[23:09] You know, let me read what the prophet
[23:10] said. He said, "Now works are fine, but
[23:12] they don't save you." And he said, "They
[23:15] don't make you perfect. It's Christ or
[23:18] parish."
[23:20] And he said, "It's not even Christ and
[23:22] my works."
[23:24] Watch this. I'm going to I'm going to go
[23:26] out on a limb here. This ain't to offend
[23:28] you. I I believe 100% that God sent a
[23:31] message in this age that blessed us
[23:33] above every age in the Bible and sent a
[23:36] prophet and revealed himself perfectly.
[23:38] But it's not even Christ and this
[23:40] message.
[23:43] Even those message is Christ.
[23:46] Because there will be people in heaven
[23:47] that don't believe this message, it'll
[23:49] be in heaven.
[23:52] That's right. There's people that go
[23:53] through the tribulation that don't
[23:54] believe this message and they're going
[23:56] to be in heaven. There were the ones in
[23:58] Revelation 7 that John said, "Who are
[24:00] who are this huge multitude that got
[24:03] white robes?" And brother Bam said, John
[24:06] didn't know them because they weren't
[24:08] Jews.
[24:11] They were the people that you meet in
[24:12] the grocery store. And they love Jesus
[24:16] as much as the revelation God took them
[24:18] to. And they may go through the
[24:20] tribulation, but they're going to be
[24:22] sitting in heaven right beside you.
[24:24] Yeah.
[24:26] And we say, "Bless God, they don't
[24:27] believe what I believe."
[24:32] Who is he that condemnth?
[24:36] Did you die for them?
[24:40] He said, "It's Christ alone. The age
[24:42] began years ago."
[24:44] And uh and it was Christ. They didn't
[24:48] believe in Christ as a full reality.
[24:51] And it does not. And and so when they
[24:54] would worship God, it was it's nothing
[24:58] but the blood. They wouldn't sing like
[25:00] that. They would sing it's nothing but
[25:02] the blood
[25:05] and my conduct. But that's not true.
[25:12] Amen.
[25:13] Now, I'm going to shock you. And if and
[25:15] if this offends you, I can I mean you if
[25:17] you're here today, you need to be here
[25:19] next Sunday. Amen. cuz I can't pin down
[25:22] every clarifications.
[25:24] You know, Brother Bram said multiple
[25:26] times that the people that give their
[25:28] life in the tribulation were part of the
[25:30] bride.
[25:42] He didn't say that we sink nothing but
[25:44] the blood in this message. All the rest
[25:46] is lost. No. That means 144,000 wouldn't
[25:50] be saved. That means there wouldn't be
[25:52] no foolish version.
[25:55] That would mean there'd be none to go in
[25:56] the tribulation.
[26:01] And so we rate people based on their
[26:05] belief. And God don't like that. That's
[26:08] why he put it, why are you condemning? I
[26:10] was the one that died.
[26:12] Yeah, that's right.
[26:16] He said, "I believe in good conduct. I
[26:18] believe in holiness."
[26:21] And you know, salvation is not Jesus
[26:23] plus. It's Jesus alone. Period. It's
[26:27] just Jesus. It's Jesus they nailed on
[26:31] the cross.
[26:33] That's right. Salvation is of the Lord
[26:36] from start to finish. Yes, sir. That's
[26:40] right. From start to finish, it's
[26:42] salvation. is God's. And you know, in
[26:46] Genesis 1:26 and 27, we came from the
[26:49] sight of God. God made us in his image.
[26:52] I want to show you something. If we're
[26:53] in the image of God, then Christians of
[26:56] all stages have to have the
[26:58] characteristics of God. Now, you see in
[27:01] the Bible that even God, that's why
[27:04] that's why you shouldn't be too hard on
[27:06] yourself. If you condemn somebody,
[27:12] God will forgive you.
[27:18] Because you know in the Bible, God
[27:19] condemned people one time.
[27:23] Even God did and they were his chosen
[27:27] elect people.
[27:29] Uhoh, I'm losing some of you.
[27:33] God cursed the children of Israel in the
[27:36] wilderness and he said they're nothing
[27:38] but a bunch of religious stiff neck
[27:42] and a whole bunch of stuff. I'm way
[27:44] ahead of my notes cuz I'd get lost
[27:46] finding it.
[27:48] And Moses stepped in the gap and he
[27:52] said, "God, if you're going to kill the
[27:54] children of Israel, you're going to kill
[27:56] me, too." That's right. But we wouldn't
[27:58] say that today.
[28:01] We'd say, "Well, they don't go to our
[28:02] church." What' you expect? Oh,
[28:06] we'd say, "Well, they don't believe the
[28:08] prophet and how I believe it. So, what
[28:10] do you expect? Of course, God's going to
[28:11] kill them." Well, wait a minute. Wait a
[28:14] minute. In that scripture,
[28:17] Brother Brennham said that Moses, now
[28:21] you better be sitting down because
[28:23] you're going to fall down when I tell
[28:24] you this. Moses.
[28:27] Moses.
[28:30] And he never had the Holy Ghost. It
[28:31] wasn't given yet. Had a better thought
[28:34] than God.
[28:40] And that was to save people.
[28:43] You know, I'm going to give you a really
[28:44] new idea. Christians shouldn't be
[28:47] murderers.
[28:50] That's right. That's a very new thought,
[28:51] Brother Steve. Christians are not
[28:53] supposed to go around seeing how they
[28:55] could kill. You know, brother B said the
[28:58] only thing with value in this world is
[29:00] souls.
[29:01] I don't care if they believe it like you
[29:03] believe it. Souls.
[29:06] The Bible says if you believe on the
[29:08] Lord Jesus Christ, ye shall
[29:12] be saved.
[29:14] Period. Oh, you might not go in the
[29:16] rapture. I believe the message believers
[29:18] will go in the rapture or whatever. But
[29:20] the B you can't contradict the Bible.
[29:24] That's right. You know, brother Bam said
[29:26] soul winning is the only value in the
[29:29] world. Your whole life should be to win
[29:32] souls. He never said to message
[29:35] believers.
[29:37] Do you know people came to brother
[29:38] Brandham and they came to him, they
[29:40] said, "We're going to we're going to
[29:42] disassociate with you cuz you let a man
[29:44] sit on the platform that was a sinner."
[29:48] And he said, 'Oh, I'm sorry. He said,
[29:51] 'Who was it?' And they said, 'Well, it
[29:53] was this Baptist preacher, and he's
[29:55] baptized in the Trinity, and he's not
[29:57] baptized. The Bible says if you're
[29:59] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:01] Christ, you shall receive the gift of
[30:03] the Holy Ghost.
[30:07] I believe that. But don't put God in the
[30:10] box because brother Bram was a prophet
[30:14] and he forced he could see into that
[30:16] man's heart and he looked at that
[30:18] hypocrite and he said that man has the
[30:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[30:25] How's that possible? He had a trinity
[30:26] baptism. Yeah.
[30:32] One man was drawing him out of the
[30:34] circle. Yeah. And brother Brandham was
[30:35] drawing him in the circle. And he was a
[30:37] trinitarian.
[30:39] And brother Bram said he had the baptism
[30:41] of the Holy Ghost. Even brother D would
[30:43] choke on that a little bit.
[30:46] Yeah.
[30:47] Who is he
[30:50] that condemnth? You know what brother
[30:52] said in that quote? He said, "You can
[30:53] draw me out of your circle, but I'm just
[30:55] going to draw another circle and I draw
[30:56] us all back in together." Amen. You
[30:59] know, we got we we we got this spirit of
[31:01] of kill in our ranks.
[31:05] I don't care the people that go to the
[31:06] Baptist church or the people's church or
[31:09] or the Pentecost. Praise God they go
[31:11] there.
[31:13] They may be go, you know, they can't
[31:15] come to a revelation different than what
[31:17] Christ gave them. It's impossible.
[31:21] So if they came here, they'd just be a
[31:23] hypocrite cuz they would just be putting
[31:26] on a tie. Oh, it's choking me this
[31:28] morning.
[31:30] What's that mean?
[31:32] If God called them to be in the Baptist
[31:34] church, praise God, they're in the
[31:36] Baptist church. Le
[31:43] Oh, I get it. We're in a competition.
[31:50] We want to have the most numbers.
[31:54] Oh, popularity. That's it.
[31:58] We want to be more. You know, you're
[32:00] going to fall down in the next two
[32:02] weeks. The stuff I'm going to show you
[32:06] that the prophet said and the Bible,
[32:10] I just want to give you
[32:12] just jump way ahead and tell you grace
[32:15] is still available in full flow.
[32:20] In full flow. There is more grace in
[32:23] this world than the world could ever
[32:25] use.
[32:27] There's more mercy in this world than
[32:30] will ever be used.
[32:32] And to put it real plain and simple, the
[32:35] grace is here until God turns his eyes
[32:39] back to the Jews and the Gentiles go in
[32:42] a rapture. Period.
[32:45] Period. Praise God. That's right.
[32:50] And if you take grace away from anybody,
[32:53] you're anointed of the devil.
[32:56] That's right.
[33:00] Period. In what world would you not want
[33:03] your kids to do well?
[33:06] In what world what what world would that
[33:08] be? You'd be a loser of a parent. In
[33:12] what world would God not want the whole
[33:14] world to be saved?
[33:17] That's right. But you think differently.
[33:19] Well, they don't wear a tie on Sunday.
[33:21] Bless God.
[33:25] or they don't wear
[33:31] help us. Amen. Amen. Oh, I believe
[33:34] there's things we need to follow in the
[33:36] Bible. I believe in holiness. I was
[33:38] raised in holiness.
[33:40] Yeah, that's right. But Moses wrote law.
[33:43] Yeah. Paul wrote grace.
[33:47] And we're in a grace dispensation. Amen.
[33:50] And I can show you where God give grace.
[33:53] And there ain't nobody alive could show
[33:55] me where God took it away.
[33:58] That's right. Yes, sir.
[34:05] And the people, you can't even come to a
[34:08] stage where God don't allow you.
[34:16] I I I Wow. Let me I I got a quote I'd
[34:19] love to read, but I don't want to I'll
[34:21] get mixed up here.
[34:23] You know in many countries and you know
[34:27] India different countries foreign
[34:28] countries the bridegroom when you come
[34:31] to the wedding they furnish robes
[34:36] and I watch there's a purpose for this
[34:39] because when you get an invitation
[34:44] excuse me
[34:47] and you come to the wedding with your
[34:48] invitation
[34:51] now I'm going to shock you. Do you know
[34:54] the whole world has got an invitation?
[34:58] They won't accept it, but the whole
[35:00] world's got an invitation.
[35:02] Don't take their invitation away from
[35:04] them. Jesus never died for just the
[35:06] bride. That's disgusting.
[35:10] That's right.
[35:14] That means 144,000 couldn't be saved.
[35:16] The Jews, that means a foolish virgin
[35:19] couldn't be saved. Where do people find
[35:22] this stuff?
[35:27] They furnish your garment.
[35:30] And so, let me just prephrase what the
[35:32] prophet says here. Well, he says,
[35:35] "Whether you're rich or poor, slave or
[35:37] free, you all look the same."
[35:42] Oh,
[35:44] so you can't judge and different. So if
[35:46] you got a great revelation and there's
[35:49] just a child here that's got no
[35:51] revelation at all, they wear the same
[35:53] uniform.
[35:56] It's called Jesus Christ.
[35:59] And you can get a great big head, but
[36:01] you ain't no more special to God than
[36:03] the little child that's present this
[36:05] morning
[36:08] cuz they're wearing the same uniform
[36:12] in the wedding.
[36:14] This is what the prophet says. They're
[36:16] to make them all alike.
[36:18] And you have to be all alike. And you're
[36:22] going to say, watch what? Hang on. He
[36:25] said, you're going to say, well, bless
[36:26] God. I'm a Methodist or I'm a
[36:28] Presbyterian over here. And you ain't
[36:31] going nowhere in the first place. You
[36:35] got to come to the door of Jesus.
[36:40] Praise the Lord. Jesus is the door of
[36:42] the sheepfold. Oh yeah. You say, "Well,
[36:46] but I'm a Pentecostal.
[36:49] I have the gifts in my midst."
[36:52] He said, "That don't mean one thing." He
[36:55] said, "You come by one door." Yeah.
[36:58] That's right. I mean, we believe in
[37:00] gifts. Don't I'm just saying you all
[37:03] look the same.
[37:06] That's right.
[37:07] And if you come by that door,
[37:10] this is still the prophet, you'll get a
[37:13] robe.
[37:21] You know, Brother Brown talked about
[37:22] people that were so
[37:25] uh I'll say arrogant, I don't have this
[37:27] quote in front of me, that if it rained
[37:29] hard, they would drown because their
[37:30] nose was upside down.
[37:35] Yeah,
[37:37] grace.
[37:40] All were born in sin, shaped in
[37:41] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[37:43] lies.
[37:45] Grace. Let's see what the Bible says.
[37:47] John 5 24. Verily, verily, I say unto
[37:50] you, that he that heareth my word, and
[37:52] believeth on him that sent me has
[37:55] everlasting life,
[37:58] and shall not come into the
[38:00] condemnation,
[38:02] but pass from death unto life.
[38:06] Now, that's Bible.
[38:09] I don't put a lot of
[38:12] requirements on that.
[38:17] Am I reading that correctly?
[38:21] He that believeth
[38:25] my word and believeth on him that sent
[38:27] me has everlasting life
[38:32] and shall not come into the
[38:33] condemnation. So who is it he that
[38:36] condemnth? Well, bless God. You know, I
[38:39] seen them doing something and I couldn't
[38:41] do that. Well, wonderful. I'm glad you
[38:44] couldn't. That don't mean nothing to the
[38:47] other person.
[38:53] You know, we we don't all arrive at the
[38:55] same place.
[38:58] Do you know you know we're living in a
[39:00] very peculiar age in our age? You know,
[39:01] if you go to like a food factory and
[39:04] they make bagels for McDonald's or or
[39:07] any kind of stuff for McDonald's, if it
[39:09] ain't perfectly identical, they throw it
[39:10] in the garbage.
[39:13] Like if they're making something and
[39:15] it's just got a lump on it or anything,
[39:17] it's perfectly good food and there's
[39:20] thousands of people starving to death,
[39:22] but they throw it in the garbage. Yes,
[39:24] sir. That's what message believers do.
[39:27] They don't look like us. They don't talk
[39:29] like us. They don't act like us. They
[39:32] don't go to my church.
[39:34] So, we just throw them in the garbage.
[39:36] Wow. Yeah. Does God do that? No. Did God
[39:41] do that when you were not perfect? No.
[39:43] Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[39:48] Oh,
[39:51] that means your attitude is different
[39:53] than God's attitude.
[39:56] You know, God doesn't throw nobody in
[39:57] the garbage.
[40:00] Matter of fact, the people of the family
[40:02] that God came through was very scarred.
[40:06] Yep. That's right. prostitutes,
[40:09] murderers.
[40:11] That's right. I mean, he could have
[40:13] picked a lot of He could have come by
[40:15] the Levite family. Yeah.
[40:19] Why did God do that? He showed us a
[40:22] picture that who is he that condemnth?
[40:26] If you if you go to the ice cream store
[40:29] and there's another Christian there and
[40:31] they don't have the revelation that you
[40:33] got, is it their fault? No.
[40:38] Thank you, sister.
[40:40] No, it's amazing grace. It's amazing
[40:45] grace that God love you so much that he
[40:49] showed you the secrets
[40:52] of the inner chamber. Amen. And you
[40:55] bring out your judgment book and you
[40:58] say, "Uh,
[41:02] disgusting."
[41:04] That's right.
[41:10] John 6 37
[41:13] and we're going to go to 39:40. And I
[41:15] I'll tell you where we're at. All the
[41:17] Father has given me
[41:20] shall come to me.
[41:22] And him that cometh to me, I will in no
[41:25] wise cast out.
[41:29] That sounds like grace to me. Amen.
[41:34] That means if anybody just cry on the
[41:37] name of the Lord, you're going down the
[41:38] road and somebody pulls out in front of
[41:40] you going to be saying Jesus. Boom.
[41:43] They're saved.
[41:46] He said he wouldn't cast them out.
[41:49] I mean, what Bible do you want me to
[41:50] read? Do you got you got one that don't
[41:53] have this verse in it?
[41:58] How do you think the jailer rated beside
[42:01] Jesus?
[42:03] He was being killed by crucifixion on
[42:06] the cross as a thief.
[42:10] Hello, anybody here? He had read no
[42:13] message books. He had never read the
[42:16] Bible. Yeah. Just nod your head. He
[42:19] never read the Bible. He never read no
[42:20] message books. Never went to church. And
[42:22] he robbed.
[42:27] He never even really asked for
[42:29] forgiveness.
[42:31] He just said that man
[42:34] is the Christ.
[42:36] He never even said, "I'm sorry." Yeah.
[42:43] He would have never went through on our
[42:44] church doctrine. You know, you got to
[42:47] come so many times and you got to do so
[42:49] many of this
[42:51] and oh, oh, you know what? He was never
[42:54] baptized.
[42:57] Oh, he must be in hell for sure.
[43:01] He never had time to be baptized.
[43:04] Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Now, do I
[43:07] believe in baptism? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[43:08] Yeah. Yeah. I do. If you got time. Yeah.
[43:12] That's right. Yeah. But who is he that
[43:15] condemnth?
[43:19] It used to be me all the time.
[43:22] Oh boy. I recognize myself really good
[43:25] in my old pictures.
[43:28] That was
[43:30] Oh, it was I was so legalistic.
[43:36] Everybody was lost but me.
[43:41] Oh, that's the truth.
[43:44] But I believe that spirit's very
[43:45] healthy.
[43:48] Oh, I got something nobody else has got.
[43:50] Well, praise God you do. Who give it to
[43:52] you? God. Well, thank him for it.
[43:57] God chose to give it to you over all the
[43:59] world.
[44:03] Amazing.
[44:07] Sorry. John uh 6:39.
[44:14] And this is of the Father's will which
[44:16] he has sent me,
[44:19] that of all which he hath given me, I
[44:22] shall lose none. nothing, but shall
[44:26] raise him up again in the last days. 40
[44:28] verse 40. And this is the will of him
[44:31] that sent me that everyone that seeth
[44:33] the son, and believeth on him may have
[44:37] everlasting life, and I will raise him
[44:41] up in the last days.
[44:44] Yes, sir. What do you read into that?
[44:49] that says that you see the son, you ne
[44:52] recognize Jesus Christ as the savior
[44:56] and you have everlasting life.
[45:00] Period.
[45:03] God can God has brought the bride to a
[45:05] greater revelation than that.
[45:08] But don't throw out these people.
[45:11] That's right.
[45:13] Watch here. And events made clear by
[45:16] prophecy. He said, "I'll make one
[45:18] place." He said, "The door." This is the
[45:21] prophet talking at 65, the month he
[45:23] died.
[45:25] He said, "You don't worship me in every
[45:27] door."
[45:29] He said, "That I've given you." He said,
[45:32] "But there's one door, and in that one
[45:36] door, I'll put my name. And where the
[45:39] Lord puts his name is the place that God
[45:41] will receive your sacrifice."
[45:43] And you made all kinds of doors. Oh, now
[45:47] we're talking. We made all kinds of
[45:50] doors, but God made a door.
[45:55] God made a door. He repeats that. And
[45:59] that door was St. John 10.
[46:03] I am the door.
[46:06] Jesus is the door.
[46:09] Help me out, Jared. I'm all tied up.
[46:14] Oh, I may have got it.
[46:17] Sorry. It's roasting in here.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:22] Jesus, I am the door.
[46:29] We have to invest in the fan, honey.
[46:34] Amen. Yeah. Now, I know Jesus came and
[46:38] brought us greater revelation,
[46:42] but that ain't for everybody,
[46:46] but they'll still be in heaven. You're
[46:49] going to find out next Sunday if you
[46:50] don't this one.
[46:53] He said, "Now, you read John 10, and we
[46:55] already did it." He said, "Not our door,
[46:57] but the door. The only door."
[47:01] Don't think that you believe this
[47:02] message that you're going to make it to
[47:04] heaven. Hell will be full of preachers.
[47:08] There'll be more preachers in hell than
[47:09] there will be anybody else
[47:12] because sometimes preachers don't tell
[47:14] the truth.
[47:17] And then there'll be the make believers
[47:19] that are pretending they got something
[47:21] they don't got.
[47:23] And there'll be the ones that condemn.
[47:27] Who is he that condemns?
[47:31] Who died for them? You're condemning the
[47:34] person I died for.
[47:36] Woo! Help me, Jesus. He is the door to
[47:40] salvation. And there is no other name
[47:43] given under heaven whereby you must be
[47:45] saved. Only through the name of Jesus
[47:47] Christ, no church, no denomination, no
[47:51] creed, no doctrines of anything through
[47:55] Jesus name only.
[47:59] That's right. Amen.
[48:03] That is the key. No wonder Peter said,
[48:06] "Use one of them on the day of
[48:08] Pentecost." And they wanted to know how
[48:10] to get in to that door. And he used the
[48:14] key. He said, "There's only one key
[48:16] because there's only one door.
[48:21] Repent every one of you and be baptized
[48:24] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[48:27] remission of your sins and ye shall
[48:30] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[48:35] And this treasure is for you
[48:40] and is all that the Lord thy God shall
[48:44] call.
[48:46] You know God put us on earth to find
[48:49] sinners. Do you know at one place
[48:51] brother Bram said that we would actually
[48:53] be judged for not sharing the truth
[48:56] salvation.
[49:01] Amen.
[49:05] Hallelujah.
[49:07] Acts 237 to 40.
[49:11] And now they that heard this.
[49:18] And they that heard this were pricricked
[49:19] in their heart. And they said unto Peter
[49:21] and the rest of the apostles, men and
[49:23] brethren, what shall we do? And Peter
[49:25] said unto them,"Repent and be baptized,
[49:28] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[49:30] Christ, for the remission of sins, and
[49:32] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[49:34] Ghost, and for the promises to you and
[49:38] to your children,
[49:41] and to all that are far off,
[49:44] even as many as the Lord thy God shall
[49:46] call, and as many," in other words, did
[49:48] he testify and exhort, saying, "Save
[49:51] thyself from to this on towards
[49:55] generations
[49:58] praising God and having favor with all
[50:00] people.
[50:02] And the Lord added to the church daily
[50:05] statues would be saved.
[50:08] Hallelujah. Praise God that you know we
[50:12] don't we want to make sure we're in the
[50:15] plan. God has given different ones
[50:18] different amounts of revelation
[50:21] and you have an huge amount of
[50:23] revelation and you should lose your mind
[50:26] in humility and praise and adoration
[50:32] that God loved you so much. But because
[50:35] we're in a human body, we think somehow
[50:38] we you look at why God never healed
[50:40] Paul.
[50:42] Because Paul had was given such enormous
[50:44] revelations.
[50:46] He said, "I left you that." He said, "My
[50:48] grace is sufficient for you." Because
[50:51] Paul would have got lifted up in
[50:52] himself.
[50:56] He would have got lifted up in himself.
[50:58] So God left Paul with his infirmity and
[51:01] said, "My grace is sufficient for you
[51:04] because you've received so much."
[51:07] Amen.
[51:11] Hallelujah.
[51:13] We've received so much.
[51:16] Don't take it away from the ones that
[51:19] are desiring it. Don't take it away from
[51:22] the ones that got
[51:26] less revelation than you have.
[51:30] If they're not as far down the road as
[51:32] you,
[51:34] praise God for where they're at. Amen.
[51:37] Amen.
[51:40] You know, in the chosen place of
[51:41] worship, I'm not going to read this. He
[51:43] said, "Whosoever shall call on the name
[51:45] of the Lord shall be saved." Peter said,
[51:48] "Repent and be baptized for the
[51:50] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[51:52] the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the
[51:54] promises unto you
[51:56] and to all the future generations."
[52:02] Hallelujah.
[52:06] So many quotes here. I'm I'm just,
[52:11] you know, we we so many times as
[52:14] Christians, we and we all do. We all
[52:18] have our own convictions and they're
[52:20] okay. They're what God give you.
[52:23] They're how your parents raised you. And
[52:26] and and you know, we were all raised by
[52:28] different parents for the most part. So
[52:31] that right off the get-go, you have
[52:33] different convictions.
[52:35] And we're all in God deals with the
[52:37] Gentiles individual.
[52:39] So he gives you individual convictions.
[52:43] I can't do some things maybe you can do.
[52:48] But don't judge the other person.
[52:52] Leave it alone.
[53:05] Watch what the pro I'm just reading part
[53:07] of this quote.
[53:09] And God provided way. He said, "And
[53:11] that's the way it continues on." He's
[53:13] talking about repent and be baptized and
[53:15] you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[53:17] He said that's the way it continues on.
[53:18] As long as the Lord is calling,
[53:21] God still promised the Holy Ghost.
[53:25] As long as people are desiring to be
[53:27] saved,
[53:30] this person ain't going to be the one to
[53:32] tell them there ain't none left. That's
[53:34] right.
[53:36] That's That's
[53:42] First John
[53:46] 1 John 3 19 to 21.
[53:50] And hereby we know that we are of the
[53:52] truth
[53:54] and shall and assure assure our hearts
[53:58] before him.
[54:00] Verse 20. And if our heart condemnth
[54:02] not,
[54:04] God is greater than our heart
[54:08] and knoweth all things.
[54:11] Beloved, if our heart condemnth not,
[54:14] then we have confidence towards God. Now
[54:17] I want to show you what that scripture
[54:19] means.
[54:20] Your heart could condemn you about
[54:24] something serving God, but it won't
[54:26] condemn your brother or sister.
[54:31] That's God's variety.
[54:34] That's not a salvation issue.
[54:41] Amen. Amen. How how can you go to some
[54:44] person and say you're living in sin when
[54:47] they got peace in their heart?
[54:51] God's only You say, "Well, maybe it's
[54:53] off the word." Well, God hasn't revealed
[54:55] it to them yet. They can't learn the
[54:58] word by knowledge.
[55:00] If by if men can give it to them, then
[55:02] man can take it out.
[55:08] I want to look at this and I mentioned
[55:10] this already.
[55:12] But I want to just touch this
[55:16] and show you what the prophet said
[55:19] just because I think some of you choked.
[55:21] Exodus 32:7-14.
[55:25] And I'm just going to stop when I'm
[55:27] supposed to cuz I'm not even going to
[55:29] pretend to finish. And the Lord said
[55:32] unto Moses, "Get thee down, for thy
[55:34] people, which thou broughtest out of E,
[55:37] the land of Egypt, have corrupted
[55:39] themselves,
[55:41] and they have turned aside quickly out
[55:42] of the way, of which I commanded them,
[55:45] and they have made themselves a molted
[55:47] calf, and have worshiped it, and
[55:49] sacrificed it onto. And I said, "These
[55:52] be thy gods, oh Israel, which have I
[55:55] brought thee up out of the land of
[55:57] Egypt."
[56:00] And verse 9, and the Lord said unto
[56:02] Moses, I have seen this people, and
[56:05] behold, they are stiff necked people.
[56:10] And I know therefore, let me alone, that
[56:13] my wrath may vex hot against them, and
[56:18] that I may consume them,
[56:21] and I will make thee a new great nation.
[56:26] I want to just show you something here.
[56:28] These people were the chosen nation that
[56:32] God chose.
[56:46] And you'll understand better when I read
[56:47] the end of the scripture.
[56:51] And forgive me, God, but I'm trying to
[56:54] help you understand.
[56:56] God had had it.
[56:59] God was having a bad day.
[57:03] And he said, "That's it.
[57:06] That's it. It's over."
[57:09] And Moses besought the Lord his God and
[57:13] said, "Lord, why do thy wrath wax hard
[57:15] against the people which thou has
[57:17] brought out of the land of Egypt with
[57:19] great power in thy mighty hands? Where
[57:22] shall thou be? the Egyptians shall speak
[57:24] and say, "For the mischief."
[57:28] This this scripture right here fits
[57:30] into, you know, I know that they're my
[57:32] disciples by how they love one another.
[57:36] I don't care if you don't have the same
[57:38] revelation as me. I don't even care if
[57:40] you have the same convictions as me. I
[57:42] don't believe it. Very few people will.
[57:47] But we can still have love. Amen.
[57:52] Wherefore
[57:55] should the Egyptians speak and say, for
[57:57] the mischief did he bring them out, and
[58:01] slay them in the mountain, and consume
[58:04] them from the face of the earth, and
[58:06] turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent
[58:09] of this evil
[58:13] against thy people. I want to just show
[58:16] you something. Moses,
[58:21] this is going to be hard to believe.
[58:23] Moses was preaching to God.
[58:29] Do you know you can do that? You can
[58:32] say, "God, you give me some children."
[58:35] And they went wayward and they're my
[58:37] heritage and I put their token over them
[58:41] and don't you dare take them out.
[58:46] That's putting yourself in the hands of
[58:48] God
[58:52] and saying, "God, they're coming with
[58:54] me." You understand?
[59:00] I know you're shocked, but watch what
[59:01] the prophet says.
[59:06] Moses is telling God that he had an evil
[59:08] thought.
[59:11] Wow.
[59:14] Remember
[59:16] Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants,
[59:19] whom thou swear by them thyself, and
[59:22] saidest, that I will multiply thy seed
[59:25] as the stars of heaven, and I shall give
[59:27] this land that I've spoken, and I will
[59:30] give it to thy seed, and thou shalt
[59:33] inherit it." Now, here's Moses telling
[59:36] God what he had promised. Yeah,
[59:40] that'd be just like you parents going to
[59:43] God tonight and saying, "God, you give
[59:46] me my heritage and you promise them to
[59:50] me for a blessing
[59:52] to carry on to your kingdom."
[59:56] Do you remember your promise, God?
[1:00:04] And verse 14, we got to have that one.
[1:00:08] Uhoh.
[1:00:14] Really?
[1:00:17] Is that possible?
[1:00:22] No. No. No. That's not possible. The
[1:00:24] Bible says it is. Yeah. And the Lord
[1:00:27] repented of the evil which he had
[1:00:30] thought unto his people. I'm going to
[1:00:34] give you a big shock.
[1:00:36] If God could think evil of the people he
[1:00:39] called, it ain't hard to believe that
[1:00:42] some of you can think evil of each
[1:00:43] other.
[1:00:47] Hello. I don't think there's anybody
[1:00:49] home. Amen. Yeah. If God
[1:00:53] could think evil of the message church,
[1:00:57] it ain't hard to believe that there's
[1:00:59] some people sitting in the message
[1:01:00] church.
[1:01:02] Yeah.
[1:01:04] That good thing evil of each other.
[1:01:09] Help us.
[1:01:11] I almost need the bill on that one.
[1:01:19] But God
[1:01:21] repented.
[1:01:28] This is Israel in the church. This is a
[1:01:30] quote. Brother Brandham said, you know,
[1:01:31] Paul told Moses after all that time, I
[1:01:33] want to show you that the man before
[1:01:35] God, when God told Moses, step out of
[1:01:38] the way, Moses, and I'm going to destroy
[1:01:40] this whole bunch of them, and I'll make
[1:01:42] you a mighty nation, Moses threw himself
[1:01:44] in front of God. and bridged his way and
[1:01:47] said, "God, take me to
[1:01:55] statue of a perfect man." 62.
[1:01:59] He said, "Even one time the rebellious
[1:02:01] bunch of people had such impatience and
[1:02:04] they caused Moses to do such a thing
[1:02:06] wrong. And yet the showdown, God got
[1:02:09] sick of their actions and he said,
[1:02:12] "Separate yourself, Moses, and I'll kill
[1:02:15] those message believers."
[1:02:18] That's what they were in their day.
[1:02:22] There was no Gentiles saved. Then
[1:02:25] we were pagan,
[1:02:27] heathens.
[1:02:31] I'll kill those message people.
[1:02:36] and he threw himself in the breach and
[1:02:38] said, "God, don't do it." And it, let's
[1:02:41] just go to the next paragraph. And he
[1:02:42] said, "I wonder if we could do that."
[1:02:46] Oh.
[1:02:49] Oh, wow.
[1:02:51] I wonder if you could defend somebody
[1:02:53] that people are condemning.
[1:02:57] I wonder if we could do that. If you
[1:02:59] can't, don't try to build on this
[1:03:02] because it don't change. That's the way
[1:03:05] the first one is vulcanized onto this.
[1:03:10] That's the way every one of them has to
[1:03:12] be vulcanized. And if you don't, you
[1:03:15] don't come to that stature of the
[1:03:17] dwelling place of the living God. You
[1:03:20] haven't got patience. Patience for one
[1:03:22] another.
[1:03:26] I'm still looking for the one. Oh, there
[1:03:28] it is.
[1:03:33] Let's go to the next one. Away with
[1:03:34] Jesus. He said, "The people saith, your
[1:03:37] God is able to bring you out, but not
[1:03:40] able to keep you." We know that ain't
[1:03:42] true. God never saved anybody to lose
[1:03:45] them. And Moses threw himself in the
[1:03:48] breach. Then later found out Moses that
[1:03:52] that was Christ in Moses standing for
[1:03:56] the people.
[1:03:58] Now I think I think this is the one I
[1:04:00] mentioned to you before.
[1:04:02] Remember at the ending of the Gentile
[1:04:05] dispensation,
[1:04:06] remember thus sayaeth the Lord, it's
[1:04:09] time for the Gentile age to cease and
[1:04:12] the Gentile age ceases and the gospel
[1:04:15] goes to the Jews and it's over then. Get
[1:04:19] into the kingdom right quick now. Now
[1:04:22] here's the prophet saying there's still
[1:04:24] grace for the world.
[1:04:28] Get in right quick now. Come. Come you
[1:04:31] Methodist. Come on you Baptist. Come on
[1:04:33] you Presbyterian. One thing we're asking
[1:04:36] you to do is come to Jesus.
[1:04:44] The Pentecost is not a denomination.
[1:04:47] It's an experience.
[1:04:49] Pentecost belongs to everyone. It's an
[1:04:52] experience you have and you can't
[1:04:55] recognize, you can't organize Pentecost.
[1:04:58] Pentecostal is an experience that God
[1:05:01] gives to believers. It's for you.
[1:05:05] Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist,
[1:05:07] Luther, and whatever more.
[1:05:10] And then your prophet says this.
[1:05:13] He says, "I'm a Baptist, but I got the
[1:05:16] Holy Ghost.
[1:05:24] That's right.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:30] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:33] Be not afraid. And when the Jews receive
[1:05:36] Christ as their Messiah, the Gentile age
[1:05:39] is finished. And it's your hour now.
[1:05:43] You'd better come in.
[1:05:46] Amen. We still have abundant grace. But
[1:05:49] what I what I what I'm trying what God's
[1:05:51] trying to show you is what kind of a
[1:05:53] person would want somebody to miss grace
[1:05:57] and go to hell.
[1:06:00] What kind of a character would that be?
[1:06:03] What kind of a motive and objective
[1:06:04] would that be? I don't want to be around
[1:06:07] people like that.
[1:06:15] I want to show you how that spirits
[1:06:17] don't die.
[1:06:20] And this is right in John. And they used
[1:06:23] it on Jesus Christ and it's still very
[1:06:26] much alive today. It'll shock you. John
[1:06:30] 8:31.
[1:06:35] And then Jesus said to these Jews, now
[1:06:38] just to lay a foundation now, the Jews
[1:06:40] were God's people.
[1:06:43] Jesus said to these Jews which believed
[1:06:45] on him, "If thou continue in my word,
[1:06:49] you would be my disciples indeed."
[1:06:52] Now, I read that because I got to show
[1:06:54] you who Jesus is talking about.
[1:06:58] And they answered him, this is the Jews.
[1:07:02] The Jews answered him, and they said,
[1:07:05] "We be of Abraham's seed, and were never
[1:07:09] in bondage to any man. How sayest thou,
[1:07:14] ye shall be made free?" These Jews were
[1:07:18] refusing grace.
[1:07:22] But watch, I I got something God wants
[1:07:25] to show you here. Verse 39. And Jesus
[1:07:27] answered them and said unto him,"Abraham
[1:07:31] is our father." Jesus said unto them,
[1:07:34] "If ye are Abraham's children, then ye
[1:07:37] would do the works of Abraham.
[1:07:40] But now ye seek to kill me,
[1:07:43] a man that hath told you the truth which
[1:07:47] I have heard of God." This did not
[1:07:50] Abraham. He's God's Jesus is showing the
[1:07:54] Jews that Abraham didn't try to kill
[1:07:57] God's people.
[1:08:01] And this is the one that's going to make
[1:08:03] you fall down.
[1:08:05] This is the Christian message believer
[1:08:08] of the day.
[1:08:10] Verse 41.
[1:08:18] You do the deeds of your father.
[1:08:21] That was Jesus talking.
[1:08:24] And then the Jews answered him and said,
[1:08:29] "Well, we at least weren't born in
[1:08:31] fornication."
[1:08:34] That that is the same as saying,
[1:08:39] "We at least weren't born in
[1:08:40] fornication. We have one father and that
[1:08:44] father's God." And here they were
[1:08:46] standing right in front of God. Yeah.
[1:08:49] and they were judging him. That spirit's
[1:08:52] still alive. That that would be the
[1:08:54] same.
[1:08:56] And and even if let's go down to 48. And
[1:08:59] the Jews answered Jesus said unto him,
[1:09:02] "Say not well that thou art a Samaritan.
[1:09:07] Thou hast a devil."
[1:09:09] So now they're calling the son of God,
[1:09:11] the devil.
[1:09:14] I want to show you that that's the same
[1:09:16] spirit
[1:09:18] that would have another message believer
[1:09:20] condemn another person person.
[1:09:25] Notice I never said message believer
[1:09:28] any denomination
[1:09:30] any person
[1:09:32] even in the world.
[1:09:36] Watch with this. When those Jews said to
[1:09:39] the son of God, "Well, at least I wasn't
[1:09:42] born in fornication," they were
[1:09:45] insinuating that Jesus was conceived
[1:09:48] before marriage and it wasn't an
[1:09:50] immaculate
[1:09:51] plan of God. That would be the same
[1:09:54] spirit to say, "Well, at least I was
[1:09:57] born in a message church.
[1:10:00] Bless God.
[1:10:04] Well, at least my daddy's a deacon or a
[1:10:06] pastor
[1:10:08] in a message church is if that would
[1:10:10] mean one thing
[1:10:15] or here's another one that's the same
[1:10:17] spirit. Why I go to so and so, pastor so
[1:10:21] and so's church.
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:28] So,
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:32] or here's another one. The same spirit.
[1:10:34] Well, my family would never do that.
[1:10:38] Well, praise God they wouldn't.
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:44] Or this is the best one yet.
[1:10:49] This is the same spirit where the Jews
[1:10:51] said unto Jesus, "Well, at least I
[1:10:53] wasn't born in fornication."
[1:10:55] Watch this. The very best one
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:01] says, "Well,
[1:11:03] we never let our kids do that."
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:09] As if my kids were better than your
[1:11:12] kids.
[1:11:14] That's what the Jews were insinuating to
[1:11:17] Jesus. They were insinuating to Jesus
[1:11:19] that they were more godly than the son
[1:11:22] of God because they thought he was born
[1:11:25] in fornication.
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:29] Unbelievable.
[1:11:32] See that religious spirit? That's
[1:11:35] disgusting.
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:42] That's disgusting.
[1:11:44] I'm going to close here just a a second.
[1:11:47] Just a a couple few scripture. I want to
[1:11:49] get to one quote. Ephesians 2:8 and9.
[1:11:53] For by grace are you saved through faith
[1:11:56] and not not of yourself. It is a gift of
[1:11:59] God,
[1:12:00] not of works, lest any man
[1:12:04] should boast.
[1:12:06] Why? My family was better than yours.
[1:12:09] Remember the wedding garments.
[1:12:12] That's right. All the poor and rich,
[1:12:15] slave and bought and free, all look the
[1:12:18] same.
[1:12:23] Philippians 2:12. Wherefore, my beloved,
[1:12:27] as you have also obeyed, not as in my
[1:12:31] presence only,
[1:12:33] but now much more in my absence, work
[1:12:36] out your own salvation
[1:12:39] with fear and trembling.
[1:12:43] That's right.
[1:12:49] You can't save nobody.
[1:12:52] It's God that draws somebody and it's
[1:12:55] God that gives the revelation of the
[1:12:58] height that they're at. Leave it alone.
[1:13:05] Amen.
[1:13:10] Matthew 7. I want to get to a quote on
[1:13:12] Mike's scripts.
[1:13:14] I see it here. I'll read this Matthew
[1:13:17] and it's also in Luke. So God really
[1:13:19] wanted us know. Judge not
[1:13:23] that you be not judged.
[1:13:26] Now I don't want anybody put your hands
[1:13:27] up,
[1:13:31] but I'll bet you every person here
[1:13:34] has said something about somebody else.
[1:13:36] something that you didn't think was
[1:13:37] perfect.
[1:13:40] And if you say you never said it in your
[1:13:41] life, you're going to repent for lying.
[1:13:45] I know that. Guaranteed.
[1:13:53] Now, God put this twice in the Gospels.
[1:13:56] It's also in Luke 6. Judge not that you
[1:13:58] be not judged. For with what judgment
[1:14:00] you judge, you shall also be judged. And
[1:14:03] which measure you merit, you shall also
[1:14:07] be measured again. And why, behold, is
[1:14:10] the mold that's in thy brother's eye,
[1:14:12] but considerest not the beam that's in
[1:14:14] thine own eye.
[1:14:18] Or how wil thou say to thy brother, let
[1:14:21] me pull out the molt in thy eye, and
[1:14:23] behold the beam in thine own eye. Watch
[1:14:25] what God calls you.
[1:14:30] I wish I could have highlighted that. I
[1:14:33] put that in capital letters because you
[1:14:34] were gonna take it off my iPad. Vicki,
[1:14:37] you're a hypocrite.
[1:14:47] I've went to thousands of dinners and
[1:14:49] fellowship.
[1:14:54] Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.
[1:14:58] If somebody walked in this church that
[1:15:00] don't come here regular, we would all
[1:15:01] have, well, they they're not a believer.
[1:15:04] How do you know?
[1:15:07] Well, they look different for me. So,
[1:15:10] who drawed them to this church? Yeah,
[1:15:14] that's right. Yes, sir. The Bible says,
[1:15:18] "No one draws somebody to God except
[1:15:20] God."
[1:15:21] So, if God was drawing them, he could
[1:15:24] have already saved them.
[1:15:26] He maybe just didn't get them cleaned up
[1:15:29] and sanctified yet.
[1:15:32] And you're a hypocrite
[1:15:35] speaking against God's movement.
[1:15:38] Leave it alone.
[1:15:43] I'm going to close on this this quote.
[1:15:51] Please put this up, Vicki.
[1:15:54] All these believers
[1:15:57] were like a bunch of change
[1:16:00] in your pocket.
[1:16:06] Now, I want to just tell you something.
[1:16:07] I want to just stop here for a minute.
[1:16:09] This is a 64 quote. If you don't like
[1:16:12] this one, just forget everything else
[1:16:14] you believe. Yeah, that's right. Don't
[1:16:17] pick and choose. Yeah. All of God's word
[1:16:20] is good for reproof and correction and
[1:16:24] doctrine.
[1:16:30] There's like a bunch of change in your
[1:16:31] pocket and you pull out the chains and
[1:16:33] there's pennies. I wish I should have
[1:16:36] highlighted this, but the second line,
[1:16:38] third line there, there's pennies,
[1:16:40] there's nickels, dimes, and quarters.
[1:16:43] There's a half dollar and there ain't
[1:16:46] very many dollars in my pockets
[1:16:47] nowadays, but there's maybe $1
[1:16:54] are all coins.
[1:16:57] And now that's the world is in God's
[1:17:00] hands.
[1:17:02] I'm going to tell you right now, there's
[1:17:04] people sitting right in this building
[1:17:05] that don't like this quote. I can feel
[1:17:08] it.
[1:17:10] I can feel it.
[1:17:12] You think you're a silver dollar and
[1:17:14] everybody else is worthless.
[1:17:16] Oh, wow.
[1:17:18] Watch what your prophet says about that.
[1:17:22] He says they're all in God's hands. And
[1:17:25] there is some people that are just can
[1:17:28] just come to have a pennies worth.
[1:17:32] God can only use them for one penny.
[1:17:37] Yeah,
[1:17:39] that'd be like a poor quality preacher
[1:17:41] like me. I'm just a spare tire. But
[1:17:45] there's some people can really let it
[1:17:46] fly.
[1:17:51] That's all they can buy is one penny.
[1:17:56] Oh, I I got some down here. Now we're on
[1:17:58] the bottom three lines. What's your
[1:18:01] prophet say about that?
[1:18:04] Maybe we should say it together.
[1:18:06] Don't reject them.
[1:18:10] A penny.
[1:18:13] That's somebody that's not living right,
[1:18:15] ain't dressed right, a penny.
[1:18:21] He said, "Now, this says 64.
[1:18:25] This is after the seals.
[1:18:27] This is when the full revelation of God
[1:18:29] is given to them.
[1:18:32] Don't reject them." Well, bless God.
[1:18:34] They didn't look right when they came to
[1:18:36] church.
[1:18:38] They weren't like holiness or I seen
[1:18:40] they trimmed their or or the or or or
[1:18:44] or or
[1:18:47] that's disgusting.
[1:18:49] We need to kill this devil really good.
[1:18:52] We need to line them up and kill him.
[1:18:55] And you know, the next time you're with
[1:18:56] Brother Dale and I start speaking about
[1:18:59] anybody and I write them as a penny, you
[1:19:02] kick me right in the knee.
[1:19:04] You are that right.
[1:19:07] I'm dead serious. It's a spirit of the
[1:19:10] devil.
[1:19:12] That's right.
[1:19:17] He said, "Don't reject them." Now, now
[1:19:20] this is this one might even hurt you a
[1:19:22] little bit. If they can't believe the
[1:19:25] real truth, the real truth. Like that's
[1:19:28] what you're thinking. Like the message
[1:19:30] truth.
[1:19:32] If they can't believe the real truth,
[1:19:34] don't turn them down. Oh, we already
[1:19:38] did. We already did. They're not part of
[1:19:40] us because we already did. Every one of
[1:19:44] us already did. They're not They don't
[1:19:45] have what we got. So, they're foolish
[1:19:48] virgins. Yeah. Why do we do that?
[1:19:53] Our prophet never he's telling us not to
[1:19:55] do that.
[1:19:57] He said don't turn them down and and
[1:20:00] worse yet. Worse yet worse yet. Let me
[1:20:03] see this here. And and don't kick them
[1:20:07] out.
[1:20:09] Well, they're not saved because because
[1:20:11] because because they weren't born in a
[1:20:14] message church. They're not saved be
[1:20:16] because they don't go to a message
[1:20:17] church. They're not saved because
[1:20:19] because what's the next word I can think
[1:20:21] of? Because they don't live up to the
[1:20:24] revelation that I got. Oh, you're you're
[1:20:27] you're giving God vomit.
[1:20:31] Don't kick them out and say that they're
[1:20:34] not in it.
[1:20:36] Yeah.
[1:20:39] Now, next Sunday, I'm going to show you
[1:20:41] a dozen quotes where God said where
[1:20:44] brother says that the ones that went
[1:20:46] through the tribulation are the ones
[1:20:48] with the white robe judgments in
[1:20:50] Revelation 7
[1:20:52] 13 or whatever verse I said. And he
[1:20:55] called them the blind.
[1:20:58] Yeah.
[1:21:00] Yeah,
[1:21:05] I know what you're thinking. There was
[1:21:06] the five wise and five foolish.
[1:21:09] But what are we going to do with these
[1:21:10] other things?
[1:21:13] He said, "Don't kick them out and don't
[1:21:15] say that they're not in
[1:21:17] because there'll be pennies." Yeah,
[1:21:20] that's right. In heaven.
[1:21:23] There'll be loads of pennies in heaven.
[1:21:26] That's right. But don't come around any
[1:21:29] message believers because we'll sure
[1:21:30] condemn you. Bless God. You don't see it
[1:21:33] like I see it.
[1:21:38] That's of the devil.
[1:21:40] That's of the devil. That is just flat
[1:21:43] of the devil.
[1:21:45] And I'll tell you what, it's disgusting.
[1:21:51] Yeah. God, don't there will not be one
[1:21:54] legalistic
[1:21:55] person in heaven.
[1:21:58] There will not be one legal. This is how
[1:21:59] your prophet said. You think you're some
[1:22:01] big hot shot. You were born holy and
[1:22:04] immaculate conceived. He said, "Just
[1:22:06] stick your finger in a pale of water and
[1:22:09] pull it out
[1:22:11] and show me where your finger was."
[1:22:14] That's That's how big of a big shot you
[1:22:16] are.
[1:22:18] That's how big of a big shot you are.
[1:22:20] And you're And who is he
[1:22:23] that condemnth?
[1:22:27] Who? Who paid the price? Who p Who paid
[1:22:29] the price? You did. Oh, yeah. Did you
[1:22:31] Did your pastor did? Oh, no. No. The
[1:22:33] evangelist said, "Oh, yeah. Who paid the
[1:22:35] price?" Christ. Was it Christ that died?
[1:22:43] Help me, Jesus. Forgive me for all my
[1:22:46] past.
[1:22:48] Oh, man.
[1:22:51] God uses pennies. If you read on in that
[1:22:54] quote, he said, "Lot was a penny and
[1:22:57] Abraham was a silver dollar." Well, I
[1:23:00] want to tell you something. God saved
[1:23:01] Lot.
[1:23:05] Look at what Abraham did to go save him.
[1:23:07] He risked his own neck
[1:23:12] to save him.
[1:23:14] You know, we would, you know, we we need
[1:23:16] to come to We want to come to a statue
[1:23:19] of a perfect man. I'm closing. I I It's
[1:23:21] hard to, but I'm closing. You don't get
[1:23:23] higher up the ladder by pushing other
[1:23:25] people down.
[1:23:27] Just leave them alone.
[1:23:30] Who cares? When you go to the grocery
[1:23:31] store, buy the groceries for the guy
[1:23:33] behind you. Buy the guy for the one in
[1:23:35] front of you. When you go to the ice
[1:23:37] cream shop, buy all the next five in the
[1:23:39] row. Who cares? Can't take it with you.
[1:23:43] Do
[1:23:46] you see?
[1:23:48] Christianity and for sure us believers,
[1:23:52] we got to get out of the the the spirit
[1:23:55] of saying, "I'm the only one. We're it.
[1:23:59] We got it. I received the message." Oh,
[1:24:02] praise God. You did. There'll be
[1:24:04] thousands of people in hell that
[1:24:06] received it. The devil received it, too,
[1:24:09] and trembled.
[1:24:13] Amen.
[1:24:16] The devil knew that Jesus was the
[1:24:17] Christ,
[1:24:19] but he couldn't worship him.
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:26] Same spirit. I I'm telling you, church,
[1:24:28] it's the exact same spirit. When the
[1:24:31] Jews came to Jesus and said, "Well, at
[1:24:33] least I wasn't born in fornication.
[1:24:37] Bless God.
[1:24:39] As if I'm some kind of a holy
[1:24:46] and they were mocking. Yeah. Wow. The
[1:24:50] son of God.
[1:24:54] That That's just unbelievable.
[1:25:03] I might take that quote, that last
[1:25:04] quote. I might frame it in about a
[1:25:06] six-foot picture and hang it in the
[1:25:08] fellowship hall.
[1:25:12] Everybody's welcome in this church.
[1:25:15] Everybody.
[1:25:18] That feels the pull of God in their
[1:25:19] life. And even the ones that don't feel
[1:25:21] the pull of God in their life, if they
[1:25:23] come because I invite them, that's
[1:25:24] they're still welcome. I don't care if
[1:25:27] they just come for the hamburgers. That
[1:25:28] don't bother me at all. I got lots of
[1:25:30] hamburgers.
[1:25:33] Our
[1:25:36] job is in rather kick people out of
[1:25:38] God's kingdom is to kick them in God's
[1:25:41] kingdom.
[1:25:43] You should be like Moses trying to save
[1:25:46] people that God's saying, "Wait a
[1:25:48] minute. They haven't repented yet.
[1:25:52] You're supposed to be the ambassador for
[1:25:54] God, saying they're all ours, God. We're
[1:25:56] all coming in. Look at Rahab in the
[1:25:58] wall. All of our family. Just bring them
[1:26:02] in. Paul in. I'll bet you she got her
[1:26:04] nieces, nephews, aunts, grandmas to the
[1:26:07] fourth generation. They were still
[1:26:09] alive.
[1:26:11] I would have went dig up their bones and
[1:26:13] put them in the house. Yeah,
[1:26:17] because all that were in that tabernacle
[1:26:20] were saved.
[1:26:24] That's right. We need to be prostitutes
[1:26:28] for the gospel
[1:26:31] and get a lot more people in our house.
[1:26:34] You want me to tell you what? I'm I'm
[1:26:37] going to shut up. I wonder if I've saved
[1:26:39] as many people as Rahab has.
[1:26:47] Bible don't say how many was in her
[1:26:48] house.
[1:26:50] Have you saved 30 or 40?
[1:26:54] Yeah,
[1:26:56] but I'll bet you you've condemned 30 or
[1:26:57] 40.
[1:26:59] But Scott, I wouldn't do that.
[1:27:04] God died for those people. He died for
[1:27:07] the ones that you want to do that. He
[1:27:09] died for the woman at the well. Amen. He
[1:27:12] died for those people. And when he was
[1:27:15] on earth, those are the people he spent
[1:27:17] his time with.
[1:27:20] Yep.
[1:27:21] All the lame and halt and God help us.
[1:27:25] Let's stand. I have never stopped
[1:27:27] preaching. I could preach forever.
[1:27:30] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:40] Amen.
[1:27:41] God help us. Who is he
[1:27:46] that condemnth?
[1:27:50] Jesus is asking that question.
[1:27:53] I don't ever want to hear brother Dale's
[1:27:55] name on that sentence.
[1:27:57] No,
[1:27:59] I'd rather be guilty of trying to get
[1:28:01] people there that weren't qualified
[1:28:03] than take people away that were.
[1:28:07] It shows the spirit of the anointing on
[1:28:09] you.
[1:28:11] It's a spirit of Satan to kill, destroy,
[1:28:14] deceive, and he's a vampire. eat his
[1:28:18] own. I don't have nothing to do with any
[1:28:21] kind of the Christian family.
[1:28:24] The Christian family is all love,
[1:28:28] mercy, grace. Oh, there's a word that's
[1:28:31] really hard to say. Long long
[1:28:33] longsuffering.
[1:28:37] Longsuffering
[1:28:42] and patient. Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
[1:28:46] Wow.
[1:28:48] have thy own way.
[1:28:53] Help me Jesus.
[1:28:55] I thank you.
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:14] I am the way.
[1:29:21] Holy
[1:29:23] Hey,
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:34] why are you
[1:29:51] Lord,
[1:29:53] have thy way
[1:30:00] search
[1:30:01] and
[1:30:10] Jesus.
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] Oh my Oh Jesus
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:26] in the praise
[1:30:32] of the I
[1:30:39] have my
[1:30:43] Lord,
[1:30:52] how
[1:30:56] Jesus
[1:31:00] Oh,
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:17] trust me.
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:30] Now I
[1:31:36] have my
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:49] master.
[1:31:52] Thank you Jesus.
[1:31:56] with my spirit
[1:32:02] till
[1:32:08] Christ.
[1:32:20] Thank you Jesus.
[1:32:25] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word
[1:32:27] this morning.
[1:32:29] Lord, I bring you a holy Jesus
[1:32:33] to not be fighting what you're doing.
[1:32:35] Jesus,
[1:32:36] not be judging what you're doing,
[1:32:40] and not be taking something away that
[1:32:42] you've already given.
[1:32:44] Jesus,
[1:32:46] be with the ones, Lord, that haven't got
[1:32:50] saved yet.
[1:32:52] Lord, I pray that you'll woo them onto
[1:32:54] yourself like nobody can.
[1:32:59] And Lord, help me to be bright and
[1:33:01] salty.
[1:33:04] That they could see Christ
[1:33:07] like that last verse said, like they
[1:33:09] could see the spirit
[1:33:12] of Christ.
[1:33:15] that he would that all would be saved
[1:33:19] and come to repentance.
[1:33:24] Hallelujah.
[1:33:26] And he in no wise
[1:33:30] would cast out
[1:33:34] because Lord Jesus, you were the one
[1:33:37] that paid the price. You and you alone
[1:33:43] paid the price.
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:47] for everyone
[1:33:50] that'll come to you. Blessed be your
[1:33:53] name. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Bless your
[1:33:56] bride here. Bless our fellowship after,
[1:33:58] Lord Jesus. In your name we pray. Amen.
[1:34:02] God bless you.
[1:34:17] Thou art the
[1:34:23] I am the
[1:34:29] holy
