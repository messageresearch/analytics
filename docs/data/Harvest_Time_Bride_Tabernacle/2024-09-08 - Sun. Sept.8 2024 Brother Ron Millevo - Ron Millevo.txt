today is called uh God's five Dwelling Places so I believe God dwelt in the pillar of far God dwelt in his son Jesus amen God dwells in you right now so I believe uh we can find in the Bible five Dwelling Places of God Amen God condescending from Heaven to to this earth Amen to to put or to build a kingdom for himself in the Millennium wherein we will live and Reign forever with Christ with the rodom iron until the new Heaven and Earth back to Eternity so let's look at this uh events in in the Bible so we can see where we are right now where we came from and where we're going amen so let's all stand as we read some scriptures amen pertaining to this subject God's five Dwelling Places Amen in Hebrews chap 1: 1 and 2 we can read here God who at sunnd Dr times and in diverse manners spake in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets had in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed air of All Things by whom also he made the worlds in another scripture John 1:18 no man had seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him amen may the Lord add a blessing for the reading of his all pray and bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord you know we can do nothing without you everything that we have came from you Lord Our lives our families our jobs Lord our strength Lord God we owe everything to you father and we just thank you this morning for your kindness and mercy and love and protection Lord and provision for all our needs physically materially and spiritually Lord day by day Lord God we we we thank you Lord God for the word especially that has uh been uh shed abroad in our hearts Lord by the Holy Spirit Lord making us Lord children of God part of the Bride of Jesus in this last day thank you Lord for the message that you've sent to us in this last day sending the prophet of Malachi 4 the the angel the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 thank you Lord God for calling us and making us part of the elected seed of God lord for we know that the bride is one in a million and the truth is heed from the wise and The Prudent but revealed to babes such as we learn Lord thank you for writing our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and the prophet said you are obligated to look for us because it was you who wrote our names Lord we're saved not by works but by Grace Lord by election and thank you Lord so much for this uh Lord God privilege and honor to be part Lord God of your your kingdom Lord Jesus bless once again your people Lord answer every need father this morning may you heal the sick Lord and and strengthen the weak Lord give hope to the Hopeless and give us joy Lord the joy of our Salvation this morning as we listen to your word father Lord be glorified amongst us get glory for yourself we pray in Jesus name amen and amen amen God bless you you may be seated once again praise the Lord so I would like to start with uh you know God dwelling in heaven praise God I believe the Bible said in Isaiah 66 verse1 thus said the Lord the heaven is my Throne right and the Earth is my foot stol you see God is omnipresent he could be everywhere amen he could speak in heaven we could hear the words The Voice here on Earth he said where is the house that you build me so we believe that uh the building is not his house amen I believe we are the Temple of the holy spirit amen Jesus amen is the temple of God the image of the invisible God and that's why he's asking where is the place of my rest amen the place of his rest is among his people praise God in the heart of his people the prophet said that there's a a a small amen uh occupation space in your heart there there's no blood in it amen that is the occupation of the Soul amen and the soul is where the seed germ lays amen the seed The Incorruptible seed that come that came from God that's why the prophet said amen that your soul amen is a part of God displayed here in a body amen so now we can see here that uh God is a spirit amen and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth Amen in 1 Timothy 616 it says that God dwells in the light he has the only one who had immortality 1 Timothy 616 dwelling in the light amen we see the pillar of Fire coming Amen in our day through the messenger a light which no man can approach unto which no man had seen nor can can see to whom be honor and power Everlasting praise the Lord so we can see the same Pillar of Fire in the time of Moses the burning bush I believe amen it was God calling Moses Amen to deliver the people of Israel from perrows from from bondage amen it was the same Pillar of Fire that wrote the Ten Commandments on Mount Si right Amen brother Ram said and God can write he wrote The Ten Commandments with his own finger quoting it from events made clear by prophecy he wrote on the walls of Babylon remember the Old Testament alone 2,000 times the prophet said thus sayith the Lord God can can speak God can write hallelujah amen then later on we can find that this light praise God Amen went and uh and uh guided the people amen through a pillar fire as it's written in Exodus 13:21 it says and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud we've seen that cloud in 1963 right amen and to lead them by the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night so amen so God was with them God dwelt in that Pillar of Fire the logos amen and that that uh Pillar of Fire guided them amen God gave them Mana amen that they don't have to cook their food every day amen God gave them that rock of uh you know that rock that that Gast out with water that can feed two million people alongside with the animals in a day so imagine what kind of rock was that amen so praise the Lord so God Amen is able to provide all our need according to his riches in glory he will never forsake his children just like we sang a while ago amen David said I I was young and now I am old I've never seen amen the righteous forsaken nor his seed be begging bread amen praise the Lord now we can see that the second Tabernacle that God dwelt in was in the tent of Moses it was called the shikina glory amen he was the one that came down on the tent and he was in that Holy Place wherein the high priest would uh offer sacrifices every year amen and that tent was divided as you know into three amen segments the outer Court the the holy place which is the inner court and the holy of holies and we can find that in the alter Courtyard amen that is where they they they wash the sacrifice the high priest would come and burn it amen at the altar of burnt offerings and then come inside the holy Place wherein you find the the minora the seven Candlestick in there the altar of incense and the table of shbr but the innermost part wherein there's a veil in there amen is the she kind of glory amen the presence of God was there Hallelujah and you can find there amen the Ark of the Covenant inside the Ark of the Covenant was the pot of Mana amen the the the uh we can find there the the the taets of stone and you know the aon's rod blossom in the presence of the shik glory amen praise the Lord in the Mana never R Amen in that presence of God in there amen let's read some quotation said the high priest once a year went in one time a year with a blood before him see nothing but the blood for without the shedding of blood there no remission of sin but before it was animals amen goats and you know Rams and and uh bulls and it said he worshiped in the shik and Glory all anointed walking he had garments on that had a pomegranate and a bell and he had to walk with that in such a step that played holy holy holy unto the Lord and holy unto the Lord packing the blood before him as he went because we know that uh amen when Adam and Eve sinned amen it required a blood sacrifice and so the priest every year we go there let's continue with another quote he went there and offered the blood The Mercy Seat once a year yes and while he was in there he was privileged to see the shikina glory when the pillar of fire the umber light that come down that led the children out of Israel he even smoke up the temple so no one could see it the glory of the Lord fell till he was all smoked up and he came in himself went in behind the veil and settled down on The Mercy Seat in the holiest of holies amen Most Holy place called holy of holies so what happened in there as the prophet said amen praise God the contents of the Ark as we see there was the pot of mana and he said here amen the golden pot God told Moses and Aaron to make a great golden pot full of Mana Amen in the holiest of holy amen praise God and there it never failed it never got old it never lost its sweetness it was always good inside there amen when we know in the wilderness it only was good for one day it rotted and you have to get another amen Mana the secondary but here it remains sweet amen it said never got old it's always is fresh under the presence of the shik glory and if we can be under that shik glory be fresh we will be amen Born Again amen we will have joy am we will never feel you know uh worriness and things like that always fresh and anointed under that CH kind of glory amen and the aons rod brother randam said here in why people so toss about they took Aaron's rod and laid Aaron's rod in the presence of the Holy place and when they did in one night's time it bed Blossom and yielded almost in one night's time my praise the Lord think of it in the presence of God this old dead Rod laying there in the presence of God bed Blossom and yielded alons in one night I believe the same holy spirit amen if the Holy Spirit would come unto a Christian amen you bear the fruits of the Holy Spirit you will have love joy peace longsuffering amen gentleness weekness Faith amen those are the fruits of Jesus Christ amen in our lives amen so now King Solomon built a concrete Temple for it as we know David tried to build amen a temple but God Amen was not yet it was not yet the time that was there there was usza who was uh you know helping you know that Ark not to Tumble down but he he died because amen he was not a levite Amen to hold those uh that Holy thing amen so we can see here in First Kings 9 1-3 it says Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord and the King's house and the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time and the Lord said I have hallowed this house which thou Hast built to put my name there forever and mine eyes and Mine Heart shall be there perpetually that's why Israel is trying to build the Third Temple now it was destroyed I believe in the time of General Titus amen 870 when all the Jews amen were persecuted and they were scattered in different uh countries in America and now they're coming back to meet their Messiah the 44,000 I believe amen we'll be soon in there we can see our time pie is Israel and we can see the war in Gaza you know Hamas heah amen Iran is trying to gang up now on Israel amen it will be time for us to go home in very soon because God cannot deal with the Jew and the Gentile at the same time amen the last predestinated seed from amongst the Gentile has to be found and then we will go home in a Rapture do you believe that sir glory to God hallelujah so but sin was never resolved by the offering of animal blood amen we can read it in Hebrews 104-113 this is now the the turning point for God because no man was able to obey the Ten Commandments to the fullest he gave them the Ten Commandments but David committed adultery Moses even killed an Egyptian and the Bible said thou must not kill thou should you know Thou shalt not commit adultery amen we know Samson fell for Delilah see amen Jacob in even lied or deceive his his father Abraham lied that his his wife was his sister see see there was no one worthy so God has to come now in person himself Amen to pay the price of sin and so Hebrews 10:4 it says in verse 4 for it is not possible that the blood of go bulls and of goats should take away sins in burth offerings and sacrifice for sin thou Hast had no pleasure and every priest has stand this daily ministering offerings often time the same sacrifices see which can never take away sins but this man verse 12 who is this man Jesus our lord and savior Hallelujah after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God we know the right hand is power and authority by one for by one suffering he ha perfected forever Hallelujah them that are Sanctified hallelujah amen he took our sins away amen amen the Bible said in Isaiah 53:5 he was wounded for our transgression Jesus amen was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed we are free we're saved amen we have been forgiven Justified Sanctified amen and now filled with the holy spirit amen glory to God now see so the third Dwelling Place of God was his son Jesus a body that has been prepared for God to dwell in amen let's read some scriptures Isaiah 9 96 the Old Testament has prophesied the coming of Jesus for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and a government shall be upon his shoulder amen and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God so the son will be Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of Fe so praise God we can see here the revelation of the godhead we cannot see two persons here no we see two offices the fatherhood and the sunship amen becoming one Jesus said I and the father are one he that had seen me had seen the father for no man had seen God at any time amen praise God here in 1 Timothy 3:16 it it has been made clear and without controversy no debate no argument amen great is the mystery of godliness so it's a mystery it's hidden from the eyes of the simple man God was manifest In the Flesh amen God coming down in flesh in unveiling of God brother Ram said not is Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament wow he's the same God just changing his form amen let's read some more he said here in unveiling of God God veiled in Jesus to do the work of redemption at the cross God could not die in the spirit he's Eternal but he had to put on a mask Hallelujah and act the part of death right he did die who died God died for you in flesh form amen he couldn't do it in his God form yeah he had to do it in sun form as a son of man on Earth Amen in the talken he said that's exactly what he was we handled God the Bible said amen he repeated the scripture without controversy great is the mystery of godliness amen we handled him with our hands that body was God see it was not a a product of Mary and Joseph no it was God himself creating his own blood cell the sperm and the Egg amen he was God all over in the form of a human being wow it's really a mystery to some people they couldn't faom how God from a spirit form could amen take the form of a man but here brother random said Jesus was God in the form of a man that's right that's hard for people to swallow he wasn't nothing less than God he was God manifested in flesh he was the creator in his own creation amen he said I believe him to be God Jesus Christ so he's not just a man yes as a man he he felt you know he he got tired but when he he uh arose from asleep you know he rebuked the winds amen peace be still amen and uh the the the uh weather you know followed him you know the the winds and the wind uh the the the waves amen see he he hungered and was looking for food from a fig tree but he couldn't find any fruit and he cursed the Fig Tre right amen but when he preached to 5,000 people amen he took two two fishes and five loaves of bread and produce 5,000 in amen excluding women and children even 12 basket amen there was an extra one for each Apostle as a take home PR Hallelujah that is the kind of God that we serve Hallelujah he can multiply amen anything that you have in your hand amen I heard a preacher said God is addition and multiplication yes he is not a minus or division amen praise the Lord amen is the the false Christ that divide the church you know amen praise the Lord or take away you know the power from the church Hallelujah why little Bethlehem he said we are not saved by the blood of a Jew or the blood of a gentile we are saved by the blood of God he was God nothing less he wasn't Jew nor Gentile if he was a Jew or a gentile we are all lost he was God in flesh that's right I don't worship a Jew I worship God when I worship Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know some some religious people say oh you cannot worship a man Jesus was a man he died see but brother said I worship God when I worship Jesus Christ amen because he was God in flesh it was Jehovah in a maner let's read a quotation because we would like to see what the prophet you know the message is what brings us back to the scriptures amen it should have been striking Jehovah a baby a baby crying in a Manger Jehovah God it ought to have been striking Jehovah a teenage boy playing Jehovah driving nails as a carpenter oh my above all Jehovah nailed to a cross to save Sinners it should have been striking praise the Lord hallelujah it has to be God himself or else all the glory will go to someone else amen it has to be God himself glorify you know brother Bram said God wanted to be a savior so there has to be something someone that that's going to fall so that he can display his attribute as a savior amen as a Healer right amen as a judge as a king so all this things as a father he has to got got to have children amen so now let's move on here he continued on he said God was manifest in the flesh it doesn't say a thing about a first or a second or a third person here it says God was manifest in flesh one God that one God was manifested in flesh and that oh to settle it God came in a human form that didn't make him another God he was God the same God and it was a revelation then it's a revelation now one God that's why we have to be baptized under one name in the name of Jesus Christ the only name given on Earth whereby man must be saved no other name not the name of Jehovah El Shai Elohim or Yahweh it has to be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because when he said baptize in the name that's singular and the name of the father is Lord the name of the son is Jesus the name of the Holy Ghost is Christ the anointed one so the name of the father and of the son and of the Hol holy spirit is Lord Jesus Christ and all the Christians in the Bible were all baptized in that name you can never find anyone in the in the Bible who's been baptized in the titles of father son Holy Ghost because they the apostles needed the revelation of that name and they have to T in Amen in Jerusalem for 10 days until they be inju with power from on high and the teacher the Holy Ghost will guide them into all truth and would know the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so Prophet The Prophet said three offices not three persons amen because three persons it's it's po what do you call it uh polytheism amen see many gods just like the the Romans the Greeks they worship you know Zeos Jupiter and they tried to worship many God they put the name of Peter and uh in in in in uh replacement of of of Jupiter and and Venus was replaced by the name of Mary see and so he said here I believe that the tree Father Son and Holy Ghost is one and they are three offices of the one God he live in the fatherhood in the pillar of fire he live in the sunship in Jesus Christ and he lives in now in the Holy Ghost in his church the same Lord Jesus that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us is with us this day amongst us in the form of the Holy Spirit you know brother Dale you're just one person right amen but you're a father to your children and you're a grandpa to your grandchildren you're a husband to your wife and you're a son to your father so you have four offices brother and God had three offices one God with three offices Father Son and Holy Spirit glory to Jesus amen so we can see here in a little chart I I made a little chart here you know thanks to the technology you know that we can use the monitor you know to show our notes yeah yeah and in graphics to make it more you know understandable simple for people to can to see the notes see so Father Son and Holy Ghost are titles or offices and see the pillar of fire Jesus and the Holy Ghost was God above us fatherhood God With Us Jesus Emanuel and now God in us the holy spirit amen Old Testament New Testament and the Seven Church ages that's the dispensation of these three offices and the name of course is Lord Jesus Christ amen the purposes is creation for the for the Lord the fatherhood and Redemption for the sunship and regeneration by the Holy Spirit praise the Lord amen can we give him a glory brothers and sister amen worship him thank God for the Revelation amen we're not confused on the godhead amen praise God hallelujah now Jesus before he has ended up promised to send the Holy Ghost we can read it in John 16:7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter which is the Holy Ghost will not come to you but if I depart I will send him to you remember Peter never had a holy ghost when Jesus was still here he even chopped the the ear of a a Roman soldier he even denied Jesus three times before the Rod he didn't have the Holy Spirit he received it on the day of Pentecost amen why Jesus said Peter I have prayed for you three times he asked Peter Peter do you love me and Peter said Lord I love you I will do everything uh I will not let uh the Romans you know catch you and see that was his you know his commitment but see Jesus said I have already prayed for you Peter amen when the when you get converted strengthen your brethren amen so he had to wait for that Holy Spirit baptism on the day of Pentecost because before he could get the power Amen to stand Amen on the principle of Christianity John 1417 even the spirit of truit whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him talking to the Believers Hallelujah for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I personal pronoun will come to you amen so where is Jesus today in spirit form is in our heart amen we have become the Temple of the holy spirit amen praise God while his body sitting on the throne and his father's throne but one day in the Rapture that body will rise again and will come again and we will meet him in the air for the Bible said in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 to 18 for the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with a shout the message amen with a voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet with the trumpet and the dead in Christ shall rise first from Pentecost to the 7 Church ages until now they will rise first and we which are alive and remain remain where remain in the faith amen shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air wherefore Comfort one another with this words amen that's our comfort right now Hallelujah so the fourth Dwelling Places or place of God is the holy spirit or is is the the believer where in the holy spirit amen comes down on you when when you repent acts 238 Peter said repent and and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you for what for the remission of sins that's first and then what second you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen for This Promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is unto you to your children's children to them that's are far up even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so the the fourth place of God's amen resting place is the believer right acts 18 but she shall receive the power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you yes sir so if you're not yet baptized with the Holy Ghost you don't have power to serve God you don't have the power to overcome sin you know people just you know come and go you know they have no commitment because they have no Holy Ghost yet but once the Holy Ghost is in you amen you will not be living on your own anymore just just like Paul said it is not I that liveth but it's Christ Living in me Amen in the life that I live I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen when you say Amen to the word brother said it's not you amening it's the holy spirit in you saying I wrote that word amen I was the one who wrote that word see and ye shall be Witnesses once you receive the Holy Ghost you can have witness amen I I heard Jehovah's Witnesses come to to know houses and when you ask them are you baptized by the Holy Ghost I don't know whether I have how can you be a witness when the Bible said you can only be a witness when you have been filled with the power of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so this light today is again indwelling in every born again Christian in the form of the Holy Ghost let's read 1 Corinthians 6 19 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God ye are not your own so we don't own ourselves anymore we've been bought with a price so like for example this this microphone if I bought this nobody can take this away from me so amen you were bought with a price Satan has no more no more rights to you amen because you've been redeemed you've been amen claimed back amen the word redeem means Amen to to bring back one the one ones that was lost something that uh has to go back to its original condition amen we were we came from God and we will go back to God amen we're not we're not Earthly creatures we're just passing by passing through here we're we're pilgrims strangers sojourners in this land and one day we will leave everything behind you leave your job your home amen your education amen so you must prepare because as you can see amen the time is a is uh short laia is a quick Short age if you count the number of years of you know of ephesia to uh

we're not counting on that because the said prepare any time he will come like a thief in the night every 2,000 years something happens amen praise God so we we are over 2,000 years now I believe amen

taste see hear smell and feel inside of us is a spirit amen that's that has five inlets which is memory reasoning affection conscience and Imagination but inside of you is a soul and that Soul has only two faculties it's either Faith or doubt amen so if you're a Christian amen you will have faith you will believe amen others can never believe because in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken amen look at the quote the prophet said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn only the elect can be born again because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in N Seed there is nothing to Quicken so praise God for the seed how many believes you have a seed of God this morning amen glory Every Man Has a soul but not

it's in your heart amen you can he said yeah whatever you bind on earth right shall be bound in heaven and whatever you lose on Earth shall be lose in heaven let's read a quote in Revelation chter 4 number three now God has a mercy seat today to be guarded you believe that that's where the mercy seat found in the heart of man where did it come in the heart of man at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is God come into the human heart amen the control tower The Mercy Seat is in the heart see he said here the shikina glory in the human heart so it's no longer in a tent no the shikina glory amen has now amen set in the heart of man amen it's God's presence when a man is walking or a woman he is reflecting the she kind of Glory so let's look at look at look look at the Shina glory in the Old Testament hallelujah amen it was divided into three right outer Court inner Court holy of holies now the outer court is our physical body the inner court is your spirit but the holy of holy is your soul Hallelujah and God the sh glory is now dwelling in that soul of your amen praise the Lord that's why God said you know I will not write my laws again in taets of stone I will write my laws where in the heart of man and their mind I will write the mind of Christ should be in you amen praise God can we follow soul body soul and spir Body Spirit and soul praise the Lord now brother Ram was talking about the Veil The Veil having been rent you know when Jesus was crucified amen the veil was rent into two in the temple and on that window at the back you can see Jesus there Amen in at the at the cross on Calvary and he was the shikina glory now that amen that came out of the old Temple and here bam said Aeron took the blood of a substitutionary debt and went into the holy of holies with it but Jesus took his own blood and entered the holy of holies to redeem you and to tear down the middle wall of partian Hallelujah that you yourself might come into the shikina glory not just the priest the levitical priesthood but the mdic priesthood now amen in the bride form can now enter into that kind of Glory with him and live under the blessings of God Redeemed by the blood of God so before poor to be outside of the holy of holies the she kind of Glory it's death but now amen uh rather to be now it's to be outside of that it's death here amen he said if you find yourself outside that Veil which is death to stay out will you by faith this morning by God's help say Lord help me I want to break through that Veil I want to to get in there where you are at to see the full word of God Amen so the veil has been rent amen and the Shina Glory which is the presence of the Holy Spirit has been amen revealed to the people the holy spirit for without the holy spirit amen you you are none of his the Bible say you cannot go in a Rapture without the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the oil that the wise virgin received when they heard a Midnight Cry in Matthew 25 there was a Midnight Cry it says behold the bridegroom cometh amen and all those virgins you know amen prepared their lamps but the five foolish didn't have it and the five wise had it amen it's a type of the baptism of the holy spirit amen the Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption oh praise be to God Amen here we can read it in Colossians 1:21 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory without the Holy Spirit which is Christ in you there will be no glorification amen grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you seal until the day of your Redemption glory to God now let's read some more quotation amen I I like this golden nuggets from the message he said here remember each one of you from tonight on remember you are God's Billboards what's a billboard for to advertise the kingdom Hallelujah you're God's advertising agent praise God how many would want to be God's advertising agent amen you are witnesses he said here the world will look at you to see what Christ is amen your written episods see so we don't want to smear a big lot of stuff on there that testify about the things that we really are not so he said let's first be that let's be born again let's be Christians then when we be that then the word will see Christ in you and me we are Christ Representatives we are ambassadors now amen see let's prach some more quote he said you are God's ambassadors excuse me they have everything that heaven owns behind them they are ambassadors of the throne talking about the believer absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority amen he has given us you know the authority the power to cast out Devils to heal the sick in his name amen we are his his Ambassador what is a witness an ambassador Amen to is to come and witness something the whole powers of Heaven listen is right in your hands my we're talking about another dimension here that's right put on your spiritual helmets the whole powers of Heaven is right in your hand amen glory to God oh why do we set and the church is Barren and we set dormant is because that we don't recognize these things when the bride recognizes these things amen then the Rapture will come and she will be an invincible Army glory to God he called us little Messiah heads now he's talking about you now amen know who you are and the Messiah I was talking about Messiah he said Messiah hats they are the light of the church today the light of the world ye are the light of the world Jesus said you're a candle that sets on a hill amen that can be seen everywhere we are the light yes if we are we reflect his Messiah light remember brother said the Sun and the Moon they're like husbands and wives you know in the absence of the Sun the moon reflects the light of the sun and the church in the absence of Jesus Christ you reflect the light the message the gospel to this world and God has little stars in there you know the messengers are little lights in every age as well amen and we are the light of the world he wants Messiah heads he wants men and women who have signs and wonders anointed ones see so being a bride is not just coming to church you know and feeling uh yourself uh a Pew you see you are God's Messiah heads extension we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone you represent the Lord in our generation see praise God what our responsibility that we carry because of the power that was vested in US amen praise God so he wants real Christians committed Amen to his job to to the work of of God he said go ye into all the world see that's a Great Commission not just in sna brother I I I know you're going to El Salvador you've been to Africa see amen go into all the world and preach the gospel Amen to all creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be condemned so we give them a choice We Don't Force this message to anyone amen it's by choice they're a free moral agent thank you Jesus now this same pillar of cloud and Pillar of Fire is with us today yes see amen we have a messenger where in that pillar of f was taken by a amen a mechanical camera and showing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that picture of brother ranham he said don't look at at at at uh at me he said don't look look at the baldheaded man there look at the presence of the Lord amen him himself having a selfie with the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so that pillar of cloud and fire on 1933 came down on that Ohio River and there was a voice amen while he was baptizing the 17th person the voice said as John the Baptist foran the first coming of Christ your message will foron the second coming of Christ amen so now you have to recognize Malachi 456 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children that's John the Baptist and the Heart of the children or the fathers uh to the father to the children was John and the children back to the Pentecostal fathers Is Us two ministries of Elijah amen hallelujah Revelation 10 amen 1-1 that might the angel the cloud came down in 1963 bringing us the open book amen bringing the open amen the Seven Seals amen given to the prophet to preach it amen the book was open that Mighty angel came down with a open book The the seventh angel preached from it and now the bride is eating the book amen amen we're now we took the book from the angel we ate it it was sweet in our mouth and beater in our belly you know there's suffering persecution when you receive this message but the Revelation 10 verse 11 it says Thou must prophesy again thou must preach declare this message again to Nations colors and races and that's what we're doing right now that's the bride min Min amen thank you Lord hallelujah he said this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers see brother ranam in the ministry of Elijah you know rebuking the women with their makeups you know with their you know the Jezebel of the day and the Ahab politics and religion you know he lambasted them and uh and presented Jesus Christ to this generation that was his first commission but the second commission that he says he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders so who will reveal it brother Bram not any other man in the future see he revealed it because the seven Thunders he said the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals amen the seven seals are just coverings of the book when the seals open there was Thunder there was a mystery truth amen there was a message you know it was not permitted unto John to write the real uh event he just wrote symbols you know he wrote a white horse rider a red horse rider a black horse a Pale Horse Souls under the other but when the seventh angel message came he gave us the mystery truths of what those things are amen amen we didn't even know that the souls under the altar were the 6 million Jews amen that were killed by Hitler muscolini amen it was it was written there by John in the island of Patmos but only in our age we found out the real meaning of the white horse rider you know with a crown and with a with a a uh bow with no Arrow it was a bluffer you know that was the nikan doctrine and then came the red horse rider with a sword killing the Christians during the Dark Ages the holy Inquisition with the we with that uh you know uh the The Sword and then the pale horse rider as we know with a with the balance amen was uh when the Catholic church amen uh they uh they uh got uh people's money by you know requiring them nenas and prayer for those that are in purgatory amen if you don't give money and prayer amen those soul H in the Purgatory will will go down to Hell so but if you pay you know and they will be promoted to Heaven there's no such thing in the Bible amen praise God so these things were exposed Amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen and now we know we are in the dark horse rider amen Pale Horse Rider age we're in amen death and Hell Followed him amen we know that that spiritual death 666 the mark of the beast that will come at the end of this age amen praise God so but we have an eagle anointing amen that combed amen the force of the P horse amen when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise a standard the eagle anointing that will bring us in a Rapture amen will fly away amen praise God will fly one day in a in a catching away in a body chains praise the Lord amen so these divinely revealed mystery truths will be will literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so all the Mysteries have been revealed I believe so only the time of his coming was not given the exact time because if he will give it you know people will just be lukewarm and complacent oh the date is this date so I'll just you know serve the Lord when that date comes uh you know near here so anytime the Lord will come so be prepared my brothers and sisters be ready H Hallelujah okay in this last days there is again another people in the land that's us who under their messenger you know the seventh messenger that's our brother Bram you know Paul was the first Messenger to Ephesus amen and we have arus to smina Martin to pergamus and then Columba to chyra Luther to Sardis Wesley to Philadelphia and our messenger the last age lisian age is none other than William Maran Branham for for those who do doesn't know him yet and so we the people in the land who under their messenger we will be the final voice to the final age you have a role to fulfill amen Ministry a Ministry to fulfill because I believe amen we are the voice of many Waters the Bible said amen praise God we are the the uh Rebecca of the day Bram was the iler that that that that L for a wife for Isaac and Isaac is our Jesus and the same camel that Rebecca you know uh uh gave drink to the same camel was the one who carried her to Isaac and and the same message that we are eating we are amen uh hearing is the same message that will bring us to our Rapture to meet the Lord in the air praise God hallelujah it says here the word is in the brde as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ not the mind of a denomination for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name Hallelujah for she has thus said the Lord she has thus said the Lord those in the bride will only do his will no one can make them do otherwise no one can deceive the elect they have doed the Lord or they keep still they have discernment they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word listen here Jesus he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride Jesus is working through you she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill Jesus will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen so we're not just you know uh church members here amen we are the channels of blessing amen whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven so you're bringing both mercy and judgment whosoever curses his spiritual Israel shall be cursed whosoever blesses you shall be blessed so wherever you go you carry blessing in a curse if somebody curses you amen Jesus said it's better for him that a millstone be hang on his NE be thrown on the depths of the sea than to offend the little ones that believeth in me so we don't fear we don't worry amen if God be for us who can be against us amen praise the Lord hallelujah greater is he who is in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah glory to God now we're going to close in a little bit and confirmation of the commission message 1962 he said Jesus is so close to coming to the earth now until his power has begin to catch the people and winding them getting them ready for the bride getting ready to be caught up in the Rapture a church that that will just fit exactly amen hallelujah to be taken up through its power will draw all the rest of them that's born again out of the earth Jesus is com coming hallelujah amen just like in the days of Noah you know he had that message he was the prophet amen he had that message come into the ark for 120 years he preached amen praise God and only eight people were saved oh my 120 years of preaching only eight people were saved Noah and his wife ham Shem japet and their wives all the rest perish in in blood and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man see so praise God hold on to that to that uh amen hope of glory that you have amen for in the church there will be three kinds of Believers in every group there will be three make believer just like Judas unbelievers just like the 70 ministers who followed him because of of the the bread and the you know the miracle but later on when he preached the third pool he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you said oh are we going to be cannibals we'll eat his his flesh or are we going to be bonfires we'll drink his blood so they said let's let's uh let's get out from the time on you will read in John chapter 6 verse 66 John 666 amen they walk no more with him oh my but there was Peter yeah and the other true Apostles the True Believers amen make Believers unbelievers True Believers and Jesus said Peter will you also go away and Peter said Lord where shall we go thou alone has the words of eternal life praise the Lord amen so be it for us as wellah amen we've seen the Revelation no one can take us away can separate us from the love of this message amen not even the sword amen Paul said not even you know poverty amen not uh not nothing can separate us from the love amen praise God in Christ so let's let's look at the timeline for the end times before we move on to the last dwelling place so the first Dwelling Place was the was in heaven the second was in the tent the Tabernacle amen and the sh kind of Glory the third dwelling place is Jesus Christ his son and the fourth dwelling place is the bride of Christ amen so here is the transition again we can read from the message question and answers number four he said the bride when she's taken from the church then the church AIDS will cease amen lysia goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and A2 years while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon Israel and then comes the Battle of our magedon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with a groom for a thousand years the Millennium Reign on Earth Hallelujah then comes after that the white Rome judgment after that comes the new heavens and the new Earth and the new city coming down from God out of Heaven eternity and time Blends together praise the Lord so we're nearing amen amen we're nearing the Rapture tribulation strikes amen the Antichrist will set up the One World Government one world religion amen and will will uh you know hunt down the foolish virgins and 144,000 and then come comes the third world war amen and our magedon you know Iran Russia the King of the North amen attacks Israel and Jesus Revelation 19 amen comes down from heaven on White Horse amen hallelujah with a bride his armies also amen and then the Millennium will set in and the bride the rightous shall walk upon the ashes of the wicked and then we will reign and Rule with Christ for a thousand years in glorified bodies amen praise God the Rapture when the Rapture takes place we will be just like him amen we will have a glorified body we will meet the theophany in the air the theophany comes down and meet amen we meet with our redeemed body and we become glorified body just like the body of Jesus you can pass through walls you can appear you can disappear amen you know you will never die you will never feel pain amen just like you know the two disciples from emus they never recognized Jesus because he went back to a young manam you Brothers when the Rapture takes place you'll be like 21 years old that's man he met them beyond the curtain of time right sisters will be like 18 years old so sister Luan look at your picture when you were 18 years old and that will be how you look at like amen when the Rapture take place but amen we will no longer feel no more sickness no more dying amen praise God we will rule and reign with Christ in the Millennium in that kind of body just like Adam and Eve amen because Jesus is the second Adam and we will be the second Eve for the honeymoon of Jesus Amen what Adam and Eve failed in the bride and Jesus will continue glory to God for 1,000 years and then after that amen I believe for Israel before before amen our magedon Jesus will send the two prophets yes he said here the them two prophets will rise on the scene during the time and called 144,000 Jews then what will take place then the mark of the beast Revelation 13 will set in cuz he holds all the Commerce and trade you know we're going into you know digital currency now you know banks in America are closing you know paper money they're trying to go get uh uh get uh away with it so we can see then the mark of the beast we know there the mark in the forehead and the Hand which no man can buy or C except him that has the mark of the beast but thank God veram said the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory we won't have to go through that oh thanks be to God the bride will never go to the tribulation because why Jesus already paid went through our tribulation at the cross of Calvary we were in there amen the bride is in Jesus just like Eve was in adom amen we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone so we don't have to go through any tribulation period but we will feel the squeeze amen The Squeeze will come you know as we can see the pandemic you know like medical you know the the vaccination that has passed you know it has been tested that was a dress rehearsal of the upcoming you know uh New World Order so but after that amen amen after everything after the Millennium then we will amen Rule and reign with Christ amen in the new Heaven and new earth Revelation 21 now this is the fifth dwelling place and I saw and new Heaven and a new Earth and the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away there was no more sea you know brother said the sea had already exploded because of the heat you know and water is hydrogen and oxygen both are combustible materials so in the new Heaven and Earth amen you don't need any sheep here or boat amen you can walk everywhere there's no more sea hallelujah amen Hallelujah and it says I saw John I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven you know that's the mansion that Jesus said I'm preparing for you amen the Rapture will be up there in the palace but in uh the new heaven Earth it will come down coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men eternity and time Embrace together he will dwell in them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain oh I like that no more arthritis my brothers and sister amen for the former things are passed away amen so we're looking forward to these things to come amen so press on my brothers sisters fight a good fight of Faith until you reach that City amen what else he said here and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain shed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jper stone clear as Crystal and it had a wall great and high had 12 gates and the names written there on are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel and on the East three gates and on the north three gates South three gates West three gates and the all of us City had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the the lamb so we can see like uh this uh chart here from a top view bird's eye view you can see there are 12 gates after the name name after the the tribes of Israel and the the post you know the the what we call the uh the the post yes the foundations were named after the apostles and the bride and the bridegroom the king and queen will be on top of that amen the palace because Jesus said he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne as I am seated in my father's Throne amen so the righteous one will be outside the foolish virgin will be saved they'll be outside amen of the temple as the prophet said you can read the future home of the Heavenly uh bridegroom of the Earthly bride is all in there explained so now amen the 144,000 will be there there will be our servants the unics the attendants the bride see think of it my brothers and sisters Israel who supposed to be the the the the the nation of God the people of God because they rejected the Messiah God blinded their eyes so that the gospel can go out of Israel and can reach us Gentiles idolators amen amen what a love he chose a gentile bride instead of the Israel the Jewish bride amen so they will there be there attending to us praise God Amen so what a privilege and honor amen that's why the Bible said lay aside every weight oh yes and the sin that easily beset us and let us run this race with patience looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen as we close I believe it's exactly 12 now amen I'm I'm about to close and the SE Li at Four Square and the length is as large as the breath and measure the city with the re amen 12,000 fongs the length the bread and the height of it are equal brother brandham said it's not a cube it's like a pyramid because a pyramid has the same length breadth and height and he measured the wall of an of the Rob 144 cubits the prophet said 15,000 miles around according to the measure of a man that is of the Angel and the building of the wall of it was of Jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass oh my people are fighting for go gold here you know but there amen the city will be pure gold excuse me and the and the road there you know the Bible said the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate was one Pearl and the street of the city was pure gold the the street was pure gold and as it was transparent glass so my brother and sister we have a amen a long way to go and reach this place and only those who will endure amen the Bible said he that inure it till the end shall be saved shall be amen amen living in that place and man you look at here and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun no more sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light there on that Pillar of Fire will lighten the whole earth amen the prophet said it's the same structure amen all the sin the diseases Satan will be amen will be dissolved from on top of it amen but the same structure is the same structure that the new Heaven and Earth will come down you see so there's no replacement amen uh it's just a a cleansing of you know the cosmos amen the worldly system in this in this earth now finally and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor unto it and the gates of it shall not be shut all Shout At All by day for there shall be no more night there no more sleeping my brothers and sister amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus finally and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or make it a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book book of life so my brothers and sisters amen these are the promises of God to us it's s amen that you cannot faom amen how God Amen planned this
