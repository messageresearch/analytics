[31:21] you see it sister Luanne that was your
[31:24] first time since
[31:26] my my second time you know something
[31:29] that I noticed by the deal is uh when we
[31:32] were there three years ago
[31:34] because of the accident
[31:36] I mean that kept us going in uh occupied
[31:40] for all but just about two weeks there

[32:14] it's it's hard you know you can't
[32:16] compare
[32:18] yeah I'm giving a testimon here you
[32:20] can't compare
[32:21] them with us
[32:23] that's such a difference you cannot
[32:25] compare
[32:27] the things that I I got to share with
[32:29] you some of the things that I noticed
[32:31] you you know you
[32:34] I kind of shake my head because
[32:37] you know it's like they're living in the
[32:40] 1940s
[32:43] 1930s 1940s
[32:46] the house everything I mean you saw a
[32:49] picture of uh this family that uh
[32:53] uh is uh
[32:55] is there Kleenex here no
[33:01] oh good good okay uh the family that
[33:05] lives in the school room
[33:10] just that law
[33:12] you sister think about this one okay
[33:16] you haven't got a stove
[33:18] you haven't got a hot plate
[33:20] all you do is you go outside light a
[33:23] fire
[33:23] and that's it that's your stove
[33:26] day after day after day
[33:29] and you've seen that family they're not
[33:31] you know she's got kids husband
[33:35] and uh when we uh when we took it to the
[33:38] house there right behind the church and
[33:40] she had tears in her eyes and I I you
[33:43] know and that touched me
[33:45] but we went inside and looked at the the
[33:48] house
[33:53] uh you know and she had tears in her
[33:56] eyes she was so Overjoyed I believe
[33:58] inside
[33:59] you know to to be able to have at her
[34:02] home a house
[34:04] you know for the family and uh I I was
[34:08] looking around looking at the house and
[34:10] that and
[34:11] my goodness but the thing is they don't
[34:15] have very much
[34:17] and what they do have
[34:19] it's it's it's very special to them you
[34:22] know it it's like you know growing your
[34:25] own crops and that's it what you eat
[34:27] today is what you grow with today
[34:29] or to for tomorrow
[34:32] oh
[34:33] what I noticed see I noticed two
[34:37] um
[34:41] I noticed the machine when we were
[34:42] traveling there
[34:44] I noticed that some Machinery they had
[34:47] it was pretty looked pretty good
[34:49] some big machineries and graders and you
[34:52] know things like that I thought well
[34:53] that's
[34:54] I don't know where it comes from maybe
[34:56] it was donated by China maybe or given
[34:59] by China built roads over there from
[35:01] what I heard
[35:04] but for the most part they they live
[35:06] right off the land
[35:09] whatever they can do
[35:11] and it's not like here you know
[35:14] you want some meat you can go in the
[35:17] forest if it's seasoned get a deer they
[35:19] can't do that over there they don't even
[35:21] have a gun
[35:23] and most of them don't have a gun or a
[35:25] license to do and they wouldn't do it
[35:27] anyway
[35:30] so it's it's quite it's quite something
[35:31] I notice when we're traveling on the
[35:34] road brother Dale that they were doing
[35:36] some construction on the road remember
[35:37] that
[35:39] I couldn't believe now what I'm saying
[35:42] is I'm not putting the people down
[35:45] okay if I'm putting anybody down it's
[35:47] the government it's like it's
[35:49] politicians the government okay now that
[35:52] I want to go on on record saying that
[35:55] it's not the people
[35:57] but as we're traveling they were doing
[35:59] construction on the road they were
[36:00] leaving uh uh giving putting pavement on
[36:03] the road
[36:04] and I couldn't really they had a strip
[36:07] looked like tar to me I think tar yeah
[36:10] it has tar on the road okay and then
[36:13] what is I forget they had a dump truck
[36:17] brother I what was in it
[36:20] that was it's powder form it was like a
[36:22] powder it's like they're going to spread
[36:24] it out and it's going to stick to the
[36:25] tire and it's going to get hard and
[36:27] that's your pavement
[36:29] yeah
[36:31] you know you do that over here they'd be
[36:33] laughing their heads off at you
[36:36] if you try to do something like that
[36:37] here the roads but and another thing too
[36:40] that struck me and I uh is when we were
[36:44] staying at brother Leo's house
[36:47] I'm just standing outside I was looking
[36:50] at the front door
[36:52] just above the front door maybe 10 feet
[36:54] up
[36:56] I could not believe what I saw
[36:59] they had wires
[37:01] bare wires no covering
[37:04] no panel
[37:05] bare wires hooked on and I looked at it
[37:09] and I said my goodness you know if you
[37:12] live in the in the time where they had
[37:13] tubes and knobs
[37:15] that's pretty well what they they have
[37:17] there
[37:18] yeah that's how far back they are the
[37:20] homes everything the thing is though
[37:22] that I want to bring across to you is
[37:24] this is even with the situation the way
[37:27] it is
[37:28] people are still happy
[37:33] you know you you got to go there to
[37:36] experience not just the environment the
[37:39] local and the area but the people
[37:43] the people and it's quite it's it's
[37:46] quite an experience I said before I came
[37:48] back I said we were still in Uganda
[37:53] I said I probably won't be coming back
[37:56] but I might
[38:02] I might
[38:04] if I if I got it right
[38:07] from you know who the Lord uh I might be
[38:10] going back
[38:11] but I couldn't I couldn't see it after
[38:13] we went through we visited the churches
[38:15] and that I thought no it's not gonna you
[38:18] know we're not gonna
[38:20] go back
[38:21] but uh or I won't go back but uh
[38:26] but again it's it's quite something and
[38:28] I'm glad for this because I think I'm
[38:30] gonna I'm gonna go over it with the wife
[38:32] and show her you know everything that we
[38:35] went we've seen in her
[38:37] and uh well uh there's there is I do
[38:41] have a thought that inspiration I do
[38:43] have something so I and uh it's not
[38:46] going to take long but there's something
[38:48] that
[38:49] and I know I mentioned uh when I was
[38:51] there I mentioned something
[38:54] that some have it and some don't have it
[38:58] if you know what I mean
[39:00] and it's very much
[39:03] present over there
[39:05] you don't see it too much here because
[39:07] you know you got the middle glass over
[39:09] there it's poor Rich
[39:11] foreign Rich that's it and you can tell
[39:15] who's got it who has
[39:17] you know and it's sad to say that you
[39:21] know what I've seen and what I heard
[39:24] and what I felt over there it's sad to
[39:28] say that some that have it
[39:31] profess them to be
[39:33] Christians
[39:35] believers
[39:36] okay keep them to themselves
[39:40] and and that was my that's what I had
[39:43] this morning I I said it
[39:45] morning
[39:47] good morning
[39:48] good to see you I just want to read some
[39:51] scriptures uh if you want to stand
[39:55] Matthew I want to turn to Matthew 10.
[40:06] okay 10
[40:08] 26 and 27
[40:11] verses 26 and 27.
[40:16] and it reads like this 26 27 fear them
[40:19] not therefore for there is nothing
[40:20] covered then not thou shall not be
[40:22] revealed
[40:24] and hid that shall not be known
[40:27] what I tell you in darkness that speak
[40:29] ye in light and what you hear in the ear
[40:32] that preach ye upon the house stops
[40:36] may the Lord has blessing to the reading
[40:38] of this word you may be seated
[40:43] so verse 27 it says and that preach ye
[40:47] upon the house stops
[40:50] don't we need that
[40:54] you know the scripture says correction
[40:56] starts at the house of God
[40:59] as long as this the house of God
[41:03] you know if it's anointed by God to be
[41:06] the host of God I'll say it that way now
[41:09] I'm not here to judge
[41:11] you know churches
[41:13] people not to but just to preach the
[41:16] word
[41:18] when I was when I was there wrote a deal
[41:20] they kept saying pastor Jim Pastor Jim I
[41:22] said because I'm not a pastor
[41:25] I'm a teacher
[41:27] that's my that's my Ministry okay I'm a
[41:30] teacher so I just want to lay on record
[41:32] so so okay so
[41:36] appreciate it on the house stops
[41:41] you know the Bible says
[41:43] you know if there's if there's something
[41:46] to be said if God wants something said
[41:50] then he has to uh he has to get somebody
[41:53] to speak for him
[41:56] and there's there's things that I've
[41:58] seen as things that I heard
[42:00] that really bother that it bothered me
[42:03] to a certain extent
[42:04] and and I believe that
[42:07] God cares
[42:10] cares about his word cares about his
[42:12] people
[42:13] their children
[42:14] and he cares about those that don't have
[42:17] it
[42:18] as well as those that have it
[42:21] now God blesses you
[42:23] you know
[42:25] if you uh you reap what you sow
[42:28] if you sow much you'll read much
[42:31] but if you re if you sow little you read
[42:35] little now that's the law of God
[42:37] especially too when you go to Malachi
[42:40] where it says that you open the windows
[42:42] of Heaven
[42:43] if wife you obey the word
[42:46] so if you bear the word you'll open the
[42:48] windows of heaven so some people are
[42:49] really blessed and I thank God for that
[42:53] now I'm talking about people in this
[42:56] message
[42:57] not denominations out there okay people
[43:00] in Vietnam in in this message
[43:03] that if God has blessed you and I
[43:05] probably this is going live that's good
[43:07] if this you know if if God has blessed
[43:10] you well thank God for that
[43:13] but the thing is that bothered me when I
[43:17] was there because I heard this and
[43:19] bothers me now is that some have it a
[43:23] lot
[43:24] and some don't have it
[43:27] in this message
[43:30] somebody came to brother Brenham
[43:33] and offer them a million dollars
[43:40] he refused it
[43:44] you know he could have been a very rich
[43:46] man
[43:48] because all the money that came he says
[43:50] he had checks coming in and he would
[43:52] sign them got in trouble with the tax
[43:54] man because of that because he didn't do
[43:56] it right but all those checks and
[43:58] everything that he signed and the money
[43:59] you know he only took what he needed to
[44:02] survive to live on
[44:04] that's all just what he had what and
[44:08] everything else went to the people
[44:12] you know when I was thinking about this
[44:13] brother Dale I was thinking you know
[44:17] if I let's say
[44:20] just to
[44:21] clarify to to let you know where I'm
[44:23] going
[44:24] say I had two uh two dollars in my
[44:27] pocket all right I have two dollars
[44:31] and I can live on one dollar today
[44:35] now Jesus says think
[44:38] take no thoughts of tomorrow because
[44:41] there's enough evil today so in other
[44:44] words don't worry about tomorrow
[44:46] okay so I have I have one dollar
[44:49] and that's going to be enough for me to
[44:52] get by today
[44:55] what about the other dollar
[44:58] give it
[44:59] to somebody
[45:00] that doesn't have it see that's my way
[45:03] of looking at it
[45:05] you know if we Brothers says eternal
[45:08] life
[45:09] eternal life is living for others
[45:12] now if we're living for others shouldn't
[45:15] we care so much more than we do for
[45:18] others
[45:20] going to Uganda opened my eyes
[45:24] brothers and sisters it opened my eyes
[45:27] uh I mean even if it's the second time
[45:30] there but it really opened my eyes
[45:32] especially this trip that we went by
[45:35] now it just opened my eyes now I'm going
[45:38] to read uh there's two other scriptures
[45:40] I want to get to
[45:43] uh let's go to first John
[45:46] excuse me
[45:48] let's go to first John
[45:56] and verses
[45:58] 17 and 18.
[46:00] now I'm just going to go on my Bible
[46:02] here so bear with me
[46:06] First John 3
[46:09] chapter 3
[46:12] and verses 17 and 18.
[46:16] okay
[46:20] remember I don't know if you remember
[46:21] brother Dale
[46:25] when we were there
[46:27] I said
[46:29] you know like some habits some don't
[46:32] why don't they chair some of the wealth
[46:36] those that have it
[46:37] they don't need all that
[46:40] only what they need to survive
[46:42] and so that was when I woke up this
[46:46] morning it was like okay yeah I remember
[46:50] thinking I said you know I even said why
[46:52] don't you know you get five you know we
[46:55] have to pay for our way there which
[46:57] that's fine with me
[47:00] yeah I'm okay
[47:02] but the thing is you can't do that all
[47:04] the time
[47:05] where are you going to get the money
[47:06] even if you have a million dollars you
[47:08] keep going pretty soon you don't have a
[47:09] million dollars
[47:11] you know it's simple but the thing is is
[47:13] that you know
[47:15] if you get five churches over there
[47:17] brother
[47:18] five churches in Uganda they could
[47:20] sponsor somebody like brother Dale or
[47:23] somebody to go
[47:24] no problem pay all these expenses now
[47:27] and it was it was this morning was on my
[47:29] mind now I just want to read some
[47:31] scriptures chapter 3 verses 17 and 18.
[47:36] that the whoso had this world's good and
[47:39] see it his brother have need and shudded
[47:41] up his vows of compassion from him how
[47:44] dwelleth the love of God in him
[47:48] and 18. my little children let us not in
[47:51] love in word neither in tongue but in
[47:53] deed and in truth
[47:56] shouted up his bottles of compassion
[47:58] from how dwell at the love of God in him
[48:01] we met
[48:04] I met
[48:05] some preachers are well off
[48:07] over there
[48:08] I've met some preachers that are not
[48:10] well off and they're pastors they're all
[48:12] pastors most I think all of them were
[48:14] pastors the ones we met all that so they
[48:16] have churches they have responsibilities
[48:18] they have a congregation I look at
[48:20] brother Vincent
[48:23] you know in this situation
[48:26] barely you might say
[48:29] well he lives off the land right
[48:32] gross whatever he eats he's asked to
[48:35] grow
[48:36] and then I get I see some other pastors
[48:38] preachers
[48:40] pretty well off
[48:41] I met some
[48:45] when I look at this scripture
[48:47] I'll dwell at the love of God in him
[48:51] when they see a brother
[48:54] that they're going to spend eternal life
[48:55] one day on the other side
[48:58] right
[49:00] now where where's the word of God how
[49:03] does how does God look at that
[49:05] that's that's my question how does God
[49:08] look at something like this okay
[49:11] okay turn to uh Matthew 16 27.
[49:18] Matthew 16 27.
[49:28] here's your answer
[49:31] for the son of man shall come in the
[49:33] glory of his father and his with his
[49:35] angels then he shall reward every man
[49:38] according to his works
[49:44] what have you done with the talent what
[49:46] have you done with what I've given you
[49:51] you see your brother I'm just kind of
[49:53] give you a story in storyline you see
[49:56] your brother in need you shut up your
[49:59] bowels from him
[50:01] you got more than you need to to get by
[50:04] to to to live and you see that a brother
[50:07] that hasn't got he's
[50:10] he hasn't got a meal
[50:13] like he might he might have a meal one
[50:15] day one one meal a day
[50:19] so this scripture here
[50:21] Matthew 16 27 for the son and that shall
[50:23] come the glory of his father with his
[50:25] angels and then he shall reward every
[50:26] man according to his works now this
[50:30] doesn't mean salvation
[50:32] that means that what have you done with
[50:34] God what God has given you
[50:38] and I I see that and you know that's
[50:41] just one place Uganda that's just one
[50:43] place how many third world countries are
[50:45] or places what about here in Canada
[50:49] now I'm not I'm not judging you this
[50:52] church because you've done so much I
[50:54] know this firsthand this church has done
[50:57] so much to help
[50:59] brother
[51:00] sister
[51:01] I've seen it so you know in the it you
[51:05] know for for the internet whoever's
[51:07] watching in the internet this church has
[51:09] done tremendously
[51:11] for the people
[51:14] so we're not get I don't want to be
[51:16] guilty
[51:19] I don't want to be guilty
[51:21] of uh like brother Vincent
[51:26] you know
[51:28] that to see uh to go there and to see
[51:30] him suffer it like that and just walk
[51:31] away you know we we helped we helped
[51:35] brother Vincent I should say the brother
[51:37] Dale
[51:38] while we were all there brother Jose it
[51:41] was it was it was just beautiful we had
[51:43] the means to do that
[51:47] we had to meet to do that
[51:49] I'm not asking for five churches over
[51:51] there to sponsor me to come over and
[51:53] preach
[51:55] you know okay
[52:00] no I'm not but
[52:02] it be God's will
[52:04] wouldn't that be the right way to do it
[52:08] right
[52:09] but you know it's it's you know where
[52:12] they at now for me financially now I got
[52:15] to pay my Visa off
[52:18] so
[52:19] it's not Max I didn't max it
[52:22] but I gotta pay you know I gotta pay my
[52:25] Visa off which is fine I I'm not worried
[52:27] about it I will I will with the Lord's
[52:30] help you know in all things I will
[52:33] so but my point is this
[52:35] okay
[52:37] that
[52:38] when we were there that that did bother
[52:41] me brother brother Dale not to the
[52:44] extent that it does now
[52:46] because you might say God has laid this
[52:48] on my shoulders as a burden
[52:51] okay
[52:53] to what
[52:55] to preach it from the housetops
[53:01] to preach it from the house stops if I
[53:03] have to
[53:04] Wherever I Go
[53:08] can you take if if you have whoever it
[53:12] is whoever it is if you have so much
[53:17] and more than what you need to get by to
[53:20] live on
[53:21] but you see your brother
[53:24] struggling no food no money they don't
[53:27] have they don't get government
[53:28] assistance over there
[53:31] it's you know brother Dale you know it
[53:34] sister Luanne
[53:35] mug you go over there and try to live
[53:39] the way they do you wouldn't stay there
[53:41] very long you come back
[53:44] you would come back the next day
[53:47] you would come back because it's not an
[53:49] easy life
[53:51] but the people the people are
[53:54] they they just they don't know
[53:57] they don't know what you give up they
[53:59] don't know giving up is what it means to
[54:02] give up
[54:04] because we were there and nothing has
[54:06] changed very much from the time that we
[54:08] went three years ago to this this uh
[54:10] this year nothing has changed that I
[54:12] could see nothing
[54:14] in Michiana nothing
[54:17] is the same so my point is this to you
[54:20] and to whoever is listening in
[54:23] is
[54:24] one day
[54:26] you'll have to answer to almighty God
[54:30] you'll have to answer is and and I want
[54:34] to read the scripture again for the son
[54:35] of man shall come in the glory of his
[54:36] father with his angels and then he shall
[54:38] reward every man according to his works
[54:42] one day we'll all stand before Jesus and
[54:45] you'll say
[54:47] what have you done
[54:50] I gave you talents
[54:52] when have you done
[54:53] whatever it might be it might be a gift
[54:57] that you have you know the Bible talks
[54:59] about talents the three towns to Ten Ten
[55:01] thousands five times one Talent okay
[55:03] what have you done well what I've given
[55:06] you
[55:06] I bless you
[55:09] and it's not it's not just I will say
[55:11] it's not just wealth as in money or land
[55:15] but what have you done
[55:17] with what the gift that I've given you
[55:20] to be a blessing
[55:22] to be a blessing
[55:24] whatever yes it's like
[55:27] let's say in the church here okay like
[55:30] you know brother Matt uh God bless you
[55:34] for standing I I did song leading for 25
[55:37] years so I know what it's like
[55:39] I know as I know when I started song
[55:41] leading I felt like crawling under the
[55:43] rugs so I don't know if you went through
[55:45] it but I did
[55:49] but I did it for 25 years so I know what
[55:51] it's like
[55:52] and everything that goes with it
[55:55] and it's
[55:57] bless you for doing it
[55:59] you know the the young boys I want to
[56:02] give credit to where it's due your own
[56:04] boys here playing the what you call the
[56:07] flute
[56:08] I got it right that's that's keep it up
[56:11] brother
[56:13] you know that's an instrument God has
[56:16] blessed you that way you play it play it
[56:20] for the glory of God remember that
[56:22] don't play it for anything else but for
[56:24] the glory of God
[56:26] amen and God will keep blessing you and
[56:29] and uh he'll make you where you can play
[56:32] the flute like
[56:33] nobody else
[56:36] but God has blessed you so so again I I
[56:39] have to kind of you know say this you
[56:42] know
[56:44] what's fair
[56:45] nothing is fair in this world
[56:48] nothing is fair you don't know what it
[56:50] is even in their own country now we get
[56:52] you know we're talk you know
[56:57] the the
[56:58] government over there and over here oh
[57:02] this is like day and night you know they
[57:04] keep the money over there they don't
[57:06] give it to the people here you get
[57:08] subsidies and you know the
[57:11] you're not going to starve
[57:13] you're not going to go you might have
[57:15] you might get a meal one one meal a day
[57:18] but don't worry you know no here the
[57:21] government takes care of his people
[57:23] and you know in a way
[57:26] but over there no
[57:27] so see how blessed we are today here in
[57:31] this country
[57:33] over there is totally different
[57:36] and my point is this that
[57:40] it's happening
[57:42] in the name of the message of the hour
[57:47] where you have
[57:49] some people that God has blessed them
[57:51] tremendously
[57:54] and you know God bless you for that
[57:58] but don't forget your brother
[58:02] and I seen it in Uganda and like I said
[58:04] this goes on in other countries too I
[58:07] mean I've heard stories
[58:10] you know
[58:11] of of preachers being millionaires
[58:15] millionaires in those countries
[58:18] uh and it's it's just unbelievable it's
[58:21] just unbelievable I I I shake my head
[58:26] I shake my it's going to be short this
[58:28] is going to be short you know I'm almost
[58:29] done
[58:31] but I just want to just want to let you
[58:33] know that you know this is this this is
[58:35] going on and the scripture says
[58:39] okay that every man according to his
[58:42] Works will receive a reward
[58:45] or criticism
[58:47] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:49] because all one one day we're going to
[58:51] step on the other side don't go see our
[58:53] brothers and sisters
[58:55] and
[58:56] that's going to come in into view
[59:00] you know he might he might even say he
[59:03] said see your brother over there
[59:05] I remember one day he will say that to
[59:08] whoever
[59:09] he'll say that remember there was a time
[59:12] that he had need and you were able to
[59:14] meet that need
[59:15] you know I said to brother Dale when we
[59:18] were there it says you know you see your
[59:20] brother I have need and you're able to
[59:22] help him
[59:23] you're able to help him whatever it is
[59:25] then help him
[59:27] don't walk away you say I'll pray for
[59:29] you God bless you I'll pray for you why
[59:32] see you know you know it's it to me is
[59:36] like it's like if we're going to be like
[59:39] the word says which is Christ's like
[59:42] word
[59:43] then we should be doing what the word
[59:46] says
[59:48] to me to me to me that that's is it's
[59:52] like uh I
[59:54] there's the division it seemed like
[59:56] there's the division
[59:58] going on in the message where you have
[1:00:01] those that have a lot and those that
[1:00:02] don't have it and and I said you know I
[1:00:05] I asked you uh brother Dan and I
[1:00:08] remember asking you you know all these
[1:00:10] preachers these pastors that came
[1:00:12] like are they all agreeing
[1:00:16] together or are they you know they all
[1:00:20] came for the dedication but do they
[1:00:22] agree with each other is there a unity
[1:00:25] in other words
[1:00:28] I doubt it
[1:00:30] I doubt it that there's a Unity over
[1:00:32] there that like it should be like it's
[1:00:35] it's like okay well you know they were
[1:00:37] invited so they came
[1:00:39] some of them
[1:00:41] or they all came those everybody imagine
[1:00:43] but some came because what for a show
[1:00:47] or maybe they wanna who knows
[1:00:50] get disciples after themselves
[1:00:54] who knows who knows but the thing is is
[1:00:57] that
[1:00:58] when you have see out there in the world
[1:01:02] okay and denominations I remember
[1:01:04] watching this uh video on on YouTube
[1:01:06] about preachers in denominations
[1:01:10] unbelievable what their the wealth that
[1:01:13] they have
[1:01:15] it's beyond anything that you can
[1:01:17] imagine
[1:01:18] billionaires not just millionaires
[1:01:21] billionaires okay and they what they're
[1:01:23] taking the money falsely to me
[1:01:26] falsely
[1:01:28] they're they're 10 they're given to
[1:01:29] people what
[1:01:31] uh Commandments of men Bible says and
[1:01:34] the people are swallowing it
[1:01:36] being deceived now we know the elect
[1:01:39] cannot be deceived
[1:01:41] so we know that so that's our that's the
[1:01:43] word of God that's our Safeguard but
[1:01:45] that's that's going on out there but
[1:01:48] you know the brother Brennan said this
[1:01:50] he says he won't leave you the devil
[1:01:52] won't leave you alone
[1:01:55] he'll bring somebody in or raise
[1:01:57] somebody in the congregation to cause
[1:01:59] problems
[1:02:00] okay so he won't he won't leave you
[1:02:02] alone so the thing is is that who is he
[1:02:05] going to attack he is going to attack
[1:02:06] the ministry
[1:02:08] now I'll take myself okay say uh all of
[1:02:12] a sudden one day I I feel like well I I
[1:02:15] should have a lot of money in this and
[1:02:16] that so what can you know how how can I
[1:02:18] do it my you know be popular or whatever
[1:02:21] okay you know three things that Birdman
[1:02:23] says that can ruin a Ministry you know
[1:02:26] women bunny popularity well say I did
[1:02:29] that okay now I know and I don't take
[1:02:32] credit for this okay bro you're my
[1:02:34] brothers and sisters I can I say this
[1:02:35] okay
[1:02:36] uh I know I do have a gift
[1:02:39] I I know I do I do okay I sing songs
[1:02:42] that people get blessed in that okay now
[1:02:45] that's the gift I could use that
[1:02:48] for my own good
[1:02:50] I could go on there in the world and
[1:02:52] sing and and and uh you know use that
[1:02:55] gift uh uh Elvis Presley did that
[1:03:01] he was raised in the Pentecostal Church
[1:03:03] in the system and he he uh he used this
[1:03:06] gift that he had what to make money be
[1:03:09] popular
[1:03:11] well I probably could do it but no I
[1:03:14] don't want to do that
[1:03:15] I'm not very much I don't have very much
[1:03:17] talent anyway on the guitar I I've seen
[1:03:19] people uh uh people play the guitar a
[1:03:22] lot better than than I do so you know
[1:03:25] but the thing is is that it's not it's
[1:03:28] not being able to play the guitar
[1:03:31] see it's not that the talent that I can
[1:03:34] do Jim LeBlanc I can be popular make
[1:03:37] money no is the gift
[1:03:40] God uses a gift to bless you
[1:03:43] see
[1:03:45] so it's it's the anointing you know
[1:03:48] David
[1:03:50] had a a a a a a gift from God he would
[1:03:54] play on his harp and and uh uh Saul the
[1:03:58] the the the evil spirits would leave
[1:04:00] Saul well that was a town that was
[1:04:02] something David had a gift for that
[1:04:05] now I I'm not totally comparing me to
[1:04:07] you know myself to David but the thing
[1:04:10] is is I've seen it I mean how many years
[1:04:12] 36 37 years now that since I heard the
[1:04:15] message and the first thing I did was
[1:04:17] play played the guitar and play and I
[1:04:20] seen uh services that that you know that
[1:04:23] happened but it you know the gift is not
[1:04:26] for me
[1:04:27] it's for the people
[1:04:30] I told the Lord I said let's keep me
[1:04:33] humble
[1:04:34] keep me humble because that's the only
[1:04:37] way that I can be a blessing to the
[1:04:39] people
[1:04:40] and and he asked he has kept me humble
[1:04:44] with everything that's been going on
[1:04:50] so to conclude
[1:04:52] short but conclude is this
[1:04:56] what you do
[1:04:58] with what God has blessed you with
[1:05:01] you'll have to answer to him the Lord
[1:05:03] Jesus Christ one day when we step on the
[1:05:05] other side
[1:05:06] everyone
[1:05:08] and I'm talking about the children of
[1:05:10] God with your brothers and sisters
[1:05:12] everyone will stand before the Lord as
[1:05:15] the scripture says every man according
[1:05:17] to his words
[1:05:20] and I don't want to be one to stand
[1:05:23] before Jesus and say do you remember
[1:05:25] your brother here
[1:05:27] you had need you were able to
[1:05:30] give them something even a penny
[1:05:33] whatever
[1:05:34] you know it's like I said about the two
[1:05:36] dollars
[1:05:37] if I got two dollars I can I can live
[1:05:39] today on the dollar what do I do with
[1:05:42] the other dollar
[1:05:43] when I see my brother could use it
[1:05:47] see so this church again this church has
[1:05:50] been a blessing to the people there and
[1:05:52] I've seen it I've been part of it and
[1:05:55] it's one I I'm glad
[1:05:58] because going over there and we're able
[1:06:00] to travel that was so nice to be able to
[1:06:03] travel other churches especially when
[1:06:05] you see brother Vincent and brother
[1:06:09] Sunday
[1:06:14] and they are smiling they greet you and
[1:06:17] you know what's the prize with me
[1:06:19] when we went to Brother Vincent
[1:06:22] he had food for us
[1:06:25] when we went to the orphanage they had I
[1:06:28] didn't expect it I didn't
[1:06:31] it did ask me I said no no no no no no
[1:06:33] no no keep that for yourselves
[1:06:36] but they had enough offering
[1:06:39] it was an offer
[1:06:41] so
[1:06:46] it's not to criticize anybody anywhere
[1:06:49] that I say these things
[1:06:51] it's not the greatest like it's just
[1:06:53] that it's there and I see it
[1:06:57] and the Lord laid it on my heart and I
[1:06:59] have to say it
[1:07:01] I know I remember brother Dale you were
[1:07:04] you said a few things
[1:07:05] yourself

[1:11:39] pray
[1:11:42] let everything
[1:11:44] that I person
[1:11:48] be pleased
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:56] Hallelujah
[1:11:57] Hallelujah if it'd be all right I might
[1:12:00] just add to brother Jim's for a minute
[1:12:01] you can have your seats which is still I
[1:12:05] didn't know how long brother Jim would
[1:12:07] would share or just uh I like to look at
[1:12:11] that scripture that brother Jim just for
[1:12:13] a moment I'm not I'm just I'm just
[1:12:15] adding to what he what his brother Jim
[1:12:17] had said
[1:12:18] and
[1:12:19] and I appreciate what brother Jim said
[1:12:21] about youth here in the church have have
[1:12:24] done mountains we've moved mountains
[1:12:26] amen and in no way is this a a
[1:12:30] condemning message to you can't can the
[1:12:33] word of God can't condemn somebody
[1:12:35] that's already doing what the word of
[1:12:36] God has said amen so it's it you know
[1:12:40] what I mean like brother Brown said if
[1:12:42] the shoe fits where are they man you're
[1:12:43] already wearing this shoe so amen and so
[1:12:46] this is not a personal thing at all but
[1:12:49] if we looked at uh uh one First John 3
[1:12:52] where uh brother Jim read and I would
[1:12:55] have loved to just to read the verse
[1:12:57] before where he read it in verse 16.
[1:13:01] and why we're looking for that to hear
[1:13:04] our Prophet said this he said if you
[1:13:06] want to do something for God
[1:13:08] do something for his people and he said
[1:13:11] if you want something good said about
[1:13:12] you
[1:13:13] say something good about someone else if
[1:13:17] you want to be blessed
[1:13:20] then bless
[1:13:21] somebody else
[1:13:23] amen if you're a blessing Jesus said it
[1:13:26] and then the prophet adds us he said and
[1:13:28] Jesus said in so much that you've done
[1:13:30] it for the least of these you've done it
[1:13:32] unto me and brother Jim read this
[1:13:34] scripture and and when I popped it up of
[1:13:36] course I have my favorite scriptures
[1:13:38] highlighted everywhere I go on my Bible
[1:13:40] they're painted and on my phone they're
[1:13:42] painted and on my iPad they're painted
[1:13:45] and here this is just a scripture I had
[1:13:47] to wear brother brother Jim read he said
[1:13:49] hereby perceive that we weed the love of
[1:13:53] God
[1:13:54] because he laid down his life
[1:13:57] and ought we not to lay down our life
[1:14:00] for the brother and I'm going to read if
[1:14:03] you if you let me read a quote that goes
[1:14:06] just beautifully along with that here
[1:14:09] just let me uh pull it up here
[1:14:12] uh first the second just along that same
[1:14:16] line here's the prophet preaching
[1:14:19] amen and and uh
[1:14:23] I'm just find it here so
[1:14:38] amen and here's here's the profit you
[1:14:41] can leave this scripture up because it
[1:14:43] goes along perfectly and here here's the
[1:14:46] prophet said on that day on Calvary in
[1:14:48] 60 and he says and it gives you after
[1:14:52] the condition his Spirit to follow him
[1:14:55] and do as he did for others
[1:14:59] is following on just he he was just the
[1:15:02] man the perfect man he gave his life and
[1:15:06] he made an example
[1:15:07] for us and here he's talking about God
[1:15:10] leaving the Splendor of Heaven
[1:15:13] and lay down his life on Calvary and and
[1:15:15] he and he closes to the Tabernacle and
[1:15:18] he said Tabernacle don't miss this he
[1:15:21] said if you give something and you
[1:15:23] expect to be noticed if you expect like
[1:15:27] some kind of gratitude
[1:15:29] or you expect well like you you did it
[1:15:32] mentally well I can see they're not well
[1:15:34] off so I'll give them okay and he said
[1:15:37] that's not how Christ did it it was just
[1:15:40] completely unconditional he never it was
[1:15:42] something it was just like he never even
[1:15:44] thought about it he was doing it before
[1:15:46] he realized he was doing it he said
[1:15:48] that's how he laid down his life on
[1:15:50] Calvary for you if it's all right I'll
[1:15:52] just finish reading this uh
[1:15:56] this quote here he said now the first
[1:15:58] thing we want to say is that Jesus never
[1:16:00] lived for himself he
[1:16:02] his life was spent for others and that's
[1:16:05] perfectly eternal life and when you say
[1:16:07] uh you go to church and you do good
[1:16:10] things that's fine but when you live
[1:16:12] your life for yourself you haven't got
[1:16:15] eternal life eternal life is living for
[1:16:17] others and it proves it when you come to
[1:16:21] the Lamb of God he said he lived and had
[1:16:24] eternal life because he had he did not
[1:16:26] live his life for himself he lived it
[1:16:29] for others and you receive eternal life
[1:16:32] by receiving that day and you don't live
[1:16:36] yourself no more this is a beautiful
[1:16:39] quote he's and this is I mean this
[1:16:42] blessed my heart he said you live for
[1:16:44] others some someone said he said how do
[1:16:47] you stand and let someone call you
[1:16:50] bad names
[1:16:52] I'll tell you what this had brother
[1:16:54] Dales the taxes
[1:16:57] it did brother Mike I failed bitterly in
[1:16:59] this he said you're not living for
[1:17:02] yourself
[1:17:03] he said it don't matter that you call me
[1:17:05] bad names because I'm not alive
[1:17:07] you can you can say anything you want
[1:17:09] about brother Dale because it don't
[1:17:11] affect brother Dale because brother
[1:17:12] Dale's nature ain't here
[1:17:15] oh buddy he had my attention
[1:17:19] he said God help me he said you don't
[1:17:22] live for yourself he said your life is
[1:17:24] for others that you might redeem that
[1:17:27] man that's saying the bad words about
[1:17:29] you oh buddy
[1:17:33] and you can't you become sons and the
[1:17:37] trouble of it is is the church has
[1:17:39] forgotten their sons
[1:17:42] he said you're a son and you're talking
[1:17:45] and you're taking Christ's place and
[1:17:48] you're the son that don't live for
[1:17:50] itself so you're living for others
[1:17:53] and they said well brother Branham I can
[1:17:55] live for my brother because he is sure a
[1:17:58] nice man he said that's not it
[1:18:02] he said try living for the man that
[1:18:05] hates you and live for the person that
[1:18:08] he would kill you
[1:18:10] if he could get away with it
[1:18:13] oh buddy he had my attention
[1:18:15] he said that's what they done to him
[1:18:18] Christ
[1:18:20] oh buddy God help me brother Dale
[1:18:23] he said they killed him and he died that
[1:18:27] he might save them the ones that killed
[1:18:30] him and give them eternal life
[1:18:33] if they would accept it
[1:18:35] and he said then you that's in you
[1:18:38] than you that's in you your bosom and
[1:18:43] your face in heaven then
[1:18:45] wow he's now let's just we're just going
[1:18:48] to the next paragraph I hope this helps
[1:18:50] you to get to the place he said what
[1:18:52] that's what the Tabernacle he's talking
[1:18:54] about Brown Tabernacle he said that's
[1:18:56] what all the people needs has got to do
[1:18:58] is to find out what you are and what's
[1:19:02] your purpose the church isn't going to
[1:19:04] church just like by playing music and
[1:19:07] singing songs but the church is a place
[1:19:09] where correction is judgment begins in
[1:19:12] the house of God brother Jim mentioned
[1:19:14] that he said you must reckon with
[1:19:16] yourself you must reckon Yourself Dead
[1:19:20] and see if your dad in Christ and
[1:19:23] somebody comes up and just as murdering
[1:19:25] your character
[1:19:26] but your character's already dead
[1:19:29] see you're packing Christ's character
[1:19:31] and see they're not talking about
[1:19:33] Christ's character they're talking about
[1:19:34] your old character but you don't care
[1:19:35] because you're you've already left your
[1:19:37] old character and you've laid it down
[1:19:39] whoa
[1:19:42] wow this was just like
[1:19:45] amazing he said
[1:19:49] we must reckon ourselves dead and alive
[1:19:51] in Christ and then he made a way that we
[1:19:55] could sacrifice ourself to his service
[1:19:57] and see when your sacrifice to Christ
[1:20:00] and somebody comes up and says you know
[1:20:02] that brother Dale he's got a lot of
[1:20:04] issues
[1:20:05] and you could just say yup he sure does
[1:20:07] but he's dead
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:11] I'll tell you what that's
[1:20:14] when you get to the point that you're
[1:20:16] being shot at
[1:20:18] and you don't mind it you realize that
[1:20:20] you're not there no more
[1:20:23] I tell you what God help me you can say
[1:20:25] all you want to say but when you
[1:20:27] literally get attacked
[1:20:30] and you can just say oh praise God
[1:20:32] hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:20:35] wow
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:45] then he made a way that we could
[1:20:48] sacrifice ourselves to his service to
[1:20:50] follow him and if we follow him we lead
[1:20:53] the life that he lived that's wonderful
[1:20:56] now let's just jump ahead and I skipped
[1:20:58] one paragraph and he said he said and
[1:21:00] the goats and he said to the goats he
[1:21:02] said depart from me because I was hungry
[1:21:04] and he fed me and I was in problem in
[1:21:07] prison and you never visited me and
[1:21:09] closed me and I and let's just jump but
[1:21:11] he said to the Sheep I was hungry and
[1:21:14] you fed me this this is the part I want
[1:21:15] you to get and I was without clothes and
[1:21:18] you closed me and he said watch what he
[1:21:20] says to the Sheep that's what the
[1:21:22] prophet said he said you will notice
[1:21:24] that the Sheep said Lord Lord when did
[1:21:28] we ever feed you
[1:21:30] when did we ever close you he said they
[1:21:33] never realized they were even doing it
[1:21:37] because it was so unconscious
[1:21:41] you know this ain't just about money
[1:21:44] this is you go to the store and you see
[1:21:46] an old Larry carrying two bags of
[1:21:48] groceries and you hold the door for her
[1:21:51] hello
[1:21:53] that's just a life that you just
[1:21:56] she's struggling I don't slip on the ice
[1:21:59] here let me take your
[1:22:01] you didn't have to preconceive and think
[1:22:03] about that that was just
[1:22:06] courtesy
[1:22:07] that was Christ
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:11] and he said
[1:22:14] he said you will notice that notice and
[1:22:17] don't fail to get this church keep this
[1:22:20] in your heart forever
[1:22:22] it was so unconsciously done that the
[1:22:26] people didn't even know that they were
[1:22:28] in the line of duty
[1:22:30] and the man that gives you something or
[1:22:33] another because he ought to do what that
[1:22:35] man feeds you because he ought to
[1:22:38] do it because it's a selfish idea
[1:22:44] oh I'm helping God's kingdom because God
[1:22:46] needs me oh you're making God throw up
[1:22:51] laughs
[1:22:53] Hallelujah
[1:22:55] he said it's a self he said it should be
[1:22:57] your very life your very action and it
[1:23:01] was so surprising to the sheep that they
[1:23:04] said Lord when were you hungry and we
[1:23:07] never ever fed you when were you hungry
[1:23:10] how did we feed you or naked and we
[1:23:12] clothed you and he said and you were
[1:23:14] thirsty and we give you drink he said
[1:23:15] watch this it's the last paragraph and
[1:23:17] I'm just going to read a scripture in
[1:23:18] close he said it was so automatically
[1:23:20] out of love
[1:23:23] that your life lived in them and he said
[1:23:25] God let the people see thy Calvary what
[1:23:30] he did for us
[1:23:33] was automatic
[1:23:36] god Jehovah seen that these people
[1:23:40] don't have no hope
[1:23:42] and it was just automatic
[1:23:45] I can fix it
[1:23:47] Boop
[1:23:50] and we are him
[1:23:52] oh wow let's just read this scripture
[1:23:57] oh my goodness we've already read it
[1:23:59] actually my very next Christian on my
[1:24:01] iPad
[1:24:03] was John 1 3 16 amen
[1:24:06] I'll perceive ye I'll I'll buy ye
[1:24:09] perceive the love of God because he laid
[1:24:11] down his life for the Brethren whosoever
[1:24:13] has the world good
[1:24:15] and seeth his brother in need shut us up
[1:24:18] as vows of compassion onto him
[1:24:20] withholdeth the love of God
[1:24:22] in him my little children let us not
[1:24:24] love in the word neither in tongue amen
[1:24:27] and indeed and in truth that's beautiful
[1:24:29] beautiful scripture God help us amen
[1:24:32] that that that that that
[1:24:34] word from or that was just beautiful and
[1:24:37] bless me
[1:24:39] tremendously
[1:24:43] tremendously
[1:24:45] we've all been attacked at different
[1:24:47] times oh well that person has a problem
[1:24:50] and you found out you found out around
[1:24:53] about the bent and it's hurt you and
[1:24:56] it's and you don't have to lie to me
[1:24:57] because you're human
[1:24:59] and it's hurt me too
[1:25:01] but you know what when how the prophet
[1:25:05] said he said you know what when we get
[1:25:07] to the point that it don't even Hurt No
[1:25:09] More
[1:25:09] because you know what like you that's
[1:25:13] that's like that's like that's
[1:25:15] Supernatural
[1:25:17] I haven't been there before when I've
[1:25:19] had those tests
[1:25:21] I pray to God that when he was in the
[1:25:23] next test
[1:25:24] I'll handle a lot different
[1:25:26] amen God help us you know God help us it
[1:25:29] was just uh
[1:25:31] God help me Amen to portray that amen
[1:25:34] just and and we're not just talking
[1:25:36] about money just you know like there's
[1:25:38] just so many things like just showing up
[1:25:41] I said about brother Jim going or or
[1:25:43] sister Wango and those people just
[1:25:45] knowing that you were willing to be
[1:25:47] there
[1:25:48] amen it was like just knowing that God
[1:25:51] was willing to leave the Splendor of
[1:25:53] heaven and come to Earth that's a pretty
[1:25:56] awesome part
[1:25:57] amen
[1:26:00] and just to think like like he said we
[1:26:02] went to Pastor Vincent's like we're in a
[1:26:04] mud hut
[1:26:05] on a mud floor
[1:26:07] and he had a table spread with the
[1:26:09] tablecloth with all kinds of food and he
[1:26:12] sent food home with me and I'm still
[1:26:15] eating them in my living room
[1:26:21] see see
[1:26:24] automatic they don't even have nothing
[1:26:26] to give but you give it because
[1:26:28] because it wasn't even perceived in
[1:26:30] their thoughts
[1:26:31] amen God help us amen you know I mean I
[1:26:34] mean closed with this you know there I I
[1:26:35] think I mentioned there was a sister
[1:26:36] there
[1:26:38] couple sisters that I told Luanne to go
[1:26:40] investigate one sister had been born
[1:26:42] like that and one sister had a big sore
[1:26:44] on her leg and I believe it was cancer
[1:26:46] they told us afterwards I didn't know
[1:26:48] this at the time I did not know it at
[1:26:50] the time
[1:26:51] and so uh she didn't speak a lick of
[1:26:54] English not a lick of English see what
[1:26:57] most people do but she did not she was
[1:27:00] all their their language brother Jim was
[1:27:02] right there and I and so I went got
[1:27:03] Pastor Leo and I said you know I wanted
[1:27:06] to know if she was from the area because
[1:27:08] we would have went to Michiana and
[1:27:10] Luanne could have bought her some nice
[1:27:11] sabs and stuff and put on it and bandage
[1:27:13] it because it was literally a sort am I
[1:27:15] exaggerating it looked like that big
[1:27:17] about that type
[1:27:19] it was big and her whole leg from there
[1:27:21] below her knee
[1:27:23] and her foot was all swelled up
[1:27:25] believe me
[1:27:27] it
[1:27:28] it looked in cruciating in pain and when
[1:27:32] she went to get prayed for at the altar
[1:27:33] she was I think the dad last person to
[1:27:35] leave
[1:27:36] I believe to us if not she was the
[1:27:38] second last amen anyway so I I got
[1:27:41] Pastor Leo and Leo said no no she's from
[1:27:43] a long ways away she came from three
[1:27:45] hours away so she's not from here so we
[1:27:47] were unable to see her on Monday and we
[1:27:49] through you and the church and brother
[1:27:51] Jim and everybody everybody's a part of
[1:27:53] this because it's not a it's not a
[1:27:55] one-man Ministry at all and so I told
[1:27:58] brother Leo I said we're going to give
[1:27:59] her some money and and and I want to
[1:28:02] show you because brother Jim
[1:28:04] mention stuff like this and you know
[1:28:06] when you send your money yourself
[1:28:09] that's the best
[1:28:10] like brother Jim did things himself
[1:28:13] and he knows exactly what God laid on
[1:28:16] his heart you see what I mean but the
[1:28:18] next best is said it was somebody that
[1:28:20] you fully trust and will give you a
[1:28:22] report that's called being a good
[1:28:24] steward
[1:28:24] so by the pastor Leo said and I trust
[1:28:27] Pastor Leo literally was my bank account
[1:28:29] but Pastor Leo said why don't we give it
[1:28:31] to her pastor I said pastor Leo
[1:28:35] why do we got to give it to her pastor
[1:28:37] it's her that's packing the sore leg
[1:28:40] I don't need to send it through a pastor
[1:28:42] that might skim something off the top
[1:28:44] maybe would maybe wouldn't it
[1:28:46] I mean it's quite obvious that like you
[1:28:49] might give money to a pastor and say
[1:28:51] share this with your people and he
[1:28:52] because you don't know the needs but
[1:28:55] this is very obvious I mean we know the
[1:28:57] needs and he said okay why don't we give
[1:28:59] her and he mentioned the number 50. and
[1:29:02] I said why don't we give her double that
[1:29:05] 100.
[1:29:06] Matt see when you're there yourself
[1:29:10] it's God's holy spirit in you that's
[1:29:13] leading you the footsteps of the
[1:29:15] righteous are just and you you are
[1:29:18] protecting watch this you are protecting
[1:29:21] God's heritage
[1:29:24] personally the god in you is protecting
[1:29:27] the god in them and it all comes
[1:29:29] together it's beautiful let's stand
[1:29:31] let's stand
[1:29:33] amen amen next Sunday we'll we'll get
[1:29:36] this out of our system and move on but
[1:29:38] it's good to have a report and you know
[1:29:41] in the future I was also blessed by
[1:29:43] Brother something else brother Jim said
[1:29:45] because it kind of made me sad to think
[1:29:47] that you know I I know brother Jim had
[1:29:49] said and I know he give a lot
[1:29:52] I know that and that and brother Jim had
[1:29:55] said come back said I'll probably never
[1:29:57] come back you know because of different
[1:29:59] reasons
[1:30:00] but I was glad he'd kind of like lighten
[1:30:02] that a little bit this morning said
[1:30:04] maybe
[1:30:06] amen God this way you know and I know
[1:30:08] some cannot go and if you got small kids
[1:30:11] or families or or in different stages of
[1:30:13] life life is different
[1:30:16] but if you can go
[1:30:18] you will never ever
[1:30:21] be the same it's not possible and what
[1:30:24] brother Jim said you can look at those
[1:30:26] pictures all day long and that's one
