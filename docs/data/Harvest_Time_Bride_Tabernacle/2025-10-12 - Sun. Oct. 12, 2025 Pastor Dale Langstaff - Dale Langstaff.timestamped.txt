[5:51] [Music]
[5:56] Happy to be here again with you all.
[6:00] um
[6:03] last time I gave uh the testimony and um
[6:08] there's quite a lot involved and a lot
[6:11] of detail obviously that I I didn't
[6:14] mention and uh so this morning when I
[6:17] woke up you know the Lord was kind of
[6:20] guiding me to give a
[6:22] &gt;&gt; more of a testimony and give a bit of
[6:24] the details
[6:25] &gt;&gt; behind um what I said last time Right.
[6:28] Great.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; So, um
[6:34] I
[6:35] I started having uh I would say a cyst
[6:41] uh when I was 17 years old. So, that's a
[6:44] very long time ago. Uh but it would come
[6:47] and go. It wasn't a big deal.
[6:49] Um and then in 2018
[6:54] it turned into a tumor, a small tumor
[6:57] for which I had surgery
[7:00] and um it was benign.
[7:04] Uh and so that went well. Nothing
[7:07] happened after that. But then in around
[7:10] 2020, 2021, it came back
[7:14] and it just started growing from the
[7:17] size of a strawberry to a size of a
[7:20] plum.
[7:22] And in 2024,
[7:26] I started taking it a bit more seriously
[7:29] and um I just started speaking to that
[7:33] mountain.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and I would uh declare that
[7:37] I'm healed by the stripes of the Lord. I
[7:40] would speak to the mountain and cast it
[7:42] into the sea and just speak the word
[7:44] over the tumor. Um so I was doing that
[7:48] for at least over a year
[7:52] and then in 2025 around March it just
[7:56] began to grow a lot larger and a lot
[7:59] faster.
[8:01] Um,
[8:02] so by the time I got a doctor's
[8:04] appointment in June of this year, it had
[8:10] almost doubled. I would say it was
[8:12] probably the size of a large apple.
[8:16] And um,
[8:19] it was growing very rapidly.
[8:23] Uh I when I went to the doctor I told
[8:27] her I said I I need this thing out as
[8:29] quickly as possible because it felt like
[8:31] you know it would just explode. Um and
[8:35] of course it takes some time to get
[8:36] appointments to schedule surgery and all
[8:38] of that. So by the time I actually got
[8:41] to to the day of the surgery you know it
[8:45] was it was very large as I showed you
[8:48] last time uh in the in my testimony.
[8:52] So, um, the point that I want to get to
[8:55] is the day when the doctor called me to
[8:58] tell me that you have cancer,
[9:02] I just laughed it off. And
[9:06] it seemed like a mockery. Not a mockery
[9:08] because I didn't not a mockery out of
[9:11] unbelief or denial. Not that kind of
[9:13] mockery, but because I already in my
[9:18] mind and in my heart, it was a done
[9:20] deal. I was healed. the tumor was dead.
[9:24] It was to me it was like it wasn't
[9:27] there. I was not right. So when she told
[9:29] me that in my mind I'm like you're kind
[9:32] of too late to tell me this now. Right.
[9:35] So I I laughed within myself and um
[9:38] obviously you know she asked me do you
[9:41] have anyone to talk to with great
[9:43] concern in her voice and I said yes I do
[9:46] and I'm very fine. Don't worry about me.
[9:48] I'll be okay. So she hung up and I went
[9:51] into the bathroom and I just laughed
[9:53] hysterically in front of the mirror and
[9:56] I can't say this voice came from me but
[9:59] from within me a voice came and said who
[10:03] told you that in in in other words who
[10:06] told you that you have cancer right um
[10:11] so just bear that phrase in mind who
[10:14] told you that
[10:17] then about a week later or two weeks
[10:20] later, I was talking to my brother Ben.
[10:22] And uh remember I told you that I didn't
[10:25] tell anybody about my situation, but I
[10:29] was calling him to just tell him I was
[10:31] dealing with a health situation, a
[10:33] serious one. And uh we were just talking
[10:36] about, you know, how, you know, we need
[10:38] to exercise our faith and and and
[10:42] uh really put put into action what we
[10:45] say we believe and mean business with
[10:47] God. And uh I made a statement to him
[10:52] and I said, "If not me, then who?"
[10:58] So, fast forward,
[11:00] uh, brother Danny Misilli had some
[11:02] weekend youth meetings at the end of
[11:05] August
[11:06] and, um, my appointment with the surgery
[11:09] was on the 28th. It was on the Thursday.
[11:12] The meetings were starting on the
[11:13] Friday.
[11:15] Um, I was a bit concerned that I won't
[11:18] be able to go to the meetings in case
[11:19] they have to do surgery right away.
[11:21] That's how
[11:23] critical it was. Uh anyways, the surgery
[11:28] didn't happen that day and we didn't
[11:30] make it for the Friday
[11:33] uh meeting or the Saturday morning,
[11:36] but we were able to go for Saturday
[11:39] evening.
[11:41] Now, before we left, I I wanted to
[11:44] listen to the sermon on the Saturday
[11:47] morning. So I sat in my living room and
[11:50] I listened to the service
[11:52] and the title
[11:55] of that sermon by brother Miguel
[11:58] was who told you that
[12:03] and I just froze
[12:06] and I was like oh my goodness what's
[12:08] going on you know um so anyways we go
[12:13] for the service on Saturday and then on
[12:15] Sunday morning brother Kry Diggs
[12:18] preaches
[12:20] and the title of his sermon
[12:24] was if not me then who.
[12:29] And um
[12:32] &gt;&gt; uh some of you were there in those
[12:34] services
[12:36] and uh I I was just in just complete
[12:39] unbelief like what's going on. And um so
[12:43] on Monday morning I texted brother Danny
[12:45] and I told him what was going on and and
[12:48] my experiences with the sermons. Even at
[12:51] the at the meetings itself, I actually
[12:54] greeted the ministers and I mentioned to
[12:57] them how God was dealing and obviously
[13:01] they have no clue what is going on. I
[13:03] just appreciated them for for the s the
[13:07] sermons and um I would just like to play
[13:10] a little clip before we do that. Um,
[13:14] on Sunday when brother Diggs was
[13:16] preaching,
[13:18] he was talking about David and Goliath
[13:21] and at some point he asked everybody to
[13:25] hold their hand up high
[13:28] and hold Goliath's head
[13:30] &gt;&gt; as a testimony of their victory.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; And so, everybody held their hand up
[13:36] high.
[13:38] And I held my hand. Keep in mind the
[13:40] tumor. I still had the tumor. It was on
[13:43] my left side. It was My hand was sore.
[13:45] It was It took a lot to put my hand up
[13:48] high and stretch it just like I'm doing
[13:51] right now.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; But I held my hand.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; And I was saying I'm testifying that
[13:57] this Goliath is is dead.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; And I have his head in my hand. And as
[14:04] you see my hand right now, I was wearing
[14:07] this watch. You're going to see it like
[14:09] this.
[14:10] and this black
[14:12] &gt;&gt; top and I was sitting at the back of the
[14:16] church. So, there's no way I would
[14:18] appear on the camera,
[14:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[14:20] &gt;&gt; But I prayed in my heart and I said,
[14:23] "Lord, somehow my hand has got to show
[14:26] on this camera because it's going to be
[14:29] a testimony
[14:31] of me holding Goliath's head up." and I
[14:34] held my hand
[14:37] and sure enough this Wednesday when I
[14:41] went to look at that video my hand is up
[14:44] high like this
[14:47] &gt;&gt; in that video
[14:49] and that's a testimony
[14:52] &gt;&gt; at that moment the tumor was in my body
[14:56] today it's not there anymore
[15:00] &gt;&gt; and I texted Sister Julie on Wednesday.
[15:04] Um I was supposed to go see the surgeon
[15:07] on Thursday
[15:09] uh for a followup appointment
[15:12] and um I told Sister Julie, I said, "I'm
[15:15] bringing back Goliath's head."
[15:18] Uh but on Thursday, just before I went
[15:22] for my appointment, they called me and
[15:23] and cancelled and postponed the
[15:25] appointment. So, I didn't go. But it's
[15:28] been rescheduled for for next Thursday.
[15:32] And I am certain as I stand here,
[15:36] &gt;&gt; I will get Goliath's head and I'll hold
[15:39] it up high again, the real thing and
[15:42] testify
[15:44] &gt;&gt; of what God has done. So, I just wanted
[15:46] to play that clip
[15:48] &gt;&gt; of that service.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; I want everybody to hold their hand up.
[15:58] I want you to hold your Goliath up.
[16:01] Hold your testimony up.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Hold your testimony up.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold your testimony high.
[16:08] Hold your victory high.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; There's my hand.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; With the watch.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Hold your victory high.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who?
[16:17] [Applause]
[16:21] [Music]
[16:21] [Applause]
[16:29] [Music]
[16:31] They go ahead and they champion.
[16:33] Everybody start to run.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said,
[16:39] "Hallelujah." He said, "Oh, you remember
[16:41] the maniac? The maniac that fell before
[16:44] his feet told you something."
[16:49] Okay, that's it. That's just a repeat.
[16:52] Thank you.
[16:55] So that is what the Lord wanted me to
[16:58] share with you this morningless
[17:00] &gt;&gt; and um I just pray that this testimony
[17:05] will will help somebody.
[17:08] Uh I I've already received several calls
[17:11] from different people in many parts of
[17:15] the world asking
[17:17] you know just uh
[17:20] me to share you know how did all this
[17:23] happen and how um
[17:27] and
[17:29] you know there's a lot to say but uh
[17:33] it's really about taking God at his word
[17:36] &gt;&gt; and all I did was speak the word. I
[17:40] would speak to the tumor every day.
[17:43] There are moments when
[17:46] um there's a time I was listening to a
[17:48] sermon
[17:50] preached in 1950
[17:53] and in the prayer line, brother Brham
[17:56] talks to a certain sister
[17:58] and he says
[18:00] actually I'll I'll find it here. He
[18:03] said, "Um,
[18:07] um, sister, you have a tumor
[18:11] and it's been bothering you quite a bit.
[18:15] It might take me some time to find it,
[18:17] but he says, "The tumor has been
[18:19] bothering you quite a bit, but you
[18:22] believe God,
[18:24] &gt;&gt; and that tumor is dead."
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; And it was as though he was speaking
[18:28] directly to me.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; And I took that
[18:33] And I would, as much as the tumor would
[18:36] grow, almost every day, I would speak
[18:39] that word and say, "You are dead and
[18:40] you're cast into the sea."
[18:43] And
[18:46] obviously the devil would try as much as
[18:50] possible to bring down my faith and and
[18:53] cause me to stumble. Uh and the battle
[18:57] got hotter because I started feeling all
[19:01] kinds of sensations in the tumor. I
[19:04] would feel like heat, like pulsating
[19:07] heat.
[19:08] Um there are moments when I could feel
[19:11] pins and needles.
[19:13] Uh and there are times when I could feel
[19:16] like literally the cells are are
[19:19] multiplying. If you've taken biology and
[19:22] you've seen mitosis, how cells multiply,
[19:25] like bubbling and and just expanding, I
[19:27] literally could feel bubbles and it felt
[19:30] like it was just growing. And I would
[19:33] just say, "You are dead. I don't care."
[19:36] You know, and the devil would put voices
[19:38] and say, "See, it's growing. It's
[19:40] multiplying." And I could see it. I was
[19:42] measuring it.
[19:44] But I would not take it. I would say,
[19:47] "No, I'm not accepting that you are dead
[19:51] and you're going to be cast out." And
[19:52] that's all I did from day to day. And
[19:56] today,
[19:58] as I as you see me, I I told you I'm
[20:00] completely healed. And I just want to
[20:02] give God the praise and thank him for
[20:05] all he has done. Thank you and God bless
[20:07] you.
[20:12] Amen.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his name. Thank you,
[20:17] sister, very much. Amen. That's just
[20:20] &gt;&gt; that's just wonderful. Amen. He's He's
[20:22] so good to take care of us. Amen. It's
[20:25] just Amen. Praise his name.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Let's sing uh this is my story. This is
[20:31] my song.
[20:33] Praising my savior all the day long.

[32:34] pass us by.
[32:37] And we know that you won't.
[32:40] And we thank you for that, Lord Jesus.
[32:42] We love you. Thank you for this
[32:44] opportunity to be in this time that's
[32:47] set aside to hear from your throne to
[32:50] worship you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we want
[32:53] to thank you for our sister Ruth's
[32:56] wonderful, amazing
[32:59] testimony, Lord God. Just the power of
[33:01] God is alive and well. Lord, we love and
[33:05] adore you. We thank you, Lord. be with
[33:07] your bride around the world, many out
[33:10] because of the holiday. Lord God, bless
[33:13] them and meet their need, Lord. And even
[33:18] as we're at this time, may our testimony
[33:23] be bright as we maybe talk to family
[33:26] members.
[33:28] live our life
[33:30] before
[33:31] who we rub shoulders with that they
[33:34] would see Christ.
[33:36] See the nature of Christ and him only.
[33:40] We give you the glory and honor. Be with
[33:42] the ministering of the word. Whatever
[33:44] you have planned, Lord God, we pray will
[33:47] be in your plan. Your name we pray.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. It's just a great
[33:58] Maybe you can have your seats for just a
[34:00] moment. Thank you, musicians. Great
[34:03] privilege to be here and we love you and
[34:06] and adore you. You know, I just uh just
[34:10] a couple announcements.
[34:32] Last Sunday
[34:38] was very special to me.
[34:46] Amen.
[34:49] It's just beautiful to see the
[34:51] fellowship and the sisters brought just
[34:55] an unbelievable amount of food and even
[34:58] the ones that couldn't stay, we got to
[34:59] greet them and before they different
[35:02] ones had to leave. But it was just I
[35:04] just went home bubbling just so
[35:07] beautiful. So very beautiful. see
[35:09] brother Mont Matt's mom Maria and sister
[35:12] Maria just it was just a beautiful time
[35:16] and and you sisters Amen you sisters
[35:20] really outdid yourself with the food man
[35:24] Amen
[35:29] God God loves fellowship you know I have
[35:31] a scripture way down in my thing I was
[35:33] looking I think it's in the Old
[35:34] Testament but you know the bi the Bible
[35:36] says to if you want friends you have to
[35:38] Show yourself friendly.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want friends like greet people
[35:43] and fellowship. That's all that you'll
[35:45] have when you pass this life. You're
[35:47] taking your character with you,
[35:49] &gt;&gt; your friendship with you. You know, when
[35:51] people die, they never say, "I wish I'd
[35:53] worked harder."
[35:54] &gt;&gt; They said, "I wish I would have spent
[35:55] more family time and friend time
[35:58] &gt;&gt; or more time with God."
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not taking your bank
[36:02] account with you. No matter what you
[36:04] leave behind, it'll be your God and your
[36:08] family and your friends, your church.
[36:10] And
[36:11] &gt;&gt; and it was it was just a beautiful day
[36:14] last Sunday. And I I believe as long as
[36:16] God carries, I believe we'll have many
[36:18] more of those. Amen. It's just a
[36:20] beautiful thing to see people uh enjoy
[36:24] one another and fellowship. It was it
[36:26] was lovely.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; We uh we had a great time. We went to me
[36:30] and Lynn went to John Denquas uh Friday
[36:33] night and and Saturday morning and it
[36:36] was amazing. And if if you were unable
[36:39] to go, I' I'd encourage you to listen to
[36:41] the services. But I would publicly like
[36:43] to encourage you to listen to two
[36:45] services. And that is the Saturday
[36:47] morning service of Mark uh Becker from
[36:50] Germany. And it really explains who we
[36:53] are and what we believe and why.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. It's I mean it's
[37:01] perfect.
[37:03] And brother uh
[37:06] oh thank god takes I got him in my Keith
[37:08] Reed from Jamaica preached Friday night
[37:11] late.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Wow. It was just it was I the the the
[37:16] church went wild. I mean they completely
[37:19] were out of control. Completely wild. It
[37:22] was just so beautiful. You know, he used
[37:24] one example of the the woman that was uh
[37:27] I believe it was the woman that was
[37:29] caught in the act of adultery and they
[37:31] brought her up and he you know we as
[37:34] believers I preached on this upside down
[37:37] but he said all the believers that
[37:39] brought her were looking at her wrongs
[37:42] &gt;&gt; but Jesus was looking at election.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; He was looking at election. He didn't
[37:48] care what she had done. that they wanted
[37:50] to crucify her, stone her because of her
[37:53] life, but he was looking at election.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I'm going to share
[37:58] something with me if we get this far
[38:00] this morning. And and this is a this is
[38:03] a crazy thing to say,
[38:08] but Christ said it.
[38:11] The more you sin,
[38:14] the more you can love.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; The more you have sinned,
[38:20] the more you can love.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Because to whom much is forgiven
[38:26] &gt;&gt; can they much love.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And the reason that we don't have as
[38:30] much love in the message is because we
[38:32] feel like we haven't been forgiven of
[38:34] anything.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; That's Bible and that's Christ Jesus
[38:38] said that.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; He said it to the woman that came and
[38:41] washed Jesus' feet. And I'm just way way
[38:43] out on my thing. But the woman that came
[38:45] and washed Jesus feet with her tears and
[38:48] her long hair and the religious people
[38:51] came and criticized Jesus and said, "Why
[38:53] would you allow that knowing that her
[38:55] life is a disaster in sin?"
[39:00] &gt;&gt; And he told a story about a man that had
[39:02] been forgiven a large debt
[39:05] &gt;&gt; and a mind that had been getting
[39:07] forgiven just a very few pennies. And he
[39:10] said, "Which one you think would love
[39:12] the person that forgave the most?"
[39:15] &gt;&gt; And Christ Jesus said, "You judged
[39:18] right. The one that much has been
[39:21] forgiven can love me more."
[39:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; God is love.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; God don't have no problem with your
[39:32] mistakes.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; None at all. He don't matter how big
[39:36] they are.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about them all. He wants
[39:38] your love.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; He wants your love. Amen. Just one more
[39:44] thing before we read our scriptures. You
[39:45] know,
[39:47] I seen a post on the internet and it was
[39:50] really beautiful. And Sister Ruth, it's
[39:52] literally what you're living and have
[39:55] lived and it's perfect. You know, faith
[39:59] and fear both require you to believe
[40:03] something you can't see.
[40:07] The one you choose will predict your
[40:09] future.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Faith. You say, "Well, I can't see." You
[40:15] got to believe something that you can't
[40:16] see. Fear.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; I think something bad's going to happen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; You can't see that either.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; The one you choose to believe
[40:28] &gt;&gt; writes your future.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Faith and fear both ask you to believe
[40:32] something that you cannot see.
[40:37] That's a great
[40:38] &gt;&gt; That's powerful. I choose faith. Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and I'm going to
[40:44] continue our topic if you can't uh
[40:47] already tell. This love thing has
[40:50] consumed me and ever since the uh Good
[40:54] Samaritan message. And and if you're
[40:56] bored uh if you hang around, we'll get
[40:59] on to something else when God gets done
[41:01] with this. But
[41:03] 1 John 4:7
[41:06] 1 John 4 and 7. Beloved, let us love one
[41:10] another.
[41:12] For love is of God.
[41:16] And everyone that loveth
[41:19] I'd like to be born of God. Is born of
[41:22] God and knoweth God. And verse eight,
[41:26] and he that loveth not knoweth not God.
[41:32] for God
[41:37] &gt;&gt; is love.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we pray that you will be
[41:42] with the hearer and may they be able to
[41:45] hear what you're showing and portrayed
[41:48] and already
[41:50] brought Lord Jesus before the foundation
[41:53] of the world. And Lord, be with this
[41:55] speaker that I can just speak your
[41:56] words. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. You
[42:01] may have your seats.
[42:03] Amen.
[42:04] For God is love. You know, we know that
[42:08] the scripture says there's no fear in
[42:11] love for love castes out all fear. And
[42:15] here we have just a a first little just
[42:17] a little quote. See, love is what God is
[42:21] &gt;&gt; in the hidden life of Christ. Said,
[42:23] "Love moved God. It was love that
[42:26] brought Christ from heaven. It was love
[42:29] that held them on the cross. It wasn't
[42:31] those Roman soldiers. The Bible says
[42:33] that he could have called 10,000 angels
[42:36] to destroy the Romans and set them free.
[42:39] It was love. Amazing love. For God so
[42:42] loved the world. It was love conquers
[42:46] everything. Preached many messages. He
[42:49] said, "When love was projected,
[42:51] sovereign grace took over." Amen.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; You know, and we're we're to be we're to
[42:58] be him.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; We are him. Because if we got if we have
[43:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we're not
[43:03] our own self speaking. We are Christ
[43:06] that dwelleth in us. Deity don't belong
[43:08] in heaven alone. It dwells in bodies of
[43:11] clay. Christ is here today in one
[43:14] another with the baptism of the Holy
[43:16] Ghost. And so that means we have the
[43:19] nature of Christ.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his nature
[43:25] is love.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to just finish this uh
[43:30] scripture here that we started. You
[43:33] know, God is love. And verse 7 says,
[43:35] "And this manifests the love of God
[43:37] towards us because God sent his only
[43:40] begotten son into the world that through
[43:42] him
[43:44] that we might live through him. Wherein
[43:47] is love not that we loveth God, but he
[43:50] loved us." See, God loved us when I was
[43:53] ugly. When I was a terrible sinner, when
[43:56] I was a woman at the well, God loved us.
[43:58] And we need to portray the same nature
[44:00] as Christ, the one that's still at the
[44:02] well.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; And sent his son to be the
[44:15] the payment for our sins. And beloved,
[44:18] if God so loved us, we ought to also
[44:20] love one another. For no man has seen
[44:23] God at any time. And if we love one
[44:26] another, God dwells
[44:28] in us. And his love is perfect,
[44:31] perfected in us.
[44:34] And we that knoweth and believe the love
[44:37] of God hath to us. Here he repeats
[44:40] himself again the second time. God
[44:44] is love.
[44:46] Yeah.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; If we get this perfect perfect love,
[44:50] this agape love that God is. Let God be
[44:53] the judge and we do the loving.
[44:56] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[45:01] dwelleth in God. Now that means we don't
[45:04] need to step out of that.
[45:07] That means brother Dale don't have an
[45:09] opinion on any situation
[45:11] &gt;&gt; or any life because when sovereign when
[45:15] love was projected grace
[45:19] went forth.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture can say that
[45:24] love covers a multitude of sin. It's
[45:27] actually the grace of your life.
[45:32] But we are plagued with eyes and we see
[45:35] the sin.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; But God sees the love.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[45:51] And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[45:55] God. Now you want to dwell in God.
[46:00] You got to dwell in love.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And God in him. Wherein is our love made
[46:10] perfect that we may have boldness on the
[46:12] day of judgment. Because as he is, so
[46:16] are we in this world, that there's no
[46:19] fear in love, but perfect love casteth
[46:22] out fear. Because fear has torment and
[46:25] he that fearth has not perfect
[46:30] love.
[46:32] There's nothing you have to worry about.
[46:34] Absolutely
[46:36] nothing. You parents that you're worried
[46:38] about your children, forget about it.
[46:41] Love them.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Just forget about the fear. Love them.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Love them in their mistakes.
[46:53] You're not the God that's going to
[46:54] forgive them. That's God's business.
[46:57] Don't try to take God's place and say,
[46:59] "I need to correct them." Love them.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; God will correct them.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; God will do it however he wants to, but
[47:06] he'll do it through love.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Grace is love.
[47:13] 19.
[47:15] We love him because he first loved us.
[47:18] And if a man say, "I love God," and
[47:20] hateth his brother, he is a liar.
[47:24] For he that loveth not his brother whom
[47:26] he has seen. Now, every brother has
[47:29] mistakes.
[47:32] Every sister has Well, if you don't have
[47:35] mistakes, you at least have different
[47:38] ways of doing what I would do.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And that's a mistake.
[47:44] Well, that
[47:45] &gt;&gt; you see,
[47:46] &gt;&gt; if you're going to cook the potatoes or
[47:48] fry the eggs or do something, you know,
[47:53] &gt;&gt; but if we don't love our brother
[47:57] whom we have seen with all his mistakes,
[48:00] this this scripture is very profound.
[48:03] Yeah.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; If you have trouble loving somebody
[48:06] that's making huge mistakes,
[48:10] how can you love God whom you've not
[48:13] even seen?
[48:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "But God's perfect, but you
[48:16] haven't seen him."
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And this is the commandment that he give
[48:21] to
[48:23] commandment we have from him, from God,
[48:26] that he who loveth
[48:29] loveth his brother's mistakes also.
[48:32] Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; I put the mistakes in there.
[48:36] Loveth his brother also.
[48:39] Wow. Here, you know, I just lay a
[48:42] foundation. You know, the message of
[48:44] this is in the the seventh verse talks
[48:46] about here. Brother Bram says, remember
[48:48] God loved you when you were a sinner and
[48:51] the spirit of God that's in you
[48:54] will love the other person. When he's
[48:57] been wrong, he said you'll pray and love
[48:59] for him. everything above everything
[49:02] love God and love one another.
[49:06] Amen. here you know and the next one I'm
[49:08] not going to read exactly but John after
[49:10] he was on the island of Patmas he could
[49:12] understand Christ better and when he
[49:15] comes back and you read the scripture
[49:16] the first scriptures that John reads he
[49:18] says little children love one another
[49:22] and then he come back and the disciples
[49:23] they wanted to destroy that city for uh
[49:26] because they wouldn't give them water
[49:28] and food or whatever and and John
[49:30] because he had been in the island of
[49:31] Patmas and he had been completely locked
[49:33] away in the atmosphere of Christ he said
[49:35] why he said you don't even understand
[49:37] the nature that's coming out of you.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're not to destroy life.
[49:44] We're to love."
[49:46] &gt;&gt; You don't understand spirit that's
[49:47] coming out of you.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to love one another.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; No matter what the outward demonstration
[49:56] you give, as long as the inward here is
[50:00] the Holy Spirit, it's the fruits.
[50:04] longsuffering. You'll be patient.
[50:06] Goodness, meekness, gentleness, tempers.
[50:09] That's with your brother that's making a
[50:12] mistake. That's with your kids that make
[50:14] a mistake.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I want you to catch this
[50:19] part that's underlined. Satan can copy
[50:22] any gift.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And any manifestation,
[50:28] &gt;&gt; but he can't love. Yeah.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; That's why if you're serving the devil
[50:33] this morning, the devil is a vampire. He
[50:36] eats his own.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; So, if you're testifying that you're a
[50:43] believer and you're struggling with
[50:45] loving one person, the worst person in
[50:48] the world,
[50:53] you're showing who you are.
[50:55] Paul said it was impossible hand him to
[50:57] do these things without having the
[50:59] giver. He said, "Thou speakest in
[51:01] tongues of men and angels, but have not
[51:04] charity, it profitest me nothing." He
[51:06] said, "Now love one another above
[51:08] everything that you do. Love one another
[51:11] as you love one another as you love the
[51:14] ugly. You'll love God
[51:17] &gt;&gt; because that's what God did.
[51:20] You love each other and you'll love God.
[51:23] For God is love and perfect love castes
[51:28] out fear. What's fear? Unbelief.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mightiest force in the world
[51:40] is love.
[51:44] The greatest force more than atomic
[51:46] bombs. Yep. Love.
[51:51] There's nothing that will break down
[51:54] love. No matter what it is,
[51:58] whatever you are or whatever you might
[52:00] sing or however you might dance in the
[52:02] spirit or speak in tongues, you might
[52:04] have shook the elders's hand. You might
[52:06] have been baptized three times
[52:07] backwards, frontwards, whatever. But
[52:10] until anchor love anchors in your soul,
[52:14] you are still outside of God.
[52:17] Love is the strongest force on earth.
[52:21] God is omnipotent and God is love.
[52:25] [Music]
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you some things. We're
[52:31] going to come into where Paul said, you
[52:33] know,
[52:35] Paul,
[52:39] when Paul came,
[52:42] Paul had his faith wrong.
[52:47] And here we see it in this debate where
[52:51] brother Bram, maybe it's the next one,
[52:53] we'll come to it. But here in the 13th
[52:55] chapter, Paul said, "I'll speak though
[52:57] tongue of men and angels of both kinds
[53:00] and have not love, I'm nothing. Though I
[53:02] have the wisdom,
[53:06] talk about these gifts in the body.
[53:09] Without the giver, love, the giver is
[53:12] love.
[53:14] Wis wisdom understand all the knowledge
[53:16] in the scriptures and can put them
[53:19] together like any great theologian.
[53:22] and to have not love which is the Holy
[53:25] Spirit. Now watch what the proverb says.
[53:28] Love is your baptism.
[53:31] I am nothing.
[53:34] Now we know that the Holy Spirit is God
[53:37] and we have to admit that and that's
[53:40] God. Well then God is love and so we
[53:43] have any gifts of God without having God
[53:47] because God is love. Satan can
[53:49] impersonate them all. Yeah,
[53:52] &gt;&gt; we see these. I want to read this next
[53:54] scripture here and then we're going to
[53:56] go into some things that Paul said. You
[53:58] know, Paul I want to just find this
[54:00] here.
[54:04] Oh, there we go.
[54:07] Let let me let me just hit on this and I
[54:09] I'll come back to it. You know, Paul
[54:11] when he was first serving God, watch how
[54:13] this goes.
[54:15] He was serving God out of intellect
[54:19] &gt;&gt; and he had intelligent faith. And I fear
[54:21] with my whole being that many times that
[54:25] message believers serve God out of the
[54:28] memory of the message.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Intellectual memory.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; We love a minister that can memorize and
[54:37] quote exactly in the right time
[54:40] the intellectual of the message.
[54:44] And here the prophet said, he said,
[54:45] "That's how Paul came
[54:48] when he was killing the Jews."
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Because Paul came with intellectual
[54:53] faith. But maybe you can pull that up,
[54:55] Vicki. It's it's down a few there.
[54:57] Sorry, I'm mixing you up. But uh it's a
[55:01] 55 quote Ernest contending for the
[55:03] faith. Paul was down. He was in the ner
[55:05] realm of his PhD. See, and he he didn't
[55:09] know, but he had intellectual faith.
[55:12] faith.
[55:14] See, he was killing people because that
[55:17] was the change of dispensation from law
[55:20] to grace.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And so Paul was serving Christ killing
[55:26] Christians.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Remember when Paul get stopped on the
[55:29] road to Damascus, he said, "Why p?" He
[55:32] said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said,
[55:33] "I am Jesus who thou persecuted." But
[55:36] Jesus wasn't on the earth.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; So who was Jesus? It was Jesus was the
[55:42] Christians that he was killing and Paul
[55:44] thought he was serving God.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; That's church order and doctrine.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; You can throw anybody out of the church
[55:54] order because you think they they
[55:57] they're not qualified or they
[55:59] misinterrupt the sanctuary or something.
[56:02] That is intellectual faith.
[56:05] That's the intellectual doctrine of the
[56:07] message. But watch what the prophet says
[56:10] here. Now there's quite a difference in
[56:12] me having intellectual faith and divine
[56:15] faith.
[56:17] Quite a difference.
[56:19] Oh no, you got the
[56:23] one right above that. Uh the one right
[56:25] below it. Sorry.
[56:31] There's quite a difference in
[56:33] intellectual faith and divine faith.
[56:36] There's where you There's where you
[56:40] he he he he named somebody here, but I
[56:42] I'm going to he names a church, but this
[56:45] was many years ago. And so I'm going to
[56:47] change that name to There's where you
[56:49] message believers are.
[56:51] You failed to go on. You've got the
[56:53] intellectual faith, but you must have
[56:56] divine revelation
[56:58] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ to you that takes the
[57:01] sin out of your heart and to
[57:03] intellectual faith is not enough.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; That's all right. But it only brings you
[57:10] to the Holy Spirit.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; This message only bring you to the Holy
[57:16] Spirit.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit has to be a personal
[57:20] experience. Yes, sir.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; of the birth,
[57:24] &gt;&gt; the new birth, the regeneration, making
[57:27] the new creature in Christ. See, Paul
[57:31] was serving God. We'll we'll catch it
[57:34] next time, Vicki. Sorry, I I I messed
[57:36] you up. Sorry.
[57:38] Paul was serving God by killing Christ,
[57:42] by killing Jesus. And he thought he was
[57:44] doing God a favor because they were
[57:47] changing from the law to grace.
[57:51] And he was serving him with this
[57:52] intellectual
[57:54] faith. And he said, "That'll only bring
[57:57] you to the Holy Spirit."
[58:04] See that right in the middle? That's all
[58:06] right.
[58:08] But that'll only bring you to the Holy
[58:09] Spirit. But the Holy Spirit is a
[58:11] personal experience, a new birth, a
[58:14] regeneration, making you a new creature
[58:16] in Christ.
[58:18] It's a divine revelation.
[58:22] That's that's the token.
[58:25] And that divine revelation, it don't
[58:27] just bring you to the Holy Spirit. It is
[58:30] the Holy Spirit,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; which is love.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Vicki.
[58:43] Man, let's just read our 1 Corinthians
[58:45] 13 and and we'll we'll go into this. I
[58:47] want to touch on a scripture that I read
[58:49] a couple Sundays ago. Uh brother Junior
[58:52] preached last Sunday was amazing here. 1
[58:55] Corinthians uh 13:1. Though I speak with
[58:59] tongues of men and angels and have not
[59:01] charity, I become as a sounding brass
[59:03] and a tinkling symbol. And though I have
[59:06] the gift of prophecy and understand all
[59:07] the mysteries and the knowledge, and
[59:09] though I have the faith and so that I
[59:11] can remove mountains and have not
[59:13] charity, I am nothing. And though I
[59:16] bestow my goods to the poor to feed the
[59:18] poor, and though I give my body to be
[59:20] burned and have not charity, it profits
[59:23] me nothing.
[59:26] Remember, Brother Brown said, your
[59:28] prophet said, "The world's dying for
[59:30] love.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Charity suffereth long."
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] Love suffereth long. It is kind. Love
[59:38] envieth not. Love vanth vaithth not
[59:42] itself and is not puffed up. Let's just
[59:45] drop to verse six. Rejoice not in
[59:48] iniquity but rejoice in the truth.
[59:49] Bearing all things, believing all
[59:51] things, hoping all things, enduring all
[59:53] things, charity, love
[59:56] never fails. But where there is
[59:58] prophecies, they shall fail. Whether
[1:00:00] there's tongues, they shall cease. And
[1:00:01] whether there is knowledge, it shall
[1:00:03] vanish away. For we know in part and we
[1:00:05] prophesy in part.
[1:00:09] But when that which is perfect, you know
[1:00:12] what the perfect is? Love.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; You know what the love is? Christ.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Nature. When that which is perfect is
[1:00:19] come, then that which is done away. That
[1:00:22] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:00:24] with. When I was a child, I spake and I
[1:00:27] understood as a child. I thought as a
[1:00:29] child, but when I became a man, I put
[1:00:31] away childish things. Now we see through
[1:00:33] a glass darkly, but then face to face.
[1:00:36] Now I see in part,
[1:00:39] but then I shall know even as I am
[1:00:42] known, and now abideth faith, hope, and
[1:00:46] love.
[1:00:48] But these three, the greatest of these
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; is love.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; You know, our prophet, I want to touch
[1:00:58] on this last last Sunday. Maybe you can
[1:01:00] pull up this verse, Vicki. 1 Peter
[1:01:02] 4:7-10
[1:01:03] and it and and here it says for the end
[1:01:06] of all things is be therefore sober and
[1:01:08] watch unto prayer for above all fervent
[1:01:11] love among yourself for love covers a
[1:01:15] multitude of sins and I might I'm not re
[1:01:18] but I I didn't finish that and and God
[1:01:20] checked me on that and I want to read
[1:01:22] you some quotes that come out of that
[1:01:24] scripture but I want to show you that
[1:01:28] brother Bram was shown what is the
[1:01:30] evidence of the token And what is the
[1:01:31] evidence of the Holy Spirit? And the
[1:01:34] first thing he had said was love.
[1:01:37] And then he added that to it and he said
[1:01:39] it was believing the word for your day.
[1:01:42] But then he also said that the evidence
[1:01:45] of the token is to have the very nature
[1:01:49] of your daddy.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when you watch the video
[1:01:53] Saturday night he you know brother
[1:01:55] Markson from Germany he was sharing he
[1:01:58] said this this truth that we follow is
[1:02:01] not a denomination.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; It I'm not making it one. It's not even
[1:02:04] a religion.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do really with church.
[1:02:09] It has to do with a family. And we're
[1:02:11] the only believers in the world that
[1:02:13] worship under a father.
[1:02:17] I have a father. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; And he knows my name.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; See, you'd have the nature
[1:02:29] of your daddy.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And so, if you don't have the nature of
[1:02:32] your daddy,
[1:02:34] then you're believing a lie. And so, I
[1:02:37] want to I want to show this, you know,
[1:02:38] when we go into this and and I I got
[1:02:40] some Well, let me let me read some. But,
[1:02:43] you know, we can tell by our lives where
[1:02:45] we're at. And so in the Old Testament,
[1:02:49] the token was from the blood of bulls
[1:02:53] and goats and lambs and doves.
[1:02:56] But watch this. And I this is my whole
[1:02:58] message right here. But that only
[1:03:01] covered Brother Dale's sins.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Those sins were still there. And the
[1:03:06] desire was greater than ever.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Never changed that a bit.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; But the reason that that was that was a
[1:03:14] type of the perfect to come. But it was
[1:03:16] also the reason you say, "Well, why did
[1:03:18] it take blood of goats and lambs and
[1:03:20] doves is because they don't have a
[1:03:22] soul."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And so if I took the life of an animal,
[1:03:26] it don't have a soul. So it couldn't be
[1:03:28] charged to my life.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And that's where most of us have been
[1:03:36] living.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Because under that token,
[1:03:42] you still get angry.
[1:03:45] You still fuss.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; You still argue. See the s it's just
[1:03:50] covered. That's it. Under the lambs and
[1:03:53] goats. You still fight with your kids.
[1:03:55] You still fight with everybody at
[1:03:57] church. See what that's ain't gone away.
[1:04:00] It's still there. It's like when the
[1:04:01] company comes over, Mrs. Mark, when you
[1:04:03] come over, I'll grab the broom and I'll
[1:04:04] sweep it under the carpet and I'll step
[1:04:06] on it. You know, I tell you a family
[1:04:08] secret. I had good parents. The best in
[1:04:12] the world. I'm sorry. you're second. But
[1:04:14] but when company drove in, we normally
[1:04:17] had a dog that would let us know the
[1:04:18] company come in. If my mom had anything
[1:04:20] that she didn't want you to see, she
[1:04:22] threw it in the oven or in the
[1:04:23] microwave.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's what the blood of bulls and goats
[1:04:29] does.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; It throws your dirty life in the
[1:04:33] microwave. It throws it in the oven
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; so the people at church can't see it.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; But when I come and live with you,
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:45] I get to open the microwave.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; When you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:50] Ghost, the perfect sacrifice, God has to
[1:04:53] open all the oven doors
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; and he sees
[1:04:58] that anger problem.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; That's why when I first came in and I
[1:05:05] was in betroa, I could holler at my
[1:05:07] kids. I could go back and apologize to
[1:05:09] them.
[1:05:11] But my sin was discovered, but it wasn't
[1:05:14] gone.
[1:05:17] That's why
[1:05:23] when me and Jared would sort cattle
[1:05:27] and the 12-year-old kid would let a cow
[1:05:28] go by him, I would be angry.
[1:05:33] I throw a fit.
[1:05:39] I know your story is different, but it's
[1:05:42] similar.
[1:05:44] It's because you've came to the Holy
[1:05:46] Spirit, but you haven't come into it.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; You've come to it and it's just covered.
[1:05:59] But as soon as you get under stress,
[1:06:04] what do you think we're going to get
[1:06:05] before we get a rapture? Pressure.
[1:06:08] Anything God made valuable, you put
[1:06:09] under pressure. Diamonds, gold, oil, put
[1:06:13] under pressure. As soon as you get under
[1:06:14] pressure, you snap.
[1:06:17] You know why you snap? Because it ain't
[1:06:20] gone.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; It ain't gone.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; It's just covered.
[1:06:28] So, see, let me go back to my mommy. So,
[1:06:30] as soon as that company left, she would
[1:06:32] open the oven and the microwave and
[1:06:34] she'd put the dishes in the zinc and
[1:06:35] she'd wash them really quick before
[1:06:37] somebody else come.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; It wasn't gone.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Think about that. You just look at your
[1:06:46] own life.
[1:06:49] Every one of us got one of those.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Have you come to the Holy Spirit
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; or is it gone?
[1:06:58] As soon as you want to correct anybody
[1:07:00] else,
[1:07:02] watch this. As soon as you think
[1:07:05] somebody else is off and you're not,
[1:07:08] you've come to it, but it's not gone.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; You've covered it,
[1:07:15] but then Satan exposes you again.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That was the old covenant.
[1:07:26] And it was good for a season. But God
[1:07:28] had a far better plan
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; and that was love.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; You look at David's life, a man after
[1:07:41] God's own heart. I don't have one pinch
[1:07:44] of David in my message today and on my
[1:07:47] iPad, but you think of the things that
[1:07:49] David happened in his life. You know,
[1:07:51] when when his kids raised up against
[1:07:53] him, David didn't want them killed. made
[1:07:55] a promise that they wouldn't kill him.
[1:07:56] When they killed him, they he killed
[1:07:57] those people. The very people that were
[1:08:00] coming after when they spit in David's
[1:08:01] face, he said, "Don't touch them."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; When anybody attacked David,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; he said, "Oh, it's all right. That's
[1:08:11] what God wanted."
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; But just try attacking me.
[1:08:16] Yeah.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Or you
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And what'll happen is it'll show you
[1:08:24] what covenant you're under.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You could still be living in the Old
[1:08:28] Testament.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Let's look at what the prophet and the
[1:08:40] word of God says here. He says here in
[1:08:43] Jehovah Gyra, he says, "Now the token is
[1:08:46] not the blood.
[1:08:49] It's the life that's in the blood."
[1:08:51] What's the life? The nature.
[1:08:54] It's the life that's in the blood.
[1:08:55] That's the Holy Spirit.
[1:08:59] It's not the blood.
[1:09:03] So, it's the life in the blood, the love
[1:09:05] of God
[1:09:07] that'll stop you. It'll take care of
[1:09:09] your anger. It'll take care of your
[1:09:11] disappointments. It'll take care of your
[1:09:13] judgments.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; The next token, the blood should be a
[1:09:23] token unto you. He said, "Now it's a
[1:09:25] spirit."
[1:09:27] The spirit now is a token.
[1:09:31] See, the token in the Old Testament of
[1:09:34] the animals, it was the blood that was a
[1:09:36] token, but it did not take it away.
[1:09:41] It only covered it until a very on
[1:09:43] peculiar time that you would snap.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that just shows that
[1:09:51] you came to the Holy Spirit, but you
[1:09:54] ain't got it. See, the Bible says, this
[1:09:56] is very Bible, you know, it's actually
[1:09:58] very hard to understand, but the Bible
[1:10:00] says that the letter kills, but the
[1:10:03] spirit gives life. That's the same with
[1:10:04] the message. See, I can kill you with
[1:10:05] the message
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; or I can love you with the message.
[1:10:08] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; God's word can kill you or it can love
[1:10:18] you. So, we're looking at spirit of God.
[1:10:22] Look at the nature of God.
[1:10:26] The nature. See, the Bible says, you
[1:10:28] know, watch this. When when they came to
[1:10:31] Jesus and they rebuked, they they called
[1:10:33] him Belge. He said, "I'll forgive you
[1:10:34] because that's just from the body." But
[1:10:36] when you say that against the Holy
[1:10:37] Spirit, you'll never be forgiven. Now
[1:10:40] watch Now watch who has that Holy
[1:10:42] Spirit. Watch this. This is This is
[1:10:45] good. Let's Jared, I'm going to use you
[1:10:47] and and Iliot for Watch who has the Holy
[1:10:49] Spirit. The Bible says that if you do
[1:10:53] something wrong to the little ones that
[1:10:56] their angel
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; that I's angel reports it to God
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; and he's got a sledgehammer.
[1:11:05] I mean, he's got more than a
[1:11:06] sledgehammer.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; So, when you lose your mind
[1:11:16] on somebody that you don't think matters
[1:11:18] because you have superiority,
[1:11:21] his angel runs up and stands before the
[1:11:23] throne. And he gets priority because the
[1:11:25] little ones get to go first in heaven.
[1:11:26] Remember that that the orphans and the
[1:11:28] widows get priority. He gets a priority
[1:11:30] and his angel reports to God and says
[1:11:32] somebody's beating up in one of the
[1:11:34] little ones.
[1:11:37] God says, "I'll fix that parent.
[1:11:42] I'll fix them.
[1:11:45] I'll fix that brother in the church.
[1:11:48] I'll squash them.
[1:11:50] God will do it. Vengeance is mine."
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Sayeth the Lord.
[1:11:57] So you don't ever have to have vengeance
[1:11:58] on somebody.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; God will take care of them.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Your little ones, you watch.
[1:12:09] We have things so wrong. You know, the
[1:12:11] faith of a child, you know, when we ever
[1:12:13] if we ever have another prayer line, you
[1:12:14] know, again, we're going to bring up the
[1:12:16] little ones. We're going to bring up
[1:12:17] Isaiah and Curtis and and you know uh
[1:12:21] the tiny ones to lay hands
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; cuz they have the faith of a child.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; They don't have no doubt.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; They don't know that it can happen.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; They just know it's going to happen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; So many times we've been brought to the
[1:12:43] what what did the prophet say about the
[1:12:45] evangelist where he said all the you
[1:12:46] know brother Mark mentioned this about
[1:12:48] oh you he said I come to Billy Graham he
[1:12:51] said I come to a city and 30 50,000
[1:12:53] people get saved I come back a year
[1:12:54] later and there's only five there and he
[1:12:55] said it's because of you lazy pastors
[1:12:57] and brother Brandham corrected him. He
[1:12:58] said it's not because of lazy pastors.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; It's cuz you didn't take them far
[1:13:04] enough. Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You brought him to the Holy Spirit
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and it was covered today, but then it
[1:13:12] was exposed tomorrow.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Another one, the token. He said the life
[1:13:27] is in the blood becomes the token.
[1:13:31] Another one, the token has got there. He
[1:13:34] said, "The blood shall be a token onto
[1:13:35] you." He said, "Now the Holy Spirit is
[1:13:37] the life in the blood." That's your
[1:13:40] token.
[1:13:43] Amen. I'm going somewhere with this
[1:13:45] because the evidence of the Holy Spirit,
[1:13:47] no matter how you share it, it's love.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; You can take every one of Brother Bram's
[1:13:54] quotes on the evidence of the Holy
[1:13:56] Spirit, and it still goes back to love.
[1:13:58] Brother Bram said it was love. Then he
[1:14:00] said it was believing their word for
[1:14:01] your day. That's still love. And then he
[1:14:03] said, "It's the nature of Christ."
[1:14:04] That's still love.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's all love.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; So if you have problem with love to the
[1:14:09] littlest ones or when you're alone,
[1:14:11] nobody's remember when nobody's
[1:14:13] watching, God's still there.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; You know, just imagine when we get to
[1:14:20] heaven and God puts a film going of
[1:14:25] when you're in your private spots.
[1:14:30] But I am but all the bride of Christ is
[1:14:32] going to be watching.
[1:14:36] I want them erased. I don't want them
[1:14:39] covered. Sister Don, I don't want them
[1:14:40] covered. I want them gone. I want them
[1:14:43] gone. I don't want to just come to the
[1:14:44] Holy Spirit. I want to be the Holy
[1:14:46] Spirit.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Here here in our next quote, he said,
[1:14:50] "The Bible says, no man shall call Jesus
[1:14:52] the Christ only by the Holy Spirit." And
[1:14:55] the only thing that you can say, "Well,
[1:14:57] I believe he's the son of God." If you
[1:14:58] haven't been born again, you're taking
[1:15:01] someone's else's word for it. You say,
[1:15:03] "Well, the Bible said so." That's right.
[1:15:04] But the Bible's right. But what about
[1:15:06] you? You say, "Well, the preacher said
[1:15:08] so. The preacher's right, but what about
[1:15:10] you? Your mother says so. Well, your
[1:15:12] mother's right, but what about you?"
[1:15:14] It's a personal
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; experience of your own that you've got
[1:15:21] to be born again and you'll never or
[1:15:23] you'll never understand God. Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; I I God's concerned that we've come to
[1:15:30] him, but we're not him
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; cuz just look at the nature.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Next one. But it must be divine
[1:15:40] revelation. I believe uh Keith Reed
[1:15:43] mentioned this. It must be a divine
[1:15:45] revelation
[1:15:46] to you that takes a sin out of your
[1:15:49] heart. Intellectual fa Oh, I read this.
[1:15:52] Intellectual faith, it's not enough.
[1:15:54] Just cuz you know the Bible and you know
[1:15:56] the message, that's not enough.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; That's all right, but it only brings you
[1:16:00] to the Holy Spirit. You see that
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; right in the middle brings you to the
[1:16:05] Holy Spirit. You can tell by the nature
[1:16:08] of most believers that that's about
[1:16:09] where they've come.
[1:16:13] But the Holy Spirit is a a personal
[1:16:16] experience of birth, a new birth, a
[1:16:18] regeneration, making a new creature in
[1:16:21] Christ.
[1:16:23] Hey, there there's no way that God could
[1:16:25] have loved me.
[1:16:27] That was supernatural. It was
[1:16:30] supernatural love that that he left the
[1:16:32] splendor of heaven to come to somebody
[1:16:34] that was ugly.
[1:16:37] That's why when you get the nature of
[1:16:38] Christ, there will be people that does
[1:16:41] things wrong.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; And you'll just smile.
[1:16:46] Praise God. Said, "But they're living in
[1:16:48] sin." That's between them and God.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; They're angels talking to God about it.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; If Brother Dale calls up, when the
[1:17:00] angel's talking to Christ, it'll clog up
[1:17:02] the phone lines.
[1:17:06] Amen. Watch this. This is what I was
[1:17:08] preaching. A Old Testament covenant
[1:17:13] just covered the sin. We got to get this
[1:17:15] up here, Vicki. You got her. Thank you,
[1:17:18] Z. That's amazing.
[1:17:21] You don't have to take my word for this.
[1:17:22] That's what I was just saying. Old
[1:17:24] Testament covenant. It just covers sin.
[1:17:26] It never got rid of your anger.
[1:17:30] Never got rid of your temper. Never got
[1:17:33] rid of you mistreating the least
[1:17:35] beautiful, the little ones, the
[1:17:37] non-desirable.
[1:17:39] Never got rid of you having respects to
[1:17:42] the person. You're nice to your elders,
[1:17:44] but you are disrespectful to anybody
[1:17:47] that steps on your clothes.
[1:17:52] You never got rid of the sin desire. You
[1:17:54] can tell what covenant you're under
[1:17:58] by how you love.
[1:18:00] You thought I was making that up.
[1:18:06] If you are doing or saying or being
[1:18:09] mean, rude, hateful, fuss, arguing,
[1:18:15] showing lack of respect to indifferent,
[1:18:18] different times,
[1:18:20] it's the old covenant.
[1:18:26] Wow.
[1:18:27] The testament means covenant. The new
[1:18:30] testament means a new covenant. The old
[1:18:32] testament was old under the lambs. Let's
[1:18:35] go. Yeah, you got there. Lambs. Thank
[1:18:37] you, Vicki. Lambs. But that life could
[1:18:40] not come back on the believer because
[1:18:42] the animal. The reason it couldn't
[1:18:43] because they never had a soul. But the
[1:18:45] New Testament life was God, Jesus
[1:18:49] Christ,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God. And yeah, it could come
[1:18:53] back on us. That's a good thing because
[1:18:55] he's Jehovah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] Amen. And his life comes back on me and
[1:19:01] now I'm not me no more. I'm him.
[1:19:05] Cuz what did Paul say? That's very
[1:19:07] Bible. Paul said it's no longer I that
[1:19:08] liveth but Christ that liveth in me. So
[1:19:11] that means if it's no longer I that
[1:19:12] liveth but Christ lives in me. That
[1:19:14] means it'll only be but Christ betrayed
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; which will be one word.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] there. You show me one time where God
[1:19:26] never loved in the Bible.
[1:19:30] Every decision he made was love. Even
[1:19:32] when he put the people under
[1:19:33] persecution, it was to spread the gospel
[1:19:35] through the country. That was love.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; The New Testament, the lamb of God, his
[1:19:46] life comes back on us. The blood's life.
[1:19:50] Not the blood, the blood's life. The
[1:19:52] blood is the life of the new testament.
[1:19:55] The life is from the blood of the lamb
[1:19:58] which means the new testament
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; covenant.
[1:20:02] God's covenant,
[1:20:06] God's perfect covenant was agape love.
[1:20:08] I'm not talking about watch. You got all
[1:20:10] this. You got this felio love which is
[1:20:12] just attraction. And you also have in
[1:20:15] leodysian age. Brother Bram talked about
[1:20:17] this and I I have it on here but I don't
[1:20:19] have it sorted out. But leodysian love
[1:20:20] is self love. Everything's about me,
[1:20:23] mine. I, oh, I, you, I, who?
[1:20:27] Don't I, oh, I.
[1:20:30] I'm not talking about those men corrupt
[1:20:33] love. I'm talking about love that you
[1:20:35] love the unloly.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; We already read this one about Paul.
[1:20:42] See, Paul was operating under
[1:20:45] intellectual faith. I I fear. God fears
[1:20:49] that even even every minister that was
[1:20:51] at John Danquist we heard preached on
[1:20:53] this right here touched on this I
[1:20:55] already had it my iPad so I had said he
[1:20:59] said Mark had said this he said you know
[1:21:01] when we first got the message and we
[1:21:02] were young we were killing everybody
[1:21:05] ah they're wrong they're wrong I shoot
[1:21:07] them shoot them we we know the truth
[1:21:10] don't you know that's it kill him oh
[1:21:12] they're off there and then we realize
[1:21:14] that the personality of Jesus
[1:21:17] was to bless. That's what he said.
[1:21:20] Bless. Show love. God bless you. God
[1:21:24] bless you. Blessings. Blessings. But
[1:21:27] there might be I It don't matter if
[1:21:29] you're in sin. Blessings. God bless you.
[1:21:31] God bless you. You're in sin. God bless
[1:21:32] you anyway.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Said we realize. Did God send the
[1:21:40] message for us to just kill everybody?
[1:21:42] No. He sent us the message to love
[1:21:44] everybody. God bless you. God bless you
[1:21:47] to the stranger. God bless you to the
[1:21:49] people that have a different lifestyle.
[1:21:50] God bless you to everybody.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; How will that hurt them? It won't hurt
[1:21:57] them. That's what we're sent here for.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's the nature. That shows that you
[1:22:02] haven't just come to the Holy Spirit,
[1:22:04] but that you are the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference in the two
[1:22:08] covenants?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're close.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; See the difference? Yeah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; The old covenant covered covered the
[1:22:18] ugly dale
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; and then as soon as it was gone, you
[1:22:23] know, I I let me tell you another story.
[1:22:24] Now I'm exposing my life
[1:22:27] for you to see it. I can remember being
[1:22:29] at Pete and Roo Snow's place and Brigden
[1:22:31] and Hank Vroom Hank and Vroom was there
[1:22:33] and their boy did something that was I
[1:22:35] think going to hurt somebody and I
[1:22:38] and Blanch looked like I'd shot her.
[1:22:42] See, I was just covered.
[1:22:45] The old brother Dale was, "Hey, listen.
[1:22:47] You're there, too. You have to make a
[1:22:49] decision. Are you under the old covenant
[1:22:51] or the new one?"
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; If I was under the new one, it would
[1:22:54] have been gone. Sister Julie would go
[1:22:55] gone. That couldn't have come on me cuz
[1:22:57] it wasn't there. But it was still there.
[1:22:59] So, it came out.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I I actually think, you know, one of our
[1:23:03] kids was going to hurt somebody else.
[1:23:04] But, see,
[1:23:05] and and I I scared and hurt everybody's
[1:23:07] feelings cuz see, I just covered my
[1:23:10] sins.
[1:23:11] I just covered them saying, "Oh, bless
[1:23:13] God. I believe Brother Ram's a prophet.
[1:23:14] So is the devil.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; He trembles. I believe the message is
[1:23:17] true. So is the devil." He He knows it's
[1:23:19] true.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Remember what they said? But he can't
[1:23:24] love.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; The devil. Oh, the devil believes the
[1:23:28] Bible's true. I believe the Bible's
[1:23:29] true. Yeah. Well, that ain't that great.
[1:23:30] You know, the devil believes it and
[1:23:32] trembles, but he can't love.
[1:23:34] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; He's The devil's come right up to the
[1:23:37] Holy Spirit,
[1:23:39] but he can't take it. Cuz if he did,
[1:23:42] then he'd be my brother.
[1:23:44] He wouldn't be the devil no more. And so
[1:23:47] you can tell by the nature.
[1:23:50] The nature. So watch this. Like watch
[1:23:53] this. So you know people that have
[1:23:55] trouble with little kids,
[1:23:57] you you always got to watch. The devil
[1:23:59] knows your weak spots.
[1:24:05] He studies you
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; and so old other than me and sister
[1:24:10] Donna and and a few and and sister
[1:24:13] Patty, but like sometimes older people
[1:24:15] kids will disturb them.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Guess who knows that?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Satan knows that. So then when the kid
[1:24:24] ralls them up, you can tell what
[1:24:27] covenant they're under.
[1:24:30] Yeah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; See, because it's when that happens, you
[1:24:39] can tell whether it's covered or gone.
[1:24:42] It can't it if it's gone, if it's no
[1:24:44] longer me that liveth, but Christ that
[1:24:45] liveth in me, then it's gone. Because
[1:24:48] Christ said, "Forsake not the the little
[1:24:50] ones, but let them come unto me. For
[1:24:52] such is the kingdom of heaven. If you
[1:24:54] don't love the little ones, you're not
[1:24:55] even going to be in heaven."
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:58] You see how you can tell what covenant
[1:25:00] you're under?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; One was imperfect
[1:25:04] and one's perfect.
[1:25:06] God's perfect. Amen. Amen. I got to
[1:25:10] hurry.
[1:25:13] So Paul, he had his intellectual faith.
[1:25:16] He knew what the word of God said. Watch
[1:25:18] this. He did. He was living under Moses
[1:25:21] law.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Remember Stephen? They wanted to kill
[1:25:25] Stephen because Stephen was bringing
[1:25:27] grace. They stoned Stephen for obeying
[1:25:31] Jesus
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; because they said he blasphemes the law
[1:25:35] of Moses. That spirit's still alive.
[1:25:38] Spirits don't die.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; So, you can still kill people that you
[1:25:43] don't think are following the prophet's
[1:25:45] message properly
[1:25:48] and and that just shows that you've only
[1:25:50] come to it, but you haven't become it.
[1:25:54] Oh, that's just unbelievable.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I want to close with this story. And I
[1:26:00] have
[1:26:01] dozens more scriptures that I've never
[1:26:04] read once
[1:26:06] on love.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; So, it might be part four
[1:26:13] or whatever. Let's turn to Luke 7
[1:26:17] 36- 48. I want to close with this story.
[1:26:28] I already mentioned it, but I want to go
[1:26:29] into it in detail.
[1:26:31] Here, one of the Pharisees desired to
[1:26:33] have Jesus come to eat with them. He
[1:26:36] didn't really want him in his house.
[1:26:37] That's what brother Bram said, but he
[1:26:38] went to the Pharisee house,
[1:26:41] and he sat down with me. This was
[1:26:44] Christ. And behold, a woman of the city,
[1:26:47] second verse, 37, sorry, which was a
[1:26:50] sinner. Uh-oh. We know. We can pick out
[1:26:53] those sinners. They don't look like us.
[1:26:59] When she knew that Jesus was at the
[1:27:02] Pharisee house, she bought a box of
[1:27:05] ointment.
[1:27:06] What? What's that first word? Whatever
[1:27:08] that is, but a box of ointment.
[1:27:13] And she stood at the feet of Jesus
[1:27:15] behind him weeping and began to wash his
[1:27:18] feet with her tears and did wipe him
[1:27:21] with the hairs of her head and kiss his
[1:27:24] feet and anoint them.
[1:27:27] And the Pharisee
[1:27:34] now the Pharisee was the message
[1:27:36] believers of their day.
[1:27:39] Everybody agree with that? That was the
[1:27:41] church. So can I change that word to
[1:27:43] message believer?
[1:27:45] You can see the truth. But there and now
[1:27:48] the message believer which had bidden
[1:27:50] Jesus bidden him saw that he spake
[1:27:59] bitten Jesus saw that he spake within
[1:28:02] himself saying this man
[1:28:06] if he were Christ
[1:28:09] he was a lot more than a prophet. he was
[1:28:11] Jehovah.
[1:28:13] He would know who that man or woman was
[1:28:17] that's touching him. For she she's not
[1:28:20] worthy.
[1:28:22] She's a sinner.
[1:28:25] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:28:27] Simon,
[1:28:29] good old Simon, you message believer,
[1:28:33] I have somewhat to say unto thee.
[1:28:38] And he said, "Master, say on."
[1:28:42] He said, "Now there was a certain
[1:28:43] creditor that had debts, and one owned
[1:28:46] 500 p,
[1:28:49] and the other 50,
[1:28:51] and when they had nothing to pay, they
[1:28:53] frankly forgave both. Tell me therefore,
[1:28:57] which one
[1:28:59] will love
[1:29:01] the most?"
[1:29:06] And Simon, the message believer, the
[1:29:08] Pharisee, answered and said, Well, I
[1:29:10] suppose he that was forgiven the most.
[1:29:14] And he said unto him, Thou hast judged,
[1:29:19] thou has rightly judged. And he turned
[1:29:21] to the woman and said unto him, said
[1:29:24] unto Simon, "Seeest thou this woman?
[1:29:28] I entered into thine
[1:29:33] I entered into thine house and thou gave
[1:29:36] me no water for my feet but she washed
[1:29:39] my feet with her tears. You wiped them
[1:29:42] with her hairs of her head. Thou gavest
[1:29:45] me no kiss but the woman since the time
[1:29:48] I have came in has not ceased to kiss my
[1:29:53] feet.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Now let's just stop there.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Is this the Bible? Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Is this Jesus talking?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Is Jesus God?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's gross.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; If you seen somebody showing that much
[1:30:19] respect to anybody in the church, you'd
[1:30:21] be grossed out. You tell them to stop.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know? You know, they were
[1:30:27] mentioning I I'm gonna just stop here
[1:30:29] for a sec. Stay right there, Vicki. I
[1:30:31] want to show you something. you know, he
[1:30:33] mentioned, you know, I I believe one of
[1:30:34] the brothers in the weekend, he said,
[1:30:36] you know, when David was being sought by
[1:30:38] Saul to be killed and and Bethlehem was
[1:30:42] seized by the the enemy and he was on
[1:30:46] the mountaintop and he looked down into
[1:30:48] Bethlehem and there he played as a kid
[1:30:50] and and where he'd played ball and
[1:30:52] soccer and drunk at the well of
[1:30:55] Jerusalem and all this place and maybe
[1:30:57] it was, you know, where he grew up, you
[1:30:59] know, and he looked down and he said,
[1:31:01] "Oh, Oh, he said, "I wished I could just
[1:31:03] get a drink
[1:31:06] from that well."
[1:31:09] And David's soldiers were not Jews.
[1:31:14] See, the Jews, see, the Bible says the
[1:31:16] prophets poorly received in his own
[1:31:18] land.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; So, David's own people never accepted
[1:31:26] him.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I mean, God's trying to show
[1:31:30] you something. David's own family never
[1:31:33] accepted him.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; His brothers mocked him and his dad
[1:31:39] mocked him. He said, "Well, there's just
[1:31:40] a squirt left watching the sheep."
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch this. Watch the
[1:31:45] nature. Watch the nature.
[1:31:48] But that little squirt, David's angel
[1:31:50] was reporting to God.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:31:56] watch that. Remember, the next time you
[1:31:59] want to flip out on somebody, their
[1:32:01] angel takes it to the white throne
[1:32:03] judgment.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Ouch.
[1:32:12] But this is what I wanted to bring up
[1:32:14] when I mentioned this. David was like
[1:32:18] David was not king.
[1:32:21] David was anointed going to be anointed
[1:32:23] king or he was anointed to be king, but
[1:32:26] it was like the bride. I'm going to I
[1:32:28] preached that before here in the early
[1:32:30] spring after the new year. The bride's
[1:32:33] anointing. Dave here. David was anointed
[1:32:34] to be king, but he never had a throne,
[1:32:36] never had a kingdom, never had an army.
[1:32:38] It's like the bride of Christ. But the
[1:32:42] foreigners
[1:32:44] that were not Jews recognized that David
[1:32:47] was the anointed of God. And this is
[1:32:50] what I want to get to you. This
[1:32:53] they were like the Gentiles to the Jews.
[1:32:55] We were pagan by religion,
[1:32:58] but we recognized that's why we were
[1:33:01] grafted in because we recognize that
[1:33:03] Jesus was the Christ. And there Jesus'
[1:33:06] own family, his very own people, nailed
[1:33:08] him on the cross, the Jews. Now watch
[1:33:11] this. But to those people, David's least
[1:33:15] command, least desire, sorry. Sorry I
[1:33:18] messed that up. David's least desire was
[1:33:22] a command to them.
[1:33:26] That's like this woman right here. They
[1:33:29] Jesus desire was that he would get his
[1:33:31] feet washed and he would get a kiss on
[1:33:33] his feet. Like normally they would kiss
[1:33:35] your cheek and wash your feet. And the
[1:33:39] message people, Simon, the Pharisees,
[1:33:42] they only wanted Jesus there for
[1:33:44] popularity, but they hated him.
[1:33:48] Amen. They hated him.
[1:33:50] But to Jesus, his least desire was
[1:33:54] somebody that was a sinner.
[1:33:56] But to David, his least desire was, "Oh,
[1:33:59] I yearn for a drink of water from the
[1:34:02] well that I played around." And the the
[1:34:04] men that weren't even Jews fought their
[1:34:06] way down, brought the water back to
[1:34:07] David. It was just it was just a common
[1:34:10] remark.
[1:34:12] I could sure use a hand.
[1:34:15] It was like, "No problem. I'll be there.
[1:34:21] Wow.
[1:34:25] You never get that response in the Bible
[1:34:28] from the same land as the priesthood.
[1:34:32] See, Jesus own people rejected him.
[1:34:36] David's own people rejected him as king.
[1:34:39] His own family rejected him. He had to
[1:34:41] go to another country.
[1:34:50] Watch this. Watch what David or what
[1:34:51] Jesus says.
[1:34:55] She has kissed my feet and my head with
[1:34:58] oil.
[1:35:00] Thou didest not anoint, but this woman
[1:35:04] hath anointed my feet with ointment.
[1:35:07] Verse 47. Wherefore I say unto you, her
[1:35:10] sins
[1:35:12] which were many,
[1:35:15] we would have judged her for. We would
[1:35:17] not have showed love and we would have
[1:35:20] been rebuked if she would have come up
[1:35:22] and talked to the pastor and washed his
[1:35:24] shoes
[1:35:28] are forgiven.
[1:35:30] For she loved much because whom little
[1:35:33] is given, the same loveth little.
[1:35:40] And he said unto her, "Thy sins are
[1:35:43] forgiven." Let's just read that. For she
[1:35:46] loved much,
[1:35:48] because whom little is forgiven,
[1:35:51] the same loveth little. I wonder
[1:35:56] I wonder if people that were born in
[1:35:59] this message,
[1:36:01] never went out in the world and sinned
[1:36:04] and they were always a goody to choose,
[1:36:07] always did what was right,
[1:36:10] can love God the way he wants it
[1:36:13] because they don't feel like they really
[1:36:15] ever were forgiven.
[1:36:23] the people that love God the most.
[1:36:27] You know, watch this. I'm closing. The
[1:36:29] angels can't worship God like we can
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; because they weren't forgiven of
[1:36:34] anything.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; They can sing better, but they weren't
[1:36:38] forgiven.
[1:36:40] But when the forgiven get to heaven and
[1:36:43] they worship not just their king but
[1:36:45] their savior,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; you see
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; to whom much is forgiven
[1:36:53] can love much.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:36:59] Just let that sink in.
[1:37:06] And we would look down on those people
[1:37:09] because we feel like in our flesh we're
[1:37:11] better than them. But to Christ were
[1:37:14] actually second.
[1:37:16] Cuz there's no way
[1:37:19] that a person that's been forgiven very
[1:37:21] little can love the same as somebody
[1:37:26] that don't feel like they deserve it.
[1:37:30] Unending love.
[1:37:33] that God should love a sinner such as I.
[1:37:35] You can come honey.
[1:37:37] Such love.
[1:37:40] Such unbelievable
[1:37:42] love. Such undeserving love.
[1:37:47] Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's the nature of the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:54] Love.
[1:37:58] You know, there's there's the Bible's
[1:38:00] full of examples. You know, look at, you
[1:38:03] know, in David's kingdom when the the
[1:38:05] one young man tricked the girl in to
[1:38:07] come and and bring her food and that was
[1:38:10] in David's family. I don't this is just
[1:38:12] fresh anointing. Amen. And and and it
[1:38:15] was wrong. It was simple what he did.
[1:38:19] But David judged the people that that
[1:38:21] that judged that as sin
[1:38:25] because yes, it was wrong.
[1:38:28] See, God, watch this. When love goes
[1:38:30] forth, grace covers it. Love covers sin.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And the atonement for sin was love. The
[1:38:40] atonement for a wrong was grace.
[1:38:42] Adultery,
[1:38:44] incest, anything that it's wrong. It's
[1:38:48] flat wrong. But when sovereign love went
[1:38:51] forth, sovereign grace took over. When
[1:38:53] love went forth, sovereign grace took
[1:38:56] over.
[1:38:57] It's God's love that covers our sins.
[1:39:01] It's not the judgment of the righteous.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Watch that. Now, I'm not promoting sin,
[1:39:10] but that was Christ himself that showed
[1:39:12] that example.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And so, watch this. When when the woman
[1:39:16] was brought to Jesus in the very act and
[1:39:19] and there the Pharisees, back to the
[1:39:20] message believers, they said, "Well,
[1:39:22] look at that. We caught her." And your
[1:39:25] Bible says she shouldn't be allowed to
[1:39:28] have a position in the church.
[1:39:34] Actually, what they said is your Bible
[1:39:35] says that she deserves to be stoned.
[1:39:39] And Jesus wrote on the sand
[1:39:42] and they still portrayed him. They said,
[1:39:44] "Let's kill her. She's got to be killed.
[1:39:46] That's what your Bible says. Let's kill
[1:39:49] her."
[1:39:52] And Jesus was looking at the covering.
[1:39:54] He was looking at election. He was
[1:39:57] looking through love. But all the
[1:39:59] message believers,
[1:40:02] the Pharisees, that was that was the
[1:40:04] message of the day. The Pharisees of the
[1:40:08] day was the was the truth. That was
[1:40:10] Moses law.
[1:40:12] Moses was a prophet.
[1:40:15] But God was changing depositions
[1:40:19] and he was going from law to grace. He
[1:40:21] was going from imperfect to perfect.
[1:40:24] He was going from the prophets to
[1:40:26] Jehovah
[1:40:28] and they missed it.
[1:40:31] And they wanted to judge her because
[1:40:32] they knew her faults and they knew her
[1:40:36] life. And God said, "I forgive her
[1:40:40] because I have love."
[1:40:47] Love.
[1:40:50] Not that I have love.
[1:40:52] I am love.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; I don't have it. I actually am it.
[1:41:04] Love. Amazing
[1:41:08] love.
[1:41:10] I tell you, next week we're going to
[1:41:12] when we pick up on this love again, I'm
[1:41:14] going to I'm going to show you some of
[1:41:15] them stories of David where we're
[1:41:17] blighting
[1:41:19] blighting evil sins.
[1:41:22] David said, "Let it go."
[1:41:25] Because he was a father
[1:41:29] that was a man after God's own heart
[1:41:33] and he had love.
[1:41:37] And he had love
[1:41:39] say wrong. Yeah, that's wrong.
[1:41:42] But love covered it.
[1:41:46] Love covered it.
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:50] It wasn't Jesus blood that saved you. It
[1:41:53] was his love that saved you. It was the
[1:41:56] life in the blood. It was the nature of
[1:42:00] the blood was love.
[1:42:05] I deserved hell. You deserved hell.
[1:42:12] But love said no.
[1:42:16] Love
[1:42:18] said no.
[1:42:20] Not this one.
[1:42:23] Amazing love.
[1:42:25] What covenant are we living under?
[1:42:30] the old one
[1:42:32] or the new one.
[1:42:36] Very clear to see.
[1:42:39] Just watch somebody's life. You know,
[1:42:41] there was a a man that got killed here
[1:42:43] recently and he was he was given good
[1:42:45] advice to a young couple and I I am
[1:42:47] actually trying to close.
[1:42:50] He said, "Before you marry somebody,
[1:42:54] you should go on a long road trip with
[1:42:56] them."
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:42:59] and watch somebody cut them off
[1:43:02] and see what covenant they're under.
[1:43:06] Watch them run out of money
[1:43:09] when they're at the restaurant and their
[1:43:10] debit card don't work.
[1:43:13] Watch them get a bad waitress.
[1:43:17] And he said, "Now that's the person
[1:43:18] you're going to live with."
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:24] Because see, when they're under the
[1:43:26] pressure,
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] it'll show if it's gone or just covered.
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:40] If it's covered, it's just we just came
[1:43:42] to the Holy Spirit, but we are not the
[1:43:44] Holy Spirit.
[1:43:47] But if it's gone,
[1:43:50] nothing out of the abundance of the
[1:43:51] heart, the mouth speaketh.
[1:43:54] The joys of a child is he just speaks
[1:43:56] exactly what mom and dad said at home in
[1:43:59] secret. They just come to church and
[1:44:01] say, "Well, the cow died and the truck
[1:44:02] ran into the tree." And they're like,
[1:44:05] "Oh, I wish they would have heard that."
[1:44:08] But that's what's recorded in heaven.
[1:44:14] Dad kicked the cat.
[1:44:17] That's cuz what they seen. They're just
[1:44:19] saying it honestly.
[1:44:22] You're hiding it because you're under
[1:44:24] the old covenant.
[1:44:27] But if it's gone,
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:31] it's in the sea of forgetfulness. I
[1:44:33] can't find it anymore.
[1:44:36] It can't come up cuz out of the
[1:44:37] abundance of the heart, I can't say it
[1:44:39] cuz it it ain't there. That memory's
[1:44:41] gone. Says,
[1:44:43] "Wow,
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:49] help me, Jesus.
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:56] Think about his love.

[1:46:45] that, I want to share something with
[1:46:46] you.
[1:46:49] Amen. That was quick.
[1:46:54] The Bible says that if you love those
[1:46:56] that love you, don't the Pharisees also
[1:47:02] pretty easy. But if you love the people
[1:47:04] that hate you,
[1:47:07] shows what covenant you're under. If you
[1:47:10] show love the people that have hurt you
[1:47:13] or disappointed you,
[1:47:16] shows what covenant you're under. Amen.
