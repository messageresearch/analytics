[27:10] about four years ago.
[27:13] God delivered me of a stronghold, a
[27:15] mental stronghold.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into the whole uh
[27:22] deliverance. I've actually got like a
[27:23] little YouTube video that we did of it,
[27:25] and if you want to just just ask me for
[27:29] it. But um
[27:31] but I just want to let you know that if
[27:33] you're dealing with any sort of mental
[27:34] struggles, anything that's like saying
[27:37] just has you bound mentally and
[27:40] &gt;&gt; you can't seem to break free of it
[27:43] that God knows and he
[27:46] &gt;&gt; will bring a day of deliverance for you
[27:49] &gt;&gt; that
[27:50] &gt;&gt; in a way sometimes that you just never
[27:52] even imagined and in a way that you
[27:54] never thought possible and he'll bring
[27:56] the answers you seek.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then from that day on, it'll
[28:00] never be the same.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; And
[28:05] &gt;&gt; in my deliverance, the biggest thing
[28:06] that I came away with is that God
[28:10] cares so much.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; I think Satan to think that we're not
[28:16] alone and he doesn't see us and that he
[28:19] doesn't hear our cries
[28:21] &gt;&gt; and that he doesn't care about us
[28:24] personally.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; But he does.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; He does. Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; And he showed me in such a beautiful way
[28:31] that it was just like
[28:33] &gt;&gt; such an intimate love that he showed me.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; And the words of this song kind of
[28:40] reflect that, you know, that
[28:42] &gt;&gt; he's there no matter where I go, no
[28:44] matter what I go through.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; He knows me more than anybody else.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Even myself
[28:53] words from the song.
[28:54] May it lift your heart and may be
[28:57] encouraged tonight.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; I'll never drift from your loving care.
[29:10] There's not a me.
[29:16] The winds of the morning will lift me to
[29:19] you. The blackest of nights, your light
[29:23] will shine through. You're already
[29:25] there. No matter where I go.
[29:31] Even before I came to thee, your loving
[29:36] eyes were looking at me.
[29:40] You're even closer than the very breath
[29:43] that I take.
[29:46] Mother and father more than a friend to
[29:50] me. Beginning and living and ending of
[29:53] life to me.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; The song I find myself singing when I
[29:59] awake.
[30:01] So I
[30:04] will praise.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[30:09] I praise you.
[30:12] Now
[30:14] I praise you
[30:18] for lifting me up and giving me wings.
[30:22] For keeping my eyes on heavenly things.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; For being the song that I can't help but
[30:29] sing. Praise you.
[30:35] Look at me Lord. I'm open to you.
[30:39] do anything that you want to do. For you
[30:44] know me even better than I know myself.
[30:50] I'll not be afraid of what you might see
[30:54] because you know the inside of me.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; I'll not even try to hide what you know
[31:02] so well.
[31:05] Lord, just be patient with my mistakes.
[31:09] I want to be yours, whatever it takes.
[31:14] For I've learned that life without you
[31:17] is no life at all.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Failures and talents and schemes I bring
[31:24] to you. Aspirations and dreams I leave
[31:28] to you. I'll just be here ready whenever
[31:32] you call.
[31:35] So I
[31:37] will praise you
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Lord.

[33:10] but that's all right.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; It's all right.

[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you, Jesus.
[33:32] Thank you for the blood. Amen. It's
[33:34] beautiful.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; So there's just I just want to give you
[33:37] a quick testimony of that song. One time
[33:41] um I was sang that song at church and I
[33:47] didn't know at the time that God would
[33:48] deal with me with in a special way.
[33:52] And I didn't even know that day that I
[33:56] was still holding grudges over somebody.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; And while I was singing, the song says,
[34:04] um, you have washed me white. And every
[34:06] time I sing the chorus, it was like, you
[34:09] have washed me white. And then he's
[34:10] like, yes, Julie, I've washed you white.
[34:13] Then the next time I sing, you have
[34:16] washed me white. Then it says, yes, I've
[34:18] also w washed white. that person
[34:22] &gt;&gt; and I'm like okay where you going with
[34:24] this and then I sing again you have
[34:27] washed me white and then it says but you
[34:30] haven't
[34:32] &gt;&gt; and but like I mean I cannot pay for her
[34:35] sins right
[34:36] &gt;&gt; sure
[34:37] &gt;&gt; but God did I had to forgive this person
[34:41] &gt;&gt; and then at that moment I my heart was
[34:44] so full of love for this person it's not
[34:47] my love
[34:48] &gt;&gt; at all the person does not deserve it.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; But you know cuz the person is a human
[34:54] just like I am
[34:55] &gt;&gt; you know
[34:57] &gt;&gt; and
[34:58] &gt;&gt; but it just filled my heart with so much
[35:01] love for this person
[35:03] &gt;&gt; and I mean I just cried and worshiped
[35:06] God and from that moment and then I
[35:08] wrote to the person I said you know what
[35:10] this happened at church and I forgive
[35:12] you please can you forgive me and it's
[35:14] just so beautiful the way God
[35:22] And I had a sister that had actually
[35:24] told me, she said, "Julie, the symptoms
[35:26] are coming back." Like because I had
[35:28] been sick for a few years in 2018, but
[35:31] and those symptoms were coming back. And
[35:33] we were ch chatting about like all the
[35:35] holistic way of things we can do to
[35:37] heal. And at the end of our
[35:39] conversation, she said, and then I ended
[35:41] up saying, "You know what? I do feel a
[35:42] grudge for this person." And she said,
[35:44] "You know, Julie, that could be why the
[35:47] symptoms are coming back in your life
[35:48] right now because of that grudge."
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And then few months later, then in my
[35:53] heart that night, I was like, "Oh yeah,
[35:54] forgive her." But no, God had another
[35:57] way for me to truly experience his love
[36:01] for that person. And since I that
[36:04] happened in church I my symptoms I have
[36:07] not had any symptoms
[36:12] &gt;&gt; because many times you know our healing
[36:15] you know many times Jesus would say your
[36:18] for your forgiveness earned you know I
[36:20] give you forgiveness and then you're
[36:21] healed because it's attached sir anyway.
[36:25] Yes sir.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:32] I
[36:33] was a wretch. I remember who I was.
[36:39] I was lost.
[36:42] I was blind.
[36:44] I was running out of time.
[36:49] Sin
[36:51] separated.
[36:54] The bridge was far too wide.
[36:58] From the far side of the chasm,
[37:03] you held me in your sight.
[37:07] So you
[37:09] made a way
[37:12] across the great divine
[37:16] left behind
[37:18] heaven's throne
[37:21] to build it here inside.
[37:26] And there
[37:27] at the cross,
[37:30] you paid the debt I owed.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Break broke my chain,
[37:37] freed my soul.
[37:40] For the first time I had hope.

[38:20] You took my place,
[38:24] laid inside my tomb of sin.
[38:29] You were buried for three days,
[38:33] but then you walked right out again.
[38:38] Now death
[38:40] has no sting
[38:42] &gt;&gt; and life has no end
[38:47] for I have been transformed
[38:51] &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb.

[51:14] &gt;&gt; And I said to him this morning, "Brother
[51:16] John, you know, we talked and I said,

[51:56] Dale about 7 days after we got an email
[52:00] &gt;&gt; please bring Mrs. smartly passport or

[52:24] says, "I have people applied for the
[52:26] Canadian visa 3 months, 4 months,
[52:29] &gt;&gt; and you just applied and within 5 days,
[52:31] you got it.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; What did you do?"
[52:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "God is on the job. I'm going
[52:38] about God's business."
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Unstoppable.

[52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; This is just a preview, right?
[52:46] &gt;&gt; But tonight, I I I didn't come with a
[52:49] polished message. Yeah.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; I I want to change just a little thing
[52:55] tonight in the sense that
[52:57] &gt;&gt; from the heart

[53:00] &gt;&gt; from my heart.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm I'm bringing this in a realm
[53:05] by the Holy Spirit that sometimes we
[53:09] stand and we preach that people like it
[53:11] because they're familiar with the
[53:13] quotes.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; But I want us to take that belief and
[53:18] put it in action. Right.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; We're going to believe a prodigal son
[53:25] coming home.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[53:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to believe a backsliding
[53:30] daughter
[53:31] &gt;&gt; is coming back to Christ.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to believe that a
[53:38] backsliding son is going to repent
[53:40] tonight.
[53:43] Just as though I believe that I I'm I'm
[53:46] going to make it to glory,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe that my neighbor is
[53:49] going to make it.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I'm using that same belief.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; I believe that God forgive me.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I'm using that same belief.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; When I met Ronda and Ken and I talked to
[54:02] them and is did I pronounce it right?
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And the spirit says, "I didn't meet
[54:07] these two people in coincidence.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; I believe predestination."
[54:13] &gt;&gt; When I listen to them and Ronda sharing
[54:16] her testimony and Ken openly
[54:19] &gt;&gt; talking of his a little synopsis of his
[54:23] past and
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and I said to Ronda, I said, "All that
[54:26] you're being through, God was forging
[54:27] you
[54:28] &gt;&gt; to be who you are today." and
[54:31] &gt;&gt; I stand as
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see you on the other side.

[54:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see you there.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; This is what we're going to preach
[54:52] tonight.

[56:32] blessing to your heart.
[56:36] You can love
[56:40] me
[56:44] in a prison
[56:46] [Music]
[56:49] &gt;&gt; and throw
[56:52] &gt;&gt; away
[56:55] the keep.
[57:00] Take
[57:03] away
[57:06] my vision
[57:11] from desires
[57:15] that now
[57:18] can see.
[57:24] Deprive
[57:27] me of
[57:30] the food
[57:33] I eat.
[57:36] And even
[57:40] bow
[57:42] my head
[57:45] and feet.
[57:48] But as long
[57:51] as I
[57:54] know Jesus,
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] I could
[58:03] still
[58:06] go free.
[58:09] [Music]
[58:11] He said that
[58:15] I could still
[58:18] go free.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; What kind
[58:26] of a man
[58:29] would reach down
[58:32] his end
[58:35] and do this for me?
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:43] I'm so unworthy
[58:47] to live
[58:49] and not fit
[58:52] to keep.
[58:55] But the man on
[58:58] the cross
[59:00] had my name in
[59:03] his will.
[59:05] He said that
[59:09] I could still
[59:12] go free.
[59:18] My name
[59:21] could
[59:24] quite
[59:27] understand
[59:30] why he
[59:33] would leave
[59:36] his home.
[59:39] Glory. Hallelujah.
[59:40] [Music]
[59:41] And too late
[59:44] to try
[59:48] alone
[59:50] some pad
[59:53] and feel pain
[59:56] and flesh.
[59:58] Flesh and bone.
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:10] Jesus
[1:00:16] that leads
[1:00:19] to Calary.
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:27] When his blood
[1:00:30] red sand
[1:00:33] broke all
[1:00:35] sins chain
[1:00:38] that I
[1:00:41] could still
[1:00:44] go free.
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:49] He said that
[1:00:52] I could still
[1:00:55] go free.
[1:01:01] Tell me what kind
[1:01:04] of a man
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] and reach down
[1:01:10] is it
[1:01:13] and do this for me.
[1:01:20] I'm so unworthy
[1:01:24] to live
[1:01:26] and I'm not fit
[1:01:29] to keep
[1:01:32] but the man on
[1:01:35] the cross
[1:01:37] and my name in
[1:01:40] his will.
[1:01:42] He said that I
[1:01:46] I could still
[1:01:48] go free.
[1:01:52] Yes.
[1:01:54] He said that I
[1:01:57] could still
[1:02:00] go free.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] What kind
[1:02:08] of a man
[1:02:11] who would reach down
[1:02:14] his hand
[1:02:17] and do this for me?
[1:02:24] I'm so unworthy
[1:02:28] to live
[1:02:30] and I've nothing
[1:02:34] to give.
[1:02:36] But the man on
[1:02:39] the ground.
[1:02:41] I said the man on
[1:02:45] the cross.
[1:02:47] The made of
[1:02:50] the cross.
[1:02:52] Yes. The
[1:02:55] cross. He had my name in

[1:03:02] He said that I
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:07] could still
[1:03:10] go free.
[1:03:20] Hallelujah.
[1:03:23] People praise the Lord.
[1:03:26] And the three people praise the
[1:03:30] heal.
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God Almighty. I pray that
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; that's the real freedom.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's the real freedom.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

[1:03:53] praises.
[1:03:54] Nothing stop your worship. Hallelujah.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; He said that I could go free.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; When your neighbor look at you, they see
[1:04:04] wrongs and they see falls.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; But in his will, he see a perfect
[1:04:09] brother.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Nothing can stop that.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:04:18] Let's just turn tonight to the book of
[1:04:20] John chapter 11 and something familiar
[1:04:24] with but it's not a story.

[1:04:49] that she followed was murdered.

[1:04:59] together. everything just said, man,
[1:05:02] it's not the not that she goes, but the
[1:05:04] way she died.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Remember the family in prayer
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; and uh let's just pray. Father, I thank
[1:05:13] you for your amazing grace.

[1:05:38] anticipating a special anointing from
[1:05:40] you. Father,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; we're not looking to a man or hurt
[1:05:44] vessel, but we're listening to the voice
[1:05:46] of God.

[1:05:49] want to say, God, and humbling myself,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, before your wife, Lord, I
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; am not privileged. I have no word of my
[1:05:56] own to speak to your wife. It's not
[1:05:58] mine. It's your wife. And but Lord, if
[1:06:01] I'm just a simple voice, a vessel that
[1:06:04] you're going to just speak through to
[1:06:06] speak to her, Lord, in Jesus name, I
[1:06:08] humble myself and I yield my entire
[1:06:11] being, God, for you to use tonight.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you have a word for us and
[1:06:15] that's all about

[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you tonight
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; for your greatness and what you have
[1:06:32] done, what you will be doing
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus name.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; You know uh
[1:06:39] John chapter 11 I'm going to read from
[1:06:41] verse 20. Not going through all of it
[1:06:44] because even the very smallest of the
[1:06:46] child know what this is about.
[1:06:49] Then Martha, as soon as you heard that
[1:06:51] Jesus was coming, John 11 from verse 20,
[1:06:55] he went and met him. But Mary, stay sat
[1:06:59] still in the house.
[1:07:02] Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord,
[1:07:06] if thou hast been here, my brother had
[1:07:09] not died. But I know.
[1:07:13] Very interesting. I want you to look at
[1:07:15] each word that she says.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I know
[1:07:19] that even now whatsoever you shall ask
[1:07:23] of God, he will give it to you.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus bringing her. That's a
[1:07:31] wonderful belief.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Sometime we know so much
[1:07:38] but we don't believe.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Right.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then Jesus said unto her,
[1:07:46] "Okay, thy brother shall rise again."
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Martha said, "I know." You see that? She
[1:07:53] knows so much.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; I know that he shall rise again in the
[1:07:58] resurrection at the last day. Beautiful.
[1:08:01] Is that right?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; She Jesus said unto her, "Well, I I am
[1:08:06] the resurrection."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And the life. Yes, sir.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; He that believeth in me, though he were
[1:08:13] dead, yet shall he live. And
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; whosoever believeth. That include you.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That include you, mother.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; That include you. Now you're standing
[1:08:25] before me shall this include you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Whosoever live, whosoever is living and
[1:08:32] believe on me
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; shall never die.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this?
[1:08:39] Martha, you believe it?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Listen what she says.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Listen what Martha just says. She said
[1:08:46] unto him, "Yes, Lord, I believe."
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; That you are the Christ.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The son of God.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Which should come into the world.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's a beautiful statement.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Then you know went on Jesus said, "Okay,
[1:09:06] fine. Take it to the tomb." All right.
[1:09:09] And Jesus said, "Take me to the tomb."
[1:09:11] Jesus said, "Okay, take away the stone."
[1:09:12] Martha said, "Am I verse 3 tonight?"
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; There you go. Yes, sir.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, by this time he stinkketh.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; You just said,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; you believe.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; You believe.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; You just said, "I know that even now
[1:09:29] whatever you ask God for will give it to
[1:09:31] you."
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; You just said that. We sing the song
[1:09:34] Only Believe All Things Are Possible. We
[1:09:37] love that song. Is it right?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; But now you're saying, "Lord, by this
[1:09:42] time he's staying, for he had been dead
[1:09:46] four days."
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Jes said Jesus said unto her.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, said not unto thee, if
[1:09:56] you would believe,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; if you believe, you would see the glory
[1:10:03] of God.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] That's all I was saying.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you this evening.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Jesus.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Bless you Lord. Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; There is a time when your belief carries
[1:10:17] more power than the volume of your
[1:10:20] knowledge.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Sometime your knowledge is so much that
[1:10:27] it can become stagnated.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. and all it produces is still dirt
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; and wrapped you in a package called
[1:10:37] religion and no relationship.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; We can talk tonight and you know when
[1:10:48] you hear that song only believe
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; that's not just a song
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; that's a message to us.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; It's a message. Yeah,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; if we can just believe.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Just believe.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Just believe. A testimony and a sister
[1:11:11] in our church was diagnosed with stage
[1:11:14] four cancer.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; never raised in the message. Know
[1:11:19] nothing about the message. She just come
[1:11:22] and wanted a church to go to in the
[1:11:24] community.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. and and she came and
[1:11:28] she said, "And you know how we attract
[1:11:30] her?" I learned she was in the hospital,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; right? Right.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz her daughter come to church and I
[1:11:38] said to brother Junior's wife who said,
[1:11:40] "Buy her a bouquet and bring it to her
[1:11:42] and tell her we love her."
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. There you go.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Brother John by just expressing her with
[1:11:48] love.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; She said, "Oh my God,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; what a love."
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then she came, she says, "I
[1:11:56] want this church to be my church."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Kindness.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Kindness. Love.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; That's who we are.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; That's who the bride is made up.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Because God is love
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and Christ was love. And his love
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and all that Christ was, he poured into
[1:12:20] the church. Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; So we are who God is.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; After stage four cancer,
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; then after running and running, we
[1:12:31] prayed and we prayed and we believe God
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; that the same God of Elijah is here.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; The same God that was here is still
[1:12:41] here.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; The same God that walked with the
[1:12:44] prophet is still here.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:49] And the last days doctor says, "Where is
[1:12:51] the cancer?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Where is it? It's not there anymore.
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Can I preach on this? The power that our
[1:13:06] belief carries."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; How many can relate to us that when we
[1:13:15] were children, we we love God.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We grew up in church loving God,
[1:13:20] but we never fear God.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; We didn't even believe much in God. We
[1:13:25] just actually we fear the church more
[1:13:27] than how we fear God.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; And when we do things as teenagers, we
[1:13:32] hide from church.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Not realizing, brother John, we couldn't
[1:13:36] hide from God. We didn't even know we
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; hid from the pastor. We hid from the
[1:13:41] church members.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; But we we never fear God. Yeah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; But the word of God says in Proverbs
[1:13:47] chapter 1:7, the fear of God begins with
[1:13:50] knowledge.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; So now that we are being exposed to the
[1:13:53] true revelation of who God is, now fear
[1:13:57] begins.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; We are knowing who God is.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Not that he was
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; but who God is.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But understanding that he's a God of a
[1:14:08] history. He's your present tense.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's why we know how to fear God.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what increases our belief.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; The word of God says faith come by
[1:14:19] hearing
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; and hearing the word of God. So your
[1:14:22] faith increases the more you hear the
[1:14:25] word.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; But then understanding is what increases
[1:14:30] your belief.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's why G you remember that Jesus
[1:14:34] said that in Matthew chapter uh 13 verse
[1:14:37] 23 when he talk about the good soil and
[1:14:39] the good ground. He said they that hear
[1:14:42] the word and understand it,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; are those I am in call the good ground
[1:14:47] that the seed falls on
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and bear fruit and much fruit.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some 100 and some 60.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right saints?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So our understanding is very important.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:29:17] We're talking about putting what you
[1:29:19] know in action.
[1:29:21] You only believe and let the things come
[1:29:24] to pass.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; When I spoke to brother Dale and I told
[1:29:31] him, "Brother D, husband, don't worry
[1:29:33] yourself." He said, "I'm here praying
[1:29:36] for some rain." My mom, we got a shower.
[1:29:39] And by Tuesday, another shower. Oh, I
[1:29:43] saw the leaves of those corn just
[1:29:46] praising the Lord because there's a
[1:29:49] believer that the atmosphere.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; There was a believer that called the
[1:29:54] rain.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Glory. Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; He never give me a word of uncertainty.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm praying for rain.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Woo God.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:12] Hallelujah.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; "He that believe, he that hear my word,"
[1:30:17] John 5:24,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; "He that hear my word
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; and believe on him that sent me
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; pass from death to life
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; cannot come in condemnation.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; So believe shift your dimension."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Believe. Shift your dimension.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; So here
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; we receive it.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you, sir.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Shift the dimension.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; So, here Jesus, remember Jesus said to
[1:30:48] his disciples when he heard that Lazarus
[1:30:51] was sick,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; he said to say, "Your sickness is not
[1:30:56] for the glory of God."
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; So, Hallelujah.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; He said so. Yes.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Did he said that?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. He said so.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; It's for the glory of God.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; God. Yeah.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; They never understood one word.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; It's okay.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Just believe you will see the
[1:31:08] manifestation of God. Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; So heard Jesus go down and ma Amen. Met
[1:31:17] him and she said, "Lord, Amen. Oh, we
[1:31:21] know you're a healer
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; because if you were here, you wouldn't
[1:31:25] die cuz you would have healed him."
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You see, the glory of God cannot be
[1:31:33] confined within a religion.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; No. No. Glory.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; No. No. The glory of God is much wider
[1:31:40] than holy little knowledge of
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; glory. Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; So Jesus delayed four days. He knew he
[1:31:49] was is God.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; He knows it.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; So he was on time.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; This was not about the resurrection of
[1:31:58] Lazarus.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; This was about the manifestation of
[1:32:03] God's good. That's what he said.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. His sickness is on the glory of
[1:32:08] God.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; We're going to look at the glory of God
[1:32:12] shortly.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; She said, "No, Lord, I I know if you
[1:32:19] were here, my brother would not have
[1:32:20] died." Now, we believe in God as a
[1:32:22] healer, but what about him being the
[1:32:24] resurrector?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; What about him being the resurrection?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; What about him being the life?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; I know you're a healer.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So she said if you were
[1:32:36] here my brother would not have died.
[1:32:37] That mean I know you would heal it.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus said well
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; he shall rise again.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Now she said I know he's going to rise
[1:32:46] because from you know in my words can I
[1:32:49] paraphrase it?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; In my words I know we you know we were
[1:32:52] brought up in church know that there's
[1:32:53] going to be a general resurrection.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You see how far we can look
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; when the reality is standing before us.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. You see how far we
[1:33:04] gone? Yeah.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; General resurrection. Jesus said, "I I
[1:33:11] am here. I I am the resurrection."
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Pay attention.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Look at me, Martha. This is he.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; This is what the world has been talking
[1:33:19] about.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; This is the Christ of the sea. Look at
[1:33:22] me, Martha. And she was just going on.
[1:33:25] Jesus said, "I am the life.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; I'm standing before you.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; This is it. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I feel anointing in this place.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; This is the hour that was spoken of
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; where a prophet.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; This is when the head and the body come
[1:33:47] back together.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; This is what creation has been waiting
[1:33:51] for.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; When you and I can come together and
[1:33:55] speak life,
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; prophesy life into some dead bodies.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; My God. I felt that in my spirit.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; She said, "Lord, I know.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; But you got to be careful. I know that
[1:34:21] what I know that you are a Christ, the
[1:34:22] son of the living God."
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Word for word.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; We like to say that word for word.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I know that you are a Christ, the son of
[1:34:30] the living God. Yeah.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And whatever you ask God now, he will
[1:34:34] give it to you.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Beautiful quotes.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Said beautifully.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; She couldn't set it nor away.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And Jesus right now, praise be to God.
[1:34:44] He and Jesus went up and said, "Okay,
[1:34:46] show me where you lay." Because people
[1:34:49] were gathering around and mourning and
[1:34:50] comforting the family. And Jesus said,
[1:34:53] "Show me where you laid him or move the
[1:34:56] stone." Yeah,
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; she was the first to But you just said
[1:35:00] whatever you ask of Father.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever you ask of Father,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; he will give it.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You see how easy for us to sing the song
[1:35:13] to believe.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; And when the time come for us to
[1:35:16] manifest that belief,
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; oh, we are stepping back.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints of God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pump the word in action.
[1:35:27] Move the stone.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Move the stone. Let the resurrection
[1:35:33] work.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Move the stone. Let the world that
[1:35:37] become flesh works.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Move the stone. Let life come forth.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Oh master. He's a rubbish stick. It's
[1:35:45] four days. Oh God. Jesus said, "Ah,
[1:35:48] didn't I tell you to believe it?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; You were standing there. You're a living
[1:35:53] thing. And I said if you amen can just
[1:35:57] believe you will see the glory of God.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Glory
[1:36:03] to
[1:36:04] God.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Can I say this to respect your love?
[1:36:07] It's my heart.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; But God never sent a prophet down to her
[1:36:10] to make churches.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; No. God God sent an anointed prophet
[1:36:19] Elijah
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; to bring back the word to us
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; to restore life.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; You remember what the prophet said? He
[1:36:29] said, "You are an Adam."
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Before we fell.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; What's that mean?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm a praise. I'm
[1:36:36] right.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; And the first thing they ask, how long
[1:36:39] you being in the message? Oh, I'm in the
[1:36:40] message 50 years.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm in it longer than you.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I'm in the message. 80 oh
[1:36:49] 80 years I mean you're supposed to be
[1:36:51] whole. I don't want to be holding this
[1:36:52] message.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to age in the message.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; I want to understand it so much.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God that I can take the God of
[1:37:01] history.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Bring him in the present tense.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; I want the God that stood there. Amen. I
[1:37:11] reading the prophet says he should I
[1:37:13] know I left the pocket knife on the
[1:37:16] table in the hotel room. But if I
[1:37:19] believe so much that knife can be in my
[1:37:23] pocket.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; If I believe I believe that knife can be
[1:37:30] in my pocket now.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm bringing on this.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Is that right, brother?
[1:37:38] Yeah,
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; that's what I'm believing.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm talking about.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; That's the God said, "How many
[1:37:46] scriptures you want?"
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God says, "Speak what you
[1:37:50] want."
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Sister, that's the right word. Ask what
[1:37:55] you will right now.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Sister, ask what you will because she

[1:38:23] and stand on your feet and worship God
[1:38:27] that my daughter is coming back. My son

[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Didn't I say to you, if you could just
[1:38:59] believe,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Your belief can bring
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; the glory of God
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; in your presence.

[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking the pillar of fire.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; I don't talk a cloud coming here
[1:39:26] tonight.
[1:39:27] I'm talking about the manifestation
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; of the character, the presence
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; of God's power
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; coming in action,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; the revelation of God's inherent
[1:39:40] nature,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; operating in us.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I am the
[1:39:46] resurrection,"
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; he never just said it. He manifested it.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; When he said, "I am the light,"
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; he manifested it.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. I am the life. He
[1:39:58] manifested it.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I am the truth. He expressed it.

[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; David wouldn't say that.

[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; To live."
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; But I shall live to declare the works of

[1:46:41] Modi said to Esther, "How do you know
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; that you weren't placed in the kingdom
[1:46:48] for this purpose?"
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?

[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. David,
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; you get what I'm saying?

[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; It was revealed to him who he was
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; and his purpose. Yeah.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You cannot know your purpose until you
[1:47:12] know who you are.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; And when you know who you are, then
[1:47:15] you're going to know where you came
[1:47:16] from.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And when you know where you came from,
[1:47:20] nothing stop you from knowing where

[1:47:35] stop you from knowing where you're
[1:47:36] going. And when you're going, then you
[1:47:39] can dance through the valley of the
[1:47:40] shadow of death.

[1:47:59] Then you can bounce your way. Glory to
[1:48:02] God. And he says, he's round and he's
[1:48:04] strong. He's comforting me. Pray.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; David said, "I shall not die now because
[1:48:16] I've got works to declare."
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You still believe it.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:49:13] go through the worst things, disgraceful
[1:49:15] things
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; in your life
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; that you did.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; It was a part of your process.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Part of your process.

[1:49:45] a bride. No. God don't need to do that.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; What God is doing is manifesting himself
[1:49:50] to his people.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; You understand that? Yes.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing can defi defy the purpose of God
[1:49:57] in your life.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop the purpose. Now, if
[1:50:04] you notice, brother David praying and
[1:50:06] and this jumped out at me.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Brother David praying, a backsliding
[1:50:10] king. And David was anointed. He was a
[1:50:12] man of the God's own heart.

[1:50:31] and done this evil in thy sight that
[1:50:32] thou may be justified when you speak.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; He should order that.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; But here is David in verse 11. David
[1:50:40] says, "Please
[1:50:43] cast me not away from your presence.
[1:50:48] cast me away from your presence
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; and take not thy holy spirit from me.

[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take not your holy spirit
[1:51:05] from me.

[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; That the bound which are broken may
[1:51:14] rejoice. Yeah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Then will I teach transgressors thy
[1:51:18] ways.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
