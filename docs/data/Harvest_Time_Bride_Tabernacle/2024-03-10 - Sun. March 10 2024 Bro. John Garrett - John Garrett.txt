Shel I I counted a a privilege and an honor to to be with you all [Music] today um you know when I say that you know like you know people say things and they say it because they're supposed to say it you know it's kind of expected but I mean it there's there to be among God's people is just one of the greatest places that we can be and um you know there's there's no big eyes and and little 's or or anything like that we're all in this together and uh it is my privilege to be here it's an honor to stand before you today and um I just want to take a little thought today and uh I pray that you'll bear with me on it I I I spent a lot of time on on on this message and then I was re reading through my notes last night and I realized I could probably say everything I want to say in about five minutes so that made me a little nervous because when you spend hours and hours working on something only to find out that you only have couple minutes worth of of things to say that that tends to make a a a minister just a little nervous so you bear with me and um I'm sure that the Lord has good things in store for us um if you'll turn with me in the word of God to the Book of John the Gospel of John chapter 17 and just say Amen when you're there 17:14 we're just going to read a couple of scriptures amen John 17:14 the word of the Lord I have given them my Thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world so catch catch that we didn't come from here this is not our home the same place that Jesus came from is the same place that we come from amen and he says I pray not that that that you should take them out of the world but that you should keep them from Evil and so he knew what we would face what we would endure and then he says it again just to drive the point home for us they are not of the world even as I am not of the world Amen let's bow our heads together one more time gracious Lord we're so grateful to to be in your house and we're just so blessed by your presence already from the the songs of your omnipotent unfailing Grace the the love that you have for us we're just washed in it we we bask in your love and in your mercy and in your grace who are you who are we that you our King should die for us it's un unfathomable and we thank you Lord and as we we turn to your word father I just pray that you would help me to get out of the way and that your people would would be blessed beyond measure as blessed as I am to be here I pray that they are blessed in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you all can have your your seats this morning and um I have I have a lot of scriptures uh this morning to read and I I won't expect you all to turn to them or anything like that but um so just just kind of warn you a little bit I'm going to go to the Book of Joshua and read another scripture here in just a moment but before I do I want to capitalize on this last line in John Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth and thy word is true in the Book of Joshua in chapter 3 it says Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from chatim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord which is the word of God when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest of the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and you shall go after it whenever the word is moving we have to go after it amen he goes on and just he says yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not unto near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way here to for and we're there we're in this Rapture cycle we've not gone this way before we don't have examples to look back to we're in a in a new thing that God is doing and Joshua said to the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you amen I I I guess before I get started let me just preach my whole sermon and in just a couple minutes and then and then I'll I'll backfill everything with with scriptures um the first point that I'd like to make is that the altar of God the true altar of God is in our hearts within us brother brandom said that amen it's it's not here it's not a physical place it's within our heart Hearts amen secondly that our hearts must be Sanctified and set apart and I'm not I'm not going to preach today some fiery Evangelistic message that you have to you know cast out the sin and you know hold your feet over the fires of hell I'm not when I talk about sanctification this morning I'm talking about being set aside for the purposes of God because we all have things that we deal with we all have things we're encumbered with um faults that we're ashamed of things that we we struggle to overcome I'm not here to to pull you out of that we'll leave that for the Evangelist that comes behind me and and the pastor but I want to talk about setting things aside for God in our heart amen and then the third and last point is that every altar every altar is about sacrifice the altar in our heart is about sacrifice and sacrifice speaks to one thing it is the shedding of blood to reunite us with a god from whom we were alienated because sacrifice is that that that substitution for us for our sins and it was always about redeeming us back to to the Lord it was never about anything else is always closing the gap between us and him so that's my entire sermon so now that we're done maybe we should just stand up and praise the Lord so but I appreciate your attention as we go through some of this and I pray it'll be a blessing to you as we go and like I said you know I'm I'm just a little bit nervous so you you give me just a little bit of Grace and um you know I'm just sitting here thinking you know we're here in this beautiful church and we we've been coming now and visiting for about 10 years almost 10 years and I look out and I see your faces and you know some we we grown up a little bit together you know uh gained a little bit of weight here and there lost some hair maybe I got some I gained some hair um but you know we're just I look out and I see your faces and uh I'm blessed I'm blessed I'm blessed to see new faces and old faces to see the children growing up and participating it's just such a wonderful thing and uh we're going to spend ET turn with you together one day amen so to be Sanctified means to be set apart for use to set something from the ordinary day-to-day things and use it for a specific purpose it must be set aside we we when we sanctify something it's it's it's going to be used for a specific purpose that we've designated it for you know you you don't go in and and wash a a a nice crystal glass or or something like that and then you know it's it's all good and clean and then you go out and start you know pouring water to the Hogs with it you know it's it's set aside for a special purpose amen we sanctify our churches we're we're fortunate enough here you know in other countries they're not that we sanctify this this portion of the church for God's use we don't come in here and and we're not eating and talking loudly and fellowshipping and just being disrespectful you know we're we come in and we sit down because this is a a Sanctified set aart place it's for the worship of God it's for the the word to come forth and we're grateful to have it that way and we don't come in here and and uh you know play Bingo like some Churches do we don't come in here and and just have parties and rry this is this is a Sanctified set aart room amen we talk quietly and we we you know respect the place that we're in and so just as I've said we must sanctify our heart as well that that our heart must be set aside and I want to I want to remind you for just a a few moments of how important the heart is because I think one of the most when when people refer to the heart one of the things that I hear the most and I'm reminded of the most and and is that the heart is deceitfully wicked and who can know it and and we always tell that to our children when they're they're dating you know and looking after someone they're like oh I just you know I feel this way towards them and I'm in love and and and it's like just hold on you know we tell them your heart doesn't need to guide you in this necessarily you know let's let's wait and see if those feelings are true and I you know that's the way I've kind of approached but now I I was speaking to the Lord and and you know this this thought came to me but that's not the case when we're filled with the Holy Ghost when we're filled with the Holy Ghost we can trust our heart we can trust it it's not deceitfully Wicked amen it's it's the altar of God and so by the grace of God this morning I want to prove that to you and how important this altar is and why we must set it apart Amen brother brandom said as uh in the re the book of or the sermon Revelations he said here's the true altar of God is in the heart of man so I'm not I'm not just making that up or just not something I thought this this came to me and it's just it's so true true the true altar of God is in the heart of man and you know we might have altar calls and and we might you know people might come up to the front you know I I think the Methodist might have started that you know but there was never that that was never a thing until you know maybe a couple hundred years ago and you know I might stand here or the pastor or the preacher and you know we might have this Focus right here right now but inside your heart is where it's important inside your heart is where our focus should be on this Altar and so I guess if I would title this anything this morning it would be sanctify your altar sanctify your altar because we haven't passed this way here to for we're we look towards heaven expecting a Rapture because we're in the Rapture season and we've seen the sign of the Resurrection the four Runner of his return and and we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that we are in the the resurrection cycle the Rapture cycle that any day we could we could just take a step towards eternity and and we speed up and they slow down and we'll meet just over the doorpost and we have to believe that we have to have faith L we become like the the one said the Lord delays is coming and so they're not watching and waiting and so we have to always have this on our mind always have this in our hearts that we're walking we're walking together somewhere with a purpose amen we're not just walking in this world casually even though God didn't take us out of this world Jesus in fact said don't remove them from the world keep keep them here just keep them from Evil and so we're walking and we always need we need to have this in our mind that we are walking with a purpose with a goal that we are set aside people we're not we're not just here ordinary people that are just floating around you know aimlessly in life you know seeking after material Goods or or things like that that we're here for a called and set aside purpose we're Kings and Priests of God Amen and if I think if there's ever been a time where we should focus on sanctifying ourselves that that time is now and I don't mean that in a way like I said of condemnation or or you know shouting repent repent repent I mean that in this season where we know there's going to be a catching away that we need to lay all of ourselves on the altar in our heart we need to put everything in the right place that our minds are focused on the right things because it's so easy to be consumed with the things of this life you know all of none of us are immune from this world because we we see the news and we we read the papers and we we see the things that are happening in our countries and around the world and we're we're disturbed by it and we we were talking last night and and just to kind of like tell myself you know uh you know if I start feeding on things too much you know if I feed on it too much then it's I become consumed by it amen and so um even even so you know I have a full-time job I'm active duty military on top of that I I go to school for I'm I'm going for my masters right now and I just have a couple more classes left on top of that I also uh do an internship about 70 to 80 hours a month uh to to gain hours towards my certification on top of that I Minister here and there once in a while on top of that I have my family and so there's not enough hours in a day and I have to and so like I always tell you this that I'm not preaching to you so much as I'm preaching to myself amen so don't you know and I I I don't ever think you know if I got if I got one finger pointed at you and and you think I'm stepping on your toes I got three more pointing back at me cuz this this is this is a word of God for me just as much as it is for you because I can get too consumed by things I can get too focused on things and and things start to bother me and they bother my spirit you know and and we're living in a day that that I don't think that many could have foretold was coming that we you know like when you think about it'll it shall be as the days you know in Sodom and Gomorrah it's hard to believe that Sodom and Gomorrah was like this I mean when I think about it we're living in a time uh just like the the Fable uh the the emperor's clothes you remember that Fable from from being a child yeah you know so like if you've never heard it you know it's a story that that this these two raps gillions uh uh they come and they they basically they Swindle the king you know he gives them money and and they say that they're they're making certain clothes for him you know the most beautiful things and they're so they're so high tech and so highend that they're invisible you can't even see them they're so great and so they you know they in the story you know the whole time they're acting like they're sewing and everything you know measuring them out yep yep y this oh this is beautiful you know and and so then the King goes that you know on a parade and he's wearing his his new clothes and a little boy stands up and says he's naked and and I and I think about that and I H I have to be careful because I I I know that we're we're governments are in control of many things and sometimes you can say things and that governments don't like and people don't like but we're living in a time where in all this gender stuff it's the emperor's new clothes and they're trying to Gaslight people like you and I to believe that oh they're not naked they're not naked they're just they're fine they've got the new clothes going on for them and I'm sitting here waiting for some point for people to just Rise Up and Scream no you're naked amen you're you're not what you say you are and I and I am not going to participate in your delusions I'm not going to enable your mental disease the emperor is naked the Lord said unto Moses in in Exodus go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all people upon Mount Si on the third day notice how that's the same thing as Joshua go and sanctify yourselves because on the third day as soon as you see the ark moving get up and get after Moses sanctify herself for on the third day God is going to speak and in this sanctification that was like a a physical act that they had to do you know they had to clean themselves up wash their clothes they had to physically prepare the sanctification and it was it was an acknowledgment then that that they were being set apart that something was happening now that was different than the couple days before and it was in preparation for something new because they had not gone this way here to for amen and I believe that we're in the the cycle of the Third Exodus that we're in the the third day as it was that that God has descended and we hear his voice speaking to us and we have to be ready we have to be set aside we have to be cleaned we have to be anointed Amen brother brandom says I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do Jes have we followed every iota of scripture have we give him our hearts and lives to service wow I I I I read that and I hear that and I think of the The Prostitute that they brought before Jesus for stoning he goes on and he says what's the reason you want to be healed and he says this he says that's the reason you can't get Faith enough see because maybe you haven't made this thing sincerely to God in your heart and he goes on to in that in that message he goes on to talk about Hezekiah and how he when he came time for him to be taken how he begged God for more years so he could do things for God's purpose and brother brandom here is is saying that we have to have our requests for God to intervene have to come from the right place amen there's a lot of people who preach things like Prosperity doctrines you know God owns the that the cattle on a thousand hills and we want some of that you know but we have to ask from the right place we have to ask from a a heart that's right with God and and I and so like I I'm just building a foundation here as I talk about this the altar of our hearts to get to where I want to go so just bear with me and so there's a couple more verses that I would like to read to you in Exodus 40 Moses says and uh or God says this to Moses rather and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels and sanctify the altar see the anointing wasn't the sanctification follow with me the O the anointing was something different than being Sanctified and it says sanctify The Altar and it shall be an altar Most Holy an altar Most Holy that's that's that's this is what I want us to see is that this is our heart that it must that we must clean it up it must be anointed it must be Sanctified and set apart for the purposes of God because we're Kings and Priests to him and when we we talk about anointing you know if you look at it through scripture you the first place I think is actually mentioned is when Jacob has the the dream and he you know you know the story he lays his head upon the rock and and he begins to sleep and he has this dream or vision of of angels going up and down a ladder or a Stairway to Heaven and he when he woke up this that morning he he anointed he poured something out onto the rock you know a bit of oil or or whatever it was but he anointed that place and said it was set apart and holy because of what have happened there and we what I want you to see is that that when you when you anoint something you are pouring something out onto it you're giving something of yourselves onto the altar all right so when I when I if I was to anoint you know this this if this was the Altar and I was anointing it I would take some oil maybe perhaps and I would pour oil upon the altar when David was anointed king before he was ever made King what did they do the the the prophet poured oil upon him to anoint him and so it was a transfer then of something of mine to the altar okay this bear with me bear with me I promise you I'm getting somewhere with this and so this transfer brother brandham says that all that was in God was in Jesus and all that was in Jesus was poured into his church and so we are an anointed people and when God told Moses to anoint the Altar and the vessels and sanctify the altar it it was the Act of of pouring out something upon the Altar and the vessels and setting them aside to be used for for a a designated purpose it wasn't just to be you know sacrifice one day and a dinner table the next and you know a card game played on it was it was everything was set aside for purpose those vessels didn't you know go to the campfire and and and mother didn't cook you know dinner with the vessels that had been anointed is set aside and so how can God anoint this altar in our heart how does he anoint it he pours out his own self onto the altar of our heart his Spirit his blood is poured out for us this anointing it's a transfer something of his onto us it's not just some pressed oil it's not just you know like some anointing oil you know made with a formula it's the literal part of God poured out onto you pour that onto the altar of your heart where he wants to be and I'm I'm still building a foundation here for I'm building a foundation for the for the last five minutes of what I'll say to you the whole this whole thing is just Foundation sanctify The Altar and it shall be an altar most holy and that's the whole thing that's really the whole thing that this altar within us is set aside for a holy purpose that that we're we're not consumed by the things of the world we're not consumed by the things that have fears and anxieties and doubts we're not consumed with business we're not consumed with education we're not consumed with with making uh you know something of ourselves I told you I'm preaching to myself Solomon was a a pretty wise man and he he gave us many teachings and I want to I want to go through some of these and and read some scripture and some quotes as I go in one in one place in Proverbs and 23 he says my son give me your heart and let your eyes observe my ways because the heart's important and God said that that's where the true altar is and and see Satan goes after the eyes and God goes after the heart so you know like you think back to to the garden and and Eve in the Sin it the first thing that it says is that she looked upon the the the fruit she looked upon the tree and saw that it was good and pleasing to the eyes and then she began to reason with Satan that oh surely you I should not surely die well that sounds that sounds good and so she started to reason and she looked and Satan always goes after our eyes while God always goes after our heart and is brother random said in looking at the Unseen so is it tonight God wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led by the spirit of God and this is the great fight tonight that Satan took the eye a man's head to control him by his head and God took his heart so what what won Eve over was what she looked at what she's seen she allowed her eyes to to to consume what everything and then she's singularly focused on just one thing and she forgot all the rest of it and so when I told you earlier that we need to trust our heart I truly mean it if God is there in our heart we can trust it we can trust it we need to trust it because that's the control tower you know we we come here and in our hearts burn within us you know as we're worshiping as we're praising God and we're creating an atmosphere and you know the angels of God you know as I stepped out here onto the platform this morning you know I just walked into the presence of God you know the the Angels love this presence you know the the the Angels my angels here your angel is here we're surrounded by a a convocation of angels from directly sent from the Throne of God to be with us and they love this atmosphere you know the atmosphere that we create is not the same atmosphere that is created in heaven no no because we're redeemed Angels were created for worship Angels were created for a purpose to to worship God holy holy holy kados kados kados and we say it we say it because we're redeemed No Angel could ever take your praise I think sometimes that when we praise and we worship God that Heaven Must Fall quiet as God listens to the worship of his people and he those those thanksgivings and those that love that we EX toward him and how much we appreciate him and his grace and his Mercy as it as it ascends to heaven like a like like a a prayer almost and it goes to heaven and I can imagine that the Angels just go quiet there's the Believers in Wyoming there's the Believers in India Pakistan all over the world Africa Congo Sudan and God just bathes in it that his children love him amen and I believe that that those angels are here brother brandham said to energize your faith that they they're they're they're standing by they're just they're wanting to to help you amen they're wanting to with their presence and their their their position to coax you into things and to ask for things that you think are impossible to to raise your faith up and and and to be around you Amen brother Brandon went on to say man's always trying to achieve something by his head amen boy I'm guilty of doing that you know a lot of times we we we make decisions and we do things thinking with our head before we can can even give our hearts time to to think about it and brother Bram says you know man he's supposed to achieve things but we're supposed to achieve things by his heart and that's the control tower where God controls him and directs his thoughts directs his walk directs his emotions and so God wants to direct us God W wants us to accomplish things he he doesn't want us to be lazy and not do anything he doesn't want us to be lazy and just wait for people to to give us food or or you know to for the government to provide you know everything that we have need of that we're we're able to to to work and and and work towards the purpose of God and and so I believe that when God we when we have our altar clear and we're we're led by the spirit of God that we can do great things for God and it doesn't matter what our what our position is whether we're a housewife or a [Music] farmer an engineer a doctor it doesn't matter who you are you know I find it strange sometimes I find it strange that people look down on other things people look down on other occupations and I really just I I I don't understand that um many times when I've when I've ministered you know I've said this you know that that guys when we get together the first thing we do is we start asking one another what they do for work oh what are you you know and sometimes and we just sort of naturally fall into this ranking oh well you're a doctor wow wow praise the Lord that took a lot of Education you know and and this guy you know I'm just a janitor you know just a janitor I remember one time I was talking to a a a psychologist over dinner and um she was a Jewish Jewish lady we were out to to dinner with with a a good friend of ours and they were roommates so she came to dinner and I was talking she you know she was telling me about uh her education and things like that and she says oh you know what do you do and at that time I was I was working for General Motors and I said you know why I'm just a factory worker and she said just a factory worker just and that stuck with me for the until until this day that that no matter what you do you're important that you have a role that you play amen and some of us are not called to be doctors and lawyers or some great somebody some of us are just called to be simple people janitors you know and and I wouldn't be ashamed of that I wouldn't be ashamed you know if if God if God LED my life and put my life in such a way that every I lost everything and I had to to pull a a lawn put a lawn mower in a wheelbarrow and and walk around the neighborhood mowing yards to provide for my family I would not be ashamed that's not I'm not too good for that I pray I'm never in that position but I'm not too good to do that I'm not too good to take out the trash I'm not too good to pick things up off the side of the road and clean the clean things up we ought not to to have this thought that somebody is higher than another because there's no there are no big ones amongst USL we meet on the same level it doesn't matter whether what what you are we're we're Sons and Daughters of God co-equal we don't come from this world we come as Jesus said from somewhere else amen I believe that God wants to direct us through that inner witness that is on the inside of our heart and so maybe we can we can brother renom said this he said you know says sometimes I can just let loose you know I and just you get so freed up in the spirit of God and then he goes on and says but you know if I look around then I got my eyes on people and so you know the people start distracting the things that we see start distracting us and so you know I wish we could just let loose a little bit today amen and you know if if looking at people and judging people and ranking people are are are being concerned about what other people are doing stumbled brother brandom I'm pretty sure it would stumble us too and it's and so we just need to pull together and unite I believe you know brother we've been friends now for for many years you know brother Dell of if we sat down and we went head to-head or I went head-to-head with I any of you here and we started talking Doctrine and how we believe things we would find all kinds of differences there would be all kinds of things that well I see it a little bit this way I see a little bit that way but you know what it doesn't matter it doesn't matter at all because we're in this together we're friends we're brothers we're brothers and sisters you know and so we we don't we don't approach things and let them divide us you know like when when you have somebody that approaches you and like starts asking you things that will divide you there's something wrong amen a lot of people do that they'll come up and they'll they they want to get your idea what do you think about this what do you think about that and if they're asking from a general you if they're asking from the right place in their heart right like brother brandom said earlier that I read you know uh we're not always asking for the right thing right it's not coming from the right part of our heart people ask things sometimes to cause division to sew seeds of of mistrust and and to kind of like get people on their side of things well you believe it like me brother praise God that person doesn't believe it this way we'll just have to pray for him well that's not on any of my notes anyhow so man is always trying to achieve something by his head and he's supposed to achieve by his heart because God is controlling him and directing his thoughts and directing where he's walking directing his emotions his emotions and I sees you know emotions are are one of the most difficult things for us to control sometimes we get mad about things that we ought not to get mad about we get upset about things that we ought not to to let bother us we get we get fearful about things that we should not be afraid of we we get anxious about things that shouldn't give us anxiety you know young married couples when they they they first get married you know it's supposed to be this they have this honeymoon period you know but then they pretty soon find out you know that that well I I don't see it just exactly like you do you know in my house dad did the dishes and you don't want to do the dishes why aren't you doing the dishes there's something wrong with you and they start getting a little bit upset a little bit angry well my my mother bless her heart she she cooked dinner at this time as she had on the table at this time and every day it was 5:00 and you're not getting the dinner on till 7 something's wrong with you you need to line up to my expectations and they get angry and they get mad at one another and they fuss and they fight fight and they argue and they say things that they ought not ever to say and then they have to you know F find something in themselves to repent a little bit and then they come back together and like well I'm sorry I said this and then I'm sorry I said this I shouldn't have I shouldn't have whereas if God was controlling our emotions we wouldn't fuss and fight with one another we wouldn't we wouldn't argue with little things that really don't matter we would just love one another and we need to let God control us Amen brother brother random goes on and he says you know it's strange for me because I I usually don't read a lot of quotes but I'm reading a lot today I hope that's all right brother Brandon goes on and he says there's a control tower of the soul the heart and one for the body and each Tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other each one calls to to the Need For What the caller is calling for and it sends out a wave of warning for instance the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that are in the soul and then he goes on to say so the flesh wants the things for the flesh we all we all need that there there's things that we perfectly desire that's nothing wrong with my flesh likes to have clean teeth so I brush my teeth unfortunately my My Flesh if I would let it I I I could very easily uh get lost in books and and movies or things like that and entertainment people sometimes tell me I I ought not be so transparent but I I I I can't help it because I'm just a I'm just me I can't be somebody else I can only be me and I I I detest the idea that we so often Place upon the ministry that they're somehow above everything that they've arrived they have no problems you know they have no issues they have nothing they struggle with they have no you know they're just perfect they they're there and they feed us the word of God you know and their lies are just to be envied I am not ashamed to say that that that is a mistaken concept at least for me I have plenty of things that I struggle with plenty of things that I deal with plenty of things I need to change about myself and my flesh wants things that are not good for me amen My Flesh wants donuts donuts there is a donut shop near our house it's actually not near our house but somehow we sometimes make it near our house and they make the best donuts I could and I could just eat them and eat them and eat them and that's not good for my flesh but my spirit desires things for the soul my spirit desires the word of God there is not a day that goes by that I don't listen to the to something of brother brandom I listen to something of the message I might not get through a whole message but there's not a day that goes by that I don't hear 10 minutes 15 minutes or a half hour or something that that that God can speak to me amen because there's something in my soul that cries out and thirst for the Living God Amen and that's what I have to to to lean towards and brother brandom says you know that many times these War one with another amen and I'm still I'm still laying a foundation I'm not off my notes we're we're not till the last 5 minutes yet the spirit and the flesh fight against one another but our our heart our soul has to be set aside for God because if we if we allow other things on the altar of our soul God can't be there faith and fear cannot coexist together amen and so if we allow things to bother us and consume us and consume our thoughts and then then and we put that on the Altar and that's what we're paying attention to God cannot control us God cannot control our Direction and our emotions and our and and help us walk in the paths that he would have for us and so if there's conflict today within you if you if you're if you're mixed and undecided and you you you're consumed by by things that you ought not to be consumed with I pray that the spirit wins out over the flesh today don't let the cares of this life bog you down don't let the worries of of Tomorrow bog you yes we have to think about them we have to we ought not live like uh you know uh the just not thinking about the future we we have to plant our potatoes as if God is not coming for a hundred years or a thousand years you know we have to plant ahead for our children and the Bible says you know a wise man a Godly Man leaves an inheritance for his children's children and I'm still working on that but uh you know there that's where my soul needs to be I need to be focused on the things of God not the things of this world not the things that you know the media wants to feed at us you know and if you watch too much of it you know like they they they guide the the media begins to guide your life they guide your emotions you're supposed to be angry about this you know and they'll just feed it to you 24 hours a day 7 days a week next thing oh you're supposed to be sad about this now be oh nope nope back to being upset about this you know oh be happy here no be sad no be confused what are they doing and they try to control people through their emotions we can't allow ourselves to be consumed by that brother brandom says in the message thirst we find there that what's a great trouble today is that too many people will try to live between those two desires for one of them desires the things of Earth and the other desires the things of heaven and it's so easy to be caught in this war between the Flesh and the spirit it's so easy to be struggle you know which one am I going to allow in my life to take preeminence and many times we can't get what we need we can't get what we ask for because of this struggle and we don't ask from the right place we don't have God on the altar you know we we ask for things you know and blessings and we ask for for all these good things but what's what's driving that you know we can ask God for a brand new car but if we just need want a brand new car because the neighbor got a brand new car Brother D and sister L I drove in their car last night it's a beautiful car it's a beautiful car you know some might say it's the best car best best car there's no cars like it it's a beautiful car and you know just sitting in it man I need a I I need a new car you know and if I was to pray to God to give me a new car you know so I can be like brother Dale you know that probably wouldn't be the right place to be asking for something you see I I'm I'm making I'm making a little bit light but the point is is we have to have the the right motive and objective if we want to if we want a promise of God to come to come and be manifests in our lives we have to have the right motive and objective not only that we have to have the right attitude towards it and I think David in in Psalms he captures this this Unity that we are striving for with the outer man and the inner man he says he says my soul longth yet even fainteth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for the Living God and David I I think David of all people he had a clear understanding uh that that the heart was more important than the Flesh and it was more than just you know and he and back in those days they didn't just believe that the heart was just like some muscle but it was the it was the seat of emotions amen it was it was is where they were passionate from it was the center the the seed of morality it was it was uh um the center of mem morality and it was the they considered the heart to be the most inner part of a man it it was all their feelings all their emotions all their will came from the heart and the you know the the heart possesses enormous capacity for good and for evil and people do amazing things to benefit their fellow man you know they they charity and altruism and and people donate and you know to this cause and that cause you know uh but at the same time people can do very evil things out of their heart and when we talk today that our heart is made for a special purpose that it's in this heart this sacred altar this sacred place where God meets you and unites himself with you I I want to say that it's not done without blood it's not done without sacrifice because we cannot meet God face to face without sacrifice and people can do things you know out of the goodness of their heart or they can do Despicable evil things out of out of the evil in their heart but for a Believer for us to do the things of God from our heart and then let him control us there must be a sacrifice made amen there has to be something poured out upon the Altar and it has to be Sanctified and set apart for God to use it cannot happen without blood and the Heart can no despair the heart can no grief it can be these are all scriptures be bowed down be broken be sorrowful can no bitterness it can be filled with anger and is subject to fear and I think it's interesting that that fear is not called to sin fear is not called a sin Jesus did not say that ever that I found that fear is a sin but the problem is as I said earlier that if sin or I'm sorry if fear is there that faith cannot be be there they are opposites they cannot peacefully coexist you know you can't just you know be worried so much about you know what's coming or what's around you or your next steps in life that you can't have faith to walk in what God has ordained for you amen let me read some scriptures for you just very quickly now as I am I'm almost there and we're very close to would you forgive me if I went just a little more than an hour okay all right so some scripture here in the in the morning Thou shalt say would God it were evening and at even Thou shalt say would God it were morning for the fear of your heart wherewith you shall fear and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see and we look around and we see all these things and our hearts can be a little bit fearful a little bit troubled men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for even the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and that's a lot of fear fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy fear not believe only and she shall be made whole fear not therefore you are of more value than many sparrows and the scripture tells us 365 times fear not so it must be something that we're very prone to and and you notice now that that God comes on the scene and the first thing he says is fear not and and the the reason for that I think a good deal of it is because that faith cannot o exist with fear God God is saying okay I'm here get the fear away get the fear out of your life so that faith can take place and faith can do things so God can do for us what he wants to do because if we're wrapped up in fear we can't believe the angel always told Brother brandham every time when he came fear not and God God knows that our hearts are susceptible to fears and anxieties and I think that if Jesus was here today speaking he would tell you fear not fear not why why be afraid is is God in control amen is God bigger than your problems is has God ever failed you is does has God ever not had the answer you Lord has God ever not run to you when you were estranged from him when you were backslid and has God not ever found you wherever you were at and brought you back has God ever not restored you has God not ever as he has he ever felt it's impossible possible in the Book of Revelations it says when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more and I have the keys of hell and death thank you Jesus amen hallelujah and last but certainly not least fear not little clock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom but I want you to to make crystal clear fear not if you have fear God cannot work in your life like he wants toall we must fear not in in the sermon testimony brother randam says amen we have a hope today we can have faith today because the one who tells us I am the first and I am the last is also everything in the middle he was with you when he forms you in your mother's womb he will be with you when you take your last breath he is with you now he knows exactly what you are going through where your footsteps have been where they will go and he knows exactly where you stand today he is interested in every part of your life and he is concerned about every part of your life and he wants to move on every part of your life that's my God that's my God he knows where I've been he knows where I'm at right now he knows where I'm going and he holds it all in the palm of his hand there's no reason that I should have fear there's no reason that I should have worry or anxiety or doubts or or concerns that he can't do anything for me that he somehow he will he's not going to show up on time you know in this situation you know is he's not going to he's not going to answer my prayer on time that he's just going to leave me hanging that's not the God I serve the God I serve knows exactly where I stand he he knows he knows what what I'm concerned about and he's concerned about it with me every part of my life God is is involved with if I let him be involved if I let him be in the control tower he'll control my life and he'll control your life it says my heart was hot within me while I was musing the fire burned then spake I with my tongue our hearts have to burn within us with the fire of God while he was thinking about it while he was thinking about the things of God while I I was musing means while I was pondering while I was meditating that's right the fire burned within me the fire cleansed me the altar of my heart I'm reminded of Isaiah in the and and he's there in the courts of God in this other dimension and the angel comes and touches the coals of fire onto his lips now go and speak now go and I just pray that God father burn out everything within me that is not like you every doubt that I may have every question that I may have God burn it out of me in another place David writes we know the song create in me a clean heart and I think many times we we might sing a song like that as we do many times we're just saying saying the words but when you think about what David was actually writing create in me a clean heart oh God created in me clean clean Sanctified what did they do they they cleansed the altar they cleaned they cleaned up they washed their clothes clean a clean heart and renew a right Spirit Within Me renew a right mental attitude within me that every Divine promise of God will be mine cast me not away from your presence and take not your Holy Spirit from me yes sir and it's interesting in Hebrew this uh restore unto me the joy of thy salvation this this restore renew renew restore is the same thing we read in Malachi 4 that the hearts of the the children that the word will be restored renewed restored back to the faith of the fathers it's the same concept the same idea renew and restore cast me not away from your presence and take not your Holy Spirit from me amen then will I Treach then will I teach transgression transgressors your ways and sinners will be converted not when we're angry and upset it's so hard to witness and testify when you're mixed up yourself when you're a little bit uncertain about things yourself when you have questions and and you don't have the answers we need sometimes we need God to renew a right Spirit within us we can take those doubts and place them on the Altar and the fire of God would burn them amen we must believe this with all our heart brother brandom says over 2,000 times believe with all your heart believe with all your heart that means the entirety that there's no room for doubts there's no room for Fears there's no room for anxieties there's no room to consider the things that are going on around the world that we see we're we not ought to be consumed with the the emperor's clothes that's not us we're not we're not here it shouldn't concern us yes we hate to see the countries go we we we feel bad for these people with mental problems but we're not from here amen we're not of this world even as he is not of this world and I just I I believe that if we could just take the smallest promise of God and believe with all our hearts this morning that Miracles would take place right here if we could just believe with all with all of it and take everything off the Altar and let God anoint our hearts and be in control that that nothing would stand in the way of your prayers this morning I I I believe that that people could be healed miraculously I believe that you could stand up and walk and if you were hurting you would be able to that the pain would leave that the broken bones could be healed that that wounded Hearts could be restored and delivered Hallelujah you know and I just pray I just pray that God may your may your fire fall upon us this day May the fire of your word just consume us consume everything off the altar that that that every bit of my heart will be consumed by faith in your word that Lord that that I I just pray you know this is my prayer is renew a right Spirit Within Me restore unto me the joy of your salvation take not your Holy Spirit for me God move in this church move in each person's life from the youngest to the oldest I'm I'm praying and battling for you and if we could just take just the smallest promise and believe it'll come to pass you wouldn't need to be prayed for you wouldn't need to come up here and be anointed you wouldn't need to to have hands laid upon you you could just sit there in your seat in the altar of your heart and it would happen it'll happen just like that it's not impossible you know and I believe you know brother Dell mentioned it referen it earlier I think you know that the prophet was here and he would look out across the room that he would see a milky white Haze of faith in this room that things would just BEC coming milky white as people reach out in faith to God and the angels just gathering around just just ushering you just a little bit closer to the presence of God that nothing would stand in your way nothing would would keep you from receiving that people would be uh just delivered from whatever it is that's oppressing you that there would be a a cry of Praise a jubilee trumpet of freedom amen is God here amen he's always been here and he'll do for you what needs to be done today all your heart holding nothing back from him all of your heart giv over entirely to him amen if are you B are you in the middle of a battle give it to God God will deliver you right now right now you don't need to wait for for the close of the service you don't need to wait for anything you can be delivered right now if you only believe only believe all things are possible all things are given to you whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth shall be loose on in heaven and I I pray I loose God loose dear father the the the healing power of your deliverance for us this morning and we bind every spirit everything that would come against the believer this morning we bind it in the name of Jesus Christ and we saw Satan let the people go let them go that they may worship their God Amen it can't be just a mental conception an uh an educated understanding we have way too much of that we have way too much but it has to be in our heart Hearts our hearts on the road to emus they said did not our hearts burn within us yes as he talked with us along the way is God talking to you this morning is he speaking to your heart our hearts burned within us as he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and see I'm just trying to do what Jesus did I'm just trying to to open the scriptures for you a little bit let's talk about the things of God come let us reason together though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as wool May the power of God deliver you and I'll tell you what's on my altar what I what I earnestly pray for is that I can do his Good Will amen that that the that what's been said over me and prophesied about me will come to pass that God's word will accomplish what he has spoken in my life every bit of it because God doesn't send his word out and not accomplish what he's intended amen his word spoken before the foundation of the world is going and going and going until it meets the place where it's to come to pass and be made manifest amen I pray that God I pray that that his spirit will be so present Among Us that Miracles would happen that depression would flee anxiety would flee that God would move on your situation and I believe it I believe you standing here right now to deliver you all you have to do is reach out and touch the Lord as he walks by grab a hold of the Hem of His Garment and say God I believe with all my heart amen now let me get to the five minutes of my sermon now I want you to consider this I've been building this Foundation now for quite a while much longer than I normally go so give me five minutes and and give me your attention now than you Lord I want you to consider this altar that when we hear the term altar we have to connect it to sacrifice and we cannot say sacrifice without something being offered something being given and something has to be placed on the Altar and sacrificed offered to God and the first the first instance we see of sacrifice was in the garden when when God himself Jehovah came down and sacrificed Lambs in the garden to cover the sins of his children amen there the Fig Lees were not enough to cover them yeah they covered them physically but but there had to be blood because the life is in the blood amen the life is in the blood and so the only way that they could be covered was through the shed blood a life because they were guilty they were they were worthy of death and so a life had to be taken to pay for that Amen to cover it and brother brandom talks about this this moment in time and and I love I love how he says is just is so po poetic you know that that as they they walked out of the garden you know covered by these animal skins the blood still dripping down their legs and and the the agony the regret that they were going through brother random said they they never knew tears before they cried as they walked out of the garden that day with blood dripping down them and they they went out of the garden and they they started to build this life and as I just move quickly now how how did Abel know that a blood sacrifice would please God how how did Abel know both Cain and Abel went to the same church they sat on the same Pew they heard the same message and and fundamentally let me put it this way they were both they were both uh farmers of a type but fundamentally Cain was actually more in line with what with the word of God as a farmer tilling the soil and bringing forth fruit and vegetables and herbs than Cain was because the curse was you shall go and and by the sweat of your brow bring forth food and Toil and thorns so Cain was fundamentally correct you know and I kind of imagine you know that they they they walked to the the Gate of the garden that day you know in unity and in harmony you know their arms are around one another and and Cain probably you know had a nice bushel basket of of fruits and things like that upon him you know just carrying it and and Abel was sitting there leading a lamb and and they probably went together and they they saw the the the entrance to the garden and and the the sword of the the Flaming sword of the cherubim guarding the way and they they began to offer their worship and their sacrifice Cain you know laid everything out very beautifully and you know Lord this is uh you know thank you for giving this to me thank you for this Harvest you know and I just offer it back to you but Abel Abel had something within him that said sh blood blood because it spoke of the sin but more than that more than that and I I I want you to to really see this now is God had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world in his mind and I I I I don't pretend to know exactly what that looked like in heaven I don't I kind of I don't really think that it was just blood and you know just up there in heaven but whatever it was whatever it was God had an image in his mind something that would would play out throughout the the course of time uh to to get to a certain spot and so when Abel somehow caught a vision of that somehow caught a revelation of that and sacrificed it God had to honor it because it spoke to the sin it spoke to what was in heaven it represented God's Vision before the foundation of the world and so God honored it because this this this word that he had spoken was becoming manifest amen the word that he had spoken in eternity that this is what my plan is and this is what it's going to be was now becoming in it being happening in flesh and it was being mimicked and replicated that this idea of sacrifice of blood and it wasn't the chemistry of the blood it wasn't you know anything about that but it was I think I really believe that it was just this playing out out of what was in God's mind and so he had to honor it amen it spoke of the sin of his parents being of blood sin and it spoke of what was in heaven and it spoke of the word of God coming from eternity and creating a life that would one day be sacrificed to cover all sin for all time and that blood was on the Altar and it was a product of the word of God you the the lamb that a that that Abel slew was a product of the word of God God said to every every beast of the field to bring forth after their own kind so that's God's word still in effect today that we see that's just just you just doesn't happen but that's that's God's word being fulfilled do you see it's just very simply it's God's word being fulfilled amen and so it was God's word when Abel slew that lamb it was God's word echoing then from the sixth day of creation that everything shall produce after its own kind hold on hold on to what I'm saying here I I I I I don't know that you're with me God word has to go forth until it has accomplished his purpose and until that word was made flesh and caused the man Jesus to do everything the father will and intended everything thing prophesied about him that word was just kind of just there waiting to be fulfilled I think the last time I was here I mentioned you know how how God spoke a word that there would that there would be a Vicki that there would be a Tim that there there would be a Charles there there would be a Brent and and that God's word was spoken in a time when there was no time and it just hung there until it was supposed to be fulfilled god brother brand now the the position of a believer in Christ but God before the foundation of the world for ordained that Jesus would come the perfect Lamb of God into a perfect cell that God himself created that was a spoken word of God hold hold with me now to bring blood into the world to offer that the blood the blood that houses life and through the tearing down of which was none other than the Holy Ghost himself after that offering of that man after the offering that man can come back and perfect the believer he brought Eternal Redemption I want you to catch out of that that that this created word this created word that God had spoke when the angel came to a young girl 13 14 years old and he and he began to talk to her and and rehearse God's words to her and say the the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you his words were spoken this he was the messenger of God his words were spoken and they just lay there just just hanging there until Mary said be it unto me and the moment she said be it unto me the words became life and became made into flesh and cells began to come together that were created cells began to multiply and a a body began to take shape and see while this was a a human body in human form it was perfectly created by God himself by his word it was it was human in the shape and the form of a human and yes he was a man but it was God's spoken word amen and so that blood was a spoken word in the beginning the word was uh the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in in the beginning with God and the Word was made flesh was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and amen I you know and I just wonder I'm I'm sorry for taking so long here and I'm blabbering this because I want you to be with me and you know and some I I sense a little bit of where's he going where's he getting we'll get there we'll get there I'm just kind of taking my time because I can I can feel that that you know I wonder sometimes if that the Holy Ghost that overshadowed Mary that spirit that surrounded her how much that's like the a woman who gets pregnant and she's pregnant and and all of a sudden she becomes you know more radiant more beautiful and brother Brandon we talk about that because that life is right next to her and I wonder that Holy Ghost just being there that theophany body of Jesus Christ just wa waiting and watching over her amen we can go back and find that before the foundation of the world a lamb was slain and blood was put on The Mercy Seat then God himself sacrificed the Lambs to cover his children Abel sacrificed the lamb to worship God and poured his life out and God tells Moses build an altar and sanctify it put Blood on the altar sprinkle it on the Altar and it's incredible you know if you go through the the Old Testament how much blood played played a role how much sacrifice played a role I think one time there was a king and he offered 30 30,000 animals of sacrifice I don't even know how there could be 30,000 animals for sacrifice in in one country blood everywhere can you imagine how much it must have smelled how awful it was the stench of manure from 30,000 animals in one place just one after the other sacrificed blood everywhere so much so that that we know that they cut channels in the ground at the sacrifice for the blood to run through and run off it didn't it wasn't just like one sacrifice and the blood soaked it into the ground there was so much blood so much blood because man was attempting to to connect with that sacrifice that God knew would come that in their hearts there there was something that they knew that that something great had to be offered to bring reconciliation to bring Redemption to cover the sin and I and I I would say this that I I'll just say it like brother brandom said it that Jesus he crawled up upon his altar on his wooden Altar and his blood was poured out of him he was sacrificed he was just completely stripped of everything and and his blood came pouring out and we were there you know we were there not only were we there in Christ when he he was crucified we were there in the ground every every mineral every atom everything that was needed to make us today was there and God his blood poured out and redeemed the Earth and all that was in it and he he paid the price and the penalty for us just as as people for every person that would accept his sacrifice and and you were there and everything that you you were made of was there and he climbed up on that wooden Altar for you and for me and that altar had to have a sacrifice it could it couldn't just be that you know God Jesus was up there and then came back down it required death and it required the blood his blood acknowledged everything it it acknowledged all the the sacrif IES that have been made from when God sacrificed the first lamb to to Abel to Moses through the the thousands and thousands of animals that were sacrificed Jesus's blood spilled upon the ground acknowledging what had been done but saying you don't have to sacrifice anymore this is the Redemption this is the reconciliation SE this is the reconciliation between God and man it was the spoken word becoming flesh the spoken word became blood it was spilled out upon the ground and it it is still in effect it's still an effect and it doesn't matter who you are or where you came from it doesn't matter what language you speak or what color you are when God looks at you and you believe he sees the blood on your altar so whatever you have need of whatever you have need of you can have it today because the blood has been applied all you have to do is believe the word of God than Lord you see the word is bleeding on your behalf the word has been crucified again in this day but the the original sacrifice is still there for you you know if let me say this you know if if we had just a a vial of the blood of Jesus just sitting here and we knew beyond the shadow of a doubt it had been passed down through the ages and somehow we had a vile of his blood it could do nothing for you all right it could do nothing for you even though the it because it had already accomplished the purpose for which it had been intended and you could put it on you anointed on your face you could put your finger in it it would do nothing for you because everything that you have need of has already been paid for has already been claimed has already been done for you and all you have to do is now accepted you were already healed you were already delivered all that requires for you today is to believe with all your heart and accept it and I believe that you could have anything that you want in his name this morning and that's how he can say that you're the Spotless bride of Jesus Christ because of the blood he his sacrifice brother brandom says this he said if there's no sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received it's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that lets prayers go through to God now think about that and consider it what's on your altar what's on your altar this morning is it faith in the word of God is the blood on your altar or are you too consumed with fear and with life what's what's on your altar this morning why don't you stand with me and we'll just try to close it is essential believe the word of that God has sent and that there's blood on your altar we have to walk when we see the word moving we have to go after it amen as we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin there's no room in this day for fear there's no room today for anxiety there's no room today for for doubt and disbelief and questions and and make believe and make pretend there's no room for this to be just a ritual that we do is the blood on your altar are you giving him full preeminence his son is on my altar his blood is on my Altar and I believe that God is looking at your altar today to see what's there can he hear your prayers Can You Reach Out in faith and claim what you have need of I believe that if you believe whatever you ask will be ranted unto you if you need Deliverance you can be delivered great you know I'm just standing here and I'm just I'm just John I'm just your brother I was praying for for sister Linda last night uh as we went to visit them you know and if I I I prayed you know it's like God if I was a prophet if I had the gift of healing I would raise everyone up that I could raise up if I if I had a measure of that somehow Lord if I could pray for someone and have faith enough on my own to to to believe that you would receive I would be I would do that for you if that if that's what it was required I I just pray that God would would give that to me but it's more important that you have faith of your own to reach out and claim what you have need of you you must must put your faith upon the Altar and cast out all the fear You Must Believe with all your heart and if one thing that that God has taught us in this day and in this hour is only believe only believe all things are possible let's bow our heads as we pray together father I I wish that I had the words to express it perfectly that all the that you put into my heart would would go to the people of God that that it would change their lives that they would that they would be made whole that they would be made well that they would have faith that they would be reconciled completely that that they would hold nothing back from you if I could stand in the Gap Lord if I would I if I if I could lay hands on the sick and they would recover if that's what it took I I help me Lord God to be that man to be that servant but help us all Lord to reach out in faith and claim what you have given us to to to reach out and just only believe to let to let your blood be on the altar of our hearts each one from the youngest to the oldest that that we we would have your blood there in our hearts that you anointed you poured out yourself and you anointed our altar with your blood and you cleansed us and you reconciled as Lord help us to walk into that Vision that you had from the be before the foundation of the world that your spoken word came it died it bled but it's still performing what it it accomplished we just have to claim it we just have to claim it Lord I I pray that you deliver your people Deliver Us Lord from looking at one another and getting our eyes on people and and stumbling ourselves keep our eyes on you create in us a clean heart oh God renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from your presence oh God restore unto me the joy of your salvation and take not your Holy Spirit from me then then I'll pray then I'll convert to sinner don't let there be any room for doubt on my altar God amen amen if you you need to be prayed for this morning I'll pray with you I'll put my faith together with yours and we'll give we'll give God the glory because he'll perform what you have need of the last time I was here sister was praying for something I don't know what she was praying for I stepped away from the pull pit and I stepped away and God told me to go back and tell that sister that what she was praying for was was granted I don't even know what it was but I couldn't get away from that feeling and what a shame it would be if you came in here today in a situation that God could move on your behalf and you walked out the door without allowing him to move on your behalf without reaching out and claiming the healing that you need what a shame [Music] help us Lord From [Music] Me Oh restore to me the joy the joy of thy [Music] salvation and renew and renew aise Spirit within me one more time oh cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord and take not thyo Spirit from me yes Lord restore restore [Music]
