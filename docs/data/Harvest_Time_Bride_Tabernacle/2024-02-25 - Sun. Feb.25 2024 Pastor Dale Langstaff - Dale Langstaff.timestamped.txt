[27:17] hearing
[27:19] name but you and that's you know have to
[27:24] recognize amen
[27:26] San
[27:28] because you know we're in a late hour we
[27:31] are and and
[27:39] uh so God's going to say some things
[27:41] today because of the time that we're in
[27:46] amen and
[27:51] uh and you
[27:53] know in the Bible it's uh it comes as
[27:57] many different things you know sometimes
[28:00] the Bible comes as a sword sometimes it
[28:03] comes as a hammer sometimes it comes as
[28:06] the
[28:08] cloud and it's all in the Bible and so
[28:10] there'll be people today here that'll be
[28:13] pierced By The Sword there'll be people
[28:16] that are beat up by the hammer there'll
[28:18] be people that feel like they're LED on
[28:20] fire by the fire of God and there'll be
[28:23] people that are sitting in the
[28:24] cloud and I have scriptures for every
[28:27] one of those
[28:32] amen you
[28:34] know we were we were out last night with

[29:37] misunderstand God amen amen and and and
[29:41] it's a mystery but it's not a mystery to
[29:44] you but to this Badger skin it's a
[29:47] mystery it's hard to get it through the
[29:49] filter and our Prophet says some very
[29:53] very tremendous things like some things
[29:57] right out of the and just amazing things
[30:01] amen and and we want to be well I want

[30:34] disclaimer and this is a a very uh uh
[30:39] very is I'm not promoting
[30:44] sin this is a no way these messages are
[30:47] promoting sin but we're continuing on
[30:49] the mystery of omnipotent God in
[30:54] election and it it's amazing it's just
[30:59] amazing amen judge not that you be not
[31:02] judged for with what judgment ye judge
[31:05] ye shall be judged and with what measure

[31:26] that's in thine eye and behold the beam
[31:28] is in thine eye thou hypocrite First

[32:21] brother speak as
[32:24] evil of God's law
[32:28] but a
[32:30] judge there is now this is a key part

[34:32] reading the first part of the the
[34:34] scripture just uh to lay the election
[34:38] down you know you know brothers and
[34:40] sisters this is not a

[34:52] amen election according to the for
[34:55] knowledge of God
[34:58] God the
[35:00] Father amen let's turn over to Hebrews
[35:03] 51-14 and I want to lay this scripture
[35:06] down and this is what I want to preach
[35:07] on
[35:09] and and I I I pray in in advance that
[35:13] you you'll somehow be able to forgive me
[35:15] because it's going to look like uh it's
[35:20] going to look
[35:22] like uh you know that the house of God
[35:25] is for many things
[35:27] but it's even for correction for brother
[35:29] Dale so when if it feels like correction
[35:32] remember I'm living in a glass house too
[35:35] and my house got broke when God shared
[35:37] this with
[35:39] me you understand because I had to taste
[35:42] of the man of
[35:44] farce and I'm I'm just one of you amen
[35:48] Hebrews 51 and4 of whom we have many
[35:52] things to say now that's Christ it's not
[35:57] about a

[36:37] of
[36:38] God and are become such as have need of
[36:41] the mou now I'm going to tell you ahead
[36:44] of time Christ is talking about the
[36:46] message of the hour and the prophet's
[36:50] been gone for a
[36:52] generation and it's rate full of
[36:55] babies
[36:57] and have need of the m and not the
[37:01] strong meat for everyone that uses the
[37:05] mou is unskillful in the word and
[37:08] unrighteous they're not even converted
[37:11] for he is a bab but the meat belongeth
[37:14] to them that are of full age even those
[37:17] by reason of the use have their
[37:21] senses their

[37:34] that when when the the preaching Goes
[37:36] Forth this morning I I know you can I
[37:39] know you can because I know you're part
[37:41] of him that your sense your Holy Ghost
[37:45] would
[37:46] discern what Christ is trying to say
[37:50] through just a piece of
[37:52] clay amen amen this is powerful stuff
[37:56] now you know the prophet said in this
[37:58] this Hebrews verses here he mentions the
[38:02] quotes on the message
[38:03] Hub about 10 times but some of the
[38:06] direct V quotes the one direct verse he
[38:09] mentions seven times and this is also
[38:12] wrote in 1 Corinthians 3 1-9 talking
[38:16] about the
[38:18] babes and don't don't let this offend
[38:21] you but I just have to be truthful in 1
[38:24] Corinthians 3 it was the B
[38:27] because they had the doctrine of
[38:30] following different
[38:34] men including
[38:37] prophets said some of you follow
[38:40] Paul some follow paulus some go to this
[38:44] camp meeting praise God and somebody go
[38:47] to this camp meeting because he's got a
[38:48] plaid t-shirt and some go to this one
[38:53] and that one but in that scripture
[38:58] I understand very clearly then we you
[38:59] haven't read it that it says that
[39:03] God that's
[39:05] Jehovah is the only one that gives the
[39:09] increase he's the lawgiver he's the
[39:13] judge he's the only one that can give
[39:15] life or death and there's a whole bunch
[39:18] of people that are planting seeds and
[39:19] watering seeds and running the combine
[39:23] but there's only one
[39:24] person but put the jour
[39:27] a seed in
[39:30] election amen hallelujah here hearing
[39:33] the prophet said
[39:36] uh in Divine Healing here in a quote
[39:40] directly attached to this Hebrew
[39:41] scripture he said now you'll notice
[39:43] people they can't they they can sit and
[39:46] say well I accept the message I changed
[39:49] that quote he said I accept the Lord and
[39:51] he said you take your word for it and I
[39:53] would too and I can't judge them
[39:57] God does that but in 10 years later from
[40:00] now now make this personal this is the
[40:03] message but in 70 years later after all
[40:07] the greatest preachers in the world
[40:08] preaching the
[40:11] message they haven't grown
[40:15] any he says but in 10 years from now
[40:18] they've never processed a bit just
[40:21] staying right exactly the same place
[40:23] they were 10 years
[40:25] earlier when the prophet went off the
[40:27] scene amen watch this he said you know
[40:30] you grow daily and your heart hungers in
[40:33] your natural for food and he said
[40:35] there's something growing there there's
[40:38] the wife again it's everywhere he said
[40:40] there's something growing inside of you
[40:43] see when you have something inside of
[40:44] you it dictates who you are
[40:48] amen and we have clearly made the this
[40:51] this uh Doctrine in our church or I have
[40:54] at least that if you're not the wife
[40:56] here today of Christ you're not going to
[40:59] Glory CU he don't know you that's just
[41:03] Bible amen and there's multiple
[41:05] scriptures for that but here if we look
[41:07] at another one and this is from Hebrews
[41:08] 5:11 the prophet saying in uh uh the
[41:12] Hebrew series okay he said he said you
[41:15] give a baby strong meat and you'll kill
[41:18] it now these quotes are here for
[41:20] everybody to this everything is very
[41:23] wide open he said that's the reason that
[41:25] so many people here today he said oh I
[41:28] don't believe
[41:31] that and they walk
[41:33] away he said still babies he said they
[41:37] just can't
[41:38] understand he said they can't
[41:42] Gras the truth and it kills
[41:46] them he said Great Mighty things the
[41:50] bride should know
[41:52] today but they stumble over it
[41:59] now I'm going to tell you
[42:02] something he said the next paragraph he
[42:05] said the Deep spiritual Mysteries of the
[42:08] Bride the church is still blinded to
[42:12] it now listen we've been here for a long
[42:18] time and brother Dale don't enjoy
[42:20] preaching as much as going in the
[42:23] Rapture hello
[42:27] our goal is to go into
[42:29] Rapture our goal ain't to build a big
[42:31] church I mean if that happens but we
[42:34] want to take them with us you understand
[42:37] our goal ain't to build a gold
[42:40] steeple our goal our one goal is a
[42:43] Rapture amen and so let's let's just
[42:46] look at some things the prophet says and
[42:48] and I and I I apologize CU I never
[42:51] preach serieses that's just that's not
[42:53] who I am but this one is is huge amen
[42:58] and so this is part two of two weeks ago
[43:00] he said here just laying a foundation I
[43:03] mentioned this quote Wednesday night for
[43:04] those that were here he said that's what
[43:07] the matter with a lot of our old cold
[43:09] formal churches today he said they got
[43:12] churches
[43:13] full of rotten
[43:16] eggs now you're I'm going to just tell
[43:19] you and it's fine if you don't agree
[43:20] with me or not it makes no difference to
[43:22] me CU but if you don't believe that
[43:24] you're his wife you're in trouble
[43:26] trouble amen the only thing they are are
[43:30] professors great message preachers I
[43:33] added that and they've never been with
[43:37] the
[43:37] mate that sounds like marriage to
[43:41] me it really does the mate Jesus Christ
[43:45] the only thing to do is to clean it out
[43:49] and to start over again with men and
[43:51] women who's been in contact with the
[43:54] mate Jesus Christ he mentions that again
[43:56] to his bride his church his wife amen
[44:00] and now how true it
[44:03] is how true that it is to see the
[44:06] mainting
[44:07] time now see we have to have this before
[44:10] we go into
[44:11] Rapture this is in 61 this is in uh a
[44:16] message here the fourth month he said he
[44:19] said now see it's the mainting
[44:21] time that sounds like marriage the mate
[44:25] now ought to be the mainting time when
[44:28] the church gets in contact with Christ
[44:32] and gets the real
[44:35] genine baptism of the Holy
[44:38] Ghost and when that happens there'll be
[44:41] things happen in your body that
[44:46] change it amen amen remember remember
[44:51] brother Dale and I hope you're with me
[44:53] and support me in this remember the
[44:55] quote we read about the prophet saying
[44:57] about that he was a minister and he
[44:59] should wear clergy
[45:01] clothes remember that
[45:04] quote and he said did Jesus wear clergy
[45:09] clothes and he said those are just man's
[45:13] ideas I'm just wearing this suit so
[45:16] everybody's happy I'm wearing a suit
[45:19] coat that's not Christ the devil's
[45:22] wearing a coat
[45:24] too you see no there's nothing wrong
[45:27] with the
[45:28] coat but watch the man's ideas and I
[45:32] promise Christ and and my kids can tell
[45:34] you this and brother Jim can way back in
[45:36] the
[45:38] church that we have enough to minister
[45:41] on then we don't need brother Dale's
[45:44] ideas we don't need brother Dale's ideas
[45:46] and this is no offense to you but we
[45:47] don't need your ideas either amen like
[45:51] we're not going to take mine but we're
[45:52] not going to take yours
[45:53] either amen
[45:57] now now brother Nathan mentioned this
[45:59] and I looked this up and and so he
[46:01] mentioned this yesterday he said but I'm
[46:02] going to read it this is a think command
[46:04] filter this is right this is four months
[46:06] before the prophet died he said now the
[46:08] church filter gets the membership and
[46:11] the things like that when they let them
[46:14] get through with everything and still
[46:16] belong to the
[46:18] church and they get more members and
[46:21] what if you want to what what if we want
[46:24] to the church to night and to filter
[46:27] everybody out besides those who were
[46:30] genuinely word born
[46:35] Christians brother Nathan mentioned this
[46:38] remember if we filtered out everybody
[46:40] that wasn't genuine word born this is
[46:43] our Prophet talking now this ain't
[46:45] brother
[46:46] Dale so you can throw the rocks at the
[46:50] tombstone there'd be many blank sermons
[46:52] preached up against the wall
[46:54] tonight
[46:57] he talk he talked to the message
[47:01] churches he said there' be many blank
[47:03] sermons preached up against the wall
[47:05] that sounds like Wednesday night here
[47:07] sometimes he said it's true because it
[47:10] went through the word
[47:14] filter amen
[47:17] amen now now that's right before the
[47:19] prophet died that's with full upto-date
[47:22] Revelation he said and if we and if I
[47:25] I've got one discern discerned in my
[47:28] heart I hope that everyone listening to
[47:30] me has the same thing that God take us
[47:33] through your filter as David said try me
[47:35] and prove me and see if there be any
[47:37] evil in brother Dale because I brother
[47:39] Dale wants to go to Rapture so I'm not
[47:42] concerned about pleasing men I'm
[47:44] concerned about pleasing Christ Jehovah
[47:46] his Sweet Holy Spirit that's going to be
[47:49] my judge whether I go up and get a body
[47:51] change amen hallelujah God help us so so
[47:56] we're at the end brother Braham said
[47:57] we're at the end 70 years ago and so
[48:01] he's not coming for a little tiny girl
[48:03] he's coming for a mature lady that's
[48:05] that's that's accepted the seed of God
[48:08] and and we're going to a supper we're
[48:11] going to a actually a real party and I'm
[48:14] going to be there and I tell you what
[48:16] you're going to want earplugs they're
[48:18] going to have to be holy ghost filled
[48:19] earplug CU you're going to see the
[48:21] noisiest new body you've ever seen in
[48:24] your life oh Hallelujah can you imagine
[48:28] when we oh no you can't you you cannot
[48:32] imagine but I like trying I like trying
[48:36] amen so we see here in Hebrews 4:12 and
[48:40] I'm just mentioning this quick because
[48:41] we already did Hebrews 4:12 the word of
[48:43] God is the sword and Jeremiah
[48:46] 23:29 the word of God is the hammer and
[48:49] and you can get these later and
[48:51] Deuteronomy 4:24 and Jeremiah 5:14 God
[48:55] is the
[48:57] fire amen and I want you to notice
[49:01] something that happened in our day was
[49:03] the cloud do you know what the cloud
[49:06] represents oh this is powerful
[49:08] represents him coming down himself he
[49:12] didn't send an angel to come down in the
[49:13] cloud he came himself amen the head came
[49:18] down Hallelujah and the C Cloud showed
[49:21] respect and fear of
[49:23] reverence because it was Jehovah himself
[49:26] that came in the presence of the cloud
[49:28] and you can see that in Luke
[49:30] 9:34 and here here the cloud the same
[49:33] Cloud that over saddled Mary and the
[49:35] same Cloud that over saddled Jesus on
[49:37] Mount
[49:38] Transfiguration Hallelujah and said this
[49:40] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[49:43] pleased Hallelujah is the same Cloud
[49:46] that's here this morning ministering his
[49:48] word Amen brother Dale can't make this
[49:50] stuff up amen hallelujah the rock this
[49:54] morning is in the word word The Rock The
[49:56] Fortress the strength it's in Psalms
[49:59] 18:2 and that's why you when when the
[50:01] word of God Goes Forth everybody else
[50:03] hears something
[50:06] different because the word of God is
[50:08] many different things and so see you
[50:11] thought we thought we had God figured
[50:13] out we said well we got the message of
[50:16] the hour praise God we got them figured
[50:18] out he said you've been putting God in a
[50:21] box well we take brother Brown's message
[50:23] and and it it did it on the secrets is
[50:26] was Amos what is it Amos
[50:29] 38 uh the God will do nothing except you
[50:32] reveal the secrets to his servants of
[50:33] prophets there's no doubt about that at
[50:35] all but you know that same Prophet said
[50:37] that God don't show His prophets
[50:40] everything Hallelujah and God only shows
[50:43] His prophets when he needs to show His
[50:44] prophets and you know I'm going to I'm
[50:46] going to show you in this series you
[50:48] know there's a difference between the
[50:50] Old Testament and the New Testament you
[50:52] know Moses wrote the Old Testament and
[50:54] that was law but but brother Dale ain't
[50:56] living under law praise God I don't have
[50:57] to get a lamb or a dove or or uh any of
[51:00] those things to kill amen and my sin
[51:02] ain't just covered I feel a lot better
[51:04] than that I didn't sweep it under the
[51:06] rug and pull the mat down it's
[51:08] completely gone this house is good for
[51:11] allergies because there's no dust
[51:14] around and Paul bought Paul brought
[51:17] Grace and so people mix up the
[51:19] scriptures from the Old Testament and
[51:21] the New Testament and yes the old
[51:23] testament's there to Shadow and give us
[51:25] types and shadows but there a physical
[51:27] type and Shadow of the real Holy Spirit
[51:30] but the
[51:32] election
[51:34] amen changed
[51:36] everything amen I you know I know this
[51:39] is going to shock you so just hang on to
[51:41] your seat belts for a minute but you
[51:42] know that there's things in the
[51:47] Bible there's things in the
[51:52] Bible now this is this was this is our
[51:55] absolute this is Brother Dale's absolute
[51:57] this was brother Brown's absolute this
[51:59] was brother Brown's quotebook by the way
[52:02] and brother Brown came to just explain
[52:04] the scriptures oh that's what that me oh
[52:08] yeah that oh oh I didn't understand
[52:12] that but you know every one of those men
[52:14] of God had their own
[52:17] opinions and it wasn't just brother
[52:20] B there's opinions right in
[52:23] here I I know that's scaring you but I'm
[52:25] going to prove it to you I don't even
[52:27] have the scripture but it was the
[52:29] greatest prophet of all Paul brought
[52:36] Grace now let me ask you a question who
[52:39] ordained
[52:41] marriage Jehovah himself Jesus himself
[52:46] but Paul said I would that you would be
[52:47] like me and not
[52:49] married
[52:52] ouch
[52:54] ouch
[52:56] oh
[53:00] ouch oh I didn't like
[53:03] that now if we would have listened to
[53:05] Paul's message and not followed Jesus
[53:07] message I wouldn't have been
[53:13] born and yet God used
[53:17] Paul like no other man
[53:20] in I'll
[53:24] tell
[53:26] yeah I'm showing you that to show you
[53:31] see don't worship
[53:35] man because even Paul had an idea now he
[53:39] disclaimers that he says I'm saying this
[53:41] by permission but I would that you would
[53:43] be like me and you would not
[53:46] marry I'm glad that was IND
[53:49] doctrin you
[53:53] see so so see we can't put God in a
[53:57] box that's that's God's trying to bring
[54:01] us to
[54:02] maturity I'm not trying to leave the
[54:04] word not one spe we're not leaving the
[54:08] word we're not even leaving the message
[54:10] you know I I'm going to throw this out
[54:12] here let me let me throw this out to I'm
[54:14] I'm going to shock you again you know
[54:16] when brother Brown went behind the the
[54:18] the curtain of time and and he said they
[54:21] they told him they said now you'll be
[54:22] judged for the message you brought and
[54:23] he said will Paul be judged
[54:25] they said yeah Paul will be judged
[54:26] everybody will be judged for each H and
[54:28] he said but I preach what Paul preached
[54:30] and they said what we're resting in that
[54:33] okay but see there's things that Paul
[54:36] brought that were different than the Old
[54:38] Testament oh yeah a whole bunch so don't
[54:41] get hung up with the Old
[54:44] Testament oh yeah you don't think so
[54:47] because they pulled up their fist in
[54:49] that day you know when we were at John
[54:50] and laa Garrett there's some really
[54:52] tremendous videos on uh oh my way my
[54:56] brain uh on the Bible and it showed how
[54:59] in the Bible they were actually human
[55:02] beings like when maew was the tax
[55:04] collector in the Jewish C he wasn't
[55:07] really popular a lot of people
[55:13] never he was a that
[55:16] aw hello
[55:22] hello amen so we see that there was many
[55:26] things but Paul put the fist up with
[55:29] Peter Paul put the fist up with Peter
[55:32] when Peter struggled with the Old
[55:33] Testament and saying I well Peter was a
[55:37] hypocrite
[55:38] actually he never had a backbone you
[55:40] know it's installed right here between
[55:42] your shoulder
[55:44] blades because he he acted different
[55:47] around different
[55:50] people and they're not sitting
[55:54] here
[55:55] CU see if if it was the Jews around
[55:57] Peter actually like Bo you have to be
[55:59] circumcised with
[56:02] the but then if he was
[56:07] withes but if they show up the same time
[56:10] Peter
[56:17] really and Paul called him out for it he
[56:20] said you're a
[56:22] hypocrite he said it don't matter if
[56:24] you're circum or not circumcised it's a
[56:26] tye of the
[56:31] SP so you don't think they had struggles
[56:34] back then uhhuh uhhuh that's just like
[56:38] and and and this is God because I don't
[56:40] even have this in my filter and I didn't
[56:41] even study this so please forgive me but
[56:43] if any one of you scholarly people could
[56:45] look it up but you know we already said
[56:48] Moses wrote the Old
[56:49] Testament and it and it's for us the
[56:52] type in Shadow but it's but just is not
[56:58] direct watch what I'm saying I already
[57:00] did I show you an example about
[57:02] circumcision is that true what I showed
[57:03] you Peter and Paul literally took up
[57:06] arms they actually had strong
[57:10] words I don't have the scripture in
[57:11] front of me because I wasn't supposed to
[57:13] preach that today but God had other
[57:15] plans
[57:17] amen but that also goes for the
[57:19] qualifications of a
[57:21] minister do you know the qualifications
[57:23] of a minister in the Old Testament that
[57:25] Moses wrote under the law are completely
[57:27] different than than Paul wrote in the
[57:29] New
[57:31] Testament amen now if you still believe
[57:34] that you must have the skin cut off and
[57:35] physical circumcised you're
[57:45] Peter because if we went by the law of
[57:47] Moses and the qualifications of a
[57:49] minister we'd be in big
[57:51] trouble we'd be in big trouble because
[57:54] qualification in a minister under Moses
[57:57] remember this was the law remember they
[57:59] got in trouble if they didn't wash their
[58:00] hands three times before they ate the
[58:02] corn and they couldn't go in the
[58:03] cornfield they definitely wouldn't go to
[58:04] the restaurant on Sunday because they
[58:06] would die of the
[58:07] plague that was the law but we realize
[58:10] that the rest was our sweet holy spirit
[58:13] inside us not how good we are on Sunday
[58:15] J you're going to to start a tra because
[58:18] you
[58:19] just that's how myb was raised I know
[58:23] that clearly I I was raised I didn't
[58:26] kick a ball on Sunday I didn't ride a
[58:28] bike on Sunday and if my dad had to
[58:29] drive farther than the GU thing he
[58:31] wouldn't buy gas on Sunday and you don't
[58:33] have to worry to the
[58:37] rest but that was Moses's law and so the
[58:41] qualifications of a minister and I don't
[58:43] even have the scripture because I'm not
[58:45] preaching on this but this is just
[58:46] coming up
[58:49] am if you have a broken arm you can't
[58:52] Minister if you have a
[58:57] if you're unable to uh birth children
[59:01] you're not able to minister as a man now
[59:03] we're ads you know what I mean those are
[59:06] all in the qualifications of your wife
[59:08] must be a
[59:10] virgin that's not what
[59:15] Pauls now if you want to take all those
[59:17] other ministers out a Lotus because
[59:19] there's a lot of people BR there's a lot
[59:21] of people didn't want the family to get
[59:22] in Begg they went to the doctor and you
[59:24] know the head something you know and
[59:26] things like that and and a lot of people
[59:28] got a cked nose and if if you got if you
[59:30] have a birth mark it's the same verse
[59:32] you look it up you don't change me and I
[59:34] ain't read it in 100 years I hav read
[59:37] since the pr in the house if you have a
[59:39] birth you
[59:42] can't I got a I got a little he tip
[59:50] there but Paul came and brought a
[59:52] completely different message and he said
[59:54] if you're the man of one
[59:55] wife period and your house is in order I
[59:58] don't care if you don't believe that it
[1:00:00] just identifies who you are you're
[1:00:05] Peter so we see here in the election in
[1:00:09] the Bible I I'm and I'm going to go to a
[1:00:11] really amazing character and I'm going
[1:00:13] to need some some I'm going to need OT
[1:00:16] and Felix you can get ready but we see
[1:00:18] in Aon that Joseph lied in the Bible
[1:00:22] Abraham lied in the Bible Isaac lied in
[1:00:24] the Bible and Rahab lied in the Bible
[1:00:27] what are we going to do with the
[1:00:28] scripture that says there will be no
[1:00:29] Liars in
[1:00:33] heaven well I'll give you the answer
[1:00:38] Jehovah I'm nipplet don't ask
[1:00:42] me CU like my brain's only three pounds
[1:00:45] but his is
[1:00:53] omnipotent El in the Bible you know and
[1:00:56] and please forgive me I love there's not
[1:00:59] one person in
[1:01:01] here I wouldn't give my right finger
[1:01:04] for the elect in the
[1:01:06] Bible David took all his clothes
[1:01:09] off Isaiah took his clothes off for
[1:01:11] three years that was a long time can you
[1:01:14] imagine and Saul took his clothes off
[1:01:17] with all the prophets that's the
[1:01:20] ministers now now this ain't meant to
[1:01:22] hurt but you know I preached on this and
[1:01:24] I read a quote about I preached on
[1:01:27] through that we had visitors from London
[1:01:30] and I preached on where brother Brown
[1:01:32] said I said I and this ain't all my
[1:01:34] notes either because this is Rerun he
[1:01:36] said he said I preached to thousands of
[1:01:39] naked people and then he said no no
[1:01:41] actually tens of thousands now I don't
[1:01:43] care if you like that or not that was
[1:01:45] brother Bram talking so you're G to you
[1:01:47] know like you have to take that up with
[1:01:48] him go visit the cemetery and and and
[1:01:51] then he talks about
[1:01:53] breastfeeding
[1:01:55] and then he finishes that quote and he
[1:01:56] said now if you had your mind in the
[1:01:58] right place that wouldn't bother you and
[1:02:00] you know I preach that and immediately
[1:02:02] after I preached that like like not even
[1:02:04] five minutes there was a brother that
[1:02:05] don't attend here met me at the door and
[1:02:07] he said now if a sister come in in a
[1:02:08] two-piece bathing suit he said I'd give
[1:02:10] her my coat said not in this church you
[1:02:14] won't I said now brother Brown I asked
[1:02:17] said brother
[1:02:18] Brown now it's fine if you want to give
[1:02:21] him the Cod what you do with Isaiah
[1:02:35] and Elijah said he was
[1:02:37] there so we're going to give him a
[1:02:39] c and if you think I'm getting off on
[1:02:42] something I want to read something the
[1:02:43] prophet said and this is in
[1:02:45] 6107 and this is amazing this just blew
[1:02:48] my mind and this is free we can pass
[1:02:51] this around after and all that see see I
[1:02:53] want to be
[1:02:55] real and if we're just religious like
[1:02:57] there's some nicer churches in
[1:03:02] town watch this here brother Brown he
[1:03:05] said please explain First Corinthians
[1:03:07] this is in being God being misunderstood
[1:03:10] this is kind
[1:03:11] of
[1:03:12] 61723 I believe this is
[1:03:15] 61
[1:03:18] but he said please explain 1 Corinthians
[1:03:20] in the 14th chapter verse 34 and 35 let
[1:03:23] not a woman and be silent in church for
[1:03:26] it pertaineth to them not to speak and
[1:03:28] you know he's reading the scripture and
[1:03:29] that and so they ask the question for if
[1:03:32] it's a shame for a woman to speak in
[1:03:33] church now the question is now if a
[1:03:36] woman with short hair speaks in tongues
[1:03:38] in the church is that the Holy Spirit or
[1:03:41] is that a false
[1:03:43] Spirit
[1:03:45] Hallelujah anybody have confidence in
[1:03:47] the
[1:03:48] prophet is it okay to hi thank you
[1:03:51] brother ber God bless you
[1:03:54] Hallelujah well I tell you what I sure
[1:03:57] love his backup plan Hallelujah
[1:04:00] paragraph 16 or 60 sorry I have a few
[1:04:03] things highlighted here he said now this
[1:04:06] is a real hard
[1:04:07] question now I I just want to put a
[1:04:09] little dis
[1:04:11] here this might shock you what it
[1:04:16] says you're going to need therapy we
[1:04:19] didn't bring any pure oxygen to church
[1:04:22] but it couldn't be arranged
[1:04:25] uh but I can only answer this the best
[1:04:27] that I know now I can't I couldn't be
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] judge oh now bless God brother Dale's
[1:04:34] been a judge
[1:04:36] before come on now you I'm not the only
[1:04:39] one that's been in that
[1:04:41] car hello now I couldn't judge now this
[1:04:44] is a woman with short hair speaking in
[1:04:46] tongues in the service oh bless God that
[1:04:48] Jezebel I wish you wouldn't come to this
[1:04:53] place
[1:04:58] now by the way this is Avail I'm
[1:05:02] not he said now I think there's many
[1:05:04] times that we get another question down
[1:05:07] here and here's somewhere where that
[1:05:09] goes right along with that he says but
[1:05:11] if a person was speaking in tongues and
[1:05:14] they're anointed of God see they may be
[1:05:17] out of order that may be true but they
[1:05:20] may be doing something that's uh
[1:05:24] anointed of God now what he's saying is
[1:05:27] they may be out of order because they
[1:05:28] cut their but the speaking in Tong part
[1:05:31] is Anointed of God what he says and they
[1:05:40] Sor wait I got mixed up he said but I
[1:05:43] think that there's so many times that I
[1:05:44] got
[1:05:48] another the person speaking in tongues
[1:05:50] may be Anointed God they may be out of
[1:05:52] order and that may be true and they may
[1:05:54] be doing something that's not right
[1:05:56] talking about cut
[1:05:59] head now this is the prophet but I
[1:06:01] wouldn't want to say nothing that it
[1:06:03] wasn't the Holy Spirit I wouldn't
[1:06:08] know well you know why in a lot of
[1:06:11] places that a lot of people knew more
[1:06:13] than the
[1:06:15] prophet they thought they just thought
[1:06:18] that's a
[1:06:19] joke amen so watch let's carry on is are
[1:06:22] we doing okay amen I I we're going to a
[1:06:26] mature church so we're going to leave
[1:06:27] this place amen
[1:06:30] uh he says but I wouldn't want to say
[1:06:33] nothing against it wasn't the holy
[1:06:35] spirit because I wouldn't know he said
[1:06:37] now there's many times that people now
[1:06:40] now this is where you got to hang on
[1:06:42] there's many times that people misjudge
[1:06:44] one another and that's a bad thing to do
[1:06:48] now we read a scripture on judging now
[1:06:50] see that's the only way we're going to
[1:06:52] continue to have Fellowship
[1:06:56] thank you sister Donna there's one
[1:06:58] person that believes
[1:07:00] that amen no amen cuz see if we start
[1:07:03] judging one another said bless God I
[1:07:05] couldn't do that but bless God you know
[1:07:07] I I you
[1:07:09] know bless good you know one respects
[1:07:13] the person that if you're judged then
[1:07:15] you're guilty of the whole law so watch
[1:07:17] this he says caring on he said now
[1:07:20] there's many times that we misjudge one
[1:07:21] another and that's a bad thing to do he
[1:07:23] said said you say why she's got short
[1:07:26] hair and she's wearing her dress too
[1:07:29] short bless God doesn't she know that no
[1:07:31] man will see God without
[1:07:35] Holiness he
[1:07:37] said that that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:07:40] upon her talking about her clothes and
[1:07:42] her cut
[1:07:43] hair don't do that don't do that that's
[1:07:47] not right but you know but you don't
[1:07:51] know what's in that woman's heart
[1:07:54] heart now let's go let's just go back to
[1:07:57] that person that comes in maybe in a
[1:08:00] bikini now watch this the Bible says
[1:08:04] that no man comes to the father unless
[1:08:05] the father
[1:08:06] draw now her bikini is out of order but
[1:08:11] I ain't seen her
[1:08:12] heart it'd be very unusual for a person
[1:08:15] to come to
[1:08:16] church unless the father drew
[1:08:19] them and see what I mean that situation
[1:08:22] okay watch this so
[1:08:27] he said you're know the one that and he
[1:08:29] said you don't know nothing about it
[1:08:31] he's remember remember the remember the
[1:08:33] woman at the
[1:08:34] bar and the prophet judged her and
[1:08:37] remember that the when he when he
[1:08:40] contacted the woman's Spirit she shared
[1:08:42] all she went
[1:08:45] through he said you know the Holy Spirit
[1:08:49] would would make her conduct herself a
[1:08:53] little better you know that may be the
[1:08:55] truth but I'll tell you
[1:08:58] something tell you you and I let God now
[1:09:04] here's where we can do really good let
[1:09:06] God do the
[1:09:10] Judgment keep it on the Min and I'm
[1:09:13] going to blow your mind it's still
[1:09:15] coming he said let's let's you and I
[1:09:19] just pray for that
[1:09:21] person and that'll show
[1:09:24] and that God will show them the
[1:09:27] light
[1:09:29] amen how
[1:09:31] sometimes here some time ago a man met
[1:09:35] me
[1:09:36] aside and he said I had a piano teacher
[1:09:40] or piano
[1:09:41] player this does not apply here this is
[1:09:43] a prophet talking now I kind of felt
[1:09:46] like that when I preached on the
[1:09:47] two-piece bikini and the brother that
[1:09:49] don't go here met me right at the door
[1:09:51] right after so well I would give her my
[1:09:54] well you wouldn't know what I would do
[1:09:57] to him if he did that in church because
[1:10:00] it wouldn't be he said and I had a now
[1:10:03] now any let's just anybody's got
[1:10:06] confidence in the prophet
[1:10:07] again we got brother Bernard's hand last
[1:10:10] time sister okay now we got two people
[1:10:12] brother we got double we're going ahead
[1:10:15] he said now this is a holy ghost filled
[1:10:17] Vindicated
[1:10:19] prophet he said I had a piano player a
[1:10:22] short time ago and she had a
[1:10:37] minister
[1:10:52] and
[1:11:19] you know she
[1:11:22] ch
[1:11:50] and
[1:11:52] was
[1:12:04] and
[1:12:06] man teing
[1:12:22] pieces tell me more he said a man out
[1:12:26] there tearing pieces and he said and you
[1:12:29] call yourself a p
[1:12:35] preacher he
[1:12:52] said
[1:13:09] said I certainly don't agree and you
[1:13:12] know that that the skirt part up here
[1:13:15] and the two pieces skirt
[1:13:22] so
[1:13:24] and one of them is down here and kind of
[1:13:27] up here so he's talking about one's kind
[1:13:29] of like down here and one's kind of up
[1:13:30] here this is the Prophet this ain't
[1:13:32] brother preach I just press play and
[1:13:38] Obey forgive
[1:13:47] me the kind of skirt like they wear so
[1:13:50] it's real thin and it shows her under so
[1:13:53] now it's not just a minir but I can see
[1:13:56] the flowers on
[1:14:01] underwear
[1:14:04] whoa and I was around here and he said I
[1:14:07] don't think it should be done like that
[1:14:09] and I really don't but I couldn't they
[1:14:15] might they might just be spirit filled
[1:14:18] as anybody now he's talking about this
[1:14:21] sister with a SE Min skirt that's in two
[1:14:24] pieces and there's a break in here and
[1:14:27] she's got cut hair now you know brother
[1:14:30] Dale had to chew on this for few months
[1:14:33] you know remember I kept on giving you
[1:14:34] sneak picks of this message coming is
[1:14:37] because I was I was eating some meat and
[1:14:40] it had drizzle in
[1:14:42] it I'm like oh my goodness what is
[1:14:52] that
[1:14:55] but watch this and he said so but she
[1:14:57] might be just as spirit filled as
[1:14:59] anybody
[1:15:00] else he said I don't know God knows that
[1:15:03] and he said I wouldn't condemn
[1:15:06] it that woman and say that she's going
[1:15:09] to Hell by her
[1:15:11] sight well what are we going to do with
[1:15:13] no man will see God without
[1:15:18] Holiness the answer to that question is
[1:15:21] again
[1:15:22] Jehovah
[1:15:25] that's
[1:15:27] right I I know the devil don't want you
[1:15:29] to hear this you can be sure of it I'll
[1:15:31] sleep like a baby tomorrow night and the
[1:15:34] same person here in church had a lady
[1:15:37] and she had long hair and long Church
[1:15:39] long hair and a long dress and she had a
[1:15:42] buz saw like a DeWalt
[1:15:48] chainsaw God hallelujah and he said
[1:15:52] wearing their clothes neatly they should
[1:15:55] be an example of sweetness and motherly
[1:15:57] and sisterly he's talking about the
[1:15:58] woman with long hair and a long
[1:16:01] skirt he said but when you're quickly
[1:16:05] when you're real quickly to condemn
[1:16:08] somebody her and drive her
[1:16:12] away by throwing her a
[1:16:15] coat you might harm that Young born baby
[1:16:21] and so I would
[1:16:25] that is paragraph
[1:16:27] 67 if anybody would like to read it it's
[1:16:30] rest right here everybody's welcome to
[1:16:33] take a
[1:16:34] look he said
[1:16:38] now ain't it funny that the people in
[1:16:41] brother bram's day had the nerve to come
[1:16:43] and tear him to
[1:16:51] pieces wow
[1:16:54] you see I read that for a reason and
[1:16:56] there's a bunch more
[1:16:58] here we can't put God in a
[1:17:01] box we can't just draw a line on the
[1:17:03] wall and say well God's like this this
[1:17:05] this
[1:17:07] that because God will step out of the
[1:17:09] box and then what do we
[1:17:12] do amen and that takes Revelation and
[1:17:16] that takes discernment and that takes an
[1:17:19] omnipotent God dwelling in you to
[1:17:22] discern the contact of another
[1:17:24] omnipotent God that maybe's in a baby
[1:17:26] form and they're not really all got all
[1:17:29] the food that you know about but
[1:17:31] remember what brother Brown said about
[1:17:32] the people that were babes they've been
[1:17:35] preached to for years and they ain't
[1:17:37] grew up
[1:17:38] yet now what about the person that ain't
[1:17:41] been preached to at
[1:17:48] all wow and he said if you don't agree
[1:17:51] with me he said that's okay okay he said
[1:17:53] you see we misjudge these things many
[1:17:55] times and he said let's always try to
[1:17:57] think the very best of everyone who's
[1:18:00] trying to do
[1:18:03] right we don't know their hard unless
[1:18:06] you have discernment in this case he
[1:18:09] didn't even know that wellow he felt
[1:18:11] like she had a good spirit but our
[1:18:12] Prophet had
[1:18:14] discernment he said don't you don't say
[1:18:18] that they haven't got the right spirit
[1:18:20] cuz listen now I'm going to say
[1:18:23] something that will really stab
[1:18:27] you really stab you for a minute so just
[1:18:29] be still just a minute the holy spirit
[1:18:32] is speaking
[1:18:34] through
[1:18:36] speaking through a
[1:18:38] hypocrite exactly I've seen it done he's
[1:18:42] talking about hypocrites could speak in
[1:18:44] tongues a hypocrit could do all the
[1:18:46] things that could
[1:18:48] impersonate amen so it's not just by
[1:18:52] it's it's just not by writing it down
[1:18:54] and figuring God out
[1:18:56] amen you see what I
[1:18:59] mean and we we've hurt people in the
[1:19:04] past you know we're not supposed to have
[1:19:07] the spirit of Satan where we eat and
[1:19:08] devour our
[1:19:11] own we're all in different levels now
[1:19:14] you know I'm not promoting Min skirts
[1:19:16] and cut hair and no no and see through
[1:19:18] so no no not at all it's a it's sin
[1:19:24] but like could do but do we believe that
[1:19:26] God could actually change that person
[1:19:30] supernaturally without offending that
[1:19:32] person you know like how do we know how
[1:19:35] God rules the heart of a
[1:19:42] man but we in our
[1:19:45] flesh I'm going to fix that I'm going to
[1:19:48] fix it I'm not you know just out last
[1:19:53] week and start I
[1:19:56] said she's used to living with brother
[1:19:58] Bernard he just looks at something it
[1:20:00] just comes together because it's a fear
[1:20:03] I said I look at something and it falls
[1:20:06] apart me but we think we're all
[1:20:09] mechanics and we're going to fix
[1:20:11] God and we've actually hurt the
[1:20:15] picture no this is what our Prophet was
[1:20:17] talks
[1:20:21] about and he goes on here in this quote
[1:20:24] and I I'm skipping a bunch here please
[1:20:27] forgive me he's talking about the time
[1:20:30] when he was he he first came into the
[1:20:32] Pentecostal people and two people spoke
[1:20:34] in tongues the first time he ever heard
[1:20:35] it and he said wow he said I want that
[1:20:38] and he and he and he wanted to to get to
[1:20:40] know the people and one was a genuine
[1:20:43] believer yes sir and the other
[1:20:47] one uhhuh you
[1:20:50] remember and then he talks so long on
[1:20:52] the quote that he forgets the
[1:20:55] question I love that I love brother
[1:20:58] Brown he forgets he said now the woman
[1:21:00] was speaking in tongu said now now woman
[1:21:02] with short hair speaks in tongues in the
[1:21:04] church and this Spirit he say the holy
[1:21:06] spirit is a false spirit so he red do
[1:21:08] the question again and I'd like to would
[1:21:09] it be okay if I just finish part of this
[1:21:11] page now he said now you see now I
[1:21:14] wouldn't say
[1:21:15] nothing oh bless God there's a lot of
[1:21:19] message people should hear that now if
[1:21:21] our Prophet wouldn't say
[1:21:27] something but we think we're going to
[1:21:29] fix it
[1:21:32] really he said and if you thought the
[1:21:35] woman wasn't really exactly right having
[1:21:37] short hair and I believe in you know
[1:21:40] when he mentions he said but let's
[1:21:41] believe that she's got the Holy Ghost
[1:21:44] and if she's in the church I'm going to
[1:21:47] believe that she has he said did you
[1:21:49] know that once in a while we might EX
[1:21:52] examine and find out that we might have
[1:21:55] a little something
[1:21:57] wrong oh no bless God I don't have
[1:22:01] nothing I was born in the church I cut
[1:22:04] my teeth on the back
[1:22:06] too I wish there was the front
[1:22:09] you
[1:22:12] amen maybe we have a little something
[1:22:14] wrong too he said you know that's kind
[1:22:16] of right and he said you know so some
[1:22:19] somebody might have to tell
[1:22:23] something a lot of the time people has
[1:22:25] told me a lot of things that was
[1:22:28] wrong and what I'm doing
[1:22:31] wrong and and he said I appreciate
[1:22:35] it he said now let's say this let's say
[1:22:38] we believe whatever we believe but if
[1:22:40] the woman's not exactly a Christian if
[1:22:43] she's just putting it on God don't judge
[1:22:49] her that's right and moral and all these
[1:22:53] things and she's doing that right God
[1:22:55] will take care of that we don't believe
[1:22:59] that we don't believe that because I
[1:23:01] actually had two people that come and
[1:23:03] said they give the the woman a coat in
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:09] Bikini so we actually don't trust the
[1:23:11] God we say we
[1:23:14] do God will take care about and he said
[1:23:17] let's believe that the spirit that's on
[1:23:19] the woman is the holy spirit see because
[1:23:22] we don't know and he said now if the
[1:23:26] interpretation the holy spirit gives he
[1:23:29] said he's talking here he said if if the
[1:23:31] person looking like that went to curse
[1:23:33] Christ or curse the elect something then
[1:23:37] he said it's very easy to identify who
[1:23:39] they
[1:23:41] are
[1:23:43] amen now you you know I disclaimer that
[1:23:47] I'm not promoting that we all know for
[1:23:50] the Bible is very clear but do you see
[1:23:54] how we have family members that are
[1:23:57] going to come in this
[1:23:59] church there's people outside this
[1:24:02] church in this town are going to come in
[1:24:05] this church you say how do you know that
[1:24:08] brother because God told me
[1:24:11] that I see signs of it every single
[1:24:17] week you know the people across the road
[1:24:19] in the white house for no reason at all
[1:24:22] twice say something like unbelievable
[1:24:24] com like right out of the blue they
[1:24:25] bought it one they said we're just so
[1:24:27] glad that you're just our neighbor in
[1:24:28] the church and like and you're Dwight's
[1:24:30] best
[1:24:33] friend multiple multiple text for no
[1:24:35] reason just boom
[1:24:38] boom I've never went to the restaurant
[1:24:40] with them and they've never came in this
[1:24:42] church you don't think they're watching
[1:24:44] you walk in here
[1:24:46] oh y just let God be God and and and
[1:24:51] I'll tell I'll do my best to ju if I
[1:24:54] just take care of myself I'll be more
[1:24:56] than busy you know what I mean and see
[1:24:59] that way we can stay together till the
[1:25:01] Rapture amen because it's just everybody
[1:25:04] taking care you see me amen and then
[1:25:08] when these new ones come in they're
[1:25:10] babies they're going to need milk and
[1:25:12] just guide them on don't tell them oh
[1:25:15] for goodness say do not tell them God
[1:25:18] sent a prophet God sent many prophets
[1:25:21] the Prophet maybe tell them Jesus Loves
[1:25:24] You Jesus died on the cross for you amen
[1:25:29] and if you're part of him you're going
[1:25:30] to go back to him how about talking
[1:25:33] about
[1:25:34] Jesus that's right
[1:25:37] amen of course we know about Jesus more
[1:25:40] plainly because of a prophet we know
[1:25:42] that because of the whole Bible of
[1:25:45] prophets
[1:25:47] amen amen let's just move on and I want
[1:25:50] to go to a couple of spots and we won't
[1:25:52] be long witness here here Joseph in jere
[1:25:55] uh Genesis 4633 and 34 and we're we're
[1:25:58] going to read that and I don't want to
[1:26:00] have a couple of the boys help me and I
[1:26:02] want to preach on on the Prophet Elijah
[1:26:05] and I'm telling you what I needed I I'm
[1:26:10] telling you well we got to get to the
[1:26:12] Prophet Elijah that was just
[1:26:13] unbelievable amen Genesis 46 and
[1:26:17] 33 and it shall come to pass that when
[1:26:20] Pharaoh shall call thee
[1:26:22] and shall say what is thy occupation
[1:26:25] that ye shall say we are servants trade
[1:26:29] has been about cattle from our youth
[1:26:33] even until now both we and also our
[1:26:36] fathers that may that ye may dwell in
[1:26:40] the land of
[1:26:42] Goen
[1:26:43] Joshua told his dad to
[1:26:49] Li now that's premeditating
[1:27:00] lying I think it's pretty obvious to
[1:27:03] know that Joshua was or Joseph was one
[1:27:06] of
[1:27:08] gods amen now we're not condoning lying
[1:27:12] but is this in the Bible what are we
[1:27:13] going to do with that we're g to have
[1:27:16] what we're going to have to do is we're
[1:27:17] going to have to leave that in God's
[1:27:19] hands you
[1:27:21] see
[1:27:24] see and their day if you were a sheeper
[1:27:26] for every Shepherd is an Abomination
[1:27:29] unto the
[1:27:32] Egyptians I'm skipping David here
[1:27:35] because I think David's going to be a
[1:27:36] whole sermon in itself David had a
[1:27:39] couple
[1:27:41] issues just a
[1:27:44] couple
[1:27:46] whoa but David was God's
[1:27:49] elect see what I'm trying to say so when
[1:27:52] we looked at God's elect say oh David
[1:27:54] you all this and the people living with
[1:27:57] David oh my goodness they
[1:28:00] needed
[1:28:12] imagine I steep
[1:28:18] down but when we go into it God killed
[1:28:20] all the deacons and let David di
[1:28:24] V cuz you know see when we judge this
[1:28:28] you know what are we going to do with
[1:28:29] the scripture says touch not my anointed
[1:28:32] and do the an the ones the people with
[1:28:34] the Holy Ghost that's not just ministers
[1:28:36] and do my prophets no harm the anointed
[1:28:38] is everybody if you got the baptism of
[1:28:41] the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:28:42] anointed you know you know In the Flesh
[1:28:45] we treat the people that we dislike the
[1:28:47] most the worst or sorry the people that
[1:28:51] we love the most we treat the
[1:29:01] wor
[1:29:17] brother to
[1:29:20] yours if you did that to me I'd punch
[1:29:23] you in the
[1:29:25] eye and we think we can get away with it
[1:29:28] see the people you're close
[1:29:31] to you show who you really
[1:29:35] are and so we're close to each other and
[1:29:38] we're going to see who each other are
[1:29:40] but we don't need to worry about the
[1:29:41] other person because brother Dale's got
[1:29:43] a seven day a week job just take care
[1:29:46] brother
[1:29:47] do see do to me amen we sure do
[1:29:52] so here here is a example now I I'll can
[1:29:56] I read this scripture I'll come back up
[1:29:57] but I I want to just do it from memory
[1:29:59] is that all right
[1:30:20] here
[1:30:50] El
[1:31:16] and a he
[1:31:20] say
[1:31:23] I'm going to read
[1:31:27] this just
[1:31:31] interpreted
[1:31:44] allou the week before know he that
[1:31:50] my
[1:32:20] that
[1:32:45] on the right and this
[1:32:48] was this was
[1:32:50] a and
[1:32:52] he but
[1:33:20] he
[1:33:37] let's read it first Kings 20 35- 38 and
[1:33:42] Vicki make sure we get this up because
[1:33:44] this is just right out of the
[1:33:46] Bible you know I can't even dream about
[1:33:49] stories like
[1:33:50] this first vers 35 and a certain man of
[1:33:52] the sons of the Prophet said unto his
[1:33:54] neighbor and the now I told you the
[1:33:57] story so I'm just cutting the scripture
[1:33:58] short you can read this first Kings 20
[1:34:01] 35- 38 said unto his neighbor in the
[1:34:04] word of the Lord smite me I pray thee
[1:34:07] and the man refused to Smite him that is
[1:34:11] verse 35 does everybody see
[1:34:14] that now how in the world did the the
[1:34:19] the prophet think that his brother in
[1:34:22] the church was going to kill
[1:34:28] him verse 36 and then he said unto him
[1:34:31] because thou Hast not obeyed the voice
[1:34:35] of the Lord behold as soon as thou
[1:34:38] depart from me a lion shall slay thee
[1:34:41] and as soon as he has was departed from
[1:34:45] him Allon found him and slayed him now
[1:34:48] is that
[1:34:50] fair do I even understand
[1:34:54] that can we put God in a box are we
[1:34:58] trying to understand a sovereign God in
[1:35:03] election you see what I mean God
[1:35:06] stretching our thinking he's taking us
[1:35:08] out of a denominational baby a message
[1:35:11] baby and bringing us on to True men and
[1:35:14] women that are of full age that can take
[1:35:18] the raw
[1:35:19] meat the word of God God the bottom line
[1:35:23] is God is
[1:35:25] God and you're not going to understand
[1:35:29] God all the
[1:35:36] time like I'm just
[1:35:38] like and this comes to me and I'm like
[1:35:40] I'm going to preach on
[1:35:48] this 37 and then he found another man
[1:35:52] and said smite me I pray thee and the
[1:35:55] man smote him so that the smiting he
[1:35:57] wounded him and so the prophet departed
[1:36:00] and waited for the King by the way and
[1:36:02] disguised himself with ashes upon his
[1:36:08] face so what are we going to do with the
[1:36:10] scripture touch not my anointed there's
[1:36:13] two brothers trying to kill the prophet
[1:36:16] one that refused the one that obeyed the
[1:36:18] scripture died and the one that didn't
[1:36:20] obey the scripture Liv
[1:36:29] like
[1:36:32] whoa would we like to look at what the
[1:36:35] prophet said in questions and answers he
[1:36:37] said why did Elijah stand there when God
[1:36:40] give the Old King into aab a a ahab's
[1:36:45] hands and he told Ahab kill the king and
[1:36:48] Ahab refused to do it and Elijah this is
[1:36:51] questions and
[1:36:52] answers and Elijah the
[1:36:59] prophet uh
[1:37:05] uh there's a word here you're GNA have
[1:37:07] to help me out because my wife ain't
[1:37:08] here s n t r
[1:37:13] y Sentry thank you now the meaning of
[1:37:17] senty is someone who stands guard
[1:37:22] or watches against an intruder or
[1:37:25] unwelcome
[1:37:27] activity
[1:37:30] centry and Elijah the prophet had a
[1:37:33] Sentry so he was standing
[1:37:36] guard for unrounded unwanted entry they
[1:37:41] give the example like a guard dog that
[1:37:43] BS when somebody comes in that they
[1:37:45] don't
[1:37:47] know that's a prophet's job okay so the
[1:37:51] prophet Elijah standing there Sentry and
[1:37:53] said smite me with thy sword and
[1:38:05] he
[1:38:07] wow and then he told another man smite
[1:38:10] me and the pro and the man hid him with
[1:38:12] the sword and cut him and he wrapped
[1:38:14] himself up and disguised and he stood
[1:38:17] there and here came Ahab Riding on His
[1:38:20] Chariot and he said what standest thou
[1:38:22] here about and he said well I was the
[1:38:25] senty I was standing on guard I was the
[1:38:28] senty and I was given to care care over
[1:38:32] a man and he smoke me the prophet's
[1:38:35] lying now oh my goodness I should have
[1:38:38] put another liar down in the Bible this
[1:38:40] is Elijah he's lying to the king he said
[1:38:43] I was put guard over these people and he
[1:38:45] smot
[1:38:47] me to care over a man and he smot me and
[1:38:51] ran away and he said let him let him go
[1:38:54] and they told me if I did I'd have to
[1:38:57] pay for it with my own life so now the
[1:39:00] prophet's a liar
[1:39:04] too well will you have to pay and and so
[1:39:07] the prophet and he said well you will
[1:39:09] have to pay with your own life and he
[1:39:12] unrapped himself he remember he was
[1:39:14] disguised and he unwrapped himself in
[1:39:16] front of the king and said thus saith
[1:39:18] the Lord because thou didn't murder the
[1:39:21] the king down there you'll pay for it
[1:39:23] with your own life that's exactly
[1:39:30] right amen so you know the message has
[1:39:34] been guilty and forgive me I I'm not
[1:39:37] insulting the message but the message
[1:39:39] Believers have been guilty of thinking
[1:39:42] they know
[1:39:44] everything I'll say it for you amen
[1:39:48] bless
[1:39:50] God
[1:39:51] and many times it's just man's
[1:39:59] ideas
[1:40:01] Hallelujah let's look at would it be
[1:40:03] okay and maybe we'll close on this note
[1:40:06] and then our top character will be David
[1:40:09] and and there's multiple other Char is
[1:40:11] this okay amen I I'm trying to show I
[1:40:15] I'm not I'm not promoting
[1:40:17] sin that's that's that's a million miles
[1:40:19] from the truth
[1:40:22] yes oh if you only knew how far that was
[1:40:25] from the truth I believe in Holiness I
[1:40:27] believe in a woman looking like a woman
[1:40:28] and I think they're beautiful looking
[1:40:30] like a woman and a man looking like a
[1:40:31] man and having a backbone and being a
[1:40:33] man and a Gentleman and holding the door
[1:40:35] so it's wife don't even know what the
[1:40:36] car handles for because he opens the
[1:40:38] door for her Treat Her Like a Lady and
[1:40:39] tip her hat like when brother Bram was
[1:40:41] here what happened to those
[1:40:44] days you
[1:40:46] know you go to Uganda with me uh brother
[1:40:49] Carson and sister Sharon and all the you
[1:40:51] Jared I got Jared talked into going and
[1:40:53] the sisters come and take your plate and
[1:40:54] your silverware and they kneel down in
[1:40:55] front of you I think they're praying to
[1:40:56] me or worshiping me no it's just your
[1:40:59] culture it's
[1:41:01] respect you see what I mean so so and
[1:41:04] and and it and it's it's it's re it's
[1:41:07] it's not bad is what I'm saying it's
[1:41:08] it's not necessary but it's not evil you
[1:41:12] see what I
[1:41:14] mean but but we get I and and I'm going
[1:41:17] to close my iPad because that's the only
[1:41:19] way I'll even then
[1:41:23] um but sometimes things just aren't
[1:41:26] exactly how you
[1:41:28] think sometimes let me rephrase it
[1:41:30] sometimes they aren't exactly like
[1:41:32] brother Dale even
[1:41:37] thinks let's just read a couple quotes
[1:41:39] and and we we need uh you know we're
[1:41:41] doing good as but uh we have other and
[1:41:46] and uh so you know so we we look at the
[1:41:51] scripture and my my my heart's desire
[1:41:54] now you're going to have to discern this
[1:41:56] I can't show you my
[1:41:58] heart but my heart's desire is to be
[1:42:00] aund I don't want permissive
[1:42:03] will I want nothing but pure
[1:42:06] gold spiritually speaking I want the
[1:42:09] absolute truth and nothing but the truth
[1:42:11] and I want to feel God see God touch
[1:42:14] God everything God every
[1:42:19] service amen
[1:42:22] huh
[1:42:29] remember I'm not
[1:42:32] being this is more real than the yeah
[1:42:35] you're
[1:42:38] breathing but people you
[1:42:41] know and so and and you have the full
[1:42:44] right the full right especially people
[1:42:47] that pay ties you have the full right to
[1:42:50] come to me in private say brother Dale
[1:42:52] you know I told you now I made a
[1:42:54] disclaimer I'm going to disclaimer it
[1:42:56] again but I forgot today forgive me
[1:42:57] please I told you the last time I
[1:42:59] preached two weeks ago I said I'm going
[1:43:00] in this ditch anybody remember that I
[1:43:03] said I'm going in this ditch because the
[1:43:05] prophet said sometimes you got to go in
[1:43:06] this Stitch to pull you out of the rod
[1:43:08] on the other side but I don't want to be
[1:43:11] in the ditch I want to be right down the
[1:43:13] center you see to me I I truly do but I
[1:43:16] I'm overemphasizing because we're caught
[1:43:19] in a big rut over here
[1:43:21] and the ground's all hardened we can't
[1:43:23] pop the tire
[1:43:25] out amen amen so watch what the prophet
[1:43:29] says
[1:43:30] here about something and I'm going to
[1:43:32] tell you right now there's almost 100%
[1:43:34] of you won't believe
[1:43:39] this but it's still what the prophet
[1:43:41] said he said then in the church here he
[1:43:44] said we have our own doctor he's talking
[1:43:45] about brandom Tabernacle he said this a
[1:43:48] 59 quote e month
[1:43:51] he said ' we have our own Doctrine and
[1:43:53] he said sometimes it leaks out amongst
[1:43:55] people who
[1:43:56] comes and says well brother brandham
[1:43:59] said so and so those things well we got
[1:44:03] and brother Bram said well we got to
[1:44:05] have a
[1:44:07] Doctrine right now you know in our
[1:44:10] country not that it's a good country but
[1:44:13] it just happens that we're here this
[1:44:15] morning um to have a church in a
[1:44:17] terrible number you have to have a
[1:44:19] constitution
[1:44:21] that's just like the law it's you know
[1:44:24] it's more for the government than for us
[1:44:27] amen but you know we just write it as
[1:44:29] close to this as we
[1:44:32] can so so here's brother Brown saying in
[1:44:36] Bram Tabernacle we have a Doctrine but
[1:44:38] sometimes it leaks
[1:44:43] out in two years down the road in 61 he
[1:44:48] says now if there's any questions on
[1:44:51] Doctrine he said don't ask
[1:44:58] me he said I'd rather you ask your
[1:45:03] pastor he said you see because it's his
[1:45:09] duty now I me to tell you
[1:45:12] something and and and we it's not this
[1:45:16] don't even apply but you know most
[1:45:18] people would come to me and they'd say
[1:45:20] well you know brother
[1:45:37] now that I know you thinking I'm having
[1:45:38] a big head I never said that brother
[1:45:41] Bram said it in
[1:45:43] 61430 in the super sign he said it's
[1:45:45] your duty he said if you carry if he's
[1:45:48] carried you safely this far are with God
[1:45:51] he'll carry you all the W of the way
[1:45:53] through so you just go ask your
[1:45:56] pastor
[1:46:01] Doctrine because I don't like to answer
[1:46:05] those
[1:46:07] questions
[1:46:09] wow but you know what message believer
[1:46:11] say well brother Brown said brother
[1:46:13] Brown said brother Brown said brother
[1:46:16] Brown I say it
[1:46:18] too but the problem problem with that is
[1:46:22] brother Braham said lots of things and
[1:46:25] it's got to be the holy spirit that
[1:46:26] brings it together perfectly lined up
[1:46:30] with this here book called The Holy word
[1:46:31] of
[1:46:32] God and and and dad's not saying that
[1:46:35] brother BR was wrong and it's not saying
[1:46:38] that but brother Brown's Revelation grew
[1:46:42] and also early in his ministry he was
[1:46:44] preaching to
[1:46:46] babes and his Revelation grew and so his
[1:46:50] message message
[1:46:53] changed it was the same
[1:46:56] God but like for example and I mentioned
[1:46:58] this before so I'll say it really fast
[1:47:00] when when he first started preaching he
[1:47:01] said when you get saved I'm not building
[1:47:03] a kingdom go to any church you want then
[1:47:05] he said no then when the seals come out
[1:47:07] he said come out of her my people wait a
[1:47:09] minute that's a direct
[1:47:10] contradiction come out of her my people
[1:47:12] and be not partaker of her plagues and
[1:47:13] her
[1:47:14] sins and now we've come out but we
[1:47:17] haven't went into the holy of
[1:47:19] holies
[1:47:30] amen so now now he also said if you're
[1:47:35] to know those that labor among you and
[1:47:37] if your Holy Ghost tells you that that
[1:47:41] the person standing here is off the word
[1:47:44] of God run for your
[1:47:49] life man he said that run for your
[1:47:53] life don't stay here and say brother
[1:47:56] Dale led me to
[1:47:58] hell because you have the Holy Ghost
[1:48:01] too but don't stay here also and sit
[1:48:05] here for 10 years 15 years 50 years and
[1:48:09] be the same
[1:48:12] size because you won't eat the food
[1:48:14] that's coming from
[1:48:17] table that's what he said the first quot
[1:48:19] remember
[1:48:20] yeah well that God that's not the way I
[1:48:24] se it when I was in commun with
[1:48:28] god well you know that would be a pretty
[1:48:32] stupid businessman to have the fight
[1:48:38] Ministry
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:41] amen hallelujah so we're we're going on
[1:48:44] progressive revelation now we're in 6207
[1:48:47] we moved ahead another year and a half
[1:48:51] and here's something else he said and we
[1:48:53] would see Jesus and you know brother
[1:48:55] Brown said this and and praise God for
[1:48:57] the message Hub he said ask your pastor
[1:49:00] 15
[1:49:02] times so if you establish that by the
[1:49:04] word of God let two or three Witnesses
[1:49:06] be established it wasn't just something
[1:49:08] he said and you know you could take
[1:49:10] different quotes on that where he said
[1:49:12] it more times he said and the religious
[1:49:14] question that you might have in your
[1:49:16] mind I would advise you to ask your
[1:49:19] pastor and not me because every man lead
[1:49:23] in his
[1:49:24] flock and if he's the pastor and he's
[1:49:27] LED you safely this far trust them the
[1:49:29] rest of the
[1:49:31] way and if he's brought you
[1:49:34] up and you've been filled with the Holy
[1:49:36] Spirit and he's and the life that you
[1:49:40] trust that you're living why trust him
[1:49:43] the rest of the
[1:49:44] way because he's
[1:49:47] able to answer your questions
[1:49:58] Wow Let's
[1:50:09] stand God help us God help us to be you
[1:50:13] know God help

[1:50:30] amen it's not like an elevation or
[1:50:32] nothing like that just it's just God

[1:51:20] confidence in nobody and the person you

[1:52:13] I hope he'll hide them from you but you
[1:52:15] see what I mean we have to be mature
[1:52:18] amen and and and we're following God not
[1:52:21] man and and and you look at how the
[1:52:23] prophet dealt with these things look at
[1:52:25] how look at how the brothers attacked
[1:52:27] him look look at what he said tore me to
[1:52:32] pieces that wasn't just some friendly
[1:52:34] meaning in the office like oh well you
[1:52:36] know I think I see something a little
[1:52:38] bit
[1:52:39] different no no they dropped you know I
[1:52:42] went you know I told you we went and
[1:52:43] seeing j or Lan's family you know and
[1:52:46] and we had great time and and different
[1:52:49] things but we'd went and seen her older
[1:52:51] brother and her sister-in-law oldest
[1:52:53] brother you know they'd come over you
[1:52:56] know their kids are all grown and and
[1:52:58] stuff she has the doctors have give her
[1:53:01] so long to live and he can barely walk
[1:53:03] and they're they're a wreck you know and
[1:53:06] we're
[1:53:07] just we're just trying to be available
[1:53:10] if
[1:53:11] God wants
[1:53:14] to do something before they leave this
[1:53:18] earth and he told me something he said
[1:53:21] Dale he said my boy still talk about it
[1:53:24] when we come over to your house like 35
[1:53:26] years ago and he was putting his little
[1:53:28] boys in
[1:53:29] hockey and they were Americans so they
[1:53:32] didn't know nothing about hockey and I
[1:53:34] was telling them all about the equipment
[1:53:36] and I was young and stupid then and you
[1:53:38] know all those things and I said well
[1:53:40] the most important thing about your
[1:53:45] equipment the most important thing when
[1:53:48] you fit yourself for hockey
[1:53:50] is that if you want to fight you
[1:53:55] drop boys talk about that all the time
[1:53:57] they never
[1:53:58] forgot you said when you buy your
[1:54:01] equipment if there's somebody you want
[1:54:02] to punch in the nose make sure you can
[1:54:05] drop the
[1:54:07] glovs you
[1:54:12] know spiritually
[1:54:18] speak
[1:54:36] I don't like being lonely Heaven's going
[1:54:39] to have a lot of amazing people in
[1:54:41] it and I want to be
[1:54:43] there but there can be a lot of amazing
[1:54:46] people here on
[1:54:47] Earth but we can't have the the attitude
[1:54:50] bless God I'm going to drop the
[1:54:56] gloves you know in the body of
[1:54:59] Christ that's not the most important
[1:55:05] thing if you think brother Dale's
[1:55:09] wrong just keep it to
[1:55:12] yourself I mean if I mean if you think
[1:55:14] I'm off the word you come and show me
[1:55:16] or but you know like many of the
[1:55:20] prophets in the Old
[1:55:22] Testament people thought we wrong but
[1:55:24] you know this might surprise
[1:55:27] me they actually
[1:55:35] had they actually had communion with God
[1:55:37] too you know there's times that God's
[1:55:40] servants actually have communion with
[1:55:42] God and God's not the author of
[1:55:45] confusion so something's
[1:55:47] wrong amen something wrong God help us
[1:55:51] God help me pray for I'm not perfect no
[1:55:54] but I see these things and I say wow an
[1:55:57] amazing God there's just I mean we we
[1:55:59] probably got two more messages on this
[1:56:02] just people right out of the Bible
[1:56:03] David's almost his own his own message
[1:56:07] David's right-hand man and left-hand man
[1:56:09] was his half sisters two sons and they
[1:56:13] both God took their life both of
[1:56:17] them and we know David had major
[1:56:20] issues but he was
[1:56:24] elected amen amen God help us
[1:56:30] amen open my
[1:56:34] eyes
[1:56:37] Lord we want to see
[1:56:45] Jesus to
[1:56:48] reach and
[1:56:50] touch
[1:56:54] him and say that we love
