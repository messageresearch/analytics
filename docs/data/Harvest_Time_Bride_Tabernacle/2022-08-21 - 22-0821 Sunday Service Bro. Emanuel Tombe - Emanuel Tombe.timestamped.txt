[20:14] and so he'd actually had a shower and he
[20:17] and he had some chest pain
[20:18] and he his sister-in-law took him into
[20:20] the hospital and while they were

[21:21] completely bedridden and now brother jim
[21:24] is very weak he
[21:26] his heart was operating at 26 percent

[21:35] but you know but he was uh walking good

[23:01] i want to tell you
[23:06] [Music]
[23:08] more than ever
[23:11] before one more time let's sing that
[23:14] song
[23:15] more than ever
[23:17] before
[23:19] lord
[23:22] let's raise our hands to the lord
[23:25] [Music]
[23:28] lord i need you

[24:09] we're here in march
[24:25] your family
[24:27] amen
[24:28] and uh
[24:30] surprisingly my sister is here
[24:33] and my brother-in-law
[24:35] brother bennard
[24:36] god bless you ruth brother bernard
[24:39] amen
[24:41] so at this time that's
[24:43] thank you musicians
[24:51] amen
[25:00] you know
[25:02] every time we come into the house of the
[25:04] lord
[25:05] i i believe it's a time to come to meet
[25:07] with god
[25:10] i i really don't believe in just doing
[25:12] religion as a formality
[25:15] because what's happening in this last
[25:16] days there's a lot of religion available
[25:19] a lot
[25:20] and the prophet said that religion is
[25:22] just a covering
[25:24] so we want to go beyond just coverings
[25:27] because we want to come into the
[25:28] presence of god
[25:30] because we believe that there's a
[25:32] rapture
[25:34] take about to take place
[25:36] and
[25:37] where i've written my walk with the lord
[25:40] i want to be sure
[25:43] that i know him
[25:45] in the power of his resurrection
[25:48] is that right
[25:49] i mean
[25:51] i believe in
[25:54] big crowds sorry let me correct that
[25:58] small crowds of or big crowds doesn't
[26:00] really matter to god
[26:02] what god wants is the heart
[26:05] because what good would it be if you had
[26:07] 500 people in this building and christ
[26:10] cannot even find two
[26:12] who can have faith in him
[26:15] so i trust that
[26:16] we won't look at numbers
[26:18] and that's why you know when brother
[26:20] dale invited me
[26:22] to come back to speak i i counted an
[26:24] honor
[26:25] because some preachers
[26:27] only go where they are numbers
[26:32] i believe that wherever god's children
[26:34] are even if it's one
[26:37] i want to go where god sends me
[26:40] amen
[26:43] so
[26:43] i want to encourage your faith this
[26:45] morning
[26:46] we're going to touch a little bit on
[26:48] faith
[26:49] just to encourage you to keep fighting
[26:51] this fight
[26:53] and i trust that god will speak to your
[26:55] heart individually
[26:56] amen so once again thank you brother
[26:59] dale for the invitation
[27:01] may god continue to bless your ministry
[27:03] and the work that you're doing here i
[27:06] will keep praying for you
[27:08] amen so without wasting much time
[27:11] let's turn to the scriptures in genesis
[27:14] chapter 22
[27:17] genesis 22 14
[27:23] amen
[27:31] this morning i want to speak on
[27:32] possessing
[27:34] the gate of the enemy
[27:38] amen let's read
[27:41] and abraham called
[27:45] the name of that place jehovah jiren
[27:49] as it is said to this day
[27:53] in the mount of the lord it shall be
[27:55] seen
[27:58] and the angel of the lord called unto
[28:00] abraham out of heaven the second time
[28:05] and said
[28:06] by myself
[28:08] have i sworn saith the lord
[28:11] for because thou has done this thing
[28:15] and has not withheld thy son
[28:18] thine only son
[28:21] that in blessing
[28:24] i will bless thee
[28:26] and in multiplying i will multiply thy
[28:29] seed
[28:31] as the stars of the heaven
[28:34] and as the sun which is upon the
[28:36] seashore
[28:38] now here is where we are taking our text
[28:39] from
[28:41] and thy
[28:42] seed shall possess the gate
[28:47] of his
[28:48] enemies
[28:50] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[28:54] the earth
[28:55] be blessed because thou has obeyed
[28:58] my voice
[29:01] god bless the reading of the scriptures
[29:02] you may have your seats
[29:05] amen
[29:11] so
[29:12] if if we go back to verse 17
[29:17] when god is giving the promise he says
[29:20] thy seed
[29:22] shall possess the
[29:24] gate of his enemies
[29:28] now if you notice closely
[29:30] the scriptures is not saying gates
[29:33] singular
[29:36] the gate of his
[29:38] enemies
[29:40] and i believe that this has a
[29:42] significance to us christians
[29:45] today
[29:48] because you see
[29:51] there's only one god and there's one
[29:54] devil
[29:56] the prophet says there's only two forces
[29:58] in the world today
[29:59] the force of god
[30:01] and the force of the enemy
[30:03] and
[30:04] this morning
[30:06] there is a warfare going on
[30:09] and i believe we are coming to the
[30:10] climbers climax where those two forces
[30:14] are coming to our showdown
[30:16] and you're either identified on the side
[30:19] of god
[30:20] or you are on the side of the enemy
[30:22] there is no neutral grounds is that
[30:24] right
[30:26] so we want to be sure
[30:28] we want to be certain
[30:30] on which side we are on
[30:33] because the showdown is coming where
[30:35] they you know
[30:37] in world is what they call no man's land
[30:40] but let me say this with god there's no
[30:42] such a thing you're either on god's side
[30:45] or you are on a devil's side
[30:48] or amen
[30:49] so looking at that thought
[30:53] where god is saying that you will
[30:54] possess the gate of your enemy
[30:58] it means that there's only one control
[31:01] center
[31:02] not two not three not five only one
[31:07] the gate
[31:09] of the enemy
[31:10] that's very important
[31:12] you see
[31:14] if in this building for example we have
[31:16] multiple gates or let's say doors we
[31:19] have one at the back
[31:21] we have
[31:22] one on this side there's one in here
[31:25] so if thieves want to break into this
[31:27] building
[31:28] they have many points of access
[31:31] all right
[31:32] but if you only had one entrance there
[31:35] you won't have to worry about what's
[31:36] happening on this side or this side
[31:38] that's where you have to watch
[31:41] that right and so god is saying that
[31:43] there is only one gate
[31:46] and you are going to possess
[31:48] the gate of your enemy
[31:50] so you are going to be standing at the
[31:52] place where satan has access to the
[31:55] building
[31:58] is that right
[31:59] so that you can focus on your enemy
[32:02] and i want to zero in on the enemy this
[32:04] morning because
[32:05] satan has one objective
[32:10] one objective and that is to kill to
[32:12] steal and to destroy
[32:14] amen
[32:16] so
[32:26] by god placing in that position as a
[32:29] christian
[32:32] it means that you control who
[32:35] and what comes into the kingdom
[32:40] isaiah 54 says
[32:43] no weapon
[32:46] listen no weapon
[32:49] that is formed against thee
[32:53] shall prosper
[32:57] okay
[32:58] you've got to believe that i have to
[33:00] believe that
[33:01] no weapon that is formed against the
[33:04] jared
[33:06] shall prosper
[33:08] and every town
[33:11] that shall rise against thee
[33:15] in judgment thou shalt condemn
[33:19] that is the promise to the believer
[33:23] oh i wish that christians today could
[33:26] recognize
[33:28] what god has given them
[33:30] you know i believe we are coming to a
[33:32] point where
[33:34] we've got to rise up saints of god
[33:37] we've got to recognize who we are
[33:41] gone are the days of saying i i hope so
[33:45] or or maybe
[33:46] you know i'll make it in you either have
[33:49] you you're either in or you're out amen
[33:52] and i trust this morning by the grace of
[33:55] god you can begin to see yourself in the
[33:57] promise of god
[33:58] and like you know the prophet gave a
[34:00] story of that boy who went to i think
[34:02] his auntie's house or
[34:04] i forget exactly but he saw
[34:07] a mirror
[34:09] and he went before the mirror away
[34:13] and the boy in the mirror went
[34:17] he dug down perhaps and the boy got down
[34:21] and after a while
[34:24] he said mama
[34:25] that's me
[34:28] that's me
[34:29] so god wants you
[34:31] to look into the mirror of the world and
[34:34] not just say oh
[34:36] i see paul
[34:38] well i see peter
[34:40] well i i see our brother branham
[34:43] but what about you
[34:45] you've got to come to a place where you
[34:46] can say papa that's me in the mirror and
[34:51] you are written in the scriptures
[34:55] the problem is that a lot of us
[34:58] when it comes time to taking the word
[35:02] and saying ah
[35:05] i see myself in the word
[35:08] the bible says in malachi for behold i
[35:10] send you
[35:12] elijah the prophet
[35:14] so you have a place in the scriptures
[35:16] because without you what's the point of
[35:17] elijah of malachi 4 sorry
[35:20] see malachi 4 came because of you
[35:24] and you are identified in the scripture
[35:27] so you have a program to play
[35:29] god sending a prophet in this age wasn't
[35:32] just to
[35:33] to come and broadcast brother branham
[35:35] and brother branham and brother brown we
[35:37] have so much of god her son a prophet
[35:39] but what about the bride now
[35:42] who has a position or a calling in this
[35:45] hour
[35:46] the final voice to this final age
[35:50] is you sense of god
[35:52] and i want you to recognize yourself
[35:55] according to the promise of god because
[35:57] the enemy
[35:59] is going to challenge you
[36:01] and he will come in the forms that you
[36:04] least expect
[36:07] hallelujah
[36:09] so
[36:12] jesus said in saint john 10
[36:16] he said that he said this
[36:18] then jesus said unto them
[36:21] verily verily i say unto you i am the
[36:25] door
[36:27] to the sheep
[36:29] you see where jesus placed himself at
[36:31] that door
[36:33] okay
[36:35] all that ever
[36:37] came before me
[36:39] are thieves and robbers
[36:42] but the sheep
[36:43] did not hear them
[36:46] listen i am the dog singular
[36:51] by me
[36:54] by you because you are the one to
[36:56] possess that gate of the enemy
[36:58] so the same is the the same is typed
[37:01] with jesus because he places himself at
[37:04] that door being the door
[37:06] all right says if any man enter in
[37:11] he shall be saved and shall go in and
[37:14] out and find
[37:16] pasture
[37:18] now
[37:19] the thief
[37:20] cometh not
[37:22] but to steal
[37:25] to kill
[37:26] and to destroy
[37:28] okay satan operates in a threefold
[37:31] manner
[37:32] always remember that everything god does
[37:35] satan will patent himself after the same
[37:38] the same person as god
[37:41] all right
[37:42] jesus said that
[37:44] i am the way
[37:46] the truth and the life
[37:49] he says and i came that you might have
[37:51] life and have it more abundantly and
[37:54] watch the enemy
[37:55] every promise that every one of those
[37:58] attributes of christ
[38:00] satan is here to match it
[38:02] to steal to kill and to destroy you
[38:10] but i thank god
[38:12] that greater is he that is in me
[38:14] hallelujah than he that is in the world
[38:18] you've got to recognize who it is that
[38:21] is in you
[38:23] and that's why the preaching of the
[38:24] world is to bring into a recognition of
[38:28] who you are
[38:30] and
[38:31] how do we
[38:34] how do we know who we are
[38:37] is it because i tell you no
[38:40] because i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[38:44] but jesus
[38:46] is here today
[38:49] and i believe that's why the holy spirit
[38:51] is so important
[38:53] in the church
[38:54] because without the new birth
[38:57] without the new birth saints of god you
[39:00] are none of his
[39:02] okay
[39:03] i am not talking about the letter of the
[39:04] word because the bible says that the
[39:06] letter killeth but the spirit give it
[39:08] life so we've got to take the mechanics
[39:11] and the dynamics so that it can produce
[39:13] the spark of the gospel because the
[39:16] world today is looking not for more
[39:18] religion
[39:19] but they want to see jesus christ the
[39:21] same yesterday today and forever and who
[39:24] else
[39:25] can represent christ in this age but you
[39:29] hallelujah
[39:34] god loves you
[39:39] god loves you how many can say amen to
[39:41] that
[39:44] if god didn't love you
[39:48] you would not be sitting here or you
[39:50] would not have you won't even be sitting
[39:52] under this ministry
[39:53] you won't have come this far in your
[39:55] journey
[39:56] you see
[39:57] the prophet said that
[40:00] christ was sorry the bible says that
[40:02] christ was slain before the foundation
[40:04] of the world
[40:05] in god's mind
[40:07] jesus was slain
[40:09] and the prophet said that
[40:12] god did not send jesus to calvary so
[40:14] that somebody could have pity on him
[40:18] you know this pity gospel of oh give
[40:21] your life to jesus because you know he
[40:24] died for your sins and she feels sorry
[40:26] for what he went through all the pain
[40:28] and the agony that he suffered no no no
[40:31] no
[40:32] god said that i mean the prophet said
[40:34] that god does not run his business like
[40:36] that it's not based on pity he came
[40:39] because he knew exactly
[40:42] who would be in and who would be out
[40:44] so jesus's death was only meant although
[40:47] he died for the sins for the sin of the
[40:49] world but he knew that not everybody
[40:53] would receive the sacrifice that he made
[40:55] on calvary so he his coming was meant
[40:58] for you
[41:00] you who was ordained before the
[41:01] foundation of the world
[41:03] amen so god has placed his children in a
[41:07] position of power
[41:09] and authority over the affairs that take
[41:12] place in the kingdom of satan
[41:19] i'll say that again slowly
[41:21] god has blessed you sister luanne
[41:25] brother matt i'm sorry to mention your
[41:27] names i know a few believers
[41:30] brother bernard
[41:32] all of you
[41:33] believers god has placed in a position
[41:36] of power
[41:37] and authority
[41:41] and by virtue of that that means that
[41:43] you are in control
[41:45] of what happens
[41:47] in this kingdom
[41:50] okay then the bible says said that he
[41:52] has made us priests
[41:54] and kings
[41:55] what was the king for
[41:58] a king rules over a kingdom
[42:03] i don't believe for one minute that
[42:06] when the rapture takes place takes place
[42:08] we will just barely make it out of this
[42:10] place i want to leave this earth
[42:12] and when i'm gone satan says
[42:15] they're gone
[42:17] i want him
[42:19] to say that i'm glad that they are out
[42:22] of here
[42:24] you see wherever jesus went
[42:28] demons trembled
[42:31] to the extent they said that have you
[42:32] come to torment us before our time
[42:34] without speaking a word
[42:38] is that right
[42:39] because jesus carried a power within him
[42:43] he was full of so much of the power of
[42:45] god
[42:46] his life
[42:48] was atonement to the enemy
[42:50] and that's where we should come to that
[42:52] it's not just about religion but
[42:54] wherever you go at school young people
[42:58] at your workplace
[43:00] you live such a life until demon powers
[43:03] recognize who you are
[43:06] see
[43:07] if jesus did it then so can we do it
[43:10] today
[43:11] i want to come to a place where when i
[43:13] walk into a grocery store for example
[43:17] without speaking a word
[43:19] demon powers will bow
[43:21] not to me but to the god that lives in
[43:23] me
[43:25] and that's where we are coming to
[43:27] by the time we leave this world
[43:31] it should be such a sigh of relief for
[43:33] the enemy to say thank well you can't
[43:35] say thank god but at least they're gone
[43:38] because there's going to be three and a
[43:40] half years of tribulation that's coming
[43:42] upon this earth
[43:44] jacob's trouble
[43:46] and it's going to be so
[43:49] bad
[43:51] not so much for those
[43:57] who never heard the gospel
[44:00] but for those who heard the gospel and
[44:02] rejected it
[44:05] it's a time of purging
[44:07] those who heard the gospel being
[44:09] preached
[44:11] and under the sound of the gospel they
[44:13] failed to take heed to the warning of
[44:16] god
[44:18] they failed to go and receive
[44:20] the promise of the holy ghost
[44:23] the tribulation period
[44:25] is not just a time of trouble for the
[44:27] world
[44:28] but a time for those
[44:31] people who were just religious church
[44:34] goers
[44:35] and they failed to take the promises of
[44:38] god to get their lives correct
[44:41] it would be a time of weeping and
[44:43] wailing and gnashing of teeth and
[44:46] how many people would say i wish
[44:49] i wish i had taken heed
[44:52] and perhaps this morning you are
[44:54] receiving
[44:56] that call that warning in your heart
[44:59] to come to christ because i'm not here
[45:02] to present to brother dale's church
[45:05] we are here brother dale is striving to
[45:07] present you to christ
[45:09] we are preaching jesus
[45:12] not no man because all that are in
[45:15] christ jesus will come up in the
[45:17] resurrection
[45:18] those are the ones who are going in the
[45:20] rapture
[45:22] is that right
[45:24] so we are here to present jesus to the
[45:26] people
[45:28] and we don't want to preach a dead
[45:30] gospel either because the paul says i
[45:33] came not in word only but in the power
[45:36] and in the demonstration of the gospel
[45:39] that is so lacking today
[45:43] and sad to say that a lot of people when
[45:46] i say a lot of people let me say this
[45:48] way
[45:48] so-called christians
[45:51] they just know the letter of the word
[45:54] no prayer life
[45:56] when you don't have a prayer life church
[45:58] of god you are powerless before the
[46:01] enemy
[46:03] because jesus is greater success
[46:06] it's not so much when the miracles
[46:08] happened what people saw which was when
[46:10] he spent time
[46:12] praying out in the mountains
[46:14] praying to the father waiting
[46:17] on on the father to anoint him so when
[46:20] he came out to perform miracles it was
[46:22] just a mop up operation
[46:24] and we need to pray you need to have a
[46:26] prayer life where you spend time with
[46:28] god in your closet
[46:31] develop a relationship because that's
[46:33] when god speaks to you
[46:35] when we come to congregate like this
[46:37] it's only what one hour of preaching of
[46:39] the world then you go home and you have
[46:42] the whole week you come back wednesday
[46:44] let's say
[46:45] that's not enough
[46:47] you've got to develop a relationship
[46:49] with christ spend time reading your
[46:51] bible
[46:53] read the message pray
[46:55] and i'm not talking about like just five
[46:57] minutes and saying lord well thank you
[46:59] for the food and thank you for this day
[47:02] bless us as i go to sleep amen no
[47:06] spend time
[47:07] you know when you're in love with
[47:08] somebody
[47:10] to those who have been who are married
[47:12] now
[47:13] during courtship
[47:17] you can't wait to hear the voice of that
[47:19] special one
[47:21] i mean if it means talking for two hours
[47:24] who cares
[47:26] you know why
[47:28] because you're in love
[47:30] because you're in love
[47:33] so
[47:35] when you're in love with jesus
[47:38] spending time with him it's not just a
[47:40] quick affair
[47:46] and that's where the power of the church
[47:48] lays
[47:49] but
[47:50] a powerless life
[47:54] it means it's a prayerless life
[47:58] and you can't meet the enemy just by
[47:59] intellectual
[48:03] amen
[48:06] satan
[48:08] is a creature who has been around or let
[48:10] me say this way he has studied the
[48:12] program of god for the last 6 000 years
[48:15] he was in heaven
[48:17] so he knows a lot more than what a lot
[48:20] of us know so if we think that we're
[48:22] going to meet him on intellectual
[48:24] grounds we're mistaken
[48:26] because when he met jesus after jesus
[48:30] received the holy ghost
[48:32] and he went to be tempted in 40 days
[48:36] look at how he came to him
[48:39] it is written
[48:41] he was using the word to quote the word
[48:46] and
[48:47] if you think that by knowing just the
[48:50] bible or what the prophet said i'm sorry
[48:53] i've got sad news for you satan knows
[48:56] all those things
[48:57] but you've got to come to the place
[48:59] where him god christ
[49:02] is living in your heart
[49:05] and it's no longer your efforts or my
[49:07] mind or my intellect but it's christ
[49:09] now manifesting his life in you
[49:13] because jesus
[49:16] met him with the word i think last time
[49:17] we preached on it's written when i came
[49:19] you see but satan also being an
[49:21] intellectual creature he also knows this
[49:24] bible
[49:25] so it was word for word word for word
[49:29] but eventually
[49:31] what did jesus say
[49:32] says get thee behind me satan because he
[49:35] knew who he was
[49:39] okay he knew who he was and you've got
[49:42] to recognize who you are today
[49:44] amen
[49:46] now
[49:52] in war
[49:54] you know
[49:55] in the natural now
[49:58] right now ukraine and russia
[50:01] are at war
[50:03] we all know that
[50:06] i believe before putin went to ukraine
[50:09] he must have spent a long time perhaps
[50:12] years or months
[50:14] preparing for this walk i don't think he
[50:16] just woke up one day and says well let's
[50:18] go
[50:20] there's preparation that's
[50:22] needed
[50:24] and you see
[50:26] he had to study to know
[50:28] his tactics
[50:30] and who is going to fight
[50:32] all right
[50:35] the same thing applies in the spiritual
[50:38] you've got to know the tactics of the
[50:40] enemy because if you go to war without
[50:43] knowing having a strategy or knowing how
[50:45] the enemy fights
[50:47] you might get killed
[50:50] okay
[50:51] and let's look at a few of satan's
[50:53] tactics and i'm taking this from uh
[50:58] brother branham when he was in a prayer
[51:00] line
[51:01] because he's in a prayer line that he
[51:04] identifies a lot of the spirits
[51:06] that we're tormenting people
[51:08] especially when it comes to sickness
[51:11] so we're going to look at a few about
[51:12] five or six of the of these
[51:15] what i did is i took snippets of
[51:17] quotations so i will not mention the
[51:19] whole thing just snippets so that you
[51:21] can see where satan operates
[51:24] okay
[51:26] the prophet says
[51:27] and now this man is standing here before
[51:31] me
[51:33] listen
[51:34] and satan has plugged his ears
[51:38] to make him walk before a vehicle
[51:42] or something and be killed on his feet
[51:46] trying to do this harm to this poor
[51:49] brother
[51:50] but we are here to make him whole father
[51:55] he has plugged the ears of a poor
[51:58] innocent
[51:59] creature of god
[52:01] remember what i said in the beginning
[52:03] satan came to kill to steal and to
[52:05] destroy
[52:06] all right number two
[52:10] satan has talked to you i'm quoting the
[52:13] prophet now
[52:14] satan has talked to you
[52:17] try to get you to doubt that
[52:22] and get away from that
[52:24] but you held out
[52:27] do the same thing your stomach trouble
[52:30] will be gone if you do that so number
[52:32] one
[52:33] plug the ears
[52:35] number two
[52:36] talks to you
[52:38] okay
[52:39] satan talks
[52:41] oh yes he does
[52:43] okay
[52:45] number three
[52:47] the prophet says our heavenly father
[52:51] you who created this man
[52:55] who brought him here
[52:57] to the earth
[53:00] and he's just here a youth
[53:05] says he means so much to your kingdom
[53:07] father
[53:09] among young men
[53:11] today that's gone astray
[53:15] but
[53:16] he wants to serve you
[53:19] how many today want to serve god young
[53:20] people
[53:22] they have the desire to serve god
[53:25] listen
[53:27] but he wants to serve you
[53:29] and satan has bound him
[53:34] but now thou has him to be healed
[53:40] these are the tactics of the enemy okay
[53:43] just bound him because
[53:48] him being a youth he wants to take
[53:50] advantage of because the bible says
[53:52] remember now thy creator in the days of
[53:54] thy youth there's something about youth
[53:57] and satan knows if he can get you young
[54:00] people
[54:01] while you're still young
[54:03] he has a lot of potential
[54:06] look at the stars of the world today the
[54:07] movie stars and the and the great
[54:09] singers a lot of them the satan gets
[54:12] them when they're still
[54:14] in their teenagers young so that you can
[54:16] get maximum service out of them
[54:19] all right
[54:21] all right let's look at number four
[54:25] the prophet says on your mental
[54:27] conditions
[54:29] that you feel strained
[54:32] and upset all the time
[54:35] depressed
[54:37] says is that right
[54:39] many times listen to this one
[54:41] satan has told you
[54:43] you've crossed over the line
[54:46] another tactic of the enemy
[54:48] you have crossed over the line oh this
[54:51] hits so many christians
[54:54] god does not love me
[54:57] god does not care for me
[54:58] god forgot about me long i've heard
[55:01] people say this god forgot about me long
[55:03] ago
[55:05] another tactic of the enemy so if the
[55:07] devil can get you to believe that
[55:11] he knows that he has conquered you
[55:14] and you've got to cast those thoughts
[55:16] aside don't ever let the enemy tell you
[55:20] that you have crossed the line
[55:22] in fact if he says that to you
[55:26] just think about it the bible says he's
[55:28] a liar
[55:29] because he cannot tell you the truth
[55:33] he can never come and tell you the truth
[55:35] so it means that there is hope for you
[55:37] amen
[55:39] says you have satan has told you've
[55:41] crossed the line
[55:42] but he has lied
[55:45] jesus christ has healed you praise god
[55:49] number five
[55:51] dear father
[55:53] this is still brother burnham praying he
[55:55] says dear father i realize that satan
[55:58] has set a trap
[56:00] there you go
[56:03] and now he's caught our sister
[56:06] for her to have to have one of these
[56:09] brain hemorrhages now and leave the
[56:11] world premature death
[56:14] set a trap
[56:22] the last one
[56:26] friends this is the prophet now quote
[56:28] i'm quoting the prophet says friends
[56:31] satan
[56:32] has got something to pattern
[56:36] or impersonate anything god has another
[56:39] tactic of the enemy okay
[56:41] listen
[56:42] all the things that he has
[56:46] he had to impersonate god with it
[56:51] but where there is a false there's got
[56:54] to be a true one somewhere
[56:57] for it to be made off of
[57:00] or it won't be false
[57:04] you've all heard of counterfeit money
[57:07] well where does it come from
[57:10] you've got to have the original
[57:11] somewhere
[57:14] because the the counterfeits is always
[57:16] made after the form of the original one
[57:22] and
[57:23] satan has nothing original because he
[57:26] cannot create
[57:29] there's only one creator and that's god
[57:32] okay
[57:33] so his job is to pervert
[57:36] the original creation of god and we're
[57:38] going to see a few of the things that
[57:40] satan is perverting in this age
[57:43] all right
[57:48] do you realize that the very demon
[57:51] spirits behind sexual orientation
[57:54] they try to pattern after the scriptures
[57:57] to justify their evil ways
[58:01] all right
[58:04] look today what's happening
[58:06] i mean brother dale you just look back
[58:08] what 15 20 years ago
[58:11] how much things have changed
[58:13] in the last five ten years
[58:18] and before we go into that let's read
[58:20] this scripture in genesis 1 27
[58:24] so god created man in his own image
[58:28] in the image of god created he him
[58:32] male and female created he them
[58:36] this year
[58:38] is one of the scriptures
[58:40] that is being used today
[58:42] to justify
[58:44] sexual
[58:46] orientation
[58:48] or let me say perversion
[58:52] in the beginning god made a man
[58:55] he made a man a man and he made a woman
[58:58] a woman
[59:08] now
[59:09] adam when adam was created
[59:12] in that spirit being of adam was both
[59:14] male and
[59:16] female
[59:18] but god eventually said no
[59:21] i need to separate the two
[59:24] god made that decision
[59:27] and then out of that he put adam in a
[59:30] deep sleep
[59:32] performed a surgery
[59:33] took a rib from his side
[59:36] and created the woman
[59:38] and when adam looked at this woman he
[59:40] says oh my this is flesh of my flesh and
[59:44] bone of my bone
[59:47] and then god took the female spirit and
[59:50] placed it in that body
[59:52] and since then
[59:54] that program of god has never changed
[59:58] so you can't find anywhere in the
[1:00:00] scripture where god has a man
[1:00:05] coexisting with a woman's spirit in him
[1:00:09] you will not find in the scripture
[1:00:14] if god separated the two
[1:00:16] let's keep it that way
[1:00:20] all right
[1:00:23] god made adam
[1:00:25] it wasn't adam and steve
[1:00:27] it was adam
[1:00:29] and eve
[1:00:33] i know this is not popular to preach
[1:00:35] but
[1:00:36] we are going to stand with the bible
[1:00:39] the laws of man
[1:00:42] will change and be twisted but there's
[1:00:44] coming a day
[1:00:46] where we've got to face the one who
[1:00:48] wrote the scriptures
[1:00:50] and we should stand in this hour and be
[1:00:52] fearless against the invasion of this
[1:00:55] demon powers
[1:00:57] that are coming up to tell people that
[1:00:59] oh you know what
[1:01:01] if if if you're a girl and you feel like
[1:01:04] you know you're trapped
[1:01:06] uh
[1:01:07] in you know i don't know you feel like
[1:01:09] you're a boy
[1:01:13] what nonsense
[1:01:16] god made a boy a boy
[1:01:19] maid a girl a girl how can
[1:01:22] you suddenly start feeling like oh i'm a
[1:01:25] girl trapped in a boy's body
[1:01:29] that is a perversion
[1:01:32] right from the pits of hell
[1:01:35] oh i know it's not popular
[1:01:37] our kids now are facing these spirits
[1:01:41] when i was in school just
[1:01:42] a few years ago
[1:01:46] we didn't hear these things
[1:01:48] my daughter she went to register for
[1:01:50] middle school
[1:01:52] and we went to
[1:01:54] uh to tour the school just before they
[1:01:56] closed
[1:01:57] in june
[1:01:59] and when we walked in the building
[1:02:01] the first thing that i saw was a table
[1:02:04] spread out
[1:02:05] and the material on that table was about
[1:02:08] homosexuality
[1:02:11] right at the forefront
[1:02:13] because this is the agenda of the enemy
[1:02:16] to start programming the minds of these
[1:02:19] young children to believe that if you
[1:02:21] are a a girl and feeling trapped
[1:02:26] sorry a boy feeling trapped in a girl's
[1:02:28] body or vice versa
[1:02:30] you have the right
[1:02:31] to change
[1:02:34] that is a direct insult on the creator
[1:02:36] himself
[1:02:41] you cannot change you might change this
[1:02:43] form and do
[1:02:45] surgery and
[1:02:46] whatever science can touch
[1:02:48] but the spirit
[1:02:51] no man can change that spirit because
[1:02:54] that came from god
[1:02:57] is that right
[1:02:58] so how can a man tell me
[1:03:01] that you have a right to change what god
[1:03:04] created
[1:03:07] you are literally insulting god in his
[1:03:10] face
[1:03:10] when you feel that you can do all these
[1:03:12] things
[1:03:13] is that
[1:03:14] right satan comes to pervert
[1:03:18] the original
[1:03:20] let's take another example
[1:03:22] in jeremiah 17 verse 7 and 8.
[1:03:26] i'm just showing you two scriptural
[1:03:28] examples so that you can see
[1:03:32] where all these demon powers are coming
[1:03:34] from
[1:03:37] verse 7 it says blessed is the man
[1:03:40] that trusted in the lord
[1:03:42] and whose hope the lord is
[1:03:46] for he
[1:03:48] listen to this very carefully
[1:03:50] for he
[1:03:52] that's now representing christ
[1:03:54] shall be as a tree
[1:03:57] planted by the waters
[1:04:01] and that spread it out listen
[1:04:04] her roots
[1:04:06] by the river
[1:04:09] so a tree
[1:04:16] that is both male
[1:04:18] and female
[1:04:20] how does that make sense it says he
[1:04:22] shall be as a tree
[1:04:24] but her roots
[1:04:30] you see without
[1:04:32] spiritual understanding we can take
[1:04:35] these scriptures here
[1:04:37] to serve our means
[1:04:39] all right
[1:04:41] but
[1:04:42] the bible was written
[1:04:44] and that's why jesus said that father i
[1:04:46] thank you
[1:04:47] that you have hid these things from the
[1:04:49] wise and prudent and revealed it's unto
[1:04:52] babes such as would learn because many
[1:04:54] times
[1:04:55] the bible has compound meanings
[1:04:58] and god has a way of hiding himself in
[1:05:01] the scriptures
[1:05:03] now he
[1:05:04] is representing christ
[1:05:07] okay
[1:05:08] her is representing
[1:05:10] the bride church
[1:05:12] because jesus said in saying john 15
[1:05:14] says i am the vine and ye are what
[1:05:18] the branches
[1:05:21] now does that make jesus a pervert
[1:05:25] no
[1:05:26] no
[1:05:28] but you see when we take things out of
[1:05:29] context
[1:05:31] we can use the scriptures
[1:05:33] and we try and
[1:05:34] justify this perverted onslaught of
[1:05:38] satan in his last days
[1:05:41] jesus says i am the vine and ye are the
[1:05:44] branches
[1:05:45] husband and wife
[1:05:47] just like it was in the beginning so god
[1:05:50] is constantly representing himself
[1:05:53] he has he the male part and then you the
[1:05:55] church male
[1:05:57] female male female working on the body
[1:06:00] okay
[1:06:04] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[1:06:07] same bringing forth much fruit
[1:06:10] for without me
[1:06:12] ye can do nothing
[1:06:14] so he the male is the one that
[1:06:17] energizes the branches
[1:06:20] his life is the one that flows through
[1:06:22] the body
[1:06:24] that's why we cannot do anything on our
[1:06:26] own
[1:06:29] jesus said in my own self i can do
[1:06:32] nothing
[1:06:33] and so it is with us without him we can
[1:06:36] do nothing
[1:06:38] amen so satan takes these types and
[1:06:41] shadows and he perverts them to
[1:06:43] accomplish his means
[1:06:45] listen to some of the these
[1:06:47] modern names which honestly
[1:06:50] i i learned a lot of
[1:06:51] about i learned about these names in the
[1:06:53] last two years
[1:06:55] and i'm going to read some of them to
[1:06:56] you
[1:07:02] agender
[1:07:05] or gender fluid
[1:07:07] i just learned about this like this year
[1:07:11] non-binary
[1:07:15] pan gender queer or questioning i didn't
[1:07:19] even know that exists
[1:07:22] transgender two spirits
[1:07:26] where does two spirit come from
[1:07:38] jesus said
[1:07:39] as it was in days of lord
[1:07:43] luke 17 28 to 32.
[1:07:46] actually just pull it up for me please
[1:07:48] if you don't mind i want to read that
[1:07:51] luke 17 28 32.
[1:07:57] it says likewise
[1:07:59] also as it was in the days of lot
[1:08:02] now we all know what happened
[1:08:04] in the days of lord
[1:08:06] god burnt that city
[1:08:10] because of sodomy
[1:08:15] he says they did eat
[1:08:17] they drank they bought they sold they
[1:08:20] planted they build it the next verse
[1:08:24] but
[1:08:25] the same day that lord went out of sodom
[1:08:29] it rained fire
[1:08:31] and brimstone
[1:08:32] from heaven
[1:08:34] and destroyed all
[1:08:40] even thus
[1:08:41] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:08:44] man is revealed the next one
[1:08:49] in that day
[1:08:51] he we shall be up
[1:08:54] skip to okay just leave it there let me
[1:08:56] read that in that day he which shall be
[1:08:59] upon the house stop and his staff in the
[1:09:01] house let him not come down and take it
[1:09:05] away
[1:09:06] and he that is in the field let him
[1:09:09] likewise not return back the next one
[1:09:12] there we go
[1:09:13] remember
[1:09:15] lot's wife
[1:09:17] now i'm just going to recap briefly what
[1:09:20] happened in the days of lord
[1:09:21] basically
[1:09:23] it was a time when god came down himself
[1:09:26] because the the sins of sodom and
[1:09:28] gomorrah
[1:09:29] had come to a place where god says i
[1:09:32] need to come down now
[1:09:34] and investigate what's happening on the
[1:09:36] earth and with him there was two angels
[1:09:40] okay
[1:09:41] and when those two angels came
[1:09:43] one angel went to visit abraham
[1:09:46] and the two went to visit lord
[1:09:48] and when those two angels were coming to
[1:09:50] lord's house
[1:09:52] the bible says and the men of the city
[1:09:53] they saw these angels
[1:09:57] and they desire to have them
[1:10:00] i hope you're spiritual enough to
[1:10:01] understand what what i'm saying
[1:10:03] they wanted to live with this man
[1:10:06] imagine
[1:10:08] angels have come from heaven
[1:10:11] and these people were so perverted
[1:10:14] that they could not even recognize when
[1:10:16] the supernatural was taking place
[1:10:19] and they desired lot to release those
[1:10:21] men so that they can live with them
[1:10:24] well let's just summarize what happened
[1:10:29] the angels told lord says lord hurry up
[1:10:31] and leave this place right away
[1:10:33] because the judgments of god are fixing
[1:10:36] to strike this city
[1:10:39] all right
[1:10:40] god destroyed sodom and gomorrah because
[1:10:43] of homosexuality and all these sexual
[1:10:46] perversions that's the height that it
[1:10:48] had reached
[1:10:49] so jesus is saying as it was in that
[1:10:52] time
[1:10:53] so shall it be in the day when the son
[1:10:55] of man is being revealed
[1:10:57] and if you want to know what happened in
[1:10:59] the days of lot just look around you
[1:11:02] just look around you
[1:11:04] the bible is interpreting itself right
[1:11:07] before our very eyes
[1:11:09] if you want to know what the days of
[1:11:10] noah look like look around you
[1:11:13] people mocking the gospel
[1:11:16] saying these are just a bunch of crazy
[1:11:18] people
[1:11:19] fanatics oh we might not be popular in
[1:11:21] the world but it was only noah and his
[1:11:24] family who was saved
[1:11:26] so god is not coming for the majority
[1:11:29] all right
[1:11:31] and
[1:11:32] jesus says remember
[1:11:35] lord's wife
[1:11:36] you know what lord's wife did she
[1:11:38] actually started on a journey
[1:11:40] she was going going with her family
[1:11:43] but her heart
[1:11:45] was there
[1:11:47] and the angels had said don't look back
[1:11:50] so as she was going you see
[1:11:53] god help us some of us we have actually
[1:11:55] started this journey we are literally
[1:11:58] in motion doing what god wants us to do
[1:12:01] but because our hearts are still back in
[1:12:03] the world she turned to look
[1:12:06] and god made a memorial
[1:12:08] of what happened at that moment
[1:12:10] turned her into a pillar of salt and
[1:12:12] jesus says remember
[1:12:15] lost wife
[1:12:16] so this is not
[1:12:18] a playing game if you're going to serve
[1:12:20] jesus go all the way
[1:12:24] don't don't say well i'll just try
[1:12:26] because you're treading on dangerous
[1:12:28] grounds
[1:12:29] amen it's either i'm in with jesus or
[1:12:33] i'm out
[1:12:35] hallelujah
[1:12:36] god wants your heart in this and that's
[1:12:39] the mistake lord's wife made and jesus
[1:12:42] is saying in fact
[1:12:44] the bible even gives her gives this
[1:12:47] that verse
[1:12:49] a single line
[1:12:51] so that it sticks out it's not mixed up
[1:12:53] with anything else says remember lord's
[1:12:56] wife and that is just one verse for
[1:12:58] everybody to see
[1:13:02] and i believe the church of god
[1:13:05] is being warned
[1:13:08] because
[1:13:09] jesus said that he that will put his
[1:13:11] hand to the plow
[1:13:14] okay
[1:13:15] and turn back is not worthy
[1:13:18] so we've got to remember lord's wife
[1:13:21] under the conditions that we're seeing
[1:13:22] today
[1:13:25] god help us
[1:13:28] i wonder if
[1:13:30] the lord terrorists for another 10-15
[1:13:32] years
[1:13:33] we have small kids
[1:13:36] eliot
[1:13:37] felix and so forth
[1:13:44] brother brown in his time he spoke of
[1:13:46] rebecca
[1:13:47] and his heart cried out he says lord
[1:13:50] does my rebecca have to live and see all
[1:13:52] this that was
[1:13:55] years ago
[1:13:57] probably over 50 years now
[1:13:59] and his heart was crying out because of
[1:14:01] what he was seeing at the time now
[1:14:03] imagine for us parents
[1:14:06] who have our children being taught these
[1:14:07] things in school
[1:14:11] the only thing that i can see is the
[1:14:13] coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:16] to save us from this perversion of the
[1:14:18] last days
[1:14:20] and all parents
[1:14:21] we need to flee to the cross
[1:14:24] we need to be at the altar crying for
[1:14:27] god to help us
[1:14:29] to give us wisdom to know how to
[1:14:30] navigate through these dangerous times
[1:14:33] because it's not easy
[1:14:35] some of them these are topics that you
[1:14:37] should not even be discussing their
[1:14:39] minds
[1:14:40] cannot take it
[1:14:42] they are not built to understand these
[1:14:44] things but yet the enemy is already
[1:14:47] bombarding their minds with this
[1:14:50] oh my god have mercy on us
[1:14:59] hallelujah
[1:15:02] the spirit of pornography
[1:15:07] you will be shocked
[1:15:08] how many
[1:15:12] believers in this message in this let me
[1:15:15] say christianity
[1:15:16] are bound
[1:15:18] by the spirit
[1:15:21] and i ain't talking about
[1:15:22] just single brothers
[1:15:25] even men who are married
[1:15:28] come in prayer lines and they confess
[1:15:31] pornography being bound by that spirit
[1:15:36] you know why
[1:15:39] when a smartphone came out
[1:15:41] oh it sounded
[1:15:43] fabulous
[1:15:45] you could now browse on the internet
[1:15:47] go on youtube
[1:15:49] and go into a private world
[1:15:52] you know before it was tv
[1:15:54] you put it there and everybody can see
[1:15:56] what's going on
[1:15:59] but now
[1:16:01] satan became smart
[1:16:03] and even called it the smartphone
[1:16:06] and he makes sure that everybody has one
[1:16:10] to the extent that
[1:16:12] you know my wife forgot her phone at
[1:16:14] home when we're driving she remembered
[1:16:16] but
[1:16:17] even myself sometimes i forget my phone
[1:16:19] at home
[1:16:20] where's my phone
[1:16:22] we are so
[1:16:23] attached
[1:16:25] so attached to our phone that it seems
[1:16:27] like we can't breathe without it
[1:16:30] but how about the bible when you don't
[1:16:32] read your bible
[1:16:33] every single day
[1:16:34] how do you feel
[1:16:36] lord i'm detached what happened where
[1:16:39] you know but the phone
[1:16:41] we breathe and we live with it because
[1:16:44] it's our world satan call it the
[1:16:47] smartphone
[1:16:48] you know why so that
[1:16:50] you you can be in your bedroom
[1:16:52] there's no mommy no daddy no husband no
[1:16:54] wife you can even lock it
[1:16:57] you know secure it so that in case your
[1:16:59] wife or husband finds it they have no
[1:17:01] access so you have this private world
[1:17:04] where you can go deep into all these
[1:17:06] things
[1:17:08] and you just
[1:17:09] fill your mind and watch anything you
[1:17:12] want and nobody seems to know what to
[1:17:14] know what you what you're doing but i
[1:17:16] have news for you
[1:17:18] he's watching
[1:17:20] he knows the very thoughts and the
[1:17:22] intents of our hearts
[1:17:25] you know we should come to a place where
[1:17:28] we are so in love with god
[1:17:32] that it's not oh who is watching me but
[1:17:35] lord
[1:17:36] i am are you pleased with what i'm doing
[1:17:38] because there's an all-seeing eye
[1:17:41] and
[1:17:43] when you know that god is watching every
[1:17:45] move that you make
[1:17:47] you are careful what you do
[1:17:49] and you don't do it because of legalism
[1:17:52] you do it because of love
[1:17:54] so pornography
[1:17:55] it's it's it's it's it's gotten a grip
[1:17:58] of so many men today
[1:18:01] and it has destroyed so many marriages
[1:18:04] now
[1:18:06] pornography and lust they're really the
[1:18:08] same spirits
[1:18:10] people think that when they get married
[1:18:13] or find a partner that those last
[1:18:16] spirits will be taken care of no
[1:18:18] no
[1:18:19] a last spirit is the last spirit
[1:18:21] david had how many wives
[1:18:29] solomon his son had how many
[1:18:31] a thousand
[1:18:33] but even david with his 500
[1:18:36] he wasn't content he went and took
[1:18:37] bathsheba
[1:18:39] the bible says that solomon he loves
[1:18:41] strange women
[1:18:47] i'm talking a bit plain next forgive me
[1:18:49] today
[1:18:50] but these are the spirits that are
[1:18:51] plaguing
[1:18:52] a lot of people call themselves
[1:18:54] christians
[1:18:55] and a lost spirit does not end
[1:18:58] when you come to the altar and you take
[1:19:00] your beautiful bride or your handsome
[1:19:02] husband and you think it's over oh no
[1:19:05] if you're bound by that spirit you've
[1:19:07] got to get delivered
[1:19:10] because it will plague you
[1:19:12] it will affect your marriage
[1:19:14] and it's just a matter of time
[1:19:16] and you'll see the manifestation of it
[1:19:19] amen
[1:19:20] oh my god have mercy
[1:19:25] flee to christ
[1:19:27] because there is no way to escape
[1:19:31] the demonic
[1:19:32] powers that have been released upon the
[1:19:34] earth today young people hear my voice
[1:19:37] today flee to christ know him in the
[1:19:41] power of his resurrection
[1:19:43] know him as your personal savior forget
[1:19:46] about just knowing you come to church
[1:19:47] that's good
[1:19:49] we would that more people came to church
[1:19:50] but
[1:19:51] without knowing him
[1:19:53] what's the use
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:56] we want to possess every gate of the
[1:19:58] enemy
[1:20:02] glory oh my time really flies i want to
[1:20:05] start winding down with this story of
[1:20:07] david and goliath
[1:20:09] you know i preached this last sunday at
[1:20:12] our youth we had a youth
[1:20:14] service
[1:20:15] and
[1:20:17] i mean the lord really blessed
[1:20:19] us
[1:20:22] you know when you see the spirit of
[1:20:24] revival coming among the young people
[1:20:26] you just have to thank god
[1:20:28] because
[1:20:29] we need to see god among our young
[1:20:32] people
[1:20:33] amen and so i'm just going to touch on a
[1:20:35] few things that i spoke on concerning
[1:20:38] david
[1:20:40] and i'm going to use uh first samuel 17.
[1:20:44] okay we're just going to go a bit slow
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:46] talk on some points
[1:20:49] now this is david
[1:20:51] going to meet
[1:20:52] to visit his brothers in the battlefield
[1:20:56] he says and jesse said unto david his
[1:20:58] son
[1:20:59] he says take now for thy brethren an
[1:21:02] effort
[1:21:04] of this perched corn
[1:21:06] and these ten loaves and run not just
[1:21:08] walk but run
[1:21:10] to the camp of thy brethren because the
[1:21:12] message is urgent and i believe that's
[1:21:14] the message today we've got to run
[1:21:17] okay we have no time to keep walking and
[1:21:19] just taking our time
[1:21:21] run
[1:21:22] and carry this 10 jesus onto the captain
[1:21:25] of the thousand and look how thy
[1:21:29] brethren fare
[1:21:31] and take their pledge
[1:21:36] verse 19
[1:21:40] now
[1:21:41] saul and they
[1:21:43] and all the men of israel were in the
[1:21:45] valley of elah
[1:21:47] fighting with the philistines
[1:21:51] and david rose up early in the morning i
[1:21:53] like that
[1:21:54] because you see urgent matters require
[1:22:00] like
[1:22:01] you know
[1:22:02] you've got to be urgent about what you
[1:22:03] do
[1:22:05] the bible says a little sleep a little
[1:22:07] slumber
[1:22:08] you know it says you will become a poor
[1:22:11] man poverty will
[1:22:12] will catch up with you you just want to
[1:22:14] sleep all the time and be lazy no he
[1:22:17] woke up early in the morning and he took
[1:22:19] off and he left the ship with a keeper
[1:22:22] listen and took
[1:22:24] and went as jesse just as his dad had
[1:22:28] commanded him
[1:22:30] okay
[1:22:32] so he was not going
[1:22:35] on his own accord he did not just decide
[1:22:37] well let me go the father sent him
[1:22:41] jesus said
[1:22:43] therefore as the father sent me so send
[1:22:46] i you
[1:22:47] so we are also under commandment to go
[1:22:51] because our brothers are at war
[1:22:54] some of them are under captivity we need
[1:22:56] to go like brother dale was speaking
[1:22:58] yesterday
[1:22:59] talking about the need to go and preach
[1:23:01] the gospel
[1:23:03] because there are those who are bound
[1:23:04] they need deliverance
[1:23:06] see and he came to the trench as the
[1:23:08] host was going forth to fight
[1:23:11] and shout for the battle
[1:23:14] okay
[1:23:15] for israel and the philistines had put
[1:23:17] the battle in a rape army against army
[1:23:23] and david left his courage
[1:23:25] in the hand of the keeper of the courage
[1:23:30] and ran
[1:23:32] into the army
[1:23:34] he did not just walk he ran
[1:23:38] and came and saluted his brethren
[1:23:42] and as he talked with them
[1:23:44] behold they came up
[1:23:46] the
[1:23:47] champion
[1:23:52] the champion
[1:23:56] the philistine of gath goliath by name
[1:24:02] out of the armies of the philistines and
[1:24:04] speak according to the same words and
[1:24:06] david heard it
[1:24:08] big mistake
[1:24:11] this time
[1:24:12] goliath uttered words
[1:24:15] and it landed
[1:24:17] in the ears of the wrong man
[1:24:22] i pray to god that
[1:24:26] you will be that david today
[1:24:29] who will hear
[1:24:32] all this nonsense that the enemy is
[1:24:33] spewing out
[1:24:38] and change the story around the bible
[1:24:40] says that the champion but goliath was
[1:24:43] not no champion
[1:24:46] and we're going to see
[1:24:48] david's attitude towards him
[1:24:51] and all the men of israel when they saw
[1:24:53] the man
[1:24:54] fled from him and was so afraid fear
[1:24:58] right there
[1:25:00] brother branham said one of the greatest
[1:25:02] things plaguing the church is the spirit
[1:25:04] of fear
[1:25:06] people don't know who they are i'm going
[1:25:08] to be closing shortly
[1:25:10] and the man of israel said have you seen
[1:25:13] this man
[1:25:14] that has come up
[1:25:17] surely to defile
[1:25:19] defy israel
[1:25:20] verse 26 i'll just jump
[1:25:23] and david spake to the man that stood by
[1:25:25] him saying
[1:25:26] what shall be done to the man that
[1:25:28] killeth this listen that was david's
[1:25:30] attitude
[1:25:31] to david this was just
[1:25:33] this philistine not the champion
[1:25:36] because we only have one champion and
[1:25:39] that is the lord jesus christ
[1:25:41] amen he is the champion
[1:25:44] of our warfare
[1:25:46] he's the champion of our lives
[1:25:48] golett is just another philistine and
[1:25:51] that's the way david saw him as just
[1:25:53] this philistine
[1:25:56] hallelujah
[1:25:59] for who
[1:26:00] is this
[1:26:01] uncircumcised philistine he didn't say
[1:26:04] who is this champion
[1:26:06] so we've got to change our talk many
[1:26:08] times we give glory to the devil
[1:26:11] oh the devil did this oh the devil did
[1:26:13] that oh the devil is no no no no what
[1:26:16] about god
[1:26:17] what has jesus done for you today
[1:26:19] yesterday last week that you can talk
[1:26:22] about his goodness
[1:26:24] amen we need to testify about what he is
[1:26:26] doing for us
[1:26:28] you know people come to a place where
[1:26:32] we're so used to what the devil does to
[1:26:34] us
[1:26:35] i'm feeling sick
[1:26:36] oh my head hurts oh my this my that and
[1:26:39] it's always what the devil is doing you
[1:26:41] might not say that way but you see out
[1:26:43] of your mouth what you confess
[1:26:46] you are glorifying either god or the
[1:26:48] enemy so the prophet says that even if
[1:26:51] you feel pain say by your stripes i am
[1:26:54] healed
[1:26:55] you're feeling
[1:26:57] weak say i am strong let the wick say i
[1:26:59] am strong
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:02] thank
[1:27:03] oh my
[1:27:06] verse 28 i want to jump real quick
[1:27:09] and elia his eldest brother heard when
[1:27:11] he spake unto the man
[1:27:13] and eliab's anger was kindled against
[1:27:16] david
[1:27:17] and he said why has thou come either now
[1:27:20] watch
[1:27:21] this is his eldest brother
[1:27:24] the one who should be an example to him
[1:27:26] he's asking this question what are you
[1:27:28] doing here
[1:27:29] david
[1:27:32] and with whom has thou left those few
[1:27:34] sheep
[1:27:35] look at his attitude despising attitude
[1:27:38] just those few sheep
[1:27:40] all right
[1:27:44] oh but who are you you just have a small
[1:27:46] congregation like what are you
[1:27:49] you know those attitudes exist in a
[1:27:50] message
[1:27:52] if you don't have a big church well
[1:27:55] just look look what he's got just a few
[1:27:57] sheep
[1:28:01] devils
[1:28:04] the same spirits are still here today
[1:28:09] despising attitudes
[1:28:11] instead of saying we are brothers god
[1:28:13] has given you 20 has given this one a
[1:28:15] hundred
[1:28:16] we are brothers we are all working for
[1:28:18] the kingdom of god
[1:28:20] what do numbers have to do with this
[1:28:22] nothing
[1:28:24] absolutely nothing
[1:28:26] it's the quality of the spirit that
[1:28:28] we're aiming aiming for all right
[1:28:31] and watch
[1:28:32] he says i know by pride
[1:28:36] oh i know i just want to be another big
[1:28:38] minister known in the message that's why
[1:28:40] you're doing what you're doing
[1:28:44] just trying to make a name for yourself
[1:28:47] i know thy pride this was david's elder
[1:28:50] brother the one who shall be there to
[1:28:53] encourage him and say brother you have
[1:28:55] come you brought food join us in battle
[1:28:58] let's fight together
[1:29:00] hallelujah
[1:29:02] and the naughtiness of thine heart
[1:29:10] first to the one i'm going to jump
[1:29:13] and when the words were heard which
[1:29:15] david spake
[1:29:17] they rehearsed them before saul
[1:29:21] and he sent for him that's one of the
[1:29:23] best things to me that saul did
[1:29:27] one of the best things that he did
[1:29:29] you know i can imagine when
[1:29:31] those soldiers came to saul and says you
[1:29:34] know sir
[1:29:37] i got news for you
[1:29:39] great king
[1:29:40] you won't believe who just came
[1:29:43] there's this little young boy
[1:29:45] who just showed up and he's talking of
[1:29:47] killing the goliath i mean this this
[1:29:48] this uh this uh
[1:29:51] this philistine here
[1:29:53] and i could imagine how they rehearsed
[1:29:54] all the words to him and described how
[1:29:57] the bible says he was he was ruddy and
[1:30:00] unfair to look upon probably like a sexy
[1:30:02] looking type of a boy in other words
[1:30:04] what's what's in him what can he do
[1:30:07] they rehearsed all of this to saul but
[1:30:09] saul was wise enough he said and he sent
[1:30:12] for him perhaps the best thing that saul
[1:30:14] did
[1:30:17] and when he came to saul well saul said
[1:30:19] well
[1:30:20] i i admire your courage young man
[1:30:23] i really do but
[1:30:25] why don't you take my armor and try to
[1:30:28] try what what i got
[1:30:30] and david
[1:30:32] tried it on put it on it says no no no
[1:30:34] no no
[1:30:36] take this off of me this has not been
[1:30:38] proven that's what the bible says david
[1:30:40] said it had not been proven so we want
[1:30:43] to go with what we know
[1:30:45] we want to meet the enemy with the
[1:30:47] things that has been proven and to close
[1:30:50] the bible says when dave was going to
[1:30:52] face goliath he took five smooth stones
[1:30:56] i like that
[1:30:57] smooth stones well rounded no rough
[1:31:00] edges
[1:31:01] you know that's a type of perfect faith
[1:31:04] and the bible says that he took one not
[1:31:06] two but one stone and he swung that
[1:31:09] stone with his slingshot and when he
[1:31:11] released it
[1:31:12] one stone is what was used to kill the
[1:31:15] enemy
[1:31:16] we don't need to be
[1:31:18] running all over the place and doing all
[1:31:21] kinds of crazy stuff just take your
[1:31:24] simple faith in god
[1:31:26] so long as it's well-rounded no rough
[1:31:28] ages your life is is right with god
[1:31:30] everything is smooth release that one
[1:31:33] hallelujah
[1:31:34] and you will see this enemy this
[1:31:36] philistine come down before your very
[1:31:38] eyes hallelujah how many today want to
[1:31:42] possess the gate of the enemy
[1:31:45] i do
[1:31:46] i trust that
[1:31:47] you
[1:31:49] have come to a place in your life where
[1:31:52] you want to see god manifest himself in
[1:31:55] such a way that he's real
[1:31:58] when you talk about him people can see
[1:32:00] christ in you
[1:32:02] when you live
[1:32:04] people can see christ in you
[1:32:06] hallelujah
[1:32:08] do you love him
[1:32:09] do you appreciate him
[1:32:11] are you ready to possess every gate of
[1:32:14] the enemy
