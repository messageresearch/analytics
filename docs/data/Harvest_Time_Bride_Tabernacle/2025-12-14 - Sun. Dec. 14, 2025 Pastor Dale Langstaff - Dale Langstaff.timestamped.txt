[23:39] Hey,
[24:29] praise. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we thank
[24:33] and praise you for the words of this
[24:35] song. Lord, we know your Bible says that
[24:38] you put our sins in the sea of
[24:40] forgetfulness.
[24:42] We also know that it was if we had
[24:45] justified us, as if the real us had
[24:48] never did it in the first place. Lord
[24:51] God, we praise you and thank you for
[24:53] this great, great revelation. Amazing
[24:56] grace.
[24:58] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. We
[25:01] love you, Lord God. Be with many, many
[25:03] are out, Lord God. be with them and
[25:05] touch them, Lord God, and keep them safe
[25:08] and bless the ones that could make it
[25:10] here, Lord God. And may you be in our
[25:12] midst, Lord God. And any that would be
[25:14] watching online. May you be with them,
[25:17] Lord God. And may everything be done
[25:20] according to your predestinated word,
[25:22] according to your predestinated will.
[25:25] And may it be pleasing in your sight. We
[25:27] pray
[25:29] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[25:33] Let's sing that song. We sang last week.
[25:35] Come let us adore him. Oh, come Heat.
[25:48] Heat.
[26:05] Heat.
[26:10] Heat.
[26:23] Yeah.
[26:26] Heat.
[26:37] Oh,
[27:06] all Praise. Amen. That's our prayer
[27:08] desire.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Not just today, but daily come.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Let us adore him for he's the only one
[27:16] completely the only.
[27:20] It's just so good to be here. God bless
[27:23] you. Bless you for being able to come
[27:25] and there possibly might still on but we
[27:30] just are happy that you're here. Amen.
[27:32] Thank you, Julie. Beautiful special.
[27:34] Very beautiful.
[27:37] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. You
[27:41] musicians and Jared, thank you for doing
[27:43] the yard. And
[27:45] Amen. Also, just before we read our
[27:48] scripture, um just uh keep Ben Norrod in
[27:52] your prayers. He having surgery this
[27:54] morning. Uh his appendix
[27:58] uh took him. So, he was in the hospital
[28:01] and he's having emergency surgery this
[28:02] morning. So, uh, just praise God that it
[28:05] never happened. Last weekend he was in
[28:07] El Salvador and
[28:11] that would have been a bit tricky. We're
[28:13] on the airplane.
[28:15] Wow.
[28:17] Wow. God is good. Amen. Just a just a
[28:20] short really short testimony if anybody
[28:23] wanted to link. Brother Ben, I listened
[28:26] to three of his services there in El
[28:27] Salvador. It's where we've been the last
[28:29] two years. It's uh brother Jose Garcia's
[28:33] home country
[28:35] and brother Brand or brother Ben
[28:37] preached on humility and arrogancy on
[28:40] Sunday. The last of what we've been
[28:43] preached on for four weeks. I mean God
[28:45] God is just amazing. Amen. Amen.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to let's turn in our
[28:52] scripture. God bless you.
[28:54] Proverbs 16 uh 16:2
[28:57] and then we're going to read another
[28:58] scripture in Matthew.
[29:01] Proverbs 16:2. Amen. And we want to look
[29:04] at something unique this morning that I
[29:08] believe God has something to show us.
[29:12] All the ways of a man
[29:15] are clean in his own eyes,
[29:19] but the Lord weighth
[29:21] the spirits.
[29:25] That That's good for me, too.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Everything I do, I think, is okay.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; But God
[29:33] &gt;&gt; judges me by his spirit.
[29:37] That's a that's a powerful powerful
[29:40] verse.
[29:41] Yes.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; And let's read Matthew 26 and start at
[29:45] verse 20.
[29:50] It's talking about
[29:54] Jesus here. And just before he goes to
[29:56] the cross,
[29:59] Matthew 26
[30:02] and 20. And now when evening was come,
[30:06] Jesus sat down with the twel.
[30:10] And as they did eat, he said,
[30:14] "Verily I say unto you,
[30:18] that one of you shall betray me."
[30:24] And this is the verse
[30:32] that really struck
[30:38] and made this message. Amen.
[30:42] And the 12 disciples were exceedingly
[30:46] sorrowful
[30:48] and began to ask everyone of them,
[30:52] saying unto Jesus,
[30:55] Lord,
[30:57] is it I?
[30:59] Lord God, I pray that you will
[31:03] &gt;&gt; help us this morning.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may you have complete and
[31:08] total control. Lord, I surrender myself
[31:10] completely
[31:12] and Lord, you just have your way
[31:15] completely
[31:17] with the hearer and the speaker both.
[31:19] Jesus, we pray.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I
[31:25] want to just let that sink into your
[31:27] heart. Those two scriptures that we read
[31:31] are powerful scriptures.
[31:33] And they began to say
[31:37] unto Jesus,
[31:40] Lord,
[31:43] is it I?
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[31:50] All through the Bible, the scriptures
[31:52] clearly show they had no clue
[31:56] who it was that was going to sell Jesus
[31:59] out.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Now, that blows me away because we know
[32:05] and we just take for granted. And of
[32:07] course, the person that sold Jesus out,
[32:10] it's very easy for me to attack him for
[32:12] selling Jesus out. But I want to bring
[32:15] it back to you again. The disciples,
[32:18] none of them.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Each one of them thought it could have
[32:23] been them
[32:25] over Judas.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, sis. That's a wower.
[32:32] Yeah. Wow.
[32:35] And then we look back. Let's just go
[32:37] back and look at our And we looked at
[32:39] all the ways that I think I am are clean
[32:42] in my eyes.
[32:46] But God
[32:48] weighs the spirit.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can justify everything we do.
[32:56] You I was telling the way in on the way
[32:57] here we've we've done this is this is
[33:00] not in my notes and I'm definitely not
[33:03] preaching about this, but I want I want
[33:04] to share something with you. This is
[33:05] just for me. This ain't for none of you.
[33:09] But over a long period of years,
[33:13] me and God's had a wrestling match over
[33:16] something.
[33:18] And it's amazing how God deals with me
[33:24] and you.
[33:25] And brother Ben said something when he
[33:27] preached on Saturday night in El
[33:28] Salvador. He preached on angels. And I
[33:31] mentioned that last Sunday, how the
[33:32] angels leave the presence of heaven and
[33:34] they come in our midst. And brother
[33:36] Brown mentioned things like this. He
[33:37] said, "If you go someplace that your
[33:39] dove, your guardian angel don't feel
[33:41] welcome,
[33:42] &gt;&gt; it'll wait outside
[33:46] &gt;&gt; cuz it don't go to certain places."
[33:50] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Brother Bam said.
[33:52] And so if the if the dove of the Holy
[33:55] Spirit and the angel wants to come here,
[33:58] he has to be welcome.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's our complete desire bar
[34:05] none. If he ain't here, we might as well
[34:07] slam the door shut because we're okay.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; But that's equally for our house.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; And
[34:21] no one knows how God can deal with the
[34:23] heart of a man. And so this is what God
[34:24] showed me. He said, you know, he said,
[34:27] we have a lot of old videos from World
[34:29] War II, even before World War II.
[34:34] before like really old videos before
[34:37] Satan was as manifested as he is today.
[34:42] But this was just like the Holy Spirit
[34:44] spoke to me. Just
[34:48] as plain as you would ever get it.
[34:50] There's nothing wrong with that TV
[34:52] screen. That's not evil at all. That's
[34:55] like saying this screen's evil.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; This is just That's like saying your
[34:59] computer's evil.
[35:01] But if you're watching something on that
[35:03] screen that you don't believe in or
[35:07] worse yet that I preach against
[35:10] like men kissing other women or nudity
[35:14] or something like that, that angel will
[35:16] never be in your house.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; So I tell you, don't get rid of your
[35:21] screen, but get rid of the things that
[35:24] you don't believe in.
[35:25] Yeah.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; If you got videos there where a man's
[35:29] pitching kissing other women, would your
[35:31] wife be happy with that if that was you?
[35:34] But you'll sit there and giggle at it
[35:38] cuz it's made as a movie and humor
[35:42] &gt;&gt; or anything else
[35:45] of it. You see what I mean?
[35:47] &gt;&gt; It said we don't have to get rid of the
[35:49] the screen. We have to get rid of what
[35:51] we don't believe in.
[35:53] If I preach against nudity and kissing
[35:55] other women and just and dancing with
[35:57] other ladies and I'm watching a video
[36:00] like that with my grandkids, guess what
[36:01] my grandkids are going to do?
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Donna.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; I'm teaching them very well.
[36:08] See, the grandkids read between the
[36:10] lines.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; But in our own eyes, we think, "Oh, I'm
[36:17] I'm these are old to they're 75 years
[36:20] old. These are and those things might
[36:22] even happen, but if you don't promote,
[36:25] if your wife wouldn't be happy with you
[36:26] doing it,
[36:29] &gt;&gt; what are you watching it for?
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to see that, you know.
[36:37] And so, Brother Bram said, now we're
[36:38] just going to stop here and we we ain't
[36:40] got a long message, but just something
[36:42] that is very peculiar. How how Satan and
[36:46] God is very
[36:49] work very uniquely and how God can deal
[36:52] with our hearts, but how Satan can trick
[36:54] us. And I I'm going to show you some
[36:56] things that you're okay with, but I'm
[36:58] going to show you some things that
[36:59] you're not okay with, and they're the
[37:01] same.
[37:03] They're the same. And it'll it'll shock
[37:05] you. Brother Bam said, "I'm saying what
[37:07] God said. I'm responsible for preaching
[37:09] it." I should read this quote every
[37:12] time, "But God holds you responsible for
[37:14] the way you handle it. I'm just
[37:16] responsible for preaching God's word. If
[37:19] you don't like it or don't agree with it
[37:21] or it it's not your belief, that's okay
[37:23] with me. It don't matter. It won't
[37:25] change who I am or who God is." Well,
[37:27] definitely won't change who God is.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; It might change me, but it won't change
[37:30] God.
[37:34] You see, a man, our next quote there, if
[37:37] a man is born of the spirit of God, he
[37:40] becomes a son of God and his nature
[37:44] is exactly like God's. Now, we're going
[37:47] to watch this. The nature,
[37:51] I love that. The nature is like God.
[37:54] What God is, you are.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; God's holy, you're holy. God's just,
[38:03] you're just, God's long-suffering. Oh, I
[38:06] know, brother D.
[38:09] You're longsuffering.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; If God gives grace where you would give
[38:13] judgment, your nature, oh, you got to
[38:16] kirk that part.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I'm going to shock you all.
[38:22] We're living in a world and a time of
[38:25] grace.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace is on the earth right now.
[38:31] That's why God hasn't come back in the
[38:32] second coming yet. It's amazing grace
[38:35] because God has some stuff yet to take
[38:38] care of.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. The nature of God. See,
[38:45] God's nature. Oh, they say, "Oh, would
[38:52] you have the nature of God and you're a
[38:54] sheep?
[38:56] You don't have to be asked to bear wool.
[39:00] You don't have to manufacture wool. You
[39:02] don't have to say, you know, I better
[39:03] get busy bearing wool because my
[39:07] master's going to want some wool.
[39:10] And if you're a child of God,
[39:13] you don't have to think about being a
[39:14] child of God. You just are a child of
[39:16] God. You just you just you just you just
[39:20] are what you are. You know, I wanted to
[39:22] show you something. Those are the
[39:24] greatest people to be around because
[39:26] they're not fake.
[39:28] They're not two-faced. They won't stab
[39:31] you. They are exactly how you are when
[39:33] you surprise them in front of you,
[39:35] behind you, and when you're not there.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; They're real, genuine, just people. I'm
[39:42] I'm just I'm I'm just having a bad day
[39:44] today and I'm a bad day in front of you
[39:46] and I'm a bad day when you go home and
[39:47] I'm still a bad day. Yeah,
[39:51] &gt;&gt; those people everybody loves
[39:55] &gt;&gt; because we would say it in modern
[39:58] terminology, they're genuine.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; They're real.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; They're not phonies.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; They're not hypocrites.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; A hypocrite is when you would do
[40:15] something in your house that you
[40:17] wouldn't do in the house of God.
[40:21] like watch a movie
[40:24] of people in bikinis or something.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; That's not entertainment.
[40:31] That's a sin
[40:34] if you're a child of God.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how this is. So watch here.
[40:42] He said with the ne our next quote he
[40:44] said, "And you can't make a man see the
[40:47] word of God
[40:49] until his nature
[40:52] is changed."
[40:54] I can preach on something that's
[40:56] directly out of the Bible just like a
[40:59] hundred million times, but there's lots
[41:02] of churches that don't see different
[41:05] parts of the Bible. You know what I
[41:07] mean? Like, and and I know it has to
[41:09] dovetail in that, but you know, you know
[41:11] what I mean? like different se they'll
[41:13] dwell on you know you you shouldn't
[41:15] borrow money or this one will dwell on
[41:17] you should do this and and that's those
[41:21] are all the word of God but like they
[41:22] can be manufactured
[41:25] segments of God's word but we want to
[41:27] take all of God's word and just be it.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; So you can never get a man to see it
[41:34] unless he is it.
[41:36] That's why the Bible says that you must
[41:40] there's one thing that you must. That's
[41:42] you must be born again.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; You don't must come here to church. You
[41:48] don't must there's a lot of must you
[41:50] don't have to do but you must be born
[41:52] again.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; And that is a different nature. And when
[41:56] that nature changes, you won't think
[41:58] about well, you know, like most men
[42:00] would think, well, I'm going to or
[42:01] people would think, well, I'm going to
[42:02] wake up and go to work. It's just
[42:04] nature.
[42:09] Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; And when his nature's changed from what
[42:14] he is to a son of God, the Holy Spirit
[42:16] comes in and the Holy Spirit wrote the
[42:18] word of God. So see, when we would show
[42:22] you any part of the word of God in
[42:24] continuity.
[42:27] So the reason I say that is because part
[42:29] of the Old Testament was wrote under
[42:31] law. We're not under law. We're not
[42:32] under Moses. So, you know, we're under
[42:35] the grace dispensation, but we do use
[42:38] the word the Old Testament. Some people
[42:40] throw it away. I was reading a church's
[42:43] uh uh it don't matter. I was reading a
[42:45] church's uh you know, creed thing. They
[42:48] were they were actually promoting for
[42:50] members and they don't believe in the
[42:52] Old Testament at all.
[42:54] Zero.
[42:56] They don't carry it. They don't read it.
[42:58] There's nothing. But our prophet taught
[43:01] us that the Old Testament is types and
[43:03] shadows to the reality.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; See, God will always bring it different
[43:09] ways because different personalities
[43:13] connect and different ones don't
[43:15] connect. And so God will bring it
[43:18] because God knows that when you get to
[43:20] the judgment or the end, you're never
[43:23] going to say, "Well, God, I never knew
[43:25] or I didn't realize." Because God will
[43:27] say, "Well, I did it here. here here.
[43:30] You know, like the prophet said, from
[43:31] Genesis to Revelation. Well, I showed
[43:33] you in Genesis, this type, and I showed
[43:35] you over here in Leviticus, this type.
[43:37] Then I showed you over here in Isaiah
[43:38] because Isaiah wrote the whole Bible in
[43:40] the 66 books. And then then I showed you
[43:42] over here, and I showed you over here,
[43:43] and then I showed you reality was
[43:45] Christ's life.
[43:47] You said you didn't know. And then on
[43:50] top of that, then he said, I showed you
[43:52] a a bride that was in in flesh. The
[43:55] you're written epistles read of all men.
[43:57] So you could be illiterate and
[43:59] both. And he said, then I showed you the
[44:01] writ the the Bible and flesh
[44:04] and how that nature and flesh operated.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; So God's dependent on you
[44:11] &gt;&gt; because there's people like me that
[44:12] failed grade one, couldn't read
[44:16] &gt;&gt; or there's people that don't never read
[44:18] their Bible. But they still see you in
[44:20] the grocery store.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, so now they still have a Bible.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. You know, you know, in our
[44:31] next one here, he said, you know, if a
[44:33] buzzard was trying to put in dove
[44:34] feathers to make himself a dove, he
[44:37] said, see, it's nature
[44:40] is still a buzzard.
[44:42] He might take a picture if he pulled out
[44:45] all his buzzer feathers. That would
[44:46] really hurt, I think. And stuck in all
[44:48] the dove feathers. That would he would
[44:50] need crazy glue and I think that would
[44:53] be really far out. But he would still be
[44:55] the nature. You know, that's like
[44:56] brother Brown talked about a pig. You
[44:58] can wash the pig, but you just give them
[45:00] some mud.
[45:03] Amen. You know, in the Philippines, it's
[45:05] very hot and most of their pigs, they
[45:08] wash it and you normally they'll sm
[45:10] little trenches out from the p. They
[45:11] literally wash all the waste away just
[45:13] down, you know, wherever they have a
[45:15] spot or whatever. And it's hot and dry
[45:17] and it dries up. But the pigs are
[45:19] spotless,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; but they're not they don't have mud to
[45:23] their excess
[45:26] &gt;&gt; or they wouldn't be spotless. But he
[45:28] said, you take a peacock, he don't have
[45:31] to worry about having peacock feathers.
[45:34] See, if you take the nature of God,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; you don't have to worry about it being a
[45:40] god.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; A peacock
[45:45] will always have peacock feathers.
[45:48] And a dove, you don't have to worry
[45:50] about the feathers of a dove
[45:54] &gt;&gt; because a dove will have dove feathers
[45:57] as long as the nature
[45:59] is a dove.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So we look at this scripture
[46:09] and we see here Judas's scariot
[46:13] walked with Jesus
[46:16] was his disciple.
[46:18] He carried the money bag. Now watch
[46:20] this.
[46:22] Judas's scariot was given power to cast
[46:25] out demons.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Now that just about loses me right
[46:30] there.
[46:34] He was given power to heal the sick.
[46:38] But he and himself,
[46:42] wow,
[46:45] Judas was such a good church member that
[46:48] not one single person in the church
[46:52] and everyone, I believe that was
[46:55] everyone.
[46:56] And every one of them said unto him
[46:58] said, 'Lord,
[47:01] it's Judas.
[47:03] That's what I do. I said, 'Well, Lord,
[47:06] it's that one.
[47:09] But they didn't.
[47:12] He was such a good believer. They said,
[47:14] "Lord, it's me.
[47:19] I'm the one that's going to sell you
[47:21] out.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you something.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Judas was above fault.
[47:37] That's impressive.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Judas was above fault.
[47:51] Brother Bram says here in paragraph 67
[47:55] Vicki
[47:57] he said you know Jesus said in one case
[48:00] he asked the question and I'd like to
[48:03] ask the question
[48:06] to the church tonight
[48:10] and I'd like us to make this personal
[48:12] not we'll all have a different uh we'll
[48:16] all hear something different in this
[48:17] message today.
[48:19] But he said, "Jesus, why why do you call
[48:24] me Lord
[48:26] and do not the things that I command you
[48:29] to do?
[48:32] Why do we call him Lord?"
[48:37] You know, he said, "Why could you call
[48:39] me Lord and keep not my word?"
[48:43] Watch this. Even in your own personal
[48:45] life or your home, your story is
[48:46] different than mine. But I shared my
[48:49] story and anything that stands between
[48:51] you and God is an idol and it takes the
[48:55] place of God. And I want to I want to
[48:58] show you something. I want to call
[48:59] another fellow here and see about him.
[49:03] And he said it was Judas.
[49:06] And he says it's very easy to remember
[49:08] Judas
[49:10] because we remember Judas today
[49:15] is selling out his birthright.
[49:18] We remember Judas as a loser.
[49:22] We remember Judas as
[49:26] selling out our Lord and Savior
[49:29] for personal
[49:32] gain.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[49:36] Oh,
[49:39] and we ridicu
[49:41] Judas.
[49:45] But how many of us,
[49:49] and I would say at some point in time,
[49:50] we all have sold out our Lord
[49:56] for some kind of a personal
[49:59] gain. And we say he was a filthy bad guy
[50:03] and not fit for no place in society.
[50:06] Not fit for heaven. Why? He sold out our
[50:08] Lord and after he had opportunity even
[50:10] to be the disciple. The apostle remember
[50:13] last Sunday I think some of you looked
[50:14] at me funny. Brother Bram said in
[50:16] multiple and he said it more than this.
[50:18] An apostle the highest calling in the
[50:20] Bible
[50:21] &gt;&gt; above a prophet.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that more than once.
[50:27] Judas the Scariot had the opportunity to
[50:29] be an apostle. The highest calling in
[50:32] the Bible.
[50:35] Wow.
[50:37] Higher than a prophet.
[50:40] And he had the opportunity to be that
[50:42] apostle. And he sold out his right
[50:45] for personal
[50:47] gain.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; And now he's remembered for that. And
[50:52] how he's remembered
[50:54] is he's sold out Jesus for personal
[50:57] gain. Watch our next paragraph. And I
[50:59] wonder how many of us
[51:01] of them tonight yet stand here in the
[51:05] pulpit
[51:07] selling out Jesus for personal gain.
[51:11] Yet wear a robe
[51:14] and a fancy yellow tie.
[51:18] Or sing in the choir.
[51:21] or sit as a deacon or take the place of
[51:24] a treasure trustee or whatever it might
[51:27] be,
[51:28] his position in the church or the
[51:31] minister at the pulpit. He repeats that.
[51:33] That sounds dangerous.
[51:35] When brother Brown or the Bible repeats
[51:37] something, it gets me nervous. It was
[51:39] talking about pulpits
[51:42] and is still selling out your
[51:45] opportunity
[51:48] for personal praise.
[51:52] Doctor, bishop, so and so for personal
[51:56] praise and personal
[51:59] gain.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, I I believe that the prophet
[52:04] hit a nerve here because at some point,
[52:07] you know, and I mean, I know we're on a
[52:09] journey and and some of us are past that
[52:11] and some of us are right in the middle
[52:12] of it. But I believe it's the truth.
[52:19] And here here a man came to him and he
[52:21] said I I would preach that but if I was
[52:23] preaching that I would be a beggar on
[52:26] the street.
[52:28] And he said he said watch this. He said,
[52:31] "Do you remember the rich man Lazarus
[52:36] and their last eternal stage that they
[52:38] stood at and the beggar and the rich
[52:41] man, their pitcher one day and he said,
[52:43] "So tonight
[52:48] about Judas, he sold out for personal
[52:50] gain." And so many of us do the same
[52:52] thing. He's talking about the rich young
[52:54] ruler.
[52:56] And here there was the beggar.
[52:59] But when they went to heaven, their
[53:01] positions completely changed. And the
[53:04] rich young ruler got in hell and he came
[53:06] back and he asked Jesus if he could send
[53:09] somebody to save his family and to just
[53:12] bring a drip of water
[53:17] to cool his tongue.
[53:20] He said, "Watch here." He said, "The
[53:21] priest
[53:23] and them, they sold out their chance."
[53:25] the priestess when they killed Jesus.
[53:27] They sold out their chance to become his
[53:29] servant.
[53:31] Many preachers could be the servant of
[53:33] God and just surrender to the Holy
[53:36] Spirit and get completely out of the
[53:38] way.
[53:40] They'll never do that because they're
[53:43] looking at personal gain.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; They're looking at they want their
[53:49] kingdom or their church or their bank
[53:52] account.
[53:55] or their own revelation so they can
[53:57] bring the people to them that we are the
[53:59] only ones that got it. Nobody else got
[54:02] what we got.
[54:07] Their chance to become his servant,
[54:08] become a disciple,
[54:11] become converted to him. They sold it
[54:13] out. This is what he talked about the
[54:15] priest. He said they sold it out for
[54:17] green poison.
[54:20] Green poison jealousy.
[54:23] They sold out because of the jealousy of
[54:26] Jesus doctrine. They sold out because
[54:30] the flocks followed Jesus
[54:32] and never followed them.
[54:36] He was just 12 years old when Jesus was
[54:40] in the tabernacle and he stumped the
[54:42] priest and they stood in amazement
[54:46] at his revelation.
[54:50] They weren't happy he had that
[54:51] revelation. They were jealous.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; How did he get it? I've studied for
[55:00] years. He didn't get it. He was it.
[55:05] They had it so wrong.
[55:08] They had it so wrong.
[55:10] Years. They stumped them.
[55:14] And they were just as guilty. The
[55:17] priests were just as guilty of selling
[55:20] out Jesus.
[55:22] They actually were the ones that sold
[55:23] him out as Herod was. And I want to look
[55:26] in the scriptures and I want to show you
[55:29] three or four people
[55:31] that sold out Jesus. And we know Judas
[55:34] was one. We already we already did him,
[55:39] but and and how Judas totally
[55:45] sold him out for personal gain. We're
[55:47] going to actually go where Judas
[55:48] realized his his loss and tried to give
[55:52] back the money. But there's times in
[55:56] Judas life, his decision was
[55:58] non-repentable.
[56:01] Here we look at Luke 23.
[56:06] Luke 23. And we'll go through some
[56:08] scriptures here. Now, I want to show you
[56:10] something here. Jesus was at Pilate's uh
[56:14] judgment hall. And he realized that
[56:16] Jesus was a Calaldian.
[56:19] And he asked whether Jesus was a
[56:21] Calaldian. He realized that. And as soon
[56:23] as he knew it. See, Pilate could tell,
[56:26] and the scriptures say this. Pilate
[56:28] says, "This man is an innocent man. Is I
[56:31] find no fault with him. For sure no
[56:34] fault worthy of death." But Pilate was
[56:37] looking for an easy scapegoat to give it
[56:39] on to somebody else.
[56:42] The man made me do it.
[56:48] And as soon as verse seven, and as soon
[56:51] as he knew that he belonged into Herod's
[56:54] justific jurisdiction, he sent him to
[56:57] Herod who himself also
[57:01] was at Jerusalem at the time. And I want
[57:04] to I'm going to jump ahead and we're
[57:06] going to read this, but I want to show
[57:07] you something. Pilate and Herod were
[57:10] enemies.
[57:12] But if it was to their gain to sell out
[57:15] Jesus, they became friends.
[57:18] Jesus,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; you'll see that in Satan's kingdom.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; If somebody comes against what God's
[57:26] doing,
[57:27] and you'll watch people that will come
[57:29] together as friends, and you say, "But
[57:31] they were never friends before."
[57:33] &gt;&gt; But they both have this same anointing
[57:36] to kill what God's doing in a situation
[57:39] so they'll become friends.
[57:43] Watch this. This this scripture says
[57:45] this about Herod and Pilate.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And so when Herod saw
[57:53] Jesus, he was exceedingly glad. Now, why
[57:55] would he be exceedingly glad?
[57:59] Was it because he was going to worship
[58:00] him?
[58:03] Herod was a good Pentecostal.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; He wanted to see a show.
[58:11] You know, you know, I want to I want to
[58:14] just stop here and show you something.
[58:15] This this scripture, you know, we want
[58:18] in this church, God's the boss.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; And if he ain't the boss,
[58:25] we're we're in terrible trouble.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; He's the boss. And anything God wants to
[58:31] do, he can do in this church.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Anything that's scriptural will be in
[58:37] order.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Listen to me.
[58:40] you. Nobody's a matter of fact, even if
[58:43] it was slightly
[58:46] if it's scriptural and you even think it
[58:48] was done in the wrong order,
[58:52] &gt;&gt; it's okay.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Listen, go watch this. But
[58:57] if you want to see something happen in
[58:59] the church, don't ask the pastor
[59:02] &gt;&gt; cuz he's not the church.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Don't ask the building
[59:08] &gt;&gt; cuz it's going to burn. Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; If you want to see something drastic, if
[59:13] you want to see tongues and prophecy in
[59:14] the church, ask yourself.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; If you want to see miracles in the
[59:19] church,
[59:20] &gt;&gt; ask yourself.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; If you're going to ask the pastor, well,
[59:24] then I'm God.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; You should all fall down. Worship me.
[59:28] But don't do that, though. By the way,
[59:30] I'm a very poor God.
[59:33] You see what I mean?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? If you want
[59:38] something in your midst, help yourself.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible. Just take your Bible and just
[59:45] take it right out of the Bible. You're
[59:47] not I tell you what, there's nobody
[59:49] going to be thrown into the church
[59:50] because they're following anything in
[59:52] the Bible.
[59:54] You can sing specials, testify, edify
[59:57] God, edify the body, you know, have the
[1:00:00] nine spiritual gifts in your midst. They
[1:00:02] have to be in every bibleelving church.
[1:00:06] But brother Bam said, "The church is the
[1:00:08] people."
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Herod was exceeding glad. Verse eight,
[1:00:20] for he had desired to see Jesus for a
[1:00:22] long time. He had desired to get to
[1:00:25] church for a long time
[1:00:27] because he had heard about all the good
[1:00:29] things that had happened around Jesus.
[1:00:35] And there at the end of the verse, and
[1:00:36] he hoped he had seen
[1:00:39] some of the miracles that Jesus had
[1:00:41] done. Now, there's a key part here that
[1:00:45] her the Bible says about Herod. He did
[1:00:48] not say he hoped that he would be a
[1:00:51] miracle.
[1:00:53] He did not say that he hoped he would be
[1:00:55] involved and part of the miracle.
[1:00:59] He said he hoped he would just sit back
[1:01:01] and watch the miracle.
[1:01:04] That's the wrong approach.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He just wanted entertainment.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said this. He said, "If you
[1:01:13] want to see a miracle, become one.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Become a miracle."
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Herod had hoped that he had seen. Herod
[1:01:27] hadn't hoped for salvation. Herod hadn't
[1:01:30] hoped to worship Jesus. Herod hadn't
[1:01:32] hoped to have a new birth. Herod hadn't
[1:01:35] hoped to get healed. He had hoped to be
[1:01:36] entertained.
[1:01:44] I want to just drop something here this
[1:01:46] morning.
[1:01:48] Because of that spirit is the reason
[1:01:51] that the world is in the state it's in.
[1:01:53] I want I want to show you something. I
[1:01:55] in studying last night, I had something
[1:01:57] come up just randomly online. Now, do
[1:02:00] you realize in the state, now this is
[1:02:02] just information, do you realize in the
[1:02:04] states last year over 15,000
[1:02:09] churches closed?
[1:02:14] That's about 11. It's not quite, but
[1:02:16] it's almost 11,000 churches a month.
[1:02:19] Now, that's a lot per day.
[1:02:22] Now, I know what you're thinking. You're
[1:02:24] thinking, "Well, the states is really
[1:02:25] big." Yeah, it's really big. But they
[1:02:27] project
[1:02:30] that next year
[1:02:33] or in the very soon distant future,
[1:02:37] are you listening?
[1:02:39] That another 100,000
[1:02:43] will close.
[1:02:48] I have the total reason why.
[1:02:51] Because they want to see something, but
[1:02:53] they don't want to become something.
[1:02:57] They want to see some kind of something
[1:03:00] that makes them stimulated, but they
[1:03:02] don't want to be stimulated themselves.
[1:03:05] They want to see a new birth, but they
[1:03:07] don't want to become a new birth.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] If you want to see a miracle, become a
[1:03:16] miracle.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; If you want revival, become a revival.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse
[1:03:26] nine. And when he questioned, here's
[1:03:28] Herod. When he questioned him, many of
[1:03:30] these words he answered, Jesus answered
[1:03:32] him never. And the chief chief priests
[1:03:34] and scribes stood there accusing Jesus.
[1:03:38] In verse 11, and Herod and his men of
[1:03:42] war, set him to knot and mock Jesus.
[1:03:46] What? Watch this.
[1:03:48] Literally two verses before Herod's
[1:03:50] wanting to see a see some show
[1:03:53] and 1 second later, 5 seconds later, 10
[1:03:57] seconds later, Herod's mocking Jesus.
[1:04:02] That's a fast turnaround.
[1:04:07] He mocked Jesus and arrayed him in a in
[1:04:10] in a gorgeous robe and set him out again
[1:04:14] to Pilate. Do you know? See, he was he
[1:04:17] had no desire for benefit or change from
[1:04:20] Christ. He only wanted entertainment and
[1:04:24] show. And it's immediately when Jesus
[1:04:27] held his peace, he immediately turned on
[1:04:30] him and attacked them
[1:04:32] like a like a lion.
[1:04:39] And the same day that Pilate, watch this
[1:04:41] verse 12. Now I mentioned this to you.
[1:04:44] You need to see this.
[1:04:48] And the same day that Pilate and Herod
[1:04:51] made friends together, for before they
[1:04:54] were enemies between themselves,
[1:04:58] you see what I mean? If somebody on the
[1:05:01] other side wants to attack God's
[1:05:03] kingdom, see, spirits attract. You know,
[1:05:06] our prophet said this. He said when he
[1:05:08] was calling heaven having a prayer line
[1:05:09] and there was people not in the prayer
[1:05:11] line and he would see a demon on
[1:05:13] somebody and he said, "I'm going to call
[1:05:14] you up." And that demon would scream out
[1:05:16] for help for all the other demons
[1:05:17] recognizing that they they knew the
[1:05:19] power of God was in the midst, but they
[1:05:22] were screaming out for help for all the
[1:05:23] other like spirits.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. in the midst. Brother Brown could
[1:05:29] see the connection to the other devils
[1:05:32] in the church
[1:05:34] because they had the same desire to
[1:05:37] destroy the kingdom of God.
[1:05:41] And so even though those demons hated
[1:05:43] each other, they would become friends.
[1:05:46] Support me.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; He's attacking me.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] Wow.
[1:06:13] Let's just jump to the end of
[1:06:17] verse 14 there, partway through verse
[1:06:19] 14. and having examined him before you,
[1:06:22] I found no fault with this man, touching
[1:06:25] these things where you accuse him." So
[1:06:27] here the king had was saying to the
[1:06:30] priests and the scribes, "We find no
[1:06:32] fault in Jesus, nor did yet Herod,"
[1:06:35] Pilate was saying, nor me nor Herod
[1:06:38] found no fault.
[1:06:41] And why you sent him to me? Nothing
[1:06:42] worthy of death that he has done.
[1:06:47] Wow. Pilate
[1:06:50] was willing to
[1:06:53] release Jesus,
[1:06:55] but he sold him out
[1:06:59] because of the people. Watch, let's just
[1:07:02] move down to Matthew 27.
[1:07:06] So, we see here that the priest sold out
[1:07:08] Jesus because of green envy and
[1:07:10] jealousy. We see that Pilate sold him
[1:07:13] out because he never did miracles. He
[1:07:16] didn't get to see a show. He sent them
[1:07:19] back to Pilate and starting at verse 17.
[1:07:23] And therefore they had gathered
[1:07:24] together. And Pilate said unto them,
[1:07:26] whom will ye that I release unto you,
[1:07:29] Barabbus or Jesus called the Christ? And
[1:07:32] watch this. For he knew that he envied
[1:07:35] they envied Jesus
[1:07:38] that they had delivered onto him.
[1:07:41] Here, here's a pagan king knowing that
[1:07:45] the Christians had the wrong anointing
[1:07:47] on him,
[1:07:49] that the priests had brought Jesus out
[1:07:51] of envy. I mean, that's that's a that's
[1:07:55] amazing in itself.
[1:07:58] That's discernment in itself.
[1:08:01] And when he sat at the judgment seat,
[1:08:03] now this is Pilate in his wife sent unto
[1:08:06] him, saying, "Have nothing to do with
[1:08:10] this just man.
[1:08:13] For I have suffered many things today in
[1:08:15] a dream because of him."
[1:08:18] But the chief priests and the elders
[1:08:21] persuaded the multitude and said, "Give
[1:08:23] us Barabbus
[1:08:25] and destroy Jesus." Why? Why did Pilate
[1:08:29] sell out Jesus
[1:08:31] when his wife warned him
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; when he knew that the priests and the
[1:08:37] and the the leaders of the church had
[1:08:39] brought him from spite and envy. The
[1:08:42] Bible says that
[1:08:44] and he himself in judging him found
[1:08:47] nothing wrong with him. Verse 24.
[1:08:50] And Pilate saw that he could prevail
[1:08:52] nothing. He never had a backbone. He was
[1:08:56] the wimpiest king you ever seen.
[1:09:00] But rather
[1:09:02] the uproar of the people, he took water
[1:09:09] and he washed his hands before the
[1:09:10] multitude
[1:09:13] and he said what our scripture in
[1:09:15] Proverbs said.
[1:09:18] For everything in a man's eyes is clean
[1:09:21] unto himself,
[1:09:23] but the spirit
[1:09:26] judges all things.
[1:09:30] And he washed his hands before the
[1:09:32] multitude, saying, I am innocent of the
[1:09:34] blood of this person.
[1:09:36] See ye do it.
[1:09:40] Amen.
[1:09:42] Wow. Everything, you know, and I just
[1:09:44] mentioned this and I want to get into
[1:09:46] some personal. So we see that Pilate
[1:09:48] sold them out, Herod sold them out, and
[1:09:50] the priest sold them out, and Judas the
[1:09:53] Scariot sold them all out. And they all
[1:09:55] sold them out for personal gain, money,
[1:10:00] popularity
[1:10:04] or lack of entertainment.
[1:10:08] And you know, I want to show you
[1:10:09] something in our life. Everything you
[1:10:12] do,
[1:10:14] you can. We're just made like this.
[1:10:17] You're a free moral agent.
[1:10:19] So, every one of us, you are guilty.
[1:10:22] Every consideration that the word of God
[1:10:24] brings to you,
[1:10:27] you judge if it's worth the price.
[1:10:40] everything you look at and consider the
[1:10:42] price. If I will or if I will not,
[1:10:46] the price is too great. But if you have
[1:10:49] a new birth,
[1:10:52] you lose that consideration
[1:10:57] because you're not your own anymore.
[1:11:00] You're dead and you're somebody else. So
[1:11:04] you don't consider it a price to be that
[1:11:06] person.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; So watch this. I want to just go into
[1:11:11] some things that this is this is not
[1:11:13] this is not necessarily in this church
[1:11:16] or these people or or any individual. I
[1:11:18] want to just name some things that we
[1:11:20] deal with in our own personal life. And
[1:11:22] I want to show you maybe another quote
[1:11:24] or something that Brother Bram had a few
[1:11:26] quotes and a and the the comparison of
[1:11:29] things that we're okay with.
[1:11:32] See, Brother Bam said this about the the
[1:11:35] you know, I mentioned about the movies.
[1:11:37] Brother Bam said it used to be wrong to
[1:11:39] go to the movie theater, the drive-in.
[1:11:40] It used to be the drive-in theaters and
[1:11:42] that they were baked when I was a kid.
[1:11:44] They were actually just going out when I
[1:11:45] was a kid. You go in the theater, eat
[1:11:48] greasy popcorn. And he said, "Satan
[1:11:51] pulled the wool over your eyes and
[1:11:52] brought it right in your home
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; under your token.
[1:11:58] Now the angel had to leave your home.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Not because of the screen in itself, but
[1:12:03] because of the stuff that you put on the
[1:12:06] screen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Every one of you sitting here in your
[1:12:16] house know that you're supposed to do
[1:12:18] family or daily devotions.
[1:12:22] And every time that comes to you, you
[1:12:23] say, "Well, I'm in a hurry today.
[1:12:26] I have an appointment.
[1:12:29] It'll take too long.
[1:12:31] This is my busy time of year
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; or it's a holiday season.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; But brother Bam said it like this. He
[1:12:42] said, "If you need to eat and drink to
[1:12:44] stay alive physically,
[1:12:46] don't you need to eat and drink
[1:12:47] spiritually
[1:12:49] to stay alive?" Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And you just put a price on your
[1:12:55] spiritual life
[1:12:58] because of these four things I said.
[1:13:03] But it's the holiday season.
[1:13:06] Our house is in an uproar.
[1:13:09] It'll take too long. The school bus is
[1:13:12] coming. You know, my dad and and he's
[1:13:15] dead, so he don't know I'm saying this.
[1:13:17] I never checked it with him, but he was
[1:13:19] a peculiar person.
[1:13:23] Because
[1:13:25] I never I never I was grow raised in
[1:13:28] that. I never even came close to holding
[1:13:31] a candle to how my dad did family
[1:13:34] devotions daily.
[1:13:39] And I can remember businessmen
[1:13:43] stepping in our back door and knocking
[1:13:46] on the kitchen door and we were saying
[1:13:48] the Lord's Prayer.
[1:13:53] It didn't matter if the house was on
[1:13:55] fire,
[1:13:57] we would sit as a family and say the
[1:13:59] Lord's Prayer. And on the 99% of the
[1:14:02] time, every kid prayed and then dad led
[1:14:06] us in the Lord's prayer.
[1:14:10] You say he didn't have time. He died a
[1:14:12] multi-millionaire.
[1:14:15] You don't make money because you work.
[1:14:17] He made money because he surrendered
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; to God.
[1:14:27] The price was too great.
[1:14:31] when they built the when they left the
[1:14:33] free Methodist church because the women
[1:14:35] cut their hair, wear pierced their ears
[1:14:38] and started wearing pants.
[1:14:41] You could buy a car then brand new, the
[1:14:43] Lincoln of the day for five grand cash.
[1:14:50] And my dad gave the first 30 or 40,000
[1:14:53] to the church
[1:14:57] before I was born.
[1:15:00] because he wanted to stay with the word
[1:15:01] of God.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And his very worst farm we sold after he
[1:15:07] died, the dead worst farm. Not one of us
[1:15:09] kids wanted it.
[1:15:12] And on that farm, God gave them the next
[1:15:14] two years after he did it. Those I would
[1:15:16] have been one year old then. He gave
[1:15:18] them exactly what he'd give to the
[1:15:19] church times two that year and the next
[1:15:23] year.
[1:15:28] And my dad told me, he said,
[1:15:34] "If I would have knew there was that
[1:15:36] much money in that field, I would have
[1:15:40] lost my mind."
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; I seen one of his tractors sell this
[1:15:47] week.
[1:15:48] If I would have had the money, I would
[1:15:50] have bought it. It was a Little C. It's
[1:15:52] about 10 horsepower. Little C
[1:15:55] International.
[1:15:57] And he would cut that farm with a 10
[1:16:00] horsepower tractor, C gas engine, and an
[1:16:03] 8-ft blade straight mower
[1:16:06] on a 100 acre field,
[1:16:09] no power steering.
[1:16:12] And God give him 30 grand every time
[1:16:16] because he passed up
[1:16:20] seven or eight new cars because he gave
[1:16:22] the money to the church.
[1:16:28] Some of the old pillars the cost was not
[1:16:31] too great.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; But today
[1:16:36] we look at the cost different.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] You can look at this. That's just
[1:16:46] devotions. That's one thing. You can't
[1:16:48] live without them. Coming to church or
[1:16:52] not to come to church. It's too far. And
[1:16:55] and listen, I I don't want anybody blood
[1:16:59] on my hands that if it's snowy out, it's
[1:17:01] not wise to be on the road to icy. You
[1:17:04] have to be able to see. But you know
[1:17:07] what I'm saying? Eh,
[1:17:09] gas prices are too high. Come too early.
[1:17:12] I was telling the kids when Ben was in
[1:17:14] El Salvador,
[1:17:16] we went to Nicaragua and my wife had
[1:17:18] second choices on it. But we drove
[1:17:21] through Honduras and Nicaragua was
[1:17:23] communist. We'd never been in a
[1:17:24] communist country before. Took us about
[1:17:27] 2 and 1/2 hours to get through customs
[1:17:30] because I was a preacher. The government
[1:17:32] hates preachers because the Catholic
[1:17:34] Church tried to overthrow the
[1:17:35] government.
[1:17:37] They got voted in about after the 2000s
[1:17:40] and they never left office.
[1:17:43] And the church that I went to,
[1:17:47] you would need a stack of money like
[1:17:48] that to make $1 bars.
[1:17:52] That pastor drove five hours, went
[1:17:55] through three customs, had to get like
[1:17:57] these customs, you had to get out of the
[1:17:59] car, sometimes be fingerprinted. We had
[1:18:01] to get our temperature taken. They
[1:18:03] actually when you leave Nicaragua, they
[1:18:05] spray the vehicle with poison so you
[1:18:07] don't bring in CO. They're very afraid.
[1:18:09] They sprayed us going in, sprayed us
[1:18:10] coming out. Okay. The vehicle. Yeah.
[1:18:15] And they did all that just coming to
[1:18:16] hear Brother Ben preach one day.
[1:18:19] That'd be like you driving to Florida
[1:18:20] for one day and coming back.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; But you wouldn't do it.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't either
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; because I would look at the costs.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; But
[1:18:36] if you are that,
[1:18:39] those people never had the money to
[1:18:40] come.
[1:18:44] Just shake your head. They never had the
[1:18:45] money to come. Their money's worthless.
[1:18:47] If if you dropped a $10 bill, you
[1:18:49] wouldn't bend over to pick it up. It'd
[1:18:50] be like picking up a penny.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; But they came.
[1:18:58] It was the cost. See, Judas's scariot
[1:19:01] wasn't a bad person.
[1:19:03] He was one of us.
[1:19:05] Remember? Remember, not one of the
[1:19:08] disciples thought it was him.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Not one of the disciples thought it was
[1:19:15] him.
[1:19:16] But he's seen the money.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He went to the priest and said, "What
[1:19:21] will you give me for me to sell him to
[1:19:24] you?" It's exactly what the Bible says.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; God help us. See, if that's why, see,
[1:19:39] it's the church is the people.
[1:19:42] And the reason that 115,000 churches
[1:19:45] have and will close in the states is
[1:19:48] because of the nature of the church
[1:19:53] which is the people.
[1:19:56] Amen.
[1:19:59] So we can see we can always justify. See
[1:20:02] because in our own eyes
[1:20:04] it's understandable. It's understandable
[1:20:07] that I'm not going to go to Florida for
[1:20:08] a one-day meeting no matter who's
[1:20:11] preaching.
[1:20:13] What if God asked you to go?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Do you desire to go?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Love your enemies. Love the people that
[1:20:25] would kill you if it was legal.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; The only reason they don't kill you is
[1:20:32] cuz it's not legal and they serve time.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; But that's a hard thing to do.
[1:20:39] But the Bible says in Matthew 5:44, "But
[1:20:41] if I say unto you, love your enemies,
[1:20:43] bless them that curse you, and do good
[1:20:45] to them that hate you, and pray for them
[1:20:47] that despitefully use you, and persecute
[1:20:50] you."
[1:20:52] Now, I want I want to get into something
[1:20:54] just for a second, and we're I promise I
[1:20:56] didn't think we were going to be long. I
[1:20:58] just got another a couple scriptures and
[1:21:01] one more example and an example of
[1:21:03] Brother Brown.
[1:21:05] But uh we see here
[1:21:11] the Bible says that without holiness no
[1:21:15] man shall see the God.
[1:21:18] In Hebrews 12 14 and verse 15 it says
[1:21:22] look diligently
[1:21:24] lest that any man shall fall from the
[1:21:29] grace
[1:21:31] of God.
[1:21:36] Now, this is Paul, we believe, that
[1:21:39] wrote Hebrews. He's telling us that if
[1:21:40] you're not if you're not careful, you
[1:21:42] could fall outside of God's grace.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And I want to show you in God's
[1:21:50] scripture, you know, holiness talked
[1:21:52] about our dress,
[1:21:56] and we can read that in Deuteronomy.
[1:21:57] Deuteronomy 22:5
[1:22:00] says, "If a woman wears that that
[1:22:02] pertainth unto a man, neither shall a
[1:22:04] man wear that pertainth unto a woman.
[1:22:07] For all that do it is an abomination
[1:22:12] unto God." I want to show you something.
[1:22:15] When you consider that, it's is the
[1:22:18] price worth it?
[1:22:20] Well, you'd have to consider your
[1:22:23] eternal life. That person would have to
[1:22:25] consider the eternal destination. But I
[1:22:27] want to show you in a different way to
[1:22:29] show you that you could be okay with
[1:22:31] that. But you wouldn't be okay with
[1:22:34] something else. And God says they're
[1:22:36] exactly the same. Now watch this. I want
[1:22:39] I want to clarify something. And we've
[1:22:41] done this before, but this this is going
[1:22:44] to be off my chest cuz I'm not getting
[1:22:46] there and being holding anybody's blood
[1:22:48] on my hands. I don't believe that
[1:22:51] there's nothing that a a girl or a woman
[1:22:55] or a sister in the message can't do.
[1:23:01] You want to go snowmoiling, you can go
[1:23:02] snowmoiling. Wear a snowsuit.
[1:23:06] You want to go in a bungee jumping, go
[1:23:09] bungee jumping. Wear a pair of pants, go
[1:23:13] bungee jumping.
[1:23:16] But you can always
[1:23:18] wear a small coat, long coat, a skirt
[1:23:22] over that, even a mini skirt over that.
[1:23:25] And you will be telling the world,
[1:23:29] I am different than a man.
[1:23:33] Now watch this. Watch this. Different. I
[1:23:35] don't care how you say. You can you can
[1:23:37] you can wrestle cattle and ride
[1:23:40] horseback
[1:23:42] and have a pair of overhauls on in the
[1:23:44] west, but you can have a short skirt on
[1:23:47] that when you leave that horse,
[1:23:50] you tell the whole world that this is
[1:23:52] somebody different.
[1:23:54] Now, I want to show you something. In
[1:23:56] every country I've been in, which I've
[1:23:58] landed in a few countries that I never
[1:23:59] stayed in, the bathroom's deadification,
[1:24:04] is a skirt on a person and pants in
[1:24:07] another one. Now, most of you sitting
[1:24:09] here would think if a man walked in a
[1:24:12] woman's bathroom with a skirt on, you'd
[1:24:14] have a problem with that.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And he's obeying the sign.
[1:24:21] some and some might not think if a woman
[1:24:24] walked in a man's bathroom with pants
[1:24:26] on. You might have a problem with that,
[1:24:29] but they're actually obeying
[1:24:32] the sign.
[1:24:34] Every country,
[1:24:36] Honduras, Nicaragua,
[1:24:40] El Salvador, Japan,
[1:24:43] honey, where have we been? every country
[1:24:46] we've landed in or drove through, the
[1:24:49] sign was the same.
[1:24:53] But watch how God shows it. And I want
[1:24:55] to read a quote the prophet said. Do you
[1:24:57] realize in Leviticus 2013,
[1:25:00] most of you might or some might think,
[1:25:02] well, I have to do this because we live
[1:25:04] in a cold climate. I ain't telling
[1:25:07] nobody to freeze to death. Put leggings,
[1:25:09] put on pants, put on insulated,
[1:25:11] whatever, but put a dress over top of
[1:25:12] it.
[1:25:14] put a dress over top of it. Do you know
[1:25:16] that when you come up in the judgment
[1:25:19] that God will judge you exactly the same
[1:25:22] as you have a big problem with this? In
[1:25:24] Leviticus 20:13, it says, "If a man lays
[1:25:28] with a man
[1:25:30] as if he would lay with a woman,
[1:25:33] he committh abomination."
[1:25:38] And if you're wearing man's clothing
[1:25:40] without a skirt over it, as far as God's
[1:25:43] concerned, you're gay
[1:25:47] or lesbian.
[1:25:49] There is absolutely not one spec
[1:25:51] different.
[1:25:53] He said, "If a man lays with a man as if
[1:25:55] he would lay with a woman, he committh
[1:25:57] abomination.
[1:26:00] But if a woman wears pant without a
[1:26:01] skirt over it, it's an abomination."
[1:26:05] In God's age, you're a lesbian.
[1:26:12] Watch what the prophet said here.
[1:26:15] It all comes down to the price.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; It all comes down to the price
[1:26:25] because there ain't nothing you can't do
[1:26:28] without still keeping your
[1:26:32] nature.
[1:26:34] There's nothing at all you can't do.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I was going to the bus
[1:26:41] stop and I was a game warning and I was
[1:26:44] going up here and I was sitting there
[1:26:45] and there was a man talking like that
[1:26:47] and he had a welder's cap on and I was
[1:26:49] talking like this. Now listen, I I I
[1:26:52] said there ain't nothing a woman can't
[1:26:54] do. My girls help me doctor cattle and
[1:26:58] and do everything.
[1:27:01] Well, many of them better than the men.
[1:27:03] I would pick my girls over most men.
[1:27:07] I don't I don't believe because you're a
[1:27:09] message person, you can't go horseback
[1:27:10] riding or toboggoning or skiing or or uh
[1:27:13] you know, you can't ride a snowmobile. I
[1:27:15] don't believe that.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that at all. You can do
[1:27:18] anything you want, but you can still
[1:27:20] keep your dignity as a woman.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:27:28] And this man was smoking a cigarette.
[1:27:30] Brother B had a welding glasses on and
[1:27:32] pushed up like that and and he names the
[1:27:34] place where they were. And he said, "I
[1:27:36] was sitting there and I was talking to
[1:27:37] this old fellow and he said something
[1:27:39] there and it got we got to laughing and
[1:27:42] he said I was laughing so hard." He
[1:27:44] said, "I hit him on the leg and said,
[1:27:45] "Oh boy, that really takes the cake,
[1:27:48] don't it?"
[1:27:51] It was Brother Brown.
[1:27:54] And he said, sitting directly across
[1:27:55] from me was a woman and said, 'Hey Ruth,
[1:27:58] are you going to go do this tomorrow?
[1:28:03] Brother Brandham almost passed out.
[1:28:07] He said she had on overhauls,
[1:28:11] big burly, just like a man sitting there
[1:28:15] smoking a cigarette, blowing it out her
[1:28:17] nose. And he said, "I thought
[1:28:22] it was a man."
[1:28:27] And he said something just about what's
[1:28:31] that word?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Touch doing something and it hit
[1:28:37] somebody's head and knocked what you
[1:28:40] call off. And we started laughing and I
[1:28:42] laughed so hard that I slapped her on
[1:28:44] the leg thinking it was a man.
[1:28:48] And I didn't know any different
[1:28:52] because I couldn't tell
[1:28:55] it wasn't a man.
[1:28:58] The Bible says that a woman that puts on
[1:29:00] a garment pertaining to a man,
[1:29:04] it's an abomination.
[1:29:14] But the Bible also says the man with lay
[1:29:18] with men
[1:29:20] and women with women is an abomination.
[1:29:25] You might be okay with one, but are you
[1:29:28] okay with both?
[1:29:30] Because I can prove to you, and I
[1:29:31] mentioned this before, but I can prove
[1:29:33] to you in my small life generation, and
[1:29:38] I think I can name three families that
[1:29:40] their grandparents left the women
[1:29:43] wearing skirts and their grandkids are
[1:29:46] gay and lesbians.
[1:29:50] Most of that was connected in the free
[1:29:52] Methodist church
[1:29:54] and they left that when I was born.
[1:29:56] So, it took the history of my life to go
[1:30:00] from cutting your hair and looking
[1:30:02] butchie like a man and wearing pants to
[1:30:06] your kids will be gay lesbians. And you
[1:30:09] know why? It's your fault. Because they
[1:30:13] don't know who you are.
[1:30:16] They slap your leg because they think
[1:30:19] you're a man.
[1:30:27] It's a different nature.
[1:30:30] You want to vomit when you see those
[1:30:32] kind of people together in the town, but
[1:30:35] if you're doing the other, it's the
[1:30:37] exact same demon.
[1:30:42] Matthew 27 and3 said and Judas
[1:30:45] prescariat which betrayed him when he
[1:30:49] saw the condemnation that rented
[1:30:51] repented himself and brought the 30
[1:30:54] pieces of silver to the chief priests
[1:30:56] and elders and saying I have sinned and
[1:31:01] betrayed innocent blood and you know
[1:31:03] what the devil will tell you and they
[1:31:06] said what is that to us
[1:31:10] see thou how to that.
[1:31:14] And he cast the silver. See, he
[1:31:16] desperately was wanting repentance. And
[1:31:19] he cast the silver in the temple and
[1:31:21] departed and went out and hung himself.
[1:31:24] And the chief priests took the silver.
[1:31:27] And they said it was not lawful to put
[1:31:29] it in the treasury because it had paid
[1:31:32] the price of blood. And they took it and
[1:31:34] counseledled. And they bought potter's
[1:31:36] field to bury strangers.
[1:31:40] And that field is potter's field, the
[1:31:42] field of blood to this day.
[1:31:48] See, everything you do in your life, you
[1:31:51] put a price to it.
[1:31:54] Is it worth it?
[1:31:58] But if you have a nature change,
[1:32:01] you won't do that.
[1:32:05] And you're going to have a harder time
[1:32:07] proving it when it was just something
[1:32:10] simple that you could just put. You can
[1:32:12] just make your garment. So when you
[1:32:14] stand up,
[1:32:16] you're warm. You don't have to freeze to
[1:32:18] death. You don't have to stay in the
[1:32:20] kitchen and not do anything fun. You can
[1:32:23] have as much fun as anybody.
[1:32:26] But when you stand up, the world will
[1:32:28] know
[1:32:32] that it's a man. Do you know you think
[1:32:34] this is far out? Do you know I have
[1:32:36] pictures on my phone in the states where
[1:32:40] they arrested women
[1:32:44] for nudity
[1:32:46] and they had far more clothes on than
[1:32:49] what they would wear today.
[1:32:53] It was all it was just slow progression
[1:32:57] justification.
[1:33:01] James 1 and we're going to close here
[1:33:03] just a couple scriptures. James 1, he
[1:33:06] said, "Therefore, laying apart all
[1:33:08] filthiness,
[1:33:09] super
[1:33:12] fluidity, and naughtiness, receive with
[1:33:15] meekness the grafted word, which is able
[1:33:18] to save
[1:33:20] your souls.
[1:33:22] But be doers of the word and not just
[1:33:25] hearers,
[1:33:27] receiving deceiving your own self.
[1:33:34] For it would be, for if any be a hearer
[1:33:38] of the word, and not a doer, he is like
[1:33:40] unto a man holding the natural face in a
[1:33:43] glass, and he beholdeth himself, and
[1:33:46] goeth his way straightway, forgetting
[1:33:50] what manner of man
[1:33:52] he is.
[1:33:57] Matthew 10, one of our last scriptures
[1:33:59] here, Matthew 10 37. And he said, here's
[1:34:05] Jesus giving us the price that is if
[1:34:09] it's worth it or not. He said, "He that
[1:34:13] loveth father and mother more than me
[1:34:18] is not
[1:34:21] not is a key word here. Not worthy of
[1:34:25] me." If you love yourself
[1:34:30] and your own ideas more than Christ,
[1:34:32] you're not even worthy.
[1:34:36] And he that loveth his son or his
[1:34:39] daughter more than me
[1:34:42] is not not is a key word here worthy of
[1:34:46] me.
[1:34:48] And he that taketh not up his cross
[1:34:51] and follows me,
[1:34:54] follow after me, is not worthy of me.
[1:34:59] Everything
[1:35:01] we judge because we're humans
[1:35:05] by a price.
[1:35:07] Well, I only wanted to.
[1:35:17] But if you have a nature change,
[1:35:20] you don't judge a price
[1:35:23] because you're a different person.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; You're just a different person.
[1:35:29] Amen. Let's just read that scripture
[1:35:32] again as we close. Proverbs 16 and2.
[1:35:37] All the ways of a man
[1:35:41] are clean
[1:35:43] in his own eyes,
[1:35:46] but the Lord weighth
[1:35:49] the spirits.
[1:35:51] You know, I I just close with this with
[1:35:53] the on the same thing as our dress. I've
[1:35:56] seen pictures
[1:35:59] of the Brigden Fair
[1:36:02] around the 1930s and 40s and it looked
[1:36:05] like every person that went to the fair
[1:36:08] had just left the wedding.
[1:36:11] If you think I'm far off this I like you
[1:36:13] any of you maybe it's out there but you
[1:36:15] know when they people get married I've
[1:36:18] never now it's probably about to come
[1:36:19] out or maybe it already is. I didn't
[1:36:21] look for it, but I've never heard them
[1:36:24] advertise that they got their wedding
[1:36:26] pants on.
[1:36:29] It was always a wedding dress
[1:36:33] because normally most men
[1:36:39] want to marry a woman.
[1:36:43] And amazingly enough, when they do their
[1:36:47] vows,
[1:36:48] I imagine it's probably it's probably
[1:36:50] coming up that it'll come out.
[1:36:55] But I've never ever seen a picture, new
[1:36:57] or old,
[1:37:00] of a man and a woman getting married and
[1:37:03] the woman having wedding pants.
[1:37:11] Amen.
[1:37:13] I also showed you years maybe a year ago
[1:37:16] or something pictures I had from the
[1:37:18] high school in the 60s
[1:37:25] and it would put most churches to shame
[1:37:29] of what the women look like in public
[1:37:31] schools
[1:37:32] because in the 60s
[1:37:35] watch this watch this sat knows exactly
[1:37:39] it was cool
[1:37:41] to be a feminine.
[1:37:47] But Satan has changed the roles
[1:37:51] and now it's cool to be butchy and
[1:37:54] mouthy
[1:37:56] and take the spirit of a man.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; That's not nature.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Forget you could just set Christianity
[1:38:06] aside. It's not even natural.
[1:38:10] God help us.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I I seen this when it came up
[1:38:15] probably a month ago. I seen the first
[1:38:18] thing that God was pulling me to this
[1:38:20] message
[1:38:22] and and I want to show you how I got
[1:38:24] this. I seen a random post on the
[1:38:27] internet from Darren Jones and he said,
[1:38:31] "I'm going to side with Judas's Scariot
[1:38:34] because we all do the same thing he
[1:38:36] does. sell Jesus out and I just
[1:38:41] blew it off.
[1:38:44] And two or three weeks ago,
[1:38:47] I was studying on humility and I was
[1:38:50] going through the message hub
[1:38:53] and I found this quote where brother
[1:38:54] Bram said, "The church is the same as
[1:38:58] Judas's Scariot."
[1:39:00] I said, "Oh,
[1:39:02] God,
[1:39:05] you're sending something this way."
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And every one of us,
[1:39:11] if we ain't had a nature change or
[1:39:14] before we had a nature change, has been
[1:39:17] guilty of putting the price on. Is it
[1:39:20] worth it?
[1:39:22] Let's stand.
[1:39:29] Amen.
[1:39:30] God help us.
[1:39:45] Thank you Lord Jesus. He is Lord F.
[1:39:58] Heat.
[1:40:03] Heat.
[1:40:13] Heat.
[1:40:26] Heat.
[1:40:34] Yeah.
[1:40:42] Heat.
[1:40:56] Heat.
[1:41:09] Heat.
[1:41:18] Yeah. Heat.
[1:42:07] Amen. Amen. We just have an announcement
[1:42:13] to make. We're going to sing All is
[1:42:14] Well, Vicki, um we have an announcement
[1:42:17] to make. This is as much for the people
[1:42:20] online
[1:42:21] as it is for us here present.
[1:42:25] But your government in Canada
[1:42:28] has passed a law to make religious
[1:42:34] beliefs
[1:42:36] and the Bible hate speech.
[1:42:40] It is not fully passed yet
[1:42:44] because they
[1:42:48] dickered it beyond the time that they
[1:42:51] could make it law
[1:42:53] until they come back in January the
[1:42:56] House.
[1:42:58] So all that would watch our video
[1:43:00] online, this is a blowout to you. When
[1:43:04] that becomes law,
[1:43:06] we will not have a public video.
[1:43:09] We may look into getting a password
[1:43:14] to some people,
[1:43:21] but you can see the signs.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; You can play all you want,
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; but it's your eternal soul.
[1:43:34] We
[1:43:36] are at the end.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; If you got democracy countries like
[1:43:43] Canada making the Bible, reading the
[1:43:48] Bible
[1:43:49] prison, two years minimum.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; You need to really value
[1:44:03] and appraise where you're at.
[1:44:05] Is Christ worth it to you?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Because the government's going to find
[1:44:15] out for you.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] God help us. We need a rapture.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; We need a rapture. And we need a rapture
[1:44:25] really bad.
[1:44:27] It might not be safe for me, but if they
[1:44:29] take me, they'll take you next.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] We need a rapture. This world is insane.
[1:44:41] Amen. Let's sing this song. But God will
[1:44:43] take care of us. I'm not afraid of jail.
[1:44:46] The food's free.
[1:44:48] They probably don't have to fix the fire
[1:44:50] either. I imagine they'll have Well,
[1:44:52] they can't use natural gas because that
[1:44:53] hurts the environment. So, I don't know
[1:44:55] what they'll heat the place with cuz
[1:44:57] we're tree lovers, but or environment
[1:45:00] lovers, but they'll probably have
[1:45:02] something. Oh, solar panels. That's what
[1:45:05] they'll heat it with. There's a story.
[1:45:26] Heat.
[1:45:33] Heat.
[1:45:56] Heat.
[1:45:59] Heat.
[1:46:27] Heat. Heat.
[1:46:37] Heat.
[1:46:43] Heat.
[1:46:52] Heat.
[1:47:04] Heat.
[1:47:21] Heat.
[1:47:28] Heat.
