morning bless them a special way and just pray that you'll be with us here and as we look into your plan Lord Jesus for us we love you with all of our hearts amen amen amen you may have your seats for a moment hallelujah what an amazing God he's he's just there's just not words in English to explain how amazing he is thank you musicians bless your brother welcome man just a few out just visiting family and friends and and we pray God's blessing on them and and just uh I don't want to we well we won't lose God's uh sweet anointing and spirit but it's just a few announcements we're looking at February 25th for our church meeting which will be after our lunch so we'd have a regular service have church lunch and then we'll look at what's happened in the past year and uh all these things in the church and look forward to to a time in so we leave in the Rapture you know our dreams and plans and and so we would really desire that you all could be here that support the church with your love and kindness and kind words and and time and fellowship and money and offerings and tithes and offerings and uh so the only reason we would we I'm going to check with a few that are out sister Patty Works shift worker that but uh we're just going to confirm that with different ones that have different work schedules but the only reason that might change is uh for weather like it happened that it was snow storm and half the people weren't here we'd recalculate amen amen so we're not going to leave anybody out so if that's a bad day for you maybe you could let us know or something but uh and also just a few things we're going to look at just on that same line then we'll get right into the word um just a couple things that we look forward to and we're going we can talk about and discuss more in our in our meeting and uh of course you all are should be there you're all welcome to be there and and and uh and everybody has uh good ideas and advice and counsel and all these things but it was brought uh very wonderfully to my attention and different things some from online and some from uh present um and this is not nothing you know anything we do in church it's not like cutting dried and law and you know like I don't want a church like that ju and don'ts and so I almost hesitate to to say things but things we would like to do is cut down on the traffic in front of the pulpit so the ones that sit on this side um you know if you could go to the back and walk around like one thing that was noticed was it was on the camera and so people that had never been in our church before when they watch now of course it's a layout of our church and and God did that before the before uh he seen us here and and so and we're not complainant it don't bother me but you know different ones you know in the video they say wow you have a lot of movement right in front of your Pulpit or sometimes ministers will go out in front of the pulpit like brother Ben or brother Bartley or people under the anointing and if you know if you just have it in your thoughts that maybe you'll just walk down and go around it'll just uh make it maybe clearer for somebody watching online somebody maybe that don't understand the layout of the church now now that's not law I mean if you forget or you you know you're kids screaming and you want to take them out but maybe when you come back you'll take them for a little walk and go the other way you that and the other thing we'd like to do is we'd like to to uh and I know this sounds funny we're not this is not a thought because of uh this is not a re uh is this has no spiritual effect it's not we're not saying that we would like to do this because a spiritual effect but we would like our home Church to take their shoe outdoor shoes off um there's not a single person sitting here this morning that if I came to your house you would expect me to take your shoes off and I have I clean this church a lot of times sister Ruth does but I used to clean it more often than I do now and I have pictures of people uh times where you come in you just can't help it but you know you you bring the outside inside and uh if you were the one that I know Tim and Vicky when we first bought the church they actually went under the pews and sanded the floor and varnished it twice if you were the person that did that and took months to do it you wouldn't wear your outside shoes in there and uh I a couple years ago VY stole the pews and I redid the floor under there took a winter to do it do the pews and that and you know if you can't afford an extra pair of shoes the church will buy them for you and they'll just be owned by the church and you can just put your Little John Henry on them and uh you can just have church shoes that you'll never take anywhere else or slippers or stocking feet and that and it it's not because that we're standing on Holy Ground the building's going to burn but it's just respect for the floor and the carpet and and maybe instead of taking the mop out underneath the Pew every Sunday we just take it out a couple times a year or something but those are two things that we uh we look forward to doing in the future if we can amen we have a little sign up in our back room if you choose not to remove your your shoes you just volunteer to clean and uh it's just very it's just it's very simple you know amen anyway now we know that that will never stick to visitors or people that don't come here regular and we understand that you know that's maybe we can stand and just uh look into his word and you know I I pray with all my heart that you can catch the vision of of what God's trying to show us let's turn to Joshua 2 12-4 and you know when brother John Garrett here was here if you uh could catch the the thought of the Holy Spirit I mean just a supernatural literally Supernatural how he preached on you all have a voice and and you know how you and you know I think the very Sunday before that was or a couple Sundays before I preach you all have a Ministry the prophet said that and uh you know uh well we'll read our scripture and you can sit down amen so Joshua 2:12 now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness onto my father's house and give me a true token that ye may save alive my father and my my mother and my brethren my sisters and all that they have now that's pretty plain and deliver our lives from death and the man answered her and said our life for your life if you ought not our business and it shall be that when the Lord has given us the L that he'll deal kindly and truly with thee Lord Jesus we pray that somehow you'll just show the people I can't God but you can show the people what you showed me God if they'll catch a vision of it God it will make them stronger in you Lord Jesus Jesus we pray in your name amen amen you may have your seats you I want to and you know I've mentioned this before in adoption you know and I just touch on a quote you know the strongest unit in the world is the family unit there's no unit stronger than the family unit the bloodline of the family is the strongest army in the world Amen there's no Army stronger than the bloodline of the family why do you think that Satan he trying to attack the very Foundation of God's basis amen and if you look in the adoption here he says you know in Genesis 1:26 is one of my favorite scriptures but when when God in the beginning when God made man he was called Elohim and Elohim in the me in the Hebrew means that he was self-existence it was God himself God did everything amen but in Genesis 2 God's name got changed to Jehovah when he made something from himself now think spiritually think family When God Made You from himself it was the family bloodline of no less than Jehovah God and he was no longer self-existence by himself but literally it changed his Dynamics in his name and it said it dwelt with his family god Jehovah dwells with his family Hallelujah the strongest backbone of everything in the world is the backbone of the family there's multiple scriptures of family the Bible says happy is a man that Quivers full full of them and and multiple things it was the bloodline from Jehovah God and your own family in your own household is only a shadow of what God's seen before the foundation of the world and I want to show you something God couldn't accomplish what he wanted to the self-existence one the everything the M miraculous God couldn't accomplish what he wanted to without having you as his family Hallelujah now if God himself couldn't accomplish what God only could do you ain't got a fighting chance to try to do it on your own Hallelujah and you know if we look into Joshua maybe we go further down here into Joshua we see that you know Rahab was protected by an amazing promise and you know we see the world is completely insane but you are the Little House in the wall that when when the wall is crumbling down and the world is crumbling down and your everything is crumbling around you you have a predestinated promise that if you'll not speak Hallelujah if you'll keep the Covenant the token Hallelujah I want to bring that to your attention that this token wasn't self-serving it was for my father's household they weren't Angels it was her father and her mother and her brothers and her sisters and it was for something else it was for all that they obtained Hallelujah Your Life For Mine God is amazing you know this revelation of what you have in this day brought by a prophet watch how God wrote The Plan of Redemption in the Old Testament he is amazing brother mine like he seen your life for mine God gave his life for mine Hallelujah he's writing it everywhere your life for mine he was preing this whole plan when he knew he would come himself and give his life for yours and he expects the same in return that you'll give your life for his hallelujah amen it's it's a family unit on break able family oh it's beautiful I want to look in Joshua 6 and we're going to just we maybe won't read it but two to five here here we see that Joshua you know you can just go back as far as you want but Joshua come up under Moses and Moses was God's man got Moses was God to pharaoh and to the world and you know we've preached on different things but we don't want to get caught up in the the this the the the the the tul amen when when God was done with Moses he just had another person come up and that's why we should be careful with Ministry and all these things it's not about one Minister it's not even all about your pastor or or it's not you know because it's a family it's a unit it's a whole bunch of people are doing this plan of God you remember even God couldn't do it alone you think a Min one minut oh what a joke that must just God must go into a Statics when he thinks some minister is going to pull off something that even he couldn't do and you see here Joshua come up and do you know Joshua was way mightier than Moses amen Joshua was the one that conquered the promised land and actually placed the people in the promised land and you know just multiple things and and but you see here that Joshua in in in in Joshua 62 here God said I've given you the city of Jericho and he said uh now he said we want you to take the Mighty Man and compressed the city now this this city just to give you some history on it and you can study it but this city was the walls weren't just like we think of like one layer of block you know or brick or you know and you pop a hole through it or something like that no this city was big enough that the Chariots and the horses went around on top of it this city actually built the houses on it and the people drove over the roades of the houses man this wall was serious business amen and and here God's telling Joshua how to conquer the city and compress the city and you know the story how they went around the city six days one time each day and you know you compare that to the numerology of God because God Perfection is seven and and you can just preach Forever on seven and I love that amen but I want to show you something and and God is trying to show you I I I know you're not get I wish you could catch it God's trying to show you that you all are part of him you're all part of the plan you're all part of the family you're all part of this church you're all Ministry in this church you're all part of the community forget about brother Dale think of God Jesus Christ you're all Christ you're the prophet said you're his bone you're his flesh you don't have to think about somebody else think about yourself what are you in Christ you are he you are she Hallelujah this ain't a worship of one another it's respects of one another and and honor and love and kindness and and the kindness that you show us is just beyond I'm just unbelievable amen the prophet said that in the last day that the only love in the world would be found in the bride Hallelujah that's that's real and that's true and I mean I've experienced some of that love in the last few years is just I mean just it's just unworthy it's unbelievable amen but I want I I want you to see I want you to just get a mirror and think look at yourself it's you and Christ and who what Christ's thoughts were of you forget about I wished I was somebody else you you are the greatest person you could think of God himself Hallelujah there come right are you catching this is that something made from himself you God's family Hallelujah and I want you to understand this and I mentioned this a few month maybe a month ago or something just touching it you know this message has been two or three months in the coming and and you know when God when I'm building a message I I I preach and I and and that you know I've been in it in the week and I I say it and I shouldn't say it that but here I want you to recognize that in the seventh of Christ perfection maybe we'll read that amen I just find in what verse it is here and then on this he talks about the six days and uh I ain't got my verses broke down here but uh we'll just start there with three and all and and you shall compress the city all ye Men of War and go around the city once and you shall do that six days that's we just want to go past that go to the next one and on this and the seventh priest shall bear before the ark the seven trumpets of ram horns and the seventh day you shall compress the city now God don't do nothing by per chance they didn't just throw words in the Bible just for you know to fill up the pages so it was a thicker book you know what I'm saying he said on the seventh day you'll compress the city and the priests shall blow the trumpets now it ain't mentioned so far much let's go to the next verse about the congregation and about the people but I want you to show you something Joshua had two million people in his church he was following two million people and they don't re the speaker the anthiers the speakers and the sound people were the were the ram horns and they they ran on a different kind of electricity because if you have a ram horn that will actually be loud enough for two million people to hear it with the Lambs bleeding and the goats bleeding and the cattle ball and the the the the ox things ride on in their heads I mean it had to be a pretty good electricity to blow that horn you had to be somebody there that had pipes like a throat like a fog horn amen and it shall come to Passa when the when they make the long blast with the ram horn and you hear the sound of the trumpet and I want to stop right there that God here's God's telling Josh how those walls would come down and you know if we leave the word of God our walls aren't coming down but I want to tell you something and your I don't believe now and I don't mean that here at all I don't feel that one spec there ain't a person here I feel that way but in our life past history we've all built walls for protection brother Dale has I built a few sets of them because you felt like you were going to going to die if you didn't have the wall so you put up a wall of protection and with that Spirit of wall building you think you're going to get to heaven alone I've been there I done got the t-shirt it's hanging in my closet but that's not how God made it amen yes that yes I I I know I know that you work out your own salvation with fear and TR TR Ling but God brought it that he was going to have a family come in it was a family and when we go in the Rapture or we go in death when we go into the white thr we're not going through the white Throne judgment but when they're there judging the white Throne judgment it won't be one person brother Dale won't be the only one there and neither will be somebody else that you thinks an angel but it'll be everything God done was based on a family and so if we walk out of these scriptures we lose our power and I going tell you something even some of may be young or old or different but I would encourage you I would encourage you you know the Bible says that don't fear them that can kill your body now that goes that goes with not just your body but that goes with your character with your I mean anything your your honor your respects it makes no difference because people will if you are very old and you got a little bit white hair few of you do you'll realize that people will say whatever they want to say and and you know see go back to what we preached with with Isaac when he built the wells he never stried for those Wells he just said okay he just kind of waved at him amen and here God saying he said and all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the city will come down and I want to tell you something if you think about this I don't know what kind of uh vibrations come out of those people's mouths but I want to tell you what in 2 million people you probably had a couple hundred th000 babies under one year old you probably had a couple hundred, people and homemade wheelchairs you prob had a couple amen you probably had a couple hundred thousand people the kids were six seven and eight completely out of control amen and God had them in part of his plan to to conquer your walls around you it was a family of God that was going to bring those walls down and there was some kind of vibrations that come out of the young kid's voice and the old kids voice and the wheelchair people's voices that Satan couldn't handle the walls couldn't handle the stones couldn't handle the mortar that held those stones together that were wide enough for a chariot to go across couldn't add to it there were the vibrations of oh you can't get much poin or not it was the vibrations of all because God is a spirit and God is one and those that worship Him in spirit must worship Him in all all the truth hallelujah and so God was a family and the family unit was one Hallelujah and so to release the power of Jehovah on those Jericho walls where the Martyr and the brick would have with stone probably a bombs but the vibrations out of little children and old men and Widow and people that never had a voice you couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow and all these things what do you think the Bible says to make a Joyful Noise Hallelujah all the demons in hell and all the armies of Jericho and the mortar they had okay could we build the pyramids today no we couldn't build the pyramids today you think those walls were just slopped up there with mortar that they they put in these new houses that they Breck these new houses in the winter time and if they didn't if they put too much water in the the mortar it would dry I've seen new houses I worked on brother M that if they if they made the morar too dry it would dry out and they want it to last half the day so they just slap lots of water in it and those break those houses those houses are barely out of warranty the Bricker falling off it it's because it was all evil for money the these walls weren't built like that but there was a power in the vibrations of the voice of all the people of the children of the family of God that they had to wait for the diapers to get changed they had to wait for the wheel to get slapped back on the wheelchair because every one of those people whether you could walk or not every one of them every one of them every one of them in God you always want to think of God just think of seven every one of them had to go around seven times everyone if they left one child out those walls wouldn't have come down if they would have forgot one person in the old age home those walls would not have come down not one person seven because seven was Perfection God's perfect number and you can preach seven forever I preached the whole message and I Salvador on the Miracle of seven every scripture in the Bible finishes with seven Hallelujah do you know that the Bible says in Deuteronomy Amen in Deuteronomy that one person can flee a thousand but a family oh I know I put that in there two people husband and wife could flee 10,000 10,000 there's no mistakes in God's word children no mistakes don't ever think that this church in Wyoming is based on one person if if it is one person it's Christ but it's not it's not one flesh amen everybody is part of the family everybody Hallelujah and we nobody can put you in the family and nobody can take you out of the family Hallelujah the vibration powers that came from two million voices young old and strong you know see God God God watch this I want to show you something God wants to show you something why didn't God just have the army people go around the walls they were the trained ones why didn't he have just the people people follow with the lamb horns the trumpets why didn't he just have them carry the ark around and have the women kind of like cheering on the side no no no no why didn't he just send Joshua around leading the Army why didn't he send the Levites with the holy of holies say that went around there no no God said oh oh not just Levites not just the holy holies not just Joshua not just the army and not just the old but all but all and I want God's trying to show you something in the church and we we preached it the last day of the new like the last year of 23 you know as the church grows we're all gods and we have to respect each other as you respect each other you respect God like in a family not everybody can pick the restaurant not everybody can do whatever the one job is not everybody in the family can vacuum the house not every but it's still a family and what you're not doing you you just go off and do you know what I mean it'd be funny if you had seven people washing the dishes and the and one one Zinc at the same time you know but every joint is fly for together and the vibr ations of the all were more than the mortar and the stones and even Satan himself could handle amen and there's where you see it in Deuteronomy 32 30 where it says that two will drive 10,000 where I need you I need your friendship I need your kindness I need your everything we need each other amen we need we're stronger together brother Dale actually has bad days I know you maybe didn't know that that's why in a unit of a family when the wife is sad or the husband is the the one is nurturing the other hello hello it's a un you know when you see a family that's made in heaven it's not about I and what I get it's it's about we everything is about what we get we all get the blessings of God we all get the gifts of the Spirit we all get I don't care which one of you would speak in tongues prophesy run the aisles well I'll be screaming right beside you amen and if I can't scream I'll Stand really close so it splashes on me amen we got to Forfeit those what you say well I've been hurt amen that's part of God's plan you had to be hurt you must have been hurt to take something with you I don't mean to hurt either because the only thing you're leaving here is with character and the character proves how you dealt with the hurt just say praise the Lord may God bless you and be with you and help you and and give you all the gold to J and just amen Satan's trying to divide and conquer you know the prophet preached about putting your shoulder to the wheel and or mentioned things like this God God planned on it was for the it was it wasn't for the it was for the Prosper of God's kingdom it was just if we want to move a mountain if we're all there forking Stones over our head it's so much easier amen you watch the wildlife and I mentioned that before watch bison you know the the the before I go into that you see that the family unit you know when you look into God it was a unit that dwelt together and it was it was descendants from each other and they were part of of something and they were part of the other part of God you look at the Bison when the wolves come in you can think oh praise God I pray 24 hours a day seven days a week and I listen to the Bible when I'm sleeping and awake and and you know I can survive and amen now there is we all there's there's there's Seasons we all go through different season we may be in different situations you know but like where you're where you might go through a season where you're somewhat alone but God don't plan on you dying there you see what I'm saying you need to get out of that so I I going through a season where you're alone you're C you're going on your island of pmas and it's you and John and brother and God or or Paul how he went away you know you you'll get anchored and solid but you'll come back to the family you'll never stay there you'll never stay there because if you stay there there alone you'll die amen you'll stay there you'll die when you look at how God made us to be stronger together I'm telling you the prophet said that God himself going to do it you're not more holy than him amen and so we and and I I I know I I I understand that you might be going through a season where you're hurt so you kind of protect yourself that's okay you'll go through the season but you'll come out of it like the Harvest or spring season they'll last forever you know we're in the winter season now it won't last forever just wait 30 days to be changing amen watch this you know as as I study I I tell you it's it's just it's a thrill to look at God's word it it just blesses my heart and I'm spoiled to be able to do that but I want to something I'd never seen brother Brown tells the story and I'm gonna put a disclaimer down right off first he he names it a really unique name and I don't know why he did that and it so it has nothing to do with this but he tells the story about the Pentecost Al cursing I me tell you what it has nothing to do with Pentecostal Church experienced nothing it just because I've had that cursing amen and he said he said well what is the Pentecostal cursing he says it's when you're going down the road at night and you Dim your in the car you're meeting don't now we've all been there and if you were brother Dale and you were a little younger and stupid and forgive me God it might I hope it hasn't been I hope it's been a few months he'd [Music] say see the prophet told that story for a reason he said you Dim your lights and they don't and he said that's a Pentecostal cursy now I don't know why he named it that it that's not important he says you see let them alone he said you shouldn't do that no matter what the other person does just you let it show that you're What You're Made Of so I'm driving down the road with my wife many years ago I'm going to say it was many years ago and I dim my lights and somebody [Music] don't I just showed everybody that was present in that vehicle sadly probably my kids too forgive me guys what I was made of wow that's how simple it is he said you just showed them What You're Made Of he said let's get something down in here that shows love and respects and respects the next man and love him whether he's right or wrong I don't even care amen just any other Church whether whether you agree or don't just love and respect them does it matter Amen brother Bram said everybody has the right to choose their home chch and go where you feel the word of God's coming forth and where you feel uh you know amen that's an individual choice and so somebody else chooses something different you just wave at them go dig another well man what the prophet says here if you don't it shows What You're Made Of he showed I have multiple quotes and I just went through a whole bunch of them maybe we'll go through a bunch but he talked about he he he tells stories how he tells them and I try to show it in both but he says we're we're in the body of Christ and we'll raise up with respects for each other and move right on we just need to respect each other remove we need to respect that in a family nobody in my family is exactly the same you ever heard it I mean I don't mean this wrong but sometimes you'll see in the family I mean you say they never had the same parents and then one of the parents will speak up and say what wait a minute I was there you know what I mean they're that different my kids are as different as the black is from the the white amen but I was there amen and so us spiritually speaking will'll be different it don't God God loved the flower garden to be beautiful if it was all my color of flower would be disgusting but we're all beautiful amen and God planned that to work his spirit amen it was the it was the power and the unity of the family of God it was the bloodline that you know we Sayang about the power in the blood that power is pumping in your veins it's your made off of himself that's what brother Brown said God Made You off himself you know we we we we look into the scriptures and and and it's true that you know Christ came and paid the price for for the sins of the world and and only the family the predestinated would accept it but you today pay for the sins of the world and studying and I might come to this or not but multiple cases brother Brown said your reaction to an action will will literally make people's Eternal destination what's that make you makes you Christ what the prophet said amen you're you're it shows what you're of and and I know I got other ones in here multiple ones I'm not bringing that out of context he said in the visible Union here he says the kingdom of God you're part of the body of Christ and he said your life he said the things are right remember remember that you might he said this might sink in a little bit rough I this is oh this is my favorite quote you know I I wish I could portray to you how God works but like I I've been it it's it's just Supernatural I I I had this message I had joshu take for probably two or three months that I would preaches and and and I I mean I had my I I mean I had my message completely done and I woke up this morning with one thought and Len makes me a coffee and I'm just scrolling let me show you what God give me he said now you're a part of the family of God the body of Christ and he says now this may be a little rough but I want you to remember this to sink in he said let this this be dignosed for a while if you're in the body of Christ he doesn't need any amputations now why didn't God give me that two months ago because it wasn't the time see we can't be in the body of Christ we can't even be at church and start saying well yeah you're not well you can't uh well you you you're not a part oh oh well you're just the toe you're the hand you're not important you're just let let me read this invisible Union to God he said he doesn't have any uh amputations no his body is perfect God ain't asking you if we're perfect he's not asking for your condolence to what he made parents never once would go to the older kids and say do you think our new babies perfect they could care less what the older kids think they beat them into submission and so is God not asking you if the other part of the body is perfect it was God that brought him it was it came from him you got to get that you have to accept your brothers and sisters and they're different they're unique I'm just a little toe or maybe the toenail the little toe but if you go ahead and rip yours off this morning I'll bet you will hear some noise I probably could find a pair of pliers somewhere in this building go ahead and try it you say oh bless God you know we can't see it we can't hear it you know it don't just try to remove it he don't stop there he says his body is perfect it don't need any amputations amen wow he said that's the truth you know what nobody can put you in the body and nobody can take you out of the body to the church you see what I mean like some sometimes I know I know I know many of you sitting here have been misunderstood or mis accused and Mis this that don't worry just move on just just wave to it and say that it it gave you a lot of character it it made me said I love you praise God I'm glad that you're a rose and I love whatever you love honey she don't like roses she likes some weird flower amen help me out they're lot carnations they're a lot cheaper praise the Lord God knew I was poor amen Carnation forget the Roses bring on the carnations amen you see what I mean I couldn't stand carnations I thought everything about love was roses I mean there had to be red or pink and there had to be roses she said aie I hate roses so I said well sorry you're the wrong one I'm going to look for another no I said praise God I just save 15 bucks every time I that means we can't amputate the kids if they make noise we can't amputate somebody if their cell phone rings by mistake we can't amputate somebody if they come two minutes late or three minutes early we can't amputate you see me we can't amputate somebody if mum fries the eggs or you know it's not every meal I say I love what you just cook but I don't amputate it see spiritually just just smile and say praise God God you love carnations I'm going to buy roses amen there was no mistake the prophet put that in there what shows that you're in there it shows what's in down deep if I want to remove you which one of you that have the Spear of Christ would want somebody not to make just think of that actually don't think of it too long because that's terrible the Bible says that he would that none none that's kind of the opposite of all that none would be lost so we just we just see something that we don't agree with we say oh I just cut them off of my the vocabulary we we either think of amputation or building walls and some of the walls that have been built around here by some of you are big enough for chariots to ride on to and you're going to die in that City if you don't let God bring those walls down you know I visit dozens of ministers I don't have the same Doctrine as them does it don't matter it it does not even I don't even talk about it amen talk about what we like I think you got a cool shirt I think you got a cool tie don't matter God will lay it on my heart somebody I think you know would be nice to come through and minister to us and we've had a couple maybe one or two that we maybe would make the distance a lot longer before they come back but it I I don't I don't chase after them get the old horse whipped and say bless God it's not how we do it here amputation God's body was perfect I I might not understand all the let me let me just I know you're thinking brother Dale just dropped this does anybody here understand everything that works in your body you understand how you eat green grass and it brings out white milk and all these things and how your stomach works and how long really I don't care I'm just enjoying my body brother Matt I don't really care how it works I wish it was a little bit skinnier but I mean but like getting into the fine details hello we we're trying to take a sliver out of our brother's eye we got a think of a oak log in our own maybe maybe the prophet said thousand times you know pray for him I know I make mistakes do you know I I want to throw this in here I I considered even preaching a message on this you know every Minister and prophet in the Bible the people that lived with the flesh had trouble obeying the god the word you I have it I have two sheets on a clipboard at home and you look at some of the things the ministers did in the Bible two or three of them took all their clothes off the David was one one was uh search with an H I can't think of it some married prostitutes I mean I mean they David acted like a like uh David in the the middle of Psalms acted like he was like acted like a dumb man all you got to do is Wake till tomorrow I can give you the scriptures they're already on my list but when we live with each other see we see everything he's oh Dale he's a pig when he yeah I probably am God don't even care because this is just going to rot he's looking on the Inside Man and you see what you don't think this street let's bring it right up to almost our day most of the people that lived with brother Brandon that and their families are not still living with them but people that just got the word of God that came out of the mouth that had lots of failures they hung on to they said that's like this this body head you're looking at me funny you would be freaked out I think I had about 20 ministers and if I did anything that they did in the Bible you would walk go of this church I'd never see you again but I want to tell you something when I studied that God actually told those ministers to do what you'd walk out of this church for see those ministers never took all the clothes off on their own Moses never married you know who he married on his own David never acted like a dummy on his own when Saul was chasing him like a dumb man a drunk he he was actually blasphemed by the country he went through the CH you're looking at me funny they didn't you do you know do you know David's best friend in the studying I oh God forgive me I'm off my nose you know David's best friend that was falling and he was seeing all Dave stupid mistakes oh David I would oh David made his enemy come right in and give him a position in the church in the other guy's like oh David David that guy was just shooting at you last month do you want me to tell you something do want me to go to the fast part of the thing when David died and Solomon became the guy that had seen all David's mistakes and he was justified and right I can you not I can if if I preach this it'll be double it'll be double preach God killed them God killed them God had him killed and everything that he said was documented and it was it it was it was on scripture it was just ridiculous see so God I'm not promoting sin but like God had a chosen man so anybody that lives in the ministry and you know you come to my house and you see whatever you see you see what I mean that was the flesh but God had a chosen person inside there and so people seeing brother Brown they oh oh he you know he listen that was he he that but he had the word of God he was pcking the word of God with all those mistakes he was pcking the word of God at now wait a minute now I'm going to come to your level it's exactly like the family we start amping Tak people in the body oh you you you can't be you can't oh you can't be whoa wait a minute the prophet said don't do that he said you're part of the f I can't otate you okay all let me jump ahead you know the disciples when they went it was John that came to Jesus and uh it was Luke nine so I can give you the scripture and they came to Jesus just like message oh they're so happy said brother Matt you know I seen other people he was preaching and you know I I I remember you know and and or or she was Sunday school teacher and like oh I don't know if oh oh and he that's how they were telling Jes Jesus I seen some people they were casting out devils and and i' never seen them come to Wyoming Church before and and and and Jesus so I rebuked them I amputated him I said you can't be in the family [Music] hey these people lived with Jesus they knew how Jesus walked they knew how Jesus thought and you know what Jesus said he said if he's on our side and you just cut him off Jesus is like you just got my hand off and he also said But if he's not my hand does it matter I I still got my hand if he is my hand you amputate ah but if he's not just go dig another well you cursed them you you cursed them no that's in Loop n now now that was Jesus thoughts but we think oh well you know I've been in around the truth so long oh you're making me throw you're making God throw up let me shock you there's not everything that my family does there's not everything my kids do that I post on the internet but they're still my kids and they'll get all the promise that's coming to them you getting the picture that's just about as plain as you can get do you think God's proud of all the mistakes that brother Dale has no he's not proud of it but I'm getting the promise because I got Vindication that I was there you ain't going to take it you can you're going to go Blue pre it to me CU it it just won't it'll just go right in you can see right through it'll go right out the other side because there's no way you can take it from me I've received it you see what I mean amen I'm sorry let's go oh my hallelujah amen when you're part of the body of Christ it reveals the secrets that are to his people that's in God being misunderstood amen let me just watch this read I'm I'm going to close sometime this morning but let me read you another quote here and just go to where this this is in the Great Commission and he starts out here and he says if the devil can separate us that sounds like walls he's got a shooting at one another it don't matter if you agree or disagree it don't matter if they hurt you or didn't hurt you he said he's got an open Target that he wants to shoot at the Devil the devil's got an open Target that he wants to shoot at every one of you but before he does he realizes that we're shooting each other so he just gets a chair and sits down thank you very much I was going to do that myself that's like when Esther does the chores for me I say thank you honey I'm just going to stay in by the Woodfire amen he says he just sits down he says now this quote's two or three p and I'm not going to read it but he talks about he says you know if somebody did something wrong and it was wrong really wrong told a nontruth a lie misled just sin flat out sin he said if you would get Christ in your heart and you would get down in your prayer closet and you would get past the retaliation point and God could reveal to you what that person's going through think about that if you would get passive retaliation I'll get them might take me 25 years but brother Matt I'll remember sorry sorry brother M I don't know why I just he said if he can get you past the retaliation and he can and God himself can show you what that brother or sister is going through he said you'll get off your knees with the sympathy of Christ and run to the brother or sister and throw your arms around say I'm so sorry I I I just didn't know I just didn't know that you lost or your house or I just didn't know that I just didn't know I just didn't know know now God NE through the prophet he never ever give an excuse why you could retaliate and the person sinned completely wrong but it was a there was no justification for it but what he's saying is if you got the spirit of Christ you would understand and I'm not justifying sin but you would understand the struggle and the battle that they had buried loved ones or lost a baby or they hadn't had a baby or they' lost their house or they couldn't rent a house or it was cold and they weren't working or or there was something hello no we just load our pistol you I I I spent some time in the gun store this week in uh wherever it was magn M they were showing me they were showing me they were showing me a pistol grip pump shotgun that would hold seven shells and it'll look like something I should have but I got voted down I won't tell you who bu but that's what we do spiritually we have a pistol grip and we're flashing it all over in church bless God I wouldn't have picked her for the Sunday school teacher I would have done the Sunday School room different I wouldn't have I wouldn't have picked that time for church I wouldn't have had and Satan just God help us here is where he says this it he says you stand if You' stand shoulder Tosh shoulder with brother knowing that he's IM moral or the sister and maybe watch this this is the person that actually sinned against you like black and white he says well actually before that he says you if go if God through a amazing thing showed you what the brother had went through he said you'd be sympathizing with him get up off your knees and run over and be shaking his hand and he said you would recognize that he's IM mortal and in the presence of God uh wait sorry oh in the presence of God God don't condemn anybody but he sinned hey you know what now this is a paradox brother Dale is still studying it I could show you thousands of sins in here Abraham lied Isaac lied Rahab lied I mean that's only to begin that's just a number a few you know now now I mean that that's I mean we obviously you know the Bible says there will be no Liars in heaven you're going to have to ask God those questions but he says if God would show you that this brother or sister is just Immortal and maybe your maybe his destination rests upon your attitude towards them so if you pull your pistol grip and say I got proof I have three Witnesses bless God I even have a video camera says your Eternal destination then what person would want to condemn somebody to death when God in the presence of God wouldn't do that himself Hallelujah he said you had realize that every one of us is oh I don't like this part I think I'll stop there guilty bless God I'm I'm holy I got the Holy Ghost you would realize that every one of us are guilty and we all there's that all again I don't like that all need help one from another oh bless God I'm going to just I'm not going to church no more I'm just GNA serve God alone uh sorry I had a single sister tell me that one time it just it just it's just against all the laws of God Amen this isn't the Great Commission I'm not making this up this is a prophet preaching now he says we all need help one from the other and the best way to do that is pray wow amen we need each other and as as we travel this journey and we're preparing for a Rapture let's not fight in the family I I I there's I listen there some I we won't understand everything I don't understand my own kids I would never do that God help us you know the scripture where it talks about in Hebrews and it's so much more than Church you know and and even sharing with brother Carson and he's so right he's so right there's so much more to Fellowship than Church there's so much more to Fellowship than preaching the word yes the word's important you can play Croco at my house and be fellowshipping the prophet said to young people to keep them together as much as humanly possible amen you could I mean like we don't want the emphasis to be on playing croen but just go to somebody's house just not for no reason just because we're not made to be single solos we're we're not going into Glory single solo just me bless God it took him all these years to prepare a place for me to dwell oh boys oh boys Amen Let forsake not to some of yourself together that's Fellowship that's not just here on Sunday morning or Wednesday that's togetherness that's in your home remember the apostles churches were in homes man we could have a catar singing place any day of the week call me I'll be there amen but watch how it shows that scripture it says in like manner like some already have amen hallelujah I'm just finishing on some amen God help us here's the prophet talking about just just so many good he said he said but just wait a minute he said what we got what have we got he's he's telling another story he said we got nothing more than the rest of the to got that's exactly right as long as we're fussing and steing and carrying on among one another he said you need to clean your own steps first said the love of God God is love unless one another you have uh each one of you have these gifts right centered amen and it'll be uh selfless and or or it'll be if you don't have these gifts sorry it'll become selfish and indifference and it'll put it'll put it itself off and isolate yourself and as soon as you as soon as the devil Thrills walls and you isolate yourself from the family of God the body I and and and there's nobody doing that here obviously you're here today the immediate thing is you got to defend your stats so you got to fuss and stew because you're the only one that's right and all the other brothers and sisters they're all idiots in the family of God Amen that's amen God help us amen hallelujah here here's another one in why people can't keep the he said when you're going to see the Church of God all fell fellowshipping one with another without any friction at all he said now then you remember that the servants in the Bible they said oh Lord the Lord delays his coming and he said they began to devour one another and bite and fuss and stew and the Lord came and caught them that way and their lamps had no oil in them see and then they did they were cast into utter Darkness am man now we all would testify I'm sure of this the word at the going home time amen and we don't need to be fussing and stewing e even if we disagree it's okay to disagree I don't like the things my wife likes amen but I like her really fine am man she gets some Greek salad with meat with a toothpick stuck through it and it's got some kind of seasoning on it that would kill a horse amen and I'm just enjoying my large pizza amen it's all right amen I'm going to close with this in the thinking man's filter he said what's drawing what's drawing us through the word it's because you're a part of the body Body of Christ you're part of the family you're part of the body of Christ in this age and if the word is in you it can only draw through the word and the spirit will Quicken the word and only the word can live and here he says and this is the reason why he said the all the father's given me will come onto me now which one of us would want to amputate somebody that the father had given to Christ and we're going to try and take them out of God's hand but that's probably actually tried to happen to each one of us in different times so a mortal is going to fight God for who's in his head really amen he says all that he's given me will come to me and I will raise them up in the last day they might be raised up in the last day with thousands of mistakes in their body see the father he said he's a part of the body of Christ and that's what the world and predestination put in my heart amen you know they asked the Prophet this and it's not in this quote they asked the prophet they said who will be over there and he said ' if God put your name in The lm's Book of Life That's who will be there it don't matter how many times you fall down amen and that any man that's a real Christian and born again today and knows since he was a little kid or a little girl or either something like this that you've always couldn't get away from God there's just I don't care if you were a million miles from God I can remember and I mean your story will be different than mine and it'll be it could be better than mine but it don't matter where you were I can remember as a five or six year old kid being in services in Michigan in the Holiness Campground them giving an altar call and I would pledge to myself I am not going to that altar no matter what I would I would as much as tie myself down but I would go to the Altar and it was against every commitment and better judgment amen because you can't get away from what is inside you it's not possible you might make God don't even see those mistakes I'm just trying to close with God God don't I don't care if you were look at David murdered killed raped makes not God's just looking at he's looking at there's me and and all the other all his friends that are falling that flesh around they say really that's what they're saying about you that's what they're saying about me but if you got them you just say does does it matter what the people say no it don't matter you just smile does it okay as as as parents when you got three-year-old kids does it matter what your kids say to you as a parent I mean like for your own character no you're the parent it's it's like it's God's got it all in control just like a little tiny kid and he comes to his parent says you know he's two years old and says mommy I'm going to move out anybody watch Andy Griffith this boy wanted to move out and he wanted his dad to write the letter he said where are you going he said well I'm going he said but you can't tell me you're going he said and so and he started writing the letter he said now I'll never see you again he said well no no Daddy I want to see you but he said you can't see me because you're leaving you can't leave God not if it's God in you amen let's stand amen God help us if you didn't catch nothing this morning I hope you caught the quote where we can't amputate there's no script even based on sin and proof for amputation there's no just leave it alone you might not be able to fellowship with that just go dig another well just go because you don't want to be guilty of amputating something that God put in his hand you might not like that person could be going through like I mean he could be flat out blacki but that don't change predestination don't change predes and so a message like this is God saying we all have a voice like brother John was preaching we all have a voice you all have a Ministry but we're but respect we're all the one we're family to God you're one to God you're one oh yeah you'll work out your own individual salvation alone but to God he looks at a family God's not going to be sitting at the Pearly gate doors waiting just for brother Dale no because that would only be the toenail of the little toe and it wouldn't be big enough to put a wedding gown on you see what I'm I'm saying we're all in the body some are the ears the eyes the hair the face the I mean we're all and and you're never going to understand completely unless you're God how that body operates there's not a doctor today that understands or can reproduce the exact body that God created because it was Jehovah amen hallelujah amen God bless you this morning Hallelujah that story he became me so that I might [Music] [Music] become [Music] he [Music] all the e you e for [Music] all you the woru [Music] than [Music] pra thank you Lord h
