[27:12] that's uh under depression like got low
[27:15] self-esteem now that don't mean that
[27:17] you'll be uh proud
[27:22] but low self-esteem means you don't know
[27:25] who
[27:26] you are
[27:29] and Christ has told us who we are and I
[27:32] I just excited about something you know
[27:34] I I studied this much through the week
[27:36] and I I actually had many of these notes
[27:38] down last Sunday when I said we'd go
[27:40] this way but but months and months ago
[27:44] I bought us a study Bible
[27:48] and just this week I picked it up I
[27:51] actually actually it was just early this
[27:54] morning I picked it up and I was wanting
[27:56] to to really dig
[27:58] deep really deep I want to really prove
[28:01] to you Who You Are so you don't have low
[28:04] self-esteem
[28:06] and I got some real good nuggets from my
[28:09] study Bible Amanda we praise God for
[28:11] that Revelations 1 1. amen
[28:14] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[28:17] gave unto him
[28:18] to show unto his servants the things
[28:21] which shortly must come to pass and he
[28:24] sent it and signified it by his Angel
[28:28] unto his servants John Lord Jesus we
[28:31] pray that you'll come and Minister this
[28:33] morning and may your divine presence be
[28:35] in this place and may you bless every

[28:41] Jesus and those online and may you speak
[28:44] to each one of us in your name we pray
[28:46] amen you may have your seats this
[28:48] morning I want to preach on the
[28:50] revelation of Christ
[28:53] and you his bride
[28:56] and I know I want to clarify we have to
[28:59] be very careful when we dig into this
[29:01] and we might continue this next Sunday
[29:03] but the and many of many many many
[29:06] quotes I have in my drawer I never even
[29:08] I was planning on pulling them out and I
[29:09] had too much
[29:11] and I never did that
[29:14] but the prophet said that Christ
[29:16] was the anointed one
[29:19] the prophet said that Christ was the god
[29:22] in flesh
[29:24] Christ was the god tabernacled in Jesus
[29:29] amen
[29:32] hallelujah it's just beautiful I want to
[29:35] I want to read you a quote just right
[29:37] off the get-go and this just explains
[29:39] everything here in the 60 in the
[29:42] permanent Vision he said uh
[29:46] he's talking about John and he's reading
[29:48] the scriptures that we're going to read
[29:49] in 31 he said the greatest revelation of
[29:52] all
[29:54] is the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:57] and if you can get to that if you can
[29:59] get that
[30:01] and if you can't get that I'm sorry you
[30:04] won't get to first base
[30:06] until you believe that and walk out like
[30:11] Peter said repent
[30:12] and then see the deity baptized in the
[30:16] name of Jesus Christ the Revelation the
[30:18] remission
[30:20] for your sins and he said the first
[30:22] thing you have to know watch how he says
[30:25] it the Prophet this is not by perchance
[30:28] he said the first thing you have to know
[30:31] is the deity
[30:33] Christ
[30:35] see the word of God everything dovetails
[30:37] perfectly and if it doesn't there's a
[30:40] bump
[30:41] but the word of God said God is a spirit
[30:43] and those that worship Him must worship
[30:47] him in spirit and in truth amen and
[30:52] that's how it just comes together so
[30:54] beautifully that's why we know that
[30:56] Christ and he says here watch he said be
[30:58] careful John he said you're entering
[31:01] into the spirit and there's something
[31:02] going to be revealed to you you know the
[31:05] definition of revelation is something
[31:06] that's revealed
[31:08] and when it's revealed to you nobody can
[31:10] take it from you we mentioned that this
[31:12] way and and here's the prophet saying he
[31:14] said he said what is it he said the
[31:16] trumpet sound the first thing he said
[31:17] was here here God was talking to John
[31:20] revealing himself and in Revelations 1
[31:22] 13 He said I am Alpha
[31:25] and Omega and that being interpreted in
[31:28] the Greek Alpha means a and Omega means
[31:32] Zed he said I'm the beginning and the
[31:35] end from out and everything it's just
[31:37] amazing it's just it's just God how
[31:41] perfect God is I mean he just leaves no
[31:44] doubt at all
[31:46] no doubt there will be no excuses
[31:50] who he is
[31:52] Hallelujah he said I'm at the Alpha and
[31:56] Omega the first thing and that let them
[31:58] know who he was he said who was this
[32:01] approaching he said is it this King
[32:04] Jesus the king God or the king Holy
[32:08] Ghost he said I am from a
[32:11] to Zed
[32:13] Hallelujah
[32:14] praise God
[32:17] I want to show you something this
[32:19] morning that shows you
[32:22] who we are and and there was things that
[32:25] was amazing that that I you know I I
[32:28] heard a minister Minister and he gave me
[32:31] a nugget and I dug and I dug and I dug
[32:33] really deep
[32:34] amen
[32:36] but we we need to realize because it's
[32:39] going home time and we need to realize
[32:41] who we are now that's not Cockiness
[32:43] that's not arrogant that's not proud but
[32:47] it's also knowing who you are amen it's
[32:50] also not living below your privileges
[32:52] you know Junior preached up you pray for
[32:54] junior we he asks his boss to be to be
[32:57] held over before he goes home because we
[33:00] would like to have him as one of our
[33:01] ministers in our in our dedication
[33:04] anniversary meetings in November the 1st
[33:06] of November and I'm actually going to
[33:08] talk to his boss this week and his boss
[33:10] said he would get back to him amen but
[33:13] you know Junior preached a message a
[33:14] year ago on getting in the spirit
[33:17] and the and one of the problems that we
[33:19] have as Believers and and message
[33:21] Believers is we don't get in the spirit
[33:24] you know I want to give you an example
[33:25] and this is just up in Revelations John
[33:28] says he said I was in the spirit on the
[33:29] Lord's Day and and you know God helped
[33:32] brother Dale because because
[33:35] that's where we need to be to be fed by
[33:38] God Amen God's a spirit you know he said
[33:40] when I when I see my girls and my wife

[34:12] recommending I don't I don't do that but
[34:15] you know you pay like 200 and you got to
[34:17] take an oxygen tank because they put you
[34:20] in an elevator and you're up in the
[34:21] clouds and you got to take binoculars
[34:22] and that and somebody hits a home run
[34:24] everybody
[34:27] okay it's not because they hit the home
[34:29] run
[34:31] it's because you were in the spirit
[34:33] because it cost you money cost you 200
[34:36] and you prepared and you took your
[34:38] oxygen tank and you climbed 75 million
[34:41] flights of stairs if they didn't have an
[34:43] elevator and they packed you in like
[34:45] sardines you're right beside a big fat
[34:46] guy that's
[34:47] okay
[34:49] and you're so happy because somebody
[34:51] that you have nothing it's no benefit to
[34:54] you at all it actually hurt and cost you
[35:00] uh-huh
[35:01] and God forgive us when you see them do
[35:04] the wave in the arena I've been in those
[35:07] in my past life
[35:09] thank you Jesus when I was a teenager
[35:12] I've been there when they did the wave
[35:20] I've never seen that in church
[35:23] the wave
[35:25] because see they were in the spirit
[35:27] and John was in the spirit and John do
[35:29] you think this you think it was easy for
[35:31] John he was in a prison he was an island
[35:34] of Patmos or with rattlesnakes they put
[35:36] them there no like knowing that nobody
[35:39] would Escape or live
[35:41] it wasn't a pretty situation and he
[35:43] didn't have no drive through McDonald's
[35:44] or Pizza Hut
[35:46] amen
[35:49] and he also never had any weapons to
[35:51] kill or eat
[35:53] and I would be really concerned at how
[35:55] often they were worried about how often
[35:57] he ate
[36:00] Rome
[36:02] no
[36:03] it's the same spirit
[36:05] Rome's not concerned how often you eat
[36:07] today either
[36:08] Same Spirit
[36:13] Hallelujah
[36:15] thank you Lord Jesus so we've
[36:17] established that he's the Alpha and
[36:19] Omega
[36:20] the beginning and the end but you know I
[36:22] had never seen this and I I got a nugget
[36:24] I'm going to give I got a nugget from
[36:26] Pastor Abraham and then I dug and dug
[36:28] and Doug and Doug
[36:30] amen
[36:31] let's read the scriptures Revelations
[36:33] 11.
[36:36] one Revelations I'm sorry Revelations 1
[36:40] 11-13
[36:42] amen
[36:43] and you know uh well we'll read the
[36:46] scripture and then we'll
[36:48] we'll go into this saying here here's
[36:51] God revealing to John now now listen if
[36:55] God revealed this to John he certainly
[36:57] wants his wife to know who you are who
[37:00] he is he said I am Alpha and Omega the
[37:03] first and the last what thou seeest
[37:05] write in a book and send it unto the
[37:08] seven churches now that's us that's
[37:10] brother Dale which are in Asia and he
[37:14] goes in and maims all the churches let's
[37:15] go to the next verse
[37:17] amen some of those words are
[37:19] big words Church all the church ages
[37:22] including us
[37:23] and John turned this is a part this this
[37:26] is beautiful and John turned and he said
[37:29] I seen a voice
[37:32] and this voice is walking
[37:34] and you know many times you can look in
[37:36] the scriptures and the voice walked in
[37:39] the scriptures
[37:40] that spake unto me
[37:43] and being turned I saw seven
[37:45] candlesticks that these Kevin candle
[37:48] kicks are obviously the seven Church
[37:50] ages and they were dark and the
[37:53] candlesticks were topped into who
[37:55] Hallelujah they were tapped into Christ
[37:58] the anointed one amen because Christ is
[38:01] everything see it's not about brother
[38:03] Dale and it's not about you but it but
[38:06] but it is because we're in Christ
[38:09] oh that's beautiful amen and this is
[38:12] where I want and in the midst of the
[38:14] Candlestick now I'm going to tell you
[38:15] something until I seen this and I
[38:17] studied this greatly I've studied this
[38:19] since we heard him preach oh months ago
[38:23] amen
[38:25] I've never seen this he said in the
[38:28] candlesticks one like
[38:31] now he's talking about Christ
[38:33] he says one like unto the son of man
[38:36] this is God now John knew what Christ
[38:38] looked like
[38:41] but he didn't say it was Christ
[38:44] do you know in this scripture I'm going
[38:47] to prove to you by the Bible and our
[38:50] prophet that that was you
[38:54] I never seen that before
[38:58] you know because
[39:00] the Bible says this that when when God
[39:04] that the calvary happened in God's mind
[39:07] before the foundation of the world when
[39:09] he thought it it was finished
[39:11] man the the film hadn't happened
[39:14] but in his mind it had our Christ had
[39:16] already been crucified in his mind it
[39:19] was a finished work that's why he said
[39:20] I've already seen you in glory those
[39:23] that I predestinated called justify I've
[39:26] already
[39:27] glorified I think the whole it's Amen so
[39:31] this ain't being proud this ain't being
[39:32] cocky you know a a good relationship in
[39:36] marriage you won't see the husband or
[39:37] wife either way either way being cocky
[39:39] or or arrogant to each other but it's
[39:42] knowing that like it's just like it's
[39:44] just like peace unspeakable
[39:47] and
[39:48] beautiful
[39:50] it's perfection
[39:51] amen and so here John said I seen one
[39:54] like
[39:56] but it wasn't until the son of man
[39:58] clothed in the Garment down to his foot
[40:00] and girdled about with uh help me out
[40:03] hunt Pops Pops I'm sorry I know we tried
[40:06] that all week I would talk to Luanne all
[40:08] weekend
[40:09] forget my retardedness pops
[40:11] with the golden girl
[40:13] now you know what those pops are
[40:16] the bride
[40:18] I didn't know that
[40:21] I'm just being honest with you
[40:25] our Prophet told us that
[40:27] the Bible tells us that
[40:30] pops
[40:31] our breasts
[40:35] and so when John in Revelations before
[40:38] you were even
[40:40] born
[40:41] Christ
[40:43] was in his bride
[40:45] and when John looked he said I seen it
[40:47] look like Jesus but it was light
[40:50] it was it was almost like
[40:55] oh buddy you're never going to get
[40:57] anything better than this
[40:59] Hallelujah let's just go to
[41:03] um
[41:04] oh let me go I got a scripture here
[41:06] let's go to uh
[41:08] put it down here I got to find it
[41:10] Revelations
[41:13] um right there Revelation 15 6.
[41:17] now this here
[41:19] this was my study Bible
[41:21] it puts a letter right by the beginning
[41:23] of girded about by the pipes
[41:27] 15 6. and the seventh angel came out of
[41:30] the temple having seven plagues closed
[41:33] in pure white linen having their
[41:37] perhaps
[41:40] breast
[41:41] girded with a golden girdle you know
[41:44] what the prophet said the girdle was the
[41:47] Gospel of the word
[41:49] Hallelujah you know what the spirit of
[41:51] Crisis this morning the gospel it's the
[41:54] beautiful gospel the message it's not
[41:57] even a it's a message but it's the
[41:59] gospel of Christ
[42:00] you are the gospel and so Christ today
[42:03] is here in spirit form Tabernacle in his
[42:06] bride in the gospel
[42:10] Hallelujah now I I if we get there if we
[42:14] don't want to be next week I'll read the
[42:16] quotes where the Prophet said that
[42:18] I have a stack here and it's scary if I
[42:20] read them all
[42:21] because we've been here a long time
[42:23] amen that's amazing
[42:32] that John on the island of Patmos seen
[42:35] brother Dale
[42:36] in what looked to be
[42:39] it looked similar to Christ
[42:42] oh boy's old boys
[42:47] and you were afraid of asking for a baby
[42:52] and you were afraid of asking for your
[42:54] asset potatoes
[42:56] you're healed you know the prophets in
[42:57] the quotient said you can't preach
[42:59] salvation without preaching healing do
[43:01] you know when they put the brass serpent
[43:02] up like I'm disco I'm just shooting from
[43:04] there when they put the brass servant up
[43:06] that was because of snake bites and so
[43:08] when they would get a bit they would
[43:10] look to that and be safe say from what
[43:12] the snake bite
[43:13] it was about healing
[43:16] it was healing its salvation
[43:19] hey man
[43:21] you can't be saved if you're dead
[43:25] oh that's beautiful
[43:28] amen and so let's let's look at what the
[43:32] prophet says here and I for this quote I
[43:34] got to pull my my glasses on because
[43:36] it's just on my iPad
[43:38] and this is a spoken word the original
[43:39] co-62 he said paragraph 158 he said now
[43:43] notice the harmony that Jesus never did
[43:45] anything until he was seen by the father
[43:49] I'm going somewhere Harmony
[43:52] what what do you say about a
[43:53] relationship we said what'd we say we
[43:56] said Peace the prophet said Harmony I
[43:59] said it was beautiful Harmony is
[44:01] beautiful a beautiful relationship
[44:03] nobody's cocky nobody's arrogant
[44:06] but but each know who they are
[44:09] because they're actually one
[44:13] hello one
[44:16] okay natural types of spiritual he said
[44:18] why it's a beautiful Harmony that Jesus
[44:20] never did anything until the father seen
[44:22] him or the father showed him first
[44:23] Harmony between God and Christ see John
[44:26] and he gives the scripture John 5 19.
[44:29] and so we and so will the bride
[44:32] because he showed her the word of life
[44:35] and he showed her and she receives it
[44:37] and she never doubts it and nothing can
[44:40] harm her hello
[44:42] harmer you know I back to by scripture
[44:45] you know I was thinking I actually don't
[44:48] bring those all the scriptures where it
[44:50] said in Genesis which Genesis was a c
[44:53] chapter about having a family
[44:56] amen and I don't even have them right on
[44:58] my thing but amen
[45:01] hallelujah we're afraid
[45:03] we've been afraid of the past God's
[45:06] commandment is
[45:08] that you populate and replenish the
[45:10] Earth and you want me to tell you
[45:12] something else he said this is where it
[45:14] was this this is not I did not bring
[45:16] this amen and Seed in Genesis
[45:21] hello
[45:23] no no no I don't think that went from
[45:25] well wait a minute you need to get
[45:27] converted first and every seed
[45:29] hello
[45:30] will bring forth of
[45:37] and you say did God tell you that I was
[45:39] going to have a baby the word of God
[45:41] told me I was going to have a baby and
[45:43] every single breaks watches the double
[45:45] tapes the seed is your own kind yourself
[45:47] your flesh and the bride the spirit
[45:52] oh praise God Amen
[45:56] amen and you'll never doubt it and
[45:58] you'll never she'll never doubt it
[45:59] nothing can harm her not even death for
[46:02] the seed was planted and the water that
[46:03] raised up
[46:06] amen raised up and watered it he meant
[46:08] Hallelujah he said now here's the secret
[46:10] and I've read this part before
[46:13] he said here's the secret the word is in
[46:16] the bride
[46:17] and the mind of Christ
[46:19] to know what he wants done with the word
[46:23] now
[46:25] the word is in the bride but the bride
[46:29] will know that every seed will bring
[46:31] forth of its kind that's God's will
[46:32] because that was a Commandment that was
[46:34] a commandment
[46:36] so it ain't God holding back your seed
[46:39] God commanded it
[46:41] amen we didn't bring the box yet but
[46:43] we're going to bring a box start
[46:44] bringing in baby yes
[46:46] amen it's it's finished
[46:48] it's history
[46:50] amen but it's brand new
[46:53] amen
[46:54] he said here's the secret the word is in
[46:56] the bride and they have the mind of
[46:57] Christ and they know what he wants done
[46:58] with the word and she does it in his
[47:01] name
[47:03] and he didn't say she prayed for it
[47:05] although we do believe in praying he
[47:07] said she has
[47:09] thus saith
[47:12] it don't get no better than that
[47:15] so Brother Joseph and sister Myra and
[47:17] brother Tim and sister Vicki
[47:20] next year about this time you're going
[47:22] to be rocking now really hopefully too
[47:26] amen

[47:36] to repopulate the Earth

[48:31] happen I can't make up the stuff
[48:33] and the doctor said
[48:35] well congratulations Julie you are six
[48:37] months pregnant
[48:40] she's like
[48:42] oh
[48:44] yep
[48:46] amen
[48:49] Hallelujah
[48:50] and it germatizes in the Holy Spirit
[48:52] Waters it amen that's why he says the
[48:55] Bible says that he's the high priest of
[48:58] your confession I will have a baby about
[49:02] this time not sure
[49:04] amen confessions amen
[49:08] and the spirit and it and it on that
[49:12] Spirit Waters it it until it grows
[49:16] and serves its purpose
[49:22] it'll take about a year
[49:24] until it grows
[49:28] oh praise God and they do only his Willy
[49:33] man and they believe that and no one can
[49:35] uh Percy persuade them differently
[49:39] for they have thus saith the Lord or
[49:41] they keep still then they will do the
[49:43] works of God for it is himself in them
[49:48] it is now that's what our Prophet said
[49:50] and John looked in Romans he said it
[49:53] looks like
[49:54] it looks like Jesus but he's got Pops
[50:02] oh Christ and his bride
[50:05] and God is the spirit and those
[50:09] amen the prophet said if you have a
[50:11] spoonful of the ocean or you have the
[50:13] whole ocean we all got spoonfuls and
[50:15] we're going to pour it in a bucket this
[50:16] morning we're going to Splash it and
[50:17] we've got part of the ocean
[50:19] man that's why we come together so we
[50:22] can see the waves because we pour all
[50:25] our spoonfuls together and then we can
[50:26] get waves
[50:28] oh wow and it moves all the trash and
[50:30] dodo to the outside beautiful
[50:33] amen and we believe that no one can
[50:36] persuade them differently for them thus
[50:39] saith the Lord or they keep still and
[50:41] then they would do the watch this and
[50:43] then they will do the works of God for
[50:46] it is himself in them continuing his
[50:50] word to fulfill it as he didn't complete
[50:54] it
[50:56] in his day
[51:00] so Jesus left something for us to do
[51:04] oh buddy
[51:07] and all these things when he was here he
[51:10] did not you know he repeats us
[51:13] he didn't not complete all
[51:16] when he was here for it was not yet
[51:24] but it's time now
[51:25] because we're here
[51:27] we're here
[51:28] and it's time
[51:30] oh Church
[51:32] can you see that
[51:35] you could know
[51:37] oh that's beautiful
[51:40] and see if when you were in Christ
[51:45] when you were in Christ and John seen
[51:48] you and it and it looked familiar but he
[51:51] couldn't put his finger on it it was
[51:52] because brother John hadn't met the wife
[51:59] he hadn't met the group
[52:01] but he couldn't like
[52:04] put his finger
[52:07] oh my God
[52:10] Hallelujah you know I want to just step
[52:13] back from this for a second and and
[52:15] we're I'm in a
[52:16] there's multiple multiple quotes
[52:19] where the Prophet Vindicated what the
[52:22] Bible says multiple times but see every
[52:25] time Jesus comes
[52:27] to do something he always showed us
[52:30] before he can
[52:32] it's why there'll be no excuses so watch
[52:35] this in the Bible here we have the story
[52:37] of Joseph
[52:38] which was a perfect type
[52:41] of Jesus
[52:43] one of the most perfect now there was
[52:45] other people that were close types amen
[52:48] David was tight because he prayed over
[52:50] Jerusalem then Jesus came and he prayed
[52:52] over Jerusalem I I would have pulled you
[52:54] into myself
[52:56] but you would not
[52:57] so there's other types but Joseph
[53:00] did the most types
[53:03] and let me just show you and so watch
[53:05] this so
[53:07] Jesus knows there will be a need
[53:10] and so he sends a need somebody that can
[53:13] provide that need
[53:16] before the needs ever there
[53:22] Joseph
[53:23] God knew that there would be a famine
[53:25] and a need to survive life in Joseph's
[53:28] family which was Israel the beginning of
[53:31] Israel man Jacob and his family
[53:34] and so he sent Joseph there to create
[53:36] the need exactly like he did with Christ
[53:40] he knew there would be a need in brother
[53:42] Dale the brother Dale couldn't take care
[53:44] of it
[53:45] and so he sent Jesus
[53:48] oh thank you Lord
[53:50] and he took care of all those needs
[53:52] and now everything's on the table
[53:56] and you could no more doubt than Christ
[53:59] could could doubt
[54:01] man watch watch and so here when Moses
[54:05] came on the scene and and believe me I'm
[54:07] all over this the scriptures but let's
[54:09] pull up Exodus 3 and 13 and 15. and here
[54:12] here's Moses after Joseph's life and
[54:15] we're going to go back and show you all
[54:16] the comparisons of Joseph's life but
[54:18] here's Moses after they've been in Egypt
[54:21] you know do you know in studying this
[54:24] story and and listening to it and this
[54:27] week and and everything I was you know
[54:29] because we're a Triune being we got
[54:31] flesh and spirit our flesh gets us in
[54:33] trouble
[54:35] see you know every time there was a
[54:37] problem in the Bible it was because of
[54:39] Flesh
[54:40] you know when Abraham lied it was
[54:42] because Israel was in a famine
[54:46] because he went for more riches he went
[54:48] for food or riches you say whatever you
[54:50] meant when when when when when Joseph's
[54:54] brothers came to Egypt
[54:56] they didn't come because they
[55:00] they like money
[55:02] and then because they lacked money they
[55:04] got in slavery
[55:06] wow you gotta be careful with that money
[55:09] stuff
[55:11] because it could enslave you
[55:13] uh-huh and now Jesus will deliver you
[55:16] and he did he did in every case he
[55:19] delivered he delivered Abraham like when
[55:21] Sarah delivered Sarah and Kappa appear
[55:23] for the seed to come forth Isaac and all
[55:26] these things but see it was the flesh
[55:28] that got in the way
[55:30] watch this so here here so here here
[55:32] here's here's Joseph's brothers go down
[55:35] to Egypt for food for money
[55:38] that was all flesh
[55:40] they didn't like it in the spirit
[55:42] there was a famine
[55:44] uh-huh be careful where you move to get
[55:47] a job
[55:50] it might be in slavery
[55:56] might be
[55:57] might be multiple cases in the Bible
[55:59] like that ain't that amazing
[56:02] God shows them to us so we recognize
[56:04] be careful with this Badger skin it'll
[56:07] mislead you
[56:08] and so but but Amazing Grace an amazing
[56:13] Mercy stops out and he says here's my
[56:15] children of Israel and they came for
[56:17] food and they're so comfortable here in
[56:19] Egypt now watch this I know you're going
[56:22] to think they weren't
[56:24] they complained to Moses because they
[56:25] were more comfortable being slaves
[56:35] than being headed to the promised land
[56:39] they were headed to the promised land
[56:41] and they said but if we would have
[56:43] stayed back there at least they would
[56:44] have fed us
[56:46] and gave us water
[56:49] careful with that bad your skin it'll
[56:51] it'll pull you away
[56:53] amen and here's Moses and but but watch
[56:56] this Amazing Grace and amazing mercy God
[56:59] says I'll still deliver you
[57:02] eat
[57:06] that's exactly what he said to brother
[57:07] Dale
[57:09] and to every one of Youth here with the
[57:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[57:14] don't you get that
[57:16] that's what Christ was that's what
[57:18] Calvary was
[57:19] he says your your flesh misled you and
[57:23] now you're in Egypt in slavery and I'll
[57:25] send Moses
[57:27] I'll send Jesus
[57:29] and he will take you out by a mighty
[57:31] hand
[57:34] oh church this Bible is unbelievable
[57:38] it's amazing it's just
[57:43] that's why our Prophet said when he was
[57:44] preaching he said I could preach forever
[57:46] it wouldn't take nothing but I see One
[57:47] Vision I'm tired
[57:49] it's amazing and God put this all out
[57:52] there and God's opened our eyes and we
[57:54] can see him
[57:57] and now we're getting to the states that
[57:59] I want you to be ahead of John
[58:01] that when you look you say it was like
[58:04] unto the son of Matthew
[58:06] but that was like onto
[58:09] Christ and his bride
[58:11] I see him both
[58:13] in one
[58:15] both in one in perfect what did he say
[58:18] Harmony
[58:19] amen and let's read 13 to 15. and Moses
[58:23] said unto God behold when I come unto
[58:26] the children of Israel
[58:27] and I shall say unto them that God of
[58:30] thy fathers has sent me
[58:32] unto you and they shall say on
[58:36] and they shall say unto me what is
[58:39] his name
[58:42] huh
[58:43] I love that
[58:46] what is what is God's name think of this
[58:48] the revelation of Jesus
[58:51] Christ
[58:54] the anointed one
[58:56] the Alpha and Omega he said what is his
[59:00] name what shall I say unto the Mrs
[59:02] Exodus 3 15 13-15 we're reading 14. what
[59:07] shall I say unto them this is Moses I
[59:09] said God Exodus 3 14 is where we're at
[59:12] this is Moses I said God who should I
[59:15] tell them you are I'm telling you this
[59:17] morning that the spirit is telling you
[59:18] that you are a part of Christ
[59:21] you were seen in Christ in Revelations
[59:25] it's actually in the Bible I mean I
[59:27] showed you what it was I'm going to show
[59:29] you more scriptures
[59:31] and here's God says unto Moses you say I
[59:34] am
[59:35] that I am
[59:40] what kind of a name is
[59:43] name it see you wanted to put Jesus in a
[59:45] box
[59:47] but we have Mrs Jesus Mrs Jesus Mrs
[59:50] Jesus Mrs Christ
[59:56] and even God said man
[1:00:00] wow there's a lot of names
[1:00:03] I am that I am
[1:00:05] and he said Thou shalt Thou shalt thou
[1:00:09] say unto the children of Israel that I
[1:00:12] am
[1:00:13] has sent me unto you
[1:00:18] powerful
[1:00:21] see we can't put God in a box
[1:00:24] amen because God is a spirit and the
[1:00:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost is God
[1:00:30] and so when you're packing the baptism
[1:00:32] of the Holy Ghost you have a teaspoon of
[1:00:35] God
[1:00:36] so what is God's name
[1:00:39] well we could say well God's name is
[1:00:40] brother day oh brother mine brother
[1:00:41] Joe's brother my sister Ruth brother all
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:46] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:48] what are you going to do with the I am
[1:00:52] or Alpha and Omega like
[1:00:55] hey man
[1:00:57] oh that's that's pretty hard to put that
[1:00:58] God In The Box
[1:01:00] that's amazing amen 15. and God said
[1:01:03] moreover unto you Moses that's how
[1:01:07] they'll say unto the children of evil
[1:01:08] the Lord God of thy fathers the god of
[1:01:11] Abraham the god of Isaac the god of
[1:01:13] Jacob has sent you and this is his name
[1:01:17] and this is a memorial on to brother
[1:01:21] Dale
[1:01:22] it says that
[1:01:25] you got to put your name in the Bible
[1:01:28] unto all all
[1:01:32] right up to Wyoming
[1:01:34] Generations
[1:01:38] so I am up till now
[1:01:44] am I making this up is it is this the
[1:01:46] Bible
[1:01:48] that's amazing
[1:01:52] and we were worried about pasta potatoes
[1:01:54] we were worried about speaking the word
[1:01:58] well God never spoke to me in a prophecy
[1:02:03] but God spoke through his word before he
[1:02:05] ever had
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:11] amen look at the types
[1:02:13] see how Jesus sent Moses
[1:02:18] Jesus sent Joseph to make a way for
[1:02:22] Israel
[1:02:23] from the family
[1:02:25] Jesus raised up mode they went right
[1:02:27] into slavery walked right into it Jesus
[1:02:29] raised up Moses to take him out with a
[1:02:32] mighty hand just like them are all types
[1:02:34] of Christ raising us up redeeming us
[1:02:37] back
[1:02:38] amen going to the pawn shop and taking
[1:02:41] the rightful owner this was mine I got
[1:02:44] robbed I got robbed about 1968 on a cold
[1:02:48] day in January

[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:19] how many times he did that
[1:03:22] look at how God protected Abraham when
[1:03:24] he lied about Sarah because he was going
[1:03:26] for more money he was going for food
[1:03:29] amen look at how all these examples
[1:03:34] amen here we see Joseph and we're going
[1:03:37] to go back to our Texan and close with
[1:03:39] some of these types of who you are
[1:03:41] Joseph was hated of his own what's the
[1:03:44] Bible say Jesus came to his own and his
[1:03:46] own received him not
[1:03:48] Joseph was in his own family and they
[1:03:50] hated him you know why oh I I'm having a
[1:03:55] good time preaching this morning his
[1:03:56] father liked them
[1:03:59] my father likes me
[1:04:04] Jehovah the I am
[1:04:07] the world what's the Bible say if you
[1:04:10] were of the world they love you but
[1:04:11] because you're not of the world and
[1:04:13] you're of the father
[1:04:15] that it ain't love that
[1:04:18] hate you because God Almighty loves you
[1:04:24] Joseph's brothers hated him
[1:04:27] now did he do anything to deserve that
[1:04:29] hate
[1:04:30] him did you
[1:04:32] nope
[1:04:36] that's amazing
[1:04:37] I mean my little brain can only take so
[1:04:40] much
[1:04:44] Hallelujah he was also hated because he
[1:04:47] seen visions and dreams and was very
[1:04:48] spiritual
[1:04:54] was that did Joseph have anything to do
[1:04:56] with being predestinated
[1:04:58] no no see he wasn't trying to draw
[1:05:02] hatred onto himself
[1:05:05] amen it just
[1:05:09] it just happened because of who he was
[1:05:12] he was what's the Bible say
[1:05:13] after my name's sake they're in the new
[1:05:15] they can't think of the scripture there
[1:05:17] and it says he said you know they stoned
[1:05:19] the prophets and killed me what are you
[1:05:21] expecting
[1:05:23] hello
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:26] here here a type of that he says
[1:05:33] here they hated him because he was
[1:05:37] spiritual
[1:05:38] and seeing visions watch what they told
[1:05:41] Jesus when he says before Abraham was
[1:05:44] I am
[1:05:47] and they picked up Stones brother Matt
[1:05:48] and he said
[1:05:51] oh Father Abraham we love him but but
[1:05:55] being just a child and say you were born
[1:05:57] before Abraham oh boy they were as blind
[1:06:00] as bats
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:08] Joseph was left for dead
[1:06:11] Jesus was left for dead Joseph was sold
[1:06:13] for 20 pieces of silver Jesus was so
[1:06:17] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:06:19] still Seaver silver
[1:06:21] Joseph was wrongfully betrayed and
[1:06:24] accused falsely Jesus
[1:06:27] was wrongfully accused
[1:06:31] falsely man here's here's pilate says
[1:06:34] art thou the Son of God they're saying
[1:06:38] that you've cursed God because I'm the
[1:06:40] son of God
[1:06:41] that same spirit's alive and well very
[1:06:43] well
[1:06:44] you didn't mean to tell me that the
[1:06:46] spirit of God is tabernacled inside of
[1:06:48] the ones that go to the Wyoming church
[1:06:50] and other worldwide bride around the
[1:06:52] world
[1:06:53] that's a little bit extreme
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:03] but Jesus say he never even he said
[1:07:05] you've spoken it
[1:07:08] he was in prison he was forgotten by his
[1:07:11] friends
[1:07:12] you know when Joseph was in prison and
[1:07:14] and the two people were threw into
[1:07:16] prison the the uh the cook and the
[1:07:18] janitor I think it was I'm maybe saying
[1:07:21] that wrong and Joseph interpreted their
[1:07:23] dreams and he said the cook was killed
[1:07:25] and the other one wasn't killed and
[1:07:27] Joseph said now when you get out don't
[1:07:28] forget about me
[1:07:32] and he did
[1:07:35] when Jesus died on the Crosser went to
[1:07:37] pray how many people went with them
[1:07:39] his friends
[1:07:41] forgot about him
[1:07:43] hey man
[1:07:45] and Joseph sat at the right hand of
[1:07:47] pharaoh with your right hand in the
[1:07:48] scriptures always power it's not
[1:07:52] you know in in Christ and in God it's
[1:07:55] never two people it was always power
[1:07:58] and Jesus went ascended up into heaven
[1:08:01] and in power sits his right hand of the
[1:08:05] father
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:11] worshiping Joseph was worshiped when he
[1:08:14] was raised up
[1:08:16] he was raised up they would blow the
[1:08:18] trumpets and say he's coming he's coming
[1:08:21] he's coming
[1:08:22] and every knee would bow down because
[1:08:24] because watch this
[1:08:26] it wasn't just because of a king's
[1:08:28] commandment
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] it was that
[1:08:35] but this is going to shock you Joseph
[1:08:39] had brought salvation
[1:08:42] he'd saved their lives
[1:08:45] and Jesus
[1:08:47] and that great day every Neo bow and
[1:08:50] every tongue will confessed
[1:08:54] but the king of kings
[1:08:57] seen brother Dale
[1:08:59] and saved my life
[1:09:01] and oh it's just beautiful
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:07] and Joseph also made Provisions for
[1:09:09] others
[1:09:12] and Jesus
[1:09:13] many Provisions for others
[1:09:16] amazing the types
[1:09:20] in the Bible man let's turn to Luke 11
[1:09:22] 27 and we'll go a little faster and and
[1:09:25] close here soon but just I want to prove
[1:09:28] how you were in Christ that you were in
[1:09:31] Christ when John seen him on the island
[1:09:33] Patmos
[1:09:35] okay
[1:09:37] and it came to pass this is just proven
[1:09:39] I've already read Revelations there
[1:09:42] where it said it was and it came to pass
[1:09:44] that as he spake these things a certain
[1:09:46] woman complied and lifted up her voice
[1:09:48] and said unto him blessed is the womb
[1:09:50] the bear that bear thee and the pops
[1:09:53] which thou has sucked
[1:09:57] now see it called pops
[1:10:00] breast
[1:10:01] and John seeing the breast when he seen
[1:10:03] the son of man
[1:10:05] in Revelations
[1:10:06] it was Christ in his wife
[1:10:09] they were onseparable
[1:10:11] they were one body
[1:10:15] it it looked on almost like she
[1:10:20] like a man it almost looked like a man
[1:10:23] from the backside
[1:10:26] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] Luke 23 and 29 or yeah 23 and 29 and
[1:10:32] behold in the days are coming which also
[1:10:34] say blessed is the baron and the pipes
[1:10:38] which never gave suck
[1:10:41] so what was that that John seen
[1:10:47] in Christ in Revelations
[1:10:49] here's Christ saying he said you no man
[1:10:52] has seen the father and lived and so
[1:10:55] here's John in Revelations and and he
[1:10:57] said well in the candle section he said
[1:10:59] well I looked at the candlesticks
[1:11:02] see that that's you were with Christ in
[1:11:06] the church ages the prophet says it in
[1:11:08] this and we'll maybe get to this quote
[1:11:10] he said the church ages the church Ages
[1:11:12] were feeding on the Holy Ghost oil of
[1:11:17] Christ
[1:11:18] the word
[1:11:20] amen that's that's just amazing
[1:11:24] amen hallelujah
[1:11:27] Hallelujah just let me see here
[1:11:32] here if we look into this and I'm going
[1:11:34] to read some quotes for this Ephesians 5
[1:11:36] and 23 and for the husband is head of
[1:11:39] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[1:11:42] the church and is the
[1:11:45] savior
[1:11:47] of the body singular
[1:11:51] amen
[1:11:53] Hallelujah
[1:11:55] thank you Lord Jesus and here I
[1:11:57] mentioned before I'm just laying a
[1:11:59] foundation we're going to close with
[1:12:00] some quotes of man and Genesis there was
[1:12:03] a voice walking and and here in
[1:12:06] Revelations John had heard a voice
[1:12:09] in Genesis 3 8
[1:12:10] and they heard a voice of the Lord God
[1:12:12] walking in the garden
[1:12:15] and the cool of the day
[1:12:18] amen and here John in Revelations heard
[1:12:21] that same voice
[1:12:23] but the voice was a
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:31] beginning ten just
[1:12:35] beautiful and God makes no mistakes
[1:12:39] God makes no mistakes and there will be
[1:12:41] no excuses
[1:12:43] there'll be no excuses
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:47] amen let's just
[1:12:49] let's just say look at some things that
[1:12:50] the prophet said longness now what the
[1:12:53] holy spirit's trying to do is bring you
[1:12:55] up and to show you this is this is me
[1:13:00] it's not just that this is Christ
[1:13:03] but this is me
[1:13:06] I'm connected I'm not just connected at
[1:13:09] the hip I'm connected
[1:13:13] Amen in the mark of the beast
[1:13:15] he said we found the church standing
[1:13:16] here in its beauty and Christ just
[1:13:19] molded into it the church had the white
[1:13:22] garment on and you'll notice it was uh
[1:13:25] I wish I would have put these on the
[1:13:26] screen I apologize for this I these are
[1:13:29] free to see I'm not making this up and
[1:13:32] you'll notice it was a woman
[1:13:35] talking about Revelations around the
[1:13:38] breast
[1:13:38] it was a garment covered over her shame
[1:13:41] and it had the golden cords pulled
[1:13:43] around it
[1:13:44] and they'd held around their breasts
[1:13:47] that that's just amazing to me
[1:13:50] I've been in this message for a long
[1:13:51] time
[1:13:54] I would have said 100 that that was
[1:13:56] Jesus Christ before
[1:13:58] but that was his bride with them he says
[1:14:01] watch this the golden cord pulled around
[1:14:02] and that held around its breast white
[1:14:05] speaking of the righteousness of Christ
[1:14:08] and the golden cord represents the
[1:14:11] gospel
[1:14:13] the preaching of the Gospel brings the
[1:14:15] Holy Spirit over the church and the
[1:14:17] righteousness of Christ he's right here
[1:14:19] in the Pulpit anybody wants to see them
[1:14:21] arch of the Beast
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:24] don't that make you
[1:14:27] in harmony don't that make you at peace
[1:14:30] don't that give you confidence
[1:14:33] amen it doesn't mean I'm just thinking
[1:14:37] God how did you love brother Dale
[1:14:40] well see it wasn't because brother Dale
[1:14:42] see brother Dale went in that pawn shop
[1:14:45] in 1968 in January the 26th about the
[1:14:49] middle of the afternoon
[1:14:50] but see God loved me before that pawn
[1:14:54] shop
[1:14:54] because once I hit that pawn shop I had
[1:14:57] some faults
[1:14:59] I probably started telling lies right
[1:15:01] away
[1:15:02] I was about that big when I was born
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:07] you see what I mean
[1:15:10] so Christ's love wasn't conditional it
[1:15:13] wasn't conditional to the pawn shop he
[1:15:15] said that's always been mine
[1:15:23] he says your initials are on it but what
[1:15:25] should I didn't know what my name was so
[1:15:26] I just put I am
[1:15:31] oh buddy in demonology or sorry
[1:15:35] I do have one of those here
[1:15:38] but this is a different one and let me
[1:15:39] start here
[1:15:41] he said there you have the seven Church
[1:15:43] ages and now if you'll notice in
[1:15:45] Revelation 1 do we find Jesus standing
[1:15:47] in the middle of The Seven Ages and the
[1:15:50] golden candlesticks and when he's turned
[1:15:53] he saw one like
[1:15:55] the son of man standing closed and how
[1:15:59] was it
[1:16:02] see if you see how you can misquote the
[1:16:05] message
[1:16:06] if you stopped right there you say oh
[1:16:08] well brother Dale
[1:16:10] Prophet said that that was Jesus Christ
[1:16:13] let me show you that again he said now
[1:16:16] if you'll notice in Revelations 1 we
[1:16:17] find Jesus standing in the middle of the
[1:16:18] seven Church ages and the golden
[1:16:20] candlesticks oh everything you just
[1:16:22] preached is false
[1:16:24] let's not stop in the middle of the
[1:16:26] paragraph
[1:16:27] and when he turned he seen one like unto
[1:16:30] the son of man standing there clothes
[1:16:32] how was it it was the bride
[1:16:38] I say let's keep reading it was the
[1:16:41] bride standing in the middle of the
[1:16:43] candlesticks drawn out
[1:16:50] do you see how
[1:16:52] denominations don't believe in
[1:16:54] predestination do you realize that the
[1:16:56] dominations think that they have to hire
[1:16:59] an expensive evangelist that treats you
[1:17:01] right over hell
[1:17:03] and and believe me they can make it
[1:17:05] really hot I've been in those services
[1:17:06] and you've got to run to the Altar and
[1:17:08] then that's where God showed mercy on
[1:17:10] you
[1:17:16] what's up that's
[1:17:19] that's not my chicken enough
[1:17:23] what about the Prodigal Son
[1:17:25] oh wow
[1:17:27] do you realize
[1:17:29] that the denominator the church world
[1:17:32] don't claim you're his until they feel
[1:17:36] like you make a decision to serve God
[1:17:40] now that is as far off the scriptures is
[1:17:42] the East is from the west and it's
[1:17:44] farther than that
[1:17:52] and you know the truth
[1:17:56] and that and you know the truth and if
[1:17:58] you were in the spirit of it like a ball
[1:17:59] Diamond you'd be going
[1:18:10] and there'd be rattlesnakes biting out
[1:18:11] your feet
[1:18:12] and you say well I can't because I'm
[1:18:14] scared of the rattlesnakes and John's
[1:18:16] like
[1:18:18] that's what the Bible says
[1:18:20] do you think it was easy for John to
[1:18:23] write Revelations and God give him this
[1:18:25] Divine interpretation of the Holy
[1:18:28] scriptures which is one of the greatest
[1:18:30] books of the Bible
[1:18:33] in torture
[1:18:35] and who knows when he had his last meal
[1:18:47] and we
[1:18:52] God help me God help me to be more
[1:18:54] radical I want to be radical
[1:19:01] if you love something you'll be radical
[1:19:05] don't you dare touch my baby I don't let
[1:19:07] nobody hold it just me and my husband
[1:19:08] hold it
[1:19:10] because because you know he's only three
[1:19:13] days old
[1:19:15] and brother Dale's just sitting there
[1:19:17] crumbling I I want to touch that baby
[1:19:28] it's called being in love
[1:19:30] and in harmony
[1:19:32] and at peace Revelations one this is he
[1:19:35] swore by himself another quote I I'm I'm
[1:19:38] laying a strong Foundation here for you
[1:19:40] you should go out here on a spiritual
[1:19:42] High
[1:19:45] Revelation 1 Jesus was seen or the
[1:19:49] church no rather the bride of Christ
[1:19:53] see watch how the anointings come into
[1:19:56] the prophet you know Amos 3 8 the word
[1:19:59] of the god comes to the prophet man
[1:20:01] he'll reveal the secrets of the word and
[1:20:03] watch how he's
[1:20:05] getting the word
[1:20:07] it's like
[1:20:08] it's like oh
[1:20:12] I'm not making this up
[1:20:16] and the Revelations 1 was jesusing or
[1:20:18] it's got three dots or or comma the
[1:20:21] church or or no or rather no the bride
[1:20:23] of Christ
[1:20:25] it's seen him standing in the seven
[1:20:26] candlesticks
[1:20:28] and the feet had brass which were the
[1:20:30] brass of divine Judgment of the church
[1:20:32] upon the world the Divine judgment you
[1:20:35] know that we will judge the world
[1:20:37] amen and Glory
[1:20:40] and here's I mentioned about the serpent
[1:20:41] and here's the bride's servant speaking
[1:20:43] of it now watch he said it was lifted up
[1:20:45] on a pole and it represented a cross and
[1:20:48] the three things that was lifted up for
[1:20:49] for what purpose they would be forgiven
[1:20:52] of their sins and healed of their snake
[1:20:55] bites and is that right and he said no
[1:20:58] you look look and live
[1:21:01] look and live
[1:21:03] who refused to look died
[1:21:06] now he said you can't deal with sin in
[1:21:10] no way can you deal with sin in any way
[1:21:13] without dealing with Divine Healing
[1:21:16] it's as much yours you can believe you
[1:21:19] know the message Believers and I
[1:21:21] preached this before but you can believe
[1:21:23] you're saved Sanctified and filled with
[1:21:25] the Holy Ghost and been filled with Holy
[1:21:27] Ghost for years but but like but you
[1:21:29] know this shoulder's been bothering me
[1:21:30] for 10 years but you've had the Holy
[1:21:32] Ghost for 10 years

[1:21:43] are all the Redemptive promises
[1:21:48] uh buddy
[1:21:51] the permanent Vision here in 60.
[1:21:55] and the Seven Church ages here he said
[1:21:57] now you'll notice of work he said you'll
[1:21:59] notice that they're drawing from this
[1:22:01] main barrel of oil
[1:22:03] Christ
[1:22:05] light life dipped into Christ and you
[1:22:10] are dead and your life that's talking
[1:22:12] about your flesh your your life is
[1:22:14] hidden through Christ or or hidden in
[1:22:17] God through Christ
[1:22:20] man you see how the anointed one see
[1:22:22] when we preach the revelation of Jesus
[1:22:24] Christ
[1:22:25] so everybody
[1:22:29] that ain't got the holy everybody will
[1:22:32] struggle with the badger skin
[1:22:34] that's the problem
[1:22:36] and next Sunday if we go down the same
[1:22:38] stream if God permits it you'll show
[1:22:40] that you know the prophet said things
[1:22:41] like this he said Jesus was the body
[1:22:44] and Christ was the god in the body
[1:22:49] now Jesus Christ was no less than
[1:22:51] Jehovah God but don't get hung up on the
[1:22:53] badger skin
[1:22:54] because I'm no less than baptized with
[1:22:56] Holy Ghost I'm no lesson than Christ
[1:23:00] but don't get hung up on this Badger
[1:23:01] skin I'm going to eat corn in a few
[1:23:03] minutes

[1:23:07] amen Triune beings
[1:23:10] you know oh Hallelujah
[1:23:14] amen and watch this he said your life's
[1:23:18] hid and through Christ it's hitting God
[1:23:20] through Christ and sealed by the Holy
[1:23:23] Spirit
[1:23:23] so if you believe that you have the
[1:23:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:23:28] who are you
[1:23:30] you were in Revelations
[1:23:32] it almost looked like
[1:23:35] oh that's just amazing there's no way
[1:23:39] that ever no way at all ever that you
[1:23:42] could you you no way ever to get you
[1:23:45] away from there how can you do it nobody
[1:23:48] can tamper with you the end of your life
[1:23:52] is burning with the Holy Ghost see
[1:23:55] you're burning on the Holy Ghost oil
[1:23:57] that the seven Church candlesticks were
[1:23:59] tapped the Wicks all went into one
[1:24:02] barrel
[1:24:04] I am mad
[1:24:06] Hallelujah and they're burning given
[1:24:08] light and there's the other
[1:24:10] there's the other end of your life
[1:24:12] dipped into Christ and your dad hidden
[1:24:15] in Christ the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:24:17] blocking it off there that you can't the
[1:24:20] devil can't even touch you
[1:24:24] Hallelujah he can squeeze and make noise
[1:24:27] even death itself can't touch you oh
[1:24:30] death where's your sting and Grave
[1:24:33] where's your victory
[1:24:34] for through the Christ Jesus we have the
[1:24:38] Victory and I'm dropping down to the
[1:24:39] next paragraph he talks he's reading the
[1:24:41] candle six and he said my did you notice
[1:24:44] that the Stars the candlesticks the
[1:24:46] lamps what do you mean what does it mean
[1:24:49] this is beautiful
[1:24:51] he says he said what does it mean he
[1:24:53] says it's it's that's the dispensation
[1:24:56] that we're living in in this nighttime
[1:25:01] now he's bringing it up to
[1:25:04] today
[1:25:06] he said nighttime
[1:25:09] has it ever been darker in the world
[1:25:11] than today
[1:25:13] they're going to see complete and Sanity
[1:25:17] out in the world
[1:25:20] watch what he says and the in the
[1:25:22] dispensation that we're living in is in
[1:25:24] the night time the candlesticks the
[1:25:25] lights and the Stars what do the lights
[1:25:28] and the stars mean at night
[1:25:30] he shows a beautiful type and I think
[1:25:32] we'll close with this
[1:25:34] he says what do the stars do it reflects
[1:25:37] the light
[1:25:38] of the Sun
[1:25:40] until the sun
[1:25:43] or three times
[1:25:46] so you are reflecting
[1:25:49] and you are tapped into the oil
[1:25:52] and you're feeding on and reflecting
[1:25:56] it ain't brother Dale
[1:25:57] it it's God Almighty it's Christ the I
[1:26:02] am the anointed one
[1:26:04] I could
[1:26:07] hallelujah amen
[1:26:11] until the sun returns blessed be the
[1:26:13] name of the Lord and he says watch us
[1:26:15] I'm still reading the prophet he says
[1:26:18] and any true minister of God don't
[1:26:22] reflect some flashlight some Matchstick
[1:26:25] or some stock burning
[1:26:28] but he reflects the golden rays of
[1:26:31] Christ to the church that he's the same
[1:26:34] and he's alive Hallelujah that's that's
[1:26:38] exactly what our Prophet said amen and
[1:26:41] he's shining on me and he said if that's
[1:26:43] a light that we're reflecting the star
[1:26:45] reflects the light of the Sun so see
[1:26:48] we're reflecting the light of the Son of
[1:26:50] God doing the same things that he did
[1:26:54] giving the light he said what's the kind
[1:26:57] of light it's the Gospel Life
[1:27:00] of these things
[1:27:02] oh wow
[1:27:04] wow wow
[1:27:07] wow wow
[1:27:10] amen
[1:27:12] Christ is in you
[1:27:15] and he's your great hope
[1:27:18] it's amazing this is not religion this
[1:27:22] is not about a church this is not about
[1:27:25] a pastor this is not about the Pope this
[1:27:29] is not about
[1:27:31] any big shot
[1:27:34] unless you want to call the big shot
[1:27:35] Christ
[1:27:37] he's the one and only
[1:27:40] good job
[1:27:42] and that I don't say that disrespect I
[1:27:45] say that With Thrill in my heart don't
[1:27:47] worship me don't worship the prophet
[1:27:49] don't worship
[1:27:51] some other
[1:27:53] worse
[1:27:55] any true Minister would say there he is
[1:27:58] and there you are not just there he is
[1:28:01] there you are in him
[1:28:05] whoa

[1:30:04] it ain't no God at all
[1:30:08] it's a saying God
[1:30:10] right from the beginning of time before
[1:30:12] there was thought
[1:30:14] oh man

[1:30:20] exactly
[1:30:23] identical
[1:30:26] today

[1:30:30] thing that changed in that environment
[1:30:33] or picture
[1:30:35] and that is the picture of the badger
[1:30:37] skin
[1:30:39] that's a picture of your Earthly
[1:30:41] Tabernacle but the god inside that
[1:30:44] Earthly Tabernacle is exactly identical
[1:30:47] as the God that was at the woman at the
[1:30:50] well talk to the woman at the well was
[1:30:52] the god in our prophet
[1:30:54] and down through Moses and all these
[1:30:56] amazing things
[1:30:58] why cry to me

[1:31:03] studying this week I you know I I I'm
[1:31:06] gonna shut up we're gonna sing uh he's
[1:31:07] got it all in control
[1:31:09] man you know when I was studying this
[1:31:11] week I seen something else new I it's
[1:31:13] just the word of God is just amazing man
[1:31:17] you know I knew that Moses was God to
[1:31:20] pharaoh
[1:31:22] hello y'all with me Moses said I will
[1:31:25] make you God to pharaoh you did whatever
[1:31:27] you speak that's how God said it
[1:31:30] it didn't change
[1:31:32] I'm just letting you know he said
[1:31:34] whatever you speak
[1:31:35] Brother Joseph
[1:31:37] whatever you speak brother Tim whatever
[1:31:39] you speak that's I can show you the
[1:31:40] scripture so whatever you speak I will
[1:31:42] back up and confirm
[1:31:48] that was before the Holy Ghost was given
[1:31:50] by the way
[1:31:52] hey man
[1:31:54] you know when I was studying this week
[1:31:56] that Moses when he complained to God and
[1:31:59] God gave him a his who to give him Aaron
[1:32:03] thank you sorry I couldn't think of that
[1:32:07] I knew Moses was God to Joseph or to
[1:32:09] pharaoh
[1:32:11] but he was God
[1:32:13] do you know what the Bible says
[1:32:16] he was got there
[1:32:19] he said you are Aaron's God
[1:32:22] and you tell Aaron what to say and all
[1:32:24] I'm going to do is use his lips but
[1:32:26] you're the god that's going to tell them
[1:32:27] what to say
[1:32:29] and I looked at that that's just that's
[1:32:32] just right in this good old Bible
[1:32:41] did God trust Moses
[1:32:44] does God trust you
[1:32:46] let me just give you a hint of God
[1:32:48] trusts you
[1:32:49] did John see you in him
[1:32:53] in the island of Patmos
[1:32:56] should give you an idea whether God
[1:32:58] trusts you or not
[1:32:59] let's sing this song he's got it all
[1:33:01] he's got everything in control you know
[1:33:04] it'll when when we come to this you know
[1:33:06] my wife's helped me you know we have we
[1:33:10] all had different situations you know
[1:33:12] when you think of God in this standpoint
[1:33:14] you will actually pray less
[1:33:16] no
[1:33:20] selfishly
[1:33:22] you know I was here this week and I
[1:33:24] knelt down right here to pray
[1:33:26] I never did any talking when I get up I
[1:33:29] said the Lord's Prayer
[1:33:33] we get down and say oh God pay my bills
[1:33:35] it's in the rain don't send the rain dry
[1:33:37] the hay feed the cattle pay my plane
[1:33:40] ticket Bill oh by the way I have a
[1:33:42] testimony for that too you know do this
[1:33:44] do that do that do do do
[1:33:50] God's like
[1:33:52] you know somebody who was it said this
[1:33:54] to us somebody said this to us maybe I
[1:33:57] think it was Sister Myra said this she
[1:33:58] said you know when your adult kids come
[1:34:00] to my house you know and not every house
[1:34:02] is like this by the way not every house
[1:34:04] is like this but if you come to my house
[1:34:05] very often you'll know this is like this
[1:34:08] so when your adult kids come to my house
[1:34:09] they don't ask me oh Dale can I have a
[1:34:12] banana
[1:34:14] if there's a banana on the counter and
[1:34:15] you walk and get it
[1:34:18] hello
[1:34:19] can I have a glass of mouth
[1:34:23] can I have a bowl of ice cream
[1:34:27] that's like when we pray to God believe
[1:34:33] God's like
[1:34:36] I put it all on the table
[1:34:39] and you say please God can I eat
[1:34:44] it's like the little story of the girl
[1:34:45] that said she went over to the neighbors
[1:34:47] and she was eating a lot of food and the
[1:34:49] neighbor said they said well don't they
[1:34:51] feed you at home brother Matt and she
[1:34:53] said
[1:34:54] no
[1:34:59] no the eyes of the neighbor cut his face
[1:35:01] he said
[1:35:03] they don't feed you
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:09] you said they just give me the food
[1:35:22] obviously this little girl was a good
[1:35:24] actor
[1:35:26] but she had the attention of the
[1:35:27] neighbors for a while they were ready to
[1:35:28] call 9-1-1
[1:35:30] child's age
[1:35:31] well they just make me feed myself
[1:35:36] that's like we are with God
[1:35:40] that's how I am
[1:35:42] so I start to say something in our house
[1:35:43] alone says forget it
[1:35:45] it's already done
[1:35:47] forget it
[1:35:49] I say I hope oh forget it I'm sorry
[1:35:52] we gotta stop mocking God
[1:35:54] I hope Michael oh forget it forget it
[1:35:57] bring it bring it
[1:35:59] I hope
[1:36:03] your wives have a lot a lot of good
[1:36:05] stuff let me give you an example of the
[1:36:08] God today
[1:36:09] we're going to
[1:36:12] where are we going
[1:36:14] El Salvador with brother Jose brother
[1:36:17] Jose got he has a lady that he deals
[1:36:19] with to buy his ticket he calls me up he
[1:36:21] gives me the picture of the ticket and
[1:36:23] he says there's so much American but it
[1:36:24] works out to 1350 Canadian I went
[1:36:30] because trying to be careful because he
[1:36:32] wanted to go some other places
[1:36:35] that's the truth my heart's oh
[1:36:39] and you know when I was on the couch she

[1:37:36] probably almost identical is that
[1:37:39] unbelievable that's 50 almost exactly
[1:37:43] 848. and then the lady asked me she said

[1:38:45] Toronto the steward has come along they
[1:38:47] said you can put up there was seven
[1:38:48] seats in the middle of that plane by the
[1:38:50] way seven three on each side it was a
[1:38:53] big plane it was one of those double
[1:38:55] deckers they said you can put up all the
