Lord hallelujah I just love the Lord you know Hallelujah I just love the Lord you know uh the way that God is just moving is just amazing you know it's just amazing it's just last week I get I got this topic St Matthew St Matthew 16 praise the Lord hallelujah yall find it all right let's read and then you can be seated ver we're going to look at verse 13 first when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asks his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am you notice he was talking about the public who the who the public say that I the son of man H there's a difference between the public and the disciples hallelujah praise Lord you know that we are not of the multitude oh yeah we are not of the multitude you got to know where belong in the kingdom of God you must know your place different character characteristics the multitude carry a different Spirit and the disciples carry a different Spirit Hallelujah verse 14 and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist samas and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say you that I am now this he was directing this now to them not about the public now but about your own understanding Hallelujah you see understanding is important Hallelujah are you going to read it then you can be seated and he said unto verse 16 and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah praise God God what a respon and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah Hallelujah Simon means Wonder blessed are thou Wonder for Flesh and Blood had not reveal it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven so it takes a divine Revelation for you to understand who Jesus is for you to understand the title of Jesus the Earthly title because the Earthly title of Jesus is the son of man amen and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter so he changed his name from a werer to Peter W amen rich mean Stone which mean your firm amen and up on this rock hallelujah that is the Revelation look at it upon on this rock which is the revelation of Jesus Christ I will build not Peter not the other Apostles Hallelujah not Elijah not Moses but I will build Hallelujah my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys the keys represents Authority the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shal bind and hurt shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose un hurt shall be loose in heaven Hallelujah we ask the Lord to have his Blessing to his word you can be seated oh praise God hallelujah you know this conversation that Jesus had with the disciples it shows that it took place 25 miles north of the Sea of Galilee in the district of cesaria Philippi they have been walking with Jesus for three years Hallelujah Jesus did many miracles in it signs and wonders Hallelujah they heard about the law they heard the prophecy concerning the law of Moses they heard the prophecy concerning all the prophets speaking of this Messiah they heard about it did they believe it yes they believe it but you must go more than just believe I don't believe in the statement that people always rehearse that the prophet said if if you don't understand just believe I don't agree with that why I say I don't agree understanding is important the topic is revelation brings Authority but we must understand that there three steps of Revelation three steps of Revelation Hallelujah and the first steps the first step of Revelation is knowledge the duty of the minister is to bring the people to the knowledge of the Son of God knowledge is important but it works it works together with understanding and wisdom what is knowledge knowledge is facts or information information is important but if you don't understand the information what good is it to you you may believe the information but it's important to understand it and when you understand that information then you must apply it wisdom is application you must apply what you understand do you believe that oh praise God we're going to go into the Bible we heard we read about the story The Parables that Jesus spoke about about the the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven in the Book of Matthew 13 and when you go through that Hallelujah when he started to speak to the multitude there's a difference between multitude and disciples multitude they came to be entertained they came to be entertained but thank God that we are not of the multitude because when we come to the house of God we do not come to be entertained we come to gain wisdom we come to gain knowledge we come to gain understanding hallelujah praise God so the disciples are consider students that's what that's the meaning for disciples student or pupils which also means student Hallelujah and here Jesus he would speak to the multitude in Parables and Parables Hallelujah is an Heavenly story with a Earthly meaning Jesus would take things in the natural and relate it but it is but is a Heavenly story Hallelujah it it contains secret so in the parable there are secrets that has been hidden oh praise God it's been hidden but it is truth hallelujah it is truth but he kept the truth hidden from them that's why I speak to them in Parables then the disciples said Master how do you speak to us plainly and you speak to the multitude in Parable he said the mistress of the Kingdom of Heaven is not given to them to know but the mistress is given to you to know Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah thank God Hallelujah I am one of them Hallelujah we are we are we are not of the multitude we are important Hallelujah revelation brings a charity Hallelujah Revelation praise the Lord you know I'm going to do something on the chalkboard here I love to write one the first step is knowledge and we say that knowledge is information it also means Fox is it not right oh praise God and the second one is understanding you remember that the Daniel when the angel came to Daniel the angel revealed it came to give him understanding isn't that right what is understanding it means comprehension comprehend the ability to comprehend and when you comprehend you're not doing it with your natural mind but also in your spirit because the spirit is the Mind Hallelujah the spirit becomes the mind Hallelujah comprehend and the other step is wisdom wisdom is important all of these works together you have when you have knowledge you must understand the knowledge and when you understand it you must apply it because wisdom is the application you apply what you understand that's why even today praise the Lord so many persons today there's so much confusion because they have no understanding they hear the word preach they hear it over and over but they do not understand Jesus told them in the Book of Matthew 13 that has been fulfilled in the prophet Isaiah here they have and they he highs they have and they see but they do not understand so they can hear the word and not understand it oh praise God hallelujah so when you're when Jesus said up on this rock I will bu my church the church Hallelujah is a group of people that are called out by Christ Hallelujah he's the one that is constructing his church is building his church upon Revelation and this Revelation consists of knowledge you have the knowledge of the Son of God and understanding you are understand the Son of God and when you understand the Son of God you app you apply that to your life Hallelujah because I understand the Son of God and who he is I am the Son of God and I have the authority over every sickness over demons and over conditions over situations Upon This Life Hallelujah because I know who I am because you're built upon the Revelation and that Revelation gives you the authority hallelujah what is authority authority hallelujah praise God it means to rule it means to control in Jesus ministry he control the weather Hallelujah when the rain was falling he said peace be still he control the natural elements even the water when the waves Hallelujah he said be still Hallelujah glory to God so you when you are possess all of these you control the weather to we seen it with Elijah Elijah control the weather in the book of First Kings 17 the Bible said he said no rain will fall no rain are due will fall sir in these until I say so Elijah never said thus said the Lord he never used that he said according to my word hallelujah Hallelujah according to my word hallelujah because when you're built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you have the authority over conditions you have the authority Hallelujah you control conditions you control circumstances you must rule hallelujah hallelujah you are to rule we talk about Hallelujah when we get over there don't you know that you have to start ruling from here before you go over there to rule Hallelujah so these things these sicknesses these these are the things that we must rule over huah in this time in this season many times we're being afflicted with sicknesses we're being Afflicted with depressions and all of these things but we have the authority to control it we have the authority to rule over them Hallelujah because God has given us the authority oh my hallelujah praise God when you're built upon the Revelation Hallelujah of Jesus Christ you know what you know what is the meaning Hallelujah for the son of man the son of man is someone that is being led Divine by God Divine leading by God hallelujah where is the son of man today who is the son of man today the church become this son of man today because the church is going by the the direct leading of God oh praise God in the message in the message the Tyra the Ty tyan Church Age The Prophet said they received from him the revelation ation they The Messengers The Revelation on the word for each period this word brings the elect of God out of the world into full Union full Union can I endorsing that full Union I just want to Echo it full full Union not a part Union but a full Union I wonder why I say today that I am the wife of Christ because I am in full Union with the word it's United with the word hallelujah and Christ is the word full Union and the world that is talking about many persons they don't even realize that the world you can be in the church and still in the world you can be under the anointing of the message of the howah and still in the world but yet you believe yet you believe but yet you don't understand oh Jesus Mama Hallelujah here the world here is talking about systems religious systems politician systems Governor systems all of that is consider the word hallelujah he said the elect of God he has bring you out of the world into the full Union so you're no longer a part of the religious systems huah Hallelujah you know you're no longer a part of that you know what you divorce that and when you divorce something it means you're separated from them H it means you leave it and now you're being married Hallelujah to the to the undiluted word of God Hallelujah to the glorified word of Christ Hallelujah and that is Jesus Christ the word and he said upon this Revelation I will build my church you know what I'm going to give you the keys the keys represent Authority he said Peter you have the authority to loose Hallelujah you have the authority to lose and you have the authority to bound and whatever you're bound in hurt is bound in heaven and whatever you loose and hurt is loose in heaven you possess that authority Jesus said in the book of St Matthew 9 the son of man have power to forgive sins did he take that power away the church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ and whatever power that was in Christ it is in the church he didn't take away that power he said the son of man has power to forgive sins can I say this to you this morning you have power to forgive sins because you are the son of man turn your Bibles with me to the book of St John 20 Hallelujah St John 20 verse 22- 23 and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost look at verse 23 this is the favorite part who whoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained so when he said receive he the Holy Ghost oh my God that's the spirit of Christ because the son of man Hallelujah the son of the son of man has the spirit of Christ embody in a body so when he said receive ye the Holy Ghost that's the Christ embody in a body so they become this son of man Hallelujah and today we receive the spirit of Christ embod in a body that's why we are the son of man so the son of man is here hallelujah when Steven stood there in Acts 7:56 and he said and I saw on the right hand he said I saw Heavens he never he step never said that I saw heaven he said I saw Heavens I saw Heavens plural it means I saw the dimensions Hallelujah he saw he saw the dimensions them more than one dimensions that's why he said I saw heaven but in that Dimension where the son of man is he said I saw him on the right hand of God stepen go through more than one dimension Hallelujah because when Heaven open Hallelujah it opens more than one dimension that Steven could see into that Dimension and he said and I saw the son of man standing up on the right hand up on the right hand of God can I say this who did St see is Seal he see me because I am the son of man I am operating in the dimension of God I am standing on the right hand of God you know why because you're going by the direct leading the Divine leading of God hallelujah oh my remember Jesus told him Jesus told the disciple look up this you're going to see Angels descending and ascending upon the son of man Hallelujah don't you know that your angel is here don't you know that you have Angels here present this morning with us hallelujah Angels ascending and descending upon the son of man Jesus told them if they if I be lifted up from this Earth if the son of man be lifted up from this Earth I will draw all men unto him Hallelujah when we step into Christ Christ is being lifted up Hallelujah and he's joy in all men [Music] Hallelujah Hall praise God Revelation brings Authority Hallelujah you have the authority don't you know that you can even speak things into existence you are creators you have the ability to create you have the ability to speak things into existence Hallelujah don't you know that you're are greater than the prophets oh Lord you heard me you are greater than the prophets Jesus told them told the disciples many prophets they desire to see what they desire to see what you see Hallelujah he said they desire to hear what you hear Hallelujah you are greater than the prophets wow oh my God Solomon he asked God for two things in the book of 2 Chronicles 1 verse 10 he said God I need knowledge and I need wisdom did you know that he have understanding as well because you can't get knowledge without understanding Hallelujah so when you possess knowledge you have to have understanding you have to understand that knowledge and then you apply what you understand that's that's the thing today brother Dale many people hallelujah they don't have understanding of this message they don't understand the message they believe the message they believe it and they hear it they will listen to a message five different message per day some will listen 10 message per day but then don't understand it they don't understand it if you understand something you apply you apply to your life you must put on the application Hallelujah he said Jesus said we are the salt of this Earth he said we are the light of this Earth we are the kingdom of God he said in the days many person this desire to enter into the kingdom Man fight their way Hallelujah to enter into the kingdom but we are the kingdom of God upon on the earth Daniel he saw the vision of the kingdom of God upon the Earth he saw it Hallelujah in a vision Oh Glory to God and Jesus Christ was the kingdom but when he leave we become the kingdom of God hallelujah we become the kingdom Hallelujah that's why even today when you understand The Mercy Seat is still on the altar what what is that altar we are the alar because Christ is sitting upon the TR found in our heart Hallelujah and he reigning in our heart that's why we can control weather we can control conditions we can control our circumstances we can rule over demons let me tell you this the devil doesn't fear you when you learn about the resurrection the devil doesn't fear you when you learn about the Rapture the devil doesn't fear you when you learn about the son of man you know what the devil learn about you too you know what and he knows it Hallelujah the devil doesn't fear you you know when the dev the prophet said the devil is afraid of Revelation you must understand that he said the devil is afraid of Revelation what Revelation the knowledge the understanding and the wisdom when you begun to understand that you are the son of man that's when the devil start to tremble when you begin to understand Hallelujah that you are our invisible harming that's when the devil has a headache when they begin to understand that you are the light of the world that's when the devil has a headache when they begin to understand that you're sent to give life and give it more abundantly when you understand that you have the power to forgive sins you know brother Dale last week I was thinking and I said father I have the power to give life and I said I'm giving my boss lifeall I'm giving him life because of the goodness he has shown to me the prophet said people is going to get life by being good to the bright he never said that they will come to church he never said that he never said they're going to believe the message he never said that they have to come under the same umbrella as you are he never said they will they have to walk with you oh oh two can't walk together unless they agree he said by just being good to you if you're hungry and they give you something to eat if they're thirsty and they give you something to eat they're being good and God is going to reward them that's the God we serve amen hallelujah many people is going to get life but they they're not going to believe in the same thing that we believe they have never heard of the prophet they never heard about the true baptism they were never baptized in the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ but yet still they're going to get life Hallelujah that's the God we serve Hallelujah he said by being good to the bride they we get life in the Old Testament the Egyptians midwives hallelujah look what they did Sir look what they did they fear the Hebrew God that when Pharaoh gave them a command that every male child that born you must kill that child did they do it no the Bible said they fear the Hebrew God that they hid Hallelujah they did not do it and when Pharaoh find out and said what have you done didn't I give you a command they said these these woman are different they they they give birth so fast you know by time I must come the baby already born Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah you know that God anoint people to protect you God anoint people to protect you they they may not living in the same Camp as you live they may not walk with you they may not believe in the god that you believ in but they are anointed to protect you Hallelujah you may not know them you may not be friends with them but God send them to protect you Hallelujah praise God he said in the message the fourth seal he said now the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer well then now there is power of the revelation of the word power and the word is not the letter the word is not the letter Christ is the word we used to believe I used to believe that Matthew Mark Luke John go straight up to Revelation is the New Testament I used to believe that is the New Testament but then the Lord began to show me something that the New Testament is when you receive the spirit of Christ that's the New Testament in The Book of Leviticus 17:1 in the law it said the Life is In the Flesh of the blood the life is in the blood of the flesh Jesus said except you take up the Flesh of the son of man and drink of his blood you have no life in you in Luke 22 verse 20 he said my blood is my Testament is my new testament in the book of second Corinthians 3 from verse 6 to9 brother Paul said we are ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit of Christ so when you receive the spirit of Christ you are the New Testament hallelujah oh praise God because you possess his Spirit you're not of the letter he said if that letter was so grave was so Hallelujah if that letter was so marvelous Hal was So Glorious when Moses was carrying the letter what about the spirit what about the spirit it is even more glorious because you're carrying the Life of Christ you're representing Christ up on the earth so each time Hallelujah when you man when you're living the life of Christ you're ministering Christ you're ministering his life Hallelujah his characteristics six glory to God no wonder why Jesus said I will build my church up on the upon the revelation of Jesus Christ when the devil is afraid of the church that is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ The Devil Is Not Afraid of Faith he's not afraid of Faith you have many persas they have faith and the devil just left them he's afraid of Revelation when the prophet said faith is revelation we must understand what he meant by that faith is revelation you have different types of Faith different types of Faith different levels of Faith the devil afraid too when the devil keep pressing you pulling you and you keep backing me off you think the devil is just going to go away he going to keep coming what is that is expressing Faith with patience being persevere so you know what I must get back at you but each time when you stand upon the word for it is written you bounce him off Hallelujah and then he going to keep coming back and then when you said before it is written you punch him off again and the devil back off there going to keep coming back Hallelujah he did it to Jesus and if he did it to Jesus he has to do it to us to H but when you st up on the word hallelujah and know who you are and know what you possess Hallelujah thou shall not temp the Lord thy God only him alone thou shall serve Elijah vindicate that did you know that according to the book of Deuteronomy 11 from verse 16-1 17 Moses wrote in the law if you take heed to yourself if you disobey God and go after any other strange God God is going to bring a curse upon the earth and the curse verses there will be no rain no rain what took place in First Kings 17 heab the king of Israel the leader who was responsible to lead the people in the right direction Hallelujah he went after strange gods and when he went after strange Gods it pulled the curse of God upon Israel the bible say that for this shall come the CH the rth of God upon the children of Disobedience hallelujah oh praise God Disobedience will pull the rot of God that was what happened in First Kings 17 because of Disobedience it pulled the rth of God hallelujah Elijah said there will be no rain no rain until I say so but did you know that that was God when you are going by the the Divine leading of God you are God hallelujah that was God in the same scripture the same chapter God said in the Bible said in the third year God said to Elijah go show yourself to H for today today I will send rain he never said Elijah will send rain he said I will send rain today go show yourself to H hallelujah praise the Lord my God that's when Hallelujah Christ has always identify himself with the message of each AG he identify himself with Elijah he identify himself with Elisha Right Through the Ages each Messer that came he identify himself and today come back down in our H he has identified himself with us with us when you see the father you see me when you see me
