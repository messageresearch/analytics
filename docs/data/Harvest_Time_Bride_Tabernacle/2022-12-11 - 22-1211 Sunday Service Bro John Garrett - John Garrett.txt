know the we don't we don't watch TV I know but I know you all have heard of the the Red Green Show and uh I I found the Red Green show probably about 20 some years ago I don't even know if the guy is still alive anymore but he had a saying he says you know keep your stick on the all keep your stick on the ice we're all rooting for you and that's that's just kind of the way I feel about it you know we're we're solving this together and let's just uh put our nose to the grindstone and be about the Lord's business and and uh and work until he comes hey man if you got your Bible and like to turn with me to the Book of Matthew we're going to turn to Matthew 16. we're just going to take a short text this morning and just say Amen when you've got it and I'll know we can continue on very familiar scripture for all of us foreign Matthew in chapter 16 and we'll start at verse 13. when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some say Elias and others Jeremiahs are one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven amen let's just bow our heads one more time this morning Father God we humbly approach your throne once again this morning Lord knowing that you've already fulfilled your promise you said where two or three are gathered in your name that you would be in the midst thereof and Lord we know that you're here just simply by Your Word Lord we believe you and we take you at your word and we just pray that your spirit would have the freedom to walk up and down the aisles Lord that you would Minister to each Heart Lord that we would be able to uh hear and receive from you may you speak to our Our Lives Lord speak to our souls and may your word change as we pray from the pulpit to the very back the youngest to the oldest to whoever whoever this sermon might reach and go forth Lord may may it be a witness for you we pray and we ask these things in the name of our our lovely Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated this morning I just want to once again greet you and and and say thank you for the opportunity to be with you it's been it's been it's been too long it's been too long and um I I'm just I'm just happy and just thrilled to see you all still persevering and uh you know things change sometimes you know you get new faces you lose old faces and and uh but one thing's One Thing Remains and that's the word of God and our fellowship around the world and that it just won't ever change and so um I was so grateful to be able to to go and see brother Jim and sister Linda yesterday and and uh just say a little prayer for him and and uh you know I just believe that God God Is A Healer and um it's not just a a past a past thing that happens sometime long ago it's not just something that uh you know we just say well God is the god that he'll he is our healer and I believe that I believe uh that as long as uh you know as long as there is a sick person that God Is A Healer and I'll always pray for a healing I'll always pray for a miracle it doesn't matter if you pray for someone they pass away the very next day it doesn't matter one bit God steal a Healer and until that as long as that sister or loved one has life in their their body will pray for a miracle and pray for healing amen I I believe that I've seen it too many times in my life that God is healed I'd like to maybe just share a testimony with you before we get started um uh all my life I've had problems with my my hearing my ears and had multiple surgeries to try to fix things to make things better I'm actually quite deaf and I recently here a couple years ago one of my ears started started bleeding and it would it would drain in a it was just it was a horrible condition it smelled terrible it was just unsightly and um I went to the doctor to a specialist and they said well you've got a tumor and I went to another doctor and and they said well no it's it's it's this but uh it needs to come out but the problem is if we take it out uh it's attached to a nerve in in that we run a very high risk of paralyzing your face if we do this and the doctor just wouldn't do it I I kept asking and went on for for over a year that I asked to to have this surgery and they they just was it was just too risky well finally I I had gone to the gone back to the doctor for another checkup and and his uh assistant was in there and she was a little bit more easily convinced that maybe she was just younger or whatever but she said well okay yeah we'll go ahead and schedule this and um and so the next thing you know I'm I'm uh in the in the uh prep room there at the surgery place to have surgery and I've you know they've got me ready they've got the IV in I'm in a gown and everything and the doctor comes in you know if they do to do their their pre-checks to make sure you know we we all know what we're here for and so he's asking me the questions is you know what's what's your name what's your date of birth and why are we here I said well I'm here to have surgery on my ears okay great and he's like all right let's take a look in in your ear and he gets out his my wife wife was there with me and uh so he gets out his his little scope and he he looks at my ears yep and he looks in the other ear yep he's like all right so tell me again why we're here I said well I've got a I've got the Paul up in my ear that's bleeding we're going to take that out today you see I just thought he was just you know this is just part of the checks he says there's nothing there there's nothing there you see God's A Healer you can't convince me otherwise I thought I fought for over a year to have that surgery and and nervous as I was about it you know I believe okay you know God had God can heal through medicine God doesn't need doctors amen I'm not against him not one bit but God's A Healer you can't tell me God doesn't heal my wife matter of fact she had um for years she had a thing on her thyroid lumps and um so bad that you could actually begin to see the the lumps pressing out on her neck it was making her neck bulge we you know had gone to the doctor and they want to you know biopsy it remove it just totally take out the entire thing it was so bad that she couldn't hardly sing she'd always always be clearing her throat and difficulty swallowing and and in one service just you know after service worshiping the Lord and and it was healed just like that she she was she was she was praying for and she was praying for a mental Deliverance with which God gave her she went she she prayed she was thinking God she was delivered from the from the mental thing that she was fighting she goes to the to the bathroom afterwards and she comes out and she fills her neck she's like wait a minute and it was gone like that I couldn't see it it's not there anymore Our God Is A Healer and he goes above and beyond anything that we ask for anything that we could possibly want he wants to give us good things and to me I this is you know these are not just random things they're not just one-off events it's not just some you know this is our life God is God has given us the bread of healing God loves and cares for you for everything in your life he cares for you amen so I you know it to me it's just uh we're living in the in the end times and healing is the children's bread we're just so close now you know we we look back in our in so many times we want to place things in the past and say well that was then you know we and we become guilty of saying well that was in that was under that Ministry that was under that type of a Ministry but it's here today for you for us amen and I believe that I believe we're living in the last days I don't know if you keep up with the with the current events and things like that but you know I I think it's uh I don't I don't like reading the news I avoid it really but there are certain things that I keep my eyes out you know the the prophet told us you know watch Russia King of the North he told us that Israel is our timepiece and so there's certain things that I look for and and here recently just one of the things I I saw that's so interesting the red heifers I don't know if you've ever heard about this I'm sure you have but let me just uh encourage you and build your faith where we are in today and we're so close my friends to the Rapture the red heifers now the red heifers are are an integral part of reestablishing Jewish Worship in a Temple and so for for the Jews to come onto the temple and to build Even build the temple they have to be dedicated and Sanctified in a certain way and that way is is they have to take and they have to slaughter a red heifer burn the ashes and those ashes then mixed with water are then used to sanctify the the tools the implements all the things they've built the the candlesticks they've built the breastplate they've built all the stuff they've made all the clothes they're prepared to to begin worshiping but they could not begin until they had a red heifer now they now they have five red heifers five and these red heifers they've been looking for them for years because they can't be without they can't have a blemish they can't have a single white hair nothing can be wrong with them now they have five which is Grace not only that they they they finally have them in Israel they found these in in the United States and they're now they're there we're so close so close and then here recently something that's been uh and coming out into the news is the drying up of the river Euphrates wow my friends that I mean that's straight out of the out of Revelations the angel poured forth is vile and the Euphrates dries up to make way for the kings of the East to come in you know for the battle of Armageddon now I'm not saying the battle armageddon's tomorrow or something like that but we're slowly moving closer and closer to that end time and so as Christians as Believers I believe that it's important that we we focus our minds and we focus our eyes on the things of God and we don't let this outside world influence us and you know if we walk amongst the world we rub shoulders with the world but we are not of this world our home is a Heavenly Home amen and so we we just we need to focus on the things of of God and and be aware right be aware of what's going on around us and then and that's not to cause us fear or or to uh to put us in a position of anxiety but what it should do is is give us peace and a confidence that God's word is true you amen you know generation upon generation of people have looked at this word at this Bible and thought that it applied to them and it did in a way but this is the generation that will not pass away this is a generation that saw Israel putting forth this leaves the Fig Tree as it were that the prophecy this generation will not pass away now that was 1948 and you say well brother John we're we're so far along the way after that he said well what's the generation you know and if you go by by Sunday so eugenesis is 120 if you go by this date and the Bible it's 90 it's not it's 80. it doesn't matter because no man knows today or the hour and I'm not here to preach numbers to you but what I am here to say is that generation will not pass away we are going to see the rev the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in our day Jesus is coming now his presence is already here but we are looking for a rapture uh all my friends I believe it's time that we we focus on the things that really matter the things that are really important and it's not it's not work and it's not society and it's not culture it's a mess and we're not part of it anyway amen it doesn't matter to us what uh what you know you just kind of shake your head at things that that happen and you and you say Lord help them and you you know uh the way that our countries and our culture is going is just tea totally insane just like brother Branham said it would be and we see that uh it's it's just incredible in the last 20 years what we've seen happen is is it uh it any any real child of God you just shake your head and it makes you sick to your stomach so much of it amen well that's all free let me get back to my notes amen so they said they said to him who Jesus asked him who do men say that I the son of man am and he's and he's and they said some are say that you're you're John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiahs are one of the prophets and he said who do you say that I am he asks the question you know what he brought it to them and said what do you say that I am what am I to you because it doesn't matter what the other people say what matters is what you believe and what you see amen and so I guess if you could title this this morning I I would I would title it what seeth thou what do you see what are you looking at what's your what is your focus this morning because you can people can look at things and they can see something totally different it's all it's a it's it's amazing to me how people can can uh look at two two uh an event and have totally opposing diametrically opposed views of what is good and what is right and you know and that's just exactly what the scripture said it would be the men calling uh evil good and good evil you know that is the dichotomy that we have in our in our society and in our culture uh so it's not surprising but but for a bride of Jesus Christ for a Christian we should be able to look at things things going on in the world and be able to see it with the right mind I believe amen and so it's important to see you know people who would look at Jesus's Ministry and some of them would would say you know he the Jesus would perform a miracle and one person right here would look at it and say you're you're the Christ the son of the Living God and the person standing over here would say cast out Devils by the prince of devils they seen the same exact Miracle but the way that they looked at it was completely different and their reality was completely different one person can look at something and say that is an act of God a miracle praise the Lord bless God and another person can look at it and say well that's psychology that's mental telepathy that's anything but but the working of God and so it's different we perceive things differently um yeah let me let me relate a story to you there was a uh there was a football game in 1950 this is very interesting uh and by all accounts it was a really a really bad game The Players had broken noses broken legs and it was just it was just a real battle and um those fans were were fighting and they got into this great big Rumble in this uh all kinds of fisticuffs and and bad things and after after the event after the event these two uh men one from each school they were scientists and they met together and they they said why was this so bad why was it so bad why did people have you know this side blamed them this other side blames the other side why was it so bad and so they began to study it and one of the things they did was they they sat down and they had a video of the game and they showed the video of the game to uh students from each school and they just set them in a room one student they watched the game and they said we want you just to be a to pretend you're a referee as you watch this game and you know you just tell us what you think and so they did this with a number of students and at the end of it the the results was just unbelievable the the let me quote here it says they said it seems clear that the game was actually very many different games and that each version of the events that transpired was just as real to the person watching it as it was as other versions were to other people that's that sounds it's kind of a little bit wordy but let me let me kind of maybe break that down and make it real simple those people what what they discovered was they were not just seeing the game that they were watching they were seeing things that happened in the past that was their reality it wasn't that this particular foul even literally even happened but as they were watching it their minds were so consumed with the things of the past that they made that their reality in this game that no it didn't matter if it was a foul today or a foul 10 years ago there was a foul and that foul was Unforgiven and that people could not move past that and influenced their reality of what they were viewing and everybody was different everybody saw different things because they all had different views and different things in their past but it was real to them it wasn't it was real that was a reality they they fought for it they fought over it they busted each other up it was crazy in in the scientists ended up calling it they made this term they called it motivated perception which which means that you see what you want to see you see what you want to see in things whatever's in your heart you know the always get cautious because you know some people might say well brother John you're preaching psychology but it's it's not psychology in the way that we think of psychology we kind of think of psychology in in the light of how brother Branham was accused of of doing psychology in a prayer line and people said that when he when he uh uh when when the spirit when the Holy Spirit was Discerning thoughts intents of the heart or when he was healed it somehow was some sort of a mental trick or they called it psychology but that's that's not that's not what we're preaching here today what we're preaching is that people naturally in their minds can view things differently than one another because of their past experiences just bear with me just bear with me because I found this interesting because I often wonder why does why does somebody interpret something that that is done so completely different than the intent that was done behind it why is it that when you do something with the purest attempt the purest motive to help someone they can interpret it that you're cursing them that you have it out for them and all you're trying to do is help them and the pastor knows because in the pastor says Amen to this I know in his heart because he sit there try to help someone help someone and then they leave the church because he's attacking me it happens over and over and over and over and that and the unfortunate thing is is that person often that's the reality because of their past and the things that they've gone through they they cannot possibly understand unless by the grace of God that the pastor is truly trying to help them all they see is the attack and it is that's their reality and you say well brother John this is psychology but let's go to another scripture if you will you don't have to turn with it I'll read it for you as uh Genesis 13. people and and remember now I'm asking what what do you see what sea is that what do you look at and what do you see in Genesis 13 Abraham and lot you know the story Abraham said a lot let there be no Strife between you and me and between my hurdles and yours for we're kin is not the whole land before you let us separate uh if you go north I will go south and if you go south I'll go north and lot looked around him and he saw how well watered the whole plane of Jordan was and it was it was like before God this was before God had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and it was like the garden of the Lord the Garden of Eden like the land of Egypt it was a beautiful land in a desert remember you know that the Middle East there's desert and let me tell you I've been there it gets hot it gets it gets just unbelievably hot a hundred uh don't ask me to convert from us Americans or Fahrenheit and U-Haul here or Celsius but let me tell you it gets hot uh it gets so hot that uh you could cook us cook a steak on the on the ground it it just it's unbelievably hot and um so you can imagine that you remember they were wandering from a city in search of the land that God would show him and so his brother-in-law was going with them and they've traveled along the edges of of where the cities were and so they were in the desert most of the time and the desert's hot and lot looked out and he saw this plane and it was well watered plenty of room for us flocks beautiful country and so he chose himself it says for the whole plane of Jordan and he journeyed Eastward and they they departed from each other and Abraham ham remained in the Lana Canyon while lot settled in the cities of the plane pitching his tents towards Sodom now I just want to stop for just a moment there what did lot see he saw the cities and he saw the well-watered planes and he saw all this this Greenery outside of the desert he saw all of this and he said that's what I want but then it goes on and it says it gives us a little bit more information a little bit more insight Abraham remained in the land but then in the very next the very next scripture in verse 13 it says now the inhabitants of Sodom were very Wicked against God that that's the the difference between lot and Abraham lot saw something that his heart desire and when Abraham looked at it it doesn't say that Abraham saw the same things he saw the well-watered plane and he saw the grass and he saw the the beauty but he saw the sin of the place and he didn't want nothing to do with it a lot ended up pitching his tent towards Sodom and so is it two men looking at exactly the same same thing and they were both good Godly men remember a lot was righteous righteous Soul vexed by the sins of son but yet there was something in him that propelled and drove him to pitch his tit towards Sodom that every day he got a little bit closer until he found himself in the city amen and so uh you know and the beautiful thing of it is is after all of that you know uh God says to Abraham after he's departed said you know look North lookies look West look South and he said all of it's yours anyway and he said go and walk in he said go and walk in the land explore the breath of it walk to the north walk to the South look at all of it it's all yours every bit of it everything that lot had taken all the cities all the beautiful plain all of it is yours and lot did something very interesting there he says he built an altar of testimony an altar of worship to the Lord where he made it he drove a stake of remembrance down at a particular point in his life and said I will not forget this I will worship God for this and so many times I think we we fail to remember what God has done for us and it's good to go back and remember what God has done in our lives and that's why we say testimonies and we keep a remembrance and everything because many times we're we're easily discouraged many times we go through things and we say oh is the Lord even with us does the Lord love us and you have to go back and say no he does he does love this I remember when he did this we need to build altars of of worship and altars of remembrance and and you know we could spend a long time just talking about how Abraham built altars throughout his life uh it's it's just it's so incredible it's so deep and and uh you know the word is is is there and you know I encourage you and I know in the pastor tries to lead you through through the the scripture and to to look at the the good things of God and look at the promises and say yay Amen to everything that you don't have to to to accept being sick you don't have to accept living in a sinful condition you don't have to accept this setting sins in your life that you can overcome by the power of the word that you can overcome by the the holy spirit amen you can't get too too uh wrapped up around this world and the things of this world you know we we look at it like I was saying and and you know we're never going to change it we're not going to fix it you know it's just let me allow me to read you a quote uh brother Branham in the way of a true Prophet um if you're if you're a visitor or you're you're listening online and you've never heard of brother random We Believe brother random was a prophet sent in this last day um we we uh we believe that there's a restored word of Vindicated message that uh has made the Bible become alive uh in a new way to us amen and so uh if you have questions about that just ask our pastor and he'll be sure to point you in the right direction and answer anything you have the brother Branham he says this in 1963 in the in the message the way of a true Prophet let me just let me read a little bit here to get to the point he said you know he's talking about the United States he says our national debt is so great until we're paying on borrowed money off of taxes that we'll get 14 years from today he said what's what's going to happen when the system breaks Castro sure I'm against him he's a communist right I'm against him but he's done a good thing when he changed the currency and sent the gold back and he bought up the bonds and and he says we'll have to do that or there's one thing that'll be stuck in our face and that is at the Catholic Church owns the wealth of the world she's got the money she's got the goals to buy her bonds back we're in the same position today as that was back then the money currency doesn't matter if it's the United States or Canada or or any of it it's all paper money it's all fake money it's it's not even real it's not backed by anything except the promise of a government that'll turn us back on you the moment that they want to you can't trust them for nothing but they're the whole the whole system is a lie amen the whole system is a lie now listen to this and he says she he says he says you think these whiskey dealers and tobacco dealers and great people of the country won't sell out to keep from losing all their businesses and counterfeiting the currency don't you ever think that that the listen he says whiskey Peddlers and everything but do you think that that that corporations that make billions and billions of dollars on Pharmaceuticals and and drugs and chemicals and everything else we're gonna for one minute take a hit on their bottom line to do the right thing no they'll they'll they'll influence the governments they'll influence the Prime Minister and the parliaments and everything else to go and do exactly what brother Branham said that to get us into that system of being under bondage to the Catholic church we'll go right back to it mark my words and and I'm not a prophet but brother Brandon said it was thus saith the Lord amen so that's where where it's heading he says uh he goes on he says he says the Bible says that the wealth of the world found in the Catholic church he says I'm not a politician neither am I a smart man but I thank the Lord I know him he says you he says that's where it's going she's going right there you watch it you watch and see if that ain't right he says I I hope we'll all live to see it I don't think we'll have to live too long but he goes on and he says this is what I really wanted to get to he says how are we going to build a church how are we going to build a nation upon this now what are we going to do about it he said he kind of gets a little a little frustrated because he knows that this is you you know when you when you tell people the truth but they resist it they don't want to believe it amen because you know nobody wants to believe that they're that the people that they elect are going to do this we never want to believe that our system can collapse that that that the bad thing can happen here and so he just he he senses he senses that and he says you know he says maybe I I just I've said enough he says be this is what I want to get to here he says look what we want he says you see what you want that's what you get that's your desires you get what you want and it doesn't matter if it's if if it's a people voting in a system the heart of the people determines what the system is going to be in the heart of the the heart of the people desire because they're not converted because they're not born again because they don't serve God their their hearts desire a system that that'll that'll allow a beast system to take over and there's nothing that we can do about that there is absolutely we could stand on the preach on the on the street corners and preach we could hold up signs we could pick it we could we can get in a truck and we could go to Ottawa or wherever and we could we could Circle the capital and and it won't change a thing it may be a speed bump in the road to to that point but it will get to that point where where the the countries and the Nations all fall under that because that's been prophesied as Revelations it's been that way and and that's just the way it's going to go and he said well brother John will you just throw up our hands and not do anything no we have to be a lighthouse we have to be a light in the darkness that that this this truth this message stands for something and that there will be a people that will walk out of the the burning Cesspool that is these these countries and March into the kingdom of God and and we don't have to to hold our hands and ring them and say oh Lord help us or anything we have the power of the spoken word that that is there to to provide what we have need of I I say don't don't ever be afraid don't ever be afraid of what's coming or what you see around us you know we shake our heads but God has a preordained plan in place to to protect his people amen their brother random said before one atomic bomb would fall that the bride will be gone before before listen before there is calamities and catastrophes that would that would harm the bride of Christ they will be gone why worry why why get consumed about it why Feast on the news like some people do you know it's it's nothing but uh well but we'll just bring your soul and spirit down that's the whole point of it anyway you can't even you can't even read the news and find something that's not that's written without an agenda because there's there's an agenda to everything and that agenda is to cause Division and strife and confusion and and what's coming next and people have to come back to the news to see what's coming next and oh my goodness you know it's just it's ridiculous I I I just tell you stay away from it as much as you can concentrate upon the things of God read your Bible pray sweeten your life with prayer Watch what God will do in your life amen what what do you see when you look out there do you see the the well water planes of the world or do you look and you see the word of God being fulfilled do you see scripture coming to life in our in our lives where we see God is doing great things amongst his people it doesn't matter if there's five or ten or 20 here it doesn't matter because God has a people and there's there's a people that will overcome the the Bible talks and about a great falling away in the last days and and sometimes I think we're tempted to think that that great falling away is something in church nominal and you know it's interesting there's there's over 40 000 Christian denominations over forty thousand if you go and you look at how many Church buildings they are uh that that are available there's practically a a church for uh for every single person you know everybody can go to their own church you know it'd just be you and the pastor maybe or or maybe it's just you in the in press play and and and listen to a tape but there's there's a church for whatever you want you can go and find a church for you wanted Jesus that that's a baby Jesus in the manger that you know that there's a church for that you wanna you wanna Jesus that that'll love you and let you smoke cigarettes or go drinking or whatever there's a church that'll allow you to do that there's there's a church for whatever your heart desires whatever you want is going to be there to be fulfilled but there is a genuine truth a genuine church that God has preserved that's going to March this way up on out of here amen I believe that you know I just always go back to the the vision that brother Branham had of the of the bride and he know he saw the end time bride going through and he said you know the it was uh women dressed in a state of undress and he said they were they were March into heaven with boogly Wiggly music remember and rock and roll and he said they went and that's it ain't that the truth because if you ever listen to a modern day Christian Church you wouldn't know that you weren't in a rock concert anyhow and you go and and he said but then there was a bride that coming remember he got depressed about it in the vision he said you know oh Lord is this all I've done and this is what I can present to you and then there was then he said he heard the sound of another church tell me marching to the sound of Onward Christian Soldiers and there she was this marching lockstep everyone in order in in dressed the right way and doing the right so there is a church there is a bride there is a people that will overcome and I say Lord help us to be a part of it I believe it you know there I wish that there was something friends that that would drop down and just put it down and you know God would send down a heavenly messenger with the with a scroll or something you know and one day I just take the scroll and I'd open it up and say yes brother John you are invited you have made it you know but God's never going to do that even brother Branham the prophet he said you know I don't know but by faith I believe you know and so that's the way I approach it is I don't know but by faith I believe that you know there is something within the believer that pushes forward towards the prize towards the mic Mark of the high quality that will that will lay aside every weight and every sin that so doth easily beset and they're not going to look at the things of the world they're going to keep their eyes upon the vision upon what God has already promised he would do and we're going to walk into the vision amen I believe that don't you amen blessed be his name in the Book of Luke he Jesus asked his disciples another question he said uh some men came some men came to him and uh they uh they were Disciples of John the Baptist and he said that the men came they said John Baptist has sent us unto thee saying art thou he who should come or should we look for another talk about a brother Branham said you know his equal eyes got glazed over but that was the prophet that was the prophet of of the day until until Jesus began his ministry at a certain point there was no greater message believer than John the Baptist he did everything right he did before ordained to to to do his ministry and so much so that that Jesus said there wasn't a prophet ever liking that no one greater no one greater he said so they came to him they said they asked this question that John had sent them are you he or should we look for another and so Jesus didn't answer them but what he did is Isaiah stood off to the side and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and evil spirits and blind were given sight and he let his Works testify of who he was he said this is what I am doing this testifies of who I am and then Jesus finally answered him and said you know here's your answer go your way and tell John what things you have seen and heard how the blinds see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed to death here the dead are raised and to the poor the gospel was preached you see they saw they stood there for that time period it says in that same hour that they saw all of this in one hour they saw the dead race to life the blinded eyes open the deaf hearing evil spirits cast out now people can look and say that's telepathy that's psychology or you can look and say the kingdom of God is at hand he's he said he goes on and he says he said blessed is he who shall not be offended in me there's a lot of people let me bring in a little bit a little bit closer down to home this morning is that there are a lot of people who have become offended in me today there are a lot of people that have become offended at the message and at the messenger and I say that's that's because that is because their eyes are on the wrong thing and not just that they're looking and seeing something because they can look and they hear the testimony they see listen you know when brother Branham was here people were afraid of death to go before him in a prayer line because he might reveal the secrets of their heart afraid to death but once the man left you know now we can say things about him and then people got bold and courageous blessed is he who is not offended in me amen and when the messenger said John were departed he began to speak to the people concerning John he said what went you out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaking in the wind a man closed in soft rainment what wouldn't you have to see a prophet and I say unto you much more than a prophet much more than a prophet is what we had in our day much more than just just somebody who who took the Bible and had an idea and thought I think it means this or you know this person says that and he and brother Brandon somehow came up with this masterful you know manipulation and no no no no the message is true the word of God is true that came in our day has changed our Bible and made it a new book people throughout the ages have longed to know the things that we know and see the things that we say but people become offended in him and they become and believe me if you're if you become offended in brother Brandon you'll be offended in Jesus because brother branham's Ministry was the son of man Ministry a son of man revealing these son of man my I like I said I I wonder it's like how do how do people uh look at things and see the same things and hear the same testimony and and and yet view it so completely different and uh and I I have to go back and I think it's because I I really do I think it's because there's things in people's hearts that they've gone through and things that they've endured and things that they've seen that warp their reality and warp their perception of things you know for so for so long we built up this idea and you and let's you've heard it if you have don't raise your hand because we've all been there when somebody has said that well Christian wouldn't do that and they've seen you do something well if you were a Christian you wouldn't do that and people we've raised this idea somehow that if you are a message believer or if you're a brother and then you have to be completely perfect that you have to you cannot make a mistake that you know and that's and as much as I would love that to be the reality of things that I could walk through life and never make a mistake the fact of the matter is is John Garrett is a sinful man and John Garrett sins every day and I backslide every day but by the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ I will overcome and that's the that's the the truth for every Christian believer but people have something in their hearts that desires things around them that that desire the cities of Sodom and the things of the world and they sit in a message church and they chafe under what they would call legalism or restrictions and Bounds and they chafe at it and it's just like a noose around their neck a collar and a leash and so they they look and they they want to get get away from it so you think about it why why do people when they when they leave when they leave church the first things they start doing it is cutting their hair for for a woman and I'm not going to preach all the women but one of the first things that a woman will do when she leaves the word will go and cut her hair why is that well you can look at it and you can say uh well it's it's a it's a headship thing she's no longer headship of the church you know but but you know you could you could put a lot of type of connotations to it but you know the thing is his brother Brandon said this about Sin and I I really hope this sinks in that you understand it you get where I'm coming from is he said drinking smoking lying cheating all that stuff is not sin he said that's the attributes of sin see you do that because you don't believe if you believe the word of God you would believe in sanctification you would believe in Holiness and you would follow it and so you know the thing is is when a woman goes out and she cuts her hair it isn't that that she cut her hair is the sin that's not the sin the sin actually is what's expressing is coming out from what's in her heart is that she doesn't believe the sin is the unbelief she doesn't believe the word of God and so you know I I think really the the saddest part about it is is that in that sin they feel free there's a there's a freedom to them to go out and do something that that was bad or you couldn't do you know some of the hollers restricted and so they go out and they say I'm free to do whatever I want to do now you know and and so they're they're the the sin is the estrangement from God and let me tell you that is actually that is actually hell on Earth what that is Hell on Earth let me explain that is because brother Branham said that hell in Eternal damnation is separation from God that that is what it is and so when you fall out and you and you run away from the message you run away from God and you run away from what we've been taught and we know to be true whether you believe the message or not whether you if you believe the Bible and you run away from this you are separating willfully separating yourself from God and you are in a Hell on Earth amen but that's the age that we live in the people that we live in uh it's it's amazing you know uh brother Branham he said he said this um for everything that that people seem to have a thing about psychology brother bran talks about an awful lot he said uh uh he was he said I heard a commentary a commentator say not long ago that 85 percent of the North American people were mentally Disturbed think of it 85 percent of the people on the North American continent has something wrong mentally this was in 57 he said they're going at a Breakneck speed they're rushing going and they don't know where they're going it's a nervous age what is it he said then I give the solemn warning to the church stand still he said God always commands to stand still before he does anything and he said the churches not not the world this night goes to the churches he says the churches is in a neurotic stage church is proselytizing and pulling it fussing and stewing stand still stand still I I I thought you know that's incredible I I thought I wonder what it what it is today what what if I could go through and look it up and see what it is and so I kind of was wondering what that study was and I went out and I was trying to find it and I found a survey that said more than 23 percent of adults between age 18 and 44 have received mental health treatment in the past 12 months and that's an increase in the last year from 18.5 percent so basically that's one in four one in four people are going to now I'm not against I'm not against people going to the doctors if you need to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to help you deal with something I'm not saying don't go uh if if that's what your faith is and it'll help you then you know I believe the Lord can work through through doctors but it's incredible in Canada nearly 28 percent reported negative mental health another Canadian poll said that in any given year one in five people will personally experience a mental health problem or illness and by age 40 50 of the population will have had or will have a mental illness we're living in a neurotic age and you wonder all all of Hell being against the believer why we struggle sometimes and we wonder why is it so difficult and we wonder why how can somebody sit in the same Pew as us hear the same word and then go out from amongst us and it's because of these reasons there's mental illness in the church there's mental illness and I listen friends don't don't take it like I'm stigmatizing mental illness if you got problems you need to talk to somebody that psychology that's what the pastor does when he gives you counsel is is you don't have a psychologist degree to to talk to someone and say why why are you you go to the pastor and you say hey I'm I'm I'm struggling with this or I'm struggling with that and the pastor says well one of the first questions is why do you think you're struggling with that that's like that's what people think psychology is that's just that's just talking to people that's just that's just giving counsel and trying to get to the root of the problem you know and then I I love it you know because we we have this thing in the message it and I hope I'm not stepping on any toes this morning but um let's say they say people say well you just get the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will take care well and that's true there's a lot of Truth in just getting the Holy Ghost and Watching God change your life absolutely true but I can tell you as a as a young married man that I had the holy ghost that I still struggled now I still had problems in the and I had the Holy Ghost and I still was not a good husband and I still was not a good father and the Holy Ghost has come to teach us and lead us and guide us into all truth and bring into remembrance all that's been taught to us and then the pastor comes and then he preaches a sermon about how to be a better husband and be a better father and people want to say well that's psychology or that's you know that's just a self-help book or something like that but that's not what it is the Holy Ghost comes and teaches you how to be a better daddy how to be a better husband and how to how listen if you we learn by example or you don't learn at all you know and so some of us didn't grow up with the greatest examples of what a daddy look like some of us didn't grow up with the greatest examples of what a husband should do and how a husband should treat a wife and you get the you get the Holy Ghost and you're married but then your wife is still crying in the in the bedroom you know three hours a day or is under some sort of depression and you can go to her and you can and you can cast that out you know or or you can do it brother Brandon said and bring her flowers and you can change the atmosphere amen so it what is it it's it's acting according to understanding according to knowledge it's not psychology it is to sit there and say uh if you're if you're behaving a certain way what's causing that behavior you know it and now now granted you sometimes sometimes at friends it is a devil and he's cast out sometimes you do need a dose of the Holy Spirit and some five-fold Ministry in your life but there there are times when when you can look at things and you can say we'll take for a little child that falls into a to the bath in the bathtub and say they're a toddler and then they grow up in their 10 12 years old and they won't they won't get into a pool or or or go canoeing on a creek or something like that and they're afraid to death of you don't sit there and tell the child uh just get the Holy Ghost and you'll be able to get into the the canoe why are they afraid of the water and then so you start working with them and start teaching them it's not it's okay the water's safe you can be safe you don't have to be afraid of the water and that's that's like a natural thing but I'm talking I hope you catch it that we're talking spiritual here amen that's the natural but the spiritual is people come to church and and then they they're afraid of the pastor and they're suspicious because of the things that have gone on in their past and the bad pastors and the bad Ministry that they've been under and the things that they've seen where churches fall apart and and people speak evil and lies about each other and they come to a new church and then and then they can't accept help from the pastor because their heart they're so scared they're they're afraid they're traumatized from the things that happen in their past and so you can sit on the Pew and you can hear the pastor say good honest truthful life-changing word and you can sit there and say yay and amen and the person's sitting right behind you and the Pew next to you can sit there and say he's attacking me yeah that's what it is what do you see what's your reality and what's cloudy in your reality amen God God ordained pastors for a reason and he put them in our in our lives and I believe that and I think we ought to get right behind the man of God and we ought to pull and and if you come to a church you ought to trust the pastor until they've prove them that they can't be trusted you you let him prove you wrong but if you feel God's LED you to a place you stick with it until you're proven otherwise amen I think you know we talk well brother John psychology psychology but if you don't know you don't know you think about the one time your husband how we I'm just thinking you know how we get wounded by things how we get how we get hurt and how how that causes us to respond in the future and I bring it to to the family and the first time that a that a wife asks a husband you know does this dress make me look fat and you you know being young and naive and and in love you well she wants to hear the truth and so you well that does look a little snug that does uh that does not uh well anyway it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter how you say because I can tell you it's the wrong thing to say and your wife is traumatized from that time forward your wife will never your wife will never ask you that question again without wondering if you're going to tell her the truth she'll never put on a dress again and look in the mirror and and have confidence that her husband truly finds her attractive trauma and and he it doesn't matter how much you love it doesn't matter how much you try to change it there there are things that leave indelible marks on our lives that that it takes God to move past or for a hubby it takes a lot of work but that's that becomes a reality you know and so often you know I think one of the worst things that we can do as parents is equate uh equate food to um approval I I I I would never I would tell parents never tell your children this this is just Lord help me this is just pastoral preaching but you should never tell your children uh that make it where if they don't clean their plate at dinner time because we've all done it eat your food or else you know you better eat it we prepared it and so and so they eat their food they stuff their their face to the gills and they go home they go to bed and they got all that food on their stomach and then they start getting a little bit pudgy a little bit more pudgy a little bit more pudgy and the next thing you know that now they're they're worried about how they appear in their appearance and they're 10 year old girls 11 year old girls and now they're worried and what it is is we we start equating a mom and dad's approval to to eating our food and and that sort of thing you see what I'm saying so it'd be better just to go ahead and sit in a bit they're not hungry they're not hungry yeah the things that we do the behaviors that we learn have lifetime influence and impact in our life there's a I thought this was interesting there's there's two kinds of memory you see he says um uh there's there's our conscious experience which is logical and uh we think about it but there's another level of experience and and that experience is how something makes you feel and so you know you can you can experience something and you understand it you understand why it happened you understand how it happened but the way that it makes you feel can alter your your experience and not just a real simple way to illustrate that is I I don't know if this has ever happened to you but I've heard I've had people say God bless you and I know that they mean it and I've had people say God bless you and I know they mean God needs to bless me with the trials of job and and they they don't have any type of blessing in mind when they're saying God bless you uh Matt they they they they they're sitting there thinking that the the you know God's thoughts are are good towards us and their thoughts are not good their thoughts are are evil towards us but you could feel it you could feel those things you could feel with things and then we'll either avoid it or sometimes we'll want more of it but you know it's the the way things make us feel creates a a unconscious way where we we either avoid something or we want more of it and so you know I I wonder for for a lot you know what it was in him that that he so loved the things of the world that he started pitching his his tents and if you remember a lot they they had left the city and they were journeying throughout the the land and he was a city person he loved the city he loved the things of the world he loved the Comforts a lot probably didn't like pitching his tent ever every day in a new place he probably didn't like you know happened to to walk behind the cattle herds and and uh you know pick his way through the the manure you know he probably got tired of hearing his wife complain about you know the the Joneses next door in the same tent it has the same Joneses for for years and years and years you know and so there was something in him that that desire uh an experience that he had had before and so he he pitched his tent towards a place that would provide him what his heart desired and that's where where we we have to be be so cautious as and I believe that when the Holy Spirit comes and you're baptized with the holy spirit that he can heal change your nature on the inside but we have to be cautious because you know why do people struggle why do people have such a difficult time with with things in their life when they come to church and they say they've got the Holy Ghost so many times that Holy Ghost is is on the flesh it's on the spirit realm but it's not sunk down into the soul and so they're changing their life to match up because of well you know the Bible says it and they got all these good reasons of doing it but it's not a heart change right it's not something that's coming from the inside so then they struggle all the years with well I think I should be able to cut my hair I think I should be able to to wear my dresses a little bit shorter I think I should be able to to go out and have the occasional drink with the guys from work I think I should be able to do this and so they struggle with that for for for years and years and and sin because the Holy Ghost is on on the the flesh it's on the spirit but it's not coming to the soul and it takes a soul change to be changed listen because if we change ourselves if we change ourselves that's mental telepathy that's just doing psychology but when God comes and changes us that's when you were changed amen I think I think people a lot of times I I compare it like this people are people are like horses in that how many have ever been around horses anybody ever had the opportunity I love horses they're beautiful animals I think they're one of God's greatest Creations but horses are horses are crazy they're all crazy they just some of it hide it better than others but you're around a horse horses are are reactive animals they're reactive and and if you've ever been around you know no matter how much you love a horse no matter how long you've had a horse you cannot fully trust a horse because a horse will will jump and spook at nothing now you could you know you could be sitting there brushing your horse it's a calm day and you know you're giving your horse a bath with the hose and and talking to it and that horse will see a butterfly flap its wings and create a shadow and and kick you over the shed and that's a horse that's a reaction it's not thinking about it it's not thinking about oh that's just a butterfly it sees something and it reacts and people are a lot like that for the Holy Ghost and they they hear something and then they react to it instead of stopping and just thinking about it for a few minutes they just react to it and so the the you know the the thing about it when we talk and I'm trying to bring natural and spiritual and trying to bring all this together to paint this picture that that people do things unconsciously because of of their experiences and so we need to have Grace for people we need to have Grace for those who who walk away and leave us and we need to to never just you know say well they left so their serpent seed or you know and just put them out because that's that's not what God did the the scriptural model when somebody leaves as the shepherd goes after the one the shepherd leaves the 99 and goes after the one the shepherd bears with them that's the scriptural model it isn't that we just cast them away and we never we never think of them or or anything but that's the person we ought to pray for you know maybe send them a card every once I don't mean go I always hate because you sometimes you just feel like you have to clarify now I don't mean that that we just you know somebody leaves and they they start drinking and carousing that doesn't mean you go to the to to enjoy their parties with them no but you you you get them on your environment if you can you don't let them influence you you try to to be an influence to them but people are people react and it's because of those things that have happened in their past and you wonder sometimes like why you say something from a Pulpit or you you say something and the next thing you know a person just leaves the church and they're and they're out the door and they they never come back it's because of these things that they've experienced in their life and then they just react instead of thinking about it and and I go back and say the Holy Ghost has given us a sound mind it's not given us the spirit of fear and of anxiety you know if the pastor says something to us and and gives us teaching of the pulpit it probably if your first reaction is to run away you know it probably behooves us to actually stop and just kind of think of things about it for just a few minutes and sit there and take it take a listen and say you know Lord does this really apply to my life or not and if it doesn't okay well you know maybe that's not for you but if it if it applies to it it's something that God has given the the man of God to speak um there may be it it behooves us to take a listen to I was preaching here recently at a church and um boy I tell you I just I think I'm just gonna have to just put this away because we're not doing notes at all that's that's okay I was preaching at a church here recently and uh the uh uh a sister came up afterwards and she she said uh she said you know every every the things that you said was word for word the conversations that we were having it was like you were sitting in our living room listening to us talk that's not me and that's not John Garrett that's not the pastor that's that's the spirit of God the discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart the word coming and speaking directly to a person and they were dealing with things in their life and it with their husband and that that God would come and and speak directly to that person send someone from five six seven hours away to come and talk to them and deal with their situation they were they were good people they are good people and they and uh you know but just struggling just like any anybody else but you know they sat in a church they go to church every day and they hear the pastor they still have questions they still have things going on in their lives but getting God in his grace and mercy comes and sends somebody from so far away and and it's like I was sitting in their living room talking to them and or listening to them talk and you know the the husband he called me up uh not too long after and he said you know I'd like to talk to you and he's a he's a minister himself and um what I tell you I always get just a little uncomfortable when I and I don't go off of notes so you just bear with me um it's it's 11 it's 11 30. I don't even know what time I started am I okay I have no idea uh I'll try to try to wrap up here if I'm going along I apologize but I the the brother called me up and he and he said uh he said uh you know uh I I I know a minister he left the message and he he walked away and so I started I contacted him and you know I thought I would encourage him but then uh you know I walked away and now I have all these questions and uh and uh he's like you know I just want to talk to you about it and uh and uh I'm I'm believe it or not even though I I'm up here doing all this talking I'm not much of a talker I I have to force myself to talk and to be to be uh to be PL um not pleasant but be friendly and show myself friendly I I'm much more comfortable I take to heart that that saying you know it's like um uh that that people uh you can be a fool and keep your mouth shut you know but the minute you open your mouth and people will know you so I I just tend to keep my mouth shut people usually you know well brother John you know he's he's pretty Sage or something I don't know at least that's my hope but uh rather than open my mouth and remove all doubt that John doesn't know what he's doing um but he so he he called and he wanted to talk to me about this stuff and and normally I would just sit and listen and yeah yeah and you know maybe say a word here or two here but I kind of just took over the conversation because there there are some things that I just will not deal with I'm just not going to go there it's not edifying you know I felt bad because I you know it's like brother look you know um uh you know I know that you kind of you wanted to call and you wanted to tell me these things and you were kind of hoping that I had the answer I I said but I'm not I'm not really interested in hearing any of it it doesn't matter to me it doesn't matter to me one bit and and um you know I'm not trying to be uh unspiritual I'm not trying to be uh unfriendly or unbrotherly you know but if you want to call and talk about and debate idiosyncrasies within the message or you want to debate why brother Branham said this and here or there and and this and you know research I'm not interested in not one bit I don't care it doesn't matter to me none of it changes Malachi 456 none of changes Luke 17 not nothing is changed by any of this debate all that stuff is is to me is is Spirits working all it is is to me is people who have who have become offended in me that's all it is and there's no there's no profit in it there's no reason for it I remember you know why a long time ago a pastor he told me you know like he said you know you need to come and look at this stuff and you need to have an answer for it honestly no I don't I absolutely do not I don't care about it not one bit I made up my mind about this stuff a long time ago and it doesn't matter to me listen because if you take a reasoning and you start applying it to the message to to a man what are you going to do with that same reason you can't you take that same reasoning and you just work it backwards and apply it to the to the New Testament and if you apply logic and reasoning to the New Testament and you know enough about the Old Testament you would understand why the Jews didn't accept Jesus as Messiah you would understand why because they thought Jesus would come and be some sort of a military leader and throw off the Yoke of Oppression but Jesus said that's not the kingdom I'm coming to establish but you work the reason you can see it you will keep working logic and reason the next thing you know you're back in the Old Testament living under the law and and then you can even say well you don't even know is there really a god because if there is a God you know this this and this it's like it it doesn't end anywhere but destroying faith in what God has done and so you know I told her brother I was like listen you know uh I love you and I'll pray for you and everything but I don't want I don't want to hear about it I don't want to I don't want to know what people are saying I don't know what research you've dug up I don't want to know I it doesn't matter to me if this Cloud was this or that or or if blue monkeys flew off the moon I don't care it doesn't matter to me one bit because I believe what the prophet said I believe that they're the godhead I believe water baptism I believe I don't understand it all but I believe the seals you know it's just that is my reality because some of us are going to look at the word of God one way and we're going to see truth because of what's in our hearts and some people are going to look at what brother Branham said or look at this Bible and they're going to look at it with different views and have a different reality about it and to them it's going to be a history or it's going to be a man or it's going to be a liar this is a liar that's a liar that's a mistake or this is a misinterpretation but I'm telling you that there is a people that's going to look at what God has done in this day and look at it and say that is the truth and and that's what we're resting on amen there's some people that are going to overcome in this last day and I believe by the grace of God that we're going to be there together I believe that we're going to be the ones who overcome and so I encourage you this morning no matter where you are and you're walking in your life but that that that look friends we're at the end we're at the end we're so close now that to the end of the race don't lose heart now this this is the time to buckle down buckle down and do everything that it takes lay aside every week lay aside every sin that does beset and get it out of your lives become the the the the person the human being the man the woman the husband the father that God has designed you to be the the become what his holy ghost has has designed for you to be he had a plan a vision of you from the foundation of the world of who you would be and and that is who we need to become and it doesn't matter if we get you think about it that God took a picture of us when we were you know at our our physical best right but that's we're not going back to a time where we just looked our physical best when we're taking all that we've learned all of our experiences and who we are that's what we're going back to in that type of a body and I say Lord help me I I was telling my wife and I guess I'll just close with this I'm 44 years old and in my life I've experienced an awful lot now I I sometimes think about it and I I think you know if if I was to write a book about the things that I've experienced in my life most people would think is fiction and I I don't mean because like uh just the things that I've done the things that I've I've I've I've been through like it's just it's a lot most people would think that it was a lie and I I told my wife I turned 44 this year and I said I think I'm having a midlife crisis now most people they have a midlife crisis for a man they go out and they they buy a new truck or a sports car you know and they uh I said my my midlife crisis is I have got to be better than what I am now I've got to be a better husband I've got to be a better father if if I'm going to do anything for God I've got to get moving I've got to do more for him and that that's that's what is driving me every day is that the Holy Ghost will work through my life in such a way that my family sees Jesus Christ that my children see Jesus Christ that the people I work with see Jesus Christ and and that the life of God lives through me to such a degree that I'm a burning light for all to see amen and that should be all all our prayer all our hope all our desire that we would testify of his goodness of his glory and and let our reality be what his reality says let his Rea let it let it just you know take take this I know I've bounced all over the place and believe me I I think I used three pages of my notes but but take take the words that I say to you think about them and let God change your lives I pray amen let's bow our heads gracious father thank you Lord for the opportunity to come and to speak with your people and to commune with you Lord just I feel your presence so so near and Lord I pray for your people and pray for myself Lord help me help me Lord to see the reality to to look and and see what you've done and it never discounted but to hold hold firm to it Lord let it change my life from day to day let me become a better husband let me become a better father let

Prophet said when uh Pharaoh looked out the window he seen Mud Dog slaves but when Moses looked out the window seen the child of God predestinated children of God Amen you know I was also you know uh just it was it was so beautiful brother John you know I was thinking when he was preaching of the cloud that we have on the front of our pulpit you know when the cloud came down on the day of the prophet some people just seen jet fluid some people seen water moisture our prophet seen angels our prophets seen angels and the angel came to the angel and said turn it sideways and there's head chip and I was reading the quote this week I haven't set aside because I thought I actually might Minister on it and all the people around the prophet told him he said why don't you take this to the Press and the same angel that taught him to turn the picture sideways said take this to the Tabernacle it's not for them exact same angel he was planning on taking it to the paper and he said they won't see it see you can look at the exact same thing and they seemed jet through us they seen jet fluid or they've seen water moisture but the angel when they turned it sideways seen Christ seeing Christ Jesus amen Hallelujah amen when we can just look past the badger skin what do you see amen I I pray this morning I I know I did this morning and the Word was coming forth that we see Christ we see Christ in each other we don't have to see each other's shortcomings we can see Christ oh it's beautiful let's stand just and and sing a song dismissal amen thank you brother John it's just so so beautiful what what do you say that I am Hallelujah if you bring that up to our day and you just think of the concert the the the the discussions over the cloud to me it was nothing short of Christ himself coming down in our day manifesting a revealed word and all the Mysteries and the seals being opened amen making the Bible a brand new book to us the elect lady amen a love letter amen hallelujah it's
