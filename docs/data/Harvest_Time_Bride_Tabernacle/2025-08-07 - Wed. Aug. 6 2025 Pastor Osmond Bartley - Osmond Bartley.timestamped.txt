[3:04] Um,

[3:10] I was going to mention I was um the last
[3:13] couple days I was uh doing a little
[3:15] railing job for uh um some folks. I'
[3:18] I've done decent work for them different
[3:21] times over the years, you know, and and
[3:24] uh but this railing we're doing for
[3:26] them. Um his wife has um the like cancer
[3:31] in the bone and uh they don't know where
[3:34] it is or or
[3:36] either they can't find it or they won't
[3:38] find it, you know. Uh it's sad to sad to
[3:42] say, but that's just the reality of our
[3:44] Canadian healthc care, you know. But uh
[3:48] um you know and I just uh like I mean uh
[3:51] I just it was kind of heavy on my heart.
[3:54] You know I'm putting the they've they've
[3:55] lived in the house for like 20 years and
[3:57] the steps are only two steps high. It's
[3:59] like this this platform height but she
[4:02] needs a railing to get up and up and
[4:04] down now. And
[4:07] and her biggest concern was that they
[4:09] could either fit a stretcher or a casket
[4:11] out through it. So when she's
[4:13] done with it and it just
[4:17] it's like wow what a you know what a sad
[4:20] uh thing to see you know so just uh just
[4:23] keep her in your prayers. Uh um I'm not
[4:26] even sure what her name is, but his his
[4:28] name is her husband's name is Doug
[4:30] Lindsay, and you know, we've done uh
[4:32] known them for quite a few years, you
[4:34] know, but it just uh it just kind of was
[4:37] a sad thing to see, you know, and uh but
[4:41] uh yeah, it's just uh
[4:43] &gt;&gt; leave that uh leave that to him. Amen.
[4:46] So, amen. We'll just bow our hearts. And

[8:26] of me.
[8:28] When Satan comes, tempts me, and he
[8:31] brings up my past. I tell him it's
[8:35] forgiven, and it's buried at last. The
[8:39] blood shed on Calvary now speaks for me.

[10:49] Seems I can hear
[10:54] the angels sing
[10:58] with harms of gold
[11:02] and a thousand strings.
[11:07] Earth holds no charm
[11:11] when I hear their song.

[11:20] my home sweet home
[11:25] is at the light
[11:29] of all I see.

[12:37] control,
[12:40] the more that I can humble myself,

[27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. you you you
[27:36] know you just just stand in just turn
[27:38] with me to the book of Luke
[27:40] &gt;&gt; chapter uh 21
[27:43] and I just felt led in my heart that I
[27:46] just want to
[27:48] do a short little teaching here
[27:51] um you know and just just talk about
[27:54] season.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. season.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; According to the book of Ecclesiastic
[28:01] chapter 3, he says everything
[28:04] governed by season. God created seasons,
[28:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:07] &gt;&gt; You know, and so everything and so I
[28:08] just want to do a little teaching and
[28:10] amen,
[28:10] &gt;&gt; you know, um uh is this right?
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, the clock is lying to me.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[28:22] Amen. Um and so Luke chapter 21, let's
[28:27] read. Okay, let's read um
[28:32] from verse 8.
[28:45] All right. Luke chapter 1 21 verse 8.
[28:50] I I I I use I will use brother Luke's
[28:54] version,
[28:56] &gt;&gt; you know, to teach on this season
[28:58] &gt;&gt; and the standing season here.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; And he said and Jesus speaking, right?
[29:03] Because you remember
[29:04] &gt;&gt; right
[29:04] &gt;&gt; when um
[29:07] the disciples asked him actually three
[29:10] questions, but let me show you just a
[29:12] few of the end time. Verse eight. And he
[29:15] said, "Take heed that you be not
[29:17] deceived. For many shall come in my
[29:20] name, saying, I am Christ,
[29:23] and the time draw it near. Go ye not
[29:27] therefore after them."
[29:30] &gt;&gt; But when you shall hear of wars and
[29:32] commotions,
[29:33] be not terrified, for these things must
[29:36] first come to pass, but the end is not
[29:41] by and by. All right.
[29:44] Okay, good. And so then he said, "Then
[29:48] said he unto them, nations
[29:51] shall rise against nation, and kingdom
[29:53] against kingdom, and great earthquakes
[29:56] shall be in diverse places, and famines,
[29:59] and pestilence, and fearful sights, and
[30:03] uh great signs shall there be from
[30:05] heaven."
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 12 says,
[30:10] "But before all these things shall they
[30:12] lay hands on you and persecute you,
[30:17] delivering you up to the synagogues
[30:21] and into prisons, being brought before
[30:24] kings and rulers for my name's sake."
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Right? Verse 13, he now remember verse
[30:33] 12. He was directing that to the
[30:36] disciples. the
[30:37] &gt;&gt; apostles.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; And so we said in verse 13, "And it
[30:42] shall turn to you for a testimony."
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Not for you and I.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Now jump to verse 25.
[30:51] And there shall be signs in the sun and
[30:53] in the moon and in the stars and upon
[30:55] the earth distress of nations with
[30:59] perplexity, the sea and the waves
[31:02] roaring men's art failing them for fear
[31:06] and for looking after those things which
[31:08] are coming on the earth. For the powers
[31:11] of heaven shall be shaken. Very
[31:14] interesting. Verse 27 is very very
[31:16] important. Pay keen attention to it.
[31:18] Amen.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Then, and then shall they see,
[31:24] &gt;&gt; then shall they see the Son of Man
[31:27] coming in a cloud.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Right. With power and great glory.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Now he says, "And when these
[31:40] things begin to come to pass, which the
[31:43] wars and all these things
[31:45] &gt;&gt; in the midst of that, you're going to
[31:48] they they" that's very very important.
[31:50] We're going to see that uh begin to come
[31:52] to pass. He said, "Then look up.
[31:55] Look up. Lift up your heads for your
[32:00] &gt;&gt; redemption."
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Redemption joy now. He never say the
[32:03] redemption,
[32:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:04] &gt;&gt; You have the redemption and you have
[32:06] your redemption.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. So your the pronoun your
[32:10] redemption
[32:12] draw it nigh. All right. And he says
[32:15] behold the fig tree and the trees and
[32:18] the and the and all the trees when they
[32:21] now shoot forth that mean or I think
[32:24] Matthew says when they put forth their
[32:26] buds
[32:27] &gt;&gt; you see and know of your own selves
[32:31] that summer is now near at end. Yeah.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Right. You know, so Jesus said, you're
[32:41] already familiar with seasons,
[32:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:44] &gt;&gt; So when you see certain things coming
[32:46] forth
[32:47] &gt;&gt; from the plans, the next season is
[32:50] summer.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; The next season is summer. Know that
[32:55] summer is near. So if he says summer is
[32:58] near, that mean you actually in spring,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; right? Because after spring comes
[33:02] summer.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; So the understanding is do you really
[33:06] know the season?
[33:08] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; All right, you be seated for a few
[33:10] minutes and you know and just may the
[33:13] Lord just bless you heart. Glad to be
[33:15] with you saints. And
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you know, um it's a
[33:19] blessing to have Barbara with us this
[33:22] &gt;&gt; this this this time around,
[33:25] &gt;&gt; right? I think this is my third time
[33:26] here.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so she she's being with us and
[33:30] so I really really appreciate you're
[33:32] traveling with us and you know we travel
[33:34] all over the world together and that's
[33:36] that's a blessing from the Lord.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Glad to be you can't hear me clearly
[33:41] right?
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Okay good. Um glad to be with you all
[33:44] and you know see my brothers and sisters
[33:46] here and I really really appreciate you
[33:51] &gt;&gt; really really appreciate you all you
[33:52] know
[33:54] &gt;&gt; and I am one person I believe in
[33:58] purpose and predestination.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; I really believe in predestination. You
[34:04] know we talk about the prophet say this,
[34:07] the prophet said that and if the prophet
[34:09] don't say it, it's not right. And you
[34:12] know when you try to tell people that
[34:14] that very prophet tell you to go back to
[34:16] the scriptures.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't it right?
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; The very prophet tell now and I keep
[34:25] saying this to persons. You know you can
[34:27] read a thousand message books and you
[34:30] don't understand the Bible.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; The most important book given to us to
[34:34] understand is this Bible.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; All right. And so, you know, praise be
[34:40] to God.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Uh, a lot of us preach and and I want us
[34:45] to understand that not because I we are
[34:48] preachers, we're going to be in the
[34:49] rapture,
[34:50] &gt;&gt; right? No way.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have to get the same
[34:54] rapture in faith,
[34:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; So, there is no big preacher up here
[35:01] that's going to get a a bigger a bigger
[35:04] star in his crown than everybody else.
[35:06] And
[35:06] &gt;&gt; oh, you don't preach so you don't you're
[35:08] not going to get any. Every one of us
[35:11] have to have rapture in faith.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Every one of us.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; And you know when the prophet said we're
[35:18] not leaving anybody out, what I mean is
[35:21] that
[35:22] not because you may know more than
[35:24] everybody else that you're going to go
[35:26] off first.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; No, we're going to go together.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; And so something here I I want us to
[35:36] look at
[35:38] the the the full redemption,
[35:44] &gt;&gt; right? We are we are partially now
[35:47] redeemed,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; We're not fully redeemed,
[35:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[35:52] &gt;&gt; And so it is not a time to slumber or
[35:56] sleep.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; I I like that song. I feel the pull.
[36:02] Yeah, that's right. Right.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; What creates that feeling
[36:06] &gt;&gt; is what is happening around us.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man, what an I felt I felt
[36:12] an anointing comes right now.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Upon my personal.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; And the se you know when you talk about
[36:21] season and why many times we have f and
[36:26] we fight and separation and we argue. It
[36:31] can be a misunderstanding of season,
[36:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:35] &gt;&gt; It can be.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; What I mean that is that within within
[36:41] an age you have many seasons,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; many seasons in one age like the whole
[36:48] year,
[36:49] &gt;&gt; more than one season is in one year,
[36:52] &gt;&gt; you know. And so look at this for
[36:55] example and I and I'm just laying a
[36:57] foundation here is that when you
[36:59] understand God called Moses
[37:02] &gt;&gt; to lead the people out of Egypt into the
[37:05] promised land.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Yes he did.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Now the age start when they exit Egypt
[37:14] &gt;&gt; and supposed to finish when they enter
[37:16] the promise.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[37:18] &gt;&gt; God don't stop a middle. No,
[37:21] &gt;&gt; no,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; no. But what happened is that within an
[37:26] h there are more than one dispensations.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Under Moses dispensation,
[37:37] they cross the Red Sea.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Look at the method how they cross the
[37:43] Red Sea.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Look at what happened under Moses
[37:47] administration within the same age. Then
[37:50] God changed it from Moses to Joshua.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Right? He did.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Same age,
[37:57] &gt;&gt; same promise, same purpose, but the
[38:01] method is different.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; God doesn't change.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; He can he will change methods.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; But the purpose remain the same.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; So now on the Joshua there is a Jordan
[38:19] to cross.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; The method was different.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; But the purpose was the same.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; And so here we are and we are in an age
[38:31] &gt;&gt; in this age different dispensation.
[38:34] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And so we we know God sent a prophet and
[38:40] God took the prophet off the scene.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Now, a ministry has to carry the people
[38:47] to the rapture in faith.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Not to the rapture,
[38:52] &gt;&gt; but rapture in faith.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Now, where and when have you seen that
[38:58] the gifts and the manifestation
[39:00] of the power of God? Stop following the
[39:03] believers.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the sign shall follow the
[39:07] believers. Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; But we have gone so cold and formal and
[39:12] we become like a little theological
[39:15] school
[39:16] &gt;&gt; and we're trying to educate each other
[39:18] of quotes and you know we're so dead and
[39:21] no manifestation
[39:23] &gt;&gt; of the power of God among God's people
[39:27] and when you know when the uh people see
[39:30] the manifestation of the gifts
[39:32] &gt;&gt; you know they try to beat you down and
[39:35] say oh the prophet says focus on the
[39:37] word. But the very word the prophet said
[39:40] focus on is the same word that said the
[39:43] signs
[39:44] &gt;&gt; follow the believers.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; The signs follow the believers.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know that very same prophet would
[39:55] point us and says, "Okay, let me read
[39:57] it. I'm going to read it for you for us.
[39:59] All right.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; It is just teaching."
[40:02] &gt;&gt; And so we're understanding the season
[40:04] that we're in.
[40:07] We are
[40:09] entering
[40:11] into a new season,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; I I read that the other day at the tent.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet said for war to come, the
[40:21] people has to get in the spirit of war,
[40:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:24] &gt;&gt; For war.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; He did.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; He said for the for judgment to take the
[40:30] people into the anti-oluvian age,
[40:33] &gt;&gt; right? under Noah, the people got in
[40:37] that spirit, right?
[40:38] &gt;&gt; And brought judgment,
[40:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; So for us to have a translation,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; we have to get in the spirit.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now listen this. He said,
[40:54] "What will it be when we
[40:57] when we truly have full redemption?
[41:01] Won't it be wonderful?
[41:03] He said, "If I am promised the
[41:05] resurrection of this mortal pest house
[41:09] that I live in here, if I have been
[41:13] promised a redemption of a new body,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; we this is the whole press house."
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; So there's a promise
[41:23] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to have a new body.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; So shouldn't there be some anxiety
[41:29] and expectation in me that I want to
[41:32] have a new body?
[41:34] It's not time to sleep.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Okay, we we have that. Okay, let me go
[41:38] further. As long as you love the world
[41:41] or the things of the world and the love
[41:43] of God is not in you. But as long as you
[41:46] are above that, then you know that you
[41:49] have your inheritance.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[41:51] &gt;&gt; you are on your road to your full
[41:55] Hallelujah.
[41:56] You are full redemption.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Your full redemption.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; So, we are looking towards a full
[42:08] redemption.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, let me go further.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; So, when we look at this full
[42:21] redemption, what are we talking about
[42:24] within this dispensation?
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[42:29] Jesus said to his disciples,
[42:32] "In the hand you're going to hear of
[42:34] false anointed ones.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; For there to be falls, you have to be a
[42:39] genuine,
[42:40] &gt;&gt; right?" Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; So the false anointed ones will be
[42:43] rising. Now, why will they be rising?
[42:45] Because the season is right.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; The season is ready for them.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:56] And now he says in this season you're
[42:59] going to hear of war.
[43:02] You're going to hear of commotions and
[43:05] people's heart will be failing for fear.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:08] &gt;&gt; You're not just talking about
[43:11] emotional distress,
[43:14] &gt;&gt; physical distress,
[43:16] &gt;&gt; but it will also be spiritual distress.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; And this is truth. Spiritual distress
[43:25] &gt;&gt; is going to take place
[43:27] &gt;&gt; mentally. People are failing,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:30] &gt;&gt; People are confused,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And it now come down in their spiritual
[43:35] life. People are confused,
[43:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:40] &gt;&gt; People lose sight of focus. They uh they
[43:44] lose sight of promise.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; They lose sight of purpose. and they
[43:49] forget the the the full meaning of
[43:52] predestination.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; We were destined to be in this age.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; We were predestinated unto the adoption
[44:01] of children
[44:03] &gt;&gt; by Jesus Christ himself.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; If God says it, he means it.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. And if God, let me say
[44:13] this sense of God, God never send us on
[44:16] a path blindfolded.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; He give us the materials we need to go
[44:22] forward.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; And if God give us the material and sent
[44:27] us on a journey, why do we get lost?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Why are we confused? There are two
[44:31] things. We never understood what he says
[44:35] &gt;&gt; or we got distracted.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; It's either of two. It's either we never
[44:40] understood what Jesus Christ says,
[44:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Or we got distracted.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; So many things distracting us,
[44:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Or some of us just not listening to what
[44:49] God is saying.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; We're just not listening.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in the last days there's
[44:58] going to be war, rumors of war. And he
[45:01] says, "Oh, these things will come to
[45:04] pass, but the end is not yet."
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Look at the season now. He says greater
[45:10] quakes in different places and famine
[45:12] and pestilence and remember now in the
[45:17] famine can be spiritual.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; The war can be spiritual.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Just as we have physical war in the east
[45:28] every day
[45:29] &gt;&gt; civil war all over
[45:31] &gt;&gt; then you have a tariff war
[45:33] &gt;&gt; taking place. You have spiritual war
[45:36] also.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You have natural famine. You have
[45:39] spiritual famine.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; In all of this, Jesus says in the midst
[45:48] of this, you're going to have false
[45:50] anointed ones.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Rise up and says, I am Christ.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; He also said in Matthew 24, many will
[45:59] say, he's in the desert.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; He's in this place. He's in that place.
[46:04] Jesus said, don't you go after them. Why
[46:06] would he say that?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Why would he say that?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Because at that season, Christ will
[46:15] never be found in a geographical
[46:17] location.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Christ will be found in a person.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; In a person.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; It's a season where people looking for
[46:27] Christ, looking for someone to say
[46:30] something
[46:31] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is say don't go. Then you
[46:34] would ask him the question, "Oh, oh,
[46:36] then where will you be?" Jesus is
[46:38] saying, "I will not be found in a
[46:41] location. I will be found in a body."
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; I'll be found in a body.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; So, he says, "Now, look at this season.
[46:58] A time in men's heart, people's heart
[47:00] are melting for fear and chaos on the
[47:03] hurt. Every system now is under
[47:06] confusion. Governments, countries,
[47:09] everything is failing
[47:11] &gt;&gt; because they are confused.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And it's not that they refusing God.
[47:17] It's just a season.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; God spoke it. It is not that people
[47:24] running away from God,
[47:26] &gt;&gt; but it's just the season.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus said this season. Why? He
[47:31] predestinated the season at this time.
[47:34] Notice what he said again. He said, "And
[47:37] they shall see the son of man what?
[47:42] Coming in a cloud."
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Not on the cloud.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:50] So
[47:51] &gt;&gt; how you saying now no this is not the
[47:54] rapture
[47:54] &gt;&gt; right? No
[47:56] &gt;&gt; this is not the rapture
[47:58] &gt;&gt; but we are so
[48:01] we are so what do you call it now? We
[48:04] get so complacent
[48:05] &gt;&gt; right
[48:06] &gt;&gt; when we talk about the rapture today to
[48:08] each other
[48:13] &gt;&gt; we in a stage that we're driving people
[48:15] back into a slumbering condition.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. We talk about the rapture
[48:19] and when you talk about the rapture,
[48:21] they're just closed the eyes and looking
[48:23] to sail off in some place.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; The rapture is a revelation.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; The rapture is in us.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Has to come forth.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; The rapture is a package.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Saints of God is a package. Brothers and
[48:45] sisters,
[48:47] &gt;&gt; it's not you sitting at the door of a
[48:50] train uh uh in a train station with a
[48:53] ticket ready to hear your name call.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; We The Bible says the dead in Christ
[48:59] will rise first.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And we which are alive and remain shall
[49:04] be what? Caught up to meet him where? In
[49:07] the hair.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; The world will not see man. No cloud.
[49:11] But during this season, there will be a
[49:15] people that will be understanding the
[49:17] season because Jesus said, "Notice the
[49:20] fig tree. Look at the season. You know
[49:24] what season is next." So you are now
[49:26] vigilant. You are now aware of what
[49:29] season is coming. He said that
[49:31] generation will not pass because they'll
[49:35] be observing the season. Hallelujah.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He said that generation
[49:42] will see the son of man coming in a
[49:46] cloud.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; When you come in a cloud, he's coming
[49:49] clothed in a cloud.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; With what? Power and glory.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Not the world.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; The word she mean understand.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; For you to see that mean you're already
[50:05] aware. That's why you're looking for it.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. You're looking for it.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting in church and
[50:13] Wednesday night is just an ordinary
[50:15] night and you're looking for something.
[50:17] No, you are looking for a manifestation.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; You're looking for an appearance.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; You have coming and you have appearance.
[50:26] I cannot keep still in a season like
[50:28] this.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm yearning to see the dead
[50:31] raised.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I'm yearning to see the sick ill. I'm
[50:36] yearning to see the dumb talk.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; I'm yearning to hear some prophecies.
[50:42] Glory to God. Hallelujah. People stop
[50:46] speaking in tongues in church. Now being
[50:48] in a church and the word of God finished
[50:51] preach and a lady barber was there.
[50:54] Amen. And a lady stood at the back and
[50:56] she spoke in tongues and the whole
[50:58] church went frightened. What is Nothing
[51:01] is wrong. It's in the Bible.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; It's in the scriptures.
[51:06] Hallelujah. It's in the word and the
[51:08] interpretation came over. Why? Because
[51:12] God has to be again in his church.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Don't go over there. Don't go there.
[51:18] He's here.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Bringing the people back to
[51:22] rapture in faith.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that truth? Is that the word of
[51:35] God?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And so the word says when you see these
[51:38] things, look up.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Look up.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you It doesn't mean to lift
[51:43] up. Lift up lift up your head. He He
[51:45] said two things. He said look up. One,
[51:49] lift up your head.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; The word look up doesn't mean go outside
[51:53] and look in the cloud. See
[51:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:55] &gt;&gt; No. The the state the that phrase look
[51:58] up mean retain your hope.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If I said brother Dale, how is
[52:05] your being this year? You said brother
[52:07] Bartley is looking at that mean there is
[52:09] hope.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; So in spite of the heart's failing in
[52:15] during the war during the season
[52:17] &gt;&gt; he says you need to retain your hope.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Retain your hope.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Retain your faith.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lift up your heads is a
[52:31] statement they use. Change your mood.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Regain your confidence.
[52:40] Change your perspective.
[52:42] Shift your focus. Glory to God.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God Christ was saying to
[52:50] a generation that is seeing these things
[52:54] happening on the earth within that
[52:55] season. He says don't be caught up in
[52:58] what's happening. He said go retain your
[53:01] hope of a body change.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He said change
[53:08] your mood.
[53:09] Change your atmosphere.
[53:12] Glory to God. Why? Because you are
[53:15] looking towards your full redemption.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; The soul is already being redeemed.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Is that right?
[53:26] &gt;&gt; What you saw in Revelation chapter 5,
[53:30] glory to God, is our representation.
[53:34] When you saw the lamb came and took the
[53:36] book out of the right hand of him that
[53:38] sat on the throne. Remember said no man
[53:42] could. Hallelujah. No man could. Glory.
[53:45] Hallelujah.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; But the lamb came. And remember the lamb
[53:49] was just one attribute of the great God.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; There are many attributes in this God.
[53:55] Hallelujah. And the lamb came and took
[53:58] the book out of the hand of him that sat
[54:01] on the throne. What was that? That was
[54:03] the manifestation of redemption.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; If you notice Revelation 5 from verse uh
[54:09] 8 and 9, go down. The Bible says the
[54:12] four beasts and the 24 held us. They
[54:15] sung a new song.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; You are worthy to take the book.
[54:19] Hallelujah. Glory to God. And to Amen.
[54:22] release the seals thereof because you
[54:25] have redeemed us.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. By thy blood out of every kindred
[54:31] and tongue of nation. Our representation
[54:34] were there.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; We came up under the anointing of the
[54:38] flying eagle. So what you see here is
[54:41] already there.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already there.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Our worship is already there.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Because out of those four beasts came
[54:49] the worship of redemption. Glory to God.
[54:52] And remember, it's not the song and the
[54:54] literal book. Glory to God. Anybody can
[54:58] learn those songs. But it's a redemption
[55:01] anointing that comes upon you. Let you
[55:04] understand the power of your redemption.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You got a testimony about
[55:12] your redemption. So that's the
[55:14] redemption that took place on Calvary.
[55:17] Hallelujah.
[55:19] the general redemption of the world.
[55:23] Christ died and shed his blood. But
[55:25] Jesus said to his disciples, he said,
[55:28] "When you see these things, look up for
[55:31] your redemption."
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Your redemption. The prophet of God.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hear what he said. Can I
[55:38] read this to you?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Notice here. Oh, glory to God.
[55:43] The church has got to have rapturing
[55:45] faith before the church can have a
[55:48] rapture.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; We can't even have faith for divine
[55:52] healing.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Let alone rapture in faith.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[55:59] &gt;&gt; he said we got to have faith.
[56:02] We have to have faith that will change
[56:05] and quicken this body.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] So your redemption is to quicken this.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; So think about it. You we are we can we
[56:25] can't even have faith for divine
[56:28] healing.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Much more
[56:34] &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. He said we got to have
[56:36] faith that will change this.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Through those seven thunders will be
[56:43] revealed in the last days in order to
[56:45] get the bride together for what?
[56:48] Rapturing faith.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; To get together for rapturing faith. You
[56:53] got to pull yourself together.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Because when you observe the season,
[56:57] &gt;&gt; it's not a season for picnic.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; It's not a season to play church.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; It's a season to look and understand
[57:04] that hey, this need to change.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; This need to change. remember. Oh, glory
[57:10] to God. He said, and you know the
[57:12] prophet, he preached this in the first
[57:13] seal in 1963.
[57:15] He said, "What we have now 1963 would
[57:19] not be able to have rapture in faith.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; We got to go further."
[57:24] &gt;&gt; We have to go further.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; When the prophet says, "You are an Adam
[57:31] before he fell."
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He said, "We're going
[57:35] to experience the same power and
[57:37] anointing that Adam had before he fell."
[57:40] &gt;&gt; So, we got to go beyond just a church.
[57:43] This is more than that. We got to go
[57:45] back into the mind of God.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Far beyond the books. Oh, glory.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Adam never had this.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; He don't never had this.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Helen never had this. But how did they
[58:00] reach that faith? They came in a
[58:02] personal communication with God.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Enoch walked with God. He had a personal
[58:09] connection with God.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hey,
[58:14] these are the days if you don't read it,
[58:16] a person don't believe it.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; If you don't read it, they don't believe
[58:20] it. Why? They become a paper religion.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; They missed the season. Within the same
[58:29] age, brother John was on the high of
[58:31] Patmas. Are we there with this?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And then God said, "John, Amen, write."
[58:36] Did he say that in the for the church
[58:38] ages? He said, "Write these things and
[58:41] send it to the seven messengers, the
[58:43] seven ages." So that was a season of
[58:46] paper, right?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 4. God said, "Come up
[58:51] hither and I'm going to show you
[58:53] things." Oh, this in the same haze the
[58:56] season changed. It was no more writing
[59:00] but pay attention.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; So don't write. I want you to look. Oh
[59:04] glory to God. Then the season change in
[59:06] Revelation chapter 10. Oh when he when
[59:10] Christ descend in the cloud. Revelation
[59:13] 10:1. That's where you see him. Do you
[59:15] understand him? He descend in the cloud.
[59:18] Glory to God. And when he opened his
[59:20] mouth and roar like a lion, she sever
[59:22] thunders uttered their voices. John was
[59:25] about to write. What the voice said,
[59:26] "Don't write, John. You're not going
[59:28] back to that season. The season of
[59:30] writing is over." He said, "John, don't
[59:33] write." Hallelujah. Thank God. It was
[59:36] the same time the seventh messenger was
[59:38] there. He revealed who that one came
[59:40] down on the cloud was. Behold your
[59:43] bridegroom. Go and meet him. It's time
[59:47] for an invisible union.
[59:49] Two cannot walk unless they agree.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; You have to be united with Christ.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; The book says, "He that is joined to the
[59:55] Lord is one spirit."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Which is another attribute of God in the
[1:00:00] cell God being revealed.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; The Christ on earth is the church
[1:00:07] supposed to be the church.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; What did he said to John? Look at the
[1:00:15] last season of John's vision.
[1:00:18] He said John go and take the book. The
[1:00:22] word go mean leave your present position
[1:00:26] move. Take the book. Is that right? Take
[1:00:28] a hold of it. He never said right. He
[1:00:31] never said look. He said now to heat.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Consume the book. Consume it.
[1:00:37] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Because you
[1:00:40] are going to prophesy again.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; You cannot prophesy unless you eat.
[1:00:45] Remember, you become what you eat. Is
[1:00:47] that right?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; You become what you eat. So the more you
[1:00:50] eat the word, oh, the more you eat that
[1:00:53] word, you're becoming that word.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And when you, you know what? When you're
[1:00:57] becoming that word, who are you? You're
[1:00:59] Christ. Jesus said, I am the word. I am
[1:01:03] the life. I am the light. What did he
[1:01:05] says? In the beginning was that word.
[1:01:08] And that same word became flesh. That
[1:01:10] same word again has been resurrected in
[1:01:13] a body called the bride, the church, the
[1:01:15] wife of Christ, whatever you put it. She
[1:01:18] has to manifest the resurrection.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; She has to stand upon this earth and
[1:01:24] speak it, prophesy it and said, "I am
[1:01:28] the resurrection for there to be a
[1:01:30] resurrection."
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Look at Ezekiel in the valley of dry
[1:01:36] bones.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:38] God, the almighty God says, "Son of man,
[1:01:42] can these bones live?"
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; God could have just easily do his own
[1:01:46] thing.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; But he put the man, the son of man, this
[1:01:49] is your duty.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Son of man, can these bones live? What
[1:01:53] did Ezekiel says? Ezekiel was a prophet,
[1:01:55] but God called him son of man.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; He was a representation of God.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; On earth. Oh, God. He's all right.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Came these Muslim.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Don't knowish." God
[1:02:09] said, "Okay, you prophesy.
[1:02:11] You You do the speaking.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Prophecy. You speak for this
[1:02:16] resurrection to take place." Glory to
[1:02:18] God. Son of man, prophesy again. That's
[1:02:22] why he said, "John, eat the book because
[1:02:24] you're going to prophesy again."
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The dead saints has to rise first.
[1:02:30] And for them to rise, it's going to take
[1:02:33] a living being representing God upon
[1:02:38] earth. Elijah was alive when the baby
[1:02:41] was risen. Elisha was alive when the
[1:02:44] baby was risen. Is that right?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus came and demonstrated that he
[1:02:50] raised the dead in his season. Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Oh, glory to God.
[1:02:58] Evening. Let us put it right now in the
[1:03:00] in the ministry of the prophet. He was
[1:03:03] alive and we see many dead raised. Is
[1:03:05] that right?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Then how in this age we think we are
[1:03:09] ready to go home? We got to bring those
[1:03:12] dead saints right here before we go.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; It's going to take the agapa love though
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; because a gap of love is a love without
[1:03:25] condition.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:28] If I love you because
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; it's a love of condition.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And anything that I've condition I have
[1:03:34] expectation.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't meet the expect if
[1:03:37] you don't meet my condition, what I
[1:03:39] expect,
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It can bring division.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I will not be satisfied.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; A gap of love is beyond that. It's the
[1:03:49] love of God.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; That's the love of God that's going to
[1:03:54] bring the resurrection.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:57] And I tell the saints, it says, "If it
[1:03:59] was up to me, my mom gone on to be with
[1:04:01] the Lord, my father gone on to be with
[1:04:03] the Lord, my mother-in-law gone on to be
[1:04:05] with the Lord, if it was in my power, I
[1:04:07] love my mother so much for the
[1:04:09] resurrection, I bring her up first."
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz you will bring up who you know,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; But at that time, God don't need you to
[1:04:18] know,
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He doesn't need your
[1:04:23] knowledge. It doesn't need who you love
[1:04:25] first.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to take the presence of
[1:04:28] almighty God.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] It's going to take God to bring up the
[1:04:35] dead, those that are sleeping in Christ
[1:04:37] Jesus.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; That those that are sleeping in Christ
[1:04:41] will come first. That's why Apostle Paul
[1:04:43] said, "Behold, I show you a mystery.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
[1:04:50] be changed."
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; We shall all be now that change comes
[1:04:57] through the rapture in faith.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; So we talk about the rapture. Let us not
[1:05:02] talk about the rapture. It's not an
[1:05:03] event. It's a revelation.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; It's a ministry that will be coming out.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Coming out of the life of
[1:05:11] people that see and understand.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The son of man came. Notice
[1:05:17] the first time you see the rainbow in
[1:05:20] Revelation is Revelation chapter 4. John
[1:05:23] said, "I saw one sitting on the throne."
[1:05:26] One, not 2, 3, 4, 5. One, and around the
[1:05:30] throne was a rainbow. The rainbow is a
[1:05:34] sign of life,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; a covenant of life,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; between God and earth. Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That is why as long as we
[1:05:45] are here, the covenant of life remains.
[1:05:50] For God so love the world.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; He loved the world that he gave his only
[1:05:55] begotten son. Glory to God. But the next
[1:05:58] time John saw the rainbow was when this
[1:06:01] son of man that Jesus told them, they
[1:06:03] shall see the son of man coming in a
[1:06:06] cloud. Revelation 14 says, "You saw the
[1:06:10] son of man coming on a cloud, but this
[1:06:13] time in a cloud, clothed in a cloud, and
[1:06:17] the rainbow was around his head."
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; He came personally. That was the
[1:06:22] appearance of Christ to bring to you the
[1:06:25] understanding. It is now a relationship
[1:06:29] between you and Christ. And they too has
[1:06:33] now become one. You are now one with
[1:06:37] Christ. All the attributes that was in
[1:06:40] Christ is now into you and I. For what
[1:06:43] purpose? When Jesus said, "I am the
[1:06:45] bread," he man, he proved it. He Oh,
[1:06:48] glory. When he said he was the light of
[1:06:51] the world, he proved it.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; When he he said, "I am the way," he
[1:07:00] manifested it.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the truth," he manifested
[1:07:04] it. Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I am the resurrection. He
[1:07:09] manifested it.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; What about us? Whatever we say, we got
[1:07:14] to manifest.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Whatever we preach, we got to manifest
[1:07:19] that.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Whatever we stand and
[1:07:25] we preach and we testify, we will have
[1:07:28] to manifest it.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] I am the way.
[1:07:34] That's why I said people,
[1:07:37] where is the light of the world? It's
[1:07:40] not up there.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; No. Where is the light of the world?
[1:07:47] Jesus said the book of the book of John
[1:07:49] said he was the light of the world and
[1:07:51] the life was a light of men.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself before he left. When you
[1:07:56] read when you when you read St. Matthew
[1:08:00] chapter 5.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Pay attention to the pronouns in there.
[1:08:07] Some statement Jesus generalized.
[1:08:10] When Jesus said, "Blessed are they,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; right? Blessed are they." General,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "Blessed are the poor."
[1:08:19] That's general.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Anybody? But when Jesus says, "You are
[1:08:24] the light of the world."
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; He was being direct.
[1:08:28] You are the light of the world.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Then he says you are the salt of the
[1:08:32] earth. He never say anybody is. He say
[1:08:34] you are the salt of the earth.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So where is the light of
[1:08:38] the world? He's here.
[1:08:41] Glory to God. You are the light of the
[1:08:44] world.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; So you can't go outside looking up and
[1:08:46] say, "Oh Jesus, you're the light." You
[1:08:48] are the light of the world.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; He transferred that light to you. Your
[1:08:52] responsibility is to shine before all
[1:08:55] men
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; that they will see your good works.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Now we begin to glorify the father which
[1:09:01] is in heaven because the eternal father
[1:09:03] is a spirit. But you are his
[1:09:05] representation here. You are who God
[1:09:08] says that the world is looking at to
[1:09:11] manifest what the word says.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What the word says.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So what season we're in?
[1:09:21] We're in a season that Jesus says when
[1:09:25] you see that fig tree put forth its
[1:09:27] birth
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; and all trees
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Israel
[1:09:33] springing all trees the other nations
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; begin to rise he says notice summer is
[1:09:40] near
[1:09:42] why people misunderstand
[1:09:45] our action our behavior when you read
[1:09:48] the book of Amos chapter 8 from verse 11
[1:09:52] when God talk about uh this famine is
[1:09:55] going to be in the land and all of that.
[1:09:57] You remember when he talk in Joel that
[1:09:59] there's going to be a time of
[1:10:01] restoration.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; He says in the first month God said I'm
[1:10:04] sending the rain. The first month God
[1:10:08] gave Israel
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; when they were coming out of Egypt the
[1:10:11] month of Abib as the first month which
[1:10:13] is not January
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; but it's in spring. Is that right?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; April. Thank you very much. April, which
[1:10:20] is spring to them. Now, if God says what
[1:10:24] was expected, he says the floor is going
[1:10:26] to be full. The vat's going to overflow
[1:10:28] him. God says it's a season of
[1:10:30] restoration. What did what did he say?
[1:10:33] Eat in plenty
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. That's spring.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Eat in plenty and be satisfied. Amen.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Now, if God says what you see happening
[1:10:44] around, I want you to notice that the
[1:10:46] next season is going to be summer. So if
[1:10:49] the next season is summer, you are in
[1:10:51] spring, what's you what did God say we
[1:10:53] ought to do now? He said eat in plenty.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. Because some is going to be
[1:10:59] hot.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Eat in plenty.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Our responsibility.
[1:11:06] What is be it behold us in this season
[1:11:08] when you see all them war going on? Not
[1:11:10] to get panic.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Not to get panicked
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; but keep focused. Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Retain our faith.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Retain our confidence.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Eat in plenty.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Keep eating in plenty.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Know that you are carrying the agapa
[1:11:29] love.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; About to transform.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's what he says.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; The season that we're in is not a season
[1:11:38] for panic. For the children of God, you
[1:11:40] can't panic.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Why would you panic if God said to you,
[1:11:43] "Go down. go down the road, you see a
[1:11:45] red car and you go and see the red car,
[1:11:48] you're frightened. Why would you
[1:11:49] frighten?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; you never understood them or you weren't
[1:11:52] listening.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; But now that you understand the word,
[1:11:54] that's why I said when you see this man,
[1:11:56] when you understand the appearing,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; of the angel of the covenant in your
[1:12:01] season,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; he said when you understand that, he
[1:12:04] says summer is near.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; When you understand that, he says summer
[1:12:12] is near. It behooves us. So I wonder how
[1:12:16] people don't have that desire for
[1:12:17] fellowship,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; People losing the appetite for the word
[1:12:22] of God,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; People losing that that connection of
[1:12:26] love with one another. people losing
[1:12:29] that and it becomes such a ritual
[1:12:31] sometime the meeting and the gatherings
[1:12:33] and you know I tell you know excuse if I
[1:12:36] say that sometime these big meetings and
[1:12:38] these big convention is nothing but a
[1:12:40] show
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; and sometime the weak get trampled
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; a big spiritual stampede
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; because the weaker ones get trampled and
[1:12:50] the big ones are glorified
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; how many leaves sometimes filled with
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; how many leaves sometimes times. Amen.
[1:12:59] Uhhuh. Being healed.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; How many
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; have been to great meetings and the
[1:13:06] young people left without the baptism of
[1:13:08] the Holy Ghost? Nobody. There is no
[1:13:09] revival. It's a show, a spiritual
[1:13:13] stampede. The weak get trampled and this
[1:13:15] Amen. And the strong are glorified.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; That's not the purpose. No,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; we need to see young people or old
[1:13:22] people, anybody receiving the power and
[1:13:25] the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; You want to see another Pentecost again.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. People dancing and
[1:13:32] skipping under the anointing and the
[1:13:35] presence of God.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's more than just
[1:13:39] preaching and reciting a few words.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; We desire that this is the season,
[1:13:45] saints of God.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; This is the season.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what can trigger
[1:13:52] somebody or lift people faith. Brother
[1:13:54] Dale
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; when people start to see things
[1:13:59] happening.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Let people start to see the signs and
[1:14:07] wonders that supposed to follow the
[1:14:09] believers following them.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; People faith just start to lift now.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Their confidence start to rise again.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; This the truth.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's the truth.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Here's the truth.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; A man not going to be attracted because,
[1:14:25] oh, he dress nice. Look at his tie. Oh,
[1:14:27] he's a real Christian.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That season is pass.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's not a season.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; He's a real Christian. Listen how we
[1:14:33] preach.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, look at how he dress. Oh, there goes
[1:14:36] the son of God. That season is pass.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; People are looking for Christ.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; People are looking for Christ.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do you think so many people
[1:14:45] out there in the world are being
[1:14:46] tricked?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Because they're looking for Christ.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; They're being tricked.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; They're being tricked.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; They're being deceived. That's why the
[1:14:56] word say if it was possible, even the
[1:14:58] very elect deceived,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; but it's not possible.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because only a few is going to
[1:15:06] catch the revelation.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Of the season.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's Not who God
[1:15:11] is, not who Christ is, of the season.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the season is
[1:15:16] important.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Let's just pray.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Father, in the name of
[1:15:26] Jesus, just a few words you could say
[1:15:28] today, Lord.
[1:15:30] Oh God, reminding us, heavenly father,
[1:15:33] of the season that we're in. Christ
[1:15:36] Jesus
[1:15:38] tool us these things.

[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; but for us God to to to lift our hopes
[1:15:46] and Lord regain our confidence Lord
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; to look into the word to understand what
[1:15:54] you are doing in this last day. You says
[1:15:57] these things Lord is just the beginning
[1:15:59] of sorrow. But in the midst of the
[1:16:02] sorrow, Lord, there is joy.
[1:16:06] There is happiness. There is confidence.
[1:16:09] There's a revival taking place in the
[1:16:12] heart of your people individually
[1:16:14] because our redemption is near.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Lord, we're looking for
[1:16:21] the time.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; We're under the anointing of the last
[1:16:25] day. And this anointing is not bringing
[1:16:28] about a psychological depression. We're
[1:16:30] not depressed, oh God. But we're under
[1:16:33] expectation for a body change.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are under expectation, Lord, to
[1:16:39] see your work manifest through our
[1:16:42] lives, Lord Jesus. You went further and
[1:16:45] you said when they see these things,
[1:16:47] they know that the kingdom of God is
[1:16:51] near.
[1:16:53] Now they know that the kingdom of God is
[1:16:56] at hand. Thank you, Lord. That season
[1:17:00] when men's heart failing for fear is the
[1:17:03] season when you said we ought to seek
[1:17:05] the kingdom of God first and his
[1:17:08] righteousness.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; That's first God's kingdom and his
[1:17:13] righteousness first. where our desire
[1:17:17] is,
[1:17:19] what is upon our heart in this season,
[1:17:21] Lord, as the Holy Spirit asks, what is
[1:17:24] it that we put on the forefront of our
[1:17:27] minds?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Are we under expectation for the
[1:17:30] resurrection of the saints that are
[1:17:33] sleeping? Are we possessing that agapa
[1:17:36] love, Lord, to see our brothers and
[1:17:38] sisters again? Oh God, Lord, to see God.
[1:17:42] People dancing in the spirit, Lord.
[1:17:44] People living again for God, Lord. And
[1:17:48] oh, people receiving the baptism of the
[1:17:50] Holy Spirit, Lord, how we in that
[1:17:53] atmosphere.
[1:17:56] Oh God. Lord,
[1:17:59] I pray today, Lord, as we hear the word
[1:18:02] and get back to the scriptures as a
[1:18:05] prophet point us, may we look into this
[1:18:09] very word that you gave us to understand
[1:18:12] the season that we're living in and what
[1:18:15] is expected of us in this season. Lord,
[1:18:20] how many walking with Joshua, Lord, and
[1:18:24] a a different generation that you rose
[1:18:26] up to follow Joshua into their adoption
[1:18:31] because those under Moses, Lord, they
[1:18:34] they would not have even accepted
[1:18:36] Joshua's leadership,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Different method and they Oh, God. But
[1:18:42] you rose up another generation.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Lord that will understand
[1:18:48] that you are not changing.
[1:18:52] You are bringing them further and
[1:18:55] further to the promise.
[1:18:58] May we not just sing that we feel the
[1:19:00] pull
[1:19:02] Lord because it's written in a book but
[1:19:06] may we testify tonight that I feel that
[1:19:10] pull.
[1:19:12] I feel that call.
[1:19:15] Oh, that theophony.
[1:19:17] Oh, God. As the prophet said, there's a
[1:19:19] promised body. There's a promised
[1:19:22] resurrection.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. That ising in our
[1:19:27] souls tonight, I believe that from my
[1:19:30] heart, Lord, any time now,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; we we shall be seeing our brothers and
[1:19:36] sisters appearing and appear. The
[1:19:38] prophet said they will appear to us for
[1:19:40] a few days. Oh God, that will climax our
[1:19:43] faith so much. What will be left? What
[1:19:46] will leave is just our body change.
[1:19:48] Glory. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Glory.
[1:19:52] Yes, Lord.
[1:19:54] Hallelujah.
[1:19:56] Glory to God.
[1:19:58] That's the word of God. Saints,
[1:20:01] let us look up. It's not a time to
[1:20:05] complain and fuss.
[1:20:07] is the time we look up and lift up our
[1:20:10] heads.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; For our redemption is on the scene.
[1:20:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; for speaking to us tonight, God in
[1:20:21] Jesus. Blessed, holy, and wonderful
[1:20:26] name. Let every knee bow and every
[1:20:29] tongue confess that you are Lord.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus,
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; you are Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] You are Lord.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; You are Lord.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; You are Lord.
[1:20:42] Oh saints, what a presence of the Lord.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; What a presence of the Lord is in this
[1:20:49] place.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; None other God but your Lord.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Let him be exalted among us.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Let him be exalted through our lives.
[1:21:01] Let the presence and the attributes of
[1:21:04] Almighty God manifest through our lives.
[1:21:07] Lord,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; that's the real purpose we are here in
[1:21:10] this season.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are the witness.
[1:21:16] We are the true weakness. Hallelujah. Of
[1:21:19] the resurrected Christ.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But we are the remnant
[1:21:24] upon this earth that only a few will
[1:21:27] recognize when they see the son of man
[1:21:31] come in the cloud to understand his
[1:21:34] coming and the purpose of his coming is
[1:21:38] an invisible union with his bride.
[1:21:42] Thank you Jesus.
[1:21:46] Oh glory to God.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; My soul
[1:21:54] Bless you, pastor.

[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:11] and I know his me. Pres
[1:22:15] me to give my
[1:22:22] peace

[1:22:34] Lord please come and take control. I
[1:22:40] feel above.
[1:22:45] Amen. Let's sing that song. Surely the
[1:22:48] presence of the Lord is in this place.
[1:22:50] And let's not just think of it as a
[1:22:52] church,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; but is in our body, in our soul, in our
[1:22:56] in who we are. Surely the presence of
[1:22:59] God is in me.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; In me. Amen. Surely
[1:23:06] the presence
[1:23:09] of the Lord is in this place.
[1:23:14] I can feel his mighty power and his
[1:23:20] grace.
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:23] I can hear
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; on his face.
[1:23:34] Surely
[1:23:36] the presence of the Lord is in this
[1:23:42] place.
[1:23:44] For surely
[1:23:46] the presence of the Lord is in this
[1:23:52] place.
[1:23:53] I can feel his mighty power
[1:23:58] and his grace.
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:03] I can hear the rush of angels voice
[1:24:09] of glory.
[1:24:12] Surely
[1:24:16] the presence of the Lord
[1:24:21] is in this place. Hallelujah. Thank you
[1:24:25] Lord Jesus.
[1:24:27] Thank you Lord Jesus. You know, as
[1:24:30] brother Osman was ministering, I thought
[1:24:33] of the story in the Bible when they came
[1:24:35] to Jesus
[1:24:36] and he was on earth
[1:24:39] and they said, "We would that you would
[1:24:41] show us the Father."
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to him, he said, "I've
[1:24:46] been with you
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; all this time,
[1:24:51] and you don't know me
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and you didn't see the Father.
[1:24:57] I've been living my whole life.
[1:25:00] And our neighbors come and they say,
[1:25:02] "Could you lead me to Jesus,
[1:25:05] but you are Jesus on earth?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; You are the representation
[1:25:10] of Jesus Christ on earth." Amen. If the
[1:25:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost is Paul said,
[1:25:16] "It's Christ in me. It's no longer I
[1:25:18] that liveth, but Christ, the anointed
[1:25:20] one, God. It's no longer I'm living.
[1:25:23] It's not hell. Christ the anointed one
[1:25:26] in me. Wow, man. If we could just when
[1:25:30] we get to that maturity where where
[1:25:33] everything we do, we just represent
[1:25:35] Christ and then the outside world just
[1:25:37] say, "Wow."
[1:25:39] So there he goes.
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus could say, "When you've seen me,
[1:25:48] you've seen the father."
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz they were one.
[1:25:52] Amen. for us to go in the rapture. We'll
[1:25:54] be one just like a marriage union. We'll
[1:25:57] be one.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:02] Amazing. Amen. God help me. God help me.
[1:26:06] Let's sing. I bless my name. I bless
[1:26:07] your name.
[1:26:11] I bless you.
[1:26:16] We start with a
[1:26:18] start with a course in prison chains.
[1:26:21] In prison chains
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:25] with bleeding stripes
[1:26:30] both fall inside
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] and
[1:26:39] in their way
[1:26:44] to sing.
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:49] Hallelujah.
[1:26:51] And they were free.
[1:26:55] I bless your name.
[1:26:59] I bless your name.
[1:27:03] I give you all.
[1:27:07] I give you praise.
[1:27:11] You are alive.
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:16] [Applause]
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:18] Hallelujah. I bless your name.
[1:27:24] I bless your name.
[1:27:28] Some me.
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:39] Thank you Lord.
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:47] Thank you Jesus.
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:56] Amen.
[1:27:57] In Jesus name
[1:28:01] I bless your name.
[1:28:05] I bless your name.
[1:28:10] I am
[1:28:14] I
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:27] bless your name.
[1:28:31] I bless your name. Let's sing the chorus
[1:28:34] one more time. I bless your name. Yeah.
[1:28:39] Heat.
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:29:00] I praise your name.
[1:29:04] I praise your name.
[1:29:09] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, we
[1:29:12] thank you for your word, Lord God. Lord,
[1:29:15] I pray that we'll all just grow into
[1:29:17] this statue of this perfect man that you
[1:29:20] had foreseen in in us, Lord God. And may
[1:29:25] we be like the disciples when they were
[1:29:27] healing the sick outside the tabernacle
[1:29:29] in the Bible. And Peter, they're going
[1:29:32] along to heal. And Peter said, "Look on
[1:29:34] us."
[1:29:36] Because Peter had received
[1:29:39] you, Jesus.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[1:29:43] we sure love you, Jesus.
[1:29:46] We love you and we praise you. We give
[1:29:49] you the glory and honor.
[1:29:52] Thank you, Lord God, for coming inside
[1:29:54] of us and taking complete control.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, we surrender our will. We
[1:30:00] surrender our life. We surrender
[1:30:03] everything. We surrender our thoughts.
[1:30:06] surrender everything to you. The leading
[1:30:09] of the Holy Spirit,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; what you want us to do,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; we'll do. Jesus, we love you with all of
[1:30:19] our hearts. Bless our fellowship after
[1:30:21] and and just bring us together again on
[1:30:24] Sunday to hear what you have for us,
[1:30:27] Lord Jesus. We pray. Amen. Hey. Hey.
[1:30:29] Hey.
