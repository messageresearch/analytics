[38:06] you have your seats for a moment you've
[38:07] been standing
[38:09] we bring you greetings from my pastor
[38:11] brother john andy's in ferndale
[38:13] washington state
[38:14] we have a little work there that we the
[38:16] lord has put on his heart about six
[38:17] months ago to start as brother dale was
[38:20] saying the border is closed still and so
[38:22] there's many saints that need a church
[38:23] right
[38:24] can you you can't go out you cannot go
[38:27] without oxygen very long and breathe so
[38:31] that is why a church is essential for
[38:33] every believer to have a home church and
[38:35] a home pastor that they can come and
[38:37] have fellowship with god
[38:39] and so we're so thankful for that and
[38:42] now this covet devil that's tried to
[38:43] take out the bride he is defeated and
[38:46] this time we are going to have the final
[38:49] say we are going to be victorious the
[38:51] bride will be victorious
[38:53] amen how many believe that
[38:56] kova the devil thought he was going to
[38:57] pull a fast one and for many it took
[39:00] them out spiritually they became lazy
[39:02] christians and we don't know where they
[39:04] are today they're casualties of satan
[39:06] he's taken them out of the battle but at
[39:09] the end time it says i will restore
[39:11] saith the lord not i might i might
[39:14] restore i will restore
[39:16] and if you believe that the message is
[39:18] for you you will be restored you'll be
[39:21] restored to your ought to be conditioned
[39:24] amen i better not get preaching here
[39:27] but we want to say thank you to brother
[39:28] dale i've never met brother dale in
[39:30] person and he had reached out to me on
[39:34] facebook social media had heard some of
[39:36] our podcasts and some services i had
[39:38] preached and
[39:40] he just felt to invite us i prayed about
[39:42] it another friend of mine said yeah he's
[39:43] a wonderful brother a couple of my other
[39:46] minister friends said uh we know brother
[39:48] dale very well he used to travel to
[39:50] uganda where i'm going next month
[39:52] and so by god's grace um
[39:55] we have the same desire and vision
[39:57] it's not one man vision it's a bride
[39:59] vision it's not one man preaching this
[40:02] gospel and running with a message it's a
[40:03] many-membered body
[40:05] and the devil ain't stopping us
[40:08] amen and the devil is trying to make
[40:09] people and lie to them and say
[40:11] everyone's leaving the message and i am
[40:13] here to say no there are more coming
[40:15] into this message which the message is
[40:17] jesus christ to deny this message is
[40:20] deny jesus christ
[40:22] you crucified jesus christ unawares and
[40:24] they don't even know it they're spitting
[40:26] in his face but we're here to exalt the
[40:28] name of jesus there's power in the name
[40:30] of jesus to break every chain and that's
[40:33] what we want to talk about tonight we
[40:34] want to speak words of life and now we
[40:37] want to take it and believe it amen
[40:40] my name is brother tim i have a wife
[40:41] sister jessica we have three kids by
[40:43] god's grace
[40:45] it hasn't been easy though we had three
[40:47] children before we had our first child
[40:49] that passed away prematurely so you go
[40:52] through trials in your life you go
[40:54] through things where you lose kids you
[40:55] don't understand
[40:57] anyone ever been there
[41:00] any bride member ever been there anyone
[41:01] dreaming that never heard the name
[41:03] william branham
[41:04] know what we believe why we believe it
[41:07] and we believe that it brings liberty
[41:09] it does not bondage its freedom
[41:13] this mess
[41:15] oh it's
[41:16] grace grace love love love
[41:20] mercy rewrote our life and by god's
[41:23] grace my father has served and was born
[41:25] the message um raised by my grandfather
[41:28] who actually transcribed and edited
[41:31] every message book that you read in
[41:32] english he worked at vgr
[41:35] and then spoken word publications before
[41:37] so that's my grandpa brother ken and by
[41:39] god's grace he's still alive still
[41:41] preaching this gospel so there's a
[41:43] vindication that this message is true
[41:45] you want to say you want to argue people
[41:47] want to argue this message but i'm here
[41:49] to say the life proves that this message
[41:52] is real and people that receive it in
[41:54] its pure form will be free
[41:58] love it they want more of it hallelujah
[42:01] so in my opening comments i just want to
[42:03] say by god's grace i've been born in the
[42:05] message never have gone out into the
[42:07] things of this world and i believe that
[42:09] is a
[42:10] that this gospel is true
[42:12] the gospel holds he keeps young people
[42:16] safe and if you've gone astray you have
[42:18] a testimony as well to tell your
[42:20] children or others you don't have to go
[42:22] there you don't have to go there amen
[42:24] you don't have to go down my road the
[42:26] mistakes i made my past history has been
[42:30] cleared
[42:31] and i was forgiven at calvary
[42:34] so we're gonna
[42:46] around people are in churches and
[42:48] they're coming in with chains on
[42:50] and what i hear tonight is people
[42:52] are bound whites jebusites hittites
[42:56] they've got devil
[42:58] on their case and jesus is coming to
[43:00] tell you you can be free
[43:03] old ones can be free in jesus name young
[43:06] children can receive the baptism of the
[43:07] holy ghost
[43:09] young
[43:09] jesus more than they need water more

[44:45] matter lord
[44:46] so we invite you right now lord the
[44:48] angels of god that came in a prophet's
[44:51] services and he said i'm just waiting
[44:52] for the that angel to come on my right
[44:55] side lord and that same mighty angel or
[44:58] god we're waiting and we're expecting
[45:00] you lord to speak through my lips oh god
[45:03] oh circumcise my tongue god that i would
[45:06] speak words of life god from your word
[45:08] of life which has come and sent a
[45:11] prophet to speak and shown us truth and
[45:13] that truth has turned our hearts back to
[45:15] you
[45:18] oh god malachi has come elijah has come
[45:21] fulfilled scripture god and there's one
[45:24] part and we are that fulfillment of that
[45:26] as the believer we believe we will be
[45:28] raptured god we will be changed and
[45:31] taken away lord in a twinkling of an eye
[45:33] oh god
[45:35] but help us god in our families jesus
[45:38] churches to have a real liberty god not
[45:41] a fake liberty i didn't say we're fr
[45:44] as many in the world say i'm free i'm
[45:46] free i'm free but they're bound
[45:48] help us to be free indeed god and he
[45:50] whose son sets free will be free indeed
[45:52] forevermore oh god never to want to go
[45:55] back to those chains jesus

[45:59] your will
[46:00] lord if i don't even have to look at my
[46:02] note notes god just may your presence
[46:05] god and your holy spirit speak lord in
[46:07] jesus name
[46:09] amen amen praise the lord
[46:11] let's turn to galatians chapter 5
[46:14] galatians
[46:15] verse 1
[46:18] and then we'll turn to luke 4.
[46:20] galatians chapter 5 verse 1 says stand
[46:24] fast therefore in the liberty wherewith
[46:26] christ hath made us
[46:29] let's say that made us
[46:32] and be not entangled again
[46:35] with the yoke of bondage so you can be
[46:37] set free and then go back into slavery
[46:40] and you can be free on a sunday and on
[46:42] monday you're back
[46:44] free
[46:45] see but god is wanting to set you free
[46:47] and forever you're free indeed
[46:50] never to want to go back to bondage
[46:54] why would a person want to be free from
[46:55] drugs and alcohol
[46:57] have family be restored and then go back
[47:00] to
[47:05] the devil is the enemy the devil has
[47:07] crept into churches into young people's
[47:09] lives and told them this message is do's
[47:12] and don'ts and law
[47:13] that's the devil
[47:16] website any person that comes against
[47:18] this mess is coming against jesus christ
[47:20] himself the revealed word because the
[47:23] message is the same message brother
[47:25] branham preaches what we're hearing
[47:26] tonight if a vessel a five-fold
[47:29] gets out of the way then what his duty
[47:31] bound to do is to edify and uplift the
[47:33] body and if i don't edify and uplift you
[47:36] and you go out these doors and you don't
[47:38] feel that god spoke to you i've not done
[47:41] what i needed to do
[47:42] so now i'm asking as a minister that i'm
[47:45] going to the truth i'm asking that we
[47:48] would be believers of that
[47:50] let's go out and live it
[47:52] we don't need three hour five hour
[47:54] sermons all night prayer means though we
[47:57] do need that sometimes
[47:59] we need a life we need to go out to our
[48:01] families and our communities and live a
[48:04] life please
[48:06] live what we believe
[48:08] ashamed of this gospel
[48:10] ashamed who's not ashamed to say that i
[48:12] believe god sent a prophet and that
[48:15] prophet
[48:16] before he's turned my heart i find
[48:18] myself in the scriptures before the
[48:20] dreadful day of the lord my heart is
[48:22] changed and i am free i have liberty
[48:26] amen galatians chapter 5 verse 13 says
[48:30] for brethren ye have been called
[48:35] you know what it is like on my phone
[48:37] with me when you get a call right you're
[48:40] gonna
[48:41] click
[48:44] this morning this evening sorry this
[48:46] evening and tomorrow is going to be a
[48:47] call going out it's calling you by the
[48:49] tim it's calling you to say you know
[48:51] what there's things in your life it's
[48:53] time to do a little up here that's why
[48:55] we come to church dr jesus is wanting to
[48:57] talk to you he said
[48:59] hello and we're not answering the call
[49:02] we click no later
[49:04] on a phone sometimes in the past on an
[49:06] iphone it would say uh yes or accept or
[49:09] decline and then there was a one that
[49:11] said maybe later
[49:13] and that means that you're going to call
[49:14] him back and it sends you a reminder
[49:16] right people today are in churches and
[49:18] they hear the call you need to be born
[49:20] again i don't need that right now i
[49:22] don't want to give my life to christ 100
[49:25] no i'm saying no to the call well guess
[49:28] what one day that might be the last call
[49:32] and how many times was samuel called
[49:36] three times that's grace grace that god
[49:38] called him and then finally aster
[49:41] finally told him what to say and as a
[49:43] young boy he did it he believed it he
[49:46] received it and he had communion without
[49:50] god wants to commune with us tonight
[49:53] praise the lord we have been called
[49:57] only use here it is
[50:00] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[50:02] the flesh
[50:04] what do people say when
[50:07] i have liberty i am free
[50:11] free in their flesh
[50:13] right there
[50:15] but by love
[50:17] by love we need to serve one
[50:21] body we need a stocking of ourselves
[50:24] what if god changed me
[50:26] jared if god gave me salvation i want to
[50:28] share it
[50:29] right and if i believe that what i'm
[50:32] believing and received is different than
[50:34] the world it's something gonna separate
[50:41] by god's grace but
[50:43] here's what i i believe not all your
[50:45] children are here right now right
[50:47] and we're gonna we're gonna believe
[50:50] that that one could come walking in the
[50:51] he could string this service down the
[50:53] road and i'm telling him i will restore
[50:56] all the years maybe you don't know why
[50:58] but god's going to restore amen let's
[51:01] have our seats praise the lord amen
[51:03] who's excited to hear the word of god
[51:04] tonight
[51:06] i want to say like caleb i might be old
[51:08] you might feel like you're 70 80 years
[51:10] old but i'm young again give me strength
[51:13] god breathe life into me
[51:16] this
[51:17] service if you come to play church if
[51:19] you're right now and you've just come to
[51:21] hear a good talk you're in the wrong
[51:23] church you're listening to
[51:26] the believer of christ as a follower of
[51:29] jesus we believe a mess
[51:32] and we're running with that message
[51:33] we're running
[51:35] because we believe
[51:36] amen let's turn to luke 4.
[51:39] my notes turned off here luke 4.
[51:42] amen how many are free
[51:44] how many have experienced a freedom in
[51:47] the holy ghost
[51:48] our brother back in the back there's a
[51:50] older brother dale any that have gone
[51:52] for 20 30 years the message brings
[51:54] freedom
[51:56] anything that brings a question in doubt
[51:58] is of satan the enemy of god's word the
[52:01] enemy of this bible
[52:05] that the whole mission to make people
[52:07] doubt the message is also them doubt
[52:10] this
[52:11] to make them doubt the authority of the
[52:13] bible
[52:14] because brother branham pulled and said
[52:16] i must decree
[52:19] glorified
[52:20] and we need to make sure we're preaching
[52:22] jesus to people and not william branham
[52:25] i'll never baptize in william branham's
[52:27] name i'll never pray in his name because
[52:29] his name has no power
[52:32] his name has no power there's only one
[52:34] name that can save there's only one name
[52:37] that can help you and that's dr jesus
[52:39] jesus christ and he brings liberty and
[52:42] he uses
[52:43] god like he's using me uses your pastor
[52:46] uses men and sisters of god in the faith
[52:50] hallelujah to bring liberty
[52:54] but you need a message
[52:56] you need a message to play
[52:58] nuggets that lay in here
[53:01] that brings liberty
[53:03] my middle daughter's name is liberty so
[53:05] that that's where the inspiration came
[53:07] amen
[53:09] luke chapter four maybe tomorrow we'll
[53:10] put a picture up of the family see that
[53:14] little boaz was just born one month ago
[53:16] amen praise god
[53:18] number three god works in threes
[53:21] amen luke chapter 4 verse 18 says in in
[53:24] my bible it's red isn't your
[53:27] okay the spirit of the lord is upon me
[53:30] because he hath anointed me to preach
[53:33] the gospel
[53:36] i want you to take this personal don't
[53:37] just think as me like as a minister i
[53:40] want you sister to believe that you have
[53:42] a gospel to preach to preach to the poor
[53:44] that are needy
[53:46] poor in spirit
[53:49] those that are poor that have that need
[53:52] and have we have been sent here it is he
[53:54] has sent me sister brother to heal
[53:58] the brokenhearted
[54:00] the message brings healing
[54:03] the message of the hour preached by a
[54:06] prophet brings healing
[54:08] if it's believed in that way
[54:10] if you believe a doctor has the
[54:12] prescription you need
[54:15] what he gives you will help you
[54:18] but he can do all the science he wants
[54:20] and if you go to the doctor and you
[54:23] here's my problem i need help but you
[54:25] don't want what he has you can't receive
[54:28] your healing
[54:30] it's the same with our lord jesus you
[54:32] can come to an altar you can raise your
[54:34] hands
[54:35] prayer but if you believe their faith
[54:37] cannot ignite it cannot anchor in a
[54:39] person's womb
[54:43] because what has happened is people have
[54:44] received in their womb a doubt
[54:47] a seed of doubt
[54:49] and that can bring forth a life right
[54:53] and you start to show the life
[54:55] negativity in the atmosphere anyone ever
[54:57] been around
[54:59] you don't want to be around that
[55:01] that negative
[55:03] ministry all the time questioning their
[55:05] motives questioning what they're doing
[55:07] questioning the finances in the church
[55:09] that leads to hypocrisy it leads to
[55:12] actually it leads to where you're
[55:14] questioning every person that could help
[55:17] you
[55:19] he's like a doctor your pastor's like a
[55:21] doctor i want to help you a good pastor
[55:24] a good shepherd
[55:25] cares for the sheep
[55:29] and he heals the brokenhearted isaiah 61
[55:33] is in reference to that to preach
[55:35] deliverance to the captives
[55:38] today's service is to preach liberty to
[55:41] the captive
[55:43] to the bound and those of you that will
[55:45] listen that have left the message
[55:47] because you listened to a friend
[55:50] and you listened to them and now look at
[55:52] their life they're divorced they left
[55:54] everything their makeup they're got two
[55:57] and three husbands
[55:59] and that's what you want to follow
[56:01] there's a result of every decision in
[56:03] your life
[56:04] what we are speaking is life to help a
[56:08] family to not see divorce happen in a
[56:10] family and separation who likes to
[56:12] divorce in a family
[56:13] who likes to see a section in a church
[56:16] not one person in their right mind with
[56:18] god
[56:21] if it's a body
[56:23] in the faith then we say we're the bride
[56:25] of christ but we attack other bride
[56:27] members
[56:28] because they don't go to our church
[56:31] our young people will not want to serve
[56:33] a god
[56:35] in our churches so our it starts with
[56:38] the ministry it starts then with the
[56:40] parents in the home be real be genuine
[56:44] be yourself
[56:46] to be a shouter and praise the lord and
[56:48] dance around do that
[56:50] if you're meant to be a quiet sister and
[56:52] just knock your head praise god and
[56:54] you're plugging it out and no one knows
[56:57] what through all right
[56:59] praise god but you still believe your
[57:02] family might be forsaken who might have
[57:03] left you but you still believe amen but
[57:06] you need the one just as much as you
[57:08] need shouting amen one because i'm going
[57:10] to tell you right now ministries need
[57:12] feedback they need a pool if you're not
[57:15] pooling i'm not going to preach
[57:17] because that obviously means i'm boring
[57:19] that obviously means there's no what i'm
[57:21] saying
[57:22] and 90 of denominations is dead formal
[57:26] blind miserable and naked and don't know
[57:28] it that's scripture and if you want that
[57:30] kind of church leave the message right
[57:32] now
[57:34] relieve it and run away because the
[57:35] message does not bring bondage this
[57:38] brings liver and you can praise the lord
[57:41] you can shout hallelujah you can jump up
[57:44] and down
[57:45] but you can also just sit there
[57:47] okay
[57:48] there's a groaning inside like a growing
[57:51] does anyone see the hunger
[57:53] hungry for something no but there's a
[57:55] hunger there's a deep desire brother
[57:57] felix there's a deep desire for the
[57:59] things of god that desire the prophet
[58:01] said came from god
[58:03] god gave you the desire for the holy
[58:05] ghost he gives you a dirt deep hunger
[58:08] and he's going to give you a
[58:09] determination
[58:13] so you have you have to have the right
[58:15] desire
[58:16] you must have a hunger for the things of
[58:18] god and he will
[58:20] fill that desire
[58:23] amen so i have decided that i only need
[58:27] to read my bible
[58:29] and a message
[58:31] i don't need to read psychology
[58:34] i don't need a psychology book to tell
[58:36] me how to raise my children
[58:37] i can read a proverb a day keep the
[58:39] devil away in my family
[58:41] show
[58:43] the name of the wisest man in this world
[58:45] solomon
[58:46] i don't need a psychologist to tell me
[58:48] how to raise my kids when his own kids
[58:51] don't know what gender
[58:57] i've been in it i went through college i
[58:59] would not recommend one young person to
[59:02] go to college that does not know 100
[59:05] that they have the holy
[59:08] sister should go to college unless she
[59:10] knows god wants her to go there a
[59:12] brother does not mean if you go to
[59:16] that
[59:24] we are not believing in a god a dead
[59:26] religion we believe in a living god
[59:30] that does miracles in every service we
[59:32] come to
[59:33] we might not see them every time
[59:36] right
[59:37] we might not see it and when the prophet
[59:40] started preaching the third pool what
[59:42] happened his friends left him the money
[59:44] and the finances no one wanted to
[59:47] so that's a good thing when people start
[59:49] leaving the church it's a good thing
[59:51] because right at the end it's harvest
[59:53] time
[59:56] get that get that shaft get that that
[59:58] thing that's just like the wheat it's
[1:00:01] right so close and i'm gonna tell you
[1:00:03] right now it'll deceive the very elect
[1:00:05] and they're in and they say they believe
[1:00:08] brother branham is a prophet
[1:00:12] how can you say that but because
[1:00:15] because they are deceiving themselves
[1:00:18] thinking brother branham brings
[1:00:19] salvation
[1:00:23] not bring salvation
[1:00:25] jesus christ has brought us salvation
[1:00:27] brother branham said i point to jesus
[1:00:30] christ i lift up jesus christ i want to
[1:00:33] decrease i'm going to say it again so
[1:00:35] that he might increase that is not to
[1:00:37] put down brother
[1:00:39] ministry that is not to say brother dale
[1:00:41] we you as a pastor you need a pastor
[1:00:44] a active in-person pastor that can be
[1:00:48] there and touch you that can pray for
[1:00:50] you not some internet pastor that's just
[1:00:53] got a big congregation and sanitize me
[1:00:57] that's e
[1:00:58] brother dale could just stay at home the
[1:01:00] last two years he could just chill at
[1:01:02] his house and say keep paying your
[1:01:04] tithes i'm going to preach the truth is
[1:01:06] he preaching the right message yeah he
[1:01:08] can be he can be preaching the message
[1:01:09] 100 truth
[1:01:11] everything he's saying is great
[1:01:15] wrong approach
[1:01:17] not
[1:01:25] it's anti-bible
[1:01:27] it's anti-word
[1:01:29] and if you want to go in a rapture you
[1:01:31] better get off your couch you better get
[1:01:33] off your couch and go to church
[1:01:36] because you've deceived yourself you do
[1:01:39] not the you definitely don't believe the
[1:01:41] message because the prophet of god said
[1:01:43] you need
[1:01:46] without a five-fold ministry you will
[1:01:48] die our young people will die you can
[1:01:51] only push play for so long before your
[1:01:53] children will see it's dead
[1:01:57] but praise god i push play every day
[1:02:02] i listen to the prophet every day
[1:02:03] and i listen to the part that tells them
[1:02:05] to go to church
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:08] the part the doors are open doesn't
[1:02:11] matter how sick i am sister brother i'm
[1:02:13] gonna be in church
[1:02:15] i have four or five children i
[1:02:16] understand brother sister i have three
[1:02:18] of them but you know what after one week
[1:02:21] of my child the third one being born we
[1:02:23] were
[1:02:24] in church
[1:02:26] what does that tell our children
[1:02:29] church matters
[1:02:33] but now church is this
[1:02:35] you know we just chill
[1:02:37] we get our coffee and pjs
[1:02:40] don't have sunday school directly
[1:02:42] against what brother branham said that
[1:02:43] is why bondage is creeping in the
[1:02:45] message
[1:02:47] bondage
[1:02:49] just the very elect so the truth will be
[1:02:51] preached by true five-fold ministry amen
[1:02:55] true five-fold ministry what will they
[1:02:57] do
[1:02:58] first timothy edifying
[1:03:03] not beat down
[1:03:05] not say sheep or bad you have to do it
[1:03:07] my way
[1:03:10] they will not misinterpret the word a
[1:03:12] true fivefold minister will not add his
[1:03:14] own thought he will not think and lift
[1:03:16] up his even if there was a vision even
[1:03:19] during that his ministry would be
[1:03:20] special he is not special
[1:03:24] any man that tells you has a special
[1:03:25] ministry in this time right now is a
[1:03:27] liar and a false prophet
[1:03:30] any man doesn't matter if he believes
[1:03:32] he's in the message doesn't matter if
[1:03:33] he's a friend of the prophet
[1:03:35] it doesn't matter
[1:03:37] because i've seen many friends of the
[1:03:39] prophet leave the message
[1:03:42] when brother branham died they left
[1:03:45] bondage why because they loved the man's
[1:03:48] gift but they didn't love the jesus that
[1:03:51] he preached and that jesus is the same
[1:03:54] thing that paul preached
[1:03:57] read your bible
[1:03:58] i challenge any person for 30 days to
[1:04:01] read their bible
[1:04:03] all that paul said and the message of
[1:04:06] the hour and you see how many times it's
[1:04:08] exactly what paul preached
[1:04:11] and now we're in the 21st century
[1:04:14] i hope this is all right now we're in
[1:04:16] another century and the prophet is gone
[1:04:19] full ministry now has to take an
[1:04:21] anointing and they need to use words
[1:04:23] like
[1:04:24] facebook they need to use words like
[1:04:27] websites
[1:04:28] because what it was back then was not
[1:04:30] websites it was a tape
[1:04:33] right then it became the cd
[1:04:35] and then it got greater and great
[1:04:37] free to listen to the message why aren't
[1:04:40] we more free when it's free
[1:04:46] why are we not more free when the
[1:04:47] message is now free
[1:04:49] cost
[1:04:50] to us
[1:04:52] a brother once he preached the service i
[1:04:54] was in
[1:04:55] and he showed how in the tapes you would
[1:04:57] pay thousands of dollars to get all the
[1:04:59] cassettes true
[1:05:01] that was the value they placed on it
[1:05:03] four or five thousand dollars i think he
[1:05:04] said and then as time continued they had
[1:05:06] the cd you pay like 129 dollars you get
[1:05:09] all the cds of brother phantom okay
[1:05:13] commercially whatever you want to call
[1:05:15] it financially the monetary value is
[1:05:18] getting less
[1:05:20] and when something becomes free it's not
[1:05:23] a bad thing but now the value is mean
[1:05:28] we need to make sure in the message that
[1:05:30] because we have it free don't get
[1:05:32] trapped that we don't get thinking it
[1:05:34] relax and actually reading it less
[1:05:38] when we have the most bible apps and we
[1:05:40] have the most bibles ever printed but
[1:05:42] we're not reading our bible
[1:05:46] help us god
[1:05:48] help us jesus
[1:05:49] we need parents that are going to stand
[1:05:51] against what the devil is teaching
[1:05:53] the devil his spirit his using
[1:05:56] governments right now in canada and in
[1:05:58] the u.s
[1:06:01] to cause gay marriage to be acceptable
[1:06:03] of satan
[1:06:05] satanic and the pope will accept that
[1:06:07] and say it's eight and now millions and
[1:06:09] billions of people accept it
[1:06:11] we know because a prophet said that's
[1:06:13] the antichrist and we know and i'm gonna
[1:06:16] say it quickly for those who never heard
[1:06:18] this there will one day be relents on
[1:06:21] that system
[1:06:22] and they will bail out america
[1:06:25] there was a vision that was spoken and
[1:06:27] the prophet said and prophesied that the
[1:06:29] roman catholic church will bail them out
[1:06:33] and they will become dependent on them
[1:06:35] guess what right now the president of
[1:06:38] the u.s is catholic
[1:06:41] the pres the vice president says she's
[1:06:43] catholic
[1:06:46] spirit has come in to the white house
[1:06:49] and i can say that because i'm an
[1:06:50] american and i'm not against government
[1:06:52] i want to say that publicly we are not
[1:06:53] against the american government brother
[1:06:55] branham said to pray for president pray
[1:06:57] for those in leadership so justin
[1:06:59] trudeau if you listen to this service
[1:07:01] i'm praying for you brother that you
[1:07:03] catch your revelation to open your
[1:07:04] border so that people can fellowship
[1:07:07] once again
[1:07:11] do you know what he's done you know what
[1:07:12] justin trudeau has done i'm sorry saints
[1:07:15] but what he they have done is
[1:07:17] coveted a devil to such a great and
[1:07:19] mighty thing and now it's causing mental
[1:07:22] issues
[1:07:23] it's caused mental issues
[1:07:26] and the mentalist institut will have
[1:07:29] more
[1:07:30] people than kovit ever took out in life
[1:07:33] our children without without being in
[1:07:35] person school and i'm a teacher by the
[1:07:37] way or was a teacher um
[1:07:40] our children will suffer
[1:07:43] developmentally they're going to suffer
[1:07:44] because of covet
[1:07:46] and that's so negative right brother it
[1:07:48] seems so
[1:07:49] but i'm here to tell you that covet
[1:07:50] stands for christ overcomes all
[1:07:54] infections and diseases that's what my
[1:07:56] god said christ overcomes viruses
[1:07:59] infections and diseases and i don't to
[1:08:02] fear it
[1:08:03] and i don't have to wear a mask
[1:08:08] it's now proven masks don't work
[1:08:12] i'm going to tell you right
[1:08:16] let's save you the prophet of god had a
[1:08:18] prophecy about
[1:08:20] and you need to go
[1:08:21] maybe it'll make you see that the
[1:08:23] prophet saw this coming
[1:08:25] he saw there would be uh violence there
[1:08:28] would be a cancer that would come and
[1:08:30] the cancer now naturally speaking is
[1:08:33] coming into the church spiritually
[1:08:34] there's cancers growing and they
[1:08:36] multiply very quickly
[1:08:38] our churches will not grow bigger in the
[1:08:40] message
[1:08:41] i'm not looking for 5 000 people to
[1:08:43] follow me i want
[1:08:44] here's the service on the internet and
[1:08:46] that's here today to say i want to
[1:08:48] follow jesus
[1:08:50] i'm going to follow jesus no matter what
[1:08:52] i do no matter what my family says
[1:08:55] i will be abraham i'm going to separate
[1:08:57] myself from lot
[1:09:01] but what's happening is we're playing
[1:09:03] playing church
[1:09:05] and we can bring our family and
[1:09:07] go to heaven
[1:09:09] you're in the message
[1:09:11] but have you given your have you been
[1:09:12] born again
[1:09:13] have you really been born again
[1:09:16] and we tell our children brother dale
[1:09:17] hey
[1:09:18] you believe the message
[1:09:26] because now when he comes to the age of
[1:09:28] accountability his dad can apply the
[1:09:29] token but now he needs to apply the
[1:09:31] token the token is the baptism of the
[1:09:34] holy ghost to have a personal
[1:09:35] relationship with him our children need
[1:09:37] the truth spoken to them not a bunch of
[1:09:40] lies
[1:09:42] you're going to heaven you're not going
[1:09:43] to heaven
[1:09:45] because mommy and daddy my dad's our
[1:09:47] grandpa is a pastor
[1:09:49] serve and believe the message of the
[1:09:52] hour because my dad does i don't believe
[1:09:54] the message because my grandpa does i
[1:09:56] believe the message because it's real to
[1:09:58] me
[1:10:00] if you can say no matter what comes your
[1:10:03] way it doesn't matter what family says
[1:10:05] doesn't matter how many great ministers
[1:10:07] say i
[1:10:09] believe the message
[1:10:10] and i've taken my sabbatical and i've
[1:10:13] thought about it for seven months or
[1:10:14] eight months and now i want to be free
[1:10:18] so i'm setting down my ministry of 30
[1:10:20] years and i am now going to be free to
[1:10:23] do what
[1:10:26] go back to
[1:10:27] slavery
[1:10:29] look at their family
[1:10:30] and if you know who i'm talking about
[1:10:32] there's a couple not just one there's a
[1:10:34] spirit they leave the message and their
[1:10:36] family look at their kids
[1:10:38] look at not them look at their kids
[1:10:43] sodomites
[1:10:44] they go right back because they're lots
[1:10:47] they're part of lot's group but they
[1:10:48] were with abraham
[1:10:51] and that can be 20 years that can be 30
[1:10:53] years that can be 50 years brother
[1:10:56] oh my and then it hurts it really hurts
[1:11:00] to see and you're you're feeling
[1:11:02] groaning pains and birth but you need to
[1:11:03] make a choice today to be free
[1:11:07] i want to be free from all doubt all
[1:11:09] confusion
[1:11:11] any person that has ever tried to text
[1:11:13] you or call you or or
[1:11:17] persuade you the message isn't true
[1:11:19] you need to stop listening to that boy
[1:11:21] because a voice that's crying out trying
[1:11:24] to capture your heart sister try to
[1:11:26] capture your heart right now right week
[1:11:28] he's trying to capture your heart with
[1:11:31] lies
[1:11:33] and i personally know people that have
[1:11:35] left jesus christ which is the message
[1:11:38] of the hour for today that i'm preaching
[1:11:40] the same message jesus christ and they
[1:11:42] will hate the service they will say
[1:11:44] things on the internet brother dale
[1:11:46] guarantee you about you about me
[1:11:49] it happened a couple of weeks ago i
[1:11:50] spoke under brother church and he got
[1:11:52] blasted and i got blasted praise the
[1:11:54] lord i'll get blasted i'll take every
[1:11:57] punch of the devil's got cause i'm gonna
[1:11:59] stand victorious
[1:12:01] i'm gonna fight the fight for my
[1:12:02] children's sake for your children's sake
[1:12:06] because i don't want my children
[1:12:07] thinking it's a okay to sit in a church
[1:12:09] with an ipad
[1:12:11] this is church
[1:12:14] no
[1:12:15] deceived
[1:12:17] bondage oh but your children are happy
[1:12:19] and it keeps them quiet in church if
[1:12:21] this keeps them quiet in five years this
[1:12:24] same thing will kill and take their soul
[1:12:26] to hell
[1:12:27] because that it's a-okay to look at this
[1:12:30] instead of playing outside
[1:12:33] liberty comes freedom comes when you let
[1:12:36] your children worship in the god we
[1:12:38] serve you personal relationship you let
[1:12:41] him get baptized eat a little longer
[1:12:43] wait a little longer keep waiting keep
[1:12:45] waiting no
[1:12:47] brother brown is very clear if a child
[1:12:49] comes five six-year-old it could be and
[1:12:52] they say i desire baptism of the holy
[1:12:54] ghost if i was a father the only thing i
[1:12:55] would ask have you repented
[1:12:58] have you really repented if my
[1:13:00] four-year-old when i came back listens
[1:13:01] to the service and says daddy i want to
[1:13:03] be baptized
[1:13:04] i'm going to ask
[1:13:06] have you repented
[1:13:08] are you really so
[1:13:09] sick you've already committed because
[1:13:10] he's made mistakes
[1:13:12] so have i
[1:13:13] every day
[1:13:15] who has never made a mistake raise your
[1:13:17] hand and stand because we want to give
[1:13:18] you a handclap
[1:13:20] none of us
[1:13:21] so stop making church oh we're just all
[1:13:24] great people
[1:13:25] when i grew up i was at a camp okay i
[1:13:28] hope any of my friends that hear this
[1:13:29] aren't offended but i would at a camp
[1:13:32] at all my friends
[1:13:34] and
[1:13:36] you're a pk kid preacher's kid
[1:13:40] you have it so eat
[1:13:43] rugs
[1:13:44] you've never drank alcohol you don't
[1:13:46] even know how it feels
[1:13:49] to their face and they know i love them
[1:13:51] they know it i said right to their face
[1:13:53] i don't need alcohol
[1:13:55] i don't need to smoke i don't need a
[1:13:57] needle and a joint to make me happy
[1:13:59] because i've already seen the end of
[1:14:01] that road i have a family right now the
[1:14:03] alcohol divorce the smoking causes
[1:14:06] divorce
[1:14:09] that's bondage
[1:14:10] your alcohol is bondage you're a slave
[1:14:13] to alcohol you're a slave to drugs
[1:14:15] you're a slave to pornography
[1:14:18] eighty percent they say of christian men
[1:14:20] are in pornography and by the grace of
[1:14:22] god
[1:14:24] they can be delivered of that you've
[1:14:25] just gotta hate that spirit
[1:14:28] throw away your phone you gotta throw
[1:14:30] away your ipad not have it for a while
[1:14:34] break the habit just a habit
[1:14:37] it's not sin it's a it's the attribute
[1:14:40] of a sin and
[1:14:42] your sin and
[1:14:44] smoking
[1:14:45] adultery that is all because you have
[1:14:48] unbelief in this
[1:14:50] you do not believe this
[1:14:53] you do not believe jesus saves you do
[1:14:55] not believe he has power come in your
[1:14:57] life so therefore you deny
[1:15:00] power of christ in your life and you
[1:15:02] will never be defeated you'll never be
[1:15:04] delivered of that demon
[1:15:06] because you have a demon on you
[1:15:08] the more you drink the more you defile
[1:15:10] your body
[1:15:12] you have demons
[1:15:14] legion do when he was consumed by demons
[1:15:16] he ran from his family and left his
[1:15:19] family
[1:15:22] wasn't for the grace of god oh god if it
[1:15:25] wasn't for a message of malachi 4
[1:15:32] come out of her my people and be
[1:15:34] separate come out of your denominational
[1:15:36] ideas
[1:15:38] lutheranism methodism don't bring that
[1:15:41] into the message
[1:15:43] no your catholic spirit
[1:15:48] you had to pay to go to heaven so don't
[1:15:51] make your children feel like they gotta
[1:15:52] pay and they give you this three steps
[1:15:55] to salvation no they need to repent and
[1:15:57] be baptized in jesus name
[1:16:00] easy peasy simplicity is the gospel
[1:16:04] gospel is simple it's man that has made
[1:16:06] it complicated and that i'm here to say
[1:16:09] breach the message
[1:16:11] set the captive free it'll break bond
[1:16:15] a person can be a pastor's son and you
[1:16:17] will go to hell
[1:16:20] i believe brother abraham's a prophet
[1:16:22] brother tim
[1:16:24] i believe he's revelation 10 7. that's
[1:16:26] wonderful the devil believes it
[1:16:28] the devil knows it too
[1:16:30] that's why he's howling that's why he's
[1:16:32] attacking
[1:16:34] and the devil is bringing bondage on
[1:16:36] people because he's attack why is he
[1:16:37] attacking it
[1:16:39] let
[1:16:40] every person here that has a brain
[1:16:44] the brain
[1:16:46] one plus one equals two raise your if
[1:16:48] you're a little child and you know one
[1:16:49] plus one equals two okay i want you to
[1:16:51] remember this next statement okay it's
[1:16:52] not an equation
[1:16:54] if you believe something wasn't true
[1:16:57] okay
[1:16:58] and you left it and you don't believe it
[1:17:00] okay
[1:17:01] you don't believe it's true
[1:17:04] who agrees raise your hand if the right
[1:17:06] spirit and attitude and nature of god is
[1:17:09] if you leave something
[1:17:12] you don't talk bad about something you
[1:17:13] left
[1:17:16] that's the spirit and nature of god
[1:17:18] that's a person i'll follow
[1:17:20] brother bannon was a baptist brother
[1:17:21] branham preached to the pentecostals
[1:17:23] brother branham was in those churches
[1:17:25] but now we got people in the message i
[1:17:27] would never that message church
[1:17:29] i would never have fellowship with those
[1:17:31] people oh my goodness
[1:17:34] same thing
[1:17:36] they're talking bad about when the
[1:17:37] message what did brother branham say
[1:17:39] bride will not persecute
[1:17:43] so you want to say you're the bride and
[1:17:45] you're taking evil of people you're
[1:17:46] deleting them out canceling the council
[1:17:49] culture that's happening liberally in
[1:17:51] the world guess what it's happening in
[1:17:52] in the message we cancel people out
[1:17:55] because they don't agree with us we
[1:17:57] cancel them out because they see the
[1:17:58] message a little different guess what i
[1:18:00] have a revelation for you there's four
[1:18:02] sides to the pyramid and people see it
[1:18:04] from different sides
[1:18:07] okay
[1:18:08] so don't let anything in this message
[1:18:10] become a tingling entangling you in
[1:18:12] bondage
[1:18:14] don't let it happen
[1:18:16] believe what you want to believe knowing
[1:18:18] you can change the
[1:18:21] what he preached in 46 he is allowed to
[1:18:24] change in 53. ask any doubter and any if
[1:18:27] they've ever ch
[1:18:28] about god about a scripture ask the
[1:18:30] atheist
[1:18:33] ask the age
[1:18:37] philosophy is changing
[1:18:41] so do you want liberty or do you want
[1:18:42] bondage
[1:18:45] the message is liberty
[1:18:47] it brings freedom
[1:18:49] so the freedom to worship god now we can
[1:18:51] say i'm free the messages brought me out
[1:18:53] of slavery moses it brought me out of
[1:18:56] slavery but that's not it
[1:18:58] two million people went out of egypt
[1:19:00] with their children and they died in the
[1:19:02] wilderness and my children aren't gonna
[1:19:04] be that that group i'm not gonna be that
[1:19:07] group joshua and caleb
[1:19:09] and i'm going to stay true to them
[1:19:12] because there's a joshua and caleb
[1:19:13] anointing on the now right now either
[1:19:16] joshua anointing you have a balaam
[1:19:19] anointing you have a cora anointing to
[1:19:22] split to divide churches to make big
[1:19:25] things out of little things major
[1:19:27] doctrinal differences and it split a
[1:19:30] family is not of god
[1:19:32] amen help us god to get the message in
[1:19:35] its simplicity for
[1:19:37] this loves me

[1:20:22] so then i go upstairs i talk to three or
[1:20:24] four people they're telling me to go

[1:20:39] right to the walkway
[1:20:41] and a car pulls right up rolls his
[1:20:43] window down and says can i help you
[1:20:48] do you know what we talked about for
[1:20:50] three hours
[1:20:52] everything message
[1:20:54] proves and speaks about from genesis
[1:20:56] almost to revelations and guess what
[1:20:59] that brother did
[1:21:00] received it received it from pakistan
[1:21:03] originally received it if i can have
[1:21:05] never met a man and in five minutes be
[1:21:08] sharing him the gospel truth and he's
[1:21:09] saying hallelujah yes god i receive it
[1:21:12] he was working in freedom tell you right
[1:21:14] now he was a happy man and he had to
[1:21:17] drive me three hours one way and drive
[1:21:19] three hours back and i had to pay 380
[1:21:23] to get that taxi was the
[1:21:26] never paid amen
[1:21:29] i'll pay 380 if we see him one day
[1:21:32] reaching out and saying thank you
[1:21:33] brother tim i was baptized
[1:21:36] he might never come to my church might
[1:21:39] never see the message in its entirety
[1:21:41] but he saw the message
[1:21:43] in me
[1:21:45] because i am the quotes i don't have to
[1:21:47] say one quote of the prophet i don't
[1:21:49] have to his name one time because
[1:21:52] quotes i am the fulfillment of this
[1:21:54] malachi 4
[1:21:56] vindicated message is true
[1:21:58] it's turned my heart it's changed my
[1:22:00] family it's given me a wife that loves
[1:22:02] me that has never cut her hair
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:07] praise the lord that's what the message
[1:22:09] produces a wife that has a modest spirit
[1:22:12] and attitude a wife that loves you
[1:22:14] sticks by your side when you make
[1:22:15] mistakes that's because the message is
[1:22:18] real
[1:22:21] you might have been in the message
[1:22:24] and your father abused you
[1:22:26] i want to tell you
[1:22:28] that wasn't the message
[1:22:34] you
[1:22:35] my dad
[1:22:37] he gave me lots of
[1:22:39] it did not feel like love brother tim
[1:22:41] that's the message
[1:22:43] that's what the message produces no
[1:22:45] no
[1:22:47] your father
[1:22:49] i'm sorry to say this
[1:22:53] your father did not receive the baptism
[1:22:56] or the holy ghost in its entirety
[1:22:58] because the holy ghost would do it out
[1:22:59] of love
[1:23:01] every time
[1:23:03] this could help some young man or a
[1:23:05] young family that's screaming or here i
[1:23:08] want to tell you you can correct your
[1:23:10] children in such a way that they love it
[1:23:13] they're thankful
[1:23:15] that you told them they were wrong
[1:23:17] little girl right there you should be
[1:23:18] thankful when mommy or dad tell you no
[1:23:21] don't do that
[1:23:23] but what's happening pressure on a
[1:23:25] family today
[1:23:26] just let him do it
[1:23:28] just let him do it
[1:23:29] really
[1:23:30] just let him touch fire and burn their
[1:23:32] hand just let them touch a button on the
[1:23:35] internet and burn their hand no
[1:23:38] i'm not going to let that happen in the
[1:23:39] message
[1:23:40] so if you want to go into a
[1:23:41] denominational and go to your church
[1:23:44] idea and you like that kind of jesus
[1:23:46] because that's what it is your
[1:23:49] love your jesus and if you don't like
[1:23:52] that jesus and the baptist you'll go to
[1:23:53] the pentecostal then you'll go to this
[1:23:55] then you'll go to that and it always
[1:23:57] leads
[1:24:02] because you aren't happy with this
[1:24:03] religion you're not happy with that
[1:24:05] religion you're not happy with that
[1:24:06] religion and bound
[1:24:09] you're so bound up
[1:24:11] you just need to make one resolution if
[1:24:13] you've heard anything negative about
[1:24:15] william branham you need and you're
[1:24:16] listening on the internet too if you've
[1:24:18] heard anything negative i want you
[1:24:20] just right now to forget what you've
[1:24:22] heard
[1:24:23] i want you to think about who told you
[1:24:26] that
[1:24:27] that seed of discrepancy that was put in
[1:24:29] your mind and what is
[1:24:31] seen now
[1:24:35] that's a good word
[1:24:36] that's a good word because it's not
[1:24:38] bringing freedom i'll tell you that
[1:24:40] in my personal family it's splitting
[1:24:43] homes in my personal family
[1:24:45] this doubt this unbelief
[1:24:48] and we know yourself through scripture
[1:24:50] that it will be in family
[1:24:52] and it will be people in the message
[1:24:54] that will persecute you why
[1:24:56] because it's in scripture
[1:24:58] so praise the lord i find myself in the
[1:25:00] word i'm identified in the word
[1:25:04] who believes brother branham can find
[1:25:05] himself in scripture
[1:25:07] i wasn't going to say this but i'm going
[1:25:08] to say it
[1:25:10] brother branham was in scripture
[1:25:12] i want you to do i'm going to just find
[1:25:14] this real quick
[1:25:16] i want you to say amen if you believe
[1:25:18] not not if you might believe or you're
[1:25:21] wondering when you say amen if you only
[1:25:24] believe what i'm going to say
[1:25:27] brother branham was malachi 4 5
[1:25:30] fulfilling scripture
[1:25:34] brother branham was the fulfillment of
[1:25:36] amos 3
[1:25:38] half of us believe that
[1:25:42] that's how it is in church though
[1:25:44] you preach a wonderful service dancing
[1:25:46] in the spirit and two people their life
[1:25:48] will be changed i know what i'm talking
[1:25:50] about
[1:25:51] help us god that if there's only one i
[1:25:54] want to be at the altar i'm the pastor
[1:25:56] church deacon and i need jesus i'm the
[1:25:58] first one at the altar because my
[1:26:00] prophet had humility enough one time
[1:26:03] just
[1:26:04] congregation and i need jesus and that
[1:26:07] kind of man is the man i'll follow a man
[1:26:09] that when he's given a million dollars
[1:26:11] he says no
[1:26:12] i don't need your money
[1:26:14] because all that money is trying to make
[1:26:16] you do is compromise the word of god
[1:26:18] never accept money with strings attached
[1:26:22] never go to a church that has politics
[1:26:24] have a pastor that hates politics that
[1:26:27] will not allow politics in the church
[1:26:32] but what has happened in the message oh
[1:26:34] we got the group that likes masks and
[1:26:36] the church that doesn't
[1:26:39] it's i know what's going on right in
[1:26:40] this area
[1:26:43] i'm sniffing it out as brother codrick
[1:26:45] diggs would say i'm the great hound dog
[1:26:48] sniffing out things that are going on in
[1:26:50] this area because it's going on in our
[1:26:51] area too in washington state
[1:26:55] same devil
[1:26:57] arizona jeffersonville indiana the same
[1:26:59] devil
[1:27:00] same spirit
[1:27:03] devil's everywhere trying to attack the
[1:27:05] elect bride
[1:27:07] and i'm not going to be deceived
[1:27:09] i don't care if my family don't go i'm
[1:27:11] going if ruth i will be the ruth my
[1:27:14] family leaves me but i'm going to see
[1:27:16] boaz how many want to see jesus we're
[1:27:19] coming down to the end now you know
[1:27:21] brother branham where he was in
[1:27:22] scripture he was eliezer
[1:27:26] he was
[1:27:28] hallelujah
[1:27:29] we know where brother branham was
[1:27:31] revelation 10 7. that's wonderful
[1:27:34] it was revelation 10 7.2 revelation 10
[1:27:38] 1.
[1:27:39] and you probably heard a quote about
[1:27:40] building a platform
[1:27:44] and brother brandon built a platform for
[1:27:46] one man
[1:27:48] who was that man
[1:27:50] come on those of you that have a
[1:27:51] revelation of who that man was
[1:27:53] jesus
[1:27:54] not j
[1:27:56] even though it starts with a j
[1:28:00] eddie biskell not my bad brother john
[1:28:02] andes not brother tim pruitt not build a
[1:28:04] platform for
[1:28:06] jelly i don't even know his first name
[1:28:08] not brother gibbs whoever he is bless
[1:28:10] his heart but you are not the eighth
[1:28:12] messenger
[1:28:14] there is no eighth messenger that goes
[1:28:17] against the bible you antichrist
[1:28:20] that is the truth
[1:28:22] any messenger that comes and says i have
[1:28:24] a special gift of interpretation of this
[1:28:26] scripture is a false prophet doesn't
[1:28:28] matter if he's in the message doesn't
[1:28:31] matter if he's my friend my family
[1:28:32] member my grandpa
[1:28:36] that's when it comes down to the line i
[1:28:38] know that jesus is my savior i need to
[1:28:40] know that what i believe is the truth
[1:28:42] and it's bringing a freedom in my family
[1:28:46] the devil is attacking the message to
[1:28:48] doubt where brother branham was but it's
[1:28:50] also causing us to not recognize who we
[1:28:53] are
[1:28:55] do you know where you are in the
[1:28:56] scripture
[1:28:59] do you
[1:29:02] we need to find our type in scripture
[1:29:04] we need to find ourselves in scripture
[1:29:07] i haven't barely looked in my notes my
[1:29:11] who wants liberty to this evening for
[1:29:12] their family
[1:29:14] if you're if you're a husband or a wife
[1:29:16] you're going to have to receive
[1:29:17] something different than your neighbor
[1:29:21] then the teacher your kids might have to
[1:29:23] go to school with
[1:29:24] because if they see jesus more in their
[1:29:26] teacher
[1:29:28] and she's got blue hair and makeup
[1:29:30] she's a kind loving person
[1:29:33] eating dad or beating mom no wonder they
[1:29:36] don't want what you got
[1:29:40] the serpent slicky serpent came into eve
[1:29:43] right at the beginning and that same
[1:29:45] type is happening today in our schools
[1:29:47] in washington state sex education is
[1:29:50] mandatory taught from kindergarten to
[1:29:52] grade 12. that is prophecy being
[1:29:54] fulfilled i'm not going to say oh the
[1:29:56] school's so terrible i know it is i'm
[1:29:59] not sure and i'm saying publicly you
[1:30:01] shouldn't have your children education
[1:30:03] that is causing them to doubt the bible
[1:30:10] helpless god
[1:30:12] but we either have to do two things one
[1:30:14] we need to homeschool our kids or we
[1:30:16] need to have a christian environment for
[1:30:18] kids in our community that they can get
[1:30:20] together
[1:30:21] that's my vision
[1:30:22] my child is four years old next year he
[1:30:24] will be five years old i need to find an
[1:30:26] educational system if i have to do it
[1:30:28] myself i'll pour all my efforts into it
[1:30:30] because his soul is worth ten thousand
[1:30:33] worlds and i'm not playing games with my
[1:30:35] son's soul i'm not playing games with
[1:30:37] liberty or boaz's soul their souls are
[1:30:40] worth just as much as mine
[1:30:43] so i'll pour all my money i'll take a
[1:30:44] loan out on my house i'll take a loan
[1:30:46] out on my business praise god for my
[1:30:49] children's sake
[1:30:52] i won't let them go around jezebel's
[1:30:56] i think they can come in with their
[1:30:57] little cut makeup on their fingers and a
[1:31:00] pants and say ooh oh we're just friends
[1:31:02] you're a jezebel
[1:31:04] and you let our children play with it
[1:31:06] before you know it brother hugging each
[1:31:08] other they're kissing each other grade
[1:31:10] twos i'm a witness i was a teacher okay
[1:31:13] public school system i had to do a
[1:31:15] year-long internship and i saw it happen
[1:31:17] right in front of me
[1:31:18] unashamed
[1:31:22] girl
[1:31:24] that's the kind of school you want to
[1:31:25] say to
[1:31:26] no
[1:31:28] i wouldn't do it
[1:31:30] if my wife has to stay home and
[1:31:32] homeschool praise the lord i'll do what
[1:31:34] the prophet said my wife is a maker at
[1:31:36] home she's the pastor of the home
[1:31:38] she has a pastorship and her pulpit is
[1:31:41] her sink that she washes dishes over
[1:31:44] that she serves her
[1:31:46] her ministry
[1:31:48] but see a sister wants lots of money i
[1:31:51] gotta make six digits and have a career
[1:31:54] tell you something the prophet of god
[1:31:56] said jesus christ is number one and
[1:31:58] after that is a godly mate
[1:32:00] every single person once they receive
[1:32:02] the holy ghost and jesus christ in them
[1:32:04] and have a relationship with him they
[1:32:07] should be seeking not like desperation
[1:32:09] but they should be seeking the next
[1:32:11] thing to salvation and it's not money
[1:32:15] it's not a career
[1:32:17] i know this is really backwards and this
[1:32:19] is 20th
[1:32:20] 19th century
[1:32:22] but it is thus saith the lord
[1:32:24] it's saith the lord and i said that i
[1:32:27] said saith the lord and if you follow it
[1:32:29] thus saith the lord said only and i know
[1:32:32] said thus saith the lord
[1:32:34] you won't find these critics saying thus
[1:32:36] saith the lord
[1:32:39] no sir because they have zero
[1:32:40] vindication
[1:32:43] all they can do is
[1:32:47] they are fulfilling their scripture
[1:32:50] brother
[1:32:52] the skeptics are for theirs and what are
[1:32:54] we
[1:32:56] what you do now is what you would have
[1:32:58] done back then
[1:33:00] so are you job or are you job's wife
[1:33:04] who are you
[1:33:06] job how many identify with job i can
[1:33:09] take all my lands god you can take my
[1:33:11] house you can have my kids die
[1:33:15] premature deaths
[1:33:17] wonder if god is real that is brother
[1:33:18] tim who's looking for looking at him
[1:33:20] right now that's what happened i stress
[1:33:23] in my life who's had stress in their
[1:33:24] life financial strategy
[1:33:27] no money in the bank had to get a loan
[1:33:28] from my brother i've had it
[1:33:30] that's humbling
[1:33:32] stress to the point where you're so
[1:33:34] exhausted you don't know what how you
[1:33:36] can sleep it's the devil
[1:33:38] he tried to bind me but i've been set
[1:33:40] free
[1:33:42] the devil gonna tell me and remind me of
[1:33:44] my past because i've been justified i've
[1:33:46] been sanctified and now i'm filled with
[1:33:48] the holy ghost will those things come up
[1:33:51] brother oh yeah
[1:33:52] the devil's a good mastermind
[1:33:54] you did that a year ago it's the same
[1:33:59] that's not the spirit of god reminding
[1:34:01] you of your past not one bit
[1:34:04] god doesn't remind you of your past he
[1:34:06] shows you what your future is brother
[1:34:08] timothy and your future is clear your
[1:34:10] future if you have jesus christ the
[1:34:13] token life over you you will be saved
[1:34:16] how can i say that that is thus saith
[1:34:17] the lord because the bible says they
[1:34:20] that receive it that have the toe
[1:34:23] this is day
[1:34:25] a child didn't die you don't want your
[1:34:27] children to die in laodicea you the
[1:34:29] token
[1:34:31] that's a message you're listening to
[1:34:32] what message are you putting over your
[1:34:34] children
[1:34:35] tv is okay
[1:34:38] no sir science will tell you scientist
[1:34:41] psychologists will tell you that tv is
[1:34:43] killing their brain cells
[1:34:44] but they still do it
[1:34:46] science will tell you that smoking is
[1:34:48] your brain and your lungs true but
[1:34:50] people still do it
[1:34:53] science will tell you pornography will
[1:34:54] destroy your marriage and will take you
[1:34:57] further than you want to go
[1:34:59] people still do it
[1:35:01] say they're free
[1:35:03] in the flesh
[1:35:06] i don't want to be free in the flesh i
[1:35:08] want to be free in the spirit
[1:35:10] where the spirit of god can move in my
[1:35:12] family where we have family altar in the
[1:35:14] mornings instead of daddy running at
[1:35:16] five in the morning it's time to change
[1:35:18] your schedule
[1:35:20] it's time to go to your boston and you
[1:35:22] you have the leverage by the way in this
[1:35:23] economy because they need you
[1:35:27] go to your boss and say you know what
[1:35:29] my family my kids my wife are suffering
[1:35:31] you're having me work 15 hour days this
[1:35:33] is not of god i'm going to quit
[1:35:36] and you know what they're going to do
[1:35:37] they're going to say oh no no no what do
[1:35:39] we need to do we'll cut back your hours
[1:35:41] and we'll pay you more money
[1:35:44] hallelujah
[1:35:45] i can give more to the church i can give
[1:35:47] more suffering i can get out of debt
[1:35:52] debt is bondage not liberty debt bring
[1:35:55] people bound and causes divorce the
[1:35:58] number one reason why people leave
[1:35:59] churches while number one why people
[1:36:01] have splits in their marriage is money
[1:36:04] the number one reason
[1:36:07] but money can be one of the greatest
[1:36:08] pools in god's hands
[1:36:11] money can be used
[1:36:13] the right gift could go like this and go
[1:36:15] like this god gives and i give back god
[1:36:18] gives and i give back
[1:36:21] but we got two three million dollar
[1:36:23] churches today in the message
[1:36:27] this is their hands
[1:36:29] we only give to people except what we
[1:36:31] want them to do
[1:36:34] denomination
[1:36:37] you are a denomination because you're
[1:36:39] acting like it you're talking
[1:36:41] you are a denomination and you say
[1:36:44] brother branham is a prophet
[1:36:46] this message
[1:36:52] we will not turn into the method of the
[1:36:54] dale we don't want that
[1:36:57] who wants a formal church
[1:36:59] go have it
[1:37:02] here that doesn't believe in clapping
[1:37:04] doesn't believe in drums
[1:37:08] they don't believe in the holy ghost
[1:37:09] move
[1:37:12] and the whole move when i say that i
[1:37:13] don't mean shouting all the time
[1:37:15] because sometimes there needs to be real
[1:37:17] teaching
[1:37:18] right brother jared sometimes we need a
[1:37:21] whole service on family situations
[1:37:23] sometimes we need to take a whole
[1:37:24] service yes i'm gonna a whole service on
[1:37:26] how to spend money
[1:37:29] it's in the bible
[1:37:31] and i'm gonna say it i don't have it
[1:37:32] here but some of us need to do a plat
[1:37:36] credit card
[1:37:38] causing you to be bondage
[1:37:42] you want real freedom in the holy ghost
[1:37:44] cut up your credit card that's a natural
[1:37:46] thing but you need to cut up the credit
[1:37:48] card
[1:37:49] because you're missing church you on the
[1:37:50] internet because you have credit card
[1:37:52] debt and lines of credit
[1:37:54] and tons of it has matched you out to
[1:37:57] where you need two and three jobs i'm
[1:37:58] here to tell you something that maybe
[1:38:00] blow your mind you need two and three
[1:38:02] jobs

[1:38:24] 70 right brother dale so you see grandpa
[1:38:26] and he's got the nice truck and the big
[1:38:29] farm in the big house and guess what a
[1:38:31] spirit comes in pastor the pastor has a
[1:38:34] big church he has a big house he's got
[1:38:37] lots of money
[1:38:39] praise the lord
[1:38:41] he's doing good for the kingdom of god
[1:38:44] we're destroying lies right now
[1:38:48] misconceptions in the message that money
[1:38:51] is a taboo subject
[1:38:59] cause giving to go up without asking for
[1:39:01] money because but the dale never told me
[1:39:04] to say this you only need 20 30 people
[1:39:06] that are real givers in a church to pay
[1:39:08] your pastor enough so
[1:39:12] givers
[1:39:15] oh no they're tim
[1:39:16] i
[1:39:18] cannot afford not to pay your guys
[1:39:20] that's by
[1:39:27] hey
[1:39:29] not pay off your debt
[1:39:31] back pay god you've robbed him no wonder
[1:39:33] you're in debt
[1:39:35] you say brother tim i've had a doctor
[1:39:37] problem i've i'm sorry if i'm going
[1:39:38] along brother dale i think we're doing
[1:39:40] some surgery here i think everyone's
[1:39:41] enjoying the service if you don't and
[1:39:43] you you're welcome to leave okay the
[1:39:45] door is back there
[1:39:49] some people say oh you pre too long
[1:39:51] brother tim well if if what i'm saying
[1:39:53] is helping someone i'm going to keep
[1:39:55] going
[1:39:57] because if i just keep going but they're
[1:39:58] felix and you're how old were the felix
[1:40:01] nine how they're
[1:40:03] you guys are all awake
[1:40:06] you're seven brother and you're awake
[1:40:08] and you're a little girl and you're
[1:40:09] listening how much did the adults be on
[1:40:11] the edge of their seat when we come to
[1:40:13] church in prayer
[1:40:15] and the kids are gonna come i'm gonna
[1:40:17] pray right now you have your kids
[1:40:19] sitting on the front row instead of
[1:40:20] sleeping in the back pew
[1:40:24] i've seen it happen
[1:40:25] when i was a sunday school teacher i
[1:40:27] told my kid i told the young boys i said
[1:40:29] that why aren't you sitting in the throw
[1:40:30] i said it one time
[1:40:32] because a child desires to please an
[1:40:34] adult get what happened the next service
[1:40:36] brother jared the front row was lined up
[1:40:38] with boys
[1:40:41] wouldn't i rather my kids in the front
[1:40:43] row see than sleeping in the pew at 10
[1:40:46] 11 years old
[1:40:48] and if our preaching brother dale is
[1:40:50] getting so boring so formal that our
[1:40:52] kids are falling asleep
[1:40:55] we're not preaching the truth because
[1:40:57] the truth brings liberty it brings
[1:40:59] freedom it comes up where people stand
[1:41:01] up doubt hallelujah i'm free
[1:41:04] i don't need debt i don't know the
[1:41:06] devil's
[1:41:10] i don't need to go and believe this sign
[1:41:11] because believe the sign does not
[1:41:13] believe the sign they're hypocrites they
[1:41:16] have a google that's
[1:41:19] and they will never change that logo you
[1:41:21] know why
[1:41:22] because the pillar of fire is on that
[1:41:24] logo and as long as they have the pillar
[1:41:25] of fire on that logo
[1:41:28] that's the only base of ministry they
[1:41:31] think about it
[1:41:33] take away everything on your site that's
[1:41:35] about brother branham
[1:41:37] they have nothing to talk about
[1:41:40] so why would we focus on a ministry of
[1:41:42] pulling down anyone now i'm going to
[1:41:44] talk
[1:41:45] why would we preach against george
[1:41:46] mueller
[1:41:47] john wesley
[1:41:49] martin
[1:41:51] i'm taking i'm talking now why would we
[1:41:54] even though we don't agree everything
[1:41:56] because we're christians
[1:41:59] christians means to be like christ
[1:42:04] so every person that's tearing down
[1:42:06] william branham's name is not a
[1:42:08] christian
[1:42:12] saying in simplicity
[1:42:14] out of love i love the people i have
[1:42:16] family that believe this garbage
[1:42:18] recycled garbage
[1:42:20] it's copy pasted every three months the
[1:42:22] same posts
[1:42:24] because they have nothing new under the
[1:42:26] sun they have new no new revelation all
[1:42:29] they've got is their 120 things and will
[1:42:31] bombarding your mind the same garbage
[1:42:35] recycling
[1:42:36] you know what brother dave this message
[1:42:38] is not recycled by minister this message
[1:42:40] is alive
[1:42:42] the true five full ministry are living
[1:42:44] proof
[1:42:45] living proof that the message is true
[1:42:47] can i get an amen
[1:42:49] you are living proof brother sister
[1:42:51] trust
[1:42:52] don't go against their
[1:42:54] is that support pastor 100
[1:43:00] belief
[1:43:01] and any person that wants to doubt the
[1:43:02] pastor wants out what he's doing with
[1:43:05] the money you have every right to go to
[1:43:06] him there's scripture
[1:43:08] there's a scriptural bible way to do
[1:43:11] this you go to the person you talk to
[1:43:13] them they don't listen you take a deacon
[1:43:15] or another minister
[1:43:16] let me ask you this how many times it
[1:43:18] happened in your lifetime
[1:43:22] probably less than five times has anyone
[1:43:23] ever had that happened where it's gone
[1:43:24] through the whole time
[1:43:26] but we've had a lot of people leave our
[1:43:28] churches
[1:43:29] we didn't go the bible way we can say
[1:43:31] we're buying living by the bible we can
[1:43:34] say we believe a message but times we
[1:43:36] fulfilled the word in our churches in
[1:43:38] the last 50 years the prophet died

[1:44:34] you if it's darkness or light
[1:44:36] eighty percent of things you don't know
[1:44:38] if they're right or wrong

[1:44:46] no skirt on and were wearing the
[1:44:48] tightest pants ever

[1:45:03] branham no
[1:45:06] it wasn't brother branham's message
[1:45:09] brother branham's just a man like i am
[1:45:15] that's not putting him down that's
[1:45:17] lifting him up because he's just like me
[1:45:19] he says in his word i have to die out to

[1:45:44] but i'm still in the message i can wear
[1:45:47] those eyelashes that come way out

[1:45:50] make me beautiful if you're doing that
[1:45:53] sister and that's really attracting your
[1:45:55] husband

[1:47:17] i'm sorry if it's stepping on my nose
[1:47:18] i'm stepping on my wife's toes

[1:47:22] and she might be listening but i'm sorry
[1:47:24] you can sit down
[1:47:27] i'm sorry that might sound a little
[1:47:29] legalist for her that message
[1:47:32] oh you're legalistic
[1:47:36] well if my legal bringing me closer to
[1:47:38] this
[1:47:39] call me a legalist every day
[1:47:42] if i'm a legalist
[1:47:44] and my wife loves me how does that work
[1:47:48] i'm a legalist
[1:47:50] if you're legal
[1:47:52] you're always like documenting
[1:47:54] everything you know my wife she did this
[1:47:56] today to me
[1:47:58] and i'm gonna get her back
[1:48:00] legalists right
[1:48:03] oh let's go a little further brother
[1:48:05] branham did this in his life he was
[1:48:06] wrong you're a legalist
[1:48:10] you've made the legalist doc
[1:48:13] of all the things brother branham did
[1:48:15] wrong in his life
[1:48:22] yeah i can bring a lot of dirt out you
[1:48:24] too brother sister on the internet
[1:48:26] have the holy ghost and the holy ghost
[1:48:27] says i love you enemy
[1:48:30] i love them that spit on me that curse
[1:48:32] me
[1:48:33] that say the message isn't true i love
[1:48:35] you
[1:48:36] that's why i'm preaching the way i am do
[1:48:38] you realize what you believe is a lie
[1:48:40] it's bringing you bondage not freedom
[1:48:45] it needs to be said in our churches the
[1:48:47] message is liberty freedom and it's
[1:48:49] yours
[1:48:52] let me just tell you right now the only
[1:48:54] thing that will keep a marriage is jesus
[1:48:55] christ the only thing that will keep a
[1:48:57] marriage is in prayer together before
[1:49:00] you go to bed
[1:49:02] that's the only thing
[1:49:04] as soon as you take the message which is
[1:49:05] christ out of your life divorce will
[1:49:08] happen
[1:49:10] and they might even stay after they
[1:49:11] leave the message right which is christ
[1:49:13] i'm not when i say the mess i mean
[1:49:14] brother branham's message i mean they
[1:49:16] mean they left christ
[1:49:19] believe that what to
[1:49:23] live in separate life
[1:49:25] they now have no foundation
[1:49:27] because their foundation and what they
[1:49:29] believed is no longer the same
[1:49:31] because now they've created free
[1:49:33] thinkers
[1:49:35] and brother ernie villanueva who has
[1:49:36] gone on to be with the lord was a mighty
[1:49:38] man of god
[1:49:39] he said something very why would i open
[1:49:42] my mind and
[1:49:44] anchor and be open-minded who's heard
[1:49:46] that
[1:49:47] and let garbage come into my open mind
[1:49:50] you know what i'm not gonna have an open
[1:49:52] mind i'm gonna have a closed mind thank
[1:49:55] you very much and i'm going to be closed
[1:49:57] and
[1:49:58] heard
[1:50:02] what's your cloak
[1:50:04] what are you wearing
[1:50:06] a sister is wearing long hair because
[1:50:08] she has a revelation that god said in
[1:50:11] his word to have long hair is a good
[1:50:12] thing it's a covering for you it does
[1:50:15] not bring shame to have long hair it
[1:50:17] does not bring shame if your husband
[1:50:19] don't wear makeup it's actually a love
[1:50:22] because a husband right now could turn
[1:50:23] to his wife and say you don't have to
[1:50:24] wear makeup to be beautiful i'll tell my
[1:50:26] wife right now she knows this she
[1:50:28] doesn't have to wear makeup to make me
[1:50:29] beautiful you can turn to your wife
[1:50:30] right now you don't have to wife
[1:50:32] you don't have to because i never was
[1:50:34] attracted to you
[1:50:36] i was attracted because of your
[1:50:38] character
[1:50:39] hey man that's what the message produces
[1:50:41] character
[1:50:43] character enough to love your brother as
[1:50:45] yourself love your enemy as yourself
[1:50:48] who are you
[1:50:50] you are mary
[1:50:53] who believes that they're mary
[1:50:55] can they say i am mary
[1:50:58] i am rebecca
[1:51:00] that came to my bridegroom
[1:51:03] who many believe that they're rebecca
[1:51:07] if we say they're the bride of christ we
[1:51:09] must identify with the female part as we
[1:51:11] come to a close this is going to bring
[1:51:13] you liberty right now
[1:51:15] you say i am mary i am rebecca
[1:51:20] i am
[1:51:22] in scripture today
[1:51:25] brother branham knew who he was
[1:51:29] i'm rebecca i am ruth
[1:51:35] and i am ruth
[1:51:37] sounds weird doesn't it sounds like you
[1:51:38] don't know what gender you are well i'm
[1:51:40] here to say no we just found our type in
[1:51:42] scripture we are the female part that
[1:51:45] came out of adam we are the christ part
[1:51:48] that's coming out
[1:51:50] we are part of god
[1:51:52] people will not like you when you're
[1:51:54] part of god
[1:51:57] this is good preaching
[1:51:59] you're either gonna hate this love this
[1:52:02] or leave this
[1:52:06] hate it love it or leave it
[1:52:08] that's up to you
[1:52:10] your soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[1:52:12] though
[1:52:14] so you are in scripture saints let's
[1:52:16] have liberty let's have a freedom and
[1:52:18] let's turn to our bibles
[1:52:20] scripture amen
[1:52:22] man 740 are you kidding me brother
[1:52:24] brother brother you need to just yank
[1:52:26] the chain i think it's time to go
[1:52:28] we still got tomorrow
[1:52:30] whether tim's got a lot of energy
[1:52:33] praise god
[1:52:35] brother tim's not done fighting
[1:52:37] but i know if i in my sleep tonight i've
[1:52:39] done all i could do
[1:52:41] i punched up tonight it's been recorded
[1:52:44] so if i die tonight you can send it
[1:52:47] around the world i believe a message i
[1:52:50] believe a message by william branham
[1:52:51] he's dead but the god
[1:52:54] and you know where he's living he's
[1:52:56] living me
[1:52:57] you can crucify me take me to jail
[1:52:59] i'll still serve him
[1:53:02] not serve brother branham no sir
[1:53:05] serve the god of william branham the god
[1:53:12] and it's not another jesus
[1:53:14] it's not another jesus
[1:53:17] no sir deuteronomy 30 verse 15.
[1:53:23] i feel the devil is getting his head cut
[1:53:25] off
[1:53:26] and we're not running around we're
[1:53:28] running around
[1:53:30] room
[1:53:32] but at the end of the service we're
[1:53:33] going to do something a little bit
[1:53:34] different
[1:53:35] we're not going to have an altar call
[1:53:38] we're going to lay our hands on one
[1:53:39] another
[1:53:42] pray for one another because the family
[1:53:44] that prays stays
[1:53:46] the church that prays stays
[1:53:48] and you might not even i don't even know
[1:53:50] you sister someone in the church no one
[1:53:51] knows that sister or a visitor that will
[1:53:53] come tomorrow we might not know them but
[1:53:56] we can pray for them just like that
[1:53:57] brother said we can pray for our brother
[1:54:00] and they can wear makeup they can come
[1:54:01] in here with long hair smell like
[1:54:03] cigarette they can smoke
[1:54:04] like i had a friend and blow it right in
[1:54:06] my face and i still love him
[1:54:10] and i just told him one day you'll hate
[1:54:12] those
[1:54:14] and he was blowing it right in my face
[1:54:18] deuteronomy
[1:54:19] 15. is that what i said are 30
[1:54:22] 30 verse 15
[1:54:25] see let's start with 14 the word is very
[1:54:28] nigh unto thee in thy
[1:54:31] mouth and in thy
[1:54:34] saints of god we need to speak the word
[1:54:36] we need to believe the word in our heart
[1:54:45] your heart will change
[1:54:47] and when your heart changes towards your
[1:54:49] husband and you don't think he's you but
[1:54:51] you know he loves you
[1:54:52] guess what it doesn't matter what he
[1:54:54] says you know he's got your back
[1:54:57] i have workers
[1:54:59] at my workplace that work for me
[1:55:01] he might even stream the service i don't
[1:55:03] know
[1:55:05] his whole motto is tim whenever you're
[1:55:07] gone i've got your back
[1:55:10] if a worldly guy
[1:55:12] doesn't even know me from adam six
[1:55:14] months ago we hadn't ever met
[1:55:16] i'm gonna say something right now if you
[1:55:17] looked at his facebook page when i hired
[1:55:20] him you would have not hired him
[1:55:22] goals
[1:55:23] it looked terrible on the outside it
[1:55:25] looked terrible when i had him come for
[1:55:27] the interview
[1:55:28] i would wait brother dale
[1:55:31] but now that same man is in a management
[1:55:33] position at my company
[1:55:35] making the most money he's ever made
[1:55:38] barely smokes anymore
[1:55:41] attitude has completely changed in six
[1:55:44] months because he's in a workplace
[1:55:46] that shows that they care for him
[1:55:50] if you have a business
[1:55:51] pay your people more money
[1:55:55] that kills it kills any doubt that they
[1:55:58] don't love because you say i care about
[1:56:00] you in my company but if you're not
[1:56:02] giving them more money and you're saying
[1:56:04] oh no inflation was seven percent i
[1:56:06] understand but we're keeping your salary
[1:56:08] the same you've literally told they're
[1:56:10] not they're worthless to you
[1:56:13] i'm sorry if this is too natural and
[1:56:14] carnal but this is right down we're
[1:56:16] living if you have a business you need
[1:56:18] to pay your employees more
[1:56:22] you say brother tim no
[1:56:24] yes you will lose one profit but
[1:56:26] actually no you'll gain profits
[1:56:29] you know why
[1:56:30] because you show that they care
[1:56:32] they'll work when i'm not here and i'm
[1:56:34] preaching today they worked
[1:56:37] for me
[1:56:38] and them
[1:56:40] see how god works and
[1:56:43] when i prophesy again when you show
[1:56:45] people that you care for them and you
[1:56:46] love them
[1:56:48] and you show it you don't say that
[1:56:51] you you show it by action then guess
[1:56:54] what they cannot deny the jesus you
[1:56:56] serve
[1:56:58] they can't deny that brother branham was
[1:57:00] a man of god one bit because you are
[1:57:03] living what he said
[1:57:05] humble
[1:57:07] that's what we need in our church i'm
[1:57:09] prophesying that if we treat people
[1:57:11] right they'll want what we got
[1:57:13] that's what a prophet said
[1:57:16] live a life
[1:57:17] now i have a choice
[1:57:18] right here
[1:57:20] before you
[1:57:22] everyone i have given you a choice today
[1:57:26] this day life
[1:57:28] and good
[1:57:29] or death and evil
[1:57:32] brother felix your dad is making a
[1:57:34] choice right now to do what's right and
[1:57:36] good
[1:57:37] guess what brother felix
[1:57:39] what's your name again
[1:57:40] brother elliot same as the middle name
[1:57:42] of boaz that's right
[1:57:44] brother elliot your dad and mom have
[1:57:46] made a choice good in life and they're
[1:57:48] gonna try and train you in that way
[1:57:49] right but one day brother elliott have
[1:57:51] to make choice
[1:57:54] or
[1:57:55] death and evil
[1:57:58] and if i show my child life and good and
[1:58:00] being a christian can be fun
[1:58:04] what sorry
[1:58:07] you can be a christian and have fun
[1:58:09] you can play baseball and it's not a sin
[1:58:11] to play baseball
[1:58:13] what
[1:58:15] you can clap hands in church
[1:58:18] what when i know churches in the message
[1:58:22] that think it's wrong to clap
[1:58:24] are you kidding me the lord and give him
[1:58:27] a hand class let's deny
[1:58:29] lift up our hands into gravity
[1:58:34] let's choose a living church not a dead
[1:58:37] church where the pastor has fully
[1:58:39] to walk around and run around the deacon
[1:58:42] in the bat he can praise god
[1:58:45] my dad just elected a deacon in the
[1:58:46] church out of his church home church
[1:58:49] is not
[1:58:51] amen he said hallelujah he claps his
[1:58:54] hand and he even gets excited praise god
[1:58:57] that's the kind of deacons we want not
[1:58:58] the deacon in the back oh brother said
[1:59:01] i'm a policeman
[1:59:02] so i've got my gun
[1:59:04] my quotes i ran one time in the church
[1:59:08] you're not allowed to come in the church
[1:59:09] legalism no wonder they think we're
[1:59:11] legalists
[1:59:13] i'm gonna say
[1:59:14] the deacon comes to you you're being too
[1:59:17] loud in the church
[1:59:20] i've had it
[1:59:22] i've had it
[1:59:23] yeah don't laugh it's true
[1:59:26] whoo
[1:59:28] loud in the church
[1:59:30] i'm going to give a real tip and i hope
[1:59:32] the old things don't misunderstand
[1:59:34] if you need to turn down your hearing
[1:59:36] aid so that others can praise god just
[1:59:38] do it
[1:59:41] let them be free
[1:59:43] because
[1:59:44] you combined younger ones and i'm doing
[1:59:46] this out of you i hope you understand
[1:59:48] i'm doing this out of respect but older
[1:59:50] ones can
[1:59:51] children and say why did you clap in
[1:59:52] church why are you willing to sit in the
[1:59:54] front row that's weird
[1:59:56] praise brother branham preached a
[1:59:58] message for that i'm an oddball elliot
[2:00:00] [Applause]
[2:00:02] i'm different than the world
[2:00:04] so your dad's different little girl
[2:00:07] he's got jesus in him
[2:00:10] and if jesus is in him then our children
[2:00:13] will want jesus
[2:00:15] my titus boy
[2:00:17] will be a titus in the bible because i'm
[2:00:20] true to the prophet's message
[2:00:23] paul
[2:00:25] is the same type for my family i found
[2:00:27] myself in scripture
[2:00:29] my son i mean my dad called me timothy
[2:00:31] in the bible because i'm gonna follow
[2:00:33] the message that's finished then i made
[2:00:35] my first son titus because he will stay
[2:00:38] in that message by the grace of god
[2:00:41] will the devil attack your family yes he
[2:00:43] will but by the grace of god the tokens
[2:00:45] apply i'll quit my job i'll take out
[2:00:47] loans if i have to go on vacation cause
[2:00:50] i gotta show my kids i love them
[2:00:55] and we'll send thousands of dollars
[2:00:57] overseas but are
[2:00:59] have a fun night
[2:01:01] you can't take your wife out on a five
[2:01:03] dollar coffee date
[2:01:05] shame on you
[2:01:07] i do it every week almost
[2:01:10] take my wife out for a coffee take our
[2:01:12] meal once a month it's in the budget
[2:01:14] though
[2:01:17] better start you better start making
[2:01:19] your roi investment and believe me a
[2:01:21] five dollar coffee will go a long way
[2:01:26] but people are caught up in their
[2:01:27] business profits work seven days a week
[2:01:29] out of their mind and they'll lose their
[2:01:31] wife you want me to give you some
[2:01:32] examples who's ready jeff
[2:01:34] bezos bill gates
[2:01:37] richest man in the world and what do
[2:01:38] they both have in common right now
[2:01:40] they don't have a spouse
[2:01:45] jeff bezos is amazon
[2:01:48] well known who knows who jeff bezos and
[2:01:50] amazon is everyone knows who amazon is
[2:01:52] right
[2:01:53] everyone knows apple and steve jobs was
[2:01:56] did you know steve jobs who was the
[2:01:58] creator of apple was also very atheistic
[2:02:01] in his belief he leaned on science
[2:02:05] so then i gotta wonder if i'm gonna have
[2:02:06] an apple computer
[2:02:08] i'd have full subject to the word of god
[2:02:11] and not let that thing become a trap in
[2:02:13] my face
[2:02:15] i'm not saying the internet is bad i'm
[2:02:17] not saying facebook is bad because
[2:02:20] young people
[2:02:25] and guess what i'm gonna say it publicly
[2:02:30] preached against something
[2:02:32] you watch 90
[2:02:34] of young people
[2:02:35] it's in them to do that that they said
[2:02:38] not to do
[2:02:40] so i'm a piece of counsel and i hope it
[2:02:41] helps some young parents okay
[2:02:45] when a child is doing wrong do not
[2:02:49] focus
[2:02:50] on the bad behavior
[2:02:52] focus on the good thing they just did
[2:02:54] if you if you told
[2:03:00] will stop doing it automatically this is
[2:03:02] crazy this might sound crazy to you but
[2:03:04] if your child hey how you doing you're
[2:03:05] listening so good
[2:03:08] do the rest of the service and when
[2:03:09] daddy tells her that at the end they go
[2:03:11] out for an ice cream
[2:03:13] this is the gospel on
[2:03:15] the gospel
[2:03:16] and you go to dairy queen eat it brother
[2:03:18] for twenty dollars you take your wife
[2:03:20] out cause she wants a drink
[2:03:22] that's the gospel
[2:03:26] for money because oh we're barely able
[2:03:28] to make it well you got yourself in
[2:03:32] come on look in the mirror
[2:03:34] you are the problem
[2:03:37] you the problem
[2:03:39] get right
[2:03:40] get going the bible way sell all your
[2:03:43] cars
[2:03:44] that you have debts on
[2:03:46] or get out of debt
[2:03:48] stop going on vacations for
[2:03:51] use that vacation to get out of debt
[2:03:53] and if you have to cut it up
[2:03:57] i have an apple watch i'm going to say
[2:03:59] it i have an iphone
[2:04:02] what
[2:04:03] yeah
[2:04:04] i have that in my home
[2:04:08] but there's people that believe that you
[2:04:09] shouldn't have internet
[2:04:11] there's people that believe that
[2:04:12] facebook is antichrist
[2:04:15] facebook can be the greatest tool
[2:04:18] in the right hands to defeat the devil
[2:04:22] i know what science says about facebook
[2:04:25] it's bad for our children's brains
[2:04:28] but it can also be a great gospel we can
[2:04:31] send out the truth through it and if
[2:04:33] we're not edifying jesus christ in our
[2:04:35] social media whatsapp facebook
[2:04:38] texting talking not doing it in all

[2:21:11] god has said is liberty
[2:21:13] god is life
[2:21:16] god is salvation god's everything
[2:21:19] everything that's good
[2:21:21] he's that
[2:21:24] amen it's so beautiful
[2:21:26] you know i want to
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:29] you know so many times
[2:21:32] you know we're a triune being
[2:21:35] and when we can get out of this flesh
[2:21:37] and get in the anointing
[2:21:39] then we're heavenly beans
[2:21:42] just for a few minutes we're heavenly
[2:21:44] beans
[2:21:45] now i want to share something that our
[2:21:47] prophet said you can still play honey
[2:21:49] i just want and this is
[2:21:51] in perfect gratitude you know a prophet
[2:21:54] was asked a question
[2:21:55] about martin luther king jr and
[2:21:57] something he had said
[2:21:59] and brother branham had said that he
[2:22:01] believed he would lead his people to a
[2:22:03] massacre
[2:22:05] and they were asking the prophet
[2:22:07] if that was
[2:22:08] what he thought or he believed would
[2:22:11] happen
[2:22:12] and this is a key point
[2:22:15] and it's happening
[2:22:16] right in our midst this morning tonight
[2:22:20] this is how the prophet answer died he
[2:22:21] said so many of the times
[2:22:25] well he said like this let me i would
[2:22:26] say four things he said
[2:22:28] be so careful what you listen to
[2:22:31] now he's talking about himself
[2:22:34] no i'm not knocking the prophet
[2:22:36] but this is the part i want you to get
[2:22:39] he said so much of the time
[2:22:42] there's so much
[2:22:43] flesh
[2:22:44] involved
[2:22:47] if you have a problem with a brother or
[2:22:48] sister it's not god
[2:22:51] it's just flesh
[2:22:52] it's just flesh
[2:22:54] if if you have a disagreement it's not
[2:22:56] god it's just flesh
[2:22:58] if you have a problem with me it's not
[2:22:59] god it's just flesh
[2:23:01] there's so much
[2:23:02] flesh that we've divided over flesh
[2:23:07] i don't like potatoes
[2:23:10] i like fried rice
[2:23:11] has nothing to do with god it's just
[2:23:13] flesh
[2:23:15] just less
[2:23:17] and people hated the prophet
[2:23:20] many times just out of flesh
[2:23:24] they didn't like it that he was a
[2:23:25] hillbilly any and he spoke funny
[2:23:29] just flesh had nothing to do with god it
[2:23:32] wasn't the life of god
[2:23:34] and if you've got struggles in your
[2:23:36] family it's just flesh
[2:23:38] if you've got struggles in the church
[2:23:41] it's not because god eat god god's the
[2:23:43] same today as he was yesterday 30 days
[2:23:46] it's just flesh
[2:23:48] it's just flesh
[2:23:50] you you and your
[2:23:52] this presence
[2:23:53] is beautiful
[2:23:55] but if you have a problem the same
[2:23:56] people have problems it's just flesh
[2:23:58] it's just it's just flesh
[2:24:01] and you know you can you can you can
[2:24:03] show that so beautifully by this
[2:24:05] experiment there was a dad and i'm gonna
[2:24:06] close with this there's a dad that had
[2:24:08] four sons and he sent his sons out to
[2:24:10] see the same thing at a different time
[2:24:14] he said once i know to see this this
[2:24:17] object
[2:24:18] and the sun come back
[2:24:19] in january and he told him what it
[2:24:21] looked like right he sent another sent
[2:24:23] out to look at it in may the son told
[2:24:25] him looked at the exact same thing told
[2:24:26] him completely different story
[2:24:28] and he sent his son out in august he
[2:24:30] looked at the same thing he told him it
[2:24:31] was completely different right and he
[2:24:33] sent his son out in november
[2:24:36] they told him four different things it
[2:24:38] was the exact same god
[2:24:42] identical god
[2:24:43] but that god was dark and cold at one
[2:24:45] time
[2:24:46] that god was green at one time that god
[2:24:48] was beautiful flowers and blossoms at
[2:24:50] one time and then the god was loaded
[2:24:53] with apples and fruit at one time
[2:24:56] and all four of the people and that was
[2:24:58] just flesh
[2:25:00] it was just flesh it was saying god
[2:25:03] it was just a flesh seeing something
[2:25:06] and we get so riled up sometimes in our
[2:25:08] flesh
[2:25:11] and it was the same god
[2:25:14] god help us god help me
[2:25:16] god help me
[2:25:18] you know that's where you see with the
[2:25:20] way of the world and things are going
[2:25:22] amen is that satan will try to roll up
[2:25:25] our flesh
[2:25:26] over
[2:25:27] lockdowns or anything anything anything
[2:25:30] money anything why family job
[2:25:34] car tires
[2:25:36] i mean anything
[2:25:39] but god's liberty
[2:25:40] god's deliberate god's all the same even
[2:25:42] though we might look different
[2:25:44] god's tall and skinny god's short and
[2:25:47] fat
[2:25:48] god's brown and god's white and god's
[2:25:50] black amen
[2:25:53] because the bible says that god is a
[2:25:55] spirit yes and those that worship him
[2:25:59] amen must worship him in that spirit
