[29:14] great
[29:15] amen
[29:17] amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus
[29:29] the opportunity to worship Him
[29:34] it's a thrill and the prophet said you
[29:37] know I don't come to church because I I
[29:40] don't worship God because I feel like I
[29:42] must have happened right just I I just
[29:45] love the worship
[29:47] you know I went this week because or
[29:50] last night the wind was coming back from
[29:53] her family reunion I went for a long
[29:56] long walk
[29:59] just praying that
[30:01] he would be here
[30:06] I'm nothing
[30:08] he's here oh man Lord
[30:14] and that's amazing
[30:19] I want to we will just read a couple of
[30:23] scriptures this morning
[30:25] I want to read psalms 42 7 and I want to
[30:27] preach on
[30:28] faith
[30:30] and I want to title my sermon he's there
[30:33] God is there
[30:40] just looking into this this
[30:42] God opened my eyes to something that
[30:47] shouldn't make each one of us just
[30:49] Rejoice on a container and it's just a
[30:53] very very simple thought
[30:56] but just a tremendous Revelation the
[30:58] Deep callethum to the Deep at the noise
[31:01] of the water spouse and all the ways
[31:05] and thou followers are gone over me
[31:09] Hallelujah let's turn over to John 6.
[31:12] and 44 John 6 and 44. no man can come
[31:17] unto me except the Father which has set
[31:20] me draw him and I will raise him up
[31:25] in the last day Hallelujah Lord Jesus we
[31:28] pray that you'll bless your word and may
[31:30] everything be done instead according to
[31:32] your plan we give you the glory for your
[31:35] name amen amen you may have receipts
[31:39] this morning
[31:40] just a great privilege this morning to
[31:43] minister for him and here we see in this
[31:46] chapter of David here reaching out the
[31:49] Deep color to the Deep here here David
[31:52] is is saying in the beginning of chapter
[31:54] 42 that all his heart yearned and longed
[31:57] to be with God and how his soul thirsted
[32:00] for God it's just this deep deep desire
[32:03] was a craving to God and you know in my
[32:06] study Bible and just maybe I'll pull it
[32:08] up jumping ahead you know the family of
[32:10] David had been in the temple and been
[32:12] worshipers and at this time they they
[32:15] weren't in the temple worship and David
[32:17] was longing for the closeness of God
[32:20] right he was longing he was remembering
[32:23] the good old days of his of his
[32:25] Christian wife and it was remembered how
[32:28] he was really remembering his first love
[32:30] right amen that's really what he was
[32:33] whenever he was remembering the
[32:34] fellowship and the communion that he had
[32:36] with Christ and he said and you know you
[32:38] read the jump and he said oh God don't
[32:41] need me
[32:43] completely don't never leave me
[32:46] this thirst is the non-believable
[32:48] cleanse amen a thirst for him and you
[32:52] know this was the Revelation that God
[32:54] it's just very very simple
[32:58] very simple thought but you know you
[33:01] can't be hungry for something
[33:04] unless first there was something there
[33:06] to satisfy that on you and the Very the
[33:10] very Revelation that you desire more of
[33:14] God or you desire something in your life
[33:17] proves that there was a god there not
[33:20] just to put the desire there but before
[33:22] he put the desire there
[33:36] for sure this weekend and many things
[33:42] wow you know our if we're going to look
[33:44] at some things that our Prophet said you
[33:46] know if God ever did something before in
[33:49] the past in his wedding
[33:51] and the same circumstances are met
[33:55] Duty bound and obligated
[33:58] to meet them again
[34:00] Hallelujah and you see all the Miracles
[34:03] if God did in his word you know if
[34:05] you're looking for a father
[34:07] he's your father and you're looking for
[34:09] a mother he's your mother he's your
[34:12] brother and your sister
[34:14] if you're looking for a mate this
[34:16] morning he's your man amen if you're
[34:18] looking for a family this morning he's
[34:20] your family amen hallelujah tremendous
[34:24] Revelation here the prophet the first
[34:26] thing he mentioned he said I was reading
[34:28] the other day of a little boy that was
[34:30] eating the races off his pencil in
[34:32] school and eating the rubber off his
[34:35] bicycle pedals right the doctor did his
[34:38] test
[34:39] and the boy liked sulfur
[34:42] and he said before that boyfriend praise
[34:44] offer he said there had to be a suffer
[34:48] to quench the third string in his body
[34:51] right now you just think of that
[34:53] spiritually he said now before you could
[34:56] crave the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:58] there's a sweet Lord Jesus that can give
[35:01] you the baptism for the holy God Amen
[35:04] Hallelujah you know read it and study we
[35:07] might get to this this is the the the
[35:09] the the the word comes to me you know
[35:12] the the prophet says that every seed of
[35:15] God
[35:16] the word of God to see you right yeah
[35:19] Hallelujah and all you got to do is
[35:25] that promise and it's a hundred percent
[35:28] you won't even desire it unless God will
[35:31] give you that desire you won't even
[35:33] desire it unless God has the ability to
[35:37] create that desire to fulfill that
[35:39] desire
[35:40] oh man oh that's crazy good man amen
[35:44] hallelujah you desired your lost loved
[35:47] ones saved in your family
[35:49] station
[35:50] hallelujah amen there is a great savior
[35:54] let's give the ability
[35:56] to save your loved ones
[35:59] oh it's just beautiful amen anything you
[36:02] would desire
[36:06] God first made it possible
[36:09] for it to be there that's right and then
[36:12] he planted the desire in your heart for
[36:15] you to have that hearing questions and
[36:17] answers we see somebody came to brother
[36:19] around and he said I loved many years
[36:21] since sin brother Brown and he said God
[36:24] didn't forgive me but he said I had come
[36:26] and I've sinned again and he said I'm
[36:28] not worthy to even begin lies or to ask
[36:32] you but he said brother can you can you
[36:34] please help me can I possibly
[36:38] possibly
[36:39] be saved again
[36:42] Hallelujah this was an amazing quote for
[36:46] me he said it he said no there's a
[36:49] question here he said I didn't see it
[36:50] right away he said now if that person's
[36:53] here he said I want to answer this so
[36:55] beautifully for you he said he said I've
[36:57] lived in sin many years
[37:00] and I've sinned again he said yes you
[37:04] can be saved
[37:06] yes you sinned again my friend so far
[37:09] but God can restore you he said you've
[37:12] never sinned too far when you desire to
[37:16] be restored he said if you went too far
[37:19] you wouldn't even have the desire to
[37:22] serve him right that's amazing
[37:25] we think oh well you know I would like
[37:27] to be a better Christian that's because
[37:29] God predestinated it to me now all right
[37:32] I'd like to have a family that's because
[37:34] God predestinated you to have a family
[37:37] amen these are just mental dissemitism
[37:41] it was God before the foundation of the
[37:44] world made it available yeah it's
[37:46] beautiful amen hallelujah you desire to
[37:50] be in fellowship with him he said that's
[37:52] because he's putting along in your heart
[37:55] you see how David and this Psalm is just
[37:58] crying out to God and design why why
[38:02] can't I have that first communion of my
[38:04] first love
[38:06] like I remember
[38:08] in my past I want to tell you this
[38:10] morning
[38:10] you can you can but it's just entirely
[38:15] up to you it's not whether you have a
[38:17] good pastor or a good uh
[38:21] the bifold Ministry or
[38:24] even a good Bible
[38:26] or a good God those aren't the problem
[38:30] imagine a prophets we will look into
[38:32] that and talked many times about
[38:33] watering it with our faith our very own
[38:36] faith
[38:37] but he also said it I think he said 66
[38:40] times that it it mattered on your
[38:43] personal person
[38:45] thank you right how big is your god it's
[38:49] just on the limits that you put on
[38:52] Christ that's it you know I want this
[38:55] but my Christ he can't do it
[38:58] because he's not that big to me amen
[39:01] oh God helps me amen God help you to
[39:05] change that that way of thinking
[39:08] that he could meet every need
[39:12] Hallelujah he said guilty he said here
[39:15] you hear the prophet the difference in
[39:17] this quote he said as long as there's
[39:19] something dealing with your heart then
[39:21] there's still a line of restoration he
[39:24] said guilty of the lease is guilty of
[39:27] the whole he said I sin many times
[39:29] talking about himself every day every
[39:32] one of us do something that we don't
[39:34] want to do he says that's it the proof
[39:38] that God's still dealing with your heart
[39:41] now I want to I want to look at this
[39:43] this is this should give many of us
[39:45] great great hope here he said there's a
[39:48] hunger for something there's got to be
[39:51] something somewhere
[39:53] or you would never have the hunger for
[39:55] it see no man come to you know we have
[39:59] we we think a lot of ourselves I mean
[40:01] that's just I mean that's I mean if
[40:04] you're a human right you have my opinion
[40:06] of yourself
[40:09] and if you're a Christian you'll have to
[40:11] always put that down and fight that
[40:14] yeah
[40:15] right
[40:16] the religion around the world thinks
[40:19] that now listen I'm brilliant I'm
[40:21] calculating decision and I chose to
[40:24] serve God
[40:27] that's hilarious to God
[40:30] when the Bible says that no man would
[40:32] even desire him yes
[40:38] oh Hallelujah so you see when you got
[40:41] that desire
[40:42] shows what God thinks of you it's not
[40:45] like for a chance
[40:47] those that I called I Chosen and I'm
[40:50] already glorified
[40:54] this is beautiful to me you know just
[40:57] drop the 103 here he says now before
[40:59] there was ever a creation there had to
[41:02] be a creator of the creation and so
[41:04] that's what I mean as long as you're
[41:07] wanting or hungry to get back to God
[41:12] there's a God somewhere calling you see
[41:15] or do you want to be hungry right
[41:17] there's the Creator there's a place that
[41:20] you cross where you can't get back but
[41:22] when you are at that down there again
[41:26] in the same shape you was it goes to
[41:29] show that you've only Fall From Grace
[41:31] he's talking about
[41:33] backsliding or leaving fellowship with
[41:36] God he says box living
[41:39] is not lost
[41:41] I love this part
[41:43] and then most of the world don't have
[41:46] this revelation backslidden
[41:49] is not lost he said I want somebody to
[41:51] show me somewhere in the Bible where
[41:53] backslund
[41:55] is lost
[41:57] he said it proves I said I can prove it
[41:59] in the Bible he says backsliding it's
[42:02] not lost he said it's just other
[42:03] Fellowship yes Hallelujah you could no
[42:07] more be lost if God could be lost if
[42:09] you've ever been in Fellowship amen
[42:11] you've lost your first love you've lost
[42:13] your desire what's your desire this
[42:15] morning all right I pray to God we're
[42:18] not just in a religious realm and just
[42:20] in a form and right
[42:26] but they never lost their Covenant yes
[42:29] yes they lost their praise
[42:33] what's your worship like
[42:35] David lost the joy of his salvation when
[42:38] he took Bathsheba but he never lost his
[42:41] salvation
[42:42] I mean Eternal will fall
[42:45] horrendous fall but David never said
[42:49] restoring my salvation he said restore
[42:51] me my fellowship the joy a boyfriend
[42:56] and he said watch how he closes he said
[42:58] now there's much of this legalism today
[43:02] he said touch not face not
[43:05] and he said don't do these things
[43:07] legally right none
[43:10] see God's in control of everything Amen
[43:13] in her heart and around amen God help us
[43:16] amen amen
[43:19] let's just look at here uh uh when when
[43:22] our eyes were open he said now we have
[43:26] all right then when we come to God to
[43:29] ask him for his help now I'm telling you
[43:31] this
[43:33] that the work is already finished your
[43:36] your plan for you it's already finished
[43:38] with survival declares that is finished
[43:41] he says arrest within your personal
[43:45] faith
[43:47] and the finished work of Jesus Christ if
[43:50] you need something this morning from
[43:52] Christ
[43:54] you can have it
[43:56] it's just do you believe that's that's
[44:00] just it do you believe
[44:04] what's the Bible say those that believe
[44:06] on me the Son of God they Shout
[44:11] he said what are Prophet teachers what
[44:14] is sin
[44:15] it wasn't all the attributes of sin
[44:18] it was just unbelief in him it was sin
[44:22] oh my amazing 66 times
[44:27] our Prophet mentioned your personal
[44:30] faith your personal relationship how big
[44:35] is your God Amen can he do it amen and
[44:39] we see this these calls the Deep here
[44:41] here before the foundation of the world
[44:43] God put something in us to pull us back
[44:46] that should make you crazy happy when
[44:49] you feel that when you when you vote and
[44:51] you're going to cut something and you
[44:53] just feel
[44:55] oh
[44:56] when you would say or do or take your
[44:59] thoughts and you feel something
[45:04] you should just go wow
[45:07] because I was God that put it there amen
[45:11] Hallelujah can you imagine
[45:15] I can can you imagine the people that
[45:19] could go out and commit horrific things
[45:22] and feel nothing right at all
[45:26] no check
[45:31] right
[45:34] and we feel those checks
[45:37] and because we felt them for so long
[45:42] I take them for granted
[45:48] that's helpless
[45:50] God help me
[45:53] amen
[45:58] see God Made A Way
[46:01] for us to be for you know the Bible says
[46:04] that I I know the thoughts that I have
[46:06] towards you
[46:08] God never intended you to live below
[46:10] your privilege he never give you a big
[46:13] bank account of all the promises in the
[46:15] word of God he never revealed the
[46:18] mysteries of them and open them to your
[46:20] eyesight
[46:22] for you to say Lord
[46:25] right
[46:26] yeah
[46:28] he did all that
[46:30] wow
[46:32] no he never did that see he said God
[46:35] here God set forth something that there
[46:39] was something to meet this something and
[46:41] it was the Deep to respond
[46:44] to the deal you know the prophet you
[46:46] know what I when I looked up and studied
[46:48] this scripture
[46:50] it was hundreds of times
[46:53] I think it was actually 89th I'm sorry
[46:55] that the prophet mentioned the Deep to
[46:58] the deep deep calls to the deep and
[46:59] multiple times early in his ministry he
[47:02] preaches of the pull of God in our life
[47:06] God help us amen God help us here in The
[47:11] Thirst in 65 here he's mentioned it
[47:13] David in Psalms 42 7 he says the need
[47:16] code to the beat the north of the waters
[47:19] Club he says he says see there had to be
[47:21] a fan on a fist fight
[47:24] to put them to be able to swim right he
[47:27] has to have the need for them
[47:30] did God put a need in your life that you
[47:33] needed God right and it's all you have
[47:35] to do is accept it amen and all your
[47:38] problems are over right
[47:40] amen we're the author of the god of the
[47:43] Prophet say he said the biggest enemy I
[47:44] got is me
[47:46] it's not your your enemy just look in
[47:49] the mirror that's all you mean wow
[47:53] what a revelation he said no if that
[47:57] would say that I'm going to become
[47:58] a different fish
[48:00] and I'm going to become oh wow just
[48:03] think of this on a human realm because
[48:05] I'm going to become a smart fish
[48:07] I'm going to educate myself I love that
[48:10] God's just upstairs just killing himself
[48:13] laughing
[48:14] he says yep I'm just gonna go and
[48:17] believe some other Theology and believe
[48:19] that I don't need to be past this
[48:22] feeling
[48:24] he said he won't get very far
[48:26] in the water
[48:28] I won't get very far right I wonder if
[48:31] that's the problem with the church today
[48:32] you know our Prophet said in studying
[48:34] this week he said the the greatest
[48:36] hindrance in the church today is because
[48:39] we've never took the last Commandment
[48:42] that Christ Jesus gave us
[48:45] before he left here
[48:47] he said we've done everything
[48:51] but uh
[48:53] did we build hospitals we'd build
[48:55] schools we bought new cars we've sent
[48:59] but he said just go into all the world
[49:02] and preach to God right
[49:04] just Minister you didn't just Minister
[49:07] me all right go freeze to me
[49:12] God help us God help us to be in a state
[49:15] where we can feel and be led by his
[49:18] leadership right you know you know when
[49:20] we we mentioned that that's just I
[49:23] believe I mentioned you know I had a
[49:25] pastor mentally
[49:27] from India this week
[49:29] and I'll tell you what we're supposed
[49:43] to pray that that God
[49:45] guide us all he's everything
[49:48] we're nothing without nothing nothing
[49:52] believe me I wouldn't want to step one
[49:54] step out of his will
[49:56] some of these people ask me hugely
[50:00] to come
[50:02] say what can I do without God
[50:06] they say no
[50:09] I don't
[50:10] know should I go
[50:12] the only thing I know is that I should
[50:14] minister
[50:16] yeah
[50:17] I tell you what
[50:19] the call is great
[50:21] but the workers are for you the genuine
[50:23] workers are few you know this pastor
[50:25] again most accepted literally probably a
[50:28] hundred pictures and videos
[50:30] and he said every one of their churches
[50:33] were maybe just no buildings at all I
[50:36] said most of our complete churches meet
[50:38] other truths
[50:40] they said most of the people in the
[50:42] church if they have enough to eat
[50:50] wow
[50:52] we have beautiful buildings and
[50:54] beautiful places beautiful cars to go
[50:57] you know God said we'll be judged for
[50:59] that
[51:00] says you know look at look at the queen
[51:02] look at the queen that went across the
[51:04] desert on a County
[51:08] no air conditioning no cushion scene no
[51:11] 64 adjustments on your seat
[51:15] robbers pirate robbers in the desert to
[51:18] Rob everything they took because she
[51:20] took her ties and offerings with her and
[51:22] she wasn't even
[51:27] raised
[51:28] Christian
[51:29] but she seemed so she felt something God
[51:32] help us amen you know it just you know
[51:35] talking to you know I just
[51:38] those things affect me because if you're
[51:41] the bride of Christ you're going to
[51:42] spend eternity with those brothers and
[51:45] sisters now I just want to know how
[51:48] comfortable are you going to be sitting
[51:49] next door to them
[51:54] anyways it affects me
[51:57] in fact
[51:59] you know
[52:00] had a pastor from Uganda message Man one
[52:04] of his deacons been a deacon for years
[52:06] that they they fight the the mosquito
[52:09] and malaria huge domain he said they
[52:13] expect all their income all summer like
[52:16] malaria in the kids
[52:18] the dead that keeps the sick went to
[52:20] hospital they they said yeah you're sick
[52:22] he sent him out without one single pill
[52:24] for malaria
[52:26] and
[52:28] he needed three dollars and 50 cents
[52:32] Canadian and he would die
[52:36] just
[52:39] you don't have three dollars I I can't
[52:41] comprehend that
[52:43] I cannot read it
[52:49] how do I get around that
[52:53] but if you feel so
[52:56] it's the Deep yeah the
[53:00] Bible says when you help those
[53:04] this is this is
[53:06] predestinated bride of grass yeah yeah
[53:09] right he said you actually give to God
[53:12] you actually learned to God it had
[53:13] nothing to do with the flashlight the x
[53:15] is born on you actually the Bible says
[53:17] you borrow money to God
[53:20] wow
[53:22] wow I just
[53:25] are we really do we deserve what we are
[53:28] do I disagree
[53:31] oh Jesus help me be worthy
[53:34] I mean you can help me
[53:36] amazing
[53:38] God help us he said Mike this uh this
[53:41] thirst Toby said you know he said before
[53:44] there was a tree before God made a tree
[53:46] he said there has to be a nurse the
[53:48] girl's a tree and he said that's right
[53:50] he said I suppose
[53:52] that if the tree decided it wanted to be
[53:54] a unique tree
[53:56] and a very uh to to fight the the the
[54:00] the common God
[54:03] predestinated plan the tree could say
[54:06] now I don't want to be planted in Earth
[54:09] I wonder if sometimes we have our
[54:12] spiritual life like this we are fighting
[54:14] what God has predestinated for our life
[54:17] there's no God I don't want to go your
[54:20] way I know you plan that I can planted
[54:23] here in Wyoming in the Earth yeah yeah
[54:24] but I don't want that I want to be
[54:26] planted on the road
[54:28] in another place you know what he says
[54:32] you want to live right now
[54:35] it was a part of God's plan
[54:41] he said when the deed calls the deed he
[54:44] said it's not joining our church
[54:46] he said it's not taking a preacher's
[54:48] hand
[54:49] he said it's more than living good and a
[54:53] nice clean straight life he said it
[54:55] takes something to satisfy
[54:58] that inner longing for God and he said
[55:00] is when God Pours Down and draws you to
[55:06] himself we should you know when we feel
[55:08] that we should just go wow
[55:10] wow why me Lord I was singing that song
[55:14] we're getting the feeling I couldn't
[55:16] remember the words
[55:22] what did I ever do
[55:24] what did I ever do
[55:26] to deserve you
[55:30] guys
[55:35] oh man
[55:37] he said the Deep gone to the need he
[55:39] said it's the noise of the Waters of
[55:41] other sins of God's holy spirit
[55:43] drawing you
[55:46] strong
[55:47] is pulling you up to your life that he
[55:50] had planned for you amen be found the
[55:54] foundation of the world now I want to
[55:55] look into this and and see you know it's
[55:58] based if we got to make this personal
[55:59] this relationship with Christ has to be
[56:02] personal and so it's based on your
[56:04] personal faith but I want to show you
[56:06] some Faith some some uh some examples
[56:09] here
[56:11] of God and the repetition of God if he
[56:15] ever did it one way he'll do it again
[56:17] always so if you can see an example in
[56:21] the Bible say God I'm not
[56:23] woman all right I'm
[56:29] just making amen just change the name
[56:32] and the same God is dutely bound to
[56:35] respond to his word he's watching some
[56:37] Jehovah driver he said if God ever
[56:39] healed a man face up
[56:41] uh on on the faces he healed the model
[56:43] he said he's got to heal the next one
[56:46] when he comes to the same place if he
[56:49] didn't he acted wrong in the first place
[56:52] then the decision he made was wrong but
[56:55] that's not possible we're serving a an
[56:58] infinite God
[57:00] you know the problems of this he said
[57:02] you know we grow in knowledge and wisdom
[57:04] and we make better decisions we get this
[57:06] stuff that's golden white hair
[57:08] amen right
[57:10] but God was born
[57:14] he was the
[57:16] guy he was the chance from the beginning
[57:18] right he don't get a better idea all
[57:21] right amen if I had only none
[57:25] that's not God
[57:27] Hallelujah he said if he ever makes a
[57:30] decision he has to stay with it and if
[57:33] he doesn't then it made a wrong decision
[57:35] who can say that God made a wrong
[57:38] decision
[57:40] you can't say that
[57:43] so you can line up your own personal
[57:46] in the word of God and say God I fit
[57:49] exactly in this round
[57:52] what about me
[57:54] that is just your faith
[57:57] to accept it it's not a problem with God
[58:00] amen
[58:02] does God change his mind because here
[58:05] here in the 65 40 said because if God
[58:07] ever makes a decision he'll say with
[58:10] that decision and each time the same
[58:13] problem comes up he said he's got to act
[58:15] the same way he did the first time
[58:18] or reacting wrong the first time so if
[58:21] you give me something to have base it on
[58:24] your faith I'm trying to show you this
[58:28] morning if you would long for something
[58:31] in your life and it's scriptural
[58:33] it's just it's this simple amen it's
[58:36] yours yes
[58:40] amen it's completely yours
[58:43] if you can believe it amen and if you
[58:46] can't believe it
[58:48] it's offended
[58:55] God help us
[58:57] see God is infinite he's perfect and if
[59:00] God ever does anything see if he just
[59:03] remember now if God ever does anything
[59:06] and the way he does it he can never
[59:10] change that because you see he's
[59:13] powerful man
[59:15] the thing that was just so amazing to me
[59:19] was the very desire that you have
[59:22] for God what's God given amen that's
[59:26] right the very desire you have that
[59:29] these things that are scriptural
[59:32] amen was given to you by God and you
[59:35] can't get up
[59:36] yeah how's that possible
[59:39] God give up and he provided them for you
[59:43] and he actually put it in your word
[59:46] we're going to read that scripture where
[59:48] where the word of God is deceased just
[59:50] like we were believing for babies he
[59:52] said every seed will bring forth of its
[59:54] time amen that's that's his scripture he
[59:57] gave you a hunger for a family said
[59:59] happy is the man who's forever is full
[1:00:01] but but God will
[1:00:12] it's just child like we got the kingdom
[1:00:15] of evidence like children
[1:00:17] I mean there's an openly believe yes
[1:00:21] I hope they don't lay away good night
[1:00:23] wondering if they're gonna have a home
[1:00:24] or food or or shelter or care
[1:00:28] but we later went good night wondering
[1:00:30] if God couldn't provide
[1:00:33] oh my goodness
[1:00:37] you know here we have too much faith in
[1:00:39] our government not enough faith in our
[1:00:42] God
[1:00:43] we really do that's the curse of North
[1:00:46] America rich countries
[1:00:51] just remember the government
[1:00:55] the safest government
[1:00:57] no matter which parties in
[1:01:00] controlled by Satan until the Millennium
[1:01:03] he got that right
[1:01:05] I don't like that either but this time
[1:01:07] he's influenced life it's unbelievable
[1:01:10] you know I I don't know where this is
[1:01:11] coming but I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:01:13] raise your faith in God and take your
[1:01:15] faith away from the government I was
[1:01:16] watching videos this week some of them I
[1:01:18] put on Facebook and and it's amazing
[1:01:21] when people are afraid to uh uh
[1:01:24] associate with me because they think
[1:01:25] I'll be home and that's all right if God
[1:01:28] is after that it would be fine
[1:01:31] you know
[1:01:33] I was trying to show you this you know
[1:01:34] when Nixon was in brother Brandon voted
[1:01:37] for Nixon by the way when Nixon was in I
[1:01:39] believe it was Nixon that God
[1:01:41] yes thank you sorry uh I I can show you
[1:01:44] these videos when Nixon was in he called
[1:01:46] the the the behind the scenes government
[1:01:49] you know I had a brother and I gotta go
[1:01:51] see him
[1:01:52] they came here the vet you know and he
[1:01:54] told me a long time ago he said yeah all
[1:01:56] the governments are the same you know so
[1:01:58] I would say well this one you know like
[1:02:01] they were kind to Israel with that and
[1:02:03] they are like somewhere
[1:02:05] and you know I want to show you
[1:02:07] something there's a government behind
[1:02:09] the government so Nixon went to the to
[1:02:12] the what did you say of the FBI it might
[1:02:14] have been somebody else and they say I
[1:02:16] know for a fact who killed
[1:02:18] uh Kennedy
[1:02:21] and the FBI broken to the White House or
[1:02:25] wherever the papers were the very next
[1:02:27] day and five men broke in and four of
[1:02:29] them worked for the FBI and sold them
[1:02:30] and then they confounded the story to
[1:02:33] get Nixon kicked out and the Very person
[1:02:36] that they put in Nixon's place was the
[1:02:39] FBI worker
[1:02:41] right and you can say well that's not
[1:02:43] true he said you know they have never
[1:02:45] released the documents of Kennedy ever
[1:02:47] for the public you know why
[1:02:49] because it was the government that did
[1:02:51] it and we're like oh I love my country
[1:02:55] blessed God I think I'll go fight in the
[1:02:58] army
[1:03:00] yeah I don't think so
[1:03:03] I ain't fighting in no government
[1:03:05] already for the devil
[1:03:10] when this was came to me you know never
[1:03:13] in history before or since
[1:03:16] did a president get more votes than
[1:03:19] Nixon
[1:03:20] he got
[1:03:21] I think it was
[1:03:24] it was tens of millions more than as
[1:03:27] close as him
[1:03:28] and the Very truth that he was going to
[1:03:31] reveal now first off I want to back up
[1:03:32] and see first off the reason the
[1:03:34] government had to kill Kennedy was
[1:03:36] because he made the Kennedy money and he
[1:03:38] was going to leave the world back
[1:03:40] get all that money is still in
[1:03:42] circulation
[1:03:44] it actually has his name right on the
[1:03:45] bottom of it
[1:03:47] he was killed about four a singular like
[1:03:49] a handful of days after he made the
[1:03:52] speech and he said this opportunity to
[1:03:54] make the speech I'm not I'm trying to
[1:03:55] lower your faith in the government and
[1:03:57] raise your faith in God I'm not talking
[1:03:58] politics Kennedy said now that I'm in
[1:04:02] leadership I see that there's a force
[1:04:04] behind the scenes and I'm in a position
[1:04:06] that's what he said to kill that force
[1:04:09] and say sorry
[1:04:11] period
[1:04:13] as the last day 70 years later they've
[1:04:16] still not released the documents to that
[1:04:18] and that Nixon comes up was the greatest
[1:04:21] election of the choice of the people
[1:04:26] and he admits that he knows who it is
[1:04:27] and because he would reveal that to the
[1:04:30] people and there would be a revolt
[1:04:36] you think you got a grill a lot of those
[1:04:39] guys I know I don't want to be an
[1:04:41] American I want to be as far away from
[1:04:43] America as possible
[1:04:45] I praise God every time I come out of
[1:04:47] that country
[1:04:52] I'm shocking but it's the truth
[1:04:55] I need to suffer
[1:04:57] because Christ is your only hope amen

[1:05:28] sick and calls on God and if God ever
[1:05:30] heals one person the same drowns that he
[1:05:34] brought that men to the healing that if
[1:05:38] he's God he's called on it again amen
[1:05:42] amen well let's just talk about babies
[1:05:44] for a minute remember the woman that
[1:05:46] took was kind to the prophet yes right
[1:05:49] and the prophet said why are you being
[1:05:51] so kind building a home on a room and
[1:05:53] you know support my Ministry and be to
[1:05:55] me and giving me nice about it and all
[1:05:57] that said could I do something for you
[1:05:59] and the workers of the Prophet said now
[1:06:01] she's back
[1:06:03] and now in that day that was a
[1:06:05] tremendous shame
[1:06:09] and the prophet said he said woman
[1:06:12] about 12 months from now
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:21] now A man was sick a woman was sick and
[1:06:24] he ever healed a person on the same
[1:06:26] ground said he brought Batman for his
[1:06:28] healing
[1:06:29] if he stopped
[1:06:32] he's ever called us again if he's ever
[1:06:35] called on again
[1:06:37] that he's got the man the same decision
[1:06:40] the exact same decision oh
[1:06:44] right you just say God
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] wow thank you Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:06:54] saying yesterday today and forever if
[1:06:56] God ever makes a decision and does
[1:06:58] anything one time he's got to do it
[1:07:01] again the next time exactly
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:10] if you feel that it's given to God and
[1:07:13] before you feel it God's already made
[1:07:16] the provision for the attribute of the
[1:07:19] feeling
[1:07:21] let's start
[1:07:23] that's amazing
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:29] hallelujah
[1:07:31] hallelujah here at Fellowship says the
[1:07:33] reason the church is in the fifth place
[1:07:36] among religions as it comes to numbers
[1:07:39] it's because we fail to do the
[1:07:41] Commandment that God did this is a
[1:07:43] fellowship message he said the last
[1:07:45] words that Jesus gave was going to all
[1:07:47] the world of preaching us
[1:07:49] that's why I say if you pray for me pray
[1:07:51] for God to lead us in guys it's I'm
[1:07:54] happy here
[1:07:56] but if God wants you to go somewhere
[1:07:57] else just make it wide open like you
[1:08:01] know what I like easy decisions just
[1:08:03] like girls
[1:08:15] who've been feeling fulfilling the
[1:08:17] scripture
[1:08:19] all right
[1:08:21] here here's the scene on that and this
[1:08:24] is a good one for us to lay down in our
[1:08:26] hearts the word is the sea
[1:08:30] but the seed won't grow unless it has a
[1:08:32] place of right kind of ground amen no
[1:08:36] matter how much seed you got what we got
[1:08:38] a lot of word we got the message of the
[1:08:40] hour
[1:08:41] okay
[1:08:44] I just
[1:08:47] no matter how much seed you got which is
[1:08:51] a word if you're afraid
[1:08:56] if you're afraid to sow it
[1:08:59] afraid to sow it he repeats that afraid
[1:09:03] he sends afraid three times
[1:09:06] let me go back to this he says if you're
[1:09:10] afraid to someone three dots in
[1:09:12] paragraphs afraid to soul and then
[1:09:15] you've got a dash afraid
[1:09:18] the sea will do you no good amen amen
[1:09:25] amen do we have the word of the hour yes
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:31] that in itself should make you lose your
[1:09:33] mind that God loved you enough to send a
[1:09:36] message or prophet in this day and just
[1:09:39] take those things that I had no idea
[1:09:41] what
[1:09:42] until this message I didn't understand
[1:09:44] predestination I never even believed I
[1:09:46] never knew it was a goodbye
[1:09:49] did you know the mystery of the garden
[1:09:55] did you know that you shouldn't get
[1:09:56] baptized in the tree
[1:10:00] did you understand the god
[1:10:05] and it won't do you one bit again
[1:10:09] if you're afraid
[1:10:12] ouch
[1:10:15] that one just missed it yeah other rip
[1:10:21] ouch
[1:10:25] he said but listen to this every word
[1:10:28] it says every word of God
[1:10:31] is a seed Jesus said so and every
[1:10:34] promise of God will come to pass
[1:10:42] he said in every promise of God will
[1:10:44] come to pass if you'll receive it
[1:10:47] and are afraid and don't doubt it amen
[1:10:50] please place this
[1:10:53] in my oh and can place it in your heart
[1:10:56] sorry believe it came from God and water
[1:11:00] it with your faith
[1:11:03] so if you need something in your life
[1:11:05] just just put it on the body don't count
[1:11:08] it just
[1:11:10] dead
[1:11:11] man you stay up not yet but you don't
[1:11:16] have to worry about the seed growing
[1:11:19] it's God it'll grow
[1:11:22] the germination
[1:11:26] you know when I keep seed I keep seeing
[1:11:28] on the farm because I'm not a
[1:11:30] as much of a hybrid farmer as modern
[1:11:33] Farmers so I keep my needs and seeds in
[1:11:35] that and I remember as a kid you know my
[1:11:37] dad would count out 100 beans put them
[1:11:40] on in that paper and put them on a plate
[1:11:41] put them in the window
[1:11:43] then count out how many sprouts
[1:11:46] because I didn't pay nobody fifty
[1:11:48] dollars a bag for a unit
[1:11:50] for some kind of Roundup breaking poison
[1:11:52] that's gonna make your ears fall off
[1:11:54] so I test my germination
[1:11:58] yeah yeah and if you've got no
[1:12:00] germination and you really want to use
[1:12:02] the seed then you don't want to buy that
[1:12:03] poison stuff called hybrid
[1:12:06] you just turn up the quality a little
[1:12:08] bit yeah but you don't have to do that
[1:12:10] with God
[1:12:11] number one you don't have the best God
[1:12:13] because he's already proven all right at
[1:12:16] number two you're never gonna have to
[1:12:17] turn them up because you will lose your
[1:12:19] mind just at the regular rate yeah
[1:12:24] Amen in a spring forth of its time
[1:12:28] don't never forget this statement No
[1:12:31] this is our Prophet Brethren and fellas
[1:12:34] so don't never forget this statement he
[1:12:36] said make this I make this from my heart
[1:12:41] I believe it
[1:12:43] I believe he said the right mental
[1:12:46] attitude
[1:12:47] towards any promise of God
[1:12:50] will bring you to pass amen amen
[1:12:54] remember the prophet when she when when
[1:12:57] she had Prophet The Prophet the mother
[1:12:58] of the Prophet salmon she said God if
[1:13:01] you give me a baby man
[1:13:03] I promise
[1:13:05] I promise
[1:13:06] I'll give a great back to you in your
[1:13:09] service you think I can't either oh my
[1:13:12] goodness oh don't insult my God that's
[1:13:15] just
[1:13:17] if you say God you give me a mental I'll
[1:13:20] raise everything about you to be
[1:13:22] anything you want to be in his life to
[1:13:25] either be a minister or finance a
[1:13:27] Ministry
[1:13:30] and fulfill your commandment of going to
[1:13:33] all the world and preaching us for what
[1:13:35] our Prophet saying he said if you can't
[1:13:36] go yourself then send somebody right
[1:13:39] yeah
[1:13:40] [Music]

[1:13:44] like I announce our meetings come out in
[1:13:47] November third fourth and 5th
[1:13:50] and I communicated with Junior Henry's
[1:13:53] Pastor multiple months it was in
[1:13:56] sentence of voice things and oh it was
[1:13:59] it was just like God brought something
[1:14:01] for me when I get off I was maybe 100
[1:14:04] sure before but when I got done I was
[1:14:06] 100 sure
[1:14:07] you know after
[1:14:09] we had arranged for him to come he sent
[1:14:12] me another message and just could just
[1:14:14] confirm you know just confirm it's like

[1:14:38] and it stopped me
[1:14:40] yeah
[1:14:41] yes that's amazing we need to recognize
[1:14:45] that Jehovah is in our presence he's in
[1:14:50] our lives we don't come to see each
[1:14:52] other although we love each other dearly
[1:14:54] and we hate to be apart but that's God
[1:14:58] it's completely
[1:15:00] Hallelujah

[1:15:18] and God is behind this word in the word
[1:15:20] of God will bring it to the Past
[1:15:24] that's what it says
[1:15:26] amen thank you Lord
[1:15:28] here we see in Hebrews 11 1 he says now
[1:15:31] Faith is the substance of things over
[1:15:36] and it's the evidence
[1:15:38] a thing's not seen now Faith
[1:15:41] has a backbone hold on it's like well I
[1:15:45] hope it don't rain today tomorrow
[1:15:48] or I hope you know
[1:15:50] no no they think like Coke right
[1:15:53] I mean we have a great hope but faith is
[1:15:56] unknown
[1:15:57] right it's a commandment he says speak
[1:16:00] and go forward right and not just like
[1:16:03] the prophet he said if you've got the
[1:16:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost why crying out
[1:16:07] to me you already have a mind of Christ
[1:16:10] you watch this you know and I'm saying
[1:16:13] this and said he said look at all the
[1:16:15] attributes of God he had him a father
[1:16:17] and a Healer and a savior and a and all
[1:16:21] these things
[1:16:22] and you in Genesis 1 27 were made in the
[1:16:25] image of God do you think you're going
[1:16:26] to be any different
[1:16:34] Hallelujah you're gonna have that same
[1:16:36] attributes as your father and he's
[1:16:38] already there to fulfill him amen oh
[1:16:42] it's beautiful yeah thank you Lord Jesus
[1:16:46] amen
[1:16:50] in the message I will resources the Lord
[1:16:52] Jesus said every word is a seed he said
[1:16:54] is that right the sword went forth and
[1:16:56] so in the scene he said I am the son of
[1:16:58] man that sowed the seed and the seed is
[1:17:01] the word of God and every time you see
[1:17:03] the Bible says anything it's a seed it's
[1:17:06] an absolute
[1:17:09] every seed of Frankfort is time you'll
[1:17:11] bring forth Holy Ghost spelled babies
[1:17:15] amen and you are so the incorrupt the
[1:17:18] fuel if we're sowed in The Incorruptible
[1:17:20] seed of God and if a man will take
[1:17:23] exactly what it says to do he said now
[1:17:26] if you'll plant that seed and then go
[1:17:28] out every morning and dig it out
[1:17:32] well I'm not sure God I can't see God in
[1:17:34] my presence
[1:17:38] well first off we need better eyesight
[1:17:40] amen you need the worldly skills of
[1:17:43] later to see the fall off your eyes and
[1:17:45] and your spiritualization comes out yeah
[1:17:48] and then you won't be no wonderful good
[1:17:50] because you'll be dancing in the spirit
[1:17:52] right
[1:17:55] amen he says now
[1:17:58] if you plant the seed and then go out
[1:18:01] every morning dig it up and say see it's
[1:18:04] growing it'll never grow
[1:18:07] yeah that way he said plant the seed
[1:18:11] water watch what he says
[1:18:13] commit it to God and leave it at God's
[1:18:16] door
[1:18:18] amen God's there he can easily take care
[1:18:23] of it
[1:18:24] amen and you don't have to check on God
[1:18:28] Hallelujah
[1:18:33] God help us to be in a place yes sir
[1:18:35] where we can hear his voice and respond
[1:18:39] to it and not have to be you know there
[1:18:42] is a time
[1:18:44] when the Bible says that God will not
[1:18:46] always strive with men
[1:18:51] and if you feel the tug if you feel the
[1:18:54] pull if you feel the deep tunnel to the
[1:18:56] D I would really encourage you when you
[1:18:58] go home read psalms 42 it's only about
[1:19:01] 11 verses
[1:19:02] but it's it's just David
[1:19:05] beside himself
[1:19:08] consumed
[1:19:10] with the worship of God
[1:19:13] and who he is I'm telling you what you
[1:19:16] know when I the more that we grow
[1:19:18] spiritually
[1:19:19] the less the things just
[1:19:22] fall off me I I get so I know the
[1:19:25] Earthly good amen I could be in I was
[1:19:29] you know this week I worked a couple
[1:19:31] week Fields just a couple week fields
[1:19:33] and I I have I almost had that song Down
[1:19:36] path he's the same guy
[1:19:39] I could sing that song and just weep and
[1:19:41] attract
[1:19:42] Ive just for me
[1:19:44] but we've realized that he said exactly
[1:19:47] the same guy
[1:19:49] that spoke to the woman after a while
[1:19:51] right he's exactly the same guy whose
[1:19:54] wonders are too many
[1:19:57] amen the same God who parted the Red Sea
[1:20:02] oh and he said this is
[1:20:05] the exact same God
[1:20:08] in all those churches exactly the same
[1:20:11] God Reagan Cyrus and it's bubbling like
[1:20:14] that
[1:20:15] that adhesion woman just like I don't
[1:20:17] know what's gonna go like something's
[1:20:19] gonna blow
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:29] wow
[1:20:34] there was that many clubs with this
[1:20:36] quote that you know there was a
[1:20:38] time to brother Brandon's Ministry
[1:20:42] where he was ministering
[1:20:47] and he told
[1:20:48] he felt the Holy Spirit tell him
[1:20:52] to do something
[1:20:54] and he obeyed
[1:20:57] and he went to that person
[1:21:00] and the person insulted the prophet
[1:21:04] he did the exactly the correct thing
[1:21:08] he said woman
[1:21:10] God told me
[1:21:13] to do that
[1:21:15] tell you what
[1:21:16] when we get to the place
[1:21:19] that you can step out and say God
[1:21:22] totally
[1:21:24] that is mine
[1:21:29] whoa buddy
[1:21:34] this lady rejected
[1:21:41] she rejected the book and the prophet
[1:21:44] was back in that town
[1:21:45] many years later
[1:21:49] remember how he gave the examples of
[1:21:51] death
[1:21:53] the trees want to live on the road the
[1:21:56] fish want to live without a fin and you
[1:21:58] won't live without Christ right
[1:22:01] you'll die
[1:22:02] it was back in that town
[1:22:05] later and he never even recognized the
[1:22:09] person
[1:22:10] but she recognized him because see he
[1:22:13] still looked like Christ oh oh that's
[1:22:16] just amazing Hallelujah
[1:22:19] and she said prank your boy
[1:22:22] you remember me and he said no she said
[1:22:25] I'm the woman
[1:22:27] I'm the woman
[1:22:29] that you came and spoke to and I
[1:22:33] insulted you
[1:22:36] and she said
[1:22:38] I'm here to tell you today
[1:22:40] that you were right
[1:22:43] because God was dealing with my life
[1:22:46] and God was God the Deep was called to
[1:22:49] the Deep and and it was Poland and they
[1:22:53] said water spout God was reaching down
[1:22:55] for them
[1:22:57] the bull in my life
[1:23:00] and she said you told me that
[1:23:02] and I insulted you
[1:23:06] and she said when I rejected God that
[1:23:08] last time that was my day
[1:23:12] that was my day
[1:23:14] Church don't miss your day don't miss
[1:23:17] your calling
[1:23:19] don't miss your election
[1:23:22] he said this he says this and I don't
[1:23:24] have a great point he says never shut
[1:23:29] the Holy Spirit never shut him down
[1:23:33] you'll only shut him down
[1:23:37] one too many times
[1:23:39] I don't have it right here but that's I
[1:23:42] have it here I just don't have anyone
[1:23:45] just never shown you're not
[1:23:47] that woman told the prophets that I can
[1:23:50] see my mom fry in that
[1:23:55] I wouldn't even
[1:23:59] because God was reached down in Amazing
[1:24:02] Grace
[1:24:03] trying to pull her to himself
[1:24:08] and God will not always strive
[1:24:13] she slammed the door
[1:24:16] and he was on the outside of her knife
[1:24:20] forever
[1:24:21] she said I could no more be saved today
[1:24:26] than anything
[1:24:28] because she rejected
[1:24:31] the Deep
[1:24:33] caused that idea
[1:24:38] she said she told me the truth then
[1:24:41] she said my heart has been so hard since
[1:24:44] then that very night
[1:24:46] she said here is the remarkable
[1:24:50] oh I said maybe a little wrong she said
[1:24:52] I see my mom fry in hell like a pancake

[1:27:05] now we're in the New Testament but they

[1:27:12] ways
[1:27:16] by Amazing Grace we have a perfect
[1:27:18] sacrifice in this age
[1:27:20] and God will never be a long ways away
