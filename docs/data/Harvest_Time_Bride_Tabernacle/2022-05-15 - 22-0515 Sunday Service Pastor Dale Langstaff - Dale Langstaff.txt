it's gonna be it's tentatively july 10th but it might get posted july 17th that's that's really flexible on if somebody had a really bad weekend here or we don't want to book the same time as kitchener church is having their grand opening and brother andre petit is going to be with us and he's going to preach on the wednesday night he's going to be kind of here for the week he's going to preach on the wednesday night and then he's going to have a saturday night and sunday morning it's all geared to families and couples amen let's go to revelations 1 1-3 and like i said before we're going to carry on living in god's vision part two and uh it's just beautiful how god brought this to us this morning and or to me this week and it's just really really beautiful one two three vicky the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show to to his servants of things which must shortly come to pass and he sent it and signified it by his angel unto the servant john who bore record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and he that heareth the words of these prophecies and keepeth these things which are written therein for the time is at hand we turn over to romans 9 and i believe i'm going to start well forgive me romans 9 we'll read 10 to 13 i believe i've wished i would have marked that better yes man we're going to read to 13 vicky and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac this is what we've this is our kind of our text for the children not even being born yet neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth hallelujah and it is said unto her that the elder shall serve the younger and it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated lord we ask you to bless this word and may you anoint your word and bless your people this morning as we fellowship around you this morning lord jesus in your name amen you may have your seats please leave that up vicky for a second and just on a side note just uh not we're not preaching about this at all but i haven't changed my opinion of how close the rapture is i seen uh i actually shared back to myself i've seen a video on uh foreign news that they expect a world collapse of the economy they were talking about how broke the world is i believe they said that there was 73 countries that are second-class countries that won't be able to make their debt payments this year some of them have already completely shut down and if you'll notice yesterday the stock markets on four of the biggest stocks in the world fell about one-third amazon fell 31 in one day that ought to be worth a few billion dollars tesla fell 28 in one day amen there was four other ones i don't remember them all so amen amen i want to show you something here and and talking about you are living in god's vision and i want to make it personal to you and i want to really make it personal i want to just show you see here it says here that god this is god himself talk and he said jacob have i love but esau have i hated and i want to show you a paraphrase because satan works through people isaac was a prophet and isaac loved esau so if you've got a brother or sister or even a minister or even the top 10 they think there's a problem with you isaac loved esau and god hated him before he was even born uh-huh i just knocked my socks off here's god's prophet and he never even had it right right wow amen and here we see that it had nothing to do with us and i want to show you that in the vision of god see god seen us before the foundation of the world and what made here what made jacob the god love jacob i want to tell you this morning that you're in you are in make it personal this morning put your name there you're in god's vision you are in god's vision and you say you say well the devil picks on me and i fell down i did something bad yesterday and i did something bad this week you are in god's vision you say how can you i guarantee you thus saith the word of god you are in god's vision so how can you be that clear i have two bible backups to back that up why did god say i love jacob and esau have i hated well if you turned over to genesis 25 and maybe we'll go there genesis uh 25 29 we will see and i'll just paraphrase it before you you can go there genesis 25 29-34 esa never had respects for the birthright you wouldn't be here this morning if you didn't have respects for the birthright see how i said you're in god's vision you are totally in god's vision i can see that you're in god's vision because you have respects to god's vision and i want to show you something else and this just you know when god gives me something you know it's not because it just came like a flood you know my planter broke on friday i went in the house for one hour and had enough messages for a month it was just like god spilled the milk literally watch this you say how could i be in god's vision when paul was on the road to damascus and god struck him down with the bright light watch this now and god and and paul said lord who are you now before we go any farther with the scripture i want to say was jesus on the earth at that time i'll answer that for you he was not [Music] paul was called after jesus had been raptured back to glory and paul asked the lord he said lord who are you and he said i am jesus whom you persecute and if you read two or three verses ahead of that he was persecuting the disciples and the believers and he had actually went to the chief governors to get permission to do that so are you in god's vision you are she i don't think you're fully getting it god god almighty you know the bible says that god is a spirit let me i i better rephrase god is a spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth god himself said in the word of god that you this morning are just as much jesus as jesus was jesus hello it wasn't a preacher that said i am jesus whom you persecute jesus was not on the earth for all the jesus only people or the people that want to love his flesh maybe you better start loving me and you and the believers and the disciples because god said i am jesus that's a pretty open door whom you persecute that came straight from god now let me just the bible says that jesus was born for a purpose for a vision for a purpose that god was going to do now but you're jesus god said you were jesus man living in the vision totally born totally born for a purpose let me show you something the prophet said the greatest thing that the devil is against today the greatest thing just one thing he's not against you and he's not against me not the greatest the greatest the greatest thing that satan's against please get this the greatest thing is your belief that you're jesus whoa the greatest thing the only he's not against this church he's not against us gathering he's not against us having hamburgers on the fire he's against you believing this is how the prophet said your revelation that jesus christ is the same yesterday but he is today and jesus had came to earth and was gone was gone was gone and god said jesus is here wow when i saw that i just about did a he said cain did an offering at the altar and he belonged to the church denomination kneeled the altar he paid worship god pays his tithing and all that and he said if god required it if that's all god required god would be duty bound to accept king's sacrifice but you see the whole secret is a revelation and revelation is your belief revelation is belief you can't have faith without revelation you can't believe god's god you've got to start believing in yourself boys and girls like brothers and sisters it's just straightforward when you study this out man if you realize that you could say to this mountain mountain i don't like you there step aside he said if god required uh sorry he said the whole secret was revelation and he said this is there's where the trouble is the people don't understand the whole church of the living god is built upon spiritual revelation of jesus christ who did god say christ jesus was but you say well you know i know who my daddy is and prophet's poorly received in your own land you don't even believe in yourself well you know i went to work yesterday you know david david when he was watching his dad's sheet david was living in god's vision when david was killing the lions god was practicing them up to kill a goliath the prophet said that we're in we're in child training he was physically living in god's vision every single day go to the bar to feed the cattle boys it's totally living in the vision totally because when when his dad said back at lunch i packed a lunch a month back to lunch and take it to your brothers you say well i was just a little boy packing lunch god don't care about little boys oh you're so naive and that packed lunch was the deliverance for israel in that time they couldn't have got delivered without a packed lunch because everybody else never had a spine they never actually had revelation and they were scared to death of life because see they didn't think they were jesus and if they don't believe they were jesus well then they're not jesus because faith without belief i mean you're saved by faith it's revelation and so the pack lunch the packed lunch was living in god's vision he just parked the lines of pocket lights and you're just parking lunches going to school work you're just packing a lunch and you're not you're not looking to the right nor the left and you've got and god's just walking you right into almighty glory and he's just packing a lunch he's like his brother's accused of him having a big agenda and all that david was just packing a lunch but he heard the enemy and he had something that nobody else in israel had at that time he had something that no other man in israel had and it wasn't muscle and it wasn't intelligence and it wasn't because he growed up and matured he just simply had revelation that who is this uncircumcised fake philistine and all the fightful ministry and all the believers in the church never had that revelation church it just blew my mind our prophet said the prophets are born prophets you know people will say i want to pray to the guys of abraham isaac and jacob abraham isaac and jacob and isaac believed exact opposite of god think about that when you want to go do something for god and find preachers tell you you're off the word just think of isaac just think of jacob he was a rotten kid he was i mean he needed um the five hands of grace praise the lord my dad's big hand he was a snot-nosed sniveling sissified lazy lion cheating deceitful rotten rotten rotten kid careful you might have had somebody tell you that you're a deceit lion done terrible terrible and god said i love jacob i just love jacob let that sink in for a minute he he he didn't just lie he premeditated lies i mean he he thought about him i'm lying intentionally tomorrow i mean serious prenet and god loved and the honest upright blessed turned around caller with a nice hairdo preacher isaac that just was a man and did his hunting and worked hard with his hands and provided for the family and did all these wonderful things and isaac loved him god said before he was born i hated that kid wow let me tell you something i'm going to shock you if god shows you something don't lean too heavy on the minister that tells you the opposite isaac you want an example isaac isaac before they were born god loved jacob election before you were born god loved every one of you here today and many are the ones that would be here that are out and the reason being is you show respect to his holy spirit respects i never even said you had it which i believe you do but in this case it wasn't given yet it just showed respects living living god's a paradox and you might think you've went too far your kids are something that they could be packing the lunch they could be packing the lunch that will deliver all of ontario it could be packing the lunch that could deliver all your family it could be packing a lunch it could deliver all the church it could be packing a lunch that takes us in a rapture pack in a lunch packing lunch i want to show you something there wasn't one spec a premeditated agenda in david packing a lunch he just was woke up and he was just doing what he did every day listening to his dad watching some sheep killing a few lions once in a while just for sport and packing the lunch it ain't one speck different watches the greatest tactic i've seen maybe i didn't finish this was the the the revelation of jesus christ jesus said in matthew blessed are you simon barjona for flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you spiritual revelation of jesus christ and god said you were jesus that's what he said the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word is flesh today jesus that that's that's just unbelievable and when we realize that you'll be like walking on the back of the pews and swirling and just you'll be stone drunk stone drunk he said when the word comes to you oh amber great glamour and they're riches and they don't need nothing and their money and all their things that they have and they don't know it but they're miserable blind wretched and naked and they're powdering this and they're patting you on the shoulders and want you to compromise with them all the churches churches that'll want you to compromise you see this even in the day we lived with this that's going around and behind us the last two years and here's the prophet saying about himself he said i was born for a purpose and that was to condemn it and call it out and this is what i'm doing whoa wasn't always flowery for him because there near the end he almost had no place to preach see like the quote we read there earlier jeffersonville he said it's got a he he gave a great big hallelujah and he said here's the secret the words in you you're jesus paul says who am i lord who am i he said i'm jesus who you're persecuted some people would show all kinds of respects to god and we'd eat up god's people and spit them out say none of them were qualified none of them had a life none of them this none of them that i am jesus who you're persecuting they're so so very deceived you say you love me and you hate all my jesuses the bible says you're a liar you see they're putting jesus they're putting god in a body and they want to watch it just we'll just worship this body but we'll kill everybody else around because it's just like we love that body and ourselves oh well no maybe we love our that body and the prophet and then herself and so we'll stay home sit on our couch because like we already have the answers but we'll listen to the prophet and we'll worship that body and jesus will say it's this what he'll say it's very hard to kick against the prince it's very hard to kick against the pricks when the bible says forsake not the assembling of yourself together and all the more like some have but all the more as you see the world economy collapsing in one-third on friday those billion and trillionaires they're going to soon be down to about my wealth they just need a couple 31 days we'll be pretty well equal just let that sink in for a minute 31 percent whoa genesis 25 what ain't god's word just it's just it's just amazing see it's not a religion it's it's just it's genesis 25 29-34 it's just it's just unbelievable and jacob sod potty and esau came from the field for he was faint now he watches jacob was the soft boy esau was the one that was actually out holding down the job that's the one we'd want our daughters to marry be careful it's a paradox man and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee the same this red body for i'm faint wherefore was his name called even adam he said jacob said sell me this day your course his birthright was exactly your holy ghost today it was like it was like they told job curse god and die he said you speak like a woman a foolish one sell me the birthright see back in the old testament days and you could google this so google will tell you it was everything to be born first if you were me in the old testament oh me and me and curtis would be in the same boat we didn't have a fighting chance we were we were like we were just like cannon fodder sell me this day your birthday that was everything just pitch a bowl of soup for a couple million dollars that's almost what it costs to go to the restaurant now here next verse and esau said i wanted you to catch this how how how carefree he was on whether he had the holy ghost esau said behold i am at the point of death and what prophet would it do me if i had the baptism of the holy ghost anyway whoa and jacob said swear unto me this day and he sweared onto him and sold him his birthright onto jacob jacob gave esau the bread and the potting for the lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up and went out his way and thus esau dispersed his birthright wow ain't that an exact picture of this morning it's all right you can turn around look well it doesn't matter if we went to church uh i can get everything i need at home anyway the prophet brought the original seed oh man are they ever deceived the very words that they say they believe will condemn them to death the very words the very words the prophet brought condemn them to death wow god help us you know just this week we were mostly unless you're really close we were talking to people that believe this message and i was stunned and it just show you is show you what this is they had get up early on sunday morning you know what our prophets say about going to church even if there wasn't a church that you believe the same he said i would go to that church and i would keep if they just believe jesus is your savior or something about jesus so i would just take that part but i would show the whole rest of the world which side i was thought oh we don't believe that part if you think we do just take a look around the pews we don't believe that part this family get up early because they both have jobs they went up to costco now every single person that seen them at costco at eight and nine o'clock on a sunday morning knew they were not going to church they listened to they grabbed some message on the way home from costco and then they come over to visit us that night why would you why would you bother going to church wow see birthright let me put it into the bible standpoint why i'm almost daddy what good would it do me to go to church so i'll just take your bowl of soup and you can have what all that other stuff that you want like you think god was so which he wasn't that he made a five-fold ministry for people that say they believe in the god not to come and hear the fivefold and do you think god anointed david like the the god of the anointing went on the men of old to write the holy scriptures as they were inspired of god and david wrote for say 97 and i was glad when but let's go to costco let's just all go to costco tomorrow like next sunday i'll meet you there at 9 30. but what's that show the world where's your testimony where's your life oh bless god i got the holy ghost nobody else knows you do they think you got the devil ghost love not the world nor the things of the world love not costco on sunday morning but love coming to the house of god on sunday morning wow amen see before before we go it'll be great and you know what you read you've seen that quote i read and the prophet said he said they'll try to get you to compromise with their doctrine or dogma and they'll pat you on the back and say well you know like like well we we're where why the prophet is my pastor i believe in spiritualism talking to the dead it's witchcraft an abomination see because they're they're thinking with they're not thinking with their heart they're not saying it was god's word and these are the ones that are supposed to be on our side they're supposed to be on god's side like the other ones they're just like way over there wow see that's why god said before they were even born esau i hate because he didn't like to go to church to worship but jacob he loved worship he loved cooking meals and having a fellowship that's where it's at man that's part of it wow let's just look for here quick let's go to acts nine uh nine four and five and then thirteen and sixteen just to see this just to nail this down and we'll shut her down ain't ain't just some you are packing a lunch for jesus today you're sweeping the fellas it's like god has it's not just the broom it's not just the lunch it's what god has in the plan of where you're going you're going to get groceries but somebody's going to see you and they're going to i should ask god and like them and everybody you talk to you it's not about a preacher it's you you go to the home schooling group or hear that and people walk the neighbors and that that's why our light shines don't hide your light under the bushes and don't let the world blow it out it carries to the world here here we just read this scripture and i know i already recorded it by thing but here's examples of you are totally living in god's vision for two scriptural facts you have respects to the promise i mean you say more you have the promise you have the promise and god himself called you jesus here's paul he's talking about paul and paul and paul fell to the earth and heard the voice saying unto him saw saul why persecute let's go back one because it might talk about the light and as he journeyed this is paul now he had already been to the governors actually let's go to the first because it shows us who he's persecuting sorry vicky i've read this and i got it but i just want you to see that i'm not making this up and saul yet uh uh breathing out uh bla threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord like would that be all right to say that was believers it sounds fairly fair to me and i went up to the high priest so when i said that about ministers he went to the religious people to get permission to kill god's people sometimes the ministers do that the false ones and and desired of him letters to damascus and to the synagogues that if he found any of the way whether they were man man okay or women we okay but there's not women preachers so see this is really group in the church see this was paul trying to kill believers okay we definitely established because because there's no way that there would so it wasn't just paul killed ministers you see it was just standard believers you might as well say whether it be men women or children i was just thought really that he might bring him bound to jerusalem oh oh yeah because they're really backslid and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shineth around him a big light what was that like the same light that led the children of israel out of egypt it was the same light that was over brother abraham's head it was the same it was a pillar of fire the same pillar of fire that moses seen in the burning bush it was the same one that it was oh man hello it was god it was the spirit god is the spirit what do you want to put god in you could put god in anything god was in the wind god was in the fire that stopped the egyptians when it was night and it came right up the chariots of fire before they crossed the sea before the sea opened god was in the twig that moses put across the sea and said open the waters man god was in the rod that he took back to egypt when he put in the holy their air put in the holy holies and butted after it been cut out for days but god's in you the same god that made that old dad rod bud the same god that made the the prophet's bones when they threw the soldier in and made him come back to life okay this is what this is we are going to close this this is what satan's against you believe in it's the same today that's what he's against you say oh bless god those are all really nice stories and i believe they all happen and i believe all that but not today oh yeah yep yep hell will have to get a little bit bigger for those people oh yeah oh yeah it was all good with jesus and those prophets i believe they threw them on the bones and i believe the fire and i believe the twig opened the red sea and i believe god fed the ravens to the prophet and oh yeah he did all that kind of stuff then but now in inflation no no well it's different because we got like we got like credit cards oh well we better make hell a little bit bigger see it's on belief it's just it's just flat on belief and there's no revelation with unbelief belief and revelation are buddies they're one in the same faith revelation amen faith revelation and believing are all one in the same you can't have one without the other there was god that came down it just in that time it was god in a light this morning it's god in bodies amen next one sorry john all right now now now here's paul killing the christians but he recognizes the light is god that's unbelievable he didn't recognize the christians as being god but he recognizes a bright that's like oh how you doing god is that light but there's some people that would do that they'd worship that light but then they would eat up their brothers and sisters behind their back and tell them how and i remember and huh be careful and he found the earth and said heard was a loud voice said saul saul why persecute thou me the bright light can god still speak out of lights if he did then he can still do it again today and he said why now this is this is god and he said why art doubt lord who out our lord this is paul sorry i said who is the lord and the lord said here's the lord saying he said i am jesus whom thou persecuted now we just read literally four verses back where he was persecuting women and children of the disciples of the lord i'm jesus and it's hard to kick against the pricks it's very hard to go against god's word and say you're a believer let's go to 13 and 16. we're close with this we'll just accident the same yep and emmaus here here's so paul's getting converted now and paul had a reputation of of like shortening people's necks like cutting their throats the bible says that killing people and god talked to emmaus which was a good believer in the day and he said emmaus i want you to go and talk to paul and they made he said whoa whoa lord we understand and totally this is the back scriptures i want to close today but he may like he may watch this we do this to god you know say but but god do you remember like this person do you know his past ain't that cute we're like little ants to god and we think he forgot he made paul we're little ants now i want to prove to you real hard that you're in the vision and if god tells me again to preach it next sunday i'm just going to put a 3 behind it and amos answered and said lord but i've heard many things of this man and how he did evil and hath done to thy servants in jerusalem now was paul killing he was killing the servant the saints sorry the saints i said servants he was killing the saints and god said they were jesus we got that now is that fair to say then we're jesus today we're saints so we're jesus is that that's fair that's fair okay and here he has authority from the chief priests the binding call of the all by thy name and the lord said unto him go thy way for he's living in the vision no no just wait a minute he paul's living in the vision killing christians wow so the next time somebody tells you i remember when you did something and i won't associate with you because i'm higher than you that's so sweet because the bible says not to put respecters of persons because it's sin it makes you guilty of the whole law means that you'll be in hell too if you ever showed respects to persons you know the bible mentions that multiple repeated different times respects the persons and god told ame amos and all right sorry thank you god told him he said he is a chosen vessel whoa i i'm pretty confident here there was none of us took our life agenda to killing saints so is it hard to believe that you're a chosen vessel you just did a little boo-boo paul was like premeditated i want to kill him god said he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear the name before the gentiles and kings and children of israel wow and i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake see ain't that a paradox what it looks like to the outside man god's eyes you can come honey paul was living the vision joseph was living the vision in prison david was living the vision packing a sandwich and i didn't get half my notes because i was going to go into some of the visions that the prophet showed i want you to remember this if i'm not even preaching next sunday i don't think but if we come back to this no one in the vision no one can take your place i i want to just give you one short paraphrase if we minister on this again i want to show you visions that the prophet had and mistakes he made in the vision because he didn't give enough time for the vision to come a pass by other people doing it and he says in the visions he said there was no way i could tell those people to do what they had to do so when you put on a checkered shirt in the morning or you go move a pail of feed or you move a rake that's in the yard you're living in god's vision prophet said different ones where he's seen a visionary go into a house and there was a rake laying on the yard there was a bible on the stool inside and a lady had to come to the door in a red sweater he said i couldn't say thus saith the lord until all three of those things fell into place and he said neither could i go tell them to move the rake oh buddy i would have wanted to move the rage like just move that right just move maybe it was just a little boy or a little girl that was going to move the rape and they were just as much a part of that vision as the prophet saying you're healed because i'll show you later where he got ahead of it and it didn't work amen ain't that powerful we're living we're today we always heard it said but we're living we can stand you're living right out of god's visions and you you just thought you were going to work you just woke up you know and you just thought that you know i'm going to plant corn today if the planter don't break the third time but god heads break planter to have me sit down for one hour to give me a month of messages about moving a rake and how even the prophets thought different than god because they they didn't see the vision the same way as god did oh that just makes me go that when all hell comes against you god's got a vision and you're right in that vision it's so you don't have to it it'll it'll just happen you know it's like this is like god you know he's seen the video already and if you're like me i want to tell what's going to happen in the book or the video but he's just sitting there he's you know we used to read a book and i tell them when your kids say don't tell me i won't read the book if you tell me i said god he already read the book and he's waiting for a little girl to move the rake or a little boy to pack a lunch it'll change the whole world like we said on mother's day he was waiting for one woman to clean out a stable to get a dwight moody to save a million souls wow wow that that's that's not religion that's just god's election predestination it's beautiful hallelujah hallelujah let's sing what do you play every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every love you
