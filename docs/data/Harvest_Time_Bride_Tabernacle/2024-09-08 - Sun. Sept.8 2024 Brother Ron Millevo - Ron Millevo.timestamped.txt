[41:14] kingdom for himself in the Millennium

[42:00] spoken unto us by his son whom he had
[42:04] appointed air of All Things by whom also
[42:08] he made the worlds in another scripture
[42:11] John 1:18 no man had seen God at any
[42:14] time the only begotten son which is in

[43:37] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[43:39] foundation of the world and the prophet

[44:18] amongst us get glory for yourself we
[44:21] pray in Jesus name amen and amen amen
[44:25] God bless you you may be seated once
[44:28] again praise the Lord so I would like to
[44:31] start with uh you know God
[44:34] dwelling in heaven praise God I believe
[44:37] the Bible said in Isaiah 66 verse1 thus
[44:42] said the Lord the heaven is my Throne
[44:45] right and the Earth is my foot stol you
[44:48] see God is omnipresent he could be
[44:51] everywhere amen he could speak in heaven
[44:53] we could hear the words The Voice here
[44:56] on Earth
[44:57] he said where is the house that you
[44:59] build me so we believe that uh the
[45:02] building is not his house amen I believe
[45:05] we are the Temple of the holy spirit
[45:07] amen Jesus amen is the temple of God the
[45:10] image of the invisible God and that's
[45:13] why he's asking where is the place of my
[45:15] rest amen the place of his rest is among
[45:20] his people praise God in the heart of
[45:23] his people the prophet said that there's
[45:25] a a a small amen uh occupation space in
[45:29] your heart there there's no blood in it
[45:31] amen that is the occupation of the Soul
[45:35] amen and the soul is where the seed germ
[45:37] lays amen the seed The Incorruptible
[45:40] seed that come that came from God that's
[45:44] why the prophet said amen that your soul
[45:47] amen is a part of God displayed here in
[45:50] a body amen so now we can see here that
[45:55] uh God is a spirit
[45:57] amen and they that worship Him must
[45:59] worship Him in spirit and in truth Amen
[46:03] in 1 Timothy 616 it says that God dwells
[46:06] in the light he has the only one who had
[46:10] immortality 1 Timothy 616 dwelling in
[46:14] the light amen we see the pillar of Fire
[46:17] coming Amen in our day through the
[46:20] messenger a light which no man can
[46:23] approach unto which no man had seen nor
[46:26] can can see to whom be honor and power
[46:30] Everlasting praise the Lord so we can
[46:33] see the same Pillar of Fire in the time
[46:35] of Moses the burning bush I believe amen
[46:39] it was God calling Moses Amen to deliver
[46:42] the people of Israel from perrows from
[46:45] from bondage amen it was the same Pillar
[46:48] of Fire that wrote the Ten Commandments
[46:51] on Mount Si right Amen brother Ram said
[46:54] and God can write he wrote The Ten
[46:57] Commandments with his own
[46:59] finger quoting it from events made clear
[47:02] by prophecy he wrote on the walls of
[47:05] Babylon remember the Old Testament alone
[47:07] 2,000 times the prophet said thus sayith
[47:10] the Lord God can can speak God can write
[47:15] hallelujah amen then later on we can
[47:17] find that this light praise God Amen
[47:21] went and uh and uh guided the people
[47:25] amen through a pillar fire as it's
[47:27] written in Exodus
[47:29] 13:21 it says and the Lord went before
[47:32] them by day in a pillar of cloud we've
[47:35] seen that cloud in 1963 right amen and
[47:38] to lead them by the way and by night in
[47:42] a pillar of fire to give them light to
[47:45] go by day and night so amen so God was
[47:49] with them God dwelt in that Pillar of
[47:52] Fire the logos amen and that that uh
[47:56] Pillar of Fire guided them amen God gave
[47:59] them Mana amen that they don't have to
[48:01] cook their food every day amen God gave
[48:05] them that rock of uh you know that rock
[48:08] that that Gast out with water that can
[48:11] feed two million people alongside with
[48:14] the animals in a day so imagine what
[48:17] kind of rock was that amen so praise the
[48:20] Lord so God Amen is able to provide all
[48:24] our need according to his riches in
[48:27] glory he will never forsake his children
[48:30] just like we sang a while ago amen David
[48:33] said I I was young and now I am old I've
[48:35] never seen amen the righteous forsaken
[48:39] nor his seed be begging bread amen
[48:43] praise the Lord now we can see that the
[48:45] second Tabernacle that God dwelt in was
[48:48] in the tent of Moses it was called the
[48:51] shikina glory amen he was the one that
[48:55] came down on the tent and he was in that
[48:58] Holy Place wherein the high priest would
[49:01] uh offer sacrifices every year amen and
[49:04] that tent was divided as you know into
[49:06] three amen segments the outer Court the
[49:11] the holy place which is the inner court
[49:13] and the holy of holies and we can find
[49:16] that in the alter Courtyard amen that is
[49:19] where they they they wash the sacrifice
[49:21] the high priest would come and burn it
[49:24] amen at the altar of burnt offerings and
[49:27] then come inside the holy Place wherein
[49:30] you find the the minora the seven
[49:32] Candlestick in there the altar of
[49:34] incense and the table of shbr but the
[49:38] innermost part wherein there's a veil in
[49:40] there amen is the she kind of glory amen
[49:44] the presence of God was there Hallelujah
[49:47] and you can find there amen the Ark of
[49:50] the Covenant inside the Ark of the
[49:52] Covenant was the pot of Mana amen the
[49:55] the the uh we can find there the the the
[49:58] taets of stone and you know the aon's
[50:01] rod blossom in the presence of the shik
[50:04] glory amen praise the Lord in the Mana
[50:07] never R Amen in that presence of God in
[50:11] there amen let's read some
[50:14] quotation said the high priest once a
[50:16] year went in one time a year with a
[50:20] blood before him see nothing but the
[50:23] blood for without the shedding of blood
[50:26] there no remission of sin but before it
[50:29] was animals amen goats and you know Rams
[50:32] and and uh bulls and it said he
[50:36] worshiped in the shik and Glory all
[50:38] anointed walking he had garments on that
[50:41] had a pomegranate and a bell and he had
[50:44] to walk with that in such a step that
[50:47] played holy holy holy unto the Lord and
[50:52] holy unto the Lord packing the blood
[50:54] before him as he went because we know
[50:57] that uh amen when Adam and Eve sinned
[51:00] amen it required a blood sacrifice and
[51:04] so the priest every year we go there
[51:06] let's continue with another quote he
[51:08] went there and offered the blood The
[51:10] Mercy Seat once a year yes and while he
[51:14] was in there he was privileged to see
[51:15] the shikina glory when the pillar of
[51:18] fire the umber light that come down that
[51:21] led the children out of Israel he even
[51:24] smoke up the temple so no one could see
[51:26] it
[51:27] the glory of the Lord fell till he was
[51:29] all smoked up and he came in himself
[51:33] went in behind the veil and settled down
[51:35] on The Mercy Seat in the holiest of
[51:37] holies amen Most Holy place called holy
[51:41] of holies so what happened in there as
[51:44] the prophet said amen praise God the
[51:47] contents of the Ark as we see there was
[51:49] the pot of mana and he said here amen
[51:52] the golden pot God told Moses and Aaron
[51:55] to make a great golden pot full of Mana
[51:59] Amen in the holiest of holy amen praise
[52:02] God and there it never failed it never
[52:05] got old it never lost its sweetness it
[52:09] was always good inside there amen when
[52:12] we know in the wilderness it only was
[52:15] good for one day it rotted and you have
[52:17] to get another amen Mana the secondary
[52:20] but here it remains sweet amen it said
[52:24] never got old it's always is fresh under
[52:28] the presence of the shik glory and if we
[52:31] can be under that shik glory be fresh we
[52:35] will be amen Born Again amen we will
[52:38] have joy am we will never feel you know
[52:42] uh worriness and things like that always
[52:46] fresh and anointed under that CH kind of
[52:50] glory amen and the aons rod brother
[52:54] randam said here in why people so toss
[52:57] about they took Aaron's rod and laid
[52:59] Aaron's rod in the presence of the Holy
[53:01] place and when they did in one night's
[53:04] time it bed Blossom and yielded almost
[53:09] in one night's time my praise the Lord
[53:12] think of it in the presence of God this
[53:14] old dead Rod laying there in the
[53:17] presence of God bed Blossom and yielded
[53:20] alons in one night I believe the same
[53:23] holy spirit amen if the Holy Spirit
[53:26] would come unto a Christian amen you
[53:28] bear the fruits of the Holy Spirit you
[53:31] will have love joy peace longsuffering
[53:35] amen gentleness weekness Faith amen
[53:38] those are the fruits of Jesus Christ
[53:40] amen in our lives amen so now King
[53:45] Solomon built a concrete Temple for it
[53:48] as we know David tried to build amen a
[53:51] temple but God Amen was not yet it was
[53:54] not yet the time that was there there
[53:57] was usza who was uh you know helping you
[53:59] know that Ark not to Tumble down but he
[54:02] he died because amen he was not a levite
[54:06] Amen to hold those uh that Holy thing
[54:09] amen so we can see here in First Kings 9
[54:14] 1-3 it says Solomon had finished the
[54:17] building of the house of the Lord and
[54:19] the King's house and the Lord appeared
[54:21] to Solomon the second time and the Lord
[54:24] said I have hallowed this house which
[54:27] thou Hast built to put my name there
[54:30] forever and mine eyes and Mine Heart
[54:33] shall be there
[54:35] perpetually that's why Israel is trying
[54:37] to build the Third Temple now it was
[54:40] destroyed I believe in the time of
[54:41] General Titus amen 870 when all the Jews
[54:46] amen were persecuted and they were
[54:48] scattered in different uh countries in
[54:51] America and now they're coming back to
[54:54] meet their Messiah the 44,000 I believe
[54:58] amen we'll be soon in there we can see
[55:01] our time pie is Israel and we can see
[55:04] the war in Gaza you know Hamas heah amen
[55:07] Iran is trying to gang up now on Israel
[55:10] amen it will be time for us to go home
[55:13] in very soon because God cannot deal
[55:17] with the Jew and the Gentile at the same
[55:19] time amen the last predestinated seed
[55:22] from amongst the Gentile has to be found
[55:25] and then we will go home in a Rapture do
[55:27] you believe that sir glory to God
[55:30] hallelujah so but sin was never resolved
[55:34] by the offering of animal blood amen we
[55:37] can read it in Hebrews
[55:40] 104-113 this is now the the turning
[55:42] point for God because no man was able to
[55:45] obey the Ten Commandments to the fullest
[55:47] he gave them the Ten Commandments but
[55:49] David committed adultery Moses even
[55:52] killed an Egyptian and the Bible said
[55:54] thou must not kill thou should you know
[55:57] Thou shalt not commit adultery amen we
[55:59] know Samson fell for Delilah see amen
[56:03] Jacob in even lied or deceive his his
[56:06] father Abraham lied that his his wife
[56:09] was his sister see see there was no one
[56:12] worthy so God has to come now in person
[56:16] himself Amen to pay the price of sin and
[56:20] so Hebrews
[56:22] 10:4 it says in verse 4 for it is not
[56:26] possible that the blood of go bulls and
[56:29] of goats should take away sins in burth
[56:32] offerings and sacrifice for sin thou
[56:34] Hast had no pleasure and every priest
[56:38] has stand this daily ministering
[56:41] offerings often time the same sacrifices
[56:44] see which can never take away sins but
[56:48] this man verse 12 who is this man Jesus
[56:52] our lord and savior Hallelujah after he
[56:55] had offered one sacrifice for sins
[56:58] forever sat down on the right hand of
[57:01] God we know the right hand is power and
[57:04] authority by one for by one suffering he
[57:08] ha perfected forever Hallelujah them
[57:13] that are Sanctified hallelujah amen he
[57:16] took our sins away amen amen the Bible
[57:20] said in Isaiah 53:5 he was wounded for
[57:24] our transgression Jesus amen was bruised
[57:28] for our iniquity the chastisement of our
[57:31] peace was upon him and by his stripes we
[57:34] are healed we are free we're saved amen
[57:37] we have been forgiven Justified
[57:40] Sanctified amen and now filled with the
[57:43] holy spirit amen glory to God now see so
[57:46] the third Dwelling Place of God was his
[57:49] son Jesus a body that has been prepared
[57:53] for God to dwell in amen let's read some
[57:57] scriptures Isaiah 9 96 the Old Testament
[58:01] has prophesied the coming of Jesus for
[58:05] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[58:08] given and a government shall be upon his
[58:13] shoulder amen and his name Shall be
[58:16] Called wonderful counselor Mighty God so
[58:20] the son will be Mighty God the
[58:22] Everlasting father the prince of Fe
[58:26] so praise God we can see here the
[58:29] revelation of the godhead we cannot see
[58:31] two persons here no we see two offices
[58:35] the fatherhood and the sunship amen
[58:37] becoming one Jesus said I and the father
[58:40] are one he that had seen me had seen the
[58:43] father for no man had seen God at any
[58:45] time amen praise God
[58:48] here in 1 Timothy 3:16 it it has been
[58:52] made clear and without controversy
[58:56] no debate no argument amen great is the
[59:00] mystery of godliness so it's a mystery
[59:03] it's hidden from the eyes of the simple
[59:05] man God was manifest In the Flesh amen
[59:11] God coming down in flesh in unveiling of
[59:14] God brother Ram said not is Jehovah of
[59:17] the Old Testament is Jesus of the New
[59:21] Testament wow he's the same God just
[59:24] changing his form
[59:27] amen let's read some more he said here
[59:28] in unveiling of God God veiled in Jesus
[59:33] to do the work of redemption at the
[59:35] cross God could not die in the spirit
[59:39] he's Eternal but he had to put on a mask
[59:43] Hallelujah and act the part of death
[59:46] right he did die who died God died for
[59:49] you in flesh form amen he couldn't do it
[59:53] in his God form yeah he had to do it in
[59:56] sun form as a son of man on Earth Amen
[59:59] in the talken he said that's exactly
[1:00:02] what he was we handled
[1:00:04] God the Bible said amen he repeated the
[1:00:08] scripture without controversy great is
[1:00:10] the mystery of godliness amen we handled
[1:00:13] him with our hands that body was
[1:00:17] God see it was not a a product of Mary
[1:00:21] and Joseph no it was God himself
[1:00:25] creating his own blood cell the sperm
[1:00:27] and the Egg amen he was God all over in
[1:00:30] the form of a human being wow it's
[1:00:35] really a mystery to some people they
[1:00:37] couldn't faom how God from a spirit form
[1:00:40] could amen take the form of a man but
[1:00:43] here brother random said Jesus was God
[1:00:46] in the form of a man that's right that's
[1:00:50] hard for people to
[1:00:52] swallow he wasn't nothing less than God
[1:00:55] he was God manifested in flesh he was
[1:00:58] the creator in his own
[1:01:01] creation amen he said I believe him to
[1:01:04] be God Jesus Christ so he's not just a
[1:01:07] man yes as a man he he felt you know he
[1:01:11] he got tired but when he he uh arose
[1:01:14] from asleep you know he rebuked the
[1:01:16] winds amen peace be still amen and uh
[1:01:20] the the the uh weather you know followed
[1:01:23] him you know the the winds and the wind
[1:01:26] uh the the the waves amen see he he
[1:01:29] hungered and was looking for food from a
[1:01:32] fig tree but he couldn't find any fruit
[1:01:35] and he cursed the Fig Tre right amen but
[1:01:37] when he preached to 5,000 people amen he
[1:01:40] took two two fishes and five loaves of
[1:01:43] bread and produce 5,000 in amen
[1:01:47] excluding women and children even 12
[1:01:50] basket amen there was an extra one for
[1:01:53] each Apostle as a take home PR
[1:01:56] Hallelujah that is the kind of God that
[1:01:58] we serve Hallelujah he can multiply amen
[1:02:03] anything that you have in your hand amen
[1:02:06] I heard a preacher said God is addition
[1:02:08] and multiplication yes he is not a minus
[1:02:11] or division amen praise the Lord amen is
[1:02:15] the the false Christ that divide the
[1:02:17] church you know amen praise the Lord or
[1:02:20] take away you know the power from the
[1:02:22] church Hallelujah why little Bethlehem
[1:02:25] he said we are not saved by the blood of
[1:02:27] a
[1:02:28] Jew or the blood of a gentile we are
[1:02:31] saved by the blood of
[1:02:33] God he was God nothing less he wasn't
[1:02:37] Jew nor Gentile if he was a Jew or a
[1:02:40] gentile we are all
[1:02:43] lost he was God in flesh that's right I
[1:02:46] don't worship a Jew I worship God when I
[1:02:50] worship Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] Hallelujah you know some some religious
[1:02:56] people say oh you cannot worship a man
[1:02:59] Jesus was a man he died see but brother
[1:03:02] said I worship God when I worship Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ amen because he was God in flesh
[1:03:10] it was Jehovah in a maner let's read a
[1:03:13] quotation because we would like to see
[1:03:15] what the prophet you know the message is
[1:03:18] what brings us back to the scriptures
[1:03:21] amen it should have been striking
[1:03:23] Jehovah a baby
[1:03:27] a baby crying in a Manger Jehovah God it
[1:03:30] ought to have been striking Jehovah a
[1:03:33] teenage boy playing Jehovah driving
[1:03:36] nails as a carpenter oh my above all
[1:03:39] Jehovah nailed to a cross to save
[1:03:43] Sinners it should have been striking
[1:03:46] praise the Lord hallelujah it has to be
[1:03:49] God himself or else all the glory will
[1:03:51] go to someone else amen it has to be God
[1:03:54] himself glorify
[1:03:56] you know brother Bram said God wanted to
[1:03:58] be a savior so there has to be something
[1:04:01] someone that that's going to fall so
[1:04:04] that he can display his attribute as a
[1:04:06] savior amen as a Healer right amen as a
[1:04:09] judge as a king so all this things as a
[1:04:12] father he has to got got to have
[1:04:15] children amen so now let's move
[1:04:18] on
[1:04:20] here he continued on he said God was
[1:04:23] manifest in the flesh it doesn't say a
[1:04:26] thing about a first or a second or a
[1:04:28] third person here it says God was
[1:04:31] manifest in flesh one God that one God
[1:04:35] was manifested in flesh and that oh to
[1:04:37] settle it God came in a human form that
[1:04:41] didn't make him another God he was God
[1:04:45] the same God and it was a revelation
[1:04:48] then it's a revelation now one God
[1:04:52] that's why we have to be baptized under
[1:04:55] one name
[1:04:56] in the name of Jesus Christ the only
[1:04:59] name given on Earth whereby man must be
[1:05:02] saved no other name not the name of
[1:05:05] Jehovah El Shai Elohim or Yahweh it has
[1:05:08] to be in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:11] Christ because when he said baptize in
[1:05:13] the name that's singular and the name of
[1:05:16] the father is Lord the name of the son
[1:05:19] is Jesus the name of the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:21] Christ the anointed one so the name of
[1:05:24] the father and of the son and of the Hol
[1:05:25] holy spirit is Lord Jesus Christ and all
[1:05:30] the Christians in the Bible were all
[1:05:31] baptized in that name you can never find
[1:05:35] anyone in the in the Bible who's been
[1:05:37] baptized in the titles of father son
[1:05:39] Holy Ghost because they the apostles
[1:05:41] needed the revelation of that name and
[1:05:44] they have to T in Amen in Jerusalem for
[1:05:47] 10 days until they be inju with power
[1:05:50] from on high and the teacher the Holy
[1:05:53] Ghost will guide them into all truth and
[1:05:55] would know the name of the father and of
[1:05:58] the son and of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:00] Hallelujah so Prophet The Prophet said
[1:06:03] three offices not three persons amen
[1:06:07] because three persons it's it's po what
[1:06:10] do you call it uh
[1:06:12] polytheism amen see many gods just like
[1:06:16] the the Romans the Greeks they worship
[1:06:18] you know Zeos Jupiter and they tried to
[1:06:21] worship many God they put the name of
[1:06:24] Peter and uh in in in in uh replacement
[1:06:28] of of of Jupiter and and Venus was
[1:06:30] replaced by the name of Mary see and so
[1:06:34] he said here I believe that the tree
[1:06:37] Father Son and Holy Ghost is one and
[1:06:40] they are three
[1:06:41] offices of the one God he live in the
[1:06:45] fatherhood in the pillar of fire he live
[1:06:48] in the sunship in Jesus Christ and he
[1:06:51] lives in now in the Holy Ghost in his
[1:06:54] church
[1:06:55] the same Lord Jesus that was made flesh
[1:06:58] and dwelt Among Us is with us this day
[1:07:02] amongst us in the form of the Holy
[1:07:04] Spirit you know brother Dale you're just
[1:07:07] one person right amen but you're a
[1:07:09] father to your children and you're a
[1:07:12] grandpa to your grandchildren you're a
[1:07:15] husband to your wife and you're a son to
[1:07:18] your father so you have four offices
[1:07:21] brother and God had three offices one
[1:07:24] God with three offices
[1:07:26] Father Son and Holy Spirit glory to
[1:07:29] Jesus amen so we can see here in a
[1:07:31] little chart I I made a little chart
[1:07:33] here you know thanks to the technology
[1:07:35] you know that we can use the monitor you
[1:07:37] know to show our notes yeah yeah and in
[1:07:41] graphics to make it more you know
[1:07:43] understandable simple for people to can
[1:07:45] to see the notes see so Father Son and
[1:07:49] Holy Ghost are titles or offices and see
[1:07:52] the pillar of fire Jesus and the Holy
[1:07:54] Ghost was God above us fatherhood God
[1:07:58] With Us Jesus Emanuel and now God in us
[1:08:03] the holy spirit amen Old Testament New
[1:08:06] Testament and the Seven Church ages
[1:08:09] that's the dispensation of these three
[1:08:10] offices and the name of course is Lord
[1:08:14] Jesus Christ amen the purposes is
[1:08:16] creation for the for the Lord the
[1:08:19] fatherhood and Redemption for the
[1:08:21] sunship and regeneration by the Holy
[1:08:24] Spirit praise the Lord amen can we give
[1:08:27] him a glory brothers and sister amen
[1:08:30] worship him thank God for the Revelation
[1:08:34] amen we're not confused on the godhead
[1:08:37] amen praise God hallelujah
[1:08:42] now Jesus before he has ended up
[1:08:44] promised to send the Holy Ghost we can
[1:08:47] read it in John 16:7 nevertheless I tell
[1:08:50] you the truth it is expedient for you
[1:08:54] that I go away for if I go not away the
[1:08:58] comforter which is the Holy Ghost will
[1:09:01] not come to you but if I depart I will
[1:09:04] send him to you remember Peter never had
[1:09:07] a holy ghost when Jesus was still here
[1:09:10] he even chopped the the ear of a a Roman
[1:09:13] soldier he even denied Jesus three times
[1:09:16] before the Rod he didn't have the
[1:09:18] Holy Spirit he received it on the day of
[1:09:21] Pentecost amen why Jesus said Peter I
[1:09:24] have prayed for you three times he asked
[1:09:26] Peter Peter do you love me and Peter
[1:09:28] said Lord I love you I will do
[1:09:30] everything uh I will not let uh the
[1:09:33] Romans you know catch you and see that
[1:09:36] was his you know his commitment but see
[1:09:39] Jesus said I have already prayed for you
[1:09:41] Peter amen when the when you get
[1:09:45] converted strengthen your brethren amen
[1:09:48] so he had to wait for that Holy Spirit
[1:09:51] baptism on the day of Pentecost because
[1:09:54] before he could get the power Amen to
[1:09:57] stand Amen on the principle of
[1:10:01] Christianity John
[1:10:04] 1417 even the spirit of truit whom the
[1:10:07] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:10:10] him not neither knoweth him but ye know
[1:10:14] him talking to the Believers Hallelujah
[1:10:17] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:10:21] you Jesus said I will not leave you
[1:10:24] comfortless I personal pronoun will come
[1:10:29] to you amen so where is Jesus today in
[1:10:33] spirit form is in our heart amen we have
[1:10:36] become the Temple of the holy
[1:10:39] spirit amen praise God while his body
[1:10:41] sitting on the throne and his father's
[1:10:44] throne but one day in the Rapture that
[1:10:46] body will rise again and will come again
[1:10:49] and we will meet him in the air for the
[1:10:52] Bible said in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17
[1:10:55] to 18 for the Lord himself shall come
[1:10:58] down from heaven with a shout the
[1:11:01] message amen with a voice of the
[1:11:03] Archangel and with the trumpet with the
[1:11:06] trumpet and the dead in Christ shall
[1:11:08] rise first from Pentecost to the 7
[1:11:11] Church ages until now they will rise
[1:11:13] first and we which are alive and remain
[1:11:18] remain where remain in the faith amen
[1:11:21] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:11:23] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:11:27] wherefore Comfort one another with this
[1:11:30] words amen that's our comfort right now
[1:11:33] Hallelujah so the fourth Dwelling Places
[1:11:36] or place of God is the holy spirit or is
[1:11:40] is the the believer where in the holy
[1:11:43] spirit amen comes down on you when when
[1:11:49] you
[1:11:50] repent acts
[1:11:52] 238 Peter said repent and and be
[1:11:56] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:59] every one of you for what for the
[1:12:02] remission of sins that's first and then
[1:12:04] what second you shall receive the gift
[1:12:08] of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen
[1:12:12] for This Promise of the baptism of the
[1:12:15] Holy Ghost is unto you to your
[1:12:18] children's children to them that's are
[1:12:20] far up even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:12:23] shall call amen so the the fourth place
[1:12:26] of God's amen resting place is the
[1:12:30] believer right acts 18 but she shall
[1:12:34] receive the power after that the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost is come upon you yes sir so if
[1:12:41] you're not yet baptized with the Holy
[1:12:42] Ghost you don't have power to serve God
[1:12:46] you don't have the power to overcome sin
[1:12:48] you know people just you know come and
[1:12:51] go you know they have no commitment
[1:12:53] because they have no Holy Ghost yet but
[1:12:55] once the Holy Ghost is in you amen you
[1:12:58] will not be living on your own anymore
[1:13:02] just just like Paul said it is not I
[1:13:03] that liveth but it's Christ Living in me
[1:13:07] Amen in the life that I live I live by
[1:13:09] the faith of the Son of
[1:13:12] God Amen when you say Amen to the word
[1:13:16] brother said it's not you amening it's
[1:13:19] the holy spirit in you saying I wrote
[1:13:22] that word amen I was the one who wrote
[1:13:25] that word see and ye shall be
[1:13:28] Witnesses once you receive the Holy
[1:13:31] Ghost you can have witness amen I I
[1:13:34] heard Jehovah's Witnesses come to to
[1:13:36] know houses and when you ask them are
[1:13:38] you baptized by the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:13:40] know whether I have how can you be a
[1:13:42] witness when the Bible said you can only
[1:13:44] be a witness when you have been filled
[1:13:47] with the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:51] Hallelujah so this light today is again
[1:13:55] indwelling in every born again Christian
[1:13:57] in the form of the Holy Ghost let's read
[1:14:00] 1 Corinthians 6 19 what know ye not that

[1:45:49] ministers who followed him because of of
[1:45:52] the the bread and the you know the
[1:45:53] miracle but later on when he preached
[1:45:56] the third pool he said except you eat my
[1:45:58] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:45:59] life in you said oh are we going to be
