[20:45] ministering this morning amen then we we
[20:48] were at Jared Julie last night and and
[20:52] uh brother Bernard was resting and and
[20:55] we kind of had a vote behind him and
[20:57] said brother L Bernard could Minister
[20:59] this morning you know because I actually
[21:02] believe that any one of you Brothers
[21:03] could come up here and handle God's
[21:06] word I I believe that completely I
[21:10] believe God has that kind of confidence
[21:12] in you let's turn to Genesis
[21:15] 1:26 and then we're going to read over
[21:17] to Ephesians 5 and
[21:20] 21 and I ask you to pray for me it's
[21:23] going to be uh uh just something a
[21:26] little kind of pastorial this morning
[21:29] and I want to title my
[21:33] message Gifted
[21:36] Hands the woman the
[21:41] [Music]
[21:43] bride the woman the
[21:46] bride God said let us make men in our
[21:49] own image our image after the likeness
[21:52] and let them have dominion them is a key
[21:55] part them have dominion over the fish of
[21:57] the sea and over the foul of the air and
[21:59] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[22:01] and every cripping thing that creepeth
[22:05] upon the Earth in verse 27 and so God
[22:07] created man in his own image created in
[22:10] the image of God created he
[22:13] him male and female created he them
[22:19] verse 28 and God blessed them them
[22:24] plural and God said unto them let's just
[22:28] drop to Ephesians 5 and
[22:32] 21 and this is a a popular scripture you
[22:36] know of of husbands and wives and
[22:38] marriage and then it goes into the end
[22:40] you know a great mystery but I just want
[22:42] to read this top verse as we start here
[22:44] submitting yourselves
[22:46] one to another in the fear of God lord
[22:50] Jesus we pray that you just take your
[22:52] word Lord Jesus and may you be with the
[22:55] speaker and the hearer both Lord Jesus
[22:58] in your name we
[22:59] pray amen amen you may have your seats
[23:03] bless you this morning amen I want to
[23:07] minister on Gifted Hands and you know
[23:10] there's a story told in during the World
[23:12] War II and just to to lay a foundation
[23:15] and start our our thought there's a a
[23:18] story told that in in the the process of
[23:21] Hitler and the Germans bomb in a lot of
[23:22] those countries and over there in Europe
[23:25] there in one of the Cities was a statue
[23:28] of
[23:28] Jesus and like most of those cities they
[23:31] were
[23:33] completely
[23:35] liberated
[23:37] destroyed and this statue was also no
[23:40] exception to that it was greatly
[23:42] [Music]
[23:43] destroyed but after the war it was put
[23:48] back together and left in the
[23:52] city but there was one part of the
[23:55] statue that they could not
[23:56] re
[23:59] and that was the
[24:01] hands that was the hands of
[24:03] Jesus and you can look at the scripture
[24:06] and you can see all the things in Jesus
[24:08] Earthly Ministry that he did with his
[24:12] eyes and today the bride of Christ is
[24:17] Jesus hands and so they put a statue a
[24:20] sign on that statue with with the statue
[24:23] of Jesus with no hands and it said
[24:26] today
[24:28] you
[24:29] are his am and you know so many times in
[24:34] our in our life and and I don't mean
[24:37] here personally in this church but in
[24:39] our in our acquaintance and even even
[24:42] around the ranks of the message they say
[24:45] that cautiously and and I hope this is
[24:47] not taken wrong but I I want to deal
[24:50] with a
[24:51] spirit that's too close to
[24:54] us too close to me anyway
[24:58] and that's a spirit that we look down
[25:01] upon
[25:04] women women in the message have become
[25:10] doormats
[25:14] doormats they become second
[25:18] class they have women can't do nothing
[25:21] because they were an
[25:23] afterthought and that's a
[25:26] lie that's Complete lifee because
[25:29] Genesis 1:26-27 say that God made the
[25:32] woman then and he blessed them right
[25:37] period amen and the flesh part of the
[25:40] woman was God's plan it wasn't an
[25:44] thought it was completely God's plan and
[25:47] God made her in such a way that it was
[25:50] perfect to
[25:51] fulfill his
[25:53] plan he plan and if you look down upon a
[25:57] a woman and the bride your bride your
[26:00] wife or you consider them a second class
[26:02] in many places it it's just it's just a
[26:04] non-spoken kind of am man I I know I'm
[26:07] going I'm going out the Lim here but I'm
[26:09] not looking for popularity
[26:12] amen if you do that you're actually
[26:16] making your spiritual life second class
[26:18] to
[26:20] Christ amen God help us and and and and
[26:23] not only that you're actually looking
[26:25] down upon God's actually original plan
[26:30] see God couldn't be how could you be a
[26:32] husband without a
[26:34] woman how could you be a provider
[26:36] without a woman am man you think of all
[26:39] these naturual things but how could God
[26:41] even be
[26:44] God a
[26:46] woman because God's an object of worship
[26:49] and he wanted to be a Healer and a
[26:50] savior and all these things and if it
[26:51] had been for the creation of a
[26:54] woman God would have never been able to
[26:56] achieve the attributes that were locked
[27:00] that's right in
[27:03] [Music]
[27:05] him wow now you know we know in the Old
[27:08] Testament that Moses wrote the New
[27:10] Testament mostly and the Old Testament
[27:12] is law it's just I don't type of
[27:13] everything in the New Testament and
[27:15] we're not throwing that away and and
[27:17] sometimes we will look on of course
[27:19] there's much we can learn from that as
[27:22] types and shadows but we but but Paul
[27:25] wrote the New Testament and Paul brought
[27:28] grace and mercy and see let me let me
[27:32] just fast forward to this brother
[27:33] brother R said 73 times I'm not talking
[27:36] about you
[27:39] [Music]
[27:41] sisters see there's
[27:44] sisters n
[27:47] wom and brother Brown said he said he
[27:50] said when you looking tonight he said he
[27:52] said I'm a known woman
[27:55] hater and you have to when you think
[27:57] deep and you see you know he talked
[27:59] about doctors and if you go to a doctor
[28:01] and you're you're dying and they just
[28:03] give you a pill just just go home here
[28:05] here's an ad takeing ad think I'm musle
[28:08] relaxing no go to a
[28:10] therapist what's my real
[28:13] problem and we see this and all these
[28:15] things
[28:17] see you you got to get to the real
[28:19] problem brother brown right the truth
[28:22] I'm I'm not taking nothing away with
[28:24] brother Brown taking but when brother
[28:26] Brown ministered the the
[28:28] truth the emphasis and what he took was
[28:31] in the wrong place much of the
[28:34] time brother Brown said the reason I
[28:37] have the thoughts that I have for women
[28:40] is because when I was a little boy and
[28:42] my dad was a boat lagger he said I seen
[28:45] young women come in not sisters watch me
[28:49] young women come in with married men and
[28:53] be drunk together and and I have a Thal
[28:56] memorize V and he said they would give
[28:58] the young women coffee to make them
[29:01] sober enough to go home and cook supper
[29:03] for their
[29:05] husband but he said I'm not talking
[29:08] about you young women you young sisters
[29:11] yeah yeah that's right and see let's
[29:13] just turned here to lay a foundation I I
[29:15] feel like I'm losing some of you 2
[29:16] Corinthians 5:17 he said therefore If
[29:19] any man be in Christ that's man or woman
[29:22] man or woman being Christ he is a new
[29:24] creature and the old things have
[29:26] completely passed away and behold all
[29:28] things are brand new
[29:33] yeah and all things are of God including
[29:36] the
[29:37] bride who has reconciled us to himself
[29:41] by Jesus Christ and has given to us the
[29:45] ministry of
[29:47] reconciliation Hallelujah let me just
[29:49] read some quotes that the prophet said
[29:51] here he said but I ain't talk I ain't
[29:54] saying that to you sisters because you
[29:56] all don't don't do
[29:58] that but I'm talking about the
[30:01] women of the
[30:03] word he said here in an uncertain sound
[30:07] in these are both in the 60s he said now
[30:09] silly women now he said that isn't
[30:11] talking to you
[30:14] sisters you know the Bible says you know
[30:16] the difference between a brother and a
[30:20] sister is position yeah and there's one
[30:24] thing that a sister couldn't do in the
[30:26] Bible
[30:28] yes and I was Minister for observe
[30:30] Authority on the word over a Brother Do
[30:33] you know praying a sister praying over
[30:36] the church or a brother is not observing
[30:39] authority over a brother that's right
[30:41] that's actually observing authority over
[30:45] God you know multiple times the go in
[30:49] brother Brown's Ministry I'm going to
[30:50] read him to to Anchor my Foundation that
[30:54] God spoke to a sister and said pray for
[30:57] a need and I won't use the prophet I'll
[30:59] use a sister or a mother and God will
[31:01] heal it and everybody was shocked
[31:03] including the
[31:14] prophet you know I never liked as a kid
[31:17] in M Elementary School I never liked a
[31:20] bully putting down anybody I just that's
[31:23] just disgusting to me it's disgusting to
[31:26] me if I Trav or that you know I go to Le
[31:29] I eat with the
[31:30] kids who's who makes us one Statue
[31:34] higher than somebody else but
[31:37] ourselves we got a low
[31:41] ego Jesus you can't be a sister and a
[31:44] sister can't be
[31:46] you but Christ died equally for both it
[31:51] was exactly the same Calvary it was
[31:53] exactly the same blood and we'll be
[31:56] brothers and sisters in
[31:58] glory they're not going to have a
[32:00] separate spot they're not going to sit
[32:01] at the back of
[32:06] Heaven the Bible talks about that and
[32:08] and and then the message that Christ and
[32:11] the bride were completely one he said in
[32:14] the Masterpiece family that they had to
[32:16] be a completely one being so how could
[32:19] you downgrade
[32:20] one like I don't think less my foot than
[32:22] I do my
[32:26] ear yeah yeah but so many places and I
[32:30] know we can have you know different
[32:31] cultures and different things but we've
[32:34] almost made women second class or
[32:38] property in the ranks of Christianity
[32:40] and that's that's never was God's
[32:43] plan if you if you if you think
[32:47] that answer me this question do you feel
[32:50] that way with
[32:52] Christ do you feel like Christ made you
[32:54] second property to himself do you feel
[32:57] feel like that when he gave you the
[32:58] checkbook that you could sign anything
[33:00] away in the promises of God you feel
[33:03] that way when you think of all the the
[33:05] promises that even in the message in our
[33:06] Prophet C that everything is ours if you
[33:09] just
[33:11] think you feel second
[33:15] class not like believe me this is not an
[33:18] issue here but it's around the world you
[33:19] know you know there's two people in the
[33:21] Bible that I I I found that actually you
[33:24] know and I'm I'm not preaching on this
[33:25] but I'm just mentioning this how how
[33:27] these Spirits rise up and they're
[33:30] man-made Spirits in closed and they're
[33:33] not of God do you know David paid 1004
[33:37] skins I believe it was for his wife from
[33:39] Saul do you know why he paid that
[33:41] because Saul hated David and he wanted
[33:44] David to get killed by
[33:50] himself so God's
[33:52] hatred that was never God's
[33:55] plan
[33:58] Jacob worked two years seven years for
[34:01] his life and then worked another seven
[34:03] CU he got the
[34:06] sisters so if we were going to follow
[34:09] Jacob are we going to have multiple
[34:12] wives That's exactly the same scripture
[34:15] if I could get a wife for seven years I
[34:17] could have
[34:23] two someone would say that that Jesus
[34:26] Paid the price for his pride he paid it
[34:28] to
[34:32] himself who did Jesus send the price to
[34:35] to pay for the Redemption of
[34:39] us because the scriptures say that it
[34:42] was God's Own
[34:44] requirement for
[34:46] Redemption he didn't pay that to Satan
[34:49] that was God's law God had to obey his
[34:52] own law so God paid his own
[34:55] BT
[34:59] that's
[35:01] right God help
[35:04] us God help
[35:06] us
[35:08] amen 57 times he said you sisters he
[35:12] said seven times he said the best thing
[35:14] that God can give a
[35:16] man is something that Satan
[35:22] created
[35:25] really I don't think
[35:27] so in fact I know
[35:31] so the best thing outside of
[35:34] Salvation was a
[35:39] bride man our Prophet was talking about
[35:42] the spare that could get on a woman but
[35:47] you see in second Corinthians this ain't
[35:50] an issue in the bride of Christ yeah
[35:53] because they passed from Death onto life
[35:56] it's a new life and so there's there's
[35:59] no there's not even there's it's it's
[36:02] farther than the East is from the West
[36:04] with the Holy Ghost filed
[36:06] sister she could never be a jezebel
[36:09] never that's right see in Romans 8 it
[36:12] says 32 it says he's already glorified
[36:16] you those he called he PR he likeed he's
[36:20] already called
[36:23] glorified
[36:25] Hallelujah just look at some thoughts
[36:27] that our Prophet said here in marage in
[36:30] Dev ours he said I'm talking about in
[36:33] Marrow now not you
[36:39] sisters but we almost do a carry
[36:45] over let's talk about the sister that
[36:48] was in brother Brown's prayer meetings
[36:51] and
[36:53] die told the
[36:55] sister
[36:57] true to go pray for the woman that had a
[37:01] prayer Pray that was going to go through
[37:03] the prayer
[37:04] L with a sick
[37:11] baby you all know the story she prayed
[37:14] for the baby she got up and gave the
[37:16] mother her seat down close to brother
[37:18] Brown the prophet and she went up in the
[37:20] bleachers in about the fourth
[37:23] row the mother came up she was like 10th
[37:25] or 11 W in line the prayer line and the
[37:29] prophet just started to pray for he oh
[37:31] he said oh that baby's already
[37:33] healed God's already used
[37:36] somebody
[37:40] amen you know I mean ask question when's
[37:44] the last time that you were in a message
[37:46] church and there was an altar call and
[37:49] the minister asked the sisters to come
[37:51] and
[37:55] pray
[37:57] brother Brown did yeah the sisters come
[38:00] pray for the
[38:05] sisters because sisters would know and
[38:08] understand what a sister was at the
[38:09] altar pray for
[38:13] amen oh but bless God bless God that's a
[38:17] brother you got
[38:21] more you tell me the other Prophet was
[38:24] wrong no no he was wrong
[38:28] yeah it was just a spirit of
[38:31] EV and
[38:33] domination
[38:35] yeah this is true our Prophet had off CL
[38:38] with sisters up and he said now you
[38:40] sisters back there you come up and pray
[38:41] for these sisters
[38:44] as in a
[38:51] church the sister pray in
[38:55] ch
[38:58] brother went to pray for the baby and he
[39:01] said oh sister your baby's already been
[39:03] healed she said I see another sister
[39:05] where God laid it on her heart to pray
[39:07] for the sister do you know that sister
[39:09] refused to pray for the baby was
[39:11] tormented in herself and that because
[39:13] she never
[39:15] felt
[39:16] worthy she felt she
[39:19] was second
[39:21] class to the
[39:24] prophet was it God that
[39:29] it was man
[39:31] that it wasn't God it was God tell her
[39:33] to pray for he said I see you sister up
[39:36] in the bleachers up in the the
[39:39] for and he said you could pray for that
[39:42] baby way more than me because you have
[39:48] a mother's
[39:51] heart
[39:55] wow amen
[39:58] God help
[39:59] us he said here now here's the prophet
[40:03] talking I have a couple quotes he's
[40:05] talking about and now and you know I
[40:08] have some daughters St married don't you
[40:09] dare ever ever the Bible's very clear
[40:13] with it when Israel did it he never ever
[40:16] forgave him we never ever are unal yoke
[40:19] together in
[40:22] unbelief ever he said now watch this
[40:25] this is a prophet
[40:26] now I want you to notice that he's not
[40:28] talking about the
[40:31] woman he said a man without the Holy
[40:35] Ghost is a worse than a
[40:41] beast and is one of the only creatures
[40:44] that will take a baby from its mother's
[40:46] arms and throw it in the corner and
[40:51] R the
[40:55] woman
[41:01] wow you sisters that aren't
[41:04] married you want to make sure one thing
[41:06] don't worry if the guy can do nothing
[41:09] but make sure he's got the Holy Ghost
[41:12] you make sure that yeah better you start
[41:15] to death than he not have the Holy Ghost
[41:18] I mean the second thing would be make
[41:19] sure he's got some kind of get up and go
[41:22] but yeah but make sure he's got the
[41:26] you want to pray right through on that
[41:29] part like there's no maybe some show
[41:33] don't look around for around call us
[41:35] just look around for the pure good old
[41:37] fashion
[41:40] ho
[41:41] Hallelujah that's right
[41:45] Hallelujah God help
[41:48] us
[41:50] amen we know we know he goes into that
[41:53] quote in marriage and divorce he talks
[41:55] about American
[41:56] and and it's a A Woman's World we know
[41:59] that we understand that we understand
[42:01] that they worship the woman we
[42:03] understand that yeah but you know our
[42:06] Prophet also told us that he said don't
[42:07] show me a com you know I'm not concerned
[42:11] about what you know and I even makes me
[42:14] throw up to say it but like believe the
[42:16] sign or all these evil things I could
[42:18] care less about what's going I've never
[42:20] ever that if a minister come up here I
[42:23] rebuke him and I did it I don't want to
[42:25] hear about
[42:27] garbage so why we concentrate on garbage
[42:30] that's right that's right there's not
[42:32] one sister in here that acts like a
[42:33] worldly sister so why would we cram that
[42:36] down their throat you know I've had
[42:39] sisters that are here from another
[42:41] country and it ain't Africa tell my wife
[42:44] she said we're so sick of all the
[42:46] ministers do is preach us sisters down
[42:49] and they never ever say this Brothers do
[42:51] anything
[42:52] [Music]
[42:54] wrong and I'll just let you know they
[42:56] were there were Pastor daughters and
[42:58] they left their
[43:02] dad's and this
[43:10] message Brothers can sin just like
[43:13] daughters
[43:15] can
[43:18] amen we I understand perfectly when Adam
[43:22] and Eve were made she was made second I
[43:25] understand she was made so she could
[43:27] fall I want to tell you what she could
[43:30] have never
[43:32] fell if she had the Holy
[43:34] Ghost it's not possible I have quotes
[43:38] for that God knew that the first Eve
[43:41] would
[43:42] fall and I have multiple quotes here the
[43:45] second eeve will never fall it's because
[43:48] predestination it's because she came
[43:51] from God God would have to fall down
[43:54] she's a part of God see what I'm
[43:56] [Music]
[43:59] saying and we need to kill that that
[44:02] evil thing that we're going to you know
[44:05] what I'm
[44:06] saying yeah now I'm not we we know we're
[44:10] in different positions don't you
[44:17] know the Bible says for a minister when
[44:20] he's ministering to be a man of one wife
[44:24] that's pretty clear so that means the
[44:25] wife ain't to
[44:28] heaven the wife ain't going to have a
[44:30] wife so she won't be
[44:32] ministering
[44:34] amen look here in the mysteries of God
[44:37] revealed and then I'm going to read some
[44:39] Masterpiece quotes
[44:42] here he says put God into his body and
[44:45] Christ and and and Christ in the body
[44:48] was the bride and he said it brings the
[44:51] bride out and it won't fall to
[44:53] denominational creats no sir she said
[44:56] she's coming back to the pure on
[44:58] adulterated word of God being manifest
[45:01] and he said in and in 14 115 4:15 sorry
[45:06] she was the second Eve and she's not
[45:10] breaking I just this our prophet in
[45:12] mystery of God revealed
[45:14] 63 and the second Eve she's not breaking
[45:18] or sping her skirts in Purity and
[45:21] Holiness to her husband she'll stay with
[45:24] the word regard of what anybody says and
[45:27] you can have that uh move that you want
[45:32] and all the you can have all the elegant
[45:34] moves you want and all the Affliction
[45:36] she's not
[45:39] moving the reason she's not moving is
[45:41] because she's predestinated and got the
[45:43] baptism of the Holy
[45:46] Ghost it's because of First Corinthians
[45:48] because she's been made a new
[45:51] creature amen so we see the difference
[45:55] in the old Testament and in the New
[45:58] Testament was when the perfect Adam
[46:01] came there was a perfect
[46:04] sacrifice and so in the in the in the
[46:07] garden we were dealing with a nonperfect
[46:10] sacrifice which wouldn't hold the
[46:15] bride
[46:17] Hallelujah and Masterpiece and this was
[46:19] I listened to this last night it's just
[46:21] tremendous it goes and goes he said from
[46:24] the perfe per
[46:26] perfected seed that died there and came
[46:29] back in the perfected seed in the second
[46:31] Adam talking about Christ and he said
[46:34] now it has become the true bride
[46:36] again back to the original word again
[46:42] Hallelujah and he he says here just
[46:45] dropping a couple paragraphs he said The
[46:47] Great Masterpiece family the second
[46:51] Adam Christ and the second Eve now
[46:55] already in the garden the Millennium
[46:57] amen back on Earth Hallelujah he took
[47:01] time as all through the millions of
[47:04] years to form the first perfect couple
[47:07] Adam and Eve and they fell and now it's
[47:11] been through thousands of years that
[47:14] he's molded the second Adam the second
[47:16] bride the second Eve again and now they
[47:19] are ready the Masterpiece has come and
[47:23] stuck down from it struck down from his
[47:26] side is help
[47:28] me Christ help me his
[47:32] hands amen the bride of Christ is
[47:37] Christ's hands on Earth his help man
[47:40] just like in the natur your wife is your
[47:42] help me you can read that in Ephesians 5
[47:45] amen but here here is we have a purpose
[47:49] and a and a and a mold in God Amen God
[47:53] never looked on us like like we have our
[47:55] own man made Creeds and dogmas we have
[47:58] our our cultures could be of
[48:03] Satan
[48:04] am they are of Satan that they're
[48:06] putting down God's
[48:08] creation
[48:10] y God help
[48:13] us the Great Masterpiece family the
[48:15] second Adam the second Eve now already
[48:18] he repeats Us in just a couple
[48:20] paragraphs already in the garden of
[48:21] Millennium amen back to Earth again he's
[48:24] totally repeating it again
[48:26] the great Splendor that they
[48:29] left took them he said now notice this
[48:32] family it's husband and wife cannot
[48:35] truly be a family unless they
[48:39] are
[48:42] one unless they are one and now the
[48:45] Masterpiece family has come again Christ
[48:47] and his bride ready to come the second
[48:50] Adam Christ the second Eve already
[48:53] returned back to their home oh the full
[48:56] picture of redemption it brings it back
[49:00] exactly to the
[49:02] beginning
[49:04] Hallelujah God help us God help us it's
[49:08] so easy to get caught in a religious
[49:10] spirit geds and
[49:13] darkas and and and
[49:19] cultures you know let's just go to
[49:21] Ephesians there and read that scripture
[49:24] and uh
[49:36] actually if you don't mind let's go to
[49:38] Genesis 2:18
[49:40] First Genesis 18:2
[49:43] first sorry and the Lord said and the
[49:47] Lord God said I I want you to to
[49:50] recognize this in my Bible it's got Lord
[49:53] capitalized before God
[49:56] and the Lord God said it is not good for
[49:59] man should dwell be alone and I will
[50:02] make him a help me for him and then if
[50:05] we drop to verse 24 and therefore shall
[50:08] the man leave his father and mother and
[50:10] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[50:13] shall
[50:14] be one
[50:19] person amen let's go to Ephesians
[50:23] 5 and I'd like to read that through
[50:26] the 33 I may I just uh you know we we we
[50:32] angle so much on this but if we we get
[50:35] the whole picture of what God's saying
[50:37] here you know in the end of this he says
[50:39] you know men ought to love their wives
[50:42] as themselves and he says no man this is
[50:46] God no man has ever hated his own
[50:52] flesh what he's saying there is no man
[50:54] has ever
[50:56] put down his own
[50:59] flesh cuz to hate is to push away to put
[51:05] down Christ number did that to us his
[51:11] pride and you'll notice when he searches
[51:13] in Ephesians 5:21 he first makes the men
[51:19] submit and wife to each
[51:23] other but we could concentrate on just
[51:25] the wife being submissive to the husband
[51:27] yes that's
[51:29] true but before he even starts that he's
[51:32] got you being submissive to your
[51:38] wife
[51:40] wow eans 5 and 21 let's just read that
[51:43] submitting yourselves one another in the
[51:46] fear of
[51:49] God wives submit yourselves to your own
[51:52] husband says unto the Lord for the
[51:55] husband hband is the head of the wife
[51:56] even as Christ is the head of the church
[51:59] and the savior of the body now there you
[52:01] go is a perfect scripture for any
[52:04] sisters that aren't
[52:06] married you don't want a beast to be
[52:09] your head no you don't want actually let
[52:11] me rephrase that you don't want worse
[52:13] than a beast to be your head worse than
[52:17] a beast cuz you know most Beast won't
[52:20] grab the babies and kill them to rabbish
[52:22] the mother most most won't
[52:26] but a man
[52:28] will make sure you got the Holy Ghost in
[52:31] that man and yes that that that husband
[52:34] will be your head but his head is Christ
[52:37] and you can go right to the
[52:40] top amen amen therefore as the church is
[52:45] subject to Christ so let the
[52:48] wives be to their own husbands and
[52:52] everything you see Christ is ahead of
[52:55] here it has you know God uses the
[52:57] ministry for their hands it's his hands
[53:01] that's right I'm speaking with my hands
[53:04] but it has nothing to do with Brother D
[53:06] AB if it does you should run for your
[53:09] life because it's Christ that's right
[53:12] it's all Christ it's everything to do
[53:15] with Christ you see how perfect this
[53:17] picture is in places you know we're not
[53:19] beat down but we just recognize that
[53:21] he's our head he's our everything am
[53:24] Hallelujah
[53:25] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[53:28] loved the church and they died for
[53:34] her he gave everything for me and you
[53:40] thank you Jesus that's a long
[53:46] race putting
[53:48] down that he might s sanctify and
[53:50] cleanse it by the washing of the water
[53:54] of the word that he might present
[53:55] himself a glorious church now I want you
[53:58] to show you this you know when God's
[54:00] presenting himself a glorious
[54:04] Church it has a bride in
[54:12] it that he might all those other ones
[54:16] were substitute that if they happen then
[54:19] God can have a glorious
[54:23] church not having sput rank no such
[54:26] thing that it should be holy Without
[54:28] Blame so ought men now he repeats this
[54:31] again he's not talking to the wies no
[54:33] more so ought men to love their wives as
[54:36] their own body and he that loveth them
[54:39] loveth his wife loveth himself now I'm
[54:43] afraid that there's some brothers in the
[54:45] world or even in this message that don't
[54:47] love
[54:49] themselves I'm convinced of
[54:52] that because get me
[54:56] [Music]
[54:58] do hurry
[55:03] up
[55:10] amen Jesus
[55:13] amen for man ought to for man for no man
[55:17] ever yet hated his own
[55:22] flesh but narish
[55:25] it and cherish
[55:29] them even if the Lord
[55:32] does the
[55:34] bride the
[55:37] church
[55:40] wow now this is the third time he's
[55:43] saying
[55:46] this sorry no sorry I just got a
[55:51] double for we are members of his body of
[55:55] his flesh and of his bones that's that's
[55:58] considering the male and The Feminine
[56:02] Spirit together that's right back to
[56:04] Genesis 1 26 let us make
[56:10] man and The Feminine part were together
[56:15] Hallelujah for we are members of his
[56:17] body and of his flesh and of his bones
[56:19] and for this cause shall a man leave his
[56:21] mother and father and shall join to his
[56:23] wife and they shall be one one
[56:26] flesh and this is the part we want to
[56:28] get
[56:30] to this is a
[56:33] mystery it's a great
[56:37] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[56:40] and the church you know as much as it
[56:43] would be wrong for a a sister to
[56:46] minister amen it would be just as wrong
[56:49] for a brother to try to minister to his
[56:51] wife without Christ being his head
[56:53] correct
[56:56] the exact same all
[57:01] done just as it would be wrong for me to
[57:04] share you my thoughts and ideas this
[57:06] morning it would be just as wrong for
[57:08] you individual husbands to share your
[57:10] own thoughts and
[57:13] ideas to your
[57:16] wife cuz you're not your
[57:18] own it's like the brother that came to
[57:20] die when brother BR was dying and it was
[57:22] early in his ministry and brother BR was
[57:24] there and he was he he literally died in
[57:26] a few years and a few hours and brother
[57:28] Brown came to him and he said now what
[57:30] he said tell me everything what's in
[57:32] like to crossing over so what's it like
[57:34] to die oh brother Brown oh brother
[57:44] die yeah so you can't have two husbands
[57:47] at the same time you can't be a
[57:51] jezebel and a holy ghost will person
[57:54] there might be some trying they're
[57:56] they're very easy to spot there you see
[57:58] them coming around the curb 100 miles
[58:02] away if you have any discern the Holy
[58:07] Ghost so what the whole thought is is
[58:11] Christ is telling you this morning you
[58:14] don't need to beat up on
[58:16] yourself as spiritually as the bride
[58:18] Christ never beat up on us amen we don't
[58:21] need to beat up on the sisters that I
[58:23] got the Holy Ghost yeah
[58:27] amen positionally
[58:31] placed for
[58:33] harose I speak concerning this is a
[58:36] great mystery but I speak concerning
[58:38] Christ and the church
[58:41] nevertheless let every one of you in
[58:46] particular love his wife even as himself
[58:50] that is the third time and the exact
[58:53] same chapter the that God tells the man
[58:56] to take care of the sister in love third
[59:01] time he thought we were
[59:03] dyslexic or didn't get it the first time
[59:06] that's not a joke that makes it an
[59:09] important
[59:10] part y
[59:12] y love his own wife as even as himself
[59:16] for the wife should reverence the heaven
[59:20] her husband just like we would reverence
[59:23] and respect our Lord Jesus amen amen
[59:27] amen oh it's it's beautiful amen we
[59:30] don't ever want to to do what God didn't
[59:34] expect us to do I want I want to show
[59:36] you another scripture CU I still feel
[59:38] like I'm losing some of you let me show
[59:40] you an example in Exodus
[59:44] book here's a god- calleded
[59:47] prophet that's the head dog on earth he
[59:50] was God to Pharaoh now you don't get a
[59:53] lot higher than that yeah God told him
[59:55] himself that and the scriptures say that
[59:59] God desired and sought to kill that's
[1:00:02] right kill
[1:00:07] them and our Prophet
[1:00:10] said Hallelujah
[1:00:13] brother that God spoke to his
[1:00:23] wife
[1:00:29] what how could that be she's the weaker
[1:00:32] vessel like she was oh my goodness God
[1:00:36] will never deal through a
[1:00:38] sister if he hadn't dealt through Moses
[1:00:40] wife God would have her killed amen the
[1:00:45] man that's right that that's like a long
[1:00:48] time Ked means you would have
[1:00:53] been
[1:01:03] yeah here I'm just seeing where I want
[1:01:06] to start read let let me just start in
[1:01:08] uh
[1:01:10] 22 here here's God given the purpose for
[1:01:15] Moses Exodus 4:22 and thou shalt say
[1:01:18] unto Pharaoh thus sayith the Lord that
[1:01:20] Israel is my son even my firstborn and
[1:01:24] the next verse and I say unto thee let
[1:01:26] my son go that he may serve me and if
[1:01:29] thou refuse to let him go behold I will
[1:01:33] slay thy son even thy
[1:01:36] firstborn now here's Moses saying this
[1:01:40] to the
[1:01:42] enemy and watch what happens in the next
[1:01:44] verse and it came to pass that by the
[1:01:47] way in the end that the Lord met him and
[1:01:52] S this is
[1:01:55] you see that there and S to kill
[1:02:00] him I I got that's very confusing to me
[1:02:04] how could God have a chosen
[1:02:07] man and want to kill
[1:02:13] him and God the exact same God would
[1:02:16] work through his wife let's say
[1:02:19] brother to save his
[1:02:23] neck
[1:02:28] and his and then in verse 25 and then
[1:02:32] his wife how do you say your name Sabor
[1:02:34] sabora took a sharp Stone and cut off
[1:02:37] the foreskin of the Sun and cast it at
[1:02:39] the feet and said
[1:02:42] surely a bloody husband Thou Art to me
[1:02:45] so let him go and then she said a bloody
[1:02:49] husband Thou Art because of the
[1:02:53] circumcision
[1:02:58] here's what the prophet said in
[1:03:00] questions and answers he said and God
[1:03:01] would have took Moses life but perhaps
[1:03:04] the angel was standing there and said to
[1:03:07] his wife
[1:03:08] Sora do it
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] quick I'm here to kill
[1:03:14] him there was one person on the earth
[1:03:18] that could save Moses
[1:03:23] life and it was a foot down
[1:03:28] sister
[1:03:30] W what
[1:03:32] prop the angel the the angel was there
[1:03:34] to kill Moses yeah and said to his wife
[1:03:39] do catch it quickly that's right catch
[1:03:42] it that's exactly what he says catch it
[1:03:44] quickly and zabor went and circumcised
[1:03:47] the baby and said to Moses our so
[1:03:50] concerned about everything about your
[1:03:53] journey that your own Boy hasn't been
[1:03:59] circumcised
[1:04:00] wow wow see God actually uses
[1:04:06] sisters just like he uses us spiritually
[1:04:09] all together it's his Bri amen see in
[1:04:13] Revelations it said the wife the spirit
[1:04:16] and the wife say come the wife has made
[1:04:19] herself ready she's become the hand and
[1:04:22] she's let the word dress her she become
[1:04:24] the hands and now she's dictating with
[1:04:27] the
[1:04:29] spirit come on yeah
[1:04:34] hallelujah
[1:04:36] amen God help us but to mention here
[1:04:40] this going by the quote of the sister
[1:04:42] that prayed for the the
[1:04:46] baby you know that story very well she
[1:04:49] asked literally asked the sister for
[1:04:52] permission because she so feels out of
[1:04:57] place because she's asking to
[1:05:01] pray I want to ask you a question of
[1:05:04] this show me one place in the Bible
[1:05:06] where God said for a
[1:05:08] sister not to
[1:05:12] pray anywhere yeah for
[1:05:16] anybody
[1:05:18] yeah in any
[1:05:21] circumstances our Prophet said very much
[1:05:24] exact opposite he said you don't need to
[1:05:26] come to me to pray and you don't need to
[1:05:29] come to your pastor even to
[1:05:31] pray your little ones your child or your
[1:05:33] wife could pray
[1:05:42] amen I have another example here we know
[1:05:45] the story of brother brandham and his
[1:05:48] life where he was flying the
[1:05:50] airplane and God brought the airplane
[1:05:53] down
[1:05:58] that wasn't a Brother's prayer that
[1:05:59] brought that airplane
[1:06:01] down I'll just tell you something this
[1:06:04] may shock you but I ain't got a
[1:06:07] testimony that
[1:06:08] good I've never prayed once that I know
[1:06:12] that an airplane can
[1:06:17] down but this is recorded multiple times
[1:06:21] late in their prophet's
[1:06:23] Ministry laid in his
[1:06:25] ministry and this is what he says when
[1:06:28] he goes there you know you know the
[1:06:30] story she calls him Parson and she was
[1:06:32] standing there and God had spoke to her
[1:06:36] and said I'll send a Parson by a
[1:06:38] minister
[1:06:40] by why did God speak to
[1:06:42] her because God never considered her
[1:06:45] second
[1:06:47] class and this is what our Prophet said
[1:06:49] in that he said they came in the house
[1:06:52] and the whole purpose in the Minister
[1:06:54] coming was a brother to pray for her
[1:06:59] boy
[1:07:02] correct brother R said
[1:07:07] sister you pray
[1:07:12] first
[1:07:14] who when was the last time you heard a
[1:07:16] minister say
[1:07:19] that sister you pray
[1:07:22] first
[1:07:27] and your Prophet said
[1:07:30] this said
[1:07:33] instant you could tell that's right that
[1:07:36] she had got to God and instantly you
[1:07:41] could tell that she had a relationship
[1:07:43] with the father a
[1:07:46] sister
[1:07:48] instantly
[1:07:51] instantly she also noticed that she had
[1:07:53] on unconditional love regardless of how
[1:07:56] black her son was her son had lived a
[1:07:58] very dirty sexual life and had a sexual
[1:08:01] disease and was dying and actually in
[1:08:03] the flesh deserved to
[1:08:07] die if you were looking at it just
[1:08:10] naturally she said regardless of
[1:08:15] anything
[1:08:17] anything that's my
[1:08:21] Bo
[1:08:22] period
[1:08:26] period
[1:08:29] wow you know the
[1:08:34] story multiple
[1:08:36] times Auntie you pray
[1:08:41] first
[1:08:45] wow you know the boy brother Brown was
[1:08:48] in the
[1:08:49] area years
[1:08:52] later
[1:08:56] and and the boy come up to him you know
[1:08:58] that part and recognize
[1:09:01] him and said I'm the
[1:09:05] boy that you prayed for and it was
[1:09:08] because a mother but a
[1:09:10] sister had
[1:09:12] prayed
[1:09:14] y amen y that's right I believe just as
[1:09:18] much as it's wrong for a
[1:09:21] denominational a denominational ride you
[1:09:24] know the prophet said different places
[1:09:26] you know you got to you got to study
[1:09:28] them the the theme of how he's bringing
[1:09:32] the message you know the prophet said
[1:09:34] that the first Eve fell in the garden
[1:09:37] but the second Eve would never
[1:09:39] fall that's you and me that's that
[1:09:42] that's the predestinated Bride of CHR
[1:09:45] but he so multiple times that the second
[1:09:48] Eve did
[1:09:49] fall but it was the denominational was
[1:09:53] he said the first one fell in the garden
[1:09:55] and the other one fell in Rome taking
[1:09:59] the laws of men and the Creeds of men
[1:10:02] but the real bride should never fall
[1:10:06] because she's
[1:10:08] predestined amazing grace Amazing
[1:10:11] Amazing Grace amen we we need to really
[1:10:14] watch that we don't put in our own
[1:10:18] thoughts amen you know as a minister
[1:10:21] ministers don't put in any of you
[1:10:24] just Minister watch watch what God has
[1:10:27] and then we don't need to add to what
[1:10:29] God's put there let's just take it
[1:10:31] straight from him amen and we see so
[1:10:35] many amazing parts of this let me just
[1:10:38] read another one here he said what all
[1:10:39] through it the scriptures that was God's
[1:10:43] purpose what was God's purpose it was to
[1:10:46] have a bride yeah you see you know we
[1:10:50] can you see what I'm saying don't we
[1:10:53] don't we don't need to concentrate on on
[1:10:55] a on a worldly Spirit we don't need to
[1:10:58] concentrate on the ones that don't have
[1:10:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:11:01] that's not
[1:11:03] even only God can give them that Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost well let me let me give you this
[1:11:09] if we're if we're ministering to the
[1:11:10] bride that's got a worldly Spirit on
[1:11:13] them and they're and they're living in
[1:11:16] sin you preach all you want won't do it
[1:11:18] look it
[1:11:20] good if God don't pull
[1:11:22] them
[1:11:25] or no man come to the father man or
[1:11:28] woman let God draw them first that's
[1:11:31] right so we don't need to beat up the
[1:11:34] sisters that are already in the one
[1:11:37] quote already ready for the Millennium
[1:11:39] already in
[1:11:41] one because we're comparing them equal
[1:11:44] do a
[1:11:46] j never it couldn't happen couldn't fall
[1:11:49] not with the Holy
[1:11:51] Ghost watch what he says here that he
[1:11:54] might Rec himself himself a body a bride
[1:11:58] which was Eve the second
[1:12:01] Eve I back
[1:12:04] himself the same thing that he did with
[1:12:07] Adam and Eve given a type that they were
[1:12:09] Christ in the bride the same as Christ
[1:12:12] in the bride now the second Adam the
[1:12:16] perfect sacrifice amen the perfect
[1:12:18] sacrifice The Perfect
[1:12:20] Bride he said but God had a purpose
[1:12:24] and he hid it from the wise and prudent
[1:12:27] and he revealed it on the predestinated
[1:12:31] babes that would
[1:12:33] Le predestiny
[1:12:36] things God help us God help us I want to
[1:12:40] close with just one more story from our
[1:12:44] Prophet talks about this and and I just
[1:12:47] enjoyed studying this and and you know
[1:12:50] when you look into God's word it just
[1:12:51] goes on and on and on it was just
[1:12:55] amazing and you know the
[1:12:57] [Music]

[1:13:44] tra I didn't know
[1:13:47] that it's all in the new ministry 59 in

[1:14:13] favorite song I like he's a same God
[1:14:16] that spoke to the woman at the well and
[1:14:17] he was saying he said you know this God
[1:14:19] that we serve is the same God that
[1:14:22] provided Abraham
[1:14:24] and he provided him a sacrifice when
[1:14:26] there was no sacrifice and he said he's
[1:14:28] not one spe different than provided and
[1:14:31] I want I want to just also throw this in
[1:14:33] here it was so so so real brother
[1:14:37] Brown's life because her husband had
[1:14:40] been smushed him and brother Woods had
[1:14:43] been in the forest and they had shot two
[1:14:45] rabbits for the family

[1:16:01] place not deserving
[1:16:04] of just living
[1:16:06] life in the
[1:16:10] country it's it's a four-page quote just
[1:16:12] goes into it and he talks about the
[1:16:15] prophet's talking about he said you know
[1:16:16] it's exact same God that provided for
[1:16:19] Abraham the exact same God that could
[1:16:21] provide for hey right
[1:16:23] he's talking about
[1:16:25] food Earthly

[1:16:34] squirrels and how youbody sitting back
[1:16:36] there listening to that they just shot
[1:16:38] the rabbits they said they skinned them
[1:16:40] and were cooking them for them to eat
[1:16:43] there you can read this in the
[1:16:46] quote he said he's just as much as
[1:16:48] Jehovah Gyra
[1:16:50] today as he was back then Abraham
[1:16:53] and you know we Minister that year he's
[1:16:56] exactly the same God if he ain't exactly
[1:16:58] the same he's no God at us right he's
[1:17:01] exactly if you have a need here this
[1:17:02] morning you could just speak on it

[1:17:30] bum and hady Ray was sitting back and
[1:17:33] she was listening to brother BR said I
[1:17:36] want to specify this she was listening
[1:17:39] to brother BR say that he's exactly the
[1:17:42] same Jehovah God that he was with
[1:17:44] Abraham exactly it wasn't a b something
[1:17:48] it wasn't focused on brother Brown
[1:17:50] brother Bram was saying if I needed
[1:17:51] squirrels just like you needed Abraham
[1:17:54] needed laugh he said we just say help
[1:17:59] me yeah and here's how you rap in a
[1:18:03] terrible

[1:18:41] me and you know the
[1:18:44] story I'm trying to show you that

[1:21:35] don't want to bring in man's greed amen
[1:21:38] we don't want to
[1:21:39] bring we don't be making women property

[1:21:45] wealthy I am and how good looking I am

[1:21:50] disgusting that's that's that's that's a
[1:21:53] that's an African Creed but it's of the
[1:21:56] devil I'll stand here and say it and
[1:21:58] I'll tell it right to their face it's up
[1:22:00] the devil it was polygamy now today my
[1:22:04] multiple wives you know what God told
[1:22:06] Moses it wasn't so in the beginning I
[1:22:10] want me to tell you something else let's
[1:22:11] go back to our Prophet let's use him for
[1:22:13] an example I read the story of him
[1:22:16] asking for his first wife and when he
[1:22:19] when his first wife died and he married
[1:22:20] the second wife brother Bram tried run
[1:22:23] from her and and dwell with other women
[1:22:24] CU he was afraid to marry her and God
[1:22:27] told her to
[1:22:29] marry God the go that's that's the top
[1:22:34] Dove when brother B asked for his wife
[1:22:37] he was so nervous and so young he could
[1:22:40] not speak the
[1:22:42] words you know
[1:22:45] this and her dad never said I'll take 10
[1:22:50] cups brother Brown couldn't even ask
[1:22:54] and I'm not
[1:22:58] making he said all you can have her
[1:23:04] belly you can have her belly now if our
[1:23:08] if we wanted to have a modernday
[1:23:10] example of paying for a bride the s a
[1:23:16] prophet he never paid for either one of
[1:23:18] his
[1:23:21] Brides you read everything else he
[1:23:25] says except that
[1:23:30] part
[1:23:32] am try help
[1:23:35] us
[1:23:37] amen you know the
[1:23:39] story you know hady Wright was
[1:23:42] so
[1:23:44] so had Wright never had no intent no of
[1:23:49] anything no intent so WR didn't even
[1:23:54] understand the question or the or the
[1:23:56] Commandment or or she didn't even
[1:23:58] understand the prophet when he said you
[1:24:00] can ask for whatever you want she she
[1:24:02] don't it says it
[1:24:04] here and he said he said
[1:24:07] brother had he said to me
[1:24:11] brother what do you even
[1:24:14] mean I don't even know why you're
[1:24:16] talking
[1:24:19] about that's what you call innocent
[1:24:21] Blind Faith yeah amen there's no pre-
[1:24:24] agendas she never had a
[1:24:28] schedule she was still mouring her
[1:24:32] husband trying to figure out what her
[1:24:34] own family
[1:24:39] that the prophet said unto you he said
[1:24:41] you can ask anything that your heart
[1:24:43] desires remember this was a
[1:24:47] sister not a brother sister anything
[1:24:50] your heart desires and it shall produce
[1:24:51] right here and that you'll know that the
[1:24:53] Lord God in heaven answers the
[1:24:56] scriptures are true and they said the
[1:24:57] first thing I knew first time the new
[1:25:01] gift he said this was a new gift it was
[1:25:03] this new ministry the messages this is
[1:25:06] the new anointing and he said I could
[1:25:08] hard I could hardly hear her she looked
[1:25:10] around and she was talking about her
[1:25:12] little crippled sister I said he said
[1:25:15] you know I said no doubt in my heart
[1:25:17] it's in a few minutes that she'll be
[1:25:19] jumping if you want to heal your
[1:25:20] crippled sister and how he looked around
[1:25:23] again and he said Billy the greatest
[1:25:25] desire I have is
[1:25:28] salvation of my souls and he said there
[1:25:30] he said you could have asked for
[1:25:32] anything greater he said if she would
[1:25:33] asked for
[1:25:34] $10,000 she would have had it but he
[1:25:36] said God what I'm going to close with
[1:25:39] this see God in heaven God
[1:25:44] known what she would
[1:25:47] ask yeah that's right God
[1:25:51] know God know what you ask for us
[1:25:58] today amen the Bible also says and we
[1:26:01] could have went on for just too long but
[1:26:04] you know the Bible says that if you
[1:26:07] mistreated a sister or your wife I'm
[1:26:10] just paraphrasing this believe it's in
[1:26:11] James that God would block your
[1:26:16] prayers that's what God thinks of
[1:26:19] sisters but I just wonder if the spirit
[1:26:22] of around all the
[1:26:24] environment if we didn't take what the
[1:26:27] prophet said and
[1:26:28] just put the emphasis on the wrong spot
[1:26:32] see you have to remember this so now
[1:26:34] we're generally preaching to message
[1:26:36] Believers that are Holy Ghost filled but
[1:26:38] the prophet was generally featured to a
[1:26:41] mixed and he was dealing with a lot of
[1:26:43] the fall of Holiness and and The Jezebel
[1:26:47] spirit coming in where they cut their
[1:26:48] hair he said every time I come back this
[1:26:50] you're much worse yeah
[1:26:52] and people were that's when they let the
[1:26:54] bars down the goats come in the church
[1:26:57] and he was dealing so he would say
[1:26:59] things but we're not dealing with that
[1:27:02] no that's right yeah we're not dealing
[1:27:04] with
[1:27:07] thaten God help us just God help us see
[1:27:10] that you just go back to Ephesians 1 if
[1:27:13] we want to see that you submit yourself
[1:27:16] respect one another treat each other
[1:27:20] like craist human you know the prophet
[1:27:23] said this and I'm just paraphrasing in
[1:27:26] my study he said your
[1:27:29] wife or your
[1:27:32] daughter dad's and husbands you need to
[1:27:35] listen
[1:27:36] up she was God's Property a long time
[1:27:39] before she was
[1:27:41] your that's how he says it says your
[1:27:44] wife and your
[1:27:47] dos came from The Presence of Jehovah
[1:27:50] God and you mis touch it
[1:27:53] and vengeance is
[1:27:55] mine God would have killed Moses yeah
[1:27:59] except for his
[1:28:01] wife God help us to to to have the right
[1:28:05] proper life love bre I'm not talking
[1:28:08] about being other place I'm just saying
[1:28:10] it's beautiful it's just
[1:28:15] beautiful it's
[1:28:18] just
[1:28:20] amen but let's not put something there
[1:28:23] that ain't there let's not put something
[1:28:24] there that our Prophet never put there
[1:28:27] he's a great
[1:28:28] example Perfect
[1:28:31] Balance Perfect
[1:28:34] Balance you you could just go on and go
[1:28:36] on and go on he said it was my mom when
[1:28:38] his mom died he said it was my mom that
[1:28:40] held the family together not the dad the
[1:28:45] mom there's a prophet that knew
[1:28:50] God but he knew knew the balance he knew
[1:28:53] the prophet Prophet knew the value of a
[1:28:57] sister her prayer at the altar for
[1:29:01] L praying for the
[1:29:04] sick you knew the value a
[1:29:07] prophet
[1:29:09] die do
[1:29:13] we help
[1:29:15] Jesus help
[1:29:18] me
[1:29:20] Hallelujah
[1:29:29] am I to close with another scriptures
[1:29:32] just ripping me
[1:29:35] apart the New Testament talks about
[1:29:37] respects the
[1:29:39] pars and there is talking about
[1:29:43] money but respects is
[1:29:46] G if it showed respects the different
[1:29:49] categories of
[1:29:50] people that you were a sinner and guilty
[1:29:52] of the
[1:29:54] whole that's pretty plain
[1:29:57] English and remember that sister Christ
[1:30:00] died for
[1:30:01] her she came from Christ and she has a
[1:30:05] purpose beautiful in Christ God was
[1:30:09] making a bride for his son Jesus Christ
[1:30:13] Hallelujah God help us God help us to be
[1:30:16] in his let what
