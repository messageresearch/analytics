bless the beautiful bride that showed up all that will be watching online in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats for a second just a few announcements um before our brother comes and wow we just praised god for the worship service just jared was singing some of the song we were singing some of the songs and i thought wow i'd like to sing that one again he's saying the next one i said wow like send that one again got to about the third one i said i don't know which one i want to sing again amen just god is so amazing just welcome you all it's just amazing to be here in his presence set aside for him um we want to announce this uh uh in october john d'anqua and the church in mississauga has special meetings i believe don't told me the sunday is the ninth and they start on wednesday so they start about the fourth and it's fifth okay and it's wednesday night thursday night friday night saturday night i'm i might might be two on saturday and sunday morning and uh i would hugely encourage you to make that a priority you know we're made to fellowship we're not made to agree on everything i don't agree with my wife on lots of things but we're still mates fellowship and you know people ask the prophet are we supposed to go to other churches that you're not preaching or they're not preaching exactly what you preach and he said oh my goodness of course amen if they say something that's off the word we'll just spit out that bit but the whole pie is going to taste pretty good amen and i don't mean that's going to happen i'm just saying you know we were forced to segregate by the government let's not do it on our own let's not do it on our own man so i might talk to the deacons or some of the brothers some of you we could even consider closing sunday morning that's hard to do but if we got a really good commitment to go there um um we would do that and and and i say this with the most sincerity if somebody here says well i would go but i can't afford to drive sunday for a tank of gas you just privately see brother dale and we'll take care of it thank you guys amen i say that sincerely amen and because we are living in a different world economy is different cash is different and uh a lot of things happen in the end of this month in the first of october i don't know and i if any of these are following it but there's a lot of things happen in the jewish calendar and monies are changing in the government and we're very close we're we're just we're at the door we're we're in the season man i'm pulling out the combine tomorrow and spiritually speaking god has a come by note especially i'm telling you it's there's countries that are dropping their money on the first of october the first of october all the roman catholic money has to be in rome by the first of october from every country of the world has to be pulled out of national banks there's some supernatural things happening in the world supernatural things happen but uh but anyway we want to so i just encourage you to go and we're going to be there if we're not there every service we're going to be there most of them me and sister luanne and uh you know we don't know what could happen this winter if the you know it's just we have an opportunity to fellowship and let's do it when we can because we haven't been able to do it for two or three years amen and we want to show some pictures here um i don't i don't do this every day and yeah you're good and maybe elliot can come we'll sing a song before we pray here we're good answer um this is a brother that we met this is not just a brother this is a pastor that me and brother jim meant just remember uh brother jim says she lended me and brother james went seeing him last night seeing brother jim last night took him out for his birthday and they're doing really well also remember john blackman and that and this brothers uh has a tremendous ministry has a couple of churches or a church and an outreach and we've we've helped them do little things maybe a roof on the building or stuff just think this is not a beggar this guy is not a beggar and we were supposed to preach for him and we had the car accident so he came and met and ate dinner with me and brother jim and you know pastor leo or whoever anyway there's actually a brother in sarnia that gives money to orphanages through our church i believe this brother has 120 kids he feeds every day 120 okay so this is a common occurrence i could show you hundreds of pictures of him baptizing in the lake this is the the only lake fresh water that's right next to the capitol by the airport you drive by it when we go to the airport it's right beside it be like our great lakes but it's a lot dirtier than our great lakes but let's go to the next pictures um this is just some examples let's blow that up a whole bunch if we can um i think but this brother's wife uh appendix bursted saturday saturday so it would almost been our friday or bursted or is inflamed and has to come out now my wife's appendix had come out and it was emergency surgery i mean she was the hospital and one hour later they were doing it my dad they had to do that too this is patricia my dad they were he was sick and sarnia i remember this clearly my dad they couldn't figure out what it was and they almost sent him home and they said well you know maybe we better not send you home maybe we better send you to london when he got to london they did a surgery within an hour they said if they would have sent you home they would have took you from your home in a box and this guy needs 970 000 uganda shillings which is 340 dollars canadian and he said i hope i get the money before my wife dies which one of you brothers would value your wife at 340 if i don't have it he said i hope the doctor would do this i said brother i can't even send it to you till monday because moneygram is closed you can turn the pictures and so the last messages he has sent me he has not even answered um i sent him a message i said tell the doctor to read my message do the surgery save your wife and i'll send the money monday morning you'll get it tuesday morning man but this is a regular occurrence but it's unbelievable how they live that for 340 bucks the doctor wasn't even working so it didn't matter if her appendix had bursted he said i'm not in the hospital sunday that's not an option i'll be there by noon on monday if you have the money if she's dead by then we'll he'll bury you unbelievable this is somebody i sat across the table and ate with fellowship just amazing amen so amen just i don't know we might i think we have one more just blow that out but so at the very least remember the brother and his wife that they will be taken care of can you make that bigger can you uh there you go that's a lot better but i have already committed to sending money to him on monday but if somebody wants to help to that that's a legitimate i mean he's a pastor and that's his wife i know they have kids i know they have a boy for sure i'm not positive they don't have yeah but uh anyway that's uh i don't do that every day but that that's just kind of hit close to home and i couldn't imagine i couldn't imagine compromising the life of any one of us here for 300 bucks that's just amazing man so man let's just stand we'll sing pleasing doing brighter brother james here and we just had amazing fellowship just riding to see brother jim and last night and we were in the vehicle we were just just thrilled talking about the word of god and just just he's got a beautiful family and we're just trying to have them a lot more often it's just an awesome privilege to have them here so let's sing this as our brother james comes please let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you praise let everything that i pursue oh yes be pleasing oh lord unto you pleasing let me be [Music] [Music] is be pleasing [Music] unto you shall we pray heavenly father that's our heart's desire lord to be pleasing to you one time lord for the god you came down with a voice you see this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and thank you father lord jesus that you gave us the supreme example in yourself when you were so journeying on the day on the earth now today father we are your children and we just come further in the simplicity of worship and prayer to you father so that lord that our sacrifice lord be acceptable to you let our works be pleasing unto you because we know that when we please you for the god that's what's good for us bless us lord for the god as we go into the preaching of the word any mortal with a mind with the ability to write to read and write will be able oh god to say something from the scriptures anyone that can listen to the english language and read books will be able to read what brother branham said but lord it only takes your great eternal spirit to open up that word to give a genuine experience revelation understanding so we pray lord that above all o god your great holy spirit will open up to us what you have us to hear today made be so according to our prayer in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless thank you david said he was glad when they say to him let us go into the house of the lord and i'm also glad to be in the house of the lord today amen you know among my welcoming people and i definitely appreciate um but adele sister luann you know being here you know the last time not the last time but uh the first time that dale ever met my wife was when he was baptizing her and um at that time we didn't have no children four children later and the oldest one is ten years that's how much time has gone on and um so just definitely appreciate brother dale since then i've known him to be a humble servant of the lord i don't think that has changed about him with time at all you know i think maybe becoming a grandpa has made him more mellow you know it's uh i think somebody one time jogged and say life would be good if there was no moms and dads only grandpa's and grandmas but uh we we definitely i definitely appreciate being here i i bring you uh greetings from pada nelson that's that's my pastor uh he's on the missionary field so we talked a little bit when we were coming here i remember the last time that i was here preaching you know time of moves there was a pandemic in between and i remember i was coming here for the first time to preach and uh i i used brother nelson's vehicle because he lent me his vehicle just just he decided to and then uh i was playing i i just started driving and then he started playing at 8. i just knew i was coming here i didn't know exactly the name of the church or nothing and to my surprise it played the tape on half this time it wasn't even my i'm like god in a very simple way he has a very simple way to confirm his word so i would encourage you to not to look out for big outstanding things but the bottom before you preach the the seals you preach to god in simplicity you know because god is so great you know we look for great things and he does great things but he always works in a simple way in a simple way i think there's one of the songs that was saying says all heavens declare and all nature declared the glory of god you know i think it's david who said even if i lay my bed in hell thou art there you know that's that's that's how our god works and uh so look beyond me i am just uh a mortal man you know i i i i am nothing but you know um god bless you i think i believe brother jim is streaming we had a chance to see him it was good connecting god bless everybody but uh gerard thank you for for the song service sister julie and my kids had some good time with them and they played around but matt thank you good to see you you know the problem is once you start uh mentioning names sometimes you forget one and you get yourself into trouble and then sometimes you mention everybody then you realize oh i forgot my wife and then maybe she may be nice enough to remind you when you're driving oh i'm sorry but at the br back there i think i see is that brother god bless you yes yes yes i know uh sister ruth you know i don't know if your wife ever told you one of the times we can connected is sister ruth and i different is we were born but we were born exactly on the same day so before she got married we used to do a little thing and there's another sister by us was born on february 10 and would go and eat out on that day so go a long time so look beyond me everybody else have his time bright tabernacle you know i haven't mentioned by name god bless you and uh and uh and um just look to god to the people who are streaming look to god you know i've had instances i won't go into the details of exactly what and who but where i've been listening to online and i had prayed to god really sincerely and deeply and then it was a live streaming with somebody not not our local church or nothing but uh you know a message minister was preaching there and um then after i finished praying i'm like okay i'm gonna listen it was a sad that i'm gonna listen and then i sat down i took a shower and said i'm gonna just sit down like i'm in church that was way before my wife was was here and um i remember that that minister put his knots on the side he says i feel a pull to change my salmon and then uh then he put his notes aside then he started preaching like he'd been listening to my prayer and one by one i just don't go into names because sometimes this is this is it's not a bad thing but sometimes you trouble when you start naming names but sometimes people think you are then endorsing that minister or you are saying something no you are just saying how god moves you know god can use anybody you know actually brother bonham let's not see brother let's go in the bible god use the raven ravens to bring food to your prophet now you could uh you could just go into your illegality say you know the ravens is supposed to be an unclean bird you know how he's gonna bring food you know you miss the blessing so you know if you feel within your heart not that i say anybody feels that but if you think in your heart because you know we are living in an age way people say a lot of things about people oh friends you don't judge people that way i thank god i i i i i don't think about brother there if i want to know about something about brother dale i'll tell you what i do and i would encourage you to do the same thing i go to god because he gives me an answer that is good god still speaks he still speaks you don't go now to the person maybe we don't like him for whatever reason they won't have nothing too positive to say unfortunately you know but the bottom speaks about you know every country having a national spirit in my observation one of the things i've met you know and he talks about the american spirit and he talks about the german spirit and stuff like national spirit that is and uh frankly he said you know in his opinion at that time he said the american spirit was the worst that's what he said now that's nothing against our american brothers that that's not what i'm saying at all actually our prophet came from there so so so so that's not what we are talking about but you come into canada people generally they are polite but after a while you realize a lot are polite on the surface because just down the road just down the corner you see them the best friends and you're saying why are you doing that to your best friend no you know and people get so but it's an evil spirit that's not good you know if you can't talk directly to sister luan and stuff like that maybe you should keep quiet don't go behind the back and stuff like that and begin to sass and throw down some things no that's not a good spirit at all friends i'm just talking is i feel led you know but they'll never give me a sem and say you know so you know these things they they we have to get rid of these things if we want to see god move in a greater way you know we have to overcome that now we're just saying that you you go you go i come from a country called zimbabwe that's that's in southern africa and stuff like that you go there i see from my experiences i haven't lived there for the when since i came here but i visited once at least and uh people they have this thing they just want to be like somebody else if they're around jamaicans they're speaking like jamaicans if they're around americans americans it's disgusting to me you know that's the national spirit there if they're around south africans they are just like south africans and and and that's the kind of spirit that's well we have to overcome national spirits we have to overcome you know we have to overcome the bible talks about god giving us power over the nations that's power over national spirits you know and the way we do that we get into christ by the baptism the whole to that of course these aspects about your identity your thing that you maintain whatever is good you're good you're not gonna change your canadian accent because what there's nothing wrong with that but when we start talking about things that are sinful those things we need to overcome that's why the gospel is preached so i just see that to lay down the background so that you can prove you see going to going back to the story i was saying the minister says i feel it pulled then he preached like he'd been listening to my sermon the whole sermon then he finished and when he finished there was one thing that was still pending so i saw him this is live streaming i saw him take his knots like this and then he starts walking away and as he's walking away in my heart i'm just still one more like right here i i see he comes back to the pulpit here they ended over the song the service to the song later and and then he comes down and he says exactly the last one thing that i needed to hear you know if you want to know who it is later i'll tell you but not not now you know we can do that after the service done after after he done that he even said to yourself he says lord i don't know what was this all about but i just follow your leading and that was it you know you know god always speaks then one time i had gone you see that's why i was talking about church many testimonies i can give you with that but let us go into into in into the word but i just appreciate everybody appreciate my wife biggest daughter patience faith daniel and charity that's the the the children that uh that god god gave us so i appreciate my wife coming with me initially i was gonna come by myself because you know children have started school and you're thinking you know okay you know we have prayer meeting friday and then you know saturday and then come monday i'm like no no you know you i like what brother dale was saying about fellowship you know we have to press on to have fellowship satan doesn't want us to have fellowship human beings are made to fellowship you know we are made to fellowship and and i appreciate about that about brother brother dale that uh not only does he talk about it you know let me put this way i got something kind of to make right you know brother dale for a long time he asked me to to come and uh it didn't it didn't work out the last time i answered in a week that afterwards i'm like no the answer didn't sound right i'm like ah we'll see you know they were beginning to open up uh like i will see the pandemic has been on and stuff like that honestly i i don't move we continued working because they didn't close the company because it's security they say essential business so i said oh well i got to work for my money even though others are getting some for free i got to work for mine so we continued working well the rules essentially to me they are bitter they were more arbitrary side it's like i'm working am i less risk now others what are you it's like it was all over the map so when i answered him like that i'm like that didn't sound right it's it's not like i'm afraid of covet i'm not because the bible said though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy road i stuff they comfort me this is the promises of god now you're not gonna go around then dear god and tempt god you don't do that you're going up in my view you're going with your personal life in an everyday manner and and the rest you commit to god you know i try to find the the the the balance there at the workplace and then they foster they say are you oh you got to stop pushing everybody you got to be fascinated oh you got to go to clients and stuff like that i i initially i'm thinking like okay what i want is well maybe i don't know i ain't no scientist uh something's just not making sense to me one time they were saying don't put math and after a while they say put math and uh so i ain't no expecting those things i'm like you know sometimes you know at the end of the day to me people make fun of things that are small let me let me put it this way paul put it this way he was talking about eating meat he says it's okay if a person and then let's use a different example he was talking about observing this he says one person observed days it's fine don't face it he says to the lord he doesn't observe it another one observe it to the lord he does it so in other words to me paul actually said this he said i became all things to all men that i may win sir paul went among the jews and shaved himself and cleansed himself ceremoniously to be among the jews and took timothy and circumcised them hid poor prisons a circumcision is nothing you see but the banana preached in india and he put on a caller because they thought that the minister has to put on a caller it's not like you want to put on a call you know what if if i'm gonna put on a caller to win souls i would do it as long as it's not sinful as long as it's not sinful that's the key that that to me that's the balance we need you know we we we we can't jump on onto something that says okay you know what yeah okay fine that's what they say i'm gonna that's another fight if i go going into daddy if i put that on i says lord you said if you drink any deadly thing he shall not harm you but i can't go evangelizing about a a vaccine i don't know how would i do that i can't be upset about somebody who didn't maybe that would have been my inclination from the start so these things we ought to make them the smaller things in my view the bigger picture in the church is souls that's the bigger picture worshiping god getting close to god getting out of here preparing ourselves to get out of here to me that's the bigger picture everything else is small everything else is is small and and and and when we are that oh man friends the first conspiracy in the world started with lucifer so don't get sidetracked there's so many conspiracies some real some not real i don't know i don't have enough intelligence to follow them all sometimes i reason and i'm like this doesn't make sense you know but they all show me something i'm like yeah when you reason like wow it doesn't make sense but if i follow that friends from the beginning satan the first conspiracy started not on earth it started in heaven you know so we won't be surprised if people are doing things clandestinely behind the back you can perceive that and forget that the focus is for you to get close to god that's the main thing to look at your life and say is my life approved of god am i ready you know and and to me those are the the most important questions and that's what we want to get get into by by by the grace of god but for a scripture reading we're going to read this scripture that will lay down the background of what we want to preach but before that let me read this i saw this um on but dale's uh this there and i thought i liked that because that's a thought that that had been in my mind he says it's a print out of a quotation from dan pardon it was sin it says there's no great people and big people in the kingdom i want that to sink in not even brother banner because he's the one saying look friends you look into the heavens in the skies you see stars you see some very small stars that you might have to actually maybe get a telescope they're just right there you see a big star the morning star or whatever and it's shining it's almost like whoa when you look everything is attracting you to that each one of those stars was given that glory by god the bigger one can't say i i'm bigger than you because i'm better because everything is freely given so there is no big me and small you in the kingdom you have to change that mindset all together now there's different roles there's different roles there's a prophet there's pastors there's all these different things you you you know but it's it's it's almost as if sometimes the connotation you get around message people of which i am one and without saying it it's almost the same it's okay to respect brother branham but it's okay to disrespect the children of god that's the atmosphere that they're carrying sometimes it's okay to respect that but disrespect pastors they they they say it that's why they want to take the pastor's role off it's almost like when they read ephesians they want to read and and he gave some prophets and prophets and prophets and prophets and prophets that's their kind of fivefold ministry friends it's not so brother branham believed in the fivefold ministry hallelujah we better hit that spirit it's wrong the fivefold ministry is to bring you to maturity perfection so that those things we are looking at there the statue of a perfect man they are established that's what the fivefold minister say that's what ephesians say he gave that in the church for the perfecting of the church well so you see sitting tactic if you listen to prophets and prophets and prophets and prophets you're not gonna mature you've got to believe in the fivefold ministry then there's another spirit that say brother branham fulfilled the five-fold where you get her from which quotation will he look oh oh because he said do the work of the evangelist even himself he says he say do the work of the evangelist i am not an evangelisticity he says i i passed it but i couldn't stand the fastings of the people oh these are quotations i didn't come prepared for that to read that but you can call you can choose you can you can look for these things just get keywords well we are living in an age electronic age let's use it for good let's use it to search these things let us be like the bearings that when you hear something if it's coming from the bible if it's coming from the message at least jot it down and listen don't shut down your mind right away and say i ain't gonna listen that was like the jews at thessalonians the bible says the jews said bearing they were more noble because they had paul saying new things that are different from what they had heard and they say well let us write it down let us go back let us search the things jesus christ actually encouraged people to say search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life sage the message because in them you think you're a message believer and they are the ones that testify these things brother branham says he believed in the five-fold ministry so you see we are at the age now where while the messenger came the messenger fulfilled his his part there is no more mysteries to be revealed i am looking for an eighth messenger maybe you are friends but i'm not i'm looking for the coming of the lord that's to me that's the next major thing on the calendar of god wow but what he said he said people who come rise up young men take and put sense to this message how are they putting sense or not by injecting their own idea because sometimes i hit highlights but the word of god comes precept upon precept line upon line hallelujah word upon word line upon line actually the way it's written it says precept upon precept precept upon prison line upon line and line upon line the word of god is not repeating things just for the sake of repeating but the bible says in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established so if you're establishing yourself in a doctrine in a way of thinking you have to have the ability to have run it from genesis to revelation not just one scripture and say yeah that's it let me give you an example somebody you know you know because when i came here some of the people that i knew the message took a hold of me when i was here in canada you know some of the people that i knew there were seventh-day adventists some of my good friend my good friend who helped me come here seven day adventists from zimbabwe good guy good fella you know and uh and he lives in australia now and we connected so my only connection was in toronto was a friend of a friend and they were there seven day adventists he come he took me he said i didn't know i didn't have no connection i didn't have no family i didn't have nobody so when i came and it took me so good people nice people i can't say nothing against that god used him actually the the the the name of the the young man it's a show name but it means grace in in in african language means grace i'm like oh that was the grace of god to me you know but you know good good people but some of them you know they they of course then they they believe in the seventh-day adventists and uh and they will say but uh why is it you all don't want to honor the sabbath not directly some of them i was talking about but just the sentiment around it says you all don't honor the sabbath okay then this here goes the argument in the way of thinking they say do you believe in the rest of the ten commandments you can't say no because the bible says thou shalt not steal right you believe that yeah thou shalt not commit adultery there shall not be a false witness yeah honor your father and mother yeah you see when it comes to the sabbath why didn't you start sounds reasonable to them so the way the word of god is believed and you build on a doctrine it's not just take just a scripture and say well it is written because the devil came to jesus by it is written so there was around the message come to people with quotes so you got to la line it and make it run through all the way from the start to the finish that's why people who are reading the old testament prophet and moses would actually look at jesus and crucify him reading the scriptures that say they would crucify stand at the cross and say he saved others himself we can say not knowing that they're actually repeating a sound oh moses still told us to do this so that's not how you run you got to run it through even if you think you have come to a nugget with brother branham you got to run it through you got to see it running from 1948 to 1965. you got to see sometimes the progression of the thought because sometimes he grew in understanding he said diddy yes he did he said it himself let me just give you an example one time brother branham he used to speak about body soul and spirit say you got a body and then it is soul and then you got the spirit actually when you go into the message the greatest battle ever for that's how you use it you're going to demonology that's how you go down the road somewhere he changes no it's not that it's body spirit and soul so you can run now with and say oh friends this is what brother brothers say it's body soul and spirit you can't do that he actually said himself when he started preaching way back that's not recorded in any messages but he spoke spoke it in the in the seals he says when i started preaching on the seals he says way back i said oh wow you know the first was rider white maybe that was christ he preached it says i feel like those seals in one service says 20 minutes each or something like that in 20 minutes you see when god now reveals it at the opening of the seals he says it was night and day so he grew in understanding if you were sitting in the tub an alcohol when he say well the first laws writer was christ and you write that and you hold on to that well you're off i think part of it comes down from people not wanting to understand and accept that brother burnham was a man this is part of the problem in the great falling away in the message today because you see a deity spirit goes forth and tells people brother burnham is infallible brother adam don't make mistakes which is not correct because he says i've made many mistakes just type mistakes in the info base you'll see him say it oh you think he's lying you think some people say it's being humble you think that being humble he says i have made mistakes actually as long as he live on the earth he'll make mistakes he went to south africa the people pulled him and and after that he got sick with amoeba in the stomach because he didn't listen to god mistakes human beings make mistakes you have to separate the men from the office you say how do you do it well god will help you god will help you just like but better than you have to separate the office the pastor and and and the man part of the the thing especially for family is sometimes to separate the father and the pastor so you got to say god help me to do it because your first relationship with him is not as a pastor as a father one time brother branham speaking to sister nader when he was uh talking about you know his daughter rebecca and stuff like that and she was a teenager and so on and she began to miss bf and brother branham says you know what this is what we do honey and and and systematically since what my daughter going on like like that he says no no no no no no no no after a while brother brandon says listen honey he is nothing he says listen honey people come from all over the world to hear this gift in other words essentially to me what he was saying to her is like now i'm speaking to you as a prophet now there's your husband she come down she listened thank god he says next time she does that instead of you getting upset and stuff like that just say it's okay and stuff like that he she done exactly that and the result came so you got to have that understanding of the ability to separate it wasn't god that told moses to smite the rock it was moses mistake that actually kept him from his land you're gonna follow that and say moses smote the rock when god told him to speak it so i'm going to smite the rock that's not how you do it you say well he made a mistake that doesn't take him away from being a servant of god but that the bible put it this way that no flesh should glory in the sight of god when the proclamation went through heaven he says no man was found in the book you know when that proclamation was going enoch had been raptured moses said god elijah had been raptured all those people were already in the past tense they had already lived great lives abraham had actually been resurrected you know all the old testament saints they were resurrected when jesus christ rose from the dead and even the resurrected saints no man was found worthy to open the book so brother branham is not jesus christ brother branham is the servant of christ so the day the spirit comes in the message and get upset when you say brother branham was a man if your spirit is upset with that it needs to be upset we better lay down it needs to be upset because you are in danger of idolatry one time you know in the days of hezekiah oh praise god i'm gonna put that down in the days of hezekiah you know what they did in the e there was the present second the present second that that moses had laid everybody knows the president happened when everybody was beaten they would go and look serpent and they they would be made whole in the days of hezekiah he came down because people begin to idolize it go and read it hezekiah's reforms he tells you to tone it down we need to tear down this idolatrous picture of brother branham build a round message because it's not producing better christians it's not producing people with victory it's not doing nothing it is calling cause the great falling away in the message because soon people are smart enough we live in the age of internet where people can search for things after a while they realize that oh yeah brother branham that statement is not factually correct because this is the fact so some people going on into a completely upset thing and say oh wow it's both correct hear this story it's not a joke because a minister told me because it happened he dealt with a man who said brother param don't make mistakes so he says okay fine all right i've dealt with those kind of people before so it's not the first time i found it strange like are you gonna say that the man say he made mistakes are you gonna say that but anyway hindi actually at that time when the person said that to me i'm like let me go and say put mistakes and i'm like you know what some people when they set their mind you just have to leave them you know what the people said one time he said ibrahim is joined to his idols leave it alone god speaks to you and speaks to you if you continue resisting and fighting well the spirit of god moves and you remain tied to your idol you no more can hear the word of god after jesus died rose and crucified you know they continued with the worship in the temple you know they continued with sacrifices they continued until titans raised it down so for the next 40 years they were saying yahweh yahweh yahweh and thinking they are praising god not knowing that the spirit of god had moved on that's what happened to samson he continued tempting god the bible said he knew not he was not that the spirit had departed from it so we are speaking to spirits it's not people so now people go on and search and say wow but there's this mistakes there's these facts that's mixed with this there's this and that and stuff so put it together and make it sense make it make sense oh it's okay it's all correct the person saying i'm not talking to neighbor people after a while then because they probably never converted next thing they offended in the message the problem wasn't the message the problem is that they were given a false picture of who black means so the man came to to to to to to the brother he says well because but the branham said oh and moses built an ark he says okay what you gonna say about that then see what you're gonna say about that then he thought well you got him maybe he'll help him to change he said the man say to him well maybe noah's middle name was moses it's almost like a hopless situation but the spirit of god will not always strive with man upon that i like to lay a background because my subject is make your calling and election show make your calling and the election sure and for that we're gonna read second peter two no second peter one sorry it's 9 11 because that's why we are drawing our text i got a few scriptures we're gonna just move and see how the spirit leads and then we stop wherever we stop so pull for yourself what you have need of but my my encouragement to you is that go and study these things for yourself go and search the message go and search the scriptures for in them you think you have a certain understanding but they are the ones that testify of these things he says but he that liked these things is blind it's these things that they are talking about you know faith future knowledge and so on and cannot see affair off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins first wherefore the radha brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure god wants us to make our calling and the election show for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ thank you jesus for the god as we just go into this scripture and lay down it background pray lord for the god that he stopped my mouth to the things that you don't want spoken and let it speak the things that you want spoken in jesus christ's name amen you may take your seed some of the scriptures we may go into when when when we are seated let's go to galatians i hadn't printed that so i'm going to rely on the screen galatians 5 19-23 we want to put it together colossians 5 19-23 it says now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness just stay there for now this is why the gospel is preached because each one of us that comes into this world we are born in sin we are shaped iniquity we come to the world speaking lies it doesn't even matter that we were born in the message we as individuals have to come to our own personal transaction with god no nothing wrong being born in the message it's actually an advantage you see that means god you know was gracious to you you know you were born under a certain atmosphere and stuff like that but still that doesn't take away that well as a person you're born a sinner by nature the nature of sin we are not talking about as a child you don't commit to anything children die and go into the presence of the lord that's what brother branham teaches us but the thing about it the nature of sin is inside of us by birth and it is that nature of sin that if it's not changed by the time we become adults it becomes adultery married people you know going into relationships oh it's like it's normal it's almost like it's nothing fornication it's so it's almost like oh yeah yeah yeah by the time people get married they've slept with dozens of people it's like it's nothing well whilst that has been expected kind of in the world because they are sinners or in denominations well because they got watered down the sad thing when you begin to see that around message circles and the people are set aside by saying brother banham said yet their life is full of adultery wickedness fornications young people i'm talking to the young people oh adultery is for all the people who are married god is holy i still believe in an older holy gospel holiness gospel the message did not come to take holiness out of the church just like you can't take sanctification justification out of the church you can't take sanctification but well with the coming of the message it was plus because the message the falling away from the day of pentecost but the banham talks about you know those those those those creatures eating out i think but the jim was talking about that yesterday or something and those creatures eating out and eating out and by the time of the dark ages the church was a shadow of itself that's why in the time of look that god began to restore but he didn't do it in one blast he started with luther the fifth messenger and dropped down the truth of justification but there was still a lot of error that he didn't understand it didn't make him a bad person he was living in the revelation that was given to him then say yeah it's okay wesley we say he breathes sanctification but let me correct you a little bit leslie preach justification and sanctification he put away justification he says well you need to give your life to the lord but after that you need god to clean you out of bad habits because luther smoked the pipe you say well you need to be clean from all those unclean habits so you begin to pump away with sanctification pump away with sanctification well when he was gone by the venom you can go through that restoration of the bride tree when he was god you know well people organized and say he's a methodical man they build a denomination around it just like they build a denomination around luther oh god is not working in denominations god is working with individuals so the spirit of god moved on then you come to azusa street i'll tell you why i called it azusa street enter into another confusion again in the message because azusa street called themselves pentecostal that's what they called themselves but if you read in the church ages but the banham put it this way it says well that wasn't the true restoration of pentecost that was the restoration of the gates because in order to restore the fullness of pentecost you must need a word restoration the original pentecost was the full word because the church started with the full word on the day of pentecost and then after a while era creeped into the church and started eating away eating away then it went into the dark ages when god was now restoring when azusa street come with the restoration of the gifts which was the leaves the leaves right people know that that was the least so there was a lot of shouting there was a lot of clapping and stuff like that well they call it pentecost because they thought the original pentecost was gone but when we come now with the revelation of the message understanding no it wasn't the fullness of pentecost as they thought it was just the restoration of the gifts so the true original people of azusa street believed justification sanctification and the restoration of the gift but they called it pentecost which creates a confusion that became their denominational name after a while why are you saying that we are laying down a background because you got to understand somebody the way they use words you don't think people for what you think you take people for what they mean because words are used differently let me just give you an example when i one of the first things that one of the things that happened when i came here i found this somebody was about to bump me i'm looking this way let's say and they are walking behind me they're about to bump me they watch out i didn't say nothing i said to myself what rudeness is that you watch me yeah i'm the one standing here and you're the one almost bumping me in they're telling me to watch out but after a while i realized no it's not a rude thing but in my way of thinking like how you almost bumped me and you say no i can't go on and say that person was being rude to me i got to take them for what they mean brother but i'm here to use words to convey me that's why sometimes by the bottom you hear him say and say away with a pentecostal these come pentecostal bowsers and stuff like that well he's talking to people who have organized himself become a denomination called pentecost then you'll hear him flip around his pentecostal from the top of my head to the crowd to the soul of my feet well you can't just run and say wow wow yeah and i see that a lot in the message ah yeah the pentecostals the pentecostal well he can't speak against the day of pentacles because he'll be speaking against the word but he can speak against the dino that calls himself pentecost so when you are reading now in the message you got to put your mind from me and say oh when he's speaking like this is he referring to pentecostal denomination or is he referring to a d-33 well if we are wrong then we might as well stop uh the song we were singing it says here it says greta is he that is in me he says on the day of pentecost we might as well if pentecost is wrong might as well stop singing that we know that's not him so everything in the world has to be rightly divided the devil is a religious man the devil came to jesus and say it is written so don't run off with a court follow the thought then if you find quotes that sounds like wow it's a bit contradictory it may not be as you think then stop pray and say god caused this to make sense to me because if you run off like that you don't understand it good enough you may run off a tangent you end up with a car eating grass on top of a tree that's brother branham's example you got to put he said the bible is like a jigsaw puzzle he says he says forgive me sounds secretly just he says you got to put that peace you got to put that piece together you got to put that piece together then you have the full picture and he says if you read every scripture in the bible and don't see jesus christ read it again he said that i'm quoting these things you can reference you can go back he can search thank god we know you know i i think you know but they'll say he was talking about how you know you came in the in the to to the message in the 80s is it right and and and as i'm talking here brother there i'm thinking like well back then man if you say brother ban says you hit and then you got to read it because then someone can ask you and say where is it and if you forgot the book you sound like you're lying the good thing what i say you can search in the app friends as much as we celebrate that the bible say to whom more is given more is required so you must make the diligence search the quotes for yourself make your calling and election sure and they verify whether these things be fall because once you hate you're accountable to god that's how god works hallelujah brother banham he put it this way you know what let's let's let's let's let's fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness let's go on to the next one i just want to lay that that that that that out of the way then we can go idolatry witchcraft today people say oh yeah yeah well we don't have witchcraft here well the bible says rebellion is the scene of witchcraft so if you cause rebellion and confusion in this church you got a witchcraft spirit if you cause separation it's a witchcraft spirit you may not actually take a thing and do enchantments or whatever which is do but that that that would be that i'm not saying it doesn't happen it happens people do those things too definitely they do well you just have to to come go to some of these places even here i met people with witchcraft i feel like going there i did in canada and god showed me not only god who showed me it was confirmed the person confirmed it when i asked him afterwards i'm like what's the funny spirit around this person they were supposed to supervise me for some pro something that i was doing and and and after i went there in the in the hospital was just crashing and do you know what i had done but the bernard i'll tell you what they've done i had been dealing with these government people and and and and and they they sent me to to to it was uh something to do with the employment ontario because because because i was transitioning before between jobs and they were training and stuff like that so they have all these centers that are supposed to help you so i went to the first center and i was dealing first with this indian lady sorry you know i there's nothing against indian people nothing like that i'm just saying the way it is i gotta just say the way it happened and the end and the and uh whilst i was doing that i feel like irish spirit and and god is just working with inside of me i'm like oh okay that's an eerie spirit that's a witchcraft spirit and i could descend i'm like you know what i got the option to go to another center i can't do that so i walked away i walked away and then when i walked away i started the program the way that i wanted everything is going fine when the program is about to wind down they say wow when it winds down we're gonna because they were giving us support so well you got to be accountable so i'm talking financial support you know because we i was working establishing a small business and stuff like that so the structures of support so you got to be accountable because you're getting their money so they they say okay so you're gonna have a supervisor to supervise you after a gun this woman who had just started helping us with the the program in my spirit i just like yuri and sometimes he'll come with these rings and stuff like i'm done fully dressed in it she was a white lady again i don't mean nothing so that you know that these things are everywhere so and she'll come drink just like better than what i've seen sisters do and the but they hear you spirit and i'm like wow i'm like man this is in here it's great what's going on i'm like i'm going to the program courtney this is me talking to myself and i'm telling him take off this person i'm i want a different supervisor then when i was about to do that i felt the spirit of god check me you are repeating the same cycle that's what you just did so i stopped i'm like lord what is it you want me to learn out of this experience so stupid me i'm and you know look because you can't just start saying oh i feel in my spirit that's a witch and you run off with that it got to be prophet because the devil isn't accused of the brethren so don't yeah i feel this i feel led how many times we feel led and then after a while we find that no it wasn't a good leading i went to to that woman's office after the so bottom line i i didn't walk away i'm like god i'm just gonna go through that because if i walk away again i'm gonna come back to the same lesson so uh when i come down to that dealing we we we we we with that we we that woman i started talking and she said it was christmas time he said do you celebrate christmas i didn't know exactly how to answer i think i said kind of not really because you know you're trying to find who you're talking to because people when they celebrate christmas you know when they are sinners if i'm talking to a message person maybe i could answer easily you know so i say i say kind of but not exactly she says yeah i don't i don't celebrate christmas it says oh really what do you do or something they should give me a name i can't remember it off my head now i said what's that then she explained a little thing after i was gone i'm like that's strange i saw i went i i wrote the word i think i'd ask for the spelling i wear that and i googled it after i was gone and this man witchcraft stuff i'm like wow so he's true lord that's what i'm dealing with but what god wanted me to do but then that he wanted me to separate the person from the spirit i was looking at it wrong i was praying wrong when i was able to separate the person from the spirit then i started praying sincerely my heart for your salvation because before i just was disgusted both with person spirit i don't care i just don't want nothing to do and god said oh i prayed for it sincerely from my heart do you know what happened as soon as i had had that victory immediately he changes she became the newest person too see sometimes that's what it is friends you look at people they're giving so much trouble in the church and stuff like that or we get disgusted we think like ah this person is trouble sometimes they think that they just need god wants us to come in our heart with such a love towards that person and god will change them when finally we've done that god i don't know whether she got saved or what but at least she changed her behavior towards me and god was preparing me with that experience to deal with some and may i just put enough to this that something greater was hooked on to the salvation of my wife so i am taught nancy stories we speak spiritual things we fight spiritual battles oh friends when it comes to this time i ain't coming just to to feel good i i'm coming for souls even if it's one soul it's okay jesus christ preached to one person like he's preaching to multitudes you say did he yes he sent all the preachers in the city to buy bread and he preached to a woman that was living on husband number six and he didn't diminish his preaching he didn't make it smaller he didn't preach less he preached exactly like his preaching one time oh my but the man he he went into the tombs he takes he took with him 12 riches and if you ask jesus christ that they say where are we having church pastor jesus he said we are having it in the tombs because there's a man called legion hallelujah it wasn't about forms and ceremonies he was about the deliverance of souls so when we come to church the focus is to be souls if there is one soul that's still bound hallelujah we ain't living hoof we end leaving nothing behind we must all join together with your pastor with raised brethren of precious faith so the souls are saved so these things sometimes mean the deliverance of your loved ones yes years before my wife got saved you know she was in england i was here dealing with immigration things then finally she joined we were separate in that respect wow the message took a hold of me he i heard the message when i was about but he took a hold of me here you know anyway long story short when god had come into my life and finally converted me by a supernatural experience and things started happening behind around me now all of a sudden talking to my wife about jesus and stuff like things that i never really used to speak but therefore here to see me so you could imagine like what are you saying what are you saying oh you don't want to be with me anymore what no no no no those things and whilst that's all going finally i pressed on god said to me pray for her to enter into the kingdom before christmas she wasn't glory to god and i started praying she's she was she was still in england i pray i says okay you know when god tells you these things and you are new you think like oh come christmas day or come before christmas said you say praise the lord and give my life to the lord that's what i was looking for i prayed finally long story short i had a breakthrough in the spirit i knew something had happened i'm looking i'm like lord what's what's happening i ain't seeing the changes he says no we have had the victory in the spirit now watch for the manifestation and one time i was walking in the in toronto and i'm walking led by the spirit and as i was walking my thoughts and my prayers way upon my wife and stuff like that about her salvation and stuff like that whilst that's all ongoing what's that all unfolding and stuff like that i begin to walk by a creek it was actually in the evening time because that's how it unfolded and i'm walking by a little creek in the park and stuff like that and i stop and the spirit of god says the water you're looking at right now signifies a baptism this is before she ever set foot in canada this is when she's still wearing pants no i'm not shaming my wife she knows that you know i'm just giving a reference the word is sent forth to deliver us when all that had happened and i stopped in my mind i'm like i can't understand this lord do you mean i'm going to come to this creek and baptize there you know i i linked up there for a while i linger linga then i walked on i realized the spirit of god says you got to move on i begin to move on and as i begin to move on i'm seeing things in the city and stuff like that i've been listening to to to to the bible as i was walking but i was walking in the spirit as i'm walking in the spirit i see a billboard i see that he says oh that's the last thing for her to be delivered from spirit of tv television i'm like okay i'm gonna see that as i see that i'm tired now because i've been walking for a little while and believe it or not friends i came to a street in toronto it's it's expelled i'll give the spelling to you w-a-k-u-n-d-a street wakunder street i kid you not that word in my language means you have the victory i stopped i'm like what what am i saying here i stopped i'm like is this a sign or something this is before nothing has ever happened as i stop there and i'm contemplating and i'm tired and i'm saying okay i'm gonna go on to the next street and then i'll take the bus home because i'm tired now you know i've been walking while i've been in space and stuff like that god has been speaking to me for the salvation of us all right as i reach there and i'm thinking wakunda means here's the victory god says look look at since he says what what's what's that another street sunrise i'm like that's strange just around the i'm not getting my meaning that whilst i'm thinking imagine that the street i'm supposed to get into to go home it's called victoria street hallelujah this is before she ever set a foot in canada bottom line i saw the story unfold so when she came to be baptized here then god began to show that oh no it simply means i was showing you signs there's signs and wonders around you all the time she walked and there was such a fight she could tell you the day she got baptized it's such a fight like it wasn't gonna happen and stuff like i never pushed her she could tell you when she come came and says here honey i go to church you know i become a christian i go mondays i go you know sometimes fridays prayer meetings and i go sundays not mondays wednesdays sunday wednesdays and fridays you know i said that's what they do i say if you want you come to with me if you want to stay home and that's what i said that's what i said not that i didn't want you to come to church but you can't force this thing or nobody the gospel is a convention of conviction and i seen him walk up and get baptized you know i guess but god bless but the dale god gave me a little bit of connection there you know so these things are dear to my heart you know she got baptized and down the road she can testify we're not going to get into that but but but but she got converted she got filled with the holy spirit she gave he gave a life to the lord all those things unfolded so to me when i'm preaching these things i'm preaching personally i might not give that testimony word for word i hate it the last time i came but that's not how the spirit of god led you know so you are targeting souls way before that after my conversion after god filled me with the holy spirit he came forth the spirit of god was dealing with me you know yeah in the hallelujahs you know you know sometimes we get a little cold you know in the end the holidays i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them i'm singing i'm going to work it's all singing and all the spirit of god overweight i begin to talk to somebody i'm prophesying to them i don't even know they say how do you know those things i'm like wow what's happening to me i'm selling the hallelujahs right and you feel like men are gonna tear everything up that's how you feel but uh of course then god will teach you patience will teach you patients way before she ever came into canada god spoke to me and said you shall have a daughter and call your name patience and i wrote it down somebody also because he wasn't a christian somebody now prophesies falsely to her and say wow you have a son first i said honey we'll see who god was speaking to if it's a son then i was wrong if it's a it's a daughter who comes first well then of course you see soft your daughter came so it's normal i'm not saying this to make myself anything but i believe in a present tense god god is working even here when you look at it in the bigger picture a place where people are just loving each other you know brother barnum let me put it this way but the bottom part is i'll rather have a church that's united in love than a gifted church so i'm not glorifying gifts as a matter of fact to show you that's not what i'm glorifying one time i was now walking towards church anybody was familiar with with the toronto area i was walking from scarborough town center because the church our church is not too far from that and as i was walking there i wasn't driving at the time so i would use the bus so it stopped this scab return center i decided to walk it was a sunday i believe and i'm walking towards church and there's this footbridge that is glass around and man i feel the hallelujahs inside of them and and i'm walking and i'm walking as i'm walking a little bird the flu bam in front of me and hit itself and drop down and died in front of me i'm like okay so you know you're feeling that you feel like okay i want to exercise my faith so so i stopped there because god had been dealing with me with something about saul and i and and and i stopped there and as i stopped there i'm thinking what's the point of this it just happened right in front of me i picked up the bird i held it in my hand i started walking i walked maybe towed just as long as maybe towards the the front door there and i came to a bin that was right there and i i stopped there i said lord this bird just flew and he died in front of me if you want to raise it it's fine if you don't want to raise it i feel compelled to pick it but if you don't want to raise it i'm throwing it now in the bin that's what i say to god and as soon as i say that i feel the power arise out of me and i say little bird i give you your life then it went away i'm like whoa what's happening here so i wasn't overly excited it's almost like okay what happened then i walked another distance almost maybe the same thing and i feel the spirit of god and says stop i'm walking i stop now this wasn't no audible voice i stopped as soon as i stopped i hear now what now you're gonna have a testimony that you prayed for a bird and i raised it up then what was the rebuke i stopped i'm like yeah this little bird shall die one day again so what he said from now onwards let your passion be solved this is before the salvation so i come for souls friends that's what i come for i don't come to make myself anything you know we have read so much of that in the message you know big means and small small use you know that's the quotation that we're just reading there there but they'll head on to this there's no big me and small use there's no top ten in the message when it's the top ten everybody's excited and they erect themselves in atmosphere and it's a big and meanwhile maybe no one ever gets saved no one ever get delivered people go back and go into fornication people go back and go into adultery people go back and go into life people go back and go into pornography because that's the spirit tormenting a lot of the young people that i met pornography friends that's weak if you die in that state pretty much without deliverance you go to hell you better be delivered from that you better go to your past and say i got a problem because the bible say confess your fourth one to another i need to be delivered i come to understand that even mary don't help people from stopping pornography when i was a sinner i was caught up in that spirit so i ain't talking down to anybody but you need deliverance hallelujah you need the deliverance you need to die out to those things hallelujah you are not supposed to be in the maritime and watch pornography and try to find a in relations with your wife that's of the devil you've got to come clean the holy spirit is a clean spirit pornography is like a national international epidemic in messages i have testimonies of people with demonic manifesting come to think about it it's caught up in a pornographic spirit you've got to be delivered i believe in the old sanctification gospel where you are cleansed from these things because they that do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of god there's no use and you can argue about traditions you can argue about message doctrine this is not messy doctrine this is clean living you find people in message pulpit calling themselves filled and committing adultery you're not even sanctified must alone filled with the holy ghost you find ministers caught up in pornography oh man they can preach like lightning hallelujah they can take you to the heavens but when it comes to simple clean living when it comes to bed biting other ministers apparently i won't go into certain things when it comes to the i've experienced that with ministers some of the biggest gospels is ministers i don't need no minister's permission to breathe for brother dale i need to hear the voice of god well he tried doesn't mean that with disrespect ministries no you don't do that because the man is in charge you don't go to a man's home and just start talking to his wife can you cook food for me well it's the husband so so i'm not saying that the pastor is the husband now i'm just using an illustration here you know but people need to be set free it's simple friends if you got hatred in your heart you don't have love if you got hatred in your heart you have things to deal with if you got wrath in your heart you got the spirit of canaan if you got strife strife people strive marriage over anything over where to put a chair way to do that my goodness over what pots and pans husband what are you doing asking about puts and pants heresies i like to put that because in denominations harris is in the message some of them brother branham will come and preach again friends better just leave it or not some of them there's no blood so are you preaching divine salvation then if there is no more blood there is not even divine healing because his blood was shed for healing what kind of funny stuff is that and then cry that your children be saved if there's no blood that they can't be saved then what kind of understanding is that heresies got to be said friends hallelujah wow the bible says this we must make our calling and the election show the bible also talk about strive to enter into the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter indians shall not be able people like to put this in the denomination i don't oh of course that's part of that you see why don't you put in the denomination by the james well the sad thing if you look in multi 25 when brother branham is talking about the 10 virgins and five were wise and five were foolish they were all virgins so they were all living sanctified life they were actually above these things that we are looking at i don't idolatry witchcraft they were above those things if people who were above those things could become the foolish virgins how much more when they are caught in those things they were living holy christian sanctified you say why message because you go into the pentecostal denominations holy see maybe to them they don't penis they don't leave holiness in the methodist churches anymore and stuff like that they got their creeds and dogmas women with shorts and all kind of stuff you really think that's what the bible is saying but these virgins were good sanctified message people in my view i know brother means they talk of pentecostal those were the we are the people today closest to the truth so these were good message sanctified people they didn't make their calling and the election sure they assumed because we are in the message we got the holy ghost they assumed perhaps that because we are born in the message we got the holy ghost and when the showdown came they were left behind we were supposed to be in the rapture and say it's going on you don't even know you were not wise so they had now to die in the tribulation they were not lost now but they had to die in the tribulation that's how brother brother puts it because he says he said verily i say unto you i know you not in other words i never put my life inside of you i never had a relationship with you he said they shall be whipping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourself trust out let this not be us friends let that not be you the bible says study to show yourself approved before god is my life pleasing unto god am i meeting you know i'll wind down with the quotes that's all i'll close up with but the branham especially to those who think he never made mistakes this is brother branham before being baptized with the holy ghost remember he had already given his life to the lord now remember he already knew that he had a gift because ever since he was young he used to see visions remember all at this time when he's saying these things he has all those things in the background he started with this one in my life story in 1950 it says an old colored man a little bit of rim here around like that walking out like this you know and then this old man come out i thought look like they have some of the young men preaching instead of that old man about that he's being he's being nigh he's come where they bringing a dead person almost dying he said now the preacher has been preaching about the baptism of the holy spirit this is in mishawaka when he started his first interaction with the pentecostal denominational people he says about time he got preaching there about five minutes that all stopped of men let out the yelp and screamed and jumped up in the air and clicked these hills together throw these chests back and say well he ain't got enough room up here for me to preach i looked at that and i said ma that is what i want this is your prophet if it will make an old man act like that what would he do to me he was a young man at that time why i thought that's what i want and i said i ain't going home till i found more about this he was making his election and calling sure then he goes on to hear he gone to pray to god he says i knelt down and said oh god then people got something that i want i said let me hear some of that he goes on i jump i'm jumping parts of it now it goes into when hope is dying she said one thing promised me too that you never let loose but you preached the gospel that you had up there in mishiwaka i said i promise the message never took that away the message never took away the baptism of the holy ghost by an experience hallelujah and about that time or he goes into that he can check that in my life story i'm gonna jump them he says it because he spoke about my life story many different times you know that he said that but there's something that that i want to say wait wait wait wait wait he says let me jump some of all these quotes his quotes that i have then he went through a searching then he gave people speaking in tongues as you know and then he says see one was living in adultery he got confused he pulled back if you remember and then he listened to his mother-in-law he got into trouble but now when he's giving an account of his conversion this is not an account of giving his life to the lord because he did that in the shed he was already a person giving his life to the lord in the missionary baptist church living his christian life clean as he could be remember even when he was a sinner i live clean because the voice told him don't drink don't smoke don't do all these things and this is why i can call him my prophet i want you to hear this he says in a little old saloon from that time 1960 0302 that had been used as a church where some colored people was preaching the gospel this is no more in mishawaka now this is a different old converted salon i was a southerner i want to hear it i know we are a mixed audience here a few mixed audiences i was a southerner and didn't like colored people this is your prophet saying this that man i can listen to that man who can say i used to hate colored people but can be converted to preach the gospel of god until i see the resurrected christ i can listen to that man that's an honest man hallelujah but god humbled him the prophet of the age to get the holy ghost he had to go to people he didn't like let me read that again i was a south and it looks like we got a lot of southerners sometimes and didn't like the colored people didn't like the colored people so he is a man who in his heart doesn't like colored people even while he's still not liking people colored people and their vision came and told me where to go find it he moved back by vision because by his own natural position he wouldn't have done that because he didn't like them and all the white girls and i'd went with not all of them four or five standing they said billy you are not going in there remember also this is way back in the in the 30s so things were really really hot so friends so don't think i'm throwing anything to any any one of you folks i hope that's not anybody thinks we're just saying something here i'm reading a court and then we'll wind down with that he said billy you're not going in there i said yes i've got to i guess this time he wasn't married or maybe his wife would hope or he died i don't know he said said don't never ask me for another date so they all didn't like other people so today in today's language they'll say you're the prejudice racist or whatever that's what they'll say he said it didn't make any difference i met god and from that time i've been changed can point back to that time i was changed then he puts these friends he said no man has a right in the pulpit until he's got an experience no matter what the intellectuals can say you know when you met god hallelujah he gives an account of the same thing without man without price in 1959 but from a different angle he said in a bunch of little so-called holy rollers one night i found what i wanted that money could not buy in a bunch of illiterate uneducated poorly dressed people negroes to begin with out yonder in an old converted salon on the floor i found a prize a jewel when that old ducky looked in my face and said have you received the holy ghost since you believe oh it was something that i wanted i didn't expect it to find it amongst those people but they had what i needed i ain't trying to put up the colored people some of them colored people in africa they sold their own bread to slavery so don't just say white white white this you think the white people had connections in africa to know where to go they did their own fellow villagers and sold them i ain't no politician i know he said i'm preaching the gospel way with that spirit every little problem the black guy has it's the white man's fault even if he opens the school and you don't want to go it's the white person's fault even if he worked hard to get his money ah it's his fault well work don't sit down do something we want to balance things i love brother bonham so he would rely on his church he wouldn't rely on his pastor at that time i think maybe roy davis whoever he was he says i got to learn god for myself i got to get an experience for myself i got to make my calling in the election show i said be your holy name for the god i didn't know how things would go lord forgive me lord we have mumbled and stumbled on my words what has been said in error or in mistake that's not my objective law my objective is to catch somebody so that someone falls in love with you that somebody get delivered oh god sister leon if you want to play something softly you just feel like winding down this way oh i surrender all or something like that god is present god is he uses each one of us according to all makeup according to on temperance but i don't believe that god brings forth a message for the sake of doing it don't be satisfied just because you've been a message member you've been born in the message or even just because you've been living a clean sanctified life that's all good but you must have a direct personal experience with your god i don't know how he don't do it he might not do it like brother brahm where you found it in the floor you could be on the road you could be on the phone talking to somebody maybe a pastor sometimes it's you have to recognize that god sends a pastor as a gift to help you but a gift is not going to help you until you receive it it's not a gift until you receive it completely it's not a gift hallelujah thank you jesus oh father i pray for this church church your god is shaking coming speak in the name of the lord your god is shaking coming don't entertain that spirit of gossip but the banham in the christ the mystery of god revealed thy soul that put on a picture for him in the pastor's office there see the devil will use somebody he won't let you continue as one big bunch to try any spirit that tried to undercut the influence of your pastor to you that's not of god even if bastard dale would make a mistake if you allow that spirit that's not of god you got to realize that god sent him as a gift to you to help you you pray for him you pray for his family you pray for his labor he's just a man like you but god put him in charge that's what that quotation say if i'll read it it puts it this way says stay with your pastor he's your shepherd and you give him respect of course that doesn't mean you give him the respects due to god you respect him in the office that he holds in the message respect but brother balaam speak about that they have seen congregations ask their past and so on and whatnot this is how is he ever going to help you so when that shaking time that is soon come i don't know when when that happens friends remember remember so that you can stand with your pastor satan is an accused of the brethren you don't know about your pastor through gossip if you have a question go to god that's what i did when i wanted to know something about my pastor because they would think that i could look even myself as a man as a matter of fact before god ever filled me with the holy spirit because he filled me whilst i was on my knees in my own room praying with my hands the spirit of god says this one thing you must needs make right and say what is it lord say i want you to change your attitude about your pastor i gave him as a gift to you that you may receive the holy ghost it was what i wanted believing the message is all good but that's just a start you got to have your own personal connection and he led captivity coveted and he gave gifts unto men oh father thank you father for your people thank you father for your word having effect of somebody i want you to examine your heart whatsoever is upon your heart if it's a besetting sin if it's something you need to be delivered from if the spirit of pornography well your pastor will pray for you you need to speak to him hallelujah thank you jesus you need to speak to him then god will deliver you don't be ashamed the bible says if you are shamed hallelujah of him he will also be ashamed of you before the holy angels so you know i got to know that you're exposing the devil when you do that a spirit has been exposed you don't have to go bound if you've become a little cold with god you just need a renewal sometime sometimes it's just you to shout out sing out a little louder and that's all you need because human beings we get a little bit starchy when we get into routine sometimes you may find that you become irritable with your husband or with your wife it's just human being maybe you just need to go out for a day or two away from home you know away from the routine and you can renew your relationship not everything is spiritual whatsoever place you are let god speak to your heart i want you to hold that request in your heart i don't know what that request did you know it it could be your loved one it could be anything it could be that you need that holy spirit of promise a supernatural experience that only god can give you you don't have it because you've believed the message in the book of acts it says have you received the holy ghost since you believed not when you believed oh father i haven't come to be different i've come just to be a help to you i haven't come for that friends thank you jesus hallelujah let's sing i will live [Music] eyes are [Music] whatever request you have in your heart hold it raise your right hand to god and pastor they will pray for you [Music] pastor dale you can come pray for those who have their requests just raise your hands to god thank you [Music] [Music] take me jesus take [Music] is [Music] thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus for this time thank you for your servant brother james thank you for your word lord jesus thank you for your presence [Music] lord jesus just as the word went forth and it's just changing us lord jesus to come into the image of your perfect wife blessed be your name lord jesus be with this beautiful purchase of your blood lord jesus beautiful bride of christ help us lord jesus be so salty and our light shine bright that our neighbors will see jesus [Music] our neighbors just last week [Music] said your people were dressed so beautiful [Music] that me and my wife thought you were having a wedding [Music] god bringing that last seed in this area maybe right in this town or right in the world that we individually work in or live in and we give you the glory and honor for all of eternity bless our brother james lord you know how my heart rejoiced when he drove it it was so good to see him so great to have fellowship with him and his family can't even imagine what heaven will be like around the table with the bride of christ beyond comprehension jesus jesus help me forgive me jesus all my false senses hallelujah thank you for this beautiful day lord jesus bless our fellowship bless brother james pastor bless louise nelson we've had great men of god come here and minister brother james brother emmanuel different ones lord bless them lord jesus just

lord jesus
