[29:20] she she went and traveled with us and
[29:23] she was
[29:24] instrumental in in the trip and you know
[29:28] there and I I took that from your pastor
[29:31] you know brother Dale told me a long
[29:32] time ago when he started going on trips
[29:34] how important it was to the sisters that
[29:38] that the husband comes with the wife so
[29:40] that they get some fellowship too and um
[29:43] you know seeing that firstand uh was was
[29:47] significant Laura actually she got a a
[29:49] lot of Fellowship developed a lot of
[29:51] friendships but she was also able to um
[29:54] minister in ways that that I can't and
[29:57] so
[29:58] sister Lan coming and and the girls I
[30:01] know it was it was beneficial to to all
[30:04] of them yeah was very
[30:08] significant thank
[30:10] you and
[30:12] I'm still waiting uh we got lot of
[30:17] time there we go we're getting
[30:23] there all right thank you Jesus okay if
[30:27] you go to the the next
[30:29] slide uh just a a geography lesson of
[30:33] where where uh El Salvador is they're in
[30:36] Central America surrounded by uh
[30:39] Honduras Nicaragua uh Guatemala um of
[30:43] course you know brother brother Dell and
[30:46] sister L traveled through Honduras to to
[30:48] minister in Nicaragua um next slide
[30:52] please uh we were in uh Samuel which is
[30:56] there in the eastern part of the the
[30:58] country uh kind of highlighted there
[31:00] with that that little yellow
[31:03] star um we flew into San Salvador and
[31:06] between San Salvador and Samuel was um
[31:09] about a three-hour drive so the roads
[31:13] weren't very good I think you know if we
[31:15] were driving in the here in Canada on an
[31:17] interstate it probably been maybe an
[31:19] hour and a half but uh I tell you uh i'
[31:23] I've every time I go to another country
[31:26] I'm always come back and I'm so grateful
[31:28] for our traffic laws it's like I get
[31:31] annoyed by speed limits here and I get
[31:34] annoyed by by having to wait for a red
[31:36] light when there's nobody around but
[31:38] when you travel to other countries and
[31:40] they don't have those those laws and um
[31:43] it makes you very appreciative of of the
[31:45] order that our laws bring uh next slide
[31:49] please so just a uh there I'm sorry yeah
[31:53] that's a picture of Lura and I as we got
[31:55] there um
[31:58] tell we're we're so happy to to be there
[32:00] excited uh next slide um the average
[32:05] monthly income in El Salvador is under
[32:08] $500 which is in incredible especially
[32:12] when you consider that everything there
[32:14] is priced in US Dollars and almost all
[32:18] of it is priced at us prices so they're
[32:21] paying the same same price per gallon
[32:23] for a for a a gasoline that that we are
[32:28] um and then only having that much income
[32:31] so you can see where it' be very
[32:33] difficult for people to uh survive uh
[32:37] they they do all their transactions in
[32:39] in dollars and
[32:40] Bitcoins um and I know that you're are
[32:43] aware of this but just to to mention it
[32:45] is that the country is is become very
[32:47] safe and that's because they have a
[32:50] president who went after all of the
[32:52] gangs and um the the problem causers
[32:57] unfortunately a lot of those people
[32:58] escaped to my
[33:03] country but um it's very severe if they
[33:06] get caught there it's a 50-year sentence
[33:08] just for being a gang member uh you
[33:10] can't appeal it you're you're once
[33:13] you're identified and you are convicted
[33:15] you're going to jail for pretty much the
[33:17] rest of your life um and I kind of
[33:20] wonder what's going to happen as uh our
[33:23] country is uh in the US has said that
[33:26] they're dedicated now to removing those
[33:30] criminal elements that have that have
[33:32] made it to America uh so I I'm for my
[33:36] sake and my country's sake I'm glad to
[33:37] see those people deported and I'm very
[33:40] happy happy to have criminals deported
[33:43] but also for our friends uh in El
[33:46] Salvador it does make me a little
[33:48] concerned you know that these people are
[33:50] going to be flown back into their
[33:51] country and what kind of impact they'll
[33:53] have before they're rounded up and and
[33:55] put into prison but the country was very
[33:58] safe we felt very welcome and at home uh
[34:02] you get the next slide
[34:04] please uh this was the major volcano we
[34:07] were around um it always seemed to have
[34:11] smoke coming out of the top of it there
[34:12] are 170 total volcanoes in El Salvador
[34:17] um and 23 active so it's not a uh it's
[34:22] not like here could be very
[34:24] dangerous uh just just uh from the the
[34:28] geography of the place they're part of
[34:30] that ring of fire right right there uh
[34:34] next slide
[34:35] please uh just a couple pictures to give
[34:38] I'm trying to give you a sense of the
[34:39] country uh this was a a picture of a
[34:41] typical residential street uh for the
[34:45] most part very clean but you can see
[34:47] where there's bars on all the windows
[34:48] everything's built out of concrete uh
[34:51] everything is enclosed so people don't
[34:54] have um like a grassy front yard like we
[34:58] do in North America or anything like
[35:00] that no everything is enclosed by
[35:01] concrete and you have Courtyards and um
[35:05] I think that that uh uh you know comes
[35:10] probably from the criminal element that
[35:12] they've always had to be protecting
[35:13] themselves from uh next slide
[35:17] please uh and so here's a typical view
[35:21] of the the city streets uh I wish I had
[35:24] taken pictures of like the two-way
[35:27] traffic but this is just a one way you
[35:29] can see it's pretty congested and and uh
[35:32] there's businesses and shops pretty much
[35:34] I noticed that uh if you were on a
[35:37] street that received any kind of traffic
[35:40] uh everybody had a business of some sort
[35:43] right out the front door of their of
[35:45] their place whether it was selling bags
[35:47] of bread or water or coconut water
[35:51] everybody was trying to make a living if
[35:52] there was any possible way of doing it
[35:56] um next slide please please here's a
[35:59] picture of a a couple of the the
[36:01] children that that really uh blessed me
[36:04] uh and my wife uh this they're just they
[36:08] were just real beautiful and and they
[36:09] were so open and so friendly this little
[36:12] girl here I was in the pastor study my
[36:14] first time at the church and uh she came
[36:18] in and uh just she knocked on the door I
[36:20] opened it up and she just walked in and
[36:23] she just kind of looked looked at me and
[36:24] she looked around and she's you know
[36:26] like felt like she was his knee high and
[36:29] she stuck her hand up and she was like
[36:31] God bless
[36:33] you and so I I had a conversation with
[36:36] her in Spanish and uh which was just
[36:39] about perfect because that's about the
[36:41] level of Spanish I speak so we we had a
[36:44] great time having a little conversation
[36:46] there in the pastor study but she was
[36:48] just a real sweetheart and then uh this
[36:51] young boy uh Mato my wife we'll we'll
[36:54] talk a little bit about him um next
[36:56] slide please
[36:58] the these are just a couple scenes of
[37:00] some of the fellowship and uh we had a
[37:03] wonderful time just talking with the
[37:05] Brethren and the and the sisters um is
[37:08] very humble not not like uh we have here
[37:12] uh you can see there in that middle
[37:14] middle photograph if you notice at the
[37:16] bottom they chickens walking around
[37:18] underneath the underneath the table as
[37:20] we were eating and uh um so it's very
[37:23] very rustic uh but you know it was happy
[37:28] amen it was happy it was it wasn't like
[37:31] like when I when I sat there and I'm
[37:33] fellowshipping with these people I
[37:36] didn't feel bad for them because of what
[37:38] what they didn't have compared to us
[37:41] they they were happy with what they had
[37:43] and I was I I was happy with them I felt
[37:47] I felt completely and totally at home
[37:50] and very
[37:51] comfortable uh just a real genuine
[37:53] Spirit of
[37:55] hospitality um next
[37:58] please just a couple pictures of the
[38:00] sisters preparing the foods and and they
[38:03] believe me they worked so hard to to
[38:06] feed us it seemed like every every time
[38:09] we got done eating and we we tried to
[38:11] push back from the table they would push
[38:13] us right back in and give us more
[38:15] food and I I ate more food in a day that
[38:19] I think that I do in a week at
[38:22] home uh and finally I just cuz like I
[38:25] you know I'm the type of person I'm on a
[38:26] missions trip I'm just going to eat eat
[38:27] what you provide and I'm going to eat it
[38:29] and be grateful for it and uh and they
[38:32] fed me so much eventually I just started
[38:33] to have to break my own Rule and say no
[38:35] I don't want any no thank
[38:38] you but uh next slide please uh so these
[38:42] are just a couple photos I took of the
[38:45] some of the Mills there you see they're
[38:47] very humble they're nothing you know
[38:49] extraordinarily fancy um very much based
[38:53] on corn and uh uh
[38:58] the the sisters put a lot of effort and
[39:00] time into these and these These are
[39:02] their traditional meals what they eat
[39:03] every every day um but they love going
[39:07] to McDonald's and Pizza Hut and every
[39:11] everywhere else but uh we when Laura and
[39:15] I were there we was like we don't really
[39:16] want to go to any of those places if if
[39:18] we can avoid them we know you like them
[39:19] but just we'll just eat simple stuff uh
[39:22] and so uh they took care of us very well
[39:25] uh next slide please
[39:28] uh these are the couple translators that
[39:29] we worked with um the the one on the top
[39:32] left brother Raphael he was very very
[39:34] dear to me he uh did a lot of personal
[39:37] translating for me amen and actually
[39:40] came came with me to uh other churches
[39:43] to to translate just my personal
[39:46] conversations um on the far right the
[39:49] gentleman there is brother loo and he he
[39:53] actually is lives in the United States
[39:55] he's he's from um oh I I forget the
[40:00] Trinidad Dominican Republic that's it
[40:02] yeah and he was just a very very special
[40:05] brother an excellent
[40:07] translator um a beautiful singer and
[40:11] worshipper he he just one of those
[40:13] people that just brings the presence of
[40:16] God and um uh he he it's not a show with
[40:21] him he he doesn't put on a show when he
[40:23] sings he he's very animated enthusiastic
[40:26] but he's not perform performing not he's
[40:28] not a performer now now i' I've been
[40:30] around singers who perform and and you
[40:33] know they're performing because they
[40:35] they have just certain movements they do
[40:37] and it's it's very choreographed and uh
[40:40] not brother brother loo he's he's just
[40:43] 100% uh totally invested uh into God and
[40:48] what God's given him and uh I just came
[40:50] away with just a tremendous amount of
[40:52] respect for this brother um a very deep
[40:55] love uh for for God's bride and what
[40:58] he's done we I want I wish that all of
[41:02] us could be as faithful to our gifts as
[41:04] brother Leno is to his um now the there
[41:08] on the bottom left this that's brother
[41:10] William he's a a very excellent
[41:12] translator and he actually I wanted to
[41:15] show him and also let you know that he
[41:17] was one of the the three or four
[41:19] Brethren that was working on the final
[41:22] translation project to put all of the
[41:25] messages into uh space Spanish and that
[41:28] only completed about 4 years ago and so
[41:31] these brothers worked and a couple
[41:33] sisters worked on doing the final
[41:35] translation for about 10 years and and
[41:39] it was only completed four years ago
[41:41] because Jeffersonville and the voice of
[41:43] God they'd only translated a limited
[41:45] number of of sermons into Spanish and
[41:48] Spanish has spoken over half the world
[41:51] as so um you know they they they divided
[41:54] up their resources for whatever reasons
[41:56] to to to get the what they call the seed
[41:59] Library into more places but brother
[42:01] William and these other brothers and
[42:03] sisters that he worked with they picked
[42:06] the the torch and They carried it to the
[42:07] finish line and did a wonderful job and
[42:10] he's just a very special very special
[42:13] young man and uh I I pray for him he uh
[42:19] he he is someone and I I not to say too
[42:23] much about him but he needs prayer he's
[42:25] very uh Melancholy person
[42:27] and he he goes highs and lows and it's
[42:32] not like he's bipolar or something like
[42:33] that but um like brother brandom when he
[42:36] was in the presence of God it's this
[42:38] extreme high like like he talked to us
[42:40] about Elijah when the presence of God
[42:42] left him he found himself in a cave you
[42:44] know um and so he's a lot like that and
[42:48] it my heart really was was burden for
[42:51] himed and I just would ask that you
[42:52] remember him in prayer he's done so much
[42:54] for the the work of the Lord um but he's
[42:57] terribly Afflicted in that way uh next
[43:00] slide please this is the first church
[43:03] that we preached at Pastor uh Gerardo uh
[43:07] Gerardo um and his family here we took a
[43:11] couple pictures just a really precious
[43:13] brother um older uh we had a wonderful
[43:16] time with this uh this service was very
[43:19] special um I took a actually I preached
[43:22] the same sermon that I preached here on
[43:24] the blood still speaking and and if you
[43:26] recall I played that that clip of
[43:27] brother brandom and he's he was praying
[43:30] for the the little Mexican boy that was
[43:33] with cancer and uh if you remember he
[43:37] was he said you know he was praying to
[43:38] God and he's he was saying you know God
[43:40] surely wouldn't do this he was like and
[43:43] God just told Brother random well I'm
[43:44] waiting to see what you're going to do
[43:46] and so I I preached that sermon here and
[43:49] we uh it really it really did Bless the
[43:52] people and uh we ended up having a
[43:54] prayer line and something kind of
[43:56] extraordinary happen in that uh and I
[43:59] don't I don't say this to to any any
[44:02] Glory of mine at all um but there was
[44:05] there were several heal healings that
[44:06] came from that prayer line but something
[44:08] else that was extraordinary that
[44:09] happened was they had given me a bottle
[44:12] of anointing oil uh uh as people would
[44:16] come up and I I would I started putting
[44:20] it down at my feet I was off the
[44:22] platform and I I put it down at my feet
[44:25] and I praying for people I just pied
[44:27] pick it up and um and use it and I place
[44:30] it back down again and I noticed as I
[44:33] was praying for for the for the people
[44:36] that um brother a couple of the brothers
[44:40] that were up there they became very
[44:42] concerned about that bottle of oil on
[44:45] the on the ground and uh eventually one
[44:49] of them picked it up and was just would
[44:50] hold it for me
[44:53] and uh I was talking to him afterwards
[44:57] about the spirit and things being
[45:01] genuine and and I reminded them brother
[45:04] that I don't know if you've ever heard
[45:06] the testimony I think it was brother
[45:07] bisc or maybe it was brother Perry green
[45:09] that was watching brother brandom
[45:11] preaching and brother brandom had a a
[45:13] microphone that had a cord and somehow
[45:17] during brother Brandon's preaching he's
[45:18] moving around and that cord became
[45:21] wrapped around his leg and uh whichever
[45:25] one of these brothers was telling I just
[45:27] can't remember off the top of my head
[45:28] said that he was he became very
[45:30] concerned about it he and all he could
[45:32] think about was brother Brandon's going
[45:33] to trip and he's going to make a fool of
[45:35] himself in the prayer line is going to
[45:37] be embarrassed and he said right before
[45:39] his eyes that that cord vanished and
[45:43] straightened out off of his
[45:45] leg and uh and I I reminded the brothers
[45:48] of this and and I said you know what was
[45:51] happening there in that prayer line was
[45:54] was sincere and genuine it was a real
[45:56] move of God and I said I never even
[45:59] thought I was moving around all over the
[46:01] place I never even thought once about
[46:03] that bottle of oil I didn't look down to
[46:05] see where if I was close to it or the
[46:07] only time I looked for that thing was
[46:09] when I was picking it up to use it for
[46:11] the next person and I said you so I was
[46:14] teaching them you know when when God is
[46:16] doing something and it is a real genuine
[46:18] move of God you're not going to do
[46:21] something that's going to embarrass
[46:22] yourself or embarrass him God's going to
[46:24] completely take care of you and I uh you
[46:28] know you you've all probably seen it
[46:31] when people
[46:33] impersonate the things of God and say
[46:35] the the spirit comes down and and uh
[46:38] people are swaying and they're falling
[46:41] down you know uh running around with
[46:43] their eyes closed and if that's a real
[46:46] move of God that person is never going
[46:48] to they could fall off the the edge of
[46:51] the Earth and and bounce you know 6et
[46:53] down on a concrete and they get right
[46:55] back up they're not even going to have a
[46:57] scratch on
[46:58] them um but then when you see somebody
[47:00] else that's uh under the under you know
[47:04] that is putting it on a little bit and
[47:06] In the Flesh they're swinging around
[47:08] they might whack somebody across the
[47:09] face you know because they're they're
[47:12] not really truly in the spirit um amen
[47:16] amen but if you're in the spirit you're
[47:18] never going to do that you're never
[47:19] going to hurt somebody else or or be
[47:22] hurt and so I was trying to teach te I I
[47:25] I was this is that lesson
[47:27] that this this was genuine and you you
[47:29] brothers were so concerned that I was
[47:31] going to knock over and spill that
[47:33] bottle of oil embarrass myself or
[47:35] embarrass embarrass you that you missed
[47:38] out on what God was doing there were
[47:40] people that were genuinely being healed
[47:42] in that prayer line and um uh so I it
[47:47] was a good lesson for them to
[47:49] learn uh amen next slide please amen
[47:57] uh the the next church we spoke at
[47:59] Pastor Nelson uh Savia uh the next day I
[48:03] beautiful beautiful church this
[48:05] wonderful people we had a a a a healing
[48:09] line there as well uh one of the
[48:11] testimonies that really uh stands out to
[48:14] me on this this particular uh service in
[48:18] that prayer line they brought they
[48:19] brought a little baby to be to be prayed
[48:21] for and the baby was just burning up
[48:24] with fever and um I I placed the parents
[48:28] were holding it and I put my hands
[48:29] around his his stomach and I could just
[48:32] feel the heat off of the the poor thing
[48:35] and uh we we prayed for it by the by the
[48:38] grace of God the parents told me after
[48:40] the service by the time that they walked
[48:42] back to their seat the fever was
[48:45] completely
[48:46] gone and that's that's
[48:49] just it it touches your heart you know
[48:52] and but that's what God has to do you
[48:55] know he's promised he's going to do it
[48:57] he backs up the word with signs and
[48:59] wonders and there's no reason to be
[49:02] Wishy aashi about it um when we in that
[49:06] call in that position uh we H we have
[49:09] the authority as the Bride of Jesus
[49:12] Christ to to to write the checks and and
[49:16] sign them uh he's going to he's he's
[49:19] there to uh meet every need thank you
[49:24] Lord uh and so that was that was that
[49:27] was just real Precious for for me to see
[49:30] that in action you know like a lot of
[49:32] times you pray for people you know in
[49:34] North America and they don't have the
[49:36] faith to believe it because they're
[49:39] they're afraid God's not going to honor
[49:41] his word they got more fear than Faith
[49:44] right and um uh I think you're and you
[49:49] know this that other countries they they
[49:51] operate just a little bit differently
[49:52] than than we do here in North
[49:55] America I wish we could be more like
[49:58] them amen uh next slide please uh we
[50:01] went then to the anniversary meetings uh
[50:04] at brother Edgar
[50:06] konas um for their 37th anniversary I I
[50:10] was able to to minister twice there it
[50:12] was a real blessing and I just uh took a
[50:16] couple of sermons that were very very
[50:18] simple and um people were I think were
[50:23] blessed by him one one thing that did
[50:26] come out of that
[50:27] that was unique was he told me that they
[50:31] I I opened up the services there on
[50:33] Wednesday which um he told me that they
[50:36] broadcast that uh on their on their
[50:39] YouTube p Channel and he said they had
[50:41] never ever had received the number of
[50:46] viewers that that they did as they did
[50:49] for that first sermon um and what was
[50:51] particular about it was like it the
[50:53] viewers was very small the viewership
[50:55] was very small
[50:57] and then as as the word started coming
[50:59] forth what must have happened was people
[51:02] started messaging people say hey this is
[51:05] this is being preached come and listen
[51:07] and so like you know after a little bit
[51:08] into the sermon the viewership just
[51:12] exploded um and so we've seen that that
[51:15] happen and they were brother Edgar was
[51:18] uh was just really excited about that um
[51:22] and I I was excited because you know
[51:24] that that meant that message was getting
[51:25] out to to more than just the local body
[51:28] and just pray that you know God does all
[51:31] things well and if if that word's going
[51:33] out then there's a reason for it and
[51:35] that people will be
[51:37] blessed uh the next next slide please um
[51:41] I wrapped up my my portion of the trip
[51:44] uh we left of course before brother Dell
[51:46] I spoke at brother javan's Church which
[51:49] was way out in the
[51:50] country and I I took a I think I even
[51:54] preached this sermon uh here on
[51:58] forgiveness and um very simple and in in
[52:02] this particular sermon I don't even I
[52:05] don't even mention brother brandom I
[52:07] don't say a quote it's all just based on
[52:12] scripture and uh I was preaching the
[52:15] sermon and it was such a heavy
[52:18] anointing it was just a real beautiful
[52:20] anointing when I first came out every
[52:21] you know it was just uh the crowd the
[52:25] the assembly it was just like let's go
[52:27] anything is possible and I I actually
[52:30] kind of had to settle settle things down
[52:33] because that this this this message
[52:35] isn't a that particular message isn't a
[52:38] like a a rah rah kind of a is it's one
[52:41] of those sermons that you really need to
[52:43] to sit and listen to and think about and
[52:45] I I not as the people calmed down
[52:49] something that I noticed was
[52:51] that uh people started getting out their
[52:53] cell phones and they started recording
[52:57] and um what what it reminded me of was
[53:00] is I I've always seen pictures of like
[53:02] the you know when people are at a
[53:03] concert and they hold up their lighters
[53:05] for whatever reason whatever reason they
[53:07] do but that's what it reminded me almost
[53:09] everybody had a cell phone up and
[53:11] started
[53:12] videotaping uh the service and
[53:17] um I I I think that was because they
[53:19] were being blessed by it was a it was a
[53:23] a very um a very good
[53:27] Service uh the message that went forth
[53:29] was was
[53:31] obviously needed and effective uh it was
[53:34] very well received and then I actually
[53:37] had other minister brother ask me for
[53:39] the notes on that because they wanted to
[53:41] preach it the same sermon at their home
[53:43] churches and so um I was I was very
[53:46] grateful for that we had a wonderful
[53:48] Fellowship there with the the
[53:51] church um next slide
[53:54] please uh so so I already told you about
[53:57] the the baby being healed um another
[54:00] another one was with there was a
[54:01] denominational Minister that had came
[54:04] and if I understood correctly uh brother
[54:07] Edgar was telling me that he had been
[54:09] friends with this denominational brother
[54:11] for many years as friend of his father
[54:13] but that based on those
[54:16] sermons he was accepting of the message
[54:21] and so uh you know when you have that
[54:24] then you a pastor who accepts it amen
[54:26] he's going to take that back to his
[54:28] church and there's going to be people in
[54:30] the church that accepts it and so I'm
[54:32] just really praying that the that God
[54:34] will move in that way and that many more
[54:37] souls will will be
[54:39] saved um
[54:42] uh next slide please sorry I kind of I
[54:45] think that was more my notes of a slide
[54:48] uh while we were there there was a there
[54:49] was a huge earthquake uh A 5.6 that
[54:53] happened just uh about 20 mi away from
[54:55] where we were at and uh it was
[54:59] interesting because it was the first
[55:00] earthquake that I've ever been been in
[55:02] has anybody else ever been in an
[55:04] earthquake a couple a couple people see
[55:08] we have earthquakes and we've had them
[55:10] where I live but I have never ever felt
[55:12] one and uh we were outside of church and
[55:15] fellowshipping and I felt this little
[55:19] bit of a a rumble in the ground and my
[55:21] first thought was that there was a a
[55:23] tractor trailer that was overloaded kind
[55:25] of going down the street street but then
[55:26] all of a sudden the ground started
[55:28] acting like uh I don't know if you ever
[55:30] been on a little boat in a in a one of
[55:33] the Lakes where the the waves were going
[55:35] up and down it started being like that
[55:37] and so then I was like oh wow this is an
[55:39] earthquake and I got
[55:41] excited like like John John has never
[55:44] experienced an earthquake and this is a
[55:46] bucket list thing and so uh you know and
[55:51] because I've never experienced one in a
[55:53] bad way you know like I've never been in
[55:54] a house I had to rush out of I've never
[55:56] been devastated I was excited and I was
[55:59] I was smiling ear to ear and I'm like
[56:02] wow this is crazy hey this an earthquake
[56:04] it and you know and then you start
[56:06] looking around and then all these people
[56:07] have their heads bowed and they're all
[56:08] praying
[56:11] desperately and I was like why are they
[56:14] all praying
[56:17] desperately but it was it was a pretty
[56:19] good one a lot of people ended up
[56:20] sleeping at sleeping outside that night
[56:23] because they were worried about
[56:24] aftershocks you know and and their
[56:26] houses
[56:27] collapsing uh but uh but for me I maybe
[56:31] next time I'll be more sensitive
[56:34] to but this time I definitely was not
[56:37] sensitive um uh next slide
[56:41] please uh this family in particular is
[56:44] one that really uh ha has a wonderful
[56:49] testimony the the
[56:50] mother uh there on the right that's
[56:53] that's the her three children
[56:56] and her husband actually had had left
[56:59] her and went to the states to work and
[57:02] for a while he supported her but then
[57:05] gradually they they stopped really being
[57:08] a husband and wife and he doesn't
[57:11] support her at all she's there on her
[57:13] own with these with the three kids now
[57:14] the boy's a little bit older I think
[57:16] he's
[57:16] 16 um but the youngest there uh this
[57:20] little guy is four and he's who I really
[57:22] want to talk
[57:23] about this little boy is is
[57:27] um is autistic and uh suffers from
[57:33] ADHD
[57:34] and they didn't know how to deal with
[57:37] that at all uh this mother was so
[57:40] overwhelmed by this little boy that he
[57:43] would he would run out of the out of
[57:45] their home into traffic he'd almost been
[57:48] killed several times uh they have great
[57:51] big concrete basins of water uh he had
[57:54] jumped in that and almost Dr several
[57:57] times he would be he would hit her kick
[58:01] her do all kinds of different things um
[58:05] and it didn't matter if she punished him
[58:07] you she could she could whip him as much
[58:10] as she wanted to and he would still
[58:12] persist in doing these things it was to
[58:14] the point that she she told me that uh
[58:19] she was going to give him to an
[58:20] orphanage it was that it was that bad
[58:23] and the CH her other two children
[58:26] they were in agreement that he needed to
[58:28] go to an orphanage because he was just
[58:30] unable to be controlled and uh was not
[58:33] changing for any in any way for the
[58:36] better um and then so uh because I I
[58:40] work with children with autism and I was
[58:42] telling I was telling uh the pastor
[58:44] about this he told her and that she was
[58:49] going to take the boy and drop him off
[58:51] at the
[58:52] orphanage the very the Wednesday that I
[58:55] preached there opened up the meetings
[58:57] but he had told her that I was going to
[58:58] be there and so she came to talk to me
[59:01] instead of taking the boy to the
[59:04] orphanage and I spent some time talking
[59:06] with her after the service and she it it
[59:10] was really it was it was heartbreaking
[59:12] because she was
[59:13] so ashamed of her inability to to make a
[59:19] difference in this and she had uh she
[59:22] was ashamed at how she had treated the
[59:23] boy that wasn't like a mother should
[59:26] um she had been uh
[59:29] just she she we we spank her children I
[59:34] I believe in spanking but there's also
[59:35] you can go too far amen and uh she had
[59:39] she had gone too far several times and
[59:42] um she was just at her Wit's End I just
[59:45] she couldn't even look me in the eyes as
[59:47] she was talking to me she was so
[59:49] Afflicted and asham but I prayed with
[59:52] her that night and talked for for quite
[59:54] a while and gave her some real practical
[59:58] instruction and how to deal with a child
[1:00:01] like this and um two days two days later
[1:00:06] she spoke to me again and uh this
[1:00:10] something something was different this
[1:00:12] time she could look me in the eyes and
[1:00:14] she began to tell me that the little boy
[1:00:17] was had slept he had slept like 12 hours
[1:00:21] two days in a row and this was that's so
[1:00:24] if you have ever had known people with a
[1:00:27] child with
[1:00:27] ADHD that's incredible because they have
[1:00:30] like Boundless Energy they always have
[1:00:33] to be moving they cannot sit still um
[1:00:37] and for him to sleep like that and then
[1:00:40] she noticed that his personality was was
[1:00:43] changing and um she she told me it was
[1:00:48] so dramatic that that she was actually
[1:00:50] somebody accused her of putting the boy
[1:00:52] on drugs to to flatten him out amen it
[1:00:56] was that that dramatic of a
[1:00:59] shift I noticed then that that I had her
[1:01:03] WhatsApp and then she actually changed
[1:01:06] her WhatsApp picture to a picture of the
[1:01:09] little
[1:01:10] boy and that in itself was a testimony
[1:01:13] to go from a mother who who I don't want
[1:01:17] to say she hated the little boy but to
[1:01:19] the point she was to the point she was
[1:01:22] she would have been okay if he died it
[1:01:24] was that that severe
[1:01:27] and to go to that point the the god
[1:01:30] changed her heart back back to a
[1:01:33] mother's love for the baby to actually
[1:01:35] put him as her
[1:01:37] picture and then uh I've been in contact
[1:01:41] with her ever since we've gotten back
[1:01:43] and just kind of helping to coach her
[1:01:45] and to support her and let her know hey
[1:01:48] you're not a failure that these children
[1:01:51] you know God made them a special way you
[1:01:53] have to deal with them in a special way
[1:01:55] and uh and she sent me a a video clip a
[1:01:58] couple video clips uh the other day of
[1:02:02] him in the supermarket with her now
[1:02:03] before in a supermarket he would be
[1:02:05] screaming crying just just a a terror
[1:02:09] and in in the video clips she he's he's
[1:02:12] got her shopping basket he's pulling it
[1:02:15] for her and he's he was just a perfect
[1:02:18] little gentleman and um I it was just a
[1:02:22] complete change it just a complete
[1:02:24] miraculous change that I told her said I
[1:02:28] said God may not have taken the the
[1:02:32] these things away from him may he may
[1:02:35] always have some issues with these
[1:02:37] things autism or or
[1:02:40] ADHD but the process of healing has
[1:02:43] started and I'm just really praying that
[1:02:47] that God continues to work and
[1:02:49] move uh for that is a very very touching
[1:02:52] testimony for me uh to see that it to
[1:02:56] see it in action to go from I don't I
[1:02:59] don't really mind if this child dies I'm
[1:03:02] going to give him away
[1:03:04] to I love him oh and not just her but
[1:03:08] the attitude of her other two children
[1:03:10] changed towards little boy too and
[1:03:13] that's an act of God Amen uh next slide
[1:03:18] please uh so next year uh I already I've
[1:03:21] already committed to going back we're
[1:03:22] going to go into uh Nicaragua uh this
[1:03:26] pastor here brother cardinus I know
[1:03:28] brother Dale spoke for him uh so they've
[1:03:31] invited me uh and so if the Lord the
[1:03:34] Lord provides and we he's willing we're
[1:03:37] going to go back we're going to hit El
[1:03:39] Salvador Honduras and Nicaragua am um
[1:03:44] and so just be in prayer for that that
[1:03:46] God would amen uh lead us and that you
[1:03:50] know we don't want to ever step out of
[1:03:52] his will and you you you're always is
[1:03:56] Will going on a missions trip but uh to
[1:04:00] go where he wants us to
[1:04:02] go um Laura you wanted to say a couple
[1:04:06] things too I you just you might need to
[1:04:40] my experiences as a series of
[1:04:42] testimonies is
[1:04:53] this there we go so
[1:04:57] um you know when John said we wanted he
[1:05:00] wanted to go to Elsa where he wanted me
[1:05:01] to come with him you know I was like
[1:05:03] okay that's you know I'd like to do that
[1:05:04] i' like to meet people um but as maybe a
[1:05:09] lot of you know like I've been having
[1:05:10] issues with my back this year and I have
[1:05:12] a herniated disc in my back and slippage
[1:05:16] of the vertebrae so it's been kind of
[1:05:19] rough for me to stand for too long or
[1:05:21] sit for too long a lot of nerve pain and
[1:05:24] stuff like that in my legs
[1:05:26] and I'm actually going for surgery on
[1:05:28] Tuesday
[1:05:31] so leading up to this I had tried uh
[1:05:34] getting a couple of shots things like
[1:05:36] that my back to make it easier to
[1:05:38] travel but they didn't help that much
[1:05:42] and so
[1:05:43] like the Monday we were leaving on
[1:05:45] Friday right after our Thanksgiving in
[1:05:47] the the Estates and that Monday I had
[1:05:50] gone to the grocery store done some
[1:05:52] errands
[1:05:54] and I got in the car afterwards and I my
[1:05:57] legs hurt so bad I was in so much pain
[1:06:00] and I just started crying called John
[1:06:03] I'm like I don't I don't think I can go
[1:06:04] on this what good am I going to be if
[1:06:06] I'm like hurting and in pain and can
[1:06:09] hardly move around and walk you know how
[1:06:11] am I going to be a blessing I mean I'm
[1:06:13] like I'm like at I'm like hitting bottom
[1:06:15] I'm like I just I just can't you know
[1:06:17] and he he was like you know you know I'm
[1:06:19] going to pray for you hun and just come
[1:06:20] home we'll take care of everything you
[1:06:22] know and after I got off the phone with
[1:06:23] him I called my parents I was waiting
[1:06:24] for my groceries to pick them up and uh
[1:06:27] called my parents and they just like
[1:06:28] immediately went to prayer and I could
[1:06:30] just feel the presence of God comeing
[1:06:32] and calm me down and so I was like well
[1:06:36] Lord I'm just going to give it to you
[1:06:39] you know and you you're going to have to
[1:06:41] help me because we had been crazy busy I
[1:06:44] mean just just to be honest going into
[1:06:46] this like crazy busy that entire fall
[1:06:50] and I was just kind of on empty and um
[1:06:54] emotionally physically Mally and I
[1:06:56] thought how am I going to go give me a
[1:06:57] blessing to people and I'm like I'm I'm
[1:06:59] just like ready to crash and physically
[1:07:02] I'm having problems
[1:07:04] so I just kind of pushed it out of my
[1:07:06] mind committed it to the Lord the next
[1:07:08] few days I I did had good days you know
[1:07:11] and we went ahead and went
[1:07:13] and we got over there and God just I
[1:07:16] know that he just gave me the strength
[1:07:18] and energy and um we went brother
[1:07:21] Nelson's house first um and
[1:07:26] their family was just so welcoming and
[1:07:28] inviting and the kids they have seven
[1:07:31] kids and I mean I Vanessa Ander probably
[1:07:35] talked to you guys and Lan and Dell you
[1:07:38] probably already know but they're just
[1:07:39] you know amazing people you feel right
[1:07:42] at home even with the language barrier
[1:07:44] you know and um
[1:07:47] so I just started enjoying myself and
[1:07:50] I'm like I'm here to talk to the women
[1:07:53] and
[1:07:54] so it was easy to talk to the young kids
[1:07:57] the young girls because well a couple of
[1:07:59] them spoke some English and of course
[1:08:01] Victoria spoke really good English and
[1:08:04] so you know we hit it right off and then
[1:08:06] I would use her to like help me
[1:08:08] translate with um their mother and you
[1:08:11] know like I told everyone uh they were
[1:08:14] really good for my self-esteem because
[1:08:15] they all thought I was like late 20s
[1:08:17] early
[1:08:20] 30s so I'm like yeah okay new best
[1:08:23] friends right there but
[1:08:25] so the young people I mean they just
[1:08:28] pulled me right in um I spent a lot of
[1:08:31] time with them but then I made sure I
[1:08:32] was spending time with the sister's more
[1:08:35] my age and you know I was just talking
[1:08:37] with everyone and we went over to P's
[1:08:40] house so there was a couple of young
[1:08:41] people that really stood out to me that
[1:08:43] just really impacted my life and one of
[1:08:45] them was this young man here his name is
[1:08:47] Angel and um he goes to brother ralo's
[1:08:50] church and um we went over to his house
[1:08:54] and he was there
[1:08:56] and I kind of started like talking to
[1:08:59] him a little bit and all a sudden I
[1:09:00] could realize he spoke English and I'm
[1:09:01] like you speak English and they're all
[1:09:02] like really shy about the English they
[1:09:04] speak you know and I just kept
[1:09:06] encouraging them like you're doing great
[1:09:08] I mean it's amazing how much you can
[1:09:09] communicate even with just knowing a
[1:09:11] little bit of someone's language and so
[1:09:14] I kept encouraging him he was like okay
[1:09:15] this is good practice because he never
[1:09:17] has anybody to practice on so he um
[1:09:20] talked to me for a while told me his
[1:09:22] testimony and um so then after a little
[1:09:25] bit I wanted to talk to brother R's wife
[1:09:28] and there was no one you know the men
[1:09:30] are busy talking they don't want to
[1:09:32] translate so I asked Angel to help
[1:09:35] translate so I could talk to her he
[1:09:37] patiently sat there for a half an hour
[1:09:39] translating back and forth for the both
[1:09:40] of us so we could talk and connect and
[1:09:43] he told me was able to hear her
[1:09:46] testimony and talk with her and I just
[1:09:49] so just really blessed me and um that
[1:09:51] they would he would even take the time
[1:09:52] to you know most young men 22 years old
[1:09:54] they don't want to sit and listen to two
[1:09:56] women talk you know but he was happy to
[1:09:58] do it and so it really blessed me so you
[1:10:01] can go to the next
[1:10:04] one and this is Victoria she became very
[1:10:07] close and um she speaks good English and
[1:10:11] the girls were really close to her and
[1:10:13] one night we were able to stay up and
[1:10:15] just kind of talk a little deeper you
[1:10:18] know sometimes you just have that you
[1:10:19] know surface talk of getting to know
[1:10:21] people which is great but sometimes it's
[1:10:22] really nice to get a little deeper and
[1:10:25] talk and just communicate with one
[1:10:27] another maybe things you're going
[1:10:28] through and be a help to one another and
[1:10:31] that was just a real blessing to be able
[1:10:33] to do that one night with s us we're
[1:10:36] just sitting there talking and um just
[1:10:38] great memories we'll always remember
[1:10:40] those and um we can go to the next
[1:10:44] one I had gotten sick oh this is yeah
[1:10:48] this is a picture of all of us we were
[1:10:51] this was Sunday after church and
[1:10:53] everybody came over to brother Nelson's
[1:10:55] house they fed everybody which I don't
[1:10:56] know how many people there were had to
[1:10:58] be at least 50 it was a lot of people I
[1:11:01] meant to go around to every like table
[1:11:03] and take pictures and I didn't I didn't
[1:11:05] get a chance to do that but we got this
[1:11:07] picture with a lot of the sisters and
[1:11:08] the ones that have check marks are um
[1:11:11] brother Nelson's daughters and then the
[1:11:14] wife right down there with the heart and
[1:11:16] then the other sisters a lot of them are
[1:11:17] related um the one girl right beside me
[1:11:20] in the green her name is Ruth and she
[1:11:22] was just a sweetheart she came right up
[1:11:23] to me started talking perfectly good
[1:11:24] English I'm like somebody who speaks
[1:11:26] English and we just like it was like we
[1:11:28] were best friends and you know it wasn't
[1:11:30] like we just met and it was just it was
[1:11:32] just wonderful and um so on on
[1:11:37] Tuesday night we we were having a party
[1:11:40] for one of their daughters had a
[1:11:41] birthday and just suddenly I was just
[1:11:45] super sick with a head cold and like a
[1:11:48] sinus stuff and I couldn't even wear my
[1:11:50] contacts I wear my glasses I just felt
[1:11:53] terrible I'm like oh great this is we
[1:11:55] still got a long ways to go before the
[1:11:57] end of the trip and I didn't want to be
[1:11:59] sick I knew we had the other Church to
[1:12:01] go to and um I started feeling like I
[1:12:04] just didn't even want to talk to anybody
[1:12:06] I was like crashing so brother Nelson
[1:12:09] and his wife and all them they gave me
[1:12:11] so much medication and then you can go
[1:12:14] and get antibiotics there just by going
[1:12:16] to the pharmacy you don't have to go to
[1:12:18] the doctor so John went and got me
[1:12:19] antibiotics in case it was a sinus
[1:12:21] infection and they were just pumping me
[1:12:23] full of all kinds of medication and
[1:12:24] within two days usually it takes me
[1:12:26] about two weeks to get over a sinus
[1:12:28] infection within two days I
[1:12:30] was better enough to go to the next chur
[1:12:33] church and the next family so I know
[1:12:35] that was lore because it usually takes
[1:12:37] me way longer than that and I was able
[1:12:38] to stay at brother Nelson's house and
[1:12:40] just sleep and they just pampered me and
[1:12:44] um yeah it was it was it was wonderful
[1:12:47] treatment and I was able to get over
[1:12:48] that really fast so you go to the next
[1:12:53] one they took us to the beach
[1:12:55] and so we had a lot of fun even though
[1:12:57] it was dark and we couldn't see but uh a
[1:13:01] lot of fun that was like one of the
[1:13:02] things um that we got to do other than
[1:13:05] just the sermons and stuff like that and
[1:13:07] um just get to know each other kind of
[1:13:10] build some memories it was it was a lot
[1:13:12] of fun and they wanted to show us places
[1:13:15] like they just wanted to take us places
[1:13:17] they wanted to show us their their
[1:13:18] country and the things that they do for
[1:13:21] fun and so I keep going
[1:13:26] so after I felt better John was already
[1:13:28] over at the other
[1:13:30] convention and they wanted to take me
[1:13:33] somewhere and and they're like I'm like
[1:13:35] okay you know yeah I can go maybe
[1:13:36] somewhere for I was thinking like an
[1:13:38] hour they took me way up on MAR FAA
[1:13:42] Margarita mountain all the way to the
[1:13:44] almost to the top and took me to a
[1:13:46] restaurant up there treated me you know
[1:13:48] like I was royalty and just bought me
[1:13:51] dinner and showed me around and um it
[1:13:54] was wonderful evening together so that
[1:13:57] was a lot of fun and then you can keep
[1:14:01] going uh so then we went over to brother
[1:14:03] Edgars and um the first service that I
[1:14:08] was there after I was sick and got
[1:14:11] better um you know all the sisters had
[1:14:14] we kind of you kind of come out
[1:14:15] everybody kind of lines up and shakes
[1:14:16] hands and you know the sisters come out
[1:14:18] but I didn't know anybody who spoke
[1:14:21] spoke English there and I did have the
[1:14:22] Google translate but you had to have a
[1:14:23] really good connection for that to work
[1:14:26] really well and not have like a delay
[1:14:27] and and so yeah you can use it and we
[1:14:29] did use it sometimes and that was
[1:14:30] helpful but you know you don't want to
[1:14:33] just come up to someone and kind of
[1:14:34] stick a phone in their face and be like
[1:14:36] talking to this so I was trying to
[1:14:37] figure out how to talk to the sisters
[1:14:40] and you know and the brothers you know
[1:14:42] we had brother rafhael there there but
[1:14:44] he was helping John you know with the
[1:14:45] brothers and so I just was kind of
[1:14:48] standing there trying to figure out how
[1:14:49] to break the ice how to go up and talk
[1:14:51] to these sisters well this little boy
[1:14:52] kept going past me and finally he comes
[1:14:55] up sticks out his hands like God bless
[1:14:58] you in like perfect little little
[1:15:00] English and I was like oh you speak
[1:15:03] English and he got this big grin on his
[1:15:05] face and so then he walks off and then
[1:15:08] um I finally went over to some people I
[1:15:10] didn't know from Brother Nelson's church
[1:15:12] I was kind of you know talking to them
[1:15:14] kind of brokenly but I sat down on a
[1:15:16] little bench and he kept going back and
[1:15:18] forth finally I just kind of patted my
[1:15:20] bench you know and told him to come over
[1:15:22] so he comes over so I Ed Google
[1:15:24] Translate asking him questions he kept
[1:15:26] trying to respond in English like the a
[1:15:28] little bit of English he knew and um so
[1:15:32] we just kind of struck up a little
[1:15:33] friendship right so then he runs off and
[1:15:35] I think okay he's just going to go play
[1:15:37] with his friends well instead he goes
[1:15:39] and grabs his mother and drags her over
[1:15:41] to me and you know wants us to talk he's
[1:15:46] like and so I thought it was so sweet
[1:15:49] like you know the little child will lead
[1:15:50] them you know and so I you know through
[1:15:53] the Google translate I think brother
[1:15:55] rafhael had come over at that point and
[1:15:56] so I was able to like meet his mother
[1:15:58] and meet his family and it just kind of
[1:16:00] broke the ice and after that anytime he
[1:16:03] saw me he came running you know and put
[1:16:05] his arms around me and um we bought him
[1:16:08] a little gift and uh the pastor had
[1:16:10] given it to him after we left and his
[1:16:11] mom contacted me on Facebook and I got a
[1:16:14] little recording where he says it in a
[1:16:16] little English you know thank you for
[1:16:17] the gift sister
[1:16:19] laa and now it's just precious so all
[1:16:22] right go on to next one
[1:16:25] amen and this is Martha I finally found
[1:16:28] someone who talked a little bit of
[1:16:30] English and it was um a 19-year-old girl
[1:16:33] and she kind of real shy came up to me
[1:16:36] asked me if she could get a picture with
[1:16:37] me
[1:16:38] and um I'm like well you speak English
[1:16:41] and she's like oh I'm not very good you
[1:16:42] know and I'm like you know well you're
[1:16:44] you know their pronunciation actually is
[1:16:45] pretty good whatever they do know you
[1:16:48] can actually understand them and so I'm
[1:16:51] like well you know you're doing pretty
[1:16:52] good so she started talking more to me
[1:16:55] and um in just the little bit that she
[1:16:58] knew we could Converse and then like
[1:17:00] what we didn't know we'd use the Google
[1:17:02] translate and she had told me that she
[1:17:04] wanted to go to the college to learn
[1:17:06] English and be an English teacher and so
[1:17:10] we just stuck a r up a really good
[1:17:11] friendship and she told me her testimony
[1:17:15] where um I think I B about a year or two
[1:17:18] ago she um got very sick they found a
[1:17:21] dormant virus in her blood from
[1:17:24] childhood
[1:17:25] and it came active and it almost killed
[1:17:29] her took her sight and then God had in
[1:17:32] the you know through the doctors had
[1:17:33] really helped her she had gained back um
[1:17:35] 80% of her sight and she just had a
[1:17:38] really amazing testimony and just an
[1:17:41] amazing sweet spirit and love for the
[1:17:42] Lord and so we've been in contact even
[1:17:44] you know since um we've left and she's
[1:17:48] just a really sweet girl so I was just
[1:17:50] able to connect with so many of them and
[1:17:52] it just was it just really blessed my
[1:17:54] heart I went to be a blessing came back
[1:17:56] obviously very blessed so um I think
[1:17:59] there's maybe a couple more so this is
[1:18:03] uh brother Raphael and his mom and dad
[1:18:05] and they just became very dear to to us
[1:18:08] also just super sweet people I mean you
[1:18:10] couldn't find sweeter people if you
[1:18:12] tried and um it was hard it was actually
[1:18:15] hard to leave it was like you know I was
[1:18:17] ready to go home and see my kids but yet
[1:18:19] I wanted to bring them all with me but
[1:18:21] they would have froze to death so
[1:18:25] but you can keep going it's it's it's so
[1:18:28] interesting how like you know just that
[1:18:31] that connection of you know loving the
[1:18:33] Lord and then being able to just connect
[1:18:35] in your spirits together you have a
[1:18:37] common a common foundation and you can
[1:18:40] just go off from there and um and within
[1:18:43] minutes just feel so close to each other
[1:18:47] so you can go on to the next
[1:18:50] one that was brother Nelson and sister
[1:18:53] Sonia and she just treated me like I was
[1:18:56] her little sister and it was just like
[1:18:59] John said they fed us and they fed us
[1:19:00] and then they fed us some more and um
[1:19:03] yeah the girls and I Vanessa and I were
[1:19:05] like okay enough we're going to
[1:19:08] pop and we had more papoa than we've
[1:19:11] ever had in our life I think we had it
[1:19:13] five times in the eight days we were
[1:19:15] there they definitely uh wanted us to
[1:19:17] like their national
[1:19:19] food but it was all very good like I was
[1:19:22] willing to try pretty much anything and
[1:19:24] so they were like okay they gave me all
[1:19:25] kinds of things to try and everything
[1:19:28] was pretty good there was only a few
[1:19:29] things that I didn't particularly care
[1:19:31] for this is the volcano um we were going
[1:19:34] to the beach one the brothers knew I
[1:19:35] wanted to get a picture of the volcano
[1:19:37] so he purposely stopped on a certain
[1:19:39] spot and let me get a really good
[1:19:41] picture of it and so let's see I think
[1:19:46] oh this sweet lady here her name is um
[1:19:50] well we would say Vilma but in their
[1:19:53] then their language would be Wilma
[1:19:55] so um she was just like one of those you
[1:19:59] just I told her I said I can tell you
[1:20:01] are a seasoned veteran of Christ you
[1:20:03] know just a seasoned woman and um she
[1:20:07] just was praising the Lord during the
[1:20:09] service and she this is another one I
[1:20:11] wanted to like bring
[1:20:13] home but um she thought she wanted to
[1:20:16] talk to me so bad and she was like so
[1:20:18] annoyed with like trying to use the
[1:20:19] translator so she just kept talking me
[1:20:21] in Spanish like I was going to suddenly
[1:20:23] know what she was saying but but you
[1:20:26] know it was just Kindred Spirits for
[1:20:28] sure so next one that was us getting
[1:20:32] ready to leave um we didn't want to part
[1:20:35] ways with brother Raphael and it was
[1:20:38] just hard but we will be
[1:20:41] back I think that's probably it yeah so
[1:20:45] yep had a wonderful time and God just
[1:20:47] really moved in the services I can
[1:20:50] testify that what John said is you know
[1:20:52] true on the testimonies and
[1:21:05] so didn't really say it because I think
[1:21:08] maybe she maybe it's just didn't think
[1:21:10] about how important it is maybe just a
[1:21:13] little bit embarrassed to say it but she
[1:21:15] actually was able to answer questions
[1:21:18] for a lot of those sisters that they
[1:21:20] asked you know like if I when I was
[1:21:21] speaking on something preaching and um
[1:21:25] you know they would they would talk
[1:21:26] about those topics too and um you know
[1:21:30] being able to give her perspective
[1:21:32] especially when I dealt with some topics
[1:21:34] like on marriage and things like that so
[1:21:36] I was very grateful for for her to come
[1:21:40] and it is
[1:21:43] 11:23 and brother Dell said I could he
[1:21:46] said I could preach as long as I
[1:21:50] want uh so if you would stand with me
[1:21:53] and I I promise that I'll try to go
[1:21:55] quick but let's just uh let's just kind
[1:21:57] of change the order of the service to
[1:21:58] look at the
[1:21:59] word and uh turn with me if you will to
[1:22:03] the to the Book of
[1:22:06] Joel and uh uh Joel chapter
[1:22:10] 2 just going to read a couple scriptures
[1:22:13] here if I was to title this uh this
[1:22:16] morning I'd like to title it unashamed
[1:22:19] of
[1:22:21] overcoming
[1:22:22] uh chapter 2 2 and verse 23-
[1:22:28] 27 be glad then ye children of Zion and
[1:22:32] rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath
[1:22:34] given you the former rain moderately and
[1:22:37] he will cause to come down for you the
[1:22:39] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[1:22:42] in the first month and the floor shall
[1:22:45] be full of Wheat and the fats shall
[1:22:47] overflow with wine and oil and I will
[1:22:50] restore to you the years that the Locust
[1:22:52] has eaten the cankerworm and and the
[1:22:54] caterpillar and the Palmer room my great
[1:22:57] Army which I sent among you and ye shall
[1:23:00] eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[1:23:02] praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:23:04] that has dealt wondrously with you and
[1:23:07] my people shall never be ashamed and you
[1:23:10] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:23:12] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:23:15] and none else and my people shall never
[1:23:17] be ashamed let's just bow our heads in
[1:23:21] prayer as we uh open the word Lord God
[1:23:25] thank you for this opportunity to to be
[1:23:28] here with your people father I just pray
[1:23:31] that you take the simple thought that
[1:23:32] that you've given me may it be expressed
[1:23:34] may your people be blessed in all things
[1:23:37] we give you
[1:23:41] praise in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[1:23:44] amen amen bless
[1:23:50] Jesus I'd like you to notice here that
[1:23:53] you we we are all very very familiar
[1:23:55] with this scripture but the the
[1:23:56] situation here is one of blessing and
[1:24:00] that uh when the prophet is is taking
[1:24:03] the words of God here and he's saying
[1:24:05] you are going to be in a state of of of
[1:24:07] of blessing you're going to have the the
[1:24:09] former rain you're going to have the
[1:24:11] latter rain you're going to eat in
[1:24:13] plenty you're going to be satisfied
[1:24:15] you're going to be praising the Lord
[1:24:17] your God you're not going to be ashamed
[1:24:19] of anything that he's given you right uh
[1:24:23] and and that everyone is going to know
[1:24:25] that he's your God and that he is with
[1:24:29] you and it it's particular and I I
[1:24:32] started wondering about this why why did
[1:24:34] he feel the need to say you're not going
[1:24:36] to be
[1:24:37] ashamed why why why would he put that in
[1:24:40] there and as I was meditating on the
[1:24:42] Lord started giving me some thoughts and
[1:24:45] there's a couple different ways that we
[1:24:46] could take it but I'd like to turn now
[1:24:49] to the uh to the book of second Timothy
[1:24:52] and uh I'm going to read
[1:24:55] 1: 8-2 as Paul uh is is giving some
[1:25:00] instruction here and he says be be not
[1:25:03] thou therefore ashamed of the testimony
[1:25:05] of the Lord nor of me his
[1:25:09] prisoner
[1:25:10] uh and I and I I was reading about that
[1:25:13] reading that and I thought you know how
[1:25:16] many people that are Christians are
[1:25:19] ashamed of the testimony of being a
[1:25:22] Christian and they want to be secret
[1:25:24] Christians and they want to hide it and
[1:25:26] how many people walk around in the
[1:25:28] message that are ashamed to say they
[1:25:30] follow the message of of a prophet named
[1:25:32] William
[1:25:33] brandom and it's almost like one of the
[1:25:35] last things that we'll tell somebody
[1:25:37] about ourselves is is oh yes we follow a
[1:25:39] message brought by a prophet in this
[1:25:42] last day and it's and I think a lot of
[1:25:44] it has to do with with a little bit of
[1:25:48] shame that that that it's not common
[1:25:51] it's not uh something that everybody
[1:25:53] says all the time it's unusual it's
[1:25:56] weird it's strange and we're we can be a
[1:25:59] little bit ashamed to to say it and
[1:26:01] we're not ashamed on the inside of of
[1:26:04] what we believe but a lot of times I
[1:26:06] think we become a little bit ashamed to
[1:26:08] tell people and just to offer it freely
[1:26:11] and willingly and like we just want to
[1:26:13] kind of hold that little piece back of
[1:26:15] our of ourselves and what we believe
[1:26:17] instead of just giving freely of that
[1:26:19] which we receive and Paul Paul's talking
[1:26:22] here he says but he said don't be
[1:26:24] ashamed of me as prisoner but be a
[1:26:26] partaker of the afflictions of the
[1:26:28] gospel because when you when you are not
[1:26:32] ashamed and you tell people you're going
[1:26:34] to be afflicted right uh not everybody's
[1:26:36] going to be be very receptive that you
[1:26:39] follow a
[1:26:40] prophet and he he goes on here and he
[1:26:42] says who has saved us and called us with
[1:26:44] a holy calling not according to our
[1:26:46] works but according to his own purpose
[1:26:48] and Grace which was given us in Christ
[1:26:51] Jesus before the world began but is now
[1:26:54] made manifest by the appearing of Our
[1:26:56] Savior Jesus Christ who has abolished
[1:26:58] death and has brought life and
[1:26:59] immortality to light through the gospel
[1:27:02] wherefore I am appointed a preacher and
[1:27:04] an apostle and a teacher and all of us
[1:27:07] are appointed to a position all of us
[1:27:10] have been appointed to a placing as a
[1:27:13] when we become adopted Sons and
[1:27:15] Daughters of God God has placed us
[1:27:17] positionally within the bride within his
[1:27:21] church uh and so we we are the same as
[1:27:24] Paul in that regard and he said for for
[1:27:28] which cause I suffer things nevertheless
[1:27:31] I am not
[1:27:33] ashamed I'm not ashamed of of the things
[1:27:36] that I suffered why because I know whom
[1:27:39] I have believed in I know who he is I
[1:27:43] know him intimately uh Paul didn't have
[1:27:46] the testimony that he walked with Jesus
[1:27:48] Christ for three and a half years of
[1:27:50] ministry he didn't have the testimony of
[1:27:52] the Apostles but he knew
[1:27:54] Jesus Christ he knew the word for his
[1:27:57] day and he's persuaded that he is able
[1:28:01] to keep that which I have committed unto
[1:28:04] him what did Paul commit to him his very
[1:28:07] life his his being his purpose for
[1:28:10] existence Paul could take it all and
[1:28:12] hand it and put it squarely in the hands
[1:28:15] of God and not have to worry about
[1:28:17] anything it's like it belongs to him
[1:28:20] anyway I I he's going to keep it as he's
[1:28:23] going to keep my Ministry going he's
[1:28:25] going to keep my life living as long as
[1:28:27] he wants
[1:28:29] to amen and I think a lot of times we we
[1:28:33] become we become just a little bit too
[1:28:35] ashamed of who we
[1:28:38] are in the in the in the aspect of
[1:28:40] wanting to tell people about it and
[1:28:43] we're we can get a little bit
[1:28:44] intimidated by the culture and we be we
[1:28:47] can become a little bit intimidated by
[1:28:49] by the the threats of of what this
[1:28:53] culture presents to where if we talk
[1:28:54] about there only being two genders 50%
[1:28:57] of the population looks at you like
[1:28:59] you're a you're most hateful despicable
[1:29:02] person in the
[1:29:04] world and so you don't want to have a
[1:29:06] conversation about those things and you
[1:29:09] avoid that and you avoid avoid
[1:29:11] professing your faith but when you've
[1:29:14] met God and you know who he is and you
[1:29:18] know who you are you won't be ashamed
[1:29:23] now joh brother John not saying you
[1:29:24] haven't met God I'm not saying that but
[1:29:28] what I am saying is that we need to be a
[1:29:31] little bit more bold as Christians to
[1:29:34] testify of what God has done for us we
[1:29:36] need to be a little bit less ashamed to
[1:29:39] be known as Believers in an end time
[1:29:42] message right and we we can stand strong
[1:29:45] in our convictions and a lot of times
[1:29:46] and I see this with with younger people
[1:29:48] especially they they get wishy-washy in
[1:29:51] their convictions and they they can be
[1:29:53] raised in a church and they get to a
[1:29:55] certain point where they get too
[1:29:57] involved with the culture that surrounds
[1:29:59] us and the next thing you know they're
[1:30:01] they're asking questions and they're
[1:30:03] questioning all the things that they
[1:30:04] thought that they believed and they
[1:30:06] thought that they knew and and when that
[1:30:08] happens the devil is right there he
[1:30:10] knows exactly what to whisper in their
[1:30:12] ear he knows exactly what what traps to
[1:30:15] lay before them he knows exactly what to
[1:30:19] seduce them with to pull them away from
[1:30:22] what they've believed and the next thing
[1:30:24] you know a young person finds themselves
[1:30:27] in places they never would have thought
[1:30:29] they would have gone to they never would
[1:30:30] have imagined that they they could fall
[1:30:33] into to these kinds of sins and traps
[1:30:36] and then they know it's a trap and they
[1:30:38] know that they're they're doing the
[1:30:40] wrong thing but then they're too ashamed
[1:30:43] to come back to what what they
[1:30:47] knew amen I I have a lot of quotes to
[1:30:51] read but I think I'll I'll I'll read
[1:30:53] these quickly and not try to make too
[1:30:55] many content uh uh comments on them
[1:30:58] brother brandom in in says when God made
[1:31:01] the promise of the baptism of the holy
[1:31:04] of the Holy Ghost and you receive it
[1:31:05] there is something that settles within
[1:31:07] you that there's nothing that can take
[1:31:10] its place and how many how many can
[1:31:11] testify that that when you receive the
[1:31:13] Holy Ghost something changed in your
[1:31:15] life I know that when I receive the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost something changed in my life I
[1:31:19] wasn't the same person that I was before
[1:31:21] I didn't have the same uh appetite that
[1:31:24] I had before for the things of the world
[1:31:26] the things of the world didn't have a
[1:31:27] pole on me anymore I still had to fight
[1:31:30] my flesh yes and I still do today but
[1:31:32] the the pull of the world disappeared I
[1:31:35] no longer cared so much about all those
[1:31:38] things that I thought was important
[1:31:39] before John Garrett changed I was a new
[1:31:43] creation a new create uh I I was
[1:31:47] different he said when a man ever meets
[1:31:49] God not in some emotional workup some
[1:31:52] enthusiasm or some religious Dogma uh or
[1:31:55] religious Doctrine some catechism or
[1:31:58] Creed or Dogma that he's
[1:32:00] accepted and he says this he says what
[1:32:02] why does he accept it because it's
[1:32:04] comforting to them and I think a lot of
[1:32:07] times we have a lot of people who sit in
[1:32:08] a message church that that accept what's
[1:32:11] being said and they find those words
[1:32:13] comforting because who doesn't want to
[1:32:15] be told that they're they're part of the
[1:32:16] elect who doesn't want to be told that
[1:32:19] you're going to be in the Rapture you're
[1:32:20] not going to go through tribulation that
[1:32:22] you you've got it you're fine you're
[1:32:24] part of the Bride amen and people love
[1:32:26] that and they want to hear it and they
[1:32:29] accept it mentally in an emotional work
[1:32:32] up or with enthusiasm but they don't
[1:32:34] accept it in their heart of
[1:32:38] hearts brother brand says they take it
[1:32:40] as a comfort but when it really comes to
[1:32:42] the place like Moses did on the back
[1:32:45] side of the desert and you walk up face
[1:32:47] to face with almighty God and you see
[1:32:50] the voice speaking to you exactly with
[1:32:52] the word and the pro promise of the hour
[1:32:54] there is something it does to
[1:32:57] you and he says see you're not going to
[1:33:00] be ashamed of it it's done something to
[1:33:02] you and that's that's the testimony of
[1:33:05] the believer is that when we have heard
[1:33:07] something that had uh like Moses that
[1:33:10] caught our attention a a fire burning in
[1:33:12] a bush and the bush not burning it
[1:33:14] caught our attention and we came away we
[1:33:16] separated ourselves and we went to it
[1:33:18] and we spoke to it and it spoke to us
[1:33:21] and it changed us forever
[1:33:25] how can we be ashamed of what God's done
[1:33:29] this is this is what he's G he's given
[1:33:31] us this message in the our faith and it
[1:33:34] becomes a token to us this blood that we
[1:33:36] believe in the blood that we claim
[1:33:38] brother random says he expects us to
[1:33:41] display the token over our faith to
[1:33:44] display it to who though who who do we
[1:33:46] most most of the time we display the
[1:33:48] token to and I'm I'm ashamed to say it
[1:33:50] is most of the time we display the token
[1:33:52] to other believers and we we're not
[1:33:54] we're not ashamed that other believers
[1:33:56] know that we have the token on display
[1:33:59] and we we walk we way way too many of us
[1:34:02] have a church life and a church walk
[1:34:04] where we put on a a a lot of show when
[1:34:07] we come to church and we come in and we
[1:34:09] we're dressed the right way and we sit
[1:34:11] down and we mind our p's and q's and we
[1:34:13] say God bless you and amen and
[1:34:15] everything but when we're Out Among the
[1:34:17] world and too many times out on the job
[1:34:21] and we're dealing with other people we
[1:34:23] don't really display that token like we
[1:34:25] ought to we don't really we don't
[1:34:28] sometimes we laugh at jokes that we
[1:34:29] shouldn't laugh at and I tell you what
[1:34:32] you people people catch on to that and
[1:34:34] they it'll ruin your testimony it'll
[1:34:37] it'll absolutely ruin it because they'll
[1:34:39] they'll say oh well brother John says
[1:34:41] he's a Christian but but you know the
[1:34:43] other day we were joking and and you
[1:34:45] know we we laughed about some pretty you
[1:34:48] know unsavory stuff and and he laughed
[1:34:50] right along with it you know so he's not
[1:34:52] a real Christian
[1:34:54] amen we don't want to ruin our
[1:34:57] testimony brother random says uh uh uh
[1:35:02] this is he says that is the badge the
[1:35:05] token of identification because it's
[1:35:07] Christ's own life in you identifying the
[1:35:10] word and it doesn't need anything
[1:35:13] else and when you have that life in you
[1:35:17] you don't need anything else you don't
[1:35:20] need the acceptance of other people you
[1:35:22] don't need the to worry about whether
[1:35:24] somebody likes you or dislikes you or
[1:35:27] they love you or hate you because your
[1:35:29] focus is then on Jesus Christ and being
[1:35:32] accepted in
[1:35:35] him that God that same power that raised
[1:35:38] up Jesus from the G grave you are
[1:35:40] holding within yourself as a token the
[1:35:42] Holy Ghost in you is the token that
[1:35:45] brings you from the grave because the
[1:35:47] token is God the Holy Spirit which is
[1:35:50] eternal life and that's the only only
[1:35:53] thing that pays the price he goes on in
[1:35:57] another time he's talking about the
[1:35:58] token he says uh he says I want you to
[1:36:00] notice what the order of this is the
[1:36:01] order of the Passover and he talks it
[1:36:03] says he gives a little bit of a
[1:36:05] background that it has to be a male
[1:36:07] sheep that that it must be tested for 14
[1:36:09] days and he says what a perfect type it
[1:36:12] is of Christ the antitype a male a lamb
[1:36:15] and he was tested for three and A2 years
[1:36:17] of his ministry through critics and
[1:36:19] everything the clergy of that day but
[1:36:22] was proved to hold fast to the father's
[1:36:25] word now we've been keeping up the lamb
[1:36:29] this message right for 60 70
[1:36:33] years it's been being watched by by
[1:36:36] people longer than I've been alive and
[1:36:40] and some of you that are that are older
[1:36:42] than me you've been in this message for
[1:36:44] some some of you I don't want to call
[1:36:46] you old but you've been in it for quite
[1:36:49] a while and you've seen people come
[1:36:52] you've seen people go you've seen the
[1:36:54] Winds of Doctrine blow this way blow
[1:36:57] that way and you've but but the point
[1:36:59] that you've held on to is what has been
[1:37:02] revealed to me is true otherwise you
[1:37:05] wouldn't be here you would have just
[1:37:07] left when you seen seen the craziness
[1:37:10] that surrounds any type of religious
[1:37:11] movement and the in the fanaticism but
[1:37:14] something in this has proven itself to
[1:37:16] you and you've latched on to it and
[1:37:18] that's why you're still
[1:37:20] here amen and he goes on he says
[1:37:24] uh has withstood all that the critics
[1:37:27] and the clergy and and was proven even
[1:37:31] in the presence of Satan talking about
[1:37:33] Jesus he said it is written it is
[1:37:35] written and constantly he defeated the
[1:37:37] enemy on the word and he says it's a
[1:37:40] perfect example for us today always
[1:37:43] defeat the enemy with the word of God
[1:37:45] that's written for the day and I I just
[1:37:48] have to believe that there's a bride of
[1:37:50] Jesus Christ that there is a people a
[1:37:53] church church that is going to overcome
[1:37:55] every obstacle that the devil would lay
[1:37:57] down that every every every thing that
[1:37:59] the devil would place before you to try
[1:38:01] to pull you out of the way that the the
[1:38:04] influences that he would have that there
[1:38:06] that there is a people that is going to
[1:38:08] overcome those and we're going to have a
[1:38:10] battle and we're going to have a fight
[1:38:11] but there God is giving us an overcoming
[1:38:14] power that only is in this body that has
[1:38:18] the true life of Jesus Christ the true
[1:38:21] token now there's a lot of people who
[1:38:23] profess to be Believers there's a lot of
[1:38:25] people who profess to be Christians and
[1:38:27] they can be some good people moral high
[1:38:29] standards but they don't have this life
[1:38:33] they do not have it and they and they
[1:38:36] prove it in in a thousand ways and and
[1:38:39] then this the funny thing is is that
[1:38:41] that we we we who do have it and you
[1:38:43] know you have the Holy Ghost you've been
[1:38:45] changed and then when you fall short of
[1:38:48] what you what you would want to be then
[1:38:51] you start to wonder if you have it and
[1:38:52] if you're ever going to make it why do
[1:38:54] you think when I come here so when I
[1:38:56] preach I I always try to tell tell you
[1:38:59] in every sermon that that you are now
[1:39:02] the Sons and Daughters of God and it
[1:39:04] doesn't even appear what you're going to
[1:39:05] be it is impossible for you to sin it's
[1:39:08] impossible for you to be lost when you
[1:39:11] receive the Holy Ghost on your soul you
[1:39:15] are sealed until the day of your
[1:39:17] Redemption now that's not once saved
[1:39:19] always saved no no ST that's not that
[1:39:22] that's not that belief cuz you can have
[1:39:23] the Holy Ghost fall on your flesh realm
[1:39:26] and on your spirit realm but when it is
[1:39:28] in your soul and you have a changed
[1:39:31] nature you are sealed and you cannot be
[1:39:35] unsealed period no ifs ANS or buts no
[1:39:39] what ifs it's impossible for you at that
[1:39:42] point because you are a new creation in
[1:39:44] Christ Jesus thank you
[1:39:46] Lord why would we be ashamed about it
[1:39:49] brother random says he says you can't be
[1:39:51] a secret boy about it no you've got to
[1:39:54] have it and you've got to have it on
[1:39:55] display that was the purpose of putting
[1:39:57] it on the doors so that he could see it
[1:39:59] on the lentil and on the doorpost is
[1:40:02] something you're not ashamed of you want
[1:40:03] the whole world to know that you're that
[1:40:06] you are dead and your life is hid in God
[1:40:09] through
[1:40:10] Christ it has to be on display it can't
[1:40:14] be on display at church and then not at
[1:40:17] home where you where where a husband
[1:40:20] comes into the church and he's he's
[1:40:22] praying and worshiping God and he looks
[1:40:24] like a model Christian but then when he
[1:40:25] goes home he mistreats his wife and his
[1:40:28] children it can't it can't be you know
[1:40:31] the sister that comes to church and she
[1:40:33] she cooks or cleans and provides meals
[1:40:36] and does all the right things but then
[1:40:37] when she goes to the grocery store she's
[1:40:39] looking at all the dirty filthy
[1:40:41] magazines while she's waiting to check
[1:40:43] out it has to be on display for everyone
[1:40:46] to
[1:40:48] see the blood was a token and
[1:40:51] identification the blood ID ify that the
[1:40:54] worshipper had slain the lamb and had
[1:40:56] accepted the lamb and applied the token
[1:40:59] to himself that he was not ashamed and
[1:41:02] so so many times people want they want a
[1:41:05] slain
[1:41:06] lamb but they don't want to accept the
[1:41:09] lamb they only want just a little piece
[1:41:11] the feel-good pieces that you're the
[1:41:14] bride and you're you're you're you
[1:41:16] you're Overcomer and they want to be
[1:41:18] told all these wonderful blessings that
[1:41:20] God has in store but they don't want to
[1:41:22] accept the
[1:41:23] difficulty that is associated with this
[1:41:26] message and with the and not just with
[1:41:28] this message but with the cause of Jesus
[1:41:30] Christ that Paul said I'm going to
[1:41:32] suffer Affliction right you will suffer
[1:41:35] Affliction when you believe this and you
[1:41:37] have it on display people are going to
[1:41:38] mistreat you they are going to identify
[1:41:41] you as belonging to a cult they're going
[1:41:42] to identify you as being abnormal
[1:41:45] unusual that you're weird that you that
[1:41:47] there's something wrong with you that
[1:41:49] you're crazy and you have to be willing
[1:41:51] to accept that condemnation
[1:41:53] you have to be willing to be counted
[1:41:55] that
[1:41:57] way that's right so he didn't care who
[1:42:01] saw let me go back and reread this the
[1:42:03] blood identified that the worshipper had
[1:42:04] slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and
[1:42:07] applied the token to himself that he was
[1:42:09] not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he
[1:42:12] wanted everybody to see it and it was
[1:42:15] placed in such a position that everybody
[1:42:18] passing by could see the token and
[1:42:20] that's the way it has to be in our life
[1:42:21] that it has to be on dis way that
[1:42:23] everybody can see it we can't just show
[1:42:25] it to just one person or two person our
[1:42:28] family or this we got to show it on the
[1:42:29] job we've got to show it when we're in
[1:42:31] the grocery store when we're out
[1:42:32] shopping that the the people that we
[1:42:34] walk with and walk among can see that
[1:42:37] there's something unusual and different
[1:42:39] about you and that you're okay with it
[1:42:41] that you're happy that there's something
[1:42:43] different about you today my goodness
[1:42:45] why would we want to be like the people
[1:42:47] of the world who are so miserable that
[1:42:50] are that are so so so just completely
[1:42:53] abject wretched that they they go out
[1:42:56] and they they have to do their their
[1:42:58] minds are so gone that they go out and
[1:42:59] they do drugs so that they can have a
[1:43:01] happy time they go out to the bars and
[1:43:03] they get drunk so they can feel good and
[1:43:06] you know is they're so miserable they
[1:43:09] have nothing keeping them that that's
[1:43:11] just a you know how they're a happy
[1:43:14] person is so rare is so rare and like I
[1:43:17] could go into statistics and tell you
[1:43:19] how many how prevalent depression and
[1:43:21] anxiety is within in the population it
[1:43:24] ain't like 10% or 20% it's like
[1:43:28] 80% that deal with these
[1:43:31] things brother Brandon wasn't wrong when
[1:43:34] he said we live in a neurotic age why
[1:43:37] why would I want to walk around and act
[1:43:38] like them I I don't want nothing like
[1:43:41] that I'm happy that God's changed me I'm
[1:43:44] happy to be a Christian I God God pulled
[1:43:47] me out of the mess so that I could if
[1:43:50] anything I'm his mess now
[1:43:53] amen thank you
[1:43:55] Lord so they don't it was placed in uh
[1:43:59] such a position that everybody passing
[1:44:01] by can see the token see many people
[1:44:03] wants to be Christians and they and they
[1:44:04] like to do it secretly so nobody would
[1:44:07] know that they're Christians or the
[1:44:09] associates that they run around with
[1:44:11] some of them would think well look now I
[1:44:13] know he he want I want to be a Christian
[1:44:15] but I don't want so and so to know about
[1:44:17] it well see that's not Christianity and
[1:44:20] it certainly isn't the
[1:44:22] messag Christianity has to display its
[1:44:24] token see publicly in public life at the
[1:44:28] office on the street when trouble is
[1:44:31] around anything in church everywhere
[1:44:34] else the blood is the token and the
[1:44:37] token must be applied now listen into
[1:44:39] this real
[1:44:40] closely or see if it's
[1:44:43] not the Covenant is not in
[1:44:48] effect the Covenant isn't in effect
[1:44:50] you're not safe from anything it has to
[1:44:53] be
[1:44:55] applied who applies it you
[1:44:57] do we apply it God doesn't come and
[1:45:00] apply the blood for us over our our
[1:45:02] household and over our lives to identify
[1:45:05] us we have to take the the the Lamb's
[1:45:08] blood and apply
[1:45:11] it amen we have to we have to be
[1:45:18] Overcomers overcome ourselves
[1:45:23] uh brother Ram talking here he says uh
[1:45:25] this is a little bit more lengthy look
[1:45:27] at Samson see God can only use what you
[1:45:29] surrender to him Samson was a big strong
[1:45:31] man he had a lot of strength and Samson
[1:45:33] surrendered his strength to God but
[1:45:35] wouldn't give his heart he gave his
[1:45:37] heart to Delila see and that's the way
[1:45:39] with people today Oh They'll they'll
[1:45:41] reach down and they'll pay off some of
[1:45:42] the church debts or they'll contribute
[1:45:44] to the church and they'll they'll put an
[1:45:46] offering in and build a bigger building
[1:45:49] a bigger denomination and so forth but
[1:45:50] when it comes to giving their heart they
[1:45:53] won't do it
[1:45:56] right we see a lot of that that's we're
[1:45:59] not immune to that in message churches
[1:46:01] where people will come they'll sit on a
[1:46:03] Pew and then they'll they'll give a
[1:46:05] little bit but they don't give their
[1:46:07] lives and they don't they don't they the
[1:46:10] that that they don't interact with
[1:46:13] people you know they come to church sing
[1:46:14] the song hear the sermon walk right back
[1:46:16] out the door and go live their
[1:46:21] life Peter had a sword he pulled that
[1:46:23] sword and was going to and cut the high
[1:46:25] priest's ears off and he did that but
[1:46:27] when it came to real Christian Courage
[1:46:29] he didn't have it he backed down backed
[1:46:32] up and he denied him is that right he C
[1:46:34] he could cut off the priest's ear with a
[1:46:36] sword sure he knowed how to handle the
[1:46:38] sword but when it came to squeeze time
[1:46:40] to stand on the word of God he didn't
[1:46:42] have the courage and he even denied
[1:46:45] knowing Jesus and that's where it is
[1:46:47] today we've got courage to build
[1:46:48] buildings and put millions of dollars in
[1:46:51] them we've got courage to to put uh pipe
[1:46:54] organs and plush seats and everything
[1:46:56] and to go out and protite from place to
[1:46:58] P place oh my
[1:47:00] goodness is this is this a message
[1:47:03] Church wow is this the state of of so
[1:47:06] many message churches
[1:47:08] today we got we got the we got the funds
[1:47:11] we're going to build a bigger church
[1:47:13] it's going to be nice we're going to
[1:47:14] have the best sound equipment we're
[1:47:16] going to have the best broadcast system
[1:47:18] so we can pratite from church to church
[1:47:22] wow
[1:47:30] but when it comes to Christian Courage
[1:47:32] to accept the word the message of God
[1:47:35] and stand there on it brother Ram says
[1:47:38] this we are
[1:47:41] few we are
[1:47:44] few l so what good is your stones
[1:47:47] without a stonemason God's looking for
[1:47:49] character not membership character now I
[1:47:52] tell you even here today in this church
[1:47:55] and I and we're this is one of the most
[1:47:57] beautiful churches that I know of but if
[1:47:58] you come here today and you're just a
[1:48:00] member of this
[1:48:01] church you might as well just W walk out
[1:48:05] right back out the door and go live your
[1:48:06] life somewhere else you can't be just a
[1:48:09] member of the
[1:48:12] church
[1:48:14] no brother BR says I ain't looking for
[1:48:17] members I'm looking for the pure in
[1:48:19] heart people that'll believe the word
[1:48:22] amen
[1:48:23] thank you Lord people have so much
[1:48:25] difficulty overcoming because they
[1:48:27] because they don't fully commit to this
[1:48:30] and they hold too much back now you can
[1:48:32] be committed to the message and you can
[1:48:33] be committed to God and you and you go
[1:48:36] through a growth process now I don't not
[1:48:38] very many of us just just commit
[1:48:40] ourselves to God and we start changing
[1:48:42] and and and boom we become this mature
[1:48:45] Christian overnight I don't I don't
[1:48:47] believe
[1:48:48] that I believe God changes our heart
[1:48:50] instantly but we got a lot of things to
[1:48:52] sh sh out of ourselves especially when
[1:48:54] we've been in the world for so long we
[1:48:56] got a lot of bad habits that we got to
[1:48:58] lose and we got a lot of growing to do
[1:49:01] but if you don't commit fully you're
[1:49:04] never going to shake those things off
[1:49:07] brother brother Rand goes on he says and
[1:49:08] another sermon faith faith is our
[1:49:10] Victory he says but when it comes to
[1:49:12] Christ you're scared to take him at his
[1:49:15] word how is it faith is a victory you
[1:49:18] could submit your case to Jesus Christ
[1:49:19] tonight just as you and he's he's
[1:49:21] talking about healing here just as you
[1:49:23] submit your case to the
[1:49:28] doctor but he says you we're we're
[1:49:30] afraid to take him at his
[1:49:33] word and that's and that's what we do
[1:49:36] we're we're too many times the best
[1:49:39] Among Us here were afraid to take him at
[1:49:42] his word I'm afraid sometimes to take
[1:49:45] him at his word what if it doesn't
[1:49:47] happen what if I pray for somebody to be
[1:49:49] healed and I say I I say I proclaim the
[1:49:52] word the word says you're healed okay
[1:49:54] there's there's no two ways about it if
[1:49:56] I pray for for my wife and I prayed for
[1:49:58] her back that she's got a spinal
[1:50:01] fracture and I say and I pronounce God
[1:50:04] has healed you because according to the
[1:50:07] word she's been
[1:50:09] healed 100% thank you Lord and and then
[1:50:13] I we go to the doctor and the fracture
[1:50:14] still there and well did I not have
[1:50:18] enough
[1:50:19] Faith you know and so you start to
[1:50:22] question right and you start to wonder
[1:50:23] you know maybe maybe God's not going to
[1:50:25] keep his word you know maybe maybe he's
[1:50:27] going to keep it a different way or
[1:50:29] something you know but we become afraid
[1:50:31] that God's going to keep his word and if
[1:50:33] God can't keep his word for healing can
[1:50:34] he keep his word for salvation can God
[1:50:37] really keep that which I've committed
[1:50:39] against him till that day is he is he
[1:50:41] able to do it and we become afraid you
[1:50:44] know sometimes well it's real easy to
[1:50:45] accept that he's going to he's saved us
[1:50:47] and we have salvation but it's really
[1:50:49] hard to accept you know the other things
[1:50:51] that he tells us we ought to be
[1:50:53] to be peacemakers and to be to to to
[1:50:55] have love for one another and to be kind
[1:50:58] and and and we want to kick against
[1:51:00] those things in our lives and not kick
[1:51:02] kick the bad stuff out of our
[1:51:06] life he says but he says youve got
[1:51:09] you'll have faith that overcomes you'll
[1:51:11] never hunt another prayer line You'll
[1:51:13] never hunt nothing else you'll have it
[1:51:15] right there it'll be settled you'll
[1:51:16] never jump from church to church to see
[1:51:19] if this one has got it or that one has
[1:51:22] got it or they haven't got it what's
[1:51:25] important is you've got
[1:51:27] it you can't jump from place to place
[1:51:30] and and and think oh it's going to be
[1:51:32] better over here and it's going to be
[1:51:33] better over there when you don't have it
[1:51:37] and if you do have it why not stay in
[1:51:39] the place that needs your
[1:51:41] help but too many times we get we get
[1:51:44] just a little bit uncomfortable with
[1:51:45] something and and we leave be instead of
[1:51:49] instead of trying to become part of the
[1:51:51] solution to a problem brother Bram says
[1:51:53] in identification we're told in
[1:51:55] Scripture that when David when the enemy
[1:51:57] was coming in and they had assembled
[1:51:59] together David was trying to tell them
[1:52:01] about God and they're stood up one in
[1:52:03] their midst and actually this isn't
[1:52:04] David this is uh je King
[1:52:08] Jehoshaphat the the the this brother
[1:52:10] brandham says the wrong I just caught
[1:52:12] that brother brandham said the wrong
[1:52:14] wrong one here Jehoshaphat they was they
[1:52:17] was facing an army uh uh three different
[1:52:19] armies of Invaders had come and they
[1:52:22] were they were coming to to destroy
[1:52:25] Israel and Jehoshaphat the king gathered
[1:52:28] the people and they're all there in
[1:52:30] Jerusalem at the temple and they're
[1:52:32] praying and asking God what should we do
[1:52:34] what can we do what will we do and a man
[1:52:37] stands up a prophet and says that don't
[1:52:40] worry Don't Fear God's going to deliver
[1:52:42] the people this day the armies are going
[1:52:44] to be here he said he said you go out to
[1:52:46] the end of this this Creek this Brook
[1:52:49] and you're going to stand there and
[1:52:51] you'll watch the Lord deliver you and so
[1:52:54] Jehoshaphat gathered the people and he
[1:52:56] said they uh the scripture says that
[1:52:58] they marched out there singing and
[1:53:00] Triumph like they had already won the
[1:53:01] battle they got there they set their
[1:53:03] forces in Array and then God came and
[1:53:06] and this group started fighting this
[1:53:08] group started fighting this group and
[1:53:10] they all killed one another to the point
[1:53:12] where it says the the the Bible says
[1:53:14] that it took three days to gather the
[1:53:17] spoils 3 days to gather all the gold
[1:53:20] rings and earrings and all the jewelry
[1:53:23] and all the all the all of that stuff
[1:53:25] three days and and then the important
[1:53:27] other important thing is they came right
[1:53:29] back to Jerusalem rejoicing and praising
[1:53:32] God the same way that they went see they
[1:53:34] had a
[1:53:35] victory they had a victory and they
[1:53:37] weren't ashamed about it thank you
[1:53:41] Lord they didn't even have to do
[1:53:43] anything cuz God fought the battles you
[1:53:45] know but you know just to kind
[1:53:49] of believe I just have to skip too much
[1:53:52] too much to get through this quickly uh
[1:53:55] when you have a victory have you ever
[1:53:58] noticed that people treat you a little
[1:54:00] bit
[1:54:01] differently that that when you're happy
[1:54:04] yeah and you get around some of those
[1:54:06] people that aren't as happy as you they
[1:54:08] treat you a little odd they they have
[1:54:11] like a little bit different oh well
[1:54:12] you're just too spiritual oh you're just
[1:54:15] faking it and putting it on oh well that
[1:54:18] brother he's just you know you you you
[1:54:20] know we always have those little weirdos
[1:54:22] in the message uh you know oh god i'
[1:54:26] I've been called odd and strange and
[1:54:28] that that's just
[1:54:29] recently but you know I'm I'm grateful
[1:54:33] for what God's done for
[1:54:35] me there there was somebody in the Bible
[1:54:37] who got who saw somebody getting the
[1:54:39] Victory and was and and despised that
[1:54:42] person I don't know if you remember the
[1:54:44] story of of uh uh David's wife was a was
[1:54:48] a uh I I think I have it down here
[1:54:51] somewhere
[1:54:54] mik Micah Michael something like
[1:54:57] that I can't I can't remember just
[1:54:59] exactly but you remember I what I do
[1:55:01] remember is as as David was bringing the
[1:55:04] ark into the
[1:55:06] city the victory that they had and
[1:55:10] they're marching into the City and and
[1:55:12] singing the songs and Tamarin and the
[1:55:14] harps and the the trumpets and
[1:55:16] everything's going on and David is
[1:55:18] dressed in a says in a linen EOD and
[1:55:21] he's just dancing before the Lord he was
[1:55:23] so happy he had such a tremendous
[1:55:25] Victory and and she looked out of her
[1:55:29] window and said the scripture says she
[1:55:32] despised him in her heart despised him
[1:55:37] and there's then there's plenty of
[1:55:39] people that around that sit around in a
[1:55:41] message Pew that when they see you have
[1:55:44] the victory they despise you in their
[1:55:47] heart that they despise that you've
[1:55:49] overcome because they haven't done it
[1:55:52] eles and they see that you have
[1:55:54] something that they don't they can't get
[1:55:57] it they want it maybe they've given up
[1:55:59] on on ever getting it and they despise
[1:56:01] you
[1:56:03] am it
[1:56:05] happens I know it
[1:56:07] does brother brandom says it's a uh it's
[1:56:11] a terrible thing to a terrible devil to
[1:56:15] despise or dislike he says you mustn't
[1:56:18] do
[1:56:19] that he says you you can't ever cast a
[1:56:22] devil out by the wrong attitude it takes
[1:56:25] love to do that and love is the most
[1:56:27] powerful force that is here in the world
[1:56:30] a devil is always hate when people hate
[1:56:34] someone remember that's a terrible
[1:56:39] devil if if we if you ever look at
[1:56:42] somebody and and hate them in your
[1:56:45] heart that's that's what like police
[1:56:48] people call a clue that you've got
[1:56:50] something wrong right
[1:56:55] but we see that we see it in the
[1:56:59] message and maybe you've ran up against
[1:57:01] it brother brandom says how can men be
[1:57:04] so religiously blind become
[1:57:07] narrow-minded because of denominational
[1:57:10] barriers and hate their Brethren without
[1:57:12] a cause I'd say it like this how can how
[1:57:14] can messaged people become so
[1:57:17] religiously blinded and become so
[1:57:20] narrow-minded because of their
[1:57:22] particular Doctrine
[1:57:25] barrier oh we're perusia we're seven
[1:57:28] Thunders we're this we're that and hate
[1:57:31] their Brethren Without a Cause
[1:57:34] amen he says he says this he says it's
[1:57:37] so narrow and so little and they do it
[1:57:42] because of their
[1:57:44] Prestige because they want to be
[1:57:47] important wow and there's there's a lot
[1:57:50] of things out out there that that are in
[1:57:53] that are among star ranks as message
[1:57:54] Believers where people believe this and
[1:57:57] they draw their circle around it and
[1:57:59] they've got their top top Doctrine and
[1:58:01] the guy who came up with it and and
[1:58:04] everything else and you know what they
[1:58:06] you know a lot of them say well you just
[1:58:07] need a revelation to see this you just
[1:58:10] need a
[1:58:12] revelation and and I I'm of the opinion
[1:58:15] that if if I don't see it in the the
[1:58:18] word if I don't see it in scripture and
[1:58:20] if I don't see it in brother brandom in
[1:58:23] the message that he
[1:58:25] brought that that your Revelation is out
[1:58:28] of
[1:58:29] line some you somebody revealed
[1:58:32] something to you but it wasn't the Holy
[1:58:35] Ghost I'm not really interested in in in
[1:58:37] your your personal
[1:58:39] revelation
[1:58:41] amen God's not going to reveal reveal
[1:58:44] something that's the problem with
[1:58:47] legalism people people have they they'll
[1:58:49] they'll say well I uh you know God's
[1:58:52] revealed to me that that I have to I
[1:58:55] women have to wear their dress down to
[1:58:56] their their feet and then you got
[1:58:58] somebody else says well God revealed to
[1:59:00] me that that I could wear them to my
[1:59:02] knee well God's not going to reveal two
[1:59:05] different things to two different
[1:59:07] people I don't know what spirit's
[1:59:09] speaking to either one of you but it's
[1:59:11] not the same
[1:59:13] Spirit God doesn't give one group of his
[1:59:16] his elect one Revelation and then and
[1:59:18] then this group over here you know they
[1:59:20] got a different Revelation on the same
[1:59:22] subject that's not how God works either
[1:59:24] one of you is right and one of you is
[1:59:27] wrong so it has to go back to the word
[1:59:30] it has to line up to the
[1:59:34] word we we listen we'll we'll all be a
[1:59:37] lot better off if we just stick exactly
[1:59:39] with what the prophet said and what's in
[1:59:42] scripture and if God God convicts you a
[1:59:44] certain way and and and you don't feel
[1:59:46] like you feel like you need to dress
[1:59:48] this way and this is true Holiness don't
[1:59:50] you go and put that on some somebody
[1:59:52] else that's your that's your own
[1:59:55] conviction and it's good for you and
[1:59:56] maybe God gave it to you and you feel
[1:59:59] good dressing that way and you feel that
[2:00:01] that's Holiness and it looks right and
[2:00:04] it looks great and you're happy that's
[2:00:06] good but don't you go and put that on
[2:00:08] somebody
[2:00:09] else now the Bible doesn't have
[2:00:12] have I'm sorry brother Dell I probably
[2:00:14] shouldn't even talk Bible didn't ever
[2:00:17] put out some measuring stick and say
[2:00:18] your dress needs to be so many cubits
[2:00:20] long
[2:00:22] it didn't not that I know of it says
[2:00:23] dress dress humbly don't don't dress
[2:00:26] like a rich person and you know show off
[2:00:29] your wealth amongst poor people it says
[2:00:32] be dressed in
[2:00:35] humility don't don't you know man don't
[2:00:37] dress like a woman a woman don't dress
[2:00:38] like a man and that pretty much covers
[2:00:40] everything you know if your if your
[2:00:42] dress is showing off as a woman if it's
[2:00:44] showing off your curves on the front and
[2:00:46] on the back and it stands out and you
[2:00:49] notice that men are turning and looking
[2:00:51] at you and I don't know of any woman
[2:00:53] that that doesn't notice
[2:00:56] it then you're you're dressed
[2:01:00] inappropriately that's just that's just
[2:01:02] all there is to it but if you're dressed
[2:01:04] and and you your husband appreciates how
[2:01:06] you're dressed and you look and you feel
[2:01:09] pretty and and uh you don't notice guys
[2:01:11] turning their heads every time you walk
[2:01:13] down the grocery aisle or or down the
[2:01:15] aisle at church then then uh I'd say
[2:01:19] you're all
[2:01:20] right yeah
[2:01:23] thank you Lord
[2:01:27] good I shouldn't say things like that
[2:01:29] not not in my own pull
[2:01:38] pit oh my just trying to see what what
[2:01:41] all to to
[2:01:43] skip brother brandom says uh notice that
[2:01:47] the natural always tries to type the
[2:01:49] spiritual and he talks about Jacob and
[2:01:51] Esau and he said Esau was actually a
[2:01:53] better man than Jacob in the sight of
[2:01:55] man and he talks about him taking care
[2:01:57] of his daddy he said but but Jacob his
[2:02:00] whole soul was to get that birth right
[2:02:03] and that's what God recognized in him
[2:02:05] that was spiritual he says and it's
[2:02:07] always caused the natural to hate the
[2:02:10] spiritual he gives some some examples of
[2:02:13] Cain and Abel and and Kora Dam uh Moses
[2:02:17] and Judas and Jesus it causes a natural
[2:02:20] to hate the spiritual and he says they
[2:02:23] try to destroy the
[2:02:26] influence they try to destroy everything
[2:02:30] and it's nothing but
[2:02:32] jealousy and when you get around people
[2:02:34] and all they want to do is criticize and
[2:02:36] condemn someone
[2:02:38] else there's something wrong trying to
[2:02:41] undermine somebody else's influence if I
[2:02:44] get if I get around you know people I
[2:02:45] don't know and the first thing that they
[2:02:46] want to do is tell me how how this other
[2:02:49] person is bad and wrong and and look at
[2:02:51] what they're doing this thing and that
[2:02:53] thing there's something wrong with that
[2:02:55] person you know they there's jealousy
[2:02:59] going on there's something something
[2:03:01] that's happening but I can tell you one
[2:03:03] thing uh as for me when I get around
[2:03:05] people I don't especially if you've
[2:03:07] never known if I'm telling somebody
[2:03:09] about brother Dale I'm not going to tell
[2:03:11] tell people bad things about brother
[2:03:12] Dale there's not much bad there to tell
[2:03:15] anyway but you know if I knew if I knew
[2:03:17] something bad about brother Dell I
[2:03:19] wouldn't be like well yeah you can go on
[2:03:21] up there to brother brother Dell's
[2:03:22] church but you know he's a little bit
[2:03:24] like this and he's a little bit like
[2:03:26] that no I'm not I'm just going to be
[2:03:29] like yeah go on up there try it out if
[2:03:32] if you see something you don't like
[2:03:34] you'll you'll notice it I don't need to
[2:03:36] undercut somebody's influence what if
[2:03:38] somebody what if somebody came up here
[2:03:39] and had just the most amazing blessing
[2:03:43] you know I told I I I told him stay away
[2:03:46] from Brother Dell because he's he's he's
[2:03:48] not you know he's not on the word on
[2:03:50] this one particular thing him and he he
[2:03:52] and I disagree about this so you stay
[2:03:54] away and then they come and they get a
[2:03:57] real good blessing what's what do they
[2:03:59] think about me any what's wrong with you
[2:04:02] I went there and got blessed and you say
[2:04:03] it's
[2:04:05] bad I don't I we shouldn't seek to
[2:04:08] destroy anybody's
[2:04:12] influence he goes on he says uh in
[2:04:16] Joseph meeting his Brethren says we
[2:04:18] believe by faith we receive it uh
[2:04:23] but try to skip some of this he he talks
[2:04:27] about how Paul is preaching and the the
[2:04:29] the man fell out of the Loft killed
[2:04:30] himself and Paul raised him up and talks
[2:04:33] about Elijah raising up the baby the boy
[2:04:38] um and he says men even without the
[2:04:41] blessing of the Holy Ghost done Miracles
[2:04:43] and these F fellows are afraid to
[2:04:46] attack with the Holy
[2:04:49] Ghost my how pitiful
[2:04:52] and he says he goes on he he kind of
[2:04:55] jumps thoughts just a little bit and and
[2:04:56] he goes back to talking
[2:04:58] about he goes back to talking about
[2:05:01] those that that hate hate you and he
[2:05:03] says why it's because they're arrogant
[2:05:06] and they hate their Brethren Without a
[2:05:08] Cause just if Joseph was was hated
[2:05:10] Without a Cause amen is not because he
[2:05:13] was worthy to be hated since they did
[2:05:16] not believe him and he was living in a
[2:05:18] different realm and he says and I say
[2:05:21] this now as our time is getting short I
[2:05:23] say this with all tress of heart they
[2:05:27] hate the church today that has the
[2:05:30] supernatural it's jealousy and it's
[2:05:33] petty jealousy and it exists among human
[2:05:37] beings and you look at at a church that
[2:05:39] is moving and has a spirit of God moving
[2:05:42] in it and people are being saved people
[2:05:44] are coming in off the streets and it's
[2:05:46] growing and watch how many people want
[2:05:48] to become critical of it and they'll
[2:05:50] find something to pick it apart and say
[2:05:53] well well this Doctrine is a little bit
[2:05:54] off or this this is here is just a
[2:05:56] little bit wrong and this oh this
[2:05:58] brother you know 20 years ago he did
[2:06:00] something or recently as I heard well
[2:06:02] that that brother's father who used to
[2:06:04] be the pastor he did this 30 years ago
[2:06:08] and he's been dead for 10 but I'm still
[2:06:10] holding it against that
[2:06:12] church
[2:06:14] wow what is it brother Brion called it
[2:06:18] jealousy petty petty jealousy
[2:06:23] and we're not immune to it he said the
[2:06:25] disciples had it they were so ashamed of
[2:06:27] themselves 10 10 days before God gave
[2:06:29] them the power to heal the sick and to
[2:06:31] cast out devils and raise the dead and
[2:06:33] they had an epilepsy boy before them and
[2:06:35] failed to cast it out and Jesus came
[2:06:37] came came to the the mount and he healed
[2:06:39] the boy and they asked him why couldn't
[2:06:41] we do it and he said he didn't say I I
[2:06:43] took my power back he said I I gave you
[2:06:46] power I showed you where he give it but
[2:06:49] you can't show me where he took it back
[2:06:51] but brother BR talking about what we
[2:06:53] still have and what did Jesus rest his
[2:06:56] his words on he said because of your
[2:06:58] unbelief you couldn't do it yeah we're
[2:07:01] too afraid to to believe for the big
[2:07:04] things yeah oh well God will heal my
[2:07:07] headache yeah I can believe for a
[2:07:09] headache I it's it's going away one way
[2:07:12] or the other it's only going to be a
[2:07:13] couple hours so I can just Mo God healed
[2:07:16] my headache it took him two hours to
[2:07:17] heal it but he healed it but we don't
[2:07:18] want to say God can heal my cancer right
[2:07:21] yeah
[2:07:22] amen amen it's
[2:07:25] true a few days later they found a man
[2:07:28] that in that was was not in their
[2:07:30] ecclesiastical realm and they heard
[2:07:32] Jesus pronounce these things and he was
[2:07:34] casting out devils and Peter and John
[2:07:36] came and uh to tell him not to do it
[2:07:39] because he didn't belong to their their
[2:07:41] group and said oh well you're going to
[2:07:43] have to follow us and link up with with
[2:07:45] us we're the church and he let them and
[2:07:49] the man let them know to attend their
[2:07:50] own business he was getting along pretty
[2:07:52] pretty well without joining the apostles
[2:07:55] organization
[2:07:56] right they went back to Jesus and said
[2:07:59] we found him and he was casting out
[2:08:01] devils and they were jealous because he
[2:08:03] was doing what they couldn't do they got
[2:08:08] carnal so they came back and tattled on
[2:08:10] him and told Jesus and Jesus said let
[2:08:12] him alone he's doing a good work he's
[2:08:14] doing what I commanded you to do and you
[2:08:15] fail to do
[2:08:17] it see when we see people doing the
[2:08:22] supernatural when we see the
[2:08:23] supernatural at work and we don't have
[2:08:25] it in our own lives we start to get a
[2:08:27] little bit
[2:08:29] jealous we start to find find reasons to
[2:08:33] to put that person down and you wonder
[2:08:37] you wonder why when people walk
[2:08:40] away why they when when people walk away
[2:08:42] from this message and this is really
[2:08:44] truly what I'm getting at when people
[2:08:45] leave or have issues with the message is
[2:08:48] because it's not real in their own life
[2:08:51] right amen they see it happening in your
[2:08:53] life they seen it happen in their
[2:08:55] parents' life they've seen the things of
[2:08:57] God they seen people be healed but it
[2:09:00] never happened for them because they
[2:09:02] never fully committed to it in their
[2:09:04] heart they sat they sat on a church pew
[2:09:07] as a member of the of the church and
[2:09:09] they contributed they paid tithes they
[2:09:11] gave offerings they helped build a
[2:09:12] bigger church but they never committed
[2:09:14] to it in their
[2:09:16] heart and we just have to move past
[2:09:18] people like that we have to overcome
[2:09:21] and you know and we have
[2:09:24] to I'm in I'm in the position where two
[2:09:26] of my siblings my only two siblings both
[2:09:28] of them left the message and you know
[2:09:32] they'd say well we're we're free now to
[2:09:34] do you know what we want to do we're
[2:09:36] free to to dress this way and we're free
[2:09:39] to to you know buy every type of liquor
[2:09:42] we want to buy and we can we can uh just
[2:09:46] you know be what we want to be and we're
[2:09:48] we're still saved by God because God
[2:09:50] Saves us
[2:09:53] and I just have to feel sorry for him
[2:09:55] even even I have a SI a sibling who went
[2:09:59] as far as to attack the message and her
[2:10:04] and her husband made a website and I not
[2:10:06] going to say what that website is but
[2:10:08] like if you if you consider the top
[2:10:10] three websites that are against this
[2:10:12] message they're they're one of the top
[2:10:14] three and they've influenced a lot of
[2:10:17] people and I I I hate what they've done
[2:10:22] but I still love him I still love him
[2:10:25] and I have to realize that you know that
[2:10:28] uh that that's the devil and say that's
[2:10:31] that's not that wasn't my sister that
[2:10:33] wasn't her husband it's the devil and
[2:10:36] see that's that's
[2:10:38] overcoming that's that's how you
[2:10:40] overcome so overcome brother Bram says
[2:10:43] is to recognize the devil and every one
[2:10:45] of his tricks and to realize that that
[2:10:48] there's a devil and there's people who
[2:10:49] don't believe in the devil right which
[2:10:51] is a shame because the devil sure
[2:10:53] believes in
[2:10:54] them he's just he's just as real brother
[2:10:58] brand says you you must recognize he
[2:11:00] says you recognize him the devil you
[2:11:03] know that he's a devil and he's against
[2:11:05] you and then to overcome you must
[2:11:08] recognize that the god in you is greater
[2:11:11] and mightier than he is and that's the
[2:11:14] one in you that has already overcome him
[2:11:18] and by his grace you are more than a
[2:11:20] match for him amen that's real
[2:11:23] overcoming when you
[2:11:25] recognize and and and I I pray this Lord
[2:11:29] help me to recognize the
[2:11:32] enemy every one of his tricks and I have
[2:11:35] issues with people that sit in message
[2:11:37] church I have issues with men that
[2:11:39] preach behind message pull pits that
[2:11:41] have personal issues with me and and I
[2:11:44] have to I have to check myself because I
[2:11:47] can get an attitude and I've had and I
[2:11:50] have had an attitude
[2:11:51] and then had to like reel it back in and
[2:11:53] say no that is not my brother that is
[2:11:57] the devil and I'm sorry that the devil
[2:12:01] has that my I'm sorry that my brother
[2:12:03] has this weak area that the devil has
[2:12:05] been able to influence and use in this
[2:12:07] way and he hasn't overcome that and it
[2:12:10] hurts me and it and it is painful for me
[2:12:13] but that isn't my brother and I still
[2:12:15] love him I still pray for him and I
[2:12:17] still want good things for him and I
[2:12:20] just pray I just have to tell myself
[2:12:22] pray that that that God reveals to him
[2:12:25] that weak spot and until then what am I
[2:12:28] going to do I'm going to try to my best
[2:12:30] to cover it with prayer for
[2:12:34] him brother Bram says and why are we not
[2:12:37] a denomination he says now uh he says I
[2:12:40] charge you before Jesus Christ to stay
[2:12:44] right here with it and and don't don't
[2:12:47] let things get among you keep everything
[2:12:49] ironed right now and move right on he
[2:12:52] says you are Brethren and it's never
[2:12:54] your brother or sister that does
[2:12:56] anything wrong how number one how could
[2:12:59] they if they're a child of God they
[2:13:01] can't sin right they can't sin now the
[2:13:04] flesh can sin right amen and that's the
[2:13:08] devil acting brother Brandon says it's
[2:13:09] the spirit of the devil gets in there
[2:13:12] and he goes around he says just feel
[2:13:14] sorry for the brothers sister and know
[2:13:16] that is Satan getting in between and if
[2:13:19] you have some feeling about about it
[2:13:21] some negative feeling you get that right
[2:13:24] out of you right quick because it'll
[2:13:26] canker you so just stay away from it and
[2:13:31] and there's people that I talked to and
[2:13:33] i' i' I'm a a victim of this myself and
[2:13:36] maybe some of you to here today are as
[2:13:39] well that things have happened to you in
[2:13:42] your church life in your church
[2:13:43] experience that have hurt you that have
[2:13:46] caused you to go from I can't stay at
[2:13:48] this church and I've gone to this church
[2:13:49] and you happy there for a while and then
[2:13:52] more things happened and you got wounded
[2:13:54] there so you left and you gone from
[2:13:56] place to place or you've held something
[2:13:59] against somebody for years because of
[2:14:01] the hurt that they did to
[2:14:03] you and we need to forgive them and
[2:14:07] really truly realize that wasn't our
[2:14:09] brother that was or our sister that was
[2:14:12] just the devil it was the devil I'm
[2:14:15] going to pray for that person genuinely
[2:14:19] pray for him not not pray for him like
[2:14:21] God I hope you give them some fivefold
[2:14:23] Ministry just slap the devil right out
[2:14:26] of them no but genuinely be feel sorry
[2:14:30] for that person and pray for him that's
[2:14:32] the attitude that I want to have and I
[2:14:33] think that's the attitude that Christ
[2:14:34] wants us to have I don't want to be
[2:14:36] cankered up with bitterness and and and
[2:14:39] act that way brother Bram says it's a
[2:14:43] promise God made the promise let's stay
[2:14:44] with it God promised it no matter what
[2:14:47] you're going to have a battle if
[2:14:49] everything comes low and lazy why what
[2:14:52] are you
[2:14:54] overcoming what are you overcoming if
[2:14:57] you walk through this church life and
[2:14:59] you never had a battle I doubt you know
[2:15:02] what you know what the first thing that
[2:15:03] comes to my mind if I somebody tells me
[2:15:05] brother John I've been a Christian for
[2:15:07] 40 years I've never had a battle with
[2:15:10] anybody I've never had a struggle I come
[2:15:12] to church praise praise the Lord I pay
[2:15:14] my TI and and everything's just been
[2:15:17] gravy uh you know for 40 years you know
[2:15:20] what I thinking well the devil must not
[2:15:23] have to worry about you
[2:15:25] right he knows you ain't got it right
[2:15:29] see those one of two things either the
[2:15:31] devil ain't worried about you because he
[2:15:32] knows you ain't got it or you're living
[2:15:34] in such a high place that the devil
[2:15:36] don't want to come near you and touch
[2:15:37] you so one or the other and there's a
[2:15:39] whole lot more people that that think
[2:15:41] they think they got it they're in the
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:15:46] other says you you uh you've got to
[2:15:49] overcome something and you got to have
[2:15:51] some obstacles you so you tell me you
[2:15:54] don't have no problems or no obstacles I
[2:15:56] I'm doubting your testimony I'll just
[2:15:58] tell you right
[2:15:59] now um maybe you don't have no obstacles
[2:16:02] right
[2:16:03] now but you've had them and you're going
[2:16:05] to have them uh people that's different
[2:16:07] and fuss with you and tell you you're
[2:16:09] holy rulers and things like that who's
[2:16:11] put put that's put before you it's a
[2:16:13] trial and if you haven't got that then
[2:16:15] you're not even in the battle I should
[2:16:17] just let brother brandham say
[2:16:19] it says what do you join the CH the
[2:16:22] church what what did you join the Army
[2:16:24] and get training for to lay around strut
[2:16:26] up and down the streets and show off say
[2:16:28] that's the way some Christians act and
[2:16:30] we want to be looked up to that's the
[2:16:32] way some message people
[2:16:34] act there everybody wants to be
[2:16:37] special everybody wants to be told that
[2:16:41] that that they're the elect and they're
[2:16:43] the called out and they're
[2:16:45] saved one of the kids we watched a
[2:16:48] cartoon with the kids a long time ago
[2:16:49] and I know exactly which which one it
[2:16:51] was but uh it was a silly show but in in
[2:16:55] the the show the bad guy uh it was like
[2:16:58] they were superheroes and the bad guy
[2:17:01] made gadgets that gave everybody the
[2:17:04] ability to do things that the
[2:17:06] superheroes did uh so you know like if
[2:17:09] there's a superhero that could fly you
[2:17:11] know well here's a jetpack now you can
[2:17:12] fly stuff like that but he made this
[2:17:15] comment he said when everybody's special
[2:17:19] no one is
[2:17:21] right if everybody's special no one is
[2:17:24] and everybody wants to
[2:17:26] be us the special even when they're not
[2:17:30] even when they don't put the work into
[2:17:32] it everybody wants to wants to come and
[2:17:35] they want to be sit on on church and be
[2:17:37] told you're sitting in the last day's
[2:17:39] message underneath a Vindicated prophet
[2:17:41] and you've got it but a lot of people
[2:17:44] don't want to commit their hearts to it
[2:17:46] they don't want to line up with what the
[2:17:48] word says let people don't want to line
[2:17:50] up with with what brother brandom said
[2:17:52] most a whole lot of Christians and a
[2:17:54] whole lot of messaged Believers don't
[2:17:56] want to line up with what the Bible says
[2:17:58] let alone the message why you worrying
[2:18:00] about what brother brandom said when you
[2:18:02] don't even want to line up with what the
[2:18:03] Bible
[2:18:06] says we've got to overcome we've got to
[2:18:09] we've got to fight and there's going to
[2:18:11] be a battle he says uh he he goes on he
[2:18:16] says that's the way some Christians act
[2:18:18] we want to be looked up to he says you
[2:18:20] a't going to be looked up to you're
[2:18:22] going to be looked down on for all that
[2:18:24] live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[2:18:28] persecutions pick up the sword cut
[2:18:30] everything free from you and keep going
[2:18:33] on that's powerful amen sanctify us Lord
[2:18:38] fill us a new with the Holy Spirit May
[2:18:40] the Holy Ghost just reign in our hearts
[2:18:42] supremely that we'll walk forgetting the
[2:18:45] things that are in the past the muck and
[2:18:47] the me that we once live I say not just
[2:18:49] that but Lord help us to walk
[2:18:51] that your Holy Ghost Reigns in our
[2:18:52] hearts supremely that we can walk the
[2:18:54] walk and forget the things that we we
[2:18:56] went through at the last church and we
[2:18:59] can forget the things that our brother
[2:19:00] did to us two years ago or 10 years
[2:19:03] ago and we can walk past out of that
[2:19:05] muck and that Meer and press towards the
[2:19:08] mark of the High Calling where the
[2:19:09] lights can shine in sweetness and
[2:19:11] humility till every passor by can say
[2:19:14] there's a Christian that lives there on
[2:19:15] that Hill that person that woman that
[2:19:18] man is a real consecrated flower of God
[2:19:20] they're so sweet and so kind always
[2:19:23] loving and sweet and
[2:19:27] understanding he's praying Grant it
[2:19:29] father let us be
[2:19:32] salty that the Earth might thirst Grant
[2:19:36] it father and over that we can overcome
[2:19:38] the things of this world and the cares
[2:19:39] of this
[2:19:41] life and that and that's the testimony
[2:19:43] that I want when people talk about
[2:19:47] brother John they don't they don't say
[2:19:49] that I always look angry and upset and
[2:19:52] that I I always look like a uh you know
[2:19:55] I look like a soldier or something like
[2:19:57] that I want them to say he's loving that
[2:20:00] he's sweet not only and that he's
[2:20:03] understanding you know if I tell him
[2:20:05] about my faults or my mistakes he's not
[2:20:07] going to judge me he's going to he's
[2:20:09] going to say something to encourage me
[2:20:11] he's going to say something that maybe
[2:20:13] will'll help me out in this battle and
[2:20:15] give me some good advice you know from
[2:20:16] the
[2:20:19] word and and I think that's the
[2:20:21] testimony that you all want to have as
[2:20:25] well he says in in adoption and and I'm
[2:20:28] closing now this is the last quote I'll
[2:20:30] read he says that's what's bothering me
[2:20:32] though 12 12:23
[2:20:36] so I'm hurrying it up says that's what's
[2:20:39] bothering me though to preach to you
[2:20:41] people don't remain in the same
[2:20:43] condition you've been going in change
[2:20:45] now and that's the that's what your
[2:20:47] pastor here preaches every Sunday and
[2:20:49] every Wednesday when he's preaching is
[2:20:51] don't stay the same way you've been and
[2:20:54] it doesn't matter if you if you're a
[2:20:55] holy ghost filled or not there's always
[2:20:58] room to grow there's always more of God
[2:21:01] to learn about there's always room for
[2:21:03] improvement and until until we go home
[2:21:05] we're going to be growing don't stop
[2:21:08] growing and your pastor's understanding
[2:21:11] and if you come to him and you tell him
[2:21:12] you know I'm struggling with this and
[2:21:14] I'm struggling with that then your
[2:21:16] pastor with a pastor's heart is going to
[2:21:18] have compassion right amen going to pray
[2:21:21] with you he's going to seek the Lord for
[2:21:23] you and and don't I know brother Dell
[2:21:26] and you know like ministers we talk
[2:21:27] together a little bit and we don't tell
[2:21:29] every when we talk to
[2:21:31] Ley and and and somebody you know that's
[2:21:34] not a minister we don't we don't have
[2:21:36] the conversations that we have like we
[2:21:38] do with another Minister you know cuz
[2:21:41] Ministry we keep things in confidence
[2:21:44] and we don't talk we don't talk about um
[2:21:47] uh certain things with with with just
[2:21:50] with lay
[2:21:51] but between ministers that we experience
[2:21:53] the same types of battles and we have
[2:21:55] the same types of concerns we'll share
[2:21:58] some small things with one another we
[2:22:00] don't share everything but you know
[2:22:01] brother Dell tells me things and I know
[2:22:03] he's praying for you I know that you
[2:22:05] know like he'll tell me a little
[2:22:07] something about a situation and and and
[2:22:11] he shows me here I I've been searching
[2:22:13] through the scripture to find answers
[2:22:15] for this to to be able to explain it
[2:22:17] better to be you know so to give that
[2:22:19] person more confidence you're your
[2:22:20] pastor fights for you he gives us time
[2:22:24] and sacrifices to be in the word to be
[2:22:27] in prayer to search the scripture that
[2:22:29] that that he has the word to give you
[2:22:32] for your problem and your
[2:22:35] issues you know the funny thing is is
[2:22:37] like most of the time we don't even want
[2:22:38] to tell the pastor where we got
[2:22:39] something going
[2:22:40] on uh you know like we get a little bit
[2:22:43] embarrassed about it or something and we
[2:22:46] just well you know the Lord the holy
[2:22:48] spirit will move on him and he'll preach
[2:22:50] about some way and and we we think we
[2:22:53] got way too much courage to tell tell
[2:22:55] the pastor what's going on with somebody
[2:22:57] else we ought to have a little bit more
[2:22:59] courage to tell him what's going on with
[2:23:09] us he says don't remain in the same
[2:23:12] condition he says hear me as I say it
[2:23:14] thus saith the Lord I've never called
[2:23:18] myself this but you call me your Prophet
[2:23:21] or a prophet the world believes that the
[2:23:23] world around millions and millions of
[2:23:25] people and I've spoke directly and
[2:23:28] indirectly to 10 or 12 million
[2:23:32] people uh and I've seen tens of
[2:23:36] thousands of visions and signs and
[2:23:37] wonders and not one of them has ever
[2:23:40] failed and that's right he's foretold me
[2:23:43] things that's never failed to happen
[2:23:45] just exactly I'll bring any man to trial
[2:23:49] for that that that's right I don't claim
[2:23:51] to be a prophet but you listen to me
[2:23:53] thus sayeth the Lord it'll take perfect
[2:23:56] love to put you in that place because
[2:24:00] for that's all that there was there no
[2:24:04] matter how much money no matter what
[2:24:06] money how much religious demonstrations
[2:24:08] how many Good Deeds you've done or
[2:24:10] whatever you've done that won't count
[2:24:12] nothing on that day it'll take perfect
[2:24:15] love so whatever you do lay aside
[2:24:18] everything else until you are just so
[2:24:20] filled with the love of God till you can
[2:24:23] love those who hate
[2:24:26] you amen I I'd say it like this it
[2:24:30] doesn't matter how much offerings that
[2:24:33] you put in the offering plate it doesn't
[2:24:36] matter uh how long you've sat on a
[2:24:39] message
[2:24:40] Pew it doesn't matter how many times
[2:24:43] you've helped people move houses or or
[2:24:46] or done you know good things for people
[2:24:49] it won't count for
[2:24:52] nothing it'll take perfect
[2:24:55] love and Lord help us when we have
[2:24:58] attitudes towards people that have that
[2:25:01] have hurt us and and we have awe in our
[2:25:04] heart against them and we won't let it
[2:25:07] go for years and years to hang on to
[2:25:10] things that's not the love of Jesus
[2:25:13] Christ that's not the love but I believe
[2:25:16] the bride will have that love and I
[2:25:18] believe that each and every one of us
[2:25:19] can get get there and and I I'm telling
[2:25:23] you this and saying this if you feel
[2:25:25] like I'm pointing a finger at you cuz I
[2:25:27] I know this this sermon has been very
[2:25:30] could be taken as like almost negative
[2:25:32] like I'm getting on to you or something
[2:25:35] now I brother brother Dale has never
[2:25:36] told me anything that would make me
[2:25:38] preach this sermon to say this to you
[2:25:41] but I tell you what it is is if you feel
[2:25:43] like I have one finger pointing at you
[2:25:45] believe me I've got the other three
[2:25:47] pointing right back at me because that's
[2:25:49] too easy for me to get attitude I my
[2:25:52] family are legendary Grudge holders and
[2:25:55] we can hold grudges and build walls not
[2:25:57] only build the wall we'll dig a moat
[2:25:59] we're going to fill that with water and
[2:26:01] then we're going to put oil on top of
[2:26:02] the water we're going to set the oil on
[2:26:04] fire so the water is burning and you
[2:26:06] aren't coming anywhere near my
[2:26:13] castle I say Lord help me God help me I
[2:26:17] want to have that type of love I want to
[2:26:19] have that type of attitude that the
[2:26:22] people that have hurt me because I've
[2:26:23] been
[2:26:25] hurt many times by many
[2:26:27] people people have said things about me
[2:26:30] that ought never to have been said lied
[2:26:33] about me said things that that oh thank
[2:26:37] you sweetie lied about me said things
[2:26:40] that uh weren't true in any way shape or
[2:26:44] form just to undercut my influence to
[2:26:47] undercut uh what people would accept
[2:26:49] from me
[2:26:50] and it it e it is real easy for me to
[2:26:55] continue to hold that stuff against them
[2:26:58] and every even now some of that that
[2:27:00] happened 10 years ago I have to go back
[2:27:03] and I have to remind myself John that
[2:27:06] wasn't your brother that wasn't your
[2:27:08] that wasn't your brother that was just
[2:27:10] the devil that got in there and yes it
[2:27:12] hurt the hurt was real the pain was real
[2:27:15] and it took you a while to get over it
[2:27:17] and and I tell you what even
[2:27:20] today even today I have a problem
[2:27:23] trusting people because of the things
[2:27:25] that I've experienced while while being
[2:27:28] in this
[2:27:30] message in the way the people has acted
[2:27:33] to trust I I have a very difficult time
[2:27:35] doing it and that's why when I make a
[2:27:38] friend I hold on to that friend when I
[2:27:41] find a good man I hold on to that good
[2:27:44] man and it's one of the reasons why I'm
[2:27:46] so proud to have brother Dale as my
[2:27:48] friend is he's he's a good man if we we
[2:27:52] don't agree on everything last night we
[2:27:54] were talking about a a small little
[2:27:56] thing that we disagree about in the word
[2:27:58] but you know what it don't matter don't
[2:28:02] matter one bit it's it's perfectly fine
[2:28:05] we we love one another we're shake shake
[2:28:07] hands and it's like it doesn't matter
[2:28:09] about it doesn't pertain to anything
[2:28:11] important
[2:28:13] salvation and brother Dell's my friend
[2:28:16] we've known each other now going on 10
[2:28:18] 10 years if at least ever since you had
[2:28:21] the the church over at the the
[2:28:24] house I think I was one of the first
[2:28:26] people to come and Minister for you and
[2:28:29] brother Dell has been a true friend to
[2:28:31] me and I have somebody like that I latch
[2:28:35] on to them because I don't have many
[2:28:36] good
[2:28:37] friends we have a lot of acquaintances a
[2:28:40] lot of people that you meet all on your
[2:28:41] journey and you might like them and
[2:28:43] enjoy them and you see them you know
[2:28:46] once and you're happy to see them again
[2:28:47] but there's very few uh people that I I
[2:28:50] call my friend uh that a true friend and
[2:28:55] so I'm I'm grateful I'm grateful for
[2:28:56] your pastor and I want you to be just as
[2:28:59] grateful for him as I am and uh have
[2:29:02] Grace for for
[2:29:04] him because he's still growing too maybe
[2:29:07] one day he'll actually agree with me on
[2:29:08] the thing we were talking
[2:29:13] about maybe maybe God will have me agree
[2:29:15] with him either way it don't matter it
[2:29:18] doesn't matter a bit
[2:29:21] uh I love you and I'm grateful for each
[2:29:25] one of you being here today and I hope I
[2:29:29] hope something was said that just kind
[2:29:30] of help encourage you along the way if
[2:29:32] not just to change your views that you
[2:29:35] that you've had for a while to to help

[2:30:06] together uh let let me ask you this and
[2:30:09] and I'm I'm not looking but God God's
[2:30:13] looking how would you be honest enough
[2:30:17] to raise your hand and say
[2:30:21] say to the Lord I I've held on to things
[2:30:23] for a little bit too long things that I
[2:30:26] ought not to have held on
[2:30:28] to how many would be honest enough and
[2:30:32] recognize that the the past hurts that
[2:30:35] you've
[2:30:36] experienced to realize that wasn't your
[2:30:38] brother and not I'm not saying that they
[2:30:41] didn't hurt you I'm not saying that your
[2:30:42] hurt your pain isn't real but to really
[2:30:45] truly say in your heart God I know that
[2:30:49] wasn't my brother that wasn't my sister
[2:30:52] that was the
[2:30:55] devil would and would you take the step
[2:30:58] to release your bitterness and your pain

[2:34:52] want to pray for Sister Laura and and I
[2:34:55] want
[2:34:56] to I want some of the brothers or that
[2:35:00] that really believe you know sometimes
[2:35:02] we have a thought that God has to do it
[2:35:05] my
[2:35:06] way and you
[2:35:07] know Sister Laura is going to a
[2:35:12] hospital and they're going to witness to
[2:35:15] those
[2:35:16] people amen God could have healed sister
[2:35:19] Lord she made her body God made her body
[2:35:22] that's like a piece of cake but God's
[2:35:24] got an agenda for her to touch somebody
[2:35:26] else's life and her Affliction this
[2:35:29] ain't a mistake God didn't not heal the
[2:35:32] prayer he's actually going to heal
[2:35:33] somebody else's prayer and just changing
[2:35:36] your idea amen God didn't fail amen and
[2:35:41] so you know you know when we shared
[2:35:45] our our our our thing to nicar
[2:35:50] last week I'd actually forgot and and
[2:35:54] uh and God brought it back to my memory
[2:35:56] but when we were going to Nicaragua we
[2:35:59] were almost in an
[2:36:00] accident the van went to pull out a pass
[2:36:03] and semi and another car was coming up
[2:36:05] beside us to pass us and you know we
[2:36:07] Overlook those things I've been in
[2:36:09] accidents in other countries serious
[2:36:11] accidents and and actually the people
[2:36:13] thought we were dead in Uganda but you
[2:36:15] know God God's not making mistakes he's
[2:36:18] there all the time we come home we just
[2:36:20] driving and you think of brother Bart
[2:36:22] driving this weather went home and
[2:36:24] trucks and cars in the ditch on 8
[2:36:26] Highway we just take for granted that
[2:36:28] we're not in the ditch but God has a
[2:36:30] purpose for everything and he's
[2:36:33] protecting us and even if you're in an
[2:36:34] accident it's for you're good in that
[2:36:36] and so our little grandson brother uh
[2:36:39] Oliver you know the doctors everything
[2:36:42] that has happened you say why was he
[2:36:43] born premature he he's he's contradicted
[2:36:46] everything the doctors ever said and so
[2:36:49] said this week they said we're going to
[2:36:52] eventually take the feed in tuo cuz he
[2:36:55] was eating so good and before they were
[2:36:58] PL days before they were pled on taking
[2:37:00] it up he ripped it out and they said
[2:37:04] well he's just eating good enough we
[2:37:05] don't need it but see God has a plan you
[2:37:08] see what I'm saying that it's a
[2:37:10] testimony to them it's a testimony to my
[2:37:13] son and and Riley amen it's so and it's
[2:37:16] the same with Sister Laura and so we're
[2:37:18] not we're not going to pray for sist the
[2:37:19] Lord and say God change your idea we're
[2:37:22] just going to say God just be there and
[2:37:23] witness to the doctors witness to the
[2:37:26] nurses witness to the people that you go
[2:37:28] up the elevator to and when when you
[2:37:30] just direct the healing of sister Lis
[2:37:33] doctors can't heal nobody they can just
[2:37:35] do what they they know science but then
[2:37:37] God will come in and take all the pain
[2:37:39] away and then who knows that there'll be
[2:37:41] somebody Sav because of it amen just
[2:37:44] like brother John was talking about this
[2:37:45] denominational pastor we took him to
[2:37:47] Pizza Hut on Friday night and took them
