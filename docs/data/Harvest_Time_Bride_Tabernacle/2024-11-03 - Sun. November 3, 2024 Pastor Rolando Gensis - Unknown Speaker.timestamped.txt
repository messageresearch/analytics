[34:50] tribulations and you know every Son of
[34:52] God will be tried and tested to to to
[34:54] prove that they're a Son of God and you
[34:56] might not be able to see see God in your
[34:58] life
[35:00] today but if you can feel the tug on the
[35:02] string you might have cloudes of Health
[35:06] you might have clouds of of depression
[35:08] you might have clouds of finances you
[35:10] might have Satan just building the
[35:12] clouds he's thinking that you're the
[35:14] only one like the prophet there's nobody
[35:17] else serving
[35:18] God but if you can feel the tug he say

[35:23] feel the pull oh hallelujah it's an
[35:26] amazing Revelation that God give us in

[35:38] amen God give them Grace to uh you know
[35:43] God's will is perfect every time God's
[35:46] will is perfect every time and his
[35:49] timing is perfect you know they tried
[35:51] before to sell they tried before it to
[35:54] move and in the same time that God
[35:57] blessed them to sell in their house or
[35:58] looking at a place very close to us for
[36:02] just slightly over half price to what
[36:06] they sold for now you know our Prophet
[36:08] said things like this he said anytime
[36:10] you move closer to church you're in
[36:12] God's will now there now there's a
[36:14] church in Kitchener a wonderful brother
[36:16] Jose's church but he said something else
[36:18] anytime you are less burdened by the
[36:21] cares and finances of life and you can
[36:25] get out of
[36:26] debt I know we don't think of this but
[36:29] the Bible's still
[36:31] real and the Bible says the
[36:34] borrower I know what brother Bram said
[36:37] about that but if you're a
[36:39] borrower you have a chain on your
[36:42] leg and if they can get out of hundreds
[36:46] of thousands of dollars in debt they can
[36:49] spend more Church time more family time
[36:52] more devotion time more prayer time and
[36:55] all these things amen that's amazing and
[36:58] God is very good now now I have their
[37:01] permission to share that amen and just
[37:03] pray for them that it'll just fall
[37:05] together you know it's a hectic time for
[37:07] them because they're going to have a
[37:08] baby too and so they're literally going
[37:11] to have a baby and there's just a lot of
[37:13] things going on they actually haven't
[37:14] purchased the place they're looking at
[37:16] yet can you imagine you know just but
[37:20] God's it's all about him he's completely
[37:23] in control even though you maybe can't
[37:25] see him because of the cloud I can feel
[37:27] the
[37:28] amen let's sing that song as our brother
[37:31] Rolando comes from the Philippines

[50:09] Christ spiritual
[50:11] houses and holy
[50:14] priesthood to sacrifice to offer up S
[50:17] spiritual sacrifices yes now if you talk
[50:22] about priests in the Old Testament they
[50:25] are those people who live with a
[50:28] dedicated life to God and not to live
[50:33] for their own but to serve for their
[50:37] Brethren Hallelujah in when when Joshua
[50:42] had divided the
[50:44] land the Levites which are the priests
[50:49] Hallelujah ah they didn't they didn't
[50:51] have any portion of the land Hallelujah
[50:56] but I believe that God took care of them
[50:59] because their portion is God
[51:03] hallelujah
[51:06] and in Revelation 5: 10 it says that he
[51:10] had he has made us unto our God Kings
[51:16] and

[51:53] understand this spiritual without uh
[51:57] uh the natural Hallelujah and the
[52:00] natural is Israel is type Allelujah to
[52:04] the church which is the spiritual Israel
[52:08] and now this morning I would like to
[52:10] take an example Allelujah of the journey
[52:13] Israel's Journey from Egypt into the
[52:16] promised land Hallelujah and baham said
[52:20] we know that they have the promised land
[52:23] the natural land but baham said that
[52:27] our promised land is not a natural land
[52:30] no Hallelujah many people he says in uh
[52:33] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[52:35] thee he says many people refer the
[52:38] promised land to the Millennium to the
[52:40] Millennium it is not the promised land
[52:45] had Wars and
[52:47] killings the Millennium won't have any
[52:50] wars or
[52:51] killings it referred to the Holy Spirit
[52:55] the battle grounds am hallelujah our
[52:59] promise is our life in the Holy Ghost
[53:04] Hallelujah they have a promise natural
[53:08] land but our promise Peter said for the
[53:11] promise is unto you and unto your
[53:14] children to your children's children
[53:17] Hallelujah andto all that he is going to
[53:20] call Hallelujah This Promise is for them
[53:24] Hallelujah which is the holy ghost that
[53:25] we can possess that kind of Life
[53:29] Hallelujah and then once we become a
[53:33] part of that body the body of Jesus
[53:36] Christ Braham said by one Spirit yes by
[53:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost by one
[53:43] Spirit we are all baptized into that
[53:45] body and once we we became a part of
[53:48] that body barram said we are not on a
[53:53] picnic
[53:55] Hallelujah we are on a
[53:59] Battleground right Hallelujah so the
[54:03] battle will began will
[54:05] begin
[54:08] Hallelujah and now on Israel's
[54:12] Journey from Egypt into the promised
[54:15] land they have these three stages yeah
[54:19] Hallelujah and uh just like our
[54:23] Redemption Hallelujah so our Redemption
[54:27] is
[54:29] justification and uh sanctification and
[54:32] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[54:34] Israel they also have this Allelujah the
[54:37] church the C out ones when they left
[54:41] Egypt that's
[54:42] justification and then when they cross
[54:45] the Red Sea Allelujah killed all behind
[54:50] them killed the Egyptians killed the
[54:53] world all behind them and through the
[54:58] blood Hallelujah that kills all the
[55:00] human desires the evil desires
[55:03] Hallelujah and God was sanctifying them
[55:06] through the blood Hallelujah of the
[55:09] animals and then the third uh stage is
[55:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was
[55:16] when they crossed Jordan into the
[55:19] promised land Jordan means
[55:23] death
[55:24] Hallelujah and
[55:27] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are
[55:30] born into that body of Jesus Christ
[55:33] which is the family of God hallelujah
[55:37] and
[55:38] then you know in the denomination
[55:41] sometimes they say they have this their
[55:43] testimonies oh since I became a
[55:45] Christian I am I am now peaceful I am
[55:49] now of course we we are now resting in
[55:53] Christ Hallelujah but that's the time
[55:57] that battle begin yes battle began
[56:02] Hallelujah because when the greatest
[56:06] battle that happened in the time of
[56:08] Israel was not when they left
[56:13] Egypt the greatest battle happened
[56:16] Hallelujah when they Cross
[56:19] Jordan the battle was intensified when
[56:22] they started to possess the promised
[56:24] land H Allelujah those who Cross

[59:24] for the Believers that Satan is doing
[59:27] everything that he can
[59:30] Hallelujah we should know our enemy it
[59:34] is not the brother it's not the sister
[59:36] hallelujah amen we have the common enemy
[59:39] which is Satan that's right Hallelujah
[59:41] and we we should realize that Hallelujah
[59:46] so
[59:48] uh the scripture that we read it says
[59:51] that we then that are strong ought to
[59:54] Bear infirmities of the weak yes sir
[59:57] Hallelujah and it
[1:00:00] means we should
[1:00:02] not we should not uh just live for
[1:00:05] ourselves but but for
[1:00:08] our neighbors for our brothers right and
[1:00:12] baram said uh in the message that day on
[1:00:16] Calvary he says now the first thing I
[1:00:19] want to say is Jesus never lived for
[1:00:23] himself his life was spent for
[1:00:27] others that's perfectly eternal life
[1:00:31] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:00:35] good things that's fine but when you
[1:00:39] live your life to
[1:00:42] yourself you haven't eternal life amen
[1:00:46] hallelujah eternal life is living for
[1:00:50] others hallelujah
[1:00:53] hallelujah eternal life is living for us
[1:00:57] others true wow we should be a support
[1:01:02] we should be a help
[1:01:04] Hallelujah but you Lord
[1:01:07] remember it says we did that are strong
[1:01:11] ought to Bear the infirmities of the
[1:01:14] weak to
[1:01:17] Bear the infirmities of the weak amen
[1:01:21] hallelujah but the question is how can
[1:01:25] you
[1:01:26] bear the
[1:01:27] infirmities of the weak when you
[1:01:31] yourself is
[1:01:35] weak we knew yourself is still a
[1:01:42] baby Hallelujah but praise God
[1:01:46] hallelujah I believe we recognize it and
[1:01:49] even we sing it I am weak but Thou Art
[1:01:52] strong right am Hallelujah but
[1:01:56] the reason he gave us this faithful
[1:01:59] Ministry is in order for us not to
[1:02:02] remain remain
[1:02:05] children huh
[1:02:08] Hallelujah right in Ephesians chapter 4
[1:02:12] from verse 11 to 14 it says and he gave
[1:02:15] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:02:18] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:02:21] teachers for what perfecting for the
[1:02:24] perfecting of the same
[1:02:26] sa perfecting of the
[1:02:29] saints
[1:02:31] Saints must be perfected they are
[1:02:34] already Saints and they must be
[1:02:36] perfected for the work of the ministry
[1:02:39] for the edifying edifying edifying of
[1:02:42] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:02:45] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:02:47] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:02:50] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:02:55] stature
[1:02:56] of the fullness of
[1:02:58] Christ so we can see here brothers and
[1:03:01] sisters that Paul he was
[1:03:04] repeating
[1:03:05] perfecting unto a perfect man measure of
[1:03:09] the stature of the
[1:03:11] fullness Hallelujah the word perfect
[1:03:14] here it means full grown that's right
[1:03:18] matured that's right adult Hallelujah
[1:03:22] not to remain
[1:03:23] children not to remain uh weak Believers
[1:03:28] Hallelujah that we H for be no more
[1:03:32] children right
[1:03:34] yes to to and fr and carried about with
[1:03:38] every wi of Doctrine by the slight of
[1:03:40] men and canning craftiness whereby delay
[1:03:44] in which to
[1:03:46] deceive
[1:03:48] Hallelujah God will not marry a baby no
[1:03:52] Jesus Christ will not marry an immature
[1:03:55] that's Hallelujah right
[1:03:59] because an
[1:04:01] immature it cannot
[1:04:04] produce Seed Life
[1:04:08] Hallelujah
[1:04:11] so he wants us to be
[1:04:15] matured which is it means
[1:04:18] perfect Hallelujah because a child
[1:04:21] cannot help a child is weak cannot help
[1:04:26] Hallelujah the infirmities of the
[1:04:29] weak Hebrews chap 5 verse 12 it says for
[1:04:34] when the time you ought to be
[1:04:37] teachers ye have need that one teach you
[1:04:40] again which be the first principles of
[1:04:44] the Oracles of God and are become such
[1:04:47] as have need of milk and not of strong
[1:04:53] meat it seems that the Paul is
[1:05:02] disappointed maybe Paul is saying
[1:05:06] oh you've been 20 years 30 years 40
[1:05:11] years Hallelujah and you ought to be
[1:05:13] teachers
[1:05:15] now you ought to help you ought to teach
[1:05:19] you to to
[1:05:21] support and then you are still a baby
[1:05:24] needing milk
[1:05:26] and not strong strong
[1:05:29] meat
[1:05:33] Hallelujah on
[1:05:35] now
[1:05:39] now what is a sign what is a sign of of
[1:05:43] a child or a
[1:05:48] babe what
[1:05:51] is the visible sign that a Christian
[1:05:55] is still a babe or a
[1:05:59] child let's read 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:06:05] 3 and I
[1:06:08] Brethren could not speak unto you as
[1:06:11] unto
[1:06:13] spiritual but as unto
[1:06:16] caral Hallelujah so spiritual and
[1:06:21] caral even as unto babes in Christ so to
[1:06:27] be
[1:06:27] babes is to be
[1:06:31] carnal to be spiritual is to be
[1:06:36] matured and now Paul here he is not
[1:06:40] doubting them being in Christ right no
[1:06:45] no but they are still a
[1:06:49] babe but even though they are babed but
[1:06:53] praise God they are already in Christ am
[1:06:55] Hallelujah babe in Christ I have fed you
[1:06:59] with milk and not with
[1:07:02] meat they canot bear strong meat right
[1:07:06] Hallelujah that's why Paul said I am
[1:07:09] just feeding
[1:07:12] you with milk and another meat for
[1:07:15] hither to you were not able to Bear it
[1:07:18] neither yet now are ye
[1:07:22] able Hallelujah for ye are yet caral
[1:07:27] right

[1:37:20] Hallelujah but
[1:37:24] he just
[1:37:32] believed but thank God Hallelujah there
[1:37:37] were Joshua and calib who didn't depend
[1:37:39] on their senses but they held to what
[1:37:42] the word
[1:37:44] said and we need more Joshua and Caleb
[1:37:48] today
[1:37:50] Hallelujah now
[1:37:54] and after this God commanded Joshua to
[1:37:57] circumcise the people before the face
[1:38:00] before the face Hallelujah another
[1:38:04] battle in Joshua chapter
[1:38:07] 5: 2-5 it says at that time the Lord
[1:38:11] said unto Joshua make these sharp knives
[1:38:14] and circumcise again the children of
[1:38:16] Israel the second time and Yeshua made
[1:38:20] him sharp knives and circumcised the
[1:38:22] children of Israel at the the hill of
[1:38:24] the
[1:38:25] forkins and this
[1:38:28] is the cause why Joshua did circumcised
[1:38:32] all the people that came out of Egypt
[1:38:35] that were males even all the men of War
[1:38:39] died in the
[1:38:40] wilderness by the way after they came
[1:38:43] out of
[1:38:44] Egypt now all the people that came out
[1:38:47] were circumcised but all the people that
[1:38:50] were born in the children yes sir in the
[1:38:53] wilderness
[1:38:54] by the way as they came forth out of
[1:38:56] Egypt then they had not circumcised so
[1:39:00] here's the thing brother and
[1:39:04] sisters all the people all the
[1:39:07] males that came out of Egypt they were
[1:39:11] all
[1:39:12] circumcised right right but those that
[1:39:16] were born in the
[1:39:20] wilderness no circumcision yeah
[1:39:25] why in Egypt they don't have a
[1:39:29] prophet and yet they remember the word
[1:39:32] the Covenant of God to to to
[1:39:35] Abraham
[1:39:37] wow in Egypt they were very
[1:39:41] busy from their task Masters their
[1:39:44] obligation to their task Masters and to
[1:39:46] their families and yet they have time to
[1:39:50] circumcise why is it that when they came
[1:39:53] to the
[1:39:55] Wilderness they were not busy
[1:40:00] and on most of all they have the prophet
[1:40:05] yes yes but they didn't have time to
[1:40:08] circumcise their CH wow children why in

[1:40:46] Canaan baptism of the Holy
[1:40:50] Ghost and our circumcision is not in
[1:40:53] flesh but in spirit in the
[1:40:56] heart Hallelujah by the baptism of the
[1:40:59] Holy Ghost
[1:41:01] so during
[1:41:03] Wilderness it is not the stage of just
[1:41:07] no baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the
[1:41:10] stage of sanctification so there is no
[1:41:15] circumcision which is the type of the
