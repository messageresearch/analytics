[59:53] sake and there was of the House of Saul
[59:57] a servant whose name was Zeba and when
[1:00:00] they had called unto him called him unto
[1:00:03] David the king said unto him art thou
[1:00:05] Zeba and he said thy servant is he the

[1:00:12] those the house of Saul any of the House
[1:00:15] of Saul that I might show kindness the

[1:00:20] unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son
[1:00:24] which is lame on his feet drop down to
[1:00:27] verse six now when MTH the son of
[1:00:31] Jonathan the son of Saul was come unto
[1:00:34] David he fell on his face and did

[1:00:39] said
[1:00:42] MF and he answered Behold thy
[1:00:47] servant and David said fear

[1:00:53] for Jonathan thy father's sake
[1:00:56] and will restore
[1:00:58] thee all the land of Saul thy
[1:01:02] father and thou shalt eat bread at my

[1:01:11] word while your heads are bowed this
[1:01:13] evening if you just like to be
[1:01:14] remembered in prayer maybe by the
[1:01:16] lifting of your hand you'd like to just
[1:01:17] say Lord I have a need tonight my hands
[1:01:20] up as well Lord Jesus what a privilege
[1:01:24] it is to come into to this place yes

[1:01:43] praise for what you're doing even right
[1:01:44] now and for what you will do in the
[1:01:46] future to come if there is a future
[1:01:48] before us for Lord we know that thou the
[1:01:51] same yesterday today and forever as we
[1:01:54] stand here and divine presence we do not
[1:01:57] come here Lord according to our own
[1:02:00] feeling of what we'd like to be doing on
[1:02:02] a Saturday night perhaps maybe folk
[1:02:05] tired from working and what more and
[1:02:07] maybe it's a bit of a sacrifice but Lord
[1:02:10] yet I was glad when they said unto me
[1:02:13] let us go to the house of the Lord
[1:02:15] hallelujah so father we thank you for
[1:02:17] this Divine appointment that has been
[1:02:19] set before us for Lord we know where two

[1:02:32] we want to thank you and praise you for
[1:02:34] being that same God yesterday today and
[1:02:36] forever we pray you'll come into this
[1:02:39] place Lord and that you'll take your
[1:02:40] word you'll break it forth the bread of
[1:02:43] life to each one of us open our hearts
[1:02:45] and our appetites that we might receive
[1:02:48] and eat down that word of God lord Jesus
[1:02:51] anoint me as your son tonight Lord to be
[1:02:53] able to get out of the way and speak
[1:02:55] that with which the people need to
[1:02:56] receive and hear father may you allow
[1:02:59] their eyes and ears to come open tonight
[1:03:02] to that which you will speak to us as we
[1:03:04] commit all of this to you in the name of
[1:03:06] Jesus Christ we pray and all of God's
[1:03:09] children said amen amen you may be
[1:03:11] seated may the Lord bless you real
[1:03:13] good amen we we we thank the Lord for
[1:03:16] the scripture reading and we're
[1:03:18] certainly grateful for the reading of
[1:03:20] the word of the Lord as we know that
[1:03:23] there's many things that a man could say
[1:03:26] but one thing for sure one word from God
[1:03:30] Amen is enough to solve all of the
[1:03:32] problems of our life and the Destinies
[1:03:35] that we hold and the directions that
[1:03:37] we'll take one word from God can change
[1:03:40] the course of everything around us amen
[1:03:42] and place us into the presence of the
[1:03:44] Lord in a way we never dream was
[1:03:46] possible before and I so love the Bible
[1:03:50] and how that the scripture lays out
[1:03:53] everything that we have need of
[1:03:56] and what I mean not only does it tell us
[1:03:58] about the things and the conditions of
[1:04:01] healing and salvation and deliverance
[1:04:03] and powers and authorities of God but
[1:04:05] the Bible lays out all of the patterns
[1:04:08] of life that we need to know how that
[1:04:10] human beings lived in this filthy old
[1:04:13] Satan's Eden I I want you to remember
[1:04:15] that this has not just been Satan's Eden
[1:04:18] just today but Satan brother said for
[1:04:20] 6,000 years has been restructuring and
[1:04:24] redoing and Reinventing the world around
[1:04:26] us amen and each year that goes by they
[1:04:30] get a little bit weaker wiser and sin
[1:04:32] heaps up and gets worse and worse as we
[1:04:34] go on Amen but Christian people those
[1:04:38] that have followed on to know the Lord
[1:04:40] they have stood the test of every age of
[1:04:43] every Century of every decade of every
[1:04:45] hour of every season of every time no
[1:04:47] matter what the difficulty may have been
[1:04:50] amen God's people have always Rose to
[1:04:53] the occasion can you say amen amen and
[1:04:55] that doesn't change here tonight we as
[1:04:58] God's people no matter how difficult
[1:05:01] things might be around us no matter what
[1:05:03] kind of conditions might be in our own
[1:05:05] lives or our bodies or families or
[1:05:08] churches or places of employment amen
[1:05:10] our school system our government uh uh
[1:05:13] uh uh structuring in the way that
[1:05:14] everything fits together amen it doesn't
[1:05:17] matter how evil they get it don't matter
[1:05:19] how down on the people of God they get
[1:05:21] how down on Church they might get Amen
[1:05:24] brother about told us they'll never ever
[1:05:26] shut us up God will take us out of here
[1:05:28] amen for there's a Rapture and a
[1:05:30] resurrection down the road a little
[1:05:31] while amen and if it's all right with
[1:05:33] you I plan on joining that number When
[1:05:36] the Saints Go Marching In amen and I
[1:05:38] want to tell you tonight that God's word
[1:05:41] lays out the pattern for every
[1:05:43] difficulty we're ever going to go
[1:05:44] through amen any problem that we'll ever
[1:05:47] face any issue that'll ever come up in
[1:05:49] our life somewhere in this blessed old
[1:05:52] book right here is a pattern an example
[1:05:55] of somebody that's gone through
[1:05:56] something similar to what you've gone
[1:05:58] through if not exactly amen and every
[1:06:01] time our God is a PR a help a present
[1:06:04] help in the time of trouble amen and
[1:06:07] whether you're white or black red or
[1:06:09] green or purple or whatever you might be
[1:06:11] man or woman African American Canadian
[1:06:15] amen Our God don't discriminate amen he
[1:06:18] honors faith and if you believe him like
[1:06:20] they did he can be the same to you that
[1:06:23] he was to them back then the Bible
[1:06:26] always has the pattern we always follow
[1:06:28] the pattern of the scripture because
[1:06:30] Christ brother bam told us hid himself
[1:06:33] in the pages of those Li of the of the
[1:06:35] Bible and the lives of the people that
[1:06:37] they wrote about you take for example
[1:06:39] The Book of Ruth four little small
[1:06:42] chapters amen from the outside looking
[1:06:44] in it's just a boy that fell in love
[1:06:46] with a girl and a girl that fell in love
[1:06:48] with a boy amen it ain't no different
[1:06:50] than any romantic uh uh uh television
[1:06:52] show or book that somebody might read
[1:06:55] and that way amen from the outside
[1:06:57] looking in it's just a common everyday
[1:06:59] occurrence but brother bam told us that
[1:07:02] Christ would hide himself in the lives
[1:07:04] of these people amen and in four little
[1:07:07] old chapters amen Ruth or Boaz or Naomi
[1:07:10] or Ora or none of them probably had any
[1:07:13] idea what it was that they were doing
[1:07:15] they probably had no understanding as to
[1:07:17] what was taking place amen but right
[1:07:19] there in them four chapters we have
[1:07:21] everything from justification to
[1:07:23] sanctification to the baptism of the the
[1:07:25] Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost himself
[1:07:27] we've got the Harvest Time the Gathering
[1:07:29] time the goodbye kiss god with the
[1:07:31] Orthodox Jews god with the 144,000 amen
[1:07:35] the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:07:37] Redemption to the bride of Christ seven
[1:07:39] Church ages all of that laying right
[1:07:42] just in them four little chapters amen
[1:07:45] why God hid himself in the lives of
[1:07:47] these people Amen brother R said in
[1:07:49] Christ The Mystery of God revealed if
[1:07:51] you go into the Bible and you can't see
[1:07:53] Christ in every page go back and read it
[1:07:55] again why he's hiding there somewhere
[1:07:58] Amen brother God see somewhere inside
[1:08:00] that word is Christ laying in there and
[1:08:03] I used to wonder to myself how could the
[1:08:05] Lord be hiding in all of those uh be
[1:08:08] able beat toab and the dubab be a hobab
[1:08:13] and all these other guys and I would
[1:08:14] think what how's Christ hiding in that
[1:08:17] amen and one day I was reading the Bible
[1:08:18] and I came up on the genealogy and the
[1:08:21] Holy Spirit said to me what are you
[1:08:22] looking at amen I said I'm looking at a
[1:08:24] family lineage he said that's right amen
[1:08:27] am I not also a father do I not also
[1:08:29] have many sons and daughters amen did I
[1:08:32] not send Jesus to this world that by one
[1:08:34] son I could bring many sons and many
[1:08:37] daughters into existence amen he even
[1:08:40] hides himself in the genealogies of many
[1:08:43] names we can't even
[1:08:44] pronounce amen but yet he's hiding right
[1:08:47] there in the pages of the word can you
[1:08:48] say amen amen and don't forget
[1:08:51] everything that we see in the Bible is
[1:08:54] inspired of God Paul told Timothy the
[1:08:57] entire word of God inspired again in
[1:09:00] Hebrews holy men of old spake was they
[1:09:03] moved on by the Holy Ghost entire Bible
[1:09:05] from Genesis Revelation amen is the
[1:09:08] mystery of God it is the the the very
[1:09:11] purpose of God Amen hid in the lives of
[1:09:14] human beings you know and I find it
[1:09:16] amazing that when we come to this hiding
[1:09:19] of the spirit of God in the lives of the
[1:09:22] fleshly Tabernacles some of the stories
[1:09:25] that we get out of this you would think
[1:09:27] that if the Lord was going to hide
[1:09:28] himself in a story he picked the great
[1:09:31] great great of the great warriors and
[1:09:33] the conquerors and the great uh
[1:09:35] pronounced ones of the world and look
[1:09:37] around for the wonderful ones and all of
[1:09:39] the smart and the intellectual ones but
[1:09:41] ain't know how God does things cuz
[1:09:43] brother already told us that God hides
[1:09:45] himself and he reveals himself in the
[1:09:48] Simplicity of this life in this world
[1:09:51] Amen in other words what I'm trying to
[1:09:52] say to you is that the Holy Ghost man
[1:09:55] hid himself in some of the worst
[1:09:59] cases in the broken cases come on you
[1:10:02] ain't fig how to say amen I know amen
[1:10:05] hid himself in the disasters and the
[1:10:07] train wrecks amen and the shipwrecks and
[1:10:09] all of the broken lives and all the
[1:10:11] broken material amen because All Things
[1:10:14] Are Made Beautiful In God's Time can you
[1:10:17] say Amen the Holy Ghost knows how to
[1:10:20] hide himself in all of these things and
[1:10:23] he shows his Beauty through all of the
[1:10:24] Brokenness of the world I'll tell you
[1:10:26] one thing for sure no matter how broken
[1:10:28] you might get Christ might be hiding in
[1:10:30] that Brokenness no matter how much
[1:10:33] disaster might be in the family or how
[1:10:35] much turmoil might be right there in the
[1:10:36] church or what kind of tension might be
[1:10:39] around your place of business don't
[1:10:41] forget it's in those things those things
[1:10:43] Brother D that God hides himself in amen
[1:10:46] I learned a long time ago as a Son of
[1:10:48] God As a Christian not to get excited
[1:10:50] when things start going wrong Amen to
[1:10:53] settle down a little bit cuz the Holy
[1:10:55] Spirit hides himself in those things
[1:10:57] amen I was reading the other day to a
[1:10:58] little assembly where brother am said
[1:11:00] God's the one that brings tension in the
[1:11:02] church God's the one that permits
[1:11:04] disasters God's the one that permits
[1:11:06] turmoil and bankruptcies and all these
[1:11:08] other things like that amen you think
[1:11:10] maybe that job Hallelujah that somebody
[1:11:13] said well you just ain't going to work
[1:11:14] here no more you were so upset and
[1:11:16] distraught about it amen but you don't
[1:11:18] realize in that Brokenness that God had
[1:11:20] a different path for you to follow and
[1:11:22] through all of that the blessings of God
[1:11:24] would come with it
[1:11:26] he always hides himself in the
[1:11:28] Brokenness of people as our story opens
[1:11:31] up tonight amen right in the king's
[1:11:33] Palace King David we see a such a case
[1:11:37] as this in this boy
[1:11:39] mblf and we know that this boy's life
[1:11:43] was something that many might have just
[1:11:45] read well that was a nice thing for
[1:11:47] David to do but actually what you can
[1:11:50] see here is a type of you and I and a
[1:11:54] type if you understand understand what a
[1:11:55] type is amen it's a story of someone's
[1:11:58] life that patterns the same as yours
[1:12:00] down here you can see parallels and
[1:12:03] equalities between what you read in the
[1:12:05] Old Testament the New Testament to what
[1:12:07] you see way on up up yonder here in the
[1:12:09] 21st century I can look back at some of
[1:12:12] David's situations amen and some of the
[1:12:14] very same things he went through in his
[1:12:16] mind his Spirit his body out there in
[1:12:18] the kingdom and what more I can see the
[1:12:20] same things taking place in schools in
[1:12:23] homes and everything else a why because
[1:12:26] somewhere in The Human Experience amen
[1:12:29] there's always going to be Brokenness in
[1:12:31] there God through Brokenness knows how
[1:12:34] to bring it out to make a beautiful
[1:12:37] picture you know what I love about this
[1:12:39] story of this boy is that when you look
[1:12:42] at the background of how this all
[1:12:45] transpired David as we know was taken
[1:12:47] from the Sheep coat he was a nobody God
[1:12:50] trained him the man said under a
[1:12:52] different atmosphere from the rest of
[1:12:53] his brothers so what he happened to be
[1:12:55] bringing amen the foods and the things
[1:12:57] in or whatever it might have been and he
[1:12:59] happened to be uh uh walking along a
[1:13:02] pathway perhaps and he hears the
[1:13:04] boasting from Goliath you see David
[1:13:06] hadn't been under the pressures of those
[1:13:08] armies those Israelites had lost so many
[1:13:11] battles to them Philistines that they
[1:13:13] were scared to death that this would
[1:13:14] wipe them out but David who had never
[1:13:17] experienced any of those things he' just
[1:13:19] been on the back side of the desert with
[1:13:21] his heart playing Thou shalt not and
[1:13:23] amen and the Lord Lay Me Down and Green
[1:13:26] Pastures and valleys of Shadows and he
[1:13:28] was singing These gospel songs back
[1:13:30] there amen probably David a little bitty
[1:13:32] guy probably had a little bit of piano
[1:13:34] to go along with him amen hallelujah but
[1:13:36] anyways David was a man that had the
[1:13:39] ability to so obey the Lord that when
[1:13:42] the anointing of the Holy Ghost would
[1:13:44] come upon him and a bear a lion would
[1:13:46] come after one of his father's Sheep
[1:13:48] amen he didn't fear what could happen to
[1:13:50] those uh uh those sheep he didn't fear
[1:13:52] what could happen to himself amen
[1:13:54] because God was bigger than all of it
[1:13:57] amen and when he come walking along and
[1:13:59] he saw this great big Goliath standing
[1:14:01] there amen he had eyeballs this big
[1:14:03] around I mean that guy's head must have
[1:14:05] been as big as a washtub amen but he
[1:14:08] wasn't looking at the size of Goliath he
[1:14:11] was looking at the size of his God that
[1:14:13] filled all space Time and
[1:14:16] Eternity knowing that he was able to
[1:14:18] deliver a lion and a bear amen and that
[1:14:21] uncircumcised Philistine would be
[1:14:23] nothing different amen but jealous said
[1:14:25] into the kingdom Saul who always wanted
[1:14:28] the spotlight always was the Big Man on
[1:14:30] Campus and wanted everybody to see how
[1:14:32] spiritual he was and always was
[1:14:34] promoting himself and things of that
[1:14:36] nature amen God had anointed this little
[1:14:38] Ruddy mama's boy to come take it over
[1:14:40] from him amen and like any man that's in
[1:14:43] power that don't want to lose his power
[1:14:45] he starts getting jealous and attacking
[1:14:47] amen and as David suffered through
[1:14:49] Saul's persecution the javelins and the
[1:14:52] backbiting and the and the name saying
[1:14:55] and all watching Saul go through that
[1:14:57] almost what we would call today a
[1:14:58] bipolar type personality Love David
[1:15:01] today hated him tomorrow best friend
[1:15:03] today he was a miserable enemy the next
[1:15:05] day amen just back and forth and the the
[1:15:08] the turmoil amen and the pressure that
[1:15:11] would must have been waged upon David's
[1:15:13] mind the very thing that he must have
[1:15:15] had to endure emotionally with a man he
[1:15:17] loved and respected Amen to think that
[1:15:20] that fell would treat him so
[1:15:22] scandalously and and ridicule him and
[1:15:24] and bash out every accomplishment he
[1:15:26] ever made amen and turn right around in
[1:15:28] the same breath and praise him and talk
[1:15:30] about how great he
[1:15:32] was the world today would have called
[1:15:34] Saul crazy but don't say that to David
[1:15:37] because David was a man that knew his
[1:15:39] office as a anointed king was something
[1:15:42] that God permitted and David would have
[1:15:44] stood by that office and even slayed
[1:15:46] someone when he found out what they had
[1:15:48] done to Saul and how they behave with
[1:15:50] Saul he had such respect for this man
[1:15:53] that when he was in the cave and cut a
[1:15:55] piece of His Garment his heart smot him
[1:15:57] that's how much respect and love that
[1:15:59] David carried for this old
[1:16:01] man he had such a feeling toward him
[1:16:05] that no matter what evil Saul may have
[1:16:07] said when he got in his presence he
[1:16:09] bowed himself and called himself a
[1:16:11] dog you understand how little David made
[1:16:15] himself in the Bible in the Old
[1:16:17] Testament the dog was the Lost thing
[1:16:19] that could have been spoke of nothing
[1:16:21] against your Pooch but we're talking
[1:16:23] Bible now not your home home address
[1:16:25] but you understand that you wer even
[1:16:27] allowed to receive tithing off of an
[1:16:29] animal such as that it was considered a
[1:16:31] a low thing in the Bible and yet here
[1:16:34] David would come before Saul and call
[1:16:36] himself a flea call himself a dog humble
[1:16:39] himself to the very man that would have
[1:16:41] taken his life had David yielded himself
[1:16:43] to it and God not protected him that's
[1:16:45] right now here we are many years later
[1:16:49] after he has bound his soul to
[1:16:52] Jonathan his beloved friend of whom they
[1:16:55] had such a Booz and
[1:16:57] relationship they said the Bible said
[1:16:59] even their souls were knit
[1:17:01] together you understand that when Saul
[1:17:05] and Jonathan now have gone off the scene
[1:17:08] this boy remaining mblf the nursea grabs
[1:17:12] him and tries to flee out when she does
[1:17:15] as anyone would in haste she made an
[1:17:18] error and she drops this boy and he
[1:17:21] falls on his feet and it makes him lame
[1:17:23] said the Bible MF was
[1:17:26] a was a creature that probably many
[1:17:30] looked at scandalously in some
[1:17:33] way if you've ever had anybody in your
[1:17:35] family that's ever had disabilities you
[1:17:37] know intimately how people treat people
[1:17:40] with with some kind of disability or uh
[1:17:44] some kind of inadequacy in their mind or
[1:17:46] something like that my my wife Samantha
[1:17:49] her brother Chris had a fetal stroke
[1:17:52] when they was using the forceps to pull
[1:17:53] him from the womb and the the the forcep
[1:17:56] the metal of it squished a little nerve
[1:17:59] or place right there on his head caused
[1:18:00] him to have a fetal stroke and you can
[1:18:02] see people that have this same behavior
[1:18:04] it's happened many many times especially
[1:18:06] back in our time in the 70s amen and
[1:18:08] it's uh it's his right arm and his foot
[1:18:11] he's got kind of a little limp like this
[1:18:13] and and and his arm is drawn like that
[1:18:15] now that left arm of his is strong as a
[1:18:18] tree trunk don't ever try to arm wrestle
[1:18:19] let me break your arm but that right arm
[1:18:22] is as deformed as it can be it's always
[1:18:24] is in a constant state like that right
[1:18:26] there and he's got a little limp in that
[1:18:28] foot from where that side was affected
[1:18:29] from the stroke and all the years I've
[1:18:31] known Chris past 20 almost 30 years now
[1:18:35] and uh probably even a little longer
[1:18:36] than that Troy told since we were boys
[1:18:38] people have always made fun of him
[1:18:40] treated him like a second class citizen
[1:18:42] showed pity on him when they shouldn't
[1:18:44] have showed pity on him always treated
[1:18:45] him like something you know wasn't
[1:18:47] always just exactly normal and there was
[1:18:50] behave like that you could look at a boy
[1:18:52] and see he's got a problem but they
[1:18:53] treated him in that way
[1:18:55] Samantha learned at a young age how to
[1:18:57] defend herself against bullies and
[1:18:59] things like that because when they would
[1:19:00] jump on Chris they had little 4 foot one
[1:19:03] to fight and she'll buy your kneecaps
[1:19:05] don't you think she won over that
[1:19:06] brother of hers she would stand up for
[1:19:09] him and fight and argue and scratch and
[1:19:11] carry on that's my brother you leave him
[1:19:12] alone she stood up for him amen but
[1:19:15] people always treated him like something
[1:19:17] you know education and things like that
[1:19:20] he could have done anything he wanted to
[1:19:21] do as far as his mind goes he's got a
[1:19:24] sharp mind but he was just handicapped
[1:19:26] where he couldn't do everything
[1:19:27] physically the same as the other boys
[1:19:29] but he loved football and he loved
[1:19:30] basketball and he loved them other kind
[1:19:32] of things and you know he get out there
[1:19:33] and he bounce the ball and try to shoot
[1:19:35] it and they'd make fun of him when he'd
[1:19:36] miss it amen while they're two good
[1:19:38] strong arms and legs just running up to
[1:19:40] the hoop and jumping and spinning and
[1:19:41] carrying on amen he suffered like that
[1:19:44] all of his days well in my mind I think
[1:19:46] of what myef may have had to suffer how
[1:19:49] people must have looked down upon him
[1:19:51] how they must have treated him and and
[1:19:53] and looked on him like you know maybe
[1:19:54] sitting around the dinner table you know
[1:19:56] that boy I feel so sorry for that kid
[1:19:59] all the things you know why don't they
[1:20:01] put him in a home or a nursing home or
[1:20:03] assisted living or just get there just a
[1:20:05] burden on everybody you know and that
[1:20:07] nursaid I heard about her let me tell
[1:20:09] you one thing she's a little old cuty
[1:20:11] thing anyways and fooled around dropped
[1:20:14] the kid can you believe that so had
[1:20:16] scandal from the very moment Not only
[1:20:19] was he lame at his feet but remember the
[1:20:21] reputation he was carrying came from
[1:20:23] what happened with Saul and the way that
[1:20:25] Saul went out of the Kingdom now David
[1:20:27] is Anointed to be the Son and the
[1:20:30] servant of God to rule over Israel and
[1:20:33] imagine now David with his love hiding
[1:20:36] in his heart wanting to do something for
[1:20:38] the kingdom of God Amen the Holy Ghost
[1:20:41] places upon his heart this little old
[1:20:44] crippled up twisted up
[1:20:47] MF I want you to understand something a
[1:20:50] lot of times when we come up to this
[1:20:52] altar right here we get in it on mind
[1:20:55] when we come up here that
[1:20:58] perhaps God is looking at us like we
[1:21:02] think maybe David was looking at him
[1:21:05] listen to me
[1:21:06] now in some cases we think that maybe
[1:21:09] David was looking down upon MF feeling
[1:21:11] sorry for him treating him almost as if
[1:21:14] well he's a poor crippled up thing and
[1:21:17] I'm a king so I can do something for
[1:21:18] this boy and often we think when we come
[1:21:21] to the altar before God we think the
[1:21:23] Lord does something for us because he's
[1:21:24] feeling sorry for us and he's taking
[1:21:27] pity on us because we're just these poor
[1:21:29] little old
[1:21:30] creatures but if you can look at this
[1:21:32] tonight Through The Eyes of David and
[1:21:35] you see that right you're going to be
[1:21:37] able to look through the eyes of God at
[1:21:38] yourself tonight and see that right
[1:21:41] too because whenever he takes this boy
[1:21:43] and puts him in his
[1:21:45] presence David was not looking at this
[1:21:48] boy in his crippled up condition David
[1:21:51] was not focusing upon his back around or
[1:21:54] who his family was not the ills and the
[1:21:58] wrongs of it I mean David wasn't
[1:22:01] focusing upon that boy and saying well
[1:22:04] look at what a sad condition you know
[1:22:06] history tells us he lived in a city
[1:22:08] called Lo
[1:22:09] dear we've all been in that place low
[1:22:15] debar the very City's name itself means
[1:22:18] a
[1:22:19] lacking
[1:22:21] insufficient and even this boy's name a
[1:22:24] fiish Chef the very meaning of his
[1:22:26] name is a breathing
[1:22:30] shame not only does his name represents
[1:22:33] shame in his character does a name
[1:22:36] represents something not only is his
[1:22:38] legs all crippled up and he lives in a
[1:22:41] city of lack low de bar we've all passed
[1:22:44] through there I think I'm the mayor of
[1:22:45] it sometimes I go back for for weekly
[1:22:48] visits and
[1:22:50] occasions as he goes into this place
[1:22:53] before the king's Palace and how he got
[1:22:56] there maybe we don't know exactly did
[1:22:58] they they wheel him in somehow or
[1:22:59] another amen or somebody carry him in or
[1:23:02] was he able to walk but he had kind of a
[1:23:04] his gate was kind of a little slanted
[1:23:06] hilted type
[1:23:08] thing but when he comes before the king
[1:23:11] listen to his words if you go and read
[1:23:12] the verse right after that will we stop
[1:23:15] verse eight I think it
[1:23:17] was MF gets down before David like
[1:23:21] this and calls himself a dog
[1:23:27] and I
[1:23:28] wonder if a thought didn't go through
[1:23:30] David's mind when he hears those that
[1:23:34] word looking at that boy he had every
[1:23:37] right humanly speaking now's my time to
[1:23:40] take Vengeance on the house of
[1:23:42] Saul if I wanted to show my anger and
[1:23:45] show how hurt I've been through the
[1:23:47] years and show that person I didn't
[1:23:50] deserve to be treated that way and now's
[1:23:52] my chance to get even with you
[1:23:57] but David didn't have that kind of heart
[1:23:59] in
[1:24:00] him because as he looked down at maef
[1:24:03] calling himself a dog he remembered
[1:24:05] something you know what he remembered
[1:24:08] this boy sees himself this way but that
[1:24:11] is the son of Saul that is the that is
[1:24:14] the grandson of Saul that is the son of
[1:24:16] Jonathan Royal Blood is flowing through
[1:24:19] his
[1:24:21] veins crippled up as he may be by the
[1:24:23] Coss twisted up as he may be living in a
[1:24:27] society in a world that is miserable
[1:24:29] around him living with scars living with
[1:24:32] with with all kinds of problems and is
[1:24:35] anybody hear me tonight living with all
[1:24:38] of the mess that he's living with no
[1:24:41] matter what that boy might be going
[1:24:43] through if he can only understand he is
[1:24:46] a king
[1:24:49] son Royal Blood is flowing through his
[1:24:53] veins he is the grandson of King Saul
[1:24:56] the anointed of God and that anointing
[1:24:59] is in his
[1:25:01] family and had Jonathan lived long
[1:25:04] enough he would have been King but
[1:25:06] because he didn't now here's MF this is
[1:25:08] the only blood
[1:25:10] lineage that is left in Saul's Kingdom
[1:25:13] so David didn't look down at that boy
[1:25:15] and say to himself ah here's my
[1:25:18] chance yes like some people do when they
[1:25:21] face abusers that's right when they face
[1:25:23] other ones that have done them evil
[1:25:25] through the years and uh uh molesters
[1:25:27] and and liars and adulterers and you
[1:25:30] know marriages and things when husbands
[1:25:32] have stepped out wives have stepped out
[1:25:34] amen that guy comes back and repents or
[1:25:36] she comes back and repent amen and they
[1:25:38] take that attitude like we think that
[1:25:40] maybe somebody would do with this boy
[1:25:42] here and say oh now's my chance now I'm
[1:25:44] going to get even with you now I'm going
[1:25:45] to show you what it feels like amen but
[1:25:48] you understand that's not the spirit of
[1:25:49] Christ but in this scenario we read
[1:25:52] about here tonight the spirit of Christ
[1:25:53] was fighting in David the spirit of
[1:25:56] Christ was in this man and as he looked
[1:25:58] at that boy in his condition maybe he
[1:26:01] might have said something like this MF
[1:26:04] you don't see who you are but I
[1:26:07] do oh Hallelujah the same thing that God
[1:26:11] may look at you and I in the same way
[1:26:13] all of our twisted up complexes all of
[1:26:17] our scars all of the abuses all of the
[1:26:20] bad experiences we've ever had we might
[1:26:22] come before God and s nothing but a doll
[1:26:26] but if Jesus could talk to us tonight he
[1:26:28] might say you might see yourself that
[1:26:31] way but I
[1:26:33] don't you are a king son roal blood is
[1:26:38] flying through your
[1:26:43] veins you don't live in L the bar
[1:26:46] anymore
[1:26:48] Mya he said as long as I live and as
[1:26:51] long as the Lord will permit me in other
[1:26:53] words will say language he said you have
[1:26:56] a special seat right here at my
[1:26:59] table thank you Hallelujah glory to God
[1:27:04] and all the days of his life this boy
[1:27:06] received the blessings of God I want you
[1:27:08] to understand I don't care how crippled
[1:27:10] up things may look around you are you
[1:27:12] listening to me I don't care how bad
[1:27:14] things might look I don't care how awful
[1:27:16] the scenario might be around you I don't
[1:27:18] care how low that bank account's going I
[1:27:20] don't care how poorly that car is doing
[1:27:22] out there I don't care how wed them
[1:27:24] children grandchildren are I don't care
[1:27:26] how much your lost loved ones might be
[1:27:27] running Here There and Everywhere amen I
[1:27:30] don't care how crippled up they are
[1:27:32] Jesus said no man can come to the father
[1:27:34] except I draw him first or you just keep
[1:27:37] hanging on because one day King David is
[1:27:41] going to call MF into his
[1:27:45] presence hallelujah amen amen amen he'll
[1:27:49] call him into my presence he said I draw
[1:27:52] all man unto me if I he lifted up I'll
[1:27:55] draw all man unto me and I'll call him
[1:27:58] into my presence and I'll bless him and
[1:28:01] how did he bless this boy with an
[1:28:04] identity he gave him a new identity from
[1:28:08] what he used to have remember that when
[1:28:11] he lived in this place this lar without
[1:28:15] pasture life of lack he lived in a place
[1:28:19] without a
[1:28:21] pasture no Shepherd in there neither
[1:28:24] cuz that's usually where the Shepherds
[1:28:26] hide is in the
[1:28:28] pastures no one to guide him no one to
[1:28:30] instruct him I wonder if that's not
[1:28:33] what's happening around the message of
[1:28:35] the hour so many people are being swept
[1:28:37] up in all of the crippling attitudes and
[1:28:40] the crippling doctrines and the
[1:28:41] crippling leadership of the day amen and
[1:28:44] preachers are like this wet nurse making
[1:28:45] haste and running from one thing to
[1:28:47] another instead of selling down on the
[1:28:50] word of God and saying what the prophet
[1:28:52] said and saying what the Bible said and
[1:28:54] telling the people the truth they've sat
[1:28:56] on and run around with every little old
[1:28:58] thing until they've crippled their
[1:29:00] entire churches up until they can't even
[1:29:02] walk spiritually and stand on their own
[1:29:04] two
[1:29:05] feet makes me wonder how many
[1:29:09] nurses in this late hour have dropped
[1:29:11] the sons of God and the daughters of God
[1:29:14] cause lameness because of their spirit
[1:29:17] and their attitude doesn't have to be
[1:29:18] just preachers it could be people in the
[1:29:20] church as well you see your attitude
[1:29:22] toward one another could make a big
[1:29:24] difference to where somebody feels
[1:29:25] comfortable here tonight amen if you're
[1:29:27] side ey am all the time or not shaking
[1:29:30] their hand or walking way around to get
[1:29:31] around them amen people pick up on
[1:29:33] things you can't Bluff Humanity amen and
[1:29:36] if you've got a problem somewhere or
[1:29:37] another they're going to pick up on that
[1:29:39] amen and you don't realize what you're
[1:29:40] doing but you're dropping causing
[1:29:43] lameness amen and God will require every
[1:29:45] bit of it at the day of judgment if we
[1:29:47] don't repent of it that's why we got to
[1:29:49] keep our hearts right our spirit right
[1:29:52] everything about us keep it right if we
[1:29:54] mess up make it right repent for it keep
[1:29:56] it right but here this boy imagine his
[1:30:00] name the mouth of Shame a breathing
[1:30:03] shame but
[1:30:06] notice the thing that caused maef to be
[1:30:09] is he
[1:30:12] was was because of a
[1:30:17] fall the fall is what made him like he
[1:30:21] was some of you getting it
[1:30:26] the fall was the reason that he became
[1:30:28] lame the fall was the reason that he
[1:30:30] lived in L dear the fall was a reason
[1:30:33] that he didn't take the throne like he
[1:30:35] should
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:39] have brother says we bypassed all
[1:30:42] theophany to come to this thing to be
[1:30:45] tempted and tried right you mean to tell
[1:30:48] me that I was supposed to come directly
[1:30:49] to a throne and wound up in this
[1:30:54] yeah wow and everyone that takes the
[1:30:56] breath of life becomes just like my
[1:31:00] FF a breathing
[1:31:03] shame these little youngans as much as
[1:31:05] you love them as much as you care for
[1:31:07] them they're
[1:31:08] precious but let their life just
[1:31:11] continue into the world let their life
[1:31:13] continue on they become a breathing
[1:31:15] shame that is if God don't get a hold of
[1:31:17] them if God's hand of Mercy isn't on
[1:31:20] them every person that takes the breath
[1:31:21] of life becomes a breathing shame in in
[1:31:24] this world the fallou is what put that
[1:31:26] Identity On Us the fou is what put us in
[1:31:29] loab bar the foul is what put us in the
[1:31:32] condition we are
[1:31:35] today the Fall In the Garden of Eden
[1:31:38] placed every one of us in this condition
[1:31:40] to where that our whole life without
[1:31:42] Jesus is a breathing
[1:31:45] shame you might be successful as
[1:31:48] successful can be by World standards
[1:31:50] without without Christ there's no
[1:31:52] success in it whatsoever am cuz I'll
[1:31:55] tell you one thing I've I've seen many a
[1:31:57] funeral I've never seen anybody with
[1:31:58] U-Hauls coming down the road amen nobody
[1:32:01] with Pinsky trucks and and and and
[1:32:03] moving characters and whoever else your
[1:32:05] guys are here in Canada amen they don't
[1:32:07] take it to the Grave with
[1:32:09] them well don't thing they got is
[1:32:11] whatever character they come to this
[1:32:12] world with and whatever they
[1:32:15] leave and notice this boy Falls at
[1:32:18] David's feet I'm a
[1:32:20] dog of course he saw himself as a loser
[1:32:25] not as one that could be identified as a
[1:32:28] king he could not identify himself with
[1:32:32] his true identity are you listening to
[1:32:35] me he saw himself based upon his
[1:32:40] handicap not upon who he
[1:32:43] was oh my God my God my
[1:32:46] God how many of us have done the very
[1:32:49] same thing sitting right here tonight
[1:32:51] instead basing all of our faith and our
[1:32:54] promises and our victories and our
[1:32:55] deliverances and the overcoming upon who
[1:32:59] God made us when he gave us the baptism
[1:33:01] of the Holy Ghost we have always based
[1:33:03] it upon some little handicap in our life
[1:33:06] I hear people say it all the time
[1:33:08] brother J I would but I would but I
[1:33:11] could if I maybe sort of kind of God's
[1:33:14] holy ghost come to take all of that out
[1:33:15] of
[1:33:17] us we should not be identifying ourself
[1:33:20] by the weaknesses of this flesh cuz Paul
[1:33:23] said when I'm weak Thou Art
[1:33:26] strong
[1:33:27] Hallelujah I can trust that the Lord
[1:33:30] Jesus is going to raise me up to be a
[1:33:32] conqueror Raise Me Up to be an overcomer
[1:33:35] Raise Me
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:39] Up not because of the shortcomings of
[1:33:42] this but because of who I am in his
[1:33:45] sight I'm royalty I'm a King's son his
[1:33:50] blood flows through my veins and if I
[1:33:52] can see it in the right Spirit and the
[1:33:54] right light then I will not see myself
[1:33:56] as a dog the lowest thing that could
[1:33:58] ever be but I'd see myself in a proper
[1:34:02] identity amen now let's look at a couple
[1:34:05] scriptures for a moment in Exodus
[1:34:09] 30:1 praise the Lord
[1:34:12] Jesus I want you to notice we're going
[1:34:15] to change the scene for just a little
[1:34:17] bit and bring this down to all
[1:34:22] Israel notice and Exodus
[1:34:25] 30:10 and Aaron shall make an atonement
[1:34:27] upon the horns of it once in a year the
[1:34:30] blood of the sin offering of
[1:34:32] atonements once in a year shall he make
[1:34:35] atonement upon it throughout your
[1:34:37] Generations it is most holy unto the
[1:34:40] Lord now I want you to notice that
[1:34:43] Christ is the principal theme of The
[1:34:46] Bible amen but
[1:34:49] Redemption is the
[1:34:51] story that tells that theme
[1:34:55] Christ without you there's no
[1:34:59] story not only are we a part of the
[1:35:02] Great Plan of
[1:35:03] Redemption but it is the primary goal of
[1:35:06] Christ
[1:35:08] glory to bring God and man together amen
[1:35:12] that's right and make them
[1:35:15] one in order to do this he had to set
[1:35:19] forth the proper
[1:35:22] types set the stage if you will for what
[1:35:26] would come later
[1:35:29] on now Israel every place that Abraham
[1:35:32] put his foot on whether he realize it or
[1:35:35] not he was outlining and drawing the
[1:35:38] border of what would later be known as
[1:35:41] Palestine
[1:35:43] Israel as he walked and walked and
[1:35:45] walked and walked and
[1:35:47] walked that little posted stamp of a
[1:35:49] country over there there wasn't a person
[1:35:52] that ever moved in into it but what God
[1:35:54] didn't give him everything that was in
[1:35:56] it from the north to the South to the
[1:35:58] east to the West it was all an absolute
[1:36:02] complete inheritance of any true
[1:36:04] Israelite circumcised on the eth day
[1:36:07] walking in the law of
[1:36:09] Moses god set this up for
[1:36:13] them so that when it would come time for
[1:36:17] them to present themsel before
[1:36:20] God even the animals had a sign ific an
[1:36:24] in this Plan of
[1:36:26] Redemption all animals don't mean
[1:36:28] nothing hold on Moses told Pharaoh not
[1:36:31] one hoof is going to be left behind when
[1:36:33] we go out of
[1:36:34] here amen God so wanted the inheritance
[1:36:38] to be that all would represent the great
[1:36:43] kingdom of
[1:36:45] God you say but there's an animal matter
[1:36:48] well I'll ask this we could ask brother
[1:36:49] Ram about that when God translated him
[1:36:53] beyond the curtain of time he found a
[1:36:55] little wet nose poking at his hand he
[1:36:57] looked around there was his
[1:36:59] horse he looked down a little bit and
[1:37:01] there was his dog amen right there beond
[1:37:04] the curtain of time that's when he said
[1:37:05] everything that ever loved you and
[1:37:06] everything you ever loved would be right
[1:37:08] here amen God created the animals for a
[1:37:12] purpose they represented something right
[1:37:16] and we know that the Lamb of God the
[1:37:18] atonement of the Lamb represented the
[1:37:21] Lamb of God from the foundation into the
[1:37:24] world but notice this one
[1:37:27] lamb when they would take it into the
[1:37:31] sanctuary all throughout
[1:37:33] Israel there have been Lambs that wasn't
[1:37:36] qualified to be the
[1:37:39] sacrifice some of them might be blind
[1:37:41] some might be hauled and withered some
[1:37:44] might have disease in the case of the
[1:37:46] red heer there might be some little
[1:37:47] white hairs somewhere upon the animal's
[1:37:50] skin the red heer had to be perfectly
[1:37:53] red where and those priests would check
[1:37:55] every little scripture in the Bible to
[1:37:57] make sure it Jed or
[1:38:00] cooperated everything had to fall in
[1:38:02] this proper
[1:38:04] place no matter what kind of crosseyed
[1:38:08] condition the other animals might have
[1:38:10] been in once a year there was one
[1:38:14] perfect lamb that was taken behind the
[1:38:16] sanctuary and that perfect lamb brother
[1:38:19] J he represented that lamb dying
[1:38:22] represented the atonement for all the
[1:38:24] rest of them crippled up blind Hal
[1:38:26] wither imp perfect impure animals in
[1:38:32] Israel brother B tells a story about
[1:38:36] this little donkey I don't know if
[1:38:37] you've ever heard about this but he said
[1:38:40] being a farmer he said a mule is no good
[1:38:42] he's crosseyed his knees aren't together
[1:38:46] his tail sticks straight in the air is
[1:38:47] the horriblest looking sight you've ever
[1:38:49] seen I preached to some people like that
[1:38:51] actually
[1:38:53] you get in some certain circles
[1:38:55] preaching the gospel and say something
[1:38:56] they don't like they just go PL crossy
[1:38:58] on you right there amen and then
[1:39:01] whenever I got to look into at that tail
[1:39:03] sticking straight up in the I thought
[1:39:04] yeah I've seen them get their F feathers
[1:39:06] ruffled a few times amen like an animal
[1:39:09] stick their tail up when they get
[1:39:10] aggravated about something I've seen him
[1:39:11] do that
[1:39:13] too but then he tells the story about he
[1:39:17] said if this little fell could look
[1:39:20] around he said thanking if he could
[1:39:22] speak the Master will never let me live
[1:39:25] when he comes
[1:39:27] home he'll knock me in the head cuz I
[1:39:30] ain't worth nothing brother said that's
[1:39:32] just about like every one of
[1:39:35] us insert a good amen
[1:39:40] here CU now it's showing exactly you and
[1:39:43] I crippled up crosseyed tail sticking
[1:39:46] There Our Knees aren't together in other
[1:39:48] words we can't run right can't work
[1:39:51] right ain't got no stable foot
[1:39:54] amen everything about us was crippled up
[1:39:57] and
[1:39:58] destroyed the fall put us in that
[1:40:01] condition another message called
[1:40:03] Redeemer Redemption she said but you
[1:40:04] know if the old mother could understand
[1:40:06] and speak back to that little cult and
[1:40:08] say but wait a minute
[1:40:10] son I like them sermons like that when I
[1:40:14] get to think in certain ways about
[1:40:16] myself I like it when the man of God
[1:40:17] comes to the platform and says but wait
[1:40:19] a minute
[1:40:20] son hold on just a minute with the way
[1:40:23] you're thinking he said you were borned
[1:40:25] under a Birthright if she could talk to
[1:40:27] him she'd say the man of the house is
[1:40:29] going to go over to that flock over
[1:40:30] there and get a lamb that is perfect and
[1:40:33] without blemish on it and when that
[1:40:36] perfect lamb dies it'll die so the
[1:40:39] disfigured mule can live
[1:40:43] hallelujah oh Hallelujah again brother B
[1:40:46] says what a beautiful picture of
[1:40:49] redemption oh my the perfect Lamb of God
[1:40:53] died that we poor alienated disfigured
[1:40:57] human beings could live again what a
[1:41:00] picture of redemption he says why that
[1:41:04] little mule could kick his little heels
[1:41:06] up in the air and jump around and have a
[1:41:09] big time why he's
[1:41:12] redeemed Oh Glory to God he wasn't able
[1:41:16] to redeem himself he could not meet the
[1:41:19] standard of the word amen he wasn't pure
[1:41:21] enough he wasn't clean enough he didn't
[1:41:24] meet the standard the measuring state of
[1:41:26] being a perfect lamb but there has been
[1:41:29] one that has been offered for that
[1:41:31] disfigured little mule same thing for
[1:41:34] you and I I could never meet the
[1:41:35] standard of this word of God I could
[1:41:37] never live the way the message tells me
[1:41:39] to live but there was one perfect lamb
[1:41:42] Hallelujah that died so this disfigured
[1:41:46] mule could
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:50] live praise be to God
[1:41:53] listen again Leviticus
[1:41:56] 16:34 and this shall be an everlasting
[1:42:01] statute unto you to make an atonement
[1:42:04] for the children of Israel for all their
[1:42:08] sins once in a year and he did as the
[1:42:13] Lord commanded Moses which is an
[1:42:15] interesting thing when you think about
[1:42:17] it
[1:42:17] because there might have been men in the
[1:42:20] world that lived a closer better more
[1:42:23] perfect life than Aaron but here's the
[1:42:25] other side of the type didn't matter
[1:42:28] what kind of person Aaron was he was
[1:42:31] called as a bloodline a Birthright by
[1:42:34] bloodline to be a
[1:42:36] priest amen and there's another side
[1:42:39] that you got to look at God only allowed
[1:42:41] those those Aaron uh the the the sons of
[1:42:43] Aaron those Levites to come right from

[1:46:00] perfect you don't have to be without
[1:46:03] blemish you don't have to be without

[1:46:10] are not being demanded or asked or
[1:46:12] required or suggested even that you've
[1:46:15] got to have everything intact and
[1:46:17] everything just as it needs to be no one
[1:46:20] is asking you to be the perfect L nobody

[1:46:26] up where's it at he's over there in the
[1:46:28] temple see that smoke coming up amen out
[1:46:31] of the Tabernacle over there there's

[1:46:57] without
[1:46:58] blemish for a sin offering one ram
[1:47:02] without blemish for peace
[1:47:05] offerings now I'm sure when a lot of
[1:47:07] people would read this if they were
[1:47:08] trinitarian they would see
[1:47:10] three but when I read it I see
[1:47:13] one I don't see one one for the Ram one
[1:47:16] for the one for the U and or you and
[1:47:20] what one for the for the for the big and
[1:47:22] for the little I see I see one one
[1:47:25] sacrifice one manifested in this in this
[1:47:28] and in this I see one Lord Jesus I see
[1:47:31] one faith I see one baptism I see one
[1:47:35] body One Church one head which is Christ
[1:47:38] overall in all and above all and in you
[1:47:42] all one
[1:47:44] Christ sacrificing for everything he
[1:47:48] said why that little mule could kick his
[1:47:49] heels up and jump around and have a big
[1:47:51] time why he's
[1:47:54] redeemed and yet here we sit and the
[1:47:56] word of God gets preached to us
[1:47:59] sometimes and instead of that we try to
[1:48:02] feel like that maef feeling I'm just a
[1:48:05] dog I'm a loser I'm no good I live in L
[1:48:07] dear a place without a pasture I live in
[1:48:10] a place where I'm a breathing shame my I
[1:48:12] I'm my mouth is a shame my life is a
[1:48:15] shame but myf your problem is you're not
[1:48:18] seeing yourself in the way that David
[1:48:19] sees
[1:48:21] you may they make fun of him and tell
[1:48:24] what a scoundrel he was and maybe MF
[1:48:26] would believe what they said but I got
[1:48:28] news for you MF it doesn't matter what
[1:48:30] they said David's got you on his
[1:48:34] mind don't worry boy in a little while
[1:48:37] the king is going to call you into his
[1:48:40] presence hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:45] hallelujah give it time and he'll call
[1:48:47] you directly into the presence of the
[1:48:49] king let's read now Ephesians chapter 2
[1:48:52] vers 12 now let's look at another
[1:48:55] picture this is a picture of redemption
[1:48:57] for all of us watch here the second
[1:49:00] chapter in the 12th verse that at that
[1:49:03] time ye were without
[1:49:05] Christ being
[1:49:08] aliens this word aliens means to be shut
[1:49:11] out from one's fellowship and
[1:49:14] intimacy So Not only was the Gentiles
[1:49:19] completely shut out of God's Fellowship
[1:49:23] but shut out completely from his
[1:49:25] intimacy now listen to me now the Jews
[1:49:28] were the ones that God dealt with he
[1:49:30] dealt with them as a nation until she
[1:49:32] played the part excuse his sisters of a
[1:49:35] underneath every green tree with
[1:49:36] every Idol with everything and God
[1:49:38] divorced her put her away in divorcement
[1:49:41] and he took him a virgin bride this
[1:49:44] virgin Gentile group would eventually
[1:49:46] come forth from the very roots of
[1:49:48] Pentecost where the Jews would receive
[1:49:50] the holy ghost in the upper room and
[1:49:52] then it would bleed itself as we'd say
[1:49:54] as it go right through the tree and
[1:49:56] bleed itself into the Gentile now
[1:49:58] remember preaching as we look at in the
[1:50:01] morning the Lord willing preaching was
[1:50:02] so important to God that God would not
[1:50:05] allow the Gentiles to even receive the
[1:50:08] Holy Ghost until a preacher went to him
[1:50:10] and preached
[1:50:11] it shame on these tape player people out
[1:50:14] there they say all you do is push play
[1:50:16] and obey God wants Ministry to take this
[1:50:19] message and preach it to the people
[1:50:22] listen to your tapes obey what the
[1:50:24] message says honor brother Bram honor
[1:50:26] his office respect who he was put that
[1:50:29] word in your ear day and night amen but
[1:50:31] never did God intend for a mechanical
[1:50:33] object to replace what's happening here
[1:50:37] tonight Here Comes Simon Peter with the
[1:50:40] keys to the kingdom Paul in his third
[1:50:43] pool he turns from the Jews moves
[1:50:45] himself to the Gentiles at this time we
[1:50:48] were completely imagine this completely
[1:50:51] shut out from intimacy with God
[1:50:54] completely shut out from any fellowship
[1:50:57] with God do you know what a great
[1:50:59] miracle is occurring even here tonight
[1:51:02] where you as you sit here me as I stand
[1:51:05] Here preaching even when you feel that
[1:51:07] that something reverberating back from
[1:51:09] the spirit when you feel that little tug
[1:51:12] in your heart even hear in the scripture
[1:51:14] though you could be as tired as you
[1:51:15] could possibly be be wore out everything
[1:51:17] in the world on your mind yet there's a
[1:51:19] little something that that talks to you
[1:51:21] and you meditate on the word and you
[1:51:23] feel that little bounce back do you not
[1:51:25] understand that was a door that was open
[1:51:28] to the gentile people so that we could
[1:51:30] experience his intimacy and his
[1:51:32] fellowship before that the Gentiles did
[1:51:35] not have that kind of reaction to the
[1:51:37] word we didn't feel what we felt here
[1:51:39] tonight the door was slammed on us but
[1:51:42] God said
[1:51:43] MF it's time for you to have a seat at
[1:51:46] the
[1:51:48] table so God took that little prophet
[1:51:50] and turned him from the Jews and started
[1:51:53] that first church age with 12 people
[1:51:54] mind you the Ephesian Church age was
[1:51:58] solidified in God's first age with 12
[1:52:01] people in it the influence of those men
[1:52:05] oh you know somebody said to me well you
[1:52:08] do know that when brother Brandon wrote
[1:52:09] the church ages out that one of those
[1:52:12] Messengers Martin I think it was wasn't
[1:52:15] even alive during his church
[1:52:17] age and I said you mean to tell me that
[1:52:20] there were people in the church ages
[1:52:23] that received the message of the hour
[1:52:26] and had never saw their messenger or had
[1:52:28] contact with
[1:52:29] him I said boy that's strange to me
[1:52:32] somehow and another I said why I said
[1:52:33] because I was born in 1977 brother bam
[1:52:36] went off the scene in' 65 I've never
[1:52:39] seen nor had contact with my messenger
[1:52:41] and yet through the ministry of those
[1:52:43] that have been Faithfully taught I've
[1:52:45] received the same messages though
[1:52:46] brother Baron preached it to me
[1:52:49] himself woo that was a good one thank
[1:52:51] you Jesus right why because God wanted
[1:52:54] us to not be aliens
[1:52:56] anymore come out of your crippled up
[1:52:59] idolatrous condition you Gentiles and
[1:53:01] come and sit at the king's
[1:53:05] table that's where he broke the bread of
[1:53:07] life to us imagine this brother Jose
[1:53:09] brother B said we've got a seven course
[1:53:11] meal laid out before us cuz all Seven
[1:53:13] Seals have been open to us the whole
[1:53:16] word of God is completely open 100% open
[1:53:18] to
[1:53:20] us I love this being aliens from the
[1:53:23] Commonwealth of Israel and
[1:53:26] strangers from the covenants of
[1:53:30] promise you know how it is when you
[1:53:31] invite strangers into your household you
[1:53:33] watch your
[1:53:34] stuff you don't just invite them to do
[1:53:36] anything and everything you watch them
[1:53:39] you give them limitations gentile people
[1:53:41] have one limitation after another but
[1:53:43] watch what he said having their the
[1:53:46] excuse me where he said uh uh strangers
[1:53:50] from the covenants of Promise having no
[1:53:51] hope without God in the world that
[1:53:55] that's us that's right no
[1:53:58] hope we had no chance whatsoever of
[1:54:00] knowing god by intimacy or
[1:54:03] Fellowship but God Amen who was rich in
[1:54:11] Mercy I imagine some of them Jews did
[1:54:17] Jesus why would you have fellowship with
[1:54:19] this when a dog over here he said I
[1:54:22] found such great faith like this one
[1:54:23] over here this little sarapa woman this
[1:54:25] little Gentile girl she's got greater
[1:54:27] Faith than all
[1:54:28] y'all I one of you message people have
[1:54:31] got the faith this little girl I got
[1:54:32] right here that's what he told
[1:54:35] them why because God knew give it just a
[1:54:38] little bit of time and eventually the
[1:54:41] Gentile would come to their place to see
[1:54:42] who they really were yes sir but they
[1:54:45] looked down upon the Gentiles you know
[1:54:48] that it said that in the I think it's in
[1:54:50] the in the mission that if the Pharisees
[1:54:53] were walking down through the street and
[1:54:54] the shadow of a gentile laid upon them
[1:54:57] they would and had to wash their flesh
[1:54:58] in water cuz they were impure that's not
[1:55:01] Bible doctrine that was their Doctrine
[1:55:03] about the same foolishness you hear in
[1:55:04] message churches
[1:55:08] today amen praise the Lord anybody
[1:55:11] that's not bride we can't fellowship
[1:55:13] with him we can't talk to them we can't
[1:55:14] be nice to them oh you don't believe the
[1:55:16] message what I want to do with you
[1:55:17] you're an old Baptist you're an old
[1:55:19] Catholic what was you when God got a
[1:55:20] hold of you if you don't know the answer
[1:55:23] to that allow me to fill in the blank
[1:55:24] for you an alien a stranger to the
[1:55:28] [Applause]
[1:55:29] Commonwealth that's what I was that's
[1:55:31] what you was yes sir that's what you
[1:55:33] were rather watch here to Ephesians
[1:55:35] chapter 4 now verse 17 I love how Paul
[1:55:38] words this is one of my favorite ways he
[1:55:40] puts this I love the way he put words
[1:55:42] this this he said this I say therefore
[1:55:44] and testify in the Lord oh goody testify
[1:55:48] Paul tell us something you henceforth
[1:55:51] what not is other Gentiles
[1:55:53] walk in the vanity of their
[1:55:57] mind I love this statement right here
[1:55:59] cuz you realize that's the way it is
[1:56:01] when you start thinking like mblf thinks
[1:56:04] like he thought I should say past tense
[1:56:06] thought when you think like that boy
[1:56:08] thought you're thinking in vanity yeah
[1:56:11] when you go around say well I'll do this
[1:56:13] and I should be that and I should be
[1:56:14] better than this and I do this and ought
[1:56:16] to go to school and why did I go to
[1:56:18] school and why did I go to this place
[1:56:20] and why did I take that job do you
[1:56:22] understand everybody that is
[1:56:23] Vanity our Destinies and you listen to
[1:56:26] me good church our destiny is in the
[1:56:28] hands of God not
[1:56:31] ourselves we will be whatever our Potter
[1:56:34] wants to make us somebody say
[1:56:36] Amen we do not control our Destinies so
[1:56:40] to sit around and say well I'll do this
[1:56:42] and I'll do the Bible said if you say
[1:56:43] that say if the Lord be
[1:56:45] willing don't bind your soul or I'll do
[1:56:48] this and I'll do that say the Lord be
[1:56:50] willing I'll do it cuz my destiny is in
[1:56:53] the hands of
[1:56:55] God and for me to get so caught up in
[1:56:57] all of this I'll do this and I should be
[1:56:58] this that's
[1:57:01] Vanity Vanity is in their
[1:57:03] mind oh how we could take another hour
[1:57:06] on that right there
[1:57:07] huh notice at Verse 18 having the their
[1:57:10] the the understanding
[1:57:12] darkened
[1:57:14] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:57:17] of
[1:57:18] God through the ignorance that is in
[1:57:21] them
[1:57:23] because of the blindness of their heart
[1:57:25] think of this they see if
[1:57:29] eyes but they can't see
[1:57:33] it their heart is so blinded they just
[1:57:36] constantly walk in darkness you ever see
[1:57:39] people like that they've got Ambitions
[1:57:42] they've made money they've been
[1:57:43] successful they've got plans they're
[1:57:45] going to do this and that and the other
[1:57:46] and everything that their mind is set on
[1:57:50] they're blind to see that when that's
[1:57:52] all over with their soul is still in
[1:57:55] Jeopardy I was thinking about it coming
[1:57:57] up the road all the years that the
[1:57:58] Lord's let me serve him what benefit
[1:58:00] would it be for me to have everything
[1:58:02] just so so in my life and wind up in
[1:58:05] Hell wind up in the regions of the lost
[1:58:07] to preach all these sermons and travel
[1:58:10] all these places and try to help the
[1:58:11] people of God my entire life have
[1:58:13] dedicated and committed to the service
[1:58:15] of God and come to the end of it and
[1:58:17] wind up in the regions of the
[1:58:19] Lost why would I want to trade myself
[1:58:23] over just to be known or have some kind
[1:58:25] of an image with people to be popular or
[1:58:29] some kind of a thing like that men of
[1:58:30] God don't seek such things like
[1:58:33] this we seek for one thing to do only
[1:58:37] that which pleases my
[1:58:40] father but so many have made merchandise
[1:58:43] out of the very thing we've given our
[1:58:45] lives for you like me have given your
[1:58:48] life for this truth you've had families
[1:58:50] stand against you you've had friends
[1:58:52] will forsake you you've taken
[1:58:53] persecution beating after beating for
[1:58:56] the sake of this message like me you
[1:58:57] have suffered just the same as I
[1:59:01] have what good would it be to come all
[1:59:03] the way up to the end of the
[1:59:05] road and wind up in hell because we're
[1:59:08] blinded to see the real
[1:59:10] picture cuz you see that's what was
[1:59:12] going on with MF he was just simply
[1:59:15] blinded to seeing who he
[1:59:19] was but God who was rich in Mercy
[1:59:23] Hallelujah say come here boy come here
[1:59:27] I've got a special seat right here for
[1:59:29] you we were
[1:59:32] alienated but before the world ever
[1:59:34] began God already had a
[1:59:37] seat he already had a place prepared let
[1:59:41] not your heart be troubled you believe
[1:59:43] in God believe also in me I go to
[1:59:45] prepare
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:55] Colossians
[2:00:00] 1:21 let's go a bit further and let's
[2:00:02] quit believe it or not it's already 6
[2:00:06] o00 and you that was sometime I like how
[2:00:09] he makes this personal you he wasn't
[2:00:12] talking to everybody he's talking to the
[2:00:14] elect here this letter is only for us on
[2:00:17] tape so to
[2:00:19] speak to my crowd my group that follows
[2:00:22] message would say brother brandham and
[2:00:24] you that were sometime alienated
[2:00:30] and just like M
[2:00:34] fibf here this boy was alienated and an
[2:00:38] enemy in his
[2:00:41] mind it's amazing to think that such a a
[2:00:45] mindset would be an enemy but it
[2:00:49] was cuz anytime David would ever say
[2:00:51] well you're a king son oh but I'm a dog
[2:00:54] oh but you you know you're Saul's
[2:00:55] grandson oh yes but I I'm I I live in
[2:00:59] loar yes but you know you you got your
[2:01:01] royalty yes but my name even means
[2:01:03] breathing shame that vanity is an
[2:01:08] enemy I hope you see what I'm saying to
[2:01:10] you alienated in our mind and enemies in
[2:01:13] our mind by Wicked Works yet now half
[2:01:16] he
[2:01:19] reconciled now you see when God
[2:01:21] reconciled it was at Calvary of course
[2:01:24] but when you reconcile something you
[2:01:26] also solve the
[2:01:28] problem and the problem in our mind was
[2:01:31] we were full of
[2:01:32] vanity so it's appropriate in the very
[2:01:35] last part of the church age what brother
[2:01:38] called The Mind age to come down and use
[2:01:41] the message to change our minds right
[2:01:45] about who we
[2:01:46] are oh my God somebody somebody you
[2:01:50] should have got a hold of that one why
[2:01:52] would that be important you say it's not
[2:01:54] important yes it is brother Ben said
[2:01:56] when the bride knows who she is then the
[2:02:00] Rapture will come and he'll take us away
[2:02:02] out of here
[2:02:05] hallelujah so if you don't know who you
[2:02:07] are my FF there you
[2:02:10] go you're holding up the Rapture until
[2:02:12] that day comes
[2:02:15] hallu praise the Lord
[2:02:17] somebody and watch us again in law and
[2:02:19] Grace brother says I hope you see it
[2:02:22] it isn't whether you're good enough to
[2:02:24] be a Christian or
[2:02:25] not but it's whether he was good enough
[2:02:29] if God accepted him and his blood makes
[2:02:31] an atonement God don't see
[2:02:35] you
[2:02:38] hallelujah oh glory to
[2:02:41] God you see when the blood was sprayed
[2:02:44] for that lamb all of that altar it
[2:02:46] painted it didn't just paint that one
[2:02:48] spot at the altar but it created this
[2:02:51] Blood spr this pain over all of
[2:02:54] Israel that when God looked down at any
[2:02:57] of
[2:02:58] them red on red created
[2:03:01] [Applause]
[2:03:03] white he looked down through the red
[2:03:05] sins and looked down through that red
[2:03:06] animal blood of that red animal and when
[2:03:08] they look down at all Israel he saw them
[2:03:12] as being
[2:03:13] pure clean
[2:03:16] white and it didn't matter it didn't
[2:03:19] matter it didn't matter it didn't matter
[2:03:21] what was laying inside of
[2:03:23] Israel when that paint painted it
[2:03:25] painted what it
[2:03:27] painted woo glory god don't see you he
[2:03:32] sees the
[2:03:34] lamb here's another type of this in
[2:03:36] Leviticus 16: 89 and 10 the Bible refers
[2:03:40] to the scapegoat the scapegoat was in
[2:03:43] fact the sins was laid upon this
[2:03:46] scapegoat and the set was set free in
[2:03:49] the wilderness now that represented one
[2:03:51] thing when it was set free in the
[2:03:53] wilderness and it went out into the
[2:03:54] Wilderness it represented that jesus
[2:03:56] carried my sins as far as the East is
[2:04:00] from the
[2:04:02] West so in this chapter in Leviticus
[2:04:04] when you go back and read this later
[2:04:05] tonight and when you study Leviticus 16
[2:04:08] you got to look at this scapegoat right
[2:04:09] here remember that the scapegoat carried
[2:04:12] them
[2:04:13] away but the scapegoat never brought
[2:04:15] them
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:19] back maybe you didn't get it let's put
[2:04:21] it another way way the scapegoat carried
[2:04:23] the sins out of Israel never brought
[2:04:26] them back into
[2:04:28] Israel jesus carried my sins
[2:04:31] away but he never return
[2:04:35] return glory to God hallelujah but he
[2:04:39] never returned them to
[2:04:42] me once my sins are gone they're
[2:04:45] gone they'll never come back again
[2:04:48] hallelujah oh I know what you're
[2:04:50] thinking but what about when do it again
[2:04:52] then he carries it again what about if I
[2:04:53] do it again then he carries it again
[2:04:54] what if you do it again then he carries
[2:04:55] it
[2:04:58] again W glory to God Woo is Right amen
[2:05:02] whoever that was Woo is Right
[2:05:05] Hallelujah right exactly right he
[2:05:07] carries them
[2:05:09] out hallu I love this B says and that
[2:05:13] was me William brandham you know I wish
[2:05:16] the people that every word he said was
[2:05:17] thus sayith the Lord I wish they would
[2:05:19] quote this little Dandy right here
[2:05:21] William brandham no good not fit to live
[2:05:24] WHYY to go to hell born in a sinful
[2:05:26] family raised a sinner no good at all
[2:05:29] not one sound part about me say what he
[2:05:33] said say what he
[2:05:35] said how can they make in deity and read
[2:05:40] this how can you make this man
[2:05:42] infallible and he say these
[2:05:45] words sir I want you to watch how
[2:05:48] brother bam handles this though because
[2:05:50] you see I'm stopping here for a moment
[2:05:53] to introduce this to you there's a
[2:05:55] collection of people in the message and
[2:05:57] I'll say message people because that's
[2:05:59] what we're dealing with they're all
[2:06:00] around everywhere but especially around
[2:06:02] the ranks of the message I meet these
[2:06:03] people all the time that love the
[2:06:06] scandal of being
[2:06:09] bad they fall in love with the idea of
[2:06:11] I'm a sinner I'm no good I'm sorry I'm
[2:06:14] worthless you see that gets them a lot
[2:06:16] of attention from people when they can
[2:06:19] constantly be broken right woo it got
[2:06:22] quiet in here true remember brother B
[2:06:27] said when somebody is always seeking
[2:06:29] attention there's a spiritual sickness
[2:06:32] in there
[2:06:36] somewhere some people don't want to be
[2:06:38] healed of their
[2:06:41] sicknesses right I'm sure there was
[2:06:43] probably some that Jesus went to go heal
[2:06:46] and and maybe they say who oh Jesus
[2:06:48] don't touch me I draw a check every
[2:06:49] month
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:55] I know there's some people that fall in
[2:06:57] love with that Low debar
[2:07:01] Mentality I've been to prayer meetings
[2:07:03] and hear them pray 45 minutes they go
[2:07:05] Lord I'm scum I'm good for nothing I'm
[2:07:07] worthless the whole world is going to
[2:07:09] hell in a hand basket we're all doomed
[2:07:11] for Destruction and spend five minutes
[2:07:13] maybe 5 Seconds saying Thank You Lord
[2:07:15] thank you for your mercy Praise Jesus
[2:07:17] but the world is Fallen apart and
[2:07:18] insurent SE everywhere and we
[2:07:22] y'all reckon if we switch that around
[2:07:24] how will we be better or worse what do
[2:07:26] y'all think if we spent more like 45
[2:07:29] minutes saying Lord thank you for your
[2:07:31] grace thank you for your mercy thank you
[2:07:33] for all the good things you've done
[2:07:35] thank you for not leaving me alone when
[2:07:37] I felt alone thank you for not forsaken
[2:07:39] me when I felt forsaken thank you for
[2:07:41] not walking out of me when I was at my
[2:07:43] wor thank you for coming the Lord
[2:07:48] of and pulling me back up into the high
[2:07:50] mountain of praise
[2:07:56] but some people love this kind of
[2:07:59] attention the worse they can make it the
[2:08:01] better they
[2:08:03] feel they're addicted to that kind of
[2:08:05] attention so you'll watch them they
[2:08:07] never can fix nothing and if you fix it
[2:08:10] I know this is a preacher of 33 years if
[2:08:12] you fix it they'll break something
[2:08:15] else I work with a with a person for
[2:08:18] close to 10 years 10 years this person
[2:08:22] nearly half my life when I when I first
[2:08:24] met him I was just in my 20s I work from
[2:08:26] this person with this person from a boy
[2:08:27] up the time I started preaching at 14
[2:08:29] all the way up to nearly 24 25 years old
[2:08:32] I work with this brother work with this
[2:08:33] brother work with this brother and right
[2:08:35] when I would solve one problem something
[2:08:37] else would pop up you ever play that
[2:08:39] little game with the little hedgehogs or
[2:08:41] whoever and you you and you bunk one and
[2:08:45] then come on now that's the way some
[2:08:48] people are you solve one problem they'll
[2:08:50] invent 10 more
[2:08:51] more cuz they love living in low to
[2:08:56] Bar they love the feeling that they get
[2:08:59] when they I'm just a dog I'm a flea I'm
[2:09:01] a worm but now if you watch the way
[2:09:04] brother Bram handles this he says these
[2:09:07] things about himself and he comes to a
[2:09:10] point he
[2:09:11] stops very next two three four sentences
[2:09:14] he says that's right but one day
[2:09:20] [Applause]
[2:09:22] I accept it Hallelujah he says when God
[2:09:25] looked down on Christ and Christ took my
[2:09:27] place then God don't see me he sees the
[2:09:30] perfect
[2:09:32] one so you see brother there's a line
[2:09:35] you can say yes I was a sinner yes I was
[2:09:37] no good but one
[2:09:40] day that's one of my favorite words in
[2:09:43] the whole Bible I've been blessed off
[2:09:45] that one word more than any word I can
[2:09:46] think of whenever you'd say well the
[2:09:48] world was going to be Smitten by a curse
[2:09:50] but in the days of the voice of
[2:09:54] the Hallelujah I was on my way to he
[2:09:58] alienated from the very Fellowship of
[2:10:00] God by God who was rich in
[2:10:08] Mercy so we got to learn the
[2:10:11] line there's a line we don't cross you
[2:10:14] go so far into it and then you stop and
[2:10:17] now you got to start realizing okay I
[2:10:19] may have been myf
[2:10:22] but I'm also sitting at David's table
[2:10:26] now I'm not going to micromanage how you
[2:10:29] do this as a preacher but I'm just going
[2:10:30] to tell you you need to be Discerning
[2:10:32] about what comes out of this big fat
[2:10:34] thing right here between your
[2:10:36] lips it's whether you realize or not
[2:10:38] this sound fire of
[2:10:40] hell it's a
[2:10:43] troublemaker life and death LS right
[2:10:45] here in this
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:48] thing praise God m
[2:10:52] listen to this the message called the 10
[2:10:54] virgins now brother randam is going to
[2:10:56] the story of
[2:10:57] Jesus his crucifixion and and he stops
[2:11:00] and he says
[2:11:01] oh I was that
[2:11:05] barabus I was the one that deserved to
[2:11:08] die and he took my place I I thought on
[2:11:12] this and I thought to myself what what
[2:11:14] what must have been like I tried to
[2:11:16] visualize in my mind what that must have
[2:11:18] looked like for this man here he's in
[2:11:20] prison
[2:11:21] chains around him he he's he's done
[2:11:24] nothing but condition himself to be hung
[2:11:26] on a cross to be crucified soon with the
[2:11:29] rest of those those other two thieves
[2:11:30] the one that got
[2:11:32] saved cuz you know God had that
[2:11:34] predestinated plan sitting there cuz the
[2:11:37] one Thief was the one on the left he
[2:11:38] pardon wasn't it was the left side the
[2:11:40] one was on the left didn't need a
[2:11:43] barabus the one on the left left needed
[2:11:46] to Jesus and the only way to get that
[2:11:48] Jesus in there was somebody had to trade
[2:11:50] places
[2:11:53] you imagine they had websites in that
[2:11:55] day how unfair message people would have
[2:11:56] been all over the place saying I can't
[2:11:58] believe they done Jesus the way they'
[2:11:59] done him they' have been tweeting they'd
[2:12:00] have been instagramming they would have
[2:12:02] been all kind they' been FaceTiming one
[2:12:04] another you ain't going to believe look
[2:12:05] up here on the mountain look how
[2:12:08] good but God's plan sometimes comes in
[2:12:11] ways we don't expect
[2:12:13] it and hear this man no doubt here's the
[2:12:17] commotion down the
[2:12:18] hallway and big burly Roman soldiers
[2:12:21] come down their armor clinking as they
[2:12:23] want and that little feeling where your
[2:12:25] arteries jump you know when you get
[2:12:27] scared that must have gripped him as
[2:12:29] blood pressure of M started raising up
[2:12:30] he heard his heart beat in his
[2:12:33] ears his mouth goes immediately
[2:12:35] dry and every muscle in his body starts
[2:12:39] trembling he goes in almost a nervous
[2:12:44] cataclysmic and these guards come
[2:12:46] walking down they hear the key Jam in
[2:12:47] the lock
[2:12:51] they come walking in through the door
[2:12:53] this big guy maybe a big beard like I
[2:12:56] got and come walk down look at him and
[2:12:58] say you're
[2:13:05] free maybe he would
[2:13:08] have you don't play with me now you
[2:13:11] telling jokes what what do you mean I'm
[2:13:14] free you're having fun with me right the
[2:13:16] last hours of my life now you're making
[2:13:17] fun of
[2:13:18] me Barabbas

[2:13:24] that hill in a matter of 12
[2:13:26] hours but you see right down come here
[2:13:29] come here
[2:13:30] come look down this hallway down here
[2:13:34] you see that man standing down there
[2:13:35] with that purple robe on him at crown of
[2:13:37] thorns on his head he just took your
[2:13:40] place in this thing
[2:13:43] [Music]
[2:13:48] Hallelujah maybe Barabbas will say but

[2:13:52] guilty of course you are I caught you in
[2:13:55] the
[2:13:56] ACT I deserve to die sure you do but
[2:14:00] according to the law we have to set one
[2:14:03] prisoner
[2:14:04] free and the people called for that man
[2:14:07] down there to take your
[2:14:14] place
[2:14:16] Hall that's the way we were alienated
[2:14:19] from God enemy in are Mind by Wicked
[2:14:22] works we deserve to die but all of a
[2:14:25] sudden we heard King David
[2:14:30] say come the
[2:14:34] Fe come
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:14:55] this is how
[2:14:57] amazing the blood of Christ is for us in

[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:10] you C can you not understand that this
[2:16:12] is
[2:16:13] why when you take the very word of God
[2:16:16] upon your lips it's the same as deity
[2:16:18] speaking yes and when you ask in faith
[2:16:22] yes not a miss not missing any one thing
[2:16:25] but you ask on the foundation of faith
[2:16:27] of God in FA faith of God's word and
[2:16:29] you've got trust and faith in God's word
[2:16:31] and you ask something in faith you say
[2:16:32] Lord Jesus I'm sick in my body I need
[2:16:34] healing a healing touch from you Lord I
[2:16:37] I'm troubled about my family I need to

[2:16:47] you realize when you're asking
[2:16:49] that it's your voice
[2:16:52] but it's Christ
[2:16:53] blood and then God recognizes it as
[2:16:56] though it's God talking to himself oh my
[2:17:01] God I shouldn't have started this we're
[2:17:03] going to be here another 30 minutes I

[2:17:51] the message would be the shout and the
[2:17:54] message would also produce a voice the
[2:17:57] voice of the
[2:17:59] resurrection and that voice of God that
[2:18:01] voice of the Resurrection is going to be
[2:18:03] in here whether you realize it or not
