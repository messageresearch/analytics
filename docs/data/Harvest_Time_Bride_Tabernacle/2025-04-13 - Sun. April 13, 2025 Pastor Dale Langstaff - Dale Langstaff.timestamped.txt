[18:46] [Applause]
[18:48] [Music]
[18:56] [Applause]
[19:02] you
[19:05] Heat. Heat.
[19:18] The reason
[19:30] Amen. We worship him this morning. Amen.
[19:34] Amen. Maybe you can have your seats just
[19:36] for a moment as
[19:38] we have some announcements.
[19:42] Just Amen.
[19:46] Like we mentioned for prayer, just
[19:48] remember Paul
[19:49] Leontaine this Wednesday
[19:52] coming. Amen. And we're looking forward
[19:55] to
[19:56] that. Just some meetings coming ahead,
[19:58] different ones or as summer comes on.
[20:01] We're just getting ready to do our
[20:03] posters for camp and we have our
[20:06] ministry picked. Amen. For camp and so
[20:10] different ones have called and different
[20:12] things, but it's 1 of August. We just
[20:14] look forward to that. Amen. Amen. I just
[20:18] before I minister, I just want to make a
[20:21] a correction
[20:23] um from last Sunday um and just make a
[20:27] comment on that and uh so you everybody
[20:30] understands the video's still up. I've
[20:33] talked to brother Kyle and brother Kyle
[20:36] when he was ministering near the end of
[20:38] the message just misspoke. He didn't
[20:41] mean to say what he did, but he said
[20:43] Satan was co-equal with
[20:46] God. And he meant to say that he's
[20:49] almost co-equal with
[20:52] God. Amen. And Brother Bram actually
[20:55] said that in one quote. He said that
[20:57] Satan was almost co-equal with God. And
[21:00] another quote, Brother Bram said before
[21:03] the fall that Satan was co-equal with
[21:08] God.
[21:10] But in the
[21:12] message you have to understand the
[21:15] context of when the prophet says that
[21:18] because the one time brother Bram said
[21:21] that he is almost co-equal with God he
[21:24] was talking about Adam and Eve and he
[21:26] said they were co-equal until the fall
[21:28] and then Eve became Adam became the head
[21:32] of Eve and so he was comparing and he
[21:36] only does one little short paragraph
[21:38] he's preaching about the sin of the
[21:39] garden and he's preaching about Adam and
[21:42] Eve were were made in the image of God
[21:44] perfectly co-equal
[21:46] and then sin command and then Eve Adam
[21:50] became her head and the other time where
[21:53] brother Brham said about Satan being
[21:55] co-equal with God in heaven before the
[21:57] fall it wasn't even Satan so brother
[21:59] Brandham
[22:01] misspoke because Satan wasn't Satan
[22:03] until the fall it was an angel it was a
[22:07] cherubam angel
[22:10] I hope that don't stumble you, but
[22:11] that's just
[22:12] facts. There wasn't a Satan until the
[22:15] fall. And so, I want to give you just
[22:17] some things that Brother Bram said.
[22:19] Brother Bram said that the only thing
[22:21] that has eternal life is
[22:24] God. And and I'm I'm just this is just a
[22:27] short foundation. We're not preaching on
[22:29] this. But it would offend me to say that
[22:34] Satan is almost co-equal with God.
[22:37] or co-equal with God. And if that if
[22:40] you're sad that that offends me, that's
[22:43] your choice. But there ain't nobody even
[22:45] close to the God I serve.
[22:48] Because brother Brandham said, "The only
[22:50] person that there was before God was
[22:52] even worshiped was the spirit God." And
[22:55] to be eternal, you had to come from God.
[22:58] So if you say Satan is co-equal with
[23:01] God, if you even where brother said he's
[23:03] almost co-equal with God, you would have
[23:06] to say that Satan was there in the
[23:07] beginning with
[23:09] God or he came out of God as a seed. And
[23:12] that would make him your
[23:16] brother. So Satan is not even almost
[23:19] co-equal with
[23:21] God. And he definitely is not co-equal
[23:24] with God. See, brother Bram said that
[23:26] the ones that were in the thoughts of
[23:28] God, like us, that were spoken word
[23:31] children, that you could no more be lost
[23:35] than God could be lost.
[23:37] So if Satan was almost co-le with God,
[23:40] that means he would have eternal life.
[23:43] That would make him your brother. And
[23:45] the prophet clearly taught us that hell
[23:48] was made for Satan and his angels and
[23:50] it's not eternal.
[23:53] So even our prophet.
[23:58] Amen.
[24:01] Now, brother Kyle did not mean to
[24:04] mislead us. He
[24:07] misspoke. Amen. And with our prophet, he
[24:11] was doing it in different contextes. But
[24:14] that's a huge difference. The God I
[24:17] serve, there ain't nobody even close to
[24:20] him.
[24:21] Everybody was created by God and
[24:24] everybody has to get permission from God
[24:26] to do anything. So, so it's not like
[24:29] almost the same. It's like a million
[24:32] miles from the same. Amen. Let's stand
[24:35] and read Hebrews 13 5 and
[24:40] 6. Amen. Hebrews 13 5 and 6. And I
[24:45] actually didn't plan on sharing that. I
[24:48] promised L on the way coming. I just
[24:50] didn't think I would go that way. But I
[24:51] actually felt pressured to to correct
[24:54] that before any misleading or even on
[24:58] the video. Amen. People watch that. I
[25:00] pray if they watch last Sunday, they
[25:01] watch this Sunday.
[25:04] Amen. Amen. Let your conversation be
[25:07] without
[25:09] controversialness, and be content with
[25:11] which things that you have. For he has
[25:14] said, I will never leave thee, nor
[25:16] forsake thee. Verse six, so that we may
[25:20] boldly say, "The Lord is my helper, and
[25:24] I will not
[25:26] fear what men shall
[25:29] do unto me." For the Lord is my
[25:33] helper, and we shall not fear what men
[25:37] shall do unto me. Lord Jesus, I pray
[25:39] that that you will minister the word
[25:42] this morning like you ministered it to
[25:45] me, Lord God, and help us to understand
[25:48] you better, Lord God. Every time the
[25:49] word comes forth, it's to know you
[25:52] better, understand you better, and serve
[25:55] you better. And the word comes different
[25:57] every time according to your will, Lord
[25:59] God. And I pray that that it it'll be
[26:02] different. It might be different this
[26:03] morning to what people think, but I pray
[26:06] that in this differentness, it'll help
[26:08] us understand you, God. In a different
[26:10] way, we pray.
[26:13] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I
[26:16] want to title my message this
[26:18] morning, A Silent
[26:22] God. A
[26:23] silent God. And I also want to tell you
[26:27] that I have things that I haven't even
[26:29] put in my notes yet. And so this is
[26:31] going to be one of the few
[26:33] parts that we're going to preach on a
[26:36] silent God. And many times in the
[26:39] Christian's lives, God is silent. Oh
[26:42] yes. Thank you. I didn't turn my mic on
[26:45] when I was singing cuz
[26:46] I didn't want nobody to hear me. Amen.
[26:51] Amen. Many times in the believer's life,
[26:55] but and and then many times he was just
[26:58] like I mean he was just overwhelming if
[27:01] he wanted to show himself. But I want to
[27:03] show you dozens so many I won't even
[27:07] finish them today. Dozens and dozens of
[27:10] examples of how God was silent in
[27:13] different matter of fact before I even
[27:15] read a quote from the prophet let me
[27:16] give you an example that happened almost
[27:19] in our day.
[27:21] And I don't even have it. I left it at
[27:23] home and it was supposed to be next
[27:25] Sunday's but I just feel to share it. It
[27:27] was it was overwhelming to me when I
[27:29] read it is the man that wrote the
[27:32] English
[27:35] Bible interpreted it. Do you know his
[27:37] name? I have the whole thing at home and
[27:40] I couldn't even put everything in my
[27:42] notes. God was silent to that
[27:46] man. Do you know that man? The very
[27:49] Bible you read, he gave his life
[27:53] for. I mean, he was burned alive,
[27:56] chained to a
[27:58] stake. Do you know that the the the
[28:01] church of the day then were were lying
[28:04] to the people? And do you know what that
[28:06] man said to the priests and and the the
[28:09] dignitaries of that day? He said his
[28:12] prayer was and and I I I could make this
[28:17] person
[28:19] I I pray you can he his prayer was the
[28:22] man that interpreted the
[28:24] Bible. He said, "I pray that after I'm
[28:28] gone or after I do this, that the
[28:30] smallest plow boy, the smallest farmer
[28:34] boy will know more about the scriptures
[28:39] than the
[28:41] priest." God answered that prayer, but
[28:44] he's not still
[28:46] alive. Because a dumb farmer boy can
[28:50] like me can know 10,000 times more about
[28:57] God than they did then. Do you know he
[29:01] ran for his life? He went to other
[29:03] countries for his life. And you know his
[29:06] best friend turned him
[29:08] in. best friend. That means it was a
[29:14] Christian. Just let that soak in for
[29:16] just a
[29:17] second. His best Christian friend told
[29:22] the
[29:23] church where he was so they could take
[29:26] him and burn him
[29:33] alive. Spirits don't die. We do that
[29:35] today by our character.
[29:39] burn people
[29:42] alive. And also when he his last breath
[29:47] was the prayer I told you earlier was an
[29:50] earlier prayer, but his last breath was
[29:52] he cried out to the king of England and
[29:55] and he said, "Oh king," he said, "change
[29:58] this
[29:59] law. Change this." Oh, by the way, he
[30:02] didn't obey the
[30:04] government. for all you good Christians
[30:06] that want to obey the government. He
[30:07] didn't obey the
[30:08] government. He went against every rule
[30:11] of the
[30:13] government. And he cried out on his last
[30:16] breast was, "Oh king, change this
[30:19] law that this will not be like this."
[30:23] And about one
[30:26] year after God was silent, was God
[30:30] silent? Let me ask you something. Did
[30:32] God send a prophet to take the the seals
[30:35] off the Bible? Did God send the pro
[30:37] Well, we know he did. Did God send a
[30:39] prophet to take the scales off of our
[30:41] eyes so we could understand the
[30:43] scriptures?
[30:45] Wouldn't have God wanted the Bible to be
[30:47] wrote so you could at least read it.
[30:53] But he didn't answer his prayer.
[30:57] God let him
[31:00] burn alive.
[31:09] Brother Bram said, "When you meet every
[31:10] circumstances and you know that it's
[31:13] according to God's will and the
[31:15] requirement of God has been
[31:17] met or you ask, have we met the
[31:20] requirement?" And God just lies
[31:25] there
[31:27] silent. He said he just won't
[31:32] answer
[31:34] us. That's in being certain of God. In
[31:37] 59 he said I'm sure I'm be preaching
[31:40] talking to people this morning who this
[31:42] has come to place and I have brother
[31:45] Brown. He said, "And I have been there
[31:49] many times myself. And when I look back
[31:53] and I trace my life and I turn every
[31:56] stone and I find that I've been and even
[32:00] if I had done something wrong and I
[32:01] confess it and I say," Lord God, may
[32:03] I've made it right and let's go do so."
[32:06] And then come back and I say again, "Now
[32:08] Lord, thou art
[32:10] God and you surely will answer me.
[32:14] Surely I've met every requirement and
[32:17] request that you you have established
[32:20] and you've got to be and and God don't
[32:24] move. And it seems like he's silent,
[32:29] then you've got to know for
[32:31] sure and your
[32:34] heart that he's
[32:36] still
[32:40] God. Amen. Next Sunday, we're going to
[32:43] preach on Job, but I want to go on some
[32:46] different ones. Job had to know that God
[32:50] was
[32:53] God. Amen. But let's look at four
[32:56] examples in the
[32:57] Bible where God never answered the
[33:01] believer's prayers. The widow woman, we
[33:03] could turn to First Kings, First Kings
[33:07] 17:12. Vicki, thanks. The widow
[33:10] woman. And God was allowing the widow
[33:12] woman to
[33:14] starve to
[33:18] death. And the widow woman said, she
[33:20] said, "As the Lord thy God liveth," when
[33:22] the prophet got to him, she said, "I
[33:24] have not a cake. I have nothing in my
[33:27] house to eat, but I have a handful of
[33:30] meal in the barrel and a little oil in
[33:32] the cruise. And behold, I am gathering
[33:35] two sticks, which is a type of the
[33:37] cross, and I am going to sacrifice my
[33:41] life and my son's
[33:44] life. I'm gathering two sticks that I
[33:47] may go in and dress it for me and my
[33:50] son, and that we may
[33:53] eat, and we know we will
[33:57] surely die.
[34:02] God was silent to that widow woman. Now,
[34:07] we know in this case, praise God, that
[34:10] God's never late. That's always the
[34:13] case. He's never late. But he came
[34:16] before this woman
[34:18] dies. Amen. And he sent her a prophet
[34:22] that said,
[34:23] "Surely the meal and the oil will never
[34:26] go dry until rain comes upon the
[34:30] earth." Amen. And so God God can see, I
[34:34] showed you both ways. That wasn't the
[34:36] case for the man that wrote the Bible.
[34:40] So you can read your Bible
[34:43] today. Amen.
[34:45] If we go farther down, let's go to
[34:48] Daniel 31 17 and
[34:51] 18. Amen.
[34:53] and uh look at another
[34:57] example and see how I want to God wants
[35:00] to show us this morning that if God
[35:03] don't move the way that we think he
[35:06] should or in the time frame that we
[35:09] think he should. I I might not get to it
[35:11] this morning, but brother Bram said that
[35:13] believers, we lose faith in God because
[35:17] he don't answer our prayer the way we
[35:19] required or prayed it. the way we pray.
[35:23] God pay my bills. And he chooses not to
[35:26] pay your bills. And you say, well, you
[35:29] know, you didn't answer my prayer. But
[35:30] he did answer your prayer. He did it the
[35:31] way that was good for you. I mean, it
[35:34] was his will. And so, you'll see this in
[35:36] the the three three Hebrew children,
[35:39] Daniel 3:17. He said, here they're
[35:41] coming. You know the story. But he says,
[35:43] "If it be so, our God whom we serve is
[35:47] able to deliver us from the fiery
[35:49] furnace." Matter of fact, let me just
[35:51] stop right there for a minute. I'm going
[35:53] to read the quote this
[35:55] morning where God gave brother Brandham
[35:58] his his uh third commission, his third
[36:03] pull. And God came down to brother Brham
[36:06] and said, "You must accept it." And you
[36:08] know what brother Brham said back to
[36:10] God?
[36:12] He said, 'I'm afraid of seeing the
[36:14] vision
[36:17] wrong or speaking something out loud
[36:20] that you don't
[36:23] honor. Brother Bram was afraid of
[36:25] calling somebody out and saying, "I see
[36:27] this, this, this, this, this, in your
[36:29] life, and thus sayith the Lord, you go
[36:31] home, you're healed." He says that to
[36:33] God. He says that to the angel. God
[36:36] said, "I'm waiting for you to accept
[36:38] your commission."
[36:40] He's waiting for us to accept his
[36:43] commission. Amen. So, we see the Hebrew
[36:46] children's. He says, "We know that he's
[36:48] able to deliver us and we and he will
[36:50] deliver us out of thine hand, O king."
[36:54] Now, see, watch this. They didn't know.
[36:57] They knew God could deliver them. But
[36:59] either way, they were going to be out of
[37:01] the hand of the king.
[37:03] To live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[37:10] Wow. I pray to God that we'll get there
[37:14] someday. But if
[37:16] not, be it known unto thee, oh king,
[37:20] that we will not serve you and your
[37:24] gods, nor will we worship the golden
[37:29] image that you have set up before us.
[37:32] See, the three Hebrew children had it
[37:34] figured out that if God was silent or
[37:37] not
[37:38] silent, he was still their
[37:41] God. And if God chose to either way,
[37:45] whether God was silent, and we know the
[37:48] beautiful story that he came down, the
[37:50] fourth person in the fire, and they come
[37:52] out, and there wasn't even smoke on
[37:53] them, and and it was tremendous, and and
[37:56] he wasn't late.
[37:58] But the three Hebrew children had a
[38:00] revelation that either way I want to
[38:03] tell you something this morning. Your
[38:04] God may seem silent to you. But he's
[38:07] still you have to have a revelation that
[38:09] he's still delivering you.
[38:11] He's still delivering you. If God never
[38:14] speaks to you again and never answers
[38:16] another prayer, is he still your God?
[38:19] Amen. Amen. Amen. That's that's where we
[38:23] have to be and come to. Brother Bam
[38:25] said, "I pray for the sick, and if I
[38:27] never see another sick person here, I'm
[38:29] going to continue to pray or preach that
[38:32] God's a healer, and he is a healer."
[38:35] And we've proven that many times here.
[38:37] Let's just look into Genesis 37, Vicki.
[38:41] And and we'll we'll start at verse uh
[38:44] three here. You know, I sometimes this
[38:47] is a paradox even especially for the
[38:49] kids, but Jacob got his new name was
[38:51] Israel. And every time I think of Jacob
[38:53] as Israel, I think of the nation Israel.
[38:55] And and so it almost messes me up. I But
[38:58] uh but here we see Israel and verse
[39:02] three. And he says, "Now Israel loved
[39:04] Joseph more than all his children." Now
[39:07] that's because you know it was God's
[39:10] plan.
[39:11] Amen. Because he was a son in his old
[39:15] age. And he made him a coat of many
[39:17] colors. And then the brothers saw the
[39:21] brethren saw that his father loved him
[39:23] more than all his other brethren and
[39:26] they hate him for it and could not speak
[39:30] peaceibly above
[39:32] him. Now for
[39:35] Joseph a type of
[39:38] Christ God was very very silent. Do you
[39:43] know God was silent to Joseph?
[39:50] almost 22 years.
[39:56] 22 years. Do you know God was silent to
[40:00] many? Look at look at the things. Look
[40:02] at look at Noah in the in uh in the
[40:05] Bible. He preached 125 years and not one
[40:10] person came to his
[40:14] preaching. Not 125 years. He had the
[40:18] identical
[40:21] congregation in his
[40:23] church. Watch how we jump down into
[40:26] Genesis 45 and Genesis 45 and 25. And
[40:30] when here here he's saying and and
[40:33] brother Bam's going to show this that
[40:35] God is silent. We we get I I I pray we
[40:38] don't but it's it's easy for us to lift
[40:41] up a holy man or a holy priesthood or a
[40:44] or or or somebody's holy. Everybody's
[40:47] looking for a hero in their life. But
[40:49] you're the hero. Yeah. Amen.
[40:55] And God don't show any of his family
[40:58] more than he would show the littlest
[41:00] ones among us. Brother Bam said zillions
[41:03] of times, God does not show his prophets
[41:07] everything. And I mean, we could show
[41:10] that in every prophet's life.
[41:13] But let's just show this here. And he
[41:15] did this. God didn't show it to Jacob or
[41:18] Israel, whatever you'd want to call him.
[41:20] He didn't show him no
[41:22] secrets for 22
[41:25] years. He He God to Jacob was completely
[41:30] silent the whole time his son was gone
[41:34] 100%. He never gave him a vision. He
[41:36] never answered a prayer. He never my
[41:38] right would have died of famine.
[41:43] And they went to Egypt in verse 25 of
[41:45] 45. And they went to Egypt and came to
[41:48] the land of Canaan unto Jacob the
[41:52] father. In verse 26, and he told him,
[41:54] saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is
[41:58] the governor over the land of
[42:00] Egypt. And Jacob's
[42:03] heart
[42:08] fainted. Why was God silent?
[42:14] We'll never know that. We don't even
[42:15] have a right to ask
[42:17] God. God knows
[42:19] best.
[42:23] Amen. Here, Jacob in the end of his
[42:27] Christian life, Jacob had obeyed God
[42:30] till the letter. He had left his well I
[42:33] mean he didn't start out till the letter
[42:34] but he he took Lot with him and he left
[42:36] the the land and family did and then he
[42:38] had to come do a complete separation
[42:40] from Lot and everything he had and and
[42:43] God promised he said I'm going to give
[42:44] you a land that you don't know nothing
[42:46] of and he he so journey said where are
[42:48] we going today I don't know where I'm
[42:49] going I'm just I'm just walking
[42:53] God was with
[42:54] him amazing and then all of a sudden it
[42:58] just
[42:59] woo
[43:00] nothing. When they got to the so-called
[43:05] land where God was going to show
[43:07] them, God promised that he would show
[43:10] them the
[43:11] land. And when they were on their
[43:13] journey to the land, God stopped the
[43:17] directions. They hadn't reached the
[43:19] promised land
[43:22] yet. Amen. And Jacob's heart fainted,
[43:26] for he believed them not.
[43:29] And they told him all the words of
[43:31] Joseph which he had spake unto them. And
[43:33] then he saw the wagons and Jo was Joseph
[43:36] sat and
[43:38] saw and carried him in the
[43:42] spirit the wagons which Joseph Joseph
[43:45] had sent sorry to carry him. And the
[43:48] spirit of Jacob their father was
[43:51] revived. And Israel said, "It is enough.
[43:55] Joseph, my son, is yet alive." and I
[43:59] will go see him
[44:01] before I die. Brother Bram said this 21
[44:07] times that God don't show his prophets
[44:10] everything. Let's just read this in
[44:11] questions and answers. He said the
[44:12] prophet, the prophet of the Lord was
[44:16] blinded and deceived by his own son.
[44:23] The prophet Isa Isaac though the prophet
[44:27] Isaac
[44:29] though the prophet Isaiah though through
[44:32] him come Christ.
[44:35] So Christ came right down through his
[44:37] family
[44:38] lineage but he was still blinded by his
[44:42] own family member and we can call him a
[44:44] prophet and the Bible says that he was a
[44:46] prophet and was blinded.
[44:50] Wait a minute. I thought prophets were
[44:53] seers. Here's brother Brown saying he
[44:56] was blinded. God don't tell his prophets
[44:58] everything. He just tells them what he
[45:01] wants them to know. See, and God was
[45:05] working out a plan for them then. And he
[45:08] had worked it worked in it. And God, if
[45:12] you will submit yourself to God, you got
[45:16] to make
[45:19] sure God will make it known to you and
[45:22] he will
[45:23] work right
[45:25] through your
[45:28] plan. Amen. Amen. If we turn to 2
[45:32] Colossians 32, I want to look at another
[45:36] believer
[45:37] here.
[45:49] Amen. He Hezekiah, King Hezekiah, and if
[45:53] you look at this, and I want to just
[45:55] give you some story, but if you read the
[45:57] whole chapter of 32, King Hezekiah was a
[46:00] believer, blessed of God, a Christian,
[46:04] did all sorts of things for God. But I
[46:06] want to show you something very peculiar
[46:08] in the
[46:09] Bible in verse two. I just I put some
[46:12] verses down at the beginning just to lay
[46:14] to show you how much he was blessed. And
[46:17] when Hezekiah saw that that the uh other
[46:20] country was come and that that they had
[46:22] proposed to fight against
[46:25] Jerusalem, he took counsel of his
[46:27] princes that they might the men of God
[46:29] might stop the water of the mountains.
[46:33] The fountains, sorry.
[46:36] which were without the city. And they
[46:38] did, and they helped them. And let's go
[46:39] to verse 12. And hath not the same
[46:42] Hezekiah taken away the high places, and
[46:45] his altars, and had commanded Jordan and
[46:48] Jerusalem, saying that thou shalt
[46:51] worship before one altar, and burn
[46:54] incense upon
[46:56] it. And then if let's just drop to 22.
[46:59] And the Lord saved King Hezekiah and the
[47:03] inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand
[47:05] of of these
[47:07] enemies and from the hand of the other
[47:09] and guided them on every side. In verse
[47:12] 23, and they brought many gifts of the
[47:15] Lord to Jerusalem and presented them to
[47:17] King Hezekiah in Judah, so that he was
[47:22] manifest manifested in the sight of all
[47:25] the
[47:26] nations from
[47:28] henceforth. But I'm going to show you.
[47:30] So, so King
[47:32] Hezekiah was a total 100% believer of
[47:36] God, obeying God. God had blessed him
[47:39] multiple times. If you read that whole
[47:40] chapter, he got sick. God raised him up,
[47:42] protected him from the enemies. You
[47:45] know, King Hezekiah was serving one God
[47:47] and all these things. Amen. And if we
[47:49] jump down to verse 30, and the same
[47:52] Hezekiah also stopped up the upper water
[47:55] courses uh and he brought straight down
[47:58] the side, the west side of the city of
[48:00] David. And King Hezekiah proposed all of
[48:04] his works. But watch what happened in
[48:08] verse 31. This is a very, very peculiar
[48:13] story. And just for time, if you went
[48:16] back and you read all this, it would lay
[48:18] it out. I mean, I've studied the
[48:20] chapter. But how be it the in business
[48:24] that the ambassadors of the prince of
[48:27] Balum were sent on to him to inquire of
[48:31] the wonders of
[48:34] God.
[48:35] Wow. That was done in the land. So here
[48:39] all the other countries were coming
[48:41] around and saying, "Wow, you have an
[48:43] amazing real God." And we can't believe
[48:47] what he's done in your
[48:52] life. And God left
[48:55] him. Wait a minute. That's not in the
[49:02] Bible. And God left him.
[49:06] I thought the Bible said that God would
[49:07] never leave us nor forsake
[49:12] us. And God left
[49:16] him to try
[49:18] him that he might know
[49:22] all that was in his
[49:25] heart. See, God never really left him.
[49:29] But God wanted to know, are you a son or
[49:32] are you a daughter? You know, the Bible
[49:34] says that every son and daughter of God,
[49:36] he's got to prove. Do you know who I am?
[49:39] Am I do you know in in difficulties and
[49:42] afflictions, do you know I'm still the
[49:44] same person?
[49:46] That's why, you know, today on Just the
[49:48] Natural, a good way to say it is, you
[49:50] know, if you see somebody that was uh
[49:53] given everything they want, they call
[49:54] them a silver
[49:56] spoon. Some kids are silver spoons. They
[49:58] were never they were just given anytime
[50:00] they asked for a toy, they got it. They
[50:03] got their own way. Another old fashioned
[50:05] way would be say a good oldfashioned
[50:08] brat. But God won't have no brats in
[50:11] heaven. Amen.
[50:16] Let's look at some examples of our
[50:18] prophet here. He said, brother Bram
[50:19] said, he said in his life story, he
[50:22] said, "Oh my," he
[50:23] said, "the it was here's where I made my
[50:28] mistakes, friends.
[50:30] Now I want to I want to just step in
[50:32] here and some of these examples brother
[50:33] Brown gives. You don't have to make a
[50:35] mistake for God to be silent. You could
[50:38] be
[50:43] pure but God will still be silent in
[50:46] different times of our
[50:48] life. But in this case he said here's
[50:51] where I made my mistakes friends. I
[50:53] listened to my mother-in-law instead of
[50:55] listening to God. And if I would have
[50:58] went ahead then and this great thing
[51:00] would have been manifested before
[51:04] this and he was talking about his
[51:07] mother-in-law didn't want him to go to
[51:08] the Pentecostal people and so he said
[51:11] but because I listened my mistake was
[51:14] listening to somebody else and that's
[51:16] where all my sorrow started. I want to
[51:19] show you a couple examples of our
[51:22] prophet and
[51:24] uh and just show you different uh
[51:28] stories of how God was silent in our
[51:30] day. And I know there's different times
[51:33] that we'll see, but I I want to go
[51:35] through his life. He said, "Here, my
[51:36] baby was lying in the
[51:38] hospital sick." And he said, "I got down
[51:42] and I said, God, there lays my daddy.
[51:44] His daddy had died. His brother had
[51:46] died.
[51:48] And the flowers were still on their
[51:51] grave. And there lies hope. His wife had
[51:54] died lying
[51:56] yonder. And his baby was sick in the
[51:59] hospital
[52:00] dying. And brother
[52:03] Bram said,
[52:05] "Lord, don't take
[52:07] her." And he said it was like God just
[52:10] pulled the
[52:12] curtain. As if to say, now this is what
[52:15] the prophet said. as if God said to him,
[52:19] "Shut
[52:20] up. I don't even want to
[52:23] hear
[52:25] you at all." And he wouldn't even talk
[52:29] to me. Now, you know that story is
[52:32] better as good or better than I. But he
[52:34] said when that happened, that's when
[52:37] Satan came on the
[52:39] scene. And he said, "Satan come on." And
[52:42] he said, he
[52:45] said, well, the prophet actually says,
[52:47] he said, then it was Satan's turn. And
[52:49] that was God proving his prophet that he
[52:52] was a real son. And he said, Satan told
[52:55] him some things that were
[52:58] truthful. Satan will always have a lot
[53:00] of truth. He said, I thought you said
[53:03] that God was a good God.
[53:07] He
[53:10] said, "That's all this. What's all this
[53:14] that you've been hollering about
[53:15] preaching that God's a good God and
[53:18] you're just a boy?" And he said, "Look
[53:20] around you." He said, "All over the
[53:23] city." He said, "Every girl and boy from
[53:25] every association thinks that you've
[53:27] lost your mind because brother Bam was
[53:31] so
[53:32] consumed and following God and
[53:34] preaching." And he said, 'I sat there
[53:37] all night and all day and I said that to
[53:39] God and he said, 'What have I done, God?
[53:42] Show me, Lord, and don't let this
[53:45] innocent girl, boy, sorry, have to
[53:48] suffer and all these people suffer
[53:50] because I've done wrong. He said, tell
[53:52] me what I've done and I'll go make it
[53:56] right. And Satan said, "What have I?"
[54:00] Satan was telling him how he had
[54:02] preached all day and all night and give
[54:04] himself his life constantly for God.
[54:08] Satan said, "That's right." He said,
[54:09] "You said now," he said, "when it comes
[54:11] to you," he said, "you told all those
[54:13] people that you believe that he's a
[54:15] great
[54:16] healer. Where's your great healer that
[54:18] you were preaching about?" He said,
[54:20] "There lays your baby and your wife's
[54:23] dad." And he said he God
[54:26] refused to hear him. His wife was
[54:33] dad. And the story goes on. He said, and
[54:36] here's brother Bram listening to God.
[54:38] And he and because brother, you watch
[54:41] this. When Satan comes and tempts you,
[54:43] Satan will tell you the
[54:46] truth. He'll say, "Those people
[54:48] mistreated you." And you can say, "Yep,
[54:51] they sure did." And he'll say, you know,
[54:54] God ain't corrected this. You know,
[54:56] vengeance is mine, sayaith the Lord. He
[54:57] said, yep, nope. God ain't made it
[54:59] right. See, Satan will tell you all
[55:02] kinds of
[55:04] truth. Say, but they're not worthy to
[55:06] serve you. And you say, "Yep, no, that's
[55:08] right. I definitely I know their
[55:10] parents. I remember when they were
[55:12] born." See, Satan's telling you all the
[55:16] truth. And brother said, he said, "I
[55:19] began to listen to him." And he said, It
[55:22] was truth he was telling me. And he
[55:24] said, "I reasoned through that thought."
[55:26] He said, "That's right." And he said,
[55:27] "As much as you've done for God," and he
[55:30] said, "Yet he's doing this to
[55:34] you." He said, "That's right." He said,
[55:36] "I began to think of it." And he said,
[55:38] "Well, what?" He said, "You see,
[55:41] everything began to break away." And
[55:44] then when it came in, it come in like
[55:47] reasoning. But he said, "What was it
[55:49] then?
[55:53] It stayed there and it just was ready to
[55:55] say he said and brother Bam
[55:58] says the reasoning was so strong. Watch
[56:02] this. This prophet says this so strong
[56:04] and so true. Brother Bam said his exact
[56:08] words then was then I'll
[56:13] quit. Can you imagine our prophet saying
[56:16] then I'll just
[56:17] quit. But see, God had to try. Everybody
[56:21] has to know. You know, God's omnipotent,
[56:24] but he'll let you prove your own
[56:26] testimony. God knew that Brother Bram
[56:28] was qualified to be a deacon. God knew
[56:31] that Brother Bram loved him. God knew
[56:32] that Brother Bram was predestinated. God
[56:34] knew that he was called before the
[56:36] foundation of the world, but he still
[56:37] tested him.
[56:41] And I said, "That's right." And I began
[56:43] to think that then I'll just quit. And
[56:46] then he said, "I got down to the
[56:48] reasoning powers and it
[56:50] broke." And he said, "It came to that
[56:53] eternal life, that new birth." And he
[56:56] said, "That's what hung me held me
[56:58] there." And then I thought, "What? What
[57:01] am I? What am I
[57:05] anyway?" He said, "That I would
[57:08] question
[57:10] Jehovah. Who am I to question the
[57:13] creator that created me on this very
[57:16] earth? Where did I even get that baby
[57:21] from? She's not He's not
[57:24] mine. Anyway, God just loaned
[57:29] me my
[57:33] baby. And the prophet said, "And Satan,
[57:36] get away from me." And you know the
[57:38] story. He went on
[57:40] and and he was, you know, rebuked Satan
[57:44] and and everything changed. Is the life
[57:47] worthy of the gospel? Amen. God's trying
[57:50] us to see if our life is worthy of the
[57:53] gospel. Even though he already knew that
[57:55] Brother Bram's life was worthy of the
[57:58] gospel.
[58:01] Amen. Amen. Let's just look at another
[58:05] example here of our prophet before we
[58:07] close here. Brother Bram was talking. He
[58:10] was invited to a camp meeting. I'll give
[58:13] you the the message when we get to the
[58:15] bottom here. And brother Bram was having
[58:17] a big camp meeting. God was moving in
[58:19] his in his ministry tremendously. I
[58:22] mean, he was literally, you know, the
[58:24] story completely. And brother Bram got
[58:26] there and God closed his throat and he
[58:30] couldn't talk. And he had all the
[58:32] believers of brother Bam that was around
[58:33] him. He had confidence. Brothers with
[58:36] the literally with the baptism of the
[58:38] Holy Ghost come and pray for him. And
[58:40] and they came and and God was
[58:45] silent. And they brought him medication
[58:48] to take for his voice. And many of the
[58:51] brethren come in and famous brethren and
[58:53] prayed for him. And he names them. And
[58:55] I'm just slipping through this. Amen.
[58:58] And brother Brown began to question. And
[58:59] he said, "Why would God set up the camp
[59:03] meeting, do all the money for the
[59:06] preparation, bring all the people to
[59:08] drive
[59:09] here, and I can't
[59:13] talk, and I can't talk."
[59:17] And brother Brum got his wife and he
[59:20] says, "Isn't it good to have such a s a
[59:24] wonderful
[59:25] wife, a real wife, a real companion?"
[59:29] And he said, "She sat down beside me."
[59:31] Now, Brother Bram had been above the
[59:33] campaign was the end of the week, so
[59:35] he'd been sick all
[59:36] week, and it's time for him to
[59:40] minister. He hadn't done nothing wrong.
[59:43] His wife sat down and she was real close
[59:47] to him and he said,
[59:48] "Ma, I wonder
[59:52] sometimes. I wonder what's the
[59:56] matter. Why would God do all this
[59:58] meetings in
[1:00:00] preparation? Why would God call him to
[1:00:02] send out a message to call us out
[1:00:05] of Amen Leosia the
[1:00:10] denominations? I mean, call us into
[1:00:12] Christ. And he said, I laid there and he
[1:00:15] said, I was talking to my
[1:00:19] wife. God wasn't answering his
[1:00:24] prayer. Now, Brother Brown would have
[1:00:26] went out in that campaign and repeatedly
[1:00:29] by the hundreds, God would have answered
[1:00:31] his
[1:00:32] prayer. But behind closed doors on his
[1:00:36] own
[1:00:36] life, God was
[1:00:39] silent. And he said, "All the believers
[1:00:42] have come and prayed for
[1:00:45] me." No
[1:00:47] answer. He got medication from the
[1:00:51] hospital. No
[1:00:54] cure. And he said, "I said something to
[1:00:56] my wife." He said, "Sometimes I wonder
[1:01:01] if God even called
[1:01:06] me." I would say, Brother Brandham was
[1:01:08] fairly low.
[1:01:11] Amen.
[1:01:12] Amen. And his wife came back. She said,
[1:01:15] "You ought to be ashamed of yourself."
[1:01:19] She told me, she said, "Billy, don't you
[1:01:21] know God better than that? God knows
[1:01:24] exactly what he's doing." He said, "You
[1:01:25] just be
[1:01:28] quiet." Brother Bram said, "His wife
[1:01:30] rebuked me huge." And brother Bram seen
[1:01:33] a vision of how the people that were
[1:01:35] around him working in the
[1:01:38] church in the
[1:01:41] message had too much influence on his
[1:01:44] life and they were going to come. He God
[1:01:48] gave him a vision. A vision broke after
[1:01:50] his wife slapped him
[1:01:53] up. And he seen three people coming and
[1:01:57] God said, "Those people are going to
[1:01:59] come and tell you that they have thus
[1:02:02] sayaith the
[1:02:03] Lord for you to go do such and
[1:02:07] such." And he said,
[1:02:09] "They're very sincere, but they're
[1:02:13] sincerely
[1:02:15] wrong." Amen.
[1:02:17] You know, we have to get our own
[1:02:19] experience from God. Amen. We have to
[1:02:21] know what God has for us. And God showed
[1:02:24] Brother Bam afterwards in this. He said,
[1:02:26] "You're you're too close to these
[1:02:28] brothers. You're too you're depended too
[1:02:31] much on them." You know, Brother Bam got
[1:02:34] his stomach disease that way that almost
[1:02:36] killed him. He listened to the brothers.
[1:02:39] The brothers knew that God was calling
[1:02:40] them to the thousands and God had given
[1:02:43] them a direct order to go to the 50.
[1:02:48] And brother Brennham actually fought him
[1:02:49] pretty hard on
[1:02:51] it. But the pressure was so
[1:02:54] great he disobeyed
[1:02:57] God.
[1:02:59] Amen. But there's what what God's saying
[1:03:02] is a silent
[1:03:04] God. Amen. Brother Kyle mentioned it
[1:03:07] even and it was beautiful. He said he
[1:03:09] said we're in the harvest time now. And
[1:03:12] you know they they say this as a farmer
[1:03:14] you know in the heat of the summer and
[1:03:16] in July or August when you get the
[1:03:19] abundance of rain that they talk about
[1:03:21] they say if you walk in the corn field
[1:03:23] you can hear it
[1:03:24] grow. You know on a regular basis when
[1:03:27] we would go away in July we'd come home
[1:03:29] and the corn would grow like we'd be
[1:03:31] gone 5 days the corn would grow 2 three
[1:03:34] feet. We would go and it wouldn't be in
[1:03:36] tossel and it would be in full tsel when
[1:03:38] we come home four or five days. Many
[1:03:41] times I knew when I would spray my corn
[1:03:43] before I would go to the Ohio camp. I'd
[1:03:45] say if I never get a spray before I come
[1:03:47] home in four
[1:03:49] days, I'd never drive in this
[1:03:52] field. But we're not living in that
[1:03:54] stage now. We're not in that
[1:03:58] season. It's not given. This message is
[1:04:00] not given to the
[1:04:02] world. The world never all came from
[1:04:06] God.
[1:04:09] And we're brother Brown preached a
[1:04:11] message. I can hear the sound of the
[1:04:15] combine and we're laying in the press of
[1:04:17] the presence of the sen. And you know I
[1:04:20] and I've I've mentioned this before many
[1:04:22] times in the past, but you know when the
[1:04:24] combine comes
[1:04:25] through, anything that's green or soft
[1:04:29] gets
[1:04:30] destroyed, gets smushed and it goes out
[1:04:33] the straw chopper. When I'll harvest my
[1:04:35] wheat this summer, you know, if there
[1:04:37] was a laid head that comes up, normally
[1:04:39] around where water lays, watch this.
[1:04:42] Watch this. Water is a type of the Holy
[1:04:45] Ghost. But if it h if it's so much of
[1:04:49] that water in the natural that the weed
[1:04:51] will come up late around the edge of the
[1:04:54] holes and it's real, but when the
[1:04:57] combine comes, it'll smush it and blow
[1:05:00] it out the back end because it hadn't
[1:05:02] had enough time in the
[1:05:05] sun. It had the Holy Ghost, but no sun.
[1:05:09] It had the water but not enough not
[1:05:12] enough long enough
[1:05:15] son. Amen. Amen. Amen. It it's it's it's
[1:05:19] just a mystery. And you know, you say,
[1:05:21] "God, why why
[1:05:25] can't God's God?" Amen. Why would why
[1:05:28] would you know, you just look in your
[1:05:30] own life and you you see people that you
[1:05:32] grew up with, Brother Gar any one of us.
[1:05:34] myself. I'm the youngest of eight kids
[1:05:37] and I'm here, but where's the eight?
[1:05:40] Amen. Why? Why? I Why they Amen. And and
[1:05:46] and we can ask God, but we can't demand
[1:05:48] of God. It's a mystery. It's just a
[1:05:51] mystery. But when when we come into the
[1:05:54] combine age, it's going to be pokey.
[1:05:58] Uh-oh. Sharp. You know, we when we would
[1:06:01] harvest wheat and we're bailing straw,
[1:06:03] it would get under our things and we
[1:06:05] would I can remember when we would
[1:06:07] square bail in the days that work was
[1:06:09] real and uh the straw when it's broke up
[1:06:12] will be like sharp thorns and we get
[1:06:15] little slivers of straw, just clean
[1:06:17] straw, perfectly clean, and it would get
[1:06:19] just a little bit of juice there or or
[1:06:22] whatever and you just slide that right
[1:06:24] out. A little juice or pus would come
[1:06:28] out. And many of you sitting right here
[1:06:31] have been poked with
[1:06:33] slivers and dry stuff
[1:06:36] because the it's at the harvest time and
[1:06:40] there ain't nothing very little soft in
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:44] harvest. But when that combine and you
[1:06:47] know the combine will take the very
[1:06:49] first thing that hits that combine
[1:06:51] besides cutting
[1:06:53] it is the beers and it beats a living
[1:06:56] tar right out of it.
[1:06:59] And that's like a silent God. He's
[1:07:02] pounding the life out of you because
[1:07:04] he's separate. Brother Brham said God's
[1:07:06] looking for separators. That's right.
[1:07:09] Separators. Amen. It's it's it's hard to
[1:07:12] understand. He's looking for separate
[1:07:14] and he's he's beating us
[1:07:17] up. But he had to to separate us. Wait a
[1:07:21] minute. Why did brother Brown had to
[1:07:22] move his whole family? God was beating
[1:07:25] him up because he was separating them
[1:07:26] for a commission.
[1:07:29] Why did if God hadn't beat me up, I
[1:07:31] wouldn't have left my my little holiness
[1:07:33] church that still down on Dawn Valley
[1:07:35] Road. And right, he had to he had to do
[1:07:38] the same thing to you. He had to beat
[1:07:40] you up to pull you
[1:07:42] out. But the valuable stuff goes in the
[1:07:45] bin.
[1:07:47] It goes in the
[1:07:49] garner. And it'll last for
[1:07:52] years because it don't go bad
[1:07:55] under silence. Because the things of the
[1:07:58] moisture of the world is all what would
[1:08:01] decay it are gone.
[1:08:05] Amen. It's it's a great
[1:08:08] mystery here in this this story. You
[1:08:11] know they said brother Bam was sincerely
[1:08:13] wrong and they showed it God showed
[1:08:16] brother Bam this mystery. He said you're
[1:08:18] you're staying this was a 60 quote go
[1:08:21] tell. And he said, "You're you're
[1:08:24] dependent too much on the people around
[1:08:26] you and and all these things, but but
[1:08:29] boy Abraham came so much. He he felt so
[1:08:32] separated from God. So separated he
[1:08:35] wondered if he even was. And it took his
[1:08:38] wife to shake
[1:08:41] him." Amen. And brother, I'm just
[1:08:44] finishing this quote here. And brother
[1:08:45] Bam
[1:08:47] said, he t Well, let me just go back
[1:08:49] enough to catch him. He said, 'I looked
[1:08:51] down and he said, there was waiting my
[1:08:54] new ministry to be confformed in you.'
[1:08:56] This is the angel. This is God telling
[1:08:58] him this. And he said, I've already
[1:09:00] confirmed it in you. I I want to tell
[1:09:03] you something. God's all if God is
[1:09:05] silent to you this morning, he has
[1:09:07] already confirmed your testimony and
[1:09:10] your baptism of your Holy Ghost inside
[1:09:13] you. He trusts you. He don't need to
[1:09:17] show you a show. And I mean, if if God
[1:09:19] does, we're happy. We're not going to
[1:09:21] deny anything that's God. But God's
[1:09:23] already proved that you're ready. You're
[1:09:25] at the state that he can say like Job
[1:09:28] said, "Though the skin worms eat my
[1:09:30] flesh, in my flesh I'll see God." It's
[1:09:33] it's it's a
[1:09:36] radical. He said, "God's already
[1:09:38] confirmed it to you. I've already
[1:09:41] confirmed it to you." He's he's talking
[1:09:43] to brother Brandham. He said, "It's
[1:09:44] already confirmed." He repeats it. He's
[1:09:47] talking about Brother Bram's ministry.
[1:09:49] But that would be the same as you
[1:09:50] getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:52] I've already confirmed it to you. I'm
[1:09:54] proving it to
[1:09:55] you. But he said, "You got to accept
[1:09:58] it." See, I stood there and I listened
[1:10:00] to God just a minute and it came down
[1:10:02] into my mind. He said, "I
[1:10:05] don't I didn't hear that and it was just
[1:10:09] to come into my mind." And he's he's
[1:10:11] going through this. Amen.
[1:10:14] He said it's like a man a sinner all his
[1:10:17] life and he knows that there's a Bible
[1:10:19] and he knows that there's a God but all
[1:10:21] at once he hears a sermon and something
[1:10:23] tells him and he says it's you. It's you
[1:10:26] that's got the baptism of Holy Ghost.
[1:10:28] And then that's that same word that's
[1:10:30] been there all along and it just
[1:10:33] confirms that you're one of them.
[1:10:39] And God said to brother Brown, he said,
[1:10:41] "You got to accept it the same
[1:10:44] way." He was talking to brother Brown
[1:10:47] about his commission. He said, "This was
[1:10:48] the third pull." He said, "You got to
[1:10:50] believe in it the same way." You know,
[1:10:53] when God if when God predestinated you,
[1:10:56] you we we did that a couple weeks ago,
[1:10:59] but you can prove that by your draw to
[1:11:01] God. You didn't get up here and come to
[1:11:03] God on your own flesh desire. The Bible
[1:11:05] proves it that all flesh ran from God.
[1:11:09] So something supernatural drew you to
[1:11:11] God. It wasn't flesh. It was a
[1:11:12] predestinated seed.
[1:11:15] Amen. But you got to believe in it. And
[1:11:17] he said, watch what the watch what he
[1:11:19] said. Brother Brandham answered God. He
[1:11:21] said, I was
[1:11:22] afraid of
[1:11:25] defeat. Some of us that had the probably
[1:11:27] all of us have had the baptism of the
[1:11:29] Holy Ghost. We make mistakes every day.
[1:11:30] Paul made mistakes every day. say, "I'm
[1:11:33] afraid to say I got the Holy Ghost in
[1:11:34] case I make a mistake." And Satan, come
[1:11:37] and tell me. Cuz it'd be the truth what
[1:11:38] Satan would tell you. Well, you fell
[1:11:40] down, Dale. You shouldn't have treated
[1:11:41] them like that. Yeah, you're right.
[1:11:43] Yeah. You're not worthy and you ain't
[1:11:45] got it yet. Say liar. I just proved I
[1:11:48] did. I just proved I did. I'm still
[1:11:51] living in a fleshly body, but you're a
[1:11:53] liar. And you tell me I don't got it. I
[1:11:54] do got it. Amen. He said, "I was afraid
[1:11:57] of defeat anyway. And I was afraid to
[1:11:59] bring reproach on the
[1:12:01] church." Many people that get the
[1:12:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost say, "I'm
[1:12:05] afraid to say I'm I'm one of them. I'm
[1:12:07] predestinated." All because I'm still
[1:12:09] living in a human body. This human body
[1:12:11] will disappoint each other every day of
[1:12:13] the week. I've probably disappointed you
[1:12:15] a whole bunch already today. And you'll
[1:12:17] be disappointed. That's just
[1:12:19] flesh. But we got to look past our flesh
[1:12:22] into our supernatural predestinated
[1:12:24] seed. Amen. Now, I don't mean we should
[1:12:27] go around trying to do that. But if
[1:12:29] you're breathing today, most of you
[1:12:32] husbands have already disappointed your
[1:12:33] wife or your wives have disappointed
[1:12:35] you. I mean, that's just life.
[1:12:38] Amen. He said, "I was afraid of the
[1:12:40] reproach. I was also afraid of watching,
[1:12:44] seeing I was afraid of watching and
[1:12:47] thinking that I would call the thing
[1:12:49] wrong because I took a warning out of
[1:12:51] the Bible how Moses was given great
[1:12:53] power." So, Brother Brown here, he's
[1:12:56] recognizing the responsibility of God's
[1:12:58] word. And so, he gives us a couple
[1:13:00] examples here. He said, "Here, brother
[1:13:02] Moses had the full power of God." And
[1:13:05] God told him to speak to the rock, and
[1:13:07] Moses struck it
[1:13:08] twice. And he said, "I was afraid of
[1:13:11] being Moses." But I want to tell you
[1:13:13] this morning, God's given you the
[1:13:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you don't
[1:13:17] need to be afraid of being his people.
[1:13:20] You don't need to be afraid of your
[1:13:21] testimony. It's God that will hold your
[1:13:24] testimony. God's not really concerned
[1:13:26] about all this flesh, the badger skin.
[1:13:29] The badger skin will come and
[1:13:31] go, but he knows that you were in the
[1:13:33] thoughts of God. When you get the
[1:13:34] revelation that you're in the thoughts
[1:13:35] of God, even if you make a mistake
[1:13:37] before the day's out, that don't change
[1:13:39] that destiny at all. He said, I was
[1:13:42] afraid to be like Moses. He was given
[1:13:43] great power and spoke the rock. And he
[1:13:45] said, "Remember Elijah bec the because
[1:13:48] he was baldhead the kids come out and
[1:13:51] called him a baldy and he cursed the
[1:13:52] boys and the 42 boys." Brother man said,
[1:13:55] "I don't want to do
[1:13:58] that. That wasn't the Holy Spirit that
[1:14:00] killed those
[1:14:01] boys." But he said it was a prophet, an
[1:14:04] angry prophet. And he said, "I went
[1:14:06] through this all the time thinking I'm
[1:14:08] going to make mistakes." Brother Brown
[1:14:09] was afraid of making mistakes. So he
[1:14:12] wanted to
[1:14:14] hide, but we can't
[1:14:16] hide. Amen. And he said, I was here.
[1:14:21] Let's just go. Then we're going to
[1:14:22] finish on this. And there he stood
[1:14:24] there, God stood talking to me. And he
[1:14:26] said, but you've walked too many times
[1:14:29] with these too many people around you.
[1:14:32] And he said, you got to walk with me
[1:14:34] alone. You got to listen to me alone.
[1:14:37] And there they seen him. He here's
[1:14:40] brother B uh God telling brother Bham he
[1:14:42] said you're trying to please all the
[1:14:45] churches and all the
[1:14:47] denominations but he said you got to
[1:14:49] follow me in your ministry. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:53] A silent God. Many many times and the
[1:14:57] first thing Satan will come and tell us
[1:14:59] when God's
[1:15:01] silent is I thought you
[1:15:04] said I thought your confession was that
[1:15:06] God was a healer. But now he's silent.
[1:15:08] You won't even heal your wife. I thought
[1:15:10] you said you had the Holy Ghost, but you
[1:15:12] just made that mistake.
[1:15:14] I thought you got angry and you How
[1:15:16] could you be angry and have the Holy
[1:15:18] Ghost? Remember this, church. When Satan
[1:15:21] comes back to accuse the brethren, he'll
[1:15:24] bring a lot of truth, maybe even 100%
[1:15:28] truth. But he's seeing But Satan's
[1:15:31] seeing the badger skin
[1:15:34] and God's seeing the blood.
[1:15:37] Satan's seeing your badger skin. If you
[1:15:39] want to look at Brother Dale's badger
[1:15:40] skin, oh buddy, you don't love to look
[1:15:42] behind your side. You can look at the
[1:15:44] best side. You'll see lots of badger
[1:15:45] skin.
[1:15:48] But God's looking at the blood. He's
[1:15:50] looking at the seed.
[1:15:53] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:15:57] stand. A silent God.
[1:16:01] You know, brother Bam said that whether
[1:16:05] God, you know, he talked about it in
[1:16:07] riches. He said prosperity and wealth
[1:16:10] and even gifts, gifts and callings are
[1:16:14] without repentance. And so sometimes we
[1:16:16] see, you know, if God was blessing you
[1:16:19] with wealth or or houses and land, you
[1:16:22] think, "Oh, well, see, I'm I'm doing
[1:16:24] everything right. I'm paying I'm
[1:16:26] supporting God's kingdom." and and and
[1:16:28] it very well could be that way, but it
[1:16:31] don't necessarily prosperity or wealth
[1:16:33] or even gifts. You could have you could
[1:16:36] prophesy all day long and and see
[1:16:39] visions and all that and there'll be
[1:16:40] many people like that. Gifts and
[1:16:43] callings, the ministry we we tend to in
[1:16:46] the flesh will lift up a a tremendous
[1:16:48] ministry with a tremendous delivery and
[1:16:50] a tremendous anointing of God. It's the
[1:16:53] anointing of God.
[1:16:58] But it's without repentance. Amen. We
[1:17:00] can't put nothing between us and God.
[1:17:02] Amen.
[1:17:04] Amen. God help us to recognize when
[1:17:08] God's silent, he's just
[1:17:13] proven to the world that you still
[1:17:16] believe.
[1:17:18] He's just proven to the world that you
[1:17:20] still believe. You know, the ones that
[1:17:22] are not
[1:17:23] predestinated when God's silent
[1:17:27] will leave.
[1:17:31] We'll leave
[1:17:33] guaranteed
[1:17:35] 100%. Amen. When God's
[1:17:38] silent, they'll leave. God, help us to
[1:17:42] God help us to look past the natur the
[1:17:45] nature of I'm not saying we should re
[1:17:47] love and respect each other. I I I we
[1:17:49] all know that that's kindergarten. But
[1:17:52] we need to look past that and say, Amen.
[1:17:55] and see the eternal value, the eternal
[1:17:57] life that's represented there. Amen.
[1:18:02] See, try to see the predestinated
[1:18:05] seed in your brother or sister's life
[1:18:08] and the badger skin will become a lot
[1:18:11] less focused. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:17] Amen. Thank you, Lord
[1:18:21] Jesus. Amen.
[1:18:25] Thank you
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:29] Lord. Thank you Lord
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:37] Jesus. Thank you
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:43] Jesus.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:50] Mhm. Mhm.
[1:18:55] more than
[1:18:57] ever. May for the
[1:19:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:54] [Applause]
[1:20:03] God. Hallelujah.
[1:20:12] Lord Jesus, the words of these
[1:20:16] songs, I know that they radiate every
[1:20:19] person in this building, Lord Jesus, I
[1:20:21] believe
[1:20:23] that, Lord, that more than ever before,
[1:20:27] however you decide to bring this harvest
[1:20:30] to fulfillment, Lord
[1:20:34] God, Lord, we know that the Bible says
[1:20:36] says that everything that can be
[1:20:39] shaken will be
[1:20:42] shaken.
[1:20:44] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we love you
[1:20:48] abundantly. And Lord, we thank you for
[1:20:51] all the wonders that you've done in our
[1:20:54] midst. And Lord, if there's a time or if
[1:20:57] it seems like there's a time in any one
[1:20:59] of our lives or even in the church that
[1:21:02] we go through a quiet
[1:21:05] time, it's just laying deep roots down,
[1:21:09] deep teaching to show that when the
[1:21:11] winds of false doctrine
[1:21:14] come, that we'll stand straight in the
[1:21:17] test of time. Lord God, I pray that
[1:21:20] you'll help each one of us in this end
[1:21:22] time that we're living in. It's about
[1:21:25] going home time. Lord God, we pray. We
[1:21:28] know we can see the signs. You'd have to
[1:21:30] You'd have to
[1:21:32] be completely
[1:21:34] foolish to not recognize what's
[1:21:37] happening. Lord
[1:21:39] God, help me.
[1:21:42] Jesus, help me. Lord Jesus, always we
[1:21:46] pray that
[1:21:47] you're the capstone over our lives. Lord
[1:21:50] God, bless these wonderful, kind
[1:21:53] friends, brothers and sisters of ours
[1:21:56] and all that are sick. Lord God, we pray
[1:21:59] for healing in their life. And the ones
[1:22:01] that are away visiting and traveling,
[1:22:03] may they have a wonderful blessed blitz
[1:22:07] time. Lord
[1:22:08] God, we love you with all of our
[1:22:11] hearts. In your name we pray.
[1:22:15] Amen. Amen. We're going to sing that
[1:22:17] again. And I just have an announcement,
[1:22:19] maybe a
[1:22:20] short announcement if you don't mind
[1:22:25] standing. We're at the point of going
[1:22:28] home. Amen. Amen. And I'm going to show
[1:22:33] you the state of the
[1:22:36] world. Mark Carney that's running for
[1:22:39] the Canadian
[1:22:42] election. You know, it don't matter who
[1:22:44] wins. God's in control.
[1:22:47] Brother Dale's not telling you politics.
[1:22:49] I'm showing you the time of the
[1:22:51] rapture. He has said
[1:22:53] that he has clearly stated that what
[1:22:56] Canada needs is a world economic form
[1:22:59] and that is that you will own nothing
[1:23:02] and be
[1:23:03] happy. He's actually clearly stated
[1:23:07] that. And the first bill that he passed
[1:23:10] when he was appointed, this will affect
[1:23:13] you.
[1:23:14] You might not think it'll affect you.
[1:23:16] It'll affect you. The very first bill
[1:23:18] that the Liberals passed was that they
[1:23:20] are going to get rid of all
[1:23:22] charitable
[1:23:24] receipts. They are going to take away
[1:23:26] all charitable
[1:23:28] HST and in many cases they are going to
[1:23:32] reclaim the charitable property from the
[1:23:36] churches. I have the Fibio audit. I sent
[1:23:39] that to other pastors and they actually
[1:23:41] looked it up and vindicated it. It's
[1:23:43] proven. If we have a liberal government,
[1:23:46] you're done getting a charable receipt.
[1:23:49] You're done getting the taxes back. And
[1:23:51] in many cases, the people that you know
[1:23:53] that the churches is in the church name,
[1:23:56] the government will take that. Now, you
[1:23:58] don't have to lose fear because it'll
[1:24:01] only be a year or two and they're coming
[1:24:03] for your
[1:24:05] house because he's clearly said that you
[1:24:09] owe
[1:24:10] nothing and be
[1:24:13] happy. We're at the point of going home.
[1:24:18] We We have to leave this
[1:24:20] place. We're not concerned about money.
[1:24:24] money. I mean, we just need enough to
[1:24:27] stay warm in the winter and a little bit
[1:24:28] to eat. But we can't
[1:24:32] survive what's going to come on this
[1:24:34] world. You can't survive a world
[1:24:36] economic world cuz that's a one world
[1:24:38] government. We won't be here. So, we're
[1:24:41] not concerned. If the liberals get in,
[1:24:43] we'll just say, "Praise the Lord. It's
[1:24:44] going to be really
[1:24:45] soon." Amen. I'm not preaching fear. I'm
[1:24:48] just bringing this to reality. You know,
[1:24:50] I showed that to some believers, and
[1:24:52] Jared was one He said, "Dad, I just
[1:24:54] cannot
[1:24:56] believe that you have that
[1:25:00] imprint. God is telling
[1:25:03] you. You got just a little bit of
[1:25:07] time. A little bit. If you think that
[1:25:10] they take every church and property
[1:25:13] that's registered under a church church
[1:25:15] organization that they're not coming for
[1:25:18] your
[1:25:19] house, you have your head stuck in the
[1:25:22] sand. so far that you're an
[1:25:28] ostrich.
[1:25:31] Amen. Remember, Brother Bram said, "It's
[1:25:35] the living saints that ask Christ to
[1:25:39] come and take us out of here."
[1:25:42] I pray to God that every one of you
[1:25:44] living people will say, "God, get me out
[1:25:47] of this crazy pest house, including this
[1:25:50] crazy. Give me a new body and take me
[1:25:53] out of this. I can't
[1:25:55] survive this world." Amen. Help me,
[1:26:00] Jesus. And it's the living saints that
[1:26:03] will call them and the and we won't
[1:26:05] hinder the sleeping ones. They'll rise
[1:26:07] first and we'll all go together. But
[1:26:09] it's
[1:26:10] you that when you get good and fed up
[1:26:13] with this world, you'll say, "God, I'm
[1:26:17] finished. I'm completely
[1:26:20] finished. Get me out of
[1:26:23] here." Amen. God, help us. More than
[1:26:27] ever your distance before
