[44:25] hallelujah in the Book of Genesis chter
[44:27] 30 I just want to read from verse 37 to
[44:30] verse 39 and you may take your
[44:34] seats and the word of God says and this
[44:37] is about uh brother
[44:39] Jacob you know and no matter what you
[44:42] think about him but he was
[44:45] predestinated amen he
[44:48] was the greatest character in this Bible
[44:51] God used him for a
[44:53] purpose
[44:54] amen and Jacob took him rods of green
[44:59] papor and of the AEL and chestnut tree
[45:04] and peeled them and white strikes in
[45:07] them and made the white appear which is
[45:10] in the
[45:11] rods and he set the rods which he had
[45:15] peeled before the flocks and the gutters
[45:18] in the watering troughs when the flocks
[45:21] came to drink that they should conceive
[45:25] when they come to drink that's
[45:30] interesting and the flocks conceived
[45:33] before the rods and brought forth cattle
[45:37] ring straight speckled and
[45:42] spotted you heard that now jump look
[45:45] over to verse
[45:49] 25 and it came to pass when wael had
[45:52] born
[45:53] Joseph that Jacob said said unto laan
[45:57] send me away that I may go unto my own
[46:02] place I want to go
[46:05] home can I get some
[46:11] weakness I want to go to my own
[46:15] place I'm on the verge of going
[46:18] home and to my country I'm not from

[46:26] I'm I want to go to my home
[46:29] place
[46:30] Hallelujah God bless you be seated may
[46:34] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[46:35] of the word you know tonight as we we
[46:39] talk about in the and I'm sure we all
[46:42] realize what's happening around the
[46:43] world
[46:44] today in the heast all over the world
[46:48] there is war and rumors of War
[46:52] everywhere it's all over war and rumors
[46:55] of War heav aware and it is in the heart
[46:58] and desire of every true Sons and
[47:01] Daughters of God that you want to go
[47:04] home the governments are confused
[47:07] everything you you know there is no
[47:09] trust anymore you cannot trust a system
[47:12] you cannot trust the the medical system
[47:15] nothing at
[47:16] all and therefore there's something in
[47:19] the children of God just pulling us back
[47:22] to our own
[47:24] country I come from God and I'm going
[47:27] back to
[47:28] God hallelujah something in me putting
[47:32] me
[47:33] home and so we could look at a thought
[47:36] tonight if the Lord permit us when the
[47:39] Dynamics
[47:45] change when the Dynamics change not the
[47:49] mechanics leave them
[47:51] alone but when the Dynamics change and
[47:55] to
[47:56] understand this little Let's us lay a
[47:58] foundation here glory to God how how
[48:01] many minutes I got I trust amen tonight
[48:04] is not on a fast food thing we want to
[48:07] have a full course
[48:09] meal
[48:12] amen I'm at
[48:14] home is that right I'm at
[48:17] home the first time you know when I went
[48:20] to Ghana Brother D brother John and
[48:23] there's some service when I look at my
[48:25] clock it was like two and a half hours
[48:27] some
[48:29] service you know I don't used to that
[48:32] and so I I got he I I felt like I was
[48:37] European two and a half hours song
[48:39] service was getting real hot three hours
[48:42] they were just ready to
[48:44] worship and when I preach I preached two
[48:47] and a half hours and I was about to quit
[48:50] they said come on preach
[48:54] it
[48:56] glory to God I never preached so hard in
[48:59] my life it's the people that pulls a
[49:06] gift
[49:07] Hallelujah your hunger will determine
[49:10] how well you are
[49:12] fed and so if you're hungry there is a
[49:15] lot here for you to
[49:17] heat Oh Glory to God Amen your hunger
[49:23] amen will pull out the gift of God
[49:26] there is healing in God there is Miracle
[49:30] in God but it takes the people to pull
[49:34] it
[49:35] out
[49:37] Hallelujah glory to
[49:40] God and so we think about the changing
[49:43] of the Dynamics but let's just lay a
[49:46] foundation here a little bit Amen to
[49:49] know that Jacob you know the prophet
[49:52] taught us that Jacob knew the spiritual
[49:55] side of his
[49:57] lineage he knew it because he was 15
[50:01] years old when his grand father Abraham
[50:05] died so he knew it Hallelujah he was
[50:09] more spiritual than his brother Oh Glory
[50:12] to God and so he uh being a shan7 years
[50:17] old amen when he fled from his own
[50:20] country and working for his
[50:23] father-in-law for 20 years
[50:26] look at that you know and when you
[50:29] understand the whole thing is that he
[50:31] was just making his father-in-law
[50:37] rich but now he was saying you know give
[50:41] me my
[50:43] wages I need to Amen to start providing
[50:46] for my family now you know and laan said
[50:50] to him uh you know I really appreciate
[50:54] you because since you came my life was
[50:57] been
[50:58] blessed Hallelujah you know you know
[51:02] since you are here God bless me that's a
[51:07] presence of a True
[51:08] Believer amen when were oh
[51:11] Hallelujah sons of God you carry a
[51:20] blessing can you say Amen to that since
[51:23] you are here my business is
[51:26] flourishing glory to God but anyway amen
[51:30] Jacob said I want to provide for my own
[51:33] family because he was not ready to go
[51:36] home he was on the verge of the
[51:39] departing home
[51:41] Hallelujah and so he said to laan his
[51:45] father-in-law he said let's make a deal
[51:49] you see all the animals you got and the
[51:52] cattles you have I want us I I want you
[51:55] to give me all the the
[51:58] streaks the the spotted ones let me have
[52:03] those glory to God he's all right but
[52:07] then notice the males there were males
[52:12] in the flock that were
[52:13] spotted oh yeah read
[52:16] it so what laan did the first that same
[52:19] day he took out all the spotted males
[52:24] all the Rings straight males and gave it
[52:27] to his sons because you and I know that
[52:31] from the male you are likely to get some
[52:35] kides looking like the
[52:39] males oh go GL to God
[52:43] hallelujah and so the very same day he
[52:46] took out all the males and then he said
[52:49] okay Jacob the deal is
[52:54] on so there was no more 5050
[52:59] Church hallelujah oh
[53:02] god oh I'm preaching church so the deal
[53:07] is on I like this and Jacob now oh God
[53:11] you know what amen Jacob the Bible said
[53:15] Jacob took some po
[53:19] sticks Asian nut
[53:22] sticks and Chestnut sticks sir
[53:26] he never created the
[53:29] sticks they were always
[53:36] there he never changed the
[53:40] mechanics the same
[53:42] males the same
[53:45] females but he was going to change the
[53:49] Dynamics woo
[53:51] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[53:56] amen the bocks were the same the effers
[54:00] were the same the Rams were the same the
[54:04] use were the same but something is going
[54:07] to change it takes the Dynamics to bring
[54:12] forth the production hallelujah
[54:15] hallelujah glory to God God work with
[54:20] Dynamics to bring forth the production
[54:24] now Jacob never randomly picked sticks
[54:27] he picked those sticks
[54:30] particular the popular was a special
[54:33] word
[54:34] hallelujah can I preach this
[54:38] Hallelujah it was
[54:40] colorless it was
[54:43] oderless and it was
[54:45] tasteless but the ideal material it had
[54:49] a peculiar look to it the prophet says
[54:53] when the animals look up the popular
[54:56] stick it frightened
[54:57] them it created something on the
[55:02] inside oh
[55:05] hallelujah
[55:07] amen but the Haan not tree amen the
[55:11] animals love it they love the leaves
[55:14] they love even the dry
[55:16] Twigs even Birds would pick up the dry
[55:20] Twigs oh
[55:22] Hallelujah and he would put it there
[55:24] while why it attract the
[55:31] animals it attract them to the water
[55:34] trough the water trough never change the
[55:38] water never change glory to God but
[55:42] something is going to
[55:44] change
[55:45] hallelujah what you keep looking at is
[55:48] what you
[55:54] produce
[55:56] something is on the
[55:58] inside something is being
[56:00] created but then the they man the
[56:03] chestnut tree you know what about the
[56:06] chestnut it
[56:08] carries
[56:10] some medicinal
[56:14] properties it carries a lot of
[56:17] minerals and a lot of vitamin
[56:20] K that says that it was good for both
[56:25] own
[56:26] development it was good for
[56:30] diarrhea it was good for coughing so Not
[56:35] only was he attracting them Not only was
[56:39] he shocking their
[56:41] minds but he was creating another
[56:46] generation on the
[56:48] inside oh
[56:50] Hallelujah somebody never see this
[56:53] coming Hal Hallelujah but after Moses
[56:57] left God was creating another
[57:02] generation to take the
[57:11] promise he changed the
[57:13] Dynamics and the Bible said in verse
[57:17] 43 he says the man
[57:21] increases production increases
[57:25] oh
[57:26] Hallelujah and the countenance of Labor
[57:34] change but he said I got to go home I'm
[57:38] going home but the Dynamics
[57:41] changes leave the mechanics alone you
[57:45] understanding the
[57:46] foundation now notice
[57:50] this watch the ministry of Jesus Christ
[57:56] as he turned water into
[57:58] wine at the pleading of his mother it
[58:02] was noise
[58:03] abroad people like to follow
[58:06] signs is that right people are
[58:10] excited about signs and
[58:15] miracles belief
[58:18] increases among many
[58:20] Jews especially when the her he was a
[58:23] Jew
[58:27] crowd
[58:28] increases everybody want to be a part of
[58:31] this
[58:31] movement
[58:33] Hallelujah after he raised the
[58:36] bars in the word and getting deeper into
[58:39] the word when he showed him in John
[58:42] chapter
[58:43] 6:48 when he showed him that he was the
[58:46] bread of
[58:48] life
[58:49] Hallelujah and we said to them amen
[58:53] unless you hate me
[58:55] you have no
[58:57] life unless you drink my
[59:00] blood how can you understand this amen

[59:26] Prophet is introducing us to heat
[59:32] him
[59:34] Hallelujah hey critics
[59:37] increases oh my and followers get less
[59:42] but yet there were some that would
[59:45] follow him a far
[59:47] off because John chapter 8 from verse
[59:51] 3132 Jesus said to those Jews that
[59:53] believe
[59:56] Hallelujah choose that
[59:58] believe if you continue in my word so
[1:00:04] they were
[1:00:10] Believers to those Jews that believe
[1:00:12] brothers and sisters so they were
[1:00:15] Believers Satan is a
[1:00:22] Believer can I preach
[1:00:26] Kain was a
[1:00:29] Believer
[1:00:32] Hallelujah Satan believed this

[1:01:02] in my word you shall be my disciples
[1:01:07] indeed and you shall know the truth woo
[1:01:11] Hallelujah but you need to continue you
[1:01:15] need to
[1:01:16] continue because you need to be made
[1:01:21] free Oh Glory to God

[1:01:30] right oh
[1:01:34] God but he's going
[1:01:36] higher as he changed from the public

[1:01:42] to you two Ministries public and private
[1:01:45] from John chapter 1 to John chapter 12
[1:01:48] verse 50 that was public but the private
