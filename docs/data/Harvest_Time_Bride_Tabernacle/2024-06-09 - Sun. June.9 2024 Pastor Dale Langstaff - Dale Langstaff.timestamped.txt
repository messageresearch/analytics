[30:47] Timothy I don't know if we can get our 1
[30:50] Timothy
[30:52] 3
[30:55] 16 amen without conscious rsy great is
[30:59] the m mystery of godliness where God was
[31:02] manifested in the flesh justified in the
[31:05] spirit seen of angels and preached unto
[31:08] the Gentiles believed in on in the world
[31:11] and received up into
[31:14] Glory Hallelujah let's turn over to
[31:17] another
[31:19] scripture
[31:22] amen just got to find it here Matthew 5
[31:26] and9 just one more
[31:29] scripture let's go
[31:31] along with our thought this morning
[31:34] amen Matthew 59 blessed are the
[31:38] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[31:42] children of God lord Jesus we ask you
[31:44] bless your word and and Lord we pray

[31:54] morning we pray in your beautiful name
[31:58] amen you may have your
[31:59] seats amen hallelujah you know we want
[32:03] to look at our first scripture and maybe
[32:04] you can leave that up on the screen 1
[32:06] Timothy 3 you know it says great with
[32:09] and without
[32:11] controversy great is the
[32:13] mystery of godliness and that word
[32:17] controversary means
[32:20] disagreement it typically
[32:22] means a prolonged and heeded argument
[32:28] it also means a long discussion an
[32:31] argument involving involving strong
[32:36] feelings of
[32:39] anger
[32:41] amen
[32:43] hallelujah a mystery let's just look at
[32:46] just to lay a foundation
[32:51] here let's look at a quote that a
[32:54] prophet said he said you know he said
[32:57] God Called Moses for his purpose and he
[33:01] thought surely the people of Israel
[33:03] would
[33:04] understand what he had sent him for but
[33:06] the people misunderstood
[33:08] Moses Jesus they couldn't believe he was
[33:13] God but they believed in God but they
[33:16] couldn't believe that he came from God
[33:17] he was
[33:18] God and it Disturbed them that when he
[33:21] said that he was equal with
[33:24] God they said how in the world could
[33:27] Jesus Jesus being illegitimate that was
[33:30] their
[33:31] testimony poor and born in a
[33:35] manger be connected to
[33:38] Elohim you see this mystery we're
[33:40] talking about he says listen this is our
[33:43] Prophet talking he said now listen here
[33:45] friends the more simpler you can be the
[33:49] more God can deal with you he said I'm
[33:52] not against education and education's
[33:54] all right we we need to be able to read
[33:56] and write he said but people get so
[33:59] highly educated till they think they
[34:01] know more about it than God
[34:04] does and when then you miss they miss
[34:07] the whole goal he said you got to forget
[34:10] everything you know in your own
[34:12] knowledge to know
[34:15] Christ he said well you just come like a
[34:18] childlike and accept him that's all he
[34:20] said that's the way you accept God and
[34:22] the more simply you can get and the more
[34:24] humbly you can get away from yourself
[34:26] and your own ey ideas and just let God's
[34:29] word take what it was meant for and
[34:32] believe it it's by faith those that
[34:35] come and watch what he says and he says
[34:39] not what not one of you can figure it
[34:42] out now now we're living in in a re in a
[34:46] day where the message came and revealed
[34:48] all the mysteries of the Bible and we're
[34:50] we're blessed before any more than any
[34:52] age ever and we have more understanding
[34:55] than that tremendously but how can your
[34:58] three-b brain op understand an
[35:00] omnipotent
[35:02] God
[35:03] Amen
[35:05] Hallelujah some things are just
[35:08] impossible he said you'll never this is
[35:10] our prophecy Moses he said you'll never
[35:13] be able to he said there's never been a
[35:16] man on Earth no saint nor no one has
[35:20] ever figure God
[35:24] out whoa you can't he said so don't
[35:28] think that you can do something that
[35:31] they cannot do cuz it can't be and
[35:35] that's right you just believe him and
[35:38] that's what he wants you to do to figure
[35:41] him out you know I I mentioned that this
[35:44] was a
[35:45] mystery and even us being here today
[35:48] we're going to go to Burlington Lord
[35:50] willing after service
[35:53] and and you know we went to a wedding
[35:55] yesterday for my niece and and uh we got
[35:58] a nice shower of rain yesterday evening
[36:01] and last night and through the night and
[36:04] so I had been talking with Junior
[36:06] through the
[36:07] week and you know I had a message
[36:09] prepared for today and which is going to
[36:12] be Father's Day message Lord willing
[36:15] next week and and Junior had told me he
[36:18] said if it rains he said I'll be here
[36:20] and so he sent me a message in the
[36:22] wedding and he said he said D I'm
[36:23] putting tomatoes I won't be there and me
[36:26] and Lan almost got soak drenched leaving
[36:29] the wedding I mean it was Noah's
[36:32] Ark I called Junior up and they said
[36:35] Junior it's not
[36:37] raining he said no it's not raining at
[36:41] all I said that's
[36:44] unbelievable and I said well okay see it
[36:49] was a
[36:50] mystery brother Dale had it in his head
[36:53] the brother Dale wouldn't be
[36:55] here see we're trying to figure God out
[36:59] we putting God in a box we say well our
[37:02] God's just exactly like this and that's
[37:05] his
[37:06] plan and so we were up early this
[37:09] morning Junior message me at 6:30 he
[37:12] said we got a teeny bit of rain but
[37:14] we're still planting
[37:17] tomatoes and so you
[37:19] know our girls sing that
[37:23] special and
[37:27] it's amazing how you can get so caught
[37:30] up and going home that it it just this
[37:34] world just it's it's
[37:36] like a foreign
[37:39] place you know and and and just the
[37:43] environment you know we've had a lot of
[37:44] quiet time because of the weather and
[37:47] I've been on my front porch and I've
[37:49] list listened to books of the Bible not
[37:52] just chapters books
[37:59] and this last
[38:04] week I'd go for Drive I I called my
[38:09] older
[38:10] brother that were friends with and I
[38:14] told my
[38:20] wife I said I sure wish I could go see
[38:24] that
[38:42] someday we
[38:43] will but you know if and many of you did
[38:47] if you had a dad like me he just had a
[38:50] way show
[38:52] up he wouldn't say nothing but it was
[38:55] just a calming atmosphere
[38:58] it was a
[39:00] stability it was an
[39:03] understanding that in the
[39:06] Mysteries that everything will be
[39:09] okay
[39:11] amen he couldn't fix
[39:13] it but our Heavenly father's like
[39:16] that amen and no matter what storm
[39:20] you're going
[39:22] through amen you just sit in The
[39:24] Presence of
[39:25] Jehovah I tell you is it's it's it's a
[39:28] it's just amazing so we had friends up
[39:32] Friday that we've never seen
[39:34] before they're actually friends of Brent
[39:38] they were connected with his concrete
[39:40] Florida and New
[39:42] York and they they said they would just
[39:45] stop in for a few minutes because
[39:47] they've never seen us
[39:50] before you know you are Christ today you
[39:54] you are com 100% Christ today today the
[39:58] only Christ the world will ever see is
[40:00] the bride of
[40:01] Christ you're no different than the
[40:04] actual Jesus Christ that's what our
[40:06] Prophet said I mean other than he was
[40:09] the fullness and we're Parts he said
[40:11] when God spoke the Elohim he spoke you
[40:14] out he said you're bone in his flesh
[40:18] you're
[40:19] everything man and the kids all went in
[40:21] the house and these two men were here
[40:22] I've never seen them
[40:23] before and by the way they they could
[40:26] hardly leave even when they left they
[40:27] sto at the mailbox and get out and took
[40:30] more pictures and and he
[40:34] said but was able to witness
[40:36] to said
[40:38] D there's something about you and your
[40:44] family
[40:47] and even in private his wife look like
[40:51] I've never seen these I've never seen a
[40:53] picture of these
[40:55] people told her husband he said you
[40:57] could learned something from Brother
[40:58] Dale the way he treats his
[41:02] family because he was surprised how
[41:04] mature different our our girls
[41:07] were she said you ever see how Dell
[41:10] treats his
[41:12] girls amen a
[41:14] mystery God has a purpose for us being
[41:18] here and so all all the rest of this
[41:20] message is just for me because you know
[41:24] you know a minister don't pick what he
[41:26] wants to preach so I I had a nice
[41:28] beautiful Father's Day message and and I
[41:30] did you know all day devotions or study
[41:33] or whatever you want to call it and and
[41:36] God just changed everything on
[41:40] Thursday and uh so here's what God
[41:44] wanted to say to me but I want to show
[41:47] you in this
[41:48] scripture that it says
[41:51] all it says all now this this we don't
[41:54] have this problem here we don't we
[41:57] honestly don't I don't believe we have
[41:58] it in this church but the Bible portrays
[42:02] it as
[42:04] all and so let's turn to James 1
[42:08] 19 and just show you where we God wants
[42:11] to go this
[42:14] morning this is this is I mean it's
[42:17] supernatural because our God is
[42:21] Supernatural James 1:19 then I'm going
[42:23] to drop to 22 and 24 and 26 and we're
[42:26] just going to lay a bit of a foundation
[42:28] here and you got to understand this is
[42:32] when we read this this is still a
[42:33] mystery therefore my beloved Brethren
[42:36] let every man be swift to
[42:39] hear remember what I said about my
[42:43] daddy and really slow to
[42:47] speak and even slower to
[42:51] wrath and 22 but be ye doers of the word
[42:55] now we just read the word
[42:58] so we're supposed to do that word that
[42:59] we just read but be doers of the word
[43:02] and not just hearers of the
[43:04] word
[43:07] deceiving uhoh I don't like that word
[43:10] your own
[43:13] self for If any man be a hearer of the
[43:16] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[43:18] man beholding his natural face in a
[43:21] glass looking in a mirror for he
[43:23] beholdeth himself and goeth his way and
[43:26] straightway forget forth what manner of
[43:29] man he
[43:31] was so you look in the mirror and you
[43:34] forget who you are verse 26 but if any
[43:39] man among you seem to
[43:41] be a message
[43:45] believer and bridleth not
[43:48] his
[43:53] tongue he deceiveth his heart and this
[43:57] man's message
[43:59] belief is in
[44:03] vain
[44:05] wow God help us you know I want to tell
[44:08] you something that and if you don't see
[44:10] this you know talking about a family and
[44:13] unit you know brother uh God in Genesis
[44:16] 1:28 and 27 I believe it was said let us
[44:19] make man in our image and God blessed
[44:22] both the masculine and The Feminine he
[44:26] blessed them both and they were together
[44:28] brother Bram said that if you have your
[44:31] wrong wife or husband in this world you
[44:35] will not have the wrong one in the
[44:36] Millennium that's a direct quote he said
[44:39] all the wrongs will be made right in the
[44:40] Millennium and so if you're married to
[44:43] your
[44:45] rib your rib is impossible for one to be
[44:51] lost now that's a
[44:53] mystery because see you were one so half
[44:56] of you can't die half can't go to hell
[44:59] and half go to heaven that's not
[45:02] possible not if you came from God
[45:04] because that you start out at Eternal
[45:06] Eternal don't never
[45:09] stop so
[45:11] see how the whole unit now now it
[45:14] becomes a group of
[45:16] people and you create a home
[45:20] atmosphere that's affected in these
[45:23] scriptures let me let me before we read
[45:25] a scripture let me let me show you some
[45:27] of the greatest deceits in the
[45:29] Bible I'm just rolling ahead here you
[45:33] know the people never believed Moses was
[45:36] called I'm I'm going to read some quotes
[45:38] they never believed David and David was
[45:41] worse off because his own family didn't
[45:42] believe him they mocked him that's
[45:45] unbelievable that little scrawny runt
[45:47] what can he
[45:48] do but you know the greatest
[45:51] hypocrisy in the Christian
[45:54] church was Mary
[45:58] let me read some things that brother
[45:59] Brown said he saidou know Mary
[46:04] came you know when the child would be
[46:06] young and and I don't know exactly the
[46:08] time but they would bring the child for
[46:09] circumcision and offer for purification
[46:12] in the Tabernacle he said Mary would
[46:14] line up there with hundreds of
[46:17] mothers now this was at the message
[46:20] Church well wait a minute well it had to
[46:22] be because it was
[46:24] Christ he didn't go to the denomination
[46:30] right I mean the anointed one he
[46:33] definitely went to the right church and
[46:35] he said you would hear some of them say
[46:37] sh did you hear the gossip have you
[46:41] heard haven't you heard the gossip that
[46:43] this little girl baby by
[46:46] Joseph not being
[46:48] married oh that's so
[46:52] terrible it's if you would have ever oh
[46:55] it's terrible to see oh that poor little
[46:57] girl and it it's it's such a
[47:03] disgrace that she says it was virgin
[47:06] born and she Mary didn't pay no
[47:09] attention to it and she had that little
[47:12] Treasure of
[47:14] Christ in her arms and she knew the
[47:17] truth who the baby belonged to and she
[47:21] knowed that it was God's son no matter
[47:24] how
[47:25] many laugh
[47:28] and didn't get it with
[47:32] her now our Prophet clearly said the
[47:35] spirits don't
[47:37] die I had some of those same
[47:39] similarities when God called us to start
[47:41] the
[47:43] ministry and there was one
[47:46] person besides Christ that was my strong
[47:49] backbone was my
[47:52] wife and my
[47:55] kids and you couldn't touch them without
[47:58] touching
[48:00] me that's not
[48:02] possible cuz see if we came from God
[48:04] we're going back to God so we're Eternal
[48:05] so we're not divided because we're
[48:09] one let me read another quote the
[48:11] brother Brown said he said those mothers
[48:14] stood there every day in a line for
[48:15] circumcision of the children and
[48:17] offering for purification he said now
[48:19] down along the line here he said
[48:20] outstands this little virgin a lot of
[48:22] the babies with fine needle work clothes
[48:26] and a little pink dress on and really
[48:28] pretty things you know and here stands
[48:30] this little fell down here with this
[48:32] little virgin girl and some would say
[48:35] hey say didn't you hear the
[48:39] Scandal did you get the gossip on
[48:42] Facebook there's a woman here that baby
[48:44] was born
[48:46] illegitimate her and Joseph they're not
[48:49] married yet and there she's got that
[48:52] baby oh that's so terrible I told you oh
[48:54] I know it and see that's the
[49:00] there there it s and so keep your way
[49:04] back and get back from
[49:07] her they're they're they're in the
[49:10] gossip they're saying no stay away from
[49:11] Mary she's the plague she's leprosy and
[49:15] that's the way they do it
[49:17] yet
[49:24] today just stay far away away from that
[49:27] person he's not really called of God and
[49:30] they say and see and so they get back
[49:33] and this is a prophet 62 paragraph 62
[49:35] and he said there she was standing but
[49:38] little Mary with a little veil over her
[49:40] face she
[49:41] knew who the baby
[49:44] was and every man that's and every man
[49:47] that's born of the spirit of God knows
[49:50] where he's
[49:51] standing and I don't care
[49:55] what the world
[49:59] says
[50:01] amen
[50:04] wow how could they miss
[50:06] it how could the Believers of the day
[50:10] miss the word of God when he said
[50:13] exactly how he could come they had 700
[50:17] years to read Isaiah's
[50:20] prophecy it came right to the
[50:24] letter and they complain completely blew
[50:29] it amen they blew
[50:32] it see because we put
[50:36] God I'm not going to be here today I'm
[50:39] not really
[50:44] here and I'm telling you
[50:47] something we do this in our let me
[50:50] rephrase that I do this in my family in
[50:52] the past maybe you do if you're a human
[50:59] but we have thoughts or plans or dreams
[51:02] or
[51:04] interpretations and when they don't fall
[51:09] out we take our renge out on our
[51:13] kids on our wife we always do it on the
[51:17] people we love the
[51:18] most because they know they can't get
[51:20] away from it see your friends they'll
[51:22] run
[51:23] away but your family can't it's too much
[51:30] blood
[51:33] ouch and that's exactly what we do in
[51:36] the family of God that's what the Bible
[51:38] says that's what our Prophet
[51:41] said we're going to read some of the
[51:43] On's quotes about
[51:45] Moses and David but we read them about
[51:47] Mary that was nothing but God's Divine
[51:51] will predestinated Eternal thoughts of
[51:54] God
[51:58] and the children of
[52:00] God not only didn't understand it but
[52:03] they spoke against it now let me show
[52:05] you something now we are Christ
[52:09] today we are Christ today and so that
[52:12] means we're directly connected there's
[52:16] no difference so let me show you what
[52:18] Christ
[52:19] did pilate
[52:22] marveled that he spoke not a word
[52:31] God help brother
[52:33] Dale
[52:37] marveled most of us don't have to Marvel
[52:40] like that cuz
[52:42] everybody's TGG and wide
[52:45] open
[52:49] amen James
[52:52] 3 if you wonder one of the books that I
[52:55] read when I was doing
[52:57] watching the rain on the front porch on
[53:01] most of the days of the week was James
[53:04] 3 I read a couple books in the Old
[53:07] Testament and then I dropped down to the
[53:09] middle of the New
[53:13] Testament and see God had a
[53:15] predestinated plan I wasn't even
[53:16] thinking of I just would randomly say oh
[53:19] that looks about a good spot to
[53:23] start James 3 2-12
[53:27] now I want to show you something you
[53:29] know this is for me but the Bible kind
[53:32] of says it
[53:34] all is for in many things we
[53:38] all in many things we offend
[53:41] all and if any man offend not in word
[53:45] the same is a perfect man and able also
[53:47] to Bridle his whole
[53:51] body three behold we put bits in horses
[53:55] mouths that they may May obey us and we
[53:57] turn about the whole body for him but
[54:00] behold also the ships which though they
[54:02] are great are driven by Fierce winds yet
[54:06] we turn them about by a very very very
[54:10] small
[54:12] Helm
[54:14] Hallelujah whether soever the governor
[54:17] the driver of the ship want us listen it
[54:22] verse five even so
[54:27] the
[54:30] tongue is a very little
[54:33] member and it boasts great
[54:37] things behold how great a
[54:41] matter a little tiny
[54:44] fire
[54:47] kindleth and the tongue is a fire in a
[54:50] world of iniquity now
[54:53] iniquity is to know to do right but it's
[54:56] impossible to do it it's not impossible
[54:59] to do it but you don't do it but there
[55:02] why I said impossible is we're going to
[55:04] see why the scripture says that a world
[55:07] of iniquity that's sin and you know
[55:10] what's
[55:11] wrong so is the tongue among our members
[55:15] now there it don't say brother Dale it
[55:17] says
[55:19] ours sorry sorry and that it defileth
[55:26] the whole
[55:28] church or the family or your household
[55:32] or the body and it Seth on
[55:36] fire that's that's fire is pretty
[55:39] destructive I've been at a few Barn
[55:40] fires they never put them
[55:42] out set on fire the course of Nature and
[55:47] it is set on fire
[55:51] of
[55:54] hell now before it said
[55:57] our and now it says hell I say this is a
[56:01] fairly serious accusation and for every
[56:04] kind of beast in the
[56:06] nature and is Set uh sorry and every
[56:09] kind of beast of the birds and of the
[56:12] serpents and of things of the sea is
[56:14] tamed and hasth been tamed of
[56:19] mankind but the
[56:23] tongue that can no man
[56:28] te now that's kind of like
[56:32] plural and it is an
[56:37] unruly
[56:39] evil and it's
[56:43] full of deadly
[56:47] poison we're talking serious stuff
[56:51] here therefore therewith bless we God
[56:54] even the father and and therewith curse
[56:57] we men that came from
[57:02] God like
[57:04] Mary and Christ
[57:08] Jesus can you imagine the people that
[57:11] mocked Mary I don't want to be standing
[57:14] next to them when they go through
[57:18] the
[57:20] whoa therein curse We Men which are made
[57:23] in the
[57:24] subd now this this word here means in
[57:27] the likeness and the ass the the
[57:32] resemblance or a shadow of God now we
[57:36] know that when we came from Genesis that
[57:39] we actually are God came from
[57:46] God he said oh the same most proceed His
[57:48] blessings and cursings and brothers
[57:50] these things ought not to be
[57:52] so doth a fountain send forth the same
[57:57] Sweet Water and bitter water and can a
[57:59] fig tree my brethren bear Olive
[58:03] berries neither or either of Vine
[58:07] figs so can no Fountain yield both salt
[58:12] water and fresh
[58:14] water now that scripture clearly
[58:18] identifies
[58:21] all and it clearly means it's
[58:24] drastic when it's talking talking about
[58:29] hell and it also says that you can't
[58:32] tame your
[58:33] tongue that's not
[58:36] possible and nobody else can tame it and
[58:39] you can't take counseling for it
[58:41] either but there's one beautiful person
[58:44] that
[58:46] can and that's a Sweet Holy
[58:49] Spirit and you know I was always I
[58:52] always enjoyed math and I hated school
[58:54] but I if if was picking something I was
[58:57] all right and everything in M can be
[58:59] double
[59:01] checked and so somebody that don't
[59:04] control
[59:05] this don't have the
[59:09] other you know when you times if you
[59:11] divide it you get the same answer back
[59:14] if you minus or add back together you
[59:16] get the same answer so if you got a
[59:18] loose
[59:21] tongue you don't have Christ I learned
[59:24] that in grade nth
[59:30] amen
[59:32] wow amen God never intended for his
[59:36] family to be in this state amen you know
[59:40] if if you know and in the bigger the
[59:42] family the bigger you know the the uh
[59:46] what's the word uh the environment but
[59:48] the uh you know the Dynamics become
[59:52] tremendous amen if you if you have a
[59:54] large family and you might have it all
[59:57] together but you wait till every one of
[1:00:00] your children get
[1:00:02] married now your family doubled but you
[1:00:05] don't know who those people
[1:00:07] are maybe your children
[1:00:11] do
[1:00:14] oh oh it's kind of like the family of
[1:00:16] God we get new people come in at the
[1:00:19] late hour God brings them up fast we
[1:00:23] don't understand
[1:00:26] and so we anytime in human nature
[1:00:29] anytime humanly you don't understand or
[1:00:32] you don't
[1:00:38] agree oh
[1:00:40] man do I ever have that t-shirt hanging
[1:00:43] in the
[1:00:46] closet 1 Peter
[1:00:50] 4:15 you know in our James scripture it
[1:00:53] mentioned hell and man it's in kingled
[1:00:57] of fire and even of hell but so you know
[1:01:00] I say let's investigate when God started
[1:01:03] bringing this all in I said oh man let's
[1:01:05] let's let's check this out and
[1:01:06] investigate so 1 Peter 4:15 says but let
[1:01:10] none of you suffer as a murderer now
[1:01:12] that's fairly
[1:01:15] bad I mean that's getting raped you
[1:01:19] know anybody
[1:01:23] agree or is a thief now not that's not
[1:01:26] near as bad you
[1:01:28] know or is an evil dur well you know we
[1:01:31] can almost put up them or is a oh
[1:01:36] oh or is a busy
[1:01:39] body in God's
[1:01:43] matters because see the man's matters if
[1:01:46] he's a man of God it's actually God's
[1:01:48] matters because I'm not doing what Dale
[1:01:50] wants to do I'm doing what God you know
[1:01:52] brother Braham said if you try to run he
[1:01:54] said you well actually in most said you
[1:01:56] might as well forget about running cuz
[1:01:57] God will he'll kill you till you do what
[1:02:00] he
[1:02:01] wants Moses wanted to do that Moses
[1:02:05] wanted to run he married a beuty
[1:02:07] Ethiopian woman and went and inhered a
[1:02:09] whole herd of sheep and his
[1:02:11] father-in-law was old he could have
[1:02:12] knocked him off and been a
[1:02:15] millionaire God said take that staff and
[1:02:17] get on a donkey and go for a long dry
[1:02:20] ride M said no not me
[1:02:23] God not me I got a bad speech
[1:02:30] so here Peter considers a busy body
[1:02:33] equal to
[1:02:35] murder most we don't we don't rate it
[1:02:38] the
[1:02:42] same you would avoid a murderer our
[1:02:46] country locks them up well some
[1:02:47] countries lock him up we probably let
[1:02:49] them go now
[1:02:51] but
[1:02:53] amen we would avoid a thief we would
[1:02:55] lock our door from a thief or an evil
[1:02:58] deer but a busy
[1:03:02] body in the things of God because you
[1:03:05] know even even the person that you know
[1:03:08] even even even Moses didn't know what
[1:03:10] God was doing David surely didn't know
[1:03:13] what God was doing he was just watching
[1:03:15] sheep they both were watching
[1:03:19] sheep you see nobody's got God figured
[1:03:21] out remember that quote not even the
[1:03:24] preachers got God figured out
[1:03:26] definitely not the fightful ministry
[1:03:28] that are called of God they don't really
[1:03:29] know God's direct
[1:03:30] plan I didn't know it yesterday because
[1:03:33] Junior was going to preach I'm not
[1:03:40] here
[1:03:42] wow amen see how we need to be as little
[1:03:46] children and just let God be God and you
[1:03:50] know however God desires to move in our
[1:03:52] in our life in our individual life in
[1:03:54] our household old family life and in the
[1:03:57] church and then in the family of God the
[1:03:59] world collectively just say
[1:04:02] woo and maybe something that you
[1:04:07] don't
[1:04:11] I
[1:04:16] wow 1 Peter
[1:04:19] 3:10 that'd be all
[1:04:22] right how God give me the scriptures is
[1:04:25] how how they're just loaded loaded here
[1:04:30] 1 Peter 3:10 for he that will love life
[1:04:34] now I think most of us would all be real
[1:04:36] happy with their family and I mean the
[1:04:38] only people that got a happy family is
[1:04:39] the children of God Amen it's just
[1:04:42] Supernatural I mean we uh are blessed
[1:04:45] tremendously and see good days let him
[1:04:50] refrain or
[1:04:52] stop his tongue
[1:04:58] now that's talking to
[1:05:00] Believers from
[1:05:03] Evil and his lips from speaking no G
[1:05:06] that's deceit and
[1:05:09] dishonesty
[1:05:11] amen cuz see you say well bless God that
[1:05:14] was exactly the truth do you understand
[1:05:15] God your Prophet said you
[1:05:18] don't you know we preached a message a
[1:05:20] few months
[1:05:22] ago understanding the sovereignty of God
[1:05:27] we thought we had things all God all
[1:05:29] figured out and God did things that was
[1:05:32] just because he was God like when he
[1:05:35] told Isaiah the prophet to go nude for
[1:05:37] three
[1:05:38] years I would never figure that out like
[1:05:41] he would have the people follow David
[1:05:43] after he raped a woman and murdered his
[1:05:45] her husband I would definitely wouldn't
[1:05:48] go to that
[1:05:50] church i' fly out wouldn't
[1:05:54] have but but that but God is
[1:05:58] God God is
[1:06:01] Sovereign
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] hallelujah man ain't that amazing so see
[1:06:08] when you when
[1:06:09] you when you look at this scripture 1
[1:06:12] Peter 3:10 and it and it says guile is
[1:06:15] deceit or dishonest it's because you
[1:06:17] don't understand God's plan he say but
[1:06:20] brother God I like God you know that
[1:06:22] wasn't in my agenda I wasn't you know I
[1:06:24] never seen them is going
[1:06:26] there cut said
[1:06:31] so but God I didn't see me
[1:06:42] with
[1:06:45] Wow let's read a
[1:06:47] quote and tasing Spirits among a lot of
[1:06:51] people we find where emotions and so
[1:06:54] forth and there become tattling and back
[1:06:57] bitings and all kinds of ungodly things
[1:07:00] now these ungodly things are not in the
[1:07:02] restaurant where the worldly people are
[1:07:06] brother it that's surc acid now the
[1:07:10] Bible when we started out called it uh
[1:07:16] totic he said that's suric acid in the
[1:07:19] church and he said it's demon power now
[1:07:22] see how I said you couldn't do one and
[1:07:24] say you got the whole Holy
[1:07:29] Spirit you can't have a demon and have
[1:07:31] the Holy Spirit at the same
[1:07:33] time he said that that's demon power and
[1:07:38] the spirit of men and women who are
[1:07:40] getting among one another and trying to
[1:07:42] push off and say well this is not right
[1:07:45] and this is not right I would say lots
[1:07:47] of things in the Bible isn't right in
[1:07:49] the prophets prophets that lied and you
[1:07:51] know Abraham lied taught his son I son
[1:07:55] how to but his wife
[1:08:00] and this ain't right and if you'll Chase
[1:08:03] it right
[1:08:04] down nine times out of
[1:08:07] 10 it's the very person that's making
[1:08:10] the steer
[1:08:12] stare isn't right with
[1:08:15] God Amen God hates Discord among his
[1:08:19] Brethren because be reverence and be
[1:08:21] holy and love God and stand by him and
[1:08:23] as long as you know your life is
[1:08:26] dovetailing up with the Bible with the
[1:08:29] purity of heart and purity of thought
[1:08:31] and love towards your brother and trying
[1:08:34] to do your best to build the kingdom of
[1:08:37] God and doing those things now your best
[1:08:40] won't be
[1:08:43] Perfection amen so don't don't think
[1:08:46] well oh that
[1:08:48] brother when we're perfect we go in a
[1:08:50] Rapture or God will take us home amen so
[1:08:53] when you look at brother Dale you're not
[1:08:55] going to see
[1:08:57] Perfection cuz you know he's still
[1:08:59] working on
[1:09:02] me you know he's actually the Potter and
[1:09:05] I'm actually the clay and he smashed the
[1:09:08] bowl a lot of times and had to go back
[1:09:11] to The Well of the Holy Spirit and pour
[1:09:13] some water in and say oh boys I wish
[1:09:15] you'd get it right this
[1:09:18] time
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:22] hallelujah he's a love towards your
[1:09:24] brother and trying to do your best to
[1:09:25] build up the kingdom of God he said
[1:09:27] doing those things dressing right living
[1:09:30] right and
[1:09:33] uhoh and talking
[1:09:37] right going the right places and then
[1:09:40] you can have all the emotions you want
[1:09:43] to and everybody will watch this and
[1:09:46] everybody will believe that you're a
[1:09:53] Believer but if you got the emotions
[1:09:56] and you don't got the
[1:10:01] life
[1:10:03] ouch
[1:10:05] amen here he says
[1:10:08] and he said if you can't respect the the
[1:10:11] man respect the office he holds in God
[1:10:14] that's exactly right see respect him and
[1:10:15] if the I'm not I'm not reading this
[1:10:18] quote because this is an issue here I
[1:10:19] don't feel disrespected I I
[1:10:23] just I'm saying brother Dale has a
[1:10:26] tongue that's
[1:10:28] untameable that's what the Bible said I
[1:10:31] mean that's
[1:10:34] prophecy but until we surrender to the
[1:10:37] Holy
[1:10:39] Ghost and then he's the
[1:10:43] head and his example is that people will
[1:10:46] Marvel not how good a minister you are
[1:10:49] they won't Marvel that you got a great
[1:10:51] Dynamic delivery of an
[1:10:54] evangelist they'll
[1:10:57] Marvel that you're
[1:10:59] quiet there you know there's not one
[1:11:01] time in the Bible that they said when
[1:11:02] Jesus preached that the people
[1:11:06] marvelled but when he was
[1:11:09] quiet they
[1:11:15] marveled
[1:11:18] wow amen that's exactly right see
[1:11:21] respect them if a minister comes up your
[1:11:23] pastor you always respect and hear the
[1:11:25] congregation talk and and I've heard of
[1:11:28] congregations this this does not look
[1:11:29] like I've heard of congregations and
[1:11:31] they talk about their pastor and how
[1:11:33] just to talk listen let's just incam
[1:11:36] this in the whole big circle of what
[1:11:41] some people
[1:11:42] call the
[1:11:45] message and you'll all know what I
[1:11:47] mean amen and I've heard people in the
[1:11:50] message talk about their Pastor I edit I
[1:11:53] changed that and how just talk about him
[1:11:56] and run him down and ridicule him and
[1:11:58] how is that Pastor ever going to do
[1:12:00] anything for you he can't do it I don't
[1:12:03] say this church but I mean churches that
[1:12:06] I've seen that if you if you got you've
[1:12:08] got to love your pastor you it's not
[1:12:11] just I I don't I don't like direct
[1:12:13] things you got to love our the
[1:12:17] family I'm not talking about us we got
[1:12:19] to love each other and we got to love
[1:12:22] the each other's where we're going I got
[1:12:24] to love the each other's I've never seen
[1:12:25] where I'm going to Burlington after cuz
[1:12:28] I want to be part of that family
[1:12:31] wherever the family of God is when I go
[1:12:33] this to old Salvador in December and
[1:12:35] Africa and January and wherever else in
[1:12:40] February
[1:12:48] amen you got to love each other and you
[1:12:51] got to know that he's a human being you
[1:12:54] got to know that each other are human
[1:12:57] beings we were all raised in different
[1:12:59] parts of the world with different Mommy
[1:13:02] and daddies in different locations we
[1:13:04] have different environment our mommy and
[1:13:06] daddy some live long some di short and
[1:13:09] and and and and and and and and and
[1:13:15] and some of us worked in the union some
[1:13:17] of us were Ultra paneers some of us
[1:13:21] were and we come together and
[1:13:26] but these things not ought to
[1:13:29] be amen for you know that he's a human
[1:13:33] there we're all human beings and yet God
[1:13:36] made us and God made him as your
[1:13:40] pastor and the Holy Ghost has made him
[1:13:42] the overseer and when you respect each
[1:13:45] other respect him in that manner then no
[1:13:48] matter what the pastor's done no matter
[1:13:50] what each other has
[1:13:52] done if you respect him in your heart as
[1:13:55] God's servant as the bride of Christ
[1:13:58] then God will respect you for doing it I
[1:14:02] ain't direct to just at the pastor if
[1:14:04] you'll respect your brother and sister
[1:14:07] in the family of
[1:14:09] God even though they did something wrong
[1:14:12] the prophet said wrong do you think
[1:14:15] David did something
[1:14:19] wrong imagine if you
[1:14:21] were the Man's family that he murdered
[1:14:26] imagine if you were the the the the the
[1:14:28] the the the the military man that took
[1:14:30] the note back said place
[1:14:33] somewh and then you this how it would be
[1:14:36] like I'm the military man I take the
[1:14:38] note from David murder this dude put him
[1:14:40] right in the line of the
[1:14:42] atomics and then I have to I have to
[1:14:45] filter that and go sit in David's
[1:14:49] Church
[1:14:52] oh
[1:14:53] wow I mean mean that's a
[1:14:56] filter it's called the Holy
[1:14:58] Ghost but we got to run that through and
[1:15:01] and because we're a human being we run
[1:15:03] that through we go oh that still don't
[1:15:04] look right we run it through again oh
[1:15:06] that definitely don't feel
[1:15:10] right but it was part of God's plan and
[1:15:14] he said but God
[1:15:22] why God might say to like you did to
[1:15:24] Paul he said and my grace is sufficient
[1:15:26] for you because I've given you such
[1:15:29] Advanced
[1:15:31] Revelation and you would become hotti
[1:15:34] and high- minded because you know more
[1:15:36] than all the other ages before
[1:15:39] you I've given you this little poke in
[1:15:42] the
[1:15:43] side to bring you down so I can still
[1:15:45] talk to
[1:15:47] you
[1:15:50] who see God knows how to let just the
[1:15:54] right enough err out of you know the
[1:15:55] prophet said this he said I hate tubless
[1:15:57] tires you know who ever heard tell of a
[1:15:59] tire just stuck on a rim with a bunch of
[1:16:01] bubble gum and then you get a nail in
[1:16:02] you pull the nail and then stick of
[1:16:04] rubber in
[1:16:05] it but God knew how just to let enough
[1:16:08] the right amount of air out and then
[1:16:11] stick the plug
[1:16:13] in so he could deal with brother
[1:16:16] Dale and so he could deal with each one
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:19] us because if we got too hard
[1:16:28] oh that's about
[1:16:33] right
[1:16:35] wow
[1:16:36] amen God's
[1:16:38] perfect God's perfect and and he sees
[1:16:41] you as perfect and he and he wants you
[1:16:44] to come up to this stage you know amen
[1:16:47] and we're all we're all getting there
[1:16:48] maybe at different times not but we're
[1:16:50] all kind of in this
[1:16:53] this cuz we're all still
[1:16:56] here
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] wow God help us he said oh you can speak
[1:17:03] in tongues and jump and jump over seats
[1:17:05] and I believe in that kind of stuff
[1:17:07] matter of fact I don't just believe in
[1:17:08] it I want to see it
[1:17:10] actually I like nothing better than to
[1:17:12] God anoint somebody in this church and
[1:17:13] run the house I I said that I believe in
[1:17:17] that I believe in the power of
[1:17:20] God and I believe in shouting and
[1:17:22] beating tambourines
[1:17:25] and then you go out and talk about your
[1:17:26] neighbor out there now I just want to
[1:17:29] just break this down real slow because
[1:17:31] we got we we're doing just
[1:17:33] fine he didn't say about the
[1:17:35] bride he said your
[1:17:39] neighbor now now by the way this is a
[1:17:41] prophet that said this and this is a
[1:17:44] late 59 quote for anybody that's
[1:17:47] struggling with he said don't you expect
[1:17:50] God to ever answer your prayers
[1:17:59] you can dump a wheelar of oil on top of
[1:18:02] somebody you can have brother Bart bring
[1:18:04] a truck tanker truck in here well just
[1:18:06] bring the line in here and just drown
[1:18:08] them with
[1:18:13] oil but until
[1:18:16] you God just says now you you don't you
[1:18:19] don't think so he did it to the prophet
[1:18:22] when he laid those hands on the baby
[1:18:25] and God said you're not even worthy to
[1:18:27] be breathing let alone
[1:18:29] praying he said not praying and brother
[1:18:32] Bram
[1:18:39] laugh
[1:18:41] wow this is what God expects 1 Peter
[1:18:45] 3:7 and this is not the first part of
[1:18:48] the script but this is the character and
[1:18:50] you know and and you will only see this
[1:18:52] in the bride of Christ a gar guantee you
[1:18:55] listen the bride of Christ is not living
[1:18:57] in the L toan
[1:18:59] age okay because and the reason I say
[1:19:02] that is because the Len age threw God on
[1:19:05] the outside so you can't be his wife and
[1:19:08] have God on the
[1:19:10] outside okay you can't be cold and
[1:19:13] formal okay so yes the Le scene age is
[1:19:16] going on and we're in that environment
[1:19:19] but we're not from here we're from there
[1:19:23] so we're we're you know that atmosph
[1:19:24] spere is trying to get into us he says
[1:19:28] husband likewise ye husbands dwell with
[1:19:30] them according to the knowledge and give
[1:19:32] an honor unto your wife that's honor
[1:19:35] onto each
[1:19:37] other okay this is not about heav
[1:19:39] husbands and wives on as the weaker
[1:19:41] vessel but being HS together by the
[1:19:43] grace of life that
[1:19:46] your
[1:19:48] prayers now so you see somebody in the
[1:19:51] church or in the family of God and you
[1:19:52] say oh man are they ever going to get it
[1:19:56] right
[1:19:58] uhoh I hope they don't call you to
[1:20:02] pray because God just
[1:20:04] went with that
[1:20:07] prayer oh bless God I've been going to
[1:20:10] church with them for 20
[1:20:11] years they still come late and they're
[1:20:14] not
[1:20:18] perfect hope the song leader is Anointed
[1:20:20] to call somebody else
[1:20:25] because God just goes like this when you
[1:20:27] come
[1:20:36] up that's why I I never have never will
[1:20:40] and by God's grace never will I don't
[1:20:42] believe in levels of Believers you
[1:20:45] either are or you aren't you either came
[1:20:48] from God or you didn't come from God
[1:20:51] your daddy is either Jehovah Gyra or or
[1:20:54] he's
[1:20:56] Lucifer I don't care if you've been in
[1:20:58] for one hour or 100
[1:21:01] years I don't care if you went around
[1:21:03] the world a hundred
[1:21:05] times you can only be Christ the
[1:21:08] anointed
[1:21:09] one
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:13] hallelujah God help us
[1:21:18] we're here's a prophet talking in and
[1:21:20] tasting
[1:21:22] Spirits this is our Prophet now
[1:21:25] he said ' this tongue of
[1:21:27] mine man he was an honest
[1:21:32] person this tongue of mine that's being
[1:21:36] easy to take sides with this bunch of
[1:21:40] Gossip Lord I'm laying it down here and
[1:21:44] I'll never pick it up
[1:21:47] again
[1:21:48] sanctify my tongue Lord and let me feel
[1:21:52] the Angels go through like they did with
[1:21:55] Isaiah did when they said I am woe with
[1:21:59] me for I have on clean
[1:22:03] lips this what's brother Brown
[1:22:09] talking
[1:22:11] amen let's read that scripture of Isaiah
[1:22:13] 6:5 and 7 and here here Isaiah you know
[1:22:17] the scripture King Uzziah was greatly
[1:22:19] blessed of God and and then he and and
[1:22:21] the King was like everything he touched
[1:22:24] was
[1:22:27] bless and then he tried to change
[1:22:31] positions and he tried to be a levite
[1:22:34] and offer sacrifices that wasn't lawful
[1:22:37] for the king to do and he refused
[1:22:40] correction and and and God struck him
[1:22:44] with Leprosy and the prophet Isaiah was
[1:22:47] a young man and he was so connected with
[1:22:51] the King cuz he knew that God moved
[1:22:54] through the King's
[1:22:55] life and see we we all have people that
[1:22:58] we get connected with and God uses them
[1:23:01] to help us through our weak points and
[1:23:03] and strong points and that's that's okay
[1:23:06] but in the whole picture and scheme of
[1:23:08] things you want to make sure that the
[1:23:11] last person you're looking at is
[1:23:15] Jehovah because he's the only one
[1:23:17] that'll never never never never never
[1:23:20] never
[1:23:22] never fail
[1:23:26] but the Isaiah did the right thing he
[1:23:28] ran to the Tabernacle he said woe is me
[1:23:30] for I undone because I am a man of
[1:23:32] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[1:23:34] people of unclean lips and my eyes have
[1:23:36] seen the king the lord of the hosts in
[1:23:39] verse 7 he said and he laid it upon my
[1:23:42] mouth and said Lo this hasth touched thy
[1:23:45] lips and thy sin thy iniquity is taken
[1:23:51] away and thy sin is purged I say God do
[1:23:55] that to me do that to the bride of
[1:23:57] Christ do that to each one of us amen we
[1:24:01] got to lay down our kingdoms and just
[1:24:03] join God's kingdom I don't care what
[1:24:06] happens in God's kingdom because it's it
[1:24:08] never was my you know what I'm saying
[1:24:10] like I we we shouldn't have a plan or
[1:24:13] agenda it's except glorify him try in
[1:24:17] every conversation you know when you
[1:24:19] meet people you never seem me you know I
[1:24:21] I'm going tell you something God's real
[1:24:24] we gassed up our car on the way to
[1:24:26] church and I was rebuked when I got in
[1:24:28] the car because somebody was gassing up
[1:24:31] the boat and I could have dropped some
[1:24:33] seeds
[1:24:35] there but I talked about politics
[1:24:39] instead and I got
[1:24:41] here God said that was your chance right
[1:24:44] there right there and you blew
[1:24:50] it you
[1:24:52] blew amen
[1:24:56] would I would I want to get there and
[1:24:57] those men come up and say remember when
[1:24:59] we were gassing up before and you could
[1:25:01] have just said God's got everything in
[1:25:06] control just one little just I don't
[1:25:08] mean preach to them just say well you
[1:25:10] know they were saying about you know
[1:25:13] things but God's got it
[1:25:17] all but it's so easy to get in that
[1:25:20] anointing say well I agree with you
[1:25:24] but we're not from here so why do we
[1:25:26] even care about
[1:25:27] here
[1:25:29] amen because you see because we're a
[1:25:31] trium being and we're we're flipping
[1:25:33] between this flesh man and this
[1:25:35] spiritual man it's
[1:25:37] like and
[1:25:40] then everything will
[1:25:43] burn everything will burn even the gold
[1:25:45] and silver that you bury in your
[1:25:46] backyard it'll still
[1:25:48] burn you're just taking Christ with you
[1:25:52] the anointed one the character that he's
[1:25:55] given you oh God help us to to God help
[1:25:59] every one of you are preachers when
[1:26:01] you're gasing up the car you know and
[1:26:02] they say well I wish we could get just
[1:26:04] say but God's got
[1:26:07] it amen it's so easy you know you know
[1:26:11] God's teaching me these things
[1:26:14] everywhere there's a
[1:26:15] crack you know even a narate new home
[1:26:18] ain't sealed if it was you you would
[1:26:21] smother when you went to sleep
[1:26:24] and so it's just like you can't make so
[1:26:26] you can and don't give them too much
[1:26:28] because they're just a little bird
[1:26:29] they'll choke to death just say you know
[1:26:31] but God still loves you he's still got
[1:26:35] nobody's in power but God loves they'll
[1:26:38] only be there as long as
[1:26:42] God
[1:26:44] Amen and that might be all it takes you
[1:26:47] know when I PL you know my dad used to
[1:26:50] say this you know our Prophet said the
[1:26:53] natural tapes spiritual
[1:26:54] my daddy used to say I always hate
[1:26:56] getting rained out of a field planting
[1:27:01] you know what he
[1:27:03] meant I do because I'm a farmer because
[1:27:07] when you plant the seed it's
[1:27:09] hard and the last thing you want to do
[1:27:12] is drown
[1:27:15] it and if you just lay it in the
[1:27:18] environment just a little bit it'll just
[1:27:20] loosen up a bit and it and it kind of
[1:27:22] loosens that odor shell and then you get
[1:27:24] a
[1:27:26] rain but no matter how much you drown
[1:27:28] the seed when it's hardest Smet see that
[1:27:30] seed was sitting all winter waiting to
[1:27:32] come for Springtime and if you dump
[1:27:35] water on a hard
[1:27:37] seed it'll it'll it it just Smothers it
[1:27:40] it it it makes it it makes it like like
[1:27:43] a sterile or
[1:27:46] starchy so my daddy would say he said I
[1:27:49] never like getting rained out of a field
[1:27:52] that man that hasn't had time enough in
[1:27:53] them environment so it don't need a lot
[1:27:56] of rain so when you're gassing up the
[1:27:59] car and somebody brings up the Garment
[1:28:01] say well God's God's over
[1:28:04] them that's all you got to say you know
[1:28:07] maybe maybe you know what I'm
[1:28:09] saying oh God help us
[1:28:11] amen
[1:28:13] amen amen we're bringing this down
[1:28:17] here
[1:28:19] here he said you may have to get
[1:28:23] rid this is in faces of Victory he said
[1:28:26] you may try to get rid of that ill
[1:28:28] temper and that slandering tongue that
[1:28:32] gossip on the phone and you might have
[1:28:36] every and you might have tried every re
[1:28:39] remedy that you know how but if you'll
[1:28:43] just let
[1:28:45] Jesus if you'll just let Jesus Christ
[1:28:48] come
[1:28:49] in he'll take care of
[1:28:51] it just like that
[1:28:56] amen
[1:28:59] hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:29:02] God so the problem with the matter
[1:29:05] what's the matter with churches today is
[1:29:06] the great
[1:29:08] majority that's a gent the great
[1:29:11] majority that the gentleness of the Lamb
[1:29:14] of God we are supposed to be
[1:29:17] lambs and we have become everything else
[1:29:20] but Lambs that's the reason as soon as
[1:29:24] we get an attitude the Divine Holy
[1:29:26] Spirit takes her flight and
[1:29:30] leaves amen and if the Lamb of God would
[1:29:33] have made first a snort like a wolf or
[1:29:37] would have done anything contrary to
[1:29:40] what the gentle Dove would have
[1:29:42] permitted the dove would have took its
[1:29:44] flight and she would have left in that
[1:29:46] minute and that's the reason today that
[1:29:49] we're wondering what's the matter with
[1:29:51] the
[1:29:51] churches today can I change it to
[1:29:56] the message churches
[1:29:58] even God
[1:30:00] forbid what's the matter with the church
[1:30:03] it's because that we've taken a
[1:30:05] different
[1:30:08] nature
[1:30:10] I I did I did I planned I sacrificed
[1:30:18] I
[1:30:20] I I
[1:30:24] we've taken a different nature and we've
[1:30:26] taken on a nature that we want our
[1:30:30] rights and we're going to do what we
[1:30:33] know what's right to do and we become
[1:30:37] arrogant and we become hostile and we
[1:30:41] become indifferent and we let our temper
[1:30:43] come in and we let our selfishness come
[1:30:46] in and the lamb when he comes to the
[1:30:48] time and his own when it when a lamb
[1:30:51] comes to the time and his own wool
[1:30:53] that's his is right cuz it's his own
[1:30:55] wool it's his own
[1:30:58] hide but they'll take that lamb and
[1:31:00] throw him on his
[1:31:01] bodex and tie his feet and he never
[1:31:04] kicks or never fusses because he just
[1:31:06] takes away his rights says you can have
[1:31:10] everything
[1:31:13] because he's got the Holy Ghost he's a
[1:31:17] lamb and he can't do nothing else
[1:31:21] because
[1:31:22] that's his nature that's the nature of a
[1:31:26] lamb that's the nature of the baptism of
[1:31:29] the Holy Ghost that when Jesus would
[1:31:31] stand before
[1:31:34] pilot and they were amazed that he
[1:31:36] wouldn't fight he said you know you
[1:31:38] wonder why Christians fight Jesus told
[1:31:42] us why because that's their
[1:31:44] Kingdom because Jesus said if this was
[1:31:47] my kingdom I would fight for
[1:31:51] it but he said this ain't my kingdom so
[1:31:54] it don't matter to I'm talking about the
[1:31:56] Earth so it didn't matter to him what
[1:31:58] happened to the Earth this Badger
[1:32:03] skin but
[1:32:05] heaven but heaven when Lucifer was up
[1:32:07] there he went
[1:32:09] woohoo see
[1:32:13] you that was his
[1:32:16] kingdom amen he can't do nothing else
[1:32:19] about it CU that's his nature but the
[1:32:20] time but one time cross a CHR
[1:32:23] Christian's path this our Prophet I I
[1:32:26] just I just want to remind you this is a
[1:32:28] prophet but one time you cross the
[1:32:31] Christian's path and you'll find out
[1:32:33] whether he's a lamb or a
[1:32:36] goat and you'll find out what he is you
[1:32:39] just cross them up one
[1:32:41] time and that's the reason today that
[1:32:45] our
[1:32:46] churches is in the
[1:32:50] condition that they're in you know I
[1:32:52] would encourage you to go go back and
[1:32:54] listen in
[1:32:56] 56085 the church and its condition and
[1:33:00] brother brandham talked about the nature
[1:33:02] that we're supposed to have I listened
[1:33:03] to that message and I listened to it all
[1:33:06] last night
[1:33:08] twice
[1:33:09] amen he talked about the lamb and the
[1:33:12] Dove and how their Natures
[1:33:14] dovetail and how we are him how she is
[1:33:20] him oh it's beautiful thank you Lord
[1:33:22] Jesus
[1:33:25] oh yep
[1:33:28] 56085
[1:33:30] 56085 05
[1:33:33] 56085 the church and its conditions man
[1:33:37] here's we're just we're just we're just
[1:33:39] wrapping up here seriously amen here
[1:33:43] here's a quote uh we just got to get rid
[1:33:46] of Moses and David here and I mentioned
[1:33:49] this already you know in in in the
[1:33:52] family and a husband and wife are one in
[1:33:55] Christ and here the prophet mentioned he
[1:33:57] said I believe when God calls a man to
[1:34:00] service he calls his wife his housemate
[1:34:04] because they
[1:34:06] too in God's eyes are exactly
[1:34:09] one
[1:34:11] amen now you won't hear that outside of
[1:34:13] the revelation of this message amen it's
[1:34:17] great blessing that we have and now God
[1:34:19] had had a here we're going to close here
[1:34:23] with to Moses and and wind down here
[1:34:26] sorry and now God had a runaway prophet
[1:34:30] and when God calls the man to do
[1:34:32] something he might as well just come to
[1:34:35] it CU he'll be so miserable for the rest
[1:34:38] of his days Moses started out God called
[1:34:41] him ordained him to a job and when he
[1:34:43] started out the people didn't believe
[1:34:45] him so Moses left said no problem see
[1:34:50] you
[1:34:51] later God give him a beautiful Ethiopian
[1:34:53] girl and an inheritance of a whole bunch
[1:34:56] of
[1:34:58] sheep and Moses completely lost the
[1:35:01] vision of God's
[1:35:03] people and that's what most people
[1:35:07] do when they start putting
[1:35:11] this
[1:35:13] amen Because unless you've been really
[1:35:16] talking to God and even if you have he
[1:35:19] hasn't revealed Jesus said that you know
[1:35:22] I have many things to tell you you but
[1:35:24] you couldn't bear them
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:30] hallelujah and he was out there and lost
[1:35:32] all the vision of the people in the
[1:35:33] Church of the Living God and God had
[1:35:35] ordained them to do and he raised them
[1:35:37] up he was born from his mother's womb a
[1:35:40] proper child amen
[1:35:44] hallelujah amen God help us to to if we
[1:35:47] don't understand something just just go
[1:35:50] to God in prayer and say God I don't see
[1:35:52] this
[1:35:57] amen I don't mean he's going to answer
[1:35:59] you like that you might take some of
[1:36:01] them I don't see you to over
[1:36:03] there because you know even with the
[1:36:05] revelation of this message and it is
[1:36:08] completely revealed we're not waiting
[1:36:10] for another something to happen to
[1:36:13] reveal more of the word of God Amen he
[1:36:15] will he will bring us into progressive
[1:36:17] revelation and and you know to see the
[1:36:19] fullness of who he is until we go amen
[1:36:25] but we're still looking through a glass
[1:36:27] Darkly but when we get
[1:36:31] there
[1:36:34] wow we will be
[1:36:36] him she will be him hallelujah amen now

[1:37:25] hardest thing God ever

[1:44:03] see me who I am you know the prophet
[1:44:06] said this and I had one quote and we're
[1:44:08] g we're going to finish here he said see
[1:44:12] if you get in that mode your nature
[1:44:15] changes and the Holy Spirit which is the
[1:44:18] dove he said he'll go
[1:44:21] wait until he's welome come
[1:44:24] again go right over there he said
[1:44:26] there's some places the Holy Spirit
[1:44:29] won't
[1:44:30] go I'll tell you something and I tell
[1:44:32] you something and I was listening to a
[1:44:34] minister joh it was actually Pastor
[1:44:36] Abraham and and I it was a very old
[1:44:39] message and so we need to be Believers
[1:44:43] completely we need to be completely born
[1:44:48] again not just our Inside Man but our
[1:44:52] wallets
[1:44:54] to our clothes our hair our tongue needs
[1:44:58] to be born again it needs to be born
[1:45:00] again twice a day maybe four times a day
[1:45:03] every time you eat born again your
[1:45:07] tongue you know the the the the rhyme of
[1:45:09] sticks and stones will hurt my bones but
[1:45:11] my tongue will never hurt me that's a
[1:45:13] blatant
[1:45:14] lie the devil made that one
[1:45:17] up cuz that's not the truth I don't care
[1:45:21] who you are that's not the
[1:45:25] but we need to be you know I I I started
[1:45:27] to and I wow he's really here the dove
[1:45:31] will leave anytime he's not going to if
[1:45:36] you go in an improper place that's why
[1:45:38] Pastor Dale maybe I'm not your pastor
[1:45:41] that's why brother Dale believes if
[1:45:43] you're not
[1:45:45] homeschooling and they're not in a
[1:45:46] Christian School you're not sending your
[1:45:49] kids with a token to a public school
[1:45:53] I don't care if you like me or
[1:45:55] not that's thus sayith the word of
[1:45:59] God that's like saying I could go into a
[1:46:02] strip joint and say I got the baptism of
[1:46:04] the Holy Ghost that that Holy Ghost is
[1:46:05] not going in there with
[1:46:07] me and if my body is subject to the Holy
[1:46:10] Ghost my body ain't going in there
[1:46:13] either and you all these people that are
[1:46:16] living alive and saying well bless God I
[1:46:18] put my kids under a token then I send
[1:46:19] them out to hell you're deceived
[1:46:23] you need to get the whole body
[1:46:25] converted because the Bible says for you
[1:46:28] to raise your children and and the
[1:46:30] perfect man not the government Hitler
[1:46:33] learned that one and the Catholic church
[1:46:35] just give me your kids till they're
[1:46:36] seven I'll have them the rest of my life
[1:46:38] no matter how much Holy Ghost you can
[1:46:39] put over because the Holy Ghost don't go
[1:46:41] into those Pagan
[1:46:44] places and if you don't think they're
[1:46:49] Pagan we need to talk later
[1:46:54] amen oh bless God he'll protect them
[1:46:57] you're
[1:46:59] deceived you're
[1:47:01] deceived if you're going down the road
[1:47:03] 500 miles an hour and the the speed
[1:47:05] limit is only 50 m hour and say bless
[1:47:07] God he'll protect me you're deceived
[1:47:09] your guardian angel even though he's
[1:47:11] Supernatural he can't keep
[1:47:13] up so you can't break the word and say
[1:47:15] but he'll protect
[1:47:17] me amen that's like saying I can have
[1:47:20] five wives but God will protect me no
[1:47:21] that breaks the word
[1:47:24] so anything that breaks the word we need
[1:47:26] to get the whole body
[1:47:29] converted but most of
[1:47:33] all brother Dale
[1:47:40] Stone amen let's stand
[1:47:53] you know the Bible clearly taught us and
[1:47:57] our Prophet clearly taught us that if we
[1:47:59] light out and it you know the Bible says
[1:48:02] this it says we wrestle not against
[1:48:04] flesh and
[1:48:07] blood but if you touch one of
[1:48:11] God's the Bible says vengeance is
[1:48:15] his and you want to look out for a
[1:48:18] person that's stepping on God's
[1:48:21] Property I'm telling you what God don't
[1:48:24] have no
[1:48:25] squatters and when we come into the full
[1:48:28] maturity we'll recognize with Lucifer
[1:48:32] also I was just studying reading quotes

[1:49:24] it's big small or little or different if
[1:49:26] it's still bathroom it's still
[1:49:28] bathroom we need to get rid of all the
[1:49:30] petty stuff and recognize who God's the
[1:49:34] authority and the power that God's
[1:49:36] entrusted in you and he don't expect
[1:49:39] that Authority and power to destroy the
[1:49:44] children or the little
[1:49:46] ones or the less desirable you know the
[1:49:49] body says the Bible says even the least
[1:49:52] desirable part are given
[1:49:57] special
[1:49:59] honor that means I'm just the I'm not
