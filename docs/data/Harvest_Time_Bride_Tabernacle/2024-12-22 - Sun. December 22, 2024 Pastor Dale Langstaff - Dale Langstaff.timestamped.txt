[29:03] morning and uh who I just want to I
[29:07] believe God wants to show us who we are
[29:10] more and more in him and this is part of
[29:14] the thought this morning I this was a
[29:16] message God give me I preached it down
[29:18] there and uh I'm going to minister it
[29:21] here by God's grace job
[29:26] 1:6 now there was a day when the sons of
[29:29] God came to present them themselves
[29:32] before the Lord and Satan also came
[29:36] amongst them now in job 2:1 it says and
[29:39] Satan came amongst them and presented
[29:43] himself also before the Lord Lord we
[29:46] pray that you'll take the scriptures and
[29:48] may it be you that ministers this
[29:50] morning your thought and Lord God we
[29:53] give you all the glory and all the honor
[29:55] and we welcome you in this place and any
[29:58] way that you would desire to work Lord
[30:01] Jesus this morning we praise you for it
[30:04] amen amen you may have your seats this
[30:18] morning
[30:22] amen just many uh prayer requests or
[30:25] testimonies I should say sorry uh just
[30:28] uh from Brother Carson's Dad we prayed
[30:30] for him on Wednesday um for his hip for
[30:34] healing he was he was out I believe he
[30:36] was out hunting after yeah he was
[30:39] unbelievable God is amazing God is
[30:41] everywhere even even on the same
[30:44] testimony thing you know if you're
[30:45] looking for God moving sister Sharon's
[30:48] brother they went to the airport to stay
[30:50] with him and the doctor said that we
[30:52] will put your your uh bladder bladder on
[30:56] the outside of your body because of
[30:58] cancer and he has
[31:01] completely a perfect bill of health
[31:03] actually he's went back
[31:05] repeatedly and they said you have no
[31:07] cancer also when we were there in new
[31:10] New Foundland with Carson and Sharon in
[31:12] the summertime they went to visit a
[31:14] sister that had backslid and and and
[31:17] well was outside the church you know but
[31:19] a Believer and she had been diagnosed
[31:22] with
[31:24] cancer and since they have stopped there
[31:27] she had has completely a clean bill of
[31:30] health her cancer was a size six and
[31:33] they said the the doctors you have to
[31:35] watch how doctors talk because doctors
[31:38] are built upon fear that's what keeps
[31:40] them employed in case you don't know
[31:42] that the doctors said we can't see no
[31:46] cancer but we still want to do the
[31:50] surgery wait a minute let
[31:52] let's it was a six it went to a three
[31:55] and she went back repeatedly they said
[31:57] we can't see nothing but we'd still like
[31:59] to cut
[32:05] you I I wouldn't offer to be a guinea
[32:08] pig for them in any way but God is still
[32:11] God Amen he's just can do anything that
[32:14] he desires to do and so we praise God
[32:16] for that to think that brother Carson's
[32:19] dad was suffering and bound up and just
[32:22] a day or two later he
[32:26] was O hunting amen hallelujah prise amen
[32:31] God is you know the brother Brown said
[32:33] that the greatest thing that Satan hates
[32:35] is revelation it's Revelation and you
[32:38] know we need to accept the Revelation
[32:40] and I can't give you Revelation and
[32:42] nobody else can give you Revelation but
[32:44] if your heart is open to God and the and
[32:48] and his word he will he is he he's more
[32:52] than willing to reveal himself unto you
[32:55] and and Satan hates revelation because
[32:58] it identifies that he's a liar and a
[33:00] loser and and his his final destination
[33:03] and and all these things Satan it just
[33:06] drives him crazy amen and so we see here
[33:09] in the story of job that that when the
[33:11] sons of God came by and to present
[33:13] themselves before the Lord that Satan
[33:16] was amongst them and you know we know
[33:18] that Spirits don't die and so Satan or
[33:21] God said to Satan he said have you
[33:23] considered my bride in Wyoming he said
[33:27] they are completely
[33:30] perfect don't doubt that cuz Romans 8:30
[33:33] says you're already glorified so you're
[33:35] already perfect if you don't that you
[33:37] don't the word of God you don't have to
[33:38] believe me but it would be good to
[33:40] believe the Bible and he said they're
[33:42] already perfect he said have you
[33:43] considered them and Satan said whoa whoa
[33:46] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa he said
[33:47] God that's not a fair com because he
[33:49] said you have a protection about them
[33:52] you built a hedge about job and he said
[33:55] I can't get to them ain't you glad that
[33:58] Satan can't get to you and work you over
[34:00] more than God
[34:02] permits he said I can't get to say God
[34:04] said well because of their perfection he
[34:07] said I will allow you to touch
[34:09] everything he
[34:12] has he's got a lot of confidence in
[34:15] you and so here we see that Satan
[34:18] touched everything God had and then
[34:21] Satan came back to the presence of God
[34:23] and God was very curious he already knew
[34:26] because he had total conf confidence in
[34:28] his predestinated plan he said how are
[34:30] you making out and and Satan of course
[34:34] because he's a liar he said now God he
[34:36] said that's still unfair because he said
[34:39] skin for skin he said you let me attack
[34:44] his body and he'll curse you to his face
[34:48] but God in the realm of of of his deity
[34:52] and we know that deity is not in heaven
[34:54] but it's in you this morning if you have
[34:56] the baptism of the Holy ghost it's on
[34:58] Earth and he said in his realm of deity
[35:01] he knew that was the lie because
[35:04] everything that comes out of Satan's
[35:05] mouth is a lie and he said okay he said
[35:09] you can touch his life but he said you
[35:12] can't take it now I want to tell you
[35:15] something this morning the reason that
[35:17] Satan can't take your life is it isn't
[35:19] his life for you to take he said you're
[35:22] a part of God's life not a part of
[35:24] Satan's life so Satan don't have the
[35:27] authority or the ability to take your
[35:30] life and here we see that that job went
[35:33] through all these
[35:34] trials and lost everything including his
[35:38] health and his church friends can buy
[35:41] three of them and we don't need friends
[35:44] like
[35:45] that and they said you know you're
[35:49] hiding something from God and he's
[35:50] getting even with you I want to tell you
[35:53] this morning we don't serve a God that
[35:55] gets even
[35:58] amen and these people that came before
[36:01] job were were just terrible people you
[36:05] know telling job he had all these uh
[36:08] disgusting problems hidden sins and all
[36:11] these problem I want to remind you
[36:13] something if something does somebody
[36:15] does that to
[36:16] you that the Bible says the
[36:20] accuser is
[36:22] Lucifer and he Tabernacles in bodies of
[36:26] Flesh so somebody says you're hiding
[36:28] something from me and you know that's
[36:30] the reason that it snowed this week
[36:32] because
[36:33] you're that's the reason you went in the
[36:35] ditch cuz you're hiding a sin oh that's
[36:38] that's the reason you know you don't
[36:40] have no money cuz you're hiding a sin
[36:42] that's just a lie from the
[36:45] devil and then we even see also job's
[36:48] wife came to him and she could see the
[36:51] wreck that he was in and she said why
[36:53] don't you just Curse God and die'
[36:57] and I want to jump through faster on
[36:59] this story and go to Job 38 and this
[37:04] just blessed my heart in Job 38 the
[37:07] Bible says that the Lord came and it was
[37:11] his turn to do the talking everybody
[37:14] else that had their piece of the pie and
[37:16] their piece of the
[37:17] action but God stepped on the scene he
[37:20] said now I'm going to do some talking
[37:23] and so in job you can pull that up job
[37:24] 38:1 it says and the Lord answered job
[37:27] out of
[37:28] Whirlwind and he said who is this darken
[37:33] counsel by words without knowledge now
[37:38] God very clearly told you what he
[37:40] thought of Satan's counsel through these
[37:42] friends of job he called it dark in
[37:45] counsel and without
[37:49] knowledge God could have said they were
[37:51] just flat out
[37:54] lies and here he orders job he said now
[37:57] gir up your loins like a man and I will
[38:00] demand of you now you need to pull that
[38:03] up verse three I'd like you to see that
[38:05] in in written form and here's God said I
[38:08] will demand of
[38:10] job an
[38:12] answer from you I want to tell you
[38:15] something this morning God I believe
[38:18] with all my heart is demanding an answer
[38:22] from each one of us he will demand
[38:25] that's not an option that's not a choice
[38:27] job
[38:28] 38:3 here's God now God already knew
[38:31] that job was
[38:33] perfect God already had complete
[38:36] confidence in who job was job was
[38:40] already a part of the predestinated plan
[38:42] of God and the reason I can say that is
[38:45] because that's how God had that much
[38:46] confidence in
[38:48] him and God still said I will demand an
[38:53] answer from
[38:55] you demand amen and this is the whole
[39:00] circumstance that the bride of Christ
[39:03] has to come to in our
[39:05] day because see not everyone that comes
[39:08] to
[39:12] church well when the sons of God came
[39:14] before God Satan was there also to
[39:19] present himself before the
[39:23] Lord so if Satan came to present himself
[39:26] before the Lord
[39:27] and deity is not in heaven but in Earth
[39:30] now it's not just in heaven but it's
[39:32] also in Earth then Satan will come
[39:34] around our mid and present himself
[39:37] before deity is that fair to
[39:44] say and this is the answer that God was
[39:48] expecting but this is the question that
[39:50] God answered job he said where were you
[39:54] when I laid the
[39:55] foundations of the Earth
[39:57] Earth declare an answer unto me if thou
[40:03] has understanding to my question here's
[40:07] God see if you can answer this question
[40:10] and answer it per properly it will
[40:13] identify who you are let me give you an
[40:17] example brother Brown said about 34
[40:19] times he talked about a mule was the
[40:22] most let me just jump this a mule was
[40:24] the most odly Godly thing that was ever
[40:26] created and in the
[40:29] world cuz a mu don't know who his papa
[40:31] is and who his mama is and it can't
[40:34] reproduce the deity of
[40:38] God he said ungodly and illegitimate and
[40:42] ungodly he said God had nothing to do
[40:45] with a
[40:47] meal about 30
[40:50] sometimes but there's a lot of mules
[40:52] that hang around the bride because it's
[40:55] scriptural that the M went right before
[40:58] the Lamb of God and presented
[41:02] themselves and the whole problem
[41:06] is I demand an
[41:09] answer is you must know who your daddy
[41:13] is if you know who your parents are and
[41:16] your grandparents and your family
[41:18] lineage you will know exactly where
[41:21] you're standing I'm not worried about
[41:23] how much my grandpa owned or my daddy
[41:26] owned because I understand it because I
[41:29] was in
[41:30] them now think spiritually amen if you
[41:34] understand that God's your heavenly
[41:36] father and you understand that you came
[41:39] from The Presence of Jehovah and he's
[41:41] tabernacled in flesh and deity you'll
[41:44] have no questions of where you're
[41:46] walking you'll have no questions of your
[41:48] healing yours you'll have no questions
[41:50] that he supplies all our needs amen
[41:53] because you understand your family
[41:55] lineage amen yeah but a mule don't have
[41:58] a
[41:59] clue here the prophet said you know let
[42:03] me let me just go into his thing just a
[42:05] little bit we'll go back to our
[42:06] scripture he said God had nothing to do
[42:09] with it he said they're the hardest
[42:11] headed thing you've ever seen is a mu he
[42:15] said you could preach to them for 15
[42:17] lifetimes and you'll never get through
[42:19] their head he said he said that's a lot
[42:23] of what that that we have to come to
[42:25] recognize who who is our mama and who is
[42:28] our Papa God's asking you did you come
[42:31] from me I demand of you where were
[42:35] you if you understand where you were
[42:37] before the foundation of the world
[42:39] you'll understand everything in your
[42:40] life
[42:41] today Hallelujah he said you watch a
[42:45] donkey you can holler at him and preach
[42:47] and all this here in his next quote he
[42:50] talked
[42:52] about they'll never understand because
[42:55] they don't know where they come but he
[42:56] said
[42:58] let me I want to get to something where
[42:59] he said
[43:02] here sorry he said but a mule you can
[43:06] never outwork a
[43:10] mu praise the Lord we're not saved on
[43:13] works praise the lord it's not my good
[43:15] my good past that's saving me amen he
[43:19] said a mule will work and work and work
[43:22] and all they do is honk honk
[43:25] honk and he said the the days of
[43:27] Miracles is past honk honk a half breed
[43:31] I'm supposed to be around this honk
[43:34] honk but he said you'll never outwork
[43:38] them because they're built for
[43:42] work but it wasn't works that God was
[43:44] saving on he said you could never I wish
[43:47] I I can't find that right now it's not
[43:49] coming up to
[43:50] me
[43:55] hallelujah oh watch this he say but you
[43:58] they're good workers he said they'll
[44:00] just work work work and work he said the
[44:02] four times he said Put Me In Mind of a
[44:04] bunch of Il uh I can't even say that
[44:07] word that's always trying to work their
[44:10] way to
[44:11] heaven he said that's right a mule the
[44:14] lady social society and a chicken for
[44:17] supper to pay the preacher and we got to
[44:20] have a dance in this society and this
[44:22] and that and they work it in this spot
[44:24] he says work six times he said they'll
[44:26] work work work work work work and
[44:35] work God wasn't one part of
[44:39] them amen and so God is demanding of us
[44:44] before we can go any further he says who
[44:47] are your
[44:48] parents who are your parents where was I
[44:51] when I laid the foundation verse 4 and
[44:53] verse 38 of job the foundation of the
[44:56] Earth declar unto me you got to answer
[44:58] me if thou has understanding thou H has
[45:01] who H has laid the measures thereof if
[45:04] thou knowest tell me or whom has
[45:07] stretched the line upon it it was him
[45:09] himself whereupon the foundations there
[45:12] were fasten or who laid the stone the
[45:15] Cornerstone thereof and then we know
[45:17] this very famous scripture job
[45:20] 38:7 and when the morning Stars sang
[45:24] together and all the sons of God soed
[45:27] for
[45:29] Joy where were
[45:33] you I'll tell you where I
[45:35] was I was the one with the big mouth
[45:39] there I was right there I was right
[45:42] there in them 100% in
[45:46] them God help us to understand we know
[45:50] that Genesis 1 and I know you've heard
[45:52] this thousands of times from me and I'm
[45:54] going to go faster at Genesis 1 126 and
[45:57] 7 that God created man and woman in his
[46:00] own image so if we have God's coming
[46:03] back and he said where were you where
[46:05] did you come from at the beginning if
[46:07] you understand where you came from then
[46:10] you'll understand everything he compared
[46:12] that like I said 30 some times to a
[46:14] thoroughbred horse he understands who
[46:17] his parents are his grandparent his
[46:19] whole family lineage amen and he and we
[46:23] understand too he said if you believe in
[46:24] that you have eternal life you've always
[46:27] had eternal life and we know that God is
[46:29] infinite and we came from God and I want
[46:32] to give you the definition or meaning of
[46:35] infinite it's Eternal the absolute the
[46:39] inexhaustible the bottomless the
[46:41] unending the unau and the
[46:47] on that's God and that's who you were a
[46:51] part of that's who you came out of we
[46:53] know Romans 9:16 it says I will have
[46:57] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[46:59] will have compassion on whom I will have
[47:02] compassion and so then it verse 16 so
[47:06] then it is not him that willth it's not
[47:08] the M that can work and work and work
[47:11] and work it's not him that willth nor
[47:13] him that runneth but it's God that
[47:16] showeth mercy and and you know like wow
[47:20] I would ask you I said you know in
[47:23] Romans or Revelation 138 it says that
[47:25] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[47:28] of the world where were you when the
[47:31] lamb was slain for my sins you know the
[47:34] accuser of the brethren we have to
[47:36] recognize that if you were in God and
[47:39] before the foundation of the world and
[47:41] you were there when he paid the price
[47:43] for my sins you can't see them you can't
[47:47] even remember them because you were in
[47:51] God you are a part of
[47:55] God hallelujah he said a real genuine
[47:58] Christian they were in him in the
[47:59] morning star when the when they sang
[48:02] together and the found the sons of God
[48:03] shuddered for Joy he said before the
[48:06] foundation of the world we
[48:08] identified in The Immortal Realm with
[48:11] God 10 million years before the world
[48:14] was ever formed I was
[48:17] there I was
[48:19] there and because I was there I know
[48:22] exactly where I'm going and who I am I'm
[48:25] a son and daughter of God this morning
[48:27] and if you got eternal life you were in
[48:29] them and so we want to look at some some
[48:32] some characters in The Bible and asked
[48:35] you where you were when God came down to
[48:39] Abraham and Sarah and gave them the
[48:42] promise for a
[48:44] son where were you declare unto me I was
[48:48] right there I heard him talking to
[48:51] Abraham it was me that heard Sarah laugh
[48:54] in the tent
[48:57] and God couldn't touch Sarah because she
[48:59] was a part of Abraham and if she would
[49:01] have killed Sarah she would have killed
[49:04] Abraham because they were
[49:06] one where were
[49:08] you when the sons of God showed it for
[49:11] Joy when God came down and dealt with
[49:14] Joseph and Joseph was rejected by his
[49:17] carnal brothers and sisters and sold
[49:20] into slavery and all of this where were
[49:23] you I was right there when the brothers
[49:25] were talking
[49:27] I was right there when I seen the money
[49:30] go in the merchants hands when they paid
[49:32] the price for Joseph to put him into
[49:35] slavery to actually protect his
[49:38] Brotherhood I was right
[49:40] there I was in him when I seen Joseph
[49:44] wrongly accused and threw in
[49:47] prison and I was also in God when God
[49:50] raised them up and put them on the right
[49:52] hand of the throne and all when Joseph
[49:55] went through the city all the people
[49:58] would bow and Shout to
[50:01] him where were you I remember it
[50:06] perfectly because I was
[50:10] there Jacob when he wrestled with the
[50:13] angel at night I was God's right arm
[50:16] that broke his
[50:17] will it took a long time but I was right
[50:20] there in the arm when I the next day my
[50:22] arm was hurting
[50:26] but I was right there when God broke
[50:28] Jacob's
[50:30] will where were
[50:34] you I demand of you to know the
[50:38] answer God demands of you Moses when God
[50:42] brought Moses and and showed himself in
[50:45] the burning bush I was there when God
[50:48] told Moses he said take off your shoes
[50:50] you're getting the ground
[50:55] dirty I was right there I was right
[50:58] there when Moses told God you're making
[51:00] a mistake cuz I don't talk right I got a
[51:04] bad si in my
[51:06] tongue and I was there when God's anger
[51:09] was kindled and
[51:13] boiled I was right
[51:16] there I was also right there when Moses
[51:19] went Before the Throne of the king and
[51:21] he threw down his rod and the musicians
[51:23] tried to compy the MU mules of the day
[51:26] threw down their rods and they turned to
[51:28] serpents too but he said it was God's
[51:31] serpent that ate them
[51:33] up I was right there I had a front row
[51:41] seat amen I was there when Moses led the
[51:47] children of Israel out of Egypt and they
[51:50] took the wealth of Egypt they they filed
[51:53] for bankruptcy afterwards for all their
[51:56] back Years of Slavery 400 and some years
[51:59] and they never left a penny or a hoof
[52:02] behind I was right
[52:06] there I was right
[52:11] there God help us that's see were you
[52:19] there can you
[52:21] remember can you remember the situation
[52:24] of the scenario around you do you
[52:27] remember all the crowds that were
[52:31] gathered God says I demand of
[52:35] you
[52:37] amen we have to be identified in God to
[52:41] understand where we came from and that's
[52:43] the reason that people that hang around
[52:45] the church got spiritual Amnesia and
[52:47] have drown cold it's because they don't
[52:49] know who their daddy
[52:51] is they don't know who their family is
[52:53] they don't know where they belong
[52:54] they're like an adopted child for their
[53:00] parents God help us in the Days of
[53:04] Elijah when Elijah was dealing with the
[53:07] evil King and
[53:08] Jezebel and when he went and sat under a
[53:10] juniper tree and said I'm the only one
[53:13] God kill
[53:17] me I was right there when God brought
[53:20] the Mana and fed him and then have them
[53:24] rest again because was so tired in his
[53:27] SP it was me that came down with God
[53:30] Amen were you there with me there was so
[53:33] many I can't remember all that were
[53:37] there but I demand of
[53:40] you not I but God right is that Bible
[53:44] God demands where were
[53:48] you Hallelujah when David was rejected
[53:52] by his Brethren when here here he watch
[53:55] this this is
[53:56] you there's so much things don't change
[53:59] in the Bible we get used to the stories
[54:01] but it's exactly the same scenario
[54:03] here's God's
[54:08] prophet and he couldn't even see like
[54:10] God
[54:11] seen Samuel he came and the first
[54:15] brother and he's got the oh it's already
[54:16] it's about ready to drip out of the
[54:19] God's like
[54:21] who that's not my
[54:25] man and he got a Vindicated prophet
[54:30] Samuel God said I don't see like you
[54:33] see I was
[54:35] there I was right there and he brought
[54:39] all the Brethren and you know look at
[54:40] how the Brethren rejected him and even
[54:42] as and Samuel comes and there's no more
[54:45] kids and Samuel says to the dad this is
[54:49] this is almost you know an insinuation
[54:51] of a lie is the same as a lie
[54:59] and Samuel said you don't got no more
[55:02] kids God Must Have
[55:06] Forgot well well you know we got this
[55:10] little tiny Church paints falling Offa
[55:13] he's out watching the
[55:14] Sheep they're not he he's he's
[55:24] running David was rejected by his
[55:26] brothers and even his dad he was an
[55:30] afterthought wow but God knew he was
[55:35] there God never
[55:38] forgot you know if we look at that story
[55:42] and this is amazing and I I mentioned it
[55:44] before but you know when David went to
[55:46] his his brothers that were in war and
[55:49] he's just taken them a samri he's in
[55:51] complete obedience to what he's supposed
[55:53] to do and his brothers think he's
[55:54] putting on a big show
[55:59] it wasn't David putting on a show he was
[56:01] just obeying his mom and
[56:02] dad God have mercy on us be careful what
[56:06] we say and do
[56:08] amen David was
[56:11] there the Hebrew children when they went
[56:15] to the fiery
[56:16] furnace you see I was there when Israel
[56:19] lost in battle and I was there when the
[56:22] king took all the best of Israel the
[56:24] best of slaves the smartest and the most
[56:27] handy back to his
[56:30] kingdom here he builds an image to
[56:33] worship the Prophet
[56:35] Daniel Daniel would have never allowed
[56:38] it because he was gone away to a far
[56:40] country he wasn't on the scene and they
[56:43] blew the trumpet and all the children of
[56:45] Israel just fell down and worshiped that
[56:48] image except
[56:51] three I was there when he brought them
[56:54] up to the king and he said don't you
[56:55] know I have the
[56:59] power
[57:02] Hallelujah only the power that God
[57:04] allows you to have is the only Power you
[57:07] got those Hebrew children I was right
[57:10] there when they spelled it out they said
[57:12] we're not even
[57:14] careful how we live our
[57:17] life because we know who our daddy is
[57:20] yes and we're not even careful about how
[57:23] we serve you because we know that God
[57:26] God is the
[57:27] boss and you're just a an intermediate
[57:30] puppet that's using for God to pull the
[57:33] strings you know go the B brother Brown
[57:35] said that Satan works is a tool for
[57:39] God the countries of the world are tools
[57:42] that God huh you know all these words
[57:45] are just tools that God
[57:48] just he setting up the world stage and
[57:51] we're going to go home one of these days
[57:53] and all hell's going to break loose on
[57:55] this Earth
[57:56] amen but you're only going to go home if
[57:58] you know who you are amen where you came
[58:02] from they said we're not even careful
[58:06] how we answer you because we know that
[58:08] our God our daddy is able to deliver us
[58:12] and if he doesn't Deliver us we'll be in
[58:14] his presence so it makes zero difference
[58:17] to us what the outcome is to a live is
[58:20] gain and die is to be in The Presence of
[58:23] Jehovah I was there I was there when
[58:26] when Daniel was thrown in the lying
[58:28] stand wrongfully accused because of
[58:31] jealousy and you know if we look at the
[58:33] story of Daniel you know there is
[58:36] nowhere in the Bible or the message of
[58:37] that day that said you had to pray with
[58:39] your windows open there is nowhere in
[58:41] the Bible or in the message of that day
[58:43] they said you had to pray out loud
[58:45] because the B actually the very opposite
[58:47] the Bible says that what you do in
[58:49] secret God will hear and reward you
[58:53] openly so most of us message Believers
[58:55] this this is what we would have did if
[58:57] we were reliving in Daniel's Age
[59:01] We God bless this
[59:03] food God is neat let's
[59:06] eat cuz we wouldn't want nobody at the
[59:08] restaurant to know that we were
[59:13] Believers but Daniel wouldn't change his
[59:16] lifestyle how he prayed and how he
[59:19] opened his
[59:20] windows and the amount of times he
[59:23] prayed and of course he was through in
[59:25] the lon and and you know the prophet
[59:28] says different things but I want to tell
[59:29] you something this morning you know it
[59:31] was God is love it was love brother
[59:33] Brown said that it was a boundary of
[59:34] love but I want to tell you something
[59:37] you know why Daniel wasn't afraid of
[59:38] those
[59:41] Lions cuz he was there when God created
[59:45] them God was there when that Lon was
[59:47] just a little tiny old little kitty cat
[59:50] this little fuzzy thing he held them up
[59:54] scratches he was there before the fall
[59:56] when the lion laid down with the
[59:58] lamb Daniel remembered that perfectly a
[1:00:02] lion why we used to go for walks with
[1:00:05] them i' take brother Bark's rod and go
[1:00:07] for a walk take the dog take the lion
[1:00:09] with
[1:00:10] me he was my
[1:00:15] body he could do that because he was
[1:00:18] there before the foundation of the
[1:00:22] world and for us to understand that we
[1:00:24] must be identified in Christ and
[1:00:28] Calvary and all that he did you know the
[1:00:31] Bible says this that we're already seed
[1:00:35] with him in Heavenly
[1:00:37] places and he conquered all the power of
[1:00:39] the earth and
[1:00:41] hell and we're in
[1:00:44] him watch what the Bible says you know I
[1:00:48] I already mentioned this but in Romans
[1:00:51] uh 3:24 and then in Romans 51 but in
[1:00:55] Romans 3 24 he said being justified
[1:00:57] freely by grace through the Redemption
[1:01:00] that is in Christ Jesus but this one
[1:01:03] here brother Brown talks about more in
[1:01:05] Romans
[1:01:06] 51 he said therefore being justified by
[1:01:12] faith this is something that we need to
[1:01:14] stop and look at for a few
[1:01:16] minutes
[1:01:18] because brother Brown said you never
[1:01:21] ever did
[1:01:23] Sin and I never did either
[1:01:26] because see if you answer the question
[1:01:29] where were you when the sons of God
[1:01:32] showed it for Joy if you were in him and
[1:01:36] you came out of him God can't
[1:01:40] sin and God's word says that you are God
[1:01:45] Amen our message says that you're
[1:01:49] deity when they were going to throw ston
[1:01:51] you're looking at me funny when they
[1:01:52] were going to throw stones at Jesus
[1:01:54] Jesus said don't your own bible say that
[1:01:56] you are
[1:01:58] Gods the only God that the world will
[1:02:01] ever know yes is in you this morning I
[1:02:04] want to show you something in John in
[1:02:06] John 1 I believe it's 13 it says and the
[1:02:09] word became flesh and dwell among them I
[1:02:12] want to tell you something that the
[1:02:13] prophet said he said I can show you
[1:02:15] where he sent it and you try to show me
[1:02:18] where he took it
[1:02:19] away amen amen that's
[1:02:23] great and aen take it away when Jesus
[1:02:26] went back to heaven and the word became
[1:02:29] flesh and dwelt among them and the word
[1:02:33] is God in the beginning was the word and
[1:02:34] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:02:37] God so when you become the word you are
[1:02:40] God in flesh today so God didn't change
[1:02:43] it the word in flesh is still
[1:02:46] here that's why he said that you were
[1:02:49] justified by faith and Justified means
[1:02:52] you never sinned in the first place oh
[1:02:54] this body did but this ain't me this was
[1:02:57] just a tabernacle that my spirit in
[1:03:01] indwelt in to come to Earth to prove to
[1:03:04] Satan that not all people would bow
[1:03:06] their knee To His
[1:03:09] Image that's ex that's 100% the Bible
[1:03:12] and the
[1:03:13] message
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:19] 100% therefore being justified by faith
[1:03:22] we have peace with God through our Lord
[1:03:24] Jesus Christ that's
[1:03:26] understanding where you came from and
[1:03:29] when I understand where I come from it
[1:03:30] don't matter who shows me fiery furnaces
[1:03:33] or says God's not the same today or we
[1:03:35] need to see God I just showed you three
[1:03:38] amazing examples where people were going
[1:03:39] to have their bladder on their outside
[1:03:41] of their body where they wanted to do
[1:03:42] surgery where they couldn't identify
[1:03:44] cancer and where a hip was perfectly
[1:03:46] healed now like the doctors couldn't do
[1:03:49] that they're going to I met sister
[1:03:52] sarin's brother I was there when had a
[1:03:56] clean bill a house you can't take that
[1:03:58] away from me I was there
[1:04:00] before 10 million years before that am I
[1:04:05] was in
[1:04:07] him he's the same yesterday today
[1:04:09] forever he ain't nothing at
[1:04:14] all so none of these fireworks around
[1:04:17] that don't even fiz me because I know
[1:04:20] who my daddy is
[1:04:23] am amen
[1:04:27] that's how you have to be God says I God
[1:04:32] watch this God came to job and demanded
[1:04:35] this after him after he had already told
[1:04:38] Satan that he was
[1:04:41] perfect and you know what it was God
[1:04:44] wanted to hear out of job's own mouth
[1:04:47] what God already
[1:04:50] knew let let me read this God wanted to
[1:04:53] hear out of your mouth what he already
[1:04:55] knows about you God already knows
[1:04:58] whether you came from him or not he
[1:05:01] knows it perfectly he he knows
[1:05:03] your but he wants to hear what do you
[1:05:06] say what what did he say when they said
[1:05:08] who's the son of man what do they say I
[1:05:11] am and Peter said those you are the
[1:05:13] Christ the son of the Living God what do
[1:05:16] you
[1:05:18] say what do you say I demand of you
[1:05:21] where were you when I laid the
[1:05:23] foundation of the world I was there when
[1:05:25] he built Canada I wasn't in favor called
[1:05:30] North but I was
[1:05:35] there I was deal talking to one of the
[1:05:38] pastors we were there we we preached in
[1:05:40] five different churches and sometimes
[1:05:41] there was five or well there was at
[1:05:43] least one service there was six
[1:05:45] different pastors there in multiple
[1:05:46] churches and that was a beautiful form
[1:05:49] of
[1:05:50] unity and I was sending him some
[1:05:52] pictures yesterday I sent him a quote
[1:05:54] that came up to me and I said we we got
[1:05:56] a bunch of snow and it's fairly cold out
[1:05:58] this morning I sent him some pictures
[1:05:59] outside and he ran out the front of his
[1:06:01] house and he was showing me all the
[1:06:02] mango trees and all the palm trees and
[1:06:05] all that people saw wood and it you
[1:06:11] know I was
[1:06:16] there
[1:06:18] Hallelujah and you
[1:06:20] know if you were there and you were in
[1:06:24] them when the was slain before the
[1:06:26] foundation of the
[1:06:28] world you won't
[1:06:31] judge anybody not even the world not
[1:06:38] here because the Bible says that God
[1:06:40] would that all would be saved now he
[1:06:42] knew they wouldn't be because he was
[1:06:46] infinite but you know the Bible and I I
[1:06:48] preached on that a bunch when we were in
[1:06:50] El Salvador you know there's not one
[1:06:52] place in the message of the Bible where
[1:06:54] God gives us the right to judge in this
[1:06:56] earth you don't get the right to judge
[1:06:57] until after the Rapture and we sit on
[1:06:59] the throne with him then we judge the
[1:07:01] world but we'll be
[1:07:04] perfectly and we'll have the character
[1:07:06] to judge you you watch brother Bram
[1:07:09] brother Braham showed it his life how
[1:07:12] God God allowed Satan to tempt them to
[1:07:16] judge brother Brown never ever did it
[1:07:19] remember when he said to the people he
[1:07:21] said Satan's built a trap for you and
[1:07:23] they're going to make love on the front
[1:07:25] seat
[1:07:26] just imagine to the presence of God
[1:07:29] that's in this place today is no
[1:07:31] different than in the place when brother
[1:07:32] Bram was here I know you were going to
[1:07:34] think it was greater but it's not if you
[1:07:36] think it's greater you got respects to
[1:07:38] God and you're you're going to hell cuz
[1:07:41] it was no
[1:07:44] greater you know I I told them some
[1:07:47] pretty straight things down there I
[1:07:48] didn't go to Salvador to be popular I
[1:07:50] said we have a lot of things mixed up in
[1:07:52] our churches we have deacons that are
[1:07:54] throwing people into the church that the
[1:07:56] church is is a
[1:07:59] hospital you're throwing people out
[1:08:01] there coming for healing of the baptism
[1:08:03] of the Holy Ghost and you're throwing
[1:08:04] them
[1:08:05] out you need to fire all your deacons
[1:08:08] and get
[1:08:12] converted you want to see the real Holy
[1:08:14] Ghost I forgive
[1:08:17] you what about the man that came up
[1:08:19] there there was nuts and he killed a
[1:08:21] bunch of people come up to brother Bram
[1:08:23] where were the deacons in that church
[1:08:25] they failed
[1:08:27] miserably oh bless God they should
[1:08:29] protect the
[1:08:33] prophet and the pastors scattered behind
[1:08:35] them like
[1:08:37] flies cuz they didn't know where they
[1:08:40] came from because they were
[1:08:44] fearful and he fell on brother bram's
[1:08:51] feet that's the kind of judging brother
[1:08:54] brandham did
[1:08:58] Amazing
[1:09:00] Grace because see he had that because he
[1:09:04] was there he was there when the lamb was
[1:09:06] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:09:09] and he seen the purpose and thought of
[1:09:11] God because he was in
[1:09:13] it he was
[1:09:16] there
[1:09:18] Hallelujah he said we stand perfectly
[1:09:21] before God Justified means that you
[1:09:24] never did it in the first place he
[1:09:26] brother Bram gives an example of
[1:09:28] somebody I I know you maybe heard this
[1:09:30] you know somebody would say I seen you
[1:09:32] smoking brother Bram and and I forgive
[1:09:34] you for smoking but brother Bram said
[1:09:36] forgive me what how could you forgive me
[1:09:38] I never did
[1:09:40] it I forgive you brother Dale for being
[1:09:43] who you
[1:09:44] are but this ain't even
[1:09:48] me I'm not going to be fighting
[1:09:52] Heaven this is just my Tabernacle
[1:10:00] here the prophet says he said Justified
[1:10:02] don't mean that you're forgiven you
[1:10:04] can't forgive something that I never
[1:10:07] did hello that's right how can you
[1:10:10] forgive somebody when they never even
[1:10:12] did it like so how can we judge when
[1:10:15] we're judging something that they never
[1:10:23] did wow
[1:10:28] God help us and he said you never did it
[1:10:33] because that little germ that was in
[1:10:37] you that little germ is who your daddy
[1:10:40] is that was to be you before the
[1:10:43] foundation of the
[1:10:45] world and see God put your name in the
[1:10:48] Lamb's Book of Life and all the
[1:10:50] preachers in the world can't take my
[1:10:52] name out and they can't take yours out
[1:10:54] either and I will under any of them that
[1:10:56] tried
[1:11:00] to
[1:11:02] amen a thoroughbred
[1:11:05] horse knows who his daddy is that's
[1:11:08] right yes sir and a mule is the most
[1:11:12] illegitimate and wicked and sinful thing
[1:11:16] that was ever
[1:11:18] created God help us here the prophet
[1:11:22] says that Harmony now exists between the
[1:11:25] groom and his bride and he'll show her
[1:11:28] his word of life and she receives it
[1:11:31] just like the word was in
[1:11:33] marry and deity and we know what God
[1:11:37] wants done with it but just like when
[1:11:40] Jesus was here on Earth everybody judged
[1:11:44] all his
[1:11:45] decisions you ever wonder why somebody
[1:11:48] judges everything you do I wonder why
[1:11:51] you did that I wonder why you did that
[1:12:01] but you have the mind of God and you
[1:12:04] know exactly how to handle you do not
[1:12:08] just the pre I'm not talking about
[1:12:09] preacher I'm saying you the this ain't
[1:12:12] an elevated case ministers won't be
[1:12:14] higher in
[1:12:15] heaven it'll be brothers and sisters
[1:12:19] period we'll all be his wife period it
[1:12:23] won't be a bigger wife and a little wife
[1:12:26] that that's
[1:12:31] disgusting so when somebody questions
[1:12:34] well Wonder way you brother Berard I
[1:12:35] wonder way you know who it is
[1:12:40] Satan 100% Satan the Bible says
[1:12:43] that because you have the baptism of the
[1:12:46] Holy Ghost deities dwelling in flesh the
[1:12:48] word became flesh and never went
[1:12:53] away amen
[1:12:56] and he will fulfill his whole plan
[1:13:00] through
[1:13:02] us I mean the worldwide bride his whole
[1:13:06] plan he's fulfilling through you you you
[1:13:08] every one of you and the worldwide not
[1:13:10] just this church but I mean the
[1:13:12] worldwide bride God's working in you
[1:13:15] what it's what your hands do it's what
[1:13:18] your
[1:13:21] amen hallelujah John one John 1 John
[1:13:25] 3 1 and 2 behold what manner of love the
[1:13:29] father has bestowed upon us that we
[1:13:31] shall be called the sons of
[1:13:35] God therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:13:38] that's not a big surprise a bless God
[1:13:41] we're not recognized in
[1:13:46] the because he knew him
[1:13:48] not if the world didn't know Jesus you
[1:13:52] know me you know I always said this I
[1:13:55] said this in Old Salvador doing a bunch
[1:13:57] of Miracles won't let the world
[1:13:58] recognize the
[1:14:00] Miracles won't recognize God that's
[1:14:05] Bible I give you two examples the Bible
[1:14:07] says let me show two examples when
[1:14:10] Israel came out of Egypt was there any
[1:14:12] more miracles created in that time when
[1:14:15] the let me see the Flies the blood the
[1:14:17] water the the serpent uh the help me out
[1:14:22] the darkness the the all the first their
[1:14:25] cattle their livestock died uh the
[1:14:28] firstborn
[1:14:29] died frogs okay and all those people
[1:14:34] just sat and watch it and they went
[1:14:38] wow that's right wouldn't that be cool
[1:14:41] would just cause flies to come to
[1:14:43] Wyoming and they all cross the Red Sea
[1:14:46] and curse God and a whole bunch of them
[1:14:48] God swallowed up and never even let them
[1:14:51] walk in the
[1:14:53] desert I'll give you another example
[1:14:55] would you like to see that brother Brown
[1:14:57] said when he identified Revelations he
[1:14:59] said when the Antichrist comes on the
[1:15:02] earth and they do signs and wonders he
[1:15:04] said that would be Atomic Warfare that
[1:15:06] was the United States that was the
[1:15:09] devil so if you're looking for me to
[1:15:11] just make your
[1:15:15] arm that don't mean
[1:15:18] nothing God can do it but I'm not if God
[1:15:22] does it or not that's his choice if God
[1:15:25] tells me to oh for sure I'll be the
[1:15:27] first I'll be on first
[1:15:30] base God's got that all ability we have
[1:15:33] to understand when Jesus went to the
[1:15:35] pool he healed one person he stepped
[1:15:38] over all the sick
[1:15:40] people and I'll be flat out honest with
[1:15:42] you if I would have been one of the
[1:15:43] other ones I would have been
[1:15:48] offended if I wouldn't have knew where I
[1:15:50] come from
[1:15:56] there wasn't one person that he stepped
[1:15:58] over that was offended if they knew who
[1:16:00] their daddy
[1:16:05] was
[1:16:07] amen Now Grant you
[1:16:10] be we see all these signs and wonders if
[1:16:14] you don't think so you should have been
[1:16:16] with me in El Salvador we see multiple
[1:16:19] Miracles we don't have to go to a
[1:16:21] Salvador we see them in New Foundland we
[1:16:22] see them here there's all kind kinds of
[1:16:25] Miracles sitting here my ears aren't
[1:16:26] bothering me this morning sister
[1:16:28] Patricia ain't taking a puffer this
[1:16:29] morning and on and on and on and on and

[1:16:46] breath
