so and just pray for me that God will Minister this morning to all of us and also welcome brother Jeff and sister dlin you know brother Jeff was talking to me last week and it was 5 years ago when they planned on moving here and and uh God's timing is perfect it took God 5 years to maybe it didn't take God five years but it took us 5 years to get ready for God to do whatever he needed to do amen and we definitely welcome you and we love Fellowship God love Fellowship so that means you love Fellowship too and uh plan on having some of that after church with many or some visitors coming and just uh welcome God in our midst as Isaiah 61 the spirit of the Lord of God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach the Good Tidings unto the meek and he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Proclaim Liberty to the captive and to open the prison to them that are bound and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and to appoint to them that mourn in Zion and to give unto them Beauty for Ashes and oil of the joy for mourning and the Garment of Praise And The Spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord God that God that God might be glorified Lord Jesus we pray that you would have your way in everything that's done today everything that's done and said and Lord we're not sure this might be a part two two or part one of part two and whatever your will is Lord God we pray you'll Fe feed us your Mana we pray amen God bless you you may have your seats man I want to preach on the plans of God for us and God has plans for us and you know we were we preached uh the last time I was up a couple weeks ago we were preaching on you know the cop Stone and add to your faith virtue and and you know in in second Peter fir uh 1 for it was that we were given exceeding precious promises but it was our choice whether we accept or stepped into them and when we step into those exceeding precious promises we might become partakers of the divine nature of God and so I want to I have a question for you and I don't mean it's for us but you know in the natural we live in a world that we have the best hospital we had the best doctors we have the best medications and we've never had a world more sick than we have in this world the Indians were miles ahead of us but now let's look spiritually you know spiritually speaking we have never had a message like this we have never had a revelation like this we have never had the internet that spreads all the great m messages around the world that you can listen to on a daily basis like this day we have never had the word unfold and like the prophet said it became a brand new book to us and in that exact same day we have never had a colder Church a more lukewarm Church we've never had people and Believers so stagnated and Frozen in their their their life with all of the revelation and the perfect message which is Christ he didn't like nothing that's right you know if we ever come to a revelation and we come into the full position of Christ you will lose your mind when you come together you'll be the noisiest Church brother Bram said when you get to heaven you'll be the noisiest place you've ever been but by Bible says we're living in Heavenly places now so something's all messed up something's all messed up cuz we're not living in Heavenly places if it's not like heaven now come on Amen and there's one reason for all of that it one of maybe two or three reasons but one is either you don't have a sacrifice or you don't have a fresh sacrifice you're not in a living relationship with Christ where he's number one and it don't matter to you if the bills are paid or the kids are sick or the car's got a flat tire it don't matter to you if the if the church is full or empty it don't matter to you if it's Wednesday night or Sunday morning amen you're serving God and you know the Bible says that he Jesus praised the father he said I I thank you God that you hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes and I want to show you in the Bible the things that God expected us to reach out and grab on to the exceedingly precious and great promises you know we have to have him Lord of our life not just savior of our life we have to have him Lord of our life not just healer of our life we have to have him Lord of our life not just provider of our life we have to have him Lord of our life not just for in the Happy Times amen and we see an example and I'm just going to use this example quickly in Genesis 22 where Abraham God gave him and I'm I'm just I'm just going to be blind I I I pray this don't offend you and God you forgive me ahead of time but God gave Abraham a ridiculous plan an insane plan murder murder your family member it was the most insane ridiculous plan maybe ever recorded in the Bible but the Bible says and when we were talking about Saul that obedience was better than sacrifice and you know God has some most ridiculous man you know coming to church on Wednesday night when it's minus 20 is an exceedingly insane plan it's exceedingly ridiculous and it's maybe could be almost murder but that was part of God's plan says forsake not the assembling of yourself together the Bible says pray without ceasing that means every day that means all the time that means not just when it's Wednesday night amen you know brother Bram said and I'm way miles ahead of my quote but you know brother Bram said you say why I wonder why the church is so Dad when's the last time you prayed and fasted brother Bram said the only reason for the benefit of his meanings was because of the people that fasted and prayed and I have quotes here where he talked about sisters that had fasted and prayed for 8 days and he specifically called them out in the meanings because they had prayed and fasted when's the last time you fasted for your pastor when was the last time your pastor fasted for you are we living in Heavenly places or are we just pretending you know when you look at this he said the fasting in the natural naturally it's called the tonomy and it's a 24 hours in 24 hours it it does a a cleaning process I does the church ever need a cleaning process process woo the cleaning process you just got to fast for me for 24 hours this whole place will be cleaned out amen a cleaning process and after 24 hours it starts removing cells of cancer and sicknesses and the Aging autonomy is removed under the period and it goes up 300% after fasting 36 hours but because we don't do that are we grabbing on to the exceedingly impresses promises you know these were just simple basic things that God put in the word and so now we can watch the greatest ministers in the world on internet what's it done for us it's made us cold indifferent formal LAX amen amen and all these great things it's because you hav't prayed you haven't fasted you haven't come to church on Wednesday night you haven't you haven't done the multiple things you know you know the Bible says you know I was saying this you know in a honeymoon period and and and I mentioned this on Wednesday night about a month ago in anything that starts new there's all kinds of things done in secret when you're in your honeymoon or you're starting a new business even when the country started all kinds of people would do things in secret with no intent to be seen on the Internet Bible says that if you enter into your closet and pray in secret God will reward now I'll guarantee you I'll take God's beneficiary plan God said what you do in secret if you would enter in your closet and pray in secret that he will reward you openly and we're supposed to be living in Heavenly places so we're supposed to have all these exceeding and great and precious promises maybe our closets got dust on them like our Bibles come on Amen maybe we haven't been doing these things in secret brother Brown said when you pray arms to do them in secret not to let your right hand know what your left hand does it's not for the minister not for the it's for the kingdom of God for the edifying of God's body amen some of the greatest times that we've had in this church in the last year have been on Wednesday night and I know for a fact that there's some of you that absolutely cannot in the physical place and that that you live could be here but there's many of you half of you that make a medical and calculated decision every Wednesday night to stay home and watch I Love Lucy because you have brother Brown said because your love for that is greater than your love for your sacrifice you're not coming Wednesday night to see me cuz I'm we're not even coming Wednesday night to see each other we're not even coming Wednesday night to see what you think God will do we're coming Wednesday night in obedience to the plan of God to unfold these great and exceeding and precious promises and what we do in secret God will reward us openly and the ones that do those things in secret are why they have the most Victorious Life and the most happy family in home God help us God help me did there you know we either have go no sacrifice or we don't have a fresh sacrifice and I would say in most cases we don't have a fresh sacrifice and that brings a lack of discipline and lack of Desire lack of commitment and we just well you know yeah yeah but you know when you start out something new and you start out your marriage life you're very sacrificed you have a great commitment you do all kinds of things hidden behind the scenes to make it wonderful but what happens is this word and the presence of the anointing you know the Bible says that those that have felt the presence of the anointing and leave it there's no sacrifice for them the reason being is because it became come man the greatest thing in the world that ever struck the world is what you're living in right now and the the revelation of the Bible there's not a people walking on the earth that has even a fraction of the Revelation and unfolding of the word that you have but what could a minister tell me what could anybody tell me you know brother Brown said you know you know he has two quot I you love things like this he said and this is at the tail and I wasn't even sure I was he said you know if you say well I got the Holy Ghost and and the Holy Ghost is a teacher so I don't need anybody to teach you he actually says two things very strong there and I I desperately love our Prophet he's such a amazing person he says number one I doubt your experience that means you have no sacrifice and he said you know the other thing he said on that and this will offend you and it offended me too so you know we'll be sitting right side by side he said you need your brains baptized you're you're so out to L you need your brains baptized more than your soul like basically the prophet saying you're and that's how we've tried to serve him by not obeying God's word and not falling into lineing all these things it's not just one part you know that in it's in 1 Corinthians you can pull this out 1 Corinthians 131-10 and verse 13 He says though I speak with tongues of angels and have not charity I become as a sounding brass and tinkling symbol and though I have the gifts of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries which we do and know have the knowledge we have the knowledge and though I have faith all this great faith so I could remove mountains and we do remove mountains CU we've had healings in our midst great healings and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to the poor and you you give your money like you wouldn't believe and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing now I want you to go to verse four and I want to go through this slowly love suffers Amen period that means you're going to do things for God that aren't exciting that means fast pray in your closet and I won't even know you're praying for me till God rewards you openly I me come to church on Wednesday night and say w Glory brother Dale's going to minister and then we're all going to get to pray that's right really well I'm so excited to pray would you rather not be able to pray would you be like the people that God don't have a sacrifice and he don't have to answer your prayer you may be lived in that world for a while you'd be really happy to get in the other world love suffers and it don't just suffer for a few years it don't just suffer for the honeymoon it don't suffer till I feeling better it don't suffer until I think everybody's lined up to my Doctrine It suffers long and it's kind uhoh o you mean I got to be kind to that person oh they give me a headache where a pill would reach and charity envieth not that means it don't matter who's on the internet I I'm not concerned about being the center of attention do you know I I want to tell you something that you might be surprised this ain't a oneman Ministry and a pastor ain't a oneman Ministry and we're not writing a movie and I'm not the only person in the script just to let you know we're all in the script together amen if you don't say Amen brother Bram said I couldn't even preach if you didn't say amen that's right we need a good dose of heat man we should praise God it's our Lord we're praising it's our savior we're PR oh blessed be the name of oh Lord oh I ain't got my bills paid I told you I confessed it to literally it took me two Sundays to come back and get used to preaching after I was in Nicaragua in El Salvador that you would have to be a minister to understand what that's like it was like a like it was like a punch in the head some of the same ministers messages I preached there that were 3 hours long and people were like exploding I preached here in 40 minutes and I went home and I didn't know if anybody cared about him love vth not itself well bless God that's not the way I would run everything it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemingly and it does not seek it its own well if they're not going to do it the way I see it well like I'm not going to stay there you know there's one other reason why the the the world and the in the situation is cold it's either because they have no sacrifice they don't have a fresh sacrifice or you're not in the place where you want to be let me explain that you know and and I I don't mean I don't mean that here because I don't I don't feel that but in churches where people are going because it's too far to go to their favorite church if you're coming here just because it's within driving range and you would rather be at that church that's why you come here and you're like oh wow I wished I could be there but God ain't allowed me to move can't afford to I don't have a job there oh why they even have specials on Wednesday night and got five Pastors in their church and that's another reason the body gets stagnant cold sour indifferent cuz you don't even desire really to be here that's why so few come on Wednesday night because it's not your favorite Church you either have no sacrifice or it's not your favorite church and the other churches have a bigger deal on Wednesday night and so I'll stay home watch it on internet amen easily provoked thinkest no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth and beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and doth all things love love never fails so if we have love that means we're in Heavenly places right now and and like you know noise don't scare me disorderly don't scare me we could use a little disorderly if we were worshiping God Amen never scared me bet how come we think that brother Bram was so right but we don't obey what he he said said I couldn't even preach you don't say amen I can't hear you amen I can't I couldn't even I couldn't even preach if you didn't pray and fast for me it's like well you know like you know I didn't expect it anyway you know the Bible says here in John 15:2 it says every branch that beareth forth fruit he taketh away from now watch this this means every branch that beareth forth he cuts you that means if you're bearing fruit this morning for Jesus Christ he's going to hurt you he's going to hurt you he's going to hurt you he's going to offend you God's going to offend you it ain't me we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers God's allowing it to happen to offend you so you can bring for wor much fruit I'm not saying leave the word I don't say I'm not saying for one minute you sit under me or anybody that's off the word you run for your life that you you you that's the only way you can survive is on the word but if you're on the word God's going to cut you and you're not going to like it you say well but bless God I was happy just serving you as a modern day Chris I didn't really want to get involved I didn't really want to sing a special I didn't really ever want to testify or do communion or foot wash I don't want to get in that [Music] messy John 152 he purges it so it will bring much more fruit I say bring on the Cotton snippers just bring on the snippers snip me and snip me and snip me that's the only way we're going to live in Heavenly places you know in John Revelations here John he said the angel said to John come up hither and I'll show you things which must surely come to pass the reason we're not coming up we're not quiet enough for him to ever speak to us you know John was in the island of pment that was his prison yes he had nothing to do but serve God and God could speak to him because he wasn't worried about the I know perfectly well the om is bad I know many people are out of work and many people that do got work don't have enough money I'm sitting right beside you come up hither and I'll show you what here must be Hereafter and immediately John was in the spirit you know what takes time to get in the spirit of God you can't just wake up and you know it's a preparation what you did last week's affecting the service today what you did last week what you did yesterday is really affecting what you did in this service but what you did all week is the fact that here brother Brown said he said the world is forced this way and that way but God forces his up whereare the spirit of God it it which is the word of God is my word is spirit and life and the bride and th will put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize the position in the word and she is in Christ and it'll put her in her PL here you know and I'm just going through examples in the Bible because we don't like all of the Bible or all of the message in first uh Thessalonians it says pray without ceasing most of us never pray many don't even have a prayer life I don't mean on your knees you can pray anywhere you can pray walking riding a truck driving a semi you can pray in bed amen the first thing you can do when you wake up is oh Lord help me help me I I do that as soon as I wake up before I move I'm praying we already went through the fasting and that's in that's in Matthew 17:14 to2 24 and here that Jesus told the disciples they came and now now Jesus had sent now these were right that had walked with Jesus e like they had a relationship like they were they went to prayer meeting on Wednesday night and Jesus sent them out endued with power and they couldn't throw out these demons they came to Jesus that actually the person with them came to Jesus said can you save me and Jesus did and then the disciples said why can't we do that why can't we sit in Heavenly places right now in Wyoming when it's cold it's CU cuz you don't fast cuz this part only happens by prayer and fasting that's why that's Matthew 172 24- 21 how be it this kind goe with I out except by prayer and fasting here the prophet says he says you you know your pastor can't do everything it takes the members of the church he said help support the meaning he's actually he said you support the meanings with your Finance you support it with your prayers he said two little women here hit away these eight days of the meaning fasting and praying for the meanings he said that's the reason that these meanings today are a success they said because those two sisters he said not only them but there was others that been fasting fasting fasting and praying backing me up with your wonderful faith of Jesus Christ here talking about prayer the what God sees in secret we already mentioned that he will reward you openly that's also in Matthew 6 God help us here the prophet mentions again he said the success of our meanings is because real godly people pray and that's it that's the reason of success of the meetings prayers and you we know we already mentioned that you know the every new movement every new church age every new secret of success was because of people doing stuff behind the scenes but our attitude today is well that's not my job God never called me to preach I don't feel I'm a prayer Warrior I don't see no benefit to that how's it going to help me is it going to affect my family we've lost the attraction and it ain't to Wyoming cuz Wyoming can be ugly we've lost the attraction to Christ we've lost the attraction that he's our Lord we've lost the attraction that he's everything he's your living desire you know you know you know I'm having a birthday today but it's been real winter and I've been looking over pictures and I'll just tell you what I don't care if you're five you're getting old you're getting old time is a blur you know I had pictures out there where I was one year old and my mom and dad were hiding me and we were in what Prince Edward Island or somewhere Sudbury I had an uncle lived there life is a blur tomorrow you'll be in the destination that you prepared for but because of the the the the the LIE of Satan that makes us come in and get so subtle and subdued and like become common I pray to God that we'll never become calm and that like well that's just you know that's just sister Donna that's just brother Carson oh you know I mean we that's just brother Matt you know that's just brother Lauren you know are we going to get to heaven and say well that's just that's just brother Lauren we're in heaven like you know well I don't think you'll say that Hebrews 10 23 and 25 says hold let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering we been doing a lot of wavering yeah yeah a lot of wavering to reach out and grab the exceedingly exceedingly and great and precious promises look at how the Bible writes that exceedingly and great and precious by prayer and fasting hold fast to A procession without wavering for he that is faithful the promis considered one another provoke each other to love and good works not forsaking the assembling of yourself together and the manner that some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching you know we're the only country in the world where we only gather twice and most the places I go to preach they have four Services a week I don't save you but it shows where their expectations are it shows where their desire is it shows where their things are shows it shows exactly where they are I I'm actually last weekend was supposed to be in the Philippines I was invited to preach an anniversary meetings they would have Wednesday Sunday Friday night prayer meeting a Friday night prayer meeting is just like standard equipment every church I've ever been in as a Friday night prayer meeting but that's party night Psalms 22 says I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord can you imagine us starting a Friday night prayer and saying Oh Glory Hallelujah I get to go to church if you're not there you either have no sacrifice or your sacrifice is so old there ain't even hot coals in it it it's just ashes here our Prophet says America has gone completely crazy people stay home pleasure crazy sorry I forget I forgot my main word America has gone completely pressure crazy people stay home on Wednesday night a prayer meeting to watch I love Loosely and jokes he talking about staying here here on Wednesday night he said if the Holy Spirit was had your heart full he said you'd have no more desire to stay home and watch I love Loosely instead of go to prayer meeting he said the love of the world takes away the love of God that's in the people he said why does people want to stay home and watch steping program get to go the prayer meeting he said it is what we want to do is because the joy in the house of the Lord is gone right but the joy in the house of the Lord comes from your life and my life don't don't expect brother Dale to bring the joy of the house of the Lord no no no no no no no that's not how it works you bring the joy in cuz you're 50% of the ministry so if this ministry fails you're sitting right beside beside me in the Judgment Day because you never prayed for me you never fasted for me and you never said amen Glory Hallelujah and run around the aisle and clap your hands that's right that's the joy of the Lord yes see the joy of the Lord ain't because you got a Hollywood Pastor some of the greatest Minister brother Bram was his wife read his scriptures he was such a poor reader you would never vote him in for your pastor no he can't even read that's right d Moody he spit and sputtered and but they had the joy of the Lord there wasn't because they were coming to see Dwight Moody wasn't because they were coming to see brother Brown brother Brown says why cuz people prayed and fasted back then God help us God help me he said a coldness and damp this cold dampness and we're going to we're going to other places of pleasure pleasure instead of coming to the house of God for pleasure how many of you think that it's pleasurable to come to church thank you thank you but here here the prophet saying and why this is a 61 message he said the coldness and D he said well let me start at the beginning but because that we do this and the reason we're cursed and the reason that God put this thing on the church is this coldness and dampness that we find pres pleasure other places instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure oh that preacher was so terrible oh I agree I asked brother Matt and brother Carson both to Preach Today I don't think it's scriptural for a pastor to preach on their birthday but I mean I got turned down so it must be all right but you see what I mean it wasn't that they came to get pleasure they brought pleasure with them they were fellowshipping in God on their own private life this ain't we're not Israel we're not Jews God don't save this church collectively it's an individual walk if you ain't happy this morning it's your fault it ain't my fault Glory God's exactly the same yesterday today and forever what are you eating you become what you eat that's right the Bible says go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature you know I mentioned before you know and and I I would you know I you know a known man or a dad or anybody you know you you get wisdom and if if your kids have any brains at all they'll they'll ask for some of that wisdom and if they they don't well you just sit back and watch them have a train wreck but I told a pastor not long ago I said you know God never called us to build churches in other countries we built some ouch I don't like that scripture God didn't call us to build CH schools cemeteries God never told us called us to build houses for other people you know what he called us to do he called us all to either get in an airplane and go preach the gospel and if you can you pay somebody else's way I'm going to tell you something that'll offend you brother G Garett told me last week he had somebody come and give him money for his whole trip to I said never once in my life if I had one person one person give me one penny to go anywhere to preach not one penny every penny that I went and got an airplane I paid personally out of myself I'm so broke it ain't even funny going into all the world preach the gospel I asked John Garrett I said the person that give you the the the money to go preach the gospel and he he's already got somebody that's going to donate he actually already got money to go to Nicaragua somebody had already give money to nicaragu said do they go to your church he said nope I said you need to change churches that's us say brother Dale God gives you the gift the people that feed you that's the people you go by fellowship with go into all the world and preach the gospel you know so God didn't call us to buy lands and houses for other people you know what breaks my heart when we go to these places people have nothing but because we've done some of the other things I can't make as many trips as I have and God gave me a little spank and I passed it on to some min and they said watch watch all watch all religion oh but you know God knew your heart and he knew that it was a really good thing no no no no we can't leave the word we can't leave the word you don't have to give one penny for a roof or a house or a church you show me one scripture where God said give somebody money for a roof or a house or a foundation or a church or a school now brother bam said that's okay and and and and that but if you do that and then you can't go on a missionary trip and so I had people ask me like right now in the Philippines I said you know what I told the I said I can't afford to come and then God said but you did this and you should have did this and because you did this you can't do that uhhuh I don't like spanking and I definitely don't like them from God cuz they they have a way of really stinging amen we got to be scripturally based man God help us amen Jesus came saying unto them in Matthew 28 another scripture the same way go into all the world and teach All Nations baptizing them amen God help us also another thing that we've lost so much of the time is Hebrews 12:14 he says follow peace with all men now the world's Dying For Love it's dying for peace and holiness and without no man shall see God we're going to I want to change by the church world is leaving the presence of God in a hand basket because they've left Holiness Holiness dress wear and character now there's some women and men do you see I I pick on the men you see some preachers that they got a tuxedo suit on and it cost $1,000 and they got a tongue of backbiting and gossip that's as long as touch the floor but Holiness is character and dress I wouldn't give you 5 cents for one of these Harlot that walk down the street and show everything everything God valued he hid everything got and the bride of Christ he's also hiding by the way if you come you H just happen to be going by Wednesday night I'm going to preach on why we're the wife of Christ this Wednesday you know that's something else God whipped me for I would try to prepare for Wednesday night and I said but God there's only going to be five people there God said don't matter I'll preach my best men SES on Wednesday night and what you get whatever's left over on Sunday cuz see God ain't a respector of the day he's not a respector of the day or the hour or that it's not fair to the other people and I definitely ain't preaching both twice ain't fair for for the ones that have already heard it Holiness the look of Holiness I tell you what it I and you know they don't have the word so they maybe don't have the character but I would live in places where brother M and Abigail live or menites where menites are those young ladies and they can do all kinds of work and they're dressed in a small flower little cotton dress with small flowers I'll just tell you what if I wasn't married I'd be chasing one of them they're fly dope beautiful you some some prostitute walking down the street she's cheap leather she'd been laying in the sun too long blistered I wouldn't give you 5 cents for it God help us if he don't come back in the Raptor he says if he didn't come if he didn't shorten the days there'll be none saved except for the leate watch this he he said watch how he says this he said except for the leate he would shorten the days amen the way he says it like if he didn't shorten the days would the elect even be safe but he promis he shorten the days because of the elect amen hey if you got something valuable you don't have to look for some kind of cheap imitation if God wanted the barn red he would have brought it red that's why I say and this is just a joke if God wanted me to live in this cool climate he would have given me fur that's why I love the hot climate I I have no problem living in the winter time January and February anywhere I'm not fussy where it is long as it ain't cold man God help us here the prophet says when you're singing hymns and what now now he's showing you how we're going to get these exceeding great and precious promises brother Dale never come up with this message by the way I'm far too for that you I hope you got a little bit of faith in God and a whole lot more and our prophet and our message here he says you know when you go around s singing hymns and you start reading your Bible the strangest thing happens The Stranger Jesus Christ shows up and he'll appear on the scene because you're thinking and meditating on him ain't that amazing like when the two disciples were walking on the road to emus and they were aack they were AQ and they didn't even see they didn't have the Revelation and they didn't understand the word of God but they were we're just thinking about them oh man I'm so I'm so disappointed in Jesus come on come on come on say it you can say it so I'm so disappointed Jesus he didn't build the kingdom here and I'm still a slave Jesus ain't even a respector person he don't even care how you talk about him he'll still show up hello hello is anybody there is that the truth they were they they were not going down the road to the m say oh praise God Jesus did everything I believed he would do they were saying oh Jesus you let us down you failed us and he still showed up and the he said the reason that we don't have the spiritual blessings and we have too much time to watch television too much time to read the newspaper to listen to something that we ought not to listen do we are not Redeeming the time but we're giving things to the world instead of to our lord Jesus maybe too much time to watch the news for those that knew the one God dwelt in the light he said and when he was on Earth He manifested In the Flesh he said I am the light of the world because God was manifested through him and he was the light the pillar of light that led the children of Israel and he's the light that struck down Paul on the road to Damascus and he's the light that came to the prison with Peter and he's the light that's on this picture and he's the light that's in my heart and he's the light that's in this church and he's the Everlasting Light and in him is no Darkness absolutely no darkness that means that we're living in Heavenly places because he is a light and we're following the light and we're living inside the light and he's living inside of us and so we're losing our mind cuz we're Stone drunk Hallelujah prise God the reason the people I'm just reading one line of these quotes here leading being led by the spirit of God he said the reason people can't see the Glorious things that God does today is they're looking they're looking they're not looking for them that's the reason it's only given to those that are looking for God to come back amen here and I I I we're doing well with their time unbelievable but here here I'm want to go into some things that that it that puts the onus back on each individual of us you get what you expect you get what you expect he said that's right he said you can never go above your never go above your expectations if you came to church this morning you say well I can't wait till we get home so I can watch my favorite Church where I'd rather live in ATT 10 church because it's online and they have a really good video camera you're getting what you expect it'll never change he says you'll always have to do it that way he said Simon was expecting Jesus he said when you're expecting something Simon was always expecting Jesus to come while he was alive this is the old timeon in the New Testament and he was expecting it and God rewarded him for his faith and he said you won't taste of death until Jesus you hold Jesus in your arms he said Daniel was expecting God to deliver him from the dying stand the Hebrew children was expecting God to deliver him from the fiery furnace but they didn't car either way the woman at the well that had the blood issue was expected to receive something when she reached out and touched Jesus and blind man barus was expecting that if he could get to Jesus he would be healed he said that's what he was expecting that Jesus would do he said you see you get exactly what you're expecting if you're disappointed in your friends or you're disappointed in your and you know we're the best pastor of the blame past the buck it was well I mean that came right from the beginning of Genesis it was the wife that gave them to me oh my goodness oh s's alive we still got that Spirit around help us Jesus we need to if you're not getting what you expect you need to say what's wrong with me God I need to die more brother Dale needs to get out of the way more brother Brown said his greatest gift was getting out of the way I don't plan sermons God give them to me if I don't God don't give them to me a church is closed next week CU I couldn't make something up amen God help us he said people get what they expect many times people come to a meeting they go to church and they say well I didn't see nothing happen I didn't expect to see anything happen in the first place that's the reason you didn't see nothing happen you didn't get help cuz you didn't expect to get help he said and if you come expecting to get help from God God will meet your expectation he always does that always always does that and whatever you go wherever you go whatever you do what you get is your expectation brings down not the pastor's face and not brother braham's Faith but your faith your expectation brings down your faith on the scene and God honors your faith but what brings it your expectation I can't wait to get to that meeting God help us give God help them their expectations if they're doing it reverently in the fear of God here James 4 2:4 and and 7 to8 he says excuse me you have not because you ask not and you ask and receive not because you ask a m many of us when we pray we say well we know we we're like the disciples you know when they prayed to get Peter out of jail and then Peter went and knocked on the door and they said well that's his ghost cuz we prayed but we know he ain't out of jail CU like we seen them in the socks yeah that spirit's still really healthy today well you know we prayed but we didn't expect it happen cuz we weren't at the big tent top or it was just a little brother that prayed for us huh I'd rather have a little I'd rather have one of the kids pray for me than any of you adults because they just blindly believe I don't care if it's a brother or a sister they just say oh God will touch you brother Dale we got all this fog in our head called age yeah God help us we have not because we ask not or we don't even believe if we did ask we'd receive it God's like well I'm not going to I'm not going to hurt your expectation I just won't bother giving it to you God help us verse 7 it says redist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh onto you so you see what's happening in the church the reason if if the church ain't living in Heavenly places now if it ain't if you're not living in Heavenly I'm not saying you aren't if you aren't living in Heavenly places if you become cold stale and you've lost your commitment and desire and thrill You've Lost Your thrill You've Lost Your Enthusiasm maybe it's because you ain't drawn near to God maybe you need to go see a marriage counselor you know there's marriage counselors that actually tell you that you can keep the r romance going in your life married life it makes no difference how white you are are I tell my wife on a regular basis I love you and you're like knock my socks off but we come to church we don't tell God that we're we don't come to church and say God we love you you knock my socks off draw near to God and He will draw near to you watch how that scripture ends says cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded you know what that double-minded means it's you got so much so many other thoughts on your mind you can't even think clearly about God and the Rapture and church and preaching to the world and and prayer and fasting and you know prayer and fasting is like going on a diet you don't see it like it I mean it might that'd be a miracle but what you do secretly God will reward you openly if you just quit eating eventually people will see that you've quit eating and you'll start getting skinny amen God bless you brother Noah amen [Music] [Applause] this world that we're living in is a attacking us and it's a listen listen I've talked to some of you brothers and and I'm open for advice this world we're living in is a an evil age it's attacking the home on every side what what God can use for good in the internet the Satan is just terrible evils the evils that are Beyond I'm way too young to see and how in the world were our kids there's nothing you can give the kids un including not nothing that you can give your kid if it's got an internet hooked up to it Satan's connected and I don't care if you're watching a holy ghost filled messages I've seen I've been watching messages or hymns from churches and when the video stopped the next thing that come up was like oh boys brother Dale don't have all the answers but God does it's what you eat is what you'll become and if you feed on what I'm not I'm not speaking against progress in Internet I I search the scripture I'd use the message Hub I live by the message Hub and and and stuff like this but I'm just saying be very careful like when you're playing with a tool of Satan get on it use it for your and get off of it I mean I'm not saying you can't whatever but Satan is Alive and he's real and it's affecting our world let me rephrase that it's affecting the message Believers and the churches yeah it is and if you don't think it's affecting you well you're just living in a bubble of unbelief because Satan knows his time is short he he can Satan can see better than any one of you that the door is closing and time is running out and he is going like a maniac like a stone maniac to get all that he can devour before the end time and he ain't going to the ones that he's already devouring uh-huh he's going to the ones God's priz possession the ones that are wearing a diamond on their finger you don't think he wants that diamond that precious uh-huh God help us God help us remember how I mentioned that already when we talked about that and I told you those two quotes about how God will use the five-fold ministry to minister his word and I'm going to I'm going to just read exactly what brother Brown says he says this is on uh Israel and the church paragraph 105 he said what people needs is their brains baptized besides their water he said that's right he said he said excuse me for there being such a sharp expression but he said I sure wish that would soak in sometimes people get so stuck in their thing you know I was watching you know and studying and I do a lot of different things and and somebody was showing a video and they were showing the word of God and it was a beautiful video and I respect the brother and he was showing it word based and message based and he was he was physically putting it up and letting brother brandom read it and showing you the quote showing you the Bible verse I mean there was just no doubt it was black and white was talking about how ministers had ridiculed him and called them names and and it's a long ways from here so don't even try to guess and he of course he never said that should never happen that that's of the devil that's that's of the devil we're not I brother Dale ain't I'm I'm not even in charge of anybody's salvation nobody's I just throw the net you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling I'm I'm throwing out the net how God deals with you and your conscience that's entirely up to you why do people we why do this age a great one of the greatest things I'm I'm I I'm going to shut up and close but one of the greatest things that will come against the church besides pornography and and all these things will be popularity popularity and everything that God chose us to do in the Bible none of it nobody knows you're doing it most ridiculous thing I've ever seen and and I'm not I mean if people do it it's fine but you know these some people will have prayer conventions online and I I just I'm just telling you what the Bible says the Bible says when you pray enter your closet be not like the Hypocrites Sadducees and Pharisees for they think because they got great message dialogue that God will hear their mouth oh Lord God of the Prophet please heal me me because of the opening of The Seven Seals and all the I believe all of that but you don't do that on the internet you flat out don't do that on the Internet it's flat out on scripture you can't find one scripture for it pray on the internet so everybody can hear me oh dear Jesus how far have we come how far have we come you seen what the prophet said about Jesus would he wear a suit and a tie these are just Traditions he said Jesus would not he was a common person he wore the the the the the clothing wear of the day right he wasn't a God help us God help us if you're looking for something great the great and and I listen we it's scriptural that you'll have all the spiritual gifts in the church and in our lives you got to have them in your lives before you going to have them in the church don't expect them in the church if none of them are in your life you don't expect me to speak in tongues if you don't speak in tongues don't expect to gift of healing on me if you don't have gift of healing don't expect uh you know Gifts of Prophecy from me if you don't have gifts of Prophecy yeah it's an individual Walk we're not Jews we're individuals but all those things are in the B and we like not man alive we've had tongues in our church here was the weekend that the sister brought the picture of the the Jesus over the thing from Toronto from D Samuels church when the power of God comes down there's nobody in this church would love it anymore if you all got blessed and we're losing your mind drunk in the spirit legitimately and God bless I I'll gladly shut up and just sit under the anointing of the power of God but we're looking for it the wrong way we're looking for it like we think we can buy it like the brother that went to the disciples in the Bible and says I see that gift in you I I'll pay you money for it no you can't buy it it's by a sacrificial slain lamb Jesus was a slain lamb butchered Jesus was butchered for brother Dale butchered Butcher and if you're him then you'll be butchered for the world because the Bible says that if you're going to have fruit he's going to cut you and when Jesus was butchered they said when they came to Jesus said I would see the father he said I've been with you all this time but he said unless I'm butchered watch how I'm putting this my unless I die I will dwell alone and so the reason that if if if we're not in if you're not in Heavenly places or if the churches isn't in Heavenly places if it isn't if you don't think we're in Heavenly places have you been butchered yet have you become a sacrifice where God gets a snippers out and he just starts cutting off all this Jazz you know brother Bram said and let your light so shine he said you got too much smut in your life and I can't even see Jesus in your life because you're all cluttered up and the basic exceeding great and precious promise promises are received by prayer Clause of Life pushing the plate away or telling your wife she don't need to cook tonight and going where it's really quiet and there's no noise no noise no noise at all and just letting God talk to you saying God I can I'm I'm done I'm really done I'm really done God I can't go one more step till you bring some light on to seat and help save me God help us there's a way we can get those promises but it's not on the internet uh this tell you what you're not going to you can watch the you could watch God preach on the internet and you won't get those promises in your church or in your life unless you have a secret closet unless you have a private life it's good high time that we bring back devotions in the home and it's good time I try I try to almost always but I try the first thing I do when I turn on my phone is listen to my Bible I'm a poor reader so I listen to chapters I listen to books I sleep with the New Testament on I've listened to the New Testament since we come back to a Salvador three or four times I'll go to upstairs 6:30 put the New Testament on listen to it I fall awake I wake up I'll shut it off in the morning just playing the word of God or the prophet now I I I don't need to tell you that I'm not looking for like a bozel button but I'm saying it's it's high time we all did something like that what we do in secret don't we need to shut off the complainers and turn on the doers and say you know I've been in my closet you don't tell me you've been in your closet I I told you I was but you see what I mean your CL it can be anywhere it can be just when you wake up and then we have to understand that God's Sovereign and we can't boss him around you know when the disciples said I'm I'm closing with this I'm sorry but he said when the Lord teach us to pray look at the Lord's Prayer you know many many times not always but many times we say the Lord's Prayer at the end of Wednesday prayer service but it's not like Lord pay my bills Lord kill my pastor move me to the Big Church Lord give me the seven spiritual gifts in my life I want to prophesy and speaking no it's Our Father which art in Heaven hallow it oh we get into worship be thy name th it's all about thy kingdom and thy power it's him it's God God God God God it's not me me me I or nothing any one of these brothers that could Minister handle the word are welcome to brother Carson brother Matt amen don't don't forget that God will take me on a trip someday this church ain't about I I have these conversations with my wife I say honey if I die who will keep the church going who will shovel the sidewalks who will vacuum the rug who will pay the bills when there ain't no enough money in the church count to pay the bills who will do it who will preach who'll pay the heat bill God will if we die if we have a fresh sacrifice I'm just saying it's your responsibility it's your responsibility to add virtue to your faith and it's your responsibility the Bible says you go back in second Peter it's it's really good when you had those great and exceeding precious promises it's what you must do to have the nature of Christ that's right in the Bible to get his nature that's what you must do and to get them come by a secret relationship you know oh this is unbelievable I'm going to shut up but the seventh seal is that secret relationship am it's not a public show and it's when you go into the when Isaac took Rebecca in the tent that's the seventh seal right there so when you send all your friends home and say it's time for me to have some alone time with God that's the seventh seal brother Brown you watch him come right up to and he said oh oh oh I've said too much so I feel checked that seventh seal is intimacy it's you and God in in your mother's tent let's see God help me God help me in this stage we're living I I want you to understand brother Dale is not any different than any one of you I I'm fighting all this this this stuff I've talked to brother Matt and and uh you know the the world is is there it's out there and it's it's very alive and attractive it's because people are spending so much time in the pleasure but you can have the same pleasure you know I remember and and I I it's amazing I I promise I'll close but the anointing is powerful you know we said we have everything in our day and before the message came I can remember as a young boy I'm not I'm not the oldest but I'm getting there I can remember before we were in the message we went to church twice on Sunday Wednesday night and we would have 10 or 12 Day Revival services and we got more now we could never pull that off why no sacrifice no fresh sacrifice it's why you you're not excited about anything about it's not about this you don't like coming here go to a different Church don't matter there's lots of examples but there's no sacrifice no fresh sacrifice we got everything but the sacrifice we got everything and because of no sacrifice place we don't have nothing you know some people that are living in the message churches and I don't mean this church this is online but there's people living in message churches don't have as much of God as what I left in commod of denomination they don't because of no sacrifice No sacrifice you get what you put into it you don't put no money in your bank account there won't be no money to draw out you don't put no prayer into God's bank account there won't be no healing to draw out you don't you you just try living in your house and don't pay the rent or the the mortgage and just see how long you stay there God help me God help me not to get so caught up oh man this world's going to burn and it's going to burn really soon it's going to burn really really really really soon be careful just be careful you don't have to answer to me just be careful God help me Jesus God help the people to forgive me for where did this come from God it's just oh Jesus help me help me Jesus help us to recognize It's always darkest before the dawn the most people will lose their way rap

Lord as neighbors and the outside family comes may they recognize that we don't have to say a word we don't have to say that God sent a prophet or there's a message in this last age let them recognize The Presence of Jehovah the atmosphere the cloud that's the Sweet Holy Spirit may they walk like they're walking into a fog and they go oh my oh my oh God may it be so meet every need that's
