bottom of our hearts and it's just awesome to be together just look forward to our special meetings next weekend um uh so Friday night seven Saturday at six and Sunday regular and just look forward to a very wonderful time amen I know uh I know brother Jose's church will be here I know he's got a room for the weekend so that means nobody's preaching in Kitchener as far as I know anyway and your family so I know I have that confirmation for sure I believe Joe bear said he would be here too uh just uh different ones remember Jim and Linda and Chatham man just they love us brother Jim will be here next weekend any man he has somebody to watch Linda men and and just be with them we got to get down there my goodness we were just just that God would be with them amen and bless them and also remember John Blackman we went and seen him we hadn't seen them for a few weeks and and we just could not believe we were just we were just couldn't believe how he failed just couldn't believe it we were very naive I guess sir something like we we don't like staying at the home because you got to wear a mask in the home and so we always pick them up and they brought them out in the wheelchair sometimes to do that just for convenience but so we just properly threw him in the car and took him to the restaurant we can't walk so me and the wind carried them in the restaurant and it was just very very sad I'm very sad of course he was just humiliated and embarrassed but you know if we don't go in a Rapture we're all going that way man you know it was amazing me and Lynn would have our arms under his arms you know to to basically carry him and he just couldn't make his feet move and then like once every five minutes he could take two big steps it was just but then he couldn't they just went to work I couldn't imagine you know he's got his own room in his apartment it's kind of a kind of a you know it's kind of a lift separate live up you know old age home you know I couldn't imagine being in your own room but you can't go to the bathroom you mean you're 10 feet from the toilet but you can't get to the toilet it's just it's just very sad and so just remember them and of course he he has nobody that goes sees him almost at all except us that Chris had been there one time since he'd been the homeless son so it's it's sad amen how you treat your kids they'll pick your old age home and they'll they'll be the ones as many times as you take them on a holiday that's how many times they'll come and visit you Jared in the home big same amount you know amen it's very different amen it's just but anyway let's just remember brother John and you know he he would be here if he could walk you know and but uh that was just uh also you know we fellowship and some with Kathy and Steve and trying to show them love and and support and and that the other couple amen just God bless you brother Evanson all year and just just good to be in the house of God amen uh let's just turn to scripture just pray for me I I'm sure I got way more than uh I could ever use but uh let's go to First Corinthians First Corinthians 15 51-54. and yeah I'm very much looking forward to the our weekend amen and Alex oh actually I also want to thank the ones that helped clean the church yesterday sister Patricia and Vanessa different ones other ones we're doing other things that they they were helping indirectly people did other things people covered for me so I could come but uh when they put the holes in the ceiling there was a can only imagine what the church looked like and it was probably worse than that it was uh it was drywall everywhere amen but we by God's grace strike to make it a little brighter in here hey man so uh I wanna or God wants to take just a little different way I believe and you know a minister you know I have no idea how it you know it's just amazing when you surrendered God you know I don't know what the service would be like I put down 10 scriptures I don't know which ones man but God sure knows amen I want to preach on positivity positive man behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed Hallelujah in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise incorruptable and we shall be changed Hallelujah greatest promise of all for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on in mortality so then this incorrupt disruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on in mortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that it is written death death is swollen up and victory Hallelujah now that's just one more scripture before you have your seats Philippians 4 and 8. Philippians 4 and 8. finally my brother and whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest and whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure and whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue in them and if there be any praise in them think on these things Lord Jesus we ask you to bless the word bless your bride together in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats I want to read a quote here that the prophet said right off the beginning and you know this is uh you know you you've heard so much of the the word of God Amen and just wonderful a wonderful wonderful stuff you know but I want to I want to show a different or God wants to show a different maybe uh thought that we haven't heard in a long time and and here here's a quote from the spiritual signs of the times it's a 64 quote neither will we ever make a believer as long as you're afraid to exercise The Authority that's been given to us by Jesus Christ we have the victory amen we don't have to have anything we don't have to have to fight for the victory we already have the victory he conquered us not he conquered for us not us but he conquered for us and we're not the mighty conqueror but he God is a mighty conqueror and you know we've heard it and you know in our flesh we want to the denomination of the world want to be saved by works and we think the more we do for God we're going to be saved and I know I know if you balance that the scripture says well faith without works is dead but I want to show you this morning that the only thing that God wants from you the only thing he don't need your Works he wants your adoring he wants your love he wants your admiration he wants you to call out to him and worship that's what he wants he wants you to in the natural just saying in the natural relationship he wants to Puff him up it's worship amen you know I look in the scripture and we will turn to hear and II Chronicles here here was Jehoshaphat and they were going to war and hear the mobates that the Emirates and the Moa Emmons were coming against them and he was in Jerusalem and Jericho and and he cried out to God they realize that their armies were three times what their army was and Jehoshaphat went to God and said God he said don't you aren't we yours and aren't you going to save us and I want to show you maybe we can turn to that scripture and just lay a real good second chronicles 20 Amy excuse me 15 and 17 and I love this he said here's God talking he said hearken Ye Old Judah and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid be not dismayed by the reason of the great multitude just preacher that in this world of the world's gone crazy covet and and War and rumors of wars and and you know everything is your your motive to look at it how how do you perceive you know I can look at all the rumors of the war and say praise God my Redemption draweth night other people say oh I'm afraid I'm going to get blown up no we have the greatest hope of all amen it was all that it was you know the stories of multiple stories I I'll just stop in here and think you know like the boys that were were asking for a pony at Christmas and their daddy never put nothing for under the house for him except the pile of pony waste and the one boy came and he said oh no he said we got stuff to clean out of the shed and the other boy said whether it's Pony waste there's got to be a a pony hey man you're going to look at the wars and just say well we're going to get blown up and the other one can say is we're going to be in a Rapture before we're blowing up amen it's all in your perception of positive and this is not this ain't no new age teaching this ain't no garbage of thing the our Prophet talked about that and you know we in a new age World there everything oh positive and no we're not talking about that we're talking about being positive on the word of God all the all things work together for good to them that love God that means if your your child dies it's still God's good if your parent dies I was for God's good that's not looking at the time frame if the the bombs if Russia bombs that's good do I understand that no I don't understand that if Kim Jones bombs North Korea south or vice versa that's good how's that good because we're going to go home it's are they say in our homes we forget we're on a holiday we're in a holiday and we're in Canada or Uganda or wherever we're at this is just a holiday but our real home was where we always were before the foundation of the world and so when you perceive and so where where God's thoughts was we're at the Rapture time we are in the Rapture actually we're not just in the time of the Rapture raptures in process right now amen it's in process it's beautiful but for the Rapture to be in process there's going to be people that are going to be destroyed and the worth of the world is going to be blown to blythereens and this is not going to be our hold and your big fancy house farmer whoever pick up it's gonna be burnt amen it's 30. it's 30 if it's clean it's still dirty it's sin dirty you look at all these terrible things so you say well praise God I live in the Rapture Day and then you open the news go but you got to get to a state where it's still positive and I have no money I'm still happy if I have no Farms I'm still happy I'm going in a Rapture my goal is Rapture Rapture Rapture if Kim this world you just watch everything's about to blow up every day Russia I just and I'm not dwelling on this our Prophet talked about the slots mad do you know the prophet talked about bombs in the hangar s hundreds of times well they're not just in the hangar now they're in the planes that are flying over our Prophet could talk about it in the 60s and 50s we surely can talk about it 2023. you know Russia has proved that it was England Britain that that um their gas line in Russia is actually threatening what they they promised them to repay them for their things Kim Jones sought 38 missiles in the 20 days some of them raid over top of Japan's Island he's gone Google and North Korea was doing alliance with with the states and and with that and you can go oh or you can look at that go oh thank you Lord thank you Lord it's just going to be three or four more days five or six more days amen positive oh then how you look at it you know the stories told about the the farmer that you know that Brother David deanheart mentioned this 25 years ago and it shot him and preached a message on the farmer that had a a well and the donkey fell in the well and he had no way to get the donkey out of the well he tried to pull the donkey pull his head off you pull his neck he couldn't throw a rope around the donkey drag him out he'd he'd be hung before he got him out he didn't know how to get the donkey out of the well he said well I guess all I can do is just bury the Donkey and so he started throwing on the donkeys and the donkey all the people that were throwing darts at him the dog he said yes master here this master I've done everything my whole life to God and he said throwing mud on me that's what Satan's taught some of us before oh I've done all this for God and I've got the hard troubles and the donkey just realized that if he just shook his shook his back shook it off he kept stepping up and in a few years he just walked right out in a rat trap but of his attitude would oh and my master turned against me and he buried me alive it was all your perception of positivity you know not that we not that we look to secular people but Albert Einstein is quoted this he said stay away from negative people they always have a problem for every solution they always have a problem for every solution amen but as our Prophet said birds with feathers flock together I don't want to be known as the negativity of it I don't want to our Prophet said I don't want to grow up to be the old grouch amen in everything that could be at everything it can be like a flower garden beautiful old age can be beautiful age it's all beautiful but it's Rapture time dropped your time look at the world and say oh man everything you say oh praise God I think you come today you know our Prophet spoke exactly like that in the 60s he would he would be planning meetings next week and he said well Lord willing we'll be here but if the Lord don't come that was a long time ago that was a long time ago and this is where we offend God he's all the promises in the book are for us and we're believers and you know the prophet said this he said the word of God is inside the bride and they have they know what Christ wants them to do with it that's what he said so if God says that these things are going to happen and you get sad about it God's like I told them what I was going to do and they're upset with me I told him I was going to send words and rumors of War before before I came and get them the other thing and all the bride's upset I told him that the world economic Forum was gonna or your your money was you couldn't take it with you and the Believers are upset and I told them to lay up Treasures where moth and rust not corrupt but and thieves don't break through and steal and people are building big kingdoms and and and they're upset and they're upset and God says but I'm confused huh think of this you know just let's read that quote again neither will we ever make a Believer you'll never be a believer as long as you're afraid of exercising the authority that Jesus Christ has given you wow our Prophet said it like this for your salvation for your family or for healing or this he said picture it like this that I invite you over for supper and the table spread with all kinds of nice good food and you would like some steak at the other end you just said brother Dale could I please have some steak it's already there it's all it's already there you can see it you just have to ask for it you said he said that's all this he said Lord Jesus could I please have the healing of this thank you Lord I'll I'll fill my plate really full with that good I had the salvation of my family they're your heritage thank you Lord I'll put an extra scoop onto that plate no problem no fear totally positive don't matter how they're living don't matter how many bombs they're scaring up no matter who's going to who and where is going what in the world politics no matter who's the leader of Canada the next leader probably won't be no better you know see because we're a Triune being so so will you watch this when when I say I tell my kids this I said now listen don't go on that because you know the Bible don't lie the borrower is a slave to the lender so when Things Fall Apart you will become a slave if you're a borrower but on the other side when you look at it spiritually anything in this world don't matter see you you like we're in God's head see the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord amen you just like it's time that we took God at his word amen that's Psalms 37 23 such as steps footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord we need to be as Christians we should most positive people in the world when we go to the grocery store your your ears should be in the way because you're smiling so big everybody's in there like I'm buying water for next month and flour for I don't think I can eat my house I'm not worried if I can heat my house I probably won't be in my house if I can't heat my house amen don't don't build your hopes on this world man we're going home this is Rapture time not all are going to sleep that's Jesus saying we're not all going to go to sleep and if we do we're going to rise first amen the prophet talked about the the positive New Age thinking he said that was always I word oh and I think but I'm talking about being positive to God's promises just saying okay I want to stink you and show you Jehoshaphat you know some people and and I understand but back to this faith without works is dead I want to show you that in this Army of Jehoshaphat maybe I better finish reading it thus saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed for the reason of the great multitude or for the Bible it ain't yours you were worrying about really for what it's not yours but God's now now this is God himself talking here let's go to uh let's go to 17. we're going to skip a verse God's just telling them in the next verse where the enemy's coming down for ye need not need okay no no I mentioned about faith without works is that look at this scripture and say how much did God need them mm-hmm for ye shall not need to fight in this battle that's how much God needed them now remember before that josephite called out God said God we need you to take care of us that's all God wanted you don't need to do no swinging God will do the swinging amen and if you read further down in this scripture he says I through the battle in fact I got that verse verse 30 after we'll go down to that said God gave Jehoshaphat and the children of Israel perfect rest the Holy Ghost and a rapture if everything falls down around you you're going there before the foundation of the world it like I didn't he didn't trust nobody else for this Covenant he come down himself oh hallelujah amen amen for there's no need for you to fight in this battle set yourself and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not I I really believe this verse is good for today be good for today you know I was in the news this week and I was showing all the armies there's literally about six countries in the army that would like to go to war with one another and I say please do and hurry you know and you can watch people you say oh that's sometimes my kids will come in and they'll see me on something they said I don't want to hear no more of this craziness but if you look at a depositive way this world has to get crazy before we go home our Prophet said that the world would go to incomplete complete Insanity I say it's arrived but we're not gone home yet so it's still got to get a little bit more insane if you want to see how insane it is leave your kids at home for goodness sake if you if you listen to anything a pastor says to you don't send your kids to public school system and you go yourself and investigate you know we had some parents telling us like you know like well we we had different beliefs out well you know well I don't have no choices so I'll send my kids to the public school system got to take care of them listen that's a lie and if you don't like it it's still a lie you know our Prophet said that there's places that God won't go with you if you can send your kids to public school then I could go to strip joint literally because I watch this thing this week where a boy born a boy was feeling like a girl and the girls in the basketball team were all in with no clothes on showering and the boy was investigating but he wasn't a boy but he was born a boy but he thought he was a girl and the girls felt really uncomfortable about that and there's a message Believers has told me and my wife well like what am I supposed to do I send my kids no God will protect you if you might go to the grocery store and there's I'm sorry and there's something bad going on there but God don't protect you when you don't have to go to a place listen listen to me brothers and sisters there was not always Public School Systems it's a parent's responsibility to teach their kids when Jesus was here on Earth Jesus was here on Earth did they have Public School Systems Public School Systems come out when the government and the Catholic Church said give me your kids till they're seven and I'll have them their whole life you can say oh bless God I'm a minister of the Gospel I have the token or me I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I'm going to go to the bar and preach I don't think so I don't think so because guess what my Holy Ghost will stop right outside the door that's where that's where he will kids he won't go in there because he's not invited he wasn't invited in the denominational churches how in the world do you think he's invited in uh-huh this is the only age where God was on the outside of the churches knock you please let me back in and you think you're going to go to a public place God's going to be there never never because see he'll protect you where you have to okay but not where you don't have to that's the same thing with that people would say well God give me this wonderful job and I can never make Church you're insulting my God because the same God said don't never forsake the summoning of yourself together like unlike some matter like some have but to gather all the more as you see the day approach them but God give me a job that I can never Assemble no no no my God's a lot smarter than amen amen see God gets blamed first things you know me I don't know where that came from but that's free but see here what how God was fighting their battle you know people I've seen people I've had people tell me Well you mean to tell me there ain't nothing you got to do let me I love our Prophet this is what our Prophet said you need to do our Prophet said there was he said I see hundreds of times he said this nothing left nothing left to do but the rapture and the only thing you had to do was surrender or ripen that's it he preached the sermon he mentioned it multiple times I can hear the sound of the combine coming can hear the combine I just got done harvesting all my crop this is this week [Music] Prophet could hear the sound of the combine and what he could hear the sound of the combine the bride was right for the Harvest was right for the Harvest we're right for the Harvest don't don't look for God to send another Prophet to send another message another more of God to send more power are you kidding us our Prophet said God's done everything he give himself he's give us and this he said all the prophets and apostles and all the other ages want to live right here because all the Mysteries are received you know what water baptism is you know what difference he did you know what the godhead is they're all revealed there's no Mysteries you went to marriage of the lamest you know who's the wife that's going to be made ready it's a made herself ready to go in the rapture all in this age we should be the most positive people a most positive we should be beside ourselves happy in a world that's in dismay amen positive I started to say I've seen people that they feel like the Raptors close by they said well I we should be doing something we should but those people never come to prayer meetings by the way if you want to do anything you could pray more that's the only thing we couldn't do too much of but these people want to build more schools or build more churches or go on more Mission field trips or preach more sermons the prophet said you could do they may all be good he said I'm not talking against them but the only thing you couldn't do was pray too much because prayer humbles your soul if prayer makes you right for Harvest prayer right for the combine he said this is how much you need to do because oh like oh the Rapture is coming next week I better get my loved ones saved really so you're the one saving them God already huh what's how he says he says oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor to be dismayed for tomorrow go out against them and the Lord will be with you and amen he he did your fighting they he said in the beginning he said you will not need to fight set yourself out and stand still and see the salvation of God what you need to do this day it's just that just that just then and you'll get when you're standing you'll get ripened by the ass so when the Son of God will ripen you and humble you and the combine of come and harvest you and all the shaft and all the green stuff blown out the bat but you'll go in the gardener Matt amen see a Christian you know the Bible says God's not given us a spirit of fear but a Christian can't be negative that God's not giving a spirit of fear about love power and a sound mind you should be in this end time age I'm preaching this because it's going to get worse it's uh-huh our the Bible says that and the prophet said that the prophet said that the world would go into complete Insanity and the Bible says that the son of man would come back but it's not yet because you've got to hear Room wars and rumors of wars and a great falling away and he mentions all the things that will happen first amen you may lose your value you may lose your money they may change the money they may but none of these things matter God the bottom line is you're going to go in a rapture amen oh Hallelujah hey man let's just go up to verse 30 there Amy in the same chapter so the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet for his God gave him rest around above the battle amen God gives you rest you don't need to do anything for God except love him adore him amen look at like this look at it like this I don't love my wife because she cooks because God made restaurants I don't love my wife because she sews you see to me this compare your like a husband compared to spiritually I don't love my wife because she's beautiful she's all of those things but that's not why I love her now just picture that to God don't love you because you make more money and pay more ties and offers God don't love you because you're dressed nice this morning he does want you modest okay but God don't love you more because you preach you know I I mean sure it says a Elder will get double on her but God don't love you more because you preached 365 days you're a part of the Bride you're part of the Bride in my head let's go get mistaken God's got everything under control and you just need to trust him we just need to trust him be positive and all those all the Bible scriptures are for us amen oh it's beautiful Hallelujah let's look at Romans 8. 28. 28-31 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to whom he called according to his purpose now I just want you to watch this though who did the work God God it wasn't you the aisle I decided that brother Ben came and he's an awesome Minister brother Ben came and he preached an awesome message and I decided I'm going to love God and I'm going to come up the Altar and give my heart to God no you didn't decide nothing amen God before the foundation of the world God did it according to his purpose for now watch this now this is here God this is here God and how God did the work so yes actually as a Believer you can sit on your hands you don't need to get all excited because the Rapture is going to happen maybe next month or this year or next year or whatever it is I'm not saying winning but I can tell you this is going to happen soon amen for whom he did for no what did you have to do with that nothing he also did predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son what did you have to do with that nothing that he might be the firstborn of many Brethren what did you have to do with that nothing everything had to do with God Jehovah God everything all you have to do is surrender praise and surrender to him believe him love them amen moreover whom he did predestinate who did that God then he also called who you had anything to do with that no no God and them whom he called them he also Justified God again and whom he justified he also glorified did you have anything to do with that glorify now what did the prophet say it's completely finished what did we say about that quote you'll never become a believer as long as you're afraid to exercise The Authority that has been given to you by Jesus Christ amen he's the mighty conqueror you don't in this quote he said you don't have to fight for victory you we already have them amen in my head you don't need to think amen you don't need to think God bless you brother fresh you don't need to think wow man I must be doing something I'm afraid for my children you're not supposed to be afraid I'm afraid for myself you know you better get praying I'm afraid for my bank account well if you love the world the things of the world the love of God ain't even in you so you better pray some more too amen there's no reason to be negative in this this is a win-win-win-win-win situation amen what shall we say then to these things verse 31. if God before us then let's be negative really well that's a different version you know the next time a negative word comes out of my mouth just checked my sister passed amen sometimes they do because see you know what our Prophet taught us this year and you had the same this year's because I can see you moving and nodding tonight this here is the negative this ain't you this ain't you this is the negative of the positive that was your theophany your glorified flesh amen and so sometimes it's negative does negative things but we got to bring it in submission no and the more mature we get in Christ and the more we you get mature in the word of God and the more we ripen for the combine you know you know I know most you probably know this but the combine the first thing that hits a combine after it's cut off is a beaten machine they call it what do they call that the beater house and on my combine I can speak I can make the distance of the beater house and that beater house is round and it has about five bars on it about two three inches five bars it's round and I can speed up the Gap that goes underneath the stuff goes underneath or I can squeeze it if I want to pressure it and I can speed up my feeder house anywhere from 3000 RPMs to about 10 000 RPMs so like believe me you can't see it turning it's like when I shut the combine off and it's empty five minutes later it's still turning and that's the first thing in the natural that hits you when you get convited you think oh bless God I became a Christian it's going to be a walk in the park oh boys old boys you're going to get poverated pounded because the prophet said all of Satan's guns appointed on the message believer the bride of Christ because you have the revelation of the truth amen and anything that's green and wet is squashed like mush and goes out the back and anything that's dry and fluffy the fan blows out huh and so it's either a dust storm behind the combine and sometimes it's a bit of each this year because of the funny year we had and the dry season the beans were dry but the stocks were green so behind the combine it looked like insulates coming up which all that means is it was Green so there was like Hey coming out of the combine and yet the beans stocked the pots were dry so there was also dust coming out but the value went into the Garners of Egypt the value all the value was that was dry it is it had humbled itself in the Sun s-o-n and it had dried out it had shut up and dried out what let me you know the prophet always take type of typology and the natural always takes the spiritual you know when you're talking about a combine in the grain what's the grain have to do with getting dry nothing absolutely nothing all that grain does let's just stand there spiritually all you have to do at this age when it's going to get worse it's about it's going to get worse your job will be all messed up and we went through all of those type of things with covid and but it's it's it's not over because we're still here they're going to have to imagine something I don't know what it'll be uh-huh changing our money making a digital there'll be something happening that's going to beat up the bride but you got to keep your position on Shake It Off and step up like the Donkey you don't have to be buried alive you just Shake It Off and step up that's what a mature Christian does when Satan throws something at him you shake it off and you step up on the word of God when a make believer throw something at you you just Shake It Off recognize the spirit and step up on the word of God amen don't try to change them it takes God to change people if you try to change them you fight the prophet talked about if when when so-called Believers fight he said the devil looks back and and laughs and calls you all make Believers because Believers don't fight man positivity in God's word so here here we're coming here and I'm going to close with this here we're coming with the greatest expectation for the bride the rapture the most magnificent thing in the world but in the world and realm that we're living in it's going to be them it's going to be hell on Earth and you have to decide if you're going to be able to shake it off and step up on God's word Shake It Off say I'm going in a rapture it don't really matter what happens in the next 10 years amen it is going to happen I know we've heard it our whole life you know our Prophet never expected to die never ever expected that he would die he figured the Rapture would take place but brother Dale wasn't born yet so it couldn't happen and many abuse okay but God's bringing this message we're gonna we're gonna go through some hard times and how are you going to take it because all you're taken with you your character it's how you deal bad situation how do you deal with a bad situation how are you going to deal with it if God takes one of our little ones with us how are you going to deal with it if God takes me you're going to deal with it if he takes you for your husband character you know how Satan tempted the prophet when God took his first wife and he almost he got him right up the prophet was just right you know he said you know you've done all this for God and now he's through you and he's going to bury you alive and he was he said you know I was everybody listen to that 'd be good he said you know I was just and he said I was just ready to think well you know and it's like oh God you've done everything everything wow hey man let me just read a couple scriptures and quote here you know Matthew Matthew and Luke both talked about it's not what to Follows the man that goes in his mouth but what's the fastest man it's what comes out of this mouth negativity see a Believer if you're negative let me break this down and I'm going to recall we are going to clip if you're negative you're not negative to your situation you're complaining to God that's what it is because God is his word and he said that it's all for your good so when you don't like what he did you say God you're you made a mistake God but what do you want you're saying of course he didn't but that's how God perceives your complaining I'm not happy with you God you took something from what God Said in his word it was for your good huh what's this quote here here's a positive believer in Christ he said he was talking about people and I I've preached on this people believe in they had faith when they only had hope man there's a huge difference in Hope and Faith Faith has a substance to us everybody has hope everybody hopes to get to heaven but they don't have faith they're getting there amen faith is you can know it's a substance he said Faith does the job right now hope just hopes for it but faith is a product Faith really does it see we have lots of Hope but not much faith watches so we want to change from hope today to watch to positive faith why did the prophet say positive you know he said positive about 25 times 25 different messages he said there's only one way that you can get positive faith positive faith and that's by positive thinking on positive things that's a position of a believer in Christ there's only one way you can get positive faith and that's by positive thinking on positive things that definitely won't be politics it'll be the rapture that's the only positive thing there is The only positive thing there is is salvation and a Rapture to get out of this past house amen if your body ain't started to Creak yet just wait a few years you won't be so in love with your body I was rubbing my elbow last week and I was like oh those are because I'm there you go positive positive part is I'm going to get out of this body amen here's another quote using God's using his gifts he said don't think the kind of negative thought don't let that go through your mind every word positive every thought positive and where's the positivity today God's word and his promises amen he's going to take care of you amen it's not in this world it's positive inflation's up and the taxes are going up and you're going to make less money no it's in God's word forget about this world we're going to leave it behind we've got to remember we're on a holiday sometimes it rains on your holiday that might be what it's due in the last part of our life but I'm looking about I'm going back home amen Hallelujah the eagle stare at her nest by faith Look Away Yonder do and see the the what God's done for you and every word will be a positive Act everywhere it'll be a positive Act Hallelujah to be to be negative to be negative and to be a believer is to say God I think you're making a mistake amen God didn't make no mistakes he didn't make any and he ain't making any and he won't make it man God's concerned about your Eternal destination amen that's his main concern amen I I just love that about Jehoshaphat I'm glad that God don't love me because I work hard for him amen if you loved your wife like that I I think that would be close to slavery you know wow you just thank God see God loved us when we were unlovable man he loved us when we didn't recognize our love for him yet amen positivity amen God's got everything under control but that don't mean that this world ain't falling apart God promised that it would he promised that it would so God you pray for me because I'm in this exact same bottle I I don't like it I don't like it that I'm paying 230 something a liter for diesel in my pickup I don't like that at all it's ridiculous 50 cents more in gas and it's easier to make but you should just buy and say oh praise God I'm going home soon I won't need diesel on those streets of gold I'll just have a thought and I'll be with you brother Fred man see it's all in how you look at it all in how you look at there were so many different stories you know let me just uh look in my oh they're actually I'll close with this last story that just came to I knew I hit my iPad there was a shoe company true story as far as I know true story as far as I know true company that had been in business in America and they were doing very well and they wanted to expand and you know increase their business and and do all these things so they sent two shoe salespents to another country they sent one to the north one to the South you just picture this spiritually spiritually and your perception of where God's placed you in Wyoming or this area you're worshiping in Wyoming and the pressures of the flesh the world this is the negative this ain't really this will make mistakes if you look at this you're going to see lots of mistakes in brother Dale but brother Dale's got a predestinated seed that don't make no mistakes hasn't made any yet and both salesmen went to the thing and the one salesman went and he sent back a telegram immediately to the bot and he said boss he said cancel all the orders for shoes he said nobody here wears shoes and the other salesman had no idea what the other salesman had done because they were on the opposite side of the country and about a couple hours later the opposite yellow salesman went in to send back his telegram that must have been before Wi-Fi and all these wonderful gadgets that we have and he said boss increase the production like crazy he said nobody here has shoes on and he said the sales and Expedition and possibilities are Unlimited Unlimited one was close the factory and one was Unlimited that's the same decision you have to make this morning amen with Christ and the Rapture at hand the possibilities are unlimited let's stand let's stand amen hallelujah Hallelujah God help me wow thank you Lord Jesus you know God didn't save anybody to lose anybody he glorified you you're in God's eyes you are already a glorified being here in Romans 8. that's beautiful and he didn't have me labor to get there that's beautiful amen you don't you don't think you're uh you're not dressed Holiness because you labored hard to get it God give you that that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost God give it that now of course we raise up our children that way so they won't depart from it but that's that's the token that's Christ everything is Christ and all we got to do the only thing you got to labor to is to say yes I'll take it I'll take it I'll take I'll take some more of that I'll take the snake at the other end of the table I'll take my potatoes I want some mashed potatoes too because I I need some healing and salvation he said if you're questioning God you're not even a believer yet in the quote we read he said you got to start and it's not that God might do it or could do it you know I read a quote just you know just in studying they read hundreds of quotes he said the greatest problem in the church the prophet said was fear people don't believe God he really won't it's not that he won't he already did God can't take it back he already did it's not like he won't he already did and if you don't get it it's because you don't believe he did it that's amazing oh it's beautiful hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus let's sing that song oh come let us adore him oh come let us cry [Music] [Laughter] [Music] his way foreign [Music] [Music] please [Music] come let us [Music] foreign [Music]
