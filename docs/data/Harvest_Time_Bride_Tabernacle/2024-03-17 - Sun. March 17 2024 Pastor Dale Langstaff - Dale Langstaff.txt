just a few minutes thank you musicians and oh what a tremendous atmosphere Amen to worship him and just really awesome Amen we welcome you here amen all of you love you dearly and you know everything is about him everything it's not about individual us we love each other but it's about Christ amen Christ Jesus he's the one that's worthy of all of our praise amen amen amen it's fine with me if that door I'm going to die up here Vicki the heat it's a little hotter in here today because our thermostat was behind the plastic and it was freezing behind there when we came and so it was roasting the rest of the church but Jared just mentioned a few updates they're coming to do the spray foam on Thursday and our neighbors are are are literally painting and staining the boards now that we'll go in there it'll be whitewashed Pine and uh everything just fell together amazing um normally we would have to do the pine painting and the fellowship hall because it's too cold to do it outside and the neighbor said oh no bring that to my dad's shop and we'll just bring it when you put it up and it won't be in your way and so by next Sunday this it should be started some of the ceiling by two weeks from today it should be done the pine so the slowest thing that will be coming will be the window it'll probably be about four weeks we hope it's only that but the pine and that'll be all done the lights will be all done it'll just be it'll just be silver where the window goes till we put it in but it really did come together beautifully and and it was uh needful the the center stained glass that would move about an inch back and forth it sounded like a creakily sounded like me when I get up in the morning all my joints snap it would move back and forth about an inch and the plexiglass that was behind it was broken so a big one could have literally blew it out um but uh so we just praise God to be able to do that also we just I think we have an announcement um that uh we might I my desire would be if we could take a a church picture afterwards before everybody pulls their ties off and that in the fellowship hall because I believe uh sadly that this will be the last Sunday that Brother Joseph and sister Myra will be with us unless God does miracle in our favor amen and we love them we want what we don't want what we want we want what God wants and we wish them the they're part of us and always will be and and uh we uh just been a real blessing just uh to have Believers that enjoy the word of God and are very kind and appreciative amen It's just sad to see friends leave amen but it's it's all part of God's plan we're going to find that out today and amen just I cover your prayers I thank you brother Bart for praying for a couple weeks I've just felt like I was coming down with something but it never came down so uh we keep pushing him back and enjoying uh enjoying God's fellowship and that so amen amen let's stand and we'll read uh our scripture you know I got this thought from Brother Brown preached this right before he died the white dove it was about 10 messages before he died and he preached about four messages and one there and and I got this thought out of the beginning of his message and and it's just really beautiful and it's about Grace it's a covenant of Abraham and God did to Abram before he was Abraham and it really touched my heart and I believe it was will touch all of our hearts amen Genesis 15 1 to 1 to to 9 or 10 amen after these things the word of the Lord came to unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram now that that fear not is good for us today when the world's falling apart I am your shield and thou ex and thou exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this elzer the damsel and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given me no seed and low no one born in my house is my Heir and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he shall come forth out of thine own bowels now that's a type of Christ and us his bride and shall be thine Heir excuse me and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell me the stars and if Thou Art able to number them and he said unto him so shalt thou seed be and he believed in the Lord and it was counted unto him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord God that brought the out of Earth of the Chans to give Thee the land to inherit it let's just think of that spiritually in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Abraham said on said to him he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit the Holy Ghost and God said unto him he said take a red haer of three years old and and a sheo of three years old and a ram a three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and he divided them in its midst and he laid them each one piece against the other but the birds this is a key part but the birds he divided not Lord Jesus we pray that you'll add your blessing to the word God and we pray that God that in our honorability that you will portray this to the people like you gave it to me Lord Jesus and we give you the glory and honor for it in your name amen you may have your seats Hallelujah let's just uh pull up another scripture here I'm just looking for it here actually maybe we'll just uh uh Genesis 1 11 and 12 there we go just finding what I wanted here Genesis 1: 11- 12 and God said let the Earth bring forth its grass and Herb yielding of its seed and the fruit tree yielding F fruit after its kind and the seed is in itself unto the Earth and it shall be so and the Earth brought forth grass and herbs yielding seed after his kind and the tree tree yielding fruit after its kind and the seed was in itself after its kind and God saw it and it was good man we when we look into this scripture I just want to read a quote here talking about in the the breach between the seven seal and the Seven Church ages here here our Prophet talked about you know we're going to talk about God's covenant to Abram and it was it was an unconditional Covenant and it was amazing grace to us and it was all through ction and we're going to touch on that and uh you know if you look at a seed you can't it's the power of the seed is in the germ of life and and no matter what science can do they can never science itself can't even produce a germ of life because they can change the the attributes of the seed around it we we see that in the fing industry but they can't change the life they can they can make soybeans Round Up ready and corn Round Up ready and even wheat Round Up ready but the life is in the germ and where whever that germ was predestinated from that's what it will produce amen it's all based on predestination and germs from from the foundation of the world and so when God made a seed after its kind that's what we are this morning we are God's seed after the very Jehovah that he is amen and we see this and and see so when we look at Grace it says it's unmar favor of God it's it's it's uh it's not you're not acquitted you didn't earn it or you didn't observe it it it's nothing and when we when we get into this and we'll we'll see further down the the scripture and this is amazing but the the the the the concern that we have here is there's seeds on both sides and even your own and I'm going to show you something this morning this was amazing as you study the message even your own Free Will Choice can't change God's predestination Hallelujah even your mistakes can't change God's pre- will destination you know brother Bram said that and I don't have it in front of me in questions and answers after they preached the Hebrew series and I've been listening to that in my uh at night and and he said even the Free Will desire of the people God would change for his predestinated plan that that's beautiful amen when you look at that on the unmerited favor of God and it's something that we did nothing to deserve but it was God's plan amen let's look in the just a a a quote here to lay down the breach because we want to lay down some just a little bit of good Doctrine here the seals were broke why in the last Church age the last Church age ago to reveal the truce why the lamb broke the seals and he revealed them to his bride in order to collect the subjects that's what we are his subjects for his kingdom amen his bride see see Oh my he said he wants to bring you his subjects to himself amen now that was paragraph 266 and I'm just jumping some paragraphs and he said when he claims his inheritance that's the church the bride he'll claim you that's paragraph 179 and then we jump another paragraph and he said what what does he do then he disposes his contest to Satan and he throws him into the lake of fire with all those that were inspired by Satan to reject the word of redemption and he now we dro the next paragraph and he said now he's the king now watch this now but Mercy is still on the throne the breach between the seven Church ages he's the king now in other spots the prophet said that when he was King Mercy left but not here because of one word election he's the king now that's a direct paragraph 1 2 281 and mercy is still on the throne don't you reject his offer see he he's the riter and he knows just where you are Hallelujah you know if God's tugging on your heart this morning you should be the happiest person in your life amen to to to to know the very the very sign of election to God's family it's God's tug on your heart it's hard to believe that there's people in the world that have never and never will feel that desire be because they're elected to Eternal damnation and and I know you want to say where is it in the Bible that there's people elected to be lost and that's uh I'm glad you asked because that's in Jude 1 1-6 and we'll read that and and I just you know when you're turning there I want you to see that in the sacrifice here that God gave to Abram and I might say Abraham but it was before he got his new name he never divided the Dove and the pigeon because represented your healing and the prophet said that healing was always based even in the Old Testament this is powerful it was always based on your faith period it didn't even need the even under the the imperfection sacrifice healing was always based on your faith and so he never divided the pigeon and the dove because he never broke the healing that was for his people amen and he killed the one the Dove and a pig are exactly the same family and he would put the blood on the one and it and and the other one would fly and it would sprinkle the atonement for your healing today for your healing every day and and we're going to read some quotes in Jehovah Gyra he said we need to get rid of our fear and the church and recognize our position in Christ oh hallelujah it's beautiful it if if if you get even a part of what God has has delivered and and you know what our Prophet I would encourage you to go listen to the White Dove message it's it's beautiful amen very long but very beautiful amen and Jude here the Ser Jude the servant of Jesus Christ the brother of James to them that are Sanctified in God the father and uh preserved to Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved now I give you all diligent and write unto you the common salvation and it is Need for for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the Fai which was delivered to the Saints verse four for there are certain men crept in unawares that's in the well you can put your own definition in that but in and these some of these quotes and these verses and the message of the Prophet had about 50 uh quotes to these and there is certain men crept in unawares who were before of old or before of old ordained to condemnation that's why you you will see that there will be religious people you you have to you have to watch this you have you have three different sects of people in the Bible but then you have two different situations see we have the Jews we have the bride and we have the foolish virgin that'll go through the tribulation but then we have those that are of the Father the devil Satan and but you will have Believers that make mistakes and your Holy Ghost that's in you not in your pastor the Holy Ghost that's in you have to discern the difference between a believer that made a mistake and the devil and the mistake will look exactly the same wow wow because in many cases it could be a believer that just fell down now see a Believer the the difference is a Believer it's a mistake something caught on a Wares or or something that they didn't realize or or iniquity but if you intentionally premeditate see there's a difference between killing somebody and meditating and planning it it's called first degree or second degree and when you when you when you pre-plan that you have no desire to serve God Amen that's a really good sign that you're you know Amen pre-ordained to condemnation ungodly men sitting in the family of God or in the church because see they've crept in unawares ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and if you look into that word lasciviousness you can hardly mention the definition in a mixed audience but uh you can look that up but it's a a very lustful desire denying the only Lord God you see you don't watch this in the in the in the church world you have Satan dressed like a minister and a priest in and in the denominational world and and you know I'm not saying don't don't we need to have fellowship with those people because that's the only way that the the last seed will come in and and brother Dale wants to go into a Rapture so we got to find the last person in this town but if you birds with the prophet said this birds with feathers flock together and there will be people that are in the religious movement that are of the father of the devil and they've crept in on a Wares and their wolf and sheep clothing and if you hang with them you're it it'll cost you your life because you'll get eight amen so that's why that's why in Revelations 8 I believe it is Revelations 8 talked about the the great Babylon the has fallen and in verse I believe it's verse I think it's verse eight maybe 8 too verse 10 it said come out of her my people and be not partakers of her place now that don't mean you can't go to somebody's house and have lunch and you're not going to work with denominational people and and that don't mean you might go and have fellowship with them but when you start accepting their Doctrine you got a different God and there's not a church in town that's got to say same Doctrine or same God Amen because they have three gods and many other things amen so we have to be careful with these things amen and even even on that same line you watch this you know when and and I I know I I I kill this one but you know even in in Genesis when God made us in His image and there was a male and female part um feminine part in the man and God blessed them both I want I want to tell you something this morning and this might shock you and I can back this up by the Bible and the message and I'm going to give you a message example and this is not in my notes but this is free but your wife can hear from God and your wife can be more right than the head of the house you want an example brother bram's wife brother braham's wife told Brother Bram to go preach to the Pentecostal people she said honey go and I'll support you and brother brandom listen to his mother-in-law now the difference is the head of the house you'll see that you know you'll make the final decision but don't you can never treat your wife like she don't got connected with God because she has the same exact same Holy Ghost as you have it took exactly the same Calvary as it took for you and she got exactly the same yes God will deal through the head but sometimes the head is hard and sometimes God will deal through a softer vessel heyen I don't like that either oucho I'd hurt all the way down amen so you brothers that think oh bless God I'm the head of my house bless God God speaks to me and bless God you know there's some pastors like that around the country bless God I know everything the people don't know nothing well guess what uh-huh same Holy Ghost gifts and callings are without repentance so your headship if it's hard amen will save a lot of problems amen never make a major decision in your life for your spiritual now of course you know the the wife's a weaker vessel like so okay but that don't mean God don't speak to her there it's different positions but if your wife's on the word of God and she's coming to you in your private home and she's saying honey we shouldn't do this because of this and this and this and this and God show me this and this this and she's doing it reverent and respectful and you step on her God you're going to get the beating of your life you're going to get the beating of your life I wouldn't dare goote and do something major I wouldn't go out and spend too much money on a farm let told to Heaven my wife completely on board I'm not moving to Paris without my wife coming with me now just think of that spiritually I mean it's her family too it's her grandkids too she came from God do God blessed her too amen oh wow that hurt help us God Amen we need to recognize what are we to God does God think to you what are you to him the feminine sight did he listen to you does he listen to you when you pray and say help me God I I don't know what I'm doing God but you don't listen to your wife a perfect thing cuz you don't think oh my goodness the Bible said that if you mistreated her your prayers would be hindered I believe that's in James or somewhere RA in there in the New Testament your prayers would be hindered it's because God will protect her amen God help us to to know this right amen and so we see these these things let me just finish this scripture in Jude and I will therefore bring you to remembrance though once was knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not that's what it's saying you see see we we can't play once you're I me once you're once you realize the the the truth and the the message and the hour you can't play around with with G it the very thought that you would have an appetite for garbage would hinder your inheritance the Bible says that if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's Not In You you know there was people like watch this brother Brown said that Elvis Presley sold his Birthright cuz he like Cadillacs what's your love are you selling your Birthright because you want to have fellowship with these other people amen you will never be accepted in Fellowship of those other people they're they're only open to have fellowship with you because they want to win you to them amen and see God God's looking for men that divide not to compromise amen God help us amen see here and we we just uh just laying more of a foundation God the in Hebrews 16:4 and and I want to read some quotes on this but we see this this this actual Covenant to Abram that that God showed him was actually ripping the animals of apart and he and and he compared that to covenants and and and we'll read that but in Japan you know if they made a covenant they would throw salt on one another and it used to be when the Chinese families came to the states and they had laundry mats they they never knew English and so they would tear paper and when you came back you brought the piece of paper to the laundry mat the Covenant but in the Bible in in Abram's time they actually ripped sheep skin and goat skin and you would actually blend them back together and show that that's exactly where you come from and this is all talking about a covenant with Christ and the and the bride his wife that we were ripped from his side tore from his side and you go back to his side and no Minister man or or Creeds or dogmas or everything could ever contradict that you're going to fit together perfectly before the F oh it's beautiful Hallelujah here here in Proverbs 16:4 the Lord hasth made all things for himself yay even the wicked for the day of evil God help us God help us here here we we really want to preach on election and seed and and every seed will bring forth of its kind so you know the prophet said this he said you know if you if you came from God you're going to bring forth God but there's ones that are born that came from Satan and they're going to bring forth Satan and we see this here in in Genesis 3:15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and I will bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel seeing that God is separating the Beast here now here we just just forgive me for slowing down but I just want to catch some quotes here here in the mark of the beast the Seal of God he said the dove did you know that the dove will never you'll never see a dove taking a bath see you'll never see watch the typee here you'll never see a Christian bathing in worldly Traditions they might fall and make a mistake but they'll never be lavishing in the garbage amen you'll never see a dove caught taking a bath why because he don't have to he said he's clean from the inside through his feathers he has oil in his inside and it cleanses him from the inside the Holy Ghost cleanses him he said that's the way the real churches he said they don't have to be bed up and go back about this or another he said they got the oil the Holy Ghost Inside every believer and it keeps them clean from the world Amen you should be concerned if if the world has any attraction at all to you it should it should drive you to your altar in your closet and search out with God what's going on Amen oh if we could just preach the lamb and the dove sometime he said the Holy Ghost Inside the believer keeping him clean amen see the dove has no G and he said he could never eat anything on clean he said it could never taste of the world just like a real Christian he said blessed is The Man David said in the Bible blessed is the man who God will not impute sin Hallelujah whose name is in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and we just see these things and so if we we move Jump Ahead here uh let me just read this scripture before we do in Matthew 3:16 and 17 here here Jesus is coming to to John in the water and the water is the type of the Holy Ghost and here we have the prophet himself and the word of God walking and here they're looking eye to eye in the water and the thing and Jesus comes to be baptized and and up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens opened before him and he saw the the spirit of God descending like a dove and it was lightning on him and the voice came out of Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased see a dove was always a gentle spirit and that you know our Prophet said this he said as you as a Believer if you go in a place that a believer's not welcome he said the dove won't go with you he said the dove will wait outside amen that's a very strong terminology let me let me just show you something and I I I I this is this is kind of heavy so just you forgive me for this part but I just have to be truthful that's why I believe so strongly about homeschooling or Christian schools because I don't care how much your token is over that child you know the holy spirit's not welcome there I don't like that either uh and your Prophet said he will wait outside if your holy spirit will wait outside then what do you think that your Holy Spirit over your children's token will do amen you know we we're coming into an evil age and God's left us here for a reason and our light's got to shine I know I know everything's a progress and I know you know I'm not saying everybody can homeschool but if you can homeschool look for a Christian school or or we need to do radical things to stay clean radical things because we're A peculiar people and no different than you can't go to the same school with those with the devil you can't go to the devil's Church would you go to the Satan's Tabernacle there's no difference well I can show that by the Bible because the prophet said that every government of the country is controlled by Satan amen amen here we see in a uh in uh oh I can't even say this word where it's Grace preached from honey the book and uh Zachariah here Zachariah came to the prophet here in a vision and and he was talking about how Grace was see this was Abraham's Grace was come down here and and I'm going to read a quote from that but I just want to jump ahead to Zechariah and here in the uh Zechariah 2 5 and 8 here he said for for I saith for I saith the Lord will be be her wall be your wall of fire around about you and will be the glory in the midst of you and and verse eight for thus sayith the Lord of hosts after the glory hath I sent unto after the glory hath he sent me unto the Nations which spoil thee for he that touches uh the is the apple of my eye I'm getting an EO up here Amy I don't know what happened amen here here God was showing the grace to Abram and here he's showing it in Zachariah he's shown the same Grace and if we just jump to uh uh down farther in uh and let's read Zechariah 3 and we're going to read a few verses one and two there and he said and he said he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing right on his right hand resisting him and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee Oh Satan even the Lord which has chosen Jerusalem this is spiritual Jerusalem rebuke thee is not this the band plucked out of the fire and verse eight he said he now oh Joshua the high priest thou art thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men that wandered out for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch now praise God for the message up because here our Prophet breaks us down and this branch that the God's telling Joshua that he's going to bring forth is Christ amen and that was all the type of the Covenant to Abraham was was the the great token that Christ was going to do on calary for his believer so this branch is Christ now we read verse 9 and behold the stone that's in engraved with the gravings thereof thus sayith the Lord of hosts I will remove the iniquities out of the land one day we we see this this great Stone and and this stone is Grace Grace here in in in the same chapter and or or chapter 4 sorry verse 7 and who art thou old great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plane he's knocking down the evil ways and thou shalt bring forth The Headstone Christ shouting Grace Grace Grace now I want to look into the breach here the breach of the seven Church ages and let's look at this scripture here that brother Brown says he's talking about Zechariah here chapter 3 and 8 and n and he said the stones that have seven eyes on them behold I will engrave them and watch what he says these are in the paragraph he said this the eyes are meanings of the prophet and his bride it's a proph he says that in paragraph 237 in the breach and and this is a 63 message he said what is it he said it's Christ and his bride in the seven Church ages he said it's out there and the Seven prophets that went forth are the seers and the eyes of the last time he said now notice it's see it's wrote in the Bible in symbols that you won't understand and so here the prophet says he said you notice it's not an amnel at all he said he took the book and the right hand and sat on the throne he said who is it he said it's the owner the original owner of the book of redemption oh hallelujah amen it's an amazing story here in predestination and you'll see this when uh when if you went back to Abram and here this is this is a just an amazing part here in our first scripture that we read we stopped at verse 10 but let's just carry on I'm going to read a quote here in uh Genesis uh 15 and verse 11 and here Abram when when when they tore the carcasses apart God had told them what to do for the Covenant and he tore the carcasses apart and and this is so much like us in our flesh trying to serve God and Abram went out and he tried to chase the birds off in verse 11 to chase the doves off the the the bird words like he was going to do something for being saved and God brought the sun down and a and a great deep sleep fell on Abram in verse 12 and darkness fell over him and he said to Abram he said know assuredly that the seed thy seed watch this predestination election thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that's not theirs this was Israel in Egypt and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them around 400 years and and also that Nation whom Thou shalt serve I will judge and afterwards I will bring them out with the great substance this is God talking about the children of Israel where they were in Egypt and he's and he's and he's showing Abram how they were going to be there for 400 years but God through Amazing Grace was going to bring them out and and do a mighty work and bring them out with a great substance and take him to the promised land let me show you what that means in today's standard he said we're living in leoan and the world's gone completely insane but you're not going to barely make it you see what I mean spiritually you're going to go in thriving you're going to go you're not going to go in like oh bless God I'm barely oh I can barely pray no you're going to go in like a soier with your head up you're going to be great substance with great royalty and because it's it's all spiritual it's Christ doing it has nothing to do with us cuz see Abraham is asleep he said watch this he and and when the prophet we're going to look in this quote right now he said God put Abraham to sleep to show him one thing and he's showing us the same thing you got nothing to do with it just surrender to God Amen go to sleep God's got everything in control so that's the same thing today when you're looking at the news it's completely Insanity it's straight from the ped hell but you can go to sleep and rest in complete peace that he's not going to just save you not going to just say you're not going to just barely make it you're going in with a great heritance and the substance of your the world is yours in Christ's name amen it's thought that were looking for Rich I'm just saying your pride your life your dignity your your your your Purity your Holiness amen no man will see God without Holiness you're not not going to be a you're not going to be slobbered with garbage of this world on you you're not going to sell your birth right Hallelujah th this is a this is a great quote and and and I I I I ask for your forgiveness ahead of time but we have to slow down and read this because the prophet explains it amazingly he said here's Abram and he said Lord How will I know that it's your will this is in jeh a dry message and he said God said unto him he said your seed will be as the dust of the earth and he said but I don't have any seed at all see you you don't think that you you man your children are your heritage your children are your seed Abra God's God's God s to Abram he said I'm going to bless you with seed you don't even have you don't have to fear the seed that God's already give you amen oh it's beautiful here and he said now look up to heaven in another place and he said look at the stars and he said try to number them and he said and the dust of the stars and he said this Bible is perfect and brother Bram being a prophet Jesus broke down he said when God looked had Abram look at the dust and the Stars you know what the prophet said that spoke of redemption Amazing Grace from Earth to to Heaven Earth to Heaven it speaks of Amazing Grace he said you see it his spiritual mind ought to be able to pick that up quickly he said from the dust to the Stars he said he's the he's I can hardly read he said he's a chief Morning Star he's the the lily of the valley he's the feris of 10,000 he's all these things he's my kids and Redeemer and he's going to bring you out in a great hand and he said on to Abram he said come here and I'll show you and he and he and he told him what to do to to bring the halfer tear the halfer apart tear the goat apart this all speaks of Calvary tear the ram apart and he said he he never separated the dove cuz that spoke of healing and he said watch this and he said now we have to get to this sometime he said I'll show you something he said I'm kind of a typologist and he said I like types and shadows and he said now if you look at the name of Jesus and the five species Jesus name has five in it it speaks of Grace it speaks of many many things but he said what it was speaking of was the sacrifice to come the the very the very God that told Abraham to take these animals and rip them apart was talking of Christ to come the perfect sacrifice that would be ripped apart for him now think of the a the promise that God gave Abram under a under a imperfect sacrifice amen that you'll find that in Hebrews what is it 12 or 13 said look all the great Apostles and look at all the people what they did the Miracles they did the Holy Ghost wasn't even given wow unbelievable but true he said you look at the five different species it's Jesus speaking of the sacrifice scum and he said the three of them were chopped up in pieces J Jes and the other now he has this a capital letter this is right from our prophet and he said the other was us us Jesus and you he said was not separated it couldn't be separated it was part of the remember and Jehovah Gyra elect elected ones I'm this is a direct quote I'm reading directed on elected ones salvation saving us uh Inseparable and the entire Bride of the Living God was Inseparable regardless he said regardless of what denominational barriers may may try to separate there was one the bride was of one heart and he said I don't care what they are he said there wasn't he wasn't any separated it was Jesus Jehovah's elect salvation saves us because us is in Jesus that's what our prophet's saying he said now he said do you get it he said it's his elected ones following through Isaac coming out of the great one Christ and he said then you'll notice here and he's talking about uh Believers I can't even say it was an Old Church Believers in the past that they believed they were saved by works and he said Brethren I don't mean to rub this in now but he said you can just watch this real close and he said I'll show you it's not by works but your germ this is a paradox you got you got to bring this really close because even though ain't by works your germ will dictate what you are when I plant corn in the spring I don't expect a wheat field and when I splant Christ I don't expect the devil see the B it's really close can you say well I can just do any then it's a disgrace it's Grace to a disgrace well I can sin and God bless God you know he knows I'm his and no what God planted will come forth amen amen and he said so I can show you it's not by works it's by Grace by election by for knowledge it's God that does the saving and this is and he Compares this back to Abram when he went to sleep he said you have nothing to do with it now I want to reize this because we we need this for all of us myself included this don't give you a bill to sin this don't give you a bill to sin if if you feel like it gives you a build of sin it just proves that you never were in the first place see you know once in a while you know for me I in the farm and and and I'm just coming off here for a minute to show you something I grow whiteye beans and they're IP beans and they go to Japan and China and they make tofu with it and it's high in protein and it's disgusting don't stop eating beef because woo you will not like it near as much I promise you I seen it all and it looks like butterscotch puding but tastes a lot worse a lot worse and if You' seen how they ferment that in barrels and and water and whatever oh wow you know when I worked at the elevator nobody wanted to clean out the bean pits because rotten soybeans whoa it makes pigs smell smell like flowers it's the most powerful poon than you ever did see rotten beans are powerful soybeans but watch this but we're always concerned because one black eye one black eye in my seed will produce One stock of black ice and when I take a semi to the elevator and I'm getting $4 a bushel premium because I'm part of the bride and they find one black eye it's condemned you see what I mean so you can't hang around the world you ain't going to be a part of the world you're going to want pure seed you're going to want to hang around Pure White bride of Christ you see what I'm saying because see that other black eye can be a Roundup Ready it's genetically modified and they won't accept it in their country and it'll cost you eternal life amen and you know but our job when you look at this and you look at it natural and now our Prophet said right in here he loved typology so I'm in good hands here he said watch this you know when we plant in the spring too much Holy Ghost will drown the plant too much water will kill it dead is it good oh yeah it's good you can eat it you're mature you can eat steak but a babe can't they'll choke to death they'll drowned they'll drowned in their own throat here because their ticker ain't made yet to kick it down but our job this is our job in this day and our Prophet said we would be actually held accountable for it and and the best way I can explain this is naturally and especially in corn he said when you got to have the soil Your Atmosphere you if you don't think this town's watching you you're you're greatly deceived but the even the the your workplace and different ones have told me about your workplace but your ground has to be so perfect see if it's lumpy the the atmosphere won't be around the the predestinated seed that ain't shown yet but it has to be nice and fine and you got to have just the right amount of Holy Ghost moisture in that moisture and there's a special word that science calls it for the seeds to all germinate at the same time and see they need to all germinate they they call it you know what they call it in the natural they call it seed to soil conver conversion in the spiritual they call it Christ conversion it's called The Bride to Christ conversion and what we have to do and that's why our worship should be just lose your mind drunk but you have to create an atmosphere so when when a predestinated seed walking by the sidewalk and they feel the power of the Holy Ghost by exactly the right amount of water and exactly the right amount of clay and the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost comes out they couldn't help but bring forth life they would just explode because it happens it's just it's just it's predestination it's just God's thing and our job to find the last seed is create an atmosphere our job ain't to decide who it is and who it Ain but if we create the atmosphere see so when you have the atmosphere around you you you'll have people come out oh I didn't mean to say that I I I didn't realize you were here when they swear or something at work or there's something or you know what amen because they know there's a different atmosphere there and so watch this so when they're going to ready tell a dirty joke and they oh oh well you know I can't tell that because soeno was here see if if that atmosphere don't affect them then they don't have a germ of life but if it does that's the only thing that God will hold us requir for uh eligible was for creating an atmosphere but we need to be taught and to learn the right way we can't just drown them normally most of us because of our first love and because how much we love Christ we just smother people to death and they're like he said I'll hold you down a little longer you'll learn to swim no you'll drown man so when I go I'm sorry to tell you this but like when I go to the cornfield I don't plant when it's too wet I don't plant when there's too much Holy Ghost my old daddy you know he had great eight but he died a multi-millionaire because he'd go out to the ground he'd just kick it with his foot and he said give me a hunk of that dirt be when he was so old he couldn't bend down he just crumbled that I was like Christ he's crumbling the curs in his hand and our Prophet said in questions and answers in 50 57 he said God would that none would perish but he knew because he was omnipotent he knew that not all would follow him and he was creting an atmosphere in his head he said oh he said I think you better go get the cator he says I'm all ready to plant but they're Jehovah God and that's the only thing he'll he'll hold us you know what it's not our job to decide who's bride and who ain't bride it's our job to make an atmosphere for the ones that get thirsty that they'll they'll they'll need to quench their thirst and the ones that will be so salty and our light will be so bright that they'll like they'll take their sunglasses off and they'll say I want what that Hunter said the meanest man why the prophet hunted with the meanest man there ever was he said give me I said I'm losing my I said give he throw his gun down he said give me this Jesus that you're you're shown me before now the now watch this the prophet never preached to him I'll even I'll even clarify that the prophet only went with him because he was a good guide and he didn't get lost in the mountains but he created an atmosphere that if there was any germ any germ it I see a germ in an atmosphere cannot stop it's it's physical imposs when I I keep my seed over for a year I take it out of the atmosphere so it won't grow prematurely but when it hits the atmosphere of the temperature and the moisture and the and the ground quality I couldn't stop that from growing the prophet talked about he said you can pour a sidewalk over the grass and that grass that's all under the sidewalk come up and there'll be the W ther because you can't stop life but are we making an atmosphere for the life to grow amen help me help me God man watch this how he said he said he said uh he said you don't have nothing to do with it it's not him that willth here this is in Romans 9:16 if you want to know the scripture he said it's not him that willth or him that runneth but God that showeth mercy and Abram came down here on the side of the hill and he and he W and he was chasing the birds off I'm still reading this quote and they were piled up together and he he kept the birds off of his sacrifice he was he was keeping the bird he was keeping Satan off his life he was doing it all by works and God made a deep that's what the prophet says he said he made a deep sleep fallowing Abraham and now you haven't got nothing to do with it like Abraham he said I'm just going to shut you out here's God talking to Abraham he said I'm just going to shut you out and show you it's nothing to do with you at all or what you even want he's that's where you can see and brother Brown says this in question is answer because somebody directly ask him he said would your free moral agency will override God's predestinated plan he said never oh praise God for that cuz even when you make a mistake even a big mistake that's amazing grace hallelujah hallelujah he said I'm just going to shut you oh here he said it's here here he said I'm just going to shut you out and show you it's nothing what you do what you can do or what you want to do he said it's me Christ doing it I'm doing the saving you know we see that scripture we read a couple weeks ago where it's only God that has the right to judge it's only God that has the right to give life or take life oh that's beautiful save him when he started and he told him that he would come in his old age the seed would come in his old age and he saved his seed after him and God Did It by Sovereign Grace and so watch I mentioned this before this quote i' in studying I say it ahead of time he said so what are you scared about and and I'm preaching to myself this morning because when you the the the I I would advise you and man the world's you know don't watch too much news watch just enough to know that we're going in Rapture soon but wo you know I remember Jared saying during Co that there was so much going on it was hard to focus it it's actually a war going on in our mind see like we have to plant our potatoes but I don't think I'll be here to harvest them and and we're going home soon because we can see the season on does it matter that we're sighting the church and we're going to try to keep the heat bill in but but we're still here and and so like every day you wake up it's just like should I it's more for an entrepreneur because you you plan your life way ahead should I be buying a farm or selling a farm or does it even matter you know the prophet preach and you go back and look at that he said no continuing City he said we can't build Our Hope on this Earth nothing will last on this Earth You know when I see things all the time that change in the the farm world it's just unbelievable you know some of the country companies that were multi-trillion look at Sears who would have believed Sears would go broke there's no continuing City I think in the farming industry quality swine they used to buy all the weener pigs across Canada billion doll company chapter 11 bankruptcy the farmer Sid stepped them went directly into Partnerships and no continuing City you can go by the school you went to school it's probably closed and and just on and on the prophet preached about that he said you know we're looking for a city and Builder whose maker is God and and you know I I I keep thinking oh man there's so many and I I'm off my topic completely but I want to show you something I've talked to the neighboring and they're they're just full of kindness and and I I really encourage you to pray for them and and I mean God's doing amazing things and they're the backbone of this uh you know the interior stuff here but we were talking this week and he said Oh I thought you were talking about the bill and afterwards I brought it up he said you know like the states just P or Canada sorry just passed the bill on January 9th and this stuff affects me I'm only human it passed the bill that if you preach what we believe it's 5 years prison sentence I I can show you the bill online it's already passed and and I was asking Matt different things and and I was even talking to Matt last week you know and there's things happening that we can't survive here I I'm sorry for you if you don't believe the Rapture is happening but there's things happening you won't be able to live on this Earth hello hello you know that they passed January 9th that it's against the federal law to read the the scriptures in public in Canada against the law it's against the law for a pastor parent to counsel somebody for things that are very Premier in Canada right now it's 5 years prison sentence that's including in church if somebody came to me and asked counsel and then they went and reported me you could see me behind bars next Sunday we can't stay here we cannot survive in this atmosphere but at the same time God chose to protect us here and it's supernaturally so it's a battle in our head and we just have to we still have to go on and have families and plant our potatoes and and that's what our Prophet told us and because I mean maybe maybe we will be here 20 years from now I don't see how we could but we have but God will we know this that we're going to go out with great substance amen we know that we're going out with great substance we're not just going to barely survive the Rapture there will be a Supernatural protection on those you know the prophet said that the plagues and the things that would come on the word the world at the end times would never touch them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God has a supernatural thing and so then he comes here he says what are you scared about that's a battle brother Dale deals with what are we worrying about well just about everything God in the world just about everything he said 'what are you scared about he said 'what's the matter with the church today he said you're afraid he said ' don't be afraid he said ' if God be for you then who can be against you that's Romans 8:31 Romans 8:31 he said stop being afraid well I think he was preaching right to me that was whenever how many years ago he said take his word and let the Holy Spirit come into your life so so and it and so it you won't be feeble anymore and let it wake up the realization that the very hour you're living in and the time that you're living in he said watch Christ he said Abraham God put him asleep to move him right out of the picture now watch this it's just like God saying now now watch this this is Abram he put to sleep because he was keeping the birds off the carcass the sacrifice it's just like he's saying don't watch the news just don't worry about nothing because I got everything in control and he does and he does but we we have a battle on in our head he said now you ain't got nothing to do with it Abram he said I'm just going to shut you out I'm going to read this quote and and stop amen he said I'm just going to shut you out he said it's not what you can do oh sorry com went up above sorry he said he put Abram to sleep he said you're out of the picture now and he said then as soon as he did that Abram fell asleep and he said it came the great Darkness think of the evil of the age he said the Great Dark which means death and every Mortal must come to this place is death he said it came to the smoking furnace that's what he talks about in the in the and the scriptures the Smokey thermos and it was hell where the Sinners would go I'm just going to finish this quote and we'll we'll close on this he said now today he said when you and me make a covenant and he talks about that I'm just going to jump through that we already mentioned that he talked about how our covenant like we would we would buy when I bought the girl's house you know uh we didn't have nothing on paper paper the guy come up and and we we agreed on the phone to a price and and uh he said you got the money and I'll take this much and six months later and there was people in and mooving the house and they were having a heart attack and I said what's the problem they said but you ain't got nothing signed I said well we agreed he said but but it ain't on paper and I said I've known this guy since I was birthed man we're not living in that kind of a world now but it used to be like that people's word did you know the prophet said he said you're only as good as your word you shake somebody's hand you say I'll be there I'll do this I you know I agree and you know it's all set down because it was like a covenant amen God help us and he said if they would break the Covenant it was is the one that would break it would be the death would be as the death of the Beast he said that's what a oath is it's only the Covenant can manifest that both men would bring both pieces of the flesh he said now what's God doing he said he was show Abraham and and I'm I'm trying to hurry here he said he was showing Abraham how he was going to Father the Nations and through Isaac would bring would come Christ and that was Calvary god Jehovah the father would take his own son to Calvary and lay him upon the sins of the world and would tear him apart that would tear us apart from Christ oh I I pray you get part of this amen he would tear us from Christ and the and and he took his body to glory and he would set the Holy Ghost back on us and it would and then comes Redemption and the same spirit that was in Jesus would be on you and you could take the other piece of the Covenant that was actually ripped from Christ side on the calvary which was you and me there's nobody can take that from you Hallelujah and you just PST that right back together and he said he's doing the same thing that Jesus did was a covenant the signs and Jesus will have this body of Christ make his bride and there's God's covenant it was the life of Jesus that we tore out of him and he sent it back on his bride I'm going to just finish this last paragraph and he said I'm so glad to know that Jesus said if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then you can ask what you will and I'll give it unto you that's John uh 15:7 that's right and he said and he that abideth in me though he is dead yet shall we live and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die Hallelujah that's amazing grace she'll never die and he said that's the Eternal promise that he gave to his church the bride and the works that I do that you'll do also and Greater Works because I go to my father what a wonderful promise that is amazing grace and the and the Blackness of Leo to sin and the Blackness of politics and the Blackness of sin like like it was in in Genesis there when he's talking to Abraham he he you can rest with the Holy Ghost and go to sleep in Christ and say I don't have nothing to do with it I don't have to get gray hair from worry we're the bride of Christ should all go home this is in Paradox with your with your your original hair because you would never you see what I mean we can just surrender to Christ and he said so what do we scared about because it was all Christ and I I love that part I want to just close that part I'm going to close this I'm nowhere near the end but he said we're going to not only will he save us and not only is he not depending on our works but you're going to go out with a great substance amen that that's an amazing promise to think that we're not just going to barely slip out of here with the skin of our teeth amen I don't mean a great substance in the way of wealth I mean in the great substance with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the anointing of God and building an environment around I could care less about money the environment around us and our dignity and our and our Holiness and our and we can ride our head up and you can walk in town not not in an arrogant way but in a in a in a humility respectful way and say I am she the Lamb's wife amen and and some will love it and some will hate it and we need to recognize what that is it's just amazing you know there was many in the Bible that were ordained to death I just want to I'm closing really but elaser was one Pharaoh was one amen and many more that were just predestinated to death Judas a scariot was other ones that their seed was the seed of Satan brother Brown talks about that scripture both of those scriptures about 40 times in the message Hub multiple quotes you you just read it and read it and and study it and just cross reference it in but he's got everything in his hand he's got everything under control man your worry ain't going to change the world environment it's not going to change politics we don't know who's going to war with who we don't know who's winning the next election in either of our major countries and it really don't matter I'll tell you ahead of time amen it just matters that we build the atmosphere that the last predestinated seed remember this if you have the right atmosphere they can't help but grow they cannot help but grow remember the Bible says that you would be salty thirsty that make them thirsty but you would also be the light which is the the light of the Holy Ghost see when the light hit you know the prophet talking about when the light hit the seed where will that light come from you it's beautiful it's beautiful he's got it all in control let's sing that song Let's stand Hallelujah he's got it all in control when everything's Fallen apart amen the Covenant here he showed Abraham you know Abram had it worse off than us he was in an unstable country he was going to a country he' never even been to so he didn't know nothing about the politics he had no family at all he had no seed and and the Holy Ghost had him been given then amen we're under a perfect sacrifice and you think of all what they did under an imperfect sacrifice and a type of the real that that's what Abram got from tearing animals apart but now God came and he tore himself apart for you there's no limit what you will do for him oh hallelujah oh it's beautiful you know I had this message probably in my iPad two months ago I I had it way before I preached the other messages it was just beautiful because I listen to the message when I'm in my when I go to bed at night and and I was listening to the white DOB and you know brother Brown's last month of preaching the messages are much different much different cuz he maybe didn't know but God knew he was going home and it changed the anointing and it was all about who you are and how you're connected to him oh oh it's crazy good church it's crazy good amen God bless you I'm sorry to I don't even this clock says 10:30 and I'm sure it's not 10:30 but amen just uh he's amazing he's got it all in control he's got it all in control he's [Music] got [Music] so every road I rock down in
