Come up a little higher going through the journey of the I hear it. Oh my I hear it. [Applause] have to follow that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's a tough act. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that is good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Good thing. Good playing. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; He wants to take us higher. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. I love that. &gt;&gt; He wants to take us higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Oh, I'm not as organized as you. Oh, &gt;&gt; you're ready. &gt;&gt; Well, I was doing dishes. I was doing dishes. Not getting ready for this. &gt;&gt; So, well, I hate this. Now, we're going to kind of slow this down a little bit. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's okay. &gt;&gt; And uh I don't know. Is this on? Maybe you can hear me. &gt;&gt; I was going to plug in. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We'll get there. &gt;&gt; We'll get there. I can find that. There we go. No, it isn't. Good grief. &gt;&gt; There we go. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the biggest trouble. She switched guitars to come up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She's got one at home she don't like to travel with and she switched guitars and now she thinks she's playing a toy. &gt;&gt; It's a big toy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Well, it has been amazing to be here so far. &gt;&gt; It It has. I have just loved every minute of this. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And um I love meeting I've got a new friend, Ruth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel like I've got a new I feel like all of I mean, all of you are because we all have that one thing in common, don't we? &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, so, um, this song is pretty slow and it's a newer song. &gt;&gt; Is that going to stay on? &gt;&gt; Something feels funny. Um, this is a little bit newer song and a little bit out of my comfort zone, but uh, it's awesome words and &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, um, we can grumble. Who likes to be around grumbly people? Well, God doesn't like it either. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God doesn't like that either. &gt;&gt; And um &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the more thankful we are, &gt;&gt; the closer we we get to him. &gt;&gt; No matter what our circumstances, &gt;&gt; and it's hard in some circumstances, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's hard. That's true. &gt;&gt; Um it is. It's hard to be thankful. &gt;&gt; But the more we are, the closer he comes to us. And so if you want to stand in worship and raise your hands, &gt;&gt; just just do whatever you want to do in your worship here. &gt;&gt; Um, so this song is called Gratitude. It's a newer song. I say newer, but it's probably about 5 years old. Um, but that's new to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is Gratitude. And like I said, just bear with us. Just praise God. All my words fall short. I've got nothing new. How could I express all my gratitude? I could sing these songs as I often do. But every song must sing and you never knew. So I th my hands and praise you then and again. All that I have is a hallelu [Music] hallelu. [Music] And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] I've got one response. I've got just one news. [Applause] With my arms stretch wide, I will worship you. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. All that I have is hallelujah. And I know it's not much, but I have nothing else for a kiss except for a heart singing hallelu. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Lord unto me. So I throw up my hands, praise you again and again. All that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else if you're a king. Except for a heart singing hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Both all those songs. Those are just wonderful. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name, Jesus. And let's sing it out.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you happy to be a Christian this morning? to know him and his death, burial, and resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's a a privilege. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me just a minute as I set my timer up here. &gt;&gt; We don't need that. &gt;&gt; I was ministering I was ministering at a church uh the other weekend and I forgot to set my timer and I looked at my wife and I said, you know, give me the give me the sign when I start going too long. And then like a typical husband, I proceeded never to look at her again. [Music] &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; it's it's uh it's good to be with you and &gt;&gt; my goodness, just to hear the word last night and his power &gt;&gt; was just beautiful. And I &gt;&gt; I would get anything to have someone else ministering this morning. Uh, I feel like I'm in a a sandwich in between Brother Junior, an amazing minister, and then we got Brother Bartley just fantastic, wonderful gifts, and then here I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stuck stuck in the middle with you. &gt;&gt; And uh, you know, the but I'm grateful to be here with you. I appreciate the opportunity, the invitation just to share a little bit what's on my heart. My wife asked me, she said, "John, what are you going to talk on?" And I said, 'Well, I think I'm going to talk about the bride and realizing who she is. &gt;&gt; And she says, 'You know, that's what you always talk about. &gt;&gt; But, you know, there there are things that are that are important, &gt;&gt; you know, and there's a there's a mystery tied to that that when the bride realizes who she is &gt;&gt; and that she can do the greater works that she'll be an invincible army. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, part of the call of ministry is is to help the bride understand who she is. And so, we'll turn first of all to the book of Jeremiah and chapter 24. We'll just read one scripture and then we'll let you have your seats. Just give me a amen when you get there. &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of amens yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Jeremiah chapter 24, we're just going to read verse 7. This is God speaking. He says, "I will give them a heart to know me, &gt;&gt; that I am the Lord, &gt;&gt; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, &gt;&gt; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart." &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus just bless the reading of his word as you have your seats this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Bless him. I love this scripture because we he's given us a heart to know him. He's given us a heart to to uh to understand him, to know who he is, not just in the Old Testament or not just through the apostles, not just through uh Luther and Wesley and the the church ages, not through just brother Brandham, but through through usmen, &gt;&gt; through who you are. That's the the mystery of God that that was supposed to be finished in the book of Revelation told us the Godhead. But the greater mystery is that it also revealed to us who we are as part of him &gt;&gt; that we were always with him, always in him. &gt;&gt; And uh that's right. &gt;&gt; Uh and so I I want to I I want us to recognize that that who who we are in him and our position in Jesus Christ and what we the authority that we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's given us a heart to know him. But I want a I want a heart to see him in you. &gt;&gt; I want a I want a heart to see him in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to I want to understand what God can do through this broken carnal flesh that every day fights the you know we say we put the old man on the on the altar, you know, as a sacrifice. And every I don't know about you, but every day my old man jumps off the sacrifice right away. You know, he doesn't like being sacrificed at all. But uh you you know we're we're called to live a life &gt;&gt; a life of separation, a life of of suffering just like he did. &gt;&gt; Um there if you're living a Christian life and you have no suffering, you have no pain, you have no hurts, you have no troubles, no battles, I I want I will I question your experience &gt;&gt; because Jesus said in this world you shall have troubles. &gt;&gt; The word says that. And so, you know, I think we do go through times where things are smooth and everything, but I'll admit, you know, when things start going really smooth for me, then I start getting nervous. I know I know big trials coming right around the corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; let me get to back to my notes here. &gt;&gt; It's uh it's good to be with you. &gt;&gt; It really truly is. And to see the the different ministry represented here. Any one of you should be up here rather than me. And I I really truly believe that as a as a minister that we're servants of God. &gt;&gt; Not just servants of God, but servants of his children. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I don't like that that we ever really put somebody up on a on a pedestal. Like, we we appreciate their gifts. We appreciate what they do for the body, but there's no great ones among us. We're all equal. And if anything, the ministry is less than. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're here to serve, not to be served. &gt;&gt; And so we we want to take the burden and the sacrifice of for the people and and work for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To help you along the way. And so I just pray that a little bit of what I might say here might speak to each one of you. Um God God knows where each one of us are at. Now, I don't know where where you're at, but if something is said that would strike your heart, I just pray that you would take that and accept it as as for you. And, you know, if the shoe fits, wear it. &gt;&gt; And um &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, I think we'll all get along just fine that way. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't have to be we don't have to be on our guard &gt;&gt; around believers. You know, we really don't. We unfortunately many times we do. We we're just we're on guard. We don't really reveal all of our self to one another. We we hold things back, you know, the the things that are unloly and uncumbly. We we don't tell one another because we don't want people to think ill of us. But, you know, that's the exact opposite of what the Bible teaches, &gt;&gt; that we're supposed to share our burdens with one another, that we're supposed to uh disclose our faults and failures to one another so we can bear one another's burdens. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, it's like it's kind of like social media today that everybody puts their perfect stuff on there, you know, all all the best pictures, the the pictures of the best looking food, the nicest outfits, the nicest dress, you know, beautiful sunsets, and and it it creates this illusion of a perfect life. &gt;&gt; And I don't have a perfect life. &gt;&gt; I don't think that any of you have a perfect life. So, we don't have to pretend around one another &gt;&gt; that we're all here struggling together. &gt;&gt; And so, while we're here, let's just uh &gt;&gt; let's just relax ourselves in this time. You know, I'm standing here in a in my nicest suit &gt;&gt; and I and I'm standing here and the thought that goes through my mind is I am totally overdressed for this. &gt;&gt; I'm totally over You know, but we get stuck in traditions and for inmalism, don't we? We get stuck in, oh, you need to have the three-piece suit on to ministry. You have to have a white shirt and a tie and and a jacket. But, you know, Brother Brand had uh humble nights at the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Everybody come in just their normal clothes. You know, if you were a mechanic, you'd come in your overalls and, you know, if you were a baker, you'd wear your apron. And and we just would realize we're all just like one another. We're just people struggling to make a living and to raise our families, you know, united under the banner of love. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I want you to be free today. I want you to be to be free that you don't have to be locked up. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be guarded and reserved. &gt;&gt; Get to know one another. &gt;&gt; Have a little bit of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there there the the Bible tells us there's no Jew, no Gentile, no free, no bound, no educated, no uneducated. &gt;&gt; No black, no white, no African, no Canadian. We are all God's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the attitude we need to have all the time. &gt;&gt; And so tomorrow when I come to service since I won't be preaching, &gt;&gt; I plan on wearing jeans and boots &gt;&gt; and I'm just going to be uh I'm going to have humble Sunday. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just I just want you to be free to say God bless you. To say or or uh what's the what's the French um uh &gt;&gt; duv right? &gt;&gt; So there we go. We can all say it. &gt;&gt; You know Jesus said that in John 8:36 that if the son therefore shall make you free, &gt;&gt; you're free indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so there's no need to be bound up. There's no need to have tension and and not be relaxed and just enjoy yourselves in the presence of God. And that's what we're here to do today is just to enjoy ourselves in the presence of God to hear a little bit of his word &gt;&gt; to bask under the anointing of his presence to go out, have a meal together, fellowship, and then do it again this evening. And it's just a wonderful time in the in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And now I'll start my timer. [Laughter] They that know me know that I struggle with this. Yeah. I was thinking I was thinking as I was studying that as we grow older in the Lord, we find that there are many things that still bind us &gt;&gt; that must be walked away from. You know, when we're young in the Lord, we we become sanctified. when we give up the the smoking and the drinking and the fornication and and those obvious things that are that are incompatible with the scripture and Christian life. And some of us were freed from pornography, from addictions and and vices. &gt;&gt; And as you began to grow in the Lord, you began to let go of these these things of the world that pulled on your flesh, &gt;&gt; and you began to live a good Christian life. Now, I turned 47 here in just a a short little time. I just retired from my first career, and I feel like I'm getting to that point where Brother Brandham said that if you're going to do something from the Lord, you better do it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've I've come to realize that even as I've I've known this message now going going on 25 27 years uh that there's still more of myself &gt;&gt; in chains and bondage. &gt;&gt; That there's more of myself that that needs deliverance. That there are more things that I need to lay down &gt;&gt; that are the small things. &gt;&gt; Bitterness and pain from my past. They need I need to lay lay down anger and attitudes, &gt;&gt; the things that we we allow them to be in our life. And sometimes we justify them. &gt;&gt; We justify because we've been hurt by people. We justify because our parents hurt us or or we've struggled in life and and we've we've questioned the why. &gt;&gt; And we've developed attitudes and and even attitudes towards God and our situation instead of being content wherewith we find ourselves. &gt;&gt; Come on. And so there comes a point in our life where it's no longer about getting rid of the big things. Not that there is any great sin or little sin. It's all sin. &gt;&gt; But to we it's easy to get rid of the things that that you expect to get rid of as a Christian to to stop going to bars, to stop gambling, to stop doing, you know, these these things that the world loves and enjoys. But then we have to start focusing on refining on God refining our inner man. &gt;&gt; It's easy. It's easy to clean up the outside. &gt;&gt; And a lot of people come to church and they clean up the outside &gt;&gt; and have no revelation on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would rather a person come to church, struggle, be be here in a bikini or half naked or whatever and still come and hear the word of God. And I wouldn't judge that person for where they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a lot. But I look out at you and you look at me and and we begin to realize that even if we've been in this message for a long time, that there are things that are inside of us that must be let go. &gt;&gt; That that if we if we are going to continue to grow into the stature and image of the perfect man that there are besetting sins, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; that we have to be delivered from, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And those can be attitudes. &gt;&gt; It can be bitterness. It can be resentment towards our parents or resentment towards situations in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I would I would tell you that this morning that that the bonds that hold you today, the the the little things as you examine your life in your daily prayers and you see you see where you struggle with these these small small things &gt;&gt; and how much they hold you back that God has set you free. &gt;&gt; You are free now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only bondage that you are in is the bondage that you allow yourself to be in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because who the son has set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; And so we don't want to remain under under a self-inflicted or self-imposed slavery, &gt;&gt; a self-imposed bondage to sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. to to wallow in attitudes &gt;&gt; and bitterness and allow those things to to manipulate our life's course &gt;&gt; where we're always reactive to people expecting them to say the worst things about us &gt;&gt; that that we're reactive to people and think that they're going to talk about us behind our back and so we don't we don't speak with them we don't fellowship with them we we withhold ourselves from them &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but we're withholding ourselves from the body of the Lord &gt;&gt; and so I would tell you that those chains are only placed there by you. &gt;&gt; Once you have been delivered by Calvary, &gt;&gt; you are free. &gt;&gt; You are free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if it may take time for those chains to fall away as you let them go, &gt;&gt; but the moment you come to Calvary and you give yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you are completely totally free. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem is is that so many times we walk away from the cross and we say we we lay our burdens down and we lay our chains down. We say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm free. We praise and we worship." And then we get up off of our knees and we just pick the chains back up and we just take them right along with us as we go. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you that you don't have to do that this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm grateful for freedom to worship. I'm grateful. I I was in Africa here not too long ago in in Nigeria ministering and I just loved how the people there, you know, they they they were so completely free in their worship &gt;&gt; and in their freedom. You know, in in the in the states where I'm from, you know, the further south you go, the freer you get. &gt;&gt; Southern southern people are a whole lot more free than Yankees uh up in the north. Right. And &gt;&gt; so, you know, you cross into into Canada and some of that starchiness is still there. And it's just like, no, let's just worship and have a good time. Let's just enjoy the presence of God and the good things he has for us. And let's not be afraid to raise our hands and and, you know, I don't care if I' I've got a nice suit on or not. You know, if I feel like a worshiping God down in the straw pile, then praise the Lord. I'll get down in the straw pile. It'll be all right. &gt;&gt; Suits can get dry cleaned. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brandham said, I love this. In in that day on Calvary, 1960, he says, "He broke the powers of Satan. Every freedom that could ever be offered to you, as I said, was given to you that day on Calvary." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's the work's already done. So, he broke the powers of Satan. He opened the prison doors of hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons, fearing that when he died, what death would be to him. on Calvary, he opened those cell doors and let every captive go free. &gt;&gt; Brother Ray, it says you do not have to no longer be torn down by sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what sin does is it tears you down. &gt;&gt; It takes you away from your heavenly position and and your your position of authority in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you recognize that you fall short. &gt;&gt; And so and when you fall short, you lose confidence in who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I was a How many times has the devil told you, "Well, if you were a Christian, you wouldn't act this way. If you were a true believer, you wouldn't have never done that. What's wrong with you?" &gt;&gt; And so, the devil's all the time whispering in our ears. And and I don't know about you, but most of the time, if he's not whispering in my ear, my own conscience is whispering in my ear. &gt;&gt; But the thing is is God has set us free. &gt;&gt; That I don't have, we don't have to be torn down by sin. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we have an option &gt;&gt; to overcome. &gt;&gt; We have an option to live above it &gt;&gt; a choice to be made. &gt;&gt; Every day we we are challenged to make choices on how we will act and react to things. How we will how we will uh choose to behave towards someone else. whether or not we're going to recognize the Christ in that person, &gt;&gt; whether or not we're going to fellowship with that person, whether or not we're going to do the dishes for our wives, or whether or not we're going to fill up her car with gas. I never I never seem to do that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on, he says, "You don't have to no longer yield your members to sin, &gt;&gt; to drinking, smoking, gambling, telling lies." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And maybe I would just say it like this. You no longer have to yield yourself &gt;&gt; to bondage. &gt;&gt; Even in this message, &gt;&gt; even in this word, we can be placed under bondage. &gt;&gt; I And I don't know about you, but the more that that I've traveled, the more that I've been exposed to in ministry, the the more bondage I see people in who are supposed to be free. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you run across things that just they're not scriptural, they're not right, they're not balanced, they're not even in the message. And I'm talking about &gt;&gt; things that are so legalistic that they just don't make sense. &gt;&gt; Like, and if you disagree with me, you feel free to disagree with me. It's okay. I I I can take a punch. But, you know, like there there are things where people say that men cannot have this kind of a a pocket on their trousers &gt;&gt; that needs to be in line with the sea. I there there are people in this message that believe that a woman who wears a jean skirt cannot have a zipper in the front because that looks like a man. It needs to be in the back and she can't have pockets on her skirt because that's going to somehow attract the men's gaze. &gt;&gt; And it's like no that there there's other problems here. &gt;&gt; There's other problems here. What that is is somebody trying to control a situation, control a person where you can't even go and buy a vehicle unless you consult the pastor. &gt;&gt; You can't court a girl unless you go and consult the pastor. That's bondage. &gt;&gt; It should not exist within our ranks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you can be honest. &gt;&gt; You can be just and upright. We don't have to be to be in these kinds of conditions. &gt;&gt; We don't have to accept this this reality that people would place upon us. The reality that the Satan would place upon us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. There you go. &gt;&gt; He says you can be honest. Just not just honest with other people, but you can be honest with yourself. &gt;&gt; You can be honest between you and God. I don't know why people want to lie to God anyway. &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows everything. And and people people go to prayer and that, oh Lord God, forgive me of my wrong things that I've done, you know, and just &gt;&gt; help me, Lord, not to commit those wrong things again. And don't even want to admit what they've done. &gt;&gt; Don't even want to admit that they lusted or or or done told lies or done something. They're too afraid to be honest with God to even admit what they've done, to call it a sin. God doesn't forget. God does not forgive you doing something wrong, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God forgives sin. &gt;&gt; Sin and everything that is not like him is sin. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful that we have a blood that's been applied a token to raise over our houses, over our families, and over our lives that shows and proves that we've been forgiven. Brother Brandham says he says you can be honest, just and upright and Satan can do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; He cannot do a thing about it &gt;&gt; when you're this way. When you walk this type of a life, he can't touch you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the point that we want to get to is where we walk in such a life that when we get up out of bed, the devils tremble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you know all the devils that are arraigned against us as believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thousands and thousands of of demon powers focused just on this bride, &gt;&gt; on this church, upon this revelation &gt;&gt; ready to distract you, to make you stumble and fall, to provide you opportunities to sin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you get up out of bed every morning, Satan should be trembled. &gt;&gt; Not him again. &gt;&gt; Not her again. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, there she Isn't it funny to think about it? It's funny to think about it. the devils would tremble at you. &gt;&gt; That when you get up out of bed and they're just ready, they're just ready. They, "Oh, it's a new day. I'm going to get him today. I'm going to get him today." And then the first thing you do when you slide out of bed is you you you don't get up. Maybe you set up on the edge of bed and you kind of stretch or the devil's the devil's stretching. It's like, &gt;&gt; "Going to get him today. Going to get him today." And then you just kind of lie down off the edge of your bed and you get down on your knees &gt;&gt; and you start praying for the day. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The devil's just like, "I don't like it. I thought I was going to get them and here they are. They're already fighting me." &gt;&gt; That's the life &gt;&gt; where you can live &gt;&gt; and be honest and just &gt;&gt; and Satan can do nothing against you. Can do nothing to stop you. No weapon formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? Brother brother brother Brando says why? because you have got a hold of a life a line a lifeline that's anchored in the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing can shake you from it. No wind can shake you from it. No, nothing, not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. That's what Calvary meant. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm certain that uh if you're anything like me that as you prepared to come to camp this service even that that the enemy was attacking you. And now here we are in service and and we've sung the songs of Zion and we've worshiped and we've read a scripture and we remembered in our lives what the Lord has done and we could close the service right now and we could go away rejoicing and being happy &gt;&gt; and it would have been a good day. It would have been a good service &gt;&gt; if God had there's a there's a um every every uh Easter every Passover my family and I we sit down we have a a Passover meal together and we go through the Exodus story and we we talk about it and the the meanings and the types and there comes a point where we where we rehearse what God has done. And if if God if God had only brought us out from Egypt, it would have been enough. &gt;&gt; If God had only done this, it would have been enough. &gt;&gt; If God had only saved me from my sin and never talked with me again, it would have been enough. &gt;&gt; If God had only healed me from that sickness that one time and never healed me again, it would have been enough. &gt;&gt; And we go around around the table and we start rehearsing those things. We say it together. It would have been enough. it would have been enough. But no, he's done more and more and more. And he always is doing more in our lives. &gt;&gt; And so when we get down upon our knees and we start fighting our fight and we we begin to fight our battles, we begin to stand as one united army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; United together with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Under the captain of the Lord of hosts. And you know this morning, I imagine if we could look into that realm and we would see those devils &gt;&gt; and how they're struggling right now. You know that there are angels encamped round about this place. &gt;&gt; And there are devils and demons struggling to get in. &gt;&gt; And can I say this with all respect that there are probably devils and demons here right here that are struggling and fighting to get out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there are devils and demons that are right here among us that are struggling to stay in. &gt;&gt; God deliver us from them all. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that the the battle belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's uh it's a day and an age that is shaking and trembling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, every age has lived through uh time since the beginning has always thought that this was the last day, &gt;&gt; that this was the last time. They have the same scriptures that we do. They read the same verses that we read and they they believe that the the Lord was coming soon and and and yet time went on and time progressed until it got to this day. And we look around and we know by scripture and we know by the foretelling of of modern events made clear by prophecy that we are truly at the last days &gt;&gt; and and this is the time of the Lord's coming. This is the time of the Lord's appearing and soon we shall see him face to face. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's not it's not something that's a far off, but rather that we that this this generation that saw the fig tree putting forth his leaves will not pass away till all things are fulfilled &gt;&gt; and we will see him and we will know him even as he knows us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the world is falling apart. Brother Brandham says this. He he's talking about the new kingdom and the new heaven and new the new earth. And he says um he references Hebrews 14:25. He says, "For we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved." And then he asks the question, "How did we get into it?" Not by a religious system. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Not by coming to a message church. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Not by sitting on a message pew. &gt;&gt; Not even sitting in a Christian church or a Christian pew. That does not make you that does not put a kingdom within you. &gt;&gt; No. No, &gt;&gt; you cannot receive a kingdom just by attending church. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you cannot just receive a kingdom by saying you're a Christian and doing good works and good deeds. &gt;&gt; No, it the uh brother asks, "How did we get it?" Not by a religious system, &gt;&gt; but rather the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; It's not something that we have to struggle and reach out to obtain. &gt;&gt; It's within us. When we come to him and we give our lives to him, he fills us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth. He says, the king and his word is the same and it's within you. &gt;&gt; And what's it doing? Listen to this. He says, &gt;&gt; let me read it again. The king and his word is the same. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's within you. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; What's it doing now? He says it's vindicating the hour that we are now living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It the the the spirit of God within us looks at the things that are happening around this world and recognizes where we are in time. It witnesses the dispensation that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And propels us and drives us to be closer to God. &gt;&gt; To sacrifice more and more of our own will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He goes on and just let me read for just a few moments. He says, "The promise that God made for this age, here we are living with the king, sitting in heavenly places, watching him do doing these things." &gt;&gt; Now, he's talking about this is 1963. He's obviously he's talking about the ministry. The seals were just open. This is November. Um, and so he's talking about all the great things that God is doing, but God is still doing great things. &gt;&gt; God is still revealing himself to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on, he says, and he says, how can we turn from that word to some system? &gt;&gt; And I think about how many people have will will choose to leave the vindicated word of the hour to go and return to a system. &gt;&gt; He says what what does it do? It denies the word. &gt;&gt; And he says you have to receive &gt;&gt; to reject truth. You have to receive truth in order to be able to reject it. Right? &gt;&gt; Judas could not betray Jesus. Unless he was a friend of Jesus &gt;&gt; unless he walked with him and talked with him and slept with him and ate food and broke bread with him and became a friend to him and a disciple, it would not have been betrayal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so these people that that leave, they they have to receive the truth. They have to have known it to be able to reject it. Right. &gt;&gt; You have to He says you have to receive to reject truth before you can have an error. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's quite a statement. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before you can have an error. &gt;&gt; And just think about the how logical that is. You have to be able to to know what's going on. &gt;&gt; You have to have heard in your eyes. You you have to have had some sort of a revelation of something &gt;&gt; in order to then make an error. right &gt;&gt; to create an error. &gt;&gt; And we we I don't know about you, but when I received this message and I received what God is doing in our day, it was a revelation to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That totally changed my life. &gt;&gt; It changed my desires. It changed who I was. It changed who I wanted to be. &gt;&gt; And and um &gt;&gt; it it it called me to to live a higher life &gt;&gt; in knowing that that is obtainable. knowing that that is that is readily available for me. When I do not walk in it, &gt;&gt; I walk in error. &gt;&gt; If I just walked in sin and had never known anything, I would just be walking in sin. &gt;&gt; And matter of fact, it wouldn't even be sin because I didn't know the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you catch that. &gt;&gt; He goes on, he says, uh, uh, skipping down just a little bit, he says, "The church is ready. She's sealed in, ready to come. &gt;&gt; There will be a big outpouring of the spirit. Yes, sir. To grab that church and take her into the skies. &gt;&gt; And I tell you friends, that's what we are waiting on today. &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting on bombs to drop. I'm not waiting to see the the two witnesses arise in Israel. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I don't plan to be here. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of people get all nervous and worked up when they see the things happening in Israel. God's time piece and they they see the troubles and the calamities and the bonds falling and they're they're shaking and &gt;&gt; and and they're worried about it &gt;&gt; and it's like why why why would you worry about it? &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; If anything, it should make you more secure &gt;&gt; to know that you've been told that this would happen and you see it coming to pass. And I'm glad to be in this message, sealed into this, &gt;&gt; to be part of a prophetic people who has a prophetic word for this day. &gt;&gt; And no other age has had this. &gt;&gt; And you think about it, the the Reformation with with Luther and Wesley and that man age and uh the anointing that that extraordinary men were given like Charles Spurgeon and and uh Ian Bounds. If you've never read Ian Bounds on prayer, you're missing out. uh just so it's so powerful. It just convicts you where you sit. Charles Spurgeon, Dwight Moody, &gt;&gt; and they pulled such deep things out of the scripture &gt;&gt; just because of that that man intellect anointing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they they they taught us justification. They taught us sanctification. And they brought a word just on intellect that was so close &gt;&gt; Yeah. so close to being perfect that it took a prophet to come in our day to say this is correct. What this person said is correct. Larkin was correct right here. Spurgeon was correct here. Calvin was right. &gt;&gt; Armenianism. And we put all this together and it took a prophet to tell us &gt;&gt; this is the truth. &gt;&gt; That this is the truth. It's true. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we have been walking still in in in the the revelation of other ages. And I tell you, sometimes when you read them, like I I like I mentioned Ian Bounds, I read him and it's it's so difficult to struggle through and read. I grew up reading literature from the the turn of the century uh to the 1920s, 1930s, and it it it changed how I read from like modern articles and modern texts. it it's a different vocabulary and and even with that &gt;&gt; uh kind of a classical education, excuse me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I struggle to read what those ministers wrote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it and heaven help you if you ever go on YouTube and you and you try to listen to someone imitating Spurgeon's sermons and reading them out. You know, he wrote every word and then he would read them and and so we have those and people dramatize or dramatically read them &gt;&gt; and it's enough to make my my head melt. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't even know how to to to stand with them or to grasp what they're saying. It's just so complex and so dense. But what we have is the prophet coming and simplifying it. A man with a a third grade education from the hills of Kentucky coming and making it so plain and simple that this that the most humble among us can understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And I'm I'm grateful, you know, that in our in our time that we've seen these things, the the outpouring of the the Holy Spirit in the 1906 Isuza Street revival and how the gifts came back into the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and people began to prophesy and people were healed of of every kind of sickness of blindness and uh the dead were raised and and uh if you've never done it on YouTube there there are videos of people that were alive when that happened that they they they interviewed in the 1960s or 50s and they and they you listen to them talk about that experience that they had &gt;&gt; and it was so wonderful those gifts being restored but then the prophet came and said it's not just about the gifts. Come on. &gt;&gt; And the gifts are not the proof. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Because the gifts can be imitated. &gt;&gt; But he taught us that we have to focus on the word. &gt;&gt; And so now we here we are 100 years later. &gt;&gt; And some churches are so formal and cold that in in within our message ranks that you won't even stand up and and and speak in tongues. Right? &gt;&gt; People won't won't interpret or they won't they won't have a word from the Lord because they're too frightened of the gifts now that it might be out of order. You see, so we went from from no order to being so completely over this way that believers with the gift are even afraid to use it. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, my brother and my sister, that's wrong. It shouldn't be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's the things that we see. I I' I've been to message churches that literally and churches one church I won't I won't don't let me exaggerate there. One church that turned me away at the door when I went to go in that said they believed this message would not let me come in. &gt;&gt; Walked up to the door. Somebody opened the door, met me there. And I tell you, I I'll be I'll be so honest with you. This was so such a strange thing to me. So unbelievable that even looking back at it today, I wonder within myself, did I imagine that? &gt;&gt; Was that just a dream? How could that? How did that really happened? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it does. There there are places like that &gt;&gt; that say that they believe the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; But if you don't believe their interpretation of it, &gt;&gt; they don't want no fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that separates people. It's the message doesn't separate us. The word of God doesn't separate us. It's our interpretation of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. There there's people that interpret it this way and interpret it that way. And they've made little circles and denominations within our ranks that okay, well, if you see uh Peruia this way, there's a Peruia uh denomination. If you see two soul, then you have the two soul denomination. And if you see if you see thunders and you have the thunders denomination, it just goes on and on. You know, you have deity and and all kinds of different denominations within our ranks. And those interpretations are what separates us. &gt;&gt; And and my thing is is uh in my personality, I'm a peacemaker. I I I everywhere I go, I try to Brother Dale knows this for sure. I start talking to brother Dell and he's telling me different things. I'm like, well, we just need to get together with that brother. Let's have coffee. Let's iron this out. And and sometimes you could do that and sometimes you can't. But I'm a peacemaker. &gt;&gt; When I come to a place and there's troubles and things like that between brethren, I I it bothers me. It bothers my soul. I want things to be people to be united &gt;&gt; under this this banner of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have a you have an interpretation of something that is in the Bible or you have an interpretation of something that that God that that you think that God has revealed to you out of the out of the message, then praise the Lord. But if your interpretation of something causes you to reject everybody who doesn't believe it like you, &gt;&gt; there's something wrong with your revelation. &gt;&gt; If you can't f if you believe in thunders and you can't fellowship somebody that believes Peruia tells me your your thing in thunders might not be correct. &gt;&gt; And so we we we battle over our interpretation of what brother Brandham said. And I I I think that you know uh brother Brandham said it very clearly and the scripture tells us very clearly that that we will never in this day physically have us the spirit of the unity of faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon plainly said that the unity of faith will not be amongst the church until he comes &gt;&gt; until Jesus returns. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. He said, he said, once once he returns, all the little things that we thought were so important are not going to be very important at all. &gt;&gt; And and I'll tell you, there's going to be a lot of us who are embarrassed when he returns and we realize that we did not fellowship with a part of his body &gt;&gt; for years and years and decades and decades for no simp reason. &gt;&gt; We just ignored his body. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe if you have a a revelation from God, it ought to make you the most humble, kindest person there is, the most loving, dedicated to one another person there could be. &gt;&gt; To make you just like I'll just put it this way, to make you like brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; That to draw your circle bigger. &gt;&gt; You my brother, you I don't see it that way, but I love you no matter what. And it's okay. you know, we start talking about the things that we believe and we we um agree on and disagree on, there's going to it's doesn't matter who we are, it's going to pop up even within, you know, the the thunderous denomination when they start talking, they they start disagreeing on things, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; And it's okay because what brother Brandham said and what the Bible said is that we should be seeking a spirit of unity. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, not unity like we see in the world around us. I don't I I don't know if you're aware of this, but this is the the 1700th year 17 1,700 anniversary of the Council of Nika. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And this year, &gt;&gt; Wow. And just for you younger people that may not be aware of this, in in the council of Nika in 325 AD, the church got together, the Roman Catholic church. They brought all the churches together, &gt;&gt; all the pastors, all the preachers, and they all traveled to this this city of Nika in what's modern day Turkey. &gt;&gt; And they all decided this is what we believe &gt;&gt; and they said we believe that God is a trinity. We believe uh you know the the the pope is the vicer, the the very standin for Christ and they they they had this whole list of things that they believe disbelieve and how they would separate from like what Christianity had been a hundred years ago. And um this this year in October and November, the World Council of Churches, &gt;&gt; the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Orthodox Church are all meeting in the city of Nika. now the the city that is built over top of Na &gt;&gt; and they're all going to get together and they're going to have a big love feast &gt;&gt; and they're going to all tell each other how unified they are and how they all believe the same things &gt;&gt; and that there's no more splits and there's no more, you know, orthodoxy that everybody can be united under this great banner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. &gt;&gt; Which sounds very familiar to what somebody told us 40 and 50 years ago. Yes. &gt;&gt; Is happening today. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God is always God is a God of the I am. &gt;&gt; He's always moving in the present. &gt;&gt; And this is what I think it's so difficult sometimes to look and see what God is doing today. It's easy to look in the past and see what God did in the past. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To see where he moved and anointed someone and some great thing happened or a healing or or a dispensation happened. But it's difficult to see what God is doing today. &gt;&gt; And as believers, if we look and we see the World Council of Churches &gt;&gt; meeting with the Pope, &gt;&gt; the Roman Catholic Church &gt;&gt; and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Now, if you don't know, the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church are about as far away as the East is from the West, right? They've been fighting for uh 1,500 years, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And separated. &gt;&gt; And now they're coming back &gt;&gt; to be united again. &gt;&gt; And they're going to pray a prayer of reconciliation between the two. And they're going to hold hands and sing kumbaya. &gt;&gt; And you know, as a believer, I number one, I'm just like, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me at all." Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me that we have a pope that came out of America now in fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It does it doesn't make me frightened. It doesn't make me afraid. It shouldn't make you nervous. If anything, it should give you the utmost confidence in what we believe and what we have been told. That is right, that is true, that we are on the right path, that our footsteps are ordained by the Lord. And it should give us peace and give us rest in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says in Jehovah Gyra uh number three 1964 he says he he's praying and he says our heavenly father we're are grateful tonight to have this privilege of assembling together in the name of the Lord Jesus to worship him in the spirit of his resurrection and we're so grateful to you for what you have already done for us identifying what he has done by identifying yourself by the word among us and by the resurrection and now our heart our hopes are built so high Lord because We know that that the God we serve is not some historical God, but a present tense God. &gt;&gt; We don't serve a God of 2,000 years ago. We serve the We serve a God of today who is able to do the exact same things today that he did 2,000 years ago. And the bondage that that was upon you that you felt that you were delivered from and the things that you kept being in bondage to, he is here to deliver you this morning if you should accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To let go of it. He says he says our our hopes are built so high because we know that the God we serve is not some historical God but a present tense God. The one that's raised from the dead. Not Lazarus, &gt;&gt; not the saints of the Old Testament. But in our generation, we have seen people raised from the dead &gt;&gt; that were clinically declared dead that God has raised up and restored life to children, old men. &gt;&gt; It's just happened as a fact. Science can't explain, but the word of God can explain. &gt;&gt; The spirit that would that is within us is able to testify to it and believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's proved himself &gt;&gt; that he was the God that was with Moses, with Abraham, and all the apostles, and still is the same God. And he is still the same God today. &gt;&gt; 1965 was a long time ago. &gt;&gt; I I I wasn't alive then. Some of you were. Some of you were babies and and maybe some of you were old then. I don't know. But uh &gt;&gt; thank you, sister Lee. Now, sometimes I get a little intense, so I try to try to sprinkle in a little humor &gt;&gt; just to what what's they say in uh oh, what's that old movie? Mary Poppins. A spoonful of sugar makes go down. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's hard to be mad at somebody when you're laughing at them. &gt;&gt; First John 1, it says this, and we're all we're all familiar with this scripture. If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. &gt;&gt; So, first of all, if we walk, &gt;&gt; if we walk, so that means no standing still. &gt;&gt; All right? It doesn't mean walking in the other direction. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean turning back and walking away from things. But if we walk, if we move, you have to be alive to move. &gt;&gt; You have to be alive to walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to been reborn, born again &gt;&gt; and changed to be able to walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the light. &gt;&gt; And God is light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; And so the light moves throughout ages, throughout time. We've seen it where he would when Jesus Christ was here on earth. He was the light and then it went the light moved into the apostles and the light moved into the body of Christ into the church. And throughout the ages, the the true believer has always been the torchbearer of his light. &gt;&gt; We have to walk in the light as he is in the light. And so if we just rely on the things that were said by those great men of old such as Wesley and Luther and the the reformers and the the different men, if we rely solely on that, we're living on food from a prior day. &gt;&gt; Why is it that we can't do that with what men said? &gt;&gt; But we can do it with what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible is timeless and ageless. It does not change. It's perfect in every way. &gt;&gt; It it it the culture can change. Our communities can change. Our world can change. But the the word of God never changes. It is always right on time. It is always relevant. It is always important to our lives. The things that we say as men can fail and pass away. I can make a mistake. I can slip up. I can say the wrong thing. I can quote the wrong quote. I can I can say this scripture is this, you know, and have the wrong scripture and and I can make a mistake. But the word of God will never make a mistake. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if we walk then as in the light as he is in the light as we see him moving and doing and and uh creating uh uh adding on to his book &gt;&gt; of acts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We walk in that light. &gt;&gt; And then what's it say? So we have fellowship one with another. That's not even fellowship with God &gt;&gt; directly where we commune with God. That's a one-on-one relationship. But then what it what it says is we have fellowship one with another. &gt;&gt; Now that's not fellowship with the carnal John or the carnal brother Dale or the carnal brother Mike &gt;&gt; or or sister Ruth. That is fellowship with the God within them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you catch that? That we we're not fellowshipping with one another. &gt;&gt; We come here to be free, but it's not free just to Yes. Getting to know one another is the perk and the the pleasure to to to learn about one another's lives and your stories and where you came from and where you've been and how you how you got to where you are today. But the real pleasure is to see the God within you &gt;&gt; and ministering to to me and ministering to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have fellowship one one another and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But do you see that there's there there are things that happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's an order to things &gt;&gt; as put into scripture. &gt;&gt; Walk in the light &gt;&gt; as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Meaning the present day truth of what's been revealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then we have fellowship with the God within one another. &gt;&gt; And then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we're not walking in the light, if we're not walking, if we're not walking in the light as he is in the light, if we're not fellowshipping with the God within the bride, right? &gt;&gt; The God within one another, &gt;&gt; then is the blood of Jesus Christ there to cleanse us from all our sin? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll leave that up to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See what I can skip here. I got about just a little bit more time. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Is everyone with me? &gt;&gt; You know, I I can't be brother Junior. &gt;&gt; And I can't I can't be brother Bartley and I can't be brother John Denqua or or Brother Jose. You know, I'm just me and what you see is what you get. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I was thinking about uh you know, my generation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, my gener I was born in in the in 78 and so uh I wasn't alive when brother Brandon was here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you know, my family as they started to be coming in into touch with the things that surround the message of the hour. I was exposed to things that were just completely insane to me. &gt;&gt; People worshiping Brother Brandham, people praying to brother Brandham, people praying to his sons. I I I I sat in a church once in Arizona and listened as the opening prayer as the the I don't know if it if he was the pastor or not. I really don't remember. I was so I was so uh overwhelmed by what I was hearing that I couldn't hardly concentrate as I prayed, you know, uh God, we love you so much and we love your sons, Billy Paul and and brother Joseph. And and my mind at that point just just kind of melted and froze. Am I hearing the things that I'm hearing? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And those things are among us, &gt;&gt; but I didn't see Brother Brandham with my own eyes. &gt;&gt; I didn't see the the the things that he testified on, the things that we hear on the tapes, the the great healing campaigns &gt;&gt; that that the the visions and the the prophecies. I didn't see those come forth under the pool pit. I you know I wasn't I wasn't blessed to live in that day. &gt;&gt; But I'm reminded of a scripture. Now let me ask you this. Were any of you ever in brother Brandham's meetings? &gt;&gt; Not a one of us. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; Not one of us. &gt;&gt; Not one of us was ever under that anointing that came under that prophet. &gt;&gt; Think about that for just a moment. &gt;&gt; He was a forerunner. &gt;&gt; But here we are. &gt;&gt; And and and sometimes I I feel like Thomas the apostle &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "Blessed are you or blessed are they who have not seen so believe." But you know, I think I think Thomas gets a little bit of a bad rap actually. &gt;&gt; I really do. You know, Thomas was the one that just a few days before when they were all the disciples were afraid that Jesus was going to go someplace and and they knew that the disciples knew if he goes there, they're going to capture him. They're going to kill him. And so they were like they were all arguing and fearful and frightened and fighting amongst themselves of what they should do. Should we keep him from going and and Thomas was the one that rose up and said, you know, well, if let's go die with him. &gt;&gt; If he's going to go there to die, then let's just go die with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't stop to me about it that uh Thomas was a an unbeliever or disbeliever or unfaithful. &gt;&gt; You know, as a matter of fact, you know what I think? This is just me. You can feel free to disagree with me, but I think I think a couple of those preachers got together and they kind of had it out for Thomas. &gt;&gt; Maybe they didn't quite like him so much and they gave his they gave his testimony just a little bit of a twist. &gt;&gt; Now that I'm not saying what what what happened didn't happen, &gt;&gt; but I'm saying it's written in such a way that it gives you the impression that Thomas was a doubter all the time. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you a story about Thomas. &gt;&gt; India. &gt;&gt; Thomas went to India. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I've told this before because I love telling this. So, &gt;&gt; if you know the story, you just bear with me because I know I know some of us have not heard this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All we've ever heard was Thomas is a doubting Thomas who put his fingers into the the the sight of the Lord. But, you know, when when he did that, &gt;&gt; Thomas had a declaration. What did he say? &gt;&gt; My Lord and my God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Now Peter's revelation was Peter's revelation, thou art the Christ, the anointed one, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But when Thomas revelation came, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; it was you are my Lord, my Elohim &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; and my God, Jehovah &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the revelation &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ was Jehovah God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Godhead, the oneness right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I think Thomas, like I said, I think he gets a little bit of a bad rap, but he went to India. They drove him out, you know, from the church there in Jerusalem and he left and he went to India and he was an architect. &gt;&gt; And Thomas still has a a wonderful testimony even today in India. He went to a certain place and he was going he was uh commissioned to build a palace for a king there. And so he began to to work and he's instructing the the laborers on how to do it do things. And he begins to testify of the things that he had saw in the ministry of Jesus Christ. And people began to believe his ministry. They began to believe on Jesus Christ. Well, in India, I know some of brother uh is from India and they they believe in many gods, &gt;&gt; many many gods. And so the king became very upset with with be uh with Thomas and confronted him and said, "What is this that you're teaching?" And Thomas, you know, explained it to him. And you know uh the story is that they were down there was a river right there and and they were down by the river and Thomas is witnessing to the king and he says and the king finally says fed up as your God is so great then then take a bucket of water and throw it up in the in the air and the water won't come back down. &gt;&gt; Thomas takes the bucket, scoops it into the river, throws the ri the bucket the water up into the air. Not only does the water stay suspended in the air, but the hole in the river from the bucket made is still there. &gt;&gt; Now that's faith. &gt;&gt; That's belief. &gt;&gt; That's not doubt. &gt;&gt; And even today, Thomas is revered. There's a church there. He's known as the founder of Christianity in India. And matter of fact, when the uh when the Constantine, I believe it was, the Roman Catholic Church uh was building their their tomb of the apostles. Boy, that's a long story. I'd love to get into it, but we don't have time. But they went and they sent for the bones the body of Thomas in India. And the the people of India said, "You can have his body, but you can't have his heart." &gt;&gt; That's right. and they kept his heart there in India and they sent his bones there to uh to the Catholic church. That's the testimony of Thomas. I I'll be honest, he's a little bit of a hero to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that that he was he's really kind of misunderstood. &gt;&gt; But he was the first to have that revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. &gt;&gt; You know what, brother Random taught us that in every generation, he adds a new part to his book. And I say that and I and at the same time I tell you that there is no eighth day messenger coming. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is no new revelation of God coming. &gt;&gt; There's no one coming to pick up the torch of of of a prophet and carry us forward into a rapture. Everything that has has been to be revealed has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we're what we are doing is is falling more in love with Jesus. said, "We're," Brother Brandham said it this way in the token. He said, "We're we we're keeping the lamb up. &gt;&gt; We're watching the lamb. We're watching the word to see if there's any blemish in it, any fault in it." &gt;&gt; And we haven't seen that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. We've seen a man be a man, but we've seen no fault in the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me skip just a little bit here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the rapture 1965, brother Brando says, "But to the church, the bride, the rapture is a revelation to her. &gt;&gt; It's revealed to her that the revelation, the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture." &gt;&gt; Now, it is a revelation for the revelation is faith. You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. And faith is a revelation because it's something that has been revealed to you. Right. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation. And the rapture that we are all looking for &gt;&gt; is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's one one of the reasons why I thematically preach on who you are as the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because once we get a revelation of who we are in him, &gt;&gt; who our brother and sister are in him, &gt;&gt; then this then we're going to finally be able to unite together. We're going to finally be able to unite and the things that we disagree with are are are going to be so insignificant &gt;&gt; that heaven help us. Can you imagine that that Jesus Christ is here and your brother and sister and they believe just a little bit differently than you do on a minor thing and you won't fellowship with the God within them? &gt;&gt; How can you have forgiveness of sin? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm But we we we are unique in that we had a prophet come and he told us things that were to pass. &gt;&gt; Right. He told us about uh the the things that would happen with Hitler and Mussolini and the invasion of Ethiopia. He told us about uh the Nazism and fascism being rolled up into communism. He told us about uh a driverless car &gt;&gt; that would come. And he he said this in the 1930s when a driverless car was was just a a thought of science fiction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And now here we have it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Today you can get into a a a cab in in a city and take a ride from one end of the city to the other, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Without a driver, &gt;&gt; you can get a car. You can buy a car online and the car will drive itself to your driveway &gt;&gt; and park it for you. &gt;&gt; Tell me that has not been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Is the script do we agree that the scriptur has been fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. are or the prophecy has been fulfilled. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; It has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And people say, "Well, we're we're this is this is a a a peculiar one to me and and I'm closing down and winding down. I only have 10 more pages to go." You know, in in uh several several a couple years ago, we saw Hillary Clinton running for president, &gt;&gt; and people were convinced that this would be the woman that would rise. Brother Brandon prophesied that a a woman would come to power, a woman or a church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He prophesied this in 1933 in America that uh would take over, that she would be beautiful to look at, but cruelhearted, purple, clothes in purple now. And so we thought, well, uh, you know, and I I remember brother Perry Green, brother Perry Green thought might it might even be Oprah Winfrey and he speculated it could be, uh, Hillary Clinton and then we speculated that it could be Kla Harris. But brother Brandham also said this in letting off the pressure. &gt;&gt; Okay. About this, he's talking about it and he says she is sitting right here on the throne today in this country. He &gt;&gt; says so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, sir. the woman that he prophesied about is sitting on the throne. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says in another place and so he's identifying it that it is not a woman, &gt;&gt; not a physical woman, you know. No, I'm sorry. It's not. He says he goes on and I don't know why we we skip over this when we read when we read about this prophecy. He says he said permitting the woman to vote and in doing so they would elect the wrong president. Now, before any of you who are feminists uh become very upset at me for saying women shouldn't vote, when women got the vote, since then there's been 94 million abortions in America. &gt;&gt; 94 million babies killed. &gt;&gt; That would never have happened without the catering to a woman's vote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; It says in doing so, they would elect the wrong president. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said um he he goes on he says and in this would become a woman stand up not not the president but he said in this electing the wrong president and and allowing a woman to vote and in this a woman would stand up that would govern the United States and I'm quoting not actually a woman but a church &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and then I seen her with nothing but ashes. &gt;&gt; Not a woman but a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. And today in America, the Roman Catholic Church is embedded in every level of our government. &gt;&gt; Our Supreme Court justices are Catholic. &gt;&gt; Our heads of cabinets and leaders and in the highest echelons are govern predominantly Catholic. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Their allegiance is not to the United States of America. &gt;&gt; Their first allegiance is to the church. It's not even to allegiance to God. It's allegiance to their church and the pope. &gt;&gt; Churchmen movement. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. but to recognize where we are. &gt;&gt; And there are people that are still, and if you disagree with me, it's fine. I understand if you disagree with me, &gt;&gt; but there are people that are that are waiting for a woman to be elected in America. And I said, hey, a woman may be elected in America. She might even come to the podium clothed in purple. Praise praise the Lord. That looks real fine. &gt;&gt; But the prophecy has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It's already done. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so, and so what's left for us, the bride, before we we take a rapture, &gt;&gt; not much. &gt;&gt; Not much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's recognizing who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's recognizing that we can do the greater work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, if I if I start seeing bombs fall or an earthquake happen in California slide into the sea, &gt;&gt; I I'm going to be a little bit worried about my condition. &gt;&gt; Correct. Because then then I know that I'm getting ready to go through something very terrible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through &gt;&gt; here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only thing left for us is to take a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the last person to come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Well, the last person's got to come in and they got to be positionally placed and they've got to be, you know, filled with the Holy Spirit and they've got to learn everything within the message and they've got to learn all the prophecies and these things of the Bible." But I'm telling you that is incorrect. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; A baby eagle is born eating meat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They can from the very moment they hatch out of the shell, the mama eagle is given that baby need. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When that last one comes in, they're not going to need the full revelation of everything. They're not going to need a complete understanding of everything. They're going to have to know the God that that they are going to walk in the light as he is in the light. And once they've done that, they have forgiveness for their sin. They've been restored, brought back, redeemed, replaced, sanctified, and we're taking a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So until then, we're just planting our potatoes and living &gt;&gt; as if he's coming tomorrow, but planning as if he's not coming for another hundred years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Lord, &gt;&gt; there's a church that believes that. That's waking up to who she is &gt;&gt; to becoming an invincible army. &gt;&gt; That's a people who don't stop at salvation, who don't stop with justification, who don't stop with sanctification, &gt;&gt; doesn't stop with the restoring of the gifts, &gt;&gt; doesn't even stop with the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; on their flesh. &gt;&gt; How many people know that that you can be anointed of the Holy Ghost on your flesh and it never gets into your soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when brother Brandham says you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life &gt;&gt; and still go to hell, he's not talking about it in the soul. He's talking about being baptled in the Holy Spirit in your flesh, &gt;&gt; but not in your soul. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I believe that there's a people today that can live the Pentecost upper room life. &gt;&gt; That there's a people today that's not afraid to speak in tongues and interpret. that there's a people today is not afraid to stand up and prophesy &gt;&gt; to acknowledge what God is doing in this hour to walk in the light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that we have a church that has been fulfilled &gt;&gt; uh by the word of God that is fulfilling the word of God and is manifesting. What we are waiting on today is is what the scripture says the manifestations of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we have been manifested, when the last one has been manifested, we're going to take a rapture and there's going to be a change. Amen. &gt;&gt; And until then, we're in a battle to lay aside all the chains of sin and chains of bitterness and angriness and things that we've allowed to carry ourselves to carry away from the cross &gt;&gt; until we let him go and manifest who you are in him &gt;&gt; to manifest the life of Jesus Christ that he said would be in the believer. That's what we're waiting on today. &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry that some of you are waiting on me and I'm sorry that I'm waiting on some of you, but we're going to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. until until we do and we believe everything exactly all right. I just want to have spirit of unity with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. To to fellowship with the God within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I hope today that you can recognize who you are &gt;&gt; to know that that if you're seeing the smallest part of what the prophet told us &gt;&gt; that there is something inside you. There's going to ignite a hunger within you, young person, that that's set every day on a uh born into this message &gt;&gt; and you've never even seen it and you're you're believe it because your parents believe it. When you get into it for yourself as a teenager, 18, 19 years old, and you start examining the word of God for yourself and identifying and say, "Yeah, that really is true. I really believe that. That speaks to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be the last one. &gt;&gt; You may be the last one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You are now the sons of God. &gt;&gt; And it does not yet appear what you shall be. But you, we know that when he appears, we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll receive a body like him. &gt;&gt; Beautiful Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; I praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful for to to him for everything that he's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. and what he continues to do as we walk in the light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Because I see him in my life. &gt;&gt; I see him. I see that my desires are no longer the desires of of 20 or 30 years ago. &gt;&gt; I see that my desires for things have changed. &gt;&gt; You know, and and I I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free that that that that all things are lawful, but not all things are expedient. &gt;&gt; That that I don't have to worry about sending away my day of grace. I don't have to worry about blaspheming the Holy Spirit. That I can I can be free to worship. I can be free to praise God. I can be free to be a husband, a real husband to my wife, a real father to my children to lead them and guide them in the truth that God has given in this hour. And so can you today &gt;&gt; if you'll only believe, &gt;&gt; if you'll cast aside the things that you've been carrying for far too long, &gt;&gt; the bitterness, the tears &gt;&gt; of the past. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And to let him go &gt;&gt; and just lay him at the cross once again. &gt;&gt; And I think of it like this. It's just you walked away from it. You were so excited, but you still carried some of those chains and you take a couple steps now and it's a couple years later now some of us &gt;&gt; and we just turn right back and go right back to the cross &gt;&gt; and we just take those chains off. We say, "Lord, sorry. Forgot about this. That's yours, too." &gt;&gt; And we can just walk away from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen.
