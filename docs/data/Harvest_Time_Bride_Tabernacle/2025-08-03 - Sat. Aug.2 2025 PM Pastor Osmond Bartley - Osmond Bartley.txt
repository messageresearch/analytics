I speak Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. about four years ago. God delivered me of a stronghold, a mental stronghold. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into the whole uh deliverance. I've actually got like a little YouTube video that we did of it, and if you want to just just ask me for it. But um but I just want to let you know that if you're dealing with any sort of mental struggles, anything that's like saying just has you bound mentally and &gt;&gt; you can't seem to break free of it that God knows and he &gt;&gt; will bring a day of deliverance for you &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; in a way sometimes that you just never even imagined and in a way that you never thought possible and he'll bring the answers you seek. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then from that day on, it'll never be the same. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; in my deliverance, the biggest thing that I came away with is that God cares so much. &gt;&gt; I think Satan to think that we're not alone and he doesn't see us and that he doesn't hear our cries &gt;&gt; and that he doesn't care about us personally. &gt;&gt; But he does. &gt;&gt; He does. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he showed me in such a beautiful way that it was just like &gt;&gt; such an intimate love that he showed me. &gt;&gt; And the words of this song kind of reflect that, you know, that &gt;&gt; he's there no matter where I go, no matter what I go through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows me more than anybody else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even myself words from the song. May it lift your heart and may be encouraged tonight. &gt;&gt; I'll never drift from your loving care. There's not a me. The winds of the morning will lift me to you. The blackest of nights, your light will shine through. You're already there. No matter where I go. Even before I came to thee, your loving eyes were looking at me. You're even closer than the very breath that I take. Mother and father more than a friend to me. Beginning and living and ending of life to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The song I find myself singing when I awake. So I will praise. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I praise you. Now I praise you for lifting me up and giving me wings. For keeping my eyes on heavenly things. &gt;&gt; For being the song that I can't help but sing. Praise you. Look at me Lord. I'm open to you. do anything that you want to do. For you know me even better than I know myself. I'll not be afraid of what you might see because you know the inside of me. &gt;&gt; I'll not even try to hide what you know so well. Lord, just be patient with my mistakes. I want to be yours, whatever it takes. For I've learned that life without you is no life at all. &gt;&gt; Failures and talents and schemes I bring to you. Aspirations and dreams I leave to you. I'll just be here ready whenever you call. So I will praise you &gt;&gt; Lord. I praise you now. I'll praise you for lifting me up and giving me wings. For keeping my eyes on heavenly things. For being the song that I can't help but sing. praise you. Sing it with me. So I will praise you, Lord. I praise you now. I praise you for lifting me up and giving me wings. for being the song that I can't help but sing. Praise you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Back there. Come on up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And aren't you blessed in Jesus glad to be in his presence tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Have a few more specials than normal, but that's all right. &gt;&gt; It's all right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you, Jesus. Thank you for the blood. Amen. It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; So there's just I just want to give you a quick testimony of that song. One time um I was sang that song at church and I didn't know at the time that God would deal with me with in a special way. And I didn't even know that day that I was still holding grudges over somebody. &gt;&gt; And while I was singing, the song says, um, you have washed me white. And every time I sing the chorus, it was like, you have washed me white. And then he's like, yes, Julie, I've washed you white. Then the next time I sing, you have washed me white. Then it says, yes, I've also w washed white. that person &gt;&gt; and I'm like okay where you going with this and then I sing again you have washed me white and then it says but you haven't &gt;&gt; and but like I mean I cannot pay for her sins right &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; but God did I had to forgive this person &gt;&gt; and then at that moment I my heart was so full of love for this person it's not my love &gt;&gt; at all the person does not deserve it. &gt;&gt; But you know cuz the person is a human just like I am &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; but it just filled my heart with so much love for this person &gt;&gt; and I mean I just cried and worshiped God and from that moment and then I wrote to the person I said you know what this happened at church and I forgive you please can you forgive me and it's just so beautiful the way God And I had a sister that had actually told me, she said, "Julie, the symptoms are coming back." Like because I had been sick for a few years in 2018, but and those symptoms were coming back. And we were ch chatting about like all the holistic way of things we can do to heal. And at the end of our conversation, she said, and then I ended up saying, "You know what? I do feel a grudge for this person." And she said, "You know, Julie, that could be why the symptoms are coming back in your life right now because of that grudge." &gt;&gt; And then few months later, then in my heart that night, I was like, "Oh yeah, forgive her." But no, God had another way for me to truly experience his love for that person. And since I that happened in church I my symptoms I have not had any symptoms &gt;&gt; because many times you know our healing you know many times Jesus would say your for your forgiveness earned you know I give you forgiveness and then you're healed because it's attached sir anyway. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was a wretch. I remember who I was. I was lost. I was blind. I was running out of time. Sin separated. The bridge was far too wide. From the far side of the chasm, you held me in your sight. So you made a way across the great divine left behind heaven's throne to build it here inside. And there at the cross, you paid the debt I owed. &gt;&gt; Break broke my chain, freed my soul. For the first time I had hope. Thank you Jesus for the blood of light. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. [Music] Br me from the darkness into glorious light. You took my place, laid inside my tomb of sin. You were buried for three days, but then you walked right out again. Now death has no sting &gt;&gt; and life has no end for I have been transformed &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb. Thank you Jesus for the blood. Thank you Jesus. He has washed me white. Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. Brought me from the darkness into glorious light. Thank you Jesus for the blood and the blood. Thank you Jesus. He has washed me white. Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. Br me from the darkness into glorious light. Glory to his name.

You know, I used to do that when I was in the world when I went to sports. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'd go to a big theater and I'd pay all my tithe $100 and take my binoculars to see somebody down in the field.

Right. &gt;&gt; We're going to believe a prodigal son coming home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; We're going to believe a backsliding daughter &gt;&gt; is coming back to Christ. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We're going to believe that a backsliding son is going to repent tonight. Just as though I believe that I I'm I'm going to make it to glory, &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe that my neighbor is going to make it. &gt;&gt; I'm using that same belief. &gt;&gt; I believe that God forgive me. &gt;&gt; I'm using that same belief. &gt;&gt; When I met Ronda and Ken and I talked to them and is did I pronounce it right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the spirit says, "I didn't meet these two people in coincidence. &gt;&gt; I believe predestination." &gt;&gt; When I listen to them and Ronda sharing her testimony and Ken openly &gt;&gt; talking of his a little synopsis of his past and &gt;&gt; and I said to Ronda, I said, "All that you're being through, God was forging you &gt;&gt; to be who you are today." and &gt;&gt; I stand as &gt;&gt; I'm going to see you on the other side. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Believe with me. &gt;&gt; Can you believe with me, brother? &gt;&gt; I'm going to see you on the other side.

You can love me in a prison [Music] &gt;&gt; and throw &gt;&gt; away the keep. Take away my vision from desires that now can see. Deprive me of the food I eat. And even bow my head and feet. But as long as I know Jesus, [Music] I could still go free. [Music] He said that I could still go free. &gt;&gt; What kind of a man would reach down his end and do this for me? [Applause] I'm so unworthy to live and not fit to keep. But the man on the cross had my name in his will. He said that I could still go free. My name could quite understand why he would leave his home. Glory. Hallelujah. [Music] And too late to try alone some pad and feel pain and flesh. Flesh and bone. [Music] Jesus that leads to Calary.

Tell me what kind of a man [Music] and reach down is it and do this for me. I'm so unworthy to live and I'm not fit to keep but the man on the cross and my name in his will. He said that I I could still go free. Yes. He said that I could still go free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What kind of a man who would reach down his hand and do this for me? I'm so unworthy to live and I've nothing to give. But the man on the ground. I said the man on the cross. The made of the cross. Yes. The cross. He had my name in his will.

Not going through all of it because even the very smallest of the child know what this is about. Then Martha, as soon as you heard that Jesus was coming, John 11 from verse 20, he went and met him. But Mary, stay sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hast been here, my brother had not died. But I know. Very interesting.

Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lord, by this time he stinkketh. &gt;&gt; You just said, &gt;&gt; you believe. &gt;&gt; You believe. &gt;&gt; You just said, "I know that even now whatever you ask God for will give it to you." &gt;&gt; You just said that. We sing the song Only Believe All Things Are Possible. We love that song. Is it right? &gt;&gt; But now you're saying, "Lord, by this time he's staying, for he had been dead four days." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jes said Jesus said unto her. &gt;&gt; In other words, said not unto thee, if you would believe, &gt;&gt; if you believe, you would see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all I was saying. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Bless you Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a time when your belief carries more power than the volume of your knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sometime your knowledge is so much that it can become stagnated. &gt;&gt; Amen. and all it produces is still dirt &gt;&gt; and wrapped you in a package called religion and no relationship. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We can talk tonight and you know when you hear that song only believe &gt;&gt; that's not just a song &gt;&gt; that's a message to us. &gt;&gt; It's a message. Yeah, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; if we can just believe. &gt;&gt; Just believe. &gt;&gt; Just believe. A testimony and a sister in our church was diagnosed with stage four cancer. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; never raised in the message. Know nothing about the message. She just come and wanted a church to go to in the community. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. and and she came and she said, "And you know how we attract her?" I learned she was in the hospital, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; Cuz her daughter come to church and I said to brother Junior's wife who said, "Buy her a bouquet and bring it to her and tell her we love her." &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. There you go. &gt;&gt; Brother John by just expressing her with love. &gt;&gt; She said, "Oh my God, &gt;&gt; what a love." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then she came, she says, "I want this church to be my church." &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Kindness. &gt;&gt; Kindness. Love. &gt;&gt; That's who we are. &gt;&gt; That's who the bride is made up. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; Because God is love &gt;&gt; and Christ was love. And his love &gt;&gt; and all that Christ was, he poured into the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are who God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After stage four cancer, &gt;&gt; then after running and running, we prayed and we prayed and we believe God &gt;&gt; that the same God of Elijah is here. &gt;&gt; The same God that was here is still here. &gt;&gt; The same God that walked with the prophet is still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And the last days doctor says, "Where is the cancer? &gt;&gt; Where is it? It's not there anymore. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can I preach on this? The power that our belief carries." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many can relate to us that when we were children, we we love God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We grew up in church loving God, but we never fear God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We didn't even believe much in God. We just actually we fear the church more than how we fear God. &gt;&gt; And when we do things as teenagers, we hide from church. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not realizing, brother John, we couldn't hide from God. We didn't even know we &gt;&gt; hid from the pastor. We hid from the church members. &gt;&gt; But we we never fear God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the word of God says in Proverbs chapter 1:7, the fear of God begins with knowledge. &gt;&gt; So now that we are being exposed to the true revelation of who God is, now fear begins. &gt;&gt; We are knowing who God is. &gt;&gt; Not that he was &gt;&gt; but who God is. &gt;&gt; But understanding that he's a God of a history. He's your present tense. &gt;&gt; That's why we know how to fear God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what increases our belief. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The word of God says faith come by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing the word of God. So your faith increases the more you hear the word. &gt;&gt; But then understanding is what increases your belief. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's why G you remember that Jesus said that in Matthew chapter uh 13 verse 23 when he talk about the good soil and the good ground. He said they that hear the word and understand it, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; are those I am in call the good ground that the seed falls on &gt;&gt; and bear fruit and much fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some 100 and some 60. &gt;&gt; Is that right saints? &gt;&gt; So our understanding is very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something straight uh &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; inspired me and to speak on this when I hear the men of God preached last night. Listen this expressing or putting forth your belief. &gt;&gt; If you love me &gt;&gt; believe that I the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you care for me, believe that I'm the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same belief that you have for yourself, &gt;&gt; you can believe it for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When I listen to a young man that walk away from the word, &gt;&gt; no one saw a message from him who stop believing in God. &gt;&gt; And sometime it's not that they walk away from God, they walk away from church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And we misunderstand that. Walk away. And some of us are so judgmental that we write them off. &gt;&gt; Because they go to hell. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; But I express belief. &gt;&gt; I put forth my belief in them. &gt;&gt; When I said, "I believe you're going to make it. &gt;&gt; I believe you're going to be saved." Come on. &gt;&gt; So listen, the prophet of God says and you know listen what the prophet of God said in the message influence 1964. Listen this carefully. &gt;&gt; He had a he had a service &gt;&gt; and at the end of the service he was calling the prayer line and calling &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; butsliders. And this is a church. He says is there a backslider here that would come? &gt;&gt; Mhm. I am asking you as a servant of Christ if you will walk down here let us pray with you listen this carefully &gt;&gt; I don't say he will take you back &gt;&gt; but I believe he will &gt;&gt; believe Hallelujah &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you pick that up? &gt;&gt; Come back slers. &gt;&gt; I I'm not saying God will take you back. &gt;&gt; But he said I believe he will. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That hit my heart, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; He's not looking at their condition. &gt;&gt; The prophet putting his belief out. &gt;&gt; I believe God will take you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe you will be saved. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I believe what you done, God will forgive you. &gt;&gt; I believe that no matter how far you go, God's arms are still open to receive you. &gt;&gt; I believe you can be if you become brother God, you are still a son of God. I believe hallelujah that no matter how far your children goes they are saved &gt;&gt; with the same faith and shame &gt;&gt; you can project your life on the line I heard the brother said that laid on your life for your brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; very good &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; glory to God without faith &gt;&gt; it is impossible to please God Yes. &gt;&gt; Yet our faith, you should faith increases as we hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're in a condition that faith can take you so far, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But what brings you further? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is not something to brag and boast about, &gt;&gt; but it's purpose. &gt;&gt; It's purpose. None of us were. Amen. My brothers and sisters, we never put purpose within ourselves. &gt;&gt; We were created with purpose. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith, oh, hallelujah. Amen. Can bring you to a level, but it is purpose that prevents you from being destroyed. &gt;&gt; Glory. It's not no longer in the message &gt;&gt; that prevents you from being destroyed. It's purpose. &gt;&gt; Nothing can destroy purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you travel all these hundreds and hundreds of miles, amen, to be here in the service. Why? There's a purpose there. &gt;&gt; That picked up that frequency from glory. &gt;&gt; And when your purpose picks up that frequency, Amen. You tell yourself, "Where am I going? Why am I going to Canada? Oh, who am I going to see? Who are these people?" It was purpose responding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To that voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why am I singing? Oh, you never came together because you love each other. God purpose. &gt;&gt; He wrote the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wrote the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as he turned the pages, &gt;&gt; you are just manifesting his mind. &gt;&gt; I never wrote the pages. He wrote it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Faith may not prevent them from truly the lion's den, &gt;&gt; but purpose close the mouth of the lion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Glory &gt;&gt; to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He's right to God. &gt;&gt; Purpose. &gt;&gt; Let's go further. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Faith may not stop the rain, &gt;&gt; but purpose prevents or provides an umbrella for your shelter. &gt;&gt; Because purpose is projecting. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see the tree boys &gt;&gt; approached the fire of furnace &gt;&gt; with an open mind. &gt;&gt; They did about it. &gt;&gt; They did. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You heard what I just said. &gt;&gt; Brother John. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They approached the fire with an open mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find a scripture here. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let us be in the spirit of Christ &gt;&gt; so that we can have Christ. &gt;&gt; Let us be in the spirit of repentance. &gt;&gt; Then we're going to have repentance. &gt;&gt; Let us be in the spirit of faith.

All creation knows when the son of God is on the scene. &gt;&gt; Creation has been waiting for this day. &gt;&gt; When the sons of God are manifested, the prophet said, "No other day but this day, &gt;&gt; the sons of God are here." &gt;&gt; Amen. We haven't had rain for a while. Amen. But turn the pipe off in the stand pipe where we truck water. And that Sunday morning before church, I walk up to the coin. And those poor little coins, they bow their heads and in despair and begging for water. And my &gt;&gt; I walk up to the little coin and passing it. &gt;&gt; And I said, "I'm sorry, you know, Brother John." I said, "I'm sorry, &gt;&gt; but just hold on a little bit more. &gt;&gt; Rain is coming." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rain is coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

That does not give you a crown or a score on your shoulder. We're talking about putting what you know in action. You only believe and let the things come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I spoke to brother Dale and I told him, "Brother D, husband, don't worry yourself." He said, "I'm here praying for some rain." My mom, we got a shower. And by Tuesday, another shower. Oh, I saw the leaves of those corn just praising the Lord because there's a believer that the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; There was a believer that called the rain. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He never give me a word of uncertainty. &gt;&gt; He said, I'm praying for rain. &gt;&gt; Woo God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "He that believe, he that hear my word," John 5:24, &gt;&gt; "He that hear my word &gt;&gt; and believe on him that sent me &gt;&gt; pass from death to life &gt;&gt; cannot come in condemnation. &gt;&gt; So believe shift your dimension." &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Believe. Shift your dimension. &gt;&gt; So here &gt;&gt; we receive it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

Yes. &gt;&gt; Did he said that? &gt;&gt; Yes. He said so. &gt;&gt; It's for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So heard Jesus go down and ma Amen. Met him and she said, "Lord, Amen. Oh, we know you're a healer &gt;&gt; because if you were here, you wouldn't die cuz you would have healed him." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, the glory of God cannot be confined within a religion. &gt;&gt; No. No. Glory. &gt;&gt; No. No. The glory of God is much wider than holy little knowledge of &gt;&gt; glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus delayed four days. He knew he was is God. &gt;&gt; He knows it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he was on time. &gt;&gt; This was not about the resurrection of Lazarus. &gt;&gt; This was about the manifestation of God's good. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. His sickness is on the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to look at the glory of God shortly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; She said, "No, Lord, I I know if you were here, my brother would not have died." Now, we believe in God as a healer, but what about him being the resurrector? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What about him being the resurrection? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about him being the life? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; I know you're a healer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
