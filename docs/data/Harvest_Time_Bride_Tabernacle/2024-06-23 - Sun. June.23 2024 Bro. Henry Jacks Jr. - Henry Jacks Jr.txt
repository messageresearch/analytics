to fight for our joy hallelujah thank you Jesus and the enemy knows that but God will send us the great comforter to comfort Us in everything we're so thankful of that this morning Hallelujah if you have the Bibles with me could you turn your Bibles to the book of Philippians chapter 2 we're going to read a few verses here hallelujah what a mighty God we serve Saints Hallelujah I have proven him over and over Hallelujah is still God hallelujah all other gods they are they are made of man's hand Hallelujah is the one and true Living God Philippians 2:1 brother Paul here was speaking to the Saints there in Philippi if there be therefore any consolation he use the word if well can I say this there is consolation in Jesus Christ hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah he said if any comfort he use the word if again can I say this there's comfort of love in Christ Jesus Hallelujah if any Fellowship of the spirit can I say this we have Fellowship of the spirit amen hallelujah because the spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God hallelujah if any bowels and mercies can I say this God's people is covered with mercies The Mercy Seat is living inside of the heart Hallelujah just like it was in Abraham and we are the Seed of Abraham so we are carrying the mercy seed so there's mercies that's why David say surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life hallelujah praise God now brother Paul Hallelujah he said fulfill he my joy if all of these things in you you fulfill Hallelujah my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind thank the Lord for that God always places people in One Direction God would not have his his people all over the place there has to go in One Direction same place let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better themselves look not every man on his own things but every man every man also on the things of others verse five is the key verse the team let this mind be you which was also in Christ Jesus Hallelujah you can be seated we ask the Lord to have his Blessing to his word hallelujah praise the Lord amen what a mighty God we serve amen I just want to greet you all I just want to take this out of the way I greet you all this morning in the mighty name for Lord Jesus Christ you know and I bring greetings from My Wife and also I I my pastor husband B ask me to greet the church for him you know we love you I love you you know you're my family and I hold you close to my heart God is good God is good Saints hallelujah praise God you know this week was a difficult week you know I've never experienced such humidity before you know that they say that Friday was the um in London is it was the hottiest day since 1941 and we're not too far from London just a hour you get imagine the heat that we were we were receiving wow it's just I tell you Saints I have to just give God thanks you know we can't keep ourself he has to keep us hallelujah and we're serving a God that does not break his Covenant Hallelujah he keep his Covenant Hallelujah he said his word will not return to him void but it shall accomplish where s so if God said Hallelujah I will keep you he has to keep you he will not lie is not a God that he should lie God always keep his word hallelujah amen praise the Lord the topic this morning let this mind be in you Hallelujah that's the topic I want to speak you know we're living we talk about seasons and times and so forth the Bible said in the book of ecclesiastic in with everything there is a season and time Hallelujah and we're living in a time where people always talk about restoration yes you have the season of restoration but some person only to dwell in the restoration season is there only one season of restoration what about the other season season there is a season of restoration meaning God restor back all things and I believe that that took place Hallelujah because now we are back with the word man was further away from the word and when I'm talking about the word I'm not talking about the letters I'm talking about the spirit of God hallelujah because God plan Hallelujah God plan God Vision was for man to have his Spirit Hallelujah so that man could be close to him glory to God so now we're seeing that where's a Caesar and the Cesar is bearing fruit just like in the natural Hallelujah when you planted a tree you know that there's a season when the tree has to grow Hallelujah there is a season where you have to weed around the tree you got to remove the weeds Hallelujah sometimes there is season that you got to go through pruning I lost somebody Hallelujah God sometimes bring us through season that God has to prune us hallelujah am I speaking this morning to somebody and and sometime God have us in season whereby God is pruning us brother Dale and we don't even realize that God is pruning us because there's something God want to remove from us hallelujah because God wants to reveal his glory in us hallelujah so that when it is when it come to your season for you to bear fruit because you go through the seeds of pruning nothing can stop you from bring forth fruit amen hallelujah oh glory to God Jesus said brother Peter the death is after you to SI you like wheat but I already prayed for you you know what you know what is a cist when you put something in sh Hallelujah there are things that is coming out Hallelujah and there are things that you got to got to dispose off glory to God that's sometime God has to bring us through this period Hallelujah and sometimes God has to allow some tries to come on us God has to allow it so that God could see us there's something God want to get rid out of us probably we have too much Temperance Hallelujah probably sometimes we're full of our own selves and God said no I got to take some of you you full of too much of you Hallelujah I got to take out that thought of you Hallelujah that's why brother Paul was saying to them he said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Hallelujah you know that the Philippians Church brother Paul had a close relationship with them Hallelujah brother Paul loved them Hallelujah brother Paul visit them in Acts chapter 16 Hallelujah and when he visit them and they heard the gospel Hallelujah they were so excited Hallelujah when they hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they receive it but then brother Paul was caused into prison and even though he was caed into prison Hallelujah the devil cannot shut up the word the devil cannot kill the go goel the devil cannot Hallelujah the devil cannot shut up the gospel of Christ even though the man who was carrying the gospel was been caus in prison the devil thought that he could have lock up the gospel but while brother Paul was in prison the gospel was spreading Hallelujah the gospel is spreading so is it even today Hallelujah the enemy thinks that he can get rid of the Gospel but he cannot Hallelujah the gospel has to reach the four corners of the earth Hallelujah because there has to be people that has to come in Hallelujah there has to be some heagles that are in the valley and they're trying to listen to hear the mother heagle Hallelujah some experience eager did you know that the gospel is also to strengthen people am when the prophets speak about the eagle and he said that there is some eag as to go through a mted period when they're in the valley but he said he are some Eagles that cannot survive this but there will be some that will survive it and they will survive it because you have some experienced Eagle that have been through that Hallelujah glory to God he said when these eagles are in the valley Hallelujah he said something start to happen to them they start to lose their beak the feathers start to drop off their skins hallelujah what is it they're going through a moled period and they needed something to eat but the experienced Eagle who have been through this Hallelujah there remember that there are some Eagles that are down in the valley that need some strength that need some help Hallelujah because they have the mind of Christ Hallelujah and they start to Spread spread over the valley fly over the valley and let them some meat in the valley Hallelujah so is it today thank God for the great heager that is Jesus Christ Hallelujah there's a flying of Father heager over the valley he's letting down some meat so that we can eat that we can be strengthened that we can come out out of this Valley hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah that's the gospel we have today amen praise the Lord give me a second here hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah what a mighty God we serve Hallelujah you know the the stret was coming on over my eyes closing my eyes thank God the mind of Christ it brings you to the Faith of Christ you have two Faith you have the Faith of Christ and you have the faith of God the Bible said in Revelation the Commandments and the faith of God right but then you have the the Faith of Christ Ephesians chapter 4 teaches us hallelujah that the the the the purpose of the fivefold ministry is to bring them in the unity of the faith and Jude one is a content for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints and that faith is the Faith of Christ Hallelujah he's the Faith of Christ so here we are as we mentioned there's two season Hallelujah the season of restoration and the season of bearing forth fruit Hallelujah and we're living the season whereby it is manifesting time and we are to manifest Christ how do you manifest Christ Hallelujah when you bear forth fruit that's when you're manifesting Christ Hallelujah and the fruits Hallelujah that I'm talking about I'm talking about faith Temperance patience brotherly God brotherly kindness godliness Hallelujah these are the fruits of the spirit Hallelujah these are the fruit The Joy the patience we must manifest these things because these are the attribute of Jesus Christ sometimes people need some longsuffering hallelu you got to Long suffer with some members you got to Long suffer with your children Hallelujah you got to Long suffer with your relatives Hallelujah Jesus had to Long suffer with his with his relative the Bible said he has four brothers but they did not believe in him Hallelujah they did not believe in him but he long suffer with them God long with Israel for 40 years he said for 40 years long I've been long suffer with this generation Hallelujah so we have to we have to portray the same attribute that Jesus portrayed Hallelujah you're got to express some mercy oh God am I talking to some Abraham children Hallelujah give the Seed of Abraham say heyen Oh Glory to God hallelujah I tell you saints of God sometimes there people they will test your faith Hallelujah and if you're not careful you will be like Elisha when Elisha when those 42 children Hallelujah were mocking Elisha and the Bible said Elisha called to she bear Hallelujah to devour those 42 children you know what the Prophet said he said that wasn't God hallelujah he said that wasn't God hallelujah I tell you Saints sometimes Hallelujah you know when you have the mind of Christ you got to it will make you understand that the devil is strength the devil Hallelujah is pressing your button yes sir Hallelujah because you're still in this flesh Hallelujah and once you're still in this flesh you're going to react according to your emotions Hallelujah GL I've been there I've been there I'm being honest I tell you Sint sometimes I tell you some person press me H the the last thing left for me to do was call on fire I'm telling you the truth hallelujah the last thing left for me is to call down fire you know what the disciples said to Jesus every time you go through Samaria they're rejecting you why you don't call on fire like Elijah did Jesus said no Hallelujah he said no that's not the will of God hallelujah it's not the will of God thank God we cannot make it without his holy spirit the mind of Christ is the spirit of God hallelujah and it takes the spirit of God to lead you into his will and not the will of the flesh because you have the will of God and you have the will of the flesh Hallelujah and the mind of Christ lead you into the will of God and not of the flesh so when sometimes you start to be a certain way when you look at it you're not going into the will of God it is in the will of Flesh Hallelujah so God has to keep us God has to keep us even from our own self because our own self Hallelujah is an unbeliever oh praise God brother Paul said every time I want to do good Heil present itself Hallelujah so the battle sometimes even your own self you have to go up against your own self but it takes the spirit of God hallelujah to put your own self under subjection hallelujah oh praise God thank you very much my sister amen praise the Lord my God so here brother Paul Hallelujah the word let when he use the word let this mind the word let means not prevent Hallelujah allow forbid do not forbid the mind of Christ it is important Hallelujah do not forbid it Hallelujah because the mind of Christ will lead you into the perfect path glory to God and many times people sometimes they think that they're going by faith but the prophet said imagination and faith is very close he said it is very close sometime they think that is Faith but he said it's not their faith it's their imagination oh my God hallelujah th this is the flesh hallelujah we're up against glory to God that's why Jesus had to came so that he could send back the Holy Spirit glory to God send back the mind of the father so that the mind of the father once he comes inside of us it brings us to The Obedience of the father's will Hallelujah and once you bring us to the father's will you're going to manifest the will of the father Hallelujah you're going to manifest his character when brother Paul here H when he was in prison he heard what was happening hallelujah what was happening in the Church of Philippi they loved him the Philippi Church loved him while he was in prison they were sending gifts to him in there but brother Paul said you got to move away from Strife there's too much Strife too much vain Glory all of these things that is happening he said you got to come to the will that's why I said if there's any consolation he wasn't saying there's no consolation in Christ no he wasn't saying that he wasn't saying if there's any comfort of Love In Christ there's comfort of Love hallelujah oh my God the Bible said what manner of love that the father has bestow upon us that we are called the sons of God hallelujah and the Bible said Hallelujah no greater love that a man have for his friends but to lay down his life for his friends brother Paul knew that love was there but he was saying that do not heal to your own mind Hallelujah he knew that mercies was there but do not heal to your own mind Hallelujah but let this mind that was in Jesus Christ also being you so when your brothers do you something Hallelujah you must forgive him you know why because you're expressing Mercy Hallelujah you're manifesting the will of the father glory to God look at what they did to Jesus he came to his home and they receive him that but yes still he loved them he loved them he loved them even though they did him so many evil you know Friday I was talking to the the guys there brother Dale and I said to them the Bible said that hell was not created for man it was created for the devil and his angel I said why would I want to go to a place that was not created for me Hallelujah I will not Hallelujah I know my purpose I know why I was created my purpose what that I was created for was not to go to hell Hallelujah I said I went even further I said Hallelujah I'm not a devil and I'm neither and I'm neither his Angel Hallelujah I am a servant of God hallelujah and when you're a servant of God you have to go on the opposite direction Hallelujah the opposite way glory to God you know the conversation went even further you know we were having a good talk Hallelujah you know and I said to them there's two type of heart they said what are you talking about I've never heard that before I said you only heard about the natur the F the natural one that pumps that pumps the blood Hallelujah to the body but you have the natural one and you have the spiritual one Hall the spiritual heart is where the Inner Man dwells this is where you have two seed in it and the one that you feed the most will become greater you have the seed of doubt in it and you have the seed of Fai in it Hallelujah that's why the Bible said guard the issues guard your heart because out of it come the issues of Life hallelujah it's what you feed you become Jesus Hallelujah when the when the when somebody said your mind molds your character Hallelujah he's talking about the spiritual man Hallelujah glory to God you know sometimes it grieved my heart you know because sometimes you're talking to some people and it's like you're not going anywhere all is just licking is w w he just keep bouncing back off but you know what you got to keep going nowah nowah had to preach for 120 years Jesus hallelujah oh nowah and the prophecy was preaching the same message it is hard but you got to keep going Hallelujah 120 years the same message over and over and over for 120 years but you know what it was true that's the important thing it is true Hallelujah so sometimes though we're speaking to people and it seems like not going nowhere but keep going Hall keep preaching keep preaching Hallelujah keep speaking to them if you have a neighbor Hallelujah and you're testifying about Christ to them and it seems like it's not going nowhere keep testifying amen keep testifying Hallelujah glory to God and I tell you Saints once you keep doing it if they are elected they has to come Hallelujah they has to come even one day before judgment struck Hallelujah I believe it believe it Hallelujah First Corinthians 2 glory to God do you love him praise the Lord First Corinthians chapter 2 oh my Lord hallelujah let me say this we all believe in the Rapture Hallelujah the Rapture is an attribute of the father it's an attribute of the father and because it is an attribute of the Father the Rapture has to be in you yes sir all the was in God he pour into Christ and all that was into Christ he pour into the church so you're going to manifest it so no matter what the devil do and no matter what it comes with you have to manifest every attribute of the father amen hallelujah praise God the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 2 but God had re revealing them unto us by his Spirit nothing can be revealed outside of the spirit of God everything H that is revealed is by his Spirit it is his spirit that gives the Revelation to it and we're talking about how the spirit is the mind of Christ glory to God so when you stand here and said I am pass from Death unto life glory to God because you receive a revelation Simeon the angel revealed to him you shall not see death until to see the Lord's face Hallelujah Sim he believed in that it was by Revelation even though every years he began getting older but he was watching the ho they get he was looking Hallelujah for the manifestation he was waiting for that day that he receive the Lord Christ so is it today we waiting Hallelujah because we know that one day we shall leave the scene we shall change we shall have a body change Hallelujah because we're not we don't re we don't just read it Hallelujah we don't just hear about it it's been revealed to us that one day we shall leave this place this

tell the Saints a lot of persons are arguing are fighting are fussing Hallelujah God has given us peace if he has given us peace why are we we fussing why are we Haring we must live good together when brother Paul said we must be of the same mind the same mind in unity in unity can I say this in the book of St John 6 from verse 53 to 55 when Jesus said except you take of the Flesh of the son of man and drink of his blood you have no life in you did you know that there's three benefits one is eternal life and you are in unity with Christ Hallelujah so you know what that tells me some persons that are not in unity it means they not eating the the son of man body and drinking of his blood you know what the Bible said he that drink of his e that drink of his blood than it I will dwell in him

spiritual it takes the mind of Christ Hallelujah to compare spiritual things with spiritual without the mind of Christ you cannot understand the spiritual things because it is foolishness unto the natural oh God that was what happened in St John 6 when the Bible said and they walk no more with him Peter said when Jesus turned to the 12 will you also not go will you not also go Peter said to whom shall we go to and you are the words of eternal life Jesus my God Jesus mentioned that he that eat he that eat my body and drink my blood of eternal life oh my God hallelujah Peter receive it

following the majority I'm staying with the minority Hallelujah I'm staying with the minority because the minority is in the presence of eternal life thank you Lord hallelujah praise God hallelujah but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judge at all things yet he himself is Judge of no man you know how you judge all things when you started to receive the word or do you know that God is speaking to you when you watch your life yeah that's how you
