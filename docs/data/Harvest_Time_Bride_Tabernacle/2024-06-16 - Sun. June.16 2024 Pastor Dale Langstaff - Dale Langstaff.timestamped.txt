[9:49] amen amen we're just going to ask you to
[9:52] have your seats and brother Carson's got
[9:54] a little something for us this morning
[9:56] amen
[10:14] Lord bless you
[10:16] all happy Father's
[10:19] Day I have something here
[10:23] that
[10:27] well it sometimes excuse me sometimes we
[10:31] read stories sometimes we hear people
[10:35] tell you things but this is something
[10:38] that I experienced myself I didn't read
[10:40] it it
[10:42] happened and it's a testimony to me that
[10:46] I would like to
[10:48] share because there is a such thing
[10:52] called ripple
[10:54] effect as little kids may not want no RI
[10:58] effect mom or dad to take you and you
[11:00] get a big pond of water you throw a rock
[11:03] and the ripple effect goes both ways
[11:05] there you go goes
[11:07] everywhere so the riple effect means
[11:10] when the truth and life of Jesus Christ
[11:13] we're talking spiritual because we are
[11:16] believers right so we want to have
[11:20] Believers riple effect from H as a
[11:22] Believer as a as a
[11:24] Christian and it says when the truth and
[11:27] life of Jesus Christ are experienced by
[11:29] the one person and has transformed their
[11:32] life to such extent that the ripple
[11:35] effect touches
[11:37] others and that could go on for a long
[11:40] time yes sir
[11:43] so what really happened was and when I
[11:47] read this until it come out and I said
[11:49] this is a good time to speak about this
[11:51] is Father's day because us
[11:55] fathers will do something and a ripple
[11:59] will effect many years later maybe not
[12:02] to our kids but to our
[12:05] friends so when we were young we've
[12:09] always had family
[12:10] prayer and we had friends that did not
[12:13] go to
[12:14] church but there was one friend that I
[12:16] had he came to church he came to our
[12:19] house we would have
[12:21] supper and my dad would say kirson your
[12:25] friend is welcome to stay we're going to
[12:27] have family devotions where he's welcome
[12:30] to go outside and wait for you that was
[12:33] pretty fair he didn't push him out he
[12:35] didn't stay stay so that was fine he
[12:40] stayed many
[12:42] times so we're going to say I want to
[12:45] say about 45 years later from that time
[12:52] I had a phone call a couple years ago
[12:54] maybe two years ago from a
[12:57] brother who went and worked in a small
[13:00] town and he met the
[13:02] supervisor and he said to the supervisor
[13:05] he said so did you grow up here he no he
[13:07] said I grew up in a town called
[13:09] grandfalls Windsor Newan Windsor and the
[13:12] brother said so you must know Carson
[13:14] Samson he said I certainly
[13:17] do and he said really he said
[13:20] yeah he said is Dad as he was as the
[13:24] world would portray it his dad was a
[13:27] religious man right and in other words
[13:29] he was a Christian man his dad was a
[13:32] very Christian man he said I do not
[13:35] forget
[13:36] it 45 46 years later it was Ste that
[13:41] young man Earth of what was said he said
[13:45] his dad always said family prayer and he
[13:47] said he would include me or else he
[13:50] would ask me if I wanted to leave and
[13:52] that man grew up without family prayer
[13:55] with a bad life but 45 to 4 6 I'm not
[13:59] quite sure I was when that happened and
[14:02] he he still
[14:04] remembered what went on Amen so the
[14:07] riple effect from my
[14:10] dad was still going in that man and I
[14:14] would say there's other people because
[14:16] it was eight of us siblings kids we've
[14:19] all had friends over and they all and
[14:21] when when I got married we had children
[14:25] and we did the same thing to our
[14:26] children's friends when they come over
[14:29] they would we could stay or walk and
[14:32] some would stay some wouldn't but my
[14:34] point is is the ripple effect how we
[14:38] behave so I thought as fathers uh we
[14:41] would do things with our children that
[14:44] they will not forget in a long time it
[14:47] would impress something on their art and
[14:50] if our children gets wandered
[14:52] away there's still something that's
[14:54] right in their Earths that would bring
[14:56] them back to the Lord
[14:59] so I thought I would share that this
[15:01] morning the riple
[15:04] effect it anybody you meet and I want to
[15:08] just say something about brother Dale I
[15:11] met some people since I've been here and
[15:15] one guy I said do you know Dale
[15:18] langstaff yeah he said he's a different
[15:21] person and I walked away and I said to I
[15:24] said to my wife I said I met this guy
[15:25] and he said that but day was a different
[15:27] person
[15:29] and I thought about it and I said yeah a
[15:32] different
[15:33] person we all have different ways
[15:35] different things about us but he's seen
[15:37] something different in that man and it
[15:41] didn't forget him so as I was looking at
[15:43] this a lot of things come to me about
[15:46] different people and so you how some
[15:49] little thing you might have said to that
[15:51] man I know that he used to go he used to
[15:53] come around Petrolia church sometimes so
[15:55] maybe it at that time I don't know I
[15:58] never got into to it but the ripple
[16:02] effect and I thought it would be great
[16:04] because even in our normal
[16:07] lives as yesterday we experienced
[16:11] yesterday there was people there
[16:13] yesterday to the to the celebration for
[16:15] me yesterday that I did not expect to be
[16:18] there right true but they sat with
[16:21] Believers sister Joanie and your mom
[16:24] they sat there and other sisters they
[16:26] sat there together and what was said I
[16:29] don't know but they were together
[16:30] mingling something could be said there
[16:33] the ripple effect that they will not
[16:35] forget so i i u I thought it was a good
[16:38] thing the ripple effect I mean even
[16:41] better Jarett you got a business you
[16:44] people that you talk to brother bar
[16:46] travels on the road you meet different
[16:48] people brother gar there is a security
[16:50] guard meet so many people coming in on
[16:53] the jobs I know cuz I see them they come
[16:55] in and these people come on jobs and
[16:57] they're all up they got lot so many
[17:01] issues but if they see brother gar with
[17:03] his Bible or you see brother G me
[17:05] mention something to him they'll walk
[17:07] away but they will not forget that
[17:10] security guard the little things they do
[17:12] not
[17:13] forget I know on jobs and some people
[17:16] come to me don't forget what you said I
[17:19] remember that way back so in our lives
[17:23] we we got to be very careful how we talk
[17:26] and how we treat people we I'm saying we
[17:29] I'm not saying you or I I said we as a
[17:31] group of Believers a Christian display
[17:34] our Christian
[17:36] Life Christian Life is uh I've been
[17:38] looking at that too and there's a lot of
[17:41] things in a Christian Life it's not just
[17:43] going to
[17:44] church there's more to going to church
[17:47] there's a lot of things to cover there
[17:50] and your your life is
[17:53] displayed but ranam said you do not have
[17:55] to preach he said you live a life and he
[17:58] said people will see how you live sister
[18:02] Patricia taking care of people working
[18:03] in the schools you you don't know they
[18:06] see people with a a sister with a dress
[18:08] on but there's some I've seen many
[18:10] people with dresses on but soon as you
[18:12] turn around you knew right away the
[18:14] earrings and makeup but when sister
[18:16] Patricia turned around there no earrings
[18:17] and makeup they see something different
[18:19] and my wife when we worked on the
[18:21] construction and doing jobs and same
[18:23] thing you so your rip will affect even
[18:26] you our parents so I thought for the
[18:28] today as a father it was uh where I'd
[18:32] seen it with my own dad and right to
[18:35] this day I hasn't had a chance to tell
[18:36] my dad that yet so I'm hoping when I go
[18:38] home I will tell him how what happened
[18:42] when we were young right up to now and
[18:44] still affected him so thank you for your
[18:47] time and the care
[19:02] wonderful it's so so true I mean
[19:05] sometimes you cross paths with people
[19:07] and you know I've had different people
[19:10] work for me and you know they might be
[19:11] come and gone and you just sometimes you
[19:14] ask the Lord like

[31:39] Saturday a week ago somebody from
[31:42] MIchigan they said it's sure nice to see
[31:43] you not at a
[31:46] funeral you know but we have a lot of
[31:48] things to celebrate besides funerals but
[31:52] because our society is
[31:54] selfish and we think about I well it's
[31:58] not me then we don't celebrate other
[32:01] people we should celebrate other people

[32:23] happy you know and you know our whole
[32:26] relationship here God made us for
[32:28] fellowship and our Prophet said that you
[32:31] know when he spoke Elohim he he existed
[32:34] alone but when he had us in his thoughts
[32:36] he was no more alone he was no longer
[32:39] the self-existing one he dwelt with his
[32:43] family and what the family was was
[32:45] celebration he celebrated a new birth he
[32:48] celebrated a birthday he celebrated an
[32:52] anniversary amen that's called life

[33:59] me amen the ripple effect that's
[34:02] powerful that's very powerful but we're

[34:43] potato chips on the way and it's just
[34:44] straight up this road and if we do

[37:24] willing to share it and just like a
[37:26] special or something like that amen
[37:28] that's that's part of a church and it's
[37:29] a family and it's a body and it's it's
[37:31] not a oneman show or operation that's
[37:35] why we have fivefold and Gifts in the

[37:45] 7 I'm going to

[37:50] morning and
[38:01] I have a confession to make I have a
[38:04] unfair advantage of most of
[38:09] you because I had a real
[38:13] father real godly man and example in my
[38:21] life
[38:24] amen I don't have no Bible up here first
[38:26] Peter 1 and uh 6 and 7 wherein are ye
[38:30] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[38:33] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[38:37] manifold Temptations verse 7 that your
[38:40] trials of your faith being more precious
[38:43] than
[38:45] gold more of gold that are precious
[38:48] sorry through though it be tried up by
[38:51] fire might be found onto praise and
[38:54] honor and Glory by the appearing of
[38:56] Jesus Christ let's turn over to Hebrews
[38:58] just before you're seated Hebrews
[39:00] 5
[39:02] uh and we're going to read just 8 and
[39:05] n9ine Hebrews
[39:06] 58-9 and here it's talking about Jesus
[39:09] though he Christ were a son yet learned
[39:14] he
[39:15] obedience by the things which
[39:19] he
[39:21] suffered and being made perfect he
[39:24] became the author of Eternal salvation
[39:26] unto them that
[39:27] obeyed him Lord Jesus we pray that
[39:30] you'll bless your word this morning
[39:32] bless all your bride here represented
[39:35] and Lord help us fathers to be what you
[39:38] had planned for us in your name we pray
[39:41] amen you may have your seats amen you
[39:43] know there's a difference between a
[39:46] father the characteristics of a father
[39:49] and somebody that can just have
[39:52] children a huge difference and you know
[39:56] uh we have uh different spirits and
[39:58] different things that that are around
[40:00] our age and we we have different
[40:03] terminology but we the the actions and
[40:07] the way we live our life is exactly the
[40:09] things that we do not like now we know
[40:12] that somebody that comes into great
[40:13] riches young we call them silver
[40:17] spoon or Young Rich and yet most of us
[40:21] are guilty of living our complete life
[40:24] on our family to create what we hate
[40:28] amen the very you know if you've seen a
[40:30] kid up town and they were just a brat
[40:33] but the way you raise your family you
[40:34] raise
[40:35] brats you you see somebody that's a
[40:38] silver spoon and they just come into
[40:40] enormous amount of wealth they don't
[40:41] have a clue how to handle it and yet we
[40:44] live our life because we have this
[40:47] really bad saying that we say well I
[40:50] don't want our children to go through
[40:52] the hardships that I went through we
[40:55] don't want our children to suffer like
[40:56] me and your mom
[40:59] suffered and that's why you raise
[41:02] exactly what you don't
[41:04] like because without
[41:07] s there will be no character you have to
[41:11] go through trials and tribulations and
[41:13] Christ G that's the Son of God had to do
[41:16] that and he was the only born the only
[41:19] person born without sin born of a virgin
[41:22] perfect and yet the B and we're a long
[41:26] ways from born perfect
[41:27] we we here we came come to the world
[41:30] speaking lies
[41:32] and born in
[41:34] sin and we'll run from anything that's
[41:38] suffering we're looking at a world that
[41:40] has no character if anything's difficult
[41:42] we change jobs we change marriage not in
[41:44] the hopefully not in the church but we
[41:46] just run run for our
[41:48] life you know I seen somebody you know
[41:51] and and you know the the prophet said
[41:53] this he said I would give anything to
[41:55] have a home but he said I'm I'm I I
[41:57] don't know the exact word he used but he
[41:58] said I'm just a Wanderer and he said I
[42:00] looked at an airplane and I never knew
[42:02] what he said until recently but you know
[42:04] I looked at an airplane I wished I was
[42:06] on it but he said I have no place to
[42:07] call home I just and he said I would
[42:09] give anything I believe he said actually
[42:11] a million dollars then but that was a
[42:12] lot more than today but he said I would
[42:14] give anything to have someplace that I
[42:17] could just go down hang my hat sit on
[42:19] the front
[42:20] porch because he was real he was called
[42:23] to a different
[42:24] Ministry amen but we we find in our
[42:27] world that people are running from
[42:28] everything I've seen something just
[42:29] randomly and it don't matter who it was
[42:31] but they you know they they were moving
[42:33] again and it's all right to move by the
[42:35] way it's totally all right to move and
[42:37] people would move for jobs and and
[42:38] praise God brother cars and sister
[42:40] Sharon move because because I mean there
[42:43] there's good things to that but you know
[42:45] but people move for the wrong reasons
[42:47] you know they live here 10 years and
[42:49] they run away oh well nothing's perfect
[42:51] here and when they get there they're
[42:53] they
[42:55] also amen and somebody they they'd Liv
[42:58] one place one Province 15 years they
[43:00] went to another Province through so many
[43:02] years and they were moving to another
[43:04] Province I'm just like
[43:07] wow how could I pull up everything that
[43:09] I consider deer here and
[43:14] disappear you ain't going to be happy
[43:16] when you get there unless it's glory
[43:18] because Abraham said I'm looking for a
[43:19] city and Builder who maker is God and
[43:22] you know we always you know we go away
[43:24] and we say well we could you know I'm
[43:26] guilty of this I every country I visit I
[43:28] said well I could live
[43:29] here but when I get there I would be
[43:32] there and it would still be just like
[43:35] here amen but we we we always are
[43:39] looking over the fence and we find it
[43:41] hard to be satisfied in our
[43:44] trial suffling we think well if we jump
[43:47] the fence and we're in the next pasture
[43:49] next door there will be less
[43:52] thistles there'll still be thistles in
[43:54] there too cuz the wind blew them over
[43:57] there and the birds took them over you
[43:58] know in our yard we have we never
[44:00] planted wild raspberries but the birds
[44:02] seated them for us and they're beautiful
[44:05] the S Esther will make me smoothies that
[44:07] oh just slap your grandma good just tiny
[44:11] tiny little raspberries and the birds
[44:12] huge Bush as big as a
[44:14] piano we never pled them the birds
[44:17] planted them but God planned on you know
[44:20] us to have character you know and so we
[44:22] see all these things but if we're not
[44:24] careful
[44:27] we'll give our kids too much we'll spoil
[44:29] them you'll destroy them you give
[44:33] ministers too much you'll destroy
[44:36] them amen nothing wrong with
[44:40] money but it can ruin people it can you
[44:43] amen so sufferings amen is different you
[44:46] know character is something that's
[44:49] achieved it just don't come when you're
[44:52] borned amen and so we look at the idea
[44:56] of character and I I want to consider
[44:58] this as our lord Jesus and our heavenly
[45:00] father and think of the character that
[45:02] he had and compare that in a in a as
[45:06] best we can to our Heavenly or Earthly
[45:10] fathers but fathers the definition of
[45:13] father is if somebody's going to be
[45:17] hurt I'd rather it be
[45:22] me right I mean he's supposed to be the
[45:25] protector in every way
[45:28] but you know in the society that we live
[45:30] in it's far from
[45:35] that it's far from that you know I said
[45:38] I have an unfair Advantage
[45:40] because my daddy came from
[45:43] heaven and he lived like
[45:46] that I remember devotions I remember my
[45:50] daddy sacrificing money to go to Every
[45:54] Church camp that you could think of in
[45:55] the world
[45:57] because that's what he wanted the
[45:58] environment for his kids to be in it was
[46:02] sacrifice I can remember my dad staying
[46:05] home and doing things he shouldn't have
[46:07] did like Square bound emptying alone so
[46:11] all his family could be at
[46:14] Camp amen that was sacrifice was
[46:19] character and we see that character if
[46:22] you looked up in Google it's
[46:25] compassionate it's
[46:28] sensitive and it's
[46:31] kind and I already shared it that if
[46:33] somebody else was going to be hurt or
[46:35] have pain you would step forward and say
[46:39] I'll take
[46:40] that
[46:43] amen and the Very opposite of character
[46:47] is what this world is
[46:49] self-centered and
[46:51] immature
[46:54] brats disrespectful
[46:58] to parents and
[47:00] elders and you know even brother Brown
[47:04] the used to kids would call their dad
[47:06] the old man or the old woman or that
[47:09] that's
[47:11] disgusting and any kid that comes to
[47:14] their parents parents even though it's
[47:17] Father's Day we you say and you say
[47:19] something
[47:20] disgusting you need a kick in the
[47:24] knee period
[47:28] amen that's just
[47:34] disgusting and it's also disgusting to
[47:36] our Heavenly
[47:37] Father amen God help
[47:42] us here's some quotes just to lay his
[47:45] foundation said it's strange that God
[47:47] wants us to develop a Christlike
[47:49] character and it comes
[47:51] through suffering but you know even in
[47:54] our spiritual walk now you just think
[47:56] about and I I'm I'm preaching to myself
[47:57] this morning but you think back if it
[47:59] gets too rough we're going to be looking
[48:01] over the fence
[48:04] spiritually and yet God has to put you
[48:07] through that you know if you're his
[48:09] child you know if you run away from
[48:11] chastisement you know what the Bible
[48:14] says you didn't come from
[48:16] him and yet every one of us when it gets
[48:20] to fck we run but God's doing that to
[48:24] build exactly what he wants
[48:27] Christ on
[48:29] Earth
[48:31] amen that's
[48:34] crazy you know I thought Christ loved us
[48:36] enough to just give us roses and bed of
[48:39] ease but he wants you to be like
[48:42] Christ and so he has to give you this
[48:45] other oh it's coming the better roses
[48:47] and flowers is coming but that's after
[48:50] you've
[48:51] achieved what Christ had to go through
[48:54] amen and if Christ had to go through it
[48:57] you ain't going to arrive there without
[48:59] doing the same thing amen and we all try
[49:03] watch this he said no sir he said we all
[49:06] have trials and we all
[49:08] try to to uh to get away from them but
[49:12] no
[49:13] one can
[49:16] amen he said it's exactly the
[49:18] organizations of the church in the last
[49:20] day he said come out of her my people he
[49:22] said the Rapture has not yet taken place
[49:25] watch this he's he's saying about what's
[49:27] going to happen before the Rapture now
[49:29] now our Prophet clearly said we're not
[49:30] going to be uh like abused but we're
[49:33] going to
[49:34] be having character so we're going to be
[49:37] under pressure he said the Rapture
[49:39] hasn't taken place yet and the bride is
[49:42] not yet gone when these terrible
[49:46] conditions in this rich and false Church
[49:50] exist we're living in those this state
[49:53] that he said he's not going to take us
[49:55] out of here before before he feel before
[49:58] we feel some pressure but there is the
[50:01] gold of God he said it's Tried by your
[50:04] faith being much more precious than gold
[50:07] that perishes he said the gold of God is
[50:10] Christlike character produced and the
[50:12] fiery furnaces of Affliction now if you
[50:15] were honest with yourself there's not
[50:17] one of us that stand up and enjoy the
[50:19] furnace there's not one way you might
[50:22] pretend like you do but you
[50:24] don't and your private time you're
[50:27] you're you're squirming like
[50:30] a because the heat is on and he said
[50:33] that is the right kind of gold this is
[50:36] our Prophet talking he said that's the
[50:38] right kind of gold because it's God's
[50:41] gold and it's from the Heat and he said
[50:44] watch this he said the same quote here
[50:46] just further down he said and you'd
[50:48] better come to it before it's too late
[50:50] sayith the Lord and buy of me gold tried
[50:53] in the fire and when you'll be truly
[50:55] rich and and we are we getting it listen
[50:58] to me he said n naged physically and we
[51:01] come into the world but naked
[51:03] spiritually we will not
[51:04] leave he's saying you come into the
[51:07] world with nothing physically but you're
[51:09] not going to leave with nothing there's
[51:12] something you're going to take and it's
[51:14] either a briat or the character amen oh
[51:18] no he said you're going to take
[51:20] something with us and that something is
[51:22] all
[51:25] we that's all we can take with us
[51:27] nothing less and nothing more so we'
[51:30] better be real careful now to see that
[51:32] we take something that will make us
[51:35] right not before men but before God so
[51:41] when so when what will we take with us
[51:45] he said you will take
[51:47] your character brother that is what we
[51:52] will take with us now what kind of
[51:54] character will you take with you will it
[51:56] be like
[51:57] his character who whose character was
[52:00] molded by his suffering in the fiery
[52:02] furnaces of Affliction or will it be the
[52:05] softness watch this watch this I know
[52:08] we're not leot Dean people but we're
[52:10] rubbing with Leo deia will it be the
[52:13] softness of the character less this is
[52:17] the prophet still talking character less
[52:21] leot toan
[52:23] people you don't have to go really far
[52:25] to see that
[52:27] it is up to each of you for in that day
[52:31] a man will bear his own
[52:33] burden amen so you see what I'm saying
[52:37] so when we raise our family as parents
[52:39] and fathers the very thing that you're
[52:41] trying to save your kids from God
[52:45] ordained to make them the men and women
[52:48] that they must
[52:50] become
[52:52] who I hope my kids don't have to work
[52:55] hard I'm going to to try and Supply them
[52:57] a house I don't want them to have to
[52:59] ride a bike to work
[53:04] why amen I don't want them to have to
[53:07] really suffer to keep the church going
[53:12] why did you do you feel bad for it I
[53:17] mean I you see some people and my family
[53:19] don't know but sometimes even in our
[53:21] family people are in a marriage and then
[53:23] they raise and they will say they're
[53:25] like oh praise God I'm happily married
[53:27] I'm just wonderful and then they teach
[53:28] other kids never get
[53:30] married well if it was
[53:33] wonderful wouldn't you want him to get
[53:35] married by your very actions you're
[53:37] proving that you hate what you did you
[53:39] made a stupid decision you think and
[53:42] you're going to correct it with your
[53:43] kids oh bless God I never want my kids
[53:45] to get married like
[53:46] that but I'm
[53:52] happy
[53:54] amen God help us
[53:59] amen here the prophet said he says
[54:01] sometimes we think that our burdens I
[54:03] might inject this rate here he said that
[54:05] we think our burdens are he so heavy
[54:07] sometimes that there's nothing like it
[54:09] in the world do you know that all those
[54:12] things are good for
[54:14] you I'm still reading the prophet and
[54:17] they are all to mold you and make you
[54:20] the prophets was molded on the backside
[54:23] of the desert in the blazing hot sun and
[54:25] through tribulation and trials and
[54:27] persecutions and all those things that
[54:30] we have today there's nothing that
[54:32] happened to us that wasn't happened to
[54:35] the other Christians before
[54:37] us but so often we don't well we don't
[54:40] we don't want to do that to be like we
[54:43] respect them and we want to be like that
[54:45] but we don't want to go through what
[54:46] they did to go through
[54:48] that amen other Christians has had to
[54:52] stand in the hour of Darkness like this
[54:55] and even
[54:57] were fed to lions and you know all the

[1:02:35] years would plant many of the kids
[1:02:37] Fields first for
[1:02:40] free before he would plant his own land
[1:02:43] that was the money that he was going to
[1:02:45] give to his
[1:02:50] kids combine when it was wheat season
[1:02:53] and there's thunderstorms and you could
[1:02:55] lose the crop because of hail he would
[1:02:57] combine the kids Wheat first and his
[1:03:00] would Sprout and he' put it in the one
[1:03:01] room Schoolhouse and feed it to the
[1:03:02] cattle next winter and get the money a
[1:03:04] year from now because he was trying to
[1:03:06] make something easier for somebody
[1:03:09] else but brother Dale says bless God the
[1:03:12] combine's mine I'm headed to my
[1:03:17] field huh you do the same thing you do
[1:03:20] it in a different
[1:03:21] way cuz that's the natural flesh

[1:03:28] never saved you and me if Christ would
[1:03:31] have had that Spirit oh bless God I'm up

[1:04:44] difference
[1:04:45] disagreement a squirrel a
[1:04:49] squirrel or discrepancy against your
[1:04:53] father
[1:04:56] different than your heavenly father you
[1:04:58] know do we have the characteristic you
[1:04:59] know brother Brown said he said I'm
[1:05:01] afraid that we're getting the
[1:05:02] characteristic of the church the
[1:05:04] characteristic of the
[1:05:07] pastor and CH is like who's that
[1:05:12] guy I don't even recognize
[1:05:15] nothing you know what I shock you it's
[1:05:18] not a boat brother
[1:05:20] Dale and it ain't a boat Wyoming

[1:05:26] and say go travel as much as you can as
[1:05:29] much as you can I'll be thrilled when
[1:05:32] you come back testify party that's not
[1:05:35] to say that we're not connected in a
[1:05:38] home church we love you but they're part
[1:05:41] of the
[1:05:42] connection amen this is not an
[1:05:45] individual Kingdom this is a huge big
[1:05:48] worldwide do it I want to take every one
[1:05:51] of you where I go this
[1:05:53] winter make all your plans for win
[1:05:56] Let's Escape this
[1:05:58] place it's all
[1:06:00] right God's there
[1:06:04] too amen sir and if you can't go we'll
[1:06:08] leave you in charge to hold down the
[1:06:10] fort so when we come back in the
[1:06:13] spring
[1:06:15] amen against his father a daughter
[1:06:19] against her
[1:06:21] mother and the daughter-in-law against
[1:06:23] the mother-in-law and a man's foes shall
[1:06:27] be there of his own
[1:06:30] household now let's just look into that
[1:06:32] for a
[1:06:34] minute the ones that we suffer with are
[1:06:37] the ones that we're closest with we
[1:06:39] mentioned that last Sunday the people
[1:06:41] that you last owed at are the ones you
[1:06:44] love the most so it's either your mom
[1:06:46] and dad or your wife or
[1:06:49] husband or maybe your kids God feels
[1:06:52] sorry for those
[1:06:53] kids amen why do we do that you wouldn't
[1:06:57] talk like that at the grocery store the
[1:06:59] person would punch you in the
[1:07:01] face if you went to the bank tiller and
[1:07:03] you talk to her like you did your wife
[1:07:05] they wouldn't give you no money they'd
[1:07:07] say get
[1:07:08] lost oh you you think I'm going
[1:07:10] somewhere that's why they put up
[1:07:13] signs uhuh uhuh they put up a sign I was
[1:07:16] at the New Holland dealership in Delta
[1:07:18] and can you imagine how hyper the
[1:07:19] farmers are right now like it's a new
[1:07:22] kind of hyper if you want the definition
[1:07:23] talk to me after but it's serious hyper
[1:07:26] you know a farmer's income is normally
[1:07:28] between 1,000 and 1500 an acre so 100
[1:07:31] Acre Farm he's losing between 100 to
[1:07:34] 150,000 so now you just you can times
[1:07:36] that as big as you want hyper and they
[1:07:39] had a sign on the parts department they
[1:07:40] have four parts me because when Farmers
[1:07:43] come in I seen a guy come in he said
[1:07:44] don't talk to me right now you know when
[1:07:47] your planner breaks and you should have
[1:07:48] been planning a month ago that's called
[1:07:51] hyper but the character
[1:07:55] and that's what my dad I seen my daddy
[1:07:57] in tight
[1:07:59] situations
[1:08:01] just
[1:08:04] somehow well I I know
[1:08:06] how he couldn't have kept it together
[1:08:08] but
[1:08:09] God you know I remember I I I can only
[1:08:12] preach what I grew up in I can remember
[1:08:15] my daddy having a 100 acres of treeful
[1:08:17] seed and he went in there with a little
[1:08:20] uh I believe it was an Amorous SE which
[1:08:22] is about a 20 horsepower tractor and an
[1:08:24] 8ft sickle motor to cut that
[1:08:28] hay and he said if I would have knew how
[1:08:31] much money was in that field when I went
[1:08:32] in I would have went I would
[1:08:34] have lost my
[1:08:38] mind but he just he just ate foot now I
[1:08:41] don't know if you know but I me to tell
[1:08:42] you something a 100 Acre field is 2200
[1:08:45] feet wide so he had to go back and forth
[1:08:49] A lot of times for 8 ft and you have to
[1:08:52] leave a little space so you don't miss
[1:08:53] any so he was only cutting seven half ft
[1:08:56] divided by 22 if anybody's got a phone
[1:08:58] you can let me know how many that is but
[1:08:59] that's a lot of times across the field I
[1:09:01] mean it's more than enough times for me
[1:09:03] to fall
[1:09:07] asleep but that's character CU he just
[1:09:10] held it
[1:09:13] together and the reason he didn't know
[1:09:15] how much was in that field was because
[1:09:16] when they built the church and he left
[1:09:17] the Free Methodist Church when they cut
[1:09:19] the women cut their hair off and started
[1:09:21] wearing pants to church and started
[1:09:22] piercing their ears my dad left and
[1:09:25] started his church with one couple and
[1:09:27] none of them were preachers my oldest
[1:09:30] brother Paul tells me he said see you
[1:09:33] the Apple never fell far from the tree
[1:09:35] when you went and bought your church
[1:09:37] said cuz your daddy did the same thing
[1:09:39] except he didn't
[1:09:41] preach and that was before I was born
[1:09:44] and my daddy gave the first 30,000 to
[1:09:46] that
[1:09:48] church I'm pushing 60 so that was a
[1:09:50] while ago and you know the very next
[1:09:52] year my God gave my daddy 30,000 on one
[1:09:55] field that was the poorest field that he
[1:09:57] ever
[1:09:59] owned you can't outgive God if you got
[1:10:02] character that's not even
[1:10:06] possible that's why I can be the
[1:10:08] youngest of eight
[1:10:11] kids and because of what God's brought
[1:10:15] us
[1:10:16] to you could give more away but I would
[1:10:20] put my bank account with any one of my
[1:10:23] siblings and that's got cuz I'm smart I
[1:10:27] failed grade one it's because God's
[1:10:29] smart it's a principle it's God's
[1:10:33] principle in his word it has nothing to
[1:10:35] do with flesh if you're thinking it's
[1:10:37] because of Flesh you've missed
[1:10:39] everything but God does things because
[1:10:42] of suffering God asked you
[1:10:44] for just like God asking you for his
[1:10:47] money who in their right mind is going
[1:10:48] to give money away in the economy like
[1:10:50] this to
[1:10:52] anybody are you kidding
[1:10:56] but God knew what it would God knew what
[1:10:58] it would take to get him perfect that
[1:11:01] now that's a mystery right there how's
[1:11:05] God torture himself to become perfect
[1:11:08] now that was Christ and that's the
[1:11:10] anointed one that's
[1:11:13] Jehovah
[1:11:15] wow
[1:11:18] unbelievable here God knew this plan
[1:11:22] that it was to come to the Earth with a
[1:11:24] sword and he said he that loveth his
[1:11:26] father and mother more than loveth me is
[1:11:28] not worthy and he that loveth his son or
[1:11:31] daughter is not worthy of me and vers
[1:11:34] verse 38 and 30 uh is the one we want
[1:11:38] and he that taketh not his cross is
[1:11:42] burdened you know we need some fathers
[1:11:46] that aren't just
[1:11:47] men we need some people that hold up
[1:11:50] their end and a whole bunch of other
[1:11:52] people's end and they don't have to put
[1:11:54] it on Facebook
[1:11:57] oh I'm really helping out bless
[1:12:03] God well you got your reward here don't
[1:12:06] line up in heaven for it that's what the
[1:12:09] Bible
[1:12:10] says he that taketh not his cross here
[1:12:14] and followeth after me isn't even
[1:12:18] worthy to be in the
[1:12:21] family
[1:12:23] wow amen amen and he that findeth his
[1:12:27] life shall lose it and he that loses his
[1:12:30] life for my sake shall find it that
[1:12:33] that's against everything that society's
[1:12:36] teaching you we know that now we're not
[1:12:39] we're not we're just living by this
[1:12:41] Society we're not involved in this
[1:12:43] Society I know that you're not the part
[1:12:45] of that you know the prophet said that
[1:12:47] that everything in nature take spiritual
[1:12:50] and God shows everything in nature you
[1:12:53] know everything God valued he buried
[1:12:56] that's why we believe in Holiness by the
[1:12:58] way I don't want to see your body cuz I
[1:13:01] see mine every
[1:13:02] day I mean I
[1:13:04] shower I'm not trying to be funny I'm
[1:13:06] just saying our world's got some stupid
[1:13:08] things God buried the gold buried the
[1:13:10] silver buried the diamonds buried the
[1:13:13] coal buried all the minerals hid the oil
[1:13:16] I mean like bless God if you didn't hide
[1:13:17] the oil I'm going to go find some become
[1:13:19] rich no he hid it all and he also hid
[1:13:23] you and he proved that by
[1:13:26] Nature you say how's he yeah he did that
[1:13:30] by ostriches ostriches or
[1:13:34] sorry how the pearls are
[1:13:36] made OST I can't speak English I took
[1:13:41] speech therapy in great too
[1:13:44] ostrich they had to be
[1:13:47] hurt to make a
[1:13:49] pearl but I don't want to be hurt bless
[1:13:51] God yeah don't worry you won't go in the
[1:13:53] Rapture then
[1:13:55] you know there's only going to be lame
[1:13:57] and hurt people going the Rapture Oh
[1:13:59] They'll be healed before they're lame oh
[1:14:00] yeah oh for sure you'll get a new body
[1:14:02] you see what I mean but oh bless God
[1:14:05] they really hurt me but think of how
[1:14:07] valuable you are and the longer and the
[1:14:11] Begger the
[1:14:13] heart
[1:14:16] uhhuh you know we were in the
[1:14:17] Philippines and that was a long time ago
[1:14:20] nine years ago me and lamia were in the
[1:14:21] Philippines and I went to an SM Mall and
[1:14:25] we've seen a pearl necklace and they
[1:14:27] their exchange on their money I think
[1:14:28] it's about $57 to
[1:14:30] one and they had a necklace there it was
[1:14:34] like 6,000 Canadian I think it was
[1:14:36] around 5,000
[1:14:37] us but bless God we don't want to be
[1:14:44] hurt that's because the world has no
[1:14:46] value to it amen the only value is in
[1:14:51] the people of God and it's because of
[1:14:53] the character and the tribe that God put
[1:14:55] you through amen he said God never
[1:14:58] allowed this pain for without without a
[1:15:00] purpose he said your greatest ministry
[1:15:04] will come out by your
[1:15:06] greatest
[1:15:09] hurt the greater your
[1:15:11] hurt and how you take the
[1:15:14] pain and you just walk away with
[1:15:21] keeping the prophet said it like this he
[1:15:23] said if you give a cow enough rope
[1:15:24] she'll hang
[1:15:26] herself all she has to do is just stand
[1:15:30] quiet she'll be just
[1:15:33] fine
[1:15:35] amen hallelujah he said the things that
[1:15:38] you're going through now are really
[1:15:41] nothing to be
[1:15:43] compared let's turn to Romans 8:14 And1
[1:15:46] 17 and many that are led by the spirit
[1:15:49] of God they are the sons of God for ye
[1:15:51] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:15:54] again to fear but ye have received the
[1:15:56] spirit of adoption wherein we cry ABA
[1:15:59] father and the spirit itself beareth
[1:16:01] witness with our spirit that's how you
[1:16:03] that's your character that's how you
[1:16:06] control
[1:16:08] yourself your
[1:16:11] character beareth witness with our
[1:16:13] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:16:16] and if children then heirs and Heirs of
[1:16:18] God and join HS with Christ and if so
[1:16:21] that we oh there we go again
[1:16:26] suffer with
[1:16:27] him why why do we got to do
[1:16:33] that if so that we suffer with him that
[1:16:36] we may also Glory together with him for
[1:16:41] I reckon that the present suffering of
[1:16:43] this time and you've went through some
[1:16:46] Real Deals I know you
[1:16:48] have I've went through some of them too
[1:16:51] and they weren't
[1:16:52] pretty I had to take a few days time up
[1:16:58] maybe in your own individual family amen
[1:17:01] or in your church family your walk with
[1:17:04] Christ but God made you a better
[1:17:08] person man for what you went through
[1:17:10] you're better now than you were before
[1:17:13] you would have sidestepped that but it
[1:17:15] was all God's plan am man for the
[1:17:18] compared to the glory that'll be
[1:17:21] revealed in us oh my imagine what will
[1:17:25] look like in the in the eyes of Christ a
[1:17:28] pearl of amazing price God help
[1:17:32] us God help us here in First Peter and
[1:17:36] just laying some scriptures to to show
[1:17:38] you how much the Bible talks about 1
[1:17:40] Peter 28-23 servants be subject unto
[1:17:43] your master with all fear not only to
[1:17:46] the good and the gentle but also to the
[1:17:48] forward and be thankworthy if a man of
[1:17:53] conscience towards God endure grief
[1:17:56] suffering
[1:17:57] wrongfully he's saying be thankful if
[1:18:00] you're treated
[1:18:01] wrongfully now
[1:18:05] well I I've not so sure about that
[1:18:10] one for what glory is it if when ye are
[1:18:14] buffeted that your faults that you shall
[1:18:17] take it shall take it patiently but if
[1:18:20] when you do well and suffer for it you
[1:18:24] take it patiently this is
[1:18:28] acceptable with
[1:18:30] God that's amazing is this amazing to
[1:18:34] anybody
[1:18:36] else it was all part of God's plan he
[1:18:40] don't want something that don't have a
[1:18:42] great baked Perl in it he wants one of
[1:18:44] those great baked ones at the center of
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:48] necklace
[1:18:50] Hallelujah for even here unto were ye
[1:18:54] called

[1:18:59] and Daughters of God you'd be all like
[1:19:01] woo woo woo woo but you're called to
[1:19:03] suffer oh well no human
[1:19:07] like where unto ye are called because
[1:19:10] Christ also suffered amen so when we go
[1:19:14] to the mission field we we we preach on
[1:19:16] predestination called an election
[1:19:19] everybody's like
[1:19:20] wow but you get to suffer too
[1:19:27] hello no
[1:19:32] thanks because Christ also suffered for
[1:19:35] us leaving us an example there you go
[1:19:38] remember I said I was an unfair
[1:19:39] Advantage because I have an example of a
[1:19:41] real
[1:19:42] father an example that we should follow
[1:19:47] our Heavenly Father's Footsteps and our
[1:19:51] heavenly father is Christ the anointing
[1:19:55] one who did no sin neither was G found
[1:19:59] in his mouth whom when he was reviled
[1:20:03] and his children spoke back to him in
[1:20:06] disrespect and
[1:20:09] disgust he reviled not
[1:20:15] again and when he suffered he threatened
[1:20:19] not but committed himself to him that
[1:20:22] judges righteously
[1:20:25] wow are we his
[1:20:28] children do we have the character that
[1:20:30] Christ had are we the fathers that our
[1:20:33] heavenly father seen before the
[1:20:36] foundation of the world that planned
[1:20:37] that we would raise he would put us over
[1:20:40] over uh with his with his family and and
[1:20:44] and give us little charges over the
[1:20:47] sections of God's
[1:20:49] family or are we Silver Spoon Young Rich
[1:20:53] brats
[1:20:59] uhuh 1 Peter 3:4 but let it be hidden
[1:21:03] the hidden man of the heart this is this
[1:21:06] is always preached towards wives but you
[1:21:09] know I just like the gospel where it
[1:21:11] applies to the men and the women it just
[1:21:14] kind of flows really nice with me we
[1:21:16] expect our wives to be just little like
[1:21:18] passive
[1:21:19] little but God expects you to be the
[1:21:21] same way to him
[1:21:25] and let also the hidden men of the heart
[1:21:26] in which there is not corruptible even
[1:21:30] the origins of a
[1:21:32] Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the
[1:21:35] sight of God a real
[1:21:39] man great price oh bless God that's just
[1:21:43] for the women no it's
[1:21:44] not no it's not and on top of all that
[1:21:47] we're all women to
[1:21:49] God so there you go with that
[1:21:52] religion amen

[1:23:14] surrendering and there appeared unto him
[1:23:16] an angel from heaven strengthening him

[1:23:22] than you can take in your character he's
[1:23:24] just there he'll just feed just just
[1:23:26] keep it together you're almost through
[1:23:28] this TR you know I got great comfort for
[1:23:31] you if you fail in your trial to get
[1:23:34] character God will give it to you
[1:23:37] again I've went through some of them a
[1:23:40] lot of
[1:23:42] times after a few dozen times I'm

[1:24:02] in
[1:24:04] agony agony's character suffering and
[1:24:07] being in agony he prayed the more
[1:24:10] earnestly as it were sweat was as great
[1:24:13] drops of blood that fell down to the
[1:24:18] ground he you know he had the right to
[1:24:20] choose
[1:24:25] amen and you know what else so do you
[1:24:29] you have the right to choose I want to
[1:24:31] show you something and natural natural
[1:24:33] types of spiritualness story do you know
[1:24:35] that sheep
[1:24:37] blood is the only or one of the only uh
[1:24:42] antibiotics that they use to fight stin
[1:24:46] snag
[1:24:48] Venom some
[1:24:53] familiar now what are we compared as
[1:24:56] sheep now there's one catch to that
[1:25:00] picture you have to
[1:25:02] survive you can't give up or
[1:25:05] move so sheep in the
[1:25:08] natural that get bit by a poisonous
[1:25:11] snake go through Agony that's what
[1:25:14] Google says and torture and it's a very
[1:25:18] unpleasant
[1:25:21] experience but if they survive
[1:25:24] which is just holding it
[1:25:27] together then that
[1:25:29] blood is used to fight poisonous snake
[1:25:34] bites in
[1:25:38] people
[1:25:43] amen and God Made You his
[1:25:46] sheep and Satan is a
[1:25:49] Venom and when you survive your grace to
[1:25:54] your family to the world to the church
[1:25:57] to your brothers and sisters to the
[1:25:59] people you'd like to go whoop but you
[1:26:02] just
[1:26:05] go you know why because you
[1:26:10] survived
[1:26:13] amen it was Christ that took the bite of
[1:26:17] sin of the world for us and you say yes
[1:26:21] he survived and rose again on the third
[1:26:23] day
[1:26:25] and his whole
[1:26:27] life was to change me and you from the
[1:26:32] death of the
[1:26:34] bite that was sure to come in
[1:26:38] amen hallelujah and God declared it in
[1:26:42] his
[1:26:43] creation and took it and nailed himself
[1:26:46] on the cross character now anybody that
[1:26:50] wants to read that that's a lot more
[1:26:52] detailed about snake venom but brother
[1:26:55] Dale's not making that up they go
[1:26:57] through great torture and suffering just
[1:26:59] like when an eagle whatever when they
[1:27:02] what do they call me mol yeah and they
[1:27:04] go in and the other eagles feed them and
[1:27:07] their feathers all fall off in that
[1:27:10] amen God help us let's just close with
[1:27:13] some quotes and we're going to mention
[1:27:15] about Job here's the same example he
[1:27:17] said this is a positive the authority of
[1:27:19] a policeman he said it's not the
[1:27:21] policeman that stops a big 18wheeler
[1:27:24] brother Bart of that but it's the
[1:27:25] authority behind him and we we have not
[1:27:28] got that like we should the authority
[1:27:30] that we have he said never will here's
[1:27:33] our Prophet talking he said never will
[1:27:35] you ever make a Believer a Christian as
[1:27:39] long as you're afraid of expressing The
[1:27:42] Authority that was given to you by
[1:27:46] Christ amen oh bless God I'm a message
[1:27:50] believer but I'm afraid I'm a message
[1:27:53] believer but I don't have no testimony

[1:28:07] Christ we have the victory it's not that
[1:28:09] we we don't have anything he said it's
[1:28:12] not that we have to fight for the
[1:28:14] victory he said you already have the
[1:28:16] victory he said for he's made you a
[1:28:19] mighty conqueror in Christ amen
[1:28:25] I tell you that God gave the church an
[1:28:29] assignment one day and when Jesus was
[1:28:31] lifted up from Calvary Between Heaven
[1:28:34] and Earth and not other than God Emanuel
[1:28:37] bleeding out his blood upon the ground
[1:28:39] there was an sign lifted up to the
[1:28:43] people that we have conquered and we are
[1:28:47] more than conquerors because Christ
[1:28:49] conquered us we see job here and we're
[1:28:52] going to finish with job here
[1:28:54] he's and let's maybe you can turn to it
[1:28:56] job 19:23 to 27 and he said oh my here's
[1:29:00] job he's talking about he went through
[1:29:02] this trial job was perfect because of
[1:29:05] what he suffered he proved his
[1:29:07] Perfection because of what he suffered

[1:29:11] have you ever considered my servant
[1:29:13] job wow you know I I just wouldn't that
[1:29:18] be powerful to have God so much
[1:29:21] confidence in your character that God
[1:29:23] could say that each one of us I believe
[1:29:25] he will his pride I believe he does Amen

[1:30:05] that but God there's all kinds of things
[1:30:07] and we look right out we go oh I can't
[1:30:09] see I can't see my eyes are wide open I
[1:30:12] can't

[1:30:18] celebrate the little things that God do
[1:30:19] and God will bring more and more and
[1:30:21] more and man it's all there
[1:30:26] Hallelujah here's job talking about he
[1:30:28] say oh that my words would now be
[1:30:31] written and all that they would be
[1:30:33] printed in a book and he said that they
[1:30:35] would be graved in the iron pen and Led
[1:30:40] Led in the stone forever job's trying to
[1:30:43] share his experience that the whole
[1:30:46] world will never lose it for I know that
[1:30:49] my redeemer liveth and he shall stand in
[1:30:51] the latter day upon the Earth and though
[1:30:53] the SK worms eat this body yet in my
[1:30:56] exact flesh I shall see God whom I shall
[1:31:00] see not just through the bride but
[1:31:03] myself and my eyes Shall Behold Him and
[1:31:06] not
[1:31:07] another though my renss are consumed
[1:31:11] within
[1:31:13] me God help us to recognize the amazing
[1:31:17] things that God's done here in another
[1:31:20] quote here he said here's our prophet
[1:31:24] and I I'm I'm winding down he said
[1:31:25] unless you suffer with him you cannot
[1:31:27] reign with him we have to suffer to rain
[1:31:29] and the reason that the character simply
[1:31:31] is never made without suffering
[1:31:36] amen how
[1:31:39] come just think about that spiritually
[1:31:42] just think about your spiritually your
[1:31:44] relationship with Christ and other
[1:31:47] people in your life it was for your good
[1:31:52] it was totally for your good
[1:31:54] amen if we become mature we'll actually
[1:31:57] get
[1:31:58] along because we're going to always be
[1:32:00] different and we're always going to be
[1:32:03] unique and what's important to one won't
[1:32:05] be but we can come together amen and
[1:32:07] it's to careful he said character is a
[1:32:09] victory not a gift he said man without
[1:32:11] character can't reain because the power
[1:32:14] apart from character is satanic but the
[1:32:17] power of character is fit to rule and
[1:32:19] since he wants us to share on his throne
[1:32:21] remember remember who's going to judge
[1:32:24] the
[1:32:25] world
[1:32:27] uh-huh you and I want you to judge my
[1:32:30] friends just
[1:32:32] perfect I don't want you to vote me out
[1:32:35] when you hear Brother Dale stop out and
[1:32:36] say
[1:32:37] whoa that person was kind to me take it
[1:32:41] easy you better not
[1:32:46] uhhuh he set down on the father's throne
[1:32:49] and when we have overcome we can sit
[1:32:51] with
[1:32:52] him our little temp temporary suffering
[1:32:54] that we go through now is not worthy to
[1:32:56] be compared he said let's just jump down
[1:32:58] he said think it not strange concerning
[1:33:01] the fiery trials that you go through wow
[1:33:03] bless God if we went to a good church
[1:33:04] they wouldn't be no problems if there
[1:33:07] wasn't no problems you wouldn't even be
[1:33:08] a
[1:33:10] believer you wouldn't even be
[1:33:15] converted it's not strange God wants us
[1:33:18] to develop the Christ I'm reading this
[1:33:20] what the proph Christlike character that
[1:33:22] comes through
[1:33:24] suffering a real Godly
[1:33:27] father can shut up and put
[1:33:30] up amen and we H have trials and amen
[1:33:35] let's just jump through Hebrews 12 uh 6
[1:33:38] and 8 for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:33:41] chastises and scornest every son whom he
[1:33:43] receiveth but if you are without
[1:33:45] chastisement therefore you
[1:33:47] are therefore all are partakers then ye
[1:33:51] are bastards and not Sons amen God help
[1:33:56] us there's no True
[1:33:59] Believer oh bless God we have always had
[1:34:03] a wonderful pastor and the church has
[1:34:05] never had any
[1:34:08] problems you'll never go in the
[1:34:12] Rapture there is not any True Believers
[1:34:15] that are free from
[1:34:17] it I praise God that you get a bad I
[1:34:21] mean not really but
[1:34:24] but it's for our trials are for a
[1:34:28] perfecting every not One True Believer
[1:34:30] is free from it this is of
[1:34:33] God bless God I don't like the ministry
[1:34:37] I don't like my sisters this is the will
[1:34:40] of God and it's and I'm reading okay is
[1:34:43] that all right and it's
[1:34:45] needful I don't like that
[1:34:48] part I'm not going to preach on this no
[1:34:51] more we need the Lord to teach us the
[1:34:54] truth that we are to
[1:34:57] suffer and be Christlike in doing
[1:35:01] it love suffereth long in His Kind
[1:35:04] Matthew 51 and 12 blessed Whom The man
[1:35:08] shall re revile you and persecute you
[1:35:10] and shall do all manner of evil against

[1:35:20] great is your reward in heaven and so p
[1:35:23] persecuted you the
[1:35:25] prophets you know 6 months ago back or
[1:35:31] so I just have one quote and a
[1:35:38] scripture six months ago or maybe longer
[1:35:41] maybe it was a year ago we had some
[1:35:43] people come by
[1:35:45] unexpectedly and they were asking
[1:35:47] us
[1:35:51] about things that have happened happen
[1:35:53] in this
[1:35:55] area and we were sitting in my
[1:35:58] house you know and there's things you
[1:36:02] say oh bless God well there were things
[1:36:04] that
[1:36:06] happened and they were
[1:36:10] true and they were really
[1:36:13] pushing really pushing were they really
[1:36:18] pushing
[1:36:20] somehow somehow by God's amazing gra I
[1:36:24] said that's not my de
[1:36:26] business somehow that wasn't the Dale
[1:36:30] that wasn't the Dale that that was one
[1:36:34] time that the Dale never spoke
[1:36:36] up I had a right
[1:36:41] to I mean the Dale thought I had a right
[1:36:44] to that's a better way to say
[1:36:47] it and I answered them and I said that's
[1:36:50] not my department to disperse that to
[1:36:52] You' and you know they left our house
[1:36:55] and the next week me and the way were
[1:36:57] there I was probably listening to my
[1:36:59] Bible
[1:37:00] oh man am I happy God help me do that it
[1:37:04] was just like who how did I do
[1:37:12] it sometimes even the
[1:37:15] truth don't need to be
[1:37:19] spoken because Satan will hear it
[1:37:23] do you know why some people believe the
[1:37:25] seventh seal is still a
[1:37:29] mystery it's because it's not by the
[1:37:33] way and the prophet said that Christ
[1:37:36] revealed
[1:37:37] it but it couldn't be
[1:37:41] spoken because Satan would hear
[1:37:44] it and so it's a non-spoken Like Love
[1:37:49] Letter like
[1:37:54] huh that the bride would catch and that
[1:37:57] you watch the prophet he' go around the
[1:37:59] bush and around the bush and around the
[1:38:01] bush right in the seventh seal he said
[1:38:02] it's not a mystery Christ revealed it he
[1:38:04] revealed it mean him but if you listen
[1:38:07] to it like what did he
[1:38:14] say amen God help
[1:38:18] us job's life when the trials and
[1:38:21] temptations came God job took took God's
[1:38:24] provided way the sacrifice of the blood
[1:38:26] and burning the offerings and he stood
[1:38:28] on it and when the trials and tests came
[1:38:30] and that you know what came in job's
[1:38:32] life they said oh you're a secret Sinner
[1:38:34] and you're a loser and you know you've
[1:38:36] all heard those probably things you're
[1:38:38] not you you got a past life and a hidden
[1:38:41] oh who
[1:38:46] cares when the trials and testing came
[1:38:48] well if that had it just been a
[1:38:51] denomination or a religion religion he'd
[1:38:54] have fell a long time ago if it had just
[1:38:57] been proven by
[1:38:59] science he would also fell a long time
[1:39:02] ago but because everything that he was
[1:39:05] taken everything was taken from him his
[1:39:07] children was taken his riches his health
[1:39:10] and everything even his wife turned
[1:39:12] against
[1:39:13] him and his boyo job said
[1:39:18] why his wife told him to even Curse God
[1:39:21] and guy and he said you speaketh like a
[1:39:24] foolish
[1:39:25] person he didn't say that she was
[1:39:28] foolish but people speak like a foolish
[1:39:32] person he said the lord gave and the
[1:39:34] lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[1:39:37] the Lord see job never had a
[1:39:40] kingdom didn't matter to him he was a
[1:39:43] Believer he was a Christian and made no
[1:39:47] difference to him what happened because
[1:39:49] he was still a Christian so it didn't
[1:39:51] matter if the pastor shook his hand
[1:39:52] didn't matter if
[1:39:54] the pastor didn't show up didn't matter
[1:39:55] if the pastor preach long didn't matter
[1:39:56] if you preach short didn't matter if you
[1:39:58] had didn't matter if you made no
[1:40:00] difference didn't matter if his kids
[1:40:02] died his wealth died didn't matter if we
[1:40:03] planned a crop or not you know my
[1:40:05] brother I was talking to my brother and
[1:40:07] sometimes he you know God uses donkey
[1:40:09] sometimes not that my brother's a donkey
[1:40:10] he's my best friend in the flesh and I
[1:40:13] was telling my brother I said oh man I
[1:40:14] got field of beans not planting said D
[1:40:16] don't worry about it said you can't take
[1:40:17] it with
[1:40:18] you he's like you'll probably still live
[1:40:21] in the same Farm if you don't plant that
[1:40:23] field the be well guess what he's
[1:40:26] probably actually
[1:40:28] right but we're
[1:40:29] [Laughter]
[1:40:37] like God just God just giving you the
[1:40:40] old fishing rod and
[1:40:41] see that's how God taught brother Bram
[1:40:44] how to
[1:40:45] fish brother Bram listened to the other
[1:40:49] brothers that made him excited and he
[1:40:52] jerked too soon God said I never told
[1:40:56] you that I never told you and he just
[1:40:59] got a little tiny
[1:41:02] mle but it was the character of just
[1:41:06] waiting for the good
[1:41:09] stuff
[1:41:11] amen hallelujah let's finish this quote
[1:41:13] here and when he come down to his
[1:41:15] comforters and the church members and
[1:41:17] they come down and they accuse him
[1:41:19] you've all had this happen to you job
[1:41:23] and he knowed that he was righteous
[1:41:25] because he wasn't trusting in their own
[1:41:27] mer in his own merits but he met God's
[1:41:30] requirement because he stood on the
[1:41:32] blood sacrifice he said yes sir I
[1:41:34] knoweth I know that he was righteous
[1:41:38] because he met God's requirement let's
[1:41:41] turn to First Timothy and we just got
[1:41:43] two scriptures and we'll close here 1
[1:41:45] Timothy
[1:41:46] 3 1 and 4 10 and 12 and 14 this I know
[1:41:51] also that in the last days the perilous
[1:41:53] time shall come and Men shall be lovers
[1:41:55] of their own self Covetous boasters
[1:41:58] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:42:01] unthankful and
[1:42:03] Unholy without natural affections truth
[1:42:06] speakers false accusers incompetent F
[1:42:09] despisers of those that do
[1:42:12] good verse four traitors and heady and
[1:42:15] high-m minded and lovers of pleasure
[1:42:17] more than lovers of god let's verse jump
[1:42:19] to verse 10 but whom hast thou Hast
[1:42:22] fully known my Doctrine now this is Paul
[1:42:25] talking to the
[1:42:27] church but whom has fully known my
[1:42:31] Doctrine the manner of life and the
[1:42:35] purpose and Faith Longs suffering we
[1:42:40] could throw character in there
[1:42:43] longsuffering charity which is love and
[1:42:47] patient now watch here Paul's telling
[1:42:50] the church the state of the world but he
[1:42:52] said this is our
[1:42:54] Doctrine you're to have
[1:42:57] character
[1:42:59] longsuffering and patient and love it
[1:43:03] the character was the purpose of
[1:43:07] Faith Hallelujah verse
[1:43:15] 11 he's talking about his
[1:43:18] persecution and if you go through that
[1:43:20] but out of them all the Lord deliver me
[1:43:22] verse verse 12 yay all that will live
[1:43:25] Godly in Christ Jesus oh I don't like
[1:43:29] that
[1:43:30] part bless God I think we should
[1:43:35] move you know sometimes I'm a
[1:43:38] whiner we went through a whole week and
[1:43:40] the kids never come by at night and we
[1:43:42] were waiting for the sunshine to come
[1:43:44] out we're just sitting in the house all
[1:43:45] night I said honey we used to go see my
[1:43:47] mom and dad all the time if we never had
[1:43:48] nothing to do I said we should move
[1:43:51] away if we move to another country then
[1:43:54] they'd have something to cry about we're
[1:43:56] right no nobody cares we're next door
[1:43:59] yeah 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00 9:00 10:00
[1:44:03] 11:00 should we go to bed honey I guess
[1:44:05] it's going to rain
[1:44:08] tomorrow
[1:44:11] huh yay we are all that live Godly in
[1:44:14] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:44:18] every one of us have tried and have run
[1:44:23] from suffering that was given by God and
[1:44:26] we actually accused somebody else of
[1:44:29] what God was
[1:44:30] doing and I'm
[1:44:33] guilty I have that t-shirt too and God's
[1:44:37] like it was
[1:44:43] Meen but continue thou verse 14 but
[1:44:46] continue thou in the things which thou
[1:44:49] Hast
[1:44:50] learned and Hast been assured
[1:44:53] of knowing of whom thou Hast learned
[1:44:57] them that's a sound
[1:44:59] Doctrine the character of Christ our
[1:45:01] last verse Genesis 18 and 19 and this is
[1:45:05] what God has put in charge of you
[1:45:08] fathers and mothers and families and the
[1:45:10] family of God remember that God was a
[1:45:13] self-existing one until he spoke you in
[1:45:16] his
[1:45:17] thoughts and the prophet said then he
[1:45:20] was a family man is and he wasn't
[1:45:23] self-existing anymore cuz he
[1:45:26] dwelt with his
[1:45:29] family Genesis 18 and 19 for I know him
[1:45:33] that he
[1:45:36] will command his children and his
[1:45:39] household after him and they shall keep
[1:45:42] the way of the Lord and do just and
[1:45:45] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[1:45:49] Abraham that which he has spoken
[1:45:54] of
[1:45:55] him I pray that God would trust me
[1:45:58] enough that in
[1:46:01] time he trust me a little
[1:46:06] bit because of time and character amen
[1:46:12] God help us let's
[1:46:16] stand I trust as fathers you know that
[1:46:20] were not like I said sometimes whiners
[1:46:22] and that we'll be mature and and deal
[1:46:26] with
[1:46:28] uh things that we need to deal with and
[1:46:32] and
[1:46:34] uh and have the character of Christ you
[1:46:38] know and I'm closing with this I
[1:46:42] promise that's still a mystery to me how
[1:46:48] God had to put himself through suffering
[1:46:52] I that if if you got it all figured out
[1:46:54] you can talk to me I I'll I'll gladly
[1:46:56] listen how God that was perfect chose by
[1:47:00] choice to suffer like but he was already
[1:47:04] perfect there was
[1:47:07] character and there's no way that we
[1:47:09] were perfect like
[1:47:11] him and we got to have a lot more
[1:47:13] suffering him but our the whole society
[1:47:16] that we live in and the whole atmosphere
[1:47:18] and spirit and everything is to flee
[1:47:23] from suffering God help God help me God
[1:47:28] help me it won't kill you it won't kill
[1:47:33] you I'd like to be
[1:47:36] Christlike and I'd like to have the
[1:47:39] character a portion of it that he had
[1:47:43] amen amen
[1:47:49] hallelujah be it unto to
[1:47:55] me according to thy
[1:48:00] will according to thy
[1:48:06] promises I can
