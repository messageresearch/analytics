[33:01] ticket your plane ticket and that kind
[33:05] of affected everything else but I still
[33:07] didn't feel like uh to go and I've kind
[33:10] of I've kind of somewhat told them that
[33:12] if they can find somebody else but you
[33:14] know the day after I told him I wasn't

[37:10] king and nobody recognized it that's
[37:13] right his own family didn't recognize it
[37:16] the nation did not recognize it the

[44:36] consumed with the surroundings around
[44:39] them David had really good example to be
[44:42] beaten
[44:43] down oh I if I would have been David I

[47:23] looking for royalty you didn't recognize

[47:32] you and you say woo this don't this home
[47:36] don't feel quite right that's
[47:40] right
[47:43] amen it never ever shows that David

[47:58] riches nobody's recognizing your
[48:02] ministry you all have a
[48:04] Ministry hello nobody's recognizing your
[48:11] ministry nobody's recognizing you as a
[48:15] person they're all looking at some
[48:18] [Music]
[48:21] big but there's one
[48:23] person Jehovah Gyra amen that he's
[48:27] recognizing who were in his
[48:30] thoughts before the foundation of the
[48:34] world Amen you know it's so easy as
[48:39] humans we're still humans and you know
[48:42] and and I I you know we I just believe
[48:45] God's bringing us to a to a Capstone I
[48:48] just believe he's bringing us to a
[48:50] maturity and so like when we become
[48:53] mature we'll cry less
[48:58] brother Dale will cry less if you and
[49:00] every one of you heard me complain or
[49:02] why so when you see me come to that
[49:05] maturity I'll cry or whine
[49:08] less because did God make a mistake no
[49:12] well no no he didn't make a mistake so
[49:14] then why am I
[49:15] whining and and you see what I mean so
[49:17] we're going to we're going to kind of
[49:18] come out of the effects of the Flesh and
[49:21] and come into the the watch
[49:24] this how how God had to tell his prophet
[49:28] Samuel I mean a Vindicated Prophet like
[49:31] no no doubts about this he said I don't
[49:35] see like you see I don't see great
[49:38] Ministries and little Ministries I don't
[49:41] see great special singers and little
[49:45] special singers I don't see great
[49:47] testimonies and little testimonies I
[49:50] don't see great healings and little tiny
[49:54] healings I see the heart amen amen I see
[49:58] the heart I see the desire of the heart
[50:02] is yearning yearning you know our
[50:04] Prophet said this he said I would rather
[50:05] have somebody with the wrong Doctrine
[50:08] and the right Spirit than the right now
[50:11] than the right Doctrine and the wrong
[50:12] Spirit now now that ain't to say that
[50:14] that's not to say we should be wrong
[50:16] because we know the truth so you
[50:20] know but you know when we sat across the
[50:22] people at the
[50:24] table they don't look like you
[50:27] and they're
[50:28] weeping in a public place where you
[50:32] would be embarrassed to say grace over
[50:33] your meal they're weeping
[50:36] uncontrollably to obey
[50:40] God the Bible says that anybody that
[50:43] desires to be
[50:45] filled God will fill them God will fill
[50:48] them God for sure will fill
[50:51] them you can't have a desire that strong
[50:55] I'd say well you know you no no no
[50:57] that's not who we
[50:59] serve amen so God don't see the
[51:03] different levels of respects see the
[51:06] prophet thought that Jesse's first son
[51:09] was for sure going to be the king while
[51:11] he was the eldest well he had been
[51:14] around the longest he had the most
[51:16] wisdom he had the stature and
[51:19] countenance he had the delivery that was
[51:21] amazing to speak in the Kingdom of the
[51:25] you know the Thrones of he was going to
[51:27] conquer the
[51:33] world and God told the prophet he said I
[51:35] can see their heart
[51:37] too and it's not the one I
[51:40] choose it's not the one I choose amen
[51:43] it's so different than our human thing
[51:45] you know and so here you
[51:49] know you are forgot about people you are
[51:54] like not even recognized
[51:57] well you know you know in the world they
[51:59] would say well what church you go to
[52:01] well what denomination is that I don't
[52:03] recognize
[52:06] you right they didn't recognize David
[52:08] either don't you have any more Sons well
[52:11] just this little runny ugly you know
[52:14] squirt and he smells like sheep and the
[52:18] Bible says he was runty and
[52:22] ugly said he had no natural beauty
[52:28] How could a young boy
[52:31] be no natural
[52:35] beauty amen let's look at
[52:44] that now he was with runty and with with
[52:48] all of all Beauty countenance he was
[52:52] ugly now if he was ugly at 10 I wouldn't
[52:55] want to see him at
[53:00] 57
[53:02] wow
[53:06] amen God help
[53:08] us see God has something for you and you
[53:12] need to recognize who you are for us to
[53:16] recognize our position in Christ you
[53:18] will you know when David look at this
[53:20] and I'm way ahead of my notes but you
[53:22] know when David was was King and he went
[53:24] out in the Army and the people come back
[53:26] fact the Israelite people wanted to
[53:27] Stone David because the other countries
[53:31] had come in and taken their wives
[53:35] captive and you know what the Bible says
[53:37] now that's just at the end of my notes
[53:38] the Bible says that David encouraged
[53:45] himself that's fairly
[53:47] personal he said God I know I'm you you
[53:50] could pray and you say God I know I'm
[53:52] yours because I never chose you God God
[53:55] chose you and you Vindicated it to me
[53:57] and it made it a personal relationship
[54:00] and you revealed yourself to me and you
[54:03] took the scales off my eyes and you
[54:05] showed me that you're my husband and I'm
[54:08] your
[54:09] bride chosen
[54:12] anointed an anointed
[54:15] people wow you know the meaning of
[54:19] Christ in Greek is
[54:22] anointing and the meaning of Christ in
[54:25] the Hebrew
[54:27] is
[54:28] Messiah now that is
[54:30] exactly what is tabernacled inside of
[54:33] you if you have the baptism of the Holy
[54:35] Ghost so you are the anointed messiah in
[54:40] Greek
[54:41] Hebrew because the Bible says that it's
[54:44] no longer I that liveth but Christ Jesus
[54:46] that liveth inside of
[54:48] me how in the world could you have
[54:52] a quiet day how in the world could you
[54:55] be the royalty of a throne with the
[54:59] world as your foot
[55:02] stol and say well I had kind of a quiet
[55:05] passive day
[55:07] today
[55:09] woo because you don't
[55:12] recognize who you are that's right you
[55:15] don't recognize the deity is not in
[55:20] heaven right deity is an
[55:25] earth y amen amen and the world is your
[55:29] foot stol and we watch far brother Dale
[55:32] watches far too much news but it can be
[55:35] in some countries a Time piece for our
[55:37] going home but you see how we're Chosen
[55:40] and anointed people and no matter what
[55:43] people say you know you know if you're
[55:45] breathing today there'll be people that
[55:47] don't like you don't worry about them
[55:50] say praise the Lord I'm sorry I'm I'm
[55:54] sorry I disturb you just breathing but
[55:58] Hallelujah I'm
[56:01] breathing you
[56:05] know we all know that if you do anything
[56:08] for Christ you'll be attacked and we
[56:11] don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[56:14] but against spirits that are anointed on
[56:18] people that if you're trying to do
[56:20] something kind the body of Christ
[56:27] wow
[56:29] amazing what God had you know and I I
[56:33] want to show you
[56:34] this brother Dale's still
[56:38] here David was
[56:41] anointed chosen
[56:48] royalty and he went
[56:52] played for his
[56:57] and he played without getting paid for
[57:00] his
[57:01] enemy and he tried to assist his enemy
[57:06] and getting the evil spirit off of his
[57:10] enemy that the very same God that
[57:13] anointed
[57:15] David had put on
[57:18] him
[57:23] woohoo wow
[57:29] wow somebody that's trying to kill your
[57:35] character you would go and sing them a
[57:38] special and visit them in their home and
[57:41] take them you know shepherd's pie and
[57:44] say praise the Lord I need to do that
[57:46] you know that really and more than pray
[57:49] for them take them shepherd's pie and
[57:51] maybe give them you know something and
[57:55] send them
[57:58] flowers wait a minute wait a minute wait
[58:00] a minute D David knew that the prophet
[58:04] had anointed
[58:05] him to be
[58:07] king but there was one thing that David
[58:10] knew
[58:12] too and that was God's time that's right
[58:16] that's right that's
[58:18] right he knew David knew exactly who he
[58:21] was but he didn't push God yeah that's
[58:25] right
[58:27] J bless God I better I better go
[58:29] Minister somewhere bless God I better I
[58:32] better start up and and I mean we we
[58:35] need some more bless God startups cuz
[58:38] cuz we're afraid of starting anything
[58:40] but but David waited on God's
[58:45] time it wouldn't have been super easy
[58:47] waiting when when uh when the spears
[58:50] were shining in the sun all pointing at
[58:53] you and you were hiding in the cave
[59:00] wow David went by choice because the
[59:04] king asked for anybody that could take
[59:07] the thing off of him that God had
[59:09] allowed to go on him the evil spirit and
[59:12] they said well we know this Jesse son
[59:14] and he plays
[59:16] the really
[59:20] beautiful you don't think David knew
[59:22] what was
[59:23] happening you don't think David knew
[59:25] that he was anointed by the prophet to
[59:27] be king and would take over the kingdom
[59:29] and he was going to the one
[59:35] whoa I'm not so
[59:38] sure am I David
[59:42] yet are you David
[59:47] yet
[59:50] wow
[59:52] amen help us Jesus you know I want to
[59:55] show show you something David never had
[59:58] a crown
[59:59] yet you don't have a crown yet but it's
[1:00:03] coming David never had his royalty robe
[1:00:07] yet but yours is
[1:00:09] coming he never had his throne yet that
[1:00:13] he was sitting on it's it's prepared or
[1:00:16] being
[1:00:17] prepared he never had the kingdom under
[1:00:20] his foot stol
[1:00:23] yet he never had the this is something
[1:00:26] you don't have he never had
[1:00:30] safety
[1:00:33] yet David never had
[1:00:35] safety but he was no
[1:00:38] anointed and he was
[1:00:40] chosen but he didn't think he had
[1:00:43] safety not when he was running for his
[1:00:45] life and hiding in
[1:00:48] caves he wasn't
[1:00:51] respected I know that touches many of
[1:00:54] you probably of us by different type of
[1:00:58] people he wasn't respected was not
[1:01:01] respected let me let me David wasn't
[1:01:04] respected by the Israelites
[1:01:07] hello you are not respected by what are
[1:01:11] called Israelites just fill in the blank
[1:01:14] there you know the word to put in
[1:01:17] there by people that say they
[1:01:20] are you're not don't don't don't pretend
[1:01:23] you are I know I know what you're you're
[1:01:26] alive I'm
[1:01:29] alive
[1:01:31] yet but he was still the
[1:01:34] bride and the people from another Nation
[1:01:37] the
[1:01:38] Hittites like Uriah that David robbed
[1:01:41] his
[1:01:43] wife would sacrifice their
[1:01:45] life they would sacrifice everything to
[1:01:49] go get the water down in the well that
[1:01:52] David used to drink out of insanity
[1:01:56] to fight through the Israelite Army in
[1:01:58] complete
[1:02:00] Insanity but they would they would just
[1:02:02] drop their lives off like dominoes to
[1:02:05] honor a
[1:02:06] man that never had all those
[1:02:10] things because they had read the read
[1:02:12] the last chapter of the
[1:02:14] book and they had recognized the
[1:02:17] Revelation inside here that they
[1:02:20] couldn't see it with their eyes but they
[1:02:22] knew he was the
[1:02:24] man they knew that he was the anointed
[1:02:28] bride he would be the anointed
[1:02:33] king soon not
[1:02:37] yet
[1:02:38] time time we struggle with
[1:02:43] time
[1:02:44] amen you know like this just a small
[1:02:48] example like I told Leno I said I don't
[1:02:49] think I can come right now and the next
[1:02:52] day there was many many thousands come
[1:02:56] into our bank
[1:02:57] account maybe I told him one day too
[1:03:01] soon time maybe May I'm not saying I did
[1:03:04] but you see what I mean
[1:03:06] time David
[1:03:08] waited on
[1:03:14] time
[1:03:16] wow those men of David recognized even
[1:03:20] when the the people around him should
[1:03:22] have recognized they recognized that
[1:03:25] David would be the coming King you
[1:03:28] sitting here this morning do you realize
[1:03:30] that you're going to be or already are
[1:03:32] the coming queen amen that's
[1:03:34] unbelievable do you know you're going to
[1:03:36] have servants in heaven you're going to
[1:03:39] say I like green grapes and I want them
[1:03:41] bake I want the ones that you know you
[1:03:43] got take two men to carry a Vine and and
[1:03:46] and just put one in about every two or
[1:03:48] three minutes make sure you clean them
[1:03:51] good think about that the Jews our
[1:03:54] Prophet said
[1:03:56] yeah will be our
[1:03:58] servants yes and and we we recognize
[1:04:04] that because we're not
[1:04:06] yet we struggle yeah let's look at what
[1:04:11] the prophet said he said did you notice
[1:04:12] how God moved Israel into his own
[1:04:16] anointed
[1:04:20] time now listen this is going to mean
[1:04:23] something Joshua waited for for
[1:04:27] time not how matter or how much the
[1:04:31] people might say it didn't make no
[1:04:33] difference to Joshua what the people say
[1:04:35] I mean he had the odds against them I
[1:04:37] mean wow couple million to
[1:04:40] two God gave us this land it's our
[1:04:43] Promised Land let us go now and take it
[1:04:46] and they said but Joshua you've lost
[1:04:49] your
[1:04:50] commission he said you're all washed up
[1:04:53] and I don't think you have the anointing
[1:04:55] now anymore
[1:04:58] they said this what the prop said why
[1:05:00] you won't even have nothing to do with
[1:05:02] the move of
[1:05:04] God probably some people's told you that
[1:05:08] before now how in the world when you
[1:05:11] were in the mind of God and came from
[1:05:14] God and God asked you permission to send
[1:05:16] you to Earth and and you got the baptism
[1:05:19] of the Holy Ghost how could you not have
[1:05:20] something to do with the plan of God
[1:05:22] hello
[1:05:26] you know I'm going to tell you
[1:05:28] something every one of you don't look
[1:05:32] for somebody else's approval that's
[1:05:35] right look for God's approval let God
[1:05:39] take care of the
[1:05:40] approving we don't need man's backing in
[1:05:43] your ministry we don't need man's
[1:05:45] approval on your salvation on your holy
[1:05:48] ghost on your
[1:05:51] election Hallelujah God's going to be

[1:06:39] of Holy Ghost you're going to measure up
[1:06:41] really amazing you're going to be

[1:07:53] sins of my youth yes amen that's what
[1:07:56] David cried for don't hold the sins of
[1:07:59] my youth to my charge cuz I that'll be a
[1:08:04] really bad day if you did and you know
[1:08:07] what God has no intention of doing that
[1:08:10] because you're Justified as if you never
[1:08:12] did in the first place it wasn't the
[1:08:13] real you you were tricked into it by the

[1:08:41] that there he was
[1:08:43] waiting for the promise all we're doing
[1:08:47] this morning is waiting for the
[1:08:50] yet it's already yours you already H our

[1:09:09] also God's working on our
[1:09:12] Crown it'll just fit like a
[1:09:15] glove and all the stars that'll be on
[1:09:17] your crown will be the ones that you
[1:09:19] went and played the violin
[1:09:22] for that had plotted to take you out
[1:09:27] brother Dale couldn't do
[1:09:30] it hey hey Saul threw the javelin at
[1:09:34] David that's
[1:09:35] right just let that sink in if you think
[1:09:39] you can do it let's just go to pakist I
[1:09:41] was invited to India the guy called me
[1:09:43] twice we'll go to India where if you're
[1:09:46] caught baptizing you
[1:09:48] probably going to drown
[1:09:51] you if you think you if you think you're
[1:09:53] David and you can play the
[1:09:56] violin why Saul is planning to throw the
[1:09:59] javelin at you when you're not even
[1:10:01] paying attention to him then let's go to
[1:10:07] India let's go to Pakistan where it
[1:10:09] ain't safe that's
[1:10:12] right well if it's God's will you'll be
[1:10:14] safer there than here but you see do you
[1:10:17] see how do you see how how we're going
[1:10:20] to mature and come up into this this
[1:10:23] thing not only you're going to recognize
[1:10:25] that you're part of God but you're going
[1:10:27] to recognize that nothing nobody's
[1:10:30] opinion testimony NE you don't you know
[1:10:33] what faith is zero negativity you know
[1:10:36] we talked about faith on Wednesday night
[1:10:38] Faith can't be
[1:10:40] negative faith is always
[1:10:43] positive the Rapture is positive the
[1:10:46] Holy Ghost is positive you know serving
[1:10:48] God's positive like so you're you're
[1:10:51] breaking up you're you're confusing me
[1:10:53] you know God's not the author of
[1:10:54] confusion so you're professing that
[1:10:56] you're a message believer you're
[1:10:58] professing you got faith you're
[1:10:59] professing you got the baptism Holy
[1:11:01] Ghost but then you're negative and I've
[1:11:02] been
[1:11:08] there why why was I
[1:11:11] there maybe I didn't
[1:11:14] recognize maybe I was looking at the
[1:11:16] outside instead of the heart that's
[1:11:19] right maybe I was I maybe I wasn't
[1:11:21] looking at the anointing and the chosen
[1:11:23] I was looking at my own right
[1:11:25] thoughts maybe I was
[1:11:28] looking
[1:11:30] wow
[1:11:32] amen see The Parables he said when the
[1:11:34] time come God gave Joshua and those who
[1:11:38] stayed with him he said they gave it the
[1:11:40] word for he could not trust others God
[1:11:44] gave it to his chosen amen
[1:11:48] elected God is going to give something
[1:11:51] he's already G it to his chosen elected
[1:11:54] many are called called that's right but
[1:11:57] chosen elected he's already already
[1:12:02] glorified you so he already sees me in
[1:12:06] with my crown and and I I believe I I
[1:12:08] pray to God there's stars in
[1:12:12] there but do you see it do I see yours
[1:12:17] see that's that's the struggle we
[1:12:19] have I'm not sure I see yours maybe I
[1:12:23] should pray just another hour it helps
[1:12:25] me pray cuz brother Brown said prayer
[1:12:27] sweetens your
[1:12:29] spirit it sweetens your spirit and
[1:12:31] humbles you wow let's read our text
[1:12:35] again he said 1 Peter 2 and and I I had
[1:12:38] this scripture down and I read it first
[1:12:40] but 1 Peter 2 4 and 5 he said whom you
[1:12:44] as unto Living Stones dis allowed indeed
[1:12:47] of men now that could be men and women
[1:12:51] so right there the Bible is telling you
[1:12:53] don't look at a approval from
[1:12:57] me or the one sitting beside
[1:13:00] you now if you get it that's really cool
[1:13:04] but that's not the that's not the
[1:13:06] absolute no no but chosen of God do you
[1:13:10] know most of the people that were chosen
[1:13:12] of God and stuck their neck out as you
[1:13:14] would say the whole world turned against
[1:13:17] them and they look like
[1:13:19] cockoo they looked like they weren't
[1:13:23] home but they hadn't met
[1:13:26] Moses had met somebody and it wasn't no
[1:13:30] fire that burned in a bush cuz the bush
[1:13:32] didn't burn he had met a
[1:13:36] being and Moses didn't go down to I
[1:13:39] wonder if I will go in the Rapture I
[1:13:43] wonder if God Will Set Me Free from this
[1:13:45] ugly
[1:13:47] body Moses went back there
[1:13:59] chosen of God and precious now now why
[1:14:02] do you want my approval if God says
[1:14:04] you're precious why do you want your
[1:14:07] brothers or sisters approval if he says
[1:14:09] you're
[1:14:10] chosen there's no place in the Bible
[1:14:12] where you got to get somebody else's
[1:14:14] approval they may give it to you if they
[1:14:16] come to maturity
[1:14:18] also and and praise God that we can have
[1:14:21] that and that's nice I'm not saying that
[1:14:24] but when we come to maturity this is an
[1:14:27] individual Affair we're not Jews he
[1:14:30] didn't save us by the country he saved
[1:14:32] us by individual he works with Jews as a
[1:14:35] country but he works with you individual
[1:14:37] and you may be ahead of me or behind me
[1:14:40] but it's you and God that that he's appr
[1:14:42] proven and shown when he gives you the
[1:14:44] Revelation that you're elected
[1:14:46] predestinated all the devils and
[1:14:49] government and churches and ministers
[1:14:53] and money in the World couldn't change
[1:14:56] your
[1:14:58] opinion amen there's no way in the world
[1:15:02] that's why if a minister can make you if
[1:15:04] you if I can make you believe my
[1:15:07] Doctrine then the next guy can make you
[1:15:09] disbelieve it that's
[1:15:11] right but if I show you a Doctrine in
[1:15:14] the Bible and God says that's it am was
[1:15:19] it me that showed it to you blessed are
[1:15:21] you Simon B Jonah for I never he was
[1:15:25] standing right in front of God Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ yes who Am I by Flesh and Blood
[1:15:30] by my Father in
[1:15:33] Heaven has revealed this unto you and
[1:15:35] upon the revelation of the rock of
[1:15:41] Jehovah watch this even Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ was was showing how Peter's
[1:15:51] Revelation was from the Anointed God yes
[1:15:57] that's amen the anointed
[1:16:01] one
[1:16:03] hallelujah amen verse 5 of this

[1:16:11] spiritual house that's your body a holy
[1:16:15] priesthood you know this is God that

[1:16:23] Priests I not really you know I'm sorry
[1:16:26] I I do like friends I do like partying
[1:16:29] but I'm not really concerned of your
[1:16:31] thoughts of
[1:16:32] me you know you know like some people
[1:16:35] like for example and I don't say this

[1:23:46] this maturity where where brother Dale
[1:23:48] stops crying and I stop complaining we
[1:23:50] just say hallelujah you don't I mean
[1:23:53] sister PTY likes me that's a poor
[1:23:54] example but you know Hallelujah somebody
[1:23:56] don't like me but Jehovah I mean I was
[1:23:58] speaking to him this morning am man you
[1:24:01] got to Reon you got to recognize your
[1:24:03] connection with God we're looking at
[1:24:05] each other's approval you you think the
[1:24:07] approval of a Ministry is if he's got a
[1:24:09] thousand people in the shirt that's not
[1:24:14] approval
[1:24:16] amen we're looking at we're looking at
[1:24:18] things we can see but God but you you're
[1:24:20] you're a God you're supposed to be
[1:24:22] looking at your own heart wait your own
[1:24:25] heart and you're saying wow I remember
[1:24:28] being look at when we preach that
[1:24:29] message about job he said I remember
[1:24:31] where were you when I laid the
[1:24:33] foundations of the world I remember when
[1:24:35] God said let there be I was right there
[1:24:38] I was the finger the
[1:24:41] pointed whoa
[1:24:44] Glory he said she's already United amen
[1:24:49] and because the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:24:51] come but the Rapture is going to be
[1:24:53] going to the wedding supper and see the
[1:24:55] word will unite the person and the two
[1:24:58] become one you know what I I I I'm
[1:25:01] afraid sometimes even brother Dale I
[1:25:03] tell you right pre and we we think we're
[1:25:07] Jews and we think we're only going to
[1:25:09] make it if if everybody's got approval
[1:25:11] of
[1:25:12] us you know what I'm saying God speaks
[1:25:15] to Israel as a
[1:25:17] nation we're not
[1:25:19] Israel God speaks to you
[1:25:22] individually that's right that's right
[1:25:24] and what he tells you it don't matter
[1:25:26] what I tell you it don't matter what
[1:25:28] somebody else tells you it don't matter
[1:25:29] what you're closest well I don't see it
[1:25:32] it's did you meet the pillar of fire
[1:25:34] yourself were you the Moses when he was
[1:25:37] right there and said take off your shoes
[1:25:38] you're messing up the
[1:25:40] ground can you imagine can you imagine
[1:25:43] the ground being so holy that his shoes
[1:25:45] were going to get the ground dirty
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:52] yeah right
[1:25:54] Revelations 1:6 and Christ made us Kings
[1:25:59] you you got to put this up cuz nobody's
[1:26:01] going to believe us Vicki Vicki's
[1:26:02] actually going to set up my iPad and one
[1:26:04] of these days we're going to plug it
[1:26:05] into the TV and you can actually see my
[1:26:07] notes and everything will come up quotes
[1:26:08] and everything he said and Christ has
[1:26:12] now I put the Christ in there because he
[1:26:14] says he has made us Kings and if you
[1:26:16] read up further it says Jesus Christ and
[1:26:19] it's Christ has made you Kings and
[1:26:21] Priests that's not the five-fold
[1:26:23] ministry that's not the prophet that's
[1:26:26] not the people that don't like you or do
[1:26:28] like you yeah it's fine if you get
[1:26:31] somebody else's approval and brother
[1:26:32] Dale would be the first one to like that
[1:26:35] but I'm not preaching to get people's
[1:26:37] approval if the whole world don't like
[1:26:39] me I still know what God told me amen
[1:26:44] he's made you Kings and Priests unto God
[1:26:46] and his father and to him be glory and
[1:26:48] Dominion
[1:26:51] forever that's right watch this in the
[1:26:54] in the another quote here Harmony
[1:26:55] between God and Christ see he said in
[1:26:57] John 57 19 I mean they were one I mean
[1:27:00] it's not two gods or three Gods it means
[1:27:03] god is a spirit and those that worship
[1:27:04] Him must worship Him in spirit and truth
[1:27:06] and and Christ is the anointed one
[1:27:08] that's what God is is Anointed Jehovah
[1:27:11] Gyra the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:27:13] and the
[1:27:14] end but brother BR here recognizes that
[1:27:17] there were one and it showed the word
[1:27:19] life and he showed her and she received
[1:27:21] it that's talking about you and you
[1:27:23] never doubt it and nothing can harm you
[1:27:25] even death and if the seed was planted
[1:27:28] in you that's a revelation you need to
[1:27:29] have that's right if the seed was
[1:27:32] planted in you and the water comes down
[1:27:34] don't worry about the water God will
[1:27:35] take care of that amen and then it's got
[1:27:37] a great potential he says hallelujah he
[1:27:39] said here's the
[1:27:41] secret he said you are the word the word
[1:27:44] is in the bride and you have you know
[1:27:46] you are Christ it's not hard to believe
[1:27:49] you got the mind of Christ because you
[1:27:50] are Christ ah God uh let me see uh you
[1:27:54] know I was oh forgive me it this just
[1:27:57] came to me I was watching some false
[1:27:59] prophets you know that I shouldn't have
[1:28:01] but you know it shows us where the real
[1:28:03] is yeah you know you don't have to call
[1:28:06] God up the cell phone and say God you
[1:28:07] know what do you want me to do for
[1:28:09] orders you know let me give you an
[1:28:12] example you know when Jesus prayed he
[1:28:13] said you know father take this cup from
[1:28:15] me but not my will but yours be done who
[1:28:17] was he praying
[1:28:19] to you know sometimes as kids we tell
[1:28:22] our kids to look up cuz God's up there
[1:28:24] well he's up there too but he's down
[1:28:26] there
[1:28:27] too Jesus was praying to himself cuz he
[1:28:29] was
[1:28:30] God God was right inside of him so when
[1:28:33] I when I come to per I don't have to
[1:28:36] like look at brother Carson which would
[1:28:37] be a good examp Jared or brother Matt or
[1:28:40] or brother Lauren or brother Jim or
[1:28:41] anybody else I like Where's God let me
[1:28:44] see where's he's in the he's in the sign
[1:28:46] oh let's get a picture he's let me see
[1:28:49] let's get a he's in the pillow fire yeah
[1:28:51] he's in the pillow fire but he's in the
[1:28:52] bush too he's in the that Moses took off
[1:28:55] he's in let me see he's in the wind he
[1:28:58] he was in the darkness he was in the
[1:29:00] cloud he's in
[1:29:03] me so when I pray I don't say oh dear
[1:29:06] Cloud dear Lord Cloud please hear my
[1:29:09] prayer Cloud I'm not knocking the cloud
[1:29:12] he was that was the head that was God
[1:29:15] that was Jehovah but Jehovah is right in
[1:29:17] here i' say you're Jehovah I need an
[1:29:21] answer and I'm praying to myself that's
[1:29:25] why I'm talking to myself I don't need
[1:29:27] to that's why God said don't you don't
[1:29:29] have to worry about w we have all this
[1:29:31] message
[1:29:34] vocabulary and it's perfectly fine but
[1:29:36] God's not impressed by your message
[1:29:40] vocabulary he said don't be like the
[1:29:42] Sadducees and Pharisees that because of
[1:29:44] their message bab think that God will
[1:29:46] answer their prayer better than a little
[1:29:47] tiny
[1:29:48] child if I wanted to real answer a
[1:29:51] prayer I'd go to the youngest kid in
[1:29:52] here say they pray for me because they
[1:29:56] have faith that we don't fat people
[1:29:58] people don't have you know when my hay
[1:30:01] barn started on fire and God it didn't
[1:30:04] it was fire that couldn't burn you know
[1:30:05] God's the same yesterday today and
[1:30:06] forever just in case you don't know that
[1:30:08] if you want to come to my house I'll
[1:30:10] show you the posted scir I never
[1:30:11] declared the insurance never lost
[1:30:13] nothing and all that but it was a little
[1:30:14] silus praying that was like eight years
[1:30:16] ago that was when we first came in here
[1:30:18] it was his prayer that May Fire not
[1:30:22] burn but we said well blast God when we
[1:30:24] having a big evangelist come you know
[1:30:27] who's coming to preach our company it's
[1:30:29] a big popular man we should have Silas
[1:30:31] preach the camp
[1:30:33] meeting we should have little Isaiah
[1:30:35] preach the camp
[1:30:37] meeting and we'll let Zoe sing the songs
[1:30:40] with
[1:30:42] Leah that's right oh you think God
[1:30:45] a you think God
[1:30:48] can you're not even converted
[1:30:52] yet the Bible says that if you don't
[1:30:55] become like the
[1:30:56] little you won't even be there so you
[1:30:59] know show me anywhere in the Bible where
[1:31:02] it says the ministry has an age
[1:31:08] limit Jesus was a young boy when he was
[1:31:11] in the Tabernacle and he confused them
[1:31:12] all crazy with the word of
[1:31:16] God it was it they don't have roadblocks
[1:31:19] they haven't lived long enough to learn
[1:31:21] to doubt like are of your kids here like
[1:31:24] brother Bernard are your kids woring if
[1:31:26] you're going to have enough money to
[1:31:27] feed them
[1:31:28] today they they they wouldn't even know
[1:31:31] what you're even talking about that's
[1:31:33] right food that's right
[1:31:36] am cuz they you know what watch this
[1:31:40] watch this watch this this is as fresh
[1:31:42] as it'll get when you're born you're not
[1:31:45] born with
[1:31:46] doubt are kids born without when you
[1:31:49] were born is a is a what the natural
[1:31:52] types of spirit when you were born a
[1:31:53] little baby were you afraid that your
[1:31:55] mother wouldn't take care of
[1:31:57] you so you were born spiritually were
[1:32:00] you afraid that God wouldn't take care
[1:32:01] of you when you were first born
[1:32:03] spiritually but now you got everything
[1:32:05] and you and
[1:32:07] you you fill in the
[1:32:10] blank you've matured so much that you've
[1:32:13] learned how to
[1:32:15] doubt hello true learned how to hello
[1:32:21] that's not the type of matur we're
[1:32:22] talking about
[1:32:29] wow God help
[1:32:32] me if that's what maturity is oh I want
[1:32:35] to
[1:32:37] decrease so he can
[1:32:40] increase watch this here continue this
[1:32:43] quote he said they do only his will
[1:32:44] that's talking about you he said and no
[1:32:46] one can persuade them differently if if
[1:32:50] somebody can persuade you differently
[1:32:52] that God ain't living in inside you
[1:32:54] don't watch this you say well they
[1:32:57] didn't persuade me but they discouraged
[1:32:59] me wait a minute that's the same
[1:33:05] thing if you go home from here and
[1:33:07] you're discouraged because something
[1:33:09] didn't happen the way you thought then I
[1:33:12] just have one little question for you
[1:33:13] how was God
[1:33:15] discouraged how could the anointed one
[1:33:17] be discouraged how could the elected
[1:33:20] already glorified chosen priesthood
[1:33:23] kingship be
[1:33:26] discouraged so you let somebody
[1:33:29] else bring you down
[1:33:33] yes they have thus sayith the Lord that
[1:33:35] means you don't you have thus sayith the
[1:33:37] Lord that means you that you know what
[1:33:40] that means that means you'll have the
[1:33:42] character of Christ so you'll play the
[1:33:45] violin for the person that hates
[1:33:50] you and those kind of people God's Not
[1:33:53] Afraid of give them lots of
[1:33:56] authority God can just dump Authority on
[1:34:00] them because you have thus sayith the
[1:34:02] Lord or you'll be
[1:34:04] still and you will only do God's work
[1:34:07] for it's himself that's continuing to I
[1:34:10] got a punchline here that this is
[1:34:11] unbelievable this is the spoken word The
[1:34:13] Original Seed a 62 quote he said you
[1:34:15] know Jesus Christ when he was on Earth
[1:34:18] did not fulfill or finish his work on
[1:34:23] Earth that's
[1:34:25] right that's
[1:34:27] right and so you
[1:34:30] are doing it yeah am amen and how can
[1:34:35] you do it if
[1:34:37] oh oh
[1:34:41] man oh man they didn't oh man I'm hard
[1:34:46] done
[1:34:47] by he says here he didn't complete it in
[1:34:51] his days and all those things that when
[1:34:53] was here he said he did not complete
[1:34:56] them when he was here he actually
[1:34:57] repeats it and so it because it wasn't
[1:35:00] the time yet it's for
[1:35:02] you to do them that's right ain't that
[1:35:07] amazing First Corinthians and we're
[1:35:09] we're getting down to here near the I
[1:35:12] think we are we're doing pretty good 1
[1:35:15] Corinthians 6 2 he said do you not know
[1:35:18] that you shall judge the
[1:35:21] world how could you be press like the
[1:35:25] whole world's going to be your foot stol
[1:35:26] but you're you're
[1:35:30] sad because you haven't
[1:35:34] recognized doesn't it verse three it
[1:35:36] says don't you know that you should
[1:35:38] judge the
[1:35:39] Angels the Holy Angels the angel that
[1:35:43] came down and told Mary you are highly
[1:35:45] favored and chosen among women you're
[1:35:49] going to judge
[1:35:51] them and you're having a hard time
[1:35:56] amen verse
[1:35:58] 19 what know ye not that your body is
[1:36:03] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[1:36:08] you which is in you right
[1:36:11] now the Holy Ghost is in you what's that
[1:36:14] make
[1:36:16] you which ye have of
[1:36:18] God and ye are not no more your own
[1:36:22] Revelations 19 6 and9 Revelations
[1:36:27] 196
[1:36:28] 29 and I heard as it were a voice of
[1:36:31] great
[1:36:32] multitudes and of many Waters as it was
[1:36:35] a voice of many Thunder you know Thunder
[1:36:38] in the Bible is God's word you know you
[1:36:42] know when the seals were open and it
[1:36:43] talks about the Thunders and that that
[1:36:45] was the the seals was the written word
[1:36:47] the Thunder was God's
[1:36:49] voice it wasn't the Written Letter the
[1:36:51] Thunder was just the tone of The Voice
[1:36:54] that's right God did that he didn't do
[1:36:57] that for my purpose Jesus said he did it
[1:36:59] so you could hear some heard a thunder
[1:37:01] it was God speaking this is my beloved
[1:37:04] Son in whom I'm well
[1:37:05] pleased serve
[1:37:08] him
[1:37:10] amen saying hallelujah he said God

[1:39:45] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:47] and you're sealed by Jehovah and you
[1:39:49] were in his thoughts and you know Jesus
[1:39:51] said in the Bible he said no man go to

[1:40:57] before the foundation of the world I
[1:40:58] have rapturing Grace it's unmerited
[1:41:03] unworthy amen he said don't resist that
[1:41:06] the Rapture is in us now he said I can
[1:41:08] prove it by the the Bible That's Romans
[1:41:11] 8 I believe 32 he said those he called
[1:41:13] he justified and those he justified he's

[1:51:50] asked the one brother I said so you know
[1:51:52] you're driving with your wife and your
[1:51:54] family down the road and you go off the
[1:51:56] road and you hit a tree and her cop

[1:52:02] can't pray I said I don't want a god
[1:52:04] like

[1:52:07] caps on my head and tied to ties around
[1:52:10] my neck I hate ties around my neck I

[1:52:16] take it off and then then I lost my
[1:52:19] God are you kidding
