[43:32] doesn't that just speak your heart this
[43:33] morning if you don't mind stand a a
[43:35] minute longer let's read Psalm 24 and
[43:38] just take our text for this
[43:40] sermon Psalms 24 just verses 3 to 6
[43:44] here who shall Ascend into the hill of
[43:47] the Lord or who shall stand in his holy
[43:50] place he that hath Clean Hands and a
[43:54] pure heart who hath not lifted up his
[43:56] soul unto vanity nor sworn
[43:59] deceitfully he shall receive the
[44:01] blessing from the Lord and righteousness
[44:02] from the god of his salvation this is
[44:04] the generation of them that seek him
[44:06] that seek thy face oh Jacob amen shall
[44:09] we pray Heavenly Father Lord your word
[44:13] Lord many times when we turn to the
[44:15] Psalms father we find that the words
[44:18] there speak our very hearts Lord and the
[44:21] deepest desires within us Lord and
[44:23] father I I I trust that's the desire of
[44:26] every heart that's assembled here today
[44:28] Lord to be pure before you Lord to be
[44:31] washed clean Lord and and and father to
[44:34] just have a heart that's pure Lord and
[44:36] reserved unto you Lord in your spirit

[44:46] you may you find any any wicked way Lord
[44:48] and and cleanse it Purge it father that
[44:51] we might have a pure heart before you
[44:53] Lord and that that Pure Heart might be
[44:54] expressed with hands that that are clean
[44:56] clean enough to handle this gospel Lord
[44:59] Jesus oh God that's our desire now just
[45:02] speak to us from your word Lord Lord as
[45:05] brother Mike prayed perform that heart
[45:06] surgery on each one thou great physician
[45:10] as we surrender to you Lord and ask you
[45:12] to have your way in Jesus Christ's name
[45:14] amen amen God bless you as you're seated
[45:17] this morning amen uh just just been very
[45:21] captivated by this this uh this thought
[45:25] of of a pure heart uh it it means quite
[45:29] a bit to me personally uh through some
[45:31] different experiences that I've had and
[45:33] experiences in my family also the the
[45:35] part about Clean Hands uh in this season
[45:38] of my life it's it's something that's a
[45:40] heart's cry I don't know how much time
[45:42] we'll have to get into that part of the
[45:43] subject tonight but but you know it's my
[45:45] desire Amen to be pure uh to to be good
[45:49] in Ministry in in in in fatherhood in a
[45:53] marriage in just my Christian Life I I
[45:55] want to be found pure before him I I
[45:57] don't I don't want to I don't want to
[45:58] handle the word of God with any deceit I
[46:00] don't want to mix it with anything I
[46:02] don't want to dirty it with things of
[46:03] the world or my own ideas or or anything
[46:06] like that but I just want to be a pure
[46:07] believer of this age a pure genan seed
[46:10] of God expressed with no no compromise
[46:13] no no mixing amen and and so and so uh
[46:17] and so it just drives me to this little
[46:19] study on on a pure heart and at home we
[46:22] we handle the youth ministry there at
[46:23] the church and we've been U we've been
[46:25] dealing with the youth on matters of the
[46:27] heart you know matters of the heart
[46:29] because you know we we all we all
[46:31] struggle in our hearts as Christians
[46:33] it's a it's actually where the the The
[46:35] Human Experience is you know when I I
[46:38] think just to just to kind of uh uh put
[46:40] your mind in the channel that I'm coming
[46:42] from you know we heart the heart the
[46:44] scripture deals with the heart uh
[46:46] there's hundreds maybe thousands of
[46:48] scriptures dealing with the human heart
[46:50] now this heart you can't x-ray it you
[46:52] can't dissect it you can't lay it out on
[46:54] an operating table it's not this
[46:56] physical organ you know with aorta and
[46:58] ventricles and and and and and and and
[47:01] uh tissue fibers it's it that that's
[47:03] that's not the heart that we're speaking
[47:04] of but but we don't need to take an hour
[47:06] this morning and preach you know and
[47:08] teach you on what the heart is because
[47:10] we all understand what it is to have a
[47:12] heart and to struggle in your heart or
[47:14] be burned in your heart or question in
[47:15] your heart or or desire something down
[47:17] deep in your heart because that's the
[47:19] real human experience that's that's the
[47:22] real that's that that's where the real
[47:24] experience is you know we we we we we
[47:27] exist in this physical world and and we
[47:29] touch a lot of tangible things but the
[47:31] real identity the real experience the
[47:33] real person amen I is in the heart Amen
[47:36] in that in that spiritual realm and
[47:38] where there's deep callings you know
[47:40] there's there's deep desires there's
[47:42] thirsts in there which uh there's
[47:44] groanings which can't even be uttered
[47:46] sometimes you can't you would cheapen it
[47:48] by trying to put it into words what's
[47:49] going on in the heart amen amen and and
[47:52] uh and and and that's where the
[47:54] Christian experience is supposed to be
[47:56] had that's where the Christian
[47:57] experience occurs is in the heart
[47:59] brother brandom said that the heart is
[48:01] the Abode of God Amen in the Old
[48:04] Testament God dwelt In His glory over
[48:06] the ark and the the heart is the ark and
[48:08] he said now but God doesn't dwell in the
[48:10] head God dwells in the heart God is not
[48:13] known by theology I've always loved this
[48:15] quote God is not known by mental
[48:17] conception God is known by an
[48:19] oldfashioned Sanctified a born again
[48:22] experience that's in the human heart now
[48:25] now men and women will live a good life
[48:27] and love God by mental conception but
[48:29] the real hiding place is in the heart
[48:31] hid with Christ it's hid with Christ and
[48:34] you know we we could try to go deep here
[48:35] but but we don't want to uh we just
[48:37] don't want to take it that way but you
[48:38] know you can look at you can look at
[48:40] this heart and surrounded by by 24
[48:42] Elders or ribs and you know there's
[48:44] there's four passageway four channels of
[48:46] that heart where where blood's coming
[48:48] flowing in and out you know and and and
[48:50] and and we can look and realize that
[48:52] this heart is the Throne of God amen
[48:55] amen as as as as his Heavenly Throne is
[48:57] surrounded by 24 elders and there's
[48:59] there's four four anointings that that
[49:01] face out from that Throne brother amen
[49:03] but see God doesn't uh it's not God's
[49:05] desire to dwell in symbols it's not
[49:08] God's desire to dwell you know in a
[49:09] written word amen but God has chosen as
[49:13] his throne his his Abiding Place his his
[49:16] Tabernacle the heart of the human being
[49:19] amen and so a Christian is not really a
[49:21] Christian until they have experienced
[49:23] the indwelling of God and amen and so
[49:26] they're in spiritual communion where
[49:27] where God lives in the heart amen that's
[49:30] where Christianity happens Christianity
[49:32] doesn't happen uh in the church that we
[49:34] belong to or in our church attendance or
[49:36] just in singing our songs or paying our
[49:38] ties or dressing a certain way or
[49:40] associating with a certain group of
[49:41] people or her holding certain Creeds to
[49:44] be true amen but Christianity amen is
[49:48] Christ amen dwelling in the heart that's
[49:51] what the heart is it's the Abode of God
[49:53] now and so that's where we want to be
[49:55] living that's where we want to be having
[49:56] our experience that's where we want God
[49:58] to be working is in the heart
[50:00] amen and brother Brandon would often
[50:02] quote this this Psalm in prayer where he
[50:05] says search me oh God search me and know
[50:08] my heart know my heart and try me and
[50:11] know my thoughts and and see if there be
[50:14] any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the
[50:17] way Everlasting and so we find David as
[50:20] a prototype of the believer here he's
[50:22] approaching God he's saying God you look
[50:24] at my heart you search me you try me and
[50:27] then you look for any wicked thing now
[50:29] now now it's might seem it's kind of a
[50:31] silly question maybe but but it it goes
[50:34] a little bit deep to think that why
[50:36] would David need to ask the Lord to know
[50:38] his heart right because now of all the
[50:41] people in the world shouldn't David be
[50:44] the one that would have a grasp on what
[50:46] was going on inside of him it shouldn't
[50:48] David be the one now shouldn't you we
[50:50] think now maybe maybe it's just
[50:52] subconsciously that's the way we think
[50:53] many times Well if anybody should know
[50:56] you know what's going on in my heart it
[50:57] ought to be me amen but it's not so
[50:59] brother sister amen because uh you find
[51:02] that there are many uh circumstances of
[51:04] our life and struggles that we go
[51:05] through and situations will rise up in
[51:07] the church and we find that we're not
[51:09] fully in control of this guy amen that
[51:12] but there are things there there there
[51:14] there are turmoil there there's
[51:15] confusion there and so we have need of
[51:18] God Amen to deal with our heart because
[51:21] he knows it better than we do amen we
[51:23] could rattle off the scripture for that
[51:25] the Bible says that a man's heart
[51:27] deviseth his way how many times have you
[51:29] set your heart to something you say God
[51:31] in my heart this is what my heart is
[51:32] telling me to do this is what I'm going
[51:34] to do and what does it do it falls right
[51:36] to pieces and then you find out as a
[51:38] little time goes on it was the Lord
[51:40] directing your steps amen a man's heart
[51:42] deviseth his way but the Lord directeth
[51:44] his step the Bible says every way of a
[51:46] man is right in his own eyes amen but
[51:49] the Lord pth the hearts amen you know
[51:52] that the world and uh uh I know this is
[51:54] cliche but it's still true that the you
[51:57] know the world today says Follow Your
[51:59] Heart Right amen you know uh uh uh
[52:01] that's that's uh that's the Disney
[52:03] gospel that's the that that's sort of
[52:05] the layot ofy and philosophy follow your
[52:07] heart if it feels right do it if it
[52:09] feels good go get it amen whatever your
[52:11] heart's telling you that's truth that's
[52:13] reality it's not brother sister amen the
[52:16] Bible says the heart is deceitful Above
[52:18] All Things amen and desperately wicked
[52:24] amen who can know it amen and so we find
[52:26] it we cannot live by just what we feel
[52:29] in our heart you've got to have an
[52:30] absolute amen because there are times in
[52:33] our Christian experience where our heart
[52:34] is saying one thing but the word is
[52:36] saying the other and so it's a showdown
[52:39] Amen to find out what's really true
[52:41] brother sister and I don't just mean to
[52:43] God I mean what's true to you what's
[52:45] your absolute amen what's true amen
[52:48] because I'll tell you this word is true
[52:50] regardless of how you feel this word is
[52:52] true regardless of what you're feeling
[52:54] regard regardless of what your emotions
[52:56] say regardless of your heart's cry the
[52:59] word of God is absolute reality it's
[53:01] truth amen and so a Christian has to be
[53:04] in communion with something that's
[53:06] higher than our than our heart it's
[53:08] higher than our than our thinking than
[53:10] our feeling than our emotions amen who
[53:13] can know it and see see there's just a
[53:16] lot going on in there sometimes can you
[53:19] relate to that or is it just me I think
[53:22] I don't think it's just me there's a lot
[53:24] going on in heart amen there's deep deep
[53:28] calls but you realize we are living in a
[53:30] day when deep has responded amen this
[53:33] message of the hour is not a slightly
[53:35] better church with slightly better
[53:36] Doctrine it is deep that has responded
[53:39] amen deep has given an answer it's
[53:42] identification it's it's reality it's
[53:45] truth it's absolute it's Vindicated it's
[53:48] firm brother sister amen amen forget
[53:50] what your heart says amen Embrace this
[53:53] word amen
[53:55] hallelujah oh my amen because there's a
[53:59] there's a light that is coming to our
[54:01] day that can Pierce down all that
[54:02] shadowy stuff that we get under amen
[54:06] Jesus spoke of of uh those that were
[54:08] blind in heart you know the the blind
[54:10] hearted Pharisees people of his day when
[54:12] the word was now now not bad people and
[54:15] not people without sincere Hearts you
[54:18] know uh uh uh but but but good people
[54:21] missed Jesus Christ when he was
[54:23] manifested because the way that he came
[54:27] disappointed them didn't match their
[54:29] expectation it didn't it didn't quite
[54:31] line up with what what in their heart
[54:33] they thought it would be amen and so it
[54:35] becomes a showdown there you know he
[54:37] said of the he said of the the when he
[54:39] announced himself he said you Hypocrites
[54:41] well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying
[54:43] this people they draw nigh to me with
[54:45] their mouth see this is a religious
[54:47] person somebody who's got religion but
[54:49] they haven't quite got Christ they honor
[54:51] me with their mouth honor me with their
[54:53] lips but their heart heart is far from
[54:56] me their heart is far from me now
[54:58] brother sister that's not where I want
[55:00] to end up amen but I want a heart that
[55:03] is in contact with my redeemer Amen
[55:07] brother BR said we need today is a
[55:08] message Anointed with the messiahship of
[55:11] Christ but would they receive it oh my
[55:14] they pray for it but would they receive
[55:16] it no they wouldn't receive it he said
[55:18] they crucify it like they did in the
[55:20] first place why he said because the
[55:22] human heart is deceiving amen now think
[55:25] of how many people how many people maybe
[55:27] even this little town of Wyoming amen
[55:29] how many people have have have have
[55:31] fallen on their knees even in this town
[55:33] and prayed for Revival amen prayed that
[55:36] God would send a a Revival to this city
[55:38] or to this province or or to this
[55:41] country amen but when the message came
[55:43] to them amen did they embrace it they
[55:45] rejected it amen why because it didn't
[55:48] line up with what they were Desiring in
[55:50] their hearts brother sister brother I
[55:52] don't I don't I don't care what my heart
[55:54] is saying amen but when the word is
[55:56] Vindicated when it's manifested in front
[55:58] of a true son or daughter of God Amen
[56:00] then they'll lay aside what their heart
[56:02] says and they will embrace the word
[56:04] because it shows what kind of seed is on
[56:06] the inside it's the true Vindication of
[56:08] a true son or daughter of God Amen that
[56:11] they can receive the Vindicated
[56:13] manifested word amen and they won't
[56:16] believe this deceitful heart Amen
[56:18] brother BR said if you went if you went
[56:20] to all the churches today you think
[56:21] about Sunday morning if we just took a
[56:23] tour of all the churches in Canada
[56:25] brother Braham said and but if you begin
[56:26] to filter out those amen who were
[56:29] genuine word born Christians amen if you
[56:31] went to all these churches and you took
[56:33] out and and and you took out anybody
[56:35] that wasn't a genuine word born
[56:36] Christian he said there'd be a lot of
[56:37] sermons preached up against an empty
[56:39] wall today amen why BEC oh my because
[56:43] because the heart is deceitful amen when
[56:46] the heart finds satisfaction in religion
[56:48] when the heart finds satisfaction in
[56:49] Tradition amen amen when the heart finds
[56:52] satisfaction in personal opinions amen
[56:55] or personal relationships or whatever it
[56:58] is amen and fall short of the word test
[57:01] but brother Bram said I've got one
[57:02] desire in my heart and I hope that
[57:04] everyone listening to me has the same
[57:06] thing God take me through your
[57:08] filter as David said try me and prove me
[57:11] and see if there be any evil in me and
[57:13] take it out Lord you know we could
[57:15] preach a lot about denominationalism I
[57:17] tell I tell our young people I was like
[57:19] I want to program you train you to do
[57:21] this when brother Brandon begins to
[57:23] preach on denominations don't think in
[57:25] your mind you know well we're
[57:25] non-denominational so that doesn't apply
[57:28] to me I said take out the word
[57:30] denominational and put my church
[57:32] identity my tradition amen my background
[57:36] my relationships my church membership my
[57:39] Association brother sister
[57:41] denominationalism is not just an
[57:43] organization it's a heart condition it's
[57:46] a heart condition amen and without
[57:48] without surrendering to the knife of
[57:50] this word amen to to to get all of those
[57:53] uh all those worldly thinkings and all
[57:55] of those private interpretations and
[57:57] carve all of it out of you brother
[57:58] sister amen you can be a oneman
[58:00] denomination today amen but we don't
[58:03] want to be that we want our hearts to be

[1:01:11] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:01:13] intents of the heart amen you believe in

[1:01:55] so and you come from this city and you
[1:01:57] when you were a little girl you got in a
[1:01:58] car accident you've had anxiety ever
[1:02:00] since and Discerning you that way but
[1:02:01] how many times did you come to service
[1:02:03] and brother Dale had no idea what was
[1:02:05] going on in your life and the preach the
[1:02:07] visiting Minister didn't have he had no
[1:02:09] clue what the church was dealing with
[1:02:11] amen but what happened amen it came the
[1:02:13] word came right down your aisle the word
[1:02:16] came right to your heart and it began to
[1:02:18] speak to you amen it began to re it
[1:02:20] begin to discern what you're going
[1:02:22] through that's what the word can you
[1:02:25] that's what only the word can do amen
[1:02:28] it's a messiah sign friends amen we
[1:02:31] people people you know they come so far
[1:02:33] with the message amen as to just belong
[1:02:36] to a message church and believe God sent
[1:02:38] a prophet the devil believes God sent a
[1:02:40] prophet but you got to get this message
[1:02:41] in you get this word in you and then let
[1:02:44] it do the dividing you're not
[1:02:48] qualified amen but we've got a word
[1:02:50] brother sister it can come down amen it
[1:02:52] can it can manifest itself to you you it

[1:02:58] Spirit they wonder if they even got the
[1:02:59] Holy Ghost but let the word begin to
[1:03:02] deser you and it begins to divide the
[1:03:04] soul and the spirit and it says okay
[1:03:06] let's cut this away now over in your
[1:03:08] spiritual realm there's the greatest
[1:03:10] battle ever fought you're going through
[1:03:11] a lot of turmoil there's questions

[1:03:34] comes into your heart it knows just how
[1:03:36] to divide it you know wouldn't it we be
[1:03:38] wonderful sometimes I don't know why
[1:03:39] we're going this way but sometimes
[1:03:42] sometimes people sometimes people can
[1:03:44] have a genuine experience with God but
[1:03:46] the main thing holding them back is a
[1:03:48] question in their own mind cuz the
[1:03:50] devil's able to put a seat of doubt in
[1:03:51] there say well you never really got the
[1:03:53] holy ghost or or you never you're not
[1:03:55] maybe you're not really a seed or maybe
[1:03:57] you send away your day of Grace or or or
[1:03:59] or or or or or you know you know this
[1:04:01] message it's true but it's not for you
[1:04:03] and and those kind of thoughts and
[1:04:05] wouldn't it be nice wouldn't it be nice
[1:04:08] to be able to sit in a meeting and know
[1:04:10] that there was a prophet on the face of
[1:04:11] the Earth amen who had the Messiah sign
[1:04:14] in his ministry and he'd be able to just
[1:04:16] look down and say God bless you your
[1:04:18] name is Mike Allen I see that you're a
[1:04:19] real Christian oh wouldn't that wouldn't
[1:04:22] that be wonderful to hear that from the
[1:04:23] words of Prophet amen but brother sister
[1:04:26] that word is still here amen and the
[1:04:28] brother Ram said when you recognize that
[1:04:30] this message is Eagle food you have
[1:04:32] heard from your theophany brother or
[1:04:34] sister it's a it's a word of discernment
[1:04:36] it's a word of identification it's a
[1:04:38] word if you just let it into your heart
[1:04:40] it'll tell you who you are amen it won't
[1:04:43] it will it'll clear up the confusion
[1:04:45] God's not the author of Doubt amen he's
[1:04:48] but he's the author and the finisher of
[1:04:50] Faith Hallelujah this great physician
[1:04:53] amen he knows how to operate on your
[1:04:56] heart the trouble is we were always
[1:04:58] trying to fix this guy
[1:04:59] up amen but let the word do it let the
[1:05:03] word do it say Lord search me you know
[1:05:06] better than me you look and see if
[1:05:08] there's anything Wicked any wicked way
[1:05:11] in me I don't want to go a wicked way I
[1:05:13] want to go the way Everlasting now
[1:05:14] wicked wicked doesn't just mean
[1:05:17] evil you know that's not uh uh actually
[1:05:20] the the the the real translation for
[1:05:23] that word it has it it comes from the
[1:05:25] same word as Idol like
[1:05:26] idolatry and so but but it doesn't just
[1:05:29] mean evil you know it's not Lord come
[1:05:30] and search my heart and see if there's
[1:05:32] any first-degree
[1:05:33] felonies and see if there's any murder
[1:05:36] and see if there's any Grand Larsen and
[1:05:38] you know Lord come look at my heart see
[1:05:40] if I'm going to go rob a bank
[1:05:41] tomorrow no Lord is there something in
[1:05:45] my heart that's leading me to sorrow
[1:05:49] it's leading me to grief it's leading me
[1:05:52] in your permissive will and Lord I want
[1:05:54] to be in your perfect will anything Lord
[1:05:56] is there something out of order Lord I
[1:05:58] might do my priorities need fixed up
[1:06:00] Lord is there anything anything that's
[1:06:03] invisible to me then Lord fix it search
[1:06:07] me try me know me and fix it Lord
[1:06:10] because because if I follow my heart
[1:06:13] it'll lead me to wickedness but I want
[1:06:15] to walk in the way Everlasting Lord I
[1:06:17] want you to direct my steps oh my amen
[1:06:20] that's why this might be a simple
[1:06:21] thought this morning but no matter how
[1:06:23] long you've been a Christian no matter
[1:06:25] how long you've been in church no matter
[1:06:26] your position in the church we need this
[1:06:28] amen we need a heartfelt religion we
[1:06:31] need a one-on-one communion with God
[1:06:33] Amen where he's examining us and trying
[1:06:35] Us by his word and fixing us cuz we
[1:06:39] can't fix
[1:06:41] ourselves we can't fix ourselves so Lord
[1:06:44] is there anything out of order is there
[1:06:45] is there is there any idolatry is there
[1:06:48] something wrong with my private
[1:06:49] worships amen see those are the things
[1:06:52] now you can hide lot of that from
[1:06:55] people you can hide a lot of from people
[1:06:57] and you know the problem is we put a lot
[1:06:59] of energy and a lot of our time and a
[1:07:02] lot of our effort into taking matters of
[1:07:05] the heart and concealing it from
[1:07:07] everybody else amen we do that why
[1:07:10] because because that's where we feel the
[1:07:13] pressure what would brother Dale
[1:07:16] think what would brother Jared say if
[1:07:18] they knew and oh I better not bring this
[1:07:20] up everybody will think I'm struggling
[1:07:22] you know everybody will think I'm weak
[1:07:24] pastors feel that way well you know if I
[1:07:26] get too if I get too real this morning
[1:07:28] then the people might lose their
[1:07:30] confidence in me if I show my human
[1:07:32] weakness and I get that way I'm sure you
[1:07:35] get that way brother Dale amen but you
[1:07:37] know we find it we find that we put a
[1:07:39] lot of our time a lot of our enry a lot
[1:07:41] of our focus into concealing it from
[1:07:42] people and it's not too hard to do cuz
[1:07:45] religion is a covering religion is a
[1:07:48] covering I've learned in my short 34
[1:07:50] years of living that religion can hide a
[1:07:52] lot amen but there's one that you can't
[1:07:55] hide it from there's somebody who knows
[1:07:57] your heart he knows it better than you
[1:07:59] do you can't hide it from him he knows
[1:08:01] what's wrong amen all you really got to
[1:08:04] do is let him in amen but we but along
[1:08:07] with trying to hide it from some
[1:08:09] everybody else we try to conceal it from
[1:08:11] the Lord and we don't bring it to him to
[1:08:14] just get it
[1:08:15] fixed just get it fixed you but you
[1:08:18] can't hide it from the word that's the
[1:08:19] Messiah sign this word is a discerner
[1:08:21] brother sister he knows he knows he know
[1:08:23] knows where you're at today now you
[1:08:25] might have been successful you may have
[1:08:26] hidden it from your spouse from your
[1:08:28] children from your church amen but that
[1:08:30] that heart problem amen that struggle
[1:08:33] that question that doubt that that that
[1:08:35] that worry that fear whatever it is
[1:08:37] brother sister it's not hidden from him
[1:08:40] but will you take it to him or will
[1:08:42] rather will you let him
[1:08:44] in you know that he knocks on the door
[1:08:46] of every heart but it's those that it's
[1:08:50] those that let this word in let the
[1:08:51] message in amen that it'll come amen
[1:08:55] it'll break the bread
[1:08:57] hallelujah amen that's how we get as
[1:09:00] human beings just like you know there
[1:09:01] was a woman one time and she spent a lot
[1:09:04] of time you know trying to hide her
[1:09:06] wickedness hide her Pro now no doubt you
[1:09:08] know uh uh uh this woman she was an ill-
[1:09:11] Fame woman but no doubt you know the way
[1:09:12] that she got that way it wasn't all her
[1:09:14] fault but things just spiraled out of
[1:09:16] control and people hurt her and one
[1:09:18] thing led to another and life
[1:09:19] experiences had brought her to a place
[1:09:22] amen where she was she was in a Ed
[1:09:24] condition and you think she had anybody
[1:09:26] on her side no she got caught one day
[1:09:29] amen and instead of a good good loving
[1:09:31] bunch of brothers and sisters Amen to
[1:09:33] help her amen she found herself in the
[1:09:35] middle of a bunch of Pharisees and they
[1:09:36] said we caught you now amen now now we
[1:09:38] see that weakness now we're going to
[1:09:40] drag you to him now that's the way it is
[1:09:42] that's sometimes how we learn to hide
[1:09:44] things that's sometimes how we learn
[1:09:46] this behavior of concealing all of our
[1:09:48] struggles amen because we got some
[1:09:50] Pharisees in churches amen amen but but
[1:09:53] see but see don't let a Pharisee keep
[1:09:55] you from getting to
[1:09:57] Jesus amen cuz they began to drag her
[1:09:59] they said we'll take her to him and she
[1:10:01] thought oh my takeing I hear that I hear
[1:10:03] he's the son of God I hear he's got the
[1:10:06] power of life and death in his voice I
[1:10:07] hear I I you know I hear that power of
[1:10:10] creation is subject amen I hear he's the
[1:10:12] Messiah I don't want to go
[1:10:15] there I don't want to go there amen and
[1:10:18] that's how we feel with our troubles we
[1:10:20] come to church and we say well you know
[1:10:22] I I'll come to church sure you know I'll
[1:10:24] raise my hands and I'll sing some songs
[1:10:27] and I'll say amen and I'll enjoy a nice
[1:10:29] I'll enjoy some nice preaching today and
[1:10:31] we'll just have a good church service
[1:10:33] and that's how far we'll go but I don't
[1:10:34] want to go
[1:10:36] there Lord don't take me there cuz if I
[1:10:40] go there I don't know what's going to
[1:10:41] happen I don't know what you're going to
[1:10:43] say Lord I haven't opened that door in a
[1:10:46] long
[1:10:47] time amen I I Lord there's a lot of
[1:10:50] things stored up there there's a lot of
[1:10:51] hurt there's a lot of baggage I finally
[1:10:53] got it stuffed in that closet I don't
[1:10:54] want to go there with you Lord oh but
[1:10:57] why be afraid amen she was afraid to go
[1:11:00] to him amen but even her enemies drugger
[1:11:02] to him and what did he say he said let
[1:11:04] he that's without sin cast the first
[1:11:06] tone he said all of my children are
[1:11:09] brokenhearted amen but I came to bind
[1:11:12] them back up amen you don't have any
[1:11:15] accuser before me and neither do I
[1:11:18] accuse
[1:11:19] you go there brother sister go there at
[1:11:21] all costs amen every chance you get in
[1:11:24] the house of God I I don't care what
[1:11:26] people will say I don't care what people
[1:11:28] will do I don't care how you think you
[1:11:29] might act amen just get to
[1:11:32] Jesus there was another woman one time
[1:11:35] amen that she was in a similar condition
[1:11:38] and she heard that Jesus was in town she
[1:11:40] had something in her heart driving her
[1:11:41] to him amen but she was afraid to go she
[1:11:44] didn't want to go there cuz it cuz to go
[1:11:46] there she'd have to go to Simon the
[1:11:48] Pharisees house in
[1:11:50] Bethany and then and and she'd have to
[1:11:53] in other words when you come to church
[1:11:54] there's a lot of people come to church
[1:11:58] Faithfully but carrying out trouble on
[1:12:01] their heart and they bring it to church
[1:12:02] and they go home and they bring it and
[1:12:03] they take it back home and they'll carry
[1:12:05] it for decades that way why because to
[1:12:08] take it to Jesus you're going to have to
[1:12:10] you're going to have to rub shoulders
[1:12:12] you're going to have to pass through
[1:12:13] some some some anxiety you're going to
[1:12:16] have to pass through some condemnation
[1:12:17] you're going to have to Pastor you know
[1:12:19] you're going to hear the devil
[1:12:20] whispering in your ear saying you
[1:12:21] shouldn't be struggling with that anyway
[1:12:23] why even go why even get prayer for that
[1:12:25] you're probably not even a Christian oh
[1:12:28] my and and there's just a lot of
[1:12:30] Pharisees between you in Jesus there's a
[1:12:33] lot of thoughts there's a lot of
[1:12:34] condemnation there's a lot of voices
[1:12:36] brother sister oh my but there's only
[1:12:38] one voice that matters that's the one we
[1:12:41] want to get to amen you might have you
[1:12:43] might say brother Nathan I got nothing
[1:12:44] to offer him all I got is a bunch of
[1:12:46] broken pieces my heart's been crushed to
[1:12:49] bits by my life experiences amen that's
[1:12:51] all she had was a little little
[1:12:53] alabaster box and it was the purchase of
[1:12:56] a lifetime of failure it was the rewards
[1:12:59] of sins and mistakes and unfortunate
[1:13:02] circumstances it was a box of hurt and
[1:13:06] sorrow and grief and condemnation but
[1:13:09] that didn't stop her she said I got to
[1:13:11] get it to him and I'll wash his feet
[1:13:15] with my tears and I'll dry them with my
[1:13:17] hair oh that should be our attitude
[1:13:19] today Lord whatever it takes whoever's
[1:13:22] preaching what ever is going on let me
[1:13:25] get to Jesus today
[1:13:28] amen yeah we need to go there we need to
[1:13:31] go there I don't believe the Lord put
[1:13:33] this on my heart for no reason today

[1:19:04] dirty Waters a lot of you been around
[1:19:06] this message a long time you've seen a
[1:19:08] lot of
[1:19:10] nonsense but it wasn't the message
[1:19:13] brother brandom remember he talked about
[1:19:15] that Chinese laundr mats back in the old
[1:19:17] west and and they they had to they get a
[1:19:19] piece of paper they didn't speak English
[1:19:20] so they'd rip that piece of paper
[1:19:21] certain way and had to be something that
[1:19:23] could match to vindicate amen that that
[1:19:26] that those clean clothes belong to an
[1:19:29] individual brother Bram said this
[1:19:30] message has matched everything the the
[1:19:33] Bible spoke of for this hour it's a
[1:19:35] perfect match brother sister it's a
[1:19:37] Vindicated word it is the word it is the
[1:19:40] Messiah sign amen now he said now if you
[1:19:43] got some dirty clothes turn them in
[1:19:46] Hallelujah that's all it takes brother
[1:19:49] sister you say brother Nathan I got a
[1:19:50] lot of dirty stuff piled up just turn it
[1:19:53] in and let the message begin to wash you
[1:19:56] that's why we've had a lot the waters
[1:19:57] have been dirtied because people have
[1:19:59] misused this message and they'll take a
[1:20:01] little bit of this bleach but they'll
[1:20:02] take a little of their personal opinion
[1:20:04] they'll take a little bit of their
[1:20:05] private Doctrine they little bit a
[1:20:07] little bit of this is how we used to do
[1:20:08] it in my church and this is the way my
[1:20:10] grandpa felt about it and this is you
[1:20:12] know this is our family tradition and
[1:20:13] there's my private interpretation and
[1:20:15] here's my besetting sin or whatever it
[1:20:17] is and mix that with the word friends
[1:20:19] that's not what's needed what you need
[1:20:20] to do turn all that junk in and let this
[1:20:23] word wash you turn in your dirty laundry
[1:20:25] you're not going to wear a you're not
[1:20:27] going to wear a white robe with dirty
[1:20:29] underwear but you got to turn it all in
[1:20:31] so you can be clothed for Rapture
[1:20:34] clothed to rule clothed to be the Bride
[1:20:37] of Jesus Christ make yourself ready
[1:20:39] brother sister turn it in amen many
[1:20:42] people have misused this message they've
[1:20:43] dirtied the waters there's been a lot of
[1:20:45] wicked Hearts what what is it brother
[1:20:47] what's it all about they just haven't
[1:20:49] been
[1:20:50] washed but everywhere this message has
[1:20:52] been allowed to wash people amen it's
[1:20:55] been the cleanest most loving amen most
[1:20:58] character-filled most wonderful people
[1:21:00] you could ever rub shoulders with why
[1:21:02] because the message works the Water
[1:21:05] Works brother sister this water is able
[1:21:07] to wash the worldliness off of you and
[1:21:09] and these Waters of Separation can
[1:21:10] separate you into amen that holy of
[1:21:14] holies amen it can it can it can draw
[1:21:17] you it can separate you onto him and you
[1:21:20] can be clean Hallelujah you can be
[1:21:24] clean oh brother Nathan well I opened
[1:21:27] the door to him many years ago brother
[1:21:29] Brandon preached a few times about some
[1:21:32] doors inside the door right and that's
[1:21:36] where the trouble is brother sister amen
[1:21:39] is because the message works when you
[1:21:40] give it your whole heart he said yeah if
[1:21:43] you seek me you'll find me but come with
[1:21:45] your whole heart amen trust in the Lord
[1:21:47] with all your heart lean not on your own
[1:21:50] understanding and all your wayes
[1:21:51] acknowledge Him and he'll direct your
[1:21:53] paths and so what happens is we forsake
[1:21:56] leadership because we just won't let
[1:21:58] them in I know that's simple preaching
[1:22:02] but it's good for me I reckon it's good
[1:22:04] for you there's doors inside the door
[1:22:07] brother BR said one of those doors is
[1:22:08] called Pride oh yeah Lord come on in
[1:22:12] come on in you're welcome to the living
[1:22:14] room you're welcome to the kitchen just
[1:22:18] don't go in that
[1:22:20] bedroom I got some stuff in there I
[1:22:22] don't want you to see
[1:22:23] Lord I I I'm not ready I'm not ready for
[1:22:26] you to go in there that's
[1:22:28] private but that's the relationship he
[1:22:31] wants with you he wants that private
[1:22:33] that's deeper than you think it is he
[1:22:35] wants that bedroom relationship with his
[1:22:37] bride he wants a bride who's given her
[1:22:40] given him her whole heart amen but what
[1:22:42] is it it's Pride what will somebody
[1:22:44] think or you know I'm I'm I'm a great
[1:22:46] big somebody you know I I'm too
[1:22:48] revelated to be struggling with this or
[1:22:49] that so Lord just don't go there let's
[1:22:51] just ignore that let's just put that no
[1:22:53] friends amen let him in amen don't be
[1:22:56] like non non was a great man he was a
[1:22:58] great big guy you know oh and he had a
[1:23:00] wonderful you know oh he had a he had a
[1:23:02] wonderful testimony how he left houses
[1:23:04] and lands and he left his old
[1:23:06] denomination he came to sit under a
[1:23:07] prophet and hear a prophet's instruction
[1:23:10] and he went 99% of the way with the
[1:23:12] message until until he needed to be
[1:23:14] washed and he thought you mean you mean
[1:23:18] you want me to act like those bunch of
[1:23:19] holy rollers and I I got all this
[1:23:21] revelation you know and I'm I'm an elder
[1:23:24] in the church and you want me to just
[1:23:25] get so you want me to get so deep in the
[1:23:28] spirit this morning till i' ball my eyes

[1:23:35] brother sister just go all the way amen
[1:23:37] just just go all the way if you want to
[1:23:39] be clean but see people come most of the
[1:23:41] way amen but they just won't quite sell
[1:23:43] out it's because of Pride cuz we had a
[1:23:45] lot of great big men and great big women
[1:23:47] around this message but the message
[1:23:49] isn't for Great Men amen you see your
[1:23:51] calling brethren not many mighty not
[1:23:53] many noble not many great big guys come
[1:23:55] to this message amen but but see it's
[1:23:58] somebody who can be humble somebody will
[1:24:00] just throw open the door say Lord you go
[1:24:02] in there you sort it
[1:24:04] out

[1:24:09] door amen I I I don't want to get so big
[1:24:13] I don't want to be some big preacher
[1:24:15] that can't listen to what a prophet said
[1:24:17] and humble myself to a message and let
[1:24:19] God have my whole heart cuz I'm a big
[1:24:21] somebody
[1:24:23] oh brother I want to be washed I want to
[1:24:26] be cleansed I want all the leprosy taken

[1:24:35] the hill of the Lord the soul without
[1:24:37] vanity shall stand in his holy Place

[1:24:41] you know when God goes to dealing with a
[1:24:43] human heart no matter how big they are
[1:24:46] he lets them see how little they can
[1:24:48] get open that door open that door I I

[1:28:09] to the other Jesus said out of the out
[1:28:12] of the Treasure of a the good Treasure
[1:28:13] of a heart good comes out if it's evil
[1:28:15] in the heart evil comes out whatever the
[1:28:17] condition of the heart everything flows
[1:28:19] from there and but we spend all our time
[1:28:22] as Christians trying to fix everything
[1:28:23] up on the outside amen but you got a
[1:28:26] heart problem brother sister it's a
[1:28:28] heart condition start in the heart amen
[1:28:32] I know as a young man you know as a
[1:28:33] young person I struggle for many years
[1:28:35] and a real turning point in my life was
[1:28:37] to realize hey how about instead of
[1:28:39] trying to fix everything on the outside
[1:28:42] what about F what about just falling in
[1:28:44] love with Jesus and I found that I
[1:28:46] haven't got so far in my Christianity
[1:28:48] that I don't need to be reminded day by
[1:28:50] day hey stay in love with Jesus Jesus
[1:28:52] amen fall in love with Jesus why don't
[1:28:54] you read your Bible why don't you pray
[1:28:56] amen and draw closer to him that way and
[1:28:58] see how many of these things go away
[1:29:01] automatically cuz now you got it flowing
[1:29:03] from the out from the inside out amen
[1:29:06] that's absolutely right the Bible says
[1:29:07] where your treasure is that's where your
[1:29:09] heart will be get the heart fixed first
[1:29:12] amen because it's all of our effort
[1:29:15] David said God you don't desire
[1:29:17] sacrifice if you wanted it I'd give it
[1:29:20] but what you want is a contra
[1:29:22] heart brother Bram said people even
[1:29:24] study too much you say you can study the
[1:29:26] word too much brother Nathan brother
[1:29:27] Bram said people study too much and they
[1:29:30] even have mental breakdowns and things
[1:29:31] cuz they're studying about the Lord he
[1:29:32] said you got to quit it you don't have
[1:29:35] to do that the only thing you have to do
[1:29:37] is fall in love with him and just go
[1:29:40] right on loving him now obviously I'm
[1:29:42] not preaching against studying and we
[1:29:43] believe in teaching and getting deep
[1:29:45] down in this but look fall in love with
[1:29:47] Jesus and then you'll want to know about
[1:29:49] him then you'll want to be taught you'll
[1:29:51] want him to teach his statutes see it's
[1:29:54] not all this outward
[1:29:55] stuff it's the condition of the heart
[1:29:59] has the message turned your heart
[1:30:01] back or is it failing for
[1:30:05] fear brother Bram said you might have
[1:30:07] the biggest church there is in the
[1:30:08] country see outward you might have more
[1:30:10] money than you ever got you might
[1:30:12] associate with a better intellectual
[1:30:14] crowd and wear a better suit of clothes
[1:30:15] but brother God wants a clean heart and
[1:30:20] Clean Hands he wants a clean up church
[1:30:23] and then he can show himself oh friends

[1:34:09] brother sister I have great love in my
[1:34:12] human heart for this congregation these
[1:34:14] people what the problem with human love

[1:34:22] human love feels jealous human love has
[1:34:25] worry human love that's how many times

[1:34:30] church and and and there's a real issue
[1:34:32] and people are on one side and the other
[1:34:34] and there's a division and everybody
[1:34:36] loves
[1:34:38] everybody and it still went wrong in a
[1:34:41] family in a church and whatever it is
[1:34:43] there was no shortage of love but it was
[1:34:46] human love we need Divine love to come
[1:34:50] amen and purify these heart hearts and
[1:34:52] and take all the fear out of it because
[1:34:54] Divine love fixes the
[1:34:56] issue amen now now where is divine love
[1:34:59] it's in the Holy Ghost that's in you
[1:35:01] that potential is in you that's what we
[1:35:02] need to be expressing this day amen all
[1:35:05] Brother Ray backom has been preaching
[1:35:06] wonderful series on it because to think
[1:35:09] to think that that that you know brother
[1:35:12] brandom when that bull came running at
[1:35:14] him he did what you and I do somebody
[1:35:18] says something a little off about one of
[1:35:19] your kids some kind of somebody kind of
[1:35:22] brings up a little doctrinal dispute or
[1:35:24] some a little insult or a little rubs
[1:35:26] you the wrong way a little bit what do
[1:35:27] you do you go for your
[1:35:29] gun and that's it brother br's
[1:35:31] representing all our Humanity when he
[1:35:33] goes for his gun but then what happened
[1:35:35] he said something else projected amen
[1:35:37] something from somewhere else came into
[1:35:39] this heart that's my desire today Lord
[1:35:41] amen let let that Divine love overwhelm
[1:35:43] me purify my heart purify my thoughts
[1:35:46] purify my intentions and give me Clean
[1:35:48] Hands amen that I can that I can address
[1:35:50] the needs of of my brothers and sisters
[1:35:52] without infecting anybody amen but
[1:35:55] cleanse me sterilize me for service Lord

[1:36:01] running out of time amen but uh uh uh uh
[1:36:04] I just trust that's an encouragement to
[1:36:06] you but amen you know that that we we
[1:36:09] need it brother sister we need a heart
[1:36:12] washing today we need a good old fashion
[1:36:15] heart cleansing we need the Holy Spirit
[1:36:17] you know not just to come by the church
[1:36:19] and and and and uh and and just be
[1:36:21] worshiped and get and and and and enjoy
[1:36:23] our emotional praise and all those
[1:36:25] things which is wonderful but we need
[1:36:27] amen a God that comes in and breaks
[1:36:30] bread and breaks it binds up the broken
[1:36:32] pieces oh we need we need God in the
[1:36:35] heart we need God in the heart cuz
[1:36:38] that's where the battle is greatest
[1:36:41] battle ever fought in that spiritual
[1:36:43] realm in the hearts of human
[1:36:45] beings and that you know you get to
[1:36:47] place in your life where you just get so
[1:36:49] down in your heart and then it seems
[1:36:51] like your life is falling apart and we
[1:36:54] looking around like what what's
[1:36:55] happening why Lord how did I even get to
[1:36:57] this condition it seem like overnight
[1:37:00] everything just piled on and piled on
[1:37:02] one thing after another and it never
[1:37:04] doesn't rain but it pours and brother
[1:37:07] Ram said because it's when Satan gets
[1:37:09] you
[1:37:10] discouraged that's when he can really
[1:37:12] pour it on
[1:37:13] you amen when he gets you in your heart
[1:37:16] discouraged he said now but God doesn't
[1:37:18] want you to be
[1:37:19] frowning God wants you to be
[1:37:22] happy the human heart was made to be
[1:37:29] happy that heart inside you it was made
[1:37:32] to be happy now what we do is we get it
[1:37:34] kind of patched up good enough where we
[1:37:36] can still belong to a church and mostly
[1:37:38] get along with everybody and keep to
[1:37:39] ourselves and we can coexist with our
[1:37:42] hurts and we can cope with all of our
[1:37:44] baggage and we can just make it
[1:37:47] work
[1:37:48] but don't you just want to let him fix
[1:37:50] it
[1:37:52] amen would wouldn't it be better to not
[1:37:54] carry all that all the time wouldn't it
[1:37:56] be better amen to have such a
[1:37:57] relationship with God where you can hear
[1:37:59] his voice saying come to me come don't
[1:38:01] don't be afraid to go there come to me I
[1:38:05] I'll take that burden off you my my
