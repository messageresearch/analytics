[26:44] pleased with everything that's done and
[26:46] said in your name we pray amen amen you
[26:50] may have your seats this morning I want
[26:52] to preach on or talk or God wants to
[26:55] preach
[26:56] on I should say something that we're all
[26:59] going to see
[27:02] differently and even if it would be all
[27:05] right to
[27:06] say
[27:09] disagree now that would make most
[27:11] ministers
[27:13] nervous
[27:15] uh but I I'm not here to change your
[27:20] conviction not here to change your
[27:22] conviction I'm here to show you what the
[27:24] word of God
[27:26] says what our Prophet says said and tell
[27:30] you to be really
[27:32] careful because you know the Bible says
[27:34] that Satan is going about like a roaring
[27:38] lion
[27:40] seeking whom he may devour and that
[27:43] means he's going around the elect CU he
[27:46] already has the other
[27:49] people and I know we believe in election
[27:52] and predestination and praise God it's
[27:54] the greatest peace you'll ever
[27:56] have but the Bible also o says that if
[27:59] he never shortened the
[28:02] days that even the
[28:05] elect that's if it were possible it's
[28:10] not but if he didn't shorten the
[28:13] days that means the days are
[28:16] evil very
[28:18] evil very very evil and this is what I
[28:22] want to preach
[28:23] on I want to preach on the web
[28:30] and you know our Prophet was a
[28:33] typologist and he typed everything
[28:36] natural to
[28:39] spiritual a
[28:43] spiderweb has three
[28:46] purposes to catch to kill and to
[28:53] destroy it is no mistake that the
[28:56] worldwide web
[29:02] is catching
[29:05] trapping
[29:07] killing and
[29:09] destroying
[29:11] Believers Believers because the other
[29:14] people are already dead see they're
[29:15] already
[29:16] dead amen and I also want you to
[29:21] know I studied this huge in Google and
[29:24] different thoughts and natural a spider
[29:26] web is made out of
[29:29] silk and it's
[29:32] shiny it's an
[29:36] attraction and you can't get away from
[29:38] it you can't stay away from the web but
[29:42] you know for us older
[29:46] people how did we
[29:51] survive there was actually a
[29:55] Time see Satan knows his his time is
[29:58] short yes and he's trying to get as
[30:03] many of least of our
[30:06] kids but as many openly as he
[30:10] can and you know we have uh you know the
[30:14] prophet said this that the things that
[30:16] our kids are fighting now was nothing
[30:18] that he fought then just times that by
[30:21] about a 100 million today you know our
[30:24] Prophet preached about television and
[30:26] magazines
[30:28] and the magazines he was talking about
[30:30] look like the Holy Bible compared to the
[30:33] web now if you question me on that I can
[30:37] show you some privately some
[30:42] pretty
[30:44] amen and there is
[30:46] no you know I I got a question for the
[30:49] parents and and the ones that aren't
[30:51] here are going to be online and the ones
[30:53] that can't listen at this moment will
[30:55] listen later are you going to trust a
[31:00] man-made
[31:02] device with your kids's Eternal
[31:06] destination what I mean by that is you
[31:08] can say oh bless God I got a
[31:11] password you're going to trust your
[31:14] password to
[31:17] Satan really you're going to trust fath
[31:23] recognition to
[31:26] Satan see how we compromise and I'm let
[31:30] me rephrase this I'm not trying to
[31:32] change your opinion on the
[31:34] web I use it to study I use it for the
[31:37] message
[31:43] up you know a brother was showing me
[31:45] just yesterday somebody had face
[31:47] recognition on their up-to-date phone
[31:50] brand new phone and they were in the
[31:53] desert and they turned their face to a
[31:54] camel and it opened their phone
[32:01] oh bless God I'm protecting my
[32:04] kids I think the Bible says that you're
[32:08] no match for
[32:11] Satan that's what our Prophet
[32:14] said you know even the angels weren't a
[32:17] match for Satan CU who was it that
[32:20] prayed in the Bible and and they the
[32:21] Gabriel came down and he was withheld 21
[32:24] Daniel withheld withheld 21 days and it
[32:27] was until he called out until our king
[32:29] of
[32:30] kings and he said I he this I love this
[32:34] testimony Daniel said he said from the
[32:36] moment you prayed I left
[32:38] heaven but I was was withheld by
[32:44] Satan
[32:46] wow bless God I'm going to put her face
[32:48] recognition on my phone that's
[32:51] ridiculous I'm going to put a
[32:52] fingerprint on my
[32:56] phone that might help
[33:00] but I think we need to look at our
[33:01] motive and
[33:03] objective
[33:06] closely and I'm I God's dealt with me
[33:09] that on Facebook because I tell you what
[33:11] I'm very thorough on Facebook very very
[33:14] thorough before I would and I'm going to
[33:17] well God's just dealing with me on it
[33:19] but you know before
[33:21] I would accept somebody on Facebook
[33:23] number one it has to be their own
[33:25] picture number one it has to be their
[33:27] own picture
[33:28] and then I look through any of their
[33:29] profiles and see if there's any
[33:34] skin even just in proper skin of any
[33:36] kind under their
[33:38] page and if there's anything like that
[33:42] and you know there's been multiple
[33:43] Believers that I've sent private
[33:44] messages that they had pornography on
[33:46] their page they didn't even know it some
[33:48] of them never even answered me never
[33:50] even know but they they they would send
[33:51] me a friend request they had per and I
[33:53] would send them a private message and I
[33:55] said I won't friend request you until
[33:56] you get rid of your pornography they has
[33:57] never even got back to me yet what kind
[34:00] of a testimony is that we say we're
[34:02] serving God we're we we are but our
[34:07] actions are serving the devil because
[34:09] everybody that sees that a stumbling but
[34:11] do we know what the Bible says it'd be
[34:12] better that you weren't born to to
[34:14] stumble one of the little ones of these
[34:16] that look at my Facebook and so and
[34:18] Satan I know I know Satan can I've even
[34:21] put up things in my page I said if
[34:22] there's something improper I didn't put
[34:23] it there people can put it
[34:25] there I understand that but then now now
[34:30] this is for me this this sentence is for
[34:32] me but then do we need it now I'll show
[34:36] you things that you need you know we
[34:37] just had a pastor Pastor uh uh Nestor
[34:40] came from menel I've preached from him
[34:43] twice uh has you know was a good friend
[34:46] like I've known him very well and he was
[34:48] coming to Ontario we met with him and
[34:50] had a good time met different Fellowship
[34:52] around next year he said when he comes
[34:54] he's coming he's going to have time for
[34:55] us to preach and that and he couldn't
[34:58] get a hold of me on Whatsapp and he
[35:00] don't have Facebook and so he contacted
[35:03] a pastor in the Philippines that knows
[35:05] me and sent me a private message now
[35:09] see if I get rid of Facebook then I
[35:12] couldn't have got that
[35:15] message so see you know you know your
[35:18] Prophet said that he didn't have a
[35:20] problem with
[35:22] television he said that if the right
[35:24] stuff's on it God can use it for good I
[35:27] have the
[35:28] but then he said God told me not to have
[35:30] one and he said it'll take you to
[35:33] hell now that's quite a bit of different
[35:35] topic it's quite a bit different topic
[35:38] but so you and so I know I'm scattered
[35:41] and I'm just I'm just I'm just bringing
[35:43] stuff to your notification but you
[35:45] know
[35:47] uh uh you know we all most of us if not
[35:51] directly you know we got young families
[35:53] if we don't have our own kids we're
[35:54] going to have our grandkids and I'm not
[35:56] just picking on kids but
[35:59] man well I'm not old enough to handle
[36:01] this stuff that's on
[36:03] Facebook so like how's my 13-year-old
[36:07] grandson you know what the prophet said
[36:09] about the TV and stuff that's on TV he
[36:10] said forget about having Revival if
[36:13] you're showing them not on the TV you're
[36:14] wasting your
[36:19] time
[36:23] wow you know I showed some Believers and
[36:25] and I'm I'm laying a foundation and I'm
[36:28] going to take my time and if I don't
[36:29] finish we got till God takes us home I
[36:32] showed some Believers and I have it on
[36:34] my phone and it's if for mature people I
[36:37] could show it to but I was a member of
[36:40] evening
[36:42] light uh forget what it was it's evening

[36:46] message group now people add me all the
[36:48] time I'm in like four pastors message

[36:56] know I I still have to pray and study
[36:58] and stuff you know you know I had a
[37:00] brother messaged me yesterday this is
[37:02] this is just as fresh as it can get and
[37:05] he said I'm it was yesterday

[37:12] know uh and by the way we thank God for
[37:15] the amazing cool temperature man you
[37:17] want to see a miracle the last two
[37:20] Sundays the Saturday before it was 32 de

[37:30] condition every Sunday so you can enjoy
[37:32] the word free of charge he's amazing
[37:35] amen you know this brother called to me
[37:38] and he said I'm just on my way back from

[37:46] a pastor you say oh you push that off he
[37:47] said well that's what he's supposed to
[37:48] do he said but we're going to go back at
[37:51] 4:30 have another prayer service and he
[37:54] said I got a meeting with the young kids
[37:57] in the church because Satan's after our
[38:04] kids and if you don't think he is you
[38:07] you're already deceived tremendously
[38:10] Satan is after our kids amen and so back
[38:15] I was in this member of this evening
[38:16] light Tabernacle and there's people on
[38:18] there that's preached for
[38:20] me there's pastors there from South
[38:23] Africa that I've met in Ottawa and
[38:25] preached for people I know and like
[38:27] amazing people there's people that were
[38:30] on there that you know locally like
[38:34] Believers flat out
[38:41] Believers hundreds of
[38:45] them and I took pictures to prove it
[38:47] that and it shows the pictures I took it
[38:49] showed who were the three Believers in
[38:51] charge of the group dedicated message
[38:54] believers
[38:58] and then the next picture I took was was
[39:00] picture of brother brandham with the
[39:02] background of an eagle and maybe the you
[39:04] know I'm not sure if the pillar of fire
[39:06] the clouds there and right underneath of
[39:11] it there two of the worst pornography
[39:14] pictures you have ever seen in your
[39:20] life and I left the group
[39:29] you know if it gets to the point that
[39:30] technology we can't keep it clean then
[39:33] we can't use it you know there was
[39:35] actually five-fold Ministry before there
[39:36] was the web you know like you know you
[39:40] actually can preach without the web like
[39:43] I'm not led by the web to preach I'm
[39:45] actually led by the Holy Spirit to
[39:46] preach amen I can actually go back to
[39:49] paper you know I I don't I don't mind
[39:50] turning paper paper is a thing where you
[39:52] you know you lick your finger and it
[39:54] sticks and then you oh that that's
[39:58] technology that's pretty amazing and you
[40:00] know there is nobody outside that
[40:02] technology that if they don't have this
[40:05] book can touch that page go when I turn
[40:09] that
[40:11] page my eyes won't
[40:17] burn but when I touch the page on my
[40:21] iPad MH so you can tell me all you want
[40:25] that you're just doing message stuff on
[40:27] on
[40:28] there Satan knows how to get in there
[40:30] too and I have those pictures on my snap
[40:33] thing on my phone as proof it has the
[40:36] pictures of all the people on the
[40:38] group
[40:41] names amen so Satan's still Satan amen
[40:46] and so let let's just move on Ephesians
[40:49] 6 you know finally my brethren be strong
[40:51] in the Lord and the power of His might
[40:53] put on the whole armor of God that you
[40:55] may be able to stand against the wild of
[40:57] the devil for we wrestle not against
[40:59] flesh and blood but against
[41:00] principalities against Powers against
[41:03] rulers and darkness of this world and
[41:06] against spiritual wickedness in high
[41:08] places wherefore take onto you the whole
[41:11] armor of God that you may be able to
[41:14] stand in what day the evil day having
[41:17] done all to
[41:21] stand Ephesians 610 that start at 10 you
[41:24] know I got I got to speed up my my pace
[41:27] we're going to be here for eternity but
[41:29] you know this is something we have to
[41:31] deal
[41:33] with this is something you're going to
[41:35] have to you're going to answer at the
[41:37] Judgment God bless you you're going to
[41:39] answer at the Judgment for for how you
[41:41] handle this now the web it for spreading
[41:44] you you know you can say you can spread
[41:46] the gospel with the web it has can be
[41:49] one of the well one of the greatest
[41:51] things for me as a minister is a message
[41:54] Hub it it's just been amazing
[42:01] but we're crossing bridges that we've
[42:04] never went
[42:05] before let me say it like that we're
[42:07] crossing Bridges and you can say well
[42:09] bless God you know I've got the Holy
[42:12] Ghost and none of this stuff will even
[42:13] hurt me it hurt the
[42:16] prophet I'm going to read you some
[42:18] things he said about it it would have
[42:20] hurt him he recognized it he said
[42:22] remember this in in a deceived Church by
[42:25] the world he said remember we're not on
[42:26] a niic but we're in a battlefield and
[42:29] many people just think that they become
[42:31] a Christian and that all they need to do
[42:33] is sit there forever and the Christians
[42:35] and everything is going to come easy
[42:37] don't you never get that in your head
[42:39] for becoming a Christian is to fight and
[42:42] fight the good fight of Faith he said I
[42:46] become a Christian to get into the
[42:47] battle lines he said I'm a Christian
[42:49] Soldier and we got to train and be
[42:53] brought up and know now watch this this
[42:56] I'm reading and these are all available
[42:59] to know all the
[43:02] tactics
[43:04] uhoh of the
[43:06] enemy that's called the
[43:08] web and to know how to fortify and to
[43:12] know how to fight the fight and we can
[43:16] only do what the Holy Spirit has
[43:17] revealed to
[43:21] us and we cannot take what some other
[43:25] you know Nation or person tells us to go
[43:29] to war and their ideas but we got to
[43:31] take what the Holy Spirit would direct
[43:33] us and what his idea that would give us
[43:36] because he the holy spirit is our
[43:40] commanding Chief priest of this
[43:44] Army
[43:45] amen wow I want to read the one where
[43:49] brother Brown said in I had a a sister I
[43:52] was looking for it and you know these
[43:53] quotes you look from wrong I knew what I
[43:55] wanted but a sister help me beauti
[43:57] yesterday he said I'm so tired he said
[44:00] look I look this way and I look this way
[44:02] now this is brother
[44:05] brandham now if anybody had a Vindicated
[44:10] life and everything's
[44:13] Immortal immoral sorry and I had to put
[44:17] a little crucifix across hanging on the
[44:21] front of my car
[44:23] mirror cuz some person riding by me the
[44:27] the other day now if it was so evil that
[44:30] he had to look through the cross I'm
[44:32] going to have to start laying a cross on
[44:33] my
[44:36] iPad and I said I see so much evil on
[44:39] the street now just to refresh your mem
[44:43] he died in
[44:49] 65 that was a pretty
[44:51] tame
[44:54] age I see so much Eve on the street
[44:57] Street and when I see the evil I look by
[44:59] the cross and think oh God how you how I
[45:03] love you for saving me from such
[45:06] corruption that's right let him always
[45:08] be before your
[45:11] face if you're on the web for the wrong
[45:14] reason he's not before your
[45:17] face so if now I don't mean this wrong
[45:20] I'm not a talking anybody and I want to
[45:22] lay some foundations and read some
[45:23] quotes and that but like why do you have
[45:26] the web
[45:29] if you're you know what I'm
[45:32] saying and I'm not trying to justify sin
[45:35] or that but if you're you know you want
[45:36] to search into the message and every
[45:38] time you go but if you just want to be
[45:40] connected to Satan in another
[45:48] country watch this the web came out in
[45:51] January 1st
[45:55] 1983 and it never became public and
[45:58] worldwide until '
[46:00] 889 I would have been 20 years old
[46:03] before it was
[46:06] public you know in 1990 there
[46:11] was 3 million people on the web by 93 it
[46:16] moved up to 16
[46:20] million by 2000 70% of adults in the
[46:25] world were on the web
[46:29] and
[46:35] there's there was around
[46:37] 361 million on the internet in 2000
[46:42] would anybody like to guess how many is
[46:43] on the internet
[46:47] today
[46:50] billions 2 and A5
[46:54] billion how many of them are professing
[47:02] Believers I'll let you decide do you
[47:05] know we have a brother that preached
[47:06] here and a fantastic brother James a
[47:08] wonderful brother and you know he went
[47:10] into computer technology and all this
[47:13] and he was telling me this he's preached
[47:14] for us many times and and a beautiful
[47:17] brother and he said when he finished his
[47:20] college degree in Toronto his Professor
[47:23] told him now he has a big job some big
[47:25] company and making good money he said
[47:29] every one of you in this classroom can
[47:30] decide today whether you're going to go
[47:33] legal or
[47:36] illegal and make a living doing
[47:40] it so the 50% of the class that went
[47:44] illegal could be making more of the
[47:46] people that went to actually got a
[47:49] job to tap into your
[47:52] web you cannot control your web you are
[47:55] no match to the devil your password your

[49:02] Brown talked about the web and the first
[49:04] one was the world's falling part in ' 63

[49:08] look at this he said you know I was
[49:10] parking my car the other day and he said
[49:12] a man said unto me he said preacher he
[49:14] said what are we going to do about all
[49:16] these kids juvenile
[49:19] delinquency and he said I said cut out

[49:29] problem I tell you what the buger on the
[49:32] television is like a tame lamb compared
[49:34] to the alligator
[49:36] tiger that's on the
[49:38] web here's another one where just and I
[49:42] have multiple ones on my phone and
[49:45] different ones that we'll never get to
[49:46] today but he said the greatest disgrace
[49:49] and it talks about it was the the
[49:50] downfall of America and he said it's
[49:52] exactly being censored and all here this
[49:55] stuff they put in front of our young
[49:59] kids I don't care how you block your
[50:01] kids if you have the web in your house

[50:05] kids he said if all this stuff they put
[50:10] in front of our young kids and things
[50:11] like that and now the devil has put it
[50:13] in every

[50:36] through the he says the television but I
[50:39] going to say the web and everything else

[51:10] amazing how he he he talks about it even
[51:13] before his time by uh by Revelation by
[51:17] Vision in Deuteronomy 410 to 11 Amy
[51:21] maybe you can pull this up he said
[51:24] especially the day that thou stood us
[51:26] before the Lord Lord thy the god of
[51:28] Horeb even the Lord saith unto me gather
[51:31] the people together and I will make them
[51:33] hear my words and they may learn to fear
[51:36] me all the days of they that they shall
[51:38] live upon the Earth that they may teach
[51:41] their children and they may come near
[51:43] and stood under the mountain and the
[51:45] mountain burned with fire in the midst
[51:48] of heaven with darkness and the clouds
[51:51] and the thickness of darkness and if you
[51:54] continue on reading another few verses
[51:56] which we not just for time it actually
[51:58] talks how God spoke out of the fire by
[52:02] the mountain amen and and and I would
[52:05] encourage you if you if you could go on
[52:07] to read this but I want I I want to read
[52:09] exactly the scriptures that our Prophet
[52:11] read and these messages in Hebrews
[52:15] 12 in Hebrews 12:25 and I actually put
[52:18] down to 29 but we're going to read 25
[52:21] and see that ye do not refuse
[52:24] him that speaketh
[52:27] for if they escape not who refuse him
[52:31] that spake on the earth much more shall
[52:33] you not Escape if you have turned away
[52:36] from him that speaketh from
[52:39] Heaven amen I don't have brother Dale

[53:22] flesh amen here brother Brown he said
[53:27] he said it shoved one way and another he
[53:28] said and oh God he said they see the
[53:30] councel of
[53:32] Believers he says churches as they so
[53:35] call it he said they see they're moving
[53:37] right into the
[53:38] Trap Lord like a spider web weaving a
[53:44] web this was the prophet and the world
[53:47] is falling apart in 63 and he mentioned
[53:50] it after this quote after he read those
[53:52] scriptures that the church where was
[53:55] moving right into the
[53:59] spiderweb of the deceit of Satan he said

[54:56] I'm reading still reading the same
[54:58] scriptures of our Prophet truly my soul
[55:01] waiteth upon the Lord from him cometh my
[55:04] salvation he alone is my rock and my
[55:06] salvation he is my defense and I shall
[55:09] not be greatly moved how long will ye
[55:12] imagine Mischief against a man ye shall
[55:16] be slain all of you as a bowling
[55:20] wall shall ye be and as a torting
[55:24] tottering fence
[55:27] they only counsel to cast him down from
[55:29] his Excellency and they delighted in
[55:31] lies bless they bless with their mouth
[55:35] but they curse inwardly Sheila my soul
[55:38] waiteth upon thee Oh
[55:43] God for my expectation is from him and
[55:47] he alone is my rock and my salvation and
[55:49] he is my defense and I shall not be
[55:52] moved and God is my salvation and my
[55:55] glory The Rock and strength of my refuge
[55:57] is in God and I trust in him at all
[56:00] times and ye people pour out your heart
[56:03] before him for God is our refuge now
[56:06] here let me just go right into what
[56:08] brother Brown said in this Shalom
[56:11] message exactly here paragraph 42 and
[56:15] this is a 64 message amen before a
[56:18] prophet went home the difference is just
[56:20] like it was in the beginning when there
[56:23] was a gross Darkness upon the Earth the
[56:26] spirit of God is moving upon the faces
[56:29] of the water and said let there be light
[56:31] and God separated the light from the
[56:35] darkness and I believe that we are now
[56:37] living in the hour again when God is
[56:40] separating the light from the darkness
[56:41] and he's pressing it on the other side
[56:44] of the world that the light will be made
[56:48] manifested as we are now it's the
[56:51] decisions you'll make now just watch
[56:53] we're going to get to our our climax
[56:55] here and he's and they're just like they
[56:58] want to be but there's something wrong
[57:00] let the same message here let them do it
[57:03] it seems like there's a heaviness do you
[57:08] know with Facebook there's more people
[57:10] that commit suicide on Facebook than
[57:13] there was before that because if
[57:15] somebody don't put 300 likes on it or
[57:18] 400 comments or they go into depression
[57:21] have to go to the doctor and get a
[57:22] bottle of pills
[57:27] heaviness and now you tell
[57:30] someone that they should not do such and
[57:33] such a thing and the people look upon
[57:36] that and
[57:38] believes that they want to believe it
[57:41] but there's something that presses them
[57:44] the other way see the poor thing I feel
[57:47] so sorry for them they're so caught now
[57:51] this is a prophet and
[57:54] 64 I pray you'll hear me
[57:57] he said they're so caught in such a
[58:03] web of
[58:07] Hollywood now this Social Web that we
[58:11] have is we'll just name it
[58:14] hell forget the Hollywood part it's
[58:17] lower than that if that's even
[58:21] possible our Prophet actually mentioned
[58:23] the web in three messages
[58:27] and the advertisements on television and
[58:31] radio and newspaper and on the street
[58:34] and in the store windows with modern
[58:37] with moral dress and so forth and that
[58:40] way and the other people meet them and
[58:44] they've seen to be that there's
[58:46] something that they just that they just
[58:50] can't pull away
[58:53] from and our young people and our old
[58:57] people and our middleaged
[59:01] people the
[59:02] web of
[59:05] Hollywood is like a Cilan magnet you
[59:09] know you've seen pictures on Facebook or
[59:11] or on the web you've seen pictures
[59:13] ridiculous it would make you laugh but
[59:15] it's disgusting where people walk right
[59:16] out in front of cars semis trains walk
[59:20] into light posts on the phone fall
[59:22] downstairs walk into swimming pools
[59:27] seriously I'm not I don't make this up
[59:29] by the
[59:30] thousands because
[59:40] they're that's more than a
[59:42] disease that's a spirit no matter of
[59:46] fact that's a
[59:48] demon and it that demon has got your
[59:50] shoulders and it's
[59:54] just and the the Bible only says there's
[59:56] one person that's supposed to have your
[59:58] shoulders says the footsteps of the
[1:00:00] righteous are ordered of the Lord and
[1:00:03] somebody on that kind of a device is not
[1:00:04] ordered of the
[1:00:07] Lord no way and what's this cause it
[1:00:11] causes a gross same message causes a
[1:00:14] gross Darkness on the
[1:00:17] people it's something that presses into
[1:00:21] them like the Jews was in the days that
[1:00:24] Jesus was on Earth Isaiah prophesied of
[1:00:27] it and said there would be that they
[1:00:29] would be they would have eyes and they
[1:00:32] couldn't see and there will be years I'm
[1:00:34] going tell you something I'm I can I
[1:00:36] make a prophecy this morning there will
[1:00:37] be people listen to this message on the
[1:00:39] web maybe even present here and they'll
[1:00:42] just go away and
[1:00:45] those that was just brother Dale okay
[1:00:49] but when I get over there and I stand
[1:00:50] before the
[1:00:53] Judgment I'm going to have this year
[1:00:55] thing all clean cuz I I preach what the
[1:00:58] Holy Spirit told me to
[1:01:00] preach amen he said they have eyes but
[1:01:03] they can't see and they have ears
[1:01:04] because they can't hear and the reason
[1:01:06] is Jesus prayed their forgiveness
[1:01:09] because it had made them fulfill the
[1:01:12] scriptures and it's returned again to us
[1:01:14] today and the D Bible spoke of it in
[1:01:17] this day that we live in and that these
[1:01:19] things would come a gross Darkness on
[1:01:21] the people and we see it and there's
[1:01:24] something that's just simply the people
[1:01:27] but they
[1:01:28] can't they can't shake
[1:01:31] it it's called the
[1:01:34] web it's made out of silk and it's shiny
[1:01:39] and it's three purposes is to catch you
[1:01:42] to kill and hold you so you can be eaten
[1:01:47] desty to destroy
[1:01:50] you amen now here our Prophet preached
[1:01:53] in 6512 just literally a few days before
[1:01:56] he died in the leadership
[1:01:59] message amen and he reads the scripture
[1:02:02] in Mark and we're I'm not going to read
[1:02:04] I I just feel to pass it and I I hit it
[1:02:06] Mark to pass it but he reads the
[1:02:08] scripture of the Rich Young Ruler and
[1:02:10] how he came and said you know how must I
[1:02:12] be saved and Jesus told him what he must
[1:02:15] do and he had great possessions and then
[1:02:17] let's just go to Hebrews 12:25 so this
[1:02:20] is a leadership one right literally
[1:02:23] about the fourth last message before he
[1:02:24] preaches and he mess is the Hub again
[1:02:27] Hebrews 12:25 he said see that ye
[1:02:30] refused on him that speaketh now we read
[1:02:33] a scripture really close to that before
[1:02:36] in Thessalonians I believe it
[1:02:38] was say you refus on him to speak us for
[1:02:41] they escape not who refuse him that
[1:02:44] speak on Earth much more shall they not
[1:02:47] ye Escape if ye return away from him oh
[1:02:50] maybe I did already read that I'm sorry
[1:02:52] him from Heaven
[1:02:54] sorry Matthew 2 4 and 24 for there shall
[1:02:58] arise false christs and false prophets
[1:03:00] and we know the scripture by heart and
[1:03:01] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:03:04] much that it would if it were possible
[1:03:06] it would deceive the great elect now in
[1:03:08] that scripture brother Brown compares
[1:03:10] the great signs and wonders to even the
[1:03:12] states and shooting atomic bombs and the
[1:03:14] Wonders they would do with money and and
[1:03:17] and and you know and like their
[1:03:20] education and all this thing like he he
[1:03:23] Compares this to the W
[1:03:27] the false Christ but they would be
[1:03:30] deceived by magnificent things people
[1:03:32] will be deceived by the web and they
[1:03:35] will justify it all day
[1:03:37] long and their kids are being fed to
[1:03:41] Lions amen if you play with fire you're
[1:03:44] going to get burnt I don't give my kids
[1:03:47] matches in the hay
[1:03:49] bur why would I give them my cell phone
[1:03:52] in the hay barn
[1:03:59] amen might just have a
[1:04:02] purpose you know I read a scripture just
[1:04:05] a secular men and he said at what point
[1:04:07] would it be okay to give your kid an
[1:04:09] iPhone or an Apple phone he said as soon
[1:04:12] as you want to lose their
[1:04:18] innocency uh do you know that most
[1:04:21] people's
[1:04:22] marriages are destroyed by pornography
[1:04:27] I now I know brother Dale I just got a
[1:04:29] grade two education but I don't
[1:04:31] understand how you can be sleeping with
[1:04:32] a bride a beautiful wonderful girl that
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:36] marry and you get
[1:04:39] so possessed of the devil that you would
[1:04:43] destroy your marriage for a screen of a
[1:04:49] picture you can't educate out of
[1:04:53] that that's a devil
[1:04:56] that is a
[1:05:00] devil
[1:05:04] unbelievable amen we know God is the
[1:05:07] word and and Jesus is the same yesterday
[1:05:09] today and forever you know the prophet
[1:05:11] said this and preaching this message in
[1:05:13] leadership he said for you to be able to
[1:05:16] accept this message this
[1:05:18] morning you have to accept eternal
[1:05:22] life he said for you to be able to he
[1:05:24] said Moses
[1:05:26] for him to be able to accept his calling
[1:05:29] he had to accept eternal life and turn
[1:05:31] down the web of
[1:05:34] Egypt well that
[1:05:38] hurt you don't think he was walking on
[1:05:40] gold palaces and silk lace curtains and
[1:05:44] had girls popping grapes in his
[1:05:47] mouth be eged girls popping grapes in
[1:05:50] his mouth and he left that for the
[1:05:52] desert to run for his life
[1:05:55] and the Bible says that he he never even
[1:05:58] considered that
[1:06:00] web for the riches of
[1:06:06] Glory
[1:06:09] wow that's in Hebrews
[1:06:12] 11 and our Prophet mentioned the
[1:06:15] scripture Hebrews 11:23 let's just move
[1:06:18] on to our last one of our last later
[1:06:20] quotes here this is a prayer that
[1:06:23] brother Brown says in his leadership
[1:06:25] message he said oh great leader of
[1:06:27] eternal life he said we accept your
[1:06:30] promise tonight
[1:06:32] father and I plead for this people here
[1:06:34] now this is four messages before our
[1:06:37] Prophet died he said I plead for this
[1:06:39] every one of them in the name of Jesus
[1:06:42] Christ Our Lord and I pray Christ the
[1:06:45] son of God will come in the hearts of
[1:06:48] each one of us Lord and mold us and make
[1:06:50] us a new creature in Christ Jesus Grant
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:53] Lord and he said we love you you and we
[1:07:01] want we want you to change us and we and
[1:07:06] we want to be your children and we want
[1:07:08] to feel your spirit moving in our heart
[1:07:11] and Tenderly with us and bring us to the
[1:07:14] recognition that this
[1:07:18] insane
[1:07:21] age I wasn't even born then
[1:07:26] the hippie
[1:07:29] age this insane age that we're living in
[1:07:32] granted God when we see young people so
[1:07:37] caught
[1:07:40] up in the web of the
[1:07:45] devil that's in the leadership message
[1:07:48] and that's in paragraph
[1:07:50] 332 in the
[1:07:53] web of the the
[1:08:00] devil young
[1:08:02] men perverted
[1:08:04] Minds
[1:08:06] children dop btics cigarette smoking
[1:08:11] drinking in maral Satan's
[1:08:17] Eden leadership
[1:08:20] message 1965
[1:08:27] you know that sounds a lot like Paul
[1:08:30] Harvey's news broadcast where he said If
[1:08:33] I Were the
[1:08:34] Devil I would keep doing
[1:08:37] exactly what I'm
[1:08:41] doing if you want to know what that I
[1:08:43] don't have it in front of me right
[1:08:45] now but it's basically that one line
[1:08:48] that our Prophet
[1:08:54] read bring drugs in the school make
[1:08:56] sniff M dogs make marriage cheap
[1:08:59] swinging better you know break up the
[1:09:02] family bring out the web bring out
[1:09:06] pornography the hippie
[1:09:08] AG just keep doing what we're
[1:09:11] doing and you know it I like talking to
[1:09:14] the Believers in the other side of the
[1:09:16] world but I I you know there's something
[1:09:17] I've realized and and and like I said
[1:09:21] the web like brother Brown said there's
[1:09:24] if the right thing on television it's
[1:09:28] okay but there's something different
[1:09:30] about
[1:09:32] television you know brother Brown used
[1:09:34] to preach about if you watched the movie
[1:09:37] he said was the problem with the movie
[1:09:38] if the movie was clean it was the ads
[1:09:41] that come on in the entertainment of the
[1:09:43] movie that paid the money to be on the
[1:09:47] television but the
[1:09:49] web it's worse than that because you
[1:09:52] can't stop the webs coming
[1:09:55] see you know why God's dealt with me on
[1:09:57] Facebook is and I've showed some of
[1:09:58] these things to my wife you know and the
[1:10:01] last and this week I blocked two numbers
[1:10:03] on my Facebook where I opened my thing
[1:10:05] and it was something improper they're
[1:10:07] not my friends I don't follow them I'm
[1:10:08] not connected to them I've never seen
[1:10:10] them never heard of them that and
[1:10:11] they're
[1:10:12] not how are they on my
[1:10:19] page and I blocked them so I won't see
[1:10:22] those two
[1:10:23] again this ain't working
[1:10:33] amen I I've had it before where I was
[1:10:36] buying uh tractor tires looking at
[1:10:38] tractor tires with my thing and on this
[1:10:40] side of the screen there was little tiny
[1:10:41] pictures there was bare naked women
[1:10:43] going up and down they just wanted you
[1:10:44] to push on one of them then of course it
[1:10:46] would come up now I'm buying tractor
[1:10:50] tires is that the only place you can buy
[1:10:52] tractor tires you know when we preached
[1:10:54] before and I even preaching a said the
[1:10:56] dove will only go where you must
[1:10:59] go now if there's another place to buy
[1:11:01] tires you're not going to get to heaven
[1:11:02] say well God I had to buy tires on the
[1:11:04] internet because I couldn't just walk in
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:09] shoing you're not going to lie to
[1:11:13] God
[1:11:16] Amen you're definitely not going to tell
[1:11:18] God that I had to listen to the word of
[1:11:20] God on a mechanical device because a
[1:11:23] prophet said repeatedly that God would
[1:11:24] never use a mechanical device to preach
[1:11:26] the word of
[1:11:31] God you know repeatedly you know when I
[1:11:34] looked up television I think the prophet
[1:11:36] mentioned television about 539 times and
[1:11:39] you know at least half of them were I
[1:11:41] don't have a television program so I
[1:11:43] don't have to beg you for
[1:11:46] money so the prophet clearly could
[1:11:50] clearly could have went on television
[1:11:57] but we think we can't have a Ministry
[1:11:59] unless we're on
[1:12:01] television and God's up there
[1:12:05] like that's
[1:12:07] hilarious if God didn't choose to put
[1:12:09] one of the Seven Stars on the TV that
[1:12:13] were laying the foundation for the
[1:12:15] revelation of the
[1:12:17] Mysteries he don't need a puppy
[1:12:21] like you don't need a puppy like brother
[1:12:23] Dale cuz I'm I'm sharing the Mysteries
[1:12:27] but I ain't laying the foundations of
[1:12:28] the Mysteries they're
[1:12:30] revealed
[1:12:33] amen would it be okay if I read that
[1:12:35] again this this was this is in the this
[1:12:39] is in the the leadership message I just
[1:12:43] trying to find the end of it I'm not to
[1:12:44] the end yeah leadership
[1:12:46] 1265 paragraph
[1:12:49] 332 the people are caught up in the web
[1:12:52] of the devil young people people
[1:12:55] perverted Minds children dope
[1:13:00] addicts cigarettes smoking drinking
[1:13:03] Immortal Satan's Eden and God has taken
[1:13:07] you 6,000 years including to the
[1:13:10] according to the Bible to build Eden and
[1:13:13] you put your sons and your wives in
[1:13:15] there his bride to rule over
[1:13:18] it and sat so he's talking about his
[1:13:21] bride now and Satan has come in and
[1:13:23] perverted it and it's took him 6,000
[1:13:26] years to he's talking about back in Eden
[1:13:28] you know when he had Adam and Eve and
[1:13:30] and Satan took 6,000 to pervert it now
[1:13:32] God's taking 6,000 years to build his
[1:13:35] own well he's talking here Satan's
[1:13:38] eating sorry it's hard to follow him
[1:13:40] Satan has come around and perverted it
[1:13:42] and he took 6,000 years to build his own
[1:13:44] watch this web that's basically what
[1:13:47] he's saying intelligent Eden through
[1:13:49] Science Education and so-called
[1:13:53] intelligence
[1:13:55] and he's build it into a mess of
[1:14:02] death 333 paragraph oh God take us back
[1:14:07] to the Eden Lord where there was no
[1:14:10] death where there was no sorrow Grant it
[1:14:12] Lord that we stand humbly and wait for
[1:14:14] the second Adam who has come for his
[1:14:17] bride and make us part of Him Father we
[1:14:19] pray in Jesus name there's the prayer of
[1:14:23] our prophet
[1:14:25] four messages at the end of the
[1:14:30] message praying for the
[1:14:32] web he back then was praying for my
[1:14:35] grandkids that I hope will'll never see
[1:14:37] the
[1:14:41] web and you know even if you protect all
[1:14:44] your kids like how would my kids go with
[1:14:47] any other human person they could just
[1:14:50] walk by the grocery store and see the
[1:14:52] web on their phone or
[1:14:55] Satan's
[1:14:57] everywhere and I mean like when so the
[1:15:01] Bible says this he said when you've done
[1:15:02] all you can do
[1:15:07] stand God will do the
[1:15:10] rest but some of us aren't doing very
[1:15:12] much God's getting really tired covering
[1:15:15] up for
[1:15:17] us
[1:15:19] amen God help
[1:15:22] us here's a Queen of Sheba he said more
[1:15:25] of our children can tell you more about
[1:15:26] David Crockett and Gunsmoke and some of
[1:15:29] them than they can tell you about Jesus
[1:15:31] Christ it's because of what they're
[1:15:33] taught in the homes and then talk about
[1:15:36] ju juvant delinquency he said it's the
[1:15:39] parent delinquency and now this could
[1:15:43] hurt Church delinquency and that's
[1:15:46] exactly right and it's preacher
[1:15:49] delinquency of preaching the word and
[1:15:53] God working through the
[1:15:56] church so see I'm just clearing out of
[1:15:58] that part I'm pre what you do with it in
[1:16:01] your home that's up to you he said
[1:16:03] ananas and safaris were living in the
[1:16:05] church and he said on the side of the
[1:16:08] church and never called out by the
[1:16:11] preacher and told them of their sins
[1:16:13] because they were the heaviest
[1:16:16] payers there was in the
[1:16:19] church so the people wouldn't preach
[1:16:21] against them because they give the most
[1:16:23] in the plate
[1:16:26] John 66 John 6 and
[1:16:29] 66 brother Jose preached on this the
[1:16:32] second message at camp and it really
[1:16:35] blessed my heart and I I want to close
[1:16:37] with this and I want to read a just a
[1:16:40] few uh quotes on my phone if uh if
[1:16:43] that's all right we're still in good
[1:16:45] time you
[1:16:48] know brother Jose was mentioned this if
[1:16:52] you look at the numbers uh 6
[1:16:58] 6 this number in the Bible you know
[1:17:01] nothing happens for a mistake you see
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:03] number uhhuh that's the number of men it
[1:17:07] goes perfectly with the number of the
[1:17:10] scripture and from that time many of his
[1:17:13] disciples went back and never listened
[1:17:15] to what he preached about the
[1:17:17] web
[1:17:19] anymore
[1:17:21] 666 it ain't the number of the Beast
[1:17:24] it's a number of men it is the number of
[1:17:27] the beast but it's the number of
[1:17:29] men it's like we're not listening to you
[1:17:32] God uh that's kind of what it says here
[1:17:34] the disciples said we're not listening
[1:17:36] to you no more we have our own church
[1:17:40] doctrine by the way we're under Moses
[1:17:43] bless God we have the
[1:17:48] law uh 2 Thessalonians 2 10 and 12 it's
[1:17:52] my last scripture and I'm just going to
[1:17:53] close with some
[1:17:57] quotes and with all
[1:18:00] deceivious deceive help me out here H
[1:18:03] deceivableness
[1:18:04] and unrighteousness in them
[1:18:08] that perish because they receive not
[1:18:14] thee and you know brother Jose was
[1:18:17] saying this so
[1:18:18] beautifully you can have the truth and
[1:18:21] go to hell truth the hell hell will be
[1:18:24] filled with message M Believers a matter
[1:18:26] of fact Satan himself is a message
[1:18:28] believer he don't he can't he can't live
[1:18:30] it he can't have faith he can't confess
[1:18:33] Jesus but he knows it's the truth he
[1:18:35] knows this is the
[1:18:37] truth but they had not the love they had
[1:18:41] the truth but they didn't have the love
[1:18:44] for the
[1:18:45] truth that they might be saved because
[1:18:47] they didn't love the
[1:18:50] truth see the truth can only set you
[1:18:52] free if you love it
[1:18:57] but because they didn't love the
[1:19:02] truth because they receive
[1:19:06] not the love of the
[1:19:10] truth and for this cause God sent them a
[1:19:14] strong delusion you know what that
[1:19:15] delusion is oh bless God you know my web
[1:19:18] in my home it'll never see another
[1:19:22] pornography picture ever you're a
[1:19:27] liar there's not no there's not one
[1:19:30] person alive breathing could make that
[1:19:33] prediction and hold to it by Satan in
[1:19:36] the web I don't care how many holy
[1:19:39] ghosts you
[1:19:42] have he give them a strong delusion that
[1:19:45] they may believe a lie that they might
[1:19:47] be damned who believe not the
[1:19:50] truth but have
[1:19:52] pleasure in onri
[1:19:56] God help
[1:19:59] us you know we want to close with it
[1:20:03] like this I just want to get my phone
[1:20:05] for one
[1:20:12] second the
[1:20:14] web in
[1:20:18] itself is not
[1:20:21] evil but Satan has taken it
[1:20:25] and used it for evil and this is the
[1:20:28] part I want to drive home to you what
[1:20:30] you do with this message is entirely up
[1:20:33] to you but I want you to not be deceived
[1:20:37] that you cannot hide from Satan in the
[1:20:41] web and if you think you
[1:20:46] can you are
[1:20:49] deceived there is no locking no blocking
[1:20:53] no nothing that will hide from
[1:20:57] anything if you can get in an evening
[1:21:00] light Tabernacle
[1:21:01] message ministers group and post
[1:21:05] pornography under our prophets picture
[1:21:08] you can go
[1:21:10] anywhere I could probably show you a
[1:21:13] dozen to two dozen people that sent me
[1:21:15] friend requests that are believers
[1:21:17] around the world and they don't even
[1:21:19] know it and they have pornography on
[1:21:20] their
[1:21:23] Facebook and I open my Facebook and
[1:21:26] there ain't nothing that's supposed to
[1:21:27] be on there and it's called
[1:21:29] ads and they're never about church and
[1:21:32] serving the Holy
[1:21:35] Ghost because it's controlled by
[1:21:39] Satan it's controlled by
[1:21:45] Satan
[1:21:47] amen he said we don't have a television
[1:21:50] and there won't be one in my home never
[1:21:54] but there that's up to you what you do
[1:21:59] but God told me not to have
[1:22:03] one and then we moved into this house
[1:22:06] down West and we rented a sweet old
[1:22:09] sister's house up here and she had a
[1:22:11] television and they have it to rent in
[1:22:14] her
[1:22:16] house I want to read I'm just reading
[1:22:18] some invisible Union here he said here
[1:22:21] here's just short quote she said she was
[1:22:23] deceived
[1:22:25] by
[1:22:26] television by magazines and by all those
[1:22:30] people that had
[1:22:33] them you just compare that to the
[1:22:35] worldwide
[1:22:37] web you've seen so much on television
[1:22:41] and so much of the things of the world
[1:22:43] that it's so easy for the old Adam
[1:22:45] nature to drift right back into that
[1:22:48] like all the rest of the
[1:22:51] people amen
[1:22:55] like you know if we're supposed to shun
[1:22:58] the very appearance of evil I
[1:23:02] wonder it's not hard for me to believe
[1:23:05] why God's dealing with me on my
[1:23:09] Facebook
[1:23:12] amen he said you want those ones that
[1:23:15] you pour into and that's because of
[1:23:18] these the Suzie on television and radio
[1:23:21] and all in these magazines and it's the
[1:23:23] devil put all that stuff watch this it's
[1:23:27] now he's talking about really cool stuff
[1:23:30] like to what we're in today he said it's
[1:23:32] the devil putting all that stuff around
[1:23:34] your young
[1:23:36] kids drinking beer all these Hollywood
[1:23:40] stars and the devil fills that in and de
[1:23:44] the devil's filling the insane
[1:23:47] institution and The Prostitute
[1:23:49] houses to catch kill and eat the world
[1:23:54] worldwide
[1:23:55] web here he's praying he said come out
[1:23:58] of him Satan and deliver him from the
[1:24:00] television from all the kinds of the
[1:24:03] world that's in it he said quit looking
[1:24:06] at television and quit looking at the
[1:24:08] things of the world and look to
[1:24:11] Calvary he said I got nothing against
[1:24:14] television if it's used in God's program
[1:24:18] it's all
[1:24:21] right America oh no he said said you've
[1:24:24] got a television to look at he said you
[1:24:27] got those old vulgar programs not
[1:24:31] censored on the television or radio and
[1:24:35] all this is right if they had the right
[1:24:38] thing it could mean it couldn't be the
[1:24:42] means of spreading the
[1:24:48] gospel but here he's complaining because
[1:24:50] you can't censor it and more so than
[1:24:53] ever before you can't censor the
[1:24:55] web anything that I'm connected to on
[1:24:58] the web anybody can
[1:25:03] hack and they never hack it to spread
[1:25:06] the
[1:25:09] gospel
[1:25:12] amen
[1:25:15] wow he's talking about cracking jokes
[1:25:18] and all dirty things on the radio and
[1:25:19] television even even censored and
[1:25:22] nothing else and and it's
[1:25:25] perverting Pere preventing something the
[1:25:29] gospel is it's preventing the gospel to
[1:25:31] spread in the
[1:25:33] world he said but if the devil through
[1:25:35] television and everything else can push
[1:25:37] this into our kids heads in
[1:25:41] America what ought the church ought to
[1:25:43] be able to
[1:25:44] do Under the power of the Holy
[1:25:48] Spirit without the
[1:25:50] television in their minds
[1:25:54] American people through television and
[1:25:56] through the picture shows and they've
[1:25:58] seen so much to put on till they become
[1:26:00] put on themselves he said that's too
[1:26:05] bad he said the trouble is he's landed
[1:26:08] up here the devil has landed up here in
[1:26:10] Hollywood and come through the
[1:26:12] television and he stripped off our women
[1:26:14] and done everything there was ungodly to
[1:26:16] be done and the people call it and the
[1:26:19] people call it all
[1:26:22] right well it's all right if I'm on the
[1:26:24] web and I'm
[1:26:28] careful brother if you're born again and
[1:26:31] the spirit of God will bear witness and
[1:26:33] bear record with them things that are

[1:29:49] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:29:51] and troubling if we can use the web for
[1:29:54] the glory of
[1:30:01] God but you know the Bible says that
[1:30:03] Idle Hands are the work tool of the
[1:30:05] devil so I got nothing to do it's a
[1:30:08] rainy day I think I'll go

[1:31:33] iPhone whenever you want them to
[1:31:37] lose they
[1:31:42] innocency

[1:31:48] that because see sometimes worldly
[1:31:52] people they just are not
[1:31:56] deceived they're not trying to live
[1:31:58] something that you are and so you see
[1:32:01] Christians they say wow you know we got
[1:32:03] it under
[1:32:04] control as if you can barter with the
[1:32:08] devil but worldly people just say well

[1:32:15] truth
[1:32:17] amen God help us and let's let's be like
[1:32:21] the brother amen Let's Help us think of
[1:32:25] the brother that was going to church
[1:32:27] twice on the Saturday because Satan was
[1:32:31] attacking the young
[1:32:34] kids we have this very church has
[1:32:37] multiple young kids I can't
[1:32:39] mean 13
[1:32:42] 12
[1:32:44] 9 they need
[1:32:47] God they need the power of God and what
[1:32:50] they don't need is a message on the web
[1:32:54] they don't even need that kind of a
[1:32:55] message from the web of
[1:32:59] God you know when I ministered in Ottawa
[1:33:01] and I I closing with this it's just I I
[1:33:05] you know I didn't choose to preach
[1:33:09] this and I have the
[1:33:14] web but you know you can live without
[1:33:16] the web you know there's people that
[1:33:19] attend this church that don't have the
[1:33:22] web or their internet in their house or
[1:33:25] on a single phone that him or his wife
[1:33:28] had and they they actually look quite
[1:33:33] normal they're not like mentally
[1:33:36] disfigured or physically mentally
[1:33:40] handicapped they actually walk like
[1:33:43] upright and
[1:33:48] everything amen
[1:33:54] there's things that we can't survive
[1:33:57] without amen but our our all of us we
[1:34:02] need a refilling but our kids need the
[1:34:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost oh sorry I
[1:34:07] started to say when I preached down
[1:34:08] there you know brother Brown said
[1:34:10] multiple times you know you know when
[1:34:14] Stephen was stoned it wasn't his and and
[1:34:18] Stephen was an amazing preacher but it
[1:34:21] wasn't his preaching that saved Saul
[1:34:24] it was him being
[1:34:26] stoned and when Jesus came before Pilate
[1:34:29] it wasn't his amazing preaching in the
[1:34:31] countryside that one pilate and his wife
[1:34:34] and his wife said don't have nothing to
[1:34:36] do with this man because the Bible says
[1:34:38] they were
[1:34:41] astonished and it wasn't by how much
[1:34:44] they went on the web and knew they were
[1:34:47] astonished by his
[1:34:50] silence you know it took more power for
[1:34:53] him to be
[1:34:54] silent than to speak the Bible says that
[1:34:57] he could have called 10,000 angels to
[1:35:00] destroy the world and said them
[1:35:03] free it's
[1:35:07] like and you know I I I took my
[1:35:10] references from the church and its
[1:35:12] condition and let your light shine and
[1:35:15] brother Braham said in those two
[1:35:17] messages multiple times he said God
[1:35:19] don't need you to defend him
[1:35:24] and God don't need your preaching to
[1:35:26] save the world he needs your
[1:35:30] life and I I use this example and and
[1:35:34] there was many different ones came to me
[1:35:36] after I said this message has been come
[1:35:39] like Peter defending
[1:35:41] Jesus we got a message sword and we're
[1:35:44] cutting off everybody's
[1:35:47] ear look out we're going to the message
[1:35:49] Church we're going to lose an ear
[1:35:54] and Jesus Took the very year of the man
[1:35:56] that came to kill
[1:35:58] him and put it up and
[1:36:02] went but Jesus was or but Peter was
[1:36:06] helping
[1:36:08] Jesus and you know how Jesus told Peter
[1:36:11] to help
[1:36:12] him put
[1:36:14] away your
[1:36:16] sword put away your web put away your
[1:36:20] tool of the
[1:36:21] devil I don't I don't he said and let
[1:36:24] let your light so shine he said 'I don't
[1:36:26] need advertisements we say we're on the
[1:36:28] web because we're spreading the message
[1:36:30] that's a lie our Prophet said he would
[1:36:32] never use mechanical device and he said
[1:36:34] he's not use he don't need
[1:36:37] advertisement he said he don't need your
[1:36:39] salesmanship it's the exact quote of the
[1:36:42] Prophet let you say he said he don't
[1:36:43] need my good preaching to convert
[1:36:46] you and he said about 15 times he said
[1:36:49] I'd rather you shut up and live the life
[1:36:50] instead of preach it
[1:36:54] so we can never justify the web okay oh
[1:36:57] I'm preaching on the web praise God I'm
[1:37:00] showing them the truth on the web praise
[1:37:02] God he don't even need people behind the
[1:37:05] pulpit to
[1:37:08] preach unless they got the life to back
[1:37:11] it
[1:37:12] up amen see God dealt with more people
[1:37:16] in
[1:37:18] silence than he did with noise
[1:37:24] amen you think of it silence Stone
[1:37:28] silence Stephen being Stone Jesus
[1:37:33] silence multiple people like that
[1:37:36] silence and it was a power and the
[1:37:38] people that were affected by that stone
[1:37:41] silence they couldn't get away
[1:37:44] from there was the loudest s silence
[1:37:47] you've ever
[1:37:49] heard I pray that all that'll hear it
[1:37:52] will consider just consider amen at
[1:37:56] least consider at least recognize that
