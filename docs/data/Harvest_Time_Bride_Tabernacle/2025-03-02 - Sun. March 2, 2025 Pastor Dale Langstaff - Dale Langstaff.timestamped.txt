[0:11] amen he's not too busy amen welcome
[0:14] everyone in the house of the Lord I
[0:17] think we'll just maybe uh on that song
[0:19] we'll just go to the Lord in prayer open
[0:21] over the service and we have a few
[0:24] prayer requests sister dama not feeling
[0:26] well and the boys I guess uh little Noah
[0:30] is feeling better though so we'll keep
[0:31] them in prayer we have some prayer
[0:33] requests in um in uh newfinland that
[0:36] we're praying for on Wednesday night
[0:38] keep those uh those Saints in prayer
[0:40] there and I don't believe there's
[0:42] anything else sister Patricia and
[0:45] brother Jared away for the week so just
[0:48] pray that the Lord protects him um we'll
[0:51] ask brother Carson to come take the
[0:53] knees and you have something to share as
[0:54] well brother
[1:07] pray requests we had Wednesday there
[1:08] sister's gone home from the hospital and
[1:11] the brother is still there they had
[1:13] blood clots in the bladder and they got
[1:15] to do some more
[1:16] test and do you remember a couple
[1:18] Wednesdays ago we had prayer for sister
[1:21] Donna's uh nephew's little baby and he
[1:24] said the baby had a lot of problems and
[1:27] he wanted to take the baby yeah
[1:30] well those people came to their grand
[1:33] sister Donna and asked for prayer why
[1:36] cuz they knew that she had reflection of
[1:40] the light they knew something was there
[1:42] they asked for prayer and sometimes
[1:45] people will ask you cuz they see
[1:46] something in you they know that you have
[1:49] something so they want to take the baby
[1:52] so we prayed they went back for the test
[1:55] baby's
[1:57] normal so
[2:01] we could say it's a coincidence you
[2:03] could say but I don't say that I say the
[2:05] Lord touch the baby true our prayer with
[2:08] sister Donna when they reached out to
[2:10] her cuz they called her right away and
[2:12] said that the baby is fine so we still
[2:15] have a God that's in the healing
[2:17] business that cares about us we just
[2:20] have to claim the promise but ROM said
[2:23] we have a check we could just write the
[2:26] check some people write little ones some
[2:28] people write big ones
[2:30] but we still right to check we claim and
[2:33] we we have that right so let's continue
[2:36] to left each one up or brother Jeff

[27:04] scripture you can have your seats we're
[27:06] turn to
[27:07] Esther Esther 2 we'll read 13 and 15
[27:12] then we're going to read a scripture in
[27:14] Matthew Esther
[27:16] 2 13 and
[27:23] 15 and then thus came every maid unto
[27:26] the king what so ever
[27:30] whatsoever she
[27:33] desired was given her to go in with
[27:37] her out of the house of the
[27:40] women to the King's house and now
[27:44] Esther's turn
[27:48] came and she required
[27:52] nothing
[27:55] nothing but what the King's
[27:59] Chamberlain The Keeper of the
[28:02] women had
[28:05] appointed for her perfect
[28:09] will amen let's turn to Matthew
[28:12] 24 and
[28:15] 23 Matthew 24 and 23 and then if any man
[28:19] say unto you
[28:22] Lo here is
[28:26] Christ or
[28:29] there is Christ believe
[28:33] it
[28:36] not
[28:38] Hallelujah if we drop down to verse 26
[28:42] therefore if they shall say unto
[28:44] you
[28:46] behold Christ is in the
[28:50] desert go not
[28:53] forth and behold if they say unto you
[28:55] that Christ
[28:58] is in the secret
[29:01] chamber believe
[29:04] it
[29:06] not Lord
[29:09] Jesus you're
[29:12] awesome we love you we pray that you
[29:16] will portray yourself to your bride this
[29:20] morning and a special way amen God bless
[29:25] you you may have your seats this
[29:29] morning I want to preach
[29:32] on or God wants to preach on a unique
[29:36] topic
[29:38] maybe
[29:42] Harmony
[29:45] Harmony between the
[29:47] husband and the
[29:49] wife in the
[29:52] home
[29:54] Harmony between the
[29:57] husband and the wife in the home and I
[30:01] would subtitle my
[30:03] title
[30:05] God knows
[30:10] best God knows best
[30:13] Hallelujah you know it's hard to
[30:16] understand uh omnipotent God but in this
[30:19] day we've been blessed with the prophet
[30:22] that came and revealed himself to his
[30:25] little bride and I just want to read a
[30:28] couple quotes really before I get into
[30:29] my text and and this is uh this is a
[30:33] doctrine of the church here and it's
[30:36] from our prophet and it's really really
[30:39] awesome and just you know before I
[30:41] Minister I want to say keep keep our
[30:44] visitors in prayer we went and visited
[30:47] with them Friday and I and I God
[30:50] actually showed me something uh later
[30:53] yesterday and I have a I have a short
[30:57] video on my phone of eight I believe
[31:01] it's eight TV
[31:03] evangelists that testify of the power of
[31:08] God in brother Brown's
[31:11] life the
[31:13] Vindicated
[31:15] power of God as he worked through a
[31:20] man and it's a great witnessing
[31:25] tool amen amen let's just look at what
[31:29] the prophet said in 64 Shalom he said
[31:32] the book of the year is the Bible it is
[31:35] the light of the world and it's God
[31:37] himself and our book of this year is the
[31:41] Bible in
[31:43] 1964 and our book is the Bible and all
[31:46] the other years to come the book will be
[31:49] the Bible and the years that's passed
[31:51] it'll be the Bible and it's been the
[31:53] Bible for years and it's the only book
[31:57] of eternity and it reveals God and yes
[32:01] it reveals God and every promise that is
[32:04] Vindicated in the Bible is
[32:07] eternal and the Bible is the one who
[32:10] gives us this promise when you hear the
[32:13] bible say that there's coming a day when
[32:17] Jesus will come
[32:19] again it's true amen hallelujah and in
[32:23] Abraham and this is an older quote in
[32:25] Abraham 56 he said we must go with full
[32:29] surrendered attitude and we must come to
[32:32] church and
[32:33] listen to the
[32:35] Bible and everything that's brought out
[32:38] of this Bible believe
[32:40] it and if it's not brought out of the
[32:43] Bible then it's up to you but the Bible
[32:45] is God's foundational plan it's the Plan
[32:49] of Redemption it's the plan of healing
[32:51] and everything that has come out of the
[32:54] Bible right here said woe unto him if he
[32:58] would add to or take away and I believe
[33:02] this Bible and I've been into churches
[33:05] and watch other people and lots of times
[33:07] in churches and watch how pastors act
[33:10] and he said if you'll watch a church
[33:13] friends friends and I say this not to be
[33:16] sharp in talking but I say it as a
[33:18] servant of Christ and to be honest to
[33:20] you many of times we get one another's
[33:24] Spirits instead of the Holy Spirit and
[33:27] that's the reason when you act like they
[33:30] act like you'll notice that the reason
[33:32] they act and they come to you and it's
[33:34] not and I know nothing but the Bible and
[33:38] I want you to have the spirit of the
[33:41] Bible and the spirit of Christ that's
[33:44] the reason I stay with the word of God
[33:47] and it's nothing but the Bible that'll
[33:50] bring the people out and you know we're
[33:53] living in a world where people are
[33:56] getting the spirit of the
[33:58] Evangelist the spirit of the Prophet
[34:02] hugely and the spirit of the top 10
[34:06] Pastors in North America amen amen amen
[34:10] there's lots of people that go to big
[34:12] churches because I like the spirit and
[34:14] the delivery of the man and he can be
[34:19] nothing but a Genuine s that's not the
[34:22] man's fault as long as he's not pulling
[34:24] on
[34:25] it but we're living in a Hollywood
[34:30] world that would love entertainment and
[34:33] you know some of the greatest men in the
[34:36] Bible that Jesus picked couldn't write
[34:40] their name they were
[34:43] Peter was Paul was not
[34:46] but he said I don't come to you with my
[34:48] education brother Brown was uneducated
[34:52] had his wife read the scriptures before
[34:54] he preached can you imagine inviting a
[34:56] pastor that would come here can you
[34:58] imagine if I invited somebody that you
[34:59] didn't
[35:01] know like brother Zachary was talking
[35:03] about the pastor that could not read and
[35:06] right and he asked the sister of the
[35:08] church to come up and read the thing
[35:10] half of you would walk out of here
[35:12] that's right but your Prophet did that
[35:14] right cuz it's not wrong for a sister to
[35:17] read the
[35:18] Bible
[35:20] no amen hey we look in the scripture
[35:23] here in Esther it said that when all the
[35:26] handmaidens came that the the the the
[35:28] the man that was in charge of the women
[35:31] for the
[35:32] king offered the women all the
[35:36] luxuries of leod
[35:38] deia now I want you to catch on and our
[35:40] Prophet talks about this that they were
[35:43] not living in the Stone
[35:45] Age they had paint that we don't have
[35:47] today they built the pyramids that we
[35:49] couldn't build today and they couldn't
[35:51] bomb people that they couldn't bomb so
[35:53] I'm sure they had state-of-the-art
[35:55] makeup and they probably had
[35:57] state-of-the-art high heels and they
[36:00] probably had $100,000 dresses and I mean
[36:03] if that's even possible but stuff like
[36:08] that but there was one little elect
[36:14] lady that had different
[36:18] bloodline that when she went before the
[36:21] king she never asked for
[36:25] anything but what the Bible
[36:29] gave
[36:30] her and the revelation of the
[36:33] Bible the proper revelation of the Bible
[36:37] amen let's look at just a couple things
[36:40] and we're going to go into some examples
[36:42] so so you see that this this whole move
[36:45] of God sometimes it it sometimes it's
[36:47] hard for us to understand God I want to
[36:49] show you about six examples in the Bible
[36:51] where people never understood God's
[36:54] decision but God's will was perfect it
[36:56] was Harmony
[36:58] with the husband and the wife in the
[37:01] home of the world Amen here in brother
[37:04] Brown says and the spirit of God is not
[37:07] something that can you be schooled into
[37:11] you so if you think you can learn it by
[37:14] going to cemetery school or sitting
[37:17] under a big oak tree that's not
[37:20] possible it's not possible not even a
[37:23] smart Minister it's not something that
[37:26] it's or sorry it's something that's
[37:28] predestinated To You by The Almighty
[37:31] hand of God it's your experience you
[37:35] cannot he repeats this be schooled or
[37:37] taught it into you it's predestinated by
[37:40] God's forn
[37:42] knowledge into you you either just are
[37:46] or you aren't that's in the Satan's Eden
[37:49] 658 here's another one in the Rapture
[37:52] message also 65 the month that the
[37:54] prophet died he said now but the church
[37:57] the
[37:59] when they go in the Rapture it's a
[38:03] revelation to
[38:06] her when you're sitting here this
[38:08] morning and we talk about the bride it
[38:10] has to be a revelation revealed to you
[38:15] and it won't be a minister that gives
[38:17] that to you because if a minister could
[38:19] another Minister could take it away from
[38:20] you see if a man can give it to you then
[38:23] a better man could take it away that's
[38:25] right but when God spoke to Moses at the
[38:28] burning bus it didn't matter who came by
[38:30] to that church there ain't nobody going
[38:33] to take away the presence of that
[38:36] fire that was right in his midst you
[38:38] Cann undo something that God
[38:42] does he said it's revealed to her and
[38:45] that's the Revelation the true bride of
[38:48] Christ will be a
[38:50] revelation and waiting for the
[38:52] revelation of the Rapture he said and
[38:54] Revelation is fa and he said it was like
[38:56] Abraham that it was contrary to
[38:59] everything he
[39:01] believed but it was
[39:04] real it was impossible for old people to
[39:08] have a
[39:09] baby but it was not
[39:11] impossible amen hallelujah and Christ is
[39:15] built upon the
[39:17] revelation of the whole entire body
[39:21] amen
[39:23] hallelujah let's just we're just just
[39:25] lay a just a short Foundation here just
[39:28] back in our scripture we read in Matthew
[39:30] 24 and we just want to I always want to
[39:33] read a couple extra scriptures there
[39:35] reread the ones we read in the text but
[39:36] 23 and he said If any man shall say unto
[39:40] you Lo is Christ here or there believe
[39:44] it not and there shall arise false
[39:46] christs and false prophets and to show
[39:48] many signs and wonders in so much that
[39:52] if it were possible they shall receive
[39:54] the deceive the very elect
[39:57] Hallelujah God help
[39:59] us and therefore now let me just talk
[40:03] about these
[40:04] fault you know brother Brown talked
[40:06] about multiple things he even talked
[40:08] about the states being fault because
[40:10] they would have Dynamic atomic bombs and
[40:13] power and and delight and stuff but
[40:16] people are attracted to big
[40:21] things and fancy things like if a bomb
[40:24] went off and there was a bright
[40:25] light everyone of us would look that's
[40:29] right cuz it was a
[40:31] flash yeah that's why they call it on
[40:33] the 401 we have a gaer Slowdown in what
[40:36] kind of a world that you got seven lanes
[40:39] and there's somebody pulled on their
[40:40] shoulder changing a tire does everybody
[40:43] got to investigate it that's right
[40:47] that's
[40:50] right
[40:52] amen therefore in verse 26 therefore if
[40:55] you shall say unto them below behold
[40:58] Christ is in the desert go not forth and
[41:01] behold he's in the secret chamber
[41:03] believe it not and for the lightning
[41:06] uhoh I remember I said bright light for
[41:09] as the lightning cometh out of the East
[41:11] and shineth even to the West so shall
[41:13] the coming of the son of man be for
[41:18] wheresoever the food is the
[41:21] carcass it won't matter what kind of a
[41:24] scenario it's around the food
[41:28] the Eagles will be gathered
[41:30] Hallelujah the Eagles will be gathered
[41:32] now this is a direct quote to verse
[41:35] 23 for if they say Christ is over here
[41:39] and brother raham says this and and God
[41:42] keeps his word he said you know when the
[41:43] heaven opens up the Bible says it this
[41:46] way he said you know when when the Devil
[41:48] comes in like a flood God will raise up
[41:49] a standard against them brother Brown
[41:52] says it this way he said you know when
[41:53] the heaven opens up hell opens up also
[42:00] it's a competition to Satan it's real to
[42:04] God but the Satan it's a competition cuz
[42:06] see he's trying to imitate Christ and so
[42:10] everything Christ does Satan
[42:13] imitates and he's perfecting it to
[42:16] almost Perfection that's why it
[42:18] almost but it's not possible could
[42:21] deceive the elect that's and when the
[42:23] Bible says in the last day he's in the
[42:25] desert Lo he said believe it not for all
[42:28] these signs for he's there all these
[42:31] signs and
[42:32] wonders amen God help us believe it
[42:38] not because we know God is a
[42:42] spirit and many of the times you know
[42:45] when when Jesus himself came and the Son
[42:47] of God and Jesus was
[42:49] born the the church World knew it
[42:53] couldn't be the Son of
[42:54] God because he never came to the their
[42:58] church he never came through their
[43:00] pastor and a
[43:02] barn I mean not even a nice Barn I mean
[43:05] that you could have went to at least a
[43:07] fancy
[43:09] place God help us you know Matthew 12
[43:12] and and and and we're going on we're
[43:14] just right ready to start our examples
[43:16] here but Matthew 12 12 3 38 and 39 it
[43:21] says and the certain scribes and
[43:22] Pharisees answered and said Master we
[43:24] would see a sign of you now I already
[43:27] have a message in my iPad to preach on
[43:29] this and I've had it for about a month
[43:31] and I'm actually if God will let me I'm
[43:33] going to try to save it for Easter but
[43:35] it's not you know we believe in all the
[43:37] signs and wonders in the Bible we
[43:39] believe in all the nine spiritual gifts
[43:41] we believe in the five-fold ministry
[43:43] which are gifts to the church and the
[43:44] body and there's not anything that God
[43:47] put in the word we're not taking it out
[43:48] of the
[43:49] word that's right nothing and I mean if
[43:53] anybody spoke in tongues and prophecy
[43:55] came forth I would be the happiest man
[43:57] here if you started running the aisles
[43:59] and walking on the back of pews I'd be
[44:00] the happiest man here am that normally
[44:03] pray happens with a lot of prayer and
[44:06] fasting amen
[44:08] normally
[44:10] uh God you know what what you do in
[44:12] secret God rewards you openly amen amen
[44:16] but we watch this so so we're not
[44:18] preaching against signs and wonders but
[44:20] here the the Pharisees were looking for
[44:23] Pacific thing and Jes and and so I'm not
[44:27] but Jesus answered and said unto them an
[44:29] evil and an adulterous generation seeks
[44:33] after a signs and there shall be no sign
[44:35] given to them but the prophet Jonas now
[44:38] I'm going to preach on that someday and
[44:40] it it's really wonderful beautiful but I
[44:43] want to show you the proper way of
[44:46] science you know a sheep don't think
[44:48] about growing wood
[44:50] wool and you in the
[44:53] flesh if you're praying or fasting or
[44:56] just waking up in the morning morning
[44:57] and it's a normal day you don't think
[44:59] about going to the kitchen table when
[45:01] you hear your wife or your mother
[45:03] cooking fresh baked uh raisin brand
[45:07] cookies and the aroma was going through
[45:10] the house you don't have to ring the
[45:11] doorbell you don't have to you know
[45:13] there was a thing that you know that
[45:15] back in the old days in the farms you
[45:16] used to ring the dinner bell you don't
[45:18] have to ring your dinner bell when
[45:19] you're baking fresh bad in the oven and
[45:21] it's rolling out the aroma in the yard
[45:24] the kids will come in like flies
[45:28] did you have to tell them to eat no you
[45:31] know there was a joke in the the old
[45:33] back of things when people had large
[45:35] large families they said how did you
[45:37] know everybody showed up to the table
[45:38] they said if something didn't show up we
[45:40] were glad might not be enough food to go
[45:43] around we just when the table was full
[45:44] we put the food out when it was done we
[45:47] it was gone somebody missed it well they
[45:50] wouldn't miss the next
[45:52] meal but the proper way so a sheep don't
[45:55] think I don't he don't wa up the morning
[45:57] say oh I'm going to grow Woolf if you're
[45:59] a
[46:00] Believer you'll have
[46:03] signs brother Carson just mentioned
[46:05] about that sister Donna told me about it
[46:07] yesterday you know this baby not only
[46:09] did that baby you know why they wanted
[46:10] to abort the baby the baby had fluid in
[46:12] his brain and it never had the drain
[46:14] holes to release the fluid in it
[46:17] sky and the parents said absolutely not
[46:19] under no condition God bless those
[46:21] parents under no condition would
[46:23] we we don't care what you tell us doctor
[46:26] we we care more what God tells us we're
[46:28] not aborting the baby they come back the
[46:29] baby said oh you know you know what the
[46:31] doctor said Not only was the fluid gone
[46:32] but they said the proper holes are
[46:34] there amen those are just amen now if
[46:38] that was your baby you would really know
[46:40] that there was a real God in Elijah
[46:43] that's right amen you and and you there
[46:45] would be a real God in Israel I mean
[46:47] sorry that's right amen you would know
[46:49] that that's right but if it's not your
[46:52] baby you might say well but signs follow
[46:56] a full believer but you know this this
[46:59] scripture is not talking about that
[47:01] there won't be signs in our mix but it's
[47:03] talking about a greater
[47:05] sign and and and I I I'm just going to
[47:08] tell you what it is and then I won't
[47:10] have to maybe preach that message but
[47:12] the greatest sign you can possibly have
[47:13] is the revelation of the Resurrection
[47:15] The Rapture that's the greatest sign of
[47:17] all cuz I can be healed 700 times and
[47:20] still get sick tomorrow but when I have
[47:22] a revelation of the Resurrection if this
[47:24] body dies and goes to the Grave or if
[47:27] I'm blessed enough to go in a Rapture
[47:30] and I have the Revelation that no matter
[47:31] how the Rapture happens this brother's
[47:33] going to be there all right and if I'm
[47:35] in the grave I'm still going to be there
[47:37] cuz there will rise first there ain't no
[47:40] sign and wonder that you can have better
[47:43] than the revelation of the resurrection
[47:44] and the Rapture you can take all of
[47:47] those nine spiritual gifts but we like
[47:49] them but if I choose that's the
[47:52] Revelation I want you know I don't need
[47:55] life insurance because I got a
[47:57] Assurance I got assurance that he'll
[47:59] raise me up at the end times amen my
[48:02] money won't do that so we look in here
[48:04] in First Corinthians let's go into our
[48:05] thing you know here the messenger the
[48:08] greatest messenger in the Bible and and
[48:11] and I say this with confidence because
[48:13] Paul brought Grace I mean who wants to
[48:17] live under the law woo buddy no
[48:22] thanks the greatest messenger in the
[48:25] Bible because he brought the message of
[48:26] Grace and wrote most of the New
[48:29] Testament God never answered his
[48:33] prayer
[48:35] so he wasn't a
[48:40] Believer well he never had signs in his
[48:43] own personal life he never had his own
[48:45] testimony he had to tell other people's
[48:49] testimonies come on help me out now
[48:51] don't go quiet on
[48:53] me and he went to Jesus three times
[48:58] and said take this in front of and he
[48:59] said let's
[49:01] just start at verse 7 now I I well here
[49:05] let's just read what I got verse one and
[49:08] it is not expedient for me doubtless to
[49:11] glory for I have come with visions and
[49:13] Revelations of the Lord verse 5 for such
[49:16] a one will I Glory yet of myself but I
[49:20] will not
[49:21] Glory but in thy infirmities verse six
[49:26] for though I would desire to Glory I
[49:28] shall not be a
[49:32] fo for I sayth the
[49:35] truth but I now I far forbear lest any
[49:40] man should think of me above above don't
[49:44] think of your pastor or the prophet
[49:47] above what you're supposed
[49:49] to Paul saying don't think of me above
[49:52] that which he seeth me to be or that he
[49:56] Heth me to be for lest I shall be
[49:59] exalted above measure through the
[50:01] abundance of Revelation there was given
[50:03] to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger
[50:09] of Satan to Buffet
[50:11] me
[50:14] why why in the world would God give the
[50:17] greatest
[50:18] Minister a
[50:22] problem lest I should be exalted
[50:27] uhoh that's right above the measure that
[50:30] God wanted me to be exalted
[50:33] above uhoh people would start worshiping
[50:36] me and I'd start walking like the kids
[50:38] in high school with a
[50:40] sway look at
[50:43] me verse eight and for this thing I
[50:46] beseech the Lord three times Thrice that
[50:50] it might depart from me and he said unto
[50:53] me my grace is sufficient for thee see
[50:57] for my strength is made perfect in
[50:59] weakness most gladly therefore I will
[51:02] rather glory in my infirmities then the
[51:05] power of Christ May rest upon me
[51:09] therefore I take
[51:11] pleasure now this is this is crazy
[51:15] because God never answered my
[51:18] prayer
[51:20] whoa wait a
[51:25] minute yeah in the
[51:28] reproaches and in the necessities and in
[51:31] the persecution and in the distress for
[51:34] Christ's sake for when I am weak then I
[51:38] am strong in Christ amen wow amen so
[51:42] here the greatest messenger in the
[51:45] Bible went I mean he really delivered
[51:50] the word of God yes wow read Romans
[51:53] Ephesians and all these other books that
[51:56] he
[51:57] wrote and he went to Jesus and he said
[52:00] God you know you're doing all these
[52:01] amazing things in my life oh the great
[52:03] greatest thing he did to Paul was would
[52:06] give him the revelation of not stop
[52:08] killing himself Christians and and
[52:10] become a real believer himself and and
[52:13] God give them all this enormous can you
[52:16] imagine the enormous
[52:18] Revelation in that day coming right out
[52:21] of law I wasn't an easy Road
[52:27] and God
[52:29] said he never even heard an answer from
[52:31] God three
[52:35] times
[52:37] why you know because in the harmony of
[52:40] the husband and wife in the home the
[52:44] wife just has the husband if he has the
[52:48] in this case of being God you know he
[52:51] was the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[52:53] and the end and he knows what's best for
[52:56] the wife
[52:57] that's
[52:59] right he knows what's best for the wife
[53:01] he knows what's best for the
[53:03] family and so if God was out shopping
[53:07] and buying a car you know he might buy a
[53:09] really puddle jumper because he might
[53:12] know that was best for the
[53:14] family amen amen and so this is amazing
[53:19] you know we go to First Timothy
[53:23] 5 and here's Paul's discip that come up
[53:27] underneath of him
[53:30] Timothy and
[53:33] uh I want to start reading about let me
[53:37] see
[53:43] 21 I charge thee before God and before
[53:46] the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect of
[53:48] angels that thou shall observe these
[53:50] things without preferring one
[53:52] another doing nothing by but
[53:56] particularity that was respects to
[53:59] persons now now this is the man talking
[54:03] that had the greatest Revelation
[54:08] period so he said if you're two years
[54:10] old or you're me we're equal in
[54:14] Christ he said now this goes along with
[54:17] her you know verse 22 he said lay hands
[54:19] suddenly on no man neither be partakers
[54:23] of other men's sin and keep thyself pure
[54:26] now what this scripture means I got a
[54:27] quotee for it but if
[54:31] you rebuke something that God gave to a
[54:35] man you could be out of the will of
[54:38] God Amen if God gave somebody
[54:43] something for their perfecting yeah and
[54:47] you rebuked it yeah you were actually
[54:51] fighting God
[54:54] yeah like you want an example Moses when
[54:56] he struck the rock
[54:58] twice God only obeyed Moses because he
[55:02] was his mad but he judged Moses yes he
[55:06] judged Moses and said you will not see
[55:08] the promised
[55:10] land amen so lay hands quickly on nobody
[55:14] and drink no longer
[55:16] water this is Paul's advice to
[55:21] Timothy but use a little wine for your
[55:25] stomach because Our God ain't got enough
[55:29] power no he did have enough power to
[55:32] heal Timothy's
[55:34] stomach but it was not God's
[55:37] choice to heal Timothy's
[55:43] stomach
[55:45] yeah so see as the bride of Christ as
[55:48] the wife of we have to be careful we
[55:51] don't fight our husband that's right I'm
[55:55] bitter because you let me go through
[55:57] that God I'm bitter cuz you turned those
[55:59] people against me God I'm bitter because
[56:02] you did you gave me trials in that of a
[56:05] son to prove that I was a son that made
[56:07] me bitter God and you become bitter
[56:11] against God here's the two greatest
[56:14] anointed men of the
[56:16] day Paul and Timothy his disciple that
[56:20] came up as a young
[56:22] man and them United in prayer together
[56:27] could not get God to swing his
[56:32] decision to heal stomach
[56:37] ERS does brother Dale no I don't no
[56:40] don't ask me if I understand that no you
[56:42] got to take that straight to
[56:44] God but God allowed it in Paul's case
[56:48] because he knew Paul would get
[56:51] boastful and Rise himself up and that's
[56:55] what's happening in our day with the
[56:56] prophet people say well look at our
[56:59] Prophet he's a
[57:00] Superman no the man that was in him was
[57:04] the
[57:06] Superman brother baham said that the man
[57:08] that was in the man that's in you is the
[57:10] Superman he's called the Holy
[57:13] Ghost this man is Badger skin and I
[57:18] don't want you to see the hinder side of
[57:19] my Badger skin God don't even want you
[57:22] to see it but the man inside here now
[57:24] that's a whole different ball game I'll
[57:26] show you him front
[57:28] page watch here now we bring it up today
[57:30] you know brother Brown had a prayer
[57:31] request from a baby that had died in
[57:34] Germany and they came to but now now now
[57:37] brother braham's gift was the gift of
[57:39] healing and it was Vindicated and and
[57:42] came with a message and there's no signs
[57:45] I mean tremendous you know I mentioned
[57:48] that video you know on all these TV
[57:50] evangelist there's that many there the
[57:52] greatest move of God since Jesus Christ
[57:56] well even even including Jesus Christ
[58:00] was through the prophet brother Brown on
[58:02] this
[58:05] Earth amen that that's just that's just
[58:10] facts that don't mean we worship Him
[58:14] greatest move of God can be happening in
[58:15] your life this morning amen amen that's
[58:19] right God has a many member bride so
[58:21] here they came to brother Bram and
[58:22] brother Bram he knew the scriptures
[58:26] brother Brown knew that if God if he
[58:29] went to God and said heal that baby God
[58:32] would have healed that
[58:33] baby because he had been given the
[58:35] commission to heal the sick and raise
[58:38] the Dead period that's right and it was
[58:41] drawing attention to the the the message
[58:43] of Jesus
[58:45] Christ brother Bram understood
[58:49] perfectly but he was in harmony with his
[58:52] husband he said oh wait a minute wait a
[58:54] minute wait a minute
[58:56] I'm in favor you know they told they had
[58:58] the airplane ready he didn't have to buy
[59:00] a plane ticket God had supplied the
[59:03] means the funds I mean the engine was
[59:08] revving and brother B said I have to ask
[59:11] my husband yeah wow that's a really wise
[59:15] choice to do I have to ask my
[59:18] husband that's
[59:20] right and he went to
[59:23] God and God came back and he said that's
[59:25] my will that that baby's dead that's
[59:28] right don't touch it and brother Brown
[59:32] because of watch this because of
[59:37] maturity and understanding the word of
[59:40] God he called them up and he said bury
[59:43] your
[59:49] baby I'll tell you
[59:51] what brother brandham didn't like making
[59:53] that phone call no there's not one of us
[59:56] here would have because we have feelings
[1:00:01] we have we have
[1:00:05] affection I mean if you don't have
[1:00:07] affection I don't want to be very close
[1:00:08] to you if or feelings of any
[1:00:11] kind that's why we do kind things to one
[1:00:17] another and brother Brown had that very
[1:00:20] much so brother Brown said multiple
[1:00:22] times he said I'd heal every one of you
[1:00:24] here right now before before even but I
[1:00:27] can't do
[1:00:33] that he said bury your baby he said
[1:00:36] don't put your hand on that and don't
[1:00:38] rebuke that this what God let me just
[1:00:40] read this uh he prayed the next morning
[1:00:44] he started to the room and he said just
[1:00:46] look there and he said I stood and there
[1:00:48] was a light hanging in the door it was
[1:00:52] God and he said don't put your hand on
[1:00:55] that and don't rebuke that that's the
[1:00:58] hand of God and brother bam gives the
[1:01:01] example of 1 Timothy 5:22 lay no hand
[1:01:05] suddenly on no
[1:01:08] man God might be teaching
[1:01:11] them right the lesson of the rod and the
[1:01:15] strap
[1:01:17] yeah
[1:01:19] amen you know there's another example in
[1:01:21] 2 Kings 21-18 and I'm not going to read
[1:01:24] that all but that's just the story
[1:01:26] in 2 Kings 20 1:18 and it was King
[1:01:30] Hezekiah and he got sick unto death and
[1:01:32] the prophet Isaiah came to him now I'm
[1:01:34] just paraphrasing it's that's where you
[1:01:36] can find it and he said get your house
[1:01:38] in order you're going to
[1:01:42] die and God you know they say preach a
[1:01:46] message can God ever change his mind and
[1:01:48] the King went to God and he said you
[1:01:50] know God I've done everything you told
[1:01:51] me to do he was a he was a Believer he
[1:01:55] was a message believer
[1:01:56] he had tore down
[1:01:58] Idols he brought the sacrifice back in
[1:02:03] Israel he had done fantastic
[1:02:07] things and he said God I can't get my
[1:02:09] house in order that
[1:02:11] quick and
[1:02:13] God why are you doing this to me
[1:02:17] cuz let's make it personal say God you
[1:02:20] know what's going to happen to the
[1:02:23] church right or what what's going to
[1:02:26] happen to my family God he was asking
[1:02:29] God all he said God did I do something
[1:02:30] wrong do do is there a hidden sin in my
[1:02:32] life is there something I didn't repent
[1:02:35] for God haven't I done this and that
[1:02:39] wasn't that your will
[1:02:42] God and he touched the string of God's
[1:02:46] heart and God turned the prophet
[1:02:50] around and he sent him back and he said
[1:02:52] I'll give you 15
[1:02:54] years and watch what the prophet said
[1:02:56] about that during that time King
[1:02:59] Hezekiah backslid and he would have been
[1:03:02] better off if he would have went when
[1:03:04] God had commanded
[1:03:06] it than getting the permissive will of
[1:03:09] God and having 15 more years and God
[1:03:11] this is you know some things happen that
[1:03:14] you oh man I I I kind of didn't like
[1:03:17] this part there's sometimes you Minister
[1:03:20] things you don't
[1:03:21] like and God could have laid the sin on
[1:03:25] the king's thing but he waited till he
[1:03:28] died a backsliding Christian and he put
[1:03:31] all the dues on his
[1:03:36] kids
[1:03:39] wow and he said but he stayed a little
[1:03:42] while and you see he held off the he
[1:03:45] held off the the what's the word for the
[1:03:48] sin he he held off the punishment for
[1:03:50] his
[1:03:51] sin until he was gone and he gave it to
[1:03:54] his children
[1:03:58] wow you know death or God's plan is not
[1:04:01] a bad thing I mean of course it's easy
[1:04:04] for us to say we know God's plan is not
[1:04:06] a bad thing but in this case death would
[1:04:08] have been a blessing his Kings his sons
[1:04:10] would have went right on reign in the
[1:04:12] thing he lost his whole Kingdom the
[1:04:13] whole church the whole
[1:04:16] everything went into
[1:04:18] slavery because he thought he was the
[1:04:21] only
[1:04:22] one that could be the pastor
[1:04:28] well he told God like what's going to
[1:04:30] happen they're going to bring Idols back
[1:04:33] in here and they're going to they're
[1:04:34] going to take the sacrifice down
[1:04:39] and
[1:04:41] amen that's what your Prophet said in 63
[1:04:44] God doesn't call a man without to
[1:04:47] judgment without first warning
[1:04:49] him yes God gave the king his desire
[1:04:55] at the punishment
[1:04:57] of his family and him being
[1:05:02] backslid wow you know we see another
[1:05:05] example here where Jesus went to the
[1:05:07] pool and in John 5:3 it says and there
[1:05:11] laid a great
[1:05:14] multitude John
[1:05:16] 53 and there laid a great multitude of
[1:05:20] in imported like sick people imported
[1:05:25] folks now I'm just naive enough to
[1:05:28] believe that there was a lot of sick
[1:05:29] people great I mean we don't know the
[1:05:32] number but that's a lot more than a
[1:05:35] handful withered and waiting for the
[1:05:39] moving of the spirit of God the water
[1:05:43] which was the spirit of God the spirit
[1:05:45] of God came down and moved the water and
[1:05:47] one would be healed and Jesus walked in
[1:05:49] I I mentioned this before probably
[1:05:51] because this anointing was coming down
[1:05:53] on this and Jesus stepped over the sick
[1:05:56] people yeah and walked over to one man
[1:05:59] so he stepped over me my family and
[1:06:04] maybe even our church and he went over
[1:06:06] here and he went over
[1:06:09] there and he walked over to different
[1:06:11] church or different
[1:06:15] Ministry and I was sitting there and I
[1:06:17] was really withered but I was getting my
[1:06:19] hand ready I wanted to trip
[1:06:23] them I mean this actually
[1:06:26] happen
[1:06:27] yes he had the opportunity to come and
[1:06:29] speak for me but he went and spoke for
[1:06:31] somebody
[1:06:33] else something was
[1:06:36] like never came preach in our
[1:06:39] church never came to our
[1:06:43] pool they never invited
[1:06:47] me never healed my
[1:06:50] child Spirits don't die every one of
[1:06:53] those people had those spirits
[1:06:56] and Jesus healed
[1:06:59] one now you know you know the the
[1:07:02] prophet said this you know he said when
[1:07:03] when uh John's friend died there in the
[1:07:06] grave uh who was that uh was in the
[1:07:09] grave and Jesus called him forth brother
[1:07:11] Brown said you know if he hadn't called
[1:07:12] his name that's right every resurrected
[1:07:17] Christian would have came forth would
[1:07:19] have been the general Resurrection right
[1:07:20] then
[1:07:23] yes it would it wouldn't have been 1 o
[1:07:26] more effort for Jesus to heal all those
[1:07:28] laying around that pool than to heal
[1:07:32] one I just got a simple question for you
[1:07:35] how could that have been God's
[1:07:42] will don't ask
[1:07:46] me harmony harmony with your
[1:07:51] husband
[1:07:53] Harmony I praise God in the in the flesh
[1:07:56] you know can I give you a a light thing
[1:07:58] I praise God In the Flesh I wasn't born
[1:08:00] a lady I oh man you know I think of my
[1:08:04] wife and all the stupid decisions oh
[1:08:06] when I bought the fourth thing in a row
[1:08:08] and had 15 payment I say oh god oh she's
[1:08:14] probably thinking oh I wish I wasn't
[1:08:16] tied to the
[1:08:18] law
[1:08:21] harmony
[1:08:22] harmony with your spiritual husband
[1:08:26] you know if we were honest to ourself
[1:08:28] and if God answered every single prayer
[1:08:31] in a miracle now healing is different
[1:08:33] cuz it can be a process yes Noah was
[1:08:36] healed this
[1:08:38] week I mean he had a wild temperature
[1:08:41] 1004 something he was he was matter of
[1:08:44] fact I I
[1:08:47] like no would have died if he hadn't got
[1:08:50] better yeah when D text the land and
[1:08:54] said no and Jeff we feeling better I
[1:08:55] actually started
[1:08:57] crying and that boy was I mean he he was
[1:09:00] going the wrong way
[1:09:02] fast that was a
[1:09:04] healing but if everybody that walked up
[1:09:06] to here in
[1:09:08] America was like
[1:09:12] that there's not a human alive that that
[1:09:15] wouldn't
[1:09:16] affect that's why Jesus gave but Paul an
[1:09:22] infirmity because
[1:09:26] well just
[1:09:28] because cuz God knew he couldn't take it
[1:09:31] and stay humble and so is it was if
[1:09:34] you're breathing this morning if if you
[1:09:37] make your and if everything falls at
[1:09:40] your command just it's done it's
[1:09:43] done can you imag you'll turn out like
[1:09:46] that Kim guy in the North Korea crazy
[1:09:51] guy huh
[1:09:56] amen God help us see God knows best
[1:10:00] what's best for us here in Isa Isaiah
[1:10:02] 5589 he says for my thoughts are not
[1:10:06] your
[1:10:07] thoughts neither are my our
[1:10:11] ways your ways my ways sayeth the Lord
[1:10:15] Isaiah
[1:10:16] 55:9 for as the heaven is higher than
[1:10:19] the earth so are my ways so much higher
[1:10:24] than brother Dale's
[1:10:26] way and my thoughts so much
[1:10:29] higher than your
[1:10:34] thoughts Psalms 103 same
[1:10:38] scripture Psalms
[1:10:40] 10311 for as the heaven is high above
[1:10:43] the
[1:10:45] Earth so great is the mystery Mercy
[1:10:50] sorry towards
[1:10:52] them that have Harmony
[1:10:55] with her husband fear is
[1:10:58] respect respect amen you know if we
[1:11:01] would have been back in the day like and
[1:11:04] all the people that were and I mean if
[1:11:07] you would have been back in the day of
[1:11:08] brother bram's
[1:11:09] Ministry there wasn't one person alive
[1:11:13] in the message in that was glad that
[1:11:16] brother brandham had a car
[1:11:19] accident I'm not I wasn't either I'm
[1:11:21] just saying
[1:11:30] but God was he said precious are the
[1:11:32] deaths of the Saints in my eyes and all
[1:11:35] the saints were like God you made a
[1:11:37] mistake that's my man that's my prophet
[1:11:40] he yeah I mean how he revealed the seals
[1:11:42] to me which the seals are Christ
[1:11:44] actually the brother bam said that
[1:11:46] Christ revealed the seals which was
[1:11:48] himself he used brother Brown's mouth
[1:11:51] that's right he revealed all the
[1:11:52] Mysteries like Amos 3:7 amen brother
[1:11:56] Brown did well no brother God did
[1:11:58] through brother Brown's mouth he
[1:12:00] revealed The Mystery of the white horse
[1:12:02] rider and water baptism and no Eternal
[1:12:05] Howell and and you have you always were
[1:12:08] Eternal praise God for that one
[1:12:10] predestination woo
[1:12:14] amen amen and there wasn't one person
[1:12:16] that said God you made the right
[1:12:18] decision taking them off the scen no
[1:12:20] that's right cuz they went in total
[1:12:23] complete
[1:12:26] chaos it was like w what did you just do
[1:12:30] God yeah let's vote on
[1:12:41] it wow once more just once more the
[1:12:45] prophet said in 63 he said when you
[1:12:47] think your thoughts then God's thoughts
[1:12:50] don't have a
[1:12:53] chance uhoh
[1:12:55] wow if it's brother Dale that I'm
[1:12:59] ministering run for your life you're in
[1:13:01] the wrong
[1:13:04] Church you
[1:13:06] are but that's only a revelation that
[1:13:09] God can give you whether it's brother
[1:13:11] Dale's thoughts or if it's the holy
[1:13:13] spirit's thoughts if brother Dale from
[1:13:15] education put this together in the skill
[1:13:18] of being a professor put all these lined
[1:13:22] up and it was just perfect
[1:13:25] I'd be
[1:13:26] nervous but if you had a person
[1:13:29] that didn't have a clue what end was
[1:13:31] right and left and God just
[1:13:35] went and line them all
[1:13:37] up
[1:13:39] right maybe you might want
[1:13:42] to brother Bram said that and one just
[1:13:44] once more it's also a 6312 quote and
[1:13:48] queen of the Sheba
[1:13:52] 61 he said his ways are all always
[1:13:55] higher in our ways and so we must submit
[1:13:59] ourselves to his ways amen he he's
[1:14:05] infinite he's in you know just so much
[1:14:08] above our thoughts and so you know it's
[1:14:11] just good that we we understand that we
[1:14:14] need to be for us to have a revelation
[1:14:16] we got to be in harmony with our
[1:14:19] husband Christ Christ that that's it you
[1:14:23] know the prophet said this
[1:14:25] in the perous church age he said you
[1:14:28] know uh he compared John 5:19 where
[1:14:32] Jesus said I do nothing until the father
[1:14:34] show me and he said now I'm I'm starting
[1:14:37] right there he said now this harmony now
[1:14:40] exists between the
[1:14:42] groom and the
[1:14:44] bride and he shows her his word of
[1:14:49] life and she receives it and she never
[1:14:53] doubts it therefore there's nothing can
[1:14:56] harm her not even death that means if
[1:15:01] I'm dead before next Sunday you just
[1:15:02] carry on don't definitely don't cry for
[1:15:05] me I won't have to fix the furnace I
[1:15:09] mean I'll be like
[1:15:11] woo here's the secret of this the word
[1:15:16] is in the bride as it was in Mary and
[1:15:19] the bride has the mind of Christ and she
[1:15:22] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:15:24] and performs that commandment of the
[1:15:28] word in his
[1:15:30] name and she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:15:35] when the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:15:37] and it comes to pass and now these in
[1:15:40] the bride do only his will and no
[1:15:45] one can take them to do
[1:15:51] otherwise I can't tempt you or persuade
[1:15:55] you or bribe you or pay you or nothing
[1:15:59] to leave the word of
[1:16:01] Christ
[1:16:03] regardless Hallelujah and they have thus
[1:16:06] saith the Lord or they
[1:16:08] keep still and they know that it has to
[1:16:12] be God in them doing the works
[1:16:15] fulfilling his own word and he did
[1:16:20] not complete all his work while he was
[1:16:23] here in his Earth
[1:16:26] Ministry brother Brown saying Jesus did
[1:16:29] not fulfill the prophecy of the Bible in
[1:16:33] his own life when he was on Earth and he
[1:16:36] is continuing that
[1:16:40] today in
[1:16:42] you in
[1:16:45] you wow what a privilege we have to
[1:16:49] fulfill the word of God but in that
[1:16:52] privilege see Jesus never qu
[1:16:56] question the father I mean I know they
[1:16:59] were one but he he look at the harmony
[1:17:03] brother Braham said it was the harmony
[1:17:05] of John
[1:17:07] 5:19 I not doing
[1:17:10] nothing but what my father is that's
[1:17:13] right I ain't doing nothing to what my
[1:17:15] husband
[1:17:17] isn't now I understand my husband really
[1:17:19] well I don't need to understand him by
[1:17:21] education and lining up all the quotes I
[1:17:23] just I've met him in
[1:17:26] person amen
[1:17:30] amen hallelujah you know when you look
[1:17:33] at and just in closing here just my last
[1:17:35] scripture just and I I I just got a few
[1:17:37] things after this but I want to ask you
[1:17:39] a question but you know my last here you
[1:17:42] know when we look at the Father's prayer
[1:17:44] when the disciples came to him and said
[1:17:46] teach us how to pray you know when you
[1:17:48] look at the Lord's Prayer the beginning
[1:17:49] of the Lord's Prayer is worship
[1:17:56] yes and then it's accepting his
[1:18:02] Harmony that's how we're to
[1:18:04] pray
[1:18:06] say our father that's
[1:18:10] relationship Hallowed be thy
[1:18:14] name that's
[1:18:17] worship now it's your
[1:18:21] kingdom and it's your will
[1:18:25] in my
[1:18:27] life it's
[1:18:29] Harmony
[1:18:32] obedience to the
[1:18:34] husband right and if there's not Harmony
[1:18:38] this is the thing if there's not
[1:18:41] Harmony then there's
[1:18:52] bitterness period the thing that comes
[1:18:56] right
[1:18:56] after the decision of I'm not going to
[1:18:59] be in harmony is I'm bitter to the
[1:19:02] decision you made that's
[1:19:05] right that's the very next thing and
[1:19:09] they're that far
[1:19:10] apart oh
[1:19:13] yes I didn't like that God I didn't like
[1:19:17] that at
[1:19:22] all wow in closing I have a question for
[1:19:27] you and I have no opinion of how you
[1:19:30] will answer
[1:19:31] it won't affect me at all it's not this
[1:19:35] is a question for yourself so I'm not
[1:19:38] trying to cram this down your
[1:19:40] throat please don't feel that way I'm
[1:19:42] going to show you some things that the
[1:19:44] prophet
[1:19:46] said but I have a question for
[1:19:49] you did the or our God
[1:19:55] you know cuz this question could be to
[1:19:57] non-believer did the god or our God the
[1:20:02] Alpha and
[1:20:04] Omega now remember this is a
[1:20:08] question this is only a question I'm
[1:20:10] going to lose you I know I'm I'm I'm
[1:20:12] going right out the limb is too small
[1:20:15] for my
[1:20:17] weight that the Alpha and Omega the
[1:20:19] beginning and the
[1:20:21] end need the Internet the worldwide web
[1:20:26] to perfect the
[1:20:29] bride by listening to ministers around
[1:20:32] the
[1:20:33] world and if you would say or think yes
[1:20:37] then why didn't God wait for the
[1:20:40] internet until the messenger to the age
[1:20:43] came to bring
[1:20:46] Christ now the worldwide web this is
[1:20:49] just a
[1:20:50] question this is just a
[1:20:52] question you know earlier in the message
[1:20:55] I didn't have the answer don't ask me
[1:20:57] don't ask me this question please don't
[1:21:00] ask me this question after so don't ask
[1:21:04] me we used to teach that to our kids
[1:21:07] people go to church say what' your dad
[1:21:10] buy what' your dad sell what did he
[1:21:13] plant said don't ask me I asked him
[1:21:24] the worldwide web was first created in
[1:21:30] 1969 after the prophet
[1:21:33] died and it was just between
[1:21:36] computers and then in
[1:21:38] 1983 the US defense
[1:21:41] data produced the worldwide web only
[1:21:45] between their
[1:21:46] computers for the Armed Forces of United
[1:21:49] States of
[1:21:50] America 1983
[1:21:54] I'm just giving you information to help
[1:21:57] you make up your
[1:21:59] decision but not until April 30th
[1:22:09] 1993
[1:22:11] remember it wasn't even in the Army
[1:22:13] until
[1:22:14] 83 and brother brandham thought that the
[1:22:18] thought I remember only thought he
[1:22:20] mentioned he couldn't see how we could
[1:22:23] survive past 19
[1:22:25] 1970 that was I know it wasn't a it
[1:22:28] wasn't a prophecy I know that was just a
[1:22:32] thought so in brother bram's thought
[1:22:35] pattern the bride would have been he he
[1:22:38] thought he thought because of the
[1:22:40] world's wickedness she could never
[1:22:43] survive past 1970 and and believe
[1:22:46] me he was
[1:22:49] right but to go along with that then the
[1:22:52] he would have thought the bride was
[1:22:53] perfected to be
[1:22:56] gone in April 1930 or April 30th
[1:23:02] 1993 was the worldwide web released to
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:08] public and then and only then could
[1:23:12] God's
[1:23:14] message go to his bride to perfect them
[1:23:26] that's why you can go
[1:23:27] home and listen to ministers every day
[1:23:31] of the week all day
[1:23:36] long all over the
[1:23:39] world and that's going to help you go in
[1:23:41] a Rapture because God couldn't do it
[1:23:45] with your home church and your pastor
[1:23:49] and the five-fold ministry that comes
[1:23:51] through this
[1:23:53] building so like in Luther's
[1:23:56] age there's going to be a really small
[1:23:58] bride cuz they never had the
[1:24:00] internet and in Wesley's age when he was
[1:24:03] riding his horse and it went in a hole
[1:24:05] and he got off and prayed for the broken
[1:24:07] leg and went on riding the horse cuz it
[1:24:09] was
[1:24:10] broken well there won't be very many
[1:24:12] bride there cuz cuz he was just riding a
[1:24:15] horse he never even had a Lincoln to
[1:24:16] drive around
[1:24:18] preaching I mean maybe it was a Lincoln
[1:24:20] horse
[1:24:22] but and then in brother bram's
[1:24:28] day was right after the Great
[1:24:31] Depression and they had the model A's
[1:24:33] and the model T's and you know you're
[1:24:35] young kids you don't know what it was
[1:24:37] like when we had a racetrack you come to
[1:24:38] the stop sign you have one foot in The
[1:24:40] Brak and you'd flutter the gas pedal on
[1:24:41] the other one and you'd
[1:24:43] have and if it flooded you had a clothes
[1:24:45] pin you put in the flood thing that and
[1:24:47] the fire would come out of the thing you
[1:24:48] know because you had a
[1:24:52] carburetor and God there's no no way God
[1:24:54] could have perfected a bride with a
[1:24:56] carburetor engine in the
[1:24:58] ministry cuz it wasn't a worldwide web
[1:25:03] then
[1:25:06] maybe and then if men say unto
[1:25:10] you that Christ is over here in this
[1:25:14] church because he's got a great ministry
[1:25:16] and I listen to it in the web that's
[1:25:18] right that's right on Monday Tuesday
[1:25:21] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
[1:25:22] Sunday
[1:25:26] and it's a lot more qualified than my
[1:25:28] fat Pastor in Wyoming or in
[1:25:33] wherever I'm believe me this is just
[1:25:36] this ain't me this is what
[1:25:39] God then we are going to be a good big
[1:25:42] bride we're going to be a good big bride
[1:25:45] in this last age after April 30th
[1:25:51] 1993 and there's going to be the largest
[1:25:54] part of the Rapture
[1:25:56] happened with those that are alive and
[1:25:59] remain because of the worldwide
[1:26:02] web now Satan considered it the web like
[1:26:07] a spider web that you would get caught
[1:26:11] in like a snare in the Bible and it
[1:26:15] would take you on a
[1:26:17] Wes
[1:26:22] y ouch
[1:26:30] don't believe it if he's in the secret
[1:26:33] chamber or in a different
[1:26:38] place
[1:26:40] because you would if you would if your
[1:26:43] answer don't please don't tell me if
[1:26:44] your answer would be yes to this
[1:26:46] question and it's okay if it is it's
[1:26:48] perfectly okay then you have to believe
[1:26:50] that God is Not
[1:26:52] omnipotent and you have you cannot
[1:26:54] believe the scripture that God spoke
[1:26:56] through a donkey to a prophet
[1:27:01] oh oh that one
[1:27:04] hurt and that no matter what great
[1:27:07] ministry around the world was preaching
[1:27:09] that they're coming under the cstone of
[1:27:10] the head and if God wants it here he
[1:27:13] could send it through a
[1:27:17] donkey even a fat
[1:27:20] Pastor or anyone
[1:27:25] even in a building that ain't sighted
[1:27:27] yet and looks really decrepid
[1:27:32] outside I just want to go back to Esther
[1:27:36] 213 and
[1:27:39] Esther re or required Esther
[1:27:44] 215 well 13 she had all the options to
[1:27:48] listen to the worldwide
[1:27:50] web to the greatest Ministry around the
[1:27:53] world yes yes yes and she said no thanks
[1:27:57] that's I'm going before my priest I
[1:28:01] don't want to be scarred by all their
[1:28:03] garbage that's right or even truth or
[1:28:06] even truth amen oh listen I M of
[1:28:12] those a huge percentage of those men
[1:28:14] they could come and preach here and I
[1:28:16] would just be glad to sit down yes even
[1:28:19] truth yes but Esther said
[1:28:24] that a nipotent god placed me in my
[1:28:27] family in this now listen in this
[1:28:32] terrible cold snowy place where I would
[1:28:34] rather be in El
[1:28:35] Salvador for a
[1:28:38] reason so if you would say that God
[1:28:40] needed the worldwide web to perfect you
[1:28:42] in the re now remember that we said that
[1:28:44] we read the quote earlier in the service
[1:28:46] I don't go to the top of my notes that
[1:28:47] you can't be schooled this
[1:28:50] in you can't be taught this by any
[1:28:52] minister no matter how well he puts the
[1:28:55] scriptures
[1:28:57] together it's a predestinated
[1:29:01] revelation Esther required nothing let
[1:29:04] me give you some things and I'm going to
[1:29:06] close on what the prophet said you know
[1:29:08] on he said the earthquake in India he
[1:29:09] said if God could speak to the
[1:29:12] animals when the educated smart weather
[1:29:15] people didn't know there was an
[1:29:16] earthquake coming and say leave the rock
[1:29:18] fences and leave the rock buildings a
[1:29:22] Beast hello amen cattle
[1:29:27] ducks and they knew not to come back to
[1:29:29] the Rock thing because they were
[1:29:31] connected with their
[1:29:34] father not to come to the rocks that it
[1:29:36] was going to hurt
[1:29:38] them no no no no brother Dale they had
[1:29:42] seen that on the
[1:29:44] internet how much more could God tell
[1:29:47] the bride of
[1:29:48] Christ through your local home church if
[1:29:52] you believe if you believe that there's
[1:29:54] a five-fold Ministry going through this
[1:29:57] place now that's not a oneman Ministry
[1:29:59] watch while tell said that very clearly
[1:30:02] if you believe there's a regular diet of
[1:30:05] fivefold
[1:30:07] ministry that's right if you believe
[1:30:09] that now I'll tell you what a regular
[1:30:11] diet of five-fold ministry is the ties
[1:30:14] of the
[1:30:15] ties that's what a regular diet
[1:30:19] is hello the ties to the ministry is to
[1:30:24] the th to the
[1:30:25] ministers a levite pays thigh to a
[1:30:29] levite that's how many fivefold Ministry
[1:30:32] we have through whatever the ties if you
[1:30:34] want to see more fivefold Ministry
[1:30:36] through load up your ties we'll load up
[1:30:38] the fivefold
[1:30:40] ministry cuz it comes right from the
[1:30:43] ties watch what the prophet said he said
[1:30:46] this is in the end time evangelist of 62
[1:30:48] he said but since God made man he
[1:30:51] redeemed man and he's been speaking
[1:30:52] through man and does not use any me
[1:30:56] agency of any mechanical
[1:31:00] device the worldwide
[1:31:02] with in 1963 perfecting of Faith now
[1:31:06] we're getting closer to the greatest
[1:31:08] Revelation before God pulls him off he
[1:31:10] said now then you hear this thus saith
[1:31:15] the Lord see because it's not Beyond
[1:31:19] human thinking it's up to the realm of
[1:31:22] God's thinking
[1:31:25] but you stand here and you just
[1:31:28] Branch producing fruit of the vine and
[1:31:31] God uses man and only man remember he
[1:31:35] said thus says the Lord and God does not
[1:31:37] use Machinery God doesn't use even a
[1:31:40] group of men God doesn't use an
[1:31:44] organization God uses an
[1:31:48] individual always that's right and
[1:31:51] perfecting
[1:31:52] 63825 perfect faith in the evening time
[1:31:55] and in conference in 60 he said now we
[1:31:58] are not divided the devil tries to
[1:32:01] divide Us by
[1:32:03] Mechanical Devices
[1:32:06] uhoh God is not the author of confusion
[1:32:10] that's brother brandham said your pastor
[1:32:14] holds the doctrine for the church and he
[1:32:17] said if you come to me I'll send you to
[1:32:20] your pastor that's right
[1:32:24] because he is the doctrine for the body
[1:32:27] he said he's the one that's LED you this
[1:32:29] far and he will lead you all the way and
[1:32:32] your
[1:32:33] pastor will be the one that'll stand
[1:32:36] there when his group that he's
[1:32:38] responsible for goes through so will the
[1:32:40] prophet when the age comes through
[1:32:44] amen I have a spoused you Amen to the
[1:32:50] husband not to the Lang staff to the
[1:32:57] husband right wow now in Hebrews 12 it
[1:33:02] says that if you can't take chastisement
[1:33:04] you're not even
[1:33:05] his that's right amen
[1:33:10] amen God help
[1:33:13] us God help us it's a
[1:33:18] question that every individual will have
[1:33:21] to
[1:33:22] ask does God need the help you know
[1:33:26] television was here when brother Brown's
[1:33:29] Ministry was here do you know the
[1:33:31] brother Brown said that God created
[1:33:34] television or allowed it to be created
[1:33:37] for his purpose and
[1:33:40] Satan oh yeah oh yes Twisted
[1:33:46] it and your
[1:33:49] Prophet never
[1:33:51] preached on public television
[1:33:58] I don't believe
[1:34:01] today our
[1:34:03] message that brother Brown would
[1:34:06] believe I didn't I don't believe that
[1:34:09] brother Brown would believe and I don't
[1:34:11] believe that God of brother Brown would
[1:34:14] believe that the message needs the
[1:34:17] help of the worldwide
[1:34:20] web for perfecting but what Satan has
[1:34:24] done is he has Twisted it yes for your
[1:34:27] confusion let's stand yes let's
[1:34:31] stand Hallelujah let's sing that song
