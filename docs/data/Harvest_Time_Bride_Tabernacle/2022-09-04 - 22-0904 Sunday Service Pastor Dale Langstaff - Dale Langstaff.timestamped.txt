[13:04] you know uh
[13:07] you just it's just the way it is amen
[13:10] you know you can look at that however
[13:11] you want you think of when they had the
[13:14] uh
[13:15] the freedom convoy
[13:17] how many people of us were interested in
[13:19] it and many went
[13:22] but when we have a freedom convey for
[13:23] jesus
[13:25] there's very little interest
[13:27] very few went
[13:30] now you could go for trudeau or you
[13:32] could go for christ
[13:34] amen
[13:36] and uh they're both fine but one's a lot
[13:38] more powerful than the other

[16:09] our computer's tired
[16:11] but we decided to wait until our lawyer
[16:14] stuff was done for the deed of the
[16:16] church we didn't really know what to
[16:18] expect in total for that
[16:20] and we want it to be

[16:26] so we're gonna wait and then we're gonna
[16:28] buy a new computer and
[16:30] and do some improvements that way so
[16:34] amen and an angel said unto her fear not
[16:36] mary for thou hast found favor
[16:41] with god
[16:43] and behold
[16:45] thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[16:48] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[16:51] his name
[16:52] jesus
[16:53] now you can make this
[16:55] to the message i want to preach on the
[16:58] message
[16:59] and
[17:01] you have found favor
[17:03] with god
[17:05] and you have conceived and become a son
[17:09] in yourself
[17:10] let's just drop to verse 35 and the
[17:13] angel said unto her
[17:16] the holy ghost show over uh
[17:18] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[17:20] the power of the highest shall
[17:22] overshadow thee and therefore also the
[17:25] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[17:27] shall be called
[17:29] the son of god this is exactly what's
[17:31] happening to each individual
[17:35] that's elect bride
[17:37] in our age amen with the baptism of the
[17:39] holy ghost here you know in verse 34 the
[17:42] verse above that then mary said unto the
[17:44] angel how shall it be
[17:47] and the world's asking how could christ
[17:49] bring a bride in this age how could he
[17:52] represent him exact identical self
[17:56] in our age how can it be
[17:58] it's because of god the holy ghost amen
[18:01] hallelujah and mary said those amazing
[18:03] words in verse 38 she said man mary said
[18:06] behold the handmaiden of the lord
[18:09] be it unto me
[18:12] according to thy word and the angel
[18:16] departed
[18:18] from her now i want you to knows here
[18:21] that every single word in the scripture
[18:25] has a
[18:26] purpose and a meeting
[18:30] and and i want to show you something
[18:32] that's very hard
[18:34] in the next few weeks and if i don't
[18:36] finish before the brothers come i'm
[18:37] going to continue on
[18:39] but i i believe as christian believers
[18:42] message believers
[18:43] we're missing
[18:45] the mark in a few spots
[18:48] and we're going to look into that here
[18:50] in first corinthians three
[18:53] first corinthians three and verse 11.
[18:58] verse 11 then we're going to drop the
[18:59] 16th for theirs
[19:01] for
[19:02] up for others
[19:04] for other foundations can no man lay
[19:08] than that which is laid
[19:11] which is christ
[19:13] jesus
[19:14] everybody's trying to lay a lot of stuff
[19:16] down
[19:19] but nobody can lay anything down
[19:22] but christ jesus
[19:24] and and this just dropped to verse 18
[19:26] for know ye not that ye are the temple
[19:28] of god and the spirit of god dwelleth in
[19:32] thee
[19:34] and then let's just drop down to verse
[19:36] 21. therefore let no man glory
[19:41] in
[19:43] man
[19:45] for all things
[19:49] are yours
[19:51] amen you may be seated god bless you
[19:54] god bless the reading of his word
[19:56] you know
[19:57] uh
[19:58] and i apologize we're going to show some
[20:00] quotes up here and and when i'm
[20:02] preaching doctrine i want to show you
[20:04] some quotes and i and so i have one up
[20:06] there i have the one of the last ones i
[20:08] sent to you vicky was a deity quote i
[20:10] don't don't have a title on it
[20:13] um
[20:14] it was one of the last
[20:15] three
[20:17] i sent later
[20:20] just forgive us we're kind of new at
[20:22] this
[20:23] where i am
[20:28] but you know there's some things that
[20:30] that you know the bride of christ i
[20:32] believe is you can uh can get right
[20:35] and and you know
[20:36] this this whole thought
[20:39] started
[20:40] and and god just compounded it when we
[20:43] had our vacation bible school here and
[20:45] the lady asked us
[20:47] about our denomination
[20:49] and how we were connected and what we
[20:51] believed
[20:53] and she had actually told me she said i
[20:55] had went online
[20:56] when i told her we never had a
[20:58] denomination she said i had one online
[20:59] and she said no no no no she said i went
[21:01] online and found out you know that you
[21:03] have a headquarters and your message
[21:05] believers
[21:06] and all that and all of that
[21:10] is true
[21:12] and all of that
[21:15] is false
[21:17] now let me repeat that
[21:20] she told me she went online she said now
[21:22] you're a message believer since she said
[21:23] i found out where your headquarters are
[21:25] and all that and you know you
[21:27] you know
[21:29] and all of that is true
[21:34] and all of that
[21:37] is false
[21:42] we have pushed
[21:45] men
[21:47] too much
[21:49] too much
[21:51] and we've pushed
[21:53] even minutes the five-fold ministry too
[21:56] much they have a purpose we have pushed
[21:59] even men too much
[22:01] over women
[22:05] we have pushed adults too much
[22:08] over children
[22:12] you know our prophet said it were
[22:14] exactly identically i'm going to
[22:18] prove this to you in nature exactly
[22:21] identically the same
[22:24] except a different
[22:26] position
[22:28] exactly the same you are exactly the
[22:32] elect
[22:33] purchase predestinated bride of christ
[22:36] identical
[22:39] so how could one elect bride
[22:42] identical
[22:43] part of christ
[22:45] look down their nose
[22:47] at another identical elect
[22:50] part
[22:52] of the bride of christ
[22:55] and i looked up you know studying the
[22:57] prophet
[22:58] and i'm going to have more for next week
[23:00] and different things
[23:03] definitely god used a prophet in this
[23:06] day a major prophet and uh and it
[23:09] brought a message
[23:11] but but
[23:13] never
[23:14] never never never witness
[23:17] we we for to til we go in the rapture
[23:20] we're going to say we're ma
[23:21] message when we're among ourselves
[23:24] but never ever witness
[23:27] or talk to your friends
[23:29] about a message
[23:31] talk to him about christ
[23:33] talk to him about christ jesus not a
[23:35] message talk to him about the word of
[23:37] god
[23:38] the holy bible and the christ
[23:41] jesus
[23:45] because you know in the bible
[23:47] you know in
[23:49] the prophet had a catholic person come
[23:52] to him and and just pray for me i'm i
[23:55] just scattered very much so but the
[23:57] prophet had a a
[23:59] catholic person come to him said god
[24:02] will judge the world by the catholic
[24:04] church
[24:06] that makes a lot of sense because there
[24:07] was the first church and you know john
[24:09] the baptist was in it and all these
[24:11] things and the first church
[24:14] and
[24:15] and you look at that and and you know
[24:17] what the prophet asked him
[24:19] god bless you brother fred the prophet
[24:21] asked them
[24:22] which one
[24:25] so now your message believers this
[24:27] morning let's just bring this up to
[24:28] 2022.
[24:32] you tell somebody you're witnessing and
[24:34] they're checking you out online
[24:37] and they say well which one
[24:41] are you the return ministry message
[24:43] believer
[24:44] or maybe you're the two souls message
[24:47] believers
[24:50] or
[24:51] maybe you're the perugia message
[24:53] believer
[24:55] or maybe you're just the tape only
[24:57] message believer
[25:01] or maybe you're only the voice of god
[25:06] which they patented the prophet's voice
[25:08] because they actually believed that the
[25:09] vocal cords of that man were actually
[25:12] the vocal cords
[25:15] maybe you're that message believer
[25:18] you see
[25:21] but see you can't divide christ
[25:24] if you're witnessing and you say i am a
[25:27] part of jesus christ
[25:29] he's undivided
[25:31] amen
[25:33] he's undivided
[25:37] you see what i'm saying
[25:40] everything that god's prophet brought
[25:42] was christ
[25:45] and you know we're going to look into
[25:46] that more than that but i want to show
[25:48] you something here and then i want to
[25:49] get into it and you know uh even when we
[25:52] pray
[25:53] you see so many things and let's can we
[25:55] can i have that one quote it's it don't
[25:57] have a title to it it's one of the last
[25:59] ones it's a it started paragraph 80.
[26:13] amen
[26:15] said all the functions
[26:21] you'll see
[26:22] just down just about four lines it'll
[26:25] say the deity of god
[26:28] is not in heaven
[26:30] y'all see that there
[26:32] it's in you
[26:35] and so when you get sick we come to the
[26:37] front and that's fine that's fine it's
[26:40] all fine
[26:41] and you get prayed for it
[26:43] but why
[26:47] do you know our prophet said i don't
[26:49] have this quote tomorrow i'll have it
[26:50] this week because i didn't put
[26:52] everything together coming back from
[26:54] ottawa yesterday late night do you know
[26:56] the prophet said that the greatest enemy
[26:59] that god had
[27:01] was hope
[27:04] he said nine he said if a thousand
[27:06] people come up to get prayer they would
[27:08] all say i have faith
[27:10] and he said 999
[27:14] would hope
[27:16] that hope
[27:17] but faith is not hope
[27:20] it's actually a purchased possession
[27:25] amen he said all you need to do
[27:28] to get your healing
[27:30] is accepted
[27:32] it's mine period i don't have to pray
[27:34] about it
[27:36] i don't have to get god's will it's mine
[27:39] it's not maybe it's mine i hope it's my
[27:41] i think it's mine it might be mine i
[27:43] wonder if it's god's will
[27:46] i've done all those prayers
[27:48] we pray for god's will
[27:50] the deity of god is not in heaven
[27:54] it's in you
[27:57] it's yours
[27:59] you you you hope that your children will
[28:02] be saved
[28:04] it it's your
[28:06] it's yours
[28:08] it's yours see you have to understand
[28:10] it's
[28:11] the the prophet said this he said for
[28:13] every holy ghost believer
[28:17] all the promises apply
[28:20] for you
[28:21] and your household you don't have to
[28:22] pray about that
[28:23] it's done
[28:25] it's a finnish work
[28:27] it's all
[28:28] over
[28:30] all the devils in hell couldn't take
[28:32] that from you
[28:33] amen it's over
[28:35] you say well
[28:37] my god will supply all my knees
[28:39] according to his riches of gourds and we
[28:41] get gray hair worrying about it
[28:46] you know why we do that
[28:48] because we hope
[28:51] we hope and we're looking
[28:54] for something that we can see
[28:57] and that's why we lift up
[29:01] a ministry a prophet a man
[29:05] when
[29:06] when we're exactly the same now i'm not
[29:08] going to show these once today because i
[29:10] don't have them up but our prophet said
[29:13] multiple times
[29:16] he actually said it he actually said it
[29:17] this strong just take my word for it and
[29:19] i'll prove it next sunday he said the
[29:20] reason that you don't have faith in the
[29:22] church
[29:24] is because you have big men and big
[29:26] ministers and big ministry and big
[29:28] people as you're looking to and you're
[29:31] putting your faith in them that's the
[29:33] reason we don't see it
[29:35] that's the reason that's pretty he said
[29:37] there's no holy hill there's no holy
[29:40] church there's no holy man there's no
[29:42] holy priesthood but there's a holy
[29:44] christ
[29:46] and the reason you ain't got the faith
[29:49] is because you're looking
[29:51] at the holy church
[29:53] you're looking at the holy
[29:56] but the christ
[29:57] is invisible
[30:00] amen
[30:02] let's just look down
[30:03] further and when you recognize almighty
[30:06] god just the next word he said when you
[30:07] recognize in the blue when you recognize
[30:09] that the almighty god lives in you in
[30:12] mortal life the life that gives his zodi
[30:15] life it's god's own life in a human
[30:17] being it's a
[30:19] 100 jehovah god
[30:22] you know you know and it's fine the
[30:23] prophet did it in the agency it was
[30:25] progressive revelation you know if that
[30:27] if we believe that we could get rid of
[30:28] the oil we never pray for another person
[30:33] but we have hope so we come for prayer
[30:37] that's powerful
[30:41] it's powerful
[30:44] the beginning of verse 82
[30:47] paragraph 82 he said our brother and
[30:49] sister he said that deity is in you and
[30:51] a little while the will cease to be no
[30:53] more
[30:54] and yet ye shall see me for i am in you
[30:58] and with you until the end
[31:00] of the age
[31:05] in a manger no
[31:06] christ in you hallelujah we're not right
[31:09] worshiping christ in a manger but we're
[31:11] worse but it's christ in you the holy
[31:13] ghost the hope of glory hallelujah the
[31:16] creator god dwelling in a human being
[31:19] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[31:24] for we shall see him
[31:26] as he is
[31:27] for we were made of him
[31:30] and the spirit
[31:32] in a human being
[31:36] that's that's amazing
[31:38] those are amazing words amen
[31:43] hallelujah
[31:45] i sent you another one vicky that had
[31:47] the title deity of jesus on it there you
[31:50] see right in the top
[31:51] paragraph 84 he said brother when the
[31:53] deity of god by the holy ghost comes
[31:55] into a human heart it calls everything
[31:58] out that
[31:59] that christ hasn't created
[32:02] and you know that's the truth
[32:05] that's the red there
[32:07] amen
[32:09] god christ the hope of glory in you
[32:12] not
[32:16] see how powerful that is
[32:26] wow thank you lord
[32:30] amen you pull up the next one it's a c
[32:33] that is in you it was one of the last
[32:35] ones also
[32:46] he said now if if christ was standing
[32:49] here
[32:50] right now
[32:52] he could do no more for you
[32:54] what he's already done
[32:56] he said your price has already been paid
[32:59] now he said he's the same
[33:01] he said what about your sickness he said
[33:03] the price it's already paid so you're
[33:05] asking for it and it's already done
[33:08] he said it's already paid he said every
[33:10] name that's already been healed every
[33:12] one of you is already healed period past
[33:15] tense
[33:17] you see that right there
[33:19] just down
[33:20] three to four lines
[33:22] healed of your sickness is that right
[33:26] for that every one of you are forgiven
[33:29] but you just have to accept it right
[33:32] there every one of you is healed you
[33:34] just have to accept it you're forgiven
[33:36] all you have to do
[33:39] is accept it
[33:41] amen
[33:43] see we live way below
[33:45] what god intended now he's proven that
[33:48] he's the same yesterday today and
[33:49] forever if he's standing here he
[33:51] couldn't heal you no more because of
[33:54] your unbelief
[33:57] amen
[33:58] he couldn't save you no more than if he
[34:00] isn't here
[34:01] because it's already done to him it's
[34:04] it's past god don't even you know i i do
[34:06] this sometimes and and you know because
[34:09] we're humans i tell my wife something i
[34:11] say pay a bill and then i forget about
[34:13] it because i told her to pay the bill
[34:15] and if she come back two weeks later and
[34:16] said i forgot to send that and i go
[34:20] you see i just completely forgot about
[34:21] it a guy said it and it's over but
[34:23] that's like god he said it and it's over
[34:25] and you come back to him asking him for
[34:27] something that he already did he's like
[34:28] oh
[34:30] my children are
[34:34] amen
[34:37] if you stand here he couldn't heal you
[34:39] at all
[34:40] with your unbelief he said
[34:42] you would have to believe it just the
[34:44] same as you believe it right now
[34:46] he said you'd have to the same because
[34:48] many mighty works
[34:50] he was unable to do because of their own
[34:52] belief when he was here
[34:55] wow
[34:57] amen let me show you
[34:59] example and a brother actually used some
[35:02] of this
[35:03] and uh uh
[35:05] i'm just gonna
[35:09] fish in his pond and use some of his
[35:11] stuff and use the kids and that let's
[35:13] just turn to john 12
[35:15] for a second and we're just going to
[35:16] read a scripture and show it and and
[35:19] we'll we won't be long this morning and
[35:21] and i want to i want to vindicate
[35:24] something to you
[35:25] very very
[35:29] here here's a quote
[35:31] in the original seed he said here's the
[35:33] secret the word
[35:34] is in the bride
[35:36] they have
[35:37] and the mind of christ to know
[35:40] what he wants done with the word and she
[35:42] does have his name
[35:44] and she has thus saith
[35:47] the lord
[35:49] amen it's it's already a finished work
[35:51] unbelievably
[35:55] that means we left internet connection
[35:58] oh okay it's all right
[36:00] we are going to replace your computer
[36:02] i'll go ahead and start you john 12.
[36:04] now let's just uh
[36:06] uh read a few scriptures here 21
[36:09] and then i'm going to maybe you can come
[36:11] out and bring that out and just uh
[36:16] be careful he said here here
[36:18] the same before philip was uh from
[36:21] galilee and he desired him saying sirs
[36:24] we would see jesus
[36:26] we would see jesus and philip came and
[36:29] told andrew and andrew this was jesus
[36:31] disciples and philip and he told jesus
[36:33] oh stan you can stand out farther from
[36:35] the pulpit out farther so he can go
[36:37] behind it
[36:38] and jesus answered him and saying he
[36:40] said the hour has come that the son of
[36:42] man should be glorified
[36:45] now he's going to be glorified
[36:47] in us this morning and you
[36:50] you are
[36:51] she
[36:52] you are she right right now watch 24 and
[36:56] he said verily verily i say unto you no
[36:57] this is christ jesus talking
[37:01] he said except the corn of wheat fall
[37:03] into the ground and die
[37:06] it abides alone
[37:09] but if it will die it'll bring forth
[37:12] much fruit
[37:13] and he that loveth his life shall lose
[37:16] it
[37:17] and he that hateth his life
[37:21] in this world
[37:22] shall keep it
[37:24] for eternal life you know when our our
[37:27] our prophet brought
[37:29] many nuggets when he was ministering see
[37:32] see
[37:34] you already have deity i showed you that
[37:37] deity's already living in you
[37:39] you don't have to come and ask for your
[37:41] healing you already have the purchased
[37:44] possession our prophet showed us the
[37:45] thing he said if you were hungry and you
[37:47] needed a loaf of bread and he said well
[37:49] how much is the loaf of bread and back
[37:51] then it was 25 cents and he said i give
[37:53] you the 25 cents he said you'll have
[37:55] just as much revival and just as much
[37:58] happiness
[38:00] and just as much fulfillment with the 25
[38:03] cents as you will with the loaf of bread
[38:05] because you have the purchase and power
[38:09] to go whenever you want and you can go
[38:11] into any store complete freedom and you
[38:14] can buy a loaf of bread
[38:17] and you know well
[38:19] very well
[38:20] that you have that power now that's
[38:22] exactly the same as you this morning
[38:26] you don't have to think i wonder if god
[38:27] will heal me
[38:32] you you'd have to have failure in
[38:34] believing the money that was paid
[38:36] the the the price that was paid which in
[38:39] this case it wasn't money it was calvary
[38:42] his blood
[38:43] amen you have the purchase power
[38:46] to believe your loved ones will be saved
[38:49] you have the purchase power to believe
[38:50] that you're going to make it he shows
[38:52] i'm going to show you later on the
[38:54] rapture is already completed
[38:57] you say well i'm praying i hope i can go
[38:59] in the rapture
[39:01] our prophet said it's already completely
[39:03] finished you know some places he said
[39:05] the rapture's inside you now
[39:07] he said sometimes one place he said it's
[39:10] ongoing now other places many places he
[39:13] said it's completely finished now
[39:17] but you'll hear ministers come up and
[39:20] say get ready for the rapture
[39:22] well yes you have to have the baptism of
[39:24] the holy ghost to go in the rapture
[39:26] that's for sure
[39:27] but if you have the baptism of the holy
[39:29] ghost listen to me church
[39:32] if you have the baptism of the holy
[39:34] ghost you are already ready for the
[39:36] rapture
[39:37] you don't have to get ready it's already
[39:40] happened
[39:44] you could no more be lost than god could
[39:46] be lost
[39:49] amen
[39:51] i want to show you something and a
[39:52] prophet preached about corn and wheat
[39:54] and showed you through the church ages
[39:56] you know but god was the grain of corn
[40:00] amen
[40:02] he was just one seed
[40:04] the church wasn't very big
[40:07] but this is deity
[40:09] jehovah god
[40:12] and god's saying when the people came to
[40:14] see him he said there's jehovah god
[40:18] but god created you because he was
[40:20] lonely
[40:23] right because he was lonely
[40:25] and he said now i'm going to stay lonely
[40:28] unless i'm willing to die on the cross
[40:30] and pay the price of redemption
[40:33] for the elect and the bride
[40:36] i'm going to stay lonely a long time
[40:41] but jehovah god was willing to send his
[40:43] son
[40:44] and pay the price of redemption for you
[40:46] and me
[40:48] so he wouldn't be lonely no more
[40:50] but he wants you
[40:52] his plan was that you would look exactly
[40:56] deity
[40:57] this is deity
[40:58] it hasn't died yet
[41:00] it has one's the cross that's exactly
[41:02] deity now let me ask you was that christ
[41:04] talking in the bible
[41:06] was that god that said he was a corn of
[41:08] wheat
[41:10] right
[41:10] so he's the corn of wheat
[41:12] and he got planted
[41:14] and he comes through seven church ages
[41:17] but he comes through some major
[41:18] messengers
[41:19] that let them out
[41:20] through the churches come you know there
[41:23] man
[41:24] and the first one that was coming back
[41:27] after all the dark ages was luther
[41:29] and luther was these leaves
[41:32] and you'll see the bottom ones are
[41:33] starting to dry up
[41:35] because
[41:36] around a long time
[41:38] and they're the farthest from the
[41:40] presence of god
[41:42] but luther was salvation
[41:44] now you'll see they still have life in
[41:46] them and when the when the power of god
[41:49] moves the wind blows them
[41:52] and then the next one that came up see
[41:54] we can't get rid of salvation you have
[41:56] to accept your salvation it's already
[41:58] before you just have to accept it
[42:00] amen and then came wesley and
[42:02] sanctification because god will never
[42:04] fill a dirty cop
[42:06] and wesley came and sanctification and
[42:09] he was a little higher up
[42:11] the the the the time the plant of
[42:13] history because see it was jehovah god
[42:15] that started in the bottom it was
[42:17] jehovah god that died in the bottom
[42:19] deity
[42:20] deity
[42:22] and so deity come up and he give you
[42:24] salvation
[42:26] through luther
[42:27] but luther still smoked the pipe
[42:30] had lots of issues in his life
[42:32] then wesley came up
[42:34] and he was
[42:36] set aside for purpose
[42:38] a holiness and a clean life and then we
[42:40] see
[42:41] that pentecost come up and it was the
[42:43] baptism
[42:45] it was pentecost come up and it was the
[42:47] restoration of the gifts
[42:49] and you know when pentecost came up it
[42:52] was the last move
[42:54] before
[42:56] the outpouring the baptism of the holy
[42:58] ghost it was the last move before the
[42:59] authority of holy ghost and you know
[43:01] when it first come up and even still now
[43:04] it looks like seed
[43:08] huh
[43:09] it looks like seed
[43:11] and somebody's well like i i'm speaking
[43:13] in tongues
[43:15] i i'm prophesying
[43:18] and that's it i'm the seed of god right
[43:20] there
[43:20] just look like seed
[43:22] but none of this is going in my combine
[43:24] bin
[43:25] it looked like seed it was all part of
[43:27] god's plan
[43:28] and so we don't get rid of salvation
[43:32] and we don't get rid of the
[43:33] sanctification
[43:34] and we don't get rid of speaking in
[43:35] tongues or prophesying
[43:38] or shouting or running the house
[43:41] but we're but but but have we reached
[43:43] deity yet
[43:45] is that deity
[43:48] it's not quite as big as deity
[43:51] but now something happened
[43:53] from pentecost
[43:56] to deity
[44:00] and can you see it
[44:05] you can't see it
[44:08] a prophet preached the invisible union
[44:10] of god
[44:12] talked about the invisible god
[44:15] but we in the flesh we want to look to a
[44:17] holy hill
[44:18] a holy priesthood
[44:20] a holy bishop a holy
[44:23] five-fold ministry
[44:24] a holy husband
[44:26] and we want to
[44:29] look down on
[44:35] but how do we get from speaking in
[44:36] tongues
[44:39] and prophecy
[44:41] that when it first come out it actually
[44:42] look when it was coming up we said oh
[44:44] that's it we've arrived that's it
[44:48] but we're building a house
[44:51] we turn corners
[44:53] and we realize that when we check the
[44:55] seed
[44:56] the seed wasn't as big up here
[45:00] so we want to get exactly
[45:02] to deity right because the deity started
[45:04] there
[45:05] right
[45:07] and so when the deity died it said what
[45:09] did it say in the scripture maybe we
[45:10] could pull it up he said
[45:13] let's go back when he said unless he
[45:16] barely say unless the corner weak fall
[45:17] in the ground and die
[45:19] it abides alone now if you look in this
[45:21] ground here you're not going to find the
[45:23] seed no more
[45:25] now i i didn't have time this morning to
[45:27] undo that ground and find the seed but
[45:29] i'll promise you
[45:31] by next sunday if you want to wash that
[45:33] off that you ain't going to find nothing
[45:34] that looks like deity
[45:36] but that all started from deity
[45:39] and you're all in this plant
[45:43] but but but i want to ask you again i
[45:45] said now that looked like
[45:47] like pentecost looked like the seed
[45:52] but we realized with a closer look it
[45:54] wasn't the seed
[45:56] and something happened from pentecost
[46:00] something has to happen from pentecost
[46:01] to bring us back to the seed
[46:07] you know our prophet taught do you know
[46:10] who our prophet had to go to before his
[46:12] ministry started
[46:14] do you know who god judged him for when
[46:16] his when he listened to his wife and his
[46:18] mother-in-law because he talked bad
[46:20] about those people
[46:22] our prophet had to go and get the baton
[46:24] from pentecost
[46:26] to carry on the movement of god
[46:29] and that's why he was sent
[46:31] to the he wasn't pentecost
[46:33] but he had to and pentecost was going
[46:36] into denomination
[46:38] and they said the pentecost was saying
[46:40] we've arrived we're seed
[46:43] and god had to send a messenger
[46:46] and go to pentecost and pick up the
[46:48] baton and carry on
[46:50] but do you see the baton
[46:54] do you see the message
[46:57] do you even see jehovah god yet
[47:03] do you see what made jehovah god
[47:10] it's a mystery
[47:12] it was a mystery and it was on veil to
[47:15] those that would hear it
[47:17] and accept it it was better yet it was
[47:20] unveiled to those
[47:22] that were in his plan
[47:24] it was unveiled to those
[47:26] who were predestinated
[47:29] there's no more condemnation to those
[47:31] that are in christ jesus
[47:33] amen
[47:34] now maybe
[47:37] somewhere on this stock
[47:39] see jesus said
[47:40] i'll abide alone so when he died he knew
[47:46] he wouldn't be alone
[47:47] but we ain't found them yet
[47:50] is it over
[47:52] of course it's not over
[47:55] but what got god
[47:57] back to god
[47:59] there was a mystery
[48:02] but in the natural i can tell you what
[48:03] it was
[48:05] it was called poland
[48:09] there was
[48:10] invisible polar
[48:12] that came from pentecost
[48:16] the germinated seeds
[48:18] it's like predestination can you see
[48:21] pre-the nation
[48:23] where is it
[48:25] can you see the call that they're called
[48:27] and chosen justified and already
[48:29] glorified see you are living we're
[48:32] preaching a wrong message
[48:34] i don't mean
[48:35] let me like i mean the people in many
[48:38] cases i don't mean the message is wrong
[48:39] don't misunderstand me
[48:41] you are already glorified
[48:48] we're still praying for glorification
[48:51] the bible says we're already going fresh
[48:54] romans 8 says those that
[48:57] you chose called
[48:58] justified glorified
[49:01] it's history
[49:03] and god's saying i did everything for
[49:05] you history now felix maybe you can come
[49:07] up and help us find jehovah again
[49:11] i know you don't know where to look but
[49:13] just give it a good idea and pull her
[49:16] back so we can see jehovah
[49:18] yeah go ahead you can pull them open
[49:21] pull the right oh right to the right to
[49:23] the meat of the thing so a little deeper
[49:24] a little deeper
[49:26] a little deeper
[49:28] right to the cup
[49:31] there we go just go right in there okay
[49:34] oh okay that's good yeah that's good
[49:36] that's good look at that
[49:42] pull that side down
[49:45] you all see that
[49:48] there's deity again
[49:50] how did that get there
[49:52] invisible union of christ
[49:55] deity
[49:57] now i want to point out one other thing
[50:00] a couple other things
[50:02] do you see any difference in any of the
[50:04] kernels of car
[50:09] they all look identical
[50:11] all in nice rows
[50:13] it's not a big you know kingdom here
[50:15] with a a palace and a pulpit on it or
[50:18] there's no like king chair
[50:21] they're all
[50:22] all the kids that died in birth or
[50:24] infancy they're all there
[50:26] they look identical to all the fat
[50:28] preachers
[50:29] and the prophets
[50:32] they're all identical
[50:34] deity
[50:36] all the same with jesus
[50:38] and the visible union
[50:41] the world will never see her
[50:43] they'll never figure it out
[50:45] because it was invisible
[50:47] because you were in the mind of god
[50:50] god through predestination
[50:52] made it happen
[50:54] and nobody can figure this out
[50:56] doctors and scientists and everybody say
[50:59] how in the world
[51:00] can this rot and bring that
[51:04] now look at how many more of that is on
[51:06] that
[51:08] i want to show you something else
[51:10] and this is
[51:11] for us all
[51:13] you know we live in a rural area
[51:16] and you say well you know there's not as
[51:18] many people here
[51:20] and so there won't be as many in charge
[51:23] let me show you something
[51:26] i got this stock
[51:28] on a thinner part of the field
[51:31] where the guy driving the planter went a
[51:33] little wide on the
[51:34] headlamp
[51:36] and there was just a little bit bigger
[51:39] space for my shovel to go in
[51:41] so the stock was maybe four inches apart
[51:43] from the next stock
[51:45] and all the stocks that were living in a
[51:47] rural area
[51:48] and were thinner
[51:51] produced
[51:52] two cops
[51:57] because
[51:58] they had more deity
[52:00] and they had more fruit
[52:02] because see when the deity fell on the
[52:04] ground they were able to get more water
[52:07] and they brought forth and so if you
[52:09] were living in toronto in a crowded area
[52:11] you just had one cob maybe not as big
[52:15] because the other competition was eaten
[52:17] for the same water
[52:19] huh
[52:20] so it's no excuses why we don't witness
[52:24] and bring people to christ
[52:26] because see you have a bigger drink of
[52:29] water
[52:31] and so you can push out more deity
[52:36] huh
[52:38] any difference
[52:39] all the same
[52:40] i feel like
[52:41] maybe you can go get the fan status you
[52:43] can go to your seat for a minute
[52:45] you can go to your seat think it's felix
[52:48] just turn the fan on the corn here
[52:51] just turn the fan on the corner
[52:52] you'll see
[52:54] how
[52:54] in other church ages
[52:58] see turn it on high push the back button
[53:02] see they're still alive
[53:06] they still they have lots of life
[53:09] but it ain't
[53:12] deity thank you
[53:16] and then in time just like the bottom
[53:18] cubs already fell on its own
[53:20] them all fallen humility
[53:23] they become hard
[53:25] just like the deity did
[53:28] in the beginning you can put this back
[53:30] in the office
[53:33] amen
[53:36] so how
[53:39] how
[53:41] the world
[53:42] could we make a difference from deity
[53:45] and deity
[53:47] you see
[53:48] delight is already in you
[53:51] the power of god is already in you
[53:54] there ain't no big eyes and no little
[53:56] use
[53:57] sisters aren't below brothers and kids
[54:00] aren't below dads
[54:02] not in deity
[54:04] different position
[54:06] different position
[54:08] but even as parents watch how you treat
[54:10] your kids husbands and wives watch how
[54:12] you treat each other brothers and
[54:14] sisters deity
[54:16] what you do is deity see you have the
[54:19] purchase price
[54:21] so it's not like it's going to happen
[54:23] it's already happened
[54:25] i'm not going to get saved i already am
[54:29] saved i'm not going in the rapture i'm
[54:32] already in the rapture
[54:34] it's already happened
[54:36] i'm not going to be healed i've already
[54:38] been healed
[54:39] it's regardless of what your body feels
[54:42] like
[54:43] he said you're just waiting if you're
[54:44] waiting for healing this morning you are
[54:46] just waiting for that stiff body to come
[54:49] back together
[54:51] it has nothing to do with it being there
[54:54] if your hands stiff or your back stiff
[54:57] you're just waiting for the
[54:58] manifestation but it's already happened
[55:01] if you're waiting for your loved ones to
[55:02] get saved
[55:04] amen
[55:05] you've cut all you got to do is claim it
[55:07] accept it
[55:08] you you said well i can't see it it's
[55:10] just waiting for the manifestation
[55:12] the manifestation's going to catch up
[55:14] see see watch this this deity this deity
[55:18] hadn't manifested the whole stock yet
[55:22] and it took a process for that to come
[55:24] back into deity
[55:26] and but when this deity died
[55:29] it was already paid
[55:32] that was already paid in that stock
[55:34] but it hadn't come out in evidence yet
[55:38] all you had to do is be patient
[55:40] but don't doubt
[55:42] don't go dig this seat up
[55:44] don't hurt the plan
[55:46] you say what but i i seen the leaves
[55:48] come up and so i dug it up because i
[55:50] didn't see deity
[55:54] i didn't see my loved ones get saved so
[55:56] i threw them in the garbage because i
[55:58] didn't see
[55:59] see
[55:59] it was a process
[56:02] it was happening
[56:04] you said to wait
[56:06] the rapture it's happening
[56:08] it's already happened you don't have to
[56:10] man
[56:12] it's already happened
[56:14] it's already yours it's already done
[56:18] oh that's beautiful
[56:21] thank you lord jesus
[56:23] it's so so amazing the all these things
[56:26] i'm saying there's in the scriptures let
[56:28] me let's just look at some scriptures
[56:30] that are here amen
[56:33] so your family is already saved is acts
[56:35] 16 31 maybe we can pull that out
[56:39] acts 16 through 6 he said it's already
[56:42] done he said if you can believe for you
[56:44] and your household praise god that's
[56:47] acts 16
[56:48] 38
[56:53] rapture
[56:57] the rapture has already happened
[57:00] revelations 8 1.
[57:03] revelations 8 1 there's therefore no
[57:05] condemnation to them that are in christ
[57:06] jesus
[57:08] you're praying to go in the rapture it's
[57:09] already
[57:10] happened it's already history see see
[57:13] how the different style is
[57:16] all you're doing is just waiting for the
[57:17] manifestations you say but i still see
[57:19] i'm i'm too heavy to go in the rapture
[57:21] no i'm just waiting for my glorified
[57:22] body to pick me up
[57:25] it's history
[57:27] amen
[57:29] if you're in christ
[57:31] you know you must be born again
[57:33] to be in this state amen
[57:35] look at this uh
[57:40] uh
[57:41] let's go to 14 and revelation romans 8.
[57:45] romans 8. for as many as are led by the
[57:47] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[57:49] and he foreknew
[57:52] he also did predestinate and conform to
[57:54] the image the exact image of his son
[57:59] hallelujah to them he's also glorified
[58:10] so we jump from 14 to 29 and 30
[58:13] in romans
[58:14] 8. deuteronomy 31 6
[58:17] be strong and courageous and fear not
[58:19] for nor be afraid of them
[58:22] for the lord thy god he is both with
[58:24] thee
[58:26] he is he is it that is both to go with
[58:30] thee and he will not fail thee nor for
[58:32] safety
[58:34] and of course hebrews 13 5 he said he
[58:36] has said i'll never leave thee
[58:40] nor forsake thee
[58:42] see it's already happened
[58:44] and
[58:45] you know many times as believers because
[58:48] we have our eyes on a holy hill or a
[58:50] holy church or a holy priesthood
[58:54] we lack faith
[58:56] we lack faith and so we operate our
[58:58] christian walk
[59:00] all in fear
[59:02] god never ever intended that
[59:05] god never ever intended that when moses
[59:07] came to god when the children of everest
[59:10] were leaving he said why why are you
[59:11] coming to me
[59:12] he said just speak
[59:15] just speak
[59:17] it's time that we start recognizing the
[59:19] deity of christ in our lives
[59:22] start speaking
[59:24] amen
[59:26] god help us
[59:28] god help us let's look at some of those
[59:29] other quotes that i sent you ricky
[59:39] just in closing here
[59:43] calling jesus on the scene
[1:00:02] i believe i sent that to you
[1:00:04] now the invisible god
[1:00:06] here he's calling jesus on the scene at
[1:00:08] 63 he said now the invisible god
[1:00:10] identifies himself in you and you are
[1:00:13] the temple and you are his body the
[1:00:15] temple of the holy spirit and in that in
[1:00:17] that paragraph he's got invisible
[1:00:19] mention like six times
[1:00:23] maybe i didn't send that to you
[1:00:26] okay
[1:00:28] i just want you to see this you see you
[1:00:30] know i'm not making this up
[1:00:33] man

[1:01:00] we got another one uh 63 awakening jesus
[1:01:03] here in
[1:01:05] in 203 says and you might be able to
[1:01:08] open your eyes and see him well here
[1:01:10] let's start again he said certainly he
[1:01:11] lives it's he said that's the thing that
[1:01:14] you bump into from time to time
[1:01:16] he said that's the thing that condemns
[1:01:18] you when you do wrong he said that's the
[1:01:20] thing that makes you believe he said
[1:01:23] that's him
[1:01:24] he said you might be able to open your
[1:01:26] eyes and see him because he's in the
[1:01:28] spirit form that's the invisible god
[1:01:32] might not be able to open your eyes and
[1:01:34] see him he said that's the visible god
[1:01:36] but he dwells with among
[1:01:38] the visible people making himself invis
[1:01:42] visible by his promises in the word to
[1:01:45] the people
[1:01:46] do you understand can you not get
[1:01:50] up oh
[1:01:53] love to buy you a new phone
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:58] i'm just going to read some of these
[1:01:59] quotes here
[1:02:00] and we'll close
[1:02:02] the rapture
[1:02:05] he said and hiding himself in simplicity
[1:02:07] he said how do you do how do you know
[1:02:09] the rapture
[1:02:11] is not going on
[1:02:12] all the time
[1:02:14] he said first thing you know it'll come
[1:02:15] to pass and one will disappear here and
[1:02:17] one will disappear there
[1:02:20] hallelujah
[1:02:23] he said
[1:02:25] here and that that he that is within you
[1:02:29] he said about your sickness he said the
[1:02:31] price is already paid everything has
[1:02:33] already been healed and your sickness
[1:02:35] says that he said that's right and every
[1:02:37] one of you is forgiven but you just have
[1:02:40] to accept it he said everyone is healed
[1:02:42] but you just have to accept it now to
[1:02:45] prove it he's the same yesterday today
[1:02:47] and forever if he's standing here to
[1:02:49] heal you
[1:02:50] he said
[1:02:51] at all with your unbelief he said
[1:02:55] he would have you would have to believe
[1:02:56] it just the same as you do
[1:02:59] now
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:04] the rapture even the rapture is already
[1:03:07] completed this is surged when you see
[1:03:09] jesus
[1:03:11] the work of redemption for your soul and
[1:03:13] your body is complete
[1:03:14] and even the rapture is already
[1:03:16] completed but jesus rose from the day
[1:03:18] god justified by your faith believing
[1:03:20] that god rose
[1:03:23] we are waiting for the rapture but it's
[1:03:25] already complete
[1:03:27] just waiting for the manifestation
[1:03:30] hallelujah
[1:03:32] lord show us the father
[1:03:34] in 86 he said
[1:03:36] don't
[1:03:37] resent that
[1:03:39] he said that's the truth well here let
[1:03:41] me go up farther he said what are we
[1:03:45] he said that's the way christians is
[1:03:46] today we are planted together in christ
[1:03:48] jesus who is the exhaust exhaustible
[1:03:52] inexhaustible foundation of life we are
[1:03:55] planted in christ jesus and you just
[1:03:57] drink up
[1:03:59] and that receives the baptism of the
[1:04:01] holy ghost you're planted in christ
[1:04:02] hallelujah the holy ghost the baptism
[1:04:05] yes sir everything you have need of in
[1:04:07] your life journey even the rapture is
[1:04:10] already in you then
[1:04:12] he said don't resent it
[1:04:15] he said that's the truth the rapture is
[1:04:17] in us now and we'll prove it by the
[1:04:19] gospel for them whom he justified
[1:04:22] he has glorified
[1:04:26] then in heaven today we are as glorified
[1:04:28] in the presence of god right now and i'm
[1:04:31] pushing out to it
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:35] glor god in his word
[1:04:38] do you believe it
[1:04:41] and many look away to immortal clay here
[1:04:44] here we're just going to close with a
[1:04:45] couple of these talking about how all
[1:04:47] the cobb
[1:04:49] looked exactly the same
[1:04:51] he said many look away to mortal clay of
[1:04:54] a servant and maybe they look to him
[1:04:57] and may they look to him the omnipotent
[1:05:00] who is
[1:05:01] we know the lord
[1:05:03] that we are finite
[1:05:06] no matter who we are we are still mortal
[1:05:09] but not
[1:05:13] but not the messenger but the message
[1:05:15] god granted lord
[1:05:17] that's where we point to jesus christ
[1:05:19] the son of god grant that he will be
[1:05:22] so real to every one of us today
[1:05:27] the absolute to the entire congregation
[1:05:30] we must do in our lives when we see him
[1:05:33] that we we see only him and not some
[1:05:36] bishop and not some great man or
[1:05:39] something that we take a pattern of
[1:05:41] but we look to jesus christ not some
[1:05:44] organization or not some pope or not
[1:05:46] some archbishop or clergy clergy
[1:05:50] or some divine man that we call on earth
[1:05:52] but we must look to jesus christ for he
[1:05:55] alone
[1:05:56] is our word
[1:05:58] amen let's stand
[1:06:02] god help us
[1:06:06] god help us this day remember
[1:06:08] the serpent that moses raised up in the
[1:06:10] i believe it was moses raised up in the
[1:06:12] wilderness
[1:06:14] the very thing that god created for the
[1:06:16] people to be healed and saved
[1:06:18] the prophet had to tear down because
[1:06:20] they worshiped
[1:06:22] the very same thing
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:25] see we're always looking for a vis a
[1:06:28] visible god
[1:06:30] if you want to look for a visible god
[1:06:31] look to each other
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] but god is the spirit
[1:06:37] and says he's invisible and so that's
[1:06:39] the reason our faith
[1:06:41] is shaken
[1:06:42] because we're looking and i'm sure that
[1:06:45] thing next sunday
[1:06:47] lord willing amen
[1:06:49] god help us
[1:06:51] to see how god brought us
[1:06:54] and so see how we would change we would
[1:06:56] get sick and say and and i mean i
[1:06:58] understand when we pray for him we're
[1:07:00] praying to that god will raise our faith
[1:07:02] and accept our healing
[1:07:04] but see how when we come into maturity
[1:07:06] we can change
[1:07:08] we just say i'm sick
[1:07:12] it's lying vanity look at look at when
[1:07:15] he was in the whale
[1:07:16] was all lying vanity
[1:07:19] i'm a son of god
[1:07:20] i can no more be sick than
[1:07:24] man
[1:07:26] all you had to do was just accept it
[1:07:28] you're sick you don't have to pray and
[1:07:30] ask god for your healing say god i
[1:07:32] accept my healing it's already done
[1:07:35] you got unsaved loved ones say god i've
[1:07:37] accepted them into the fold they're part

[1:07:45] already done it's inside me
