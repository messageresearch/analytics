But he has a special purpose here this morning. &gt;&gt; We shall see the move of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very interesting that I was there as I bow my head to pray a sharp headache just bam. &gt;&gt; Oh Satan. &gt;&gt; As if my head was about to burst and immediately I know it is an attack of the devil. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I say, Satan, in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; take your filthy hands off my head. &gt;&gt; And I must report immediately. &gt;&gt; It disappeared. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Disappeared immediately. But we're going to have a special service today. &gt;&gt; I mean, special Thank you. &gt;&gt; The Lord showed me few persons there that we're going to pray with &gt;&gt; and their requests will be answered by God. &gt;&gt; Can Barbara want to sing before I give you a testimony? &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless Jesus. Bless Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Bless. &gt;&gt; You know, I never like the color green. Every time I dream see something green, it's always a disappointment. So, I'm not a green person, but I I really thank God for being in your midst this morning. Uh it's been a blessing. Uh um I must apologize for not being at sister &gt;&gt; their house. Yeah. Because I wasn't doing well. It's not because of the food. &gt;&gt; The food was lovely. But um doctor put me on a diet for a couple months now and I've been doing it. So come here the sudden switch &gt;&gt; kind of affect my body cuz I I I was told telling sister Len I eat like midday &gt;&gt; and I don't eat again until maybe 6:00 and then I don't eat again until midday the other day. So coming here I switch so fast from break you know switching to breakfast and switching to this. So it put my body in &gt;&gt; but I'm doing better and thanks for your prayers. But you know when I'm coming out this song just dropped in my heart. I don't know all the words. I'm just going to do a verse of it &gt;&gt; and the chorus trust it be a blessing. There's a sweet sweet spirit in this place. And I know it is the presence of the Lord. There's a sweet expression on each face. [Music] And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Without a doubt, I know this. &gt;&gt; We certainly &gt;&gt; have a wonderful &gt;&gt; camp meeting this season. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I appreciate every one of us that yield ourselves to the &gt;&gt; purpose of God. &gt;&gt; You know, it was more than a gathering, but it was purpose being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I I said often times I don't believe in coincidence. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a coincidence when I met Brother Steve and sister &gt;&gt; Judy. &gt;&gt; Judy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it Judy or Trudy? &gt;&gt; Trudy. &gt;&gt; Judy. It wasn't a coincidence. &gt;&gt; It was predestinated by [Applause] &gt;&gt; I met other persons here. Is that brother Steve there and it was wasn't a coincidence &gt;&gt; and I met Ken and Ronda. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wasn't a coincidence. &gt;&gt; You talk about people with sweet spirit. &gt;&gt; Come again to meet you and be a part of you and &gt;&gt; things are happening. &gt;&gt; God has been speaking to us. God is being when you talk about the blessing of the Lord, just don't talk about he touch you on the shoulder or he give you a fresh anointing. &gt;&gt; He meets you. He deals with the situations &gt;&gt; that we have around us. &gt;&gt; Often times you may go want to go in the presence of the Lord and you know just just your past trying to surface &gt;&gt; its ugly head, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. You know, and the Holy Spirit is just reminding you just believe. &gt;&gt; Just believe. &gt;&gt; No better place I could have been but where the body of Christ is. &gt;&gt; This is the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And I must say, thank you, brother Dale. &gt;&gt; You're being a fine pastor. Honestly, we're being a fine pasture and &gt;&gt; Sister Luan just great that you know you're being there. You fed us &gt;&gt; well. And brother Dale, he he loves people and I picked out of his spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He has a love for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I preached one time and it says not because you can work on the farm doesn't mean that you can manage it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not because you can preach doesn't mean that you can pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the pastor may not be the brightest person in the group. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But that's who God chose. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When you understand predestination, then sometimes we think different because &gt;&gt; here you are and it's God's &gt;&gt; it's God's will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that brother Daily should be here, pastor. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And it's it was God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Elijah be at Brook Sherid. I've got some birds to feed you. &gt;&gt; There were not the cleanest birds, the best birds, &gt;&gt; but it's God's work. &gt;&gt; And so your pastor may preach two hours and you just get five minutes out of it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. He may read a whole book and you just get a verse. &gt;&gt; That's what God want for you today. &gt;&gt; God never sent Elijah to fall in love with those ravens. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God said, "Open your mouth and take the food." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm saying something to us this morning. When God sent Elijah some probably 84 miles north to uh to to &gt;&gt; Zeraphat, &gt;&gt; I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God never said, "I'm sending you to convert the widow woman." &gt;&gt; You just go and and get my sustenance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, God converted me. And you know why? He told he I realized that I God never sent me to be the potter. &gt;&gt; I'm just a clay like anybody else. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Pastor, you're not the potter. &gt;&gt; You just yield yourself for God to use you. &gt;&gt; God taught me that I'm not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And so, you know, just just don't rush me because you don't even know if you're going to see me again. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But God sent me here today for &gt;&gt; Hy, [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; God told me, "Call your name to me, Hy." &gt;&gt; Where is Jeff? &gt;&gt; God sent me here for Jeff, too. &gt;&gt; Sister Patty, is that you? &gt;&gt; God gave me a word for you. I got to do what God &gt;&gt; is good. There was a let me give you a testimony. You know there is a group of people that would meet some two hours away from our place close to the ocean. They meet like at a public library on a bench and they would read their Bibles. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; And they have no building. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But there's a body there. &gt;&gt; And I baptized some there. I went in the area where witnessing and it's like you walk through a riverbed to go up there. And &gt;&gt; if if rain falls, &gt;&gt; you walk in mud as thick as a foot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you still got to go. And &gt;&gt; you talk about a bad place that most people wouldn't go. But guys up there smoking and helping me setting up the things for service. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they were like, "Pastor, this don't bother you." I said, "Do you think &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach the word?" &gt;&gt; They're burning their thing. And you know if you if you pay attention to their clothes they're shot me here &gt;&gt; their firearm and I don't see that and I'm preaching there and they would sit on stones there for the old service &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; and I don't go up there and talk and try to clean them. Christ said you are clean through the word &gt;&gt; and I baptized a few there and you talk about people with free spirit. I mean I've seen the power of God move. A man was diagnosed with cancer and he was in the house &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit just spoke his condition and he was in the house and we didn't see &gt;&gt; and you know all of that. So these group of people they would meet in the public park and they would read their Bibles and this particular day one Saturday they were there you know reading and that's how I get to baptize people just go to them and say what are you reading and this particular day they were reading Acts chapter 2 together no preachers are there but they're just sat in the sweet presence of God just moving &gt;&gt; and there is a young man about 28 29 walk up to them and says, you know, he was there admiring the people. They they don't know where he came from. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; And he walked up to them and he says, "Please, um, you know, I got a dream sometimes ago, probably 4 days before." He said, "I dream seeing a short man." And he described the man in the vision in the dream vision. And the the lady, hello, the lady says, "I know exactly who you're dreaming." See, &gt;&gt; and she said, "I'm going to call him right now." &gt;&gt; And she called my number and she said, "Brother Bartley, there's a man here says the Lord send him to you." &gt;&gt; I said, "I'm 2 hours away that Saturday." So the Sunday morning, I got up and I said, "Barbara, I'm going." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I drove two hours. I took brother Baker with me &gt;&gt; and I drove 2 hours and when the man saw me he said he's not a Christian &gt;&gt; but he said God showed me in the vision &gt;&gt; and he said this is who God showed me. He said God tell me in the dream that you must baptize me in the name of Jesus Christ. And I drove over to the ocean and you know and I I I I took him into the water and I don't know his name. I don't know where he came from. &gt;&gt; I just yield myself to what God said. &gt;&gt; This is not about me. I'm talking about predestination. And uh when I took him to the water and the you know when I baptized him in the name of Jesus, he rose up screaming, "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "I know there was something that I needed." &gt;&gt; And after he he works on a ship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He just came to Jamaica on the ship. And while he was coming on the ship, God gave him the vision. &gt;&gt; And oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when I baptized him and amen, I hugged him and I put my hands on him because the Bible says uh Paul the Apostle laid his hands on them in Ephesus. That's right. &gt;&gt; And they received the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And I laid my hands on him and I said, "Receive the Holy Ghost." And I when I departed, I never see him again. &gt;&gt; I don't need to see him again. &gt;&gt; I never sent him to a church. &gt;&gt; I have no church to send him to. &gt;&gt; I send this soul to glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how God works. And he's still working the same today &gt;&gt; as he was yesterday. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not because you're Abram seed doesn't mean that you are the children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not because you believe the message doesn't mean that you are the wife of Christ. &gt;&gt; Whoa. That's strong, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not all believers are the wife of Christ. All right. &gt;&gt; When God sent his message to put us, Glory to God, putting us to become the word in flesh, &gt;&gt; now the word is in flesh. &gt;&gt; And people rejecting the son of man again. &gt;&gt; He was a son of man. &gt;&gt; Introducing or declaring the son of man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ and his wife become one. vision of man &gt;&gt; manifesting the sons of God &gt;&gt; who creation has been waiting for &gt;&gt; creation hasn't been waiting for preachers &gt;&gt; creation has been waiting for the son of god &gt;&gt; to bring back the power and the authority of almighty god &gt;&gt; glory to god &gt;&gt; not all who believed in Jesus were disciples &gt;&gt; not all who lived in Israel were Jews. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing. &gt;&gt; Not all who were children of Abram and the flesh there were seed. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You talk about a group of men that would radical Jesus teaching. &gt;&gt; But it takes a woman married five married and divorced five times &gt;&gt; and living with a man that wasn't him or hers. And when the presence of God met her, &gt;&gt; she said, "Sir, I perceive you're a prophet." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I perceive you're a prophet. &gt;&gt; Religions turn him away. &gt;&gt; But the true seed of Abraham, &gt;&gt; you cannot turn away the truth &gt;&gt; because that's what made us free. &gt;&gt; Who the son set free is freed thee. Oh God, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; I'm a part of the family of God. &gt;&gt; I saw this weekend in the camp when labors of church were destroyed. &gt;&gt; God took the labors off the churches &gt;&gt; and people came together in one spirit realizing glory to God that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I've seen it this weekend. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Can I start preaching? &gt;&gt; Let us stand together. &gt;&gt; We're going to read Colossians chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jim. &gt;&gt; Appreciate it. I appreciate you all. But there's something that God is just giving us in this end time. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the board is placed for a rightander, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But luckily, I am a left-hander. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I got to put it where I still that side and &gt;&gt; use use this. Yeah. This But must be able to persons must be able to see. Or you could put it I could go a little lower, right? the name, but there's some there that, you know, just want to I like I like teaching indeed, brothers. Yeah, that's good. Perfect. Amen. And yeah, let me see if I could stand here and not too close there. Can you see? Put it right here. &gt;&gt; Just go. That's right. I could stand here and do that. This perfect Then I move and then I can show you. That's right. Because I'm left-handed, so I got to put it on the other side, you know. &gt;&gt; It was okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's right. Thank you. So you not just adjust the size, but you adjust the height. You realize the height is important. What a vision. &gt;&gt; What a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. Thank you. Good. Colossians chapter um three and may the Lord just bless us. And as I said, everything is just in order as how God wanted. And um can I'm just going to read from verse one through to verse four. If you then be risen with Christ and look at the word if you know um brother Paul wrote this and you know for those who study a lot you realize Paul was ne I don't Paul never even put his feet in Colos &gt;&gt; never mostly docked in Ephesus because Ephesus was the main area he he has never even been in lysia and all these areas &gt;&gt; so he just dock there and send the letters to these believers. Right? He just learned of their conditions and the progress that were making. They were these were like small groups, but Ephesus was the main port that he traveled probably three times. However, he said, "If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above where Christ sitting." Can I say sit at sitting? On the right hand of God, &gt;&gt; right? And he said, "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For you are dead. Normally you would says you would put dead before resurrection. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Because for you to have for you to experience resurrection you have to die. &gt;&gt; But Paul turn it around. &gt;&gt; He turned it around. He says you are risen with Christ. That mean you experience a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Then he said actually you are dead. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You are dead. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it takes a resurrection to bring you into this death &gt;&gt; and your life is now hid &gt;&gt; with Christ in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore when Christ who is your life &gt;&gt; is our life. So you are not just you are not just Jared. You're supposed to be Christ. So God is not just looking for a Jared or a Osman or a Ruth &gt;&gt; when the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is &gt;&gt; is what? Fellowshipping with Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; outside that we're just projecting ourselves. &gt;&gt; So self has to die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when Christ who is our life shall appear, not come but appear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then shall we or you or ye also &gt;&gt; appear with him in glory. Not ever &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now remember we are being changed from what? Glory to glory. So our our transformation is in stages. &gt;&gt; That's right. And stages are phoned in seasons. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may God bless us to our heart. &gt;&gt; Bless the word to us father in Jesus name. Amen. You be seated. &gt;&gt; And so you know when you look at so we are dead verse three. So you are dead. And I'm going to say let's okay let's put a little thought to this. A title entering in our new life. entering into our new life. So we are dead means the word dead there means amen separated from this world because now remember the word of God when it speaks of the world it speaks of according depending on the context in which is used physical plant or planet earth or the entire human population but God loved this world God love his people you know that All right. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hell was not made for man. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it was made for the angels, Satan and the angels. That's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so the word also refer to the secular system that opposes God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or the temporal nature of hurt's life. &gt;&gt; Yes. So when he speaks of debt, it's referring to a separation from the secular system that opposes that which is of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or the temporary things of this earth &gt;&gt; that we have no desire for. &gt;&gt; He's a child of God. All right. &gt;&gt; So here you remember when Jesus was praying for his disciples there in John chapter 17 verse 14 and the uh when Jesus said father I'm not praying that you take them from out of this world &gt;&gt; which is planet earth &gt;&gt; but I want you to keep them from &gt;&gt; evil &gt;&gt; the evil of this world which is the secular systems &gt;&gt; that opposes God &gt;&gt; which can also be a religious spirit. right sir &gt;&gt; because the strongest demon you can ever find &gt;&gt; is a religious demon &gt;&gt; having a form of godliness and there is absolutely no power for transformation &gt;&gt; glory to god &gt;&gt; so not notice when we speaks of that disparation but the apostle Paul says now if you are risen with Christ so there is A resurrection takes place in our lives. &gt;&gt; That actually brought us into this separation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Which is our new life. &gt;&gt; Now, what brought forth this death? Glory to God. Is that we enter into a new life that is separated [Applause] &gt;&gt; from everything else outside of God. So this resurrection, glory to God, represents, Amen, a adoption. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand, we talk about seasons uh Wednesday night and we says it there had to be a Jordan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For for them to cross &gt;&gt; in order to enter the promised land. &gt;&gt; That's right. The promised son represents their adoption. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now remember, oh, glory to God. Adoption is, Amen. was the rightful promised land. &gt;&gt; They were there before. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You remember they were there before. &gt;&gt; And because of the famine, &gt;&gt; Amen. Jacob brought them over into Egypt. &gt;&gt; So, they were being restored. So adaption is actually restoration. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so what it takes Jordan represents glory to God death, burial, and resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; While the Red Sea represents baptism. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So they were baptized in the Red Sea &gt;&gt; under Moses administration. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But coming Joshua, &gt;&gt; glory to God. Who represents our end time leader. The prophet said that &gt;&gt; he said Caleb, amen, types, a true believer &gt;&gt; who stayed with Joshua &gt;&gt; and enter the promise. &gt;&gt; He said our end time leader. Oh, glory to God. Uh, it's our Joshua, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that bringing us into our adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our adoption is actually our restoration. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. &gt;&gt; It's the resurrection. Amen. that brought us into a new life. &gt;&gt; Into this new life. &gt;&gt; Oh, can I quote what the prophet says when he preached the message is the rising of the sun. He preached at the in April 1965 when he said when Christ Jesus was saying, Amen. Quote in John chapter 4. Glory to God. John chapter 14 when he says because I live you shall live also. &gt;&gt; He was speaking to his wife. &gt;&gt; The prophet echoed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said what a resurrection that was. &gt;&gt; He said what a resurrection this is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be resurrected in the new life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What brought this new life? It was the resurrection. &gt;&gt; They walked with Jesus for about 3 and 1/2 years &gt;&gt; and they never knew his fullness. &gt;&gt; But on that day when they saw him, &gt;&gt; Amen. Thomas says, "My Lord and my God." &gt;&gt; They saw his fullness. &gt;&gt; How did it happen? They saw him in the resurrected uh dimension &gt;&gt; and that brought them into their new life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What a resurrection this is. &gt;&gt; Bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; The Bible says your life is hid with Christ in God. &gt;&gt; Your life is hid with Christ. I have a marker here. &gt;&gt; You see it. It's not a mystery. &gt;&gt; It's not being hid. &gt;&gt; You can see it visually. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And by seeing it, you're understanding the purpose. &gt;&gt; But if I conceal it &gt;&gt; under this material, &gt;&gt; glory to God, now it's being hid. &gt;&gt; Once it's hid, now it becomes a mystery. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints? Amen. &gt;&gt; It now become a mystery. &gt;&gt; Can I say this from a true heart? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're hid with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. In God. God is your spirit. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the anointed that come from the eternal spirit. &gt;&gt; Now you are being hid. Now you this is when you become a mystery. &gt;&gt; That's right. Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hello saints. &gt;&gt; You are now a mystery. &gt;&gt; The world don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan knows who you are. &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he was already familiar with mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when he saw Jesus, he came with the word, if thou be the son of God, man these stones to be made bread. Because God hide himself in that flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God hid himself in that flesh. Amen. But when Jesus was walking among the tombs, the demons never said, "If you are the son of God," they said, "You are the son of God, you come to torment us before the time. Satan is not asking you today, the body of Christ. If you are the son of God, he knows who you are. He knows who you are. &gt;&gt; Your neighbor may not know because their minds are limited. &gt;&gt; Their visions are finite, but Satan knows. &gt;&gt; That is why he pressures you. &gt;&gt; Satan is on a raging war. He knows his time is near. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are his greatest enemy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You are his worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Your neighbors are God bless you, brother Junior. &gt;&gt; If he just knows &gt;&gt; what is he saying now, who is he saying that to? &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're hid. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In God. &gt;&gt; You are the anointed &gt;&gt; that's being hid. &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are the anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is hid. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's why. So when Christ &gt;&gt; when that anointing follow me closely. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, the sister will pull the scriptures up &gt;&gt; you are familiar with already. But when Christ who is &gt;&gt; our life &gt;&gt; now this is when you don't put Jesus over here and you here &gt;&gt; I tell person says I never go to church and ask Jesus to come. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I can't do that. &gt;&gt; My understanding is that Christ is in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I go to the food store is there. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When I come to church he's there. Hey. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; When I go to work, he's there. &gt;&gt; So when I'm in church, I ask the Lord, give us a fresh anointing today. &gt;&gt; May your purpose, &gt;&gt; come forth. &gt;&gt; We are here just to manifest his will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't say God come now. &gt;&gt; It's as if I don't know where he is. &gt;&gt; But because I know where he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I bring worship with me. I'm worship in the field. I worship in the kitchen. I worship at my workplace. I don't have to raise hand to worship. My soul is an indictment in a good matter. My soul has to be constantly in communication with him. Why? Because I have been entered into that new life with Christ. &gt;&gt; In God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you walk through those doors, &gt;&gt; God is not going to say, "Okay, Osman, see you next week." &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Come on. Bring it on. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; He's there. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Woo. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's always there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime I fall. &gt;&gt; Yes. But he's still there. &gt;&gt; He's there. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I make mistakes. &gt;&gt; He's still there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there is a positive. &gt;&gt; Always tugging on the negative. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are more than an overcomer. tugging on me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a positive there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, when Christ who is your life shall appear, &gt;&gt; in every age, dispensations are in ages. &gt;&gt; So, you got age, you have dispensations. &gt;&gt; You have seasons. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we are Oh, praise God. Okay, let me just jump into this a bit a bit. Okay. Okay. Let me just jump in here. Can you see it from there? And &gt;&gt; thank you. Come on, engine. Yeah. Just move it a little backward. Good. &gt;&gt; Everybody can see. &gt;&gt; Good. Good. &gt;&gt; Good. Now, so this is a perfect example. Moses, &gt;&gt; is that right? &gt;&gt; Moses. Now God never stopped the hedge from Moses. He started it long time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then from Moses to the promised land. &gt;&gt; All right. So we have Egypt. &gt;&gt; And when God sent his messenger, vindicated messenger with Mo Moses to lead the people out. When the people exit Egypt, that was when the ages start. So the age is not based upon Moses. It's based upon purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Purpose. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So there was a time. So within this &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Within this uh let's say h glory to God. There's a time when they had no law. &gt;&gt; They were just going alone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So in here you had they had to cross a red sea. &gt;&gt; So this the Red Sea after the Red Sea came over. Glory to God. What happened? Oh, there was a great revival. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Powerful revival. Miriam and the sisters took Timl and they were having church in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they were having church in the wilderness. Oh, it was so powerful. &gt;&gt; It was so anointing. But then there came a time, Amen, when God said, "Okay, Mo, the people, Amen, God said, Moses, you need to start a religion." Yes. &gt;&gt; Am I Am I on truck preachers? &gt;&gt; So here it was the law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ordinances and statutes. You know what that happened? You know what that was? That was another dispensation within the same age. &gt;&gt; Dispensation. &gt;&gt; See it was no more under what God says Moses and come up here. Let me show you things and tell the people. It was now read the law to the people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Then God Oh, there were Oh, can you imagine under such anointing miracle and all that the people backslid? &gt;&gt; They forget God. They forget the miracles of God. Show them. Oh, there was a time when God said, "Come here, Moses. Amen. My servant, come here, Joshua. My servant Moses is dead." &gt;&gt; Yes. dispensation. &gt;&gt; No, Joshua. &gt;&gt; Same age. &gt;&gt; It's not finished yet. &gt;&gt; So don't you pack up and say, "God, I'm here." No, you're not there. &gt;&gt; You're just under a different dispensation. &gt;&gt; Oh, church is over. I'm I'm in heaven. You got a problem. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; You're misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; Right. That's true. &gt;&gt; Dispensation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We cannot We cannot change H. &gt;&gt; No. Right. &gt;&gt; And show what we find many times. Oh, Joshua is here as our leader. There's a Jordan to cross. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a Jordan to cross. Now, the big difference. Amen. You know why? Because we are trying to see if we can bring back a rod. &gt;&gt; Stretch forth a rod across here. &gt;&gt; Oh, Joshua, we got a problem. Now, what's the problem? You don't have a rod, &gt;&gt; right? [Applause] This is what we used to. &gt;&gt; We used to this Moses. One time we were thirsty. Oh, you know what? Prophet Moses did. He struck the rock. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a revival it was. &gt;&gt; God said, "Moses, I'm going to change the dispensation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're going to speak to the rock next time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Moses failed. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did. &gt;&gt; To make the transition. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; He failed. &gt;&gt; Prophet Moses failed to make the transition. Oh yes, he did. &gt;&gt; So God of Joshua on the scene. Now Joshua never had a rod, but you know how the thing is it was different. &gt;&gt; Yes. different anointing. &gt;&gt; God said, Joshua, you're going to speak to the people, give them instructions. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, the beauty about this is that all these persons that left out under the anointing of Moses and rejoice him, God say, "Okay, I'm going to take you home." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can't. You're not going over. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying they were lost. &gt;&gt; No. I'm just saying then they will make the transition. &gt;&gt; Then they were translated. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here it was saying under Joshua, do you know that there was another a a different generation? The cross. &gt;&gt; A new generation. &gt;&gt; The cross under the anointing of the end time leader. &gt;&gt; Do you know the prophet says Moses commission was great? &gt;&gt; Badisha Joshua was greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Because he had to put them. Oh, this represents death. Oh, glory to God. Is that right? Death, burial, and resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. Right. &gt;&gt; To enter their adoption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. When they were under here, Amen. They never had to fend for themselves. They had all they had to do was cry tomorrow and God send down mana. God send them quail. We were so beautiful on the Moses. But under Joshua when they crossed Jordan, the Bible said the manor stopped falling. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Manners stop falling. Uh, amen. You got to start eating uh, Amen. the corn of the property. You start had to fend now for yourself. It's already in you. God is just bringing out what he already placing you &gt;&gt; under the anointing of a adoption series. Uh it's not God punishing you. It's not God pressuring you. He's just bringing out his attributes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. You are exactly where God want you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Woo. Somebody didn't hear that, did you? &gt;&gt; You are exactly where God want you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I should get more. Amen. In this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You should. You are exactly where God want you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Season. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. I'm I'm I'm showing you something here. We talk about glory. The glory &gt;&gt; under Moses was one glory. &gt;&gt; Under Joshua was another glory. &gt;&gt; When they enter the promise was a greater glory. &gt;&gt; Greater glory. &gt;&gt; So when we talk about God is changing us from glory to glory. Oh, we we think it's just &gt;&gt; it's just manmade system. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm standing up here in a tie and a and a shirt and &gt;&gt; that has nothing to do with righteousness. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it has nothing to do with my soul. &gt;&gt; So notice you're saying so we can be distracted &gt;&gt; over here trying to worship God &gt;&gt; right now. over here. &gt;&gt; He's a Oh, he's a same God. &gt;&gt; He's a Christ. &gt;&gt; If I'm here trying to now trying to worship the Lord that met Abraham &gt;&gt; in the valley of memory. &gt;&gt; Oh, I need God to come in flesh and do the same thing he did with Abraham. Probably he's doing greater, &gt;&gt; right? Yes. &gt;&gt; But I'm not seeing it. &gt;&gt; Because I'm trying to see if I can worship the God that was talking to &gt;&gt; Abraham. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's the same God. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; But when he appears, how he appears. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you identify the Christ? &gt;&gt; Have he appears? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God. You heard that? Can you identify the God, &gt;&gt; the same universal God as he appears? &gt;&gt; That's right. When how when Christ who is our life shall appear when you see him &gt;&gt; when you see him which not with his eyeballs &gt;&gt; but when you understand his appearing &gt;&gt; your worship change &gt;&gt; your attitude changes &gt;&gt; thank you Lord &gt;&gt; your approach changes &gt;&gt; that's why Jesus Jesus said to my sister at the well, he said, "If you just knew who I was, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; your approach would be different." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; If you knew who I was, you wouldn't approach me with racism. &gt;&gt; Right. There you go. &gt;&gt; Your approach would be different. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we enter this new, you know, the beauty about the new life is that there is absolutely no color. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's just the blood of Jesus. The beauty about the new life, God don't see pastors &gt;&gt; and church members. &gt;&gt; God is looking at Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is not looking at me big and you small. &gt;&gt; God is talking to sons and daughters. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, in this new life that we're entering, we're like children &gt;&gt; except you &gt;&gt; see the kingdom as a little child. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're not even entering. &gt;&gt; You never say heaven now. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; There is nowhere in the Bible God say you must work to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Stop it. &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the Bible God say you need to work yourself to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you came from there, that's where you're going back. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; God never even tell how many in the church believe in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God never tell us to have sleepless nights about going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can hardly eat because you want to go to rapture. You want to make the rapture. Lord, I cannot hardly sleep. I want to go in the rapture. You need to stop that thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. God never tell you to do that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So the season that we're in, &gt;&gt; we cannot deny it. A war. &gt;&gt; War. Everywhere is war. &gt;&gt; You can hardly look at a news now and there's no war. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; War. But we're not supposed to be frightened. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to look up. &gt;&gt; Amen. and lift our heads up. Two things God tell us to do. &gt;&gt; Look up. Lift up your heads. Two things. &gt;&gt; Why? Because your redemption is near. &gt;&gt; We looked at that Wednesday night. But then he says, "And they during that season, they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud. &gt;&gt; Not on the cloud, but come in a cloud." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He will be clothed in a cloud. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. But when he come, not because he's a mystery. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's coming in the cloud. He's wrapped in the cloud. &gt;&gt; He has to be unfold for you to know who he is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand when we see Christ Jesus in Revelation chapter 19 verse 11, the Bible say he had many crowns. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because he appeared in different seasons, &gt;&gt; different dispensations. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. One time he was a mighty angel &gt;&gt; wrestling with Jacob. Another time he was Adonai who met the parents of Samson. Another time he was this angel. Oh God is God. &gt;&gt; God don't need to ask us how to come. &gt;&gt; We just need to find him when he come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says in Luke 21:27, &gt;&gt; they shall see him, they who a generation that know during this season of spring, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They will see him coming in a cloud. &gt;&gt; They will understand this coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. will understand his coming. &gt;&gt; Who is he? &gt;&gt; Who is this man? Remember one time some guy some some Greeks came to see Jesus &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; send a message sir we want to say Jesus &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come out and say okay nice to meet you and &gt;&gt; no he he sent a parable to them &gt;&gt; he sent a parable to them &gt;&gt; except the sheep fall to the ground and die &gt;&gt; it abide alone &gt;&gt; what's that mystery That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Are we still there? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, what the Bible says in Luke, you put it up. &gt;&gt; What the Bible says in Luke chapter 21, look at this now. Oh, glory to God. This is interesting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 21:27. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And they shall see &gt;&gt; the son of man. coming in a cloud. &gt;&gt; Never before was this scripture make mention. &gt;&gt; The apostle Paul speaks of the coming of the Lord in three seasons.

Follow me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, John, &gt;&gt; shield up those things &gt;&gt; where the seven thunders uttered. Don't write them. Remember &gt;&gt; when John was being given the instructions &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 2 to3 &gt;&gt; the voice said John write these things. &gt;&gt; The next Revelation chapter 4:1 after these things John says &gt;&gt; glory to God a voice summon me come up &gt;&gt; hither. &gt;&gt; Revelation 4. Is that right? He said, "I'm going to show you not to write, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to show you the season changes. &gt;&gt; The age is the same.

He's God. He knows the beginning from the ending. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And John said, "I saw one sitting on the throne and a book in his hand. The proclamation went forth. No man was worthy. Not able to look upon the book, &gt;&gt; which means to manifest this attribute of God upon the earth." No man was worthy &gt;&gt; because we were all born in sin &gt;&gt; and shaped iniquity. But out of God came the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man, lamb man &gt;&gt; which was the same God himself put on flesh and come because God cannot die. &gt;&gt; God cannot die &gt;&gt; but he needed a body &gt;&gt; and show that body step from the throne &gt;&gt; and call the lamb of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And when that lamb came and the revelation chapter 6 &gt;&gt; to verse Revelation 8 show you when the lamb unfold all the seals. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But Revelation 8 verse 1, when he had opened the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; there was silence in heaven &gt;&gt; about the space of half an hour. &gt;&gt; Never before &gt;&gt; was silence in heaven. &gt;&gt; Revelation 4 tells you verse 11, they were worshiping. &gt;&gt; They were worshiping. &gt;&gt; Worship cannot stop. &gt;&gt; As long as Christ was up the throne, Worship has to continue. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God has to keep his word. &gt;&gt; For this cause, a man has to leave his father &gt;&gt; and his mother &gt;&gt; and cleave to his wife &gt;&gt; for them to become one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ had to step from that dimension. &gt;&gt; Because while he was on the throne, he was the eternal father. Right. &gt;&gt; But when he stepped from the throne. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He became in time. &gt;&gt; While he's on the throne, he's out of time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; W God almighty.
