Today is a really special day for me. Um 11 years ago I was baptized and today I really wanted to share that testimony and give God the glory but also to share a testimony that happened a couple weeks ago just to share how good God is and how perfect his plans are. So, two weeks ago after church, um we were going to pick up a few dump trucks for our boys and around 3 p.m. our neighbor was going to take our boys on a combine ride. And Jeff said, "You know, after we pick up those dump trucks, I really want to drop by in forest because there's a Canadian tire there and I need to return something and I want you to see the food land there because you've never been." And so we went to the lady's house and we ended up chatting with her for a while. So she um she separated from her husband and sold her house and she said, "You know what? I have a lot more I'm giving away because we're moving into the city." So she ended up blessing our boys with just some other outdoor toys. And she even gave me like a chicken feeder. So it was a blessing, but we took extra time. So when we looked at the time in the vehicle, we thought, "Okay, we should probably just head home." our neighbor will be waiting for the boys. And when we got home, I messaged our neighbor, but he never replied. So Jeff said, "Maybe he's, you know, he's busy, so let's just go to Forest and then come back." So this is just a testimony of God's time. &gt;&gt; When we went into uh town in Forest there, um I went into the food land by myself with Kazaya and Jeff said, "Remember, I'm in the vehicle with the boys basically like be quick and you know, we got to get going." He just wanted a bit of ice cream. So, as I went in the store and I'm just looking, you know, looking at the food land I've never been in before and I was like, I should probably just grab maybe a couple cans of tuna, a couple cans of tuna. So, I went down the tuna aisle and there was no one there. And all of a sudden, this gentleman comes by and he looks at Kazaya and he's like, "Wow, she's so beautiful." He's like, "I've always wanted to have a daughter. I have two young boys, but I've always heard about what happens when they're teenagers and whatnot. And and he's like, "You don't seem like you gave your parents trouble." He said to me. Um and anyway, shortly after I just shared about how we just moved to the area from Cambridge and we've been through some trials, but I said, "You know what? God's in control." And he goes, "You know what? I'd like to think I have faith." He's like, "I I lost my dad a week ago." He's like, "I'd like to think that he's up there and that I'll see him someday." But he didn't seem very sure. And so after that, you know, he saw the faith that I had and I ended up sharing my testimony a bit about how I was a Muslim and I came to know Christ. And he goes, "But aren't Muslims decent people? Don't they have a decent faith?" He goes, "A Muslim doctor actually helped my father to swallow again after he went through some trauma." And that doctor's name was Muhammad Muhammad. And you know, I said to him, you know what? I had the same question when I came to the faith of of Jesus. When I came to know Jesus, I had a question of is Allah Jesus but in a different name. So, I remember walking into a bookstore shortly after I got saved and there was a Christian owner and he said, "I need to show you something and I need you to come into this room." So, he opened the Quran, the Muslim book of faith, and he opened the Bible and he showed me two similar scriptures, similar but not quite the same. And he said, "Look, in the Quran, Allah had no begotten son." And he said, 'When you see here in the Bible, our God had a begotten son and that was Jesus Christ. And that there just answered my question. And I and I shared that with this gentleman and he goes, "Look, um and I told him about my parents and how they still accept us in their life." He goes, "I hope your mom lives a hundred years." But he goes, "When she passes, do you believe that she'll be up there with you?" And I said, "You know, my mom has done a lot of good for our family. So much more than I could put into words." And I so I I I believe on judgment day I'll be be able to speak for her. And I said, 'I'm still praying for her soul and her salvation though today uh on earth. And so he was just so moved by all of this. And a lady came up that was working at Foodland and just gave him a big hug. And he's like, "Thank you." I just actually went on a drive to clear my head. So God just had this perfect time of me being there to testify to this man. And later on when I was sharing this testimony with sister Julie and sister Lanne, I mentioned the name of that doctor and they go, "That was the same doctor that helped Steve to swallow the brother Steve that passed away a couple weeks ago." And sure enough, this was his son that I met in Foodland and had no idea that it was him because I've never met Steve. I've met never met his family. And here's his son. And like Pastor Dale has testified to his dad when he was sick and visited him when he was ill. And you know, I had no idea it was his son and there I am just openly testifying of my faith. So it was just so beautiful. And to hear the connection later on just made it even more beautiful. And here I am today to share my testimony of how God saved me. And a lot of people ask me, they're like, "How do you come from the Muslim faith to Christianity?" Like, "How do you just make that choice?" But it wasn't a choice of mine. You know, God chose me. &gt;&gt; And God showed me who I was. And he showed me that he was the truth. And that's how I was saved. I just knew that I knew. It's not wasn't a choice of mine. And I just knew he was the truth when he showed himself to me. So, I praise God for that. I really love the Lord and I I wrote my testimony in a poem. So I'd like to share that poem with you. Um I have shared this poem when we went to uh when we lived in Cambridge and we went to Pastor Jose's church. Um but I would love to share it today just in honor and glory of him. And um I pray it blesses you. You founded the world and knew me even before. You had a criate Muslim couple married in 1984. Fate sealed by a picture that fell on the floor. On April 5th, 1986, a baby girl, it was me that she bore. I find it so amazing that you always covered me. Before you even formed me in the belly, you knew me. And throughout my sickness when I was four, you healed and protected me through heaven's door. When I was a young girl, I prayed to a God that wasn't real. As I spoke, it was emptiness I would feel as the words left my mouth and in the dark they would fall. I wondered if I might as well be speaking to a wall. I would sing when the saints go marching in on a keyboard playing. I would have been the meaning I didn't quite yet know, but who I am in Christ, you would soon decide to show. Fast forward to my 22. You had my other half chosen for me to say I do. To meet me, he deviated from his walk with you. I smile when I think that all of this you already knew. We married before I knew you, but you knew my name. If we married in a church, my parents wouldn't have came. Little did we know then that you would mend a broken road through a vision that you would send. You showed me a vision of a man with a hat standing in between some pews. I said, "Jeff, I had a vision of this place, a church and a man, but I couldn't see his face." He said, "Maybe let's find a church then with God-fearing women and men." First to Alabama we would go, as my grandmother's memory is beginning to slow. To Alabama with our shepherd we went. Jesus decided it was us he sent to change our lives forever so that we would begin to honor and serve him together. On Saturday we arrived in the state as God had already prepared our beautiful fate. Uncle and Auntie McGregor was the name. They said we had turned we attend church on Sunday and we'd be happy if you came. With excitement in my eyes, I told Jeff my hope. His jaw nearly hit the floor as he could barely cope. Do you really want to go to church tomorrow? We might miss the flea market and there's no time. There's no more time we can borrow. Off to New Hope Revival we did go. During worship service, what to do? I did not know. I said, "God, please have your way." And a few songs in my discomfort he took away. How great thou art. How do I know this song and this part? I remember now I was asked to sing it from a book when my friend's grandmother's life God had took. Oh, I started to sing and I couldn't stop. Jesus, a hold of my heart he sure got from there. The many questions that occurred, God answered through Pastor Shel's words. I had never owned or held a Bible before. In a journal, I wrote everything down and wanted to know more. Soon, I would tell my mom the news, but she would not applaud. I would be giving my life to Jesus, the one and only true God. Just over a month after I was baptized in your name, all that mattered was you, not wealth or fame. It's amazing that you truly knew my name. After I was baptized, even the colors of the earth were not the same. As we think of your sacrifice on this 11th anniversary day, it overwhelms my heart to think of the price you had to pay for my burdens and sins. You died for tortured, mocked, and your clothes tore. Thank you, Jesus, for bearing the weight. We await your return, but do not know the date. We will serve you by serving those in need, shining your light and your love in every deed. Our God, we thank you for your love and grace. For you and your perfect will, we will gladly run this race. One day, when it's time, we pray, we will hear, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant in our ear. Until that day, let thy precious will be done. These battles we are facing, you have already overcome. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, our King, we will forever praise you and give you thanks in everything. Um before I go, I I um I have a couple of pictures I wanted to share of my baptism. Um the first picture actually I'll talk about here. This is how beautiful God is. Jeff's dad, brother Lauren, was in one of brother Brandham's services when he was two, and he remembers it actually very vividly. And Jeff's family ended up becoming really good friends with brother Perry Green. And many of you may know him, but his ministry was was sharing the miracles that God did through Brother Brham. And like God picked my husband who already, you know, had this beautiful foundation in this truth in the message. And they were friends with brother Green who was friends with brother Brandham and saw his the miracles that God did firsthand through him. And I just love it. I love that God is just beautiful in everything he does. So I wanted to share this picture. So that's brother green um with the with the glasses there on the on the left and um his arm is around brother Josh. So that's Jeff's second youngest brother. Um Joseph is around his left arm. Joseph is Jeff's youngest brother there. Jeff is behind um Joseph wearing the royal blue dress shirt there. Uh, brother Lauren has the royal blue tie. And, uh, behind brother Lauren is brother Justin. So, that's Jeff's second oldest brother. Uh, there's brother Green's wife beside sister Sheila. And brother John, Jeff's oldest brother, is with the dark sunglasses there. So, and then I have a couple of pictures of when I was baptized. So, I came to know the Lord October, sorry, September 14th, 2014. and I I knew I knew it was the truth and I was going to be baptized. So, I actually ended up being baptized on October 19th, 2014. October 19th is actually also my father's birthday. And I didn't at the time I was I didn't even think the dates were the same, but because I was just so excited to be baptized and come to know the Lord. But this is the day I was baptized. I was actually the first person to be baptized um in Pastor John Denqua's new church and it was just one of the best days of my life and I wanted to share that with you today and give God all the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen.

You know when you look and see what is happening in the world &gt;&gt; and see the amount of children that is gone missing. &gt;&gt; Saints the devil is at work. &gt;&gt; The devil is at work. &gt;&gt; You know the other day I was crying when I read the news and see so many children have gone missing. &gt;&gt; I have a son. You know I'm a parent &gt;&gt; and I love children. But you know the this world is evil. &gt;&gt; This world is evil. &gt;&gt; But I thank God that we have a God. &gt;&gt; And you know and God is working &gt;&gt; and God is working. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for the people in that are praying. &gt;&gt; We are prayer warriors. &gt;&gt; Saints, when you go down on your knees, put your children before God. &gt;&gt; Cover them under the blood. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, there are devils out there that are lurking. &gt;&gt; And you know, we stand upon the promise of God. &gt;&gt; And like Rahab did, he said he he said, "Not only me, but my entire household &gt;&gt; apply the blood upon our children." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Divine and righteous and eternal father, Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for today, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord God, for this day that you have given us, Lord.

If you have your Bibles with me, you can turn your Bibles to the book of First John, chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We just want to go according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. You know it's just two days ago I was praying asking the Lord what must I say to the people &gt;&gt; you know sometime you know to be honest I was kind of battling &gt;&gt; bottling for a thought you know and the Lord give me a simple thought &gt;&gt; and the thought is your victory. Listen to this saints. Your victory is manifest through your worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your victory is manifest through your worship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It may sound simple, &gt;&gt; but we're going to go into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1 John chapter 5. We're going to read a few verses and then we're going to turn over to St. John chapter 4. The Bible said in 1 John chapter 5, we're going to read from verse 4. For whatsoever, and that whatsoever can also mean whosoever, &gt;&gt; for whatsoever is born of God, hallelujah, overcometh the world, and the world mean cosmos. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can turn your Bibles to the book of St. John chapter 4 and then we're going to read a verse here and then you can be seated. St. John chap St. John chapter 4 verse 23 when Jesus was speaking to the woman at the well. Hallelujah. He said, "But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Hallelujah. The hour cometh. &gt;&gt; And now his &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; That the true worshipper. So the father is seeking the true worshippers. &gt;&gt; Yes. in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; For the father seeketh such to worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 24, God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; You can be seated as we ask the Lord to have his blessing to his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What an interesting day that we're living in. What an interesting time we're living in. &gt;&gt; What an interesting season we're living in. &gt;&gt; Saints of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see so many things that is happening. &gt;&gt; Our faith is being attacked day after day. And sometimes the devil will come in certain form for you to question your faith &gt;&gt; and even doubt in who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I thank God that we have a word today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a word today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the thought your victory is manifest through your worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're when we talk about the world, we're talking about the things of the world. &gt;&gt; We're talking about so many things are happening in the world today. &gt;&gt; But in St. John chapter 17, Jesus said, "I pray, Father, that you do not take them out of the world, but I pray that you may keep them from the evil of the world." &gt;&gt; There is a promise over your life. &gt;&gt; This world is filled with darkness. And even though it is filled with darkness, there is light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said in Egypt, the whole lot of Egypt was in darkness, but there was light in &gt;&gt; go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank God that we have a light today. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Hallelujah. That God has leave this hurt without a witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Hallelujah. that he has that he has sent his angels to be with his people &gt;&gt; in spite of everything that is happening. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And saints of God, how can we have a victory if we don't have a battles? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The battles has to come for you to get the victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. In order for you to have a testimony, you got to have an experience first. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to be tested. &gt;&gt; It's Hallelujah. It's in the will of God for you to be tested. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's in the will of God for you to fight some battles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And many times, oh glory, we look at our circumstances and we think that our victory lies in our strength. &gt;&gt; But our victory does not lies in our strength &gt;&gt; or in the amount of knowledge that you contain in your head. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can you can know the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; You can know the 1,200 odd messages from the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't guarantee you victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can quote the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, &gt;&gt; but that doesn't guarantee you victory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. You may be gifted with more than one gift of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about the gifts of the spirit in 1 Corinthians 12 from verse 4 come down to verse 9. &gt;&gt; And according to the Bible, persons can be given more than one gift. &gt;&gt; So you can be gifted, but that doesn't guarantee you victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And many times we place so much emphasis, Hallelujah. And gifts and gifts and gifts. &gt;&gt; And more than understanding of the word, &gt;&gt; glory to God. We must understand the word. By understanding the word, it will help you to place those gifts in the correct order. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophecy, the gifts must be in the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it takes understanding &gt;&gt; and we must come back to the understanding of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Here is a parable of the good swer, &gt;&gt; he that sweth the seed, and he that understand it." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul said, "He that lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God." Amen. &gt;&gt; According to the Bible, he said Gabriel who was sent from God to Daniel. Daniel was studying the books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the children of Israel was there in Babylon, &gt;&gt; and when the time of deliverance was getting closer, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; it was getting closer. But Daniel, something touched Daniel. He went back to the Bible. He went back to the book and started to pro I start to study the writings of Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when they start to study, Hallelujah. Glory to God. You realize that in the time of departure was getting closer. The prophet under the anointing of God, he said the time that Daniel was studying was the 60th year. Hallelujah. 2 years before the 70 years be accomplished at Babylon. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And the Bible said Daniel, he set his face and seek God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God sent the angel Gabriel to come to Daniel to give him skill and understanding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you understand God requires worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because worship is a package. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a package. The attribute of worship is respect. &gt;&gt; It is obedience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is holiness. &gt;&gt; It is submission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you understand all of that, it's a package. &gt;&gt; And God said, hallelujah. In the book of St. John chapter 4 he said now is when you shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When we talk about the doctrines the doctrine of the nicicoatans. Hallelujah. What are the what is the doctrine of it? When they take out the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when they take out the truth, it becomes the doctrine of the nic nicatians. &gt;&gt; But when the the spirit of God is in it and when the truth of God is in it, it's not a doctrine of Nicicoatians. It is a doctrine of the son of man. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. So here Jesus said to the woman at the well you said you worship hallelujah on the mountain. And the Jews the woman was telling Jesus and the Jews said Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship. Jesus said it is coming and now is. It is no longer in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen.

As brother Job said, "Though you slay me, yet will I trust." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The only one that you can apply to worship is your physical response. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It's not just an inward response but is also a physical response. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because our hearts and our bodies are closely connected.

If you ask somebody said what is the truth? They say some may say it is very hard to define. Glory to God. They would say that it's it's a collection of facts that has to do with real reality. &gt;&gt; You know, some person will use it as a scientific and said it has to be proven. &gt;&gt; For example, if you go outside and I ask you, tell me what color is the sky. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you look up in the sky, you may say it is blue. Hallelujah. That can be proven because I see the color. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But Jesus was moving them away from it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Thomas asks him, Jesus in first in John 14:E6, he said, "I am the way and the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, in order for you to know the truth, it has to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can you know that I am Jehovah Gyra? &gt;&gt; It has to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like it did to Abraham in Genesis 22 when Abraham said, "The Lord himself shall provide himself a sacrifice." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the truth now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what God does.

I can't sing the song anymore. &gt;&gt; Because every time I sing the song in church, I am being sick. &gt;&gt; He was afraid of singing the song. &gt;&gt; But I said, "Brother, God has not given us the spirit of bondage to fear." &gt;&gt; But he has given us the spirit of love. Hallelujah. And of power and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't be afraid of the devil. &gt;&gt; Give your testimony. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid that somebody might dislike your testimony. Don't look at them.
