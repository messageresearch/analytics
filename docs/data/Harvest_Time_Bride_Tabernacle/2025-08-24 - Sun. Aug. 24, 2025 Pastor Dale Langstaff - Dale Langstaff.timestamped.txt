[28:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[28:39] We're so excited to be dedicating our
[28:42] daughter Kaziah Isabella today.
[28:45] Um it's really true when you're going to
[28:48] be doing something for the Lord. Satan
[28:50] tries to discourage you or attack you
[28:52] and she hasn't been feeling the best the
[28:54] last couple days and I've had some
[28:56] health trials too. But we're going to be
[28:59] here and we're going to praise him
[29:00] anyway.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we're going to share his
[29:03] testimony because her story
[29:06] truly it was a testimony of the Lord
[29:08] before she was even conceived. And
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; I really love writing poetry. My mom
[29:14] wrote poetry and I just love writing
[29:17] poems. It's a very natural way that I
[29:20] express myself. And so I wrote her story
[29:24] and her testimony in a poem. And I would
[29:27] love to share that with you this
[29:28] morning. and all glory be to the Lord
[29:31] Jesus.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Kaziah Isabella Omillian, God had your
[29:39] story begin before the foundation of the
[29:42] world. He gave your earthly father a
[29:44] vision that around his hand your fingers
[29:46] would be curled. In the vision daddy was
[29:49] holding you, rivers of emotions running
[29:52] down his face. A dark gray shirt he was
[29:54] wearing. You were content and warm in
[29:57] his embrace. A month before we knew
[29:59] about you, I said in a month's time in
[30:02] faith, we'd see a positive test. In
[30:04] April, we found out we were expecting to
[30:06] have three children and a fourth on the
[30:08] way, we were blessed. We chose not to
[30:11] find out if you were a girl or a boy.
[30:13] Whatever the Lord Jesus had in his plan
[30:16] would surely give us the most joy.
[30:19] Closer to when you were due, they said
[30:21] the fluid was too high. They wanted to
[30:24] induce and take your birth into their
[30:26] own hands, but we had faith that God our
[30:28] needs would supply.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Weeks later, our midwife came into the
[30:32] room smiling. She said, "You don't have
[30:35] polyhydramnio anymore. Your fluid levels
[30:38] are completely normal. In my whole
[30:40] career, I've never seen this before."
[30:43] Our Lord Jesus performed a miracle, but
[30:45] in their books, 41 weeks was still too
[30:47] late. I prayed to have the birthday
[30:50] Jesus had planned for you as Jehovah
[30:52] Gyra always has the perfect time and
[30:54] date. Daddy also said no boys names were
[30:59] needed. He was sure a girl was next and
[31:02] God sure made him clever. We picked your
[31:04] name Kaziah Isabella which symbolizes a
[31:08] restored life pledged to God forever.
[31:11] Daddy came downstairs with a smirk on
[31:13] his face. He said the gray shirt he put
[31:15] on was from the vision. He told me, "You
[31:18] have 24 hours to have our baby." And how
[31:21] beautiful that his faith was speaking
[31:23] God's decision.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Within about 15 hours of that moment,
[31:27] God said it was time. How beautiful it
[31:30] is when a miracle occurs. That is
[31:32] incredibly divine. You arrived in 4
[31:35] hours and you were born in the veil.
[31:37] What a perfect type of the bride of
[31:39] Christ. He surely does never fail.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Daddy held you in the gray shirt just as
[31:44] God had shown him earlier that year.
[31:47] You are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; I pray that God you will always love and
[31:52] to him be near.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Every good and every perfect gift is
[31:56] from above. And nothing shall separate
[31:59] you from our God's love.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Children are inheritage of the Lord and
[32:04] the fruit of the womb is his reward.
[32:07] Thank you Lord for giving us Kaziah
[32:09] Isabella Omillion, a sweet and precious
[32:12] little girl. We will teach her your ways
[32:15] and your truth in her life and to follow
[32:17] you with every word, every step, and
[32:19] every little twirl.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's beautiful.
[32:28] Amen. Yeah. Brother Lori and Sister
[32:30] Sheila maybe can come and stand beside
[32:33] brother Jeff. And I I don't know if
[32:35] somebody's Yeah, you fig Yeah, pictures
[32:38] are Yeah. Amen. Vicki, we need somebody
[32:41] taking pictures or Amy or Tim or
[32:43] somebody.
[32:45] Julie, somebody got a camera. Amy does.
[32:49] Amen.
[32:54] Amen. Pictures are history.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pictures like history.
[33:02] Amen.
[33:05] Thank you, Jesus. You know, I have a
[33:07] little message for Jeff and DMA. You
[33:10] know,
[33:12] we believe that our children come from
[33:15] God.
[33:17] Amen. And we come out of the side of God
[33:20] and God had to trust us to send us your
[33:24] angel. If God wouldn't have trusted us,
[33:28] he wouldn't have gave us a part of him.
[33:31] And when he added us with children's, it
[33:33] was a double blessing because not only
[33:36] did he trust you enough, but he trusted
[33:38] you to to nurture and raise,
[33:42] take care of somebody that would raise
[33:45] up a child in the way you'll go, and
[33:47] when they're old, they won't depart from
[33:49] us. God has great confidence, great
[33:52] confidence in you both. Amen. God would
[33:54] have never blessed you if he didn't know
[33:57] the end from the beginning. Amen. It's
[33:59] great. Great confidence. Amen. Little
[34:03] Casiah, do you want to come to Bert
[34:05] Hill? Yes. You can look at your mama.
[34:09] Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we just come
[34:12] this morning. And Lord, we just love
[34:14] you. And Lord, we thank you for
[34:16] election. And Lord, we thank you for
[34:18] little Casiah here and the election that
[34:21] she came from you. And you you sent her
[34:23] the parents that were elected, Lord God.
[34:25] and and you trusted her parents so much
[34:28] that that you would send a beautiful
[34:30] angel that they could nurture and guide
[34:32] and protect, Lord God, until until she
[34:35] received her own Holy Ghost and and you
[34:38] would be able to take care of her in
[34:41] adulthood, Lord God. And Lord, we bless
[34:43] this little child, Lord God. and we give
[34:46] her back to you, Lord God, just as a a
[34:49] token of our love that we thank you for
[34:52] trusting us enough to raise her and love
[34:54] her and and Lord God, we bless you and
[34:57] we thank you for this blessing. Thank
[34:59] you for the children. Thank you for the
[35:01] whole family, Lord God. Lord God, and
[35:04] especially this morning, we thank you
[35:06] for this little daughter of God, little
[35:08] Casiah, Lord God. We pray you'll bless
[35:11] her and keep her pure and holy, Lord
[35:14] God. And may she be an amazing sister of
[35:18] your family, Lord God, we pray. And
[35:20] bless the mom and dad and the
[35:22] grandparents and the brother, Lord God,
[35:24] and all even the church, all that will
[35:26] guide and help them to nurture this
[35:29] family and this little girl. And we give
[35:32] you the glory and honor for it, Lord
[35:33] Jesus. And your beautiful name we pray.
[35:37] Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[35:43] God bless you.
[35:45] God bless you. God bless you. Which one
[35:48] of you boys want to help me preach?
[35:54] Amen. God bless you. Bless you.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:03] Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[36:06] You know, I remember the time when
[36:08] brother Jeff and Sister Damla were in
[36:11] this exact same church building and they
[36:14] were praying for kids.
[36:16] Amen.
[36:18] God is so wonderful. You know, God
[36:20] sometimes waits. We wonder why he's
[36:23] waiting for the right time.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; God's never late and he's never early.
[36:28] Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; And his time is right. I want to look in
[36:32] a scripture that we haven't read yet.
[36:34] Ephesians 5:15-21.
[36:36] Maybe you can turn there and we'll just
[36:39] lay a foundation of our thing. And you
[36:41] know when our message and you know when
[36:43] we minister this message and I'm going
[36:44] to try God kind of uh just you know
[36:49] talking to me and and you know in
[36:51] meditation and speaking you know anytime
[36:54] we minister a message it's not for
[36:56] everybody. Some people are already
[36:58] there. Some people are you know past
[37:00] that in life. Some people are past that
[37:02] spiritually in their life. And and you
[37:04] know, sometimes we have to be patient
[37:06] with the family because a part of the
[37:09] family might need something that
[37:10] somebody else don't need nothing to do
[37:12] with. Amen. And this message is going to
[37:14] be completely like that. If you're if
[37:16] you're a grandma or you're in a
[37:18] different state of life, maybe this
[37:19] message won't mean the same to you. But
[37:22] there's ones here that are right in the
[37:23] middle of their family or maybe about to
[37:26] start a family
[37:28] and it'll mean a lot to them. And and
[37:30] also, you know, well, you know, when a
[37:32] minister, if you you know, this the same
[37:34] line, but you know, if we're we're
[37:36] speaking against uh something that's
[37:38] wrong in in our lives, it's never
[37:41] everybody.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; It's just for whoever God intended it
[37:48] for.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; And so, we should never be offended. Not
[37:51] that we are, not that you are, but we
[37:53] should never be offended at the word of
[37:54] God. Lots of time when the minister's
[37:56] preaching, he's preaching to himself.
[38:00] cuz God's dealt with him in his own
[38:02] spiritual walk. God said, "You you
[38:04] aren't quite as far along as you think
[38:05] you are."
[38:07] &gt;&gt; And you need to preach this message to
[38:08] the people to change me.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's never intended to hurt or to
[38:14] to uh you know come across that way.
[38:17] Amen. But let's look in this scripture
[38:19] and and we want to talk about the family
[38:21] and we want to talk about the family
[38:23] environment. And I believe that God and
[38:24] and our prophet brother Bram has some
[38:27] amazing stuff here that we can learn. We
[38:30] see then that you walk circumspectly
[38:34] and not as fools. Now in this scripture,
[38:36] God's going to give us some counsel of
[38:40] how to live.
[38:42] He's saying walk circumspectly
[38:45] but not as fools.
[38:48] But you should be wise. Now the only the
[38:50] kind of wise he's talking about is wise
[38:52] in himself.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time before the days
[38:59] are evil. Therefore being not unwise but
[39:02] understanding that the will of the Lord
[39:04] is I I want to preach on but
[39:07] understanding what the will of the Lord
[39:09] is
[39:11] for a family. And you know if we have a
[39:13] you know in the nation if you have a
[39:15] healthy family you have a healthy
[39:16] nation. But definitely spiritually
[39:18] speaking, if we have a healthy family,
[39:20] we'll have a healthy family church cuz
[39:23] you bring all that health that that that
[39:26] wealth of health
[39:28] &gt;&gt; into the church.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Understanding
[39:32] what the will of the Lord is. Now, this
[39:34] scripture really the first part really
[39:37] doesn't affect us, but it just I have to
[39:39] read it to get the end. Be not drunk
[39:41] with wine, where is his access, but be
[39:45] filled with the spirit.
[39:47] We're supposed to be filled with the
[39:49] spirit. And and you know when we get
[39:50] into this part, we should live our life.
[39:53] This is in Ephesians and in Colossians
[39:55] both. We're going to read this. Speaking
[39:57] to yourself with psalms,
[40:00] hymns, spiritual songs, singing, making
[40:04] me in your heart unto the Lord. Now, you
[40:07] know, here here it's twice in the Bible
[40:10] and the New Testament. And I'm going to
[40:11] show you how important worship is to
[40:14] God. And even worship in your home.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; It changes the atmosphere. It
[40:21] &gt;&gt; does. That's right.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Making melodies in your heart to the
[40:29] Lord. Giving thanks
[40:31] always for all things unto God and the
[40:34] Father in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[40:36] Submitting yourself
[40:39] one to another in the fear of God.
[40:43] Now, that don't leave none of us out.
[40:47] A minister has to submit himself to God
[40:49] and the people and God's word. If a
[40:52] minister is only preaching his own
[40:54] thoughts and own ideas, oh, you better
[40:56] run for your life cuz it'll be distract.
[40:58] It'll be just disaster,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; cementing ourselves one to another in
[41:03] the fear of the Lord. And this verse 32,
[41:06] and this is a great mystery,
[41:10] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[41:12] church. Now here here it went into the
[41:14] wedding vows and couples and and all
[41:16] this about and I just skipped that
[41:20] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[41:22] church. Nevertheless, let every one of
[41:24] us in particular so love his wife even
[41:27] as himself and the wife to reverence
[41:31] her husband. Amen. You know the word of
[41:34] God is so beautiful and so perfect. And
[41:37] we see here, we already read our
[41:38] scripture in Psalms, how children are a
[41:41] heritage of the Lord. And I want to go
[41:42] to Colossians 3 12 and 21. Now, when God
[41:46] has something important to say, he
[41:48] repeats it.
[41:58] at verse 12.
[42:00] Put on therefore, this is only for a
[42:03] certain class of people as the elect of
[42:06] God.
[42:08] Now, he's narrowing in on who he's
[42:11] talking to. Holy and beloved, bows of
[42:14] mercy, kindness,
[42:17] humbleness of mind,
[42:19] meekness,
[42:21] and longsuffering.
[42:23] You know our prophet said that the only
[42:25] people that will have love in the end
[42:27] times is the elect.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; The elect.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody else will have love.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; The opposite of love is hatred.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Forbearing one another,
[42:45] forgiving one another. And if any man
[42:47] has a quarrel with any, even as Christ
[42:49] forgave you, also ye do forgive them.
[42:56] Above all these things, put on charity,
[42:58] for it which is abounds of perfectness,
[43:01] and let peace of God rule in your heart,
[43:03] which is also ye are called in one body
[43:07] to be ye thankful. But we are called to
[43:10] be one, but we're in two. We're called
[43:12] to be one body, but we're multiple
[43:14] bodies here. represented this morning.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And be ye thankful and let the word of
[43:22] Christ dwell in you richly in all
[43:25] wisdom, teaching and admonishing each
[43:29] one another. Oh, here we go again.
[43:34] In Psalms,
[43:37] wait, you already read that scripture,
[43:38] Brother Dale. This is a different
[43:40] scripture. and in hymns and in spiritual
[43:44] singing and songs of singing with grace
[43:50] with grace and your heart to the Lord
[43:53] and whatsoever you do do in word and
[43:55] deed do all in the name of Jesus giving
[43:58] thanks to God
[44:00] and the father by him
[44:03] and you know we can let's just uh
[44:07] drop to verse 18 and I'm just I'm laying
[44:10] a foundation showing how God expects the
[44:13] atmosphere
[44:15] to be in our home. You know, Brother
[44:18] Bam, and I'm going to read this. Brother
[44:19] Bam said, "We're we if we came from God,
[44:22] God was the only creator, but when we
[44:24] came from God, that makes us creators."
[44:26] And we create the atmosphere that you
[44:29] want to live in. He said, you know, and
[44:31] you know this, there's people that you
[44:32] just love being around
[44:35] &gt;&gt; and there's people you don't want you
[44:37] avoid.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And it's because of their atmosphere
[44:42] that they choose
[44:46] &gt;&gt; to create.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch this. In the Bible,
[44:52] hospitality
[44:54] is not natural.
[44:57] Hospitality
[45:00] is a gift.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; If you can make somebody feel welcome in
[45:05] a strange place, it's not natural. It's
[45:09] a gift.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God.
[45:14] Amen.
[45:16] Verse 18. Husbands, submit yourselves to
[45:18] your wives. Sorry. Submit yourselves to
[45:21] your husbands as it is fit in the Lord.
[45:23] And husbands, love your wives. and be
[45:25] not bitter against them. And children,
[45:27] verse 20, children, obey your parents in
[45:30] all things, for this is well pleasing
[45:33] in the Lord.
[45:36] Children, obey your parents. They've
[45:39] been farther down the road. They can see
[45:42] an accident coming.
[45:45] You should respect them enough
[45:48] to obey your parents. But he counteracts
[45:51] that. The very next verse, fathers,
[45:54] much of this message today, even when we
[45:57] go into the the the prophet will be to
[46:00] the fathers. Fathers, provoke not your
[46:03] children to anger
[46:07] unless they be discouraged.
[46:10] Amen.
[46:13] how we live our lives and correct our
[46:16] children and and every one of us, you
[46:18] know, had our children, some of us when
[46:21] we were younger,
[46:23] you're not a human if you didn't make
[46:24] mistakes, but you you can correct them.
[46:28] You're a Christian if you can say, "Hey,
[46:29] I made a mistake here, and from this day
[46:32] forward,
[46:34] I can live and do better." Amen.
[46:39] Ephesians 6 1:4.
[46:42] I'm just I'm just literally laying a
[46:44] foundation before I get into the
[46:46] atmosphere of a home. Children, obey
[46:48] your parents in the Lord, for this is
[46:50] right. Honor your father and mother,
[46:52] which this is the first commandment of
[46:55] promise. Now, I want to talk to the
[46:57] children for a second. And this goes
[46:59] with adult children, too. It doesn't
[47:01] mean your mom and dad are right all the
[47:03] time. It might not mean they're right
[47:06] ever, but you're still commanded
[47:10] &gt;&gt; to honor and respect them.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
[47:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word of
[47:17] God says.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; To honor somebody that you know can be
[47:22] dad wrong, you still honor and respect
[47:25] your parents. For this is the first
[47:28] commandment with promise, that your days
[47:29] may be long, that you may be well with
[47:31] thee, and thou may live long on the
[47:34] earth. And ye fathers, now see, we said
[47:37] something before. Anytime God's got
[47:39] something important,
[47:41] he repeats it.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; We already read this verse. No, this is
[47:47] a different verse. Fathers,
[47:51] provoke not your children to wrath. Now,
[47:55] God said that twice because fathers have
[47:58] a tendency to push your kids into wrath,
[48:04] &gt;&gt; anger,
[48:06] &gt;&gt; hopelessness.
[48:08] Amen.
[48:10] If that wasn't the case, you know, he
[48:12] never once mentioned that about mothers
[48:14] because mothers have the nurturing
[48:16] instinct and fathers have the
[48:21] command instinct.
[48:23] Yeah.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; So they think a father thinks that
[48:25] everything can be fixed by beating it.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; That's not the case.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; But bring them up in the nurture and
[48:39] admonition of the Lord. Now what was the
[48:41] nurture and admonition of the Lord?
[48:45] that you would wake up and sing hymns
[48:48] and songs and medalities
[48:52] &gt;&gt; unto the Lord giving praise
[48:59] for all things.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch here the prophet and I I
[49:04] want to before I read this quote this
[49:06] this just blessed me and this quote is
[49:09] what hurts our families and it hurts our
[49:12] church family and God forgive me for any
[49:16] mistakes I've ever made. But I want to
[49:19] tell you this. This is a quote from 59.
[49:22] And how plain the prophet is in this
[49:25] quote. If this was the case then
[49:28] it's a million times worse
[49:31] today.
[49:32] Like how many of you would agree that in
[49:35] 59 it was pretty tame? Like the world,
[49:38] the government, sin. I mean, like,
[49:45] &gt;&gt; 59,
[49:48] we were still having a major revival
[49:50] around most of the known world.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; In 59,
[49:56] watch what the prophet says. He said the
[49:57] experience of the juniper tree.
[50:00] You all know the story of the prophet
[50:02] Elijah though. He sat under the juniper
[50:04] tree and he said, "Lord, kill me.
[50:09] Life is too much for me." He said,
[50:12] "There's many of us that find oursel
[50:14] under the juniper tree and I get myself
[50:17] under there many times
[50:20] myself
[50:22] to the place that I don't even know what
[50:24] to do." You're so frustrated.
[50:28] And frankly,
[50:32] I hope you catch this.
[50:34] This is your prophet in 59.
[50:39] He was blunt honest.
[50:41] He said, "And frankly,
[50:47] I'm right under there
[50:49] right now.
[50:56] How could a man of God be so frustrated
[50:59] and so in turmoil and so tore up
[51:05] that he was sitting under a juniper tree
[51:08] and he said, "I'm wondering, oh God,
[51:11] what would you have me
[51:15] to do?"
[51:17] There's nobody alive that God didn't
[51:19] show more than our prophet
[51:21] &gt;&gt; and tell him what to do. There's nobody
[51:23] breathing that even comes close to that.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, many people are
[51:29] under the juniper tree, this the next
[51:30] paragraph, like Elijah,
[51:33] and they like to sleep.
[51:40] And I preach to more tired people than
[51:43] to anybody in the world.
[51:47] This is the prophet in 59.
[51:52] that did signs and wonders and prayer
[51:55] lines in almost every service.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine going to sleep
[52:02] when you seen like eyes that there was
[52:05] not even an eye socket and God cared
[52:08] about the color of the eye and limbs?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says it is. It's just not
[52:17] sleep. People are so tired they are
[52:20] mentally
[52:23] strained.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a news flash this
[52:28] morning.
[52:29] You are mentally strained
[52:35] &gt;&gt; and that's and I am more than mentally
[52:37] strained
[52:39] &gt;&gt; because our world is insane
[52:43] &gt;&gt; and there's so much pulling everywhere.
[52:48] Where is there not a war going on in the
[52:50] world or ships? Do you know the states
[52:52] just bombed some of China's land by the
[52:55] Philippines? Do you know the states is
[52:57] going to South America to take on
[52:58] another country there?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Did Did anybody know that? Do you know
[53:03] that China shot a missile at US, one of
[53:06] their dearest planes? They only have six
[53:08] in the world last week.
[53:12] You didn't know that.
[53:14] Mentally strained. The world is insane.
[53:18] It's an island that China claims and the
[53:20] Philippines claim and China has a base
[53:22] on it and the states oblivated it.
[53:28] We are mentally. Even if you never
[53:30] listen to the news,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; the tension in the grocery store
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; is like to snap.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know like half the people in
[53:43] Ontario or 30% are behind on their rent
[53:47] or their mortgage payments?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:51] You know, people are deciding on paying
[53:53] the car payment
[53:55] or buying food,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; mentally
[54:00] strained.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; It's an envir it's a world that we're
[54:04] living in. He said it's not just how he
[54:07] said people are so mentally strained
[54:09] until they're filling this is in 59. Can
[54:13] you insane institutions?
[54:18] I'll just tell you what.
[54:22] I wasn't born in 59 yet.
[54:26] I was born for nine more years.
[54:32] How in the world was this the case then?
[54:36] And see how drastic it is today. We're
[54:39] filling in stained institutions and
[54:42] hospitals
[54:44] everywhere.
[54:47] and they went to such a nervous
[54:49] condition until they don't know what
[54:52] they do believe or what they want and
[54:55] they're just laying there and they don't
[54:58] know what to do.
[55:00] And oh, it's such a sad sight. It's the
[55:04] pressure that's coming in on the elect.
[55:08] It's not your fault.
[55:10] It's not your fault. I God's just saying
[55:13] this is the environment of the world
[55:15] that we're building in the the by by
[55:19] what you know whatever you would the
[55:20] pressure of of making a living the
[55:24] pressure of raising your kids the
[55:26] pressure of of being uh godly and
[55:30] spiritual in a wicked world in a Sodom
[55:32] Gomorrah and and and I mean now I I
[55:36] respect we're all in different
[55:37] situations of this
[55:43] And the family
[55:45] is tore apart because the dad's trying
[55:48] to make a living. The mother's trying to
[55:51] teach the kids
[55:54] and there ain't no time for nobody.
[55:56] Human time is not even in the equation.
[56:03] You know,
[56:06] I was driving the tractor yesterday and
[56:09] right across the road from us,
[56:13] our neighbors died.
[56:15] And they've lived there our my whole
[56:18] life. They lived there when my dad
[56:20] bought the farm when I was 10. A matter
[56:23] of fact, she taught kindergarten when I
[56:25] was in grade two at East Sombra School.
[56:30] and T died July 1st, 93 years old. And
[56:34] she died 3 or 4 days ago, almost to the
[56:37] day, 6 weeks later. Both 93.
[56:42] And you know, I was remembering
[56:43] everything they did on that farm, you
[56:45] know, fix the tow drains, take out a
[56:47] tree, and all that.
[56:52] They were good people.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; They were Catholic, but they were good
[56:58] people.
[56:59] I remember our kids when they were young
[57:01] inviting them to church, inviting them
[57:03] and uh they said no, they said we have
[57:05] our own church that we go to.
[57:08] But I thinking I was thinking when I was
[57:10] on that I said you know anything they
[57:12] did on that farm
[57:15] don't matter one lick.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; It don't matter one lick.
[57:21] You know anything you do on this earth
[57:23] it don't matter one lick because their
[57:25] kids are are far apart. That farm's
[57:28] going to be sold and it don't matter if
[57:30] it brings 1 million, 2 million, or three
[57:32] million. The kids are just going to sell
[57:33] it and it's going to be sold.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with being a
[57:41] farmer and being in the country,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; but we can destroy our family building
[57:47] kingdoms.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Ministers have destroyed churches
[57:51] because they built kingdoms. Yeah,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; you can, you know, you can go anywhere
[57:56] with that. Schools have destroyed
[57:59] themselves because they made their
[58:00] school the model for the world.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; You know, we're
[58:08] we're here for such a short time.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And only what's done for Christ
[58:14] &gt;&gt; will last.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. And most of us the number
[58:19] one thing you unless you're a brother
[58:20] Brandham which there's not very many
[58:23] brother Brandhams around
[58:25] &gt;&gt; well there's no brother you know what
[58:27] I'm saying
[58:29] &gt;&gt; the biggest thing you'll do for Christ
[58:32] is your children
[58:35] &gt;&gt; your children
[58:36] &gt;&gt; and your grandchildren.
[58:38] If you're a minister and you're going
[58:41] around the world and your family serving
[58:43] the devil, you done lost your
[58:44] commission.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it couldn't happen. But
[58:50] if you can't save your next door
[58:51] neighbor, why would you save somebody in
[58:53] Ecuador? Yeah.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; If you can't influence the people that
[59:02] are your closest to you to to to be
[59:06] godly, then how are you going to
[59:07] influence people that don't even know
[59:08] you or seen you before?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And this neurotic,
[59:17] insane age, that's the pressure. You
[59:20] know, God has chose not for the rapture
[59:23] to happen yet.
[59:25] And the Bible promises us, we have a
[59:27] great hope that he will shorten the days
[59:31] or there would be no or it's possible,
[59:34] but it's not possible that no elect
[59:37] would be saved.
[59:40] You know, I've said multiple times I
[59:42] never believed we'd still be here to see
[59:43] what we're here seeing.
[59:46] I'm not I'm not saying but I'm saying in
[59:49] our world I'm not we can't change the
[59:52] world but you can change your world
[59:55] &gt;&gt; and you can't change the world but you
[59:56] can change every parent sitting here can
[59:59] change the world for your kids
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; and not only that it's your
[1:00:04] responsibility and you will be judged
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; on how you change the world for your
[1:00:10] kids because your kids can't do that.
[1:00:19] Amen. My very next scripture in my notes
[1:00:22] was Matthew 18 that we read already 10.
[1:00:25] Take heed that you despise not the
[1:00:27] little ones.
[1:00:29] For I say unto you that the angel
[1:00:34] is sitting before the throne of God
[1:00:37] and he let your heavenly father know
[1:00:39] every time
[1:00:41] you mistreat him.
[1:00:47] Ouch.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 3.
[1:01:01] I I want to read just some different
[1:01:03] scriptures here, but it's the end that I
[1:01:05] want to get to.
[1:01:07] Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to
[1:01:10] your husband, that if any obey not the
[1:01:12] word, that's if your husband did obey
[1:01:14] not the word, that they may be one that
[1:01:17] they may be without the word, one by
[1:01:20] your conversation of your wife. That
[1:01:22] means that if if a wife has a
[1:01:24] non-believing husband and the husband
[1:01:27] never asks the Lord for forgiveness
[1:01:31] that he can be saved by the wife and how
[1:01:35] she creates an atmosphere in the home.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Now let me just tell you something wives
[1:01:43] that's powerful.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean you can actually bypass the
[1:01:48] law of God for asking your husband for
[1:01:50] ask and forgiveness and you can dictate
[1:01:53] his eternal destination
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; by how you carry and speak.
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Remember the story of brother Bram the
[1:02:03] drunker that was in the bar and said
[1:02:05] there ain't no Christians left. And an
[1:02:08] amazing, you know, the husband that was
[1:02:11] there in the bar drinking, he knew his
[1:02:13] wife was real, although he wasn't living
[1:02:15] the life. And he said, "Well, I know one
[1:02:17] wife that's a Christian." They said,
[1:02:19] "Nope." They said, "They're all
[1:02:21] hypocrites. They all go to this church."
[1:02:23] And he said, "I know them all and
[1:02:25] they're no good for nothing." He said,
[1:02:27] "Well, I'll prove it to you. Let's go
[1:02:28] home." And he said, "Let's pretend we're
[1:02:29] real drunk. You know the story. She
[1:02:31] cooked his favorite meal, the only thing
[1:02:33] that was in the house, eggs, cuz they
[1:02:35] were cheap. He smashed them on the floor
[1:02:37] and made a huge mess. That husband
[1:02:39] needed a punch in the face.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; But that's not what the Bible says.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And she got down and they went outside
[1:02:49] and they said, "Now, now came the real
[1:02:51] test." And she got down cleaning up the
[1:02:53] mess that she had no business
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; on logical thinking to clean up. And she
[1:03:00] said, "Must Jesus bear the cross alone
[1:03:02] and all the world go free? For there's a
[1:03:04] cross for everyone to bear and there's a
[1:03:07] cross for me."
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; The husband outside said, "See, I told
[1:03:12] you she was real."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; See, I told you they was real. That's
[1:03:20] what the world's waiting for. See, I
[1:03:22] told you those people were real. They're
[1:03:24] kind of cuckoo, but I told you they're
[1:03:25] real.
[1:03:31] Wow. And while they behold your chase
[1:03:33] conversation coupled with fear. Verse
[1:03:36] four. But let the hidden man of the
[1:03:38] heart
[1:03:41] which is not corruptible, even the
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; ornament of the meek and quiet spirit
[1:03:49] which is in the sight of God. Great
[1:03:52] price. Our homes should be a haven. Your
[1:03:56] home for your kids is the only haven
[1:04:00] outside of church, but it's a main haven
[1:04:03] that they'll have in this world.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And it should be peace.
[1:04:10] There shouldn't There's no scriptures
[1:04:13] that you could have conflict of any kind
[1:04:16] in a home.
[1:04:18] Children are built for conflict.
[1:04:23] Let me say it again. Children are not
[1:04:24] built for conflict. Children cannot
[1:04:28] understand how mom and dad can be out of
[1:04:30] conflict.
[1:04:33] Children do not understand that the main
[1:04:35] purpose of the man is the head, but he's
[1:04:37] he's the bread winner and and he he's
[1:04:40] concerned that the bills are paid, but
[1:04:41] the wife is concerned that the
[1:04:43] environment and the nurturing and
[1:04:45] everything's nice. Yeah.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Great price is meek and qual spirit. God
[1:04:55] don't consider a bossy anybody special.
[1:05:01] But after the manner of the old time,
[1:05:03] the holy women also who trusted God
[1:05:05] adorned themselves being subject unto
[1:05:07] their own husband. And I took that
[1:05:09] scripture out. But it was Sarah that
[1:05:10] called Abraham her Lord. She worshiped
[1:05:13] her husband, called her her Lord. And
[1:05:16] verse seven, but likewise husbands, be
[1:05:18] ye husbands, dwell with them according
[1:05:21] to the knowledge, giving honor unto the
[1:05:23] wife,
[1:05:25] is unto the weaker vessel, being hes
[1:05:27] together
[1:05:30] of the grace of life, that your prayers
[1:05:33] may not be hindered. Now, I want to show
[1:05:35] you something. We're always trying to
[1:05:37] show the different roles
[1:05:39] of a man and a woman, and in the flesh,
[1:05:43] that's the truth.
[1:05:45] But in the spirit it's not the truth
[1:05:50] because here it says as being joint hes
[1:05:54] together
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; you can't what's the Bible say that the
[1:05:58] two the twain may be one
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; twain must be one you're you're you're
[1:06:05] heirs of the inheritance of God
[1:06:07] together. So husbands, you can be as
[1:06:10] spiritual as woohoo. You're making it
[1:06:14] without your wife.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Of the grace of life that your prayers
[1:06:24] may not be hindered. I wonder sometimes
[1:06:26] when our prayers aren't answered if it's
[1:06:30] because our hidden life
[1:06:34] is corrupt.
[1:06:36] Yeah.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; And you know what that corruption would
[1:06:38] be?
[1:06:40] Meanness.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Just plain meanness. Just plain rude.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It says meekness was of a great price.
[1:06:55] Humble and meekness. You know, brother
[1:06:58] Brown said that if you show me a church,
[1:07:00] and I'm going to say this with a family.
[1:07:01] If you show me a church that's humble,
[1:07:04] real humble, just really, really humble,
[1:07:08] I'll show you a church that's got the
[1:07:11] power and the presence of God in it.
[1:07:14] Let's just put that in the home. If you
[1:07:16] show me a home that's humble, that
[1:07:19] respect is there, and it's humble and
[1:07:22] humility and and and and you know what?
[1:07:25] When you get married, it's not like my
[1:07:27] business and my job and my career. And
[1:07:31] that's the problem with everything.
[1:07:33] There's no more my when you get married.
[1:07:35] It's ours. It's our career. It's our
[1:07:39] home. It's our bank account.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; It's our dreams.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; It's our plans.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; But in most homes, it's my plans.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Her home. My home.
[1:07:55] Yeah.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; But if we change that word of my to
[1:07:59] ours,
[1:08:01] that we're joined together in the
[1:08:03] inheritance of God,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; it'll change the atmosphere
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; in the home.
[1:08:11] I want to show you another thought that
[1:08:14] our prophet brought out
[1:08:17] and this is this is just a beautiful
[1:08:20] thought and it's a fairly long one but
[1:08:22] he finishes it on us brothers.
[1:08:27] Amen.
[1:08:29] Us brothers need to listen.
[1:08:35] You know that we're all creators because
[1:08:37] we're a part of God and you're a son of
[1:08:39] God. You're the offspring of God. a
[1:08:41] daughter of God. That's right. So,
[1:08:43] you're a creator.
[1:08:45] And he talks about, he said, "Do you
[1:08:47] ever see people you just love to be
[1:08:49] around because they create a nice
[1:08:52] atmosphere." And he said here the next
[1:08:54] verse he said now my wife he said we had
[1:08:58] people running in and out of the house
[1:09:01] because brother Brown was a called
[1:09:02] prophet and people came to get prayed
[1:09:04] for and God answered his prayer
[1:09:06] miraculously and and people were
[1:09:09] involved in the ministry of God in a
[1:09:11] tremendous way and he said I came home
[1:09:15] and people had been in and out of the
[1:09:16] house and and she couldn't even live her
[1:09:20] normal life as being a housewife.
[1:09:22] She couldn't take care of her kids. She
[1:09:24] was she was continually answering the
[1:09:26] doorbell. The kids hadn't been fed. You
[1:09:30] know, the table hadn't been wiped off.
[1:09:31] The house looked like a pig pen. And the
[1:09:33] kids felt and looked worse.
[1:09:37] And he said, "I came in the house
[1:09:41] and I I want to show you this something
[1:09:42] too, brothers." He puts all the onus
[1:09:46] on the mad.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:50] He said, 'I come in the kitchen and my
[1:09:52] wife was crying. The children were
[1:09:54] crying and not she never even had a
[1:09:57] chance to cook them all through the day.
[1:09:59] And the little kitties and the little
[1:10:01] girls there, Sarah and Rebecca, they
[1:10:02] were crying and they were going on. My
[1:10:04] wife's crying and Billy just I'm just
[1:10:08] I'm just going crazy.
[1:10:11] Well, I want to just tell you something.
[1:10:13] This is a this is a this is an old
[1:10:16] quote. This isn't in the 50s.
[1:10:19] Yes.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And this is the case where most of us in
[1:10:22] our home feel like we're going crazy to
[1:10:24] keep up with everything.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] I'm just going crazy and I just don't
[1:10:31] know what I'm going to do, she said. And
[1:10:34] here she was gayheaded at 34 years of
[1:10:37] age. And brother Bam said, "Oh, that's
[1:10:40] right. Well, you know that's right,
[1:10:42] honey." And he said, "I never I don't
[1:10:46] never ever fuss with her."
[1:10:52] Can you imagine saying in a home that
[1:10:54] the kids had never ever seen the husband
[1:10:58] and wife fuss?
[1:11:01] That that would be quite a home.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, parents,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; you can do your business of fussing
[1:11:10] outside of the kids' ears. Yeah.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; You can do it at 3:00 when you know
[1:11:19] they're sound asleep or take a drive.
[1:11:22] Your car won't be bugged.
[1:11:24] Your kids probably don't know how to do
[1:11:25] that yet.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; I don't never fuss with her. He said,
[1:11:32] "That's right, honey. It's very bad
[1:11:36] that you're serving all these people.
[1:11:38] You're serving. and we're serving the
[1:11:39] Lord
[1:11:41] and I'm doing all the time what's in my
[1:11:43] heart and I'm trying to create here's
[1:11:45] the brother Bram say I'm trying to
[1:11:47] create a different atmosphere and
[1:11:50] they're all nervous and they're all tore
[1:11:52] up and you know when God laid this on my
[1:11:55] heart for the family I thought you know
[1:11:57] that's the atmosphere in many homes I
[1:12:00] don't mean all homes but many homes on
[1:12:04] certain days
[1:12:06] maybe your home's perfect all month, but
[1:12:08] two or three days before the first of
[1:12:10] the month when you got to make the
[1:12:12] mortgage payment, the car payment, the
[1:12:13] rent payment, the hydro payment, the gas
[1:12:15] payment, and the and the visa payment,
[1:12:18] and then the and the other payment, the
[1:12:20] internet payment, and the
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; just ain't enough payment.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And inside the home becomes a nervous,
[1:12:32] tore up
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; atmosphere. I I want I want to give you
[1:12:36] a a a highlight. Your kids don't
[1:12:38] understand.
[1:12:41] The kids have no clue what you're tore
[1:12:43] up about.
[1:12:45] All the kids the kids could care less
[1:12:47] about the gas, the hydro, the water, the
[1:12:50] sewer bill, the the car payment, the
[1:12:51] house payment. That all they want is
[1:12:54] harmony.
[1:12:56] They want harmony in Christ. That's all
[1:12:58] they want. That's why. And you know, I
[1:13:01] was talking to a minister this week.
[1:13:02] That's why when you go to the the
[1:13:04] poorest places in the world there
[1:13:07] everybody sitting on their front porch
[1:13:09] if they have a front porch or they're
[1:13:11] sitting on the side of the road and
[1:13:12] they're just like
[1:13:17] they don't have nothing but they got
[1:13:19] something you can't buy with money.
[1:13:22] That's harmony.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They got harmony.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Now this is the prophet talk. Now I was
[1:13:30] thinking in my heart, oh Lord, now send
[1:13:32] your presence and send your love to my
[1:13:35] poor little tore up wife. Now I want to
[1:13:39] say, you know, your marriage might be
[1:13:41] perfect, but I doubt it was more perfect
[1:13:43] than the prophet's marriage.
[1:13:47] Now, if his wife could get tore up,
[1:13:50] I mean, I know he was a minister of God,
[1:13:52] but it wasn't no physical. He wasn't
[1:13:55] building a kingdom of himself.
[1:13:57] He was in complete obedience to the
[1:13:59] leading of the Holy Spirit.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; So even being under the leading of the
[1:14:05] Holy Spirit, you you you can be your
[1:14:07] family can be tore up. Moses was he
[1:14:11] forgot to do the law of God. His wife
[1:14:13] had to do it for him. She said, "You're
[1:14:15] a bloody husband to me and God would
[1:14:17] have killed him."
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; It was a wife that saved the husband's
[1:14:23] life.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, dear. That's right. Here's brother
[1:14:28] Brandham agreeing
[1:14:31] that they're all tore up. He said, "Yes,
[1:14:33] that's right. That's right. This here."
[1:14:35] He said, "I haven't got anything." She
[1:14:37] said, "I haven't got anything to eat."
[1:14:39] And I said, "Well, there probably won't
[1:14:42] be nobody coming around for a couple
[1:14:44] hours. Let's get something to eat and
[1:14:45] I'll help you." He said, I started
[1:14:47] rolling up my sleeves.
[1:14:50] Started rolling up my sleeves and
[1:14:51] Brother Bram was going to start cooking.
[1:14:53] Now, right here, I I want to change the
[1:14:56] message and I want to change to a
[1:14:57] different message
[1:15:00] and I'm going to come back to that
[1:15:02] thought here. Here, Brother Bram says,
[1:15:04] he said in my heart, the next paragraph,
[1:15:06] Vicki, it's right in line. He said,
[1:15:08] Lord, I'm giving my love of God into my
[1:15:13] wife. And now, Lord, if you'll help me
[1:15:16] now here, I want your spirit now.
[1:15:23] And his very next sentence was, "And
[1:15:24] Satan would get us all confused,
[1:15:28] but I want you to help me." And I say,
[1:15:31] "Now, dear, I'll help you wash the
[1:15:34] dishes." And I'll get out there and I'll
[1:15:36] say, "Now, you just start with the
[1:15:38] children like say something there." And
[1:15:41] I'm standing there all the time praying
[1:15:43] now. Lord, send your Holy Spirit. I know
[1:15:45] it's quickening them right now. And I'm
[1:15:49] sending it. Watch. Watch how the
[1:15:51] prophets praying. He said, "I'm sending
[1:15:53] it into this home,
[1:15:56] my home,
[1:15:59] in the name of your son,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus."
[1:16:05] Do you know how he was sending that
[1:16:06] presence into his home?
[1:16:10] By rolling up his sleeve and saying,
[1:16:12] "Honey,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; step aside.
[1:16:15] I can do the dishes.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Step aside.
[1:16:20] I can lighten your burden. Do
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; you know I told some families in Africa,
[1:16:24] you know, where the wives were, and I
[1:16:26] don't mean, sorry, I I shouldn't have
[1:16:27] said the country. Forgive me. Forgive
[1:16:29] me. It's not Africa. Say it anywhere.
[1:16:33] Where the wives are respected to do
[1:16:36] everything for the kids.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a news flash.
[1:16:40] That's disgusting.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; that's disgusting.
[1:16:47] They're not your wife's kids.
[1:16:49] Yeah.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know whose blood those kids are
[1:16:52] carrying?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Daddy's.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And you see some men that they go off
[1:17:01] and they're doing their own kingdom,
[1:17:03] doing nothing to be assistants.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And their wife is dying.
[1:17:12] Dying. Dying
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; under the burden.
[1:17:18] and responsibility of the kids. Guess
[1:17:19] who will be held accountable in the day
[1:17:21] of judgment?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Not your wife.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Not your wife at all.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. She has a spirit of nurturing. Yes.
[1:17:32] My wife changed most of the diapers. I
[1:17:35] changed every diaper
[1:17:38] that was completely necessary.
[1:17:44] Yeah.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But you know, when my wife had all the
[1:17:46] babies at home, we got a nanny. I did
[1:17:50] 100% of the laundry. I cooked half the
[1:17:54] meals.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; I knew what a broom was.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And some men married servants.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Slaves.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; And they and the wives never signed up
[1:18:09] for that. They signed up for fellowship.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:13] A wife's all about fellowship.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And and and and being together. They
[1:18:17] could care less if you have a big Most
[1:18:19] wives could care less how big your
[1:18:21] kingdom is. They want date night.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; They want relationship. Wives are about
[1:18:27] relationships. Men are about bank
[1:18:29] accounts.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Wives don't care about bank accounts.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; You know, in the places and many
[1:18:39] country, half the world does it. The
[1:18:40] wife sits separate from the men.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You can't show me one scripture for
[1:18:46] that.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And the whole purpose of that is so the
[1:18:51] wives take care of all the kids.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; That's slavery.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; I've been to a couple places in my life
[1:19:04] and I've never one time in my life seen
[1:19:07] kids sitting on man's side. No,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; not one time.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Your wife couldn't have a good attitude
[1:19:25] in that situation if she was a saint.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; because you've just put her through the
[1:19:33] pig pen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:19:38] Let's go back to our original quote. He
[1:19:40] said, "I started rolling up my sleeves
[1:19:42] and she said,"Now look at here, young
[1:19:45] man. You might be able to help me wash
[1:19:47] the dishes, but you can't cook."
[1:19:51] And I'd say, "Oh, who can't cook like
[1:19:54] this?" And Brother's joking with his
[1:19:57] wife. And he said, "You know, the first
[1:19:59] thing you know, I'd come over and I'd
[1:20:01] put my arm around her, hand on her, and
[1:20:04] she didn't know what I was doing yet.
[1:20:06] I'd say, "Bless your heart, honey. I'll
[1:20:09] tell you. I'll help you do this." And
[1:20:12] then lay down in my heart. And I'm
[1:20:14] saying, "Lord, send your peace to that
[1:20:17] woman. Send your peace that's in me into
[1:20:19] her now, Lord God. And quicken my family
[1:20:23] now. I'm your servant, Father.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Send them peace."
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; That's quite a difference. Yeah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And the first thing you know,
[1:20:39] she'd say, "Billy, you know, I had a
[1:20:40] minister that was here. I'm not going to
[1:20:42] name him, but he said, I was and and and
[1:20:46] I respect them to the highest degree,
[1:20:49] and I know used to." He said, "Dale, I
[1:20:53] was destroying my He told me in the
[1:20:55] past, I was destroying my family
[1:20:58] studying the word of God."
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:02] He said, "My wife would say, 'Wh are you
[1:21:04] coming to bed, honey?" I'll say, 'Well,
[1:21:06] I'm just finishing this. I I'll be up
[1:21:07] there soon. He said, "2 3 4:00 in the
[1:21:11] morning.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be in bed yet with her."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I was so consumed."
[1:21:20] He said, "My kids were becoming
[1:21:23] strangers to me."
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Sound like Moses.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Moses was doing a lot for God.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Sounds like doing God a service without
[1:21:36] it being his will.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; No matter how much God calls you to do,
[1:21:42] your first requirement is your wife and
[1:21:45] your family,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; your kids. It's the kids that pay the
[1:21:50] price.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the first thing she you know
[1:21:55] she'd say, "Billy, you know a certain
[1:21:57] thing." And they'd like this these black
[1:22:00] eyes of hers would start snapping again.
[1:22:02] He said, "You know?" He said, "Yep." And
[1:22:04] I'd look down and the babies, she'd be
[1:22:07] in there and she'd start playing with
[1:22:09] the blocks and playing together.
[1:22:12] And what was it? It was creating
[1:22:16] a different atmosphere.
[1:22:19] And this is what I mentioned at the
[1:22:21] beginning, brothers.
[1:22:25] Let me tell you brothers,
[1:22:28] the atmosphere is what does it.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right.
[1:22:36] Look, it's not the hen that hatches the
[1:22:38] egg.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; It's the atmosphere.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; It's not the Holy Ghost. I I just I'm
[1:22:49] going out on a limb here. It's not the
[1:22:51] Holy Ghost that'll save your kids. It's
[1:22:54] the atmosphere.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; It's the atmosphere
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost can work. Do you
[1:23:01] know nobody The reason that the the
[1:23:03] churches are going cold is the
[1:23:04] atmosphere. It's the families. It's the
[1:23:07] atmosph.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; It's got to be warm and moist and loving
[1:23:17] and friendly and nurturable and just pop
[1:23:20] pop pop.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You can't keep love life down of any
[1:23:25] kind.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And the right atmosphere. He said,
[1:23:28] "What's the egg? You could put it under
[1:23:30] a stove. You could put a puppy on it.
[1:23:34] And if that egg's warm, it'll hatch."
[1:23:36] It's not the chicken that hatches the
[1:23:38] egg. It's the atmosphere. Now, I got a
[1:23:42] question for you. Why did brother Brown
[1:23:44] say, "Brothers?"
[1:23:45] Let me tell you, brothers.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; It's the atmosphere.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You got your wife by taking her on date
[1:23:57] night and sending her flowers.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; When's the last time you did that?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] Yeah.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; He said the atmosphere. He said you can
[1:24:09] put it under anything. It's the
[1:24:10] atmosphere. He said what we need
[1:24:13] is a Holy Ghost atmosphere. He said
[1:24:15] that's right. The atmosphere where the
[1:24:17] power of God is moving are separate
[1:24:20] ways. No. No. He didn't say that. in one
[1:24:23] accord, in one place together, under one
[1:24:28] atmosphere,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; expecting God to move down
[1:24:33] and put your family in harmony. That'll
[1:24:36] be the greatest sign and wonder you may
[1:24:38] ever see.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; You know, everybody wants to see signs
[1:24:41] and wonder, but their household is in
[1:24:43] turmoil.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; You can forget about the signs and
[1:24:46] wonders when your household is in
[1:24:48] turmoil.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam said, "If you want to
[1:24:50] see signs and wonders, become one.
[1:24:53] Become a miracle."
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; You want to see miracles, become a
[1:24:57] miracle.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders. I got another news
[1:25:03] flash for you. And you know, we get to
[1:25:07] talk to different people around the
[1:25:09] world as a minister. Sometimes people
[1:25:12] even ask us questions.
[1:25:15] And I had a brother ask me about
[1:25:18] involving their wife in their decisions
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; that you make around your home.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And I I'm just going to let you know
[1:25:28] whatever you do is f it won't matter to
[1:25:30] me. You don't even have to tell me.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; But I want to just tell you something.
[1:25:35] Every decision that I made regarding
[1:25:39] money for God,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; that my wife wasn't in favor of.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; She was right.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; She I mean she was dead right. Yeah.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And those two decisions totaled about
[1:26:04] 65,000 60 67,000 actually.
[1:26:09] And it was 100% for God. 100%.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; 100% for God.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And it was to godly people, elected
[1:26:21] godly people. Leanne said, "I'm not
[1:26:23] comfortable with this." and I pushed
[1:26:25] through it
[1:26:27] and I regretted it. Matter of fact, I'm
[1:26:30] regretting it today.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Your wife
[1:26:37] has a point of view that you will never
[1:26:39] see.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Your wife is not a doormat.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; God gave her wisdom and a brain.
[1:26:51] And if you're not asking your wife if
[1:26:53] you feel comfortable with this,
[1:26:55] plan on some God God has a way of
[1:26:58] bringing the knocks home.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; You know, before we even and this is
[1:27:04] this is going way out, you know, before
[1:27:06] we even came into the message and this
[1:27:09] was we were young. We had no kids
[1:27:13] and we watched,
[1:27:15] you know, I'm very young, 21, 22.
[1:27:19] And we watched some business people with
[1:27:22] Christian
[1:27:25] laws with Christian ethics
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; and they were in the business of real
[1:27:30] estate and they would go in and buy
[1:27:33] strip malls and they were in it was
[1:27:36] brotherhood so they weren't unequally
[1:27:37] yolked together and there was three or
[1:27:39] four brothers and their wives and every
[1:27:41] brother would go home and ask his wife
[1:27:45] said what do you feel honey
[1:27:48] do you feel anything.
[1:27:51] And he said, "We learned really fast
[1:27:53] that if our one wife out of the three or
[1:27:56] four that were in the partnership come
[1:27:59] back and said, "I don't feel right about
[1:28:00] this."
[1:28:02] He said, "When we did it, we normally
[1:28:04] lost it."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I meant the bank took it from him
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; because it was a bad decision. See, what
[1:28:18] did the Bible say? The Bible said that
[1:28:20] we may inherit
[1:28:23] together.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; It's an inheritance
[1:28:27] together.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; You're not You're not the I I know that
[1:28:34] somebody has to be okay. I I really feel
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; at the end somebody does have to make a
[1:28:40] decision,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; but if you step on your wife's decision,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; it might be okay.
[1:28:49] But be prepared.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Wow. It's the atmosphere. He said, "What
[1:29:01] we need is a Holy Ghost filled
[1:29:02] atmosphere, an absence here of the power
[1:29:04] of God moving in one accord in one home,
[1:29:08] gathered together under one atmosphere,
[1:29:10] expecting God to rise kids
[1:29:14] in that atmosphere." here. Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Watch this. In Proverbs, and we're
[1:29:19] coming to a close. Proverbs 22:6.
[1:29:22] Train up a child in the way he shall go.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And when he is old,
[1:29:29] he won't want to depart from it.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; That'll be all based on
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere. Yeah.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; You know, there's an old proverb, and
[1:29:44] this is my last scripture that I'm
[1:29:46] closing with. I I hope this, you know, I
[1:29:49] I I pray to God you'll get what God's
[1:29:52] trying to say this morning. Our homes
[1:29:54] are the safe haven
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; and nobody's exempt.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Like a news flash, even you men need a
[1:30:04] safe haven.
[1:30:05] Yeah.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; You need to have a a home haven where
[1:30:09] you can come down and you can let your
[1:30:12] guard down
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and you won't be attacked.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Your wife needs to be able to be honest
[1:30:18] with you
[1:30:20] and you won't attack her.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And your kids,
[1:30:25] even though they run into your truck,
[1:30:27] should come in and say, "Dad, I just
[1:30:29] drove the lawnmower right into the
[1:30:30] second door." and you just say, "Well,
[1:30:34] somebody had to do it."
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; What good would it be to do anything
[1:30:44] different?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; The door's already smashed.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; You know, everything can be replaced
[1:30:54] but souls.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:58] An offended soul is harder to win back
[1:31:00] than a walled city.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Souls.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible has or the the world has a
[1:31:11] proverbs. You get more flies with honey
[1:31:15] than vinegar.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; And that's true in our homes and in our
[1:31:20] families.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; But the Bible has the exact same
[1:31:23] proverb. Did you know that
[1:31:27] it says, "If your enemies are hungry,
[1:31:31] give them bread to eat. And if they're
[1:31:33] thirsty, give them water to eat. For
[1:31:36] thou shalt heat coals of fire
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; upon their heads, that the Lord shall
[1:31:44] reward
[1:31:45] thee." Yeah.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; The north wind driveth away the rain. So
[1:31:55] does an angry countenance
[1:31:58] and a backbiting tongue.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; The north wind driveth away the rain. So
[1:32:10] doth an angry countenance
[1:32:14] and a backbiting tongue. You know the
[1:32:18] Bible says that a a soft response
[1:32:22] to an anger
[1:32:24] settle the problem.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] Amen. We we need to we need to and in
[1:32:32] this day and it's it's nobody's fault.
[1:32:35] It's nobody's fault. But we're living in
[1:32:37] a world
[1:32:39] of people's rights.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; It's it's just it's just a spirit and
[1:32:44] you are not going to change that. It's
[1:32:47] here to stay.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; But what we need to live in under a
[1:32:51] spirit is of unity for each other
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and it'll start in the home. If you get
[1:32:58] your family happy and harmonized and you
[1:33:03] come to church in that spirit, there'll
[1:33:05] be no problems in the church. There'll
[1:33:07] be absolutely no problems. It's not
[1:33:09] possible.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; But when the home and the tension and
[1:33:15] listen, it's going to get the sad I I'm
[1:33:19] trying to leave you on a high note, but
[1:33:20] it's only going to get worse. Yeah.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And so it really will separate who our
[1:33:30] God is.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Because if you struggle with not having
[1:33:34] enough money to go around,
[1:33:37] um I don't know how to break this news
[1:33:39] to you,
[1:33:42] but it's probably not going to change.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; It actually probably only going to get
[1:33:49] worse. Yeah.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So you have to learn to Paul Paul said
[1:33:55] in the Bible he said whichsoever state
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I therewith find myself
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; I've learned
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; that's a decision
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; I've learned
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; therewith
[1:34:11] to be content.
[1:34:16] Do you know some of the laws that are
[1:34:18] coming down our own country is
[1:34:21] is digital money by 30 that in nine
[1:34:25] years digital money in 9 years or less.
[1:34:27] No commit no all electric cars in nine
[1:34:30] years or less. And that might be perfect
[1:34:32] but it's going to be different.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; It'll be different.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; It'll be different.
[1:34:41] And and I'm I'm just I'm just trying to
[1:34:44] say this world's my home.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I I'm not I'm not building my
[1:34:49] relationship with my wife or my kids or
[1:34:52] my family on how many farms I own
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; cuz they might all be gone tomorrow.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Or how much you have in the bank account
[1:34:59] because they're not yours.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; If they're not the Lord's, they're the
[1:35:04] governments.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; You get the choice. I gave mine to the
[1:35:09] Lord's. The government can't take his.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; But you're holding
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; back from the Lord. Well, the government
[1:35:15] already owns that.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Environment.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I've learned, Paul said,
[1:35:27] I've learned in whichever state I find
[1:35:29] myself,
[1:35:30] that's okay.
[1:35:32] See, kids don't recognize that the bills
[1:35:36] are due the first of the month. Neither
[1:35:39] should they.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; But they feel the pressure
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; because of it.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; That's not godly.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; That's That's wrong. Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God God help me. God help me.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. To unify the family. And and
[1:36:05] listen, when when God's just building us
[1:36:08] without character, character is all
[1:36:10] we're taking. And so, we're going to
[1:36:13] have little bumps in the road cuz God's
[1:36:14] seeing what you're going to do in
[1:36:16] response. It's a it's a response to an
[1:36:19] action. Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; And we need to learn that everything is
[1:36:26] elected and predestinated. God's already
[1:36:29] watched the video.
[1:36:32] And you know it's like there's a great
[1:36:34] proverb like this. He says you know
[1:36:36] don't worry about tomorrow. The Bible
[1:36:38] says physician is uh sufficient is the
[1:36:41] sorrows of today.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; But you but but you can even go farther
[1:36:45] than that. Don't worry about tomorrow.
[1:36:47] God's already there.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; God's already there. You just take care
[1:36:54] of what's right in front of you right
[1:36:56] now.
[1:36:59] That's right.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And then our we won't have
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; this is what
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; happen and and I'm I'm trying to close.
[1:37:09] This is what'll happen if we do that. We
[1:37:11] will get rid of the unexpected
[1:37:15] uh pressure on each other.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought you were going to be
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; I thought you were going to do
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; I thought it would be like
[1:37:27] this. Yeah.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; And you're disappointed because you had
[1:37:31] a dreamland
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; that is not reality.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, in this world,
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; you know, the Bible says you can't
[1:37:44] comprehend what God has in store for you
[1:37:47] in heaven for those that love him. Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we can experience heaven
[1:37:55] here.
[1:37:57] You're looking at me funny.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I can prove that in the Bible.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; It's a choice. Brother Brown said, "You
[1:38:03] don't have to wait till the millennium
[1:38:06] to live in victory.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You can live in it here.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; It's your choice.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; You want your millennium here, you just
[1:38:15] let go. Let go and let God have his
[1:38:18] way." Amen. Let's stand.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I I pray. I pray
[1:38:27] there is some key points there. God's
[1:38:30] looking out for all of us and especially
[1:38:33] the little ones.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Remember this fathers and mothers,
[1:38:41] their angel,
[1:38:43] that's their theophony body is in heaven
[1:38:46] before the throne. And when you touch
[1:38:49] them
[1:38:53] in an improper way, God knows
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; you remember the story of brother Bram
[1:39:03] and his wife and she was upset with him
[1:39:06] and she just slammed the door.
[1:39:09] She had a right to slam the door
[1:39:11] actually because she was he was gone so
[1:39:15] much and she was running everything in
[1:39:17] the turmoil.
[1:39:20] But it displeased God because it made
[1:39:23] him separate and God gave her cancer
[1:39:26] until his prophet healed him. So the God
[1:39:28] healed the from the word of the prophet.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] Watch what the prophet said. We never
[1:39:36] fuss. Nobody should ever see a fuss.
[1:39:41] You might have them, but it's in
[1:39:43] private.
[1:39:46] Amen.
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Help us, Jesus. You know, we'll change
[1:39:51] our homes and our kids won't leave the
[1:39:53] church.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; We'll change our homes and our kids will
[1:39:58] like to be around us.
[1:40:01] It's
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; your choice.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Your choice completely. Amen. Let's pull
[1:40:07] this song up, Vicki.
