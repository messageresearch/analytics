[18:31] God

[18:35] amen you know you know in the message
[18:37] just just just a quick comment here we
[18:41] all believe in predestination and
[18:42] elections
[18:43] but our Prophet taught us
[18:46] that if you teach that wrong
[18:49] it's disgrace
[18:53] amen First Corinthians 11
[18:57] First Corinthians 11 8 and 9.
[19:02] First Corinthians 11 8 and 9.
[19:05] for man is not made of the woman but the
[19:09] woman
[19:10] of the man
[19:13] neither was Man created
[19:16] for the woman
[19:19] but the woman
[19:20] was created for the man Lord Jesus we
[19:24] ask you to bless your word you know the
[19:27] anointing and the and the inspiration
[19:29] that you gave this to me Lord Jesus made
[19:32] my only prayer would be that the people
[19:35] could catch
[19:37] how you fed it to me Lord Jesus
[19:40] and we'll sure praise you for it in your
[19:42] name amen amen God bless you you may
[19:46] have your seats just just a make some
[19:48] announcements before we start you can
[19:50] leave that scripture up just uh do
[19:52] really welcome and love you and and I I
[19:55] just want to say a big thank you to all
[19:57] that went and supported the meetings and
[20:00] it was a real blessing I mean of course
[20:03] we enjoy our home fellowship but God
[20:07] made us to fellowship with one another
[20:10] amen and there will be more in heaven
[20:12] than our church
[20:13] and we might as well get used to it once
[20:16] in a while
[20:17] on Earth I want to read you a quote
[20:21] that the prophet said
[20:23] about joint Fellowship
[20:25] he said and I pray that these ministers
[20:27] Lord that cooperated in this meeting
[20:30] that each of their churches will be
[20:32] benefited with such a great spiritual
[20:35] and
[20:36] material benefits because of their stand
[20:39] and to bring their people and the gospel
[20:43] in every true fashion
[20:45] that they know it's being preached in
[20:47] and I pray father that they will bless
[20:50] them and may their people be
[20:53] a priest appreciate them knowing that
[20:57] they are doing it for their sake and for
[21:00] the gospel sake and that they may in
[21:02] return help and put their shoulder to
[21:05] the wheel and to push the cause that
[21:07] we're trying to bring forth on the Earth
[21:10] in the name of Jesus Christ
[21:13] amen that's a 64 quote
[21:15] that the prophet said
[21:18] about fellowship churches that it came
[21:20] together amen John DayQuil tell me when
[21:24] he was Thanking us amen for being there
[21:27] amen and it does uh I'm not saying every
[21:31] time I would close our doors I don't
[21:33] think on Sunday we'll close our doors
[21:35] very many times but
[21:38] God would just trust his leading and
[21:40] also also before I start preaching I
[21:43] want to apologize for him for the meal
[21:47] uh that meal wasn't uh
[21:51] because of of uh on coordination the way
[21:54] it worked out the person they hired to
[21:57] the meal had cooked the chicken early
[22:00] and when the sisters seen them bring the
[22:02] meal in he called it stale
[22:05] but the sisters called it slimy
[22:08] and if anybody knows thank you sister
[22:10] Patty my wife said when you sleep
[22:12] Siamese chicken that's salamina
[22:13] poisoning
[22:15] and the sisters rejected the meal when
[22:18] it arrived Sunday that we would have
[22:20] been eating and probably got sick
[22:23] and so John dankwa
[22:26] had a
[22:31] apologize
[22:33] because
[22:36] um
[22:37] sorry because he had missed every one of
[22:40] of the church being there and leaving
[22:43] because he had actually went out and
[22:45] different ones of the note and bought
[22:47] all the barbecue chicken at all the
[22:49] grocery stores that were already
[22:51] pre-cooked and brought them back and ate
[22:53] them and like in the store he went
[22:55] through he bought 21 tickets
[22:57] pretty good so that was the story of the
[22:59] meal so it wasn't uh
[23:03] playing catastrophe it just worked out
[23:06] that way amen
[23:09] amen and so we we uh just thank God for
[23:13] all things also I just and I'm sorry for
[23:17] so many announcements but also we have
[23:19] many mothers with small kids and I just
[23:22] remind you again the small kids do not
[23:26] bother me a minister
[23:28] and if they bother you you need the Holy
[23:31] Ghost
[23:32] literally if you're in the church and
[23:34] the small small children I'm seeing
[23:36] small children bother you you need the
[23:38] Holy Ghost because you're sidetracked
[23:39] very easily
[23:41] and mothers don't have to be pressured
[23:43] because their kids are alive and
[23:45] breathing and moving
[23:47] if they weren't we'd have to lay hands
[23:49] on them
[23:50] so don't let that bother you
[23:52] amen kids under a small age
[23:56] are still human amen
[23:59] amen I want to preach a message today
[24:01] and I believe I really believe that God
[24:03] had given this to me and and you know
[24:05] because we're in the message and and we
[24:08] know and understand predestination and
[24:10] election and it's preached very many
[24:12] many many times and and and of course it
[24:15] takes away all the fear to a holy
[24:17] ghost-filled believer but I want to show
[24:19] you many examples and how the prophet
[24:21] brought it and and also I'm going to use
[24:25] typologie from the natural and so when
[24:28] I'm talking about a woman and a man I'm
[24:30] not talking about in your flesh I'm just
[24:32] comparing us to Christ
[24:34] it's completely us to Christ amen and
[24:38] but the prophet taped everything in the
[24:40] in the natural and you know there's
[24:42] there's almost everything in the natural
[24:43] types of spiritual but you know there's
[24:46] one type in the natural that uh that it
[24:49] it's a lot different in the spiritual
[24:51] and that is if you're a married sister
[24:54] in the
[24:55] in the natural
[24:57] many times uh if you uh have a human for
[25:03] a husband
[25:05] the wife gets blamed for everything
[25:08] amen if the husband comes home the house
[25:10] is dirty it's her fault if the kids are
[25:12] noisy well that's her fault too
[25:15] and you know if food's cold it's her
[25:18] fault and if the clothes aren't washed
[25:20] that's her fault too and and you know
[25:23] it's probably her fault of the house
[25:24] leaks
[25:26] you know what I mean it's her fault if
[25:28] she didn't pay the bills and it's her
[25:29] fault if she paid the bills and the bank
[25:30] account's empty
[25:32] but it's not that way with the bride of
[25:34] Christ
[25:35] it really is not
[25:37] amen
[25:39] God don't blame you
[25:41] for who you are amen he loved us just
[25:45] how we are
[25:46] but there's one thing that he expected
[25:48] us to do
[25:50] and that was surrender
[25:52] completely unconditionally surrender
[25:56] Amen to him and you know in this age a
[26:00] lady to see a laodicea is is people's
[26:03] rights or individual rights and you know
[26:07] the prophet he never mentioned this and
[26:08] I actually struggled and study this much
[26:10] you know the prophet
[26:13] never said until after the about mid 65
[26:16] was the very first time and he said it
[26:18] five times that we're not in the
[26:20] laodicean age the bride the Holy Ghost
[26:23] filled bride is not
[26:24] they're in the bright age
[26:27] but you know in the Scriptures it stops
[26:29] at the laodicean age
[26:31] and we're even though that a holy ghost
[26:34] filled believer is in the bride age you
[26:37] are under the Same Spirit
[26:40] as the layout of cnh
[26:42] and that is individual rights and we see
[26:45] a world I don't mean I don't mean I
[26:47] don't mean in this church and I don't
[26:48] mean in the bride and I definitely don't
[26:51] mean in Holy Ghost Field Believers but
[26:53] everybody has an opinion and a right
[26:56] and you know don't look at me because
[26:59] and don't touch me because and and I'm
[27:02] right because and
[27:04] but that's not the bride that Jesus
[27:06] Christ is coming to marry
[27:09] amen amen let's just read a quote maybe
[27:12] we can lay a foundation without marriage
[27:14] and divorce the the prophet said he said
[27:16] she's perfectly he said she's everything
[27:18] that the word is and she's perfectly
[27:21] every part of the word and he said
[27:23] you'll notice that even in the Old
[27:25] Testament you know David and Samuel they
[27:28] had multiple wives okay that was that
[27:30] was in the Old Testament we're not
[27:32] living in the Old Testament age okay uh
[27:35] we're definitely don't believe in
[27:36] polygamy not at all but he said back
[27:38] then he said they could have multiple
[27:40] wives but those wives could never have
[27:41] more than one husband
[27:43] and he said the husband can put his wife
[27:44] away but the wife could never put her
[27:46] husband away amen no don't ask me to
[27:49] understand that because I don't even
[27:50] understand that that's just that was
[27:52] just under the law the Bible amen but
[27:55] that carries forth that you're not going
[27:57] to put Christ away
[27:58] but he can put you away
[28:01] he can put you away if you won't
[28:02] surrender to him amen surrender to his
[28:05] word unconditionally and he said any
[28:08] wife that would refuse her husband a
[28:11] child deserves to be put away
[28:15] but now just think of that spiritually
[28:17] amen any bride Christian that refuses
[28:21] Christ's message
[28:23] is useless to Christ
[28:26] amen is useless to Christ
[28:29] and he will put you away
[28:32] he said and it is with the church that
[28:34] refused to become pregnant in this age
[28:37] and I love this part for all the people
[28:39] that are online I just I know I know we
[28:41] we have a great you know and even the
[28:44] prophet said when I was looking into the
[28:46] bride age he said this is beautiful
[28:48] beautiful brother Mike he said we're not
[28:52] in the Pentecostal age
[28:54] man I'm not even Pentecostal you know
[28:58] when the prophet said he was Pentecostal
[29:00] top and said tip of his toes now he had
[29:02] progressive revelation he completely
[29:04] changed that he said the Pentecostal age
[29:06] was later to see an age
[29:09] they were the ones that were lukewarm
[29:11] and refused God's word
[29:13] they refused to carry on they refused
[29:15] State God's seed I'm not part of that
[29:17] age there's no part of that age at all
[29:19] of course we take what Luther had
[29:21] salvation we take what Wesley had with
[29:23] sanctification of course we take the
[29:25] gifts the Vindication of the gifts and
[29:28] but we have the word we have the
[29:30] complete word and he said
[29:34] here he says that the church has refused
[29:36] to become pregnant and the age that we
[29:38] now live in he said it brings forth
[29:40] Children of the age not of Luther and
[29:42] not of Wesley and neither are we
[29:44] Pentecostals
[29:46] for all you people that still want to be
[29:48] Pentecostal I hope you enjoy the
[29:49] tribulation
[29:51] because I won't be there with you
[29:53] but he said we've got to be children
[29:55] amen and I hope you understand that he
[29:57] said you can't he said you can't be
[29:59] pregnant no so what did he do he put you
[30:04] away
[30:06] amen God bless you brother Jim amen he
[30:08] put you away in divorcement because
[30:10] you're refusing to be his wife
[30:13] amen that's why you can't be married if
[30:16] you still have your living old husband
[30:18] that's still around
[30:20] amen you you can't you can't serve two
[30:22] masters amen
[30:24] and so here we say that the woman was
[30:27] made for the man
[30:28] we're made the Bride of Crisis made for
[30:32] the pleasure of Christ period
[30:35] amen all that he wants is his and his
[30:39] bride amen it's beautiful amen but the
[30:42] church denomination has refused that and
[30:45] here we see and we're going to get into
[30:48] this many examples
[30:50] can you you know you you got to look at
[30:53] the message
[30:55] with wisdom
[30:58] they asked the prophet he said you know
[31:00] brother Jim they asked the prophet he
[31:02] said who's going to be there into
[31:03] Revelation he said if your name's on the
[31:05] Lamb's Book of Life you'll be there
[31:07] but here and hearing questions and
[31:09] answers in the end of 64. and now listen
[31:11] I'm not I'm not contradicting the
[31:12] prophet he's our prophet and he's right
[31:15] but he was growing amen and see there
[31:19] was times that he was answering one
[31:21] question he would answer it this way and
[31:22] then he'd answer another question this
[31:24] way and you got to bring them both to
[31:25] the center you take both of them bring
[31:27] them together and say well this is what
[31:28] he meant here and this is what he meant
[31:29] here and I'm not trying to change it I'm
[31:32] going to read exactly the message this
[31:33] morning
[31:34] but he said there's multiple peoples
[31:36] whose names was on the Lamb's Book of
[31:38] Life and God refused them
[31:41] I'm like
[31:43] huh
[31:45] so I I when I when I find a
[31:48] I dig really deep
[31:50] and so he gave me lots of examples
[31:52] brother Brown give us four examples and
[31:55] so you know in the message we wouldn't
[31:57] hear that very often
[32:00] we're predestinated election but the
[32:02] Bible says that many are called but few
[32:04] are chosen
[32:05] amen and you will prove that you're his
[32:09] by surrendering your will you're made
[32:13] for him
[32:14] Christ says do it
[32:16] you don't say but
[32:20] amen
[32:21] and so we might read more of that in
[32:24] Romans you know and talked about that uh
[32:27] more but we see here maybe I'll I'll
[32:30] just jump ahead but uh uh
[32:37] we see this let me give you one example
[32:39] before we read the quote the questions
[32:41] answers we see this in Esther
[32:45] amen now this is just strictly an
[32:47] aperture type of a spiritual
[32:49] but viceiva refused the king
[32:53] the king it doesn't matter if you agreed
[32:55] with the king or not see Christ ain't
[32:58] concerned whether you agree with them or
[33:00] not
[33:01] amen he's not even concerned if you
[33:03] understand it he's just concerned that
[33:05] you surrender
[33:07] so here's the King's throne a party for
[33:09] his people and the queen was thrown a
[33:12] party for her ladies and the Kings get
[33:15] drunk and he's happy and he's married
[33:17] and after many days
[33:19] and that and now he wants to show off
[33:21] his wife
[33:22] that's exactly how the scripture does he
[33:25] said she was beautiful and pleasant to
[33:26] look upon and she probably thinks that
[33:29] this fat guy's Stone drunk and he
[33:32] disgusting me
[33:35] man I'm switching from natural to
[33:37] spiritual here
[33:38] man I don't mean that we think that of
[33:40] Christ but you say to me
[33:43] and she was too concerned about her own
[33:45] program
[33:48] be careful
[33:49] when the wife is on their own agenda see
[33:52] she had her own party going on with the
[33:55] ladies and that's what the the
[33:57] denominational and the people that's got
[33:59] their own pet Doctrine and their own
[34:01] kingdom and their own they want to be
[34:03] Pentecostal or they want to be something
[34:06] you know be careful because Christ might
[34:09] ask you to come in and he wants to see
[34:10] you and you say but I'm in the middle of
[34:14] but I'm in the middle baking a cake I
[34:16] can't come
[34:18] he said I don't care about your cake
[34:21] hey man
[34:25] you know the story of my Siva very well
[34:30] but this was a major major party that he
[34:33] was throwing
[34:34] and
[34:36] there was some major alcohol going on
[34:39] and when he was married the Bible says
[34:41] when he was married on the seventh day
[34:44] with wine he ordered his people to bring
[34:48] in bath Shiva and vashiba refused the
[34:51] king
[34:52] and the reason he had asked for her
[34:54] because he was proud of her and she was
[34:57] beautiful
[34:58] and she was fair to look upon now the
[35:01] Bible goes in and says that the
[35:02] counselors of the king said now
[35:04] Bathsheba hasn't just sinned against you
[35:06] King
[35:08] but she sinned against every husband
[35:11] in the Kingdom
[35:12] because now the wives are going to be
[35:15] bossing their husbands around
[35:17] now that sounds like the laodicean
[35:19] church age if I've ever heard it
[35:21] amen the prophet talked about World War
[35:24] II when the women went to work
[35:26] wearing overhauls and started having
[35:29] their own bank accounts and ordering the
[35:32] house around and
[35:34] amen taking men's jobs and becoming
[35:37] policemen
[35:40] amen
[35:41] and they said to the king they said if
[35:43] you don't penalize her there will be no
[35:46] man in the Kingdom
[35:48] that will be able to have a wife
[35:51] that'll surrender
[35:53] to him
[35:55] amen you know what that means as adults
[35:58] in the natural and that's what crisis
[36:00] meaning to us in the spiritual
[36:03] amen
[36:08] God help us amen
[36:10] and you know you can move on to this
[36:13] story so the queen or the king put her
[36:15] away and he went to the all his men went
[36:18] and found the virgins of the country and
[36:21] this story don't stop hearing you it's a
[36:22] perfect type spiritually he said you
[36:25] know when the when Esther came in she
[36:28] wasn't one of them
[36:30] she was Jew
[36:33] and because her uncle told her she
[36:35] withheld that
[36:37] from even her own people
[36:40] she didn't tell her own people where she
[36:42] was
[36:44] and of course she never told the people
[36:45] where she was but Esther was the only
[36:48] one in the king's Chambers
[36:50] that never required their own Doctrine
[36:54] she didn't require something different
[36:57] than the word of God the message of the
[36:59] hour
[37:00] she didn't require an old Doctrine she
[37:03] didn't require Noah's message or
[37:04] Lutheran's message
[37:06] or you see what I mean
[37:08] because they offered them whatever they
[37:10] wanted and whatever they thought would
[37:12] make them beautiful for some painted
[37:14] themselves like a barn
[37:15] some probably wore high heels some
[37:17] probably wore no clothes at all very few
[37:19] clothes
[37:20] but Esther said just whatever you tell
[37:22] me to do
[37:24] I just want exactly whatever the king
[37:26] wants
[37:27] what a perfect type
[37:29] of the bride of Christ
[37:31] just whatever the God wants of course
[37:33] you know the story The King was
[37:35] delighted with her and made her Queen
[37:37] and even to half
[37:40] her kingdom and you know even when
[37:43] Esther went in you know if you go
[37:44] farther when the when the Mordecai was
[37:47] trying to kill their people
[37:49] Esther yes she did call her people to
[37:52] pray and fast but Esther had no fear
[37:55] going into the king
[37:57] because she knew the king
[38:00] had accepted her in Redemption
[38:04] amen
[38:05] the king accept her see it's one thing
[38:08] to say you're a believer but do you have
[38:11] confirmation from Christ that he's
[38:13] accepted your atonement amen accepted
[38:16] your gift
[38:17] amen
[38:18] that's what we need amen there's a lot
[38:21] of people preaching or a lot of people
[38:22] testifying
[38:23] but the proof is in the pudding amen and
[38:27] here here's the questions and answers uh
[38:30] message
[38:33] well let me just even sorry let me show
[38:36] you this here in the scripture again
[38:37] before so when we preach predestination
[38:40] and election it's so easy to believe
[38:43] well
[38:44] and many people sitting Among Us they
[38:46] said well like I believe the send time
[38:47] message completely so I'm saved I'll be
[38:50] there not necessarily
[38:52] Satan believes it and he won't be there
[38:56] amen Satan knows what you believe is the
[38:58] truth
[38:59] but he won't be there you know here's
[39:01] Peter when Jesus sent out the disciples
[39:04] and
[39:05] Jesus gave them power to cast out demons
[39:08] and things they'd say well some would
[39:09] say well if you got Vindication of your
[39:12] ministry your gifts that's hilarious
[39:15] who had more Vindication than the
[39:17] disciples that went out and come back
[39:19] bragging to Jesus how the Devils were
[39:21] subject to him
[39:23] and Jesus himself said to Peter he said
[39:26] when you get converted strengthen the
[39:28] Brethren converted
[39:30] converted how could he say converted
[39:33] when he walked with Jesus for three and
[39:35] a half years and was going around
[39:37] preaching the guy said oh devils
[39:40] I've been like you coming up to a
[39:42] minister that's preaching for years and
[39:43] got a dynamic Ministry in Casa no
[39:45] spirits and say Hey brother when you get
[39:47] converted you won't preach that
[39:53] some of them need to be told that
[39:58] amen
[40:01] yep
[40:02] amen here's another one you know Jesus
[40:05] anytime
[40:07] you know we know that Jesus went to the
[40:09] worst of sinners
[40:11] the worst of our Sinners but in every
[40:13] case see
[40:15] we read that in the first revelation of
[40:17] Romans he said you know
[40:19] what shall we say then should we have
[40:21] Grace So sin could abound God forbid you
[40:25] know when when Jesus came to the worst
[40:28] Sinners what was the thing he said all
[40:29] the time
[40:31] I forgive you
[40:34] but go and sin no more
[40:37] amen you're not forgiven and still
[40:39] living in sin God don't give anybody the
[40:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost living in a
[40:44] dirty cop
[40:45] amen amen I'm not taking a drink of
[40:48] water out of a cop that looks like a pig
[40:49] pen I won't be thirsty
[40:52] very bad and neither will God be thirsty
[40:56] for your life if you think he's going to
[40:58] put the holy ghost in a cup that's
[41:00] completely garbage
[41:02] amen
[41:03] so when you get saved you're not
[41:05] converted
[41:07] when you get Sanctified and you got a
[41:10] beautiful clean cup and you wear a nice
[41:12] tie and you got an awesome haircut
[41:17] you're not converted
[41:20] not yet
[41:22] when you're casting out devils and
[41:24] preaching the gospel
[41:26] I hope you're not preaching but
[41:28] there is some that are
[41:33] if you're not born again you're not
[41:35] converted
[41:36] amen
[41:38] so here's Jesus
[41:42] when he's seeing the woman
[41:44] got in the very Act
[41:46] and he wrote In The Sand
[41:48] now she was she was a sinner
[41:51] he said where's your accusers
[41:54] they said neither do I accuse you but
[41:58] from this time forward
[42:01] amen
[42:02] some people are playing around with the
[42:05] world thinking they're coming to church
[42:07] in a message church if you don't get rid
[42:09] of that garbage you'll never go in a
[42:11] rapture
[42:12] you'll never go in a Rapture you're
[42:14] you're messing with God and he don't
[42:16] like it
[42:17] it's like a husband or a wife that's
[42:19] cheating on her husband
[42:21] any kind of a man with any kind of
[42:23] discernment at all we'll pick that up
[42:26] like that
[42:28] because it's spirits
[42:31] and god Jehovah definitely will
[42:34] Christ Jesus amen this is the long quote
[42:37] and Vicky on him sorry
[42:39] please
[42:43] sorry I forgot to give it to you
[42:45] it's completely shut off
[42:48] it's on Facebook Messenger
[42:51] we started the third picture
[42:54] um just for your I'm a poor reader and I
[42:56] got a terrible voice this morning but
[42:58] here they asked brother Brown this is a
[43:00] 6408 30 questions and answers and he
[43:03] says brother Brown you said in the
[43:04] seventh Church age you mentioned that
[43:06] Judith was had been Justified and
[43:08] Sanctified was I genuine
[43:12] because see they're thinking he was
[43:14] converted and yet he was the devil
[43:18] and the prophet said that's a good
[43:20] question
[43:21] and he explained in general Grace that
[43:23] he received genuine Grace he said also
[43:27] mentioned that judah's name was on the
[43:30] Lamb's Book of Life
[43:33] now how can you be lost if your name's
[43:35] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[43:37] I'm going to give you I think four
[43:38] examples this morning to peoples whose
[43:40] names were on the Lamb's Book of Life
[43:42] and because of their will
[43:46] see we believe in predestination and
[43:49] election and believe me I praise God for
[43:52] it because it took all my fear away
[43:56] but you're still a free moral agent
[44:01] yes sir
[44:04] and when your husband comes to you and
[44:06] wants to take you as your wife
[44:08] and you deny her
[44:10] not him
[44:13] your name's just been removed
[44:16] amen
[44:18] amen
[44:19] so he said now that's a good one isn't
[44:21] it he said he said no it would be good
[44:23] he said it depended on the Lord
[44:25] uh depending on the Lord to answer this
[44:28] question he said
[44:30] I mentioned that judah's name was on the
[44:33] Lamb's Book of Life that's right at the
[44:34] beginning of the red he said that's
[44:36] right he said we know that because Jesus
[44:38] told them when they all was sent out in
[44:41] Matthew 10 and cast out devils and
[44:43] preached the gospel and freely give
[44:45] freely receive freely give and they
[44:48] return back rejoicing because the Devils
[44:50] were subject onto them see you got to
[44:53] have discernment don't necessarily sit
[44:55] under a Ministry because he's got great
[44:58] show
[45:00] if that's the case there's a lot of TV
[45:02] evangelists that would do great job
[45:05] Matt
[45:07] Hallelujah
[45:08] and Jesus told him he said he called
[45:10] their names which ones
[45:13] and set them out and he said and he came
[45:15] back and Judas is scary which had
[45:17] betrayed him no it's still the first one
[45:20] ah
[45:22] no we're three
[45:25] there right there sorry
[45:28] we'll start from there I'd already read
[45:30] the other ones
[45:33] he said now in the blue there he said
[45:36] now the attitude was wrong there you
[45:38] mustn't Rejoice because you got power
[45:40] over Devils you he said watch this he
[45:43] said you mustn't do that
[45:45] Rejoice because you've even received
[45:47] enough Grace to be saved he said you
[45:50] must rejoice
[45:52] that's how people should be
[45:54] he said surely people that has a gift
[45:57] people who don't want
[46:02] usually people
[46:03] that has gifts are people who don't want
[46:06] gifts
[46:07] so you watch the people that are always
[46:10] wanting
[46:12] uh
[46:14] the demonstration of God the show-off of
[46:16] God Amen which we believe God could do
[46:19] that
[46:20] but see God's sovereign
[46:22] it's up to him
[46:24] amen
[46:26] Paul tried to run from the thing Moses
[46:28] and great leaders like that tried to run
[46:31] from their job
[46:33] and now it lays before God he said you
[46:36] see you take a guy that always oh Lord
[46:38] fill me with power and I'll go out there
[46:41] and I'll cast out those devils
[46:44] he said this is right there at the top
[46:47] there he said he'll never do it
[46:49] God will never do it because he knows
[46:52] you can never handle it
[46:54] amen
[46:55] God knows better than to trust anybody
[46:59] like that
[47:01] wow
[47:04] amen
[47:06] it's a guy that don't want nothing to do
[47:08] with the ministry nothing to do with it
[47:10] he said that's the guy that God will
[47:12] take and teach him something sometime
[47:15] he said so back when Judas was back
[47:18] rejoicing with all them in the names he
[47:20] said don't Rejoice because the devil's
[47:22] subject unto you
[47:23] he said Rejoice because your name's
[47:25] written in the book of life now if
[47:26] you'll notice
[47:28] and he goes to Daniel here
[47:30] he says because your name's in the book
[47:32] of life because it's in heaven your name
[47:35] has been recognized that now here it's
[47:39] right in the middle of the paper there I
[47:41] got mine highlighted in yellow but
[47:43] he said it that doesn't mean
[47:46] that you're saved
[47:49] now I haven't heard that many times in a
[47:51] message Church your name's on the Lamb's
[47:53] Book of Life you so I'm predestinated
[47:55] I'll be there
[47:57] but not if your Will's wrong
[48:01] not if you refuse your husband today
[48:05] he's saying if your name's on the Lamb's
[48:07] Book of Life and inhabitants recognized
[48:09] in heaven
[48:10] he said that still doesn't mean that
[48:12] you're saved
[48:13] he said see you're not converted until
[48:17] you receive the Holy Ghost
[48:21] wow remember that that don't
[48:30] it's right below the blue in the middle
[48:32] he said that still doesn't mean that
[48:34] you're saved he said you're converted
[48:36] when you see the Holy Ghost he said
[48:37] you're only potentially converted
[48:41] potentially
[48:43] there's a lot of people in message
[48:45] churches that are potentially
[48:47] converted and they're living a lie and
[48:51] flirting with the world
[48:56] and they're doing it
[48:58] because election and predestination is
[49:01] pushed so hard
[49:04] which we believe
[49:07] but don't be deceived
[49:10] you know in your heart what your will is
[49:14] if you refuse his seed you know it
[49:18] nobody the whole world might not know
[49:20] about you and your husband
[49:22] but those two people know
[49:25] and you and Christ know
[49:28] you can fool all of us but you're not
[49:30] fooling Christ
[49:31] amen you might as well recognize it
[49:34] before you get there you're not going to
[49:36] get there and say well I know my name
[49:37] was in the Lamb's Book of Life so I'd be
[49:39] safe
[49:40] God's going to scroll back to this
[49:41] morning with the minister of terrible
[49:43] voice and say you couldn't understand
[49:45] him he had it on the screen too
[49:48] man
[49:50] you still have the will
[49:52] to accept or reject seed
[49:55] because God isn't a Forester
[49:58] amen
[50:00] and if you ask me about an oak tree and
[50:03] he said if you got an acorn potentially
[50:04] he got an oak tree he said if you ask me
[50:06] about a field of corn he said you got to
[50:08] see the corn potentially you got to see
[50:10] the corn he said you're Justified he
[50:13] said now you're on your road through
[50:15] justification sanctification
[50:18] the three works of Grace and working to
[50:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and but
[50:23] when you're genuinely
[50:26] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[50:28] then you're in the Kingdom
[50:33] man let's go to the next page
[50:37] here here he said just the end of the
[50:40] other one Jesus told Peter who had been
[50:42] uh
[50:45] John 17 17 Jesus said
[52:03] John 17 17.
[52:06] Jesus said sanctify them Father through
[52:08] the truth
[52:10] for your word is truth that's right at
[52:12] the top there
[52:16] and
[52:24] here here Jesus was telling Peter before
[52:26] he betrayed him
[52:43] man Amy just maybe leave that off if I
[52:58] hey Matt here's the prophet said he said
[53:01] the man that followed him for three
[53:02] years
[53:03] and had his name in the Lamb's Book
[53:05] collect that's right near the top and it
[53:07] cleared not highlighted and had its name
[53:09] in the lanes book light was cast out to
[53:11] the devils
[53:13] got so Devil's done great works and
[53:15] field many
[53:16] and all kinds of things and preach the
[53:18] word and everything but still
[53:26] converted we're going to jump down to
[53:30] let's go to the next page 282.
[53:37] there the prophet repeats himself a
[53:38] bunch
[53:40] he even compares there the part that we
[53:42] skipped about a woman
[53:44] when a man and wife come together
[53:46] potentially they will have a baby
[53:48] but he said there's not a baby until the
[53:51] baby's born
[53:52] amen
[53:55] he said so just beginning the second
[53:56] paragraph down there on 282.
[53:59] he said another book was open it was the
[54:01] book of life and those whose names were
[54:04] on the Book of Life had to be judged out
[54:06] of the book he said Judas Iscariot
[54:08] professed to be a believer had his name
[54:10] written
[54:12] among them on the Book of Life is that
[54:14] right and he claimed to have eternal
[54:16] life
[54:29] condemned the word of life then he sold
[54:33] out for 30 pieces of silver see him come
[54:36] right back to his will he would have
[54:38] never had to be judged but his will was
[54:40] wrong
[54:43] we won't be judged because we're judged
[54:45] already
[54:47] we're judged here you're surrendering
[54:50] your will is allowing judgment
[54:52] amen
[54:54] sorry
[54:57] amen
[55:03] I said watch this now some sell out to
[55:05] be Methodist
[55:07] or whatever more sellout their position
[55:09] from the Lamb's Book of Life see their
[55:12] position from the Lamb's Book of Life
[55:15] and he'll be judged and he'll have to be
[55:17] stand there the Judgment by the word see
[55:20] that's the Judas did it and Judas came
[55:23] to the judgment and his name was on the
[55:25] Lamb's Book of Life but that didn't mean
[55:27] he was saved
[55:29] he had to stand the judgment
[55:33] now here's the sleeping versions that
[55:36] slam right there under the same same
[55:38] thing and Jesus said that uh in uh
[55:42] John 5 24 he said he that heareth my
[55:45] word and here the prophet breaks us down
[55:47] amen God bless our Prophet for uh Divine
[55:51] interpretation of the word he said this
[55:53] don't mean here
[55:54] this means receive
[55:57] amen it goes right back to your will
[55:59] again
[55:59] if you'll receive him then you're
[56:02] accepted but if you won't receive them
[56:04] then you're not amen that it's him that
[56:07] receiveth not him that just hears and
[56:10] preach he said that's nonsense him that
[56:13] receiveth my word and heareth my word
[56:15] and believeth on it
[56:17] has passed from Death unto life he said
[56:20] right there down at the bottom he said
[56:22] so Judith had his name there in the
[56:24] Lamb's Book life he said that's exactly
[56:25] right but he was condemned because what
[56:28] he did
[56:30] to do he sold out his Birthright
[56:33] he said uh
[56:36] uh here's a
[56:42] Esau was born
[56:44] Esau he uses a again as a type of having
[56:47] his name in the last book life here Esau
[56:49] was born in the family promised to God
[56:52] the eldest son and had the birthright
[56:56] and how many knows that but the promise
[56:58] of God Esau's name was on the Lamb's
[57:01] Book book for the birthright but he
[57:05] swapped it
[57:06] a man for a bowl of soup because he was
[57:09] hungry amen so even though your name's
[57:12] in the Lamb's Book of Life and even
[57:13] though we preached predestination and
[57:15] even though we believe in and and all
[57:18] the predestination of being called not
[57:20] you still have the will to refuse your
[57:23] husband
[57:25] if you ever refuse your husband you'll
[57:27] never be there
[57:28] amen you'll never be there flirting with
[57:32] the world and having two husbands it's
[57:33] it's not going to be amen
[57:36] it's not going to be
[57:38] he said those spies that went over
[57:41] except Joshua and Caleb he said they all
[57:45] had their names on the Lamb's Book of
[57:46] Life but they sold out their Birthright
[57:49] because they refused to believe that God
[57:51] had given the Promised Land
[57:54] so there's there you have Esau had his
[57:56] name was promise to have his name's on
[57:59] the Lamb's Book of Life you have the the
[58:01] spice the one with Joshua and Caleb
[58:03] sold out the birth right and you have
[58:06] Judas Iscariot that all were
[58:08] predestinated to be in heaven as part of
[58:11] the bride and because of their will and
[58:13] their choices
[58:17] they were refused
[58:19] amen
[58:21] God help us God help us in this message
[58:23] because God's revealed you know who much
[58:26] is given much is required
[58:28] amen
[58:30] and God has taken the seals off the book
[58:32] and the the Bible is a brand new book
[58:34] and the Mysteries are completely
[58:36] revealed but sometimes people in the
[58:38] message are trying to hide under that
[58:40] and saying well look I believe the
[58:43] prophet and I I believe so much of this
[58:46] but at the same time they're living in a
[58:48] world of Hollywood
[58:50] or they're flirting with another husband
[58:53] amen
[58:55] God help us
[58:57] God help us
[58:59] I want I want to just I know this would
[59:02] maybe be a bit slow but the next one is
[59:04] a really
[59:05] it's it's worth it man we got our tongue
[59:09] amen Jesus said or here he says Paul
[59:12] with the inspiration and the Hebrews
[59:14] chapter he says
[59:16] for it is impossible for those that were
[59:18] once enlightened and been partakers of
[59:20] the Holy Ghost who have tasted the power
[59:22] of the world to come if they will fall
[59:24] away and renew themselves again unto
[59:27] repentance seeing as that they have
[59:28] crucified themselves the Son of God
[59:30] again encountered the blood Covenant
[59:32] wherewith they were
[59:36] signified in the Holy they they disgrace
[59:40] God Amen let's go to 287 and then
[59:43] everyone besides Joshua and Caleb
[59:47] died in Parish in the wilderness yet
[59:49] they were Believers and their names were
[59:52] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:54] that's what our Prophet says
[59:57] amen
[59:59] God help us
[1:00:01] and when they refused the gate to the
[1:00:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:05] because of
[1:00:08] can you help me out there honey
[1:00:09] right at the bottom and clear
[1:00:14] because of denominational they've
[1:00:16] refused to walk in that person is lost
[1:00:18] and can never be saved see they've done
[1:00:21] that despite even the very works of
[1:00:24] Grace that's called them up to that
[1:00:27] place and showed them and then they
[1:00:28] turned around and walk away and he
[1:00:30] counts the blood of the Covenant
[1:00:32] wherewith he was crucified
[1:00:40] amen if we drop right to the bottom
[1:00:42] there now watch the pattern
[1:00:45] Judas Iscariot followed those same steps
[1:00:47] he was justified believing that the Lord
[1:00:50] Jesus Christ then had accepted him as a
[1:00:53] personal savior he was Sanctified given
[1:00:55] the power to cast out spirits in the
[1:00:57] name of the lamb and his names in the
[1:00:59] lamb Book of Life
[1:01:00] but it came when it came to
[1:01:03] the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy
[1:01:05] Ghost
[1:01:07] and the fullness of the word he showed
[1:01:09] his true colors that's exactly what the
[1:01:12] Canaan spice did and that's exactly what
[1:01:15] Esau done
[1:01:16] he said that's
[1:01:18] exactly what he did in the garden surely
[1:01:22] God will not
[1:01:24] amen hallelujah he said let's just drop
[1:01:26] to 291 he said the church followed
[1:01:28] through this through justification
[1:01:32] and Martin Luther through sanctification
[1:01:35] in Wesley
[1:01:37] but when it comes to the time the
[1:01:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost has showed
[1:01:40] their true colors and they want nothing
[1:01:42] to do with it
[1:01:44] and he talked about the the Holiness
[1:01:46] Church is
[1:01:48] there that they believe in
[1:01:49] sanctification and and you and they're
[1:01:52] clean people you can't lay a finger on
[1:01:54] them amen
[1:01:55] but stop
[1:01:57] short of receiving the baptism of the
[1:02:00] Holy Ghost and the new birth
[1:02:02] the devil has tricked them let's drop to
[1:02:04] 292. there he said he brought them
[1:02:07] around to say
[1:02:09] uh
[1:02:10] he said you have a sensation and you
[1:02:12] have to do this and you have been and
[1:02:15] you have to be born into it he said
[1:02:17] don't tell
[1:02:19] he said don't let no one tell you this
[1:02:22] is this is the part I want to get to
[1:02:24] don't let no one tell you that
[1:02:26] sanctification is the same work of Grace
[1:02:29] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] he said it's not
[1:02:35] it's certainly not and there there's a
[1:02:37] Nazarene person sitting below there he
[1:02:39] said no it's not it's many many churches
[1:02:42] believe it they're saved and they're
[1:02:44] Sanctified and they're living a holy
[1:02:45] life
[1:02:47] but with the prophet saying here is
[1:02:50] they're not even converted
[1:02:53] they're not even converted yet
[1:02:56] amen the reason they're not converted
[1:02:59] because they haven't received life
[1:03:02] they haven't received his life God help
[1:03:03] us amen
[1:03:04] amen God help us let's just turn to uh
[1:03:09] James 4. we can come out of that Amy
[1:03:11] James 4 and 17 we're going to close here
[1:03:14] in just a second I'm gonna read Romans
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:19] James 4 and 17 therefore
[1:03:28] therefore to him that knoweth to do good
[1:03:31] and doeth it not
[1:03:33] to him
[1:03:35] it is a sin
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:39] so if you're sitting in a message charge
[1:03:41] and you say well I'm going to be there
[1:03:43] because I'm predestinated
[1:03:45] I'm going to be there because my name's
[1:03:46] on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm going to
[1:03:48] be there because I know my name's on the
[1:03:50] Lamb's Book of Life because I recognize
[1:03:52] the message of our age
[1:03:55] but if you're not born again yet
[1:03:58] you're not even converted
[1:04:01] you're not even converted
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] and you can dial
[1:04:09] some people's lives if they're not
[1:04:11] converted because God won't give the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost
[1:04:15] to somebody that's got a dirty life
[1:04:18] we'll all that's got the baptism of the
[1:04:21] Holy Ghost have shortcomings
[1:04:23] we'll all have shortcomings and stumble
[1:04:25] and I might insult Matt and slam the
[1:04:28] door on brother Jim
[1:04:30] okay those are shortcomings but flat out
[1:04:33] sin God ain't there
[1:04:36] God ain't there because God can have
[1:04:38] fellowship with sin you know our Prophet
[1:04:41] said when Jesus died on the cross watch
[1:04:43] this is very important when Jesus died
[1:04:46] on the cross the spirit of God left
[1:04:49] Jesus
[1:04:52] I can give you the quote for that
[1:04:54] because God couldn't look at sin
[1:05:00] the spirit of the god left Jesus
[1:05:03] because God can't look or have receive
[1:05:06] sin
[1:05:07] amen even though Jesus was the son of
[1:05:10] God and died for our sins
[1:05:13] but God don't have fellowship with sins
[1:05:16] man and we know the prophet clearly
[1:05:19] taught us that God had to Tabernacle in
[1:05:21] a flesh body because the spirit can't
[1:05:23] die
[1:05:24] but God you're not telling us you're not
[1:05:27] belie you're believing a lie to say I'm
[1:05:30] filled with the Holy Ghost and your life
[1:05:32] is obviously
[1:05:33] in a backsoluted state
[1:05:36] may God help us
[1:05:38] God help us let's just read Revelations
[1:05:40] or Romans sorry Romans 6. we're going to
[1:05:43] close with this and I want to read down
[1:05:45] to uh
[1:05:47] I think about 14. I'm going to start the
[1:05:49] top in about 14. this is this is a good
[1:05:52] read
[1:05:54] I want to bring to your attention that
[1:05:56] it's Romans 8. where the saint where the
[1:05:59] same writer Paul talks about
[1:06:00] predestination and election and totally
[1:06:04] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:06:06] his Ephesians 1 and 5 in different
[1:06:09] places we totally believe in that
[1:06:13] but you can take that to the extreme
[1:06:16] and get to heaven
[1:06:18] and you might as well know the truth
[1:06:20] here
[1:06:20] is to get there and say
[1:06:22] well nobody showed me
[1:06:25] nobody showed me
[1:06:27] you'll have no excuses there what shall
[1:06:29] we say then shall we continue in sin the
[1:06:32] grace they abound see this was a message
[1:06:36] where we were doing away with the law
[1:06:39] and Grace was coming over our
[1:06:42] shortcomings
[1:06:43] but that don't mean that you will fully
[1:06:46] sin
[1:06:48] when you willfully accept another
[1:06:50] husband
[1:06:53] there's no atonement for that
[1:06:56] God forbid how so we live how shall we
[1:06:58] that our dad to sin live any longer
[1:07:03] therein
[1:07:05] know ye not that so many of us that as
[1:07:08] were baptized into Jesus Christ
[1:07:11] were baptized into his death therefore
[1:07:14] we are buried with him by the baptism
[1:07:18] into death
[1:07:20] that like as Christ was raised up from
[1:07:23] the dead by the glory of the father even
[1:07:25] so we shall also
[1:07:28] shall walk in newness of Life see your
[1:07:31] life will be changed
[1:07:32] if you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost
[1:07:36] most cases you won't have to tell
[1:07:38] anybody
[1:07:40] certainly not somebody else that's got
[1:07:42] to hold a ghost
[1:07:44] because your spirits you you can see it
[1:07:47] you can feel it
[1:07:49] amen
[1:07:51] for if we had been planted together in
[1:07:53] the likeness of his death we shall be
[1:07:56] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:07:58] knowing this that our old man
[1:08:03] he died
[1:08:05] is crucified with him that the body of
[1:08:08] sin may be destroyed
[1:08:10] can't have two husbands and hencefor we
[1:08:13] shall not serve sin no more see these
[1:08:16] other believers their their second
[1:08:17] husband hadn't died yet
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:22] for he that is Dad is free from sin
[1:08:25] now we be dead in Christ we believe that
[1:08:28] we shall also live in him knowing that
[1:08:30] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[1:08:33] no more death hath no more dominion
[1:08:37] over him
[1:08:39] for in that he died he died unto sin
[1:08:42] once
[1:08:43] but in that he liveth he liveth to God
[1:08:46] likewise reckon ye ourselves
[1:08:50] yourselves to be dad indeed to sin but
[1:08:54] to live unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] let not sin therefore reign
[1:09:03] over your mortal body what what this
[1:09:06] whole message is this morning is
[1:09:08] people are living under the umbrella of
[1:09:10] predestination and live and under sin
[1:09:13] they're living under the umbrella of the
[1:09:15] message
[1:09:17] and they're eating their brother for
[1:09:19] dinner
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:24] let not sin therefore Reign Over Your
[1:09:26] mortal body that ye shall obey it in the
[1:09:30] lust thereof neither yield your members
[1:09:33] as instruments of unrighteousness Unto
[1:09:36] sin
[1:09:39] there's your will
[1:09:41] Leo
[1:09:43] that yield your members as instruments
[1:09:47] to sin on righteousness
[1:09:50] that's a choice that you have
[1:09:53] amen but yield yourself unto God as
[1:09:55] those that are alive
[1:09:57] from death
[1:09:59] and your members are instruments of
[1:10:01] righteousness unto God for for sin shall
[1:10:04] not have dominion over you for ye are
[1:10:07] not under the law
[1:10:10] but under grace
[1:10:12] amen thank God for Grace amen but we
[1:10:15] don't want to take Grace
[1:10:18] to a disgrace
[1:10:20] and may God help us
[1:10:22] to realize that if we're under grace
[1:10:25] we'll never crucify him
[1:10:28] again
[1:10:29] we'll recognize
[1:10:31] that we were saved
[1:10:33] but
[1:10:34] when you're saved from something that
[1:10:36] was evil
[1:10:37] why do you want to flirt with fire why
[1:10:39] do you want to flirt with the poisonous
[1:10:41] snake why do you want to flirt with
[1:10:43] something that you've already been hurt
[1:10:45] with
[1:10:46] burn once you learn burn twice
[1:10:50] amen no forgiveness
[1:10:53] God help assist them
[1:10:56] God help us
[1:11:04] and you really look into that I
[1:11:06] apologize again for my
[1:11:09] my voice and my cough when you really
[1:11:11] look into that and you think of how
[1:11:13] Peter
[1:11:14] and Judas Iscariot
[1:11:16] preach the gospel
[1:11:19] follow Jesus three and a half years his
[1:11:21] ministry for some of his closest friends
[1:11:24] Connections in the world
[1:11:26] one of the twelves two of the twelve
[1:11:30] cast out demons and money wondrous works
[1:11:34] at an unbelievable Ministry
[1:11:38] and one was the devil and the other was
[1:11:40] unconverted
[1:11:43] wow
[1:11:45] it shows you that with the natural eye
[1:11:48] you can never see
[1:11:51] what you think amen God help us
[1:11:58] foreign
[1:12:21] empty and broken
[1:12:23] amen
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:39] thank you
[1:12:58] foreign
[1:13:06] thank you
[1:13:08] Lord
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:13:36] Jesus
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:12] foreign
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:43] foreign
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:15:17] you know it's been said that
[1:15:20] God sees us
[1:15:22] are in picture
[1:15:24] and he don't see our sin
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:28] because he sees the product finished the
[1:15:31] predestinate
[1:15:33] and that's true
[1:15:35] if that sins under the blood
[1:15:39] but if that's
[1:15:41] to know to do right and not do it is
[1:15:44] Iniquity
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:47] and if that's willful sin
[1:15:51] for all those people that are hiding
[1:15:54] under predestination
[1:15:55] if you willfully sin
[1:15:59] God sees it
[1:16:03] God don't see your sinful mistakes
[1:16:06] when you stumble and fall
[1:16:08] you didn't mean to do it
[1:16:12] it wasn't pre it's the difference of
[1:16:14] murder or premeditated murder
[1:16:18] if you make a calculated decision
[1:16:21] I'm going to go out and sin
[1:16:24] God sees that sin
[1:16:27] and you're not converted
[1:16:30] God help us not to preach that wrong or
[1:16:34] hide under an umbrella that's untrue God
[1:16:37] help me
[1:16:39] amen God knows we're in flesh bodies and
[1:16:42] we make mistakes daily
[1:16:44] Paul said I fall daily
[1:16:48] but that wasn't premeditated intentional
[1:16:51] mistakes
[1:16:52] it was because we were in a weak body
[1:16:56] God help us amen Lord Jesus we love you
[1:16:58] and Lord we ask that you just bless this
[1:17:02] bride and may you take my my terrible
[1:17:04] scattered thoughts today and and voice
[1:17:07] Lord Jesus and may they make sense of it
[1:17:10] Lord Jesus Through Your Divine anointing
[1:17:13] Lord Jesus I pray
[1:17:15] bless your bride in a special way Lord
[1:17:17] Jesus and our only desire Lord Jesus
[1:17:21] so know and live the trips
[1:17:24] and understand it how you brought it
[1:17:26] Lord Jesus how your Prophet revealed it
[1:17:29] and know the truth here
[1:17:32] so we can stand tall over there Lord
[1:17:34] Jesus
