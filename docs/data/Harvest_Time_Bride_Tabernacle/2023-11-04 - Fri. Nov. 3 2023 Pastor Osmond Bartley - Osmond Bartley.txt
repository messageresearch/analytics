I'll think about it I'm inviting you to Canada I'm thinking about it let's pray about it brother we pray but you know what hit me is like you know what your pastor said at this convention he says brother Bartley you must come that hit me like an earthquake and so I'm here like amen is I that vibrated so hard and I says I have to be here by the grace of the Lord but as a people of the word who believe in predestination we understand the true meaning of predestination and so we I couldn't be here KN Oh Glory hallelujah amen praise be to God I couldn't be here no other day but here this time

Fellowship we come not just to have good time but to see the manifestation of the power of God move Among Us believe with my whole heart let's just stand and I want to speak to you from the word of Genesis Chapter 30 amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah amen just a great time in the Lord could you bow your heads with me a few minutes and allow the spirit of the Lord to direct us father Lord

of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts Lord we're going to see great things happen Among Us Lord father souls to be delivered Lord Hearts to be encouraged and Hallelujah father sick being healed Lord Whatever It Is God we know that the sons of God are here and the power of God to be manifested in this great day Lord can I say this to your people this is the greatest AG that there ever was this is the last days this is a great day of the feast when the son of man is tending again Hallelujah Lord we're here to drink and to feast and to manifest Hallelujah to know this world need to know that you are the same yesterday today and forever that you are are still alive God and you never changes glory to God lord anoint this vessel tonight with strength and inspiration and moreover God the greatest gift is humility that I can be used for your purpose tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray let the bride of Christ say amen and amen again amen hallelujah in the Book of Genesis chter 30 I just want to read from verse 37 to verse 39 and you may take your seats and the word of God says and this is about uh brother Jacob you know and no matter what you think about him but he was predestinated amen he was the greatest character in this Bible God used him for a purpose amen and Jacob took him rods of green papor and of the AEL and chestnut tree and peeled them and white strikes in them and made the white appear which is in the rods and he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks and the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they come to drink that's interesting and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ring straight speckled and spotted you heard that now jump look over to verse 25 and it came to pass when wael had born Joseph that Jacob said said unto laan send me away that I may go unto my own place I want to go home can I get some weakness I want to go to my own place I'm on the verge of going home and to my country I'm not from here I'm I want to go to my home place Hallelujah God bless you be seated may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you know tonight as we we talk about in the and I'm sure we all realize what's happening around the world today in the heast all over the world there is war and rumors of War everywhere it's all over war and rumors of War heav aware and it is in the heart and desire of every true Sons and Daughters of God that you want to go home the governments are confused everything you you know there is no trust anymore you cannot trust a system you cannot trust the the medical system nothing at all and therefore there's something in the children of God just pulling us back to our own country I come from God and I'm going back to God hallelujah something in me putting me home and so we could look at a thought tonight if the Lord permit us when the Dynamics change when the Dynamics change not the mechanics leave them alone but when the Dynamics change and to understand this little Let's us lay a foundation here glory to God how how many minutes I got I trust amen tonight is not on a fast food thing we want to have a full course meal amen I'm at home is that right I'm at home the first time you know when I went to Ghana Brother D brother John and there's some service when I look at my clock it was like two and a half hours some service you know I don't used to that and so I I got he I I felt like I was European two and a half hours song service was getting real hot three hours they were just ready to worship and when I preach I preached two and a half hours and I was about to quit they said come on preach it glory to God I never preached so hard in my life it's the people that pulls a gift Hallelujah your hunger will determine how well you are fed and so if you're hungry there is a lot here for you to heat Oh Glory to God Amen your hunger amen will pull out the gift of God there is healing in God there is Miracle in God but it takes the people to pull it out Hallelujah glory to God and so we think about the changing of the Dynamics but let's just lay a foundation here a little bit Amen to know that Jacob you know the prophet taught us that Jacob knew the spiritual side of his lineage he knew it because he was 15 years old when his grand father Abraham died so he knew it Hallelujah he was more spiritual than his brother Oh Glory to God and so he uh being a shan7 years old amen when he fled from his own country and working for his father-in-law for 20 years look at that you know and when you understand the whole thing is that he was just making his father-in-law rich but now he was saying you know give me my wages I need to Amen to start providing for my family now you know and laan said to him uh you know I really appreciate you because since you came my life was been blessed Hallelujah you know you know since you are here God bless me that's a presence of a True Believer amen when were oh Hallelujah sons of God you carry a blessing can you say Amen to that since you are here my business is flourishing glory to God but anyway amen Jacob said I want to provide for my own family because he was not ready to go home he was on the verge of the departing home Hallelujah and so he said to laan his father-in-law he said let's make a deal you see all the animals you got and the cattles you have I want us I I want you to give me all the the streaks the the spotted ones let me have those glory to God he's all right but then notice the males there were males in the flock that were spotted oh yeah read it so what laan did the first that same day he took out all the spotted males all the Rings straight males and gave it to his sons because you and I know that from the male you are likely to get some kides looking like the males oh go GL to God hallelujah and so the very same day he took out all the males and then he said okay Jacob the deal is on so there was no more 5050 Church hallelujah oh god oh I'm preaching church so the deal is on I like this and Jacob now oh God you know what amen Jacob the Bible said Jacob took some po sticks Asian nut sticks and Chestnut sticks sir he never created the sticks they were always there he never changed the mechanics the same males the same females but he was going to change the Dynamics woo Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen the bocks were the same the effers were the same the Rams were the same the use were the same but something is going to change it takes the Dynamics to bring forth the production hallelujah hallelujah glory to God God work with Dynamics to bring forth the production now Jacob never randomly picked sticks he picked those sticks particular the popular was a special word hallelujah can I preach this Hallelujah it was colorless it was oderless and it was tasteless but the ideal material it had a peculiar look to it the prophet says when the animals look up the popular stick it frightened them it created something on the inside oh hallelujah amen but the Haan not tree amen the animals love it they love the leaves they love even the dry Twigs even Birds would pick up the dry Twigs oh Hallelujah and he would put it there while why it attract the animals it attract them to the water trough the water trough never change the water never change glory to God but something is going to change hallelujah what you keep looking at is what you produce something is on the inside something is being created but then the they man the chestnut tree you know what about the chestnut it carries some medicinal properties it carries a lot of minerals and a lot of vitamin K that says that it was good for both own development it was good for diarrhea it was good for coughing so Not only was he attracting them Not only was he shocking their minds but he was creating another generation on the inside oh Hallelujah somebody never see this coming Hal Hallelujah but after Moses left God was creating another generation to take the promise he changed the Dynamics and the Bible said in verse 43 he says the man increases production increases oh Hallelujah and the countenance of Labor change but he said I got to go home I'm going home but the Dynamics changes leave the mechanics alone you understanding the foundation now notice this watch the ministry of Jesus Christ as he turned water into wine at the pleading of his mother it was noise abroad people like to follow signs is that right people are excited about signs and miracles belief increases among many Jews especially when the her he was a Jew crowd increases everybody want to be a part of this movement Hallelujah after he raised the bars in the word and getting deeper into the word when he showed him in John chapter 6:48 when he showed him that he was the bread of life Hallelujah and we said to them amen unless you hate me you have no life unless you drink my blood how can you understand this amen how the Dynamics is changing now oh glory to God Amen and now he said you have no life now oh go now the crowd get less I'm in confusion fill the here because a young Prophet is introducing us to heat him Hallelujah hey critics increases oh my and followers get less but yet there were some that would follow him a far off because John chapter 8 from verse 3132 Jesus said to those Jews that believe Hallelujah choose that believe if you continue in my word so they were Believers to those Jews that believe brothers and sisters so they were Believers Satan is a Believer can I preach Kain was a Believer Hallelujah Satan believed this message Satan believe that William Brandon was a prophet that don't make him the bride oh preach God I want to preach this woo Hallelujah see you know why you can believe and still bound you can believe and still trapped Oh Glory to God if you continue in my word you shall be my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth woo Hallelujah but you need to continue you need to continue because you need to be made free Oh Glory to God is that right oh God but he's going higher as he changed from the public Ministry now because brother John taught to you two Ministries public and private from John chapter 1 to John chapter 12 verse 50 that was public but the private start from third chapter 13 when he had his own in the room in the guest Chamber Something is changing it's getting more inate oh Hallelujah is that right the Bible said he loved his own St John 13:1 he love them onto the End Amen right there Jesus said to them John 13:3 he says you call me master and Lord and so am I is that right then he went down ferle he said to them in the room now this is not for everybody this is not just for believers this is for the Selected Few you should have closer we get to the end the crowd is getting less Hallelujah can I preach this Hallelujah I felt the anointing to use I'm not using crowd anymore this is not about crowd this is called this is about the called out wo Hallelujah the closer we get to leaving here amen is a smaller the number is going to become you know why because the Holy Ghost Christ to the holy spirit is getting more intimate he said to them I call you Norm more servants John 15:15 but I call you no friends because you're going to know everything about me before that he tell them let not your heart be troubled John 14 you believe in the father Believes In Me wow when you see me you said father Oh Glory to I'm going to prepare a place for you is it right they didn't hear that outside they wouldn't understand it outside because he spoke to them in Parables but he was revealing them to revealing to these the mysteries of the Kingdom because they need to know you need to know can I that you need to know you need to know amen but abort you need to know young be belong to those that are a full age this is not the age of drinking milk this is strong be AG wo Hallelujah this is when the son of man is standing again revealing himself manifesting his presence on Hur we talk about the Rapture we're going in the Rapture let's bring it back to the right sequence can I preach this man I'm having a good time up here the prophet says before you leave here Christ has to become visible among us and then we are raise the dead and then we go in the Rapture so you want to go in the rapture and you have not seen inv visible oh brother Bley the Prophet The Prophet called schs Praise the Lord for the B of the Prophet turned water into fuel praise the Lord that was then but what about now what about now where is your testimony where is your testimony where is my testimony huh where is the word for me to prove to this world that Christ lives now my God never left 1965 my God is still here amen and Jesus said here glory to God as he get when he said to them I'm going away but I'm coming again a little while you will not see me but you shall see me a little while the world will not see me but you shall see me are you that right then he went on he said where I go you will know and the way you will know it Me Oh Glory to God remember Jesus said to them in John 16 he said I've got so many things to tell you but you can't handle it now but when I'm gone you're going to understand it God can I preach this Church 1947 to 1965 there were a billion IM message Believers basically probably none there were sponsors this is strong this is sponsors they sponsor him there they sponsor the prophet there they sponsor the prophet there the True Believers are now I of not I wasn't there W God hallelujah I wasn't there glory to God when he spoke to the storms I cannot bow hallelujah amen but I'm here now I is of not seen I wasn't there but I believe it from my heart that makes it greater than those who saw here is that right brother John we weren't there but we believe it and we are proving it that Jesus is real woo God hallelujah I felt the anointing hallel in this place woo thank you Jesus thank you Lord woo thank you Lord hallelujah Jesus Christ is here tonight oh Hallelujah showing his presence among us tonight Jesus said to the few at this time Judas left the room he said you have not choosen me but I have chosen you I ordain you to bear fruit glory to God is that right he said when I go I have to go that you get another comforter a teacher a leader that the world cannot receive oh Hallelujah but the Dynamics is changing as he was in that room lifting up his eyes to his father John 17 now that's where I reach glory to God he was changing now notice
