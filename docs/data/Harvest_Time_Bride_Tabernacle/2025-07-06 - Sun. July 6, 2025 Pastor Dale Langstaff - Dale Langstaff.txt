Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. We serve a mighty God. Amen. If you have a Bibles with me, could you turn your Bibles to the book of We're going to read some We're going to read a a ver we're going to take a verse here from Romans chapter 10 and then we're going to go into different different book of the Bible. Romans chapter 10. We're going to read a verses here. Hallelujah. Praise God. You know, I just love the Lord, saints. Amen. I just love the Lord. Hallelujah. You know, it's a ble it's a blessing. It's a blessing to live for God. Yes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know, I was reading a quote um the other day from the prophet. He said that God, listen to this saints, he said God can bring you to a place that you can live above sin. That even the devil doesn't know who doesn't know what to do with you. Hallelujah. He said that even the devil knows what to do with you. A Oh my God. I I tell her says I was moved by that. Oh my Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Romans 10. Hallelujah. We're going to look at one verse here. Hallelujah. All right. Before we look at one verse, let's look at verse 16. But they have not all obey the gospel. For Isaiah which mean Isaiah said Lord who at believe our report verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing. What does faith cometh by? Thank you. Praise God. So there's no other way faith cometh by. Faith cometh by hearing. And not just hearing. You have to hear the right things. Right. Hallelujah. And hearing by the word of God. Hallelujah. Faith cometh by hearing the word of God. Amen. Do you know that this life You can be seated as as we ask the Lord to have his blessing to his word. Hallelujah. Bless the Lord. This life that that we are now living everything we have to have faith. Amen. Your walking has to have faith. Your conversation has to have faith. Your living has to have faith. Your healing has to have faith. Hallelujah. So your healing doesn't come by just the gifts that God placed in the church, right? But if you have hearing according to the word of God, then you are entitled to receive your healing. Amen. We got to back it up the scriptures. Hallelujah. Because the Bible said, hallelujah. And these signs shall follow them that believe. Yes, sir. What do you believe? Hallelujah. Glory to God. You got to believe the word. And when I say the word, I'm not speaking about the letter. There's a difference with the letter and the word. Hallelujah. Brother, what are you talking about? Jesus said, Hallelujah. He said, the flesh profitth nothing, right? But the spirit giveth life. He said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and life." Hallelujah. One time in John 5:39, Jesus said, "Go search the scriptures." Hallelujah. For in them you think you have eternal life, and they are there testify of me. Hallelujah. What the Jewish had, they had the letter, but they didn't have the spirit, but the letter didn't profit them nothing. Glory to God. The letter could not quicken them. It takes the spirit to quicken you. That is why Jesus said to the woman at the well, the father seeketh such to worship him. The true worshipper, they must worship the father in spirit and in truth. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. I'm going to preach this morning. Remember the topic. Hallelujah. The topic. The topic is hearing and receiving and manifesting. Hallelujah. It is important to hear the right sound. All right. Hallelujah. Everything carry a sound. We see here via the piano, it carry a different sound. The drum, it carry a different sound. Everything carry a sound. So is it with the spirit of God. That's why Jesus said, "Hallelujah." The spirit moves with a sound. Hallelujah. In Acts 2 when the Bible said, "And they heard a sound of a mighty rushing wind." What was that? Was the spirit. Hallelujah. It came down with a sound. But they describe it as a as a as a mighty rushing wind. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. You know in the week the spirit said to me, hallelujah that there is a famine in the land and the famine is not for bread nor water but it's for hearing of the word of God. Hallelujah. When we look and see in the natural today and what is happening and see other countries, hallelujah, people are starving from the natural food. Everything that happens in the natural, it is happening in the spiritual. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And the spirit said there's a famine in the land. Hallelujah. for hearing the word of God. I tell you, when there's a famine, there's a malnutrition. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Your body have a malnutrition. Glory to God. You Oh, there's a painful desire. Hallelujah. It's uncomfortable. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. When you're hungry in the natural, you can't even sleep. You start to twist and turn and you're rubbing your belly. What about in the spiritual? Come on, saints. Come with me. What about in the spiritual? When you have a hallelujah, you're not supposed to sleep. Hallelujah. Homing can cause death in population. Jesus, it cause death in population. So is it in the spiritual when there's a famine for hear the word there is a death spiritual death people are dying. Amen. Hallelujah. People are dying. They have no joy. No peace. What is that? It's cost you famine. Come on. No joy. No peace. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And the word said, "Hallelujah." And the spirit said, "Hallelujah." After he tell me about the famine, he said, "Hallelujah. We're in the season of restoration." Even though there is a famine, hallelujah. God said, "I have created a season and the season is restoration." He said, "Heat in plenty. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Heat in plenty. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Getting back to the word. Brother Paul here who was preaching to the Romans in Romans chapter 10. Right. We must understand, hallelujah, that brother Paul, he was not, hallelujah, among the 12 apostles, that was selected by Jesus Christ. He came he came in other than Caesar. He came off the word. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. And the Bible said while he was speaking to them, these people in Romans, they were considered hidden. They were considered idolattors. The Roman Empire, the Roman nation, there's many gods. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. But there were believers in Romans. Hallelujah. And brother Paul who was called by the will of God to be an apostle he said I magnify my office. Hallelujah. And God sent him to the Rome. And when he wrote the letter, Hallelujah. And he wrote the letter and he sent it to the believers there. Hallelujah. He said, "Faith covered by hearing. I know what you're going through. I know the persecution you are facing as a Christian because they were converted to Christian and they were suffering persecution. But the Paul said, "I know what you're going through. I know the battles you're facing." But he said, "Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God." Hallelujah. And the word gives you victory. You can have victory over your sickness. You can have victory over your unbelief. You can have victory over your condition. You can have victory over your circumstances. Hallelujah. Because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God. And if God said you shall not die, but you shall live and declare the works of the Lord. Hallelujah. If God say that and you hear it, you act upon what he said. Hallelujah. And when you hawk upon it, it means you receive it. And when you receive it, then another thing is to manifest it. Yes. Oh my god. You manifest what you receive. You cannot manifest something that you don't receive. You only can manifest what you receive. Jesus. Am I preaching this morning? Hallelujah. Glory to God. You know, let me just give you some things that brother Paul went through. As I said, he came after the apostles. But he al suffer many things. He suffered many things. Hallelujah. In the book of Romans 8 verse 18 he said for I for I brother Paul reckon that the suffering that of this present time is not worthy he's not worthy to be compared of the glory that shall be revealed in us hallelujah Jesus no other apostles have suffered more than well upon. You're talking about a man, he was lashed 40 times. 40 times. Hallelujah. That was the Jewish punishment. Wow. To lick to lash your 40 time, right? And Hallelujah. And he was five times. Five times he was lush 40 times. Wow. Jesus. My God. I wonder why he said I bear the mark of Christ in my body. Every time brother Paul looks see those mark. He said it is for Christ. It is for the Lord Christ. I bear the mark of Christ in my body. Jesus. None of us have ever experienced that. But somebody had to experience it so that you and me and you can be here today. Hallelujah. Jesus my God. He was beaten with rods three times. You ready? You ready? You want more? Amen. Hallelujah. He was stoned in so much that he almost died. Oh my God. Oh my lord. Hallelujah. But you know what? Purpose cannot be defeated. God had a purpose in Paul life. Can I say this? Though we are suffered in this time, God have a purpose in your life. And purpose cannot be defeated. Hallelujah. When he was stoned, he was left to death. Glory to God. They left him to death. Hallelujah. But he survived. He survived. Brother Paul, he had shipwrecks. He experienced three three shipwrecks. Oh my God. Hallelujah. One one of the shipwrecks involving a night and a day a drift at sea. Talking about your day in a sea. No land, nothing around you. All you see is water. Jesus. Hallelujah. These are the things that he he encountered. These are the things he suffered for the gospel. Remember what Jesus said to Annas. This man has many things to suffer because of my name's sake. Hallelujah. Can I say this? God measure your trials. God will not give you more than what you cannot bear. God knows exactly who you are. God knows how much you can handle. Hallelujah. And how much you cannot handle. Amen. He knows. He knows everything. If he did not know, he wouldn't be God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You still love him? He was imprisonment. He was frequently in prison. one after the other. Oh God, he had hardship and deprivation. He endure hunger. He endure thirst, cold and sleep and sleepless. Hallelujah. Emotional. He has sleepless night. Hallelujah. He hunger. He felt cold. Jesus. But you know what he said? I have to manifest Christ. One of the time he said to the Galatian, he said, "Look here. I cannot leave you yet. I cannot leave you." He said, "Hallelujah." He said, "Not until I see Christ be formed in you." Jesus, my God. Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. He even though the flesh wanted to leave he said I cannot leave I must see Christ form in you when I see Christ form in you then I know that's when my purpose is been fulfilled so if if I have to suffer for 10 more years I will suffer for the gospel sake because I want to see Christ form in you sir Can can I say this? Sometimes many people have so they're so fix fixated with heaven on their mind. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. With heaven on their mind, they don't even realize they have work here on the earth to do. Hallelujah. Let me say this without apology. We cannot leave until we accomplish our work. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hearing, receiving, and manifesting. Hallelujah. The body is Christ representative on the earth. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. The body of Christ is the light of God upon the hurt. The body is the way. The body is the truth and the life. Hallelujah. You want more. Hallelujah. When we understand all of these things, brother Paul, Hallelujah. He faced opposition from both Jews and Gentiles. Hallelujah. As well as false brethren within the church. You know that there were so many false brethren within the church. They want to bring back the Judaism. Brother Paul said no. Hallelujah. One time, hallelujah, brother Paul find a young man called Timotei and he fell in love with Timotei. But Timotei mother was a Jew and his father was a Greek. Hallelujah. And they said, "Oh no, you have to be circumcised in order for us to accept you in the faith." What faith? The faith, hallelujah, was not according to Romans 10 verse 17. Hallelujah. That faith was according to Romans 10 verse1 17. Right? That faith was about the Jewish religion. It was a religion. Hallelujah. Now, brother Paul talk about in times past, you know, I suffered under the Jewish religion. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And because of what brother Paul to Timothy and circumcised him because he knew that they would not accept him. Jesus my God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Brother Paul, he carried the burden of responsibility for the well-being and spiritual growth of the churches he established. No other I no other apostle emphasize so much on growth as brother Paul. He emphasized so much on growth. Growth is important. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. The word hearing it means glory to God to be endowed with the faculty of hearing. It means to attend to. It means to consider. It means hallelujah to understand Jesus. You know that was a big problem that Jesus had with them. Turn your Bibles to St. John 10. St. John's 8 should say. Oh God, we're going to preach this morning. Amen. Hallelujah. Don't get cold on me this morning. Hallelujah. Glory to God. God have a word for us. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. St. John 8, you know, when it comes to the word, I love the word. Amen. And remember St. John 8 verse 42. But but look at verse 31st so that you can have understanding of the people that Jesus was dealing with. St. John 8:30 as he spake these words. Many believe on him. You see it? They believe. Did they receive him? No. No, they believe but they did not receive him. We're going to come to that. Remember the topic hearing, receiving, and manifesting. Let me say this. Let me just drop this in before I go even further. Even the devil believe on God. Yes, sir. He does. If you know the Bible, the Bible said the devil believe that there's one God and he trembles. Trembles. Amen. Oh my God. Yes sir. Verse 31. Then said Jesus to those Jews. Look at it. Jews. In this time there were two kingdoms. Yeah. You have the kingdom of Israel. Yeah. And the kingdom of Judah, right? The kingdom of of the kingdom of Judah consists of two and a half tribe. And the kingdom of Israel consists of nine and a half tribe. So so these person that were considered Jews, they were of Judah. And in order for Jesus to go to Israel, he had to pass over Jordan. Right. Jesus did most of his ministry in Jew in Jerusalem. But he wasn't brought up in Jerusalem. He was brought up in the kingdom of Israel. Because Bethlehem comes from Israel, right? Hallelujah. Glory to God. Talking about Galilee. Galilee. He was brought up in Galilee. Yes. Yes. And Galilee located in Israel kingdom in Israel providence. Hallelujah. And the Bible said he said to them that believe. Now remember the Bible said they believe on him. So because you believe Hallelujah. Look at this now. Because you believe. Hallelujah. You have to continue. If you continue in my word, sir, this this word is mean divine utterance. If you con, if you continue in my divine utterance, the word continue means to abide. It means to stay. It means to remain. Jesus my God. Hallelujah. He said then are you my disciples indeed. Jesus. Isn't that the Bible? Yeah. So if you don't continue, how can you be the disciples indeed? Yes sir. Now we understand where Mark 16 said, hallelujah. He that believeth and is baptized shall be Jesus Christ. You see that word shall be? It's a big big big statement. Hallelujah. Shall be. That word shall be mean going unto. That's right. Jesus shall be saved. Oh my God. He said verse 32. And you the disciples indeed know you know it takes the disciples indeed to know the truth. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Verse 32. And you shall know the truth and the truth make you free. That word know you have to recognize it. Right. Recognize the day and its message and its day. Recognize the day, the message and the messenger. Jesus was the messenger for their day. Right. Yes, sir. He was the angel of the covenant for their day. But they did not recognize him. That's why I said if you don't believe that I am he, you shall die in your sins. And that sins is speaking of unbelief. The sins was a fornication. It was adulterous. These are just attribute of sin. Sin is unbelief. Amen. The Bible said after his resurrection and he appeared before them in the room, he said the Bible said he obeed them because of their unbelief. Amen. Right. Yeah. Unbelief. Hallelujah. Many times we see people today, they're still trapped in the unbelief. And because they're still trapped in the unbelief, that's why they're still not yet free. Wow. Jesus. My God. Hallelujah. Look at verse 23. And they answered him. We be Abraham's seed. Oh, look at it now. He said, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." Right? Here what they said. Now look at these. You see typical religious people. Religious people. Look at this response. Shows you that this is a religious response. will be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage. God God to any manow sayest thou you shall be made free Jesus my God. Hallelujah. Look at that religious response to Jesus. All right. Amen. Jump down to verse 43. Hallelujah. Verse 43. Why do you not understand my speech? Jesus asks a question and he's going to answer them. Even because you cannot hear my word. They had this. Hallelujah. They had this but they cannot hear. They couldn't hear his word. His word was a divine utterance. Amen. It was a divine speech but they could not they could not hear it. Hallelujah. Because they didn't have the faculty. They didn't have the faculty to understand it. It takes a seed of God because the word of faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and faith is a seed. say takes the seed to hear. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. He said, you cannot hear my word. Verse 47, he that is of God heareth God's word. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. He therefore hear them not because you're not of God. Hallelujah. You hear that? So no matter where, if you're in the pig pen and when God speak, if you are of God, you will hear. If you are under the sea and God speak, if you are of God, you will hear. Amen. No matter where you are, nothing can stop you from hearing God's word. Amen. Jesus, my Lord. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. No barriers, no boundaries can stop it. Hallelujah. No boundary can stop you from hearing God's word. Hallelujah. Because there's something inside of you. There is something inside of you. And when you hear you responded, it bring out a responding to that hearing and you start to follow. My sheep hear my voice. Hallelujah. John 10:27. My sheep hear my voice and I know them Jesus. and a stranger voice they hear not and they follow me. Hallelujah. So whether you're suffering, whether you're being persecuted, nothing can stop you from following Christ. [Applause] As the word of God said, nothing can able to separate you from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. No peril, no pestilence, no famine, no sword, nothing can separate you. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Because there's something inside of you. Hallelujah. The songwriter said, "There's something inside of me telling me to go on, to go on. You're pressing on because God is pulling you." Hallelujah. Jesus, my Lord. So, you know, but I tell you, don't complain to God about the environment you're in. You know, you know, we like to complain a lot. If we are in a certain home and things are not going on good, we start to complain. If God put us in a certain job, Hallelujah. and we don't like it, we complain. If God pull us or give us a a type of vehicle and the vehicle is giving trouble, we start to complain. You know, we complain too much, it's time we stop complain and start to give God some worship. Hallelujah. Give God some worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm tired of this home. Hallelujah. Everything is falling apart in this home. Hallelujah. If we just understand the power of praise, if we just understand the power of praise, do you know that your praise, Hallelujah, your praise, your revelation, your understanding of the word can speak things into existence. Yes sir. Jesus my the other day I was the Lord gave me a topic. The Lord give me a topic and the topic is five manifestation of the faith that was given unto the saints. Five manifestation of the faith. Man, when I when that when the Lord gave me that topic, I said my God. Hallelujah. I was so excited. Five manifestation. One of the one of the manifestation is salvation. Salvation is a twofold coming out of and going into Jesus my God. One of the other manifestation of the faith is resurrection. Right. resurrection. Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life." Jeez. Amen. I don't want to jump into that topic. Let me just get back to the topic. That is for another time. Hallelujah. You know, sometimes we get excited. We can get carried away. Glory to God. Hallelujah. You still love him. Hallelujah. So hear it. You have the difficulty to understand because there's a seed in you. Hallelujah. And you know that when when the seed of God in you, there's a frequency. There's a a communication between you and the spirit. Not even the person beside you can know it. No wonder why the father said, "Hallelujah. Glory to God. The spirit beth witness with your spirit that we are the sons of God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. God, because there's a frequency Yes, sir. that even the person beside you can testify that you are sons of God. But the spirit bear witness with your spirit. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Receive The word receive, hallelujah, it comes from the Greek word the trauma which mean to take with the hand. Hallelujah. It means to take hold of. It means to take up. Hallelujah. It means to embrace. It means approve. See you look at that word approve. Approve. You know that when God approve you, when God approve you, nobody can stop you. Saints of God. I'm going to deal with some spirit here. Hallelujah. When you are being approved by God, nothing can stop you. Do you know that God approve you? Amen. God approve you the Bible said hallelujah. He said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. What is that greater? That's God approval of you. It's God approve you. Hallelujah. Greater than he that is in the world. What are the things that in the world that is coming to get rid of you that are your enemy? sickness, diseases, death, these things.

Who give you this authority to forgive sin? He said even the son of power. Yes sir. Hallelujah. He said no rain until I say so because God approve him. That's right. Hallelujah. Another thing, when you're approved by God, you're not rejected. So when you feel like you're sick, don't listen to the enemy that feel like your prayer is being rejected. That's a lie. When you approve you're not rejected. Amen. Don't you pray. Brother Paul had to pray because he had a thorn in the flesh. Right. That was one of the suffering. Hallelujah. That was one of his suffering. But he said this suffering, Hallelujah. He is not worthy to compare of the glory that shall be revealed in me. Hallelujah. Glory to God. So many times many times we feel like our prayers been rejected but our prayers is not rejected because you approved by God. Yes. Hallelujah. We need to shift the moment. We need to shift the scene and start to worship God. We start to give some praise. We need to shift the atmosphere. We need to shift it. You know sometimes if you feel like your prayer is not going nowhere in the home, you need to take the you need to give the home a walk. You need to go outside, walk around the house, start to pray, and even if you have to go in your vehicle, just get in the vehicle. You just need to change the mood. God said to John, "John, come and take the book." God had to leave from where he was to go and take the book. So sometimes we just need a little changing. We need a change. We need to change the mood. Oh, sometimes God said you're laying down too much. Sometimes it's it's time it's time to rise up. It's time to walk. It's time to it's time to march. Sometime we're standing up praying and God said I don't want you to stand up. I want you to march. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I want you to march around Jericho seven times. Hallelujah. Marching time. Lord have mercy. Hallelujah. You are approved by God. That's right. Amen. What the script? Let's find what the scripture said about being of proof. John 1 verse 12. Hallelujah. Oh, praise God. Amen.

In Acts chapter one, Jesus said, "Do not leave Jerusalem until you receive power from an eye." Amen. What did they receive? The Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost they receive. So the power of God is the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. No wonder why brother Paul said even faith is your victory. Hallelujah. And we have overcome the world. Why faith? Because faith is our victory.

Did you know? Did you know when God sent them to go fight against the enemy, hallelujah, there was just praising. All they all they bring as the the the weapon or the tool you would say was instrument of praise. Instrument of praise. It brought confusion in the camp of the enemy. There was wonder what is happening. Amen. Your praise. God will use your praise to defeat the enemy. God will use it to confound the enemy. Jesus. My God. Thank you, Lord. No wonder why the Bible say God he dwelt. He dwelt in the praise of his people. He dwelt in the praise of his people. And that's why I hear somebody say when the praises go up, the blessing comes down. Hallelujah. The blessing comes down. Two things. You can have the blessing comes down and you can go up there to meet the blessing. Hallelujah. You're talking about two dimension. Two dimension. The blessings come down and you have to go up there to get the blessings. Amen. The Bible said in Ephesians 1, hallelujah, he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places. Amen.
