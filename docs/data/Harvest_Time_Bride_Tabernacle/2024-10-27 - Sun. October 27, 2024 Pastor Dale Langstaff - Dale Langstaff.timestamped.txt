[28:58] sister Leah special was beautiful
[29:02] because God's not looking at it being
[29:04] perfect God's looking at the love that
[29:07] it took to come up and worship him and
[29:11] the ability that God's gave her amen and
[29:15] anybody can do that you know I I went
[29:17] and got my phone because I had a picture
[29:20] I might show you and in uh but you know
[29:24] just you just wait on the leading of God
[29:26] I might show it on a Wednesday
[29:28] tonight but brother brandham is
[29:31] preaching in his service and he has
[29:34] about 25 or 20 young people playing
[29:38] around the foot of the
[29:40] pulpit you didn't think your Prophet
[29:42] would do that but I have a picture of it
[29:45] and the picture is blurred because the
[29:47] children are moving their
[29:52] arms see God loves
[29:55] children God loves children and the
[29:57] prophet Propet love children you know
[29:59] we're watching on Wednesday night you
[30:00] know if you miss Wednesday and if you
[30:02] have to miss it it's okay but if you
[30:04] don't have to you really miss the move
[30:06] of God cuz some of our best services are
[30:09] on
[30:10] Wednesday and uh we listen to a tape
[30:14] very we did something different we
[30:15] listened to a tape of brother Donnie
[30:17] Reagan preaching and we're going to
[30:19] finish it this
[30:21] Sunday and I know what that tape's going
[30:23] to say but almost half of the tape the
[30:26] prophet changes
[30:28] the
[30:29] service even cancel
[30:32] service because of the
[30:36] children amen amen that's how God spoke
[30:39] to him and his whole
[30:44] Ministry was circled around the children
[30:46] amen let's just go to uh John 1 1
[30:51] 1-5
[30:53] amen I pray that God will bless you this
[30:56] morning just got covet your prayers I
[30:59] been dealing with a bit of an earache
[31:00] for two or 3 weeks and I went to the
[31:04] doctor and they never had no ear drops
[31:06] that the doctor ordered to give me in
[31:08] Ontario or maybe
[31:11] wherever but God is an awesome God and
[31:14] also we cover your prayers coming up
[31:16] soon we'll be going to El Salvador and
[31:20] the trip and and just we we covet your
[31:23] prayers because we're not going in the
[31:24] flesh we're going by the leading of God
[31:27] and
[31:28] just that God will do what he wants to
[31:31] do
[31:32] amen amen I want to I want to preach on
[31:35] judging
[31:37] God judging God this morning in the
[31:41] beginning was the word and the Word was
[31:43] with God and the Word was
[31:46] God and the same was in the beginning
[31:49] with God and all things were made by him
[31:53] now I want to just stop there for a
[31:54] second just I know you're standing but
[31:57] let's just comprehend this that
[32:00] everything good and bad in this Earth
[32:04] was made by
[32:06] God all things were made by God and
[32:10] without him was
[32:13] not
[32:16] anything made that was made now that
[32:19] means that he made the things that you
[32:21] don't
[32:22] like Amen in him was life and and the
[32:28] life was the light now we know that any
[32:31] living creature is how they can do xrays
[32:35] because you have light in your body if
[32:38] you're alive so the Bible is just so
[32:41] perfect amen and the light is the
[32:47] life of men and the light shineth in
[32:50] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[32:52] us not let's just jump to verse 12 but
[32:55] as many as received him gave he power to
[33:02] become
[33:03] sons of
[33:06] God now that could be people that you
[33:09] don't
[33:12] like even them that believeth on his
[33:15] name and this is verse 13 shows it here
[33:19] which were not born not of the
[33:23] blood nor of the
[33:25] will of religious men
[33:28] of the
[33:29] flesh nor of the will of man but of the
[33:35] will of God lord Jesus we pray that you
[33:39] will Minister what you've laid on my
[33:42] heart and and Lord may you be with the
[33:44] speaker and the hearer and may nothing
[33:46] be spoken that that isn't in part of
[33:49] your plan predestinated plan Lord God
[33:52] and we love you and we're only here to
[33:54] fulfill what you've already seen before
[33:57] the found foundation of the world and we
[34:00] give you the glory for it in your name
[34:02] amen you may have your seats this
[34:03] morning you know brother Junior preached
[34:05] last Sunday and and I was tremendously
[34:08] blessed because uh tremendously blessed
[34:11] and he just touched I'm going to read
[34:12] later on a scripture that you touched on
[34:16] brother Junior's preaching in Kitchener
[34:18] this morning I believe and and uh but
[34:21] you know we as Believers sometimes well
[34:25] we're still human so we are disappointed
[34:28] appointed and and uh and we we find
[34:31] things that happen that disappoint us
[34:33] even through our understanding of the
[34:39] word now let me let me resay that now as
[34:42] Believers we have things that happen
[34:45] that disappoint us with our
[34:50] understanding of
[34:52] God now now I got hard Bible for this so
[34:56] you're in trouble
[34:58] now let me give you an example under
[35:01] what kind of a circumstances would
[35:03] Joshua send his deacons to a wh
[35:13] house that the will of God would be
[35:17] fulfilled now your Prophet said that
[35:20] when Jesus had an appointed time with
[35:22] the woman at the well that the disciples
[35:25] doubted that he was
[35:28] Jehovah because he
[35:33] spoke and he had to have discernment and
[35:37] if he really knew who she was he would
[35:40] never be
[35:44] communicating and that proves that the
[35:47] disciples understanding of Jesus Christ
[35:51] was wrong
[35:59] and my understanding of Jesus Christ has
[36:02] been wrong many
[36:04] times and so has yours I'll just say it
[36:07] for you to help you out because see when
[36:11] somebody you know we get so
[36:15] religious and and I mean I mean say this
[36:18] but you know brother Bram said multiple
[36:20] times that we don't have a thought
[36:21] coming he said that about a dozen times
[36:23] and he also said that God don't need you
[36:27] to fill his plan in his
[36:30] kingdom now he does if you're
[36:32] surrendered to
[36:33] him but you see what I mean but see we
[36:37] it's brother Dale and God help you if
[36:40] you knew me when I was young but we get
[36:42] a religious spirit around us and when
[36:44] somebody makes a mistakes or God forbid
[36:47] even
[36:52] sins we are the first ones not to talk
[36:55] to them not to fellowship with avoid
[36:58] them and throw them out of the
[37:03] building and the Bible says this now
[37:05] watch let me just lay a foundation here
[37:07] he said but he said you see in the world
[37:10] so as it is in the church we're trying
[37:13] to build something that God don't need
[37:17] your help to
[37:19] build
[37:21] hello now I I I'm going to tell you
[37:24] something brother Dale is still
[37:25] struggling with this because the thing I
[37:27] love love the most I don't fully I can't
[37:30] hardly get my head around and that's
[37:31] predestination
[37:35] election because an election if you're
[37:38] God's you know let me just let me just
[37:41] dramatize this for you a bit can you
[37:43] comprehend the thief on the cross when
[37:46] he got up to heaven now come with me on
[37:48] is this all right come with me on if it
[37:50] ain't it's too bad for you you come with
[37:51] me on this journey the thief on the
[37:53] cross comes up there and they say hello
[37:55] how are you and he says and he said well
[37:58] how would I know that you're qualified
[38:00] to come into heaven now I I know I know
[38:04] the Lamb's Book of Life but just come
[38:05] with me and they said well tell me what
[38:07] the Seal's Revelation was and he said
[38:10] the Seal's who he said well tell me who
[38:14] baptized you in the water baptism they
[38:15] said what what
[38:18] water what well tell me what the
[38:20] Evangelist theme was that preached a
[38:22] powerful message and you came to the
[38:24] Altar and give your heart and got the
[38:25] baptism to what Holy Ghost
[38:35] and they say well you're at the wrong
[38:37] gate you're supposed to go to the gate
[38:39] down the
[38:46] road cuz that
[38:48] Thief didn't know one
[38:51] thing of what you hold dear not one
[38:56] single
[38:58] thing he didn't even know that Jesus was
[39:01] the Christ he just knew that he was
[39:04] being
[39:06] unworthily
[39:11] killed
[39:13] whoa what in the world are we going to
[39:16] do with that
[39:21] scripture he says God don't need your
[39:23] help to build his
[39:25] kingdom God just wanted you to preach a
[39:28] word and he'll do the
[39:33] building he's the architect and he's got
[39:36] the plans all laid out now that the
[39:40] oness union is 58 now let's just read
[39:43] our text scripture here now Romans
[39:48] 9:19 and God you know God brings
[39:51] messages like this and when I found this
[39:54] scripture in a very peculiar way
[39:58] and it just
[40:00] exploded in my
[40:03] face here's God
[40:06] saying to us thou say then unto
[40:10] me why does he still find
[40:16] fault why do you as message Believers
[40:20] find
[40:21] fault with the plan of
[40:24] God now now see and I can answer that
[40:27] because we're disappointed that
[40:30] somebody backslid made a
[40:34] mistake
[40:36] was a woman at the well was and and and
[40:41] and I understand those
[40:43] disappointments because you know because
[40:45] of the pride and shame in our family we
[40:48] want our kids to be all angels and
[40:51] millionaires we say oh there goes my
[40:54] kids look at them they're successful
[40:56] they're sting on the front Ru on church
[40:59] and they all
[41:01] got but maybe God's
[41:04] plan was to make them be
[41:10] losers God's
[41:12] plan
[41:17] okay let let's go to verse
[41:20] 20 now now here this is God speaking now
[41:23] he's speaking through Paul here that
[41:25] wrote Romans n but oh man
[41:27] Thou Art Thou that repliest against
[41:36] God God's election now I'm talking about
[41:39] replying against God's election s the
[41:42] things formed say unto God the person
[41:46] that formed it why hast Thou made my
[41:49] kids a
[41:51] failure why have you made my church a
[41:54] failure why have you made
[41:58] anything in your
[42:01] opinion the things formed say unto him
[42:05] say unto God that formed it why hast
[42:08] Thou made me like I
[42:11] am why did God make me fat short and
[42:15] have a baked
[42:20] mouth the Bible is saying the Believers
[42:23] who could get by any thought add one
[42:26] cubic to your statue now verse 21 hasth
[42:29] not the Potter
[42:31] power over his creation the clay and of
[42:36] some lumps he makes a vessel of
[42:40] Glory Hallelujah and another Of
[42:45] Dishonor now I tell you what you don't
[42:48] know who the dishonor
[42:50] is until you get
[42:53] there because if you would have been
[42:55] following the thief's life on on the
[42:57] cross I imagine he was more than a thief
[43:01] he probably did some lying he probably
[43:04] did some other you know like that kind
[43:06] of attracts a certain group of people
[43:10] and so if you would have been following
[43:11] his life and you had missed the one day
[43:14] that his judgment came you would have
[43:16] said well he's in
[43:20] hell and you were disbelieving God's
[43:23] plan you were
[43:25] judging God
[43:29] now watch this verse
[43:31] 23 and he that might make known The
[43:34] Riches of his glory to the on the
[43:38] vessels of Mercy Amazing Grace Grace is
[43:43] oh
[43:45] amazing which he had aord prepared unto
[43:51] Glory
[43:53] even
[43:55] you us me
[43:57] whom he has called not of just the
[44:02] Jews only that was his Lage is is is
[44:06] Earthly but also the Gentiles as he
[44:09] saith also in is
[44:12] Hosea I will call my people which were
[44:16] not good people not my people and her
[44:23] beloved which was not beloved
[44:27] how can we judge God you know see we're
[44:32] here to we're here because we're come
[44:34] from God and we'll
[44:36] prove in our
[44:39] life that there will
[44:41] be one the second bride will never fall
[44:46] but you might fall down your whole life
[44:49] until your last
[44:51] day until your last
[44:54] day what did Paul say the greatest
[44:57] messenger in the New
[45:00] Testament I fall I Die
[45:03] daily he may he had he had The Thorn In
[45:06] the Flesh amen watch this verse 29 and
[45:09] we'll move on from the scripture and as
[45:12] I Isaiah said before except the lord of
[45:15] the Sabbath had left us a
[45:21] seed you had have been as
[45:23] Sodom and had have been like onto
[45:28] gamorra and you know in our fleshly
[45:32] vessel it is so itches is human nature
[45:37] to have an
[45:38] opinion and to have an opinion is to
[45:44] judge because you can say well God I
[45:47] mean as a minister or you as people you
[45:50] say well God I mean like you have to
[45:54] understand that like God how come the
[45:55] church ain't full we got the truth
[45:58] God how come the church starts how come
[46:00] do we go how come how come how come DS
[46:05] the pastor how come how come we have
[46:07] church at 10 how come think of whatever
[46:10] your how come
[46:18] is let's just read the scripture in a
[46:21] Hosea 2:23 it says and I God will so sow
[46:26] her
[46:29] unto me and the Earth he's meaning like
[46:31] planter and I will have mercy upon her
[46:34] that hasth not attain mercy so here God
[46:37] saying in his word of God that the last
[46:40] person you believe that'll be in heaven
[46:42] will be
[46:44] there the very dead Li he say I know he
[46:48] was he was he was no good he or she was
[46:52] no
[46:53] good and God says right here in Hosea he
[46:55] said I will have mercy upon her that
[47:00] hath not obtained Mercy see you know who
[47:02] they didn't obtain Mercy from was the
[47:07] Believers but God stepped over brother
[47:09] Dale and said I still love
[47:12] them and I said I don't like that oh I
[47:16] know you've said the same thing come on
[47:17] help me
[47:20] out well it wouldn't be in the word of
[47:22] God Paul wouldn't have put it in there
[47:23] why are you judging
[47:25] God because see this game ain't over
[47:27] until it's
[47:31] over amen and watch this and I will say
[47:35] unto them which were not my people that
[47:39] means they didn't attend
[47:41] church they were not in the family of
[47:44] God you
[47:46] thought God says that were not my people
[47:49] Thou Art my people and they shall
[47:53] say that thou art my
[47:55] God
[47:57] wow why do we be in God's creation see I
[48:02] can answer that because you're an
[48:04] amateure God and you you know H how do
[48:08] young people you know when they're
[48:10] invisible and they're 14 think they can
[48:12] walk in front of trains and semis and it
[48:13] won't hurt them because they're they
[48:16] feel like they they've never felt pain
[48:19] they they they're they're very
[48:22] unwise and they feel like they're
[48:26] invisible ible Invincible or whatever
[48:28] the word
[48:32] is but us with the baptism of the Holy
[48:36] Ghost understanding election and
[48:39] predestination can look at somebody that
[48:41] don't measure up to our Statute in what
[48:43] we understand of the
[48:46] word and think we're
[48:51] invisible and they're not
[48:58] God help us let's read a thought where
[49:01] he said this he said you ain't got no
[49:03] thought coming thought or think coming
[49:05] he said the Bible said let this mind be
[49:08] in you that was in
[49:10] Christ the mind that was in Christ being
[49:13] in you and he always did that which
[49:15] pleases the father because he was the
[49:18] word and so we know that that we have no
[49:21] thought coming and we must just believe
[49:25] what he says
[49:28] now I that's beautiful but you know we
[49:31] can read the we can I can read the
[49:33] scriptures and and and and and the
[49:36] message and show it and people say oh
[49:38] well he didn't mean that or well well
[49:41] what about the
[49:43] other now wait a minute like we we we
[49:46] got to set the absolute and then we'll
[49:49] abide by the absolute I'm giving you
[49:51] Bible I gave you
[49:54] message but we want to read a different
[49:57] a different
[50:09] message he said you say wait well I
[50:13] can't this is continuing this quote he
[50:16] says in investment 63 he said this
[50:19] person is you know how brother
[50:20] ministering says well I you say I can't
[50:25] explain it
[50:27] and this has got to be close to the best
[50:29] thing that ever happened to me he says
[50:33] no and if you could then you couldn't
[50:37] explain God you don't know God by being
[50:41] smart intellectual
[50:44] conception he said you know God by
[50:48] faith and it is the only way that you'll
[50:51] know how to believe
[50:53] God he said you can't
[50:57] explain
[50:59] God so all those preachers that are
[51:03] really smart well praise God I can still
[51:06] keep
[51:08] preaching watch how he explains this he
[51:10] said you can't explain God he said no
[51:13] one can amen wait a
[51:18] minute it watch this now no I'm still
[51:21] reading by the way he said it's not for
[51:24] you to explain
[51:27] he said no nobody can explain God and
[51:30] it's without finding out by expect
[51:34] expectation ex explaining it you got to
[51:37] believe him and if you
[51:40] wouldn't if it wouldn't be that way then
[51:43] there's no more
[51:45] faith now you've got to just
[51:48] believe that God
[51:51] has a predestinated elected plan and so
[51:55] you see we we and and and and I I'm not
[51:58] preaching that you can go sin and God
[52:00] will save you that ain't the case cuz if
[52:02] you do it willfully that's a uh you know
[52:05] it's just proven who you are iniquity is
[52:09] to to sin willfully and and do
[52:12] it but we're not
[52:16] judges you know that it's so easy for us
[52:19] to believe Paul was a greatest messenger
[52:21] of Grace but Paul was killing
[52:24] Christians and had the government back
[52:26] ping for it I wouldn't vote him in as my
[52:31] pastor and neither would have
[52:36] you let's just turn to Romans 8:28 and
[52:39] we're going to read just a few and this
[52:41] is where Junior picked up the the
[52:43] thought that was just so beautiful so
[52:46] what I'm trying to say is God is is
[52:50] omnipotent and he's God and we're his
[52:53] children now I'm going to read some
[52:54] quotes for multiple times multiple
[52:57] multiple times brother Braham says this
[52:59] you're God's children and let him take
[53:02] care of the children yeah not
[53:07] me not
[53:11] me because he knows what children are
[53:13] his and only God can deal with his own
[53:19] children he said Romans 8:28 and we're
[53:22] going to skip around here some I'll tell
[53:23] you where we're going he said and you
[53:25] know that all things work together for
[53:27] good to them that love God to him that
[53:29] is called according to his purpose now
[53:31] you mean all the ministers that left the
[53:33] message and quit preaching and all the
[53:35] people that aren't sit aren't maybe
[53:37] attending church right now that's that's
[53:39] that's that's
[53:43] good all the churches that fell apart
[53:46] because a godly man died and and and and
[53:49] Satan come in and divided them and that
[53:51] and that was part of God's plan
[53:57] that's hard for me to say but
[54:00] uh-huh yeah that was part of God's plan
[54:03] do I understand oh no way do I
[54:06] understand God no way I don't understand
[54:08] them I
[54:10] don't all things work together all the
[54:13] all the hardships in your life that were
[54:16] on
[54:18] Christian and on
[54:21] just was for your good and God allowed
[54:25] it what
[54:28] wow I say let's read on find out about
[54:30] this God verse 31 and what shall we say
[54:34] then to these
[54:36] things if God be for us who can be
[54:39] against
[54:41] us let's jump down to 33 and I'm not
[54:44] trying to skip any words I'm just trying
[54:46] to hit a a main point here and who shall
[54:49] lay
[54:51] anything to the
[54:54] charge of Gods
[54:58] elect I want to show
[55:02] you an example would that be
[55:06] okay the church message deacons brought
[55:10] a sister that was caught in the very Act
[55:13] of
[55:17] adultery and they said God the Bible
[55:22] says Giller
[55:27] I'm like I'm one of the
[55:32] deacons come on that's Bible help me
[55:36] preach you'd be one of the deacons too
[55:39] bless God that's
[55:41] unscriptural I love that
[55:43] Doctrine that's
[55:46] unscriptural and Jesus ignored
[55:52] them I said right in now now now wait
[55:55] let me just I felt felt something no I'm
[55:57] not condoning
[55:59] adultery oh no no I'm not condoning
[56:02] adultery
[56:04] no but I'm saying you can't get a gr
[56:07] your three PB brain if you're a genius
[56:10] can't comprehend the God I'm
[56:13] serving because if it could I have a
[56:16] different
[56:19] God and Jesus rose up and he said
[56:23] who that has not sinned in the past
[56:28] can
[56:34] kill
[56:36] uhhuh and Spirits don't
[56:41] die Spirits don't
[56:45] die and they were supernaturally pricked
[56:49] in their
[56:51] conscience and they
[56:53] left and Jesus said
[56:57] where are the Believers that were
[57:00] accusing
[57:02] you now you say how did you say they
[57:04] were believers they were Church going
[57:06] message Believers at that
[57:11] day does brother Bale fully comprehend
[57:14] that s i don't you going to go have to
[57:17] ask somebody a lot smarter than
[57:19] me am I condoning it absolutely
[57:23] not it would break my heart
[57:32] wow you say well this was a unique case
[57:35] well you know I feel sorry for you
[57:38] because I just showed you four unique
[57:40] cases let everything be established by
[57:42] two or three Witnesses see I'm just
[57:44] saying we I I know that in our day the
[57:47] Mysteries are
[57:48] revealed I am the seventh
[57:52] seal Christ is come down yeah yeah but I
[57:57] still can't comprehend
[58:01] everything and don't even pretend like
[58:03] it to me because if you can I don't want
[58:06] to fellowship with you
[58:12] ever
[58:14] wow I'm saying that you know you know
[58:18] and I never did it you know for one
[58:22] week on a regular basis maybe we'll do
[58:26] do it at the end God told me you need to
[58:28] have the people make a
[58:30] circle and pray for our
[58:33] gathering he told me that in the
[58:35] beginning of the week he told me that in
[58:36] the middle of the
[58:39] week because without Christ we'll eat
[58:42] each
[58:44] other because see we all had different
[58:48] parents and we all different things
[58:51] grilled into our conscience as
[58:54] children and you can't bring that
[58:56] forward and Minister that to
[59:00] me and and even if you bring Christ
[59:03] forward he's more than the word cuz the
[59:06] letter kth but the spirit giveth
[59:12] life but I'm not saying leave the
[59:15] word you see we're in a bit of a pickle
[59:26] let's go finish our verse here who has
[59:28] laid anything to the charge of God's
[59:31] elect is it God that
[59:35] justifies you know if we had the
[59:37] characteristic of our
[59:39] daddy our heavenly father wanted all of
[59:42] his children to
[59:46] succeed and we shouldn't be the one
[59:48] picking out who they are and who they
[59:51] aren't amen verse
[59:54] 34 who is he
[59:57] that
[59:59] condemneth well bless God the Bible says
[1:00:03] well bless God I found a quote who is
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:11] person wasn't it
[1:00:14] Christ that died or was it
[1:00:19] you yay rather wasn't it him that rose
[1:00:24] again and and who is even at the right
[1:00:27] hand of God which means Authority and
[1:00:28] power he is God and is also he's making
[1:00:33] the
[1:00:35] intercession for the ones that we don't
[1:00:37] think measure up to be a
[1:00:40] part of our click
[1:00:48] group
[1:00:51] wow so God's interceding
[1:00:57] for these examples I sent you and the
[1:01:00] Believers are bringing them to
[1:01:03] him he watch this he said you know here
[1:01:06] in a quote here he said Satan couldn't
[1:01:08] take him he said Satan couldn't drown
[1:01:10] Noah until the purpose of God was
[1:01:12] finished he couldn't burn the Hebrew
[1:01:14] children until the purpose of God was
[1:01:16] finished and he couldn't kill job with
[1:01:17] boils and troubles till the purpose of
[1:01:19] God was finished and neither can he kill
[1:01:22] Daniel with lions until the purpose of
[1:01:25] God was finished see there's a purpose
[1:01:28] you know what there's actually a purpose
[1:01:30] in
[1:01:31] sin there's a perp you want to know one
[1:01:34] of the purpose that God could be a
[1:01:39] savior there's a purpose in somebody
[1:01:41] being able to fall down can you imagine
[1:01:44] they could get redeemed
[1:01:46] again that's amazing grace and
[1:01:51] mercy he said neither could the D the
[1:01:53] lions eat Daniel until the purpose of
[1:01:55] God was finished and neither could death
[1:01:57] in old age take Abraham who was a liar
[1:02:01] until the purpose of God was finished I
[1:02:03] know you didn't like that but he
[1:02:04] actually was see you know when they
[1:02:05] wrote the the the theology or whatever
[1:02:08] you say the history of Abraham's life in
[1:02:10] the New
[1:02:12] Testament they never even mentioned you
[1:02:15] want you want to I I I was meditating on
[1:02:17] this you know Abraham was so
[1:02:21] uh an example of us when hard times came
[1:02:25] in Israel he left the
[1:02:28] church he left the
[1:02:31] message wait a minute Father Abraham
[1:02:34] left the
[1:02:36] message because the Israelites when they
[1:02:38] leave their home country are immediately
[1:02:41] out of the will of God and they had a
[1:02:43] famine they weren't seeing no gifts of
[1:02:45] the spirits in the church so he said I'm
[1:02:47] going to go over to the ones that are
[1:02:49] making them
[1:02:51] up so he left the
[1:02:54] message yeah and then he lied because he
[1:02:57] was afraid because he left the
[1:03:00] message
[1:03:04] amen and when God wrote the history
[1:03:07] about Abraham he forgot all that
[1:03:12] part and you remembering my
[1:03:24] past wow
[1:03:26] can you figure that God
[1:03:31] out and neither can it
[1:03:34] take the same quote and neither can it
[1:03:37] take you or can it take me until the
[1:03:41] purpose of God is finished in your life
[1:03:45] so I so we
[1:03:48] gather from there this
[1:03:52] Comfort why does God let
[1:03:56] troubles come in amongst
[1:04:06] us why would he do
[1:04:09] that would not God want a perfect
[1:04:16] family I
[1:04:18] mean let me read why does God let
[1:04:22] troubles come in
[1:04:28] God you want to know why God harnesses
[1:04:32] the
[1:04:34] trouble and puts a bits in its mouth I
[1:04:37] want to stop right there you can serve
[1:04:40] Satan all you want you're still going to
[1:04:41] bring glory to God if it's his purpose
[1:04:44] you go right ahead and Seed Wild Oats
[1:04:46] you're going to have a lot of days of
[1:04:48] sad days you're going to have a lot of
[1:04:49] days of crying you're going to have a
[1:04:50] lot of days of repentance like the Jews
[1:04:52] are going to when they recognize their
[1:04:54] Messiah they're going to whail and
[1:04:55] ferment and that look at look at look
[1:04:57] look at Joseph when the type of Christ
[1:05:00] when he revealed himself to the Brethren
[1:05:02] the Bible says the whole country heard
[1:05:05] them wailing and crying because they had
[1:05:08] recognized the mess
[1:05:10] up that they had willfully made he said
[1:05:14] God harnesses that trouble and he puts a
[1:05:17] bit in your mouth and makes you obey
[1:05:23] him and those trouble bring those
[1:05:26] troubles that are in our midst which
[1:05:30] there is not maybe they're unspoken
[1:05:32] troubles bring us
[1:05:35] closer to
[1:05:39] God
[1:05:43] wow I'm going to stop praying to be
[1:05:46] close to
[1:05:48] God come
[1:05:50] on
[1:05:52] cuz well nobody else put their hand up
[1:05:56] but if you pray to be closer to
[1:05:58] God the only way to get you there is to
[1:06:01] send troubles in your
[1:06:03] circle and you thought it was
[1:06:06] Satan and you thought it was
[1:06:10] Satan
[1:06:12] who can you imagine when God hit me with
[1:06:14] this brick I was just like whoa God wait
[1:06:19] wait a minute I have to
[1:06:23] investigate now I just tell you
[1:06:25] something
[1:06:26] there ain't no way in 10 million Worlds
[1:06:30] the brother Dale got this Revelation or
[1:06:33] this thought or this message by being
[1:06:36] smart or could I couldn't even imagine
[1:06:39] to make this
[1:06:41] up so you can take that for whatever
[1:06:44] it's
[1:06:44] worth but if you don't believe in God
[1:06:47] using
[1:06:49] people to show his will I feel sorry for
[1:06:53] you cuz I couldn't even pretend to
[1:06:55] figure this
[1:06:59] out why does God let troubles come in
[1:07:01] because he harnesses the troubles puts a
[1:07:04] bit in its mouth and makes it obey him
[1:07:07] and these troubles bring us closer into
[1:07:12] fellowship
[1:07:13] with
[1:07:15] god
[1:07:20] wow you mean all those nights sleep I
[1:07:23] was worrying about
[1:07:25] what God was allowing to happen and I
[1:07:28] was begging him not to let him do
[1:07:31] that I'm just gonna go to
[1:07:43] sleep you know let's go to questions and
[1:07:46] answers and I believe this was 64 he
[1:07:48] said here a sister asked brother brandom
[1:07:50] he said you know I was serving the devil
[1:07:52] and in sin for many years until I found
[1:07:54] the Lord this is the
[1:07:56] question and he said please brother
[1:07:58] brandom he said I've sinned
[1:08:01] again and I'm not worthy to even be in
[1:08:04] this your presence or in this church
[1:08:07] before you in this holy place please
[1:08:10] please please tell
[1:08:12] me if I could
[1:08:14] ever be restored
[1:08:17] whole
[1:08:20] again would anybody like to hear the
[1:08:22] answer to that he says yes yes yes you
[1:08:27] have not sinned my friend wait a minute
[1:08:31] wait a minute brother
[1:08:34] brandom if I do some
[1:08:37] sin wouldn't I know if IID done the
[1:08:41] sin
[1:08:48] hello he says you've not sinned my
[1:08:51] friend so far in God but that you would
[1:08:54] okay this was went different I thought
[1:08:56] so far in God that you could not be
[1:08:58] restored if you had sinned so far that
[1:09:01] you could not be restored you would
[1:09:03] never want to be
[1:09:05] restored he said see see but as long as
[1:09:08] there's something dealing with you in
[1:09:10] your heart there's a line of restoration
[1:09:14] there guilt of the least guilty of the
[1:09:18] whole I don't let me rephrase that
[1:09:20] that's in respects the persons in James
[1:09:23] and I love that I can preach that my
[1:09:25] whole life cuz I
[1:09:27] hate that I just detest people that
[1:09:31] lower people to make them feel higher
[1:09:34] that is the most
[1:09:36] disgusting low life you have ever seen I
[1:09:39] don't care where you came from and
[1:09:42] you're and the prophet will say this
[1:09:44] matter of
[1:09:45] fact thank you
[1:09:50] Lord thank you thank you Lord he said
[1:09:53] here's people testifying to brother
[1:09:54] Brown he said you know one of the main
[1:09:56] differences of brother Brown's
[1:09:59] Ministry can you imagine somebody born
[1:10:02] in the southern states of Kentucky
[1:10:03] picking up a no a black baby child
[1:10:07] that's crosseyed and say God heals your
[1:10:10] eyes because they're not supposed to
[1:10:12] like
[1:10:15] them do you know that brother Bram
[1:10:18] said is is that all right just quote
[1:10:21] brother do you know that brother I have
[1:10:23] the quote on my iPad here but take me
[1:10:26] a couple minutes to find it that brother
[1:10:27] Brown did not like black people did you
[1:10:30] know and God wouldn't give him the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost until he sent him to a black
[1:10:34] church and that's where he got the
[1:10:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost so even your
[1:10:40] prophet in the beginning of his ministry
[1:10:41] was
[1:10:43] Prejudice and that's us say it's his own
[1:10:46] words I'm just quoting
[1:10:51] them and I can gladly give you the quote
[1:10:54] I'm standing On Solid
[1:10:57] Ground he said the greatest difference
[1:10:59] in brother bram's Ministry he said look
[1:11:01] here I tell you something this is
[1:11:03] Brother Brown talking he said I don't
[1:11:04] care if it's a negro child whether it's
[1:11:06] a Japanese child whether it's a Chinese
[1:11:07] child I don't care if it's a Korean
[1:11:09] child it's a person he said wherever God
[1:11:11] made a child there's no respects to
[1:11:13] persons God God's children period he
[1:11:17] said I don't care if they're in poverty
[1:11:19] below the line or above the
[1:11:21] line God made that
[1:11:24] job if you ever sit under a Ministry
[1:11:27] that shows respect because you're poor
[1:11:29] or you're wealthy or you came from
[1:11:31] another country run for your life cuz
[1:11:34] it's straight from hell that's right I
[1:11:37] don't care if he wears a nice
[1:11:41] suit whoa that's
[1:11:45] free guilty of the least is guilty of
[1:11:48] the whole he said this is Brother Bram
[1:11:50] now I'm back I'm reading now he said I
[1:11:53] brother Bram have sinned many times
[1:11:57] every day everyone of us do it that you
[1:12:01] don't want to do do things that you
[1:12:03] don't want to do he said it's it's in
[1:12:05] our hearts we don't want to do the way
[1:12:08] that or we don't want to ask this
[1:12:10] question he said see it's proof that
[1:12:13] God's still dealing with you he said you
[1:12:15] probably got nervous probably Satan was
[1:12:17] telling you watch just Satan coming in
[1:12:19] here see Satan's a great preacher he's a
[1:12:21] tenfold Ministry he's one of the top 10
[1:12:26] he said Satan was telling you that you
[1:12:28] couldn't be restored and he's lying
[1:12:30] certainly he is because look if there's
[1:12:34] a deep calling to the Deep then there's
[1:12:36] got to be a deep to respond to the deep
[1:12:38] and if a hunger then something there has
[1:12:42] got to take away the hunger or there
[1:12:45] wouldn't be no hunger and he said as
[1:12:47] I've asked you lots of times before
[1:12:49] there was a fish fin in the back he said
[1:12:51] God made the water and before there was
[1:12:53] Earth he made the tree
[1:12:58] so the tree could grow and and now
[1:13:00] before there was a creation there was a
[1:13:02] creator that created the creation and
[1:13:05] see what I mean he said now as long as
[1:13:07] you're wanting and hungering to get back
[1:13:10] to God there's a God somewhere calling
[1:13:13] you to it see and you wouldn't be
[1:13:16] hungering for it now I know lots of
[1:13:18] people that are going straight it looks
[1:13:20] like it looks like in their physical
[1:13:22] Tabernacle they're going straight to
[1:13:24] hell
[1:13:25] but they have a conscience that when
[1:13:27] they're in my presence and they're used
[1:13:29] to cussing all the time oh oh oh the
[1:13:31] preacher's
[1:13:32] here so what made them do
[1:13:40] that it wasn't themselves they're very
[1:13:43] comfortable custom but when they
[1:13:45] recognize the presence of Christ oh yeah
[1:13:48] praise God did you catch it in you they
[1:13:52] go oh oh sisters here
[1:13:57] that's God that does
[1:13:58] it amen where did I lose my
[1:14:05] place he said now there's a place that
[1:14:08] you can cross the line that you can't
[1:14:09] get back when but when you get down to
[1:14:11] that shape he said it goes to show that
[1:14:13] you've only Fell From
[1:14:16] Grace sorry now there's a place that you
[1:14:19] can where you can't get back but when
[1:14:22] you that's is your there again the shame
[1:14:26] shape you was it goes to show that
[1:14:29] you've only Fell From Grace backsliding
[1:14:32] now I want to this is a climax of our
[1:14:35] message people that aren't living
[1:14:38] right are not lost
[1:14:42] backsliding is not lost I want someone
[1:14:45] to tell me somewhere in the Bible where
[1:14:48] backsliding is lost and I can prove it
[1:14:51] by the Bible a backslider is not lost
[1:14:55] they're just out of Fellowship watch
[1:14:57] what he says here Israel backslid all
[1:15:00] the
[1:15:01] time but they never lost their
[1:15:05] Covenant they lost their joy and their
[1:15:08] praise but they didn't lose their
[1:15:11] Covenant David lost his Joy of his
[1:15:14] salvation when he took biva uriah's wife
[1:15:18] but he never
[1:15:19] lost his
[1:15:22] salvation now those are some pretty bad
[1:15:24] things to
[1:15:26] do he never said David never said
[1:15:29] restore unto me the my salvation he said
[1:15:33] restore unto me the joy of the Salvation
[1:15:37] that I still
[1:15:39] have and oh there's so much
[1:15:42] legalistic legalism in the church
[1:15:48] today that's what we're preaching
[1:15:50] about judging
[1:15:53] God there's so much legalism I'm this is
[1:15:56] your Prophet saying this this is in
[1:15:59] questions and answer 62 he said there's
[1:16:00] so much legalism in the church today
[1:16:03] says that we say as Believers touch not
[1:16:08] taste not don't do those
[1:16:15] things and I didn't come to this church
[1:16:18] tonight illegally I'm tired I'm nervous
[1:16:35] amen God help us here's another example
[1:16:38] here David going out when Saul was
[1:16:40] chasing him now did Saul
[1:16:45] sin he disobeyed God he tried to kill
[1:16:49] God's
[1:16:50] anointed which to kill in your heart to
[1:16:52] plan to premeditate kill his murder
[1:16:55] whether you did it or
[1:17:01] not and here
[1:17:03] David would
[1:17:08] have David could have killed sa and here
[1:17:12] God led him right
[1:17:14] up David's an amazing character in The
[1:17:17] Bible an amazing character here David
[1:17:21] God LED David right up to his
[1:17:23] enemy that is is intentionally plotting
[1:17:26] to kill him multiple
[1:17:32] times and the man was D the man was
[1:17:36] after David's life and David's very own
[1:17:39] men said God has let him come into your
[1:17:43] life so you can kill
[1:17:46] him God has arranged it that the people
[1:17:50] that you don't agree with you can really
[1:17:52] give them a piece of this message so
[1:17:55] they'll never come to this church
[1:18:01] again and David said God
[1:18:05] forbid you know what the Bible says that
[1:18:07] an offended soul is harder to win back
[1:18:11] than a walled
[1:18:16] City there's a time to actually
[1:18:19] not there's a time actually to be
[1:18:22] silent you don't have to tell somebody
[1:18:25] something that's going you know it's
[1:18:26] going to offend them what what good is
[1:18:27] that going to do you never be able to
[1:18:29] witness to them again not even your
[1:18:33] life I got an example for
[1:18:36] you you want to hear an example some
[1:18:38] things are just beyond explanation Jerry
[1:18:41] did a job for a man and he said you know
[1:18:43] I want you to just come and do this job
[1:18:45] now this just this is fresh I didn't put
[1:18:47] this down in my iPad I didn't study this
[1:18:49] all
[1:18:51] week but I was out and the man said just
[1:18:53] go ahead and do this job now I have
[1:18:55] dealt with that man for 20 years yeah or
[1:18:58] longer maybe 25 now we've been married
[1:19:00] living where we are for almost
[1:19:03] 40 so when I say 25 I probably with for
[1:19:06] 35 years and Jared said well no I won't
[1:19:09] do the job I'll come by and I'll give
[1:19:12] you a price and then you can decide so
[1:19:15] Jared did that told him what he was
[1:19:17] going to do give him a price the guy
[1:19:18] said okay go ahead and do it Jared got
[1:19:21] all done and the guy said that was way
[1:19:23] too much money to spend on this this old
[1:19:25] P junk house and Jared said well maybe I
[1:19:28] agree with you but he said I got two
[1:19:30] questions for you did I give you a price
[1:19:32] before I start was it exactly this price
[1:19:36] yep yep yeah I did you tell me to go
[1:19:38] ahead
[1:19:39] yep and I was work in the field and I've
[1:19:42] been there 38 years and that man drove
[1:19:44] by me and he wouldn't look at
[1:19:49] me and I'm like sister Donna I'm like
[1:19:57] hello hello I did
[1:20:01] exactly what what the word of God say
[1:20:04] says and there will be people not look
[1:20:07] at
[1:20:09] me I did exactly what you told me to do
[1:20:14] exactly and you told me I did
[1:20:21] it
[1:20:23] whoa now you know
[1:20:25] sadly in the message this ain't meant to
[1:20:29] hurt this is meant to help us you know
[1:20:31] the house of God is a place where
[1:20:34] sometimes
[1:20:38] God if I would have preached In the
[1:20:40] Flesh which I did over a year two years
[1:20:42] ago what Donnie Reagan preached on the
[1:20:44] CDs you would have said brother Dale's
[1:20:47] leaving the
[1:20:48] message but because Donnie Reagan is
[1:20:50] welcome to preach in every Church in the
[1:20:52] world
[1:20:54] yeah you can go ahead and leave I'll
[1:20:56] just say you didn't like what Donnie
[1:20:57] Reagan preached but if I had have
[1:21:00] preached it word for word you would have
[1:21:02] said my pastor's off the
[1:21:06] word and sadly the people you would have
[1:21:09] told would have believed
[1:21:11] you you know why because I'm a child
[1:21:19] Minister and you know what God says
[1:21:21] about
[1:21:23] that if you're look for James 4 he says
[1:21:26] I hate it and it's sin and you're headed
[1:21:30] to Hell unless you
[1:21:35] repent he says you're guilty of
[1:21:37] everything that you think you're saved
[1:21:40] from because you would lift
[1:21:43] up status
[1:21:50] quo
[1:21:52] wow that hurts me too don't kid
[1:21:57] yourself you know see God is on
[1:22:01] partial and they're his children and we
[1:22:05] need to be very
[1:22:07] careful you I I I you know God's
[1:22:10] ministering this morning you know I went
[1:22:12] to
[1:22:13] denfield last
[1:22:15] Tuesday and
[1:22:18] I I had nothing better to do you could
[1:22:20] say I went with my brother well that's
[1:22:22] not the truth I was finding out the
[1:22:23] price of cows going to me to try to
[1:22:25] steal some cows from my
[1:22:28] brother and I'm
[1:22:30] not I'm not preaching I'm not wearing a
[1:22:34] suit God forbid I'm not wearing a tie
[1:22:37] I'm dressing the roughest dirtiest
[1:22:38] clothes you could ever see I went to a
[1:22:40] sale the other day and Jared said it
[1:22:41] looks like you came out of the popper
[1:22:42] thing hadman worh for maybe 20 years or
[1:22:46] something and I put it back in he so
[1:22:47] embarrassed
[1:22:50] me and I'm sitting there and onbon me
[1:22:54] there's another man over there that's 81
[1:22:57] and he's ministering to homeless people
[1:22:59] up he lives in exor and he's talking to
[1:23:02] a Catholic which is a friend of mine and
[1:23:05] he said the
[1:23:08] Catholic he says see that man over there
[1:23:12] I see him looking at me really weird
[1:23:15] like he said you need to go sit beside
[1:23:18] that man and S talk to him he said he's
[1:23:20] a minister of God
[1:23:26] and you know what he
[1:23:28] said he was coming and he was asking
[1:23:30] about the mission field and all these
[1:23:34] things and he said I support people that
[1:23:38] do God's work do you have a charitable
[1:23:43] number was brother Dale looking for
[1:23:47] that you
[1:23:51] decide see God is God God could raise up
[1:23:57] the stones to worship him if you choose
[1:24:00] not to come to church God can use a
[1:24:02] donkey to minister to the five-fold
[1:24:05] ministry if you don't want to believe
[1:24:06] what God is and sometimes God comes
[1:24:09] across and such
[1:24:11] a that I just look at it I'm
[1:24:14] like what
[1:24:16] is now if that ain't it then you're not
[1:24:19] in fellowship with God because his ways
[1:24:22] are so much higher than our ways even if
[1:24:25] you're really holy his ways are so much
[1:24:28] and his thoughts are so much higher than
[1:24:30] brother Dale's thoughts that he'll go to
[1:24:32] people that are un
[1:24:36] blable and he'll bring them into the
[1:24:40] fold because he
[1:24:43] knows that before the foundation of the
[1:24:46] world and he knows that the things that
[1:24:49] they're doing ain't the real
[1:24:51] them we we struggle with that I do too I
[1:24:55] do too Junior help me a little
[1:24:58] bit we see something I say they're doing
[1:25:01] wrong be careful that could be
[1:25:04] God be careful there could be commit an
[1:25:07] adultery and you and you say that's
[1:25:09] wrong you say
[1:25:15] oh just leave it
[1:25:19] alone just leave it
[1:25:22] alone we don't know where Christ is
[1:25:26] tabernacled watch this and it hasn't
[1:25:29] come to
[1:25:31] manifestation
[1:25:33] yet yet is a key part
[1:25:38] yet if it had been brother Dale watch
[1:25:41] this watch this watch this just back up
[1:25:44] the cart if it had been the man hanging
[1:25:47] on the cross and I in I know you're
[1:25:50] sitting right beside me cuz I know some
[1:25:52] of you and I in the flesh would have
[1:25:54] said I would put the plug in the wall
[1:25:57] you know what I mean the electric
[1:26:10] chair but
[1:26:14] God that was
[1:26:16] him can you imagine and that's what's
[1:26:21] happened and that's one of the reasons
[1:26:24] where the smallest group there
[1:26:30] is you say oh bless God it's CU people
[1:26:32] don't believe the truth if you would
[1:26:34] just give them a
[1:26:37] chance if you would just give them a
[1:26:39] half anounce of a
[1:26:45] chance you know I know a minister and
[1:26:48] some of you sitting here and I'm not
[1:26:49] using names that when he lived a whole
[1:26:53] bunch of his children
[1:26:55] were serving
[1:26:56] Lucifer and so far two of them are the
[1:26:59] most amazing
[1:27:01] Believers that you have ever met and you
[1:27:04] have met in the world but he's
[1:27:09] dead and there's another one that's
[1:27:14] coming and yet if you would have judged
[1:27:16] them while he was still
[1:27:20] alive brother Brown said that lots of
[1:27:23] Grandma's prayer prayers are answered
[1:27:25] when
[1:27:29] Grandma you on
[1:27:33] bye-bye why are we judging God you said
[1:27:37] well no no no no there was this s
[1:27:40] oh listen I've got that t-shirt God you
[1:27:44] have no idea how God whipped me when I'm
[1:27:45] studying
[1:27:48] this I see exactly what you see I see
[1:27:51] imperfection I see people that are just
[1:27:53] off and I say oh that's nothing
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:28:09] but here he says don't say nothing about
[1:28:11] Christians he said maybe he said don't
[1:28:14] say nothing about Christians maybe some
[1:28:16] of them don't live just right or do just
[1:28:20] right but that's God's child that's
[1:28:25] God's preparation 54 want to know
[1:28:29] 0401 paragraph uh 23 he said maybe they
[1:28:34] don't live right how can you be God's
[1:28:37] child not live
[1:28:38] right and they don't do
[1:28:42] right but that's God's child and let the
[1:28:46] father take care of his own kitties
[1:28:50] KD you know if we're fighting one
[1:28:53] another
[1:28:54] God's given us both a weapon oh I've got
[1:28:57] some of them God's given both of us a
[1:29:01] weapon and corrected him maybe God can
[1:29:05] help
[1:29:07] him well I've had a few of those
[1:29:10] weapons from trying to help god with his
[1:29:16] Kittles and I was justified by the Bible
[1:29:21] because they weren't living right and
[1:29:23] they weren't doing doing
[1:29:26] right and brother Brown
[1:29:30] said that God would give you a
[1:29:34] whoop
[1:29:36] wow God help
[1:29:40] us amen God help
[1:29:48] us
[1:29:51] J let spell smoke
[1:29:56] shut the fan off amen God help
[1:30:01] us here I I want to read this scripture
[1:30:04] again and read another quote and we're
[1:30:05] going to we're going to stop here
[1:30:08] Revelations 8:28 30 and 34 and I I know
[1:30:12] we already touched on some of this and
[1:30:14] and I I know but I want to just read
[1:30:15] again now we know all things work
[1:30:18] together for good the god that love God
[1:30:23] and to
[1:30:24] them that are called according to his
[1:30:27] purpose and to him he did Forno he also
[1:30:31] predestinated and to them and to be
[1:30:34] conformed to the image of the son that
[1:30:36] he might be the first born among many
[1:30:39] heathens moreover whom he did just shut
[1:30:43] the light off in there whom over he did
[1:30:46] predestinate them he also called and
[1:30:49] whom he called he's also Justified and
[1:30:52] whom he's Justified he's already so
[1:30:55] these
[1:30:57] people that are living the life wrong
[1:31:02] and not doing right in God's eyes
[1:31:05] they're already
[1:31:06] glorified and I and brother Bram saying
[1:31:09] here he said God didn't send me now I'm
[1:31:11] still sent to preach the
[1:31:13] word but he didn't send me to go
[1:31:16] around talking to those
[1:31:20] people and show them
[1:31:24] amen I can Minister out the word and God
[1:31:27] will Minister him through the word but
[1:31:30] in God's eyes the people that we're
[1:31:32] judging are already
[1:31:35] glorified and it could be the woman at
[1:31:37] the well could be Rahab it could be the
[1:31:40] woman caught in the very act and it
[1:31:42] could be
[1:31:43] saw
[1:31:45] massacring
[1:31:47] Christians and if any of those people
[1:31:49] walked in this church
[1:31:50] today if you're breathing you would have
[1:31:53] a feeling come over
[1:31:56] you
[1:31:57] like better be
[1:32:05] careful why can't we just treat them as
[1:32:10] equal you know if you know I I want to
[1:32:14] tell you the confession you know I used
[1:32:16] to have
[1:32:17] people that would invite me to the
[1:32:19] church and I would
[1:32:21] go and I just say you know I even
[1:32:25] different situations but we're on camera
[1:32:28] and I just say I say I'll go to your
[1:32:29] special you come to my
[1:32:31] special and they would never and I and I
[1:32:33] told some people I said you know if you
[1:32:36] got God as your
[1:32:38] protector and you're afraid to come here
[1:32:42] you ain't got a very strong
[1:32:45] God you know where I'm going with that
[1:32:47] just read between the
[1:32:48] Lins if you think you're right and I'm
[1:32:51] wrong and I'm not afraid to go to where
[1:32:54] you believe you're right but you're
[1:32:55] afraid to come where I'm
[1:32:59] wrong you're afraid of your own ability
[1:33:02] of God keeping
[1:33:04] you you see what I'm
[1:33:07] saying
[1:33:10] amen watch this I'm going to close with
[1:33:12] this this message
[1:33:13] unbelief now unbelief is
[1:33:21] sin you know why God couldn't condemn
[1:33:24] the woman woman for disbelieving the
[1:33:27] angel he's talking about Sarah Abraham's
[1:33:31] wife because she was a part of
[1:33:35] him and God don't want us going around
[1:33:38] condemning
[1:33:40] people that we don't know if they are a
[1:33:44] part of
[1:33:46] God because now you're punching God
[1:33:55] and I fear for my life so I ain't going
[1:33:58] to do
[1:34:00] that he said why God couldn't condemn
[1:34:02] the woman for disbelieving the angel do
[1:34:04] you believe that he said but he couldn't
[1:34:06] do it he said that's the way some of you
[1:34:09] church people go and you church people
[1:34:12] are acting why I've been kicked out of
[1:34:14] here so Lo why we have kicked out a long
[1:34:19] time ago but God couldn't do it why he
[1:34:24] couldn't kick Sarah out cuz she was a
[1:34:27] part of Abraham and so she so she was
[1:34:32] hirs with Abraham and he had he kicked
[1:34:36] out Sarah he would have been kicking out
[1:34:38] Abraham out too and so he couldn't do it
[1:34:41] on the account that they were
[1:34:45] one actually he says husband and
[1:34:50] wife on the account that she was his
[1:34:53] wife and he was the husband and so
[1:34:55] that's the way it is because Christ
[1:34:57] can't kick us out we're his sons and
[1:35:00] daughters and our
[1:35:03] unbelief and what's unbelief help me up
[1:35:07] sin our unbelief God can't kick us
[1:35:12] out now listen that that's
[1:35:16] heavy on you know I I challenge anyone
[1:35:19] of you who got message Shir look up onb
[1:35:21] belief I think it comes up oh it's a lot
[1:35:24] it's a really lot I was going to print
[1:35:26] off some
[1:35:31] pictures is that the way it is of with
[1:35:35] Christ he can't kick us out because
[1:35:37] we're sons and daughters and are on
[1:35:39] belief now hang
[1:35:42] on you've never heard this
[1:35:45] said don't mean nothing
[1:35:58] that's
[1:36:00] 61 Abraham and his seed after him if
[1:36:03] anybody wants to look it
[1:36:05] up who you mean I can just go out
[1:36:11] sinning he says our unbelief doesn't
[1:36:14] mean nothing real true Seed of Abraham
[1:36:18] will shine anyway there it
[1:36:21] is you couldn't
[1:36:24] stop the very next I I lied let me just
[1:36:28] so good he said you can't stop the
[1:36:31] program of God with your
[1:36:36] unbelief now I'll just tell you what
[1:36:38] you're going to have some troubles so if
[1:36:41] you're gods and you make the bad you're
[1:36:45] going to have to lie in it and so you
[1:36:47] can go ahead and do all these sewing
[1:36:49] Wild Oaks and have 50 different kids
[1:36:53] from different men and it ain't going to
[1:36:55] be me
[1:36:56] crying it's going to be you when none of
[1:36:59] them come and see you because you were a
[1:37:02] bad person but it don't take away the
[1:37:05] seed of election so you cry a lot what
[1:37:10] do you think Israel's going to do they
[1:37:12] crucified the
[1:37:14] Lord and the world will hear them F
[1:37:18] cry when they recognize what they're do
[1:37:21] and when you backslide
[1:37:23] you're still Gods he can't kick you out
[1:37:26] but when you come to
[1:37:29] repentance you're going to be a
[1:37:31] sorrowful sight crawling back on your
[1:37:34] knees like a
[1:37:36] worm he said so that's the way it is oh
[1:37:39] he said you can't stop the program of
[1:37:40] God with your unbelief John the Baptist
[1:37:43] said God is able for these stones to
[1:37:46] rise up children onto Abraham see God's
[1:37:49] word is spoken and it's got to come to
[1:37:52] pass oh
[1:37:54] my God help us in the face of uh just
[1:37:58] let me please read a couple of these in
[1:38:00] the face of all this doubt God go God
[1:38:04] goes right on proving his word to be
[1:38:07] right as he has in every age and
[1:38:11] unbelief doesn't stop God it does it
[1:38:16] doesn't hinder him I don't care how much
[1:38:20] the world unbeliev it it's still going
[1:38:25] to happen now I said I was going to read
[1:38:27] one and I read three God forgive me
[1:38:32] wow now brother Dale is not condoning
[1:38:36] sin but God's saying stop judging
[1:38:41] me stop judging
[1:38:45] me you know when Paul wrote this I want
[1:38:48] to just close with this in Romans 9 the
[1:38:51] 2 verse When Paul wrote this visy he
[1:38:53] said I have great heaviness and
[1:38:57] continuing
[1:38:59] sorrow of
[1:39:01] heart I'm going to interpret that and
[1:39:04] you can disagree it's because Paul knew
[1:39:08] when he wrote that nobody would believe
[1:39:12] or understand his message it's
[1:39:16] unbelievable it's unbelievable that
[1:39:19] there could be somebody in this world
[1:39:20] that ain't called in yet that in God's
[1:39:23] mind there already glorified and then
[1:39:24] the world they're so w sinning that's
[1:39:30] unbelievable that's
[1:39:32] that I want to sing have thy own way
[1:39:35] Lord you know brother Dale in no way is
[1:39:39] condoning that we can go out and sin and
[1:39:43] you can't sin without having
[1:39:46] repercussions of that
[1:39:48] sin but I'm saying
[1:39:51] this even though you sin it don't take
[1:39:54] the the seed away and God don't expect
[1:39:57] the other Harvest to condemn the seed
[1:40:00] that's coming
[1:40:02] late you know you know God God may bring
[1:40:06] in people in his
[1:40:09] Vineyard that's God's choice if he don't
[1:40:12] bring no more into this church it's it's
[1:40:14] completely up to God but if some of
[1:40:16] those people that are sitting with me at
[1:40:18] the sale and come over and talk and they
[1:40:19] walk in I don't need anybody here and
[1:40:21] neither does God need you to tell them
[1:40:24] anything absolutely nothing you know
[1:40:27] that man that come over and was
[1:40:29] ministering to the homeless I never told
[1:40:31] him about the Seven Seals I never told
[1:40:33] him about a prophet I never told him
[1:40:35] about election I never told him I did
[1:40:38] he's already attracted to
[1:40:40] me hello I'm not going to offend him
[1:40:44] with steak when he can't
[1:40:47] take that's right stop it stop it stop
[1:40:52] it stop during your Revelation nobody
[1:40:55] just keep it for yourself your
[1:40:56] Revelation you could die with your
[1:40:58] Revelation different mind that's between
[1:41:00] you and God work out your own salvation
[1:41:02] with fear and trembling just
[1:41:06] stop because those are God's
[1:41:14] kles amen God's KD all come to him at a
[1:41:19] different time in a different season and
