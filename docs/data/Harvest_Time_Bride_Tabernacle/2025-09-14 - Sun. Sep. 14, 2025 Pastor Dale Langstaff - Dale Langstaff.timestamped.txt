[29:52] love the Lord. Also, just another far
[29:55] away announcement. In November 1st and
[29:58] 2nd, Ben Norrod will be with the church.
[30:01] Um,
[30:03] November uh 1st and 2nd. Just before I
[30:07] read my scripture, um I I sent out a a
[30:12] video from uh from Ohio from Ched Lamb's
[30:16] church and and it really spoke to me and
[30:20] it
[30:22] I believe it spoke to the condition of
[30:26] the church. I believe it spoke on what
[30:29] we're preaching on and I believe it
[30:31] spoke on our world
[30:34] where the situation of our world is
[30:37] and uh
[30:40] um
[30:43] um
[30:46] I don't ever want to I've been there and
[30:51] I I I hope your testimony
[30:54] wouldn't be recently that I've been
[30:56] there recently, But
[30:59] you know, brother Chad was saying if
[31:00] anybody wants that video that didn't I
[31:02] sent it to everybody I could think of.
[31:05] But uh
[31:06] &gt;&gt; he was saying our world has got to a
[31:09] place that
[31:11] for us to be right, we must make you
[31:13] wrong.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; And I don't ever want to be that kind of
[31:17] a person.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; To make me right don't have to make you
[31:25] wrong.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] on anything.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; And uh
[31:36] &gt;&gt; wow, it it was it was powerful. You
[31:38] know, when we trust God,
[31:42] Brother Chad finished that video like
[31:43] this. He said, "If we believe God and
[31:47] you believe I'm wrong, then you can
[31:50] trust God that he's duty bound
[31:52] &gt;&gt; to change me
[31:54] &gt;&gt; and make me right.
[31:56] It's his responsibility
[31:58] &gt;&gt; ultimately or God would fail
[32:01] &gt;&gt; or I'm not a part of God. We know God
[32:03] can't fail
[32:05] &gt;&gt; and that goes for the ministry
[32:07] &gt;&gt; and the people.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; If I think you're wrong, it's not my job
[32:11] to change you
[32:13] &gt;&gt; cuz no man comes to the father
[32:16] &gt;&gt; but the father
[32:18] &gt;&gt; do the drawn.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, you know, I I I pray to
[32:23] God that we don't preach down. You know,
[32:25] you know what I'm saying?
[32:27] &gt;&gt; That's of the devil.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; You don't talk down to your kids.
[32:31] They're a human being.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; But pastors, ministers, you don't talk
[32:35] down to people.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; You're just equally the bride. I'm just
[32:39] equally your brother.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; I'm just a brother.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not a minister. You You see what I
[32:48] mean? We forget that elevation that's
[32:51] that's of the devil.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; God is no respector
[32:56] &gt;&gt; of elevation person. Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we are living in a world
[33:03] of that. So we want to remember Charlie
[33:05] Kirk's wife
[33:07] &gt;&gt; and his family.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; He was brutally murdered
[33:13] &gt;&gt; because of his testimony for God.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you watch some of his
[33:18] videos, his testimonies,
[33:20] &gt;&gt; they he made no bones about it that he
[33:22] loved Jesus
[33:24] &gt;&gt; and he was his savior
[33:26] &gt;&gt; and
[33:32] &gt;&gt; there's a lot more we could say about
[33:34] that.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; But you know, we can that's a spirit.
[33:39] Everything we deal with is a spirit.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[33:46] Amen. It's a spirit just we don't
[33:49] wrestle against flesh and blood but
[33:51] about principalities and spirits
[33:54] &gt;&gt; and wickedness in high places.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to say the wrong but I I
[34:01] can say this. I I want to say this.
[34:07] If you let Satan anoint you, you will
[34:10] surprise you how far he will take you.
[34:13] That's right.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Because this young man that
[34:18] did the shooting,
[34:20] &gt;&gt; it was his dad that called the youth
[34:23] pastor.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Let that sink in.
[34:28] And the youth pastor called the police
[34:36] &gt;&gt; because of enough hatred
[34:38] &gt;&gt; to murder.
[34:41] I have quotes here. Brother Bam said,
[34:43] "You know, we murder people every day,
[34:45] &gt;&gt; but it's not with a knife or a bullet."
[34:50] &gt;&gt; And I Oh, buddy.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; I'd have to beg God for forgiveness.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're talking about
[34:56] somebody and they're not present, unless
[34:57] it's positive, you're murdering them.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[35:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want to.
[35:05] It's exactly the same spirit. If you
[35:09] leave a company of anybody and you're
[35:14] talking negative and down about them,
[35:17] you are guilty of firstdegree
[35:20] murder in God's eyes.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that would make somebody
[35:26] dysfellowshipped
[35:27] or walk away angry and not even
[35:31] communicate at all is murder.
[35:36] It's a identical
[35:38] spirit.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said things like this that
[35:42] you might as well pull out a gun and
[35:44] shoot them in cold blood
[35:47] &gt;&gt; is walk away and not try to reconcile
[35:49] even come to an agreement that we just
[35:52] disagree.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. And and now I I want
[36:01] to share this with you is that's
[36:03] predestinated to be. That's prophecy.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to get worse before we get
[36:09] out of here.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says all kinds of
[36:12] things about that that the world won't
[36:13] be they won't have ears to hear. They'll
[36:16] they desire itchy ears and and and you
[36:19] know, sons will be against dads and moms
[36:21] against daughters and Amen. It's just
[36:24] it's prophecy. We can't we can't fight
[36:27] it. But you can change your world
[36:30] &gt;&gt; and I can change my world. And then when
[36:32] our two worlds are together, we've
[36:35] changed the whole world.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow.
[36:43] Let's just remember his family and his
[36:46] wife and and let's just remember each
[36:48] other. Remember remember me. I I fail.
[36:52] My goodness. I I hope that when you know
[36:55] I'm wrong, I hope you'll give me enough
[36:57] murder mercy that you won't murder me.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Enough mercy that you won't murder me.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Well, you know, it's just
[37:05] it's just that dummy up there. Just give
[37:08] me a little bit of mercy."
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and read our
[37:11] scripture. Amen. God bless you. We love
[37:13] you and it's just awesome to be together
[37:15] again.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; John 8:10 and 11. We're going to
[37:20] continue our our topic on what must I do
[37:23] to have eternal life? And I and I
[37:25] believe that's the question of forever.
[37:27] We could just preach on that and then
[37:29] we'll just go in rapture because if I
[37:31] have eternal life, I'm not worried about
[37:33] nothing else.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just just give me eternal life and
[37:36] you can have all the other stuff. Amen.
[37:40] John 8 and 10 and 11. And when Jesus
[37:44] lifted up himself, he saw none but the
[37:46] woman. And he said unto her,"Woman,
[37:51] where
[37:53] are these thine accusers?
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Hath no man condemned thee?"
[38:01] And she said, "No man, Lord?" And Jesus
[38:06] said unto her, "Neither do I condemn
[38:11] thee. Go and sin no more." Lord Jesus,
[38:14] we pray that you'll make the scripture
[38:16] be me.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll make it be me.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray that you'll just
[38:22] somehow it won't be me, but somehow
[38:25] supernaturally you can portray the love
[38:28] of God to these people and and your your
[38:31] amazing
[38:33] compassion
[38:35] &gt;&gt; for us. In your name we pray. Amen. You
[38:38] may have your seats.
[38:41] Amen. We serve an amazing God. And he
[38:45] he's a lot different God than what he
[38:47] was that I served when I was young
[38:50] because I was one of these accusers.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; I Oh, buddy. I was I was all of them.
[38:57] Amen. God.
[38:59] Wow. I'm embarrassed of my youth. Amen.
[39:04] And God has spanked me multiple times.
[39:06] Amen.
[39:08] And you know it we don't want religion
[39:13] &gt;&gt; and we don't we don't want
[39:15] denominational spirit.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said our prophet said that
[39:19] a denominational spirit is just putting
[39:20] up walls.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; It can be anywhere.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; If you put up a wall and put me out of
[39:26] the wall, you have a denominational
[39:27] spirit.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; And if I do the same to you, I have a
[39:30] denominational spirit. I'm better than
[39:31] you. You're better than me.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; We have to be in different pens cuz
[39:34] we'll fight. We're like animals. You
[39:36] know, animals you put in different cages
[39:39] &gt;&gt; because if you put them together,
[39:40] they'll fight.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; We have to get past that. Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Come back to the Garden of Eden. You
[39:46] know, last Sunday, I just want to read
[39:47] our scripture, Luke 10, just to lay the
[39:50] foundation. And then I'm going to go
[39:51] completely off on a different way here
[39:54] in Luke 10:25. And he said, "Behold, a
[39:56] certain lawyer stood up and tempted
[39:58] Jesus. Said, Master, what must I do to
[40:01] have eternal life?"
[40:03] And he said unto him, "It is written in
[40:05] the law, how readest thou?" And the
[40:09] lawyer answered and said, "Thou shalt
[40:10] love the Lord thy God with all thy
[40:12] heart, with all thy soul, and with all
[40:16] thy strength, and with all thy mind,
[40:20] and thy neighbor,
[40:22] exactly as yourself."
[40:27] And the lawyer said unto Jesus or Jesus
[40:30] said unto him, sorry, thou hast answered
[40:32] right, do this and thou shalt
[40:36] &gt;&gt; shalt live. Now this is our Lord talking
[40:40] and when he was saying to the lawyer
[40:42] about live is thou shalt have eternal
[40:46] life because to live was you will never
[40:48] die.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[40:55] That's amazing.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; That's so amazing.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; And then we just drop to verse 33. And a
[41:06] certain Samaritan
[41:08] here Jesus is telling the parable. He
[41:10] journeying by and he came where your
[41:13] neighbor was.
[41:15] And when he looked upon him, he had
[41:18] compassion.
[41:20] I I want to stop there in this
[41:21] scripture. You know, we were went to see
[41:23] Lann's uh went to Lann's family reunion
[41:26] yesterday and and I mentioned this to
[41:28] her brother and her sister and
[41:30] sister-in-law and the one spoke up and
[41:33] they were thinking of compassion by
[41:36] enabling people like I can't give all my
[41:40] money away like to lazy people. You
[41:43] know, compassion can be zero dollars.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you might be in a f you
[41:51] you know what I'm saying? It don't have
[41:52] compassion is not identified by give me
[41:55] all your money.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; You can have compassion on me and not
[41:59] give me no money.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; And vice versa.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; So this ain't rated on money.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we need to lay that down. So I
[42:10] mean in this case he did give two pence
[42:12] and but but it's the definition of love
[42:15] and compassion. I can still feel your
[42:18] situation and and if I could help you, I
[42:21] would. And and you know, stuff like
[42:23] this. Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; You can't do something you can't do.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; But you can still have a feeling. You
[42:29] can still put their shoes on and feel
[42:31] the situation of where they're at.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And verse 37,
[42:39] and Jesus asked the lawyer, he said,
[42:41] "Now, who was your neighbor? Who was the
[42:43] one that was the neighbor?" And he said,
[42:45] "Who was right?" And he said, "He that
[42:47] showeth mercy, compassion
[42:52] on him." And then Jesus said unto him,
[42:55] "Go thou and do likewise."
[42:59] You know, the world will be a better
[43:01] place and we will be living a Christian
[43:04] life if we have compassion one for the
[43:07] other and even ones we don't know. How
[43:10] much more should we in our family and
[43:13] the family of God, brothers and sisters,
[43:17] have love and compassion? But God was
[43:19] taking us right outside of even his
[43:22] family.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And showing us compassion. And I want to
[43:26] show you, you know, that the scriptures
[43:28] have multiple examples in Jesus. And so
[43:30] I want to carry on at different times.
[43:33] Three, I have three examples where Jesus
[43:38] broke his own law
[43:42] to show compassion and love.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Broke the scenario of religious
[43:48] traditions
[43:50] to show love and compassion. Three
[43:52] examples and then I want to close
[43:56] on what I was like when I was young.
[44:01] And it's vastly different.
[44:06] Here in John 8 1-11,
[44:10] we see the story of the woman caught in
[44:13] the very act of adultery. And Jesus came
[44:16] to the Mount of Olives and early in the
[44:18] morning again he was at the temple and
[44:19] the people came unto him and sat down
[44:21] and he taught them. And there were
[44:23] certain scribes and and Pharisees that
[44:25] brought unto him a woman caught in
[44:28] adultery. Now, I'll just tell you what,
[44:30] if you would have seen Brother Dale
[44:31] about 30 years ago, oh boy, I would I
[44:34] would have told you exactly what the
[44:35] Bible said about that.
[44:39] See, I was that Pharisee.
[44:42] I was the Pharisee and the scribe.
[44:46] And then they had set her in his midst.
[44:49] And they said unto him,"Lord, this woman
[44:52] was taken in adultery,
[44:54] and your Bible says,
[44:58] "We have the right to stone her."
[45:04] &gt;&gt; See, we can justify ourselves. I'm
[45:06] standing on the word of God. Praise the
[45:09] Lord.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says, "Thou shalt
[45:14] not commit adultery. There will be no
[45:16] liars, no adulteress in heaven, but God
[45:18] forgive all of them." Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Said in verse five, "Now Moses and the
[45:24] law command us, not tell us, it orders
[45:27] us."
[45:30] &gt;&gt; That if we're message believers, we're
[45:32] going to stone people.
[45:35] The command that's that's a that's
[45:38] that's not a suggestion.
[45:40] That's an order.
[45:44] That said should be stoned. But what
[45:47] saith you?
[45:50] Now Jesus is the word.
[45:55] But he gave a little different answer
[45:56] than what brother Dale thought he would.
[46:02] And this they were tempting him. They
[46:04] might have choose him. And Jesus stooped
[46:06] down with his finger and wrote on the
[46:08] ground as though he didn't hear them.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's good not to hear people.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; You might open your mouth and let out
[46:18] something bad.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Where was I?
[46:32] &gt;&gt; And and then
[46:37] sorry. And so when they continually
[46:41] asked Jesus, he lifted up himself and he
[46:44] said unto them,
[46:47] I I want you to remember the Bible
[46:50] order.
[46:56] Moses broke the law. That was God's plan
[46:59] to stone him.
[47:01] But God was changing dispensations.
[47:06] Jesus lifted up himself and he said unto
[47:08] them, "He that without sin,
[47:11] &gt;&gt; let him cast the first stone to her."
[47:13] Now, I want to just give you a news
[47:15] flash. If you're alive today, you were
[47:18] born in sin. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; I don't care how holy your parents were,
[47:24] how pure they were, and how long they
[47:26] were married before you came along, and
[47:29] and how they dedicated you to God and
[47:33] dumped you in water and baptized you and
[47:36] stood you on your head and said prayers
[47:37] three times. And
[47:42] &gt;&gt; and again he stood down and he wrote on
[47:44] the ground and he said,
[47:47] "And they which heard it were convicted
[47:49] in their own conscience, and went one by
[47:52] one, beginning at the eldest, even to
[47:54] the last. And Jesus was left alone."
[47:58] And then Jesus lifted up himself.
[48:02] He saw that none was there but the
[48:04] woman.
[48:07] Would that woman be accepted here this
[48:10] morning?
[48:12] This morning?
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Would that woman be allowed to sing a
[48:16] special
[48:18] &gt;&gt; this morning?
[48:21] This morning? Would she be allowed to
[48:23] sing a special? Would she be allowed to
[48:26] worship Jehovah
[48:30] &gt;&gt; this morning in this condition?
[48:32] &gt;&gt; In this church?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:42] Where are these thine accusers?
[48:45] Hath no man condemned thee? And she
[48:47] said, no man, no man, Lord,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[48:54] And Jesus said, neither do I condemn
[48:56] thee. How how could God do that?
[49:02] How could how could I have been so wrong
[49:06] when I was young?
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, some of you older ones, you know,
[49:14] Brother Dale. Oh, buddy. I was on the
[49:16] front page of legalistic.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; I I know where I was.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; I'm embarrassed.
[49:24] But see, to know to correct the error is
[49:27] to recognize your
[49:28] &gt;&gt; error.
[49:31] to recognize that I was I was I was I
[49:35] was sinfully wrong
[49:40] &gt;&gt; and that spirit's very healthy
[49:43] &gt;&gt; when we would condemn one another each
[49:46] other when God never even condemned us.
[49:49] Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So here we're condemning each other and
[49:52] our Lord don't even condemn us. And he's
[49:54] like, "I never I said you were free, but
[49:58] nobody else did."
[50:01] Wow.
[50:06] You know, Brother Bam told the story of
[50:08] a little girl that went to go see the
[50:11] king and it was at the school and and
[50:13] I'm just paraphrasing. I'm going to come
[50:15] into it. you can. But uh the the school
[50:18] had put out the king and they they give
[50:20] all the kids flags
[50:23] and and it really goes beautifully right
[50:26] here. And so the kids were all lined up
[50:28] and they were waving their flade like,
[50:30] "Hi, king. I want you to see me. Can you
[50:32] see me?" Little short ones. They were
[50:34] all trying to get in the front row. And
[50:36] one little girl after the king left, she
[50:38] she went away by a hydropole and she was
[50:40] just sobbing her eyes open. And the
[50:43] teacher came and said,"What are you
[50:45] crying about? Like, didn't you see the
[50:48] king? Didn't we have the short people on
[50:50] the front and the, you know, the taller
[50:52] and the taller and the bigger?" And
[50:53] everybody was waving their flag.
[50:57] Didn't you see the king? She said, "Oh,
[50:58] yeah. I saw the king." Said, "Well, what
[51:00] in the world? Didn't you wave your flag
[51:02] to the king when he passed?" She said,
[51:04] "Yeah." He said, "And you saw him?" She
[51:07] said, "Yeah, I saw him." Then she said,
[51:09] "But why are you crying?" And she said,
[51:11] "But teacher, the king, he knows me."
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And that isn't the way Jesus is
[51:24] &gt;&gt; to a prostitute.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; No matter how little you are, he knows
[51:30] everything
[51:32] that you do.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; It's recorded in heaven.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Just as much. And it's not the big
[51:39] things. Sometimes we do. Sometimes the
[51:42] little things that we leave undone.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus had no respects. I want you to
[51:49] watch that last line.
[51:51] Is that up there? The last 44.
[51:54] Now Jesus had no respects of groups.
[51:59] Jesus met all kinds of uhoh
[52:04] &gt;&gt; groups.
[52:07] All sizes.
[52:10] and all walks of life. Well, we we just
[52:14] fellowship with them because, you know,
[52:17] we don't go to the well when they're
[52:18] there because because we know
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[52:27] You know, in Luke 23,
[52:30] Jesus is being crucified
[52:33] and he's in torture and agony for me.
[52:41] And then starting in verse 33, and when
[52:44] they had come to the place which was
[52:45] called Calvary, there they crucified
[52:48] Jesus and the male factors which are the
[52:52] thieves, one on the right and one on the
[52:56] left. And Jesus said, "Father,
[52:59] I could have you done this? I
[53:03] I'm trying to. Father,
[53:07] forgive them for they don't know what
[53:10] they do. Now, Jesus was comp. He was
[53:13] more than 100%
[53:16] innocent.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; There has never been a person killed
[53:22] that was more innocent than Christ.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And they parted his raignments. They
[53:30] mocked him. Mocked him.
[53:38] Have you ever heard believers mock
[53:40] somebody? They
[53:42] &gt;&gt; mocked him.
[53:45] Well, they ain't
[53:47] they're always
[53:49] they that's a mock them.
[53:57] People stood beholding him and the
[54:00] rulers also them deridded him, degraded
[54:03] him, saying, "You save others and let
[54:06] him save himself." What a loser. If you
[54:10] be the Christ, the chosen of God, and
[54:13] the soldiers also mocked him, mocked
[54:17] him. I can think of sometimes that I
[54:20] mock believers.
[54:27] It's disgusting. I I
[54:30] &gt;&gt; But I I imagine if I did it this maybe
[54:38] coming and offering him vinegar and
[54:41] saying, "If thou be the king of the
[54:42] Jews, save yourself." And one of the
[54:45] thieves, the male factors which were
[54:48] hanging ra beside him, he started
[54:49] mocking them also. Now he's dying,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; but he starts mocking God. He's saying,
[54:54] "If thou be the Christ, save thyself and
[54:56] save me, too."
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to watch this verse 39.
[55:06] He actually asked
[55:09] Jesus
[55:11] that if you're the Christ, save me.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Save yourself, but save me with you.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; But he did it in the wrong attitude.
[55:23] He actually asked to be saved.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But Jesus didn't take it.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Because it was the delivery.
[55:35] It was done in mockery and blaspheme.
[55:39] Verse 40. And the other answered him and
[55:43] rebuked him. Now why would he rebuke him
[55:46] for asking to be saved?
[55:48] It was because of his delivery.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; His delivery was, "Well, if I went, you
[55:53] you can't do nothing for me. I've been
[55:56] going serving God twice as long as you.
[55:58] I understand that. I never could have
[56:01] done more for you than anybody else."
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Like how if a believer is serving God
[56:06] for 60 years and somebody comes in and
[56:08] they're only serving them for 20 years,
[56:10] they still can't help the guy in 20.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; It's God that helps us.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God that does everything.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; We think, well, well, bless God. I've
[56:20] been serving God longer than you, so I
[56:22] know everything.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know nothing.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And the other one answer, rebuked him,
[56:30] saying,
[56:32] "Dust thou not fear God?
[56:35] You dummy?"
[56:39] I I always wondered when God seen me
[56:41] when I was young and he said, "Oh boy,
[56:44] you're going to have to relive this
[56:47] so many times."
[56:52] Don't you fear God, seeing that thou art
[56:54] in the same condemnation, and that
[56:57] indeed we justly, for we are receiving
[57:00] the due reward of our deeds. But this
[57:03] man hath done nothing.
[57:06] I miss.
[57:09] Wow.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And he said unto Jesus, "Lord, now I I
[57:14] want to show you something. The person
[57:16] that got saved never asked for
[57:19] salvation."
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; That's what I The one that got not
[57:26] saved, he asked God to save him.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; remember me. I want to stop there for a
[57:37] second.
[57:39] He never said, "Forgive me." He never
[57:42] said, "I'm sorry." He never said, "Help
[57:45] me, Lord."
[57:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; No. He just said, "Remember me."
[57:56] &gt;&gt; How do people get saved without
[57:58] repenting?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Well, here's an example right here.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; He got saved and he never even repented.
[58:04] Some of you, you you parents that got
[58:06] old kids. They might not have to repent.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; No. Job's kids never.
[58:15] You thought I was
[58:17] &gt;&gt; It was Job's sacrifice over his kids
[58:19] that saved his kids.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's crazy. I mean, I love it.
[58:24] It's just amazing.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; But we we put sometimes we change what
[58:28] God is. And God, we can't do that. I'm
[58:32] showing you a God's showing me a
[58:34] different God. I'm like, "Oh, boy."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; God's showing Brother Dale a different
[58:39] God.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Dale don't have to be right. And
[58:42] I don't need to make anybody wrong just
[58:43] to make me feel better cuz I'm right.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of the devil.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "Remember me when thou
[58:53] comest to your kingdom."
[58:57] He he never said like after you die when
[59:00] you get to heaven or it was just really
[59:03] peculiar.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say
[59:08] unto you that today
[59:11] thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[59:14] That guy, you know that brother
[59:20] was a no good scoundrel.
[59:23] He said himself they were getting justly
[59:25] due
[59:26] &gt;&gt; what their reward was.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; They they they were getting killed
[59:29] because they were robbers and thieves.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know he had never attended
[59:33] church?
[59:34] &gt;&gt; He had never heard the seven seals
[59:36] preached. He had never taken communion.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; He had not been baptized. Probably
[59:40] wasn't even dedicated. Probably hated
[59:42] God his whole life.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Never paid tithe and offerings. probably
[59:49] sold from the church if he could have.
[59:52] Well, he he obviously sold. He was
[59:54] robbed.
[59:57] And he never asked for forgiveness. He
[59:59] never even came to an altar and wept.
[1:00:01] And they never had an evangelist like
[1:00:03] that was really uh good at
[1:00:09] he just said,
[1:00:12] "I'm getting justly what I deserve.
[1:00:15] Lord, just think about me.
[1:00:18] just think about me when you get there.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And God said, "You'll be there with me."
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; I I wonder I wonder if that robber came
[1:00:30] in
[1:00:32] that broke into took advantage of you,
[1:00:34] broke something of yours, took a whole
[1:00:36] bunch of money, robbed you blind,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; was all dirty and not respectful and and
[1:00:43] never done nothing good in his whole
[1:00:45] life. I wonder if he'd be welcome here.
[1:00:51] I wonder if we'd let him go first in the
[1:00:54] food line
[1:00:56] because he never brought nothing. Never
[1:00:58] would, never did. And he ate a lot.
[1:01:02] See how we think.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He's taking advantage of us.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He never did nothing right.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Heaven's going to be filled with a lot
[1:01:15] of rotten people.
[1:01:17] that God loved.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's amazing.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; And then we come to the story in John 4.
[1:01:28] And this is kind of a long story, but I
[1:01:30] need to go through it just to break it
[1:01:32] down. This the Saraphene woman, the
[1:01:36] woman at the well.
[1:01:39] And and I just kind of highlighted
[1:01:40] different verses. I don't got it all but
[1:01:42] this this John chapter John is an
[1:01:44] amazing book by the way.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; John is just you know those that hear my
[1:01:50] words my sheep hear my voice and another
[1:01:54] they won't follow. I love the book of
[1:01:55] John
[1:01:57] here Jesus is on a journey and he
[1:01:59] departed to Galilee and he said I must
[1:02:01] needs go by Samaria. Now, you know, I
[1:02:05] read all the quotes. You know, there was
[1:02:07] hundreds of quotes. There was 130ome
[1:02:10] quotes on this verse. The woman at the
[1:02:12] well, I I I think I read every single
[1:02:15] one of them. But, uh, you know, Jesus,
[1:02:17] Brother Brown was talking about to go to
[1:02:19] this spot. It was way out of the way and
[1:02:21] way up a mountain. The disciples did not
[1:02:23] want to go there. It was a no good for
[1:02:25] nothing place. It wasn't on the way to
[1:02:26] the mall. It wasn't on the way to
[1:02:28] Walmart or even the hunting store. It
[1:02:31] was just on the way to nowhere.
[1:02:34] It was on a dirt road, so it bypassed
[1:02:36] all the highways and it was uphill.
[1:02:40] And there cameth a woman out to draw
[1:02:41] water.
[1:02:44] Now, I must have skipped that important
[1:02:46] verse. I'm sorry, but Jesus sent his
[1:02:49] disciples away. Brother Bram said it was
[1:02:52] because they had a religious
[1:02:53] denominational spirit.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; But the woman came and he said, "Give me
[1:02:58] a drink." In verse eight, and it Oh,
[1:03:00] here he goes. Sorry. I thought I'd take
[1:03:02] that. I that was my favorite one. And
[1:03:04] the disciples for the his disciples
[1:03:07] Jesus were gone away in the city to buy
[1:03:10] meat cuz he knew that they couldn't
[1:03:13] handle what was going to happen at
[1:03:14] church this morning.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's going to be somebody from
[1:03:20] the city come in. They're going to have
[1:03:22] a swimsuit on. What are we gonna do?
[1:03:25] What are we gonna do?
[1:03:29] You know your your prophet preached to
[1:03:32] women in India that he said that they
[1:03:35] had as many clothes on as what they were
[1:03:37] born with.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; That's not a lot.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And he didn't pass out coats or house
[1:03:48] coats. He just preached the word
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost come down and went
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; back the next day and they were covered
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; and he never preached on holiness.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; So I wonder if they would be welcome
[1:04:05] here.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't have a closet here
[1:04:09] where we pass out house coats to people
[1:04:11] that aren't dressed properly. Because
[1:04:13] see, if we give them the house coat,
[1:04:15] they can take it off.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Like if you go to the grocery store and
[1:04:20] you see somebody not dressed right, do
[1:04:21] you give them your coat?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; But you're there. If you don't give them
[1:04:26] your coat in the grocery store and you
[1:04:28] don't leave because they offend you,
[1:04:30] then why would you do it different here?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Are you not a big person?
[1:04:40] And then the woman here, he said, "How
[1:04:43] art thou being a Jew? Why we don't we
[1:04:45] don't go to the same church at camp
[1:04:47] meeting? Why we are divided?
[1:04:51] I'm a Samaritan. And for the Jews have
[1:04:53] no dealing with us because we are
[1:04:56] unclean people. We're mixed."
[1:04:59] And Jesus answered and said unto her,
[1:05:00] "Whosoever
[1:05:02] drinkkeeth the water that or this water
[1:05:04] thirsteth again, but whosoever drinkketh
[1:05:06] my water will never thirst." And and she
[1:05:09] said, "Sir, give me this water
[1:05:12] that I may thirst not." See the
[1:05:15] approach?
[1:05:17] She never said,
[1:05:21] "What are you talking about?" She never
[1:05:23] said, "How are you qualified?" She never
[1:05:25] said, "How long did you go to
[1:05:27] university?" She never said, "How big is
[1:05:29] your church?" That'll prove if you're a
[1:05:31] good pastor. If you have a big church,
[1:05:33] well, you got to be good. Hitler had a
[1:05:35] big church.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He was preaching Lucifer.
[1:05:41] He was preaching to kills.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; He had millions in his church.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; If you ever hear a speech of Hitler,
[1:05:50] it's just like a preaching sermon.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You'd think Ben Norrod was here, except
[1:05:53] the words are different.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Literally. That's great.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was preaching Germany and down
[1:06:02] with the Jews. They said amen to his
[1:06:05] speeches.
[1:06:06] Worship God. Put their hands up.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; And here they go into a discussion and
[1:06:17] we're just going to skip down to 22.
[1:06:18] He's talking about real worship. Matter
[1:06:21] of fact, maybe I better grab that.
[1:06:22] Sorry. And the woman answered and said
[1:06:26] here Jesus said he said bring me your
[1:06:28] husband. Sorry I I got to I we need this
[1:06:31] and thou hast and she said but I don't
[1:06:33] have a husband. He said thou well said.
[1:06:37] You know, brother Bram talked about this
[1:06:38] when when when the disciples come back
[1:06:40] and seen him. I might have a quote here,
[1:06:42] but talked about when they seen him come
[1:06:44] back, brother Bram literally said, maybe
[1:06:46] even the scripture said that the the the
[1:06:48] disciples hid in the bushes. And when
[1:06:50] they heard Jesus say, "Go get your
[1:06:53] husband," they said, "Uhoh,
[1:06:55] he just prophesied wrong.
[1:06:58] We know this woman. She's got loads of
[1:07:00] men."
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that, too.
[1:07:07] He said, "Thou has five, and whom thou
[1:07:09] are with, think your husband, thou said
[1:07:12] truly." And the woman said unto her,
[1:07:13] "Sir, I perceive thou a prophet, and our
[1:07:15] fathers," Watch this now. Now, now she's
[1:07:18] going to preach to Jesus about a
[1:07:21] physical Jesus,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; a physical God. Watch this. She said,
[1:07:25] "Now our fathers worshiped in a certain
[1:07:27] place in this mountain. And ye say that
[1:07:31] Jerusalem is a place where men ought to
[1:07:35] worship. See, God don't care about where
[1:07:37] you worship. It's in your heart where
[1:07:39] you worship. God don't care about
[1:07:41] buildings and cities and countries and
[1:07:44] mountains and hills and valleys. It's
[1:07:46] your soul.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; He's got a chosen place of worship. And
[1:07:51] Jesus said unto her,"Woman,"Woman,
[1:07:54] believe me, the hour cometh and and when
[1:07:57] ye shall neither worship in the mountain
[1:07:59] or at church or in Jerusalem, but you'll
[1:08:02] worship my father,
[1:08:04] and you shall worship. You know not
[1:08:07] what,
[1:08:09] for salvation is to the Jews. And the
[1:08:11] hour cometh now, that the true
[1:08:13] worshipper will worship the Father in
[1:08:16] Uhoh.
[1:08:17] I think we mentioned that before. spirit
[1:08:19] and truth. God's not concerned a lot
[1:08:22] about flesh.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Not not the beings and bodies and who's
[1:08:26] this and who's big and who's little and
[1:08:28] and and Jesus and all this and flesh and
[1:08:31] prophets and he not even concerned about
[1:08:33] all those things. He uses them.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; But he said you'll worship in spirit and
[1:08:37] truth
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; anywhere.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; You can't pinpoint God for the father.
[1:08:44] That's what the father seeketh worship
[1:08:46] for God is a spirit and they that
[1:08:48] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:08:50] and in truth. And the woman said unto
[1:08:52] him, I know that the Messiah Oh, see she
[1:08:55] was going back to a physical being,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; but I know there's going to be a man
[1:09:00] come by and we'll just follow that flesh
[1:09:03] around and everything will be in that
[1:09:05] man. Well, he was the fullness of the
[1:09:07] Godhead bodily, but God was a lot bigger
[1:09:09] than that body.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:12] I know when the Messiah cometh, which is
[1:09:14] called the Christ, when he cometh, that
[1:09:16] he will tell us all these things. And
[1:09:17] Jesus said,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I that speak to thee
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; am he.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And upon this came his disciples. Oh,
[1:09:27] watch this. I wish you were posting
[1:09:28] mine, Vicki, but it's all right. I put
[1:09:30] mine in capital letters. And I remember
[1:09:33] I told you about the disciples. I didn't
[1:09:34] know if it was in the quote or in the
[1:09:36] Bible.
[1:09:41] That's what we do.
[1:09:45] And upon this came his disciples and
[1:09:48] they marveled.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That we let the woman at the well sing a
[1:09:54] special.
[1:09:55] And they marveled that Jesus, this is
[1:09:58] the Lord,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; talked with a dirty person.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; They marveled. Well, our church wouldn't
[1:10:10] have fellowship with them because we're
[1:10:12] we're separate. They're dirty. They're
[1:10:15] not they're not sanctified yet.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; They they they're not sanctified and
[1:10:21] they ain't put away all these treasures
[1:10:23] of the world,
[1:10:25] you know? They're still drinking and
[1:10:27] smoking and cutting their hair and and
[1:10:30] they're they're they they got a whole
[1:10:31] bunch of husbands and wives and they go
[1:10:34] to those places that they have all kinds
[1:10:36] of crazy lights and and the disciples
[1:10:40] marveled
[1:10:42] and they're like,
[1:10:45] "I thought this was the Messiah.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I thought this was the real God.
[1:10:55] And yet none of them
[1:10:58] said,
[1:11:00] "Why seekest thou?"
[1:11:04] Or none of the disciples were big enough
[1:11:06] to say, "Lord,
[1:11:08] why talkest thou
[1:11:11] to her?"
[1:11:14] But they couldn't. The disciples could
[1:11:17] not figure out their Lord. See, we try
[1:11:19] to put Jesus in a box. We try to say, we
[1:11:23] try to put them in church order and
[1:11:24] doctrine. We try to put them in dress
[1:11:26] code. We try to put them in whatever you
[1:11:29] want to put them in. They're all good
[1:11:30] things.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; But they're not God.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is proof right here. You don't
[1:11:40] need no more proof than that.
[1:11:43] These people were completely losing
[1:11:45] their mind.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; God wasn't going to a church order where
[1:11:49] everything was perfect.
[1:11:53] You know, church, I tell you something
[1:11:57] is there's there's a problem in the
[1:11:59] environment
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; that we're living in.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That when people disagree, they divide.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; And God disagreed with being adulterous.
[1:12:11] He disagreed with everything this woman
[1:12:14] is. God disagreed with her,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; but he didn't divide.
[1:12:19] He didn't divide. I I'm just saying and
[1:12:21] and I believe me in my past is but I'm
[1:12:24] just showing you that God is different.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; God is different than you think. I'm not
[1:12:30] I'm not saying don't come here if this
[1:12:32] ain't the word of God. But this this is
[1:12:34] like the same Bible.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Is this in your Bible?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm I'm preaching a God that I
[1:12:39] didn't know when I was converted. I
[1:12:41] would have told you. Watch this. I when
[1:12:43] I would have told you when my kids I
[1:12:44] would have told you I had the baptism of
[1:12:46] the Holy Ghost. I had I was saved,
[1:12:48] sanctified, had a family, beautiful
[1:12:50] wife, and going to a spiritfilled
[1:12:53] message church.
[1:12:55] And I was backslid.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I had all that, but I was still
[1:12:59] backslid.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz I was like
[1:13:05] marveled
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; when God did something I didn't agree
[1:13:08] with. Said, "Wait a minute, God. We
[1:13:11] don't do that in church.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute, God.
[1:13:20] I
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this this morning. The
[1:13:22] disciples, they walked with Jesus.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; They slept with him
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; and they ate with him
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and they could not figure him out.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And you've walked with him
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and I've walked with him and we've
[1:13:38] talked to him
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; and I I'm still learning a whole bunch.
[1:13:44] I'm still just like,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; "What's going on here?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; What are you showing me, God?"
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I thought I was to preach against sin.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with this
[1:14:01] scripture?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus ain't preaching to her.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; He never preached to her. He never said
[1:14:08] any of the wrong sinful things.
[1:14:15] Wow. And the disciples had, watch this.
[1:14:18] I put this in brackets in mind. The
[1:14:20] disciples had a bad self-righteous
[1:14:23] spirit.
[1:14:25] We're better than her.
[1:14:27] That's a denominational spirit of
[1:14:29] putting up walls.
[1:14:31] And we don't like it that our savior, we
[1:14:34] thought was our savior,
[1:14:36] is breaking down the walls that we built
[1:14:38] up so perfectly.
[1:14:45] Wow.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be like the disciples. I
[1:14:49] want to be like Jesus.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be like Jesus. I want to be
[1:14:53] like Jesus.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; I I might I I might not understand it
[1:14:56] all. I won't understand it all. And and
[1:14:58] I'm I maybe can't even live it all,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; but I just I'd rather be aired at just
[1:15:03] being like Jesus when the woman ca was
[1:15:06] accused. He just he never responded. I'd
[1:15:09] rather people sometimes people come they
[1:15:11] say well this is wrong that's wrong
[1:15:12] that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong
[1:15:13] that's wrong what am I supposed to say
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pretend like Jesus
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I can't fix it
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; even if I agreed I couldn't fix it
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; if I could you could worship me because
[1:15:32] then I'd be God and I'm not God
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; a million trillion miles from gillion
[1:15:38] miles from that.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; You see how we get,
[1:15:43] sorry. And the woman then left the water
[1:15:46] pot, and she went into the city, and she
[1:15:49] said unto the man, "Come see a man that
[1:15:52] told me all the things. Is this not the
[1:15:54] Christ?" And I'm going to uh And they
[1:15:58] and the city came out.
[1:16:02] And Jesus just preached a short message.
[1:16:05] She said, "You say not,
[1:16:09] there is yet four months. Then cometh
[1:16:12] the harvest. Behold, I say unto you."
[1:16:15] This is what God's saying to you right
[1:16:17] now.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; and look in your community.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Look at the fields, for they are white
[1:16:25] and ready to be harvested.
[1:16:30] And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and
[1:16:32] gatherth the fruit unto life eternal,
[1:16:36] and both are brought, and both he that
[1:16:38] sweth, and he that reapeth may rejoice
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; together. Now I I want I this this
[1:16:45] really amazed me. And when you watch
[1:16:46] this, is
[1:16:49] is that preaching against sin?
[1:16:53] These people were all sinners in the
[1:16:54] city.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that.
[1:16:58] And the woman at the well had six
[1:17:00] husbands, six men. Like, why didn't
[1:17:02] Jesus use the opportunity to preach
[1:17:04] against adultery? Why didn't he use the
[1:17:06] opportunity to preach on holiness?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go harvest more souls."
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. Like, these souls
[1:17:18] haven't even give their life to you yet.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Well, the Well, the Well, watch this. I
[1:17:25] know what you're thinking. But the woman
[1:17:26] at the well left her pot and went to
[1:17:28] witness. Did it say she had given her
[1:17:30] life to God yet?
[1:17:34] I tell you what the Bible says.
[1:17:41] Let's go to 39.
[1:17:45] And many of the Samaritans of the city
[1:17:47] believed on him for the saying which the
[1:17:50] woman testified. It don't even say she's
[1:17:52] converted yet. Amen.
[1:17:57] You know what? It's better when Satan
[1:18:00] says that you're a real believer.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; When the devil and the newsmen and the
[1:18:06] government say, "Now there's something I
[1:18:08] can't understand those people." Now, I
[1:18:10] tell you what, then you got the goods.
[1:18:13] When the outside world starts saying,
[1:18:14] "Now there's go some people. I've been
[1:18:17] watching them and just everything just
[1:18:22] Ha.
[1:18:24] See, the devil looked at Jesus and he
[1:18:27] trembled. And the religious people, they
[1:18:29] said, "Well, he's the devil."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:18:37] Saying, "The woman testified, and he
[1:18:38] told me all these things that I did." So
[1:18:41] verse 40. And so when the Samaritan came
[1:18:43] unto him, they besought him that he
[1:18:46] would tarry. Jesus wasn't even to say
[1:18:48] around to do a campaign or camp meeting.
[1:18:52] And he stayed a couple days and many
[1:18:55] more believe. And many, watch this.
[1:18:57] Verse 41. And many more believed because
[1:18:59] of Jesus' own word. But the other ones
[1:19:01] had already believed before Jesus
[1:19:03] started talking
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; to a woman that hadn't even said that
[1:19:09] she was converted yet.
[1:19:12] and said unto the woman, "Now we believe
[1:19:15] because of Jesus, saying, for we have
[1:19:18] heard him ourselves, and know that
[1:19:21] indeed the Christ, the Savior
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; of the world."
[1:19:27] Wow. Now, there's three examples plus
[1:19:31] the Good Samaritan. That's four examples
[1:19:34] of God going outside what we would think
[1:19:38] of the law by well I'm not going to that
[1:19:43] church they don't have holiness I'm not
[1:19:45] going to that church they don't have
[1:19:47] church order
[1:19:49] they don't they do everything different
[1:19:50] the prophet teached
[1:19:52] so
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; so
[1:19:57] Jesus just broke what all the prophets
[1:19:59] taught the whole Bible
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; right there in four examples
[1:20:04] I know you don't like that. And if you
[1:20:06] don't, it's because you have a
[1:20:08] denominational spirit.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; I never used to like it either because I
[1:20:15] like to see that Jesus is just inside
[1:20:18] this little box and if I step outside of
[1:20:21] it, well, that's the devil.
[1:20:23] But then when God stepped outside of it,
[1:20:25] I was like, wait a minute.
[1:20:34] Now I want to show you the spirit that I
[1:20:36] had
[1:20:38] when I was 25
[1:20:41] and converted
[1:20:43] and in a message church.
[1:20:49] Acts six.
[1:20:52] Now Paul wrote Acts.
[1:20:55] You notice I'm using a lot of Bible.
[1:20:57] Pretty hard to dispute the word of God.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Pretty hard to dispute the word of God.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I never read the word of God like this
[1:21:10] before in my life.
[1:21:14] I'll tell you what, I'm going to let a
[1:21:16] lot more things slide and just let God
[1:21:19] take care of all the issues.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to fix any issues.
[1:21:26] Yeah,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; cuz I'll make a mess of them.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I'll be sticky. I'll have dirty fingers.
[1:21:33] Just stand back. Just say,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; everybody will say, "But why aren't you
[1:21:41] answering?" Same reason Jesus never
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody's talking. Lots of voices.
[1:21:50] Wow.
[1:21:52] This was me. 100% me.
[1:21:57] This is going to take a moment because
[1:21:59] we got two chapters, but we're doing
[1:22:00] really good.
[1:22:02] And in these days, the number the number
[1:22:04] of the disciples multiplied. The
[1:22:07] Christians grew. Now, now I want to tell
[1:22:09] you that the book of Acts is a true
[1:22:10] church of God.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we're now in the New Testament
[1:22:14] grace age.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is here.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody. Okay. Yeah.
[1:22:22] Perfect. Beautiful. Okay. Watch this.
[1:22:24] And so the church grew
[1:22:28] and it was hard. And so the 12 the
[1:22:30] disciples and that they could hardly
[1:22:32] control it all. And they were so busy
[1:22:35] dealing with all the little issues. And
[1:22:36] verse three, and so therefore he said,
[1:22:38] "Brethren, ye are out among us to se
[1:22:40] pick out seven honest men of full report
[1:22:43] full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom
[1:22:46] whom we may appoint over our business."
[1:22:49] And verse four, and and we give
[1:22:51] ourselves continually to prayer. The
[1:22:53] disciples were going to give them
[1:22:54] continually to prayer and ministry. But
[1:22:56] that don't mean that somebody else
[1:22:58] couldn't come and minister.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; And the same pleased the church.
[1:23:04] And they chose Stephen, a man full of
[1:23:08] faith
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and full of the Holy Ghost. Now,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; I just want to clarify something here.
[1:23:14] It was them that chose him,
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; not himself.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. that that's going to be important
[1:23:20] and and some other people and all that.
[1:23:22] And they set these apostles and they
[1:23:24] prayed uh and a great company of the
[1:23:27] priests.
[1:23:30] Let's go to sorry verse 7. And the word
[1:23:32] of the Lord increased and the number of
[1:23:34] the disciples multiplied and Jerusalem
[1:23:36] greatly. Now there was 3,000 people
[1:23:38] being added to the church a day. I mean
[1:23:40] like we could hardly keep up with the
[1:23:42] building program. I mean like it was
[1:23:44] like expanding like crazy. And the trees
[1:23:47] weren't growing fast enough to put shade
[1:23:48] over all the people. And we were running
[1:23:50] out of tarps.
[1:23:55] It increased greatly in Jerusalem. The
[1:23:57] company of the priests were obedient to
[1:24:01] the faith. And verse 8, and Stephen full
[1:24:05] of faith, power did great wonders and
[1:24:10] miracles among the people. Now that
[1:24:12] sounds like a believer.
[1:24:17] And then there arose jealousy.
[1:24:21] You know, Wednesday night we I tried to
[1:24:23] do something for the kids. And so I
[1:24:24] asked the kids, I wanted them to preach
[1:24:26] to me Wednesday night. I said, "Why did
[1:24:28] Daniel get thrown in the land then?" And
[1:24:31] and Leah said he said, "Well, cuz Daniel
[1:24:33] prayed." Well,
[1:24:35] in a way, but there was something that
[1:24:36] happened before that,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; and it was jealousy.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he got through him because of
[1:24:42] prayer, but it was the jealousy.
[1:24:45] Now let's read verse eight again. And
[1:24:47] Steven was full of faith
[1:24:50] and power and did great wonders and
[1:24:55] miracles among the people.
[1:24:58] We're okay with that. That's the Bible.
[1:25:00] He's full-fledged
[1:25:03] and a fantastic brother.
[1:25:06] And then there arose a certain
[1:25:08] synagogue. Uh-oh. They called the all
[1:25:11] these other people that fake names. You
[1:25:13] can see them there. And they disputed
[1:25:17] with Steven.
[1:25:19] Uh-oh. Problem number one.
[1:25:23] They didn't like the ministry that God
[1:25:27] that God had given to Stephen. And
[1:25:31] Stephen had the manifestation of the
[1:25:35] works of God's anointing on his life.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; They didn't like that.
[1:25:43] They were jealous. Verse 10. And they
[1:25:46] were not able to resist the wisdom and
[1:25:49] the spirit by which Stephen spake.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just jump back for a second.
[1:25:57] Now, remember, the church was growing so
[1:25:59] fast, they had to have more ministers.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; They chose Stephen for one of the
[1:26:05] ministers.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; He was number one.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; And he says he was a godly person.
[1:26:12] And it showed in the manifestations of
[1:26:14] things that he could not do in the
[1:26:16] flesh.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; So bottom line, God was with that man.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; And God's people killed him.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. What did I just say?
[1:26:34] God was with that man
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; in supernatural ways that no man could
[1:26:40] have manufactured those signs
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; and God's people
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; killed them.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; No, no. I I must I I misquote the
[1:26:50] scripture.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; No, you mean you mean wait. You mean
[1:26:55] no. God was with that man. And it wasn't
[1:26:59] just that he said he was with them, but
[1:27:01] it showed in God's manifestation in his
[1:27:04] life
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; that like he he prayed for people and
[1:27:09] they they they got healed. They had arms
[1:27:11] and eyes and mist
[1:27:15] and the people that had it happened to
[1:27:20] wait a minute.
[1:27:22] And the people it happened to in the
[1:27:24] church allowed them to murder.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Murder.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; I don't get that.
[1:27:42] Verse 11.
[1:27:44] 10. They were not able. Okay. Yeah.
[1:27:46] Verse 11. They
[1:27:50] verse verse 10. And they were not able
[1:27:52] to resist the wisdom and spirit which he
[1:27:54] spake and they killed him. Verse 11. And
[1:27:56] they were stubborn men which we have
[1:27:59] heard and speak blasphemy words against
[1:28:01] Moses. See there it goes. See, watch
[1:28:04] this. Watch. I want you to catch this
[1:28:05] verse right here. Please catch this. If
[1:28:08] you try to hold me to church order,
[1:28:11] that's what they did to Stephen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He stepped out of sight of Moses law.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Mo was Moses a prophet. Somebody say
[1:28:18] amen. Help me preach.
[1:28:21] Moses was the greatest prophet in the
[1:28:23] Old Testament.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And so I'm off the word. I stepped
[1:28:26] outside of Moses law. All right, let's
[1:28:28] let's get the stones since they're
[1:28:29] killing them. That's exactly what they
[1:28:31] did to Stephen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; They had a spirit of murder.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He blast speak blaspheming was against
[1:28:43] Moses and against God. And they stirred
[1:28:45] up the people. Uhoh.
[1:28:49] and the elders and the scribes. And it
[1:28:51] came unto them and they caught them and
[1:28:53] they brought them to the council. That's
[1:28:55] why when somebody leaves the church,
[1:28:57] it's normally just not one person that
[1:28:58] leaves.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; They normally take a bunch of people
[1:29:00] with them
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; cuz they have connections.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; And it set up false witness
[1:29:08] which said, "This man erase and speaks
[1:29:11] blaspheme against the holy place in the
[1:29:13] law. And for if we have heard him say
[1:29:15] it, that Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
[1:29:18] this place, and shall change the customs
[1:29:20] of Moses that he delivered. And all that
[1:29:23] sat in the council, I looked steadfastly
[1:29:26] upon Steven and the face. And it was as
[1:29:31] a
[1:29:33] angel.
[1:29:35] Now I I just want to just give you step
[1:29:38] in your news. If I was gonna attack
[1:29:41] somebody
[1:29:43] and I and God came down and made them
[1:29:46] look like an angel of light in front of
[1:29:48] me,
[1:29:50] even when I was stupid,
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; I think I would have caught on.
[1:29:56] Like even at 25,
[1:30:00] if the people I was attacking
[1:30:03] would have changed to an angel of light
[1:30:07] before my eyes,
[1:30:12] maybe, just maybe, that spirit, you
[1:30:15] know, that spirit is really, really
[1:30:20] strong
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; because I probably wouldn't have
[1:30:26] because they never Why would have I? I'm
[1:30:29] right. You're wrong. See, Moses was
[1:30:32] right. He's off Moses.
[1:30:34] So, we kill.
[1:30:38] See, now we, you know what the prophet
[1:30:40] said? He said, "We can't physically kill
[1:30:42] today because the government law kind of
[1:30:45] discourages that." So, we go after the
[1:30:47] person.
[1:30:49] We talk about them. We don't like where
[1:30:51] they live. They live too far, too close.
[1:30:55] We don't like how they live.
[1:31:00] Verse seven. Now, this this chapter's
[1:31:02] only got 60 verses in it. So, my but I I
[1:31:07] I
[1:31:10] priest said, "Are these things?" So, now
[1:31:13] how's Stephen supposed to answer that?
[1:31:17] Like, I want to know how is Stephen
[1:31:18] supposed to answer that? He's filled
[1:31:20] with the Holy Ghost and power and wisdom
[1:31:22] and there was miracles and signs and
[1:31:23] wonders in his midst. How is he supposed
[1:31:25] to answer that?
[1:31:29] And he said unto him, "Men and brethren,
[1:31:30] Father," and and I I want to just jump
[1:31:32] in this. I'm only going to read the
[1:31:34] highlights that I have, Vicki. But
[1:31:36] Stephen goes and he gives them the
[1:31:38] history of the whole church.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And he starts at Abraham.
[1:31:44] He said, "God appeared unto her father
[1:31:45] Abraham and said, "Go to a country and
[1:31:48] get thee out of a kindred into a land
[1:31:49] that I'll show thee." And and I'm just
[1:31:52] jumping verse six. And he said, "God
[1:31:53] spake on this wise that thy seed shall
[1:31:56] show in a strange land. Thou shalt bring
[1:31:58] them into bondage that was Egypt and
[1:32:00] retreat them of evil 400 years." And
[1:32:03] then they killed the people. And so
[1:32:05] Abraham the end of 17 or the end of
[1:32:08] eight. And so Abraham begott Isaac, and
[1:32:10] he circumcised them the eighth day. And
[1:32:12] Isaac begot Jacob. of Jacob. He got the
[1:32:14] 12 patriots in verse 9. And the patriots
[1:32:17] and and moved it with with envy and sold
[1:32:22] Joseph.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, that sounds what sold them out as
[1:32:26] they betrayed him.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; To Egypt, but God was still with him.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Why didn't God forget about him? Well,
[1:32:35] all these other Christians sold him out,
[1:32:37] so he had to be wrong.
[1:32:39] And he delivered them up to the
[1:32:40] afflictions. And he gave him favor and
[1:32:42] wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh the king
[1:32:44] in Egypt. And he made him govern over
[1:32:46] all of Egypt in his house. And his
[1:32:48] substance was amazing. The king in verse
[1:32:51] 12. And when Jacob heard they went into
[1:32:54] a famine, and Jacob heard that there was
[1:32:56] corn in Egypt, he sent his brothers
[1:32:59] sons. Verse 13. And the second Joseph,
[1:33:03] the second time the kids come, Joseph
[1:33:05] revealed himself unto his brothers and
[1:33:09] he couldn't contain himself. He cried so
[1:33:11] loud that all of Egypt heard him and
[1:33:13] Pharaoh
[1:33:14] and then sent Joseph to call his dad to
[1:33:17] come to Egypt. So here's let's just sum
[1:33:20] up. Here's Stephen telling the church,
[1:33:23] Holy Ghostfilled message church, we're
[1:33:25] in Acts. The Holy Ghost is given he's
[1:33:28] given them the history of the church.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:31] They should have already known that. But
[1:33:34] he called his his his whole family in
[1:33:36] verse 17. And the time of the promise
[1:33:38] drew nigh, which God had swore by
[1:33:40] Abraham, that the people grew in
[1:33:42] multitudes. There were 2 million by
[1:33:44] then. And another king arose that knew
[1:33:46] not
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Joseph.
[1:33:50] And and he he uh punished the people and
[1:33:53] killed the young people and the children
[1:33:55] that they would not live. And in which
[1:33:57] time Moses was born.
[1:34:02] and God was with them. And let's just
[1:34:04] jump to 24. You can, this chapter tells
[1:34:07] the whole story, but we're just trying
[1:34:08] to and and seeing that one of them. So,
[1:34:11] here's Moses. He thought, "Wait a
[1:34:13] minute. Wait a minute. We got to go back
[1:34:15] here."
[1:34:18] Moses was Pharaoh and he was cast out of
[1:34:20] Pharaoh's his Pharaoh's daughter took
[1:34:23] him and Moses learned in wisdom and
[1:34:25] deed. And he was fully 40 years old when
[1:34:29] he came to the heart to visit his own
[1:34:31] brethren in Egypt that were slaves. 40
[1:34:35] years old.
[1:34:37] Now watch what Moses mistake was. He
[1:34:41] thought the people would believe that
[1:34:42] God was with them
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; and they didn't. The Bible says that and
[1:34:47] seeing one of them suffer wrongfully,
[1:34:49] Moses defended him and avenged him that
[1:34:53] was oppressed and smoked the Egyptian
[1:34:56] for he he supported his brethren. Now
[1:34:59] that like that sounds positive
[1:35:03] and he supposed that his brethren would
[1:35:05] understand how God was by his hand and
[1:35:08] would deliver him. That was where he was
[1:35:11] wronged.
[1:35:13] He supposed that the church thought that
[1:35:16] if the minister was preaching the word
[1:35:18] of God, the Bible, the vindicated word,
[1:35:21] the message for the day, that nobody
[1:35:23] would leave that.
[1:35:26] Come on.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Moses supposed that the brethren would
[1:35:32] understand how God how God by his hand
[1:35:36] would deliver them. But they
[1:35:38] misunderstood.
[1:35:41] They said, "Well, that's not how I would
[1:35:42] do it. I wouldn't have killed the guy. I
[1:35:44] would have just hit him. I would have
[1:35:47] covered him up with a blanket and threw
[1:35:49] him in the river." Well, that that's
[1:35:51] what it sounds like.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; It always would have been a different
[1:35:55] way. I'll handle this situation.
[1:35:59] They did not understand. Verse 26. And
[1:36:01] the next day he Moses showed himself
[1:36:03] unto them as they strove, as they
[1:36:06] labored. And he and there was two of
[1:36:08] them that were disagreeing. And he says,
[1:36:10] "Sers, you are brothers.
[1:36:14] Why do you do wrong one to another?
[1:36:16] You're friends. Like, why can't you just
[1:36:18] just get along?"
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; But he that did his neighbor wrong
[1:36:25] thrusted him away, saying, "Who made
[1:36:29] thou a ruler or judge or a big person
[1:36:32] over us? Wilt thou kill me like you did
[1:36:36] the Egyptian?"
[1:36:37] Now, these were the people that were
[1:36:39] sitting in Moses church.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; They were the Jews. I mean, not
[1:36:45] literally in his church. These were the
[1:36:47] people that Moses was promised to
[1:36:49] deliver. And they hated him.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; They would have been slaves till today
[1:36:56] if it hadn't been for Moses.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; That's That's unbelievable.
[1:37:07] He said, "Wilt thou kill me like thou
[1:37:10] did the Egyptian yesterday?" And Moses
[1:37:13] fled. You know why Moses fled? He fled
[1:37:16] from the very people he was ordained to
[1:37:20] deliver. He fled from the very people
[1:37:24] that should have gave their life to love
[1:37:27] and support him. He fled from the very
[1:37:30] people he was showing the truth to.
[1:37:33] and he fled because they hated they
[1:37:35] didn't understand him
[1:37:37] saying, "Was this a stranger?" And so he
[1:37:40] went and he found his wife in the
[1:37:41] wilderness and had a couple kids. And
[1:37:43] the angel of the Lord came to him in the
[1:37:45] burning bush.
[1:37:47] And the Lord said unto him, "I am God of
[1:37:49] thy father, the God of Abraham, the God
[1:37:51] of Isaac, the God of Jacob." And Moses
[1:37:53] trembled
[1:37:57] and dust not. And and he he just didn't
[1:38:00] know what to do. When the Lord said unto
[1:38:01] him, "Put off thy shoes of thy feet, for
[1:38:04] the place I'll stand is holy ground."
[1:38:06] Now, let let's just jump out of this.
[1:38:07] Now, this is Stephen preaching to the
[1:38:10] church. Let me give you an example. What
[1:38:13] did Stephen say wrong so far?
[1:38:17] Is everything Stephen saying like in the
[1:38:19] Bible?
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Like it it actually was history. It was
[1:38:23] like a history lesson, but it was Bible
[1:38:25] how God had worked through the people.
[1:38:27] Like, was Stephen off is what I'm trying
[1:38:29] to say. No.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. He wasn't off yet. And this
[1:38:33] Moses whom they refused, saying, Whom
[1:38:35] made thee ruler or judge over, the same
[1:38:37] did God send to be ruler and deliver by
[1:38:41] the hand of the angel and appeared unto
[1:38:43] him by the bush.
[1:38:45] Now, I'm just going to jump to 48.
[1:38:50] You're going to have to read that in
[1:38:51] between cuz we got And how be it that
[1:38:54] the most here here. So, Stephven's still
[1:38:56] preaching to the church. He said, "How
[1:38:58] be it? The Most High dwelleth not in
[1:39:01] clay and buildings and traditions and
[1:39:05] creeds and temples made of hands. Don't
[1:39:09] get too caught up in the the messenger.
[1:39:11] Get caught up in the spirit of God.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up in the preacher.
[1:39:16] Get caught up in the spirit that he's
[1:39:18] delivering. Don't get too caught up in
[1:39:20] the prophet. Get caught up in the spirit
[1:39:22] of Jehovah that's delivering that's
[1:39:24] coming out of his mouth." He said that
[1:39:26] God dwell in temples made hands as saeth
[1:39:29] the prophets. Heaven is my throne and
[1:39:32] earth is my foottool. And what house
[1:39:34] will you build me sayeth the Lord or the
[1:39:36] place of my rest? Hath not my hands made
[1:39:39] all these things? Ye stiff necked and
[1:39:42] uncircumcised of ears heart and ears.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Ye do always resist God.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; As your fathers do, so do ye.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. which the prophets and
[1:39:55] your fathers you persecuted. Let's just
[1:39:58] jump to 54. And when they heard these
[1:40:01] things, oh buddy, he had really ticked
[1:40:04] them off. Now
[1:40:06] they were cut in their heart and they
[1:40:08] gassed him with their teeth. Now wait a
[1:40:11] minute. Wait a minute. Wait there. This
[1:40:14] was a Holy Ghostfilled
[1:40:16] message church.
[1:40:20] And the preacher had just get done
[1:40:22] preaching the life history of God's
[1:40:25] movement in the church from Father
[1:40:27] Abraham.
[1:40:30] And Stephen had the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:33] wisdom and power and did great signs and
[1:40:36] wonders that was impossible
[1:40:39] for him to do.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And they are teeth 55. And he being
[1:40:48] filled of the Holy Ghost looked up
[1:40:50] steadfast to heaven and saw the glory of
[1:40:52] God and Jesus stand at the right hand of
[1:40:54] God. That's power. And saith, behold, I
[1:40:56] see the heavens open and the son of man
[1:40:58] standing at the right hand of God. And
[1:41:00] 57 And then they cried out with a loud
[1:41:02] voice and stopped their ears and stopped
[1:41:06] their ears.
[1:41:08] That's about 50 or more% of most message
[1:41:11] so-called believers. And they stopped
[1:41:13] their ears.
[1:41:14] And they stopped their ears and said,
[1:41:16] "I'm gonna stay home and listen to press
[1:41:18] play and or I ain't gonna stay home at
[1:41:20] all. I ain't gonna do this and I ain't
[1:41:22] gonna" and they stopped their ears and
[1:41:24] they ran upon him in one accord
[1:41:28] and they cast him out of the city and
[1:41:30] stoned him and the witnesses
[1:41:33] and 59 and they stoned Stephen and
[1:41:36] called upon God stoning him. Mhm.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; And calling upon God and saying, and
[1:41:48] here Steven's talking now, saying, "Lord
[1:41:50] Jesus, receive my spirit." And he knelt
[1:41:53] down and cried aloud with a loud voice.
[1:41:55] And Jesus, lay not this sin against
[1:42:00] their charge.
[1:42:03] You want to talk about the spirit of
[1:42:06] Christ and compassion?
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Look at Stephen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I can't think I like I know crucifixion
[1:42:14] is probably the most torturable death,
[1:42:16] but stoning's got to be second. I can't
[1:42:19] imagine being someplace and being killed
[1:42:21] by people hurling stones at me.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; I want to know where Steven went wrong.
[1:42:34] Where did Stephen leave the word?
[1:42:37] Any of Acts seven must be off because
[1:42:40] that's what he told him he believed.
[1:42:42] Acts seven,
[1:42:44] he was vindicated by God by signs and
[1:42:48] wonders and miracles and power. They
[1:42:49] couldn't fight him because of the
[1:42:50] wonders. You know what it was? Jealousy.
[1:42:55] Jealousy.
[1:42:57] Jealousy. I'll get you for that. That's
[1:43:00] the same spirit that that boy left his
[1:43:03] home and drove three hours in the
[1:43:05] states, took preparation for it, went to
[1:43:09] a strange college, walked through the
[1:43:10] whole college, went on a roof and lined
[1:43:12] up an innocent person,
[1:43:16] that he was raised in a church, and his
[1:43:18] youth leader turned him in.
[1:43:21] You know what they now accompanied to
[1:43:23] it? He was living with a transgender
[1:43:26] person.
[1:43:28] And Charles was very opposed to that
[1:43:32] lifestyle.
[1:43:34] His lover
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; was the guy that was becoming a woman.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And rather than just go ahead and live
[1:43:46] your life, said I'll kill you for that.
[1:43:50] And that's the identical spirit of
[1:43:52] murder
[1:43:54] in churches today. You want to hear what
[1:43:56] the prophet says? And you people that
[1:43:59] got a buzzaw temper and that's spilling
[1:44:03] out of the mouth of somebody and you
[1:44:06] can't put the things like that. Be
[1:44:08] careful.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Because you're guilty if you speak one
[1:44:12] word against your brother.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; That's not right.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Not just go around and you can go around
[1:44:20] tear me down. Makes no difference. You
[1:44:22] can go around tear down anybody. Fill
[1:44:23] your boots.
[1:44:25] But don't have to stick a knife in a
[1:44:27] man's back to kill him. You can break
[1:44:30] his character and kill him. Kill his
[1:44:32] influence. Speak against your pastor
[1:44:34] here and say something bad about him and
[1:44:37] you might as well have shot him.
[1:44:40] Told him something that wasn't right
[1:44:41] about him. You'll kill his influence and
[1:44:44] the people and things and you're guilty.
[1:44:50] Uh
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; that ain't the one I wanted.
[1:44:57] Well, I missed the quote.
[1:45:00] Well, I have to preach part three.
[1:45:01] That's all there is to that.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go.
[1:45:11] No, I I had another multiple places,
[1:45:15] brother. Maybe that was You don't have
[1:45:16] to kill him. You can kill them. You're
[1:45:18] guilty of murder. Multiple places.
[1:45:20] Brother Bram said you would be guilty of
[1:45:22] murder,
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; but you never killed the person. He said
[1:45:26] he he said places like this. He said the
[1:45:28] law would hinder you from killing them
[1:45:31] because you don't want to go to prison.
[1:45:33] So you will do it another way to keep
[1:45:35] you out of prison. That's the exact same
[1:45:39] devil.
[1:45:43] Exact same devil.
[1:45:45] You see the same devil. You see, God
[1:45:48] don't rate devils and sin. Unbelief
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; is sin.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:46:00] Let's just I'm just winding down here.
[1:46:05] I have some other scriptures. Luke
[1:46:07] 6:27-37,
[1:46:09] but I'm going to
[1:46:12] let's just read Luke uh 6:35. I I have
[1:46:15] more than that down, but it says, "Love
[1:46:17] your enemies, do good to them, lend,
[1:46:20] hoping for nothing in return, and your
[1:46:22] reward shall be great, and ye shall be
[1:46:24] the children of the highest. For his
[1:46:27] kind, and onto unthankful, and to the
[1:46:30] evil, for ye be therefore merciful, as
[1:46:34] your father
[1:46:36] also is merciful."
[1:46:39] That's eternal life. That's Luke 6:27-37
[1:46:43] if you want to read that. Here in
[1:46:45] Matthew 7, it says, "Therefore, the
[1:46:46] things whichsoever you would that a man
[1:46:49] would do to you, even so do them,
[1:46:54] do ye unto them."
[1:46:57] Amen. I want to close with this. Uh
[1:47:00] the one quote I think I missed, but I I
[1:47:03] multiple multiple none of these quotes
[1:47:05] were cherrypicked. multiple murder and
[1:47:07] killing each other was the same issues.
[1:47:10] He said the gospel Paul said go into all
[1:47:13] the world and preach the gospel manifest
[1:47:15] and demonstrate demonstration of the
[1:47:17] Holy Spirit is a live reaction to God
[1:47:21] moving among the members of the body. He
[1:47:24] said, "Now, if it's a pumpkin vine,
[1:47:27] it'll bear a pumpkin. And if it's a
[1:47:30] watermelon vine, it'll be bear a
[1:47:33] watermelon. And if it's a grape vine,
[1:47:36] it'll have grapes. And if it's a
[1:47:38] Christian vine, then Christ will be in
[1:47:42] the church. And he will enhance his
[1:47:44] branches that's in him to bear the
[1:47:47] fruits that he did when he was here on
[1:47:50] earth." Now, I want to ask you,
[1:47:53] this Christ that we've talked about the
[1:47:55] last two Sundays is a lot different than
[1:47:58] the Christ I was serving when I was 25,
[1:48:03] when I was 30,
[1:48:05] when I was 35.
[1:48:08] It's a lot different than the Christ
[1:48:10] that most of us
[1:48:14] sometimes maybe would think.
[1:48:19] We love the letter,
[1:48:21] but we don't like the life.
[1:48:24] We love being able to pinpoint the
[1:48:26] message. Well, bless God. I got a quote
[1:48:27] for that. Well, what are we going to do
[1:48:29] with these quotes?
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Anytime anybody tells me that they got a
[1:48:33] quote for something? I said, well, what
[1:48:35] do you want me to do with these quotes?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You got a scripture. Well, what do you
[1:48:39] want me to do with these four
[1:48:40] scriptures? I know what to do. Let's not
[1:48:44] read them.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's not Let's just not talk
[1:48:48] about them. Let's just maybe we won't
[1:48:50] like take them out of the Bible, but we
[1:48:52] won't never mention them.
[1:49:00] Really?
[1:49:03] My last quote. I put this in this
[1:49:06] morning. I wasn't going to read this and
[1:49:08] I used, you know, there's I'm not just
[1:49:10] cherrypicking this. Daniel, they did the
[1:49:11] same thing. It was jealousy that put
[1:49:13] Daniel in the lion's den because Daniel
[1:49:16] was chosen number one most trusted
[1:49:18] servant to the king.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Number one Daniel and their desire was
[1:49:23] to kill him.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; That spirit is very healthy.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Very healthy.
[1:49:29] We don't have lion's den anymore, but we
[1:49:32] have that same spirit.
[1:49:34] God help us. God help me.
[1:49:37] just just I don't have to I don't have
[1:49:40] to make you wrong to make me right and
[1:49:43] feel bigger.
[1:49:46] But let's just trust God that if you're
[1:49:48] wrong or I'm wrong and we're God's,
[1:49:51] he'll bring us to the right in his own
[1:49:54] good time.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And nothing else matter. Like is eternal
[1:49:58] life all that matters?
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; I'd rather have not church order and
[1:50:04] doctrine and have eternal life.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'd rather not have
[1:50:07] holiness and have church order and
[1:50:08] doctrine.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I'd rather not be right and still have
[1:50:12] eternal life
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; because all these situations,
[1:50:17] four of them, five of them if you call
[1:50:19] Daniel are so in the Bible.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Let me read you something. Our prophet
[1:50:26] said, "Your prophet." Now, this is this
[1:50:28] is really outside the thing. You know,
[1:50:29] I've had message pastors in Ontario
[1:50:34] disagree with this.
[1:50:36] It's okay.
[1:50:39] I love him dearly.
[1:50:43] This might really But this is what the
[1:50:46] prophet said. If we, you know, you got
[1:50:48] the wrong pastor to not read everything
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; if it's in the Bible, I'm going to apply
[1:50:54] it.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not cherry-picking it when I can
[1:50:57] find five or four different scriptures
[1:50:59] history.
[1:51:01] A baby's a baby when it's formed. The
[1:51:06] very first germ in a mother's womb,
[1:51:10] it's a baby.
[1:51:13] And I'm firmly against
[1:51:16] birth control.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; See? Yes, sir. For where it is just as
[1:51:24] much harm to take a life of a little
[1:51:28] baby that ain't months old than to put a
[1:51:31] pistol and shoot a man down in cool
[1:51:33] blood.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Murder. Yes, sir. I'm against birth
[1:51:39] control. What God sends you,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; God will take care of.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; That's notice that is wrong to do that.
[1:51:51] That's right.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; That's the babies right there.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; It's a life
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; from the very first germ.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; I've had multiple message churches. I
[1:52:09] had my kids come and tell me that people
[1:52:12] from other message churches believed it
[1:52:14] was all right to do an abortion if it
[1:52:16] you know just happened take the pill the
[1:52:17] next day pill or do something like that
[1:52:19] cuz you know it wasn't some that wasn't
[1:52:22] you know
[1:52:25] wasn't
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; it wasn't like you know make I don't
[1:52:31] care if it's rape or anything it's a
[1:52:33] life makes no difference mistake rape
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; molested beating upside down,
[1:52:39] non-planned.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And there's message pastors
[1:52:45] that teach against this. They told me,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; they say, "Well, that sister could never
[1:52:49] find a husband if she has an
[1:52:51] illegitimate child."
[1:52:53] How's that justify the word?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; And I I just sit there and I'm like,
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; "Wow,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; am I old?
[1:53:09] Amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Murder. We're talking about what must we
[1:53:13] have to have eternal life. And let I'm
[1:53:16] going to close with this. Matter of
[1:53:17] fact, you can come. Let's stand. The
[1:53:19] opposite of what must we have to have
[1:53:21] eternal life is murder.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; It's one word. If you're not in the
[1:53:27] spirit of giving eternal life, you're a
[1:53:31] murderer.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; You You know what? You know what? I I
[1:53:36] I'm going to read tell you some things
[1:53:37] from memory. I read believe me I read
[1:53:39] all these quotes really nice. Brother
[1:53:41] Brandham compared that to that in in our
[1:53:44] day God said if you look upon a woman
[1:53:48] and had a thought it was the same as
[1:53:50] doing the act. That's exact same as the
[1:53:52] murder we're talking about. If you think
[1:53:54] about me in an evil way, you've already
[1:53:57] committed the murder
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; because it went through your mind.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I hate that man.
[1:54:04] I hate that man.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; That's what your prophet
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; said. He said, "I'm going to bring you a
[1:54:10] new law." You know, the old law was if
[1:54:12] you touch a woman, if you lay with a
[1:54:14] woman, you've commit adultery. He said
[1:54:15] if you look upon her,
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; you've already done it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; The old law was if you shoot him, that's
[1:54:20] wrong. But if you can get by with just
[1:54:22] hating him,
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; you've skinned through. No. No. But this
[1:54:26] is a new law
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; that if you look upon a brother or
[1:54:31] sister, a human being
[1:54:36] and desire, watch this. If you look upon
[1:54:39] a germ
[1:54:42] the next morning say, "Oh, what did I
[1:54:44] do?
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; That's murder. You're a murderer.
[1:54:49] You had the thought that's a spirit of
[1:54:52] murder.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Pass through your mind.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; God, I want to be a I want to be a God
[1:55:10] man
[1:55:12] of grace and mercy
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; and compassion. I won't have no answers.
[1:55:18] Why do you allow that? I don't know why
[1:55:20] God allowed it. I like changing that.
[1:55:23] See, you thought, why do you allow this
[1:55:25] in your church? I don't know why God
[1:55:26] allowed that in the church.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; You thought you were like sometimes you
[1:55:31] think a man or a church is going to have
[1:55:33] like a perfect,
[1:55:35] you know, there's not a man alive or a
[1:55:37] woman alive. It's got a perfect family.
[1:55:39] Why didn't you fix your family?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; If you could fix them, you would be more
[1:55:44] than a human.
[1:55:47] So why do you think a minister can fix?
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know why God allows his people
[1:55:55] to sin and he still forgives them. But
[1:55:57] there's a word for it. It's called
[1:55:58] grace.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; It's called compassion and mercy.
[1:56:03] Amen.
[1:56:04] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:56:07] Wow. I it just it just this just
[1:56:10] unfolded like so much.
[1:56:14] I made so many mistakes.
[1:56:19] I I I told you about my some of my
[1:56:22] little not little, forgive me, God, huge
[1:56:25] mistakes
[1:56:27] so you don't have to repeat them. That's
[1:56:30] what elders are supposed to do. That's
[1:56:33] why the older women talk to the younger
[1:56:35] women. And I'm not an older brother, but
[1:56:38] I'm telling you, Brother Dale dropped
[1:56:40] the ball hugely when I was a so-called
[1:56:45] perfect holy roller.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; I read a thing when we were gone
[1:56:55] on a door yesterday.
[1:56:58] I want to close with this
[1:57:00] that said Christians
[1:57:03] are not perfect,
[1:57:05] but they're forgiven.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; This church is not perfect,
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; but I still love you and I don't even
[1:57:15] care. You're forgiven.
[1:57:23] So, if you're looking for perfection,
[1:57:26] probably won't see you again cuz we'll
[1:57:29] be in two different camps
[1:57:32] cuz there's no perfection around brother
[1:57:34] Dale.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; There's no perfection, but his
[1:57:37] perfection.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yeah.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; I want to invite it all over me,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; inside me and everything. Amen. Oh, he's
[1:57:46] amazing. It just he's an amazing Lord.
[1:57:49] Amen. Let's
[1:57:52] Wow. We have come into his house. We
[1:57:56] have come into his house. We're gathered
[1:58:00] in
[1:58:02] to worship him.
[1:58:07] We have come into his house. We're
[1:58:11] gather in his name to worship him.
[1:58:19] We have come to his house. We're g
[1:58:26] to worship Christ the Lord.
[1:58:32] Worship him.
[1:58:37] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:58:42] Oh just forget about yourself.
