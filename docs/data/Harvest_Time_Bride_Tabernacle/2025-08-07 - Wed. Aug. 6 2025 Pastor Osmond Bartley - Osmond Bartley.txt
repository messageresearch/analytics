Um, man, just uh one thing uh I was kind of I was going to mention I was um the last couple days I was uh doing a little railing job for uh um some folks. I' I've done decent work for them different times over the years, you know, and and uh but this railing we're doing for them. Um his wife has um the like cancer in the bone and uh they don't know where it is or or either they can't find it or they won't find it, you know. Uh it's sad to sad to say, but that's just the reality of our Canadian healthc care, you know. But uh um you know and I just uh like I mean uh I just it was kind of heavy on my heart. You know I'm putting the they've they've lived in the house for like 20 years and the steps are only two steps high. It's like this this platform height but she needs a railing to get up and up and down now. And and her biggest concern was that they could either fit a stretcher or a casket out through it. So when she's done with it and it just it's like wow what a you know what a sad uh thing to see you know so just uh just keep her in your prayers. Uh um I'm not even sure what her name is, but his his name is her husband's name is Doug Lindsay, and you know, we've done uh known them for quite a few years, you know, but it just uh it just kind of was a sad thing to see, you know, and uh but uh yeah, it's just uh &gt;&gt; leave that uh leave that to him.

One day I'm moving to my brand new home. I'm blessed beyond measure. Just look close, you'll see. My Lord is taking good care of me. I'm counting my blessings as a journey along. Good friends and a family and a place to call home. The church where I worship, the Bible I read. My Lord is taking good care of me. I'm never forsaken. I'm never alone. One day I'm moving to my brand new home. I'm blessed beyond measure. Just look close, you'll see. My Lord is taking good care of me. When Satan comes, tempts me, and he brings up my past.

[Music] Oh Lord, how long till my toiling ends and you call me home? Since I caught a glimpse of my home in the sky, nothing in this world keeps me sisfied. [Music] Is that the light of all I see? Do I feel a breeze [Applause] from the crystal sea? Is that the Lord standing high on heaven's balcony? [Applause] At the lights unfold, it's a welcome sight to me. Seems I can hear the angels sing with harms of gold and a thousand strings. Earth holds no charm when I hear their song. Sweet the land, my home sweet home is at the light of all I see. Do I feel a breeze from the crystal sea? Is that the Lord standing high on heaven's balcony? Is that the lights of home? It's a welcome sight to me. Praise his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing the more the more that I surrender, the lighter my load. The more that I surrender, the more that I release my cares, the more he takes control, the more that I can humble myself, the more he lifts me up. Every day I live, Lord, I love you more. And it gets easier to understand this road I'm traveling down. No more wavering or wondering. I'm standing on solid ground and I know I'm headed to my future home. And the voice I hear is yours alone. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. The more that I surrender, the lighter my love, the more that I release my cares, the more he takes control.

Bless us and Lord bless our family here and those that will be not will not be here tonight. Bless them also in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. you you you know you just just stand in just turn with me to the book of Luke &gt;&gt; chapter uh 21 and I just felt led in my heart that I just want to do a short little teaching here um you know and just just talk about season. &gt;&gt; Amen. season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to the book of Ecclesiastic chapter 3, he says everything governed by season. God created seasons, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, and so everything and so I just want to do a little teaching and amen, &gt;&gt; you know, um uh is this right? &gt;&gt; Oh, the clock is lying to me. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. Um and so Luke chapter 21, let's read. Okay, let's read um from verse 8. All right. Luke chapter 1 21 verse 8. I I I I use I will use brother Luke's version, &gt;&gt; you know, to teach on this season &gt;&gt; and the standing season here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said and Jesus speaking, right? Because you remember &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; when um the disciples asked him actually three questions, but let me show you just a few of the end time. Verse eight. And he said, "Take heed that you be not deceived. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draw it near. Go ye not therefore after them." &gt;&gt; But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified, for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not by and by. All right. Okay, good. And so then he said, "Then said he unto them, nations shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places, and famines, and pestilence, and fearful sights, and uh great signs shall there be from heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 12 says, "But before all these things shall they lay hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Verse 13, he now remember verse 12. He was directing that to the disciples. the &gt;&gt; apostles. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And so we said in verse 13, "And it shall turn to you for a testimony." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not for you and I. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now jump to verse 25. And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring men's art failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of heaven shall be shaken. Very interesting. Verse 27 is very very important. Pay keen attention to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then, and then shall they see, &gt;&gt; then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Right. With power and great glory. &gt;&gt; All right. Now he says, "And when these things begin to come to pass, which the wars and all these things &gt;&gt; in the midst of that, you're going to they they" that's very very important. We're going to see that uh begin to come to pass. He said, "Then look up. Look up. Lift up your heads for your &gt;&gt; redemption." &gt;&gt; Redemption joy now. He never say the redemption, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You have the redemption and you have your redemption. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. So your the pronoun your redemption draw it nigh. All right. And he says behold the fig tree and the trees and the and the and all the trees when they now shoot forth that mean or I think Matthew says when they put forth their buds &gt;&gt; you see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at end. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. You know, so Jesus said, you're already familiar with seasons, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So when you see certain things coming forth &gt;&gt; from the plans, the next season is summer. &gt;&gt; The next season is summer. Know that summer is near. So if he says summer is near, that mean you actually in spring, &gt;&gt; right? Because after spring comes summer. &gt;&gt; So the understanding is do you really know the season? &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. &gt;&gt; All right, you be seated for a few minutes and you know and just may the Lord just bless you heart. Glad to be with you saints. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you know, um it's a blessing to have Barbara with us this &gt;&gt; this this this time around, &gt;&gt; right? I think this is my third time here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so she she's being with us and so I really really appreciate you're traveling with us and you know we travel all over the world together and that's that's a blessing from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glad to be you can't hear me clearly right? &gt;&gt; Okay good. Um glad to be with you all and you know see my brothers and sisters here and I really really appreciate you &gt;&gt; really really appreciate you all you know &gt;&gt; and I am one person I believe in purpose and predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really believe in predestination. You know we talk about the prophet say this, the prophet said that and if the prophet don't say it, it's not right. And you know when you try to tell people that that very prophet tell you to go back to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Isn't it right? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The very prophet tell now and I keep saying this to persons. You know you can read a thousand message books and you don't understand the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The most important book given to us to understand is this Bible. &gt;&gt; All right. And so, you know, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, a lot of us preach and and I want us to understand that not because I we are preachers, we're going to be in the rapture, &gt;&gt; right? No way. &gt;&gt; Every one of us have to get the same rapture in faith, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there is no big preacher up here that's going to get a a bigger a bigger star in his crown than everybody else. And &gt;&gt; oh, you don't preach so you don't you're not going to get any. Every one of us have to have rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; Every one of us. &gt;&gt; And you know when the prophet said we're not leaving anybody out, what I mean is that not because you may know more than everybody else that you're going to go off first. &gt;&gt; No, we're going to go together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so something here I I want us to look at the the the full redemption, &gt;&gt; right? We are we are partially now redeemed, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not fully redeemed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so it is not a time to slumber or sleep. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I I like that song. I feel the pull. Yeah, that's right. Right. &gt;&gt; What creates that feeling &gt;&gt; is what is happening around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man, what an I felt I felt an anointing comes right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon my personal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the se you know when you talk about season and why many times we have f and we fight and separation and we argue. It can be a misunderstanding of season, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It can be. &gt;&gt; What I mean that is that within within an age you have many seasons, &gt;&gt; many seasons in one age like the whole year, &gt;&gt; more than one season is in one year, &gt;&gt; you know. And so look at this for example and I and I'm just laying a foundation here is that when you understand God called Moses &gt;&gt; to lead the people out of Egypt into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Yes he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the age start when they exit Egypt &gt;&gt; and supposed to finish when they enter the promise. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God don't stop a middle. No, &gt;&gt; no, &gt;&gt; no. But what happened is that within an h there are more than one dispensations. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Under Moses dispensation, they cross the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the method how they cross the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Look at what happened under Moses administration within the same age. Then God changed it from Moses to Joshua. &gt;&gt; Right? He did. &gt;&gt; Same age, &gt;&gt; same promise, same purpose, but the method is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; He can he will change methods. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the purpose remain the same. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; So now on the Joshua there is a Jordan to cross. &gt;&gt; The method was different. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was. &gt;&gt; But the purpose was the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so here we are and we are in an age &gt;&gt; in this age different dispensation. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we we know God sent a prophet and God took the prophet off the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a ministry has to carry the people to the rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; Not to the rapture, &gt;&gt; but rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; Now, where and when have you seen that the gifts and the manifestation of the power of God? Stop following the believers. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the sign shall follow the believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have gone so cold and formal and we become like a little theological school &gt;&gt; and we're trying to educate each other of quotes and you know we're so dead and no manifestation &gt;&gt; of the power of God among God's people and when you know when the uh people see the manifestation of the gifts &gt;&gt; you know they try to beat you down and say oh the prophet says focus on the word. But the very word the prophet said focus on is the same word that said the signs &gt;&gt; follow the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The signs follow the believers. &gt;&gt; Do you know that very same prophet would point us and says, "Okay, let me read it. I'm going to read it for you for us. All right. &gt;&gt; It is just teaching." &gt;&gt; And so we're understanding the season that we're in. We are entering into a new season, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I read that the other day at the tent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said for war to come, the people has to get in the spirit of war, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For war. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He said for the for judgment to take the people into the anti-oluvian age, &gt;&gt; right? under Noah, the people got in that spirit, right? &gt;&gt; And brought judgment, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So for us to have a translation, &gt;&gt; we have to get in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now listen this. He said, "What will it be when we when we truly have full redemption? Won't it be wonderful? He said, "If I am promised the resurrection of this mortal pest house that I live in here, if I have been promised a redemption of a new body, &gt;&gt; we this is the whole press house." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a promise &gt;&gt; that I'm going to have a new body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So shouldn't there be some anxiety and expectation in me that I want to have a new body? It's not time to sleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, we we have that. Okay, let me go further. As long as you love the world or the things of the world and the love of God is not in you. But as long as you are above that, then you know that you have your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you are on your road to your full Hallelujah. You are full redemption. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your full redemption. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, we are looking towards a full redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, let me go further. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, when we look at this full redemption, what are we talking about within this dispensation? &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Jesus said to his disciples, "In the hand you're going to hear of false anointed ones. &gt;&gt; For there to be falls, you have to be a genuine, &gt;&gt; right?" Amen. &gt;&gt; So the false anointed ones will be rising. Now, why will they be rising? Because the season is right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The season is ready for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. And now he says in this season you're going to hear of war. You're going to hear of commotions and people's heart will be failing for fear. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You're not just talking about emotional distress, &gt;&gt; physical distress, &gt;&gt; but it will also be spiritual distress. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And this is truth. Spiritual distress &gt;&gt; is going to take place &gt;&gt; mentally. People are failing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; People are confused, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it now come down in their spiritual life. People are confused, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; People lose sight of focus. They uh they lose sight of promise. &gt;&gt; They lose sight of purpose. and they forget the the the full meaning of predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were destined to be in this age. &gt;&gt; We were predestinated unto the adoption of children &gt;&gt; by Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; If God says it, he means it. &gt;&gt; That's right. And if God, let me say this sense of God, God never send us on a path blindfolded. &gt;&gt; He give us the materials we need to go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God give us the material and sent us on a journey, why do we get lost? &gt;&gt; Why are we confused? There are two things. We never understood what he says &gt;&gt; or we got distracted. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's either of two. It's either we never understood what Jesus Christ says, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or we got distracted. &gt;&gt; So many things distracting us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or some of us just not listening to what God is saying. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; We're just not listening. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in the last days there's going to be war, rumors of war. And he says, "Oh, these things will come to pass, but the end is not yet." &gt;&gt; Look at the season now. He says greater quakes in different places and famine and pestilence and remember now in the famine can be spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; The war can be spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Just as we have physical war in the east every day &gt;&gt; civil war all over &gt;&gt; then you have a tariff war &gt;&gt; taking place. You have spiritual war also. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You have natural famine. You have spiritual famine. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; In all of this, Jesus says in the midst of this, you're going to have false anointed ones. &gt;&gt; Rise up and says, I am Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He also said in Matthew 24, many will say, he's in the desert. &gt;&gt; He's in this place. He's in that place. Jesus said, don't you go after them. Why would he say that? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Why would he say that? &gt;&gt; Because at that season, Christ will never be found in a geographical location. &gt;&gt; Christ will be found in a person. &gt;&gt; In a person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a season where people looking for Christ, looking for someone to say something &gt;&gt; and Jesus is say don't go. Then you would ask him the question, "Oh, oh, then where will you be?" Jesus is saying, "I will not be found in a location. I will be found in a body." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll be found in a body. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, he says, "Now, look at this season. A time in men's heart, people's heart are melting for fear and chaos on the hurt. Every system now is under confusion. Governments, countries, everything is failing &gt;&gt; because they are confused. &gt;&gt; And it's not that they refusing God. It's just a season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke it. It is not that people running away from God, &gt;&gt; but it's just the season. &gt;&gt; Jesus said this season. Why? He predestinated the season at this time. Notice what he said again. He said, "And they shall see the son of man what? Coming in a cloud." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Not on the cloud. &gt;&gt; Right? So &gt;&gt; how you saying now no this is not the rapture &gt;&gt; right? No &gt;&gt; this is not the rapture &gt;&gt; but we are so we are so what do you call it now? We get so complacent &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; when we talk about the rapture today to each other &gt;&gt; we in a stage that we're driving people back into a slumbering condition. &gt;&gt; That's right. We talk about the rapture and when you talk about the rapture, they're just closed the eyes and looking to sail off in some place. &gt;&gt; The rapture is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The rapture is in us. &gt;&gt; Has to come forth. &gt;&gt; The rapture is a package. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints of God is a package. Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; it's not you sitting at the door of a train uh uh in a train station with a ticket ready to hear your name call. &gt;&gt; We The Bible says the dead in Christ will rise first. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we which are alive and remain shall be what? Caught up to meet him where? In the hair. &gt;&gt; The world will not see man. No cloud. But during this season, there will be a people that will be understanding the season because Jesus said, "Notice the fig tree. Look at the season. You know what season is next." So you are now vigilant. You are now aware of what season is coming. He said that generation will not pass because they'll be observing the season. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He said that generation will see the son of man coming in a cloud. &gt;&gt; When you come in a cloud, he's coming clothed in a cloud. &gt;&gt; With what? Power and glory. &gt;&gt; Not the world. &gt;&gt; The word she mean understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to see that mean you're already aware. That's why you're looking for it. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. You're looking for it. &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting in church and Wednesday night is just an ordinary night and you're looking for something. No, you are looking for a manifestation. &gt;&gt; You're looking for an appearance. &gt;&gt; You have coming and you have appearance. I cannot keep still in a season like this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm yearning to see the dead raised. &gt;&gt; I'm yearning to see the sick ill. I'm yearning to see the dumb talk. &gt;&gt; I'm yearning to hear some prophecies. Glory to God. Hallelujah. People stop speaking in tongues in church. Now being in a church and the word of God finished preach and a lady barber was there. Amen. And a lady stood at the back and she spoke in tongues and the whole church went frightened. What is Nothing is wrong. It's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; It's in the scriptures. Hallelujah. It's in the word and the interpretation came over. Why? Because God has to be again in his church. &gt;&gt; Don't go over there. Don't go there. He's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Bringing the people back to rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that truth? Is that the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the word says when you see these things, look up. &gt;&gt; Look up. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you It doesn't mean to lift up. Lift up lift up your head. He He said two things. He said look up. One, lift up your head. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The word look up doesn't mean go outside and look in the cloud. See &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; No. The the state the that phrase look up mean retain your hope. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If I said brother Dale, how is your being this year? You said brother Bartley is looking at that mean there is hope. &gt;&gt; So in spite of the heart's failing in during the war during the season &gt;&gt; he says you need to retain your hope. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Retain your hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Retain your faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lift up your heads is a statement they use. Change your mood. &gt;&gt; Regain your confidence. Change your perspective. Shift your focus. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God Christ was saying to a generation that is seeing these things happening on the earth within that season. He says don't be caught up in what's happening. He said go retain your hope of a body change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He said change your mood. Change your atmosphere. Glory to God. Why? Because you are looking towards your full redemption. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The soul is already being redeemed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; What you saw in Revelation chapter 5, glory to God, is our representation. When you saw the lamb came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. Remember said no man could. Hallelujah. No man could. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the lamb came. And remember the lamb was just one attribute of the great God. &gt;&gt; There are many attributes in this God. Hallelujah. And the lamb came and took the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne. What was that? That was the manifestation of redemption. &gt;&gt; If you notice Revelation 5 from verse uh 8 and 9, go down. The Bible says the four beasts and the 24 held us. They sung a new song. &gt;&gt; You are worthy to take the book. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And to Amen. release the seals thereof because you have redeemed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. By thy blood out of every kindred and tongue of nation. Our representation were there. &gt;&gt; We came up under the anointing of the flying eagle. So what you see here is already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already there. &gt;&gt; Our worship is already there. &gt;&gt; Because out of those four beasts came the worship of redemption. Glory to God. And remember, it's not the song and the literal book. Glory to God. Anybody can learn those songs. But it's a redemption anointing that comes upon you. Let you understand the power of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You got a testimony about your redemption. So that's the redemption that took place on Calvary. Hallelujah. the general redemption of the world. Christ died and shed his blood. But Jesus said to his disciples, he said, "When you see these things, look up for your redemption." &gt;&gt; Your redemption. The prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hear what he said. Can I read this to you? &gt;&gt; He said, "Notice here. Oh, glory to God. The church has got to have rapturing faith before the church can have a rapture. &gt;&gt; We can't even have faith for divine healing. &gt;&gt; Let alone rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; he said we got to have faith. We have to have faith that will change and quicken this body. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So your redemption is to quicken this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; So think about it. You we are we can we can't even have faith for divine healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Much more &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. He said we got to have faith that will change this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for what? Rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To get together for rapturing faith. You got to pull yourself together. &gt;&gt; Because when you observe the season, &gt;&gt; it's not a season for picnic. &gt;&gt; It's not a season to play church. &gt;&gt; It's a season to look and understand that hey, this need to change. &gt;&gt; This need to change. remember. Oh, glory to God. He said, and you know the prophet, he preached this in the first seal in 1963. He said, "What we have now 1963 would not be able to have rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; We got to go further." &gt;&gt; We have to go further. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; When the prophet says, "You are an Adam before he fell." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He said, "We're going to experience the same power and anointing that Adam had before he fell." &gt;&gt; So, we got to go beyond just a church. This is more than that. We got to go back into the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Far beyond the books. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Adam never had this. &gt;&gt; He don't never had this. &gt;&gt; Helen never had this. But how did they reach that faith? They came in a personal communication with God. &gt;&gt; Enoch walked with God. He had a personal connection with God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hey, these are the days if you don't read it, a person don't believe it. &gt;&gt; If you don't read it, they don't believe it. Why? They become a paper religion. &gt;&gt; They missed the season. Within the same age, brother John was on the high of Patmas. Are we there with this? &gt;&gt; And then God said, "John, Amen, write." Did he say that in the for the church ages? He said, "Write these things and send it to the seven messengers, the seven ages." So that was a season of paper, right? &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 4. God said, "Come up hither and I'm going to show you things." Oh, this in the same haze the season changed. It was no more writing but pay attention. &gt;&gt; So don't write. I want you to look. Oh glory to God. Then the season change in Revelation chapter 10. Oh when he when Christ descend in the cloud. Revelation 10:1. That's where you see him. Do you understand him? He descend in the cloud. Glory to God. And when he opened his mouth and roar like a lion, she sever thunders uttered their voices. John was about to write. What the voice said, "Don't write, John. You're not going back to that season. The season of writing is over." He said, "John, don't write." Hallelujah. Thank God. It was the same time the seventh messenger was there. He revealed who that one came down on the cloud was. Behold your bridegroom. Go and meet him. It's time for an invisible union. Two cannot walk unless they agree. &gt;&gt; You have to be united with Christ. &gt;&gt; The book says, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Which is another attribute of God in the cell God being revealed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The Christ on earth is the church supposed to be the church. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did he said to John? Look at the last season of John's vision. He said John go and take the book. The word go mean leave your present position move. Take the book. Is that right? Take a hold of it. He never said right. He never said look. He said now to heat. &gt;&gt; Consume the book. Consume it. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Because you are going to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; You cannot prophesy unless you eat. Remember, you become what you eat. Is that right? &gt;&gt; You become what you eat. So the more you eat the word, oh, the more you eat that word, you're becoming that word. &gt;&gt; And when you, you know what? When you're becoming that word, who are you? You're Christ. Jesus said, I am the word. I am the life. I am the light. What did he says? In the beginning was that word. And that same word became flesh. That same word again has been resurrected in a body called the bride, the church, the wife of Christ, whatever you put it. She has to manifest the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She has to stand upon this earth and speak it, prophesy it and said, "I am the resurrection for there to be a resurrection." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Look at Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones. &gt;&gt; Right. God, the almighty God says, "Son of man, can these bones live?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God could have just easily do his own thing. &gt;&gt; But he put the man, the son of man, this is your duty. &gt;&gt; Son of man, can these bones live? What did Ezekiel says? Ezekiel was a prophet, but God called him son of man. &gt;&gt; He was a representation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; On earth. Oh, God. He's all right. &gt;&gt; Came these Muslim. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Don't knowish." God said, "Okay, you prophesy. You You do the speaking. &gt;&gt; Prophecy. You speak for this resurrection to take place." Glory to God. Son of man, prophesy again. That's why he said, "John, eat the book because you're going to prophesy again." &gt;&gt; Amen. The dead saints has to rise first. And for them to rise, it's going to take a living being representing God upon earth. Elijah was alive when the baby was risen. Elisha was alive when the baby was risen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus came and demonstrated that he raised the dead in his season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Oh, glory to God. Evening. Let us put it right now in the in the ministry of the prophet. He was alive and we see many dead raised. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Then how in this age we think we are ready to go home? We got to bring those dead saints right here before we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother. &gt;&gt; It's going to take the agapa love though &gt;&gt; because a gap of love is a love without condition. &gt;&gt; Right. If I love you because &gt;&gt; it's a love of condition. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And anything that I've condition I have expectation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't meet the expect if you don't meet my condition, what I expect, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It can bring division. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will not be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; A gap of love is beyond that. It's the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the love of God that's going to bring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Right. And I tell the saints, it says, "If it was up to me, my mom gone on to be with the Lord, my father gone on to be with the Lord, my mother-in-law gone on to be with the Lord, if it was in my power, I love my mother so much for the resurrection, I bring her up first." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Cuz you will bring up who you know, &gt;&gt; right? Yes. &gt;&gt; But at that time, God don't need you to know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He doesn't need your knowledge. It doesn't need who you love first. &gt;&gt; It's going to take the presence of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to take God to bring up the dead, those that are sleeping in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That those that are sleeping in Christ will come first. That's why Apostle Paul said, "Behold, I show you a mystery. &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall all be now that change comes through the rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; So we talk about the rapture. Let us not talk about the rapture. It's not an event. It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's a ministry that will be coming out. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Coming out of the life of people that see and understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The son of man came. Notice the first time you see the rainbow in Revelation is Revelation chapter 4. John said, "I saw one sitting on the throne." One, not 2, 3, 4, 5. One, and around the throne was a rainbow. The rainbow is a sign of life, &gt;&gt; a covenant of life, &gt;&gt; between God and earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That is why as long as we are here, the covenant of life remains. For God so love the world. &gt;&gt; He loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Glory to God. But the next time John saw the rainbow was when this son of man that Jesus told them, they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud. Revelation 14 says, "You saw the son of man coming on a cloud, but this time in a cloud, clothed in a cloud, and the rainbow was around his head." &gt;&gt; He came personally. That was the appearance of Christ to bring to you the understanding. It is now a relationship between you and Christ. And they too has now become one. You are now one with Christ. All the attributes that was in Christ is now into you and I. For what purpose? When Jesus said, "I am the bread," he man, he proved it. He Oh, glory. When he said he was the light of the world, he proved it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he he said, "I am the way," he manifested it. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the truth," he manifested it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I am the resurrection. He manifested it. &gt;&gt; What about us? Whatever we say, we got to manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever we preach, we got to manifest that. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Whatever we stand and we preach and we testify, we will have to manifest it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am the way. That's why I said people, where is the light of the world? It's not up there. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Where is the light of the world? Jesus said the book of the book of John said he was the light of the world and the life was a light of men. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Jesus himself before he left. When you read when you when you read St. Matthew chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Pay attention to the pronouns in there. Some statement Jesus generalized. When Jesus said, "Blessed are they, &gt;&gt; right? Blessed are they." General, &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "Blessed are the poor." That's general. &gt;&gt; Anybody? But when Jesus says, "You are the light of the world." &gt;&gt; He was being direct. You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Then he says you are the salt of the earth. He never say anybody is. He say you are the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So where is the light of the world? He's here. Glory to God. You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; So you can't go outside looking up and say, "Oh Jesus, you're the light." You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He transferred that light to you. Your responsibility is to shine before all men &gt;&gt; that they will see your good works. &gt;&gt; Now we begin to glorify the father which is in heaven because the eternal father is a spirit. But you are his representation here. You are who God says that the world is looking at to manifest what the word says. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What the word says. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So what season we're in? We're in a season that Jesus says when you see that fig tree put forth its birth &gt;&gt; and all trees &gt;&gt; Israel springing all trees the other nations &gt;&gt; begin to rise he says notice summer is near why people misunderstand our action our behavior when you read the book of Amos chapter 8 from verse 11 when God talk about uh this famine is going to be in the land and all of that. You remember when he talk in Joel that there's going to be a time of restoration. &gt;&gt; He says in the first month God said I'm sending the rain. The first month God gave Israel &gt;&gt; when they were coming out of Egypt the month of Abib as the first month which is not January &gt;&gt; but it's in spring. Is that right? &gt;&gt; April. Thank you very much. April, which is spring to them. Now, if God says what was expected, he says the floor is going to be full. The vat's going to overflow him. God says it's a season of restoration. What did what did he say? Eat in plenty &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. That's spring. &gt;&gt; Eat in plenty and be satisfied. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if God says what you see happening around, I want you to notice that the next season is going to be summer. So if the next season is summer, you are in spring, what's you what did God say we ought to do now? He said eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. Because some is going to be hot. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; Our responsibility. What is be it behold us in this season when you see all them war going on? Not to get panic. &gt;&gt; Not to get panicked &gt;&gt; but keep focused. Amen. &gt;&gt; Retain our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Retain our confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; Keep eating in plenty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Know that you are carrying the agapa love. &gt;&gt; About to transform. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's what he says. &gt;&gt; The season that we're in is not a season for panic. For the children of God, you can't panic. &gt;&gt; Why would you panic if God said to you, "Go down. go down the road, you see a red car and you go and see the red car, you're frightened. Why would you frighten? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you never understood them or you weren't listening. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But now that you understand the word, that's why I said when you see this man, when you understand the appearing, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of the angel of the covenant in your season, &gt;&gt; he said when you understand that, he says summer is near. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you understand that, he says summer is near. It behooves us. So I wonder how people don't have that desire for fellowship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; People losing the appetite for the word of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; People losing that that connection of love with one another. people losing that and it becomes such a ritual sometime the meeting and the gatherings and you know I tell you know excuse if I say that sometime these big meetings and these big convention is nothing but a show &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and sometime the weak get trampled &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; a big spiritual stampede &gt;&gt; because the weaker ones get trampled and the big ones are glorified &gt;&gt; how many leaves sometimes filled with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; how many leaves sometimes times. Amen. Uhhuh. Being healed. &gt;&gt; How many &gt;&gt; have been to great meetings and the young people left without the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Nobody. There is no revival. It's a show, a spiritual stampede. The weak get trampled and this Amen. And the strong are glorified. &gt;&gt; That's not the purpose. No, &gt;&gt; we need to see young people or old people, anybody receiving the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You want to see another Pentecost again. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. People dancing and skipping under the anointing and the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's more than just preaching and reciting a few words. &gt;&gt; We desire that this is the season, saints of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what can trigger somebody or lift people faith. Brother Dale &gt;&gt; when people start to see things happening. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Let people start to see the signs and wonders that supposed to follow the believers following them. &gt;&gt; People faith just start to lift now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Their confidence start to rise again. &gt;&gt; This the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's the truth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Here's the truth. &gt;&gt; A man not going to be attracted because, oh, he dress nice. Look at his tie. Oh, he's a real Christian. &gt;&gt; That season is pass. &gt;&gt; That's not a season. &gt;&gt; He's a real Christian. Listen how we preach. &gt;&gt; Oh, look at how he dress. Oh, there goes the son of God. That season is pass. &gt;&gt; People are looking for Christ. &gt;&gt; People are looking for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do you think so many people out there in the world are being tricked? &gt;&gt; Because they're looking for Christ. &gt;&gt; They're being tricked. &gt;&gt; They're being tricked. &gt;&gt; They're being deceived. That's why the word say if it was possible, even the very elect deceived, &gt;&gt; but it's not possible. &gt;&gt; Why? Because only a few is going to catch the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's Not who God is, not who Christ is, of the season. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the season is important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Let's just pray. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Father, in the name of Jesus, just a few words you could say today, Lord. Oh God, reminding us, heavenly father, of the season that we're in. Christ Jesus tool us these things. &gt;&gt; Not for us to be frightened Lord, &gt;&gt; but for us God to to to lift our hopes and Lord regain our confidence Lord &gt;&gt; to look into the word to understand what you are doing in this last day. You says these things Lord is just the beginning of sorrow. But in the midst of the sorrow, Lord, there is joy. There is happiness. There is confidence. There's a revival taking place in the heart of your people individually because our redemption is near. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Lord, we're looking for the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're under the anointing of the last day. And this anointing is not bringing about a psychological depression. We're not depressed, oh God. But we're under expectation for a body change. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are under expectation, Lord, to see your work manifest through our lives, Lord Jesus. You went further and you said when they see these things, they know that the kingdom of God is near. Now they know that the kingdom of God is at hand. Thank you, Lord. That season when men's heart failing for fear is the season when you said we ought to seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness. &gt;&gt; That's first God's kingdom and his righteousness first. where our desire is, what is upon our heart in this season, Lord, as the Holy Spirit asks, what is it that we put on the forefront of our minds? &gt;&gt; Are we under expectation for the resurrection of the saints that are sleeping? Are we possessing that agapa love, Lord, to see our brothers and sisters again? Oh God, Lord, to see God. People dancing in the spirit, Lord. People living again for God, Lord. And oh, people receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit, Lord, how we in that atmosphere. Oh God. Lord, I pray today, Lord, as we hear the word and get back to the scriptures as a prophet point us, may we look into this very word that you gave us to understand the season that we're living in and what is expected of us in this season. Lord, how many walking with Joshua, Lord, and a a different generation that you rose up to follow Joshua into their adoption because those under Moses, Lord, they they would not have even accepted Joshua's leadership, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Different method and they Oh, God. But you rose up another generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Lord that will understand that you are not changing. You are bringing them further and further to the promise. May we not just sing that we feel the pull Lord because it's written in a book but may we testify tonight that I feel that pull. I feel that call. Oh, that theophony. Oh, God. As the prophet said, there's a promised body. There's a promised resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. That ising in our souls tonight, I believe that from my heart, Lord, any time now, &gt;&gt; we we shall be seeing our brothers and sisters appearing and appear. The prophet said they will appear to us for a few days. Oh God, that will climax our faith so much. What will be left? What will leave is just our body change. Glory. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Glory.

We are the true weakness. Hallelujah. Of the resurrected Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But we are the remnant upon this earth that only a few will recognize when they see the son of man come in the cloud to understand his coming and the purpose of his coming is an invisible union with his bride. Thank you Jesus. Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; My soul Bless you, pastor. [Music] &gt;&gt; I hear the call [Music] and I know his me. Pres me to give my peace to me. [Music] Hallelujah.

Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. You know, as brother Osman was ministering, I thought of the story in the Bible when they came to Jesus and he was on earth and they said, "We would that you would show us the Father." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to him, he said, "I've been with you &gt;&gt; all this time, and you don't know me &gt;&gt; and you didn't see the Father. I've been living my whole life. And our neighbors come and they say, "Could you lead me to Jesus, but you are Jesus on earth? &gt;&gt; You are the representation of Jesus Christ on earth." Amen. If the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Paul said, "It's Christ in me. It's no longer I that liveth, but Christ, the anointed one, God. It's no longer I'm living. It's not hell. Christ the anointed one in me. Wow, man. If we could just when we get to that maturity where where everything we do, we just represent Christ and then the outside world just say, "Wow." So there he goes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus could say, "When you've seen me, you've seen the father." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz they were one. Amen. for us to go in the rapture. We'll be one just like a marriage union. We'll be one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amazing. Amen. God help me. God help me. Let's sing. I bless my name. I bless your name. I bless you. We start with a start with a course in prison chains. In prison chains [Applause] with bleeding stripes both fall inside [Music] and in their way to sing. [Music] Hallelujah. And they were free. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you all. I give you praise. You are alive. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. I bless your name. I bless your name. Some me. [Music] Thank you Lord. [Music] Thank you Jesus. [Music] Amen. In Jesus name I bless your name. I bless your name. I am I [Music] bless your name. I bless your name. Let's sing the chorus one more time. I bless your name. Yeah. Heat. [Music] I praise your name. I praise your name. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word, Lord God. Lord, I pray that we'll all just grow into this statue of this perfect man that you had foreseen in in us, Lord God. And may we be like the disciples when they were healing the sick outside the tabernacle in the Bible. And Peter, they're going along to heal. And Peter said, "Look on us." Because Peter had received you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord God, we sure love you, Jesus. We love you and we praise you. We give you the glory and honor. Thank you, Lord God, for coming inside of us and taking complete control. &gt;&gt; Lord, we surrender our will. We surrender our life. We surrender everything. We surrender our thoughts. surrender everything to you. The leading of the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; what you want us to do, &gt;&gt; we'll do. Jesus, we love you with all of our hearts. Bless our fellowship after and and just bring us together again on Sunday to hear what you have for us, Lord Jesus. We pray. Amen. Hey. Hey. Hey.
