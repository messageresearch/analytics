[23:23] Amen. It's good to be in church this
[23:25] morning. Amen.
[23:27] God bless you and
[23:30] we're just thrilled to see you and have
[23:32] fellowship together. And
[23:35] Amen.
[23:35] God is very good.
[23:49] A couple testimonies.
[23:52] Uh,
[23:56] guess I would start that. Uh, I didn't
[23:58] do it.
[24:00] I promise I didn't do it. Whatever I
[24:03] did, I didn't do it.
[24:06] Amen. Uh,
[24:09] we went to uh, Missaga yesterday
[24:14] and uh, it was well worth the drive.
[24:19] The brother preached a message
[24:23] that was probably the most powerful
[24:25] message I've ever heard in my life.
[24:30] And I've definitely never heard one
[24:32] preached even close to it. Not even
[24:35] close.
[24:39] And I would hugely recommend
[24:42] every family to go on and listen to
[24:44] Grace and Truth Tabernacle Message
[24:46] Church. You have to have the message in
[24:48] there. Grace and truth message
[24:50] tabernacle.
[24:51] I watch the videos. They start
[24:53] Wednesday, two on Saturday. And he's
[24:56] preaching on headship this morning.
[25:00] But he preached on something that has
[25:02] affected the whole church.
[25:05] And he said his generation, he's about
[25:07] my age. He said he was the first
[25:09] generation that was raised up in the
[25:11] message. And he said almost 100% of
[25:14] those people left the message
[25:18] because their parents were putting laws
[25:21] on the kids that weren't message
[25:25] and weren't Bible.
[25:27] They were their old carryovers of what
[25:29] they thought it took to be a good
[25:30] person.
[25:33] And so for the people to be humans,
[25:35] their kids left the truth.
[25:40] You know what he preached on?
[25:43] Sex.
[25:46] Just good old plain
[25:49] sex.
[25:54] He said God made us sexual people.
[25:57] And he said, "It don't matter if you get
[25:59] 100,000% of the Holy Ghost, you're still
[26:02] affected
[26:05] by sex."
[26:07] And your God-given desire
[26:11] about sex was to produce Holy Ghost,
[26:16] sons of God, and daughters of God by a
[26:19] couple. That's right.
[26:21] And he mentioned on things like he said,
[26:22] "That's fine if society has changed to
[26:25] bring us to college and university and
[26:27] get a big career and a big job, but what
[26:30] are you going to do? What God planned
[26:31] for you?
[26:33] God planned on you to bring forth sons
[26:35] and daughters of God. Sex
[26:39] by sex.
[26:44] and our kids in that generation left and
[26:47] married unbelievers because
[26:51] he told a story. It's on the video. He
[26:54] said, "We married a couple. They went on
[26:56] their honeymoon and they come back from
[26:58] their honeymoon and they had never
[27:00] consummated the marriage,
[27:02] but their second night or second or
[27:04] third night, they were laying in their
[27:05] bed together and they were praying. And
[27:07] he said, "Please forgive us, God,
[27:09] because we're going to partake of the
[27:10] sin of the tree of the life, the Garden
[27:12] of Eden."
[27:17] But God said the bad in marriage is
[27:19] undefiable,
[27:22] and it was supposed to be a pleasure
[27:26] in the right atmosphere.
[27:28] That's just facts. That's right.
[27:30] He said, "If you think your ministers
[27:31] aren't affected by this sex or a sexual
[27:34] desire, you are so deceived you're not
[27:36] even alive."
[27:38] Cuz if you're a human,
[27:41] you're an animal.
[27:45] [Music]
[27:47] And he said, "If you got a plan to get a
[27:51] career, then what's your plan
[27:55] about your sexual desire?"
[27:57] He said, "I'll tell you what it is.
[27:58] You'll cheat
[28:00] and then you'll be you'll deal with the
[28:03] guilt the rest of your life. And it's
[28:05] because you didn't obey God's plan
[28:08] to get married young.
[28:11] Wow. He actually said that at John
[28:13] Dingler's church. I almost fell over.
[28:20] Yep.
[28:21] Get married young. Then you don't have
[28:23] regrets.
[28:24] You don't make mistakes.
[28:26] And for all of us that he he dealt with
[28:28] for all of us that don't think that you
[28:30] know he said our grandparents could
[28:31] never talk about sex or breast or
[28:34] anything like that cuz it was just like
[28:37] swearing.
[28:39] He said your kids have seen that on
[28:41] their phone that they have
[28:43] or if you were terrible enough to send
[28:45] them to school they probably seen that
[28:47] in grade one.
[28:49] God bless the mothers that homeschool.
[28:52] And if you don't homeschool, send them
[28:53] to a Christian school at least.
[28:56] At least.
[28:58] And don't buy them a phone.
[29:00] Give them their phone for their wedding
[29:02] present with internet
[29:05] at 16.
[29:08] I'm serious.
[29:10] Give them their phone for their wedding
[29:11] present at 16 with internet on it.
[29:15] Because he he said I'm repeating if you
[29:18] listen to Charity Morning's video.
[29:23] He said the way it was supposed to be
[29:25] was you were not supposed to know
[29:26] nothing about it and come together
[29:28] and your experiences would be what God
[29:30] wanted it to be.
[29:31] But we have a thing called Hollywood,
[29:34] internet and phones and it's deceived
[29:37] and corrupted the world.
[29:39] I'm going to give you a survey and I'm
[29:41] going to change the subject. He said 90%
[29:43] of message kids
[29:45] do sex or pornography before they get
[29:47] married. And over 60% of message girls,
[29:50] he said, "That's my own survey from all
[29:52] the youth camps I preach around the
[29:54] world."
[29:55] So, you can tell your kids not to marry,
[29:57] but they're going to do it anyway.
[30:00] Anyway,
[30:02] he also said something else that'll just
[30:04] shock you parents. You're just going to
[30:06] fall right off your pew. Said it's on
[30:08] scriptural
[30:10] and on message to chaperone.
[30:19] Thank you, Amy. Got one. Amen.
[30:22] You know, the prophet dated Hope and he
[30:24] drove her to church alone.
[30:27] And when he proposed to her, he left the
[30:31] car and walked her to church and home in
[30:35] the dark.
[30:39] Imagine
[30:46] See, carryovers. We have ideas.
[30:49] We had ideas, but they're not
[30:51] necessarily God's ideas.
[30:53] That's right.
[30:55] Amen. Wow.
[30:57] So, it was very unique.
[31:00] You know, I want I want to just close
[31:02] with this. I'm I'm trying to spur your
[31:03] interest to watch the video. He said,
[31:05] you know, the greatest messenger in the
[31:06] Bible
[31:08] was Paul.
[31:10] Paul brought grace.
[31:13] He wrote half the Bible.
[31:15] And the best conclusion he could give
[31:17] you for your own body was get married
[31:21] and not withhold yourself.
[31:23] Said your body is not your own.
[31:26] Your body's not your own. You give
[31:27] yourself uncompletely, unsurrenly to.
[31:30] And he said, now he was passing out the
[31:32] Holy Ghost.
[31:34] This is the preacher that passed out the
[31:36] Holy Ghost.
[31:38] But in Corinthians, whatever it is,
[31:40] Corinthians, 1 Corinthians about 7, I
[31:42] think it is, or 13.
[31:46] He goes right into that.
[31:50] Wow.
[31:51] Wow.
[31:52] Amen. We done another testimony. We
[31:54] thank God for keeping Brother Jeff safe.
[31:56] He was just remember him in his prayer.
[31:59] He was rear ended by a semi the bridge
[32:02] and uh it wasn't all pretty for himself
[32:06] and and uh so we just remember Jeff and
[32:11] the family's just hurting. His body's
[32:13] hurting. Amen. And and but God knows
[32:16] what he's doing. Amen.
[32:17] God totally knows what he's doing. Also,
[32:19] when we come home, we had a wonderful
[32:21] time. We we actually Junior had to work.
[32:23] So, we met brother Jim at West Lauren.
[32:25] We go out West Lawrence. It's not much
[32:26] different for us. And we we met brother
[32:28] Jim there multiple times. We rode
[32:30] together with to John Denquist.
[32:34] And so we come back and we dropped him
[32:36] off. We had a wonderful time. Blessed.
[32:38] We were back early. It's 5:00 daylight.
[32:41] You know, the world's good. God's good.
[32:43] We jump on the road. I'm doing about 110
[32:46] kilometers. I'm back in my home turf.
[32:48] You know, like statistics say, when you
[32:50] get close to home, Brother Lawrence, you
[32:52] know, I was seeing combines again. So, I
[32:54] felt quite human. I was away from the
[32:56] concrete skyscrapers and uh everybody's
[33:00] combine wheat and we met a a wheat truck
[33:05] and we passed it and the moment we were
[33:09] passing it there was a little tiny bug
[33:11] car behind it. You could not see at all
[33:14] and it pulled right out across for us
[33:17] and Lanne I think was looking at me. She
[33:20] just about put her head through the
[33:21] windowshield. Everything that we had on,
[33:24] anything went flying to the front and
[33:26] the woman put her hands over her head.
[33:31] I pretty much laid on the
[33:35] and a moment after that I thought, "Wow,
[33:39] you know, we could have been in heaven
[33:40] right now.
[33:43] That would have been pretty awesome
[33:44] going together." My only condition was
[33:47] it wouldn't hurt too much. Like I just
[33:49] was out, you know. I didn't want to
[33:52] suffer, you know. Forget the hospital
[33:53] thing. Just hit me on the head before
[33:56] you take me there.
[33:58] But you see, God knows. Amen. I might
[34:01] not have been here this morning. And the
[34:03] reality of that is pretty great.
[34:06] Literally, brother Dale might have been
[34:09] in heaven. And you went ahead to share
[34:12] no tears for me because this boy would
[34:13] have been heaven. Hallelujah.
[34:15] Pentecostal shutting last I would have
[34:17] been learning how to dance in a new way.
[34:21] Especially going with my honey. Amen. So
[34:24] God God knows. Of course when I said
[34:27] that Lanne said, "Well, God must have
[34:30] something for you to do."
[34:33] So we're still here.
[34:35] Amen. God's just not quite done with
[34:37] this yet. Amen. So amen. Let's stand and
[34:40] and turn to Isaiah 60 verse one.
[34:44] Man.
[34:46] Oh, somebody took my water.
[34:50] Maybe I didn't bring it. I need a glass
[34:53] of water, please.
[34:56] I'll go dry.
[34:59] Sorry. Oh, no. No, that's not it. You
[35:01] can leave it there. Thanks.
[35:03] Isaiah 60 verse one.
[35:07] Amen. Arise and shine, for thy light has
[35:12] come.
[35:13] Make it personal. Thy light has come.
[35:16] And the glory of the Lord is risen
[35:21] upon thee. That sounds like blessings to
[35:24] me. For behold, the darkness shall cover
[35:27] the earth, and gross darkness all the
[35:30] people, but the Lord shall rise upon
[35:35] thee,
[35:37] and his glory shall be, you can't hide
[35:40] it, seen.
[35:43] upon thee, Lord Jesus. Lord, I I pray
[35:46] you'll just help me to in my poor way,
[35:50] just help me to portray to the people
[35:53] this verse, how it jumped off the
[35:55] scriptures and how you gave me some
[35:57] thoughts, Lord God, for today and and
[35:59] bless your bride in a supernatural way.
[36:02] Help them to recognize your plan, Lord
[36:04] Jesus. We pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[36:08] brother. Thank you very much. God bless
[36:09] you. You may have your seats. Thank you,
[36:11] brother.
[36:15] We see here in this scripture, arise and
[36:18] shine. God don't want us to be beat down
[36:20] Christians. We should be the happiest
[36:23] people there is. You know, brother Bram
[36:25] said this. He said, "If God would have
[36:27] came to me and asked me, in which
[36:29] generation, in which church age would
[36:32] you like to have been born?" I would
[36:34] have picked this age. This time would
[36:37] have been the very best number one age
[36:40] to live in the greatest age. We should
[36:42] be the happiest people in the world. And
[36:45] God has gave his glory
[36:48] to rise on you.
[36:50] That's right.
[36:51] And this glory is it God portrayed it
[36:54] this way because he had the light shines
[36:57] the best in darkness. And you know, in
[37:00] the broad daylight when you're driving
[37:02] down the road, if you turn your
[37:03] headlights on, you don't know they're
[37:04] on. You don't know they're on unless
[37:06] there's a light inside where it's a
[37:08] little bit darker on your dash that
[37:10] tells you they're on.
[37:12] But in darkness of this world, in this
[37:15] end times world where it's completely
[37:17] insane,
[37:20] darkness has covered the whole earth and
[37:22] gross darkness has definitely covered
[37:25] the people and politics and the world.
[37:28] The Lord said that ye shall rise.
[37:31] Oh, this boy's going to rise
[37:34] and his glory is going to be seen on
[37:37] thee. That's right.
[37:38] Amen. What an amazing thing. What a what
[37:41] the things, you know, we we sang that
[37:42] song, give thanks by no mistake
[37:47] because we should be the most grateful,
[37:49] happy people in the world. You know,
[37:52] since God started this church, and it'll
[37:54] soon be 12 years, I've never done a
[37:57] funeral yet.
[38:00] That's amazing.
[38:01] That's right.
[38:02] Any of you drive?
[38:04] Does any flying airplanes?
[38:06] Never done a funeral.
[38:08] Any of you had any kids that were born
[38:10] with one arm or no eyes,
[38:14] an ear,
[38:16] a very birth sickness, still born?
[38:23] You decide that was your good behavior.
[38:25] No, you should be the happiest people.
[38:27] How many of you would have loved to went
[38:29] to the SA hospital today to visit me if
[38:33] I had hit that car? How many of you
[38:35] would have loved to been in the
[38:36] hospital?
[38:41] You're in the best place you can be
[38:44] because of brother Lawrence, sister
[38:45] Shilly, we got padded seats. Amen.
[38:49] Think of all the places you could be.
[38:52] Yes, that's right.
[38:54] You want to be in a country where
[38:55] there's a dirt floor and they got a b a
[38:58] tree limb to sit on which which uh you
[39:01] know if you were skinny like me it would
[39:03] you know not be uncomfortable.
[39:07] Amen. An amazing thing that you have
[39:09] privilege that you have
[39:12] to be here today
[39:14] and serve God.
[39:17] Amen. That privilege is given to you
[39:19] because of prophecy.
[39:22] It's because of prophecy. Isaiah 60
[39:25] verse one that I can see and I can
[39:27] understand all these mysteries
[39:30] of the Bible. I can understand that it's
[39:33] God's goodness. Amen. Uh maybe Sister
[39:38] Patricia, take them to the side aisle if
[39:41] you don't mind. Curtis, you need to go
[39:43] to the side. Amen. It's because of God's
[39:46] goodness and grace to us
[39:48] that we have all these good things that
[39:51] God's done for us.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:54] Amen.
[39:55] Think of all the people that don't have
[39:58] a clue what the truth is of the seventh
[40:00] seal.
[40:02] They don't know that the first horse for
[40:05] four horse riders was Satan imitating
[40:08] God. They they don't have a clue about
[40:11] that.
[40:12] Amen. Amen.
[40:15] But you do. And you know that that God
[40:18] when Satan comes in like a flood, he
[40:19] raised up the four beasts.
[40:23] That would counteract those horses.
[40:25] Yes.
[40:25] Think of all the people that are sitting
[40:27] in churches today that don't know the
[40:29] interpretation of that word.
[40:32] That's right. I
[40:32] I want to just drop something in here
[40:34] and this just come to me. That's why I'm
[40:36] dropping it in. Is our camp is two weeks
[40:39] from today. Two weeks from today, we
[40:42] won't be here. will be at camp
[40:46] and it's looking like it could be
[40:50] there could be more non-ssage people
[40:52] there than message people
[40:55] because see you know even the foolish
[40:56] version
[40:58] hungers and thirsts
[41:00] sometimes stronger than the real
[41:04] but the Bible says when you see the
[41:06] foolish virgin going for the oil
[41:09] help me out hey we had dinner with
[41:11] Pentecostals that we've known for 30
[41:13] years. They took two posters of camp.
[41:16] Not one person in this church has asked
[41:18] me for a poster. They took two. They
[41:20] gave it to their Pentecostal church.
[41:22] He's planning on the whole church
[41:24] coming.
[41:26] Amen. From Strath Roy. Amen. And that
[41:29] ain't all going brothers coming in the
[41:31] flesh and and her si and his
[41:33] sister-in-law and different ones. Amen.
[41:35] Now, God knows what he's doing.
[41:38] But God, it's God's work and it's God's
[41:40] kingdom. And for sure we don't need, you
[41:43] know, there's going to be people there
[41:44] that don't know the revelation, you
[41:46] know, and they don't look like you. And
[41:48] God's not going to use you to correct
[41:51] them.
[41:52] He will not use you.
[41:55] He will use the five-fold ministry.
[41:58] Leave it in God's hands.
[42:01] Amen.
[42:02] We don't need anybody at camp preaching
[42:06] that ain't invited to preach.
[42:10] Amen. Amen.
[42:12] Because God has a time and a season for
[42:14] everything.
[42:16] Some of those people will never come to
[42:19] the revelation that you have.
[42:24] Amen.
[42:26] How many people don't know the privilege
[42:28] that you know about predestination and
[42:30] not by disgrace but by amazing grace?
[42:34] Predestination and election. Arise and
[42:38] shine. Amen.
[42:39] God's you and arise and shine
[42:42] for his glory
[42:44] is upon you.
[42:45] Amen. How many people don't know that
[42:47] this the lamb's book of life that your
[42:50] name was wrote on it
[42:51] before the foundation of the world
[42:54] a privileged people we are. You know
[42:57] what that is? That's God's glory that
[43:00] he's saying that you're going to rise
[43:02] and shine
[43:03] and it'll be manifested when darkness
[43:06] comes on the earth. Yes.
[43:08] When gross when gross darkness
[43:12] comes upon the people.
[43:16] Amen.
[43:18] How many people have no clue about the
[43:21] truth of the Godhead?
[43:23] Yeah. and they got them as three people
[43:26] or two people
[43:28] and and Jesus has to get permission from
[43:30] God and and all these things or they got
[43:34] them as oneness where the body and all
[43:36] these things they have no revelation
[43:40] what a prophet came and showed us that
[43:42] God is a spirit
[43:45] and he has multiple manifestations
[43:48] you know Keith Reed's church I seen a
[43:50] post on on the internet and a lady
[43:52] sister was singing of all the things
[43:54] that God was.
[43:56] God was in the pillar of fire. God was
[43:58] in the cloud. God was in the water. God
[44:00] was God was in everything
[44:04] because God's a spirit and God's in you
[44:07] and God's in me
[44:10] the oneness of God. The deity of God as
[44:15] one person, a spirit,
[44:18] the deity of God.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:23] You know the millions of people that
[44:25] don't know that
[44:29] millions of people
[44:31] they have no clue through this. You know
[44:33] those people that we were talking about?
[44:34] We went to their house and and we were
[44:37] able to witness just a little bit to
[44:39] them about three months ago, just a bit.
[44:42] And I was telling them about, you know,
[44:44] they were saying, I said, "We're not
[44:46] going to have major revival in the world
[44:49] because it's prophesied that the world's
[44:51] going to fall apart."
[44:53] And and we were talking about how it'll
[44:54] be an individual revival. And we got
[44:56] talking about the millennium.
[44:59] And you know what they told us when they
[45:00] come back three months later?
[45:03] who was actually his wife. She said, "I
[45:05] know a lot more about the Bible than I
[45:07] did three months ago because of your
[45:08] visit."
[45:11] Amen.
[45:16] Amen.
[45:17] How many people have no clue about the
[45:19] truth about water baptism and the power
[45:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[45:25] And there's no power in a father or in a
[45:28] son or a title or these. You can't sign
[45:30] a check in a title.
[45:32] Can you imagine me signing a check for
[45:34] some kind of farm expense? The son the
[45:37] son of of the son.
[45:42] The son of the father.
[45:47] Amen.
[45:48] This ain't by coincidence.
[45:50] This ain't by your doing.
[45:53] It's by God's doing.
[45:55] It's by God's glory shining on your
[45:58] life. And it's coming this hour and this
[46:02] time.
[46:04] Amen.
[46:07] You know, almost nobody in the world
[46:08] realizes that the Bible was the
[46:12] absolute.
[46:14] The Bible was the absolute in our
[46:16] prophet's day.
[46:17] The prophet never quoted his message
[46:19] books.
[46:20] He quoted the Bible. Yes,
[46:21] sir.
[46:22] He said without correctly a doubt at
[46:25] all, the Bible was his absolute book.
[46:28] The Bible says that heaven and earth,
[46:30] imagine heaven, I mean, heaven and earth
[46:33] will pass away, but my word
[46:35] will never pass away. In the beginning
[46:37] was the word and he was with the word
[46:39] and he was the word.
[46:45] We're living in a world where people got
[46:46] man's ideas. The brother was talking
[46:48] about that yesterday. Man's ideas,
[46:50] creeds, oh, they're in the message like
[46:52] crazy.
[46:53] He was talking about chaperon and you
[46:56] know dowery for your wife pay where's
[46:59] that the scripture the dery you know I
[47:02] was in Uganda and they were saying that
[47:04] I had message people tell me that the
[47:06] dollar spirit is so bad that message
[47:09] people will steal to pay the dollar
[47:12] steal
[47:14] amazing
[47:17] can you imagine
[47:19] that's not the message
[47:22] Jesus Jesus died on the cross.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:27] People have made it into blaspheme, the
[47:30] word of God. They've left the word.
[47:33] They've made it blaspheme.
[47:35] Amen. Can you imagine the people that
[47:38] don't recognize the truth of the new
[47:41] bears?
[47:43] I'm going to give you another one.
[47:45] Almost nobody recognizes
[47:47] who the beast is.
[47:51] He's hid so perfectly.
[47:57] But he's a fierce being.
[48:01] Nobody understands the mystery of
[48:03] Babylon, the mother of harlots and who
[48:06] they is and who's controlling the world
[48:08] right now.
[48:11] We got talking about that. The one world
[48:13] government. It's coming. It's this is a
[48:15] gross darkness is coming. It's setting
[48:16] up right now. Amen.
[48:20] to be a Freemason. The Freemasons and
[48:22] and the Rockchilds control a lot of the
[48:24] world. And to be a Freemason, you can't
[48:25] be one unless you're a Roman Catholic.
[48:29] Secret societies
[48:31] that'll set up a one world government,
[48:33] take away money and digital. You know,
[48:34] it's already happened yesterday. I bet
[48:36] you all fell asleep when you heard about
[48:38] it. You know, they've already set up the
[48:40] one world government for your health.
[48:44] It went into law yesterday.
[48:47] About 287
[48:49] countries voted in favor for one person
[48:51] decide on all the health that you get,
[48:54] non-elected.
[48:56] You thought you were democracy. You
[48:58] thought this was a good country. We let
[49:00] somebody in another part of the world
[49:02] decide what they can give us and can't
[49:04] give us and lock us down anything
[49:07] controlling your house
[49:09] by choice. It went into law yesterday.
[49:16] The World Health Organization got that
[49:18] kind of power yesterday. But that's a
[49:21] gross darkness where now when I turn my
[49:24] light on, it just nothing can stand in
[49:27] light. That darkness is just piled up,
[49:30] piled up. It's pushed back.
[49:35] Pile back
[49:37] because of God's light, the glory that's
[49:40] coming this day. A rise and shine.
[49:44] You're the happiest people in the world.
[49:46] Can you imagine the peace that God give
[49:48] you by knowing what's going to happen
[49:50] tomorrow by knowing what's going to
[49:52] happen if you hit a car or God calls you
[49:54] home.
[49:56] Can you imagine? You know what's going
[49:57] to happen in the rapture. And exactly in
[50:00] a twinkling of an eye, you'll get a new
[50:02] body. God's not going to lift this heavy
[50:04] old clay off the earth. He could care
[50:05] less about clay. You don't need clay in
[50:08] heaven.
[50:10] It's going to be a brand new theophony
[50:11] body that's overshadowed me. It got
[50:14] pretty close when we got close to that
[50:15] car. I think it right ready to grab me.
[50:20] Amen.
[50:23] Almost nobody in the world would
[50:26] recognize
[50:27] except just a handful the original sin
[50:31] in the garden. Wouldn't understand the
[50:33] plan of the original sin. Have no clue.
[50:35] Have no clue at all. Be total confusion.
[50:38] And you think, "Oh, well,
[50:46] wow."
[50:48] And other people, their ears, because
[50:50] the foolish virgin will go for the oil
[50:53] near the end, their ears are turned to
[50:55] the to the end. Amen. Honey, go sit with
[50:59] Patricia on this side. Amen.
[51:03] Amen. We're so so so blessed.
[51:07] What is it? It's God's time.
[51:10] It's original glory. Arise and shine.
[51:14] For thy light has come, and the glory of
[51:17] the Lord has risen upon thee.
[51:21] For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[51:23] earth, and gross darkness all the
[51:26] people,
[51:28] but the Lord shall rise upon thee, and
[51:31] his glory
[51:34] shall be seen
[51:35] in thee. That has to come to pass.
[51:38] Not only does it have to come to pass,
[51:40] it's coming to pass.
[51:43] Amen.
[51:46] Most of the world, even my own family
[51:48] and the flesh, don't recognize the truth
[51:51] of the Sabbath.
[51:56] And can't identify the truth of God's
[51:58] word. And, you know, they're still stuck
[52:01] under law and and all these things in
[52:03] the Old Testament.
[52:07] But Jesus, even Christ himself, they
[52:09] tried to condemn.
[52:11] Don't you know that you're not supposed
[52:12] to pick corn in the corn of the Sabbath?
[52:15] Like, cuz
[52:19] Jesus said, "Wait a minute. Wait a
[52:21] minute. You're looking at the Sabbath.
[52:24] I'm the Lord of the Sabbath.
[52:27] I'm everything that's a Sabbath. Don't
[52:29] let men judge you on the new moon or the
[52:31] old moon or a holiday or a Christmas day
[52:34] or a Monday or a Tuesday. If we were
[52:37] coming here on the Sabbath, we'd be here
[52:38] on Saturday.
[52:40] This is a resurrection day.
[52:42] We're a day late. We're not just late
[52:43] for church. We're 24 hours late.
[52:46] Cuz the Sabbath started on Saturday.
[52:49] Amen.
[52:51] But see, we're not judged by that.
[52:54] Cuz to the believer, every day is a
[52:56] Sabbath. Amen.
[52:59] Amazing. Can you imagine the people in
[53:02] Revelation 17 and here the first few
[53:05] verses have no clue what the 10 horns
[53:07] mean and the beast was seven heads. But
[53:11] the seven heads was Rome and the hills,
[53:13] the seven hills. And the 10 horns were
[53:16] the 10 kingdoms of the world. Those
[53:18] great people that you vote into power
[53:20] are going to be the ones that force the
[53:22] foolish virgin to worship the beast.
[53:24] That's right.
[53:25] Be careful how much trust you put in
[53:27] politics. The 10 strongest kingdoms in
[53:30] the world will be the army for Rome.
[53:37] Revelation 13, it says the states will
[53:39] force
[53:41] the world
[53:44] to worship the beast,
[53:47] the image.
[53:50] We understand these things. And see, we
[53:53] understand these things because it's
[53:55] God. It was God's prophecy way back in
[53:58] Isaiah
[54:00] that these things would happen.
[54:03] Amen.
[54:04] Amazing
[54:07] how blessed we are. See, you didn't
[54:09] think God was doing nothing.
[54:12] You couldn't see God moving.
[54:15] You need to go on holiday
[54:18] and see all the things that you know
[54:20] that the world don't know
[54:24] and then you would know how much God's
[54:26] moving
[54:28] and his bride.
[54:30] Amen. You're the truth of the world
[54:32] knows. You know, I grew up in the
[54:34] Holiness family and and had no clue
[54:37] about the truth of Christmas and the
[54:39] time and when it was and what it meant
[54:41] or didn't mean and nothing. But I didn't
[54:44] know nothing. I couldn't imagine it
[54:45] being pagan. And
[54:47] yes, Jesus was born. He's born in the
[54:49] springtime like the lambs. He would have
[54:51] froze to death being born in a in
[54:53] December. That's right.
[54:54] And it was all part of the sun god
[54:56] worship. And and it's when the eclipse
[54:59] happens and it's the shortest day of the
[55:00] year. And you know like the wreaths that
[55:03] you put on the outside of your door to
[55:04] make your house look really beautiful.
[55:06] That was sun worshippers that did that
[55:08] because they believed the sun was
[55:11] burning up.
[55:12] Yeah. They believed the sun was burning
[55:14] and they believed the sun would never
[55:16] come back. And so they put a reef on
[55:18] their door and encouraged the sun to
[55:20] relight itself by some magic one of
[55:23] paganism.
[55:27] The world don't know that.
[55:32] You know it.
[55:35] You know it.
[55:36] I want are are we are we thankful?
[55:41] I wonder I wonder if we give thanks
[55:42] because we know that.
[55:45] I wonder if we give thanks because God
[55:46] opened our eyes and showed us, you know,
[55:48] I wonder if we give thanks because God
[55:50] showed us the truth of the seven
[55:52] thunders and that the thunders was the
[55:54] voice of God to the Jews and it was it
[55:57] was to bring the Jews,
[56:05] man. Sorry. It was sorry the thunders
[56:08] weren't to sorry the thunders were the
[56:10] voice of God they were in the seventh
[56:12] seal was the trumpets I'm sorry forgive
[56:14] me that was to the Jews
[56:17] and the trumpets were actually
[56:19] manifested in the sixth seal and they
[56:21] were they were to the Jews and it was
[56:23] telling them of the persecution that was
[56:25] coming and the two prophets of Moses and
[56:28] Elijah
[56:31] you know how many people know that
[56:34] in Wyoming
[56:37] We're probably all sitting right here.
[56:41] Amen.
[56:45] It's God's light.
[56:48] It's God's light that's come. You know,
[56:51] very few people have recognized, you
[56:53] know, I preached on decisions, you know,
[56:55] a few weeks back and and I mentioned
[56:57] that most decisions we make in our life
[56:59] are based out of fear. Yeah.
[57:01] But do you know how few people recognize
[57:04] the spirit of fear?
[57:07] Do you realize that? How many few people
[57:10] recognize how fear controls everything
[57:13] you do?
[57:15] You put your seatelt on because of fear.
[57:17] Whether it's you think you'll crash or
[57:19] you think you'd get a ticket, it's still
[57:21] fear.
[57:23] Amen.
[57:27] Fear. But the Bible said, "God has not
[57:30] given us a spirit of fear,
[57:32] but of love
[57:34] and power
[57:36] and power
[57:39] and power
[57:40] with a sound mind."
[57:44] Amen.
[57:45] Amen.
[57:45] And the only kind of fear that we're
[57:47] supposed to have in the Bible is the
[57:49] word respect.
[57:52] Respect to the Lord is respect to each
[57:53] other.
[57:54] That's right.
[57:55] That was the only That was the only fear
[57:56] that you're allowed to have. So it
[57:58] wouldn't affect one decision you make.
[58:02] Amen.
[58:05] Amazing.
[58:09] Here our prophet says he said God made
[58:12] this promise and we need to get into the
[58:15] rhythm
[58:17] of this what the prophet said in Shalom
[58:20] and 64. By the way, he said you need to
[58:23] get into the rhythm
[58:26] of God's promise
[58:28] from Isaiah. That's the message of that
[58:31] connects it right to that verse.
[58:34] That means you need to be happy
[58:37] and you need to not worry whether you
[58:38] run into a car or whether you get rear
[58:40] ended. You know, you know there's no
[58:43] matter how bad your situation is,
[58:46] there's people much worse off than you.
[58:50] That's right. Amen.
[58:52] We sing a song, you know, there's a roof
[58:54] up above me.
[58:55] I got food on my table and shoes on my
[58:58] feet.
[58:59] That's all God promised you.
[59:02] I got food on my table. I remember a
[59:04] girl singing that in the Philippines.
[59:06] They were poorer than church mice. I
[59:08] baldled my eyes out.
[59:11] I got food on my table, shoes on my
[59:13] feet, and a roof up above me.
[59:16] Maybe a thatch roof.
[59:18] living in bamboo, walking on a bamboo
[59:20] floor, so the air blew underneath of it.
[59:23] We think we're hard done by if we can't
[59:25] drive a nice car, have a nice house, or
[59:27] have air conditioning.
[59:31] The majority of the world won't even
[59:33] dream about that.
[59:36] Won't even dream of that. Do you know
[59:38] about half the world lives on about $300
[59:40] US a year?
[59:44] Not a day,
[59:46] not a week.
[59:48] Not a month,
[59:51] a year,
[59:56] India, I think, is the worst. I think
[59:59] they live on less than that. 300 US
[1:00:03] a year. Try living on 85 cents or 75
[1:00:06] cents a day. You say, "I can't do that."
[1:00:09] But neither can they.
[1:00:11] But they do.
[1:00:13] They can't either. But they do because
[1:00:15] they're forced to.
[1:00:17] You see, God promised you your needs,
[1:00:20] not your desires.
[1:00:22] And see, we got it messes up our, you
[1:00:24] know, there's things that are messing up
[1:00:26] us serving God because we're affected by
[1:00:28] little things
[1:00:30] and it affects our service to God
[1:00:33] like the brother was talking, you know,
[1:00:35] f kids with families, it'll the kids
[1:00:37] will mess up our life or or or you know,
[1:00:40] relationships if the you know, we we
[1:00:42] think and and it's be it's something
[1:00:44] that God ordained,
[1:00:46] right? Yeah,
[1:00:47] we we are actually taking things we are
[1:00:50] letting things take us away from God
[1:00:52] that God planned for us to do.
[1:01:00] Somebody say amen.
[1:01:03] You know, if if if we had a 15year-old
[1:01:06] here with a girlfriend in the church,
[1:01:08] everybody would have something to say
[1:01:10] about that.
[1:01:11] Everybody here would have something to
[1:01:12] say about that. And that's God's plan.
[1:01:15] Yeah,
[1:01:16] that would be God's plan.
[1:01:18] Do you know the prophet married a young
[1:01:20] couple and he never once asked them if
[1:01:22] they could support one another.
[1:01:24] He never even asked him if they had any
[1:01:25] money.
[1:01:27] And he said, "I choose to be them."
[1:01:29] He married the ones with the gore door
[1:01:31] knobs and he said they fought all the
[1:01:34] time. He went back to check it out and
[1:01:36] you know we were talking about this. The
[1:01:38] pastors were talking about this. There
[1:01:41] was a room full of us
[1:01:44] and I had to have my two cents worth. I
[1:01:47] said there's not a pastor in North
[1:01:48] America that if a young couple came to
[1:01:50] them and said you have how much money do
[1:01:52] you got a job or money to support her
[1:01:54] would marry them with nothing.
[1:01:58] Not one pastor.
[1:02:00] But our prophet did
[1:02:02] and we love him.
[1:02:04] No we don't. We hate him.
[1:02:06] You hate him because you wouldn't do
[1:02:08] what he did. Yeah.
[1:02:13] You know what the prophet asked that
[1:02:15] girl? He said, "If your husband runs out
[1:02:17] of has nothing for you, will you leave
[1:02:20] him?" She said, "No."
[1:02:21] Yeah.
[1:02:22] And go back to your mom and dad. She
[1:02:23] said, "No."
[1:02:24] And he said, "Now to the man, he never
[1:02:26] had nothing." Nothing.
[1:02:29] That's right.
[1:02:30] Now nothing.
[1:02:32] He said, "What will you do to provide?"
[1:02:34] And he said, "I'll work my finger to the
[1:02:36] bone.
[1:02:42] But if you go to youth camp, they'll
[1:02:44] say, "Now, don't you even consider
[1:02:45] looking at the opposite sex until you
[1:02:48] get a career,
[1:02:49] until you have a job, until you have a
[1:02:52] house rented, and they're all doing
[1:02:54] pornography because we won't let them
[1:02:56] get married and have real sex.
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:10] That was all God's plan.
[1:03:12] If God wouldn't want me to be that or
[1:03:14] wanted you to be that way, he would have
[1:03:16] made you differently.
[1:03:22] He says it's about time we get into the
[1:03:24] ribbon of it, the rhythm of it. And he
[1:03:27] promised it for these last days, these
[1:03:29] things to take place. And he said Jesus
[1:03:33] would come and he did. And he said
[1:03:35] there'll be a millennium and there will
[1:03:37] be. And he said we're in this new day
[1:03:40] and the lamb has come with his light and
[1:03:44] it's shining upon us. He said we're
[1:03:45] dawning a new day. He said I feel it all
[1:03:47] over me. He said, "Watch this. There
[1:03:50] will be no more night.
[1:03:52] There will be no more darkness, no more
[1:03:55] saddles, no skies, no dim, no dark
[1:03:58] skies, no midnights, no cape, no graves,
[1:04:03] no flowers on the hillside, no funeral
[1:04:05] possessions. There won't be needed
[1:04:07] doctors. We won't need the World Econ uh
[1:04:09] World Health Organization.
[1:04:15] And it looks like he put in here
[1:04:16] there'll be no mosquitoes.
[1:04:22] look like the last thing he put in.
[1:04:26] And he said, "I can feel the Holy Ghost
[1:04:28] rising on me now
[1:04:30] to shine."
[1:04:32] Let's go to the next quote here. He
[1:04:33] said, he said, "When I look back in the
[1:04:35] days of created down," he said, "what a
[1:04:37] day would you want to live in?" He said,
[1:04:40] "This day, this exact day, when when the
[1:04:43] whole world's falling apart, I'd want to
[1:04:45] live in this day." I'm going to drop to
[1:04:47] the to our verse, Vicki.
[1:04:50] Psalm 66 and verse 8, he said, "Oh,
[1:04:53] bless our God, ye people, and make a
[1:04:56] voice of praise to be heard, which
[1:04:59] holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth
[1:05:02] not our feet to be moved. For thou, oh
[1:05:05] God, has proven us, and thou hast tried
[1:05:08] us." And so, See, God's doing these
[1:05:11] things to see if we'll do it right.
[1:05:13] And in many cases,
[1:05:17] well, you judge. Verse 10. For thou, oh
[1:05:20] God, has proven us,
[1:05:23] and thou has tried us as silver stride,
[1:05:27] and thou has brought us into the net.
[1:05:31] We don't like the net. I don't like the
[1:05:32] net.
[1:05:33] But that's part of God's plan.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:40] If we just would concentrate on Christ
[1:05:42] and let our light shine and we not have
[1:05:45] to fix everything to our own creeds.
[1:05:48] We all have our own creed. We don't have
[1:05:49] to preach against a denomination. We are
[1:05:52] a walking denomination. Well, my daddy
[1:05:54] never raised me that way. I don't care.
[1:06:04] He brought us into the net and thou
[1:06:06] layst afflictions
[1:06:08] upon my loins. Thou has caused men to
[1:06:12] roide over my heads.
[1:06:16] We went through the fire and through the
[1:06:17] water. I don't like any of those
[1:06:19] situations.
[1:06:21] But thou brought us out into a healthy
[1:06:25] place,
[1:06:27] and I will go to thy house.
[1:06:30] See, when gross darkness comes upon the
[1:06:33] people, when gross darkness is on the
[1:06:35] world, I'll go to thy house
[1:06:37] with a burnt offering, said, and I will
[1:06:39] pay thee my vows.
[1:06:43] Come and hear all ye that fear God, that
[1:06:47] I will declare what he doth do hath done
[1:06:51] for my soul.
[1:06:54] Blessed be God which has not turned away
[1:06:57] my prayer,
[1:06:58] nor his mercy
[1:07:01] from me.
[1:07:04] Wow.
[1:07:06] You know, God had amazing grace and
[1:07:09] amazing mercy
[1:07:11] for this boy.
[1:07:14] And God expects all that he did for me
[1:07:17] for me to give it out
[1:07:20] to all that come in my pathway. And he
[1:07:22] expects the same of all of you.
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:31] Psalms 9:1 and2 he said, "I will praise
[1:07:34] thee, oh Lord, for my whole heart, and I
[1:07:37] will show forth all thy marvelous
[1:07:39] works." You know what the marvelous
[1:07:40] works are? Me.
[1:07:43] You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:07:44] "You want to see a miracle? Become a
[1:07:46] miracle."
[1:07:47] That's right.
[1:07:47] I am a miracle.
[1:07:49] Amen.
[1:07:50] I'm a walking miracle.
[1:07:52] Number one, I could have almost had a
[1:07:54] gargle yesterday.
[1:07:56] Uh, when I went to school, I had to go
[1:07:58] to speech therapy to even be able to
[1:08:00] speak English.
[1:08:02] God has a real sense of humor. He picks
[1:08:05] the people out of the congregation that
[1:08:06] don't know how to talk. Then he says,
[1:08:08] "Talk."
[1:08:10] You know, I couldn't say. I couldn't
[1:08:12] say, you know, my nickname on school was
[1:08:14] Mikow because I couldn't say mcow.
[1:08:17] And they all laughed at me and I laughed
[1:08:18] with them because I thought it was
[1:08:20] hilarious.
[1:08:22] I didn't realize that was peer pressure.
[1:08:24] Nobody had told me.
[1:08:26] You know why? Because my mom and dad
[1:08:27] loved me.
[1:08:30] I wasn't affected by peer pressure.
[1:08:31] Because I had a solid home.
[1:08:35] I had a home that when I went home, my
[1:08:36] mommy was there. She wasn't gone away
[1:08:38] working.
[1:08:43] Amen.
[1:08:46] Wow.
[1:08:49] The Lord has not forsaken us. Amen. This
[1:08:53] is the greatest hour we could live in.
[1:08:56] Imagine. Imagine the hour that we can
[1:08:59] just go along and be friendly and and
[1:09:02] and do things for people and and and and
[1:09:05] not tell nobody about it.
[1:09:08] And and show them the example of Christ.
[1:09:11] Invite a stranger over to your house and
[1:09:13] give them a nice meal.
[1:09:15] Yeah. I want I want to show you
[1:09:17] something. those people that come over.
[1:09:19] I found a video of five TV evangelists
[1:09:23] that testified of the truth of God's
[1:09:26] prophet.
[1:09:28] Three of them they knew.
[1:09:32] At least three of them had been in the
[1:09:33] prophet's services. One had been
[1:09:36] miraculously healed. You know how long
[1:09:38] the healing took?
[1:09:40] 10 years.
[1:09:43] You want me tell you what the healing
[1:09:44] was? It was a preacher woman. Oh,
[1:09:53] of course the Bible says that women
[1:09:54] aren't to
[1:09:56] preach.
[1:09:58] But God still healed her.
[1:10:00] And she came before the prophet
[1:10:03] and the doctors had told her, the
[1:10:05] prophet seen it, said, "It is a physical
[1:10:07] impossibility for you to have a baby.
[1:10:10] You are not built
[1:10:12] to have a baby."
[1:10:14] The prophet said, "Thus sayaith the
[1:10:16] Lord,
[1:10:17] go home. You'll have a baby."
[1:10:21] 10 years later, she started swelling up.
[1:10:25] She started had to open her belt.
[1:10:28] She went to the doctor. The doctor said,
[1:10:31] "You got gas.
[1:10:33] You know, you're going through."
[1:10:35] Actually, the doctor said, "You're going
[1:10:36] through the change of life and you're
[1:10:38] bloated."
[1:10:41] So, she said, "I went home and I went
[1:10:42] through some more changes.
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:46] went back to another doctor and he said,
[1:10:49] "You have a six-month baby in your
[1:10:52] 10 years later."
[1:10:54] Because the prophet said, "Thus sayeth
[1:10:56] the Lord."
[1:10:57] You just go home.
[1:10:59] The baby's coming.
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:02] Amen.
[1:11:04] Anyway, we showed him this video.
[1:11:07] This this a Pentecostal minister ran
[1:11:09] traveled the world multiple places
[1:11:11] especially South America.
[1:11:14] I tell you what, we went to the mission
[1:11:16] field before we ever heard of this
[1:11:19] message.
[1:11:21] Before we had children, we went to the
[1:11:23] mission field in Montrat and we traveled
[1:11:26] with this couple.
[1:11:28] See, God has a season and a time for
[1:11:32] everything. Do you know how much time
[1:11:34] has passed since then?
[1:11:36] about 35 years. Take a look at Jared.
[1:11:40] He's not here today. He's at John
[1:11:41] Danquist meetings, by the way. He's
[1:11:43] supporting our church.
[1:11:48] I showed them this video and they
[1:11:50] gobbled it up. And would you like to
[1:11:51] know what book they took home with them?
[1:11:54] God sends a prophet to Africa
[1:11:56] and he said, "We'll be back in two weeks
[1:11:58] for your camp meeting." And he said,
[1:12:00] "Not not just us, but we gave it to our
[1:12:04] pastor and we'll bring the church with
[1:12:05] us."
[1:12:10] What are you doing?
[1:12:13] Are we going to judge them when they get
[1:12:15] here?
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:22] See, God is just God.
[1:12:25] Arise and shine
[1:12:27] for his light. It's not my light. I'm no
[1:12:29] good.
[1:12:31] His light has come
[1:12:32] upon thee.
[1:12:35] When gross darkness is upon the earth
[1:12:38] and upon the the people,
[1:12:40] God's glory is rising up in a little
[1:12:43] bride.
[1:12:45] It's rising up in a little bride.
[1:12:50] Amen.
[1:12:52] What an amazing time to live in.
[1:12:56] What an amazing time to share Jehovah to
[1:13:00] a dying world.
[1:13:02] What an amazing time. I don't mean by we
[1:13:05] don't Lots of times people don't need
[1:13:06] preaching. You know what most people
[1:13:08] need today? Kindness.
[1:13:11] Just kindness.
[1:13:13] Kindness. There's a reason kindness,
[1:13:15] brotherly kindness is right under the
[1:13:16] stature of perfect love.
[1:13:19] The the capstone is is the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:21] That's perfect love. God is love.
[1:13:23] So brotherly kindness. I you know I
[1:13:25] don't have to preach to people that
[1:13:26] don't have God. I just need to be kind
[1:13:28] to them.
[1:13:29] Be kind to them. Just just kind
[1:13:32] because it's not natural to be kind.
[1:13:35] Do you want me to tell you something? Oh
[1:13:37] man, I feel like preaching this morning.
[1:13:38] You know the brother brought something
[1:13:39] out yesterday said you know why Satan
[1:13:42] has brought education and taught you
[1:13:45] that you need a career and not to get
[1:13:48] married young.
[1:13:50] I'm going to shock you. I don't even
[1:13:53] don't even I'm sorry if you're offended,
[1:13:54] but
[1:13:57] it's
[1:13:57] because you're selfish pig
[1:14:01] because God expected you to give all
[1:14:02] that you have to your baby.
[1:14:06] Praise God.
[1:14:07] So all the people that have trouble with
[1:14:09] babies,
[1:14:13] it's exactly what you listen to Saturday
[1:14:15] morning. He said, "God expected you to
[1:14:17] bring forth a son of God, and it would
[1:14:19] be no more about you,
[1:14:21] but it'd be about that little baby
[1:14:22] that's a son of God that's laying in the
[1:14:24] manger.
[1:14:27] But oh, no, no, no, no. We're not going
[1:14:29] to do that. We're going to buy a little
[1:14:30] kitty, a little puppy dog, because we
[1:14:33] want to go to the bars that night and
[1:14:35] the movies." That's what he t that's
[1:14:36] what the prophet said. Because we can
[1:14:38] control them. We can send them to the
[1:14:40] daycare center for pups.
[1:14:45] In what world would you send a son of
[1:14:47] God
[1:14:48] to daycare?
[1:14:50] That's that's
[1:14:56] Amen.
[1:15:00] Now, if you didn't like that, said just
[1:15:02] blame the minister on Saturday morning.
[1:15:04] He said, "That's why you don't have
[1:15:05] children because you're selfish."
[1:15:08] because you won't die to yourself to
[1:15:10] give it to your baby
[1:15:12] cuz you want your own stuff.
[1:15:18] And that's why and that just flips right
[1:15:20] over in the spirit.
[1:15:23] Well, we want our own everything
[1:15:24] comfortable. And if if you know, Brother
[1:15:27] Bram said things like this, if people
[1:15:28] come forward that are going to cry,
[1:15:30] well, we don't want that. Crying in
[1:15:32] church, oh, I don't know what to do when
[1:15:35] somebody cries.
[1:15:37] Tell you what, when we quit crying in
[1:15:38] church, you might as well lock the door
[1:15:40] and put closed on it.
[1:15:43] When you quit having emotion in church,
[1:15:44] we we talked about this, too. You know,
[1:15:46] when I start my tractors, they make
[1:15:48] noise. They go Jared's new tractor. It's
[1:15:51] a It's starting to start like an old, I
[1:15:53] don't know, steam engine. It's bigger
[1:15:55] and it go
[1:16:01] We come to church and we
[1:16:06] If you clam up in church,
[1:16:11] it's either two reasons. Either you
[1:16:12] don't have a God or you don't know him.
[1:16:17] It has nothing to do with cold weather
[1:16:19] in Canada.
[1:16:21] If you believe that, you're just
[1:16:26] Because everything's alive make noise.
[1:16:30] Everything that's alive makes noise. And
[1:16:32] the prophet said, "If you don't make
[1:16:33] noise, you're you're dead." Yeah,
[1:16:35] you're not buried yet. You know, you
[1:16:36] know, you know, God has a way of getting
[1:16:38] things across. You know, we went to a
[1:16:40] funeral for my neighbor. He was 93.
[1:16:44] The only thing my kids I'm closing my
[1:16:46] iPad. The only thing my kids know is
[1:16:48] that neighbor.
[1:16:50] You know how many neighbors we had? One.
[1:16:53] Donatrices Young. He was 93.
[1:16:57] We just went to the funeral. Matter of
[1:16:59] fact, his funeral was yesterday. You
[1:17:01] know when he died?
[1:17:04] July 1st.
[1:17:06] It was an open casket.
[1:17:13] He didn't make no noise. He was froze.
[1:17:22] Some of us spiritually
[1:17:24] are froze. Amen.
[1:17:27] And if you know our prophet when he
[1:17:28] preached, he sat on the the plat the
[1:17:30] pulpit the one time, dangled his feet
[1:17:32] off the thing, and he had embarrassing
[1:17:34] things happen like he was a human being.
[1:17:37] But we make church not human. So then
[1:17:39] when a kid cries or a parent somebody
[1:17:41] burps or or does something that's a
[1:17:43] human function, we're just like,
[1:17:49] I don't want a church like that.
[1:17:51] No.
[1:17:52] Because you know why? Everybody's dead.
[1:17:55] Everybody's dead. I want a church that
[1:17:57] when the Holy Spirit comes down,
[1:17:59] and I hope it's me,
[1:18:01] but if it's not me and it's you and you
[1:18:04] lose completely stone drunk, you don't
[1:18:07] need to. I'll be I'll be getting right
[1:18:09] beside you if you're stone drunk. I was
[1:18:10] like,
[1:18:13] cuz you know when buddies go out
[1:18:14] drinking, they all want to be drunk at
[1:18:17] the same time.
[1:18:21] There's not very many people that go in
[1:18:22] the car and there's five or six of them
[1:18:24] go drinking
[1:18:26] and they have watch this.
[1:18:29] Brother Brandham preached he was a
[1:18:31] natural typology.
[1:18:33] They can hardly never get somebody to be
[1:18:36] the designated driver.
[1:18:39] But you know, spiritually, we can get
[1:18:42] piles of designated drivers in the
[1:18:44] message church
[1:18:45] because nobody wants to partake of what
[1:18:48] God has for you
[1:18:50] or the body.
[1:18:54] Well, I might be embarrassed. Well,
[1:18:56] guess what? I didn't wake up this
[1:18:57] morning thinking I was going to be a
[1:18:59] preacher.
[1:19:00] Yeah, that's true.
[1:19:02] For sure. Not when I married my
[1:19:03] sweetheart. That was as far as the east
[1:19:06] is from the west and a little bit more
[1:19:07] in between. That
[1:19:14] brother Brown preached about I'll be a
[1:19:16] fool for Christ. Whose fool are
[1:19:20] you?
[1:19:23] Amen.
[1:19:25] See, we've we've made things
[1:19:28] that people get upset over things that
[1:19:31] God
[1:19:33] ordained.
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:36] What did Jesus say? He said, "Forbid
[1:19:39] them not, for such is the kingdom of
[1:19:42] heaven."
[1:19:42] Correct.
[1:19:44] Correct.
[1:19:45] And people would leave this church
[1:19:46] because of kids.
[1:19:49] They're not believers. No, no,
[1:19:52] not Bible believers. For sure not Bible
[1:19:54] believers. How could you be a Bible
[1:19:56] believer? Like, is Christ Jesus your
[1:19:58] Lord?
[1:20:06] Huh?
[1:20:08] Wow.
[1:20:10] See how See how we It's so easy to point
[1:20:14] out the creeds in denominational
[1:20:17] churches,
[1:20:18] but we all have creeds. Yeah.
[1:20:20] You know, and so, Brother Dale, I want I
[1:20:22] want to just give and I need to shut up
[1:20:24] and cook, but I want to just tell you
[1:20:26] something. Brother Dale can't preach my
[1:20:28] creeds.
[1:20:30] And if I do, they're only worth
[1:20:35] Dale's saying.
[1:20:37] That's not God's word.
[1:20:39] You know, I grew up, my creeds would be
[1:20:40] I grew up, we couldn't ride a bike on
[1:20:42] Sunday.
[1:20:43] We didn't play catch or kick a ball on
[1:20:45] Sunday.
[1:20:45] We definitely, if you went to the
[1:20:47] restaurant, well, you were already in
[1:20:48] hell. And if you buy gas, well, you were
[1:20:51] in eternal damnation.
[1:20:55] But see, that was creeds.
[1:20:58] That was denominational creeds that I
[1:21:00] was brought up under. And so is so is
[1:21:03] buying that. So is dollary.
[1:21:05] And so is so is thinking kids are going
[1:21:08] to be dead in church. And then they're
[1:21:11] going to we're going to we're going to
[1:21:12] have a healing service every service. We
[1:21:13] want the kids to come to church alive.
[1:21:16] We want to kill them. They're in church.
[1:21:19] We want to hear from them.
[1:21:21] You want them to die and then we're
[1:21:22] going to heal that God will raise them
[1:21:23] back from the dead when we go in the
[1:21:25] fellowship. Well, maybe the fellowship
[1:21:26] gets loud sometimes. Maybe after the
[1:21:28] fellowship.
[1:21:31] See, we can see the ridiculousness in
[1:21:34] the creeds of denominations, but we
[1:21:36] can't see them in our own uprigging.
[1:21:40] We can't see them in the own upbringing.
[1:21:48] Huh?
[1:21:53] God help us. You know,
[1:22:01] amazing.
[1:22:02] God's amazing,
[1:22:04] but he's not always. For Give me my
[1:22:06] Isaiah 61. I'm going to close reading
[1:22:08] those two scriptures.
[1:22:11] You see, we have to be careful, church.
[1:22:13] Yeah,
[1:22:13] we're we're about going home and God's
[1:22:16] planning on us to to line up
[1:22:18] and and see it like there's things that
[1:22:21] God expects us to do,
[1:22:23] but there's things that you're dumping
[1:22:25] on people that you're divi you're
[1:22:28] killing people.
[1:22:32] Isaiah. Amen. Let me show you something.
[1:22:36] I had I had people in this message
[1:22:41] tell me that people had too big a
[1:22:43] families
[1:22:45] and that person that told me this the
[1:22:47] truth this truth I'm I'm hiding it from
[1:22:50] you because I'm telling it in such a way
[1:22:52] you won't know in the message and I said
[1:22:54] you know that your prophet preached
[1:22:56] against birth control
[1:22:58] and he said
[1:23:01] but if you can't you know brother you
[1:23:04] know the Bible never preached on control
[1:23:06] of children.
[1:23:10] I mean, if you were going to be a, you
[1:23:12] know, if you were going to be a deacon
[1:23:13] or a bishop in the church, you had have
[1:23:15] control of your house.
[1:23:17] But that wasn't talking about kids
[1:23:18] playing with toys or being kids.
[1:23:23] I mean, if you want stone silence, you
[1:23:25] need to go to Catholic church.
[1:23:27] They're really quiet.
[1:23:29] Look, hey,
[1:23:32] Mary.
[1:23:35] Here's some
[1:23:37] I only went to one funeral or something
[1:23:39] there.
[1:23:42] Amen. You This is kindergarten. I know
[1:23:45] it's kindergarten,
[1:23:46] but it's time for that. That's what he
[1:23:48] was preaching in Toronto.
[1:23:50] Amen.
[1:23:53] There's things that God God expects and
[1:23:55] that we we need to love. We we are in
[1:23:57] the greatest time. We need to be a
[1:23:59] support a love. Forget about people's
[1:24:02] own
[1:24:03] opinions and and and their own personal
[1:24:06] creeds. I don't want to know your creeds
[1:24:08] and and mine aren't worth nothing
[1:24:09] either.
[1:24:10] Amen. If it ain't Bible, don't share it
[1:24:12] with me.
[1:24:14] If it ain't Bible, don't share it with
[1:24:15] me. I don't want to hear it.
[1:24:17] Arise and shine, for thy light is come
[1:24:21] and the glory
[1:24:23] of myself.
[1:24:25] No.
[1:24:26] And the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:24:30] thee.
[1:24:31] Now the next verse is going to tell us
[1:24:33] when.
[1:24:36] For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[1:24:38] whole earth. Is the whole earth covered
[1:24:39] with darkness?
[1:24:42] Earthquakes. The whole world's groaning
[1:24:44] for the manifestations of the sons of
[1:24:47] amen.
[1:24:48] You know, I just had something come to
[1:24:49] me fresh. said, "Did you ever think that
[1:24:52] you ever think you know the brother Bram
[1:24:54] said that the rapture couldn't take
[1:24:55] place until the last seed come in?"
[1:24:59] Watch this.
[1:25:02] This is as fresh as it gets. Did you
[1:25:04] ever think the last seed hasn't been
[1:25:06] born yet because we wouldn't let our
[1:25:08] sons and daughters get married and
[1:25:09] produce sons and daughters of God?
[1:25:15] That's exactly what the brother said
[1:25:16] last night.
[1:25:18] Your commission
[1:25:19] as a church is to reproduce
[1:25:22] sons and daughters of God.
[1:25:25] But we won't let them marry.
[1:25:27] So we can't have a rapture because
[1:25:30] little Harry or Spotter or Junior hasn't
[1:25:33] even been born yet.
[1:25:35] So I'm going around in torture
[1:25:38] because we think you got to be 45 before
[1:25:43] and a career
[1:25:44] and an education of divinity and
[1:25:49] I wonder
[1:25:51] I wonder
[1:25:58] darkness should cover the whole earth
[1:26:00] and gross darkness. Do you know he says
[1:26:03] you notice he makes it worse on the
[1:26:06] people in the world?
[1:26:10] Why don't he just say darkness on the
[1:26:11] people too?
[1:26:13] No, he says gross darkness.
[1:26:16] But
[1:26:17] when Satan comes in like a flood, God
[1:26:20] always rises up a standard against him.
[1:26:24] Wow. But the Lord shall rise upon thee,
[1:26:29] and his glory shall be seen
[1:26:34] upon thee.
[1:26:36] And that can't happen
[1:26:39] if you're not alive.
[1:26:42] Can't happen if you're not alive.
[1:26:46] Amen. Let's stand.
[1:26:50] I hope you'll forgive me for being
[1:26:51] honest.
[1:26:56] Amen. God help us.
[1:27:01] Amen. God has amazing things planned for
[1:27:04] us.
[1:27:04] Oh yes.
[1:27:05] But you know what you have to do? You
[1:27:07] have to let go of your creeds.
[1:27:10] You have to let go of your ideas.
[1:27:12] But I thought
[1:27:15] I thought
[1:27:18] But
[1:27:20] man, God help me to let go of my creeds.
[1:27:23] Just let just let God do his thing. Just
[1:27:26] let God be in charge. You know, I think
[1:27:29] of and I'm going to close, but I think
[1:27:31] of the disciples when they come back and
[1:27:32] and there was other men that were
[1:27:34] worshiping God and doing healing and the
[1:27:36] disciples stopped them and they came and
[1:27:38] they were bragging to our Lord. They
[1:27:40] said, "We've seen other people
[1:27:42] preaching, but we stopped them. We've
[1:27:44] seen other people being kind to people
[1:27:46] in the grocery store and buying food for
[1:27:48] people they didn't know and and like
[1:27:49] holding the door and just being a a
[1:27:52] decent human being." And we stopped
[1:27:54] them.
[1:27:55] We stopped them.
[1:27:57] And our Lord said, "You did." Uhhuh.
[1:28:01] They said, "If they're on our side,
[1:28:04] why would you stop them?"
[1:28:08] That's like the quote that I said I was
[1:28:10] going to put up where the prophet said
[1:28:11] that everybody's different changed in
[1:28:13] God's pocket.
[1:28:15] And so when you see people come to camp
[1:28:16] and they have cut hair, makeup, and
[1:28:18] pants on, that's not what the Bible
[1:28:20] says. But they might be changed in God's
[1:28:22] pocket.
[1:28:25] Maybe they're a nickel.
[1:28:27] Maybe they're a quarter. I'm not the one
[1:28:29] to decide.
[1:28:30] Maybe God will change them to a double
[1:28:32] silver dollar,
[1:28:33] to a tuni.
[1:28:34] That's what we pray for.
[1:28:36] But it has to be God that does that.
[1:28:39] You know, you know, he said, you know,
[1:28:41] and it's the scripture says, "Blessed
[1:28:42] are thy son Jonah for flesh and blood."
[1:28:47] You can't give somebody the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:50] You cannot tell somebody that they are
[1:28:53] going to get the Holy Ghost if they take
[1:28:54] their pants off and their makeup and and
[1:28:56] chop cutting their hair. It says, "Thy
[1:28:59] father which is in heaven
[1:29:02] has revealed it
[1:29:04] unto thee. And upon this rock of
[1:29:08] revelation,
[1:29:10] I'll build my church.
[1:29:13] Oh boy. Hallelujah. I got to stop. Wow.
[1:29:17] Amen. Let's uh count your blessings.
[1:29:22] Count your blessings.
[1:29:24] Amen. Let's sing this song. Just a got a
[1:29:27] few verses, but it just we should no
[1:29:30] matter what your situation is,
[1:29:33] somebody's worse off than you.
[1:29:36] Amen. Somebody's worse off than you. God
[1:29:39] help us. Amen.
[1:29:42] Amen. When upon life's pillows you are
[1:29:46] tempted,
[1:29:49] when you are discouraged, saint
[1:29:53] is lost. Count your many blessings. Name
[1:29:57] them one by one. And it will surprise
[1:30:02] you what the Lord has done.
