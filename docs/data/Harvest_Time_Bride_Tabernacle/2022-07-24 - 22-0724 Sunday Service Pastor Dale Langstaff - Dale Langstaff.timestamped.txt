[34:44] welcome for Fellowship for sure anybody
[34:47] and everybody
[34:49] amen
[34:51] just welcome you all here this morning
[34:53] God bless you all amen just a great
[34:56] opportunity to be here let's turn to
[34:58] Joshua and we're going to read Joshua
[35:01] Joshua 1 1-3 and five and six he meant
[35:04] for our Texan
[35:06] I wanna I wanna
[35:10] Maybe
[35:13] talk to each one of us I I don't know if
[35:15] it was the anointing but talk to parents
[35:17] Maybe
[35:18] but uh even all of us and you know our
[35:21] Prophet said this he said he said the
[35:23] Christians are always talking about what
[35:26] God did do
[35:28] and they're always talking about what
[35:29] God's going to do
[35:32] but they don't see nothing that he's
[35:34] doing
[35:35] right now
[35:38] these things not ought to be because we
[35:40] believe that Jesus Hebrews 13 8 is Jesus
[35:43] Christ the same yesterday today and
[35:45] forever so if he was great he's still
[35:48] great and if he's going to be great he
[35:50] always was great amen and so it should
[35:53] change our thinking amen and I want to
[35:56] show you in this topic that we're
[35:57] talking about it's mentioned in three
[36:00] different places in the Bible that God
[36:02] himself tells us to do this
[36:04] and I I'm going to tell you that I I
[36:07] don't think generally speaking generally
[36:10] speaking we do this if at all very
[36:13] little
[36:15] and and I really felt uh
[36:18] you know checked amen and that God was
[36:22] dealing with me and studying this and
[36:24] I've had it on my desk for a few weeks
[36:26] amen
[36:27] so let's just read we're going to read
[36:29] one to three and five and six now after
[36:31] the death of Moses the servant the Lord
[36:33] came
[36:35] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[36:37] spake to Joshua the son of nun Moses and
[36:40] Minister saying this is God himself
[36:43] talking to Joshua Moses my servant is
[36:46] dead now therefore arise and go to this
[36:50] Jordan thou and all the people onto a
[36:52] land which I give to them even to the
[36:56] children of Israel not now try to make
[36:58] this personal to the bride amen and in
[37:01] the day we're living and every place
[37:03] that the soul of thy feet tread upon I
[37:07] have given to you
[37:09] as I said on to Moses now just before we
[37:12] go on we're going to go to five but here
[37:14] the Lord is not talking to Moses
[37:18] he's done talking to Moses
[37:20] he socked in to Joshua
[37:22] amen the verse 5 just waiting for it
[37:25] amen and these shall not any man be it
[37:28] there shall not be any man able to stand
[37:30] before thee all the days of thy life
[37:35] now I was sort of truth no he's not
[37:37] talking to Moses
[37:39] he's talking to you
[37:41] he's talking to today
[37:43] today
[37:44] as I was with Moses so shall I be with
[37:48] thee I will not fail thee nor forsake
[37:52] thee well that's that's us that's you
[37:56] man uh oh where did my verse 5 go
[38:01] amen
[38:02] amen thank you Lord let's go to uh
[38:05] Joshua 4 and 6.
[38:09] four and six thank you Amy
[38:12] Joshua 4 and 6 that says that this may
[38:16] now this is also still the Lord talking
[38:18] he's given Joshua some Commandments and
[38:20] we're going to talk about this and this
[38:22] may be a sign unto you
[38:25] oh
[38:27] that when your children ask you
[38:32] they're fathers
[38:33] you made it fairly personal
[38:36] in the time to come saying what Menace
[38:39] see
[38:41] these stones
[38:43] Hallelujah Lord Jesus we ask you just
[38:45] come and do a miracle Among Us in your
[38:48] presence and you hope any man could read
[38:51] the word Lord Jesus but only you can
[38:53] take the scales off our eyes and give us
[38:55] revelation of what you mean to say to us
[38:58] today
[39:00] and we pray that we'll be better people
[39:02] and better bride and and and obey your
[39:06] word better and be in line better Lord
[39:08] Jesus because of your presence today and
[39:11] we'll give you the glory for it
[39:13] your beautiful name we pray amen amen
[39:16] you may have your seats this morning
[39:18] Hallelujah we we see here that God was
[39:21] wanting to put a sign
[39:23] to the children
[39:24] for what God had done in Joshua's life
[39:28] and we see here that God had made it
[39:30] personal and it's very hard for us we
[39:33] for whatever reason in history we're
[39:35] always looking back like a frog or we're
[39:39] looking ahead
[39:40] but God is exactly the same
[39:44] as he was when the prophet was here when
[39:47] Jesus Christ was here
[39:49] but I I want to bring this up today and
[39:53] I want to show you some things here you
[39:55] know the problem here here in the
[39:57] scriptures and we're going to read some
[39:58] more scriptures we're going to go to uh
[40:00] Joshua 4 1. and I want to show you that
[40:02] God's not telling Joshua to remind the
[40:06] children of what he did in Moses life
[40:11] that got me kind of because Moses is
[40:15] kind of like the superhero Moses was God
[40:17] the Pharaoh and Moses had the plagues
[40:20] and all these magnificent things that
[40:22] were very easy to remind the children of
[40:25] what God did
[40:27] but God didn't say tell them what Moses
[40:29] did
[40:30] or what I did in Moses life
[40:33] amen he didn't say that now now listen
[40:36] that's God and it wasn't wrong if you
[40:39] did but it caught me like why did he say
[40:43] it was to remind the children how I
[40:46] brought the children of Israel from
[40:47] Almighty head
[40:48] oh it would have been tremendous
[40:51] all the plagues across the Red Sea and
[40:53] just delivered the pillar of fire in the
[40:55] cloud at night God had just how he
[40:57] kicked Egypt from the children of Israel
[41:00] and it would have been magnificent but
[41:01] God didn't tell them to do that
[41:04] he said tell them exactly what I did
[41:06] today
[41:08] today what'd God do today for you
[41:12] today what did he do this week
[41:15] for you because here you see God gave
[41:18] the the land to the Israelites the
[41:20] promised land which is our Holy Ghost
[41:22] amen and he said you'll cross the Jordan
[41:24] and you know when the the ark went in
[41:27] and the priests the Levites went into
[41:28] the the Jordan River we know it was at
[41:31] harvesting and the river was completely
[41:34] on his Brim
[41:35] it was running over like it would have
[41:37] been Springtime here not not like we're
[41:39] not like in the dry time it was blooming
[41:42] to its brim of its banks
[41:46] and we know the story how the the once
[41:49] the sole of their feet touched the edge
[41:51] just touched the edge of that water you
[41:53] know why didn't God have it do it when
[41:54] it was dry
[41:57] it would have been just I mean
[41:59] it still would have been God
[42:02] no God does things it's such a
[42:04] magnificent way
[42:06] to get glory to himself and he wanted
[42:09] the kids
[42:10] to know about that Glory
[42:12] you're in the kitchen you know John said
[42:15] in Revelation now watch this you know
[42:17] maybe our kids aren't interested in
[42:18] church because it's our fault
[42:23] maybe it's the preacher's faults
[42:26] and the father's fault so yeah watch
[42:28] this John said in Revelations
[42:30] that I was in the spirit
[42:33] on the Lord's Day
[42:35] now our Prophet talked about that some
[42:36] he said you know if you go to a ball
[42:38] game there ain't nothing about that ball
[42:40] game that excites you
[42:43] unless you get in the spirit of it ah
[42:47] you get in the spirit of that ball game
[42:49] and it's a hot ball game and they don't
[42:51] have air conditioning on the bleachers
[42:52] and it's just the ball game and the
[42:54] guy's making a few million dollars and
[42:56] you're making 10 bucks an hour and
[42:57] you're buying a ticket that's paying his
[42:59] wages and you're just sitting there but
[43:00] he hits a home run and everybody goes
[43:01] wow
[43:06] because you got in the spirit of that
[43:07] ball game and whatever it'd be hockey
[43:10] sport you said you got in the spirit if
[43:12] you love something you get in the spirit
[43:14] of it
[43:15] oh I can't wait to go to you know
[43:18] wherever
[43:19] because
[43:21] but then our kids
[43:23] now it's not the wait now let me tell
[43:25] you something it's not the kid's fault
[43:27] it's not the kid's fault it's the
[43:29] father's fault
[43:31] and the ministry's fault
[43:33] and and it's Sunday now and it's time to
[43:35] go to church and say oh
[43:37] oh man that's gonna be boring
[43:42] oh it's gonna be odd we ain't got an air
[43:45] conditioner
[43:49] but God's telling the fathers
[43:52] through Joshua
[43:54] that when you when the priests were in
[43:56] the the the the the river that God
[43:58] stopped the river to a brim up in the
[44:00] head stop like when the cross the the
[44:02] Red Sea
[44:05] no no it said its prims and the water's
[44:07] all coming down from the mountains and
[44:09] the rivers and all that
[44:10] how did God do that
[44:13] now the water didn't stop running way up
[44:15] above
[44:19] well it's just one way to say it was
[44:21] just God
[44:22] it was just it was Supernatural
[44:26] because I was because remember there was
[44:29] thousands if not millions of people
[44:31] crossed
[44:33] some of them were old what was it Kane
[44:37] the water's like oh come
[44:42] some of them are young
[44:43] they were crawling
[44:45] so it wasn't like it was just the Army
[44:47] cross and they did it really fast
[44:50] no God held it there as long as he
[44:52] needed to hold it there
[44:55] and that wasn't all
[44:57] because Joshua got it had ordered Joshua
[45:00] when he's crossing the Red Sea or
[45:02] crossing the Jordan River
[45:04] he said now when the priests are still
[45:07] in there holding the ark which was the
[45:10] presence and that day it was The
[45:11] Presence of Jehovah Jireh
[45:13] oh that's that's beautiful
[45:16] now you are the ark today
[45:18] you are packed in The Presence of
[45:20] Jehovah Jireh now one spec difference
[45:24] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:25] that's Christ's own blood it's Grace on
[45:28] spirit
[45:29] amen and he said so now when the when
[45:32] they're in there and they're holding me
[45:34] there I'd be like you being there
[45:37] because you're the ark today
[45:40] so when they're standing there and the
[45:42] people are done walking through
[45:44] he said I want you to pick a man from
[45:46] each one of the tribes of Israel and I
[45:48] want them to pick up a big Stone
[45:51] a big Stone
[45:53] and he said I want you to place it rate
[45:55] the 12 Stones rate where the feet of the
[45:58] priests were
[46:00] now they weren't they see they weren't
[46:01] God now because the baptism of the Holy
[46:04] Ghost hadn't come yet but where the feet
[46:05] of the priests were that held God
[46:09] not only so if you don't believe this
[46:11] morning that you're God what do you
[46:13] believe that you're holding God
[46:16] do you believe you're backing God
[46:18] because the priest said the baptism will
[46:20] he goes and come and they were just
[46:21] holding him on his shoulder maybe you're
[46:23] holding them in your soul
[46:25] and so there's my feet so they put a big
[46:27] Stone there
[46:29] and so God didn't just hold the water
[46:31] back from the Jordan
[46:33] well the people were crossing
[46:35] and when the
[46:37] slow ones crossed and the other
[46:39] but then they've all crossed
[46:42] and it's still held up
[46:44] he said I'll bring in these rocks
[46:47] and other people weren't God but he said
[46:49] just put them where their feet were
[46:52] that held God all that that's beautiful
[46:55] that's beautiful
[46:58] and they come out
[47:00] the rocks will still be there you know
[47:02] the Bible says that those rocks
[47:04] are still there till this day
[47:07] now God made that Memorial so when
[47:10] you're out farming and fishing you're
[47:12] going by the Jordans and you see a whole
[47:14] bunch of rocks
[47:16] your kids go whoa
[47:18] I wonder why those are there
[47:20] you say oh boys
[47:24] see you're getting your kids in the
[47:25] spirit
[47:27] say whoa how was the time in my day when
[47:30] I was young
[47:32] God did an amazing thing
[47:36] and how your kids received God
[47:39] is how you
[47:42] get them in this bed our parents get
[47:44] them in the spirit how the ministry gets
[47:46] them in the spirit do you want don't I I
[47:49] know God's got predestination I know all
[47:51] that I know you can claim your kids and
[47:52] all that but you can paint the same
[47:55] picture that you're serving God
[47:59] wow
[48:02] are you getting paid like wow
[48:10] and your kids
[48:12] see they know the truth see I say adults
[48:15] will believe lies and we you know you
[48:18] know
[48:19] but they see through all that garbage
[48:25] they can see they live with you they see
[48:28] your hinder side
[48:30] and they see your excitement
[48:33] to God
[48:35] you see you're except and you know what
[48:38] as good as and believe me they're good I
[48:40] I've heard I was listening to them
[48:43] yesterday and this week you know
[48:45] but as good as the stories are of our
[48:48] prophet
[48:49] and they're good
[48:50] and they're real
[48:53] and we testify in front of our kids that
[48:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[48:57] forever and there's not one Speck of
[48:58] difference
[48:59] and all that was in Christ he poured
[49:01] into his pride
[49:03] and you don't tell your kids know today
[49:05] stories
[49:06] with excitement
[49:08] of what God's done in your life it makes
[49:10] it now watch this hang on it makes it a
[49:13] dead letter
[49:14] a dead letter to your kids
[49:20] man
[49:21] no matter how amazing your kids are
[49:26] it is unbelievable how fast we disc
[49:29] communicate with history
[49:35] you know if you forget history they say
[49:36] people say it would have repeats itself
[49:38] that's why it repeats itself all that
[49:40] it's repeating itself right now
[49:46] but so is it in the natural in the
[49:49] spiritual
[49:52] from that if we don't keep this Vision
[49:56] alive the the words of Prophecy the
[50:00] Bible
[50:00] the division of the people perish
[50:04] now that goes for your kids
[50:08] they have to have a division
[50:10] and so you know you know you you can't
[50:12] brag on God too much maybe we'll read
[50:14] the scripture just uh just to lay a
[50:17] foundation just I know I kind of told
[50:19] you by
[50:21] you know God had gave Joshua the land
[50:23] and the children of Israel and he
[50:24] commanded them to go over and he sent
[50:26] spies over and you know it was uh talks
[50:30] about you know that God completely give
[50:32] it to him and the uh
[50:34] uh you know they'd cross during the
[50:35] Harvest Time which was it was right at
[50:37] the brim and not let's just go to Joshua
[50:39] 4-1 and read a few scriptures here just
[50:42] and again deposited all the people we've
[50:45] cleaned Passover Jordan a large spank
[50:47] unto Joshua saying take the 12 men out
[50:49] of the people and of every tribe of the
[50:51] man and I kept and command them saying
[50:54] take hints in the midst of the Jordan
[50:56] out to the place where the priest feet
[50:58] stood firm
[51:01] and place and the 12 Stones which thou
[51:04] has carried over with you and leave them
[51:07] in a lodging place where ye shall Lodge
[51:09] that night and Joshua called the 12 men
[51:12] whom they had prepared for the children
[51:14] of Israel out of every tribe
[51:16] every man and Joshua said unto them pass
[51:18] over before the Ark of the Lord your God
[51:21] unto the midst of the Jordan and take ye
[51:22] up every man you a stone onto a short
[51:25] Soldier according to the number of the
[51:29] tribes and the children of Israel
[51:31] and here we read this scripture already
[51:33] but this and I'm going to read you two
[51:35] other scriptures in the Bible that this
[51:37] may be a sign among you that when your
[51:40] children ask
[51:42] their fathers in the time to come saying
[51:45] what Venus
[51:46] thou
[51:48] this Stone then you shall answer them
[51:50] and say the Waters of the Jordan were
[51:51] cut off at the Ark of the Covenant of
[51:53] the Lord when it passed over the Jordan
[51:55] and the waters
[51:57] and these Stones shall be a memorial
[52:00] to the children of Israel
[52:02] forever and the children of Israel did
[52:05] so as Joshua commanded them and took the
[52:06] 12 Stones Out of the midst of Jordan the
[52:08] Lord spacons Joshua according to the
[52:10] number of the tribes the children of
[52:12] Israel and They carried them over with
[52:13] them to the place where they lodged and
[52:15] laid them down there and Joshua set up
[52:18] the 12 Stones
[52:20] in the midst of the Jordan in the place
[52:23] where the feet of the priest
[52:25] had beared the arkans stood
[52:28] and they are there
[52:32] until this very day
[52:35] Hallelujah
[52:37] you know the prophet said there's
[52:39] another
[52:40] Memorial
[52:42] Bible
[52:44] but it's a very sad Memorial
[52:48] it's the time when God reached out in
[52:50] grace and mercy with two angels and went
[52:53] to Sodom and Gomorrah
[52:55] for lot and his family
[52:59] and all they could talk about was
[53:02] the social society and the politics of
[53:05] Sodom and Gomorrah and the wealth and
[53:08] Sodom and Gomorrah and how great it was
[53:10] and you know their new job and their new
[53:13] car and their knew this and when the
[53:16] angel came the Bible says when the
[53:17] Angels Came the Bible says the angel
[53:19] said that they so loved Sodom and
[53:22] Gomorrah now of course I know they were
[53:24] a type of the make-believers that the
[53:26] Angels actually took their arms and
[53:28] removed them restrained them the Bible
[53:31] says remove them
[53:33] and even though the angel did that which
[53:36] was Amazing Grace
[53:38] Amazing Grace
[53:41] lot's wife's heart
[53:45] was still in the world
[53:48] and she knew it was truth
[53:52] but she couldn't give up her love
[53:56] and God turned her into a pillar of salt
[53:58] as a memorial
[54:01] amen of somebody
[54:04] the disobeyed god let's turn to
[54:07] Deuteronomy
[54:09] Deuteronomy 6 and 7 and we'll see some
[54:12] Old Testament scriptures where it says
[54:15] to do this on our way you know you know
[54:18] and we're going to read some quotes of
[54:21] the prophet and things that he ran to
[54:23] amen
[54:28] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[54:30] unto thy children and shall tell them
[54:33] when thou sitst in the house
[54:36] and when thou walk is in thy way
[54:39] and when thou lieth down
[54:42] and when thou rise up now that don't
[54:46] leave a light out
[54:49] you want to talk a lot about sports or
[54:52] Hollywood
[54:53] if you were only talking about Jesus
[54:56] all these times
[54:59] and they thou shall bind them for a sign
[55:03] unto thy hand and thou shalt be as a
[55:07] frontless before thine eyes and thou
[55:10] shall write them upon the post of thy
[55:13] house
[55:15] and on thy Gates
[55:17] and then just drop down to verse 12 and
[55:19] it says and then beware lest I'll forget
[55:22] the Lord
[55:24] which brought thee out of the land of
[55:26] Egypt to the house
[55:29] of bondage now now that's type in
[55:32] physical
[55:34] but we have a spiritual testimony the
[55:36] exact same
[55:37] God brought you out of the house of
[55:40] Egypt and bondage out of the world and
[55:43] give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:45] and give you the Revelation and the eyes
[55:47] and the skills off your eyes to see the
[55:49] truth for your day that a a prophet
[55:52] brought and revealed the seals which was
[55:54] the whole mysteries of God
[55:58] that was sealed up
[55:59] amen that's amazing that was it that's
[56:02] the second scripture
[56:04] where it talks about teaching your
[56:06] children
[56:07] I wonder sometimes if our kids are born
[56:10] in churches because
[56:12] we don't get them in the spirit and
[56:14] that's Ministry too and parents we don't
[56:17] get them in the experiment of the
[56:18] excitement
[56:20] of the hour
[56:22] you know we're living in the greatest
[56:24] day an hour you could possibly live in
[56:27] you should talk to your kids about how
[56:29] amazing it's going to be to be here
[56:32] when Christ comes back
[56:34] it takes us in a rap battle
[56:36] you know if you if you follow the signs
[56:39] of the times cement this weekend I
[56:41] believe it was Wednesday that Russia and
[56:43] Turkey went to Iran which Iran was the
[56:46] ones that had a a covenant or a while
[56:48] Covenant a signed thing with the West
[56:50] that they couldn't make atomic
[56:52] Warheads amen and they were the ones
[56:55] that were always breaking it but I want
[56:57] to tell you something now they're
[56:58] they're making friendships with the
[57:00] country that has the most Atomic
[57:02] Warheads in the world
[57:04] Russia has more Atomic Warheads than
[57:05] every country in the world combined
[57:08] they have almost twice as many as the
[57:10] states
[57:12] uh
[57:13] and here there was a picture I don't
[57:15] know if any of you seen it probably some
[57:17] of you said but there was a picture on
[57:18] Wednesday where the Iran leader was
[57:20] standing in the middle and they took
[57:22] their hands in their fists and they put
[57:23] them up like this and the Russian leader
[57:25] was on one side
[57:26] and the turkey leader was on the other
[57:28] side now that is completely Ezekiel 38
[57:31] and 39.
[57:33] they've completely coming to pass in our
[57:35] day
[57:36] like
[57:37] I mean you're you're Stone blind if you
[57:39] don't see that
[57:43] and you know
[57:45] when those scriptures come to pass they
[57:47] tell them we're not even here
[57:53] whoa
[57:55] the greatest event in history
[57:59] will be the Rapture and a body change
[58:02] and the world won't even know it took
[58:05] place
[58:07] they'll say well I thought Elias must
[58:10] come first
[58:11] Jesus will say but he already came
[58:14] and you didn't know you know I was
[58:16] reading quotes today and I don't have
[58:18] them in front of me don't matter but he
[58:19] said the the problem with the church is
[58:22] they're looking for something and they
[58:24] don't recognize the presence of him
[58:27] right in their midst
[58:33] no
[58:35] God help us to recognize God
[58:39] today
[58:42] amen
[58:44] Hallelujah you know
[58:47] is you know what our Prophet said Is is
[58:50] true and as great as it is to look back
[58:52] at history
[58:53] there's no excuse for you to take God
[58:55] out of the picture
[58:57] in your day
[58:58] no excuse it was real then
[59:02] but if it was real then and it's going
[59:03] to be real what happened today
[59:05] it's just as real today it's because we
[59:08] become
[59:10] lukewarm or or
[59:12] fell asleep we've been wooed asleep like
[59:15] a frog where they turned the water up
[59:16] the temperature up really slow
[59:21] man we don't want to be that
[59:23] opposed Jesus to shake ourselves
[59:25] Deuteronomy 11 and 19. here's another
[59:28] example of the Lord telling us to teach
[59:32] our children and ye shall teach your
[59:34] children speaking unto them when thou
[59:36] sit us down in the house and when thy
[59:37] walk is on the way and when thou lies
[59:39] down and when thou raises up
[59:42] and thou shall write them upon the
[59:44] doorposts of thine house
[59:46] and upon thy Gates
[59:49] amen God expects us
[59:52] to make this gospel
[59:55] to our kids it's our duty to get its
[59:59] parents Duty and Ministry duty to get
[1:00:02] the kids in the spirit
[1:00:04] of the Gospel
[1:00:07] train up a child in the way you'll go
[1:00:08] that when he's old he won't depart from
[1:00:10] it
[1:00:12] amen hallelujah you know in Philippians
[1:00:15] 4 8 it says finally my brethren
[1:00:17] whatsoever things are true and
[1:00:18] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:00:20] things are just and whatsoever things
[1:00:22] are pure and whatsoever things are
[1:00:24] lovely and whatsoever things are of good
[1:00:26] report if there be any virtue and if
[1:00:28] there be any praise
[1:00:30] think on these things there ain't
[1:00:32] nothing that you can think on more
[1:00:34] perfect and beautiful and lovely and
[1:00:36] pure
[1:00:37] and virtuous
[1:00:39] than Christ Jesus
[1:00:41] amen let's just look into some of the
[1:00:43] things that our Prophet said in some
[1:00:45] some scriptures here and and we'll go
[1:00:47] through this quickly you know he said
[1:00:49] any questions and answers in 64. he said
[1:00:53] we need to try to help each other
[1:00:55] he said let me just read he said try
[1:00:58] each one of you children to help Papa
[1:01:01] and help Mama and Mama you and Papa you
[1:01:04] try to help your children and don't
[1:01:07] never let it gloomy see you know the
[1:01:09] world's falling apart that's all we talk
[1:01:11] about
[1:01:14] I mean I'm preaching to myself more than
[1:01:16] probably not even to you guys
[1:01:19] but that that gloominess should become
[1:01:21] excitement saying oh my God I think
[1:01:24] God's just ready
[1:01:25] open the door
[1:01:28] we see everything falling apart and we
[1:01:31] should say oh praise it has to happen
[1:01:35] don't don't emphasize on the negative
[1:01:38] just turn that completely depositive he
[1:01:40] said don't never be gloomy on have a
[1:01:43] non-believing spirit get around you
[1:01:46] he said we're Christians you're born of
[1:01:48] the spirit of God and he said you are
[1:01:49] the salt of the earth and you have the
[1:01:52] God's right God's given you have the
[1:01:54] god-given right
[1:01:57] and if there be any praise or virtue
[1:02:00] he said don't think
[1:02:02] on wrong things
[1:02:04] and then how do you see the glass of
[1:02:07] water is it half full or half empty same
[1:02:11] situation
[1:02:13] spiritually it's half full well it's
[1:02:15] half empty
[1:02:16] it's just a negative Slice on it well no
[1:02:20] God's God's purpose will never be
[1:02:23] defeated Satan will never touch God's
[1:02:25] purpose Satan will never touch God's
[1:02:27] bride yes there will be a great Fallen
[1:02:28] away but there
[1:02:31] God's bride won't fall away
[1:02:33] it's impossible
[1:02:35] man
[1:02:38] Hallelujah
[1:02:40] you see the memorial today he said here
[1:02:43] here he said this is in the same Italian
[1:02:46] to the same scripture talking about
[1:02:47] Joshua and how they put up the memorial
[1:02:50] and he said he said he said
[1:02:53] God is coming and the word of God has
[1:02:55] taken the land uh that God has given me
[1:02:58] remember God gave them the land down in
[1:02:59] Egypt said the land's yours but every
[1:03:02] bit of it now the people today are
[1:03:04] expecting God to reach down and take
[1:03:06] them by the neck and say yes that's
[1:03:08] right you bring me out God you clean me
[1:03:11] off you healed me God and I'll believe
[1:03:13] in you God that's all the prophet says
[1:03:15] he said God don't do his business
[1:03:18] that way he's given you the promises but
[1:03:21] you've got to fight for every inch of
[1:03:24] The Possession
[1:03:25] amen how do you want to look at the
[1:03:27] situation around you
[1:03:30] is just how God you're the anointing
[1:03:34] will be on you man if you're in the
[1:03:36] spirit of the world you're going to say
[1:03:37] oh
[1:03:40] but if you're in the spirit of Christ
[1:03:41] and say I can see the dollar Fallen I
[1:03:44] can see economies falling I could see
[1:03:45] wars and rumors or Wars that I could see
[1:03:47] the great falling away in the church and
[1:03:50] I could see but I can also see
[1:03:53] that my redeemer liveth and is ready to
[1:03:56] come and redeem his bride before before
[1:03:59] the great Dreadful day of the Lord where
[1:04:01] where Russia and Gog and Magog will come
[1:04:04] down and take over Israel
[1:04:06] we won't be here
[1:04:09] Hallelujah
[1:04:10] thank you Lord
[1:04:13] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:04:15] amazing he's talking about here in this
[1:04:18] quote time-tested memorials about how
[1:04:21] God delivered them
[1:04:23] man we already talked about that here's
[1:04:26] here's a quote here where the Prophet
[1:04:27] talked about he's talking about you know
[1:04:29] everybody wants to brag on somebody and
[1:04:32] and uh you know we we like to be
[1:04:35] breakdown ourself but he said you could
[1:04:37] never brag too much
[1:04:39] on Jesus
[1:04:41] if you want to brag on somebody brag on
[1:04:43] Jesus because you know everything we did
[1:04:45] is because he helped us you didn't
[1:04:47] become you didn't become healthy this
[1:04:49] morning because on your own God God give
[1:04:52] you your health you didn't become
[1:04:54] a sustainable or well God give you your
[1:04:58] job God gave their gods it's Gods
[1:05:00] because that's the way God originated
[1:05:03] and you know the the prophet had a woman
[1:05:04] come to him and he said brother Branham
[1:05:06] he said I got a problem with you
[1:05:08] he said you're begging too much on Jesus
[1:05:12] he said I'm begging too much on him he
[1:05:15] said that he said I can't say enough
[1:05:17] about him she said oh he was just a man
[1:05:22] he was just a philosopher and I said he
[1:05:24] was God
[1:05:25] it's who he was now he goes into this he
[1:05:28] even touches on the godhead some and
[1:05:30] it's beautiful we got time to do this
[1:05:33] and she said oh no he said he wasn't
[1:05:35] Divine brother Branham she said
[1:05:38] I can prove he wasn't Divine said I said
[1:05:41] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:05:44] to himself and she said oh he said in a
[1:05:47] manner of his love and so forth he was
[1:05:49] God
[1:05:51] and I said oh no he was Jehovah and the
[1:05:53] people tried to push him around saying
[1:05:55] that he was just a good man an ordinary
[1:05:57] man he was a Divine One
[1:05:59] but God was manifested in the flesh seen
[1:06:02] in angels preached onto
[1:06:04] and received up into heaven sitting at
[1:06:06] the right the father certainly he was
[1:06:09] God
[1:06:10] and he was more than a man he was a God
[1:06:13] man
[1:06:14] he was a man in flesh but he was a God
[1:06:17] in spirit
[1:06:18] now there you get into the the godhead
[1:06:21] some and he goes into that more that's
[1:06:23] what he was God coming down suffering
[1:06:26] Temptation and martyred to take away the
[1:06:29] sins unto himself
[1:06:31] to uh so they weren't passed on to the
[1:06:34] human race and she says I can prove to
[1:06:37] you by the Bible
[1:06:39] if you'll just open up your mind that he
[1:06:42] was only
[1:06:43] a man and brother Brown said
[1:06:45] well if you can prove to me by the Bible
[1:06:48] that he was just the man
[1:06:50] I'll believe it
[1:06:52] she said well when he came down to
[1:06:54] Lazarus grave
[1:06:56] on the road there
[1:06:59] the people were crying around them and
[1:07:01] the Bible says that Jesus wept
[1:07:03] she said that proves
[1:07:06] he was mortal
[1:07:08] the prophet said he said
[1:07:11] he might have cried that's true and on
[1:07:15] his road to meet Lazarus he was a human
[1:07:17] as far as human is concerned in his
[1:07:21] flesh he was a human but his spirit
[1:07:24] he was God
[1:07:26] and I I said he cried that was a man
[1:07:30] crying he was a man when he was crying
[1:07:33] going down to Lazarus grave but when he
[1:07:36] stood there and straightened up a little
[1:07:38] bit his frame
[1:07:40] and said Lazarus come forth
[1:07:43] he said
[1:07:45] now there
[1:07:47] stood Jehovah God
[1:07:49] a man that had been dead for days
[1:07:51] he said that was God speaking through
[1:07:53] there Hallelujah God and his son and God
[1:07:56] was speaking through mortal flesh
[1:07:58] corruption knew its master
[1:08:01] and had to back up believe it saw this
[1:08:04] and then the prophet goes on he said he
[1:08:07] was a man when he went up the mountain
[1:08:09] that night and he came down and looked
[1:08:11] around he was hungry and he seen the fig
[1:08:14] tree
[1:08:15] and it never had no fruit on it
[1:08:19] and God and a man was hungry
[1:08:23] and he said he was hungry and he was a
[1:08:25] man
[1:08:26] and so he took the
[1:08:28] that and he cursed the tree
[1:08:32] he was a man and he was hungry when he
[1:08:34] took the five biscuits and two fishes
[1:08:37] and he fed five thousand
[1:08:39] he said then that was more than a man
[1:08:42] that was God in a man
[1:08:45] he said he was a man when he laid on the
[1:08:47] back of the little boat and ten thousand
[1:08:50] demons said that we'll drown them in the
[1:08:52] water and he said he was tired in his
[1:08:54] spirit because he had been healing
[1:08:57] and preaching all day
[1:09:00] that was totally
[1:09:03] a bad
[1:09:04] but he said when the disciples came to
[1:09:07] wake him up
[1:09:08] and he put his foot on the brow of the
[1:09:10] ship
[1:09:11] and said Peace
[1:09:13] be still
[1:09:15] and the people said even nature
[1:09:19] obeys him
[1:09:21] he said that wasn't a man
[1:09:23] Hallelujah
[1:09:25] ain't that amazing
[1:09:27] Hallelujah
[1:09:29] he said he was a man when he went to
[1:09:31] Calvary
[1:09:33] he said it was a man on Calvary that
[1:09:35] said my God my God why is Thou forsaken
[1:09:37] me he said he died like a man but he
[1:09:40] said on that Easter morning
[1:09:42] when he raised up and broke the seals of
[1:09:44] death hell in the grave
[1:09:46] he said that was more
[1:09:48] than a man
[1:09:51] Hallelujah
[1:09:53] amen
[1:09:54] Hallelujah you know our children many
[1:09:57] times
[1:09:58] all they see
[1:10:00] is bad
[1:10:03] but we need to show them the god
[1:10:06] in the men
[1:10:07] and it's good to brag on God and tell
[1:10:10] them what God's done
[1:10:12] today
[1:10:14] how God's taking care of you today you
[1:10:18] know you could think of just in the
[1:10:19] short history of us being here the
[1:10:22] things that God did that weak men could
[1:10:25] not have done
[1:10:27] those are the things that people can put
[1:10:30] skin on let me tell you a story about
[1:10:31] that see see the kids need to see a god
[1:10:34] with skin on I was talking about this
[1:10:36] you know we went out we were seeing Jim
[1:10:39] and Linda and we were visiting different
[1:10:41] ones and Mike and Kathy and we were
[1:10:43] talking about
[1:10:46] if we weren't here in the Rapture and
[1:10:48] you went by the way the grave and how
[1:10:49] the grave worked and all this thing and
[1:10:51] you know we were talking about our own
[1:10:53] family lineage
[1:10:55] see my grandparents died
[1:10:57] before my dad got married
[1:11:02] so my dad took us to our grandparents
[1:11:05] gravesite
[1:11:07] but it meant very little to us
[1:11:10] because we never met them
[1:11:13] but do you know
[1:11:14] and it's to me I'm showing you this for
[1:11:16] a reason but my great-grandparents
[1:11:21] Johnny you know where they're at
[1:11:24] but they're your great great
[1:11:26] grandparents
[1:11:27] see how come you don't know about that
[1:11:30] you're actually packing their DNA
[1:11:34] but see they're so far removed you don't
[1:11:36] care
[1:11:38] huh
[1:11:39] and that's like the stories
[1:11:42] in the Bible to our kids
[1:11:44] and to the world they became just
[1:11:45] they're so far removed they become on
[1:11:48] reality but when it happens in your
[1:11:50] household then it becomes reality
[1:11:53] you see what I mean so my grant my
[1:11:55] great-grandparents are buried in
[1:11:58] Wallaceburg Cemetery over the river with
[1:12:00] a non-mark grade because they never had
[1:12:01] no money and none of my family ever
[1:12:03] could buy
[1:12:05] a 50 Stone to put to where they are
[1:12:08] and we investigated some and some of the
[1:12:10] family and they said well they're buried
[1:12:11] near this so-and-so Tombstone you'd have
[1:12:13] to go to the gravesite to find out the
[1:12:15] exactly
[1:12:20] that's like telling your kids and
[1:12:22] they're good
[1:12:23] but I just give you three examples
[1:12:26] of where God taught us to tell our kids
[1:12:30] not what happened in Moses time
[1:12:32] he never once said tell them about the
[1:12:34] plagues in Egypt
[1:12:36] he never once told him but tell them how
[1:12:38] you crossed the Red Sea
[1:12:39] he never said don't tell them about the
[1:12:41] cloud and today and the pillar of fire
[1:12:43] at night that kept the Egyptians back
[1:12:45] from Israel he never told them to tell
[1:12:47] them that
[1:12:48] you never told him tell him that
[1:12:51] see I'm not knocking what God did of
[1:12:53] course not that was Jehovah
[1:12:55] but what God did in your life
[1:13:00] today
[1:13:01] you see we take it for granted we see we
[1:13:03] God does as a miracle and we just move
[1:13:05] on and we just don't even
[1:13:07] but God God wants God the only reason
[1:13:10] God did only reason God did that
[1:13:13] for him to get to Glory
[1:13:16] the only reason that God heard in
[1:13:18] Pharaoh's heart
[1:13:20] the only reason
[1:13:22] that he brought Israel with a mighty
[1:13:24] hand and the only reason he's bringing
[1:13:26] you out of this laodicea in Egypt with a
[1:13:29] mighty hand the only reason
[1:13:31] if you survive it'll it'll be God it'll
[1:13:34] be predestination it'll be grace
[1:13:39] and for him to get to Glory
[1:13:41] that's the only reason
[1:13:43] now now let me back then but how could
[1:13:45] he get to Glory
[1:13:49] if we never talked about it
[1:13:56] see the world all knows about David and
[1:13:58] Goliath and the world all knows about
[1:14:00] knowing the ark and
[1:14:05] but they don't know about
[1:14:07] today God
[1:14:10] man
[1:14:12] it's good to brag on God
[1:14:14] amen break on God today what has God
[1:14:17] done today
[1:14:18] her life
[1:14:19] amen you see how God said show your
[1:14:22] children when they ask you what God did
[1:14:24] right now today
[1:14:26] in Joshua's life he didn't go back to
[1:14:28] Moses
[1:14:31] and that was great
[1:14:33] but he wanted to have a today God
[1:14:37] because God's God's not age he's not old
[1:14:40] he's exactly the same
[1:14:42] rate exactly what happened in the
[1:14:45] prophets Ministry could happen here
[1:14:46] today exactly
[1:14:48] now I I do that was focused on a
[1:14:51] Ministry of a prophet so it was more now
[1:14:54] it's that same Ministry is in his body
[1:14:57] those same things are happening in the
[1:14:59] body
[1:15:00] just this week Pastor Sandy from from
[1:15:03] Uganda was in a major car accident the
[1:15:06] vehicle probably should have been dead
[1:15:08] he was in the front vehicle in front of
[1:15:10] the vehicle he was going to minister
[1:15:13] God completely delivered him without
[1:15:16] nothing more than a few aches and pains
[1:15:18] and the Very place he was going to
[1:15:20] minister for the weekend
[1:15:22] it never stopped them from ministering
[1:15:28] but see if I didn't tell you about that
[1:15:29] you wouldn't know about that but like
[1:15:31] how many times have you told the story
[1:15:33] how me and brother Jim were in a major
[1:15:35] car accident T-boned by a semi and the
[1:15:38] semi-accident guy actually ran away
[1:15:40] knowing that we would be dead
[1:15:42] but how many times have you mentioned
[1:15:44] that to your kids
[1:15:46] Grandpa could be buried in Uganda
[1:15:52] we don't mention that because we don't
[1:15:55] see about well well it just it turned
[1:15:58] out good
[1:16:00] they're no good no that was God
[1:16:03] no that was God the the the Demons of
[1:16:06] hell were trying to attack all the men
[1:16:08] there was four or five ministers in the
[1:16:09] van at the same time
[1:16:12] we're going to minister say Miss Pastor
[1:16:14] Sandy going to minister and the Demons
[1:16:16] of how we're trying to stop that
[1:16:22] and so God even though what God when
[1:16:25] Satan meant for evil to kill us
[1:16:28] the trucking company paid me and brother
[1:16:30] Jim more than our air flight
[1:16:32] there
[1:16:37] three thousand US dollars to give us
[1:16:39] cash I believe it was three thousand
[1:16:44] so God just paid for it yeah
[1:16:47] ain't that amazing those are the stories
[1:16:50] that your kids need to hear they need to
[1:16:52] hear the stories of Jeff Van Damme when
[1:16:54] they couldn't have babies for years
[1:16:56] when they come up and pray God healed
[1:16:59] them completely
[1:17:00] they got a house full of boys more on
[1:17:02] the way
[1:17:04] did you say oh that was no no that was
[1:17:07] God
[1:17:09] that was God
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:13] I was like Abraham and Sarah they were
[1:17:15] together for years and when God healed
[1:17:17] them not only did they have Isaac but
[1:17:19] when Sarah died Abraham married I think
[1:17:21] two more times and had multiple kids
[1:17:23] multiple kids
[1:17:29] when God healed him he really healed
[1:17:31] them
[1:17:33] man
[1:17:35] but we can make these persons sister
[1:17:37] Patricia never took breathalyzers for
[1:17:39] years
[1:17:41] took him all the time prescription
[1:17:42] breathalyzers
[1:17:44] for her lungs amazing Julie when she had
[1:17:48] the back pinched nerve we literally
[1:17:51] thought it was the time when we would
[1:17:53] bury her Jared would be a widow and the
[1:17:54] kids orphans
[1:17:59] for some reason we don't talk about
[1:18:00] these stories
[1:18:02] we don't talk about the stories when we
[1:18:04] almost had a car accident God just woo
[1:18:11] man
[1:18:13] like God tells us
[1:18:16] in his word
[1:18:18] for to tell our kids those Stars
[1:18:21] and you can tell those stories
[1:18:24] in a way of excitement to your kids that
[1:18:27] it'll make God a lot you know like the
[1:18:29] boy that said you know he was screaming
[1:18:31] in the well because it was dark
[1:18:34] or the little girl and he told his
[1:18:36] sister he said listen there's you know
[1:18:37] everything's all right we're with
[1:18:41] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:18:43] light
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:46] see they needed to see a got your kids
[1:18:49] need to see a god with skin
[1:18:52] and if you make it personal
[1:18:54] you tell your grandkids that Grandpa
[1:18:56] could be buried in Uganda we'd never be
[1:18:58] able to go to his gravesite see that
[1:18:59] makes it parse you know
[1:19:02] you're not bragging on the person that
[1:19:04] was involved your break is completely
[1:19:05] God
[1:19:08] think of the time that Esther was
[1:19:10] winning you know with the Manure
[1:19:11] Spreader and it came out of the ditch on
[1:19:13] two wheels and it just laid down and
[1:19:15] just drive away and boom it's perfect
[1:19:20] you think of all the times you almost
[1:19:22] pulled out in front of the vehicle and
[1:19:23] just at the last second God looked and
[1:19:25] you know you know those gray cards gray
[1:19:26] blue cards that blend right in with the
[1:19:28] payment and more than once I've gone to
[1:19:30] go out and I looked the second time it
[1:19:31] was right there and I was like oh thank
[1:19:34] you Lord
[1:19:35] but we don't tell nobody
[1:19:37] you don't tell nobody
[1:19:39] but the Bible tells you diligently it
[1:19:42] actually don't just tell you to tell
[1:19:44] them
[1:19:45] it says to tell them when you raise up
[1:19:48] when you walk
[1:19:50] when your journey and then when you lay
[1:19:53] back down
[1:19:57] you wouldn't talk about nothing else
[1:20:01] wow
[1:20:02] how we look for a church and actually
[1:20:04] bid on some and thought we were going to
[1:20:07] rent some really cheap and and and God
[1:20:09] slammed all the doors and we would have
[1:20:11] never ever ever you know be careful of
[1:20:14] the house firm you say never
[1:20:16] God could make you eat those words
[1:20:19] I promise they I I thought we'd be like
[1:20:22] rednecks out in the bush somewhere and
[1:20:23] we would never ever come this way ever
[1:20:26] I remember when we came to look at the
[1:20:28] church the last words Jared said to me
[1:20:31] when I went out the language I said dad
[1:20:32] I thought you said we would never go
[1:20:34] that way high school now would never
[1:20:36] never never oh
[1:20:41] wow
[1:20:43] God almost escaped to us
[1:20:46] Matt
[1:20:47] and then God's been with us
[1:20:49] amen people have grown to bless us and
[1:20:53] years have went by
[1:20:54] you're you're raising family that's God
[1:20:57] that's not that's God
[1:21:02] man God help us
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] it's all right to brag on God
[1:21:08] we need to make him a personal God a
[1:21:11] today God
[1:21:12] today God
[1:21:14] amen God help God help me
[1:21:17] God help us all I got help us parents to
[1:21:21] make you know devotions with your kids
[1:21:26] that's that's the most it's more
[1:21:28] important than breathing
[1:21:30] but you can make devotions a nightmare
[1:21:34] and just board them straight bored them
[1:21:36] that's not what God's about God's not
[1:21:38] about boredom
[1:21:39] it's all in your approach
[1:21:43] it's all in your it's completely all in
[1:21:45] your approach you can make it where the
[1:21:47] kids would be sitting on their edge of
[1:21:48] their seat just with like oh
[1:21:55] or you can make them fall asleep
[1:21:57] all in your approach the same God but
[1:22:00] all in your approach
[1:22:02] and God help us
[1:22:04] to be in the spirit
[1:22:06] when we talk to our kids
[1:22:08] God help us to see these memorials and
[1:22:11] show them you know how it is when we
[1:22:13] obey God and it looks ridiculous like
[1:22:16] crossing the Jordan when it's in its
[1:22:17] Brim
[1:22:18] or when we leave Sodom Gomorrah and we
[1:22:20] disobey God
[1:22:22] and God leaves Memorials of what you'll
[1:22:25] be
[1:22:26] or what you'll be
[1:22:28] and both those are memorials in the
[1:22:29] Bible says are there till this day
[1:22:34] God help us God help us listen
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:48] Hallelujah
[1:22:50] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:22:53] time tested memorials
[1:22:56] what God sat in place
[1:23:00] so the children
[1:23:01] would desire to know
[1:23:04] and the parents would tell them
[1:23:07] amen of the power
[1:23:09] and the Magnificent
[1:23:11] of the one and only
[1:23:13] fantastic true God
[1:23:16] and how real he is and how concerned he
[1:23:20] is
[1:23:21] in your life in your kids life your kids
[1:23:24] getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:26] and and preparing us for a Rapture that
[1:23:30] will probably happen literally
[1:23:33] momentarily however that will be
[1:23:36] you know our Prophet thought that he
[1:23:38] would not go by the grave
[1:23:41] he didn't believe he would be
[1:23:43] now if you believe that prophet
[1:23:46] and he didn't believe he would go by the
[1:23:48] grave
[1:23:49] and you're offended that I say we're
[1:23:51] going to go in a Rapture momentarily
[1:23:54] then you don't believe the prophet
[1:23:55] because he thought he would go
[1:23:56] momentarily before he died of old age
[1:23:59] and if he believed he was going to go
[1:24:01] and he's been gone first
[1:24:04] how much uh-huh now laodicea is the
[1:24:07] shortest Church age
[1:24:10] the Bible says that the Bible says that
[1:24:12] our Prophet said that said unless he
[1:24:15] shortened the days would there be any
[1:24:16] saved
[1:24:17] and it's becoming Peril it's becoming
[1:24:20] parallel
[1:24:21] but the Ephesians Church age
[1:24:24] the same point
[1:24:27] you're going home everything
[1:24:29] there is nothing
[1:24:31] that don't point to a rapture
[1:24:34] amen show your kids the excitement
[1:24:38] of a Rapture it's a real place
[1:24:41] it's a real place with no heartache and
[1:24:44] no pain and no suffering
[1:24:47] oh man you can't do you know the body
[1:24:49] you cannot even comprehend what God the
[1:24:53] Bible says that what God has in store
[1:24:56] for your children in heaven you can't
[1:24:59] you can't you always said well I'm
[1:25:00] brilliant I went to school for many
[1:25:02] years he said you can't even comprehend
[1:25:04] it's not in the ability of men
[1:25:08] and we never talked about it
[1:25:10] and we never talked about it
[1:25:13] oh God help me
[1:25:16] God help me God help me to just imagine
[1:25:19] what he has in store with me paint a
[1:25:22] picture for your children what heaven
[1:25:24] will be like the blitz that heaven will
[1:25:26] be like
[1:25:27] and it you're going to be off
[1:25:29] because the Bible says you can't imagine
[1:25:31] but you'll be
[1:25:33] you'll be going the right way
[1:25:35] Hallelujah
[1:25:37] Hallelujah
[1:25:39] thank you Lord Jesus

[1:26:22] my Lord is coming
[1:26:26] Hallelujah May return

[1:27:20] just any
[1:27:22] day now
[1:27:24] his face I see hallelujah it's a weird
[1:27:28] place out I just want to mention
[1:27:30] something we'd preached on last week and
[1:27:32] just
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:36] you know it was it had to be God but I
[1:27:40] feel it's okay to share it with you now
[1:27:42] one of my main scriptures and one of my
[1:27:45] main ideas I'd failed to mention but you
[1:27:48] know in the Bible King husiah
[1:27:50] was who God told to get his house in
[1:27:53] order that he was going to die
[1:27:55] the prophet came by and told him that
[1:27:57] and he was the man that turned his head
[1:27:59] to the wall
[1:28:00] and cried and asked God because he had
[1:28:03] been a Godly Man and God gave him 15
[1:28:06] more years
[1:28:08] huh
[1:28:09] the very next chapter
[1:28:13] Kings from other lands heard of the
[1:28:16] miracle in his life
[1:28:18] and heard he had been sick and came to
[1:28:20] see the king
[1:28:22] you you can not make the parallel or you
[1:28:25] can it's your choice
[1:28:27] the king
[1:28:28] Hezekiah showed these other kings
[1:28:31] everything he had
[1:28:34] on Facebook
[1:28:36] everything
[1:28:38] and when they left the prophet came back
[1:28:40] by the Hezekiah and they said who were
[1:28:44] those people they said well they
[1:28:45] traveled from far away land or King's
[1:28:47] not he said what did you show them on
[1:28:48] Facebook
[1:28:50] he said well oh I showed them everything
[1:28:54] showed them everything in my bedroom and
[1:28:57] my private Chambers and all my money and
[1:28:59] banking I showed them everything
[1:29:02] the prophet said thus say it's the Lord
[1:29:03] God will take it all from you
[1:29:06] but he won't do it
[1:29:08] until you die and your kids will be
[1:29:11] eunuchs
[1:29:12] and they'll have no seat
[1:29:16] you read that
[1:29:18] Isaiah 39.
[1:29:22] he never did nothing wrong
[1:29:24] never does say that he did anything
[1:29:26] wrong
[1:29:28] never does say that
[1:29:30] it showed everything on
[1:29:34] to a far away land
[1:29:37] Isaiah 39.
[1:29:40] the prophet came to him
[1:29:42] said because you showed them everything
[1:29:47] God's going to take everything from you
[1:29:50] and your family will be zero
[1:29:53] he just won't do it until you're gone
[1:29:56] and he'll do it to your kids
[1:29:58] may God help us amen this is this is
[1:30:01] this truth it's real
[1:30:03] it's real it's real
[1:30:05] it's very real
[1:30:07] that's nothing to be
[1:30:10] Hallelujah Amy just to me
[1:30:13] it's just amazing this this this this is
[1:30:16] not a religion this ain't a story this
[1:30:18] is

[1:30:33] to your family to your kids
