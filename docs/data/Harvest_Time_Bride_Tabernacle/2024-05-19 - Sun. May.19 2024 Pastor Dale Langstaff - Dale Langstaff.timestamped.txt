[34:43] family he don't just have a Ministry he
[34:45] has a family don't forget that amen the
[34:48] family
[34:50] is if you didn't have a family you
[34:53] wouldn't need a
[34:54] Ministry so there may be more important
[34:56] than the ministry most people don't
[34:58] realize that but I'm perfectly okay with
[35:01] just being part of the family amen amen
[35:05] God help us and you know uh uh I I want
[35:10] to share this
[35:11] before read my
[35:15] scriptures but things like that is how
[35:17] Satan comes into the body and separates
[35:21] God's kingdom and you know before we go
[35:23] home in a rapture we have to recognize
[35:25] Satan I got a bit of an echo
[35:28] we have to recognize Satan you know it's
[35:31] not each other it's just Satan that's
[35:34] trying to make you think something that
[35:36] never even happened or you know what I
[35:37] mean and and I I mentioned some of that
[35:39] Wednesday night but many of you weren't
[35:41] here you know if God can't attack the
[35:44] person then he'll attack the the wife
[35:46] and if you can't attack the wife then
[35:47] he'll attack the kids and and and then
[35:49] you say well you know so and so said and
[35:51] did and my goodness me and brother Tim
[35:54] are as different as the night is from
[35:56] the day
[35:58] but he's my son he's not my son-in-law
[36:02] we were actually looking for his baby
[36:03] pictures when him and Vicki got married
[36:05] and wondered why we didn't have his baby
[36:07] pictures that's just literally how much
[36:09] we claim him but to think that one
[36:12] person can affect another body I mean
[36:15] that's God's job amen and but that's how
[36:18] Satan comes in he says oh well you know
[36:20] they're they're not you know no none of
[36:22] us are perfect amen God's Ministry was
[36:25] never perfect except himself self amen
[36:28] and anyway that's free but uh also just
[36:32] uh junior could have been here he just
[36:35] didn't have a ride and we remember Jim
[36:37] and Linda and chadam just uh if
[36:39] anybody's that way I mean they'll sure
[36:41] love you to stop in and see them um it's
[36:44] just a sad situation for them really
[36:47] being locked in their house but we're
[36:49] actually by God's grace going to uh try
[36:52] to get Junior Esther's van and uh and
[36:56] that will help him him to be a part of
[36:59] us and uh amen so let's turn to Second
[37:03] Peter uh 1:10 and 11
[37:06] and I uh uh I was going to say this for
[37:10] anybody that uh you know uh I'm I'm
[37:13] going to preach to myself this morning
[37:15] and and you know something I want to put
[37:17] a disclaimer out you know the Bible says
[37:19] and brother Brown taught us that a
[37:20] pastor is a noox anointing you know when
[37:23] we went and had fellowship with the
[37:24] other mean ministers you know they were
[37:27] talking about that you know and there's
[37:28] nothing very glamorous about an
[37:31] ox like nobody goes to the fair to see
[37:34] an
[37:35] ox I mean they'll go see the cheetah and
[37:38] the lions and you know and the Eagles
[37:41] and all that other stuff but the ox
[37:44] there's not a line looking to go see a
[37:45] brute Beast
[37:47] amen but that's just the gift that God
[37:50] placed on a pastor's thing so it's not
[37:53] always glamorous but it gets down to the
[37:56] meat of the road amen
[37:58] amen
[38:00] hallelujah second Peter 10 or 2 Peter
[38:04] 1:10 and
[38:05] 11
[38:08] therefore the rather Brethren give
[38:10] diligent and make your calling and
[38:12] election sure for if you do these things
[38:15] you shall never
[38:19] fall Hallelujah for so an entrance shall
[38:23] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[38:26] the Everlasting and Kingdom of our Lord
[38:28] and Savior Jesus Christ Lord Jesus we
[38:31] pray that you will be add a blessing to
[38:34] your word Lord Jesus and may you come
[38:36] and your sweet Holy Spirit and anointing
[38:39] and feed us your Mana this morning Lord
[38:41] God we pray and we give you all the
[38:43] glory and honor for it amen amen you may
[38:48] have your seats this morning you see
[38:49] this scripture many times and and I
[38:51] looked back on the message Hub and I was
[38:54] comforted to see that the prophet didn't
[38:56] always compare this to Ministry and many
[39:00] times we would think of this as a
[39:01] minister making his calling an election
[39:04] sure amen we're welcome and but we see
[39:09] over in Romans and maybe we'll just turn
[39:11] there Romans 8:30 we'll see that this
[39:14] scripture applies to everybody this
[39:17] morning amen everybody completely and
[39:20] remember that this scripture says that
[39:22] if you do these things ye shall never
[39:25] fall the our Prophet said that you have
[39:27] the right to make a decision you see
[39:31] over here in Romans 8:30 it says
[39:32] moreover whom I predestinated them I
[39:35] have
[39:37] called so they that didn't just apply to
[39:40] the ministry and whom th I have called
[39:42] I've Justified and Those whom I've
[39:44] Justified I've already glorified so we
[39:46] see that we make our calling and
[39:48] election sure because it was Jehovah
[39:51] that elected us and called us and that's
[39:53] a body Ministry not a not a FF Ministry
[39:57] amen and so even though we're in the
[40:00] bride of Christ we are affected by
[40:02] things around us and our Badger skin and
[40:06] the prophet had this message uh
[40:08] connected to this scripture and he said
[40:10] the Rich Young Ruler made the wrong
[40:14] decision and many of the people in our
[40:16] lives or in this world are making the
[40:18] wrong decision and here the prophet said
[40:21] in the in the message he said the Rich
[40:23] Young Ruler became a
[40:25] beggar but it was too late
[40:28] because he was in hell and it was
[40:30] because of the riches of the world the
[40:32] deceitfulness of riches and and all
[40:34] these things of the world that the Rich
[40:37] Young Ruler had gave up his eternal
[40:41] life for
[40:43] eternity and I I say God help us you
[40:46] know I want to preach on my title this
[40:48] morning is no continuing City and we
[40:51] have lots of examples we have Moses we
[40:54] have Abraham and we have uh Solomon
[40:57] and most of these people but you know as
[40:59] you get older in life and your hair
[41:01] becomes white and it hurts when you get
[41:03] out of bed in the morning you start
[41:04] looking at why am I doing what I'm doing
[41:07] and it will make you scratch your head
[41:09] and before we read some some scriptures
[41:12] to connect to this I'm sorry my uh my
[41:16] iPad is my my messages I put them down
[41:19] as they come and so they're scattered
[41:22] just forgive me to
[41:24] uh find them but I I want to show you
[41:26] something and I want to show you some
[41:28] big companies you know you know we all
[41:30] know places that we would have never
[41:32] believed would close we we set our hopes
[41:35] on Eternal or on Earthly things and we
[41:38] say well this will be like this
[41:40] forever and nothing on this Earth is
[41:43] forever Eternal who would believe that
[41:45] Sears would have closed who would
[41:47] believe that hazard's elevator would
[41:49] close when they had like a dozen
[41:50] elevators and I worked for them when me
[41:52] and the way were married and we loaded
[41:55] trains and boats
[41:57] and it's a ghost town amen see how the
[42:00] things you you build your hopes on
[42:02] things and I and I'm not preaching on
[42:04] money this morning and and I know we
[42:07] have to survive and and we live in a
[42:08] cold climate or you'd freeze to death
[42:10] but I was thinking of my
[42:14] daddy and he bought his home farm for
[42:19] $1,200 and they said he would starve to
[42:22] death the neighbors Olivers Oliver
[42:25] Dawson said he would starve to death
[42:27] bought the farm for $1,200 and and I'm
[42:29] going to show you something that blew my
[42:31] mind now that farm today is worth3
[42:34] million but I you know normally when
[42:37] they figure out a farm a property a 100
[42:39] Acre Farm they just look at the
[42:40] buildings they say now the building
[42:41] lot's worth a
[42:43] million and then the Farm's worth
[42:44] whatever it's worth now I'm not talking
[42:46] about money don't don't don't run away
[42:48] on me yet but I figured out the
[42:50] percentage of the world bank and
[42:55] inflation and you're going to be shocked
[42:57] for how little you're working
[43:01] for because I 2 million which the
[43:05] property is actually worth 3 million so
[43:08] it's oneir
[43:09] less it was
[43:13] 0
[43:15] 6% 0 6% so my daddy used to work for $1
[43:21] a day and he got his lunch so he'd go
[43:22] bail for my grandpa and he would get a
[43:24] dollar a day handle a th000 square
[43:26] bailes and he would get a free dinner
[43:28] now do you realize he was making five
[43:32] times five times what you're making
[43:37] today and you're
[43:39] happy and you're chasing your
[43:44] dream you know I look at my grandpa that
[43:47] had the my grandpa on my mom's side had
[43:49] the biggest registered horn Herford herd
[43:52] in Ontario
[43:58] and the farm where they kept them it's
[44:00] as bare as that carpet is on the
[44:03] alleyway and yet if he went to places in
[44:06] public people would almost worship
[44:09] him see spirits don't change you know
[44:12] like that song said we need to build our
[44:14] hopes on things Eternal and not on Who's
[44:17] got what and what's got in this company
[44:19] and all this I want to show you just to
[44:21] lay a a lay a foundation and and I have
[44:24] I have more quotes and we'll ever get
[44:25] through today and and scriptures to just
[44:27] show us you know we were put here for
[44:29] one purpose or two or three purposes to
[44:32] proof to Satan that there'll be a
[44:35] bride to prove to Satan and this second
[44:38] bride will never fall like the first one
[44:42] and that by Amazing Grace that will be
[44:45] there at the end and we were also put
[44:47] here for
[44:48] worship because if we didn't worship Him
[44:53] the stones and the ox and the mountains
[44:55] would God will be worshiped God will be
[44:59] worshiped and you know if we want to
[45:01] make a mistake in any area you should
[45:03] lose your mind worshiping God it don't
[45:06] matter who is leading song it wouldn't
[45:08] matter if it was Matt or Felix or Silas
[45:12] or nobody you shouldn't even need
[45:14] somebody leading songs you know when the
[45:17] preacher teacher it wouldn't matter what
[45:19] how far the notes are off if you just I
[45:21] mean see cuz it's it's not about each
[45:25] other it's your you're literally Comm
[45:28] you're you're you're giving flowers to
[45:30] Jehovah it's like a husband taking roses
[45:33] to his wife and he don't really care
[45:35] what the rest of the world thinks about
[45:36] his flowers or his
[45:39] wife but spiritually seeking you you're
[45:42] like
[45:43] who oh
[45:46] wow
[45:49] uh-huh I wanted to show you the value
[45:53] and you know if you Google stuff like
[45:55] this you will I do one time especially
[45:58] in the winter when uh uh but the the
[46:01] trick of Satan by a world bank and
[46:04] inflation and that's why when you go to
[46:07] Uganda and I would go to Uganda I would
[46:10] never take well you can't even get
[46:11] Uganda money here but you would go to
[46:13] Uganda and I would you could get a
[46:15] million dollars on your visa and the and
[46:17] the thing so I was a millionaire the
[46:18] whole time I was there and I never
[46:20] forget the first time we went into the
[46:21] bank you know and they got machine guns
[46:23] outside as if this is a lot of money
[46:25] they got one on each side of the door
[46:26] and or pump shotguns or whatever and you
[46:29] think like wow this is a big deal you
[46:30] know and and the printer came out of the
[46:33] money and it was about like that the
[46:34] stock and I handed it to Leo and I said
[46:36] are you going to count it he goes that's
[46:39] about
[46:41] right uhhuh it's called a lie of the
[46:45] devil and it's happening to us but you
[46:48] don't believe
[46:49] it I'm hoping you'll believe a little
[46:52] bit
[46:52] more before we leave today do you know
[46:56] that at a third lesson the real value
[46:59] the
[47:00] 06 of 2 million is if you were making
[47:05] $35 an hour it would be equivalent to 2
[47:08] cents an
[47:10] hour and that is figuring one3 less of
[47:13] the value so when my daddy was making a
[47:17] dollar a day and he got a free meal
[47:19] which I would be worth 50 bucks today
[47:21] praise God I mean he was actually making
[47:25] like 5,000 in a
[47:33] day you see because if you figured this
[47:35] for a third
[47:37] less at a $35 an age salary today is
[47:41] actually a penny and a half an
[47:45] hour that is why you're struggling to
[47:48] make a
[47:50] living and I don't want to discourage
[47:53] you and because this message ain't about
[47:55] discouraging you but it's only going to
[47:57] get
[47:57] worse and so we're spinning our tires
[48:00] thinking we're really setting the world
[48:02] on fire and when you get a little bit
[48:04] more white
[48:06] hair you're like you know I look at
[48:09] family and situation you know my brother
[48:11] just just just nicely got everything
[48:15] comfortable and he went out and bought a
[48:16] new car and a new truck and now he has a
[48:19] anism that he could he might not I might
[48:21] never see him again he could blow up
[48:23] today and to fix its open heart surgery
[48:25] the odds of him living
[48:27] uh out of open heart surgeries
[48:30] like a
[48:32] miracle and so here he's looking at all
[48:34] this wealth it make no
[48:37] difference you know my grandpa I told
[48:40] you about what he had and and this ain't
[48:42] I'm just trying to I'm not I'm just
[48:44] trying to reveal the devil is that all
[48:46] right is this all right you know my
[48:48] grandpa's grandkids are on
[48:54] welfare yep
[48:57] it's fine if you leave something to your
[48:58] children but it we're not here for money
[49:00] Earthly wealth amen now just for a
[49:04] clarification for anybody that's
[49:05] wondering why I'm preaching on this this
[49:07] has probably been in my iPad for over a
[49:09] well probably a month and a half I
[49:12] didn't have to do many notes to to
[49:13] preach this morning it's been here
[49:16] forever I had pictures back that Vicki
[49:19] or Amy's going to show and they've been
[49:21] back so far they were scattered through
[49:23] my phone because God was laying on this
[49:25] my heart and I I'm I'm looking at way
[49:27] back when I said I was considering
[49:29] selling a farm I'm like why we do what
[49:31] we
[49:32] do you know to to to break this down now
[49:35] this I I want you to understand that I
[49:37] didn't over evaluate the stuff
[49:41] today but if you were making $400 a day
[49:46] now it's equivalent to 50 years ago 24
[49:52] cents 24 cents you could buy that same
[49:56] Farm 50 years ago for 24 cents per day
[50:01] per
[50:07] day
[50:09] amen wow see our money is actually like
[50:14] that too it's like Uganda that's a
[50:17] million dollars that looks about
[50:21] right because it's worthless but it's
[50:24] came in really slow
[50:28] and we think
[50:31] we're that's right
[50:36] amen that's a hard pill to swallow you
[50:39] know I was looking at places that close
[50:42] you know the school I went to is closed
[50:43] they have horses running in it
[50:46] government schools I'm thinking
[50:49] really nothing lasts forever our Prophet
[50:53] talked about he preached a message on no
[50:55] continuing City and and everything he
[50:57] knew in his life was
[50:59] gone
[51:01] amen we have our priorities mixed
[51:05] up by emphasis you know I mentioned
[51:08] about hazards they used to load they had
[51:10] elevators they loaded trains and boats
[51:12] they could load train and boats at the
[51:13] same time I work for them and loaded
[51:15] trains out of elevators it's a ghost
[51:17] town today you know tville sales Barn I
[51:21] went to many I know I know you don't
[51:23] know these places but they were owned by
[51:25] the Cattle Company from West and they
[51:27] unloaded cattle and sheep and livestock
[51:30] from the train company it's completely a
[51:32] ghost down now it was an Canadian
[51:35] International sail
[51:38] Barn multi-million doll when I was a
[51:41] young boy it took three men to buy it
[51:46] out it's a ghost town quality swine used
[51:49] to buy all the pigs in Ontario and send
[51:52] them out to feed light said he filed for
[51:54] chapter 11 bankruptcy
[51:56] yeah people that you would have looked
[51:58] like if you would have worked for
[52:00] them I worked in the
[52:03] doctors
[52:07] multibillion dollar
[52:09] companies God help us God helped me to
[52:14] realize you know Hitler when he did it
[52:16] Hitler was convinced that he would have
[52:19] the Thousand-Year reign of the German
[52:22] Empire that's actually the Millennium he
[52:25] was turned it into a nurse Earthly
[52:26] Kingdom what God's made for a spiritual
[52:29] income Kingdom amen see how see how it's
[52:33] so easy because we're Tabernacle in
[52:35] flesh amen and we need to really check
[52:39] our Prophet said that the Rich Young
[52:41] Ruler made the wrong decision and
[52:44] because he made the wrong decision he
[52:46] became a
[52:48] bagger a
[52:50] bagger
[52:51] that's
[52:53] amen it's fine if you have something in
[52:56] you have to have enough to stay warm and
[52:59] and you know uh you know the balance of
[53:01] this is if you can't feed your family
[53:03] you're worse than an
[53:05] Infidel but we don't have that
[53:09] problem Amen in our country in Ecclesia
[53:14] uh I'm not even sure I'm saying that
[53:15] right
[53:16] ecclesiastics Solomon talked about here
[53:19] and it was amazing I want to read some
[53:21] of the scriptures of Solomon um I'm not
[53:24] even sure I'm saying that right but
[53:27] um and I tell you what I I would
[53:30] challenge you to go home and just if you
[53:32] don't if you can't focus on reading it
[53:34] just hit the auto and listen to some of
[53:37] the chapters of
[53:38] ecclesiastics because here was the
[53:41] wisest man of the world the wisest man
[53:44] that ever lived was Solomon and he had
[53:47] everything at his fingertips and he
[53:50] sought everything at his fingertips and
[53:52] he realized before he
[53:54] died that everything
[53:57] everything everything was vanity there
[54:01] was nothing on Earth Worth Fighting For
[54:05] Nothing on Earth worth fighting
[54:09] for amen let's turn to First
[54:12] ecclesiastics 1 and three and then we're
[54:13] going to jump to 8 and n and I want to
[54:16] just show you some things here I I only
[54:18] wanted a couple scriptures and he had so
[54:20] many key points here it was it was a
[54:23] little overwhelming to me for what ha a
[54:26] man of all his labors while he taketh
[54:28] Under the
[54:33] Sun uh let's start at verse one sorry
[54:40] for the words of the preacher of the son
[54:42] of David the king of Jerusalem vanity of
[54:46] vanities saith the preacher vanities of
[54:49] vanities everything is Vanity what
[54:53] prophet hasth the man
[54:56] what profit hath a man of all his labors
[54:59] taken Under the Sun for one Generation
[55:02] generation passes away and another
[55:05] generation cometh we're going to drop to
[55:06] verse eight and all things are full of
[55:09] Labor and a man cannot utter it his eyes
[55:12] are never satisfied with what is seen
[55:15] nor his ears filled with the hearing
[55:18] we're never happy with our new vehicle
[55:21] amen and the thing that he hath been it
[55:23] is that which shall be
[55:27] and that which is done is that which is
[55:30] shall be done and there is no new thing
[55:34] under the sun now if we drop to verse 10
[55:37] and 11 and there is any is there
[55:40] anything wherefore that may be said see
[55:44] this is new has it not been already of
[55:47] Old Times which was before us there is
[55:52] there is no remembrance of the former
[55:54] things neither shall there be an
[55:56] remembrance of the things that are to
[55:58] come and these things that shall come
[56:01] thereafter verse 14 I'm going to jump to
[56:03] 14 for I have seen all the works that
[56:06] are done under the sun now Solomon he he
[56:09] had the wealth of the
[56:11] world and now watch what his opinion was
[56:14] of it he said I've seen all the things
[56:16] the works that are done under the sun
[56:18] and behold it's all
[56:21] vanity and vexations of spirit and I
[56:25] gave my heart
[56:27] here 17 and I gave my heart to know
[56:29] wisdom and to know Madness and Folly and
[56:32] he and perceived that this also is
[56:35] vexation of spirit now I want to stop
[56:37] there for a minute he ain't just talking
[56:39] about wealth he's talking about
[56:41] knowledge and wisdom he's talking about
[56:43] everything Earthly now I wish I had a
[56:46] little bit more reading ability but you
[56:48] see what he's saying he said this word
[56:50] just passing through our Prophet I'm
[56:52] going to stop here and show you this
[56:54] multiple times to his wife they would
[56:56] say you know if they seen somebody and
[56:58] he' say we're not
[57:00] Americans we're a we're a Heavenly being
[57:03] we're just a passing through no I'm not
[57:06] affected by politics they're of the
[57:07] devil and and no matter who and where
[57:10] and
[57:12] what it's hard to get that through our
[57:14] heads it's hard to get it through my
[57:17] head like I said I'm preaching to myself
[57:19] this morning you can do everything else
[57:22] and something you
[57:23] know Verse 18 for in much wisdom is much
[57:28] grief
[57:30] uh-oh
[57:31] wow I want to know the message better
[57:34] than anybody I don't I want to have the
[57:36] revelation of
[57:37] Christ I you know what I mean like you
[57:40] see what I'm saying there the message is
[57:41] the truth but the message is Christ amen
[57:44] I want to know him in the body and
[57:48] personality of
[57:50] Jehovah forget about knowledge look
[57:53] brother B said I don't know the Bible
[57:55] but I sure know the
[57:56] the other person they wrote
[57:59] it
[58:01] Hallelujah wisdom is much grief and he
[58:03] that increase in knowledge increases in
[58:07] sorrow H that's why you parents you look
[58:10] at your grandkids and you go wow because
[58:13] you lived it you know what decision
[58:16] you're like I wouldn't go
[58:18] there I did that 50 years ago
[58:22] a and they're just plowing right on
[58:25] forward
[58:27] and you go to bed and you toss and you
[58:29] turn and you
[58:31] toss because you
[58:35] know they don't
[58:38] know Amen in Chapter 2 in verse
[58:42] 11 still carrying on this is a long talk
[58:45] where Samuel's Samuel is disheart he
[58:47] said then when you look at all the works
[58:50] that my hands has wrought now he did a
[58:52] couple good
[58:53] things I mean he did a lot lot of things
[58:57] he said when you look at all that my
[58:59] hands has wrought and all and on the
[59:01] labor that I had labored to do and
[59:04] behold it's
[59:06] all
[59:08] vanity building the Temple was vanity
[59:11] everything he did for Jerusalem as
[59:13] vanity no it's it was good he had the
[59:15] temple but he's just putting it in
[59:20] perspective
[59:21] wow to labor to do behold it's all
[59:24] vanity and
[59:26] vation of spirit do you want me to tell
[59:29] you something and and this is person you
[59:30] know why we can't lock in with Jehovah
[59:32] God and and we can't worship him like we
[59:35] do and why we can't run the aisles and
[59:38] because we can't have Victorious It's
[59:39] because we got fation of spirit and we
[59:42] know that next month that something's
[59:45] going to and we're afraid something's
[59:47] going to blow or the bill or something
[59:49] and oh
[59:50] like and we're not here long enough to
[59:53] get that out of us
[59:56] brother Dale
[59:58] ain't that's right maybe you have
[1:00:02] already got your glorified body but I'm
[1:00:04] still in my flesh body and so I I'm
[1:00:06] dealing with the
[1:00:09] Badgers we haven't got no crop PL and
[1:00:11] it's going to rain on Wednesday and I'm
[1:00:13] thinking uh it's soon going to be June
[1:00:15] it's could freeze in
[1:00:18] September fation will it make any
[1:00:21] difference at all I'll still be who I am
[1:00:24] and if I ain't here it won't make no
[1:00:25] difference at all
[1:00:27] if I made it anything the government
[1:00:28] would take half of it and if I don't
[1:00:30] make
[1:00:31] anything I'd probably have enough to eat
[1:00:33] and if I didn't eat for a while they'd
[1:00:34] be all right
[1:00:37] too right but because of that thought
[1:00:40] pattern Satan has robbed our ability to
[1:00:44] be who we were ordained and
[1:00:47] predestinated to
[1:00:51] be oh whoa God help me vex ation of
[1:00:56] spirit and there is no profit under the
[1:00:59] sun he and he did spiritual things too
[1:01:02] verse 17 in chapter two therefore I
[1:01:05] hated
[1:01:06] life now I'm not telling you to go quite
[1:01:09] that
[1:01:10] far I think we can enjoy life and we can
[1:01:13] enjoy our families but I'll tell you I'm
[1:01:16] going to just drop a bombshell and all
[1:01:17] you older people know this the only
[1:01:18] thing that you're getting in life
[1:01:20] besides serving God is your
[1:01:22] relationships with family and your
[1:01:25] children and and your grandchildren and
[1:01:27] each other if you got friends you're
[1:01:29] blessed if you got friends that you
[1:01:32] can do anything with even on Christian
[1:01:36] friends you're blessed you got somebody
[1:01:39] sits across from the table and nods once
[1:01:41] in a while when you're sitting there
[1:01:42] you're
[1:01:43] blessed amen for therefore I have hated
[1:01:47] life because the work that is Rod Under
[1:01:50] the Sun is Grievous to me now you can
[1:01:53] mock Samuel all you want but you're not
[1:01:55] not going to be as bright as him when
[1:01:57] you
[1:02:00] die that's right for all is Vanity and
[1:02:04] vexation of spirit now he is mentioning
[1:02:06] this dozens and dozens and
[1:02:11] dozens of
[1:02:13] times Verse 18 and yay I have hated all
[1:02:17] my labor which I have taken Under the
[1:02:19] Sun now he built the Tabernacle how
[1:02:21] could he say
[1:02:24] that if was
[1:02:26] temporal it was temporal even though it
[1:02:29] was beautiful and it was God's will it
[1:02:31] was still
[1:02:33] temporal amen because I shall leave it
[1:02:36] unto a man that shall be after me watch
[1:02:39] this watch watch Samuel was talking
[1:02:41] about inheritance here now and who
[1:02:43] knoweth whether he shall be a wise
[1:02:46] man or even a
[1:02:49] fool how many times do people you know
[1:02:51] Google will tell you the government
[1:02:53] knows that one generation makes it the
[1:02:55] the Next Generation lives it and the
[1:02:57] third one blows it and then the fourth
[1:02:59] generation's on
[1:03:01] welfare did it really
[1:03:05] matter yay
[1:03:07] shall yay shall he have rule over all my
[1:03:11] labors wherein I have labored and
[1:03:13] wherein have I showed myself under the
[1:03:16] sun he said this
[1:03:19] also is
[1:03:24] Vanity and I'm just
[1:03:27] like
[1:03:30] wow anybody wants to give me counseling
[1:03:33] after that would be perfectly fine CU I
[1:03:37] think I need it you know we're in a
[1:03:39] state now and and you know I mentioned
[1:03:40] this some on Wednesday night which it
[1:03:42] was
[1:03:43] amazing we are in a state even the
[1:03:47] Believers where where people are not
[1:03:52] their conscience are becoming seared now
[1:03:55] and I and and I understand that you all
[1:03:58] individually have the baptism of the
[1:04:00] Holy Ghost and it is your
[1:04:03] protector don't get rid of
[1:04:05] it don't get rid of it but we have made
[1:04:09] a message of
[1:04:11] knowledge and the message is the truth
[1:04:15] it is Christ the anointed
[1:04:19] one but in the next couple weeks I'm
[1:04:22] going to preach on the
[1:04:23] absolute and I know before I preach on
[1:04:26] it cuz God's already told me that you
[1:04:29] will Flinch and I'm going to quote the
[1:04:32] prophet and see all of the message is
[1:04:36] Christ but we don't take all of the
[1:04:41] message let me give you just a sneak
[1:04:45] Pew brother B said that the the Jesus
[1:04:50] was the man of
[1:04:52] God and Christ was
[1:04:56] that's a direct quote a direct quote I
[1:04:58] mean I might be off a word he said Jesus
[1:05:02] now this is
[1:05:06] Jehovah he was born sinless he had the
[1:05:09] fullness on where am I going in this he
[1:05:12] had the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:05:15] 100% he's right full I just got a I got
[1:05:19] a as
[1:05:22] flee we have a part so we're connected
[1:05:25] we're the the diamond he was like the
[1:05:27] monster diamond and they just chipped me
[1:05:29] off and I was the I was the powder dust
[1:05:33] okay and your Prophet
[1:05:37] said the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:05:41] said that Jesus spoke in
[1:05:43] riddles and that the disciples couldn't
[1:05:46] understand them because your Prophet
[1:05:48] said that sometimes it was just the man
[1:05:50] talking and it didn't mean
[1:05:53] nothing and sometimes it was Jehovah God
[1:05:58] talking and that was the fullness of the
[1:06:01] godhead bodily Born
[1:06:03] sinless tabernacled In the
[1:06:05] Flesh if anybody like that quote after I
[1:06:08] got it print right off of my desk you're
[1:06:10] not going to come to me after and say he
[1:06:12] never said that cuz I got it
[1:06:15] memorized now if that's possible that
[1:06:17] our Prophet knew that about
[1:06:22] God is it possible about Prophets
[1:06:26] and
[1:06:27] pastors and five-fold
[1:06:35] ministers that's the
[1:06:39] message see many people connected around
[1:06:43] the message have the godhead
[1:06:45] wrong and the Bible and the prophet
[1:06:47] preached it
[1:06:49] perfect he said I'm not a trinitarian
[1:06:51] and a tarian but I'm not one like my
[1:06:53] finger the flesh is in heaven heaven and
[1:06:57] earth don't inherit the Flesh and Blood
[1:06:59] don't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven God
[1:07:01] could care less about the flesh that was
[1:07:02] tabernacled in Christ he just used it
[1:07:04] and threw her
[1:07:06] down God is a
[1:07:09] spirit and you worship Him worship in in
[1:07:12] spirit and truth so brother Dale is
[1:07:13] going to be loaded with mistakes I'm
[1:07:15] going to speak in riddles and you're
[1:07:17] going to go I don't know about
[1:07:23] what would that be any less in Jesus
[1:07:31] himself so I read that scripture when
[1:07:33] brother Thomas was here there's there's
[1:07:36] 99 false pastors and they're nothing but
[1:07:39] Kingdom Builders and money
[1:07:42] Grabbers but if there's them there's a
[1:07:45] real that's got the heart of Christ amen
[1:07:48] and you have to get a revelation the
[1:07:50] Bible says all them labor M that even
[1:07:52] though that somebody was speaking
[1:07:54] riddles
[1:07:57] and you say well I would never do oh boy
[1:08:00] see
[1:08:02] me you have to understand to see of the
[1:08:04] heart of Christ and to see on the word
[1:08:06] of
[1:08:08] God that's that's just where amen now
[1:08:12] that's that's I'm not supposed to go
[1:08:13] there but we're not we're see we're
[1:08:15] we're so entren and I'm not trying to
[1:08:17] take you out of the
[1:08:19] truth amen am I do I do I have some of
[1:08:23] you with me I'm just trying to take you
[1:08:25] of the
[1:08:27] falls I'll show you both sides and in
[1:08:30] the middle and three sides
[1:08:34] between but I promise God I'll never be
[1:08:37] a separan over here and I'll never be
[1:08:39] here and
[1:08:42] here
[1:08:45] amen and so we see in Acts
[1:08:47] 2:37 here's Peter preaching and this is
[1:08:51] something that happens very little in
[1:08:52] message
[1:08:54] churches I'm so wor to insult you I'm
[1:08:57] insulting myself too I have to watch it
[1:09:02] myself and when they heard these words
[1:09:04] they were
[1:09:05] pricked like yeah bless
[1:09:09] God I already have my
[1:09:11] Revelation I know exactly everything
[1:09:14] that I'm ever supposed to know nobody
[1:09:16] can teach me
[1:09:18] anything so nobody's ever
[1:09:22] pricked nobody's ever pricked when I
[1:09:24] preach on the absolute I'll show you I I
[1:09:26] matter of fact I'll put them up there
[1:09:27] the quotes of the prophet of your
[1:09:29] prophet of our Prophet the truth we'll
[1:09:31] put both sides up put everything up we
[1:09:34] got a lifetime till he comes and gets us
[1:09:37] but you know it's the truth there'll be
[1:09:38] some well I lean this way and I lean
[1:09:42] this way I kind
[1:09:45] of you know what let me give you a
[1:09:47] confession this confession is good for
[1:09:49] the soul confess was good for the soul
[1:09:51] you know brother Brown said about eight
[1:09:53] times he mentioned about one thing and
[1:09:56] and if I hear a Minister preach I cringe
[1:09:58] on it but brother Ram said about eight
[1:10:01] about 8 to 10 times about the church
[1:10:04] building now now I believe most of us
[1:10:07] would agree and if you don't it's it's
[1:10:08] all right I'll maybe catch up to you but
[1:10:10] most of us would agree that brother
[1:10:11] Brown's Revelation was Progressive so
[1:10:14] when I look in the message Hub and I I
[1:10:17] read this verse and I go to the message
[1:10:18] Hub you know what brother Dale does if
[1:10:20] it comes up and it's like 50 or more if
[1:10:22] I can't read all the quotes I scroll to
[1:10:25] 65 and I read them
[1:10:31] backwards I'm not saying the first part
[1:10:33] A I'm just saying if I don't have time
[1:10:34] to read 99 quotes I'm going to read the
[1:10:38] 50 from after the seals because I know
[1:10:42] our Prophet said that the Bible changed
[1:10:44] to him after the
[1:10:46] seals and if it changed to him it
[1:10:48] changed to me okay so I like I will read
[1:10:52] lots of ones from before but I'm just
[1:10:54] saying
[1:10:55] and brother Bram so this is just a
[1:10:56] confession and and you can throw this
[1:10:58] out and we'll go on with our thing but
[1:11:01] brother Braham said a bunch of times
[1:11:03] early in his ministry that we'll be here
[1:11:05] when they close up the door and throw
[1:11:06] away the key and make it
[1:11:09] warehouses but he sold the last time he
[1:11:11] said it and maybe even the second last
[1:11:13] time he said they'll never do that we'll
[1:11:16] be gone in the Rapture before they do
[1:11:17] now which one you want to
[1:11:20] believe I know which one I'm going to
[1:11:22] believe now you have the right to
[1:11:24] believe everything you want you can't
[1:11:27] believe both of them cuz they're not the
[1:11:29] same but I'm going to go he's all right
[1:11:31] sister Dom he's help come on up here and
[1:11:32] help me preach buddy you look a lot
[1:11:34] better than me anyway uh uh he's
[1:11:38] perfectly fine
[1:11:40] uh we finally got somebody running the
[1:11:43] aisles amen hey watch this you see what
[1:11:47] I'm saying the prophet here came with
[1:11:49] the God was dealing with them and maybe
[1:11:51] it will be but is it edifying to tell
[1:11:53] you they're going to lock us out of the
[1:11:55] church church or would you rather go in
[1:11:57] the Rapture before the lock us out of
[1:11:58] the church and that's after the seals I
[1:12:01] mean I'm not trying to make this
[1:12:02] something that's not I'm not trying to
[1:12:04] go off the word is everybody comfortable
[1:12:05] with that but I'm just showing you the
[1:12:07] whole picture and so I've sat and heard
[1:12:10] ministers say oh bless God they're going
[1:12:11] to lock up the church you're all going
[1:12:12] to be locked home we're never going to
[1:12:13] be able to talk to each other and that
[1:12:15] might
[1:12:16] happen but I'm going to preach on the
[1:12:18] other one so if you have problem with
[1:12:20] that you know you might consider
[1:12:27] and the reason I'm doing that is after
[1:12:28] the
[1:12:29] seals it's after the seals it's right
[1:12:32] before he went home he had the full
[1:12:33] Revelation that don't mean I'm not
[1:12:39] saying now there but the message is full
[1:12:42] of things the godheads full of things
[1:12:44] like
[1:12:47] that and so we get entrenched in our
[1:12:50] Doctrine we say oh bless God that that
[1:12:53] nobody's going to change me bless God
[1:12:56] I've been sitting in this Pew for 45
[1:13:00] years and so we're never
[1:13:03] pricked we're never
[1:13:05] pricked we I can I can tell you anything
[1:13:08] you want very few of you go out here and
[1:13:09] be
[1:13:10] pricked because we've seared our
[1:13:13] conscience we we said this is the
[1:13:15] absolute and I've covered it up with
[1:13:16] concrete and I ain't moving I can tell
[1:13:19] you a few things the prophet said about
[1:13:20] that said if you stop learning you stop
[1:13:22] closing up your heart and you close up
[1:13:24] your heart to Revelation that
[1:13:26] and God gives you a gift you don't use
[1:13:27] it no God will take the little bit you
[1:13:30] got he'll take that one flea that I got
[1:13:31] and he'll
[1:13:33] go he'll take that one little talent I
[1:13:36] got that I
[1:13:39] buried and he'll give it to somebody
[1:13:41] that won't bury
[1:13:44] it amen I don't know where that came
[1:13:47] from but man I'm just saying God help us
[1:13:50] that like like listen church this is
[1:13:52] what I'm saying we don't want I have no
[1:13:56] desire to be
[1:13:57] off I have no desire to get to heaven
[1:14:01] and say you like to me oh boy so
[1:14:05] boys with Amazing Grace
[1:14:08] that's amen if I have just eat Branch
[1:14:12] water here but I want the truth I want
[1:14:16] the full truth and even even if as a
[1:14:19] minister even if I show you both sides
[1:14:21] and you consider for your
[1:14:24] household maybe you'll lean just a
[1:14:26] little bit different than I'll tilt
[1:14:28] there that's okay that's right but I'm
[1:14:32] not just going to preach in this
[1:14:34] ditch when there's another ditch over
[1:14:40] here wow God help us watch in
[1:14:44] Deuteronomy 14 I I got to speed up here
[1:14:46] and I got some amazing things the
[1:14:48] prophet said Deuteronomy 14 for thou art
[1:14:50] a holy people unto the Lord thy God and
[1:14:53] the Lord ha chosen thee To Be A peculiar
[1:14:56] people unto yourself now I want to stop
[1:14:58] there and show you something you know
[1:15:01] the prophet when he preached about being
[1:15:02] peculiar we're actually supposed to be
[1:15:05] almost almost loose
[1:15:10] cannons you know how the prophet
[1:15:12] preached that in the 9 it's a good thing
[1:15:13] you're sitting down because you're going
[1:15:14] to fall down he almost preached that you
[1:15:16] were almost supposed to live like a
[1:15:20] gypsy because this world ain't our
[1:15:23] home I I got that quote it's right here
[1:15:25] in my Dandy I'm coming to and Above All
[1:15:30] Nations that are upon the Earth see
[1:15:32] we're peculiar people here in First
[1:15:34] Peter 2:9 and I'm just going fast 1
[1:15:36] Peter 2:9 and anybody can take anything
[1:15:39] I have here or say but you are a chosen
[1:15:41] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:15:44] nation A peculiar people that shall show
[1:15:47] forth the Praises of him who has called
[1:15:50] you out of the darkness Into His
[1:15:52] Marvelous Light amen what are we doing
[1:15:55] getting so connected with the world now
[1:15:58] like I understand you need the house
[1:15:59] warm so you don't freeze to death I I
[1:16:02] know that I I'm not
[1:16:04] preaching be a
[1:16:06] gypsy but I'm I'm just leaning this way
[1:16:15] because
[1:16:16] amen everybody's locked into young
[1:16:19] people are getting locked into 25 and
[1:16:21] 30y year mortgages and they can't serve
[1:16:24] God for the 30 years they got the
[1:16:25] mortgage and when they get done they're
[1:16:27] going to die the next year does it
[1:16:35] matter you know if you know my uncle
[1:16:38] used to say this and I I'm just trying
[1:16:40] to bring this in perspective he said you
[1:16:42] know and he died many years ago I was a
[1:16:44] young man and he died when we were
[1:16:46] married and uh he said you know right
[1:16:49] when you're able to farm or do something
[1:16:52] you
[1:16:52] die and I I think myself I said you know
[1:16:55] I got I got I think 8 years or 7 and A2
[1:16:57] years left on my mortgage I said you
[1:16:58] know when I finish my mortgages on
[1:17:00] farming I could really kick up my heels
[1:17:02] and I'll be doing good if I can just
[1:17:05] walk it won't you know all that stuff
[1:17:07] that I did it won't really matter and if
[1:17:09] my kids didn't use it it would be
[1:17:13] just cuz the next guy bows it down and
[1:17:17] put it in a pile
[1:17:19] and I'm like why why did we do that the
[1:17:23] Bible talks about lay up your Treasures
[1:17:25] where moth and rust do not corrupt and
[1:17:27] thieves do not break through and
[1:17:29] steal they're the only things that's
[1:17:31] going to last forever now like yes we
[1:17:33] have to you know and I'm in favor of
[1:17:35] inheritance and you know all the but but
[1:17:39] we're we're different I I I want to get
[1:17:40] to this quote let me read another
[1:17:42] scripture here you see here Abraham we
[1:17:45] got some examples you know Abraham was
[1:17:47] promised something and he was Abraham
[1:17:49] was living like a
[1:17:51] Gypsy by the way he is your spiritual
[1:17:54] father
[1:17:57] Okay and like this is no insult to God
[1:18:00] or Abraham but like would you do what he
[1:18:04] did he left everything he knew and all
[1:18:07] the Comforts of home go live in a tent
[1:18:10] with a bunch of strangers where he
[1:18:12] didn't know he was pumping his water or
[1:18:14] nothing we would call those people that
[1:18:16] driving around the van with Windows in
[1:18:19] it and don't have a barber very often
[1:18:27] and do you know Abraham never received
[1:18:29] the full promise until he
[1:18:33] separated from all
[1:18:37] this unbelief
[1:18:41] lot because what did lot want you want
[1:18:44] to be related to
[1:18:46] lot he wanted the wealth and ease of
[1:18:49] Sodom I mean they had streets praise God
[1:18:53] the lights come on at night
[1:19:00] woohoo and if it hadn't been for
[1:19:03] Abraham lot would have
[1:19:05] been
[1:19:07] uh-huh Hebrews 118 and10 let's read this
[1:19:10] by the face of Abraham when he was
[1:19:12] called to go out to a place which he
[1:19:14] should after receive for an inheritance
[1:19:16] obeyed and went out not knowing now
[1:19:19] here's the Gypsy not knowing whether he
[1:19:22] went but by faith he sojourned in a Land
[1:19:24] Of Promise as a strange C in a strange
[1:19:28] country dwelling in
[1:19:30] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:19:32] Heirs with
[1:19:34] him the same of the promise and for he
[1:19:37] looked for a city whose Builder
[1:19:40] foundations whose Builder and maker was
[1:19:43] God you know if you want the peace that
[1:19:45] that last song was talking about that
[1:19:47] Jared
[1:19:49] sng you'll be thinking about over there
[1:19:52] a lot more than whether the church gets
[1:19:54] it or
[1:19:56] not you'll be thinking about over there
[1:19:58] you
[1:20:00] know it it affects you when you get to
[1:20:04] that when people your age start dying my
[1:20:07] brother says you know half the people I
[1:20:08] went to elementary school they're
[1:20:09] already dead you know it kind of lowers
[1:20:12] your expectations about building your
[1:20:16] kingdom cuz somebody else is going to be
[1:20:18] living in
[1:20:22] it here I'm just going to bite press
[1:20:25] this here just the top of this quote
[1:20:27] here brother Braham talking to saying he
[1:20:28] said when you become a missionary as
[1:20:30] myself and he said you've been in
[1:20:32] different countries amen and his wife
[1:20:35] says well you been in so many different
[1:20:37] nations and he said well aren't we
[1:20:38] Americans and she said oh no honey we're
[1:20:41] not Americans and he said we're seeking
[1:20:43] aity you Builder makers God he said I
[1:20:46] went to Finland and I seen the way the
[1:20:47] finlands acted and I went down to
[1:20:49] Germany and I seen the way the German
[1:20:51] Spirit was and I went down to to Sweden
[1:20:54] and all these places in the spirit and
[1:20:56] we have an American Spirit and she said
[1:20:58] well well well what about us he said I
[1:21:00] got a Heavenly
[1:21:05] spirit
[1:21:06] amen God help us here in Hebrews 13 14
[1:21:11] and 15 it says for we here have no
[1:21:13] continuing City but we seek one to come
[1:21:17] but him therefore let us offer a
[1:21:19] sacrifice of praise unto God continually
[1:21:21] that is the fruits of our lips giving
[1:21:25] thanks unto his name we're so
[1:21:28] concentrated we're so we we have such a
[1:21:31] burden of living our life that we can't
[1:21:33] even live our spiritual life to the to
[1:21:36] the to the the biblical
[1:21:39] aspect of what God you know and and and
[1:21:44] uh wow God help us God help us you know
[1:21:48] and we can't help it like sometimes you
[1:21:50] will have jobs where you got politics in
[1:21:53] the workplace it's just garbage the word
[1:21:56] politics the definition in the
[1:21:58] dictionary is garbage it just I it's for
[1:22:01] me anyway amen it don't matter if it's
[1:22:04] at work or wherever it is it's just you
[1:22:06] know what I mean and we have all these
[1:22:08] things that are in our mind and our
[1:22:10] hopes and dreams
[1:22:12] and and we're so concentrated in all
[1:22:16] this that if God was to speak for us
[1:22:19] it'd take a
[1:22:21] tornado because we're never Qui enough
[1:22:24] to listen 1 John 2 1 John 25-1 17 I'm
[1:22:29] trying to hurry love not the world nor
[1:22:31] the things of the world the things of
[1:22:34] the world that are in the world if any
[1:22:35] man love the world the love of the
[1:22:38] father is not in him for all that are in
[1:22:40] the world and the lust of the Flesh and
[1:22:42] the lust of the eye and the pride of
[1:22:43] life is not of the father but it is of
[1:22:47] the world and the world passes away and
[1:22:49] the lust thereof but he that doeth the
[1:22:52] will of the of God AB light is forever
[1:22:55] now I want to show you something we
[1:22:56] think this is actually Sinners that are
[1:22:59] coving the worldly things and lust and
[1:23:02] all the things no this is talking about
[1:23:04] godly
[1:23:06] people this is talking about godly
[1:23:08] people that come to church and they
[1:23:09] never enter into the worship in the
[1:23:11] proper way that they're supposed to and
[1:23:13] they could God could never have them
[1:23:14] speak in tongues or prophesy ever
[1:23:17] because they're like a
[1:23:20] ah if the phone ain't beeping in their
[1:23:22] lap it's beeping in their head
[1:23:27] you can't wait for me to shut up and go
[1:23:29] home and and
[1:23:33] go brother Dale's been
[1:23:35] there I might even still be there some
[1:23:48] things John 18 and so we we looked at
[1:23:52] Abraham and Abraham here Jesus Jus gave
[1:23:54] Abraham Jesus you know it's funny when
[1:23:57] we look back at history we we think oh
[1:23:59] Abraham he's my hero and oh praise God
[1:24:02] that was really awesome God sent that's
[1:24:04] cuz you know the end of the story but
[1:24:06] most of you sitting here this morning if
[1:24:08] you were Abraham you would have had some
[1:24:11] thoughts twice before you
[1:24:15] packed if you don't think so just be
[1:24:20] ready to pack and come anywhere I go
[1:24:21] this winter you oh I like I'm not
[1:24:26] I'm
[1:24:27] not see you and the
[1:24:30] went cuz if you're afraid to go to the
[1:24:32] mission field you would have did what
[1:24:33] Abraham
[1:24:35] did oh
[1:24:37] [Laughter]
[1:24:40] well maybe I don't have the money did
[1:24:42] God ask Abraham if he had the money
[1:24:44] maybe I I don't know where if there'll
[1:24:45] be fresh water when I get there did God
[1:24:46] ask brother Abraham if there' be fresh
[1:24:48] water there what's the Bible say don't
[1:24:49] even consider
[1:24:51] sitter don't even take an extra pair of
[1:24:53] clothes
[1:24:56] well who's going to buy for my ticket
[1:24:58] don't even consider that God owns got on
[1:25:03] Thousand see are you Abraham's
[1:25:07] seed what I'm trying to show you is
[1:25:09] Abraham did something out
[1:25:13] dare out dare he left all the known and
[1:25:18] Comforts to go he didn't know the end of
[1:25:21] the story he didn't know the end of the
[1:25:23] story
[1:25:25] he just
[1:25:28] believed and maybe brother Dale's not
[1:25:31] there yet I'm working on
[1:25:34] it you know what I'm saying are you
[1:25:37] there yet that's up to you and God but
[1:25:39] you see what I mean here here Jesus
[1:25:41] answered in John 18:36 and I'm trying to
[1:25:44] hurry Jesus here here Jesus answered and
[1:25:48] said my kingdom is not this world and if
[1:25:51] my kingdom were of this world then my
[1:25:53] servants
[1:25:57] would
[1:25:58] fight so you know every Church bottle
[1:26:01] that there ever was when people fought
[1:26:04] because they're not
[1:26:07] converted cuz you're not mine and I'm
[1:26:09] not yours and and none of this is
[1:26:12] anybody's cuz it's all God's and I mean
[1:26:15] everything that God gave us he gave us
[1:26:17] and even if it is yours it ain't yours
[1:26:19] because you wouldn't had it if you
[1:26:20] wouldn't give you breathe to work to go
[1:26:22] get it and so yeah
[1:26:24] you know it really really brings
[1:26:26] everything in perspective well bless God
[1:26:28] well this building's mine oh yeah well
[1:26:30] try to pay for it without God's
[1:26:34] blessing just try to to to to increase
[1:26:37] your breath one hour from
[1:26:41] now that I should not be delivered to
[1:26:44] the Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:26:49] hence now now this is who we call Our
[1:26:52] God
[1:26:59] I I think if we did the reverse math on
[1:27:02] that that means we would have to have
[1:27:04] the same Doctrine as
[1:27:07] him you know and and not and I'm not
[1:27:10] preaching against having jobs CU don't
[1:27:12] come to me and tell me you got a bill to
[1:27:13] pay next month cuz you quit cuz then I'd
[1:27:17] have to do something different
[1:27:20] but but you see what I'm saying
[1:27:24] we're so consumed you know brother Ben
[1:27:27] when he was here and he was preaching on
[1:27:28] the gifts and he said you know one way
[1:27:30] the gifts come is when you get lost when
[1:27:33] you Worship in such a way and your lost
[1:27:35] and your worship turns into a prophecy
[1:27:38] or your worship turns into the gifts of
[1:27:40] tongues because you're completely Stone
[1:27:44] drunk when's the last time you seen
[1:27:46] somebody Stone Drunk In Worship it's cuz
[1:27:49] you couldn't get there because you had
[1:27:52] all this hay in the way yet had all this
[1:27:54] clutter you know what I'm saying I mean
[1:27:57] I mean some of us do and and I mean but
[1:27:58] and it's wonderful when we get there but
[1:28:01] what we get there more
[1:28:04] often you know the Bible says you know
[1:28:06] that's why I don't have a trouble with
[1:28:08] the little ones you but you know Jesus
[1:28:10] said that unless we become like little
[1:28:12] children see like the little kids
[1:28:15] they're not they could care less if you
[1:28:17] make the payment on the
[1:28:20] vehicle they don't understand what we
[1:28:24] understand said now we they need us
[1:28:26] because they would get
[1:28:30] hungry but look at the other side Jesus
[1:28:32] said you got to come like them to even
[1:28:34] get there that means I'm not thinking
[1:28:37] about anything I could care less if I
[1:28:40] plant my crop I could care less if I go
[1:28:42] to work Monday I don't even care if I
[1:28:45] lose my job this is almost
[1:28:47] ridiculous you don't think I I I I'm
[1:28:50] losing you let me scroll to the bottom
[1:29:07] here here brother Brown said in the 60s
[1:29:09] in the end of 60s 6 almost 61 he said
[1:29:11] how Christian should live so we really a
[1:29:14] real born again Christian should almost
[1:29:16] be a
[1:29:17] Wanderer you thought I was just banking
[1:29:19] that
[1:29:21] up a gypsy
[1:29:24] they're not somebody I look up to but
[1:29:26] you you
[1:29:28] know uh in the sight of the world he
[1:29:32] should be a now this is what the prophet
[1:29:35] said a
[1:29:38] renegade I wouldn't look up to that
[1:29:40] person
[1:29:44] either but in the sight of God he's
[1:29:48] precious you see see see where I'm
[1:29:51] trying to go with this our Prophet said
[1:29:53] stuff like like this said we're brother
[1:29:56] Dale is so consumed in my
[1:29:59] world that and you're get consumed in
[1:30:02] your world Amen now that is on a 6509
[1:30:08] 111e so I can give that to you it's
[1:30:10] right on my iPod God help
[1:30:13] us you know God brother Brown talked
[1:30:16] about the the slave when the guy came to
[1:30:18] buy the
[1:30:20] slave amen and you know the story of
[1:30:23] that
[1:30:24] and everybody wanted to buy the one
[1:30:27] slave and he said well no no he he he's
[1:30:29] not for sale they're all for sale but
[1:30:31] it's like Tim he might consider selling
[1:30:33] some of his cows because cows are right
[1:30:35] off the charts and uh I'll never live
[1:30:37] long enough to ever see that money
[1:30:39] recouped ever by three
[1:30:42] generations and so when he picks out the
[1:30:44] one he's not going to pick out his
[1:30:46] favorite
[1:30:47] one he's not going to pick out the one
[1:30:49] he go out the passion just wrap his arm
[1:30:51] around scratch your oh baby you know
[1:30:53] just lay down here beside me and she
[1:30:55] lays down beside
[1:30:58] him so if you came to buy that one he'd
[1:31:00] say what she's not for
[1:31:02] sale and that was like this slave and
[1:31:06] they said well you give him special
[1:31:07] treatment now Tim don't give his cow
[1:31:10] special treatment he just wrecks all of
[1:31:12] them by spoiling them and they all
[1:31:14] become complete babies if they're any
[1:31:17] kind of a human being at all or an
[1:31:19] animal
[1:31:20] being but then there's some that are
[1:31:22] just hard t
[1:31:24] Akers and maybe they throw their weight
[1:31:27] around a bed or
[1:31:28] something now those are the ones
[1:31:32] that and you know the story better than
[1:31:35] I do about the
[1:31:37] slave and they said well you treat them
[1:31:40] different you know you do all these
[1:31:42] things different he said no I don't do
[1:31:44] them
[1:31:45] different he said but I found out that
[1:31:48] in his
[1:31:49] country his daddy's the king and even
[1:31:53] though he's a iant and we're not
[1:31:55] Canadians and we're just in Wyoming this
[1:31:58] morning but it's not our town you know
[1:32:00] we're just kind of we're
[1:32:02] Drifters Drifters you know that's really
[1:32:05] different for
[1:32:08] me you know we our families put down
[1:32:11] deep roots Lan's grandparents put down
[1:32:14] deep roots I mean they were property
[1:32:17] people they never moved or went anywhere
[1:32:20] they didn't even know what an airplane
[1:32:22] was they were born within one mile of
[1:32:25] the place they died you know they were
[1:32:27] just
[1:32:28] likeo they were territorial
[1:32:32] wolves and brother Brown says to be a
[1:32:35] Wanderer I'm just
[1:32:37] like what are you talking
[1:32:40] about
[1:32:42] amen but because his daddy was a king
[1:32:46] even though he was enslaved and away
[1:32:49] from
[1:32:50] home he carried himself like royalty he
[1:32:54] acted so much different that they
[1:32:57] wouldn't sell him amen God help us God
[1:33:03] help us to be like that amen and we see
[1:33:06] this scripture you know where it talks
[1:33:09] about the uh you know making our calling
[1:33:12] and election
[1:33:13] sure brother Braham said in the message
[1:33:17] Hub that's connected to that scripture
[1:33:19] that you have a decision to
[1:33:22] make and we talked about Abraham had a
[1:33:25] choice to make Abraham made a choice
[1:33:29] Jesus had a choice to make Jesus in the
[1:33:33] Bible went to pray in the garden and he
[1:33:35] said father if you could take this cup
[1:33:39] from
[1:33:40] me I don't want to die I'm I'm so under
[1:33:44] pressure from the Earthly Kingdom I'm
[1:33:47] sweating
[1:33:48] blood that's hard for me to even
[1:33:51] comprehend I know I know that's leg
[1:33:53] legitimately
[1:33:55] possible I know people that when they
[1:33:57] got the flu before they would throw up
[1:34:00] that blood would commot their sweat
[1:34:02] glance because they were so Under
[1:34:05] Pressure they were just going to blow up
[1:34:07] and then they would throw
[1:34:09] up but there was another person in the
[1:34:12] Bible we think oh well you know not a
[1:34:14] big deal you know I would have did the
[1:34:16] same thing no you wouldn't
[1:34:19] have and that was Moses
[1:34:27] yeah because we know the end of the
[1:34:28] story we think oh yeah yeah he's a great
[1:34:30] hero he's an
[1:34:34] awesome he was a
[1:34:37] cilona he would have maybe been the next
[1:34:39] pharaoh of
[1:34:41] Egypt he was the adopted
[1:34:45] son he would have had at the very at the
[1:34:48] very least when Pharaoh died he would
[1:34:50] have been second in command if not first
[1:34:53] he was a
[1:34:55] hero they were the rulers of the world
[1:34:58] they were the Hitlers of the
[1:35:00] world do you know my daddy told me I
[1:35:03] remember clearly you know before all
[1:35:05] this internet stuff I
[1:35:06] remember when the cord war was on and
[1:35:09] and where they were putting the missiles
[1:35:10] outside of Florida uh Russia F uh what
[1:35:14] was it Cuba Cuban Missile I remember my
[1:35:17] daddy listening to the radio and and
[1:35:20] there was a few days there that was just
[1:35:22] kind of like touchwood you know
[1:35:25] and he was really affected by it I I
[1:35:28] remember I could tell you where he was
[1:35:29] sitting in the house listening to the
[1:35:31] radio and you know he talked about World
[1:35:33] War II his brothers fought in World War
[1:35:36] II and he said you know there was a long
[1:35:39] time where nobody knew who would
[1:35:43] win
[1:35:45] MH now if you go back and read history
[1:35:48] you know you can tell that it was for
[1:35:49] sure Hitler would lose cuz he just never
[1:35:52] had the resources and and is you know
[1:35:54] but
[1:35:56] Moses could have had a walk in the park
[1:35:58] in Egypt he could have had women and
[1:36:02] maids and money and
[1:36:06] luxury and
[1:36:08] plush and everything
[1:36:11] plush
[1:36:14] plush and they put him in the mud
[1:36:17] pit because of a choice
[1:36:23] I'm not so
[1:36:25] sure we would have had to have a time
[1:36:29] out on that
[1:36:30] decision you know if you don't think so
[1:36:33] you just you know you know there's
[1:36:35] people that would have a life like you
[1:36:38] you know and they literally pick up uh
[1:36:41] the brother that died uh sister kassy's
[1:36:44] Dead uh Ray Maddox he was one like that
[1:36:50] you know when we went to the Philippines
[1:36:54] a huge percentage of the pastors I mean
[1:36:57] a huge
[1:36:58] percentage 70
[1:37:00] 80% said I got saved under his
[1:37:06] ministry huge I I seen Stone blind
[1:37:11] pastors that read the Bible on
[1:37:13] Braille come to the pulpit and nestor's
[1:37:16] church and his son and his son led him
[1:37:20] to the pulpit and preached he said I was
[1:37:22] saved under Ray maddox's
[1:37:24] sermons rayax left everything you
[1:37:28] have to go to the mission field for
[1:37:31] nothing for absolutely
[1:37:35] nothing
[1:37:37] nothing and his kids thought he was
[1:37:40] insane and they were
[1:37:43] right don't be shocked they were right
[1:37:46] you would have thought he was insane by
[1:37:48] Earthly
[1:37:50] standards you act surprised that's how
[1:37:53] we think
[1:37:54] you're not going to leave what you got
[1:37:56] and just move somewhere and and just
[1:37:57] said nothing I don't even believe he had
[1:38:00] a pension or nothing it was just it was
[1:38:01] just
[1:38:03] like I'm just going and eating
[1:38:07] whatever and we seen oh man I
[1:38:11] don't tens and tens of if not hundreds
[1:38:15] of ministers or well seral was saved
[1:38:18] under Ray
[1:38:20] maddox's
[1:38:22] Ministry because he did something that
[1:38:25] most of us would choke
[1:38:27] on because he under because some of
[1:38:29] these people like Moses they understood
[1:38:33] like I don't care if you live to be
[1:38:34] hundred it's coming soon I'm finding out
[1:38:37] a few things like
[1:38:38] that I'm fin not a few things like
[1:38:41] that this is just a
[1:38:43] blur and all that matters is what you've
[1:38:47] done for Christ is the only thing
[1:38:49] that'll matter it won't matter if you
[1:38:52] have gold nickels or it won't matter
[1:38:54] what you know we went to a funeral just

[1:39:02] know we we uh we think of things like
[1:39:04] this when we you know get over the hill
[1:39:07] you know and
[1:39:09] uh uh we we have a couple thoughts you
[1:39:13] know we tell the kids but one is don't
[1:39:16] spend no money just 100 bucks get rid of
[1:39:20] us and sprinkle Us in the flower garden
[1:39:22] or something kick the tires and keep on
[1:39:25] trucking but like this funeral the
[1:39:28] casket was 100% white one piece of Steel
[1:39:32] on it I seen of any
[1:39:34] kind I said there's a smart person you
[1:39:38] see people that put $10,000 casket oh
[1:39:41] like
[1:39:42] what like who are we trying to
[1:39:45] impress hello it's going to go in the
[1:39:48] mud and
[1:39:50] rot that's called the new kind of
[1:39:56] oh bless God I would never no if I would
[1:39:59] have had the full decision on my daddy
[1:40:01] and and for me I you can buy cardboard
[1:40:04] caskets I'm
[1:40:09] dead does it matter when you're dead
[1:40:12] you're
[1:40:14] dead but oh well you know they were
[1:40:16] better people than that so let's
[1:40:21] just who we trying in
[1:40:25] press and the prophet said in this
[1:40:28] scripture in the message up he said
[1:40:30] Moses made a lot better decision than
[1:40:33] the Rich Young
[1:40:37] Ruler kind of makes your perspectives
[1:40:40] change now I'm not you know like I said
[1:40:42] I put a disclaimer like don't everybody
[1:40:45] go out and quit their jobs and come back
[1:40:46] we're not communal living you know I
[1:40:48] suppose you couldn't grow a garden out
[1:40:50] our place but
[1:40:54] but are we Christians are we Christians
[1:40:57] like Abraham and
[1:41:00] Moses you think about
[1:41:06] that are we Christians like Jesus bless
[1:41:09] God if they step on my toes I'm going to
[1:41:11] line them up
[1:41:13] when what what would Jesus fight for he
[1:41:16] said I don't even have nothing to do
[1:41:17] with anything
[1:41:18] here and I could really say that I don't
[1:41:21] have nothing to do with anything now one
[1:41:23] thing here's mind I ain't taking nothing
[1:41:25] to M with me of my
[1:41:27] character and I'm working on
[1:41:33] that wow God help us no continuing
[1:41:39] City Moses decision paid off watch his
[1:41:42] Paul Bears the Bible said that they were
[1:41:47] angels He had a hot shot
[1:41:50] funeral and nobody could go find his
[1:41:53] don't
[1:41:57] either the Rich Young Ruler never had
[1:42:00] angels He had to pay his ball
[1:42:09] Bears
[1:42:11] Hallelujah God help us you see how the
[1:42:15] LIE of devil you know I almost wished I
[1:42:18] would have did the conversion
[1:42:20] differently but if I would have put the
[1:42:22] con
[1:42:23] version at $600 a
[1:42:26] day you would have been making about 30
[1:42:29] cents a to 50 years
[1:42:33] ago so my
[1:42:37] daddy bless God when he was driving that
[1:42:39] C&H with no power steering and the the
[1:42:42] the muffler would would glow and it
[1:42:44] would be brighter than the lights when
[1:42:45] he
[1:42:46] was and he'd make $1 a day and get his
[1:42:49] dinner for free he was like three times
[1:42:52] as r
[1:42:55] rich as you
[1:42:59] are and it's because of the LIE of the
[1:43:02] devil the stuff you carry in your pocket
[1:43:05] it ain't worth the ink that it took to
[1:43:06] print
[1:43:08] it because we're so
[1:43:11] broke that the mounties sent a message
[1:43:15] to the federal government and they said
[1:43:17] when the citizens of Canada realize the
[1:43:21] debt per head or per household you'll
[1:43:25] have a
[1:43:26] Revolt in
[1:43:29] Canada your babies that aren't even born
[1:43:32] know like a h
[1:43:34] 100,000 ones you're holding in your arms
[1:43:37] and the average household debt is close
[1:43:39] to a half a million I
[1:43:42] believe we think
[1:43:46] who and we're we're not going to be here
[1:43:51] anyway amen
[1:43:53] it just it just you know it just changes
[1:43:57] things you think about you know Lan's
[1:44:00] got some family members dying I've lost
[1:44:02] a brother already another brother's on
[1:44:04] the verge of death L's lost some it just
[1:44:07] makes you think what are we doing are we
[1:44:10] doing what we're supposed to be
[1:44:15] doing Matthew 6 and I I'm going to close
[1:44:17] here
[1:44:18] soon forgive me for wabbling on lay not
[1:44:23] up your lay up not for yourselves
[1:44:26] Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust
[1:44:28] thus corrupt and where thieves do break
[1:44:30] through and steal but lay out for
[1:44:32] yourselves Treasures in Heaven where
[1:44:34] neither moth nor rust do scrup and where
[1:44:36] thieves do not break through and steal
[1:44:38] and where your treasure is there is your
[1:44:40] heart also the Light of the body is the
[1:44:43] eye and if therefore thine eye be single
[1:44:46] the whole body shall be full of light
[1:44:48] but if thine eye be evil thy whole body
[1:44:52] shall be full of dark Darkness if
[1:44:54] therefore the light if therefore the
[1:44:56] light that is in thee be
[1:45:00] Darkness oh how
[1:45:03] great is that
[1:45:06] Darkness God help
[1:45:09] us God help us if you just don't mind I
[1:45:12] would finish with a few quotes here now
[1:45:16] we're alien in this world you're an
[1:45:19] alien
[1:45:20] because you're
[1:45:23] profess plainly by by your
[1:45:27] actions that the city who Builder and
[1:45:31] maker is God and you're no longer care
[1:45:34] for these things of the world but you're
[1:45:36] a Heavenly bound people that's looking
[1:45:38] for a
[1:45:39] city that the world didn't
[1:45:42] build you know the prophet preached on
[1:45:44] the these are all in the message Hub
[1:45:46] connected to these scriptures uh praise
[1:45:49] God for the people that made the message
[1:45:51] Hub the they were wonderful it is the
[1:45:55] one most it every single one of you I
[1:45:58] don't young older and different you need
[1:46:01] the message help if God blesses you with
[1:46:03] the scripture you can just punch on that
[1:46:05] and read everything the prophet said on
[1:46:07] that one
[1:46:09] verse it's a blessing it's a blessing
[1:46:12] it's it's a blessing for devotions
[1:46:13] everything he said you know most of the
[1:46:15] greatest Kingdoms in the world you have
[1:46:18] to dig down 20 ft to even find the top
[1:46:20] of the
[1:46:21] rooftops because because they're buried
[1:46:24] like pharaoh and Rome and different
[1:46:27] things like
[1:46:28] this they're completely covered all
[1:46:32] because there's no continuing city on
[1:46:36] earth he said we don't have to be like
[1:46:39] this you know here we're talking we
[1:46:41] don't have to have these spots and and
[1:46:43] I'm I'm I'm really winding her down here
[1:46:46] but it's a spirit that gets on
[1:46:48] us now if this might not be for you it's
[1:46:51] a spirit that gets on brother
[1:46:54] Dale there you can all point at me
[1:46:58] because of
[1:46:59] Television newspaper and I don't have
[1:47:01] television news but that's the same as
[1:47:03] on your
[1:47:04] phone television
[1:47:07] newspaper advertisement and then there's
[1:47:10] a really bake word that someday they
[1:47:13] might put me in jail
[1:47:14] for and that's
[1:47:20] propaganda if the government's telling
[1:47:22] you something
[1:47:25] I'll just tell you
[1:47:26] what I know bless God you're a proud
[1:47:29] Canadian but I'm
[1:47:31] not I'm not a proud
[1:47:33] Canadian if the Govern Canadian
[1:47:35] government's telling you something it's
[1:47:37] a
[1:47:38] lie it it's just it don't matter what
[1:47:41] come out of their mouth if their mouth
[1:47:43] open and they're the Canadian
[1:47:45] government it's a lie
[1:47:53] they're misleading brainwashing
[1:47:55] indoctrinate and
[1:47:57] disinformation is off the charts now you
[1:48:00] know who owns the freedom of press in
[1:48:03] Canada
[1:48:05] Pierre amen I'm not trying to be a
[1:48:08] downer I'm just trying to shake you and
[1:48:10] say what you're putting your hopes in
[1:48:13] are I mean maybe you maybe see this but
[1:48:16] so I'm just preaching to myself they're
[1:48:18] a
[1:48:19] joke amen I I want to just share
[1:48:22] something with you and and and and I'm
[1:48:23] not I'm not a politician I could care
[1:48:25] less if you ever vote it won't make no
[1:48:28] difference we're
[1:48:31] Christians but I just recently found out
[1:48:34] you know the leader of the World Health
[1:48:37] Organization which our government's
[1:48:39] already voted on it and probably they
[1:48:41] will hide it from us for 10 years and
[1:48:42] then they'll sabotage us kick us in the
[1:48:44] knee or a little higher but all the
[1:48:48] countries of the world voting to make
[1:48:49] them have ultimate control of your
[1:48:51] health every country that's Insanity
[1:48:53] that's actually a One World Government
[1:48:55] already cuz that means anybody that you
[1:48:57] elect have no say on the health of your
[1:49:00] government that vote already happened or
[1:49:02] is happening in May but the leader of
[1:49:05] the World Health Organization and was
[1:49:07] the leader during covid is a member of a
[1:49:11] US acknowledged terrorist
[1:49:15] group and a whole bunch of other stuff
[1:49:17] and they said and he's not a med he has
[1:49:20] less medical training than I have
[1:49:27] just let that sink in for a minute you
[1:49:30] know how much medical training
[1:49:32] has
[1:49:34] zero and he's a member of terrorist
[1:49:36] groups that are on my phone I I took the
[1:49:38] pictures of it and they are
[1:49:40] contemplating right
[1:49:42] now I'm not trying you scary I'm telling
[1:49:44] you brother Dale needs a Rapture cuz
[1:49:46] like insanity is getting very close to
[1:49:48] my mind of having a worldwide
[1:49:51] vaccination
[1:49:54] to fight climate
[1:49:58] change now if you believe that I have a
[1:50:01] farm to sell
[1:50:03] you and there's diamonds and gold in it
[1:50:06] and it's right on top of the
[1:50:12] ground see our Prophet said that the
[1:50:15] world would go completely insane we
[1:50:18] don't have to wait for that no longer
[1:50:20] we've already arrived
[1:50:22] we've already
[1:50:23] arrived amen I just have two quotes left
[1:50:27] here if you're born of the spirit of God
[1:50:28] you don't have the kind this kind of
[1:50:31] spirit the spirit that comes from above
[1:50:33] is Holiness Purity and cleanness God why
[1:50:37] I can't make people see that you have to
[1:50:40] be born from above and when you're from
[1:50:42] above and come here to the Earth you're
[1:50:44] a pilgrim that means you're not at home
[1:50:49] here it's not your home this is not not
[1:50:52] your home that's a direct quote this is
[1:50:55] not your home you don't belong here and
[1:50:57] we're just sojourning here but our home
[1:51:00] is above and we seek a city whose
[1:51:02] Builder and maker is God and that's the
[1:51:04] reason we're
[1:51:06] peculiar to the
[1:51:08] world and that's the reason the spirit
[1:51:10] of God gets into the meetings into the
[1:51:13] meetings and makes peculiar things
[1:51:15] happen because we're peculiar people now
[1:51:20] if you wanted to do reverse math on that
[1:51:22] like they teach you in school if there's
[1:51:24] not peculiar things
[1:51:29] happening maybe we're not
[1:51:33] peculiar but I know we
[1:51:35] are and so I pray that God will take
[1:51:37] brother Dale by the shoulders and
[1:51:43] go
[1:51:44] amen if you wanted some counsel from me
[1:51:48] make sure you do something you enjoy
[1:51:54] and do it with friends and family and
[1:51:57] enjoy every single day that when you go
[1:52:01] on a trip I tell my kids I'm going on a
[1:52:04] trip very soon that you've had the
[1:52:07] fullness and there will be no
[1:52:09] regrets because you've enjoyed the
[1:52:12] fullness of life here on Earth and if
[1:52:15] brother Dale ain't here next Sunday any
[1:52:16] one of you brother brother Carson
[1:52:17] brother Matt Jared brother Bernard and
[1:52:20] Tim you got five ministers that can just

[1:52:28] truth if you have the baptism of the
[1:52:31] Holy Ghost you're opt to teach with no
[1:52:33] warning it won't be like brother Dale it
[1:52:35] won't be like Ben norrod it'll be like
[1:52:38] you because God liked you and he filled
[1:52:41] you with the Holy Spirit and he wants
[1:52:43] you just like you
[1:52:44] are he don't want you to look like a
[1:52:47] clown and try to be something different
[1:52:50] it don't matter what the delivery is if
[1:52:52] it's the word of God it's God period
[1:52:56] don't matter if it's kre digs or Ben
[1:52:58] nood or Peter
[1:53:01] Chandler they were as different as the
[1:53:03] weather

[1:53:07] servants amen man we don't don't build
[1:53:12] don't build your Hope on the church over
[1:53:13] brother Dale because brother Dale might
[1:53:15] take a
[1:53:16] holiday I don't even maybe know I have
[1:53:18] it booked but God maybe knows I have it
[1:53:21] booked

[1:54:09] comes down you can drive that tractor
[1:54:11] till you become a tractor and it never
[1:54:14] feel the same as the power of the holy
[1:54:17] spirit it's the Deep calling to the Deep

[1:54:54] bills and we have to do a few things to
[1:54:56] get a few nickels and dimes and
[1:55:00] that but it's okay to check with
[1:55:03] God Amen God God help us you know we

[1:55:28] little different Earthly
[1:55:31] stuff am man very little different it'll
[1:55:33] make it a little easier for the
[1:55:36] kids but all we can do for him it's the
