thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah he's wonderful and it's just so good to be here and just so good to see you all here amen just so fantastic I just want to read just a quick quote here and just to disagree you all and actually maybe you can have your seats for a minute we'll just have some announcements and some preliminaries man we just uh put up a couple posters outside for the first of July weekend and we'll update the camp the one poster is for Camp Family Camp it's uh done by the Ottawa church it's on Silver Lake which is if you ever went to the other camp meeting before it's about 15 minutes closer it's this way we actually looked at a property at Silver Lake Farm so you can Google that campground that's a campground that they've rented amen and also there's youth meetings that John dank was the same weekend so just in advance July first weekend we will close our church we'll either be at one or the other or both and I pray that you will be at one or the other or both amen I just want to read just a just beautiful just the anointing that was on the prayer and the worship service here here's here's our profit in 64. he said neither will you ever make a believer as long as you're afraid to execute the authority that Jesus Christ has given you amen it's time you start speaking the spoken word the prophet wasn't the only one that had the spoken word you will never make a Believer until you start executing the authority that Jesus Christ has given you we already had the victory we're not praying for it we walked around like kids and Afraid too long amen I'm not preaching an arrogant Spirit but when it comes to the devil we are amen he's uh trespasser he meant and it's just so good amen we just welcome you all just to it's concerned somewhere here earlier in this uh we just praise God for protection even on the roads amen and our Guardian Angel and all these things amen amen just uh uh you know just going to read a scripture just uh you can actually probably uh we're gonna dedicate little Curtis this morning just I'm just going to read a scripture in Mark 10 13 and if you don't mind standing with me you can we'll read the scripture and then we'll we'll dedicate little Curtis and then we're going to the service amen and they brought the young children to him that he should touch them and his I like that part touch them amen Jesus was going to physically touch amen and his disciples rebuked them that brought them and Jesus said unto them and I read this and it's more uh it's more uh it's more uh outspoken it's more aggressive and Jesus was much displeased not just a little bit he was much it was much displeased and he and Jesus said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such as the kingdom of heaven and verily I say unto me you that whosoever shall not receive as the kingdom of God as a little children shall never enter therein you may have your seats and we'll just uh let me have your seats and we just ask God to bless the reading of his word and do it just asked Jared and Julie and the family and and uh maybe the grandparents too if they would like to amen our favorite little man they're all favorite little men his grandparents too Amen to come and face the camera and amen amen God loves the children amen there are church tomorrow amen you can one maybe honey come on this side just so

our little children Lord Jesus and we lord Jesus specifically dedicate brother Curtis to you Lord Jesus and we know that you just gave them to us for a period of time and Lord who are sure and joy in him Lord Jesus and we pray Lord Jesus that by your divine plan and predestination that we'll all be back together for all of eternity in your house and we bless your name and praise you for this great opportunity to prove to Satan that there will be a second Eve there will be a bride in this day that'll never bow their knee and fall like the first Steve did Lord Jesus we thank you and praise you we ask that you would be with the parents and even the grandparents and even everyone in the church that would just guide and help all the little children just to keep them off the street and say hey I wouldn't go that way that might burn you or hurt you and protect them Lord Jesus for the glory of God and your beautiful name we pray amen amen amen you're good for the camera amen one more to this amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah we want to minister today and for the next few Services Lord willing you know uh as a message believer the bride of Christ you know we have so many things that we could Minister on and of course we believe in uh being part of God and predestination and and these are all wonderful truths amen and and uh but sometimes we will step back as it is to say and uh maybe step back and slow down and look into the little details we said the little details there's really no details that are little but we'll look into we'll say In the Flesh the little details that God has and I want to throw this out there before we get into this you know we all know and I know too that the Holy Spirit and our sweet Lord Jesus is our head amen he's my head too and he's every Minister's head that's called of God and if he ain't their head you want to run for your life amen that's for sure but in that same text God gave us heads here on Earth amen amen I'm going to show you some things that the prophet said because you know I could Minister a store a message amen I was uh you know as is a balanced bride of Christ we shouldn't just get excited when when our our our sins aren't being exposed and our doctrines are being blessed amen we should get excited all the time amen see what I'm saying and so yes the Lord if if I'm if you don't believe I'm under the headship of Christ run for your life run for your life you'll help save me and yourself but God still had headship here that came under that headship now you must know those that labor among you and first off even the husbands the head of the homes amen and then even the fivefold ministry and then your local Pastor amen and I'm not trying to raise that Ministry up if you know me I'm not trying to do that but if you don't believe in the fightfood ministry you'll never be there you will not be there you I hope you and well I don't hope you enjoy but you will be in the regions of the Lost because the prophet said that the same holy spirit that leads you was the same Holy Spirit to put the five-fold ministry in the church amen and so I'm gonna what we're going to minister on the next many weeks and like probably three at least is little details and I want to title the message the kitchen table of God you know in the olden days in Canada at least families gathered around the kitchen table and most of the business and most of the planning was all done around the kitchen table if you were if you were doing anything and that family Realm in that household it was decided at the kitchen table amen and so we want to look into God's kitchen tables let's turn to Second Timothy three and if you'll stand with me one more time just in honor of Jehovah God and and his word second Timothy 3 and 16. and Amy I'm going to sing that song at the end of the script of service I'm sorry Amy wasn't pulling up our scripture fast last time because she had a song there for me to sing we're going to sing the little ones at the end of the service you remind me give me an old flag wave or something but all scripture is given for inspiration of God that means the ones we barely seldom ever read that's the ones that don't talk about predestination and you're a part of God and the Evangelistic services and all that they're all amen amen sister Katy is just coming in all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine God bless you Sister Cassie welcome it's profitable for Doctrine that means it's good for all of us for reproof that means it's good for all of us and for oh I don't want that part and for correction ouch I just say it ahead of time ouch and everybody needs correction including the fivefold ministry including brotherdale and including your favorite faithful minister for instruction and righteousness Paul wait a minute now I thought the Holy Ghost did that right the Holy Ghost is our keeper I thought the Holy Ghost kept us in righteousness but here in Paul's in Timothy Paul's telling us that the scriptures is for instruction and righteousness and 17 that the man of God may be am I reading that wrong I got my iPad verse 17 oh yeah no that's right I'm sorry I thought I was ahead of myself and that the man of God may be perfect and thoroughly finished unto all good works Lord Jesus we ask you just add the blessing to your word and your anointing on the people and the bride of Christ here in your beautiful name we pray amen amen you may have your seats amen so we see here that Paul is given us for Doctrine and you know in the Bible different uh uh things that we would do amen uh what the Bible says uh here let me just find it amen we're given many Oracles in the Bible that we would do man water baptism was one foot watching and communion and we believe them and we're to do them until Jesus comes amen their instructions to fulfill but I want to tell you this morning that if you get baptized and you don't have the right heart and you're not saved and you're not converted you'll just come down a wet Center go down a dry Center and come up a wet Center it will do nothing for you and if you're in a boxer than State and you come up and take communion to Fort Washington even after foot washing you give the pastor a big old-fashioned hug amen and you're a sinner you'll still go to hell amen so those outside things don't save us but God still said do them amen and so we believe them and we continue in this way and I want to just lay we're laying a foundation and we're going to go slow this is not going to be an Evangelistic service like when we were in Uganda but I want to look at some things because because we're seeing in the world the the edges of the Believers falling apart it's like an old cloth and it's getting frayed at the edges you know new Cod is just clean cut sharp and uh it's just getting clean cut amen uh just uh and but we're seeing that the churches and not are getting frayed none of the children are bothering me in the least by the way amen First Corinthians 11 1 B here's Paul talking again First Corinthians 11 1. he said be followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen so if you have a Godly Pastor or Godly fivefold minister in your life amen they are to be an example and should surely be an example unto the bride and the people in the church amen that as I follow Christ you should follow me and if I stop following Christ you keep following Christ and find another Godly person to follow that could be your dad your father your grandfather or part of the fivefold ministry amen and verse two and now I promise you Brethren that ye remember me and all things and keep the articles aha as I have delivered them unto you see God expects us to do some things the new trend in the world today is this well God knows my heart I just got Stoned Out of My Mind on Friday night and I come to church and sing in the choir and said well God knew my heart I didn't mean to amen yeah God knows your heart and that's why he'll send you to hell because he knows your heart amen see God will be you will be his first love amen commitment amen and you could have named anything in this amen we know the sins of of of many amen and so we see this amen we can look into this farther amen well maybe we'll read this just because I don't want to rush but we know that but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God amen and we know that Christ is God Christ means the anointed one amen God is the spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and every man praying or prophesying having they said uncovered dishonor us his head but every woman praying or prophesying with their head uncovered dishonours her head and even all one as she should be shaven that's where the scriptures that's one of many of the scriptures where it says that the long hair of a sister is the glory to God amen it's not the glory to brother Dale it's not the glory to the church it's like it's a glory to God Amen do I understand that no I don't understand that at all I just know that if you want to go where the the chief boss is saying to go you obey the rules or you're not going to arrive there amen amen uh so here the scriptures saying that if a woman was to cut her hair God's telling you to it would be better that it was shaven bald amen and the scripture and there's many other scriptures where it talks about the glory and honor it says even if the scripture even says this it said doesn't even nature teach us that it's a shame for a man to be a hippie and have long hair but it's a blessing and an honor for a woman it's just to have long hair and it's a shame for her to have a long short hair in most cases a woman that cuts her hair off looks very tough and Butchy and hard very very hard amen nature will teach you that amen for if a woman would not be covered then also or shaven then it is a shame for a woman let me start again for if a woman is not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for the woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered amen that means have hair for a man indeed ought to not cover his head in so much as his image and the glory of God but a woman is the glory of the man and for let the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither is the Man created for the woman but the woman created for the man I want to just jump ahead here and here in this this quote where we're we're going to look at in the prophet he was talking about because many in the churches especially in the message ranks are are uh are deceived amen and believe that the Holy Ghost is going to lead them through to a rapture and I want to show you here what the prophet says to that here in a second amen and brother Brown mentions this six times about Corinthians 1 11. and Jesus said he that receiveth them receiveth me he that receiveth them that I sent receiveth me sorry so here here God sent out the fivefold minutes right I'm talking about the true fight for Ministry you have the right to judge it you have the right to judge it but you don't have the right to get rid of it all amen amen so here Jesus says he said he that receiveth them that I sent receiveth me and now know them that he sent and them that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he's talking about Jesus and God Amen which which we made time to linger on that but you are only you can only serve God as you serve you can only serve God and he repeats that you can only serve as you do and obey the Servants of God ouch now there's 50 percent of message Believers I'm looking for my glasses here fifty percent of message believers would struggle with that now he's not talking about obeying Servants of God that are off the word no no you have full authority to know the difference that's called the Holy Spirit amen but if the holy spirit is rightfully dividing the word of God and you say well I don't need that servant and man you're deceived amen and the prophet says that here farther down amen my my uh sorry amen and you can only serve God on Earth see as God's servants that was sent on Earth by divine inspiration and inspires the word to you amen and the prophet goes in here and he mentions multiple scriptures which I love amen when you when you compare what the prophet's saying he just takes it right back to the word of God so let's go to First Corinthians 14 and 16. and here he says else when thou shalt bless be shall bless with the spirit how shall he that occureth help me out honey occupyeth the room of the unlearned Say Amen at thy giving thanks seeing that he understandeth not what thy saith now here's God saying that you need the fivefold ministry to understand what the spirit of the holy spirit is saying to you amen now the same Bible that you read says that it's for the perfecting of the Saints so without them you're not going to be perfected so the people that are sitting home on the couch reading their Bible themselves are reading the same Bible but could be lost wow here's in Luke 16 and this was even more simple or plain and man Luke 10 16 and here the prophet mentioned these right after that last quote he said he that heareth me you here's me and he that despises you also despises me wow amen God help us amen now this is in no way trying to say that the ministry or the fivefold is above the Holy Spirit never not even flied out a hundred percent absolutely not amen but we have a spirit in laodicea that lacks headship amen it's not just in the church that's why young people are fighting the police and they will you know swear cuss out the police or go to court or you know they see they have no space backdoor Authority for any headship that's why they have no respect they'll run away from home disobedient to parents the Bible says that and the end times see it's not just let me it's a spirit and you're affected by that spirit I didn't say you were Anointed with it I said you're affected because on a windy day it blows by you and you go Shake It Off amen I'm affected by you too sometimes somebody cries it was a windy day and that Spirit blew by amen God help us that's not of God amen amen and I'm not trying to here's the prophet saying in church order and Doctrine 63 he said I'm not trying to observe the Authority or something like that but you see a man or anything that has two heads he said it doesn't know how to go God never had two heads in the church he always had one and he always dwelt in every generation God's in this generation so who's the head well yes the holy spirit's ahead but other than that then it steps down to the fightful ministry then it steps out to the head of the homes then it steps down to the wives and not over the children and then the children would be below that amen amen God help us amen I'm looking for my here we go here's the one I was talking about amen I hope you allow me to slow down and just read these because they're they're worth reading hear the if the holy spirit is singing Let the singing go on and if then if we're standing here and start preaching and he raises up then and starts singing at the same time he's preaching then that person is out of order the holy spirit is not the author of confusion amen and he said that's right and he said the church he said you're lovely people here but you're all in air he said if you don't got if you're not God a gift he said use the gift where the gift belongs there's a place that fits in amen and if I've got a brick or a shovel certainly I won't try to hoe my potatoes with it he said no see he said you pick up the shovel and when I'm picking or digging a ditch amen but not picking by Tomatoes he's just saying you use the right tool for the thing he says I want it dry to drive my automobile through a cornfield well some people when they're drunk they actually do they uh I think that's cool but uh but he's saying see you got to have the right tool you're not going to harvest the corn with your automobile amen and he said so I ain't nothing else against plowing but I haven't got nothing against the automobile he said they're both instruments but you got to use them in the right place amen and he said so let's just drop down and he he said so oh please church have faith just a little while here and see he said we must come under teaching now that's the exact word he uses he says you say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come that sounds reasonable well the Holy Ghost is the ultimate teacher amen even even this watch this church even when a minister is going forth teaching including me you can't even help it you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's being filtered and that's all right and that's pure and that's good but at least allow it to go through the filter some have just closed the door and said my way or the highway amen watch what he says with this he says you say well I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost comes he says friends that gives me just a little room to doubt whether you even got the Holy Spirit or not wow how many would that apply to too many do you know if the people in this area that were sitting home listening to the tapes all came to church this church would be a lot Fuller don't matter to me if they come it's their eternal life you can't leave you can't make a horse drink water I can show them the water it's right here horsey Splash it in the pail amen amen he said just give me a little doubt to doubt whether you even really got it or not see he says CeCe he said the way you're acting with it see see the thing is you're doing he said now why if there was any no he said the the Bible says the holy spirit is the teacher that's beautiful they say praise God let's stop reading right there he said why then did the same Holy Spirit put teachers in the church well why did you have to finish the sentence bless God you see what I mean you can make the Bible say anything that's why we have ten thousand different churches you can make the message say anything you want all you gotta do is just stop reading right there not show the other part everybody's happy but if you want to take it all and go that'll be all that's fitly formed together beautifully and you'll be dressed beautiful man like Revelation says that the wife has made herself ready she's dressed with the word of God no amen and these are things that we don't normally slow down enough because we're we're preaching why did that same Holy Spirit put teachers in the church then to set the church in order it was the same Holy Spirit wow here they you know the the prophet when he went beyond the curtain of time amen and and all these things and we know about this and uh the the people were telling him that he would be judged for what he believed and what he preached and he said I looked and told them he said I remember in my vision I seen the presence of the Lord and his people were glorious land Yonder and I was looking around and I told them he said and they told me he said he will judge you first by the gospel that I preached and I said whoa just exactly I preached it just exactly the way Paul preached it and millions of them screamed out he said we're resting on that and another quote he says will Paul be judged also and sometimes operating has called has to be called and he said you call down or something on on that order and that person that's got a gift rejects it he's talking about calling somebody out that's out of order amen he said you called down or something on that order and the person that's got the gifts rejects it just remember refuse it remember the gift wasn't right it wasn't God in the first place you see because God don't reject God and if both had the Holy Spirit and the gifts are in order see somebody that's where he preached Church order and Doctrine where somebody won prophesy when The Minister's already prophesying amen because it's confusion they both can do it but at separate times when one finishes the next one comes up because God's not the author of confusion he said that gift just by see how you can judge the fruits is not this is not of God in the first place the spirit of God is always ready oh you wonder if some of these people that are on the edge of the material cloth material that's kind of frizzy this will answer that perfectly he said the spirit of God is always spirit of God is always is always ready for correction so if they're not ready for correction they're not even converted sweet and humble and willing see if you stand up and say why I'll do it anyhow you know how something then just remember an arrogant spirit's not of God and see why it takes this to uh to fulfill and man it was the subduity and everything the whole earth was filled with the glory of God Amen brother Brown said that multiple times in the quote say man when he preached that we're resting on that he actually said it five times here's another one where he says he says well he comes someday he's asking where Jesus is he said why can't I see Jesus when he went behind the curtain of time he said well now will he come someday and he said he'll come to you first but what but first you'll be judged and he said these people are all your converts that you've LED and he said you mean that I am the leader and that God will judge me for what I told the people and he said yes and he said does every leader have to be judged and they said yes and I said well what about Paul does Paul have to be judged and he said yes and he said he'll have to be judged for what he preached and he said well I said if his gift gift group goes through then so will mine because I preached exactly the same word as Paul preached and the millions screamed out we're rested on that let's turn to Deuteronomy 6 and we'll just lay more of a foundation amen and where we're trying to show you is that God has a plan on Earth let's say this right besides or in addition to to the Holy Spirit probably in addition to the holy spirit is more correct yes the holy spirit is the ultimate teacher of all of us and God's the boss but God has other plans on Earth in addition to the Holy Spirit and most the spirit of laodice sin where we're rebellious to parents and we're rebellious to the police and rebellious to the government amen rebellious to everybody and then we're of course we're rebellious to God's leaders it's a spirit amen Deuteronomy 6 and 6. and thou shalt love the Lord with all thy Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shalt thou put in thy heart now see we don't need this next verse if the holy spirit is the teacher and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and so talk with them when thou sin is in thy house and when thou walketh by the way and when thou layest down and when thou raised us up now that pretty woe covers your whole entire life God expects you to raise up your children in the way they should go that when they're old they will not depart from them and when you need to you this is how it is when you've done all you can do then you can rest on God's holy spirit that he's in control amen hallelujah and thou shalt bind them on a sign upon thy hand and thou shalt be as a frontal letters between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates now he's saying that when you want to talk about God you should have a sign on your hand one between you on your forehead and on the post of your house I think he's saying that we should talk about him all the time out of the abundance of the heart the most speakest if all you're thinking about is your big bank account or how you're gonna or how long you're we spend so much to Any Time smelling good and looking good when we're all going to go through the grave whether we go in the Rapture or not we're going to fall away amen no I I I'm not saying don't take care of yourself because of course we believe that amen and then if we drop down to verse 12 then it says beware lest I'll forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage now our house of Egypt is the world laodicea and sadly in many cases and brother Dale's too God's not always our number one priority thought amen we might talk about going to our favorite restaurant on whatever Road it is more than we talk about amen and see God's watching this whole film and he can tell by your desires amen now I'm not preaching religion get me wrong religion you religion is just a covering you okay there's people that are anointed of the devil in churches this morning and they got a nice tie on they got a nice hair deal and they got a full robe and they put the collar up and they're saying God bless you and behind them is a dragon with the tail they're devouring the people I'm not talking about religion but that's no reason to say that Holy ghost-filled people are going to say well God knows my heart I would go to that church but brother Dale's the pastor or well God knows my heart but you know like it's a long ways or well God knows my heart but uh I just like to trim my hair because I get a headache when it gets too heavy I've heard that yeah the double lotion to trim your hair too or your skirt or amen amen or give you a goatee so you look like a goat if you're a man or amen you see what I mean it just it's things that you know we've seen somebody at a funeral a while ago and it was a family member my kids are probably going to smile when I say this but like his hairdo you know like you can have whatever hairdo you want we don't live in North Korea and so it's not doggy-minded by Kim Jones to have whatever kind of Heritage but like some hairdos just make you on talk about men make you look like Hitler like can you imagine if I got like the mustache like that and like did my hair like with grease like flipped their back they carry a spirit I know this is you say well brother where did you find this stuff that's what you know this person we've seen like their hair was long but it wasn't long it was all cut long and they combed it all back and then it was straight off right at the collar and they had to goatee and the first time I said I said like it looks so ridiculous because I was expecting to see somebody that resembled a Christian whether they were or not that's up to God and I was just like oh I was like what's that it looked like somebody that just came out of the barn amen like it's a spirit huh you say well these you listen the realm around you that you can't see is more real than the one you can feel this whole place if you don't think so you describe ministers sometimes this whole place is Dancing with devils and angels and if you ever get under the anointing you'll be able to feel it and sometimes I get to catch them huh that's why when you go to a place like Uganda and the Believers have come for one purpose and they came three days before you got there even though it wasn't even scheduled till you got there and it came on Thursday night and it wasn't scheduled you talk about coming early for church that's coming early for church the first service is Saturday morning and you show up on Thursday you didn't want to be late like you were afraid the taxi might have a flat tire that's showing up early and somebody like me comes to the platform with notes and I never look at the notes one time and I try to preach for an hour and I preach for two and a half hours I'm like I'm done and I'm literally done and the whole movement is like you could have went right into eternity it's because of something you don't see it's spiritual warfare and it's a Spirits it's a spirits Satan is not coming in with a long coat and a long tail it's a spare it that were released in the Bible uh-huh it's not that you know if you want to cut your hair off the collar well bless God but it's a spare man Matthew 24 22. and I want to tell you we're going to go back to this scripture again and I looked it up studying and I did I just well like I'm not even going to go there but you know in the message Hub we have every scripture where the Prophet mentions to the scripture and he makes comments to the scriptures and in most of these verses there was over a hundred comments okay and there was ten verses so I would have to read like 1 000 quotes from The Prophet I didn't get that done in time for service today but I'll guarantee you we're going to come back to that and this is another example to kill that Spirit well like I can survive there's people have left this that a flat out told me flat out in messenger that I am going to it's going to be me and God we don't want to be hurt and so it'll just be me and God and here God knows that he's now we believe I already said that the holy spirit is your holder I know if you're predestinated yes I believe that you came from God and you'll go back to God I believe that in the Seven Seals the Seven Seals is the the unfolding of Christ hello help me preach it's the unfolding of Christ and you can't even unfold Christ with unfolded brother Dale you know I was preaching in Uganda I said when you unveil the seventh seals it actually shows Jesus Christ standing out there and I'm standing right beside the Son of God well because I was in him and if I wasn't standing beside the Son of God then Jesus ain't Complete because he's missing his little Tower his pinky or his hairdo or something because that's me and if you're ever gonna go there you got to get that Revelation for yourself and I can't give it to you if you were in him you'll be there in the end because God is complete and if being complete is part of you then you'll be there and you can't show me Christ without showing me brother Dale it ain't possible and I don't care what stories you've heard about my past or my youth or my childhood or anything if I came from Christ I'll be in Christ and Christ knew that too and he still said this he said Matthew 24 22. this is powerful he knew that he knew that I was in him and he would never be complete and he will never be uncomplete and so he never he knew that he would never be uncomplete so he knew I was coming back to him he knew that god Jehovah knew that and he said Son Matthew 24 22. he said except these days shall be shortened there shall be no brother Dale saved he said well look at that you just confused me greatly you came from God and God you must go back to God because God won't close the door until you're part of God and God still said this the prophet give us an answer that hundreds of them but he said this is what he said and this is why God's preaching on this he said the despairing of the age has so entangled asked all that even though you're elected you are so in God in Hollywood and everything that God's like using tweezers pulling out the hairs so you don't miss a freckle that was a part of them it's like a mass wreck where there's nothing but spaghetti and they get the vacuum and vacuum up pour it in a h that's how Satan has just infiltrated even the elected bride of Christ thus saith the prophet you don't believe me but the scripture says but for the elect's sake it'll be short you say wow bless God I got the baptism the Holy Ghost I'm fine yeah you're fine but you're still on take your ground because God said even you couldn't survived they remember when when Daniel Prayed in Daniel and God sent Gabriel the Angel his head Angel next to us can you imagine leaving the Throne of God you couldn't even survive there because God so holy you would disintegrate and the Gabriel Angel was standing there see they weren't born in sin shaped in the liquid comes the world speaking life and Gabriel the Angel's been standing there for like thousands of years and God says go and answer brother Dale's prayer in Wyoming I love that scripture I could lose my mind at that scripture and Daniel Prayed and God immediately sent the angel to heal your sister Patricia just like that but Satan was there and he fought the angel and sister Patricia thought why I thought Jesus didn't love me because he never showed up and God's pulling out his sword and for where and machine gun and Tom I shooting all the demons and the Bible says that Gabriel never succeeded until he called Michael good oh Lord Jesus he said I'll be Lord that's all you got to say is just call me Jesus Oh me come without me hey Gabriel said and I was able to go see Patricia now guess what he did and the scripture also said I left Jesus behind to fight tonight and you thought you were having a hard day I told you that story to tell you this and you were going to fight against Satan you and the Holy Spirit Gabriel couldn't Gabriel couldn't Master purposes gay broke on it in 21 days amen that's why Jesus wrote the scripture that if I didn't what this means in Reverse is if I don't shorten the days even the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be lost so he says for the elect's sake but you could rephrase that and say for God's sake he had to be complete so he shortened it to draw himself back together oh that's unbelievable you're not going to hear that at a denominational Church because they don't realize that you're part of God and you're King God that's not religion that's a family unit you can't separate a family Union when blood's mix Bloods mix forever amen Hallelujah oh Hallelujah you could lose your mind on that it's because it's Christ it's beautiful and here's Satan he said watch this he said it's a quote in 60. and I'm paraphrasing I just paragraph 59 if you want to check it out I have the information for you Satan said he's fed he fed us so much Corruption of hell that many thousands and thousands have believed it huh that's why brother Dale needs you and that's why you need your husband and that's why you need your kids and that is because that's why brother Dale loves Fellowship you think I want to sit home alone forget it amen it's spirits birds with feathers flocked together what's the Bible say when we all bring our liquor fire together in the church we get a whole big bonfire you know you should desire this place be packed out for one reason alone to get a bigger fire Matt Hallelujah he says multiple things like well like a thousand quotes on that verses amen our Prophet said if it wasn't for God's grace I wouldn't even make it and I'm a part of God you say but I but it's still Amazing Grace all you need to do is hear my life story and you'll just say oh my goodness all you need to do is hear about us going to Uganda and just say oh God some people are like are so blind they're just so blind you're so blind you just want to smack them right in the nose they said well I want to see God move in the church well I see God move everything time I breathe oh man that felt really take a deep breath oh thank you Jesus Jesus thank you Jesus for giving me lungs I can breathe you're Stone blind you're living on the ocean you say I want to see the ocean yeah I can't hear the ocean because God is the prophet said he's twinkled so many toys in front of you that you're not even impressed anymore with God you're not near any press God can just sprinkle himself there well that was just God that was just oh well you were just lucky oh luck alike like where's life come from can you please tell me where that come from so we're going to Uganda and you know we came the day before and we're leaving at nine o'clock we're leaving our house I don't know if I told you this but I'm sorry to bore you amen and we're leaving our house I'm telling you this because the devil wants to hear about God being alive my God's still alive he works all the time by the way amen and so we went to the thing we got some American money some Canadian money you know kick the tires and everything and we'd sent Leo some money a few days earlier and you know we're going and we operate out of our visa when we're there we just go get cash advances because it's easier to get money there and Leo messaged me at seven o'clock says Dale I need money said you need money I'll be there in 24 hours he says oh yeah but the people want to you know try not to eat for 24 hours like the painter painting the charts when he gets done I know you don't know what it feels like but they wouldn't have nothing to eat so one minute after he's done pain he wants to go buy a bag of rice he said wait 24 hours just try that don't eat lunch today I'll eat for you you say oh bless God he could wait 24 hours really I didn't see many of you waiting 24 hours when we packed dinner so I said oh Leo I said seven o'clock in the morning there ain't many there ain't a lot of post office opens there ain't a lot of uh banks open you know and I said okay so we have a you know one of these crazy cards that I don't even believe in my wife does I don't I haven't backslid yet and and so we went and the car didn't work I believe in cash by the way I believe in cash or gold not encouraged I don't believe in plastic and even though I did use mine in Uganda I had to repent um and we went the card wouldn't work and I just tell you what you just try it Monday you just go to your bank at 20 to 9. and you say just knock on the door twenty to nine then they open at nine you're stuck on the door and say I need some cash well I'll bet you ten thousand dollars that they won't even open the door okay I'll bet you ten well not that I'm bad but you know what I'm saying and but see you wonder if I was supposed to go to God but God opened the door and the first person was anointed of the devil and they said we don't open for 20 minutes but then God walked by and the second person said by the way I'll get you the money well I just tell you what we've been leaving that bank coming to this bank so we don't even Bank there really often I I don't have a lot of business there I have no my mortgage ain't there you can't say well breast down there you know you had a money no no no no no no no no no no no I do almost nothing there and then people come to say well I'd sure like to see God move God move man you you got to go to the eye doctor called the Bible the Jesus Christ because you're Stone blind I mean I mean like you need help I'll pray for you Wednesday and so okay 20 to nine we leave Luanne comes out to man well I got it praise God so we're leaving because we're leaving for the airport we were actually supposed to leave our house at night so we left 29 to get money until we go to the post office now now I don't know if you know but most post offices open at night right everybody's fine with that most of us but on Thursday in Oil Springs attend hello and just in case you don't know it Devil by the way the post office workers work for the federal government and if you think you're going to get favors from a federal government employee that you can't call by name you need more therapy am I all right so far well I get to the post office at quarter to nine now I'm catching a plane to Uganda and I knock on the door and God had me put on my spring jacket that was my Dale siding one which I don't even like to wear because I left it behind I did not take it to Uganda with me and the lady answered the door and I said I need to send the MoneyGram and she said I only answered the door because God had you put on your Dale siding code and I said well that's okay with me but I'm going on an airplane and I need to send money and she looked at her clock and she said today's Thursday and we open at 10. and you say well you know my God I don't believe in this kind of Miracle stuff you know like bless God that happened in the Bible times but you know bless God you know like that was David and Goliath you know we don't expect that today okay it's okay if you want to serve that God it's a different God than I have you can call them the same thing but it makes no difference like there's other Dales in the world but they're not me and I said well I'm going to Uganda and I need to send some money MoneyGram and I need a plane to catch and this is a federal worker that I have no clue who her name is and I couldn't even honestly tell you if I've ever seen her before I possibly could but it was not a recognized face and she says come in I said oh you were lucky brother lucky what kind of a devil God are you serving amen you say well oh God I'm not sure if I was supposed to go to Uganda you know like some people if a sledgehammer hit him right between the ice they wouldn't know what happened it's sad it's they can't help it amen Deuteronomy 11 I'm sorry that I was free that wasn't nothing here Deuteronomy 11 . uh are you put on my glasses to see eight it looks like uh 18. therefore shall we lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them in the sign upon thy hand now by the way this is not the same scripture I just read why did God put it in the Bible twice bind it in the hand that thy may as front letters between Thine Eyes I'm not sure what front letters is but I think it's something like this I'm a Believer man I'd say carrying your character just your atmosphere around you the anointing around you is beautiful it's inviting you know what I'm saying it's like when you go to somebody's door that's a stranger and they're they open the door and they say good morning it's an inviting atmosphere huh and ye shall teach them now this is a command brother Jared this command and thou shalt teach them to your children and I don't mean Julie that means you amen Thou shalt teach them to thy children speaking of them when thou sit us in thy house and when thou walk is in the way and when thou layest down and when they'll raise us up and thou shall write them upon the doorpost upon their house and upon the gates and that the days may be multiplied onto days multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord spared your fathers and give them and the days of Heaven upon the Earth and if Thou shalt diligently keep all these Commandments which I have commanded thee to do to love the Lord thy God Walk in his ways and to cleave unto him and I know what the devil just told you because I heard it he said well bless God this was the Old Testament and this was for Israel I'm sure glad he brought that up amen because I got hundreds of New Testaments but let's go to Joshua just to continue thought here here Joshua and I love this part if you ever see it amen I don't believe in worshiping your pastor and I don't believe in worshiping prophets either amen and Joshua at the beginning of Joshua he says Moses my servant is dead Moses was God to pharaoh you can't get much higher than that in God's chain was God to Pharaoh God told Moses he said why are you crying to me just speak it that's exactly what God's telling you this morning you need your healing you just speak it you say God it's mine you paid the price on Calvary it's already paid for it's all you got to do is withdraw it now I I use this in Uganda and maybe I mentioned this before I left but it came to me again he said your healing is like eating dinner at my table at home and my wife don't do this very often but I'm still training her but my mom used to put all the food on the table and we would pass it to the right or the left amen and the prophet said your healing sister Patricia's just like this say brother Dale will you pass the potatoes now you can see them sitting on the table hello I don't think you heard me you can see your healing sitting on the table and you say would you please nicely to Jesus would you please nicely pass me my healing he said that's exactly what it's like and I was doing without back up Lucifer I mean look at how easy it is for me to ask pasta pizza man and we were worried about our unsaved loved ones no hello and here so we're just a few chapters up and you know Joshua was a greater Warrior and the Bible than Moses ever was amen I'll say it for you now if you want to take that to the prophet and Moses that means you're a greater Warrior oh you didn't like that one God came through Moses but the Next Generation were greater Warriors than Moses bless God that's free it's still the truth because them without you ain't not made perfect amen you're fighting worse demons now than when our Prophet was here amen if you don't think so the 60s was a lot Tamer then as it is now well I let me rephrase that they're more active and exposed they're more in our face back then they were more shy they were in the closets so they may and probably were still around in our Prophets but they were hidden because they were bashful now they're not bashful amen but look at what God told the people and Joshua's time to do I'm trying to lay a foundation here and I'm going to shut her down soon because we got three or four Services of this but what I'm saying is the godwear servant even though he is super duper he still likes physical stuff brother Matt you know what I mean he still likes us to you know be decently dressed and he still likes women to wear women's clothes and men to wear men's clothes and the Bible says the other than that it's an Abomination which is just puke to God amen it's because it and you say well I don't believe God cares in our day this is why God cares it's very simple brother Dale don't care that's entirely up to you but in Genesis God took and and I almost lost my mind preaching in Uganda when I mentioned this but I said God God was going to make us but we were already in God this is I mean anything could happen now and God said to me God said to us well we weren't made yet but we were in him are you getting the picture this is the beginning of time there's no Earth or God had just made it he's he's almost feeling tired it's like the fifth day and God said to us me and you brother I said hey hey Matt and Dale why don't we make us hello I oh wow that's a lot different here than in Uganda I mean I said that like a thousand people just about lost their mind God said let us make you let us make you and so when God and we said okay that sounds good god let's make us because see I was in God and so God was talking to me because I was I was right there I was I heard the whole thing oh man you're daddy I heard the whole thing he said I'd like to make you and I you know I'm just sitting here to I said oh that sounds good God yeah let's try it out that's exactly how it is church it ain't more Super than that I mean if that ain't super enough for you like you you need a shot of something amen and then God so now I was made and and it was me and Luanne because see we were one it's exactly what the Bible says exactly I'm not making this up the same brother Dale's Doctrine it's not the doctrine of our church Brother Band said the Millennium you'll be with your your mate and he said if you made a mistake and got the wrong mate here if you happen to he said God will give you the right mate in the Millennium because all wrongs are made right and see you're incomplete not being this one and so I so God was making me and me and Luanne were standing there and we were like having a cool old time like just and he said hey by the way he said I'm going to pull the feminine Spirit out of you and I'll have masculine ugly and feminine beautiful and we said that sounds cool guy and so he took me and so I got a beautiful me and an ugly knee that was all right and he said okay because it's our way I want you to dress different because a man is like ugly I mean it's just the way it is you can't put a pretty face on an ugly person amen I mean they're trying to do that in plastic surgery but it hurts you know but then you got this and you know like the sisters brother Matt you know I'm talking like 60 year old sisters well come and get my plate I like brother Jose said the anointing around that atmosphere was like a unbully like if you were a man you could just hardly hear this is a and I don't mean lustful at all there was just so sweet that's so beautiful Satan has taught Womanhood a great big fat juicy lie and he's the Fat Liar of lice and his father was a fat liar of lice too that Womanhood is more Purdy with the masculine spirit rule on divorce number 10. that's disgusting it's just repulsive it just God and then you go to Uganda let's go you're free it's a feminine spirit and that feminine spirit came from God and God didn't plan on them being mixed and that's why he separated them and they won't be mixed again until they go back in him but when you're outside of him they're separate and you think we'll bless God the Womanhood is different today that's why when you see a man when he comes after your daughter's brother Matt and he's walked in like this kick them in the knee I'm serious because he's packing a feminist beer that's not God by the way not in a man but when you see his sweet beautiful girl and she's just beautiful in the eyes of God because she was a part of God and she's a feminine part of God and God just looks like oh God oh whoa what he said well bust God I don't believe in being I don't believe in a woman being a mad either I never one time in the Bible seen a queen be a doorman they were sitting right up beside the big old fat guy and most of the time in the Bible they said she had half the kingdom hello Satan's lying to somebody here Satan's lying to somebody here there's nothing wrong matter of fact it's beautiful to be a feminine and if God had made me a feminine before the foundation of the world I would have been the sweetest kneeling down feminine Spirit you ever did see because that's what God made that's what God was and that's what he made and that's what was in his thoughts it's just unbelievable that's why when I met brother Martins Sister Abigail I said I like that one restaurant because it's all beautiful sisters and they all got the little there's a special thing he's got to be a man to understand this I don't expect one to understand it because you can't figure out my brain and I ain't even going to try to figure out your brain but you have to have just a little flowers in a cotton dress and it just flows just you know and it's just a hair oh you know it's just like here's your suit so oh oh you go to one oh hey honey how are you doing today and that's exactly what God Said thoughts you saying brother Dale why do you think you have those thoughts because I came from God and God has the same thoughts that was free too I didn't have that in that spot here but amen let's look at Joshua 4 and we're going to read and again we're going to start at one and I want to show you where God's looking for physical stuff I'm trying to God is killing this devil where it says well God just sees my heart he knows I love him well God wants to maybe you know this is free but you know sometimes you wives need counseling because like see we made an agreement when me and the Wayne got married I can only share my testimony I'm sorry we agreed like ahead of time brother Matt that we neither one would change like that means if I open the car door before marriage I open the doctor because you don't know how to open it like how would you know how to open it because I open it you know I mean you see what I mean I like really drank out of one class in the restaurant a Pepsi you know and get a whole pizza and then we did that a while and and but see this is God when you become common with God or church or fantasies man I don't care if I say Amen I don't care if I clap let's go to the physical now my wife says well I don't care if I give you a little hug or give you a little peck on the cheek or you know touch you once in a while just put that to spiritual well you know don't really matter if I come late to church maybe I'll even miss a few times how many times I like to be without my honey I mean I didn't get married to live separate but God didn't get married to you spiritually to live separate and God likes to you know you hear me because God's real don't make God some far away like mystery no no God's real God likes it when you know God likes holding hands he said oh well we're not 18 anymore really God never changed see he he he ain't had no birthdays and we miss it because we've changed not God we I'm dignified I don't act like that in public I'm not talking about yeah there's nothing wrong with pressing God in public there's nothing wrong with someone whoa we've been lied to you've been lied to by Satan well God ain't into God ain't into all that no I'll show you what God ain't into and I was closed after I read a quote right after the scripture Joshua one and it came to pass it when all the people were clean passed over Jordan and that was a miracle on itself that the Lord spoke unto Joshua and he said take 12 men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command ye them saying put it in your heart so I can't see it but God can see it you know remember when Jesus was on Earth and Jesus said this is so you could hear the voice he said I didn't need to hear the voice when God spoke to him amen and he said take ye hats out of the midst of the Jordan and place where the priest's feet stood firm 12 Stones that you should carry them over with you and leave them in a lodging place where ye shall Lodge this night hello and Joshua called on to 12 men and prepared the children of Israel out of every tribe of man and Joshua said unto them Passover before the Ark of the Lord thy God into the midst of the Jordan and take ye up every man a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of Israel which were 12. and that this may be a sign unto your children that this may this is verse six that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in the time to pass what mean thou these stones hello why didn't God just say well just write it I'll remind you God could have reminded us God wanted something with skin on it called stones in this case to be a trophy for a miracle he did he was a show-off it's all right God can show off I'm not afraid to show off for God it ain't me that did it it's not me that did it my father in me that does it that's what Jesus said amen we need to step up to the play amen like listen like orphanage children might walk with their head down you know we're homeless hello but if you're converted you have parents and they're loaded spiritually speaking hello that this may be a sign on to you that when your children ask the fathers in the time saying that means father have to slow down enough that the children actually have time enough ask you what meaneth saw these Stones then thou shall answer them the Waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant in the springtime when it was above the brim of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan in the waters of the Jordan were cut off and these these Stones stand as a memorial but I'm still with us that I'm God of gods and King of Kings and if anybody asks what's going on you couldn't remind hello God wants you to remind your kids amen what did Peter say in the Bible I bring this in remembrance to your remembrance you were forgetting that God likes holding hands it's not a religion it's a relationship amen Hallelujah now not not that uh quote I'd read just before this I actually took another paragraph out of it and I'm going to close with these uh quotes and before my next scripture and he this was a in the 60 quote I just read previous he said the falling there's a great falling away and cooling off and there is everything there's a there's a great Falling Away story and cooling off but is there anything too hard for the Lord he said in the pair in a message in 63 the end of 63. he said he predicted that the spirits in this system would be so much like the real thing until it would deceive the very elected if possible and I skipped out one part and brother Brown talks your name that I'm I'm paraphrasing that I took out he said he talked about your names being in the Lamb's Book of Life now watch this Brother people ask brother Brown the prophet he said who's going to be there in the in the in heaven he said if your names are in the Lamb's Book of Life that means if you were a part of God you'll be there and listen to what the prophet said knowing and saying that the sentence before and frankly it's got to them so tied up until God said that if he didn't cut it short they're safe they're no flesh saved and I I uh please forgive me I had I had one on my on my phone and I'm just I'm closing with this quote and he said uh matter of fact I'm going to close my this was tied to the scriptures May 20 or I see 24. he's he made women different from men and men different from women and he dressed them different and wants them to stay that way and women wants to look like man and wants women and oh my that's where you get gay and lesbians the sex perversion he said and the whole thing looks like it's got It's gotta watch this he's talking about you and he said the whole thing looks like it's got a grip on the people and you can't change it I can't change it either that's why this place is mostly looks like a great monster and a great Blackness and if you understand what I'm speaking of it's in the spirit oh I wish our monsters got them grab I'm I'm reading you can have this is on my a monster's got them grabbed and they just can't get away from them and it's too much Hollywood too much television and too much other nonsense everything we've got on word for word everything you got is polluted whoa you wonder why the God's preaching on this no wonder if the work isn't cut short for the elect's sake there would be nobody come to this church in Wyoming I paraphrase that for the elect's sake there'd be no flesh safe you said I never known that before well now you know it from now on see You'd better stop doing that so bless God I'd never go there just wait till your grandkids are born God help me but stand man amen God help me what God was doing this morning was putting flesh on him because the devil has tried to distance God from us and he's tried to remove flesh even for healing and salvation of our lost ones and all that he's put God's way out there and I don't know if we can really get a grip on them Satan's done that not brother Dale Satan has and he's also put God way out there like well you know it really don't matter if we for us or really don't matter if we say Amen spiritually or Go whoo tell you what the Bible says that if he didn't go the God would have the stones do it for him lady came Father Brown said you know I really have trouble preaching when brother Dale goes brother Brown said I'd have a lot of trouble preaching if brother Dale didn't go woohoo it's another round just like the TV shows and the radio stations are passing right through here you turn on your Wi-Fi and it'll work so Satan's Wi-Fi and gods and it's a supernatural battle yes you'll need him to survive it but he's gave us a rule book and if we just do all we need to do in the rule book then we can just say hey it's like if you were a kid upstairs you'd say did you feed the calves you say yep I fed them everything's fine like the cap his head shot and dies they didn't think the kids fault they fed him that's how it is spiritual so did you do all my statues then it'll be fun amen God help the ones that aren't doing them God help them got to hold them there's no way they're going to say I didn't know God help him God help me amen it's actually what's humbling to me to know what I know about coming out of God and God actually asked in me and you permission or our counsel to make us and that same God would say if I didn't come quickly I wouldn't even be able to bring myself back to me oh wow man let's sing that song Amy amen how sweet to hold God's synthesis they called him Jesus Jesus he came to love heal and forgive a blood and died [Music] thank you oh thank you Lord make us faith is secular oh fear is gone [Music] and life is worth just because he lives [Music] baby baby and fear the pride I enjoy again my greatest [Music] this touch their face and uncertain days because he lives thank you tomorrow [Music] because it is [Music] gonna because I know yes I know and life is worth the living just because he lives and then one day Hallelujah I'll cross [Music] baby [Music] [Laughter] [Music] really is [Music] completely gone because I know yes I know [Music] religion and life is worth the living just healing and in our day God sent his Prophet Jesus [Music] is that he would say to prepare right Earth [Music] they prove that is [Music] Hallelujah because [Music] [Applause] I know yes I know the future The Living Just Because He Lives thank you Lord you can just play that softly I just want to read this quote we read at the beginning you will never make a believer as long as you're afraid to execute the authority that Jesus Christ gave you you're not praying for the victory you already have it it's time for you to throw your shoulders back [Music] I'm she amen I just have a couple prayer requests just to leave with you to bring up to your notice amen We're All in This Time gonna need Holy Spirit to help us serve thank you these things are now illegal in Canada punishment is for three to five years in prison offering pastoral or professional counseling to anyone considering transgendering including minors five years in prison teaching in the Bible studies that homosexual activity must be repented of five years prison our parents speak seeking counsel for their child who is engaging in homosexual activity whether online or in person rather in person or on the Internet five years prison refusing to allow your children do we free receive transgender surgery five years in prison means if the government listened to our video I would be eligible for five years that ain't coming that is law for all those that love your country wow wow and how do you how do you deal with that wow and two of the continents left in the world that are not this way continents continent of Africa and Russia if anybody was thinking of moving those would be two great places [Music] I've seen a post from a judge in a country in Africa I'm saying this if I proof Ace and the judge had broke their constitution and I listened to about a dozen Jared listened to him the people from the Senate the law writers of the country and they were going to force the judge to publicly repent and step down and the one person was saying that the West is trying to make us like animals and the Speaker of the House stopped them sits up he said I don't know any animals that act like that and he said you're a correct speaker I need to repent publicly to the Animal Kingdom the country in the continent of Africa and they compared these laws to the West or to North America Europe two places you don't want to live another prayer request we have to leave with you I'm sorry for leaving me with something like that but another prayer request we are praying for and most of my family know more about it I maybe will sit out we have a drawing here from Pastor Leo of a piece of property right behind the church with two houses on it and a bathroom I'm not asking you for nothing except prayer just just pray we have actually rented the one house for six months for the homeless family that was living in the Sunday school rooms and me and the land were just sitting there last night and it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks and I said something Luanne she said that it already hit me I said you know if something happens that we aren't able to buy this That Homeless family is going to have to come out of that house we just put them in so that would almost kill me I'd rather move out myself uh I did check with Leo Pastor Leo and he said they had miraculously been able to get a Triple Decker bunker that is a triple three high bunk beds made of steel and they had every person in their family was sleeping on a mattress most of them were new the three in the bunk bed the parents had bought a new mattress and they'd give their smaller one to one of the other kids Thrills my heart unbelievable but we're praying that something will happen the people are actually asking a large price but God can change the heart of a king he can change the heart of a couple kids amen but uh you say well what's the purpose in this I'm going to close with this there's two houses on that property so potentially two families could live there that are homeless by the church which would also make them caretakers or security for the church and they also is enough ground that those same two families could almost grow their entire living off the ground that would be purchased amen but we want God's world Amen and all that that's don't mean man if we're not to have it we want God to block it take it away but uh it seems like it would be good for the family of God in that area we also our long-term Vision the church is almost completely completed is our long-term vision is to put in regular standard while not quite North American bathrooms but almost with showers in the center of the floor so the sisters and the brothers could use a regular bathroom that didn't smell and they could literally shower in a regular shower at the church let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts Lord Jesus just thank you for your presence and anointing and thank you for the beautiful people that are here Lord Jesus be with our fellowship after and anything that we do this day may we just meditate and think on these thoughts Lord Jesus your name we pray amen thank you
