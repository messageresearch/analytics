[23:59] Lord of God is upon me because the Lord
[24:02] has anointed me to preach the Good
[24:04] Tidings unto the meek and he has sent me
[24:06] to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim
[24:09] Proclaim Liberty to the captive and to
[24:11] open the prison to them that are bound
[24:13] and to proclaim the acceptable year of
[24:16] the Lord the day of Vengeance of our God
[24:19] to comfort all that mourn and to appoint
[24:22] to them that mourn in Zion and to give
[24:25] unto them Beauty for Ashes and oil
[24:29] of the joy for mourning and the Garment
[24:31] of Praise And The Spirit of heaviness
[24:34] that they might be called the Trees of
[24:37] Righteousness the planting of the Lord
[24:40] God that
[24:44] God that God might be glorified Lord
[24:48] Jesus we pray that you would have your
[24:50] way in everything that's done today
[24:53] everything that's done and said and Lord
[24:56] we're not sure this might be a part two
[24:58] two or part one of part two and whatever
[25:01] your will is Lord God we pray you'll Fe
[25:04] feed us your Mana we pray amen God bless
[25:07] you you may have your
[25:09] seats man I want to preach on the plans
[25:12] of God for us and God has plans for us
[25:17] and you know we were we preached uh the
[25:19] last time I was up a couple weeks ago we
[25:21] were preaching on you know the cop Stone
[25:23] and add to your faith virtue and and you
[25:25] know in in second Peter fir uh 1 for it
[25:29] was that we were given exceeding
[25:31] precious
[25:33] promises but it was our choice whether
[25:35] we accept or stepped into them and when
[25:39] we step into those exceeding precious
[25:42] promises we might become partakers of
[25:45] the divine nature of God and so I want
[25:49] to I have a question for you and I don't
[25:52] mean it's for us but you know in the
[25:54] natural we live in a world that we have
[25:57] the best hospital
[26:03] we had the best doctors we have the best
[26:08] medications and we've never had a world
[26:10] more sick than we have in this world the
[26:12] Indians were miles ahead of
[26:15] us but now let's look spiritually you
[26:17] know spiritually speaking we have never
[26:20] had a message like this we have never
[26:23] had a revelation like this we have never
[26:26] had the internet that spreads all the
[26:27] great m messages around the world that
[26:29] you can listen to on a daily
[26:32] basis like this day we have never had
[26:35] the word unfold and like the prophet
[26:37] said it became a brand new book to us
[26:40] and in that exact same day we have never
[26:42] had a colder Church a more lukewarm
[26:45] Church we've never had people and
[26:47] Believers so stagnated and Frozen in
[26:51] their their their
[26:55] life with all of the revelation
[26:58] and the perfect message which is
[27:01] Christ he didn't like
[27:03] nothing that's right you know if we ever
[27:05] come to a revelation and we come into
[27:07] the full position of Christ you will
[27:09] lose your mind when you come
[27:11] together you'll be the noisiest Church
[27:14] brother Bram said when you get to heaven
[27:15] you'll be the noisiest place you've ever
[27:17] been but by Bible says we're living in
[27:19] Heavenly places now so something's all
[27:21] messed up something's all messed up cuz
[27:24] we're not living in Heavenly places if
[27:26] it's not like heaven now
[27:29] come on Amen and there's one reason for
[27:32] all of that it one of maybe two or three
[27:35] reasons but one is either you don't have
[27:37] a
[27:39] sacrifice or you don't have a fresh
[27:41] sacrifice you're not in a living
[27:44] relationship with Christ where he's
[27:46] number one and it don't matter to you if
[27:48] the bills are paid or the kids are sick
[27:50] or the car's got a flat tire it don't
[27:52] matter to you if the if the church is
[27:54] full or empty it don't matter to you if
[27:56] it's Wednesday night or Sunday morning
[28:00] amen you're serving God and you know the
[28:02] Bible says that he Jesus praised the
[28:06] father he said I I thank you God that
[28:08] you hid it from the wise and prudent and
[28:10] revealed it unto babes and I want to
[28:12] show you in the Bible the things that
[28:13] God expected us to reach out and grab on
[28:16] to the exceedingly precious and great
[28:19] promises you
[28:21] know we have to have him Lord of our
[28:23] life not just savior of our life we have
[28:26] to have him Lord of our life not just
[28:27] healer of our life we have to have him
[28:29] Lord of our life not just provider of
[28:31] our life we have to have him Lord of our
[28:33] life not just for in the Happy
[28:36] Times amen and we see an example and I'm
[28:39] just going to use this example quickly
[28:40] in Genesis 22 where Abraham God gave him
[28:44] and I'm I'm just I'm just going to be
[28:47] blind I I I pray this don't offend you
[28:49] and God you forgive me ahead of time but
[28:51] God gave Abraham a ridiculous plan an
[28:54] insane plan
[28:58] murder murder your family member it was
[29:02] the most insane ridiculous
[29:04] plan maybe ever recorded in the
[29:08] Bible but the Bible says and when we
[29:11] were talking about Saul that obedience
[29:13] was better than
[29:14] sacrifice and you know God has some most
[29:17] ridiculous man you know coming to church
[29:18] on Wednesday night when it's minus 20 is
[29:21] an exceedingly insane plan it's
[29:24] exceedingly ridiculous and it's maybe
[29:25] could be almost murder but that was part
[29:28] of God's plan says forsake not the
[29:31] assembling of yourself together the
[29:32] Bible says pray without ceasing that
[29:35] means every day that means all the time
[29:37] that means not just when it's Wednesday
[29:40] night amen you know brother Bram said
[29:42] and I'm way miles ahead of my quote but
[29:44] you know brother Bram said you say why I
[29:46] wonder why the church is so Dad when's
[29:48] the last time you prayed and
[29:50] fasted brother Bram said the only reason
[29:52] for the benefit of his meanings was
[29:54] because of the people that fasted and
[29:56] prayed and I have quotes here where he
[29:57] talked about sisters that had fasted and
[30:00] prayed for 8 days and he specifically
[30:02] called them out in the meanings because
[30:03] they had prayed and fasted when's the
[30:05] last time you fasted for your pastor
[30:07] when was the last time your pastor
[30:09] fasted for
[30:10] you are we living in Heavenly places or
[30:12] are we just pretending you know when you
[30:15] look at this he said the fasting in the
[30:17] natural naturally it's called the tonomy
[30:20] and it's a 24 hours in 24 hours it it
[30:23] does a a cleaning process I does the
[30:26] church ever need a cleaning process
[30:28] process woo the cleaning process you
[30:30] just got to fast for me for 24 hours
[30:33] this whole place will be cleaned out
[30:34] amen a cleaning process and after 24
[30:37] hours it starts removing
[30:39] cells of
[30:41] cancer and sicknesses and the Aging
[30:46] autonomy is removed under the period and
[30:49] it goes up
[30:53] 300% after fasting 36 hours
[31:00] but because we don't do
[31:02] that are we grabbing on to the
[31:05] exceedingly impresses promises you know
[31:07] these were just simple basic things that
[31:09] God put in the word and so now we can
[31:11] watch the greatest ministers in the
[31:13] world on internet what's it done for us
[31:15] it's made us cold indifferent formal
[31:20] LAX
[31:22] amen
[31:24] amen and all these great things it's
[31:27] because you hav't prayed you haven't
[31:29] fasted you haven't come to church on
[31:31] Wednesday night you haven't you haven't
[31:34] done the multiple things you know you
[31:36] know the Bible says you know I was
[31:37] saying this you know in a honeymoon
[31:39] period and and and I mentioned this on
[31:42] Wednesday night about a month ago in
[31:44] anything that starts new there's all
[31:46] kinds of things done in
[31:48] secret when you're in your honeymoon or
[31:50] you're starting a new business even when
[31:52] the country started all kinds of people
[31:54] would do things in secret with no intent
[31:57] to be seen on the
[32:00] Internet Bible says that if you enter
[32:03] into your closet and pray in secret God
[32:05] will reward now I'll guarantee you I'll
[32:07] take
[32:08] God's beneficiary plan God said what you
[32:10] do in secret if you would enter in your
[32:12] closet and pray in secret that he will
[32:15] reward you openly and we're supposed to
[32:16] be living in Heavenly places so we're
[32:18] supposed to have all these exceeding and
[32:20] great and precious
[32:22] promises
[32:24] maybe our closets got dust on them like
[32:27] our Bibles
[32:28] come on Amen maybe we haven't been doing
[32:32] these things in secret brother Brown
[32:34] said when you pray arms to do them in
[32:36] secret not to let your right hand know
[32:37] what your left hand does it's not for
[32:39] the minister not for the it's for the
[32:41] kingdom of God for the edifying of God's
[32:44] body
[32:46] amen some of the greatest times that
[32:48] we've had in this church in the last
[32:50] year have been on Wednesday
[32:51] night and I know for a fact that there's
[32:54] some of you that absolutely cannot in
[32:56] the physical place and that that you
[32:58] live could be here but there's many of
[33:01] you half of you that make a medical and
[33:05] calculated decision every Wednesday
[33:06] night to stay home and watch I Love
[33:14] Lucy because you have brother Brown said
[33:18] because your love for that is greater
[33:20] than your love for your
[33:23] sacrifice you're not coming Wednesday
[33:25] night to see me cuz I'm
[33:29] we're not even coming Wednesday night to
[33:31] see each
[33:32] other we're not even coming Wednesday
[33:34] night to see what you think God will
[33:37] do we're coming Wednesday night in
[33:39] obedience to the plan of God to unfold
[33:43] these great and exceeding and precious
[33:46] promises and what we do in
[33:49] secret God will reward us openly and the
[33:53] ones that do those things in secret are
[33:55] why they have the most Victorious Life
[33:58] and the most happy family in
[34:02] home God help us God help
[34:06] me did there you know we either have go
[34:09] no sacrifice or we don't have a fresh
[34:13] sacrifice and I would say in most cases
[34:14] we don't have a fresh sacrifice and that
[34:17] brings a lack of discipline and lack of
[34:19] Desire lack of commitment and we just
[34:21] well you know yeah
[34:24] yeah but you know when you start out
[34:27] something new and you start out your
[34:28] marriage life you're very sacrificed you
[34:29] have a great commitment you do all kinds
[34:32] of things hidden behind the scenes to
[34:35] make it wonderful but what happens is
[34:38] this
[34:39] word and the presence of the anointing
[34:42] you know the Bible says that those that
[34:43] have felt the presence of the anointing
[34:45] and leave it there's no sacrifice for
[34:47] them the reason being is because it
[34:49] became come
[34:52] man the greatest thing in the world that
[34:54] ever struck the world is what you're
[34:56] living in right now and the the
[34:58] revelation of the Bible there's not a
[35:00] people walking on the earth that has
[35:02] even a
[35:04] fraction of the Revelation and unfolding
[35:08] of the word that you
[35:12] have but what could a minister tell
[35:16] me what could anybody tell
[35:19] me you know brother Brown said you know
[35:22] you know he has two quot I you love
[35:24] things like this he said and this is at
[35:26] the tail and I wasn't even sure I was he
[35:28] said you know if you say well I got the
[35:30] Holy Ghost and and the Holy Ghost is a
[35:32] teacher so I don't need anybody to teach
[35:33] you he actually says two things very
[35:36] strong there and I I desperately love
[35:37] our Prophet he's such a amazing person
[35:40] he says number one I doubt your
[35:42] experience that means you have no
[35:43] sacrifice and he said you know the other
[35:45] thing he said on that and this will
[35:47] offend you and it offended me too so you
[35:49] know we'll be sitting right side by side
[35:50] he said you need your brains
[35:56] baptized you're you're so out to L you
[35:58] need your brains baptized more than your
[36:01] soul like basically the prophet saying
[36:04] you're
[36:08] and that's how we've tried to
[36:10] serve him by not obeying God's word and
[36:12] not falling into lineing all these
[36:14] things it's not just one part you know
[36:16] that in it's in 1 Corinthians you can
[36:18] pull this out 1 Corinthians 131-10 and
[36:21] verse 13 He says though I speak with
[36:23] tongues of angels and have not charity I
[36:25] become as a sounding brass and tinkling
[36:26] symbol and though I have the gifts of
[36:28] Prophecy and understand all the
[36:30] Mysteries which we do and know have the
[36:32] knowledge we have the knowledge and
[36:34] though I have faith all this great faith
[36:37] so I could remove
[36:38] mountains and we do remove mountains CU
[36:41] we've had healings in our midst great
[36:42] healings and have not charity I am
[36:45] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[36:47] to the poor and you you give your money
[36:48] like you wouldn't believe and though I
[36:51] give my body to be burned and have not
[36:52] charity it profit me nothing now I want
[36:54] you to go to verse four and I want to go
[36:57] through this
[37:00] slowly love
[37:04] suffers Amen period that means you're
[37:08] going to do things for God that aren't
[37:11] exciting that means fast pray in your
[37:14] closet and I won't even know you're
[37:15] praying for me till God rewards you
[37:18] openly I me come to church on Wednesday
[37:21] night and say w Glory brother Dale's
[37:23] going to minister and then we're all
[37:25] going to get to pray
[37:30] that's right
[37:32] really well I'm so excited to pray would
[37:35] you rather not be able to pray would you
[37:37] be like the people that God don't have a
[37:39] sacrifice and he don't have to answer
[37:41] your prayer you may be lived in that
[37:43] world for a while you'd be really happy
[37:45] to get in the other
[37:46] world love
[37:49] suffers and it don't just suffer for a
[37:51] few years it don't just suffer for the
[37:54] honeymoon it don't suffer till I feeling
[37:56] better it don't suffer until I think
[37:58] everybody's lined up to my Doctrine It
[38:00] suffers
[38:04] long and it's kind uhoh o you mean I got
[38:09] to be kind to that person oh they give
[38:11] me a headache where a pill would
[38:15] reach and charity envieth not that means
[38:20] it don't matter who's on the internet I
[38:23] I'm not concerned about being the center
[38:25] of attention do you know I I want to
[38:26] tell you something that you might be
[38:27] surprised this ain't a oneman Ministry
[38:30] and a pastor ain't a oneman Ministry and
[38:33] we're not writing a movie and I'm not
[38:34] the only person in the script just to
[38:37] let you know we're all in the script
[38:40] together amen if you don't say Amen
[38:42] brother Bram said I couldn't even preach
[38:44] if you didn't say amen that's right we
[38:46] need a good dose of
[38:49] heat man we should praise God it's our
[38:52] Lord we're praising it's our savior
[38:54] we're PR oh blessed be the name of oh
[38:57] Lord
[38:59] oh I ain't got my bills
[39:05] paid I told you I confessed it to
[39:07] literally it took me two Sundays to come
[39:09] back and get used to preaching after I
[39:11] was in Nicaragua in El Salvador that you
[39:14] would have to be a minister to
[39:16] understand what that's like it was like
[39:17] a like it was like a punch in the head
[39:20] some of the same ministers messages I
[39:22] preached there that were 3 hours long
[39:24] and people were like exploding I
[39:25] preached here in 40 minutes and
[39:27] I went home and I didn't know if anybody
[39:29] cared about
[39:35] him love vth not itself well bless God
[39:40] that's not the way I would run
[39:43] everything it's not puffed up it does
[39:47] not behave itself unseemingly and it
[39:49] does not seek it its own well if they're
[39:51] not going to do it the way I see it well
[39:52] like I'm not going to stay there you
[39:54] know there's one other reason why the
[39:57] the the world and the in the situation
[40:00] is cold it's either because they have no
[40:02] sacrifice they don't have a fresh
[40:06] sacrifice or you're not in the place
[40:08] where you want to
[40:09] be let me explain that you know and and
[40:13] I I don't mean I don't mean that here
[40:15] because I don't I don't feel that but in
[40:17] churches where people are going because
[40:19] it's too far to go to their favorite
[40:21] church if you're coming here just
[40:23] because it's within driving range and
[40:25] you would rather be at
[40:28] that
[40:29] church that's why you come here and
[40:31] you're
[40:34] like oh
[40:37] wow I wished I could be there but God
[40:39] ain't allowed me to move can't afford to
[40:42] I don't have a job there oh why they
[40:46] even have specials on Wednesday night
[40:48] and got five Pastors in their church
[40:54] and that's another reason the body gets
[40:57] stagnant cold sour indifferent cuz you
[41:02] don't even desire really to be here
[41:05] that's why so few come on Wednesday
[41:07] night because it's not your favorite
[41:09] Church you either have no sacrifice or
[41:11] it's not your favorite church and the
[41:12] other churches have a bigger deal on
[41:14] Wednesday night and so I'll stay home
[41:17] watch it on
[41:20] internet
[41:22] amen easily provoked thinkest no evil
[41:26] rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in
[41:29] the truth and beareth all things
[41:31] believeth all things hopeth all things
[41:34] and doth all things
[41:36] love love never fails so if we have love
[41:41] that means we're in Heavenly places
[41:43] right now and and like you know noise
[41:46] don't scare
[41:47] me disorderly don't scare me we could
[41:51] use a little
[41:52] disorderly if we were worshiping God
[41:55] Amen never scared me
[42:00] bet how come we think that brother Bram
[42:03] was so right but we don't obey what he
[42:05] he said said I couldn't even preach you
[42:08] don't say amen I can't hear you amen I
[42:12] can't I couldn't even I couldn't even
[42:14] preach if you didn't pray and fast for
[42:16] me it's like well you know like you know
[42:21] I didn't expect it anyway you know the
[42:23] Bible
[42:24] says here in John 15:2 it says every
[42:28] branch that beareth forth fruit he
[42:30] taketh away from now watch this this
[42:33] means every branch that beareth forth he
[42:35] cuts you that means if you're bearing
[42:38] fruit this morning for Jesus Christ he's
[42:39] going to hurt you he's going to hurt
[42:43] you he's going to hurt you he's going to
[42:45] offend you God's going to offend you it
[42:47] ain't me we don't wrestle against flesh
[42:49] and blood but against principalities and
[42:51] Powers God's allowing it to happen to
[42:54] offend you so you can bring for wor much
[42:57] fruit I'm not saying leave the word I
[42:59] don't say I'm not saying for one minute
[43:01] you sit under me or anybody that's off
[43:04] the word you run for your
[43:05] life that you you you that's the only
[43:08] way you can survive is on the word but
[43:11] if you're on the word God's going to cut
[43:13] you and you're not going to like it you
[43:16] say well but bless God I was happy just
[43:19] serving you as a modern day Chris I
[43:22] didn't really want to get involved I
[43:25] didn't really want to sing a special I
[43:26] didn't really ever want to testify or do
[43:29] communion or foot wash I don't want to
[43:31] get in that
[43:35] [Music]
[43:37] messy John
[43:39] 152 he purges it so it will bring much
[43:43] more fruit I say bring on the Cotton
[43:45] snippers just bring on the snippers snip
[43:49] me and snip me and snip me that's the
[43:52] only way we're going to live in Heavenly
[43:53] places you know in John Revelations here
[43:56] John
[43:57] he said the angel said to John come up
[44:00] hither and I'll show you things which
[44:02] must surely come to pass the reason
[44:04] we're not coming up we're not quiet
[44:06] enough for him to ever speak to us you
[44:09] know John was in the island of pment
[44:11] that was his prison yes he had nothing
[44:14] to do but serve God and God could speak
[44:18] to him because he wasn't worried about
[44:24] the I know perfectly well the om is bad
[44:28] I know many people are out of work and
[44:30] many people that do got work don't have
[44:32] enough money I'm sitting right beside
[44:39] you come up hither and I'll show you
[44:42] what here must be Hereafter and
[44:44] immediately John was in the spirit you
[44:46] know what takes time to get in the
[44:47] spirit of God you can't just wake up and
[44:50] you know it's a
[44:52] preparation what you did last week's
[44:54] affecting the service today what you did
[44:57] last week what you did yesterday is
[44:59] really affecting what you did in this
[45:01] service but what you did all week is the
[45:04] fact that here brother Brown said he
[45:06] said the world is forced this way and
[45:07] that way but God forces his up whereare
[45:09] the spirit of God it it which is the
[45:11] word of God is my word is spirit and
[45:14] life and the
[45:15] bride and th will put the bride in her
[45:18] place cuz she'll recognize the position
[45:21] in the
[45:23] word and she is in Christ and it'll put
[45:26] her in her PL
[45:27] here you know and I'm just going through
[45:30] examples in the Bible because we don't
[45:32] like all of the Bible or all of the
[45:34] message in first uh Thessalonians it
[45:37] says pray without ceasing most of us
[45:40] never pray many don't even have a prayer
[45:43] life I don't mean on your knees you can
[45:46] pray anywhere you can pray walking
[45:48] riding a truck driving a semi you can
[45:50] pray in bed amen the first thing you can
[45:52] do when you wake up is oh Lord help me
[45:55] help me I I do that as soon as I wake up
[45:58] before I move I'm
[46:04] praying we already went through the
[46:06] fasting and that's in that's in Matthew
[46:09] 17:14 to2 24 and here that Jesus told
[46:11] the disciples they came and now now
[46:14] Jesus had sent now these were right that
[46:16] had walked with Jesus e like they had a
[46:18] relationship like they were they went to
[46:20] prayer meeting on Wednesday night and
[46:23] Jesus sent them out endued with power
[46:26] and they couldn't throw out these demons
[46:28] they came to Jesus that actually the
[46:30] person with them came to Jesus said can
[46:32] you save me and Jesus did and then the
[46:35] disciples said why can't we do that why
[46:37] can't we sit in Heavenly places right
[46:39] now in Wyoming when it's cold it's CU
[46:40] cuz you don't
[46:43] fast cuz this part only happens by
[46:47] prayer and
[46:48] fasting that's why that's Matthew 172
[46:51] 24- 21 how be it this kind goe with I
[46:55] out except by prayer and fasting
[46:58] here the prophet says he says you you
[47:00] know your pastor can't do everything it
[47:02] takes the members of the church he said
[47:05] help support the
[47:08] meaning he's actually he said you
[47:10] support the meanings with your Finance
[47:12] you support it with your prayers he said
[47:13] two little women here hit away these
[47:15] eight days of the meaning fasting and
[47:17] praying for the meanings he said that's
[47:18] the reason that these meanings today are
[47:20] a success they said because those two
[47:23] sisters he said not only them but there
[47:25] was others that been fasting
[47:29] fasting fasting and praying backing me
[47:33] up with your wonderful
[47:35] faith of Jesus
[47:38] Christ here talking about prayer the
[47:41] what God sees in secret we already
[47:43] mentioned that he will reward you openly
[47:45] that's also in Matthew
[47:47] 6 God help us here the prophet mentions
[47:51] again he said the success of our
[47:52] meanings is because real godly people
[47:55] pray
[48:00] and that's it that's the reason of
[48:02] success of the
[48:03] meetings
[48:08] prayers and you we know we already
[48:10] mentioned that you know the every new
[48:13] movement every new church age every new
[48:16] secret of
[48:17] success was
[48:19] because of people doing stuff behind the
[48:22] scenes but our attitude today is well
[48:24] that's not my job God never called me to
[48:27] preach I don't feel I'm a prayer
[48:32] Warrior I don't see no benefit to that
[48:35] how's it going to help
[48:38] me is it going to affect my
[48:45] family we've lost the
[48:48] attraction and it ain't to
[48:51] Wyoming cuz Wyoming can be ugly we've
[48:54] lost the attraction to Christ we've lost
[48:57] the attraction that he's our Lord we've
[49:00] lost the attraction that he's everything
[49:02] he's your living desire you know you
[49:05] know you know I'm having a birthday
[49:08] today but it's been real winter and I've
[49:11] been looking over pictures and I'll just
[49:14] tell you what I don't care if you're
[49:15] five you're getting
[49:17] old you're getting old time is a
[49:20] blur you know I had pictures out there

[49:24] dad were hiding me and we were in what
[49:26] Prince Edward Island or
[49:28] somewhere
[49:30] Sudbury I had an uncle lived there life
[49:33] is a blur tomorrow you'll be in the
[49:36] destination that you prepared
[49:38] for but because of the the the the the
[49:43] LIE of Satan that makes us come in and
[49:46] get so subtle and subdued and like
[49:49] become common I pray to God that we'll
[49:52] never become calm and that like well
[49:54] that's just you know that's just sister
[49:57] Donna that's just brother Carson oh you
[49:59] know I mean we that's just brother Matt
[50:03] you know that's just brother Lauren you
[50:07] know are we going to get to heaven and
[50:09] say well that's just that's just brother
[50:11] Lauren we're in heaven like you know
[50:14] well I don't think you'll say
[50:18] that Hebrews 10 23 and 25 says hold let
[50:22] us hold fast to the profession of our
[50:25] faith without wavering we been doing a
[50:27] lot of
[50:28] wavering yeah yeah a lot of
[50:31] wavering to reach out and grab the
[50:33] exceedingly exceedingly and great and
[50:36] precious promises look at how the Bible
[50:38] writes that exceedingly and great and
[50:40] precious by prayer and
[50:47] fasting hold fast to A procession
[50:49] without wavering for he that is faithful
[50:51] the promis considered one another
[50:53] provoke each other to love and good
[50:56] works not forsaking the assembling of
[50:58] yourself together and the manner that
[51:00] some is but exhorting one another and so
[51:03] much more as you see the day
[51:08] approaching you know we're the only
[51:11] country in the world where we only
[51:13] gather
[51:19] twice and most the places I go to preach
[51:21] they have four Services a week I don't
[51:24] save you but it shows where their
[51:27] expectations are it shows where their
[51:29] desire is it shows where their things
[51:32] are shows it shows exactly where they
[51:34] are I I'm actually last weekend was
[51:36] supposed to be in the Philippines I was
[51:38] invited to preach an anniversary
[51:40] meetings they would have Wednesday
[51:43] Sunday Friday night prayer meeting a
[51:45] Friday night prayer meeting is just like
[51:47] standard
[51:49] equipment every church I've ever been in
[51:52] as a Friday night prayer meeting
[51:57] but that's party
[52:02] night Psalms 22 says I was glad when
[52:05] they said unto me let us go into the
[52:07] house of the Lord can you imagine us
[52:08] starting a Friday night prayer and
[52:09] saying Oh Glory Hallelujah I get to go
[52:12] to
[52:17] church if you're not there you either
[52:20] have no sacrifice or your sacrifice is
[52:23] so old there ain't even hot coals in it
[52:26] it it's just
[52:34] ashes here our Prophet says America has
[52:37] gone completely
[52:39] crazy people stay home pleasure crazy
[52:42] sorry I forget I forgot my main word
[52:44] America has gone completely pressure
[52:46] crazy people stay home on Wednesday
[52:48] night a prayer meeting to watch I love
[52:51] Loosely and jokes
[53:01] he talking about staying here here on
[53:03] Wednesday night he said if the Holy
[53:04] Spirit was had your heart full he said
[53:07] you'd have no more desire to stay home
[53:09] and watch I love Loosely instead of go
[53:11] to prayer meeting he said the love of
[53:14] the world takes away the love of God
[53:17] that's in the
[53:19] people he said why does people want to
[53:21] stay home and watch steping program get
[53:23] to go the prayer meeting he said it is
[53:27] what we want to do is because the
[53:30] joy in the house of the Lord is gone
[53:35] right but the joy in the house of the
[53:37] Lord comes from your life and my
[53:40] life don't don't expect brother Dale to
[53:43] bring the joy of the house of the Lord
[53:44] no no no no no no no that's not how it
[53:47] works you bring the joy in cuz you're
[53:50] 50% of the ministry so if this ministry
[53:54] fails you're sitting right beside beside
[53:56] me in the Judgment
[53:58] Day because you never prayed for me you
[54:01] never fasted for me and you never said
[54:04] amen Glory Hallelujah and run around the
[54:06] aisle and clap your
[54:08] hands that's
[54:10] right that's the joy of the
[54:12] Lord
[54:14] yes see the joy of the Lord ain't
[54:17] because you got a Hollywood Pastor some
[54:19] of the greatest Minister brother Bram
[54:21] was
[54:27] his wife read his scriptures he was such
[54:29] a poor
[54:31] reader you would never vote him in for
[54:33] your pastor no he can't even
[54:37] read that's
[54:41] right d Moody he spit and sputtered
[54:49] and but they had the joy of the Lord
[54:51] there wasn't because they were coming to
[54:53] see Dwight Moody wasn't because they
[54:55] were coming to see brother
[54:57] Brown brother Brown says why cuz people
[55:00] prayed and fasted back
[55:02] then God help us God help me he said a
[55:07] coldness and damp this cold dampness and
[55:10] we're going to we're going to other
[55:13] places of pleasure pleasure instead of
[55:16] coming to the house of God for pleasure
[55:19] how many of you think that it's
[55:21] pleasurable to come to
[55:23] church thank you thank you but here here
[55:27] the prophet saying and why this is a 61
[55:28] message he said the coldness and D he
[55:31] said well let me start at the beginning
[55:32] but because that we do this and the
[55:35] reason we're cursed and the reason that
[55:37] God put this thing on the church is this
[55:40] coldness and dampness that we find pres
[55:42] pleasure other places instead of coming
[55:45] to the house of the Lord for
[55:48] pleasure oh that preacher was so
[55:51] terrible oh I agree I asked brother Matt
[55:55] and brother Carson both to Preach Today
[55:57] I don't think it's scriptural for a
[55:59] pastor to preach on their
[56:00] birthday but I mean I got turned down so
[56:03] it must be all
[56:05] right but you see what I mean it wasn't
[56:08] that they came to get pleasure they
[56:10] brought pleasure with them they were
[56:12] fellowshipping in God on their own
[56:14] private life this ain't we're not Israel
[56:17] we're not Jews God don't save this
[56:19] church collectively it's an individual
[56:21] walk if you ain't happy this morning
[56:24] it's your fault it ain't my fault
[56:28] Glory God's exactly the same yesterday
[56:31] today and forever what are you
[56:34] eating you become what you
[56:36] eat that's right the Bible says go into
[56:39] all the world and preach the gospel to
[56:41] Every Creature you know I mentioned
[56:43] before you know and and I I would you
[56:46] know I you know a known man or a dad or
[56:50] anybody you know you you get wisdom and
[56:52] if if your kids have any brains at all
[56:54] they'll they'll ask for some of that
[56:55] wisdom and if they they don't well you
[56:57] just sit back and watch them have a
[56:58] train
[57:00] wreck but I told a pastor not long ago I
[57:02] said you know God never called us to
[57:04] build churches in other
[57:09] countries we built some ouch I don't
[57:13] like that
[57:15] scripture God didn't call us to build CH
[57:17] schools cemeteries God never told us
[57:20] called us to build houses for other
[57:22] people you know what he called us to do
[57:25] he called us all to either get in an
[57:27] airplane and go preach the gospel and if
[57:29] you
[57:30] can you pay somebody else's
[57:33] way I'm going to tell you something
[57:35] that'll offend you brother G Garett told
[57:37] me last week he had somebody come and
[57:38] give him money for his whole trip to I
[57:40] said never once in my life if I had one
[57:42] person one person give me one penny to
[57:45] go anywhere to
[57:51] preach not one penny every penny that I
[57:55] went and got an airplane I paid
[57:56] personally out of myself I'm so broke it
[57:58] ain't even
[58:01] funny going into all the world preach
[58:03] the gospel I asked John Garrett I said
[58:05] the person that give you the the the
[58:07] money to go preach the gospel and he
[58:09] he's already got somebody that's going
[58:11] to donate he actually already got money
[58:13] to go to Nicaragua somebody had already
[58:14] give money to nicaragu said do they go
[58:15] to your church he said nope I said you
[58:17] need to change
[58:22] churches that's us say brother Dale
[58:26] God gives you the gift the people that
[58:28] feed you that's the people you go by
[58:30] fellowship
[58:34] with go into all the world and preach
[58:36] the gospel you
[58:38] know so God didn't call us to buy lands
[58:40] and houses for other people you know
[58:42] what breaks my heart when we go to these
[58:43] places people have
[58:46] nothing but because we've done some of
[58:48] the other things I can't make as many
[58:50] trips as I
[58:52] have and God gave me a little spank and
[58:54] I passed it on to some min and they said
[58:57] watch watch all watch all religion oh
[58:59] but you know God knew your heart and he
[59:01] knew that it was a really good thing no
[59:02] no no no we can't leave the
[59:04] word we can't leave the word you don't
[59:07] have to give one penny for a roof or a
[59:09] house or a church you show me one
[59:11] scripture where God said give somebody
[59:13] money for a roof or a house or a
[59:16] foundation or a church or a school now
[59:18] brother bam said that's okay and and and
[59:20] and that but if you do that and then you
[59:22] can't go on a missionary trip
[59:26] and so I had people ask me like right
[59:28] now in the Philippines I said you know
[59:29] what I told the I said I can't afford to
[59:32] come and then God said but you did
[59:36] this and you should have did this and
[59:40] because you did this you can't do
[59:42] that uhhuh I don't like
[59:44] spanking and I definitely don't like
[59:46] them from
[59:47] God cuz they they have a way of really
[59:51] stinging amen we got to be scripturally
[59:55] based man God help us amen Jesus came
[59:58] saying unto
[1:00:01] them in Matthew 28 another scripture the
[1:00:04] same way go into all the world and teach
[1:00:06] All Nations baptizing them amen God help
[1:00:10] us also another thing that we've lost so
[1:00:12] much of the
[1:00:14] time is Hebrews 12:14 he says
[1:00:18] follow peace with all men now the
[1:00:21] world's Dying For Love it's dying for
[1:00:23] peace and holiness and without no man
[1:00:27] shall see God we're going
[1:00:32] to I want to change by the church
[1:00:37] world is leaving the presence of God in
[1:00:39] a hand basket because they've left
[1:00:43] Holiness
[1:00:45] Holiness dress wear and
[1:00:49] character now there's some women and men
[1:00:52] do you see I I pick on the men you see
[1:00:55] some preachers that they got a tuxedo
[1:00:57] suit on and it cost
[1:00:59] $1,000 and they got a tongue of
[1:01:01] backbiting and gossip that's as long as
[1:01:05] touch the
[1:01:06] floor but Holiness is character and
[1:01:11] dress I wouldn't give you 5 cents for
[1:01:13] one of these Harlot that walk
[1:01:16] down the street and show everything
[1:01:18] everything God valued he
[1:01:20] hid everything got and the bride of
[1:01:23] Christ he's also hiding by the way if
[1:01:25] you come you H just happen to be going
[1:01:27] by Wednesday night I'm going to preach
[1:01:29] on why we're the wife of Christ this
[1:01:30] Wednesday you know that's something else
[1:01:32] God whipped me for I would try to
[1:01:35] prepare for Wednesday night and I said
[1:01:36] but God there's only going to be five
[1:01:37] people there God said don't matter I'll
[1:01:40] preach my best men SES on Wednesday
[1:01:42] night and what you get whatever's left
[1:01:44] over on Sunday cuz see God ain't a
[1:01:46] respector of the day he's not a
[1:01:49] respector of the day or the hour or that
[1:01:51] it's not fair to the other people and I
[1:01:53] definitely ain't preaching both twice
[1:01:55] ain't fair for for the ones that have
[1:01:56] already heard
[1:01:58] it
[1:01:59] Holiness the look of Holiness I tell you
[1:02:03] what it I and you know they don't have
[1:02:05] the word so they maybe don't have the
[1:02:06] character but I would live in places
[1:02:09] where brother M and Abigail live or
[1:02:10] menites where menites are those young
[1:02:12] ladies and they can do all kinds of work
[1:02:14] and they're dressed in a small flower
[1:02:16] little cotton dress with small flowers
[1:02:18] I'll just tell you what if I wasn't
[1:02:20] married I'd be chasing one of
[1:02:23] them they're fly dope beautiful
[1:02:26] you some some prostitute walking
[1:02:28] down the street she's cheap
[1:02:31] leather she'd been laying in the sun too
[1:02:33] long blistered I wouldn't give you 5
[1:02:36] cents for
[1:02:42] it God help us if he don't come back in
[1:02:44] the Raptor he says if he didn't come if
[1:02:46] he didn't shorten the days there'll be
[1:02:48] none saved except for the leate watch
[1:02:50] this he he said watch how he says this
[1:02:53] he said except for the leate he would
[1:02:54] shorten the days amen the way he says it
[1:02:57] like if he didn't shorten the days would
[1:03:00] the elect even be
[1:03:02] safe but he promis he shorten the days
[1:03:04] because of the
[1:03:07] elect
[1:03:08] amen hey if you got something valuable
[1:03:11] you don't have to look for some kind of
[1:03:12] cheap
[1:03:14] imitation if God wanted the barn red he
[1:03:16] would have brought it red that's why I
[1:03:18] say and this is just a joke if God
[1:03:19] wanted me to live in this cool climate
[1:03:21] he would have given me fur that's why I
[1:03:23] love the hot
[1:03:24] climate I I have no problem living in
[1:03:26] the winter time January and February
[1:03:28] anywhere I'm not fussy where it is long
[1:03:31] as it ain't
[1:03:32] cold man God help us here the prophet
[1:03:38] says when you're singing hymns and what
[1:03:42] now now he's showing you how we're going
[1:03:44] to get these exceeding great and
[1:03:45] precious promises brother Dale never
[1:03:47] come up with this message by the way I'm
[1:03:49] far too for
[1:03:51] that you I hope you got a little bit of
[1:03:54] faith in God and a whole lot more and
[1:03:55] our prophet and our message here he says
[1:03:57] you know when you go around s singing
[1:03:59] hymns and you start reading your Bible
[1:04:02] the strangest thing happens The Stranger
[1:04:04] Jesus Christ shows up and he'll appear
[1:04:07] on the
[1:04:08] scene because you're thinking and
[1:04:11] meditating on him ain't that amazing
[1:04:15] like when the two disciples were walking
[1:04:16] on the road to emus and they were
[1:04:19] aack they were AQ and they didn't even
[1:04:21] see they didn't have the Revelation and
[1:04:23] they didn't understand the word of God
[1:04:25] but they were we're just thinking about
[1:04:26] them oh man I'm so I'm so disappointed
[1:04:29] in Jesus come on come on come on say it
[1:04:32] you can say it so I'm so disappointed
[1:04:35] Jesus he didn't build the kingdom here
[1:04:38] and I'm still a
[1:04:41] slave Jesus ain't even a respector
[1:04:43] person he don't even care how you talk
[1:04:44] about him he'll still show
[1:04:46] up hello hello is anybody
[1:04:51] there is that the
[1:04:53] truth they were they they were not going
[1:04:56] down the road to the m say oh praise God
[1:04:58] Jesus did everything I believed he would
[1:05:02] do they were saying oh Jesus you let us
[1:05:06] down you failed
[1:05:09] us and he still showed up and
[1:05:14] the he said the reason that we don't
[1:05:16] have the spiritual blessings and we have
[1:05:19] too much time to watch television too
[1:05:21] much time to read the newspaper to
[1:05:23] listen to something that we ought not to
[1:05:25] listen do we are not Redeeming the time
[1:05:28] but we're giving things to the world
[1:05:29] instead of to our lord
[1:05:33] Jesus maybe too much time to watch the
[1:05:36] news for those that knew the one God
[1:05:38] dwelt in the light he said and when he
[1:05:41] was on Earth He manifested In the Flesh
[1:05:43] he said I am the light of the world
[1:05:44] because God was manifested through him
[1:05:47] and he was the light the pillar of light
[1:05:48] that led the children of Israel and he's
[1:05:51] the light that struck down Paul on the
[1:05:53] road to Damascus and he's the light that
[1:05:55] came to the prison with Peter and he's
[1:05:56] the light that's on this picture and
[1:05:59] he's the light that's in my heart and
[1:06:01] he's the light that's in this church and
[1:06:03] he's the Everlasting Light and in him is
[1:06:05] no
[1:06:07] Darkness absolutely no darkness that
[1:06:10] means that we're living in Heavenly
[1:06:12] places because he is a light and we're
[1:06:14] following the light and we're living
[1:06:16] inside the light and he's living inside
[1:06:18] of us and so we're losing our mind cuz
[1:06:21] we're Stone
[1:06:23] drunk Hallelujah prise
[1:06:27] God the reason the people I'm just
[1:06:30] reading one line of these quotes here
[1:06:33] leading being led by the spirit of God
[1:06:36] he said the reason people can't see the
[1:06:37] Glorious things that God does today is
[1:06:39] they're looking they're looking they're
[1:06:41] not looking for them that's the reason
[1:06:43] it's only given to
[1:06:45] those that are looking for God to come
[1:06:50] back
[1:06:52] amen here and I I I we're doing well
[1:06:55] with their time unbelievable but here
[1:06:58] here I'm want to go into some things
[1:06:59] that that it that puts the onus back on
[1:07:02] each individual of us you get what you
[1:07:06] expect you get what you expect he said
[1:07:09] that's right he said you can never go
[1:07:11] above your never go above your
[1:07:15] expectations if you came to church this
[1:07:17] morning you say well I can't wait till
[1:07:18] we get home so I can watch my favorite
[1:07:20] Church where I'd rather live in ATT 10
[1:07:22] church because it's online and they have
[1:07:23] a really good video camera
[1:07:26] you're getting what you expect it'll
[1:07:28] never
[1:07:29] change he says you'll always have to do
[1:07:32] it that way he said Simon was expecting
[1:07:36] Jesus he said when you're expecting
[1:07:38] something Simon was always expecting
[1:07:40] Jesus to come while he was alive this is
[1:07:42] the old timeon in the New Testament and
[1:07:44] he was expecting it and God rewarded him
[1:07:46] for his faith and he said you won't
[1:07:48] taste of death until Jesus you hold
[1:07:51] Jesus in your
[1:07:54] arms he said Daniel was expecting God to
[1:07:57] deliver him from the dying stand the
[1:07:58] Hebrew children was expecting God to
[1:08:00] deliver him from the fiery furnace but
[1:08:02] they didn't car either way the woman at
[1:08:05] the well that had the blood issue was
[1:08:06] expected to receive something when she
[1:08:08] reached out and touched Jesus and blind
[1:08:12] man barus was
[1:08:15] expecting that if he could get to
[1:08:17] Jesus he would be healed he said that's
[1:08:21] what he was expecting that Jesus would
[1:08:23] do he said you see you get exactly what
[1:08:26] you're
[1:08:28] expecting if you're disappointed in your
[1:08:31] friends or you're disappointed in your
[1:08:34] and you know we're the best pastor of
[1:08:36] the blame past the buck it was well I
[1:08:38] mean that came right from the beginning
[1:08:40] of Genesis it was the wife that gave
[1:08:42] them to me oh my goodness oh s's alive
[1:08:45] we still got that Spirit
[1:08:50] around help us Jesus we need to if
[1:08:54] you're not getting what you expect you
[1:08:56] need to say what's wrong with me God I
[1:08:59] need to die more brother Dale needs to
[1:09:01] get out of the way more brother Brown
[1:09:03] said his greatest gift was getting out
[1:09:04] of the way I don't plan sermons God give
[1:09:07] them to me if I don't God don't give
[1:09:08] them to me a church is closed next week
[1:09:11] CU I couldn't make something
[1:09:14] up
[1:09:16] amen God help
[1:09:20] us he said people get what they expect
[1:09:22] many times people come to a meeting they
[1:09:24] go to church and they say well I didn't
[1:09:26] see nothing happen I didn't expect to
[1:09:28] see anything happen in the first place
[1:09:30] that's the reason you didn't see nothing
[1:09:31] happen you didn't get help cuz you
[1:09:33] didn't expect to get help he said and if
[1:09:36] you come expecting to get help from God
[1:09:38] God will meet your expectation he always
[1:09:40] does that always always does that and
[1:09:43] whatever you go wherever you go whatever
[1:09:47] you do what you get is your expectation
[1:09:51] brings down not the pastor's face
[1:09:56] and not brother braham's Faith but your
[1:09:59] faith your expectation brings down your
[1:10:02] faith on the scene and God honors your
[1:10:04] faith but what brings it your
[1:10:06] expectation I can't wait to get to that
[1:10:12] meeting God help us give God help them
[1:10:16] their expectations if they're doing it
[1:10:18] reverently in the fear of
[1:10:22] God here James 4 2:4 and and 7 to8 he
[1:10:27] says excuse
[1:10:29] me you have not because you ask not and
[1:10:32] you ask and receive not because you ask
[1:10:36] a m many of us when we
[1:10:39] pray we say well we know we we're like
[1:10:42] the disciples you know when they prayed
[1:10:43] to get Peter out of jail and then Peter
[1:10:45] went and knocked on the door and they
[1:10:46] said well that's his ghost cuz we prayed
[1:10:48] but we know he ain't out of jail CU like
[1:10:50] we seen them in the socks yeah that
[1:10:53] spirit's still really healthy today well
[1:10:55] you know we prayed but we didn't expect
[1:10:57] it happen cuz we weren't at the big tent
[1:11:00] top or it was just a little brother that
[1:11:02] prayed for
[1:11:04] us huh I'd rather have a little I'd
[1:11:07] rather have one of the kids pray for me
[1:11:08] than any of you
[1:11:10] adults because they just blindly
[1:11:13] believe I don't care if it's a brother
[1:11:15] or a sister they just say oh God will
[1:11:17] touch you brother
[1:11:19] Dale we got all this fog in our head
[1:11:23] called age yeah God help us we have not
[1:11:27] because we ask not or we don't even
[1:11:29] believe if we did ask we'd receive it
[1:11:31] God's like well I'm not going to I'm not
[1:11:33] going to hurt your expectation I just
[1:11:34] won't bother giving it to
[1:11:41] you God help us verse 7 it says redist
[1:11:44] the devil and he will flee from you draw
[1:11:47] nigh unto God and He will draw nigh onto
[1:11:49] you so you see what's happening in the
[1:11:51] church the reason if if the church ain't
[1:11:53] living in Heavenly places now if it
[1:11:55] ain't if you're not living in Heavenly
[1:11:58] I'm not saying you aren't if you aren't
[1:12:00] living in Heavenly places if you become
[1:12:02] cold stale and you've lost your
[1:12:03] commitment and desire and thrill You've
[1:12:06] Lost Your thrill You've Lost Your
[1:12:11] Enthusiasm maybe it's because you ain't
[1:12:13] drawn near to God maybe you need to go
[1:12:15] see a marriage counselor you know
[1:12:17] there's marriage counselors that
[1:12:18] actually tell you that you can keep the
[1:12:20] r romance going in your life married
[1:12:22] life it makes no difference how white
[1:12:24] you are
[1:12:25] are I tell my wife on a regular basis I
[1:12:28] love you and you're like knock my socks
[1:12:33] off but we come to church we don't tell
[1:12:35] God that
[1:12:40] we're we don't come to church and say
[1:12:42] God we love you you knock my socks
[1:12:49] off draw near to God and He will draw
[1:12:51] near to you
[1:12:55] watch how that scripture ends says
[1:12:58] cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify
[1:13:01] your hearts ye double-minded you know
[1:13:03] what that double-minded means it's you
[1:13:05] got so much so many other thoughts on
[1:13:07] your mind you can't even think clearly
[1:13:10] about God and the Rapture and church and
[1:13:13] preaching to the world and and prayer
[1:13:16] and fasting
[1:13:19] and you know prayer and fasting is like
[1:13:21] going on a diet you don't see it like
[1:13:25] it I mean it might that'd be a
[1:13:29] miracle but what you do secretly God
[1:13:32] will reward you openly if you just quit
[1:13:34] eating eventually people will see that
[1:13:37] you've quit eating and you'll start
[1:13:39] getting skinny amen God bless you
[1:13:41] brother Noah amen
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:59] this world that we're living
[1:14:01] in is a attacking us and it's a listen
[1:14:06] listen I've talked to some of you
[1:14:08] brothers and and I'm open for advice
[1:14:12] this world we're living in is a an evil
[1:14:15] age it's attacking the home on every
[1:14:18] side what what God can use for good in
[1:14:21] the internet the Satan is just
[1:14:27] terrible evils the evils that are
[1:14:31] Beyond I'm way too young to
[1:14:34] see and how in the world were our kids
[1:14:38] there's nothing you can give the kids un
[1:14:40] including not nothing that you can give
[1:14:43] your kid if it's got an internet hooked
[1:14:45] up to it Satan's
[1:14:47] connected and I don't care if you're
[1:14:49] watching a holy ghost filled messages
[1:14:51] I've seen I've been watching messages or
[1:14:54] hymns from churches and when the video
[1:14:56] stopped the next thing that come up was
[1:15:00] like oh
[1:15:04] boys brother Dale don't have all the
[1:15:07] answers but God does it's what you eat
[1:15:11] is what you'll become and if you feed on
[1:15:14] what I'm not I'm not speaking against
[1:15:17] progress in Internet I I search the
[1:15:19] scripture I'd use the message Hub I live
[1:15:21] by the message Hub and and and stuff
[1:15:24] like this but I'm just saying be very
[1:15:27] careful like when you're playing with a
[1:15:29] tool of Satan get on it use it for your
[1:15:32] and get off of it I mean I'm not saying
[1:15:35] you
[1:15:36] can't whatever
[1:15:38] but Satan is Alive and he's real and
[1:15:41] it's affecting our
[1:15:44] world let me rephrase that it's
[1:15:46] affecting the message
[1:15:48] Believers and the
[1:15:52] churches yeah it is
[1:15:57] and if you don't think it's affecting
[1:15:58] you well you're just living in a bubble
[1:16:01] of
[1:16:03] unbelief because Satan knows his time is
[1:16:05] short he he can Satan can see better
[1:16:09] than any one of you that the door is
[1:16:11] closing and time is running out and he
[1:16:14] is going like a
[1:16:17] maniac like a stone maniac to get all
[1:16:21] that he can devour before the end time
[1:16:24] and he ain't going to the ones that he's
[1:16:27] already
[1:16:28] devouring uh-huh he's going to the ones
[1:16:31] God's priz possession the ones that are
[1:16:34] wearing a
[1:16:38] diamond on their
[1:16:40] finger you don't think he wants that
[1:16:42] diamond that
[1:16:45] precious
[1:16:47] uh-huh God help
[1:16:49] us God help
[1:16:52] us remember how
[1:16:55] I mentioned that
[1:16:58] already when we talked about that and I
[1:17:01] told you those two quotes about how God
[1:17:03] will use the five-fold ministry to
[1:17:06] minister his word and I'm going to I'm
[1:17:08] going to just read exactly what brother
[1:17:09] Brown says he says this is on uh Israel
[1:17:14] and the church paragraph 105 he said
[1:17:17] what people needs is their brains
[1:17:18] baptized besides their water he said
[1:17:20] that's right he said he said excuse me
[1:17:22] for there being such a sharp expression
[1:17:25] but he said I sure wish that would soak
[1:17:27] in sometimes people get so stuck in
[1:17:30] their thing you know I was watching you
[1:17:33] know and studying and I do a lot of
[1:17:35] different things and and somebody was
[1:17:37] showing a video and they were showing
[1:17:39] the word of God and it was a beautiful
[1:17:41] video and I respect the brother and he
[1:17:43] was showing it word based and message
[1:17:45] based and he was he was physically
[1:17:47] putting it up and letting brother
[1:17:48] brandom read it and showing you the
[1:17:50] quote showing you the Bible verse I mean
[1:17:52] there was just no doubt it was black and
[1:17:54] white was talking about how ministers
[1:17:56] had ridiculed him and called them names
[1:17:58] and and it's a long ways from here so
[1:18:00] don't even try to guess and he of course
[1:18:02] he never said that should never happen
[1:18:04] that that's of the devil that's that's
[1:18:07] of the devil we're not I brother Dale
[1:18:09] ain't I'm I'm not even in charge of
[1:18:12] anybody's
[1:18:15] salvation nobody's I just throw the net
[1:18:19] you work out your own salvation with
[1:18:20] fear and trembling I'm I'm throwing out
[1:18:23] the net how God deals with you and your
[1:18:25] conscience that's entirely up to you why
[1:18:26] do people we why
[1:18:32] do this age a great one of the greatest
[1:18:35] things I'm I'm I I'm going to shut up
[1:18:37] and close but one of the greatest things
[1:18:39] that will come against the church
[1:18:40] besides
[1:18:42] pornography and and all these things
[1:18:44] will be
[1:18:46] popularity
[1:18:48] popularity and everything that God chose
[1:18:51] us to do in the Bible none of it nobody
[1:18:55] knows you're doing
[1:18:58] it most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
[1:19:00] and and I'm not I mean if people do it
[1:19:03] it's fine but you know these some people
[1:19:05] will have prayer conventions
[1:19:08] online and I I just I'm just telling you
[1:19:11] what the Bible says the Bible says when
[1:19:13] you pray enter your closet be not like
[1:19:14] the Hypocrites Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:19:17] for they think because they got great
[1:19:18] message dialogue that God will hear
[1:19:20] their mouth oh Lord God of the Prophet
[1:19:23] please heal me me because of the opening
[1:19:26] of The Seven Seals and all the I believe
[1:19:30] all of that but you don't do that on the
[1:19:34] internet you flat out don't do that on
[1:19:36] the Internet it's flat out on
[1:19:40] scripture you can't find one scripture
[1:19:42] for it pray on the internet so everybody
[1:19:46] can hear me oh dear
[1:19:52] Jesus how far have we come
[1:19:57] how far have we come you seen what the
[1:19:58] prophet said about Jesus would he wear a
[1:20:00] suit and a tie these are just Traditions
[1:20:03] he said Jesus would not he was a common
[1:20:05] person he wore the the the the the
[1:20:07] clothing wear of the day right he wasn't
[1:20:18] a God help
[1:20:22] us God help us if you're looking for
[1:20:25] something great the great and and I
[1:20:28] listen we it's scriptural that you'll
[1:20:32] have all the spiritual gifts in the
[1:20:34] church and in our lives you got to have
[1:20:36] them in your lives before you going to
[1:20:37] have them in the church don't expect
[1:20:39] them in the church if none of them are
[1:20:40] in your
[1:20:42] life you don't expect me to speak in
[1:20:44] tongues if you don't speak in tongues
[1:20:46] don't expect to gift of healing on me if
[1:20:48] you don't have gift of healing don't
[1:20:50] expect uh you know Gifts of Prophecy
[1:20:52] from me if you don't have gifts of
[1:20:53] Prophecy
[1:20:55] yeah it's an individual Walk we're not
[1:20:58] Jews we're
[1:21:00] individuals but all those things are in
[1:21:02] the B and we like
[1:21:04] not man alive we've had tongues in our
[1:21:08] church here was the weekend that the
[1:21:11] sister brought the picture of the the
[1:21:13] Jesus over the thing from Toronto from D
[1:21:16] Samuels
[1:21:17] church when the power of God comes down
[1:21:20] there's nobody in this church would love
[1:21:21] it anymore if you all got blessed and
[1:21:23] we're losing your mind drunk in the
[1:21:25] spirit legitimately and God bless I I'll
[1:21:28] gladly shut up and just sit under the
[1:21:29] anointing of the power of
[1:21:37] God but we're looking for it the wrong
[1:21:39] way we're looking for it like we think
[1:21:42] we can buy it like the brother that went
[1:21:44] to the disciples in the Bible and says I
[1:21:46] see that gift in you I I'll pay you
[1:21:48] money for
[1:21:50] it no you can't buy
[1:21:53] it it's by a
[1:21:56] sacrificial slain lamb Jesus was a slain
[1:22:00] lamb
[1:22:01] butchered Jesus was butchered for
[1:22:05] brother
[1:22:06] Dale
[1:22:13] butchered
[1:22:16] Butcher and if you're
[1:22:18] him then you'll be
[1:22:21] butchered for the world
[1:22:25] because the Bible says that if you're
[1:22:27] going to have fruit he's going to cut
[1:22:31] you and when Jesus was butchered they
[1:22:33] said when they came to Jesus said I
[1:22:35] would see the father he said I've been
[1:22:37] with you all this time but he said
[1:22:40] unless I'm butchered watch how I'm
[1:22:42] putting this my unless I die I will
[1:22:45] dwell alone and so the reason that if if
[1:22:48] if we're not in if you're not in
[1:22:50] Heavenly places or if the churches isn't
[1:22:53] in Heavenly places if it isn't if you
[1:22:55] don't think we're in Heavenly places
[1:22:58] have you been
[1:22:59] butchered
[1:23:02] yet have you become a sacrifice where
[1:23:04] God gets a snippers out and he just
[1:23:07] starts cutting off all this
[1:23:09] Jazz you know brother Bram said and let
[1:23:11] your light so shine he said you got too
[1:23:13] much smut in your life and I can't even
[1:23:16] see Jesus in your life because you're
[1:23:18] all cluttered
[1:23:20] up and the basic exceeding great and
[1:23:23] precious promise promises are received
[1:23:26] by prayer Clause of
[1:23:29] Life pushing the plate
[1:23:32] away or telling your wife she don't need
[1:23:35] to cook
[1:23:37] tonight and going where it's really
[1:23:39] quiet and there's no
[1:23:42] noise no
[1:23:45] noise no noise at
[1:23:49] all and just letting God talk to you
[1:23:53] saying God
[1:23:55] I can I'm I'm done I'm really
[1:23:58] done I'm really done
[1:24:01] God I can't go one more
[1:24:04] step till you bring some light on to
[1:24:09] seat and help save
[1:24:14] me God help us there's a way we can get
[1:24:18] those
[1:24:19] promises but it's not on the
[1:24:22] internet uh this tell you what you're
[1:24:25] not going to you can watch the you could
[1:24:27] watch God preach on the internet and you
[1:24:30] won't get those promises in your church
[1:24:32] or in your life unless you have a secret
[1:24:36] closet unless you have a private life
[1:24:39] it's good high time that we bring back
[1:24:41] devotions in the home and it's good time
[1:24:44] I try I try to almost always but I try
[1:24:47] the first thing I do when I turn on my
[1:24:49] phone is listen to my Bible I'm a poor
[1:24:53] reader so I listen to chapters I listen
[1:24:55] to books I sleep with the New Testament
[1:24:59] on I've listened to the New Testament
[1:25:01] since we come back to a Salvador three
[1:25:03] or four
[1:25:04] times I'll go to upstairs 6:30 put the
[1:25:07] New Testament on listen to it I fall
[1:25:10] awake I wake up I'll shut it off in the
[1:25:12] morning just playing the word of
[1:25:15] God or the
[1:25:18] prophet now I I I don't need to tell you
[1:25:20] that I'm not looking for like a bozel
[1:25:22] button but I'm saying it's it's high
[1:25:24] time we all did something like
[1:25:26] that what we do in
[1:25:29] secret don't we need to shut off the
[1:25:32] complainers and turn on the doers and
[1:25:35] say you know I've been in my closet you
[1:25:38] don't tell me you've been in your closet
[1:25:39] I I told you I was but you see what I
[1:25:41] mean your CL it can be anywhere it can
[1:25:44] be just when you wake
[1:25:48] up and then we have to understand that
[1:25:50] God's
[1:25:51] Sovereign and we can't boss him around
[1:25:55] you know when the disciples said I'm I'm
[1:25:57] closing with this I'm sorry but he said
[1:25:59] when the Lord teach us to pray look at
[1:26:01] the Lord's Prayer you know many many
[1:26:03] times not always but many times we say
[1:26:04] the Lord's Prayer at the end of
[1:26:06] Wednesday prayer service but it's not
[1:26:09] like Lord pay my bills Lord kill my
[1:26:13] pastor move me to the Big Church Lord
[1:26:17] give me the seven spiritual gifts in my
[1:26:19] life I want to prophesy and speaking no

[1:26:26] Father which art in Heaven hallow it oh
[1:26:30] we get into worship be thy name th it's
[1:26:34] all about thy kingdom and thy power it's
[1:26:38] him it's God God God God God it's not me

[1:26:45] brothers that could Minister handle the
[1:26:47] word are welcome to brother Carson
[1:26:50] brother
[1:26:51] Matt amen don't don't forget that God
[1:26:55] will take me on a trip
[1:26:56] someday this church ain't about I I have
[1:26:59] these conversations with my wife I say
[1:27:01] honey if I die who will keep the church
[1:27:03] going who will shovel the sidewalks who
[1:27:06] will vacuum the rug who will pay the
[1:27:08] bills when there ain't no enough money
[1:27:10] in the church count to pay the bills who
[1:27:12] will do
[1:27:14] it who will
[1:27:17] preach who'll pay the heat bill
[1:27:26] God will if we die if we have a fresh
[1:27:29] sacrifice I'm just
[1:27:31] saying it's your responsibility it's
[1:27:34] your responsibility to add virtue to
[1:27:36] your faith and it's your responsibility
[1:27:39] the Bible says you go back in second
[1:27:40] Peter it's it's really good when you had
[1:27:42] those great and exceeding precious
[1:27:43] promises it's what you must do to have
[1:27:46] the nature of Christ that's right in the
[1:27:49] Bible to get his nature that's what you
[1:27:52] must do
[1:27:54] and to get them come by a secret
[1:27:57] relationship you
[1:27:59] know oh this is
[1:28:01] unbelievable I'm going to shut up but
[1:28:03] the seventh seal is that secret
[1:28:06] relationship am it's not a public show
[1:28:10] and it's when you go into the when Isaac
[1:28:12] took Rebecca in the tent that's the
[1:28:15] seventh seal right
[1:28:18] there so when you send all your friends
[1:28:20] home and say it's time for me to have
[1:28:22] some alone time with God
[1:28:25] that's the seventh seal brother Brown
[1:28:27] you watch him come right up to and he
[1:28:28] said oh oh oh I've said too much so I
[1:28:32] feel
[1:28:33] checked that seventh seal is intimacy
[1:28:38] it's you and
[1:28:39] God in in your mother's
[1:28:46] tent let's see
[1:29:03] God help
[1:29:04] me God help me in this stage we're

[1:29:28] and
[1:29:29] it's it's very alive and
[1:29:34] attractive it's because people are
[1:29:36] spending so much
