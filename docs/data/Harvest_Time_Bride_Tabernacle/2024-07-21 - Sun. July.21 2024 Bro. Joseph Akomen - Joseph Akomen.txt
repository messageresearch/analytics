we thank you for your Amazing Grace Blessed Be Your Name Lord God we pray that we would never step or over top of what you've done for us take it for granted say we have no need of you God have mercy I help us Jesus to recognize the Plan of Salvation and the great plan of election blessed be your name before the foundation of the world before there was even a monu you saw us Lord perfectly in your mind spoke us through that amazing word oh Blessed Be Your Name Lord God we pray you bless Every Soul represented here this morning especially Lord God we pray you'll bless your minister this morning your servant Brother Joseph coming and traveling far and just different surroundings and different rooms and Lord we pray you'll bless him and his family supernaturally Lord God and for those that have drove far to come and hear your word and hear from your throne Lord God bless each individual and our visitors Lord God and the ones that are online that couldn't make it today or are homesick some had to work and some are home sick Lord God and we pray that your sweet H holy spirit will go through to those predestinated souls and touch them Lord Jesus we pray your beautiful name we pray amen thank you Lord God bless you welcome you we welcome our visitors and just very welcome and we're just blessed to have Brother Joseph from Gerard Samuel's church and Toronto with us and we had an amazing time last night with the family and just uh we we were telling them last night when we were together said now next you got to come a lot earlier this coming in the evening that that just we got more stuff to talk and and seething just as short trips and and uh I believe their service in Toronto starts a lot later than 10:00 so it probably was a change for them to to be ready for 10 but God's good amen and we're just we just greet you and pray for his presence let's just sing one song as our brother Joseph comes all is well amen you know Jared was talking about his hiring man you know it's all well with our soul as long it's well with us and him man you know Jared had a guy if you've seen him in the grocery store looks just like you and me and he was home for over a week out of just sheer depression and his wife called Jared he said he was so bad said I took his food to him in his bedroom but you could walk by him in the grocery store and you could think it was one of you cuz he has no Eternal hope he has no founder he has no Rock he has no he has no Heavenly Father man Satan's lied to him and tricked them and got him convinced that amen God help us to not take what God's given us for granted amen amen God bless you this morning as he comes and ministers the word there's a story in the Bible of Elisha the sh my woman and who son the woman found favor with God and he gave her a son while working in the field the little boy died but the woman's Faith did never fail and even in death she testified let it's all away [Music] all is well thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus oh we have heard the message love and it's all way there is a place a perfect [Applause] behind so a bride rest for all his [Laughter] way now things have not worked out like God's people for we see fighting the greatest battle ever fought we must have the fath of Abraham knowing God's word never face and if we just trust in him you find it all is well oh is well thank you Lord all is well thank you Jesus we have heard the message alone and it's all way there is a place a perfect rest behind the so rest little bride rest for all is [Music] well all is well you can come brother [Music] rest for is World Hallelujah I would like us to sing that song again because it's well with our soul the reason why we have to sing that song again is this there are people that are living just the way you living they go to the same work that you go to they drive the same car you drive probably they have more money than you do but they can't testify of that song that is well with their soul therefore for for me and you to make that testimony is the grace of God therefore let's sing that song with meaning and understanding because when you understand what God did for you you are super super super special in the hand of God all this oh all this world we have say shal and all is [Music] behind in rest all let let us just have a word of prayer our heavenly father we come in your August presence Lord to give you thanks and to give you praise father we come with humility Lord knowing that without you we are nothing father we thank you because of what you've done for us at Calvary Lord what you did for us Lord way back lord when we just thought you thought of us Lord that will be here today Lord send ourself oh God together today Lord this is the unfolding plan Lord this is oh God the movie that started long time is being unfolded Lord we seen it playing out and we are a part of that movie Lord we're thankful because you choose us in Christ before the foundation of the world Lord it is not what we've done Lord it is because of your great internal thought amen what you want want to unfold you wanted to have a family you choose us in you Lord father we are thankful this this morning Father Lord that we are counted among those who have life Lord you are the one that can give life and Lord we thank you for our brother who are invited us here his family Lord the whole congregation Lord Jesus father Lord you knows the need of everyone yes Lord Lord I have no way of KN even if I have a way of knowing their needs lord I can't help nobody Lord Jesus but you oh God your word oh God is what delivers your word is what set people free your word is what meet the need of people therefore Lord today as we speak your word Lord take your servant I humble myself before you Lord Lord you know I'm completely nothing I'm depending on your grace Lord you have a reason of bringing me from the way from Toronto to be here Lord I pray oh God let your word oh God come with power we let your word come with Deliverance father let your word oh God meet the need oh god of every brother and every sister we thank thank you in Jesus precious name amen you may have your seat uh I just want to bless the Lord for the opportunity God has given for me and my family to be here oh last time I we we were here and we enjoy ourself and uh your pastor is we're becoming a good friend and yesterday we were amen we were here we were fellowshipping and you know the Bible said Iron sharpet Iron and uh uh to me anywhere you go in the world when the Bride come across the bride the fit like this and that is what God has been doing all over as I travel around the world to ministers whether you are in China whether you are in Japan whether you are in the jungle of Africa when the bride meet the bride because we came from One Source it doesn't matter whether you are black or white or green no no no no we came from God and we are ready to go back to God right uh this morning I have my family here a few months ago my my first daughter get married and she's not yet today and uh my wife and other uh of my family are here my wife is there and my son and uh we we thank God for giving us opportunity to be here again uh without wasting time uh let's stand and read the word of God what I want to talk about this this morning is life only come by the spoken word hallelujah life comes by the spoken word without the spoken word there's no life therefore me as a person can speak but if I don't have internal life in me what I speak is just a m word but have internal life in you and you speak it is no longer you that is speaking it is dity that is speaking through you therefore given us as the children of God that when we receive life we have power to give another person life not because of your your status no because you now become the hand and the leg and the mouth of God because God is a spirit God need a vessel that he could use therefore when your pastor come here behind the pulpit and he take the word of God and place it in his mouth and I begin to speak it is the day it is speaking therefore when deity begin to Speak Life begin to come upon the life let's take uh let's The Book of John chapter 1 one 1 to5 hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same in the beginning was God all things were made by him and without him was anything made that was made in him in him was life and the life was the light of men and the life shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not let's go let's go to the Book of Genesis chapter 1 1 to4 in the beginning God create Heaven and Earth period and the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from Darkness Heavenly Father we thank you we give you praise Lord come to us this morning use my lips I hide behind the reviewer in Jesus precious name amen you may have your seat like I would saying life only come by the spoken word this morning I like to read quote the reason why I like to do that as I travel around the world because the the quote we read is not just my word it's not your pastor's word it is the thought of God that was given to a prophet and the prophet spoke it and put on books and tapes therefore that thought of God has been expressed is looking for a woman a man to take over just like Jesus God when Adam and Eve see in the Garden of Eden as they were going out of Eden God told them I'm going to give you a seed andto that before that God told them go and multiply and before they start the the spiritual multiplication the enemy came in and pervert the journey therefore the word of God has already been spoken there that word of God was hovering looking for a lady for almost 4,000 years therefore one day that t that was spoken that was going around and found and a virgin and that thought was no longer just a spoken word but it was a manifested word yes sir that is what the message of the hour is God came down in this end time and gave his thought to a prophet and The Prophet by inspiration cut the thought of God sir and put it on books and tape therefore we the fivefold we have no message of our own the five phone is just like a unic we take what the prophet has spoken we just speak it back to the congregation and today I don't know what needs you have the word of God is able to change your situation the word of God is able to mold you to what God what God intended therefore before the foundation of the world God wanted to have a family therefore by the grace of God you are a part of that family not it's not of your chosing that is why every day even if you don't have money even if you don't have food to eat you should be the most happiest human being that live on the face of the Earth why because God before the foundation of the world he choose me he choose CH you he choose your pastor in this town why is it that out of the whole people I don't know how many people are in this town but only you God call you not only God call you when God call you have ability to hear from God not because of not because you are you are maybe not because you are better than your neighbor but when God begin to speak you something inside of you resonated something inside of you AG the word of God something inside of you say yes that is it that's what I'll be looking for I only use myself and as example when I was in the denomination I was looking for everywhere I go I know something was not right but when I come in contact with the message of the hour my good night said that's is it that is what I've been looking for it it do bypass my mind but it struck my soul and when it struck my soul I said amen and since then over 20 years I have been on Revival you said brother what is Revival Revival is when God begin to open the world and you begin to see the plan of God and God begin to show you that you are not only see Jesus you are a part of the program of God it's good to see babraham as a prophet but you have to see yourself in the same program in a message the spoken word is your reganes let's listen to what the prophet said the prophet said paragraph 307 now this word of God is eternal God being infinite cannot speak one thing and then later change to something else that is the confidence that we have in our God our God is not like a pop who change every second our God is not like politician they move by the wind no Our God when the God speaks and that's when he spoke God know that what he spoke is coming to pass he said because every decision of god is perfect he cannot he cannot once his word is spoken he cannot die it live on and on he cannot die because it is God his word cannot more die than he can die that is the reason we read s John the first chapter that in the beginning was the one and the Word was with God and the Word was God and God made was made flesh the same word that was spoken in the beginning with his internal purpose came un over and was made flesh and dwell Among Us God is interal this God that is interal that was the time that God was unal being was a dwell in the spirit was a spirit and it does God has thoughts and who was that who was that thought it was me and you therefore I am a part of God you are a part of God and as we move prepared to go to the Rapture let me categorically say this that without the Without You The Rapture will not be complete amen without me this program will not be complete therefore if you are a child of God it doesn't matter how deep you have gone in sin it doesn't matter how how the enemy has chained you down because this is the age of the Redemption claim Christ is on the earth claiming his attribute Christ is on the earth crazy claiming his children therefore if you were whether you are a drunker whether you are fornicator whatever you have been that the devil has enslaved you you have been in the Captivity of the devil but I'm here to tell you that in the time of redemption clay God will find you wherever you are God will get you it doesn't matter if you are a seed of God God will reach out to you if you are in drug if the demon of nicotine hold you bound don't worry if you are a seed of God let me tell you Hallelujah there is power in the word of God because the word of God is eternal that power is able to break down chain and set you free in the book of Psalm Psalm 63 1-3 say said oh God Thou Art my God early I will seek thee my soul tested for thee my flesh longer for thee in the dry and testy land where there's where no what is to see thy power and the glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lives shall praise thee now the prophet said in the message test testing for life he said now so after studying a little while I begin to remember that life has many different meanings therefore if life have different meanings listen to what the pr says sometime that life what people we call life life is no real life it is a perverted life therefore when all of us were born when I was born in this world that one life that I received was a perverted life the life you receive on the on your on your birthday when you were born that life was perverted because that was not the original God wanted me and you to live live internally but before his program could unfold the enemy came in but whether the enemy came or not the purpose of God can never be defeated he said it is a perverted life because that is that is not only real life that is he said is a perverted life because there's really only one life that is eternal life the reason why we are dying the reason why we are sick the the reason why you see hospitals built everywhere the reason why you see ambulance in different you hear the sing of the ambulance why is because this life that we have here is not an eternal life it's a perverted life it's a life that have de it's a life that have sickness it's a life that have all kind of trouble that is why the Bible said job said a man or woman that is born of a woman is a few days why because that was not the original plan of God but despite the fact it wasn't original plan of God God knows that Eve Adam and Eve was going to do what he did it was not a surprise to God no way God knew God allow it why did God allow it why why did God allow it God allow because in the B part of God's mind there were other attribute God want to manifest but he couldn't do that if he allowed Adam and Eve to live in the state of perfection and God have there are things God want to express that is why most of us as a Christian when you go through trial and persecution you go through difficult time in life just put a break hold on just ask yourselfself a question why am I going through what I'm going through sometime the devil will come and start interpreting something to us and if we are not careful we take what the devil said than what the word of God said there are things God plac in us that God want to express that we don't know therefore God allows situation to happen and some situation is unpleasant there are things in our life we ask question why why why and sometime we don't have an answer to it but God if you are a child of God you know you have come in contact with this Heaven the man who create Heaven and Earth and you know that this person who put everything here is your father let me tell you I have a son I have a daughter my plan and purpose for them is for them to be okay yeah I pray for them every day I pray that God should protect and guide them if me as a human being born evil can think of my family like that what about about God therefore whatever when you are sleeping God think about you when you are working whatever you are doing that is why the Bible said that the thought I have towards you is the thought of good not of evil therefore when you receive Christ and you know that inside of you you have made Christ I'm not talking of the imaginary God I'm talking of this God that is real that this God God I'm talking about is more real than this this God I'm talking about is not a a a president of the United States it's not the king of England no I'm talking of a that man that St that said let there be and he spoke that and he went back to rest and he know that what he spoke is going to come to pass therefore when God was creating a family God said I will have a bride it doesn't matter what the devil does it doesn't matter what happened I was telling the brother I said if God before the foundation of the world and when he choose you in Christ and he create a path for you yes and that path it's a land that you must travel on Earth and he said you are going to meet 1 2 3 4 5 six seven people on Earth and those people are going to come through you because you carry eternal life now you are tring you already you meant one two 3 person you still have four people to to meet and you are in the plane going to Japan and all of a son the the pilot said oh let's fix our B and they try and that that play Crash let me tell you God will make sure right yes God yes will make sure that if everybody die yes you will survive Hallelujah you know why because God H this spoke God already M out your life therefore rest assured that until God finish with you no no power no sickness no cancer no diabetes nothing can happen to you why because there's a program that you are involved in and that go that program cannot be complete without you yes therefore God Is Watching Over You day and night when you are sick God Is Watching Over You When you go to the hospital God is watching over you everything you are doing if you are driving you may not see it there are angels yes that are designated Hallelujah to watch over you why because you carry life you are life carrier you are not just like every other human being there were human being who came up in the Garden of Eden who were not in the mind of God who came and Bess but you are a super and God have confidence so much in you that you realize listen in a message the prophet said any Greek scholar know that the word internal comes from the word zo which mean God's own life that's right the only way that you ever have life there's only one form of life and that is God's own life in you then you have internal life because he is internal there is and we are attributes of thought before there was even a foundation of the world or anything all this is just his thinking and we are displaying of his thoughts of what he it was you see a lot of people are asking questions why God allow war in UK in Ukraine why God allow this and that you see chaos everywhere I tell listen everything that is happening bad and good is to display that unseen God that God exist therefore what God is doing God allow things to happen so that he can reveal himself whether there is war in Ukraine God is using that to reveal himself sickness in your life God is using that to reveal himself when you have disappointment God is using that to unveil himself but what we need is to refocus not allow the enemy to tell oh it's because you did this because you do that because you do that no no no no no God is revealing if you if you are sick why did God allow children of God to get sick why why did God allow the children of God you go to church you believe God you you you try to please God you are a righteous mind you try everything all of a sudden sickness hit you and you try you pray and pray and the more you pray the more the sickness gets worse why did God allow all the all of that let me tell you my brother God allowed that to because if God did not allow sickness to come to your home and that same God that allows sickness to come to your home and turn around and deliver you from that sickness and you can't look oh my I used to sick now I'm okay and somebody come to tell you God doesn't exist you will never believe because you have an experience you know that God Is A Healer nobody can tell you right now as you're sitting down that God does not save nobody can tell you that God is not a savior because you are evidence you are a typical evidence that God save let me tell you my brother for me it is too late for the devil to tell me God doesn't heal because God has healed me not once not twice I can count it therefore we are epam of what God can do we are testimony we are we are attribute yes beautiful Jesus we are attribute that Our God who create Heaven and Earth not only that he create Heaven and Earth is interested in our life Hall no before the foundation of the world God had a program that program was God to come and live on earth with his attribute with his children nothing evil everything well and good but there were attributes in God that was locked in God that if God just let everything fine and ding those thing will not be expressed there God bring Lucifer into the picture yes listen I always believe this you said when God came out from this internal spirit yeah I was there you were there okay God Carry Me and You Now moving us from the internal Spirit into the logos now you were there as an attribute and the plan of God God wanted Lucifer to be in the picture and the only way to do that is to say Let There Be Lucifer and when God made that declaration you were there right therefore when God was speaking you were the one Speaking also therefore you gave the Lucifer his existence wow now when you come here the enemy trying to tell you you are nothing because the enemy know who you are the enemy come and preach the gospel of life then when God bring you from eternal spirit death attri he carry you into the logos and what was God doing God was traveling down to the Earth because God wanted me and you to be here God want us to me to go and preach in Africa God wanted the brother to be here preaching because we are the one who carry lives where would the life come from there's no life in the Pentecostal Church there's no life in aox churches there is no life in seven days Adventist there there are few people on Earth who carry Al you might go to they would look at you say who are you but we are the one who carry life therefore because we carry life who are we looking for we are not looking for people masses no when life meet life they recognize it amen when you receive this message you did not go to your pastor and let the pastor something inside of you strike because there is there's life in you that were looking for life and when the life come in contact with life you can't deny it it is there because that is the way God arranged his program therefore we came here with different conditions listen to what the prophet said I will restore says the Lord the prophet said without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are only guessing at it you are saying what the word said you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the way that life come into you right therefore if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can read this message just like a literature book you can just say what the Bible said but that doesn't give you life but when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost life inside of you spring up that life in you is looking for another life internal that is why we preach the gospel that is why my brother I come here every Sunday and preach why because we don't know who has life therefore the life that we preach is able to identify every life that sitting down here therefore when you when you receive that life you become an amateur God when you receive that baptism of the Holy Ghost it is deity in human flesh when you receive that baptism of the Holy Ghost what happened it is no longer you something transpired amen listen the prophet said you are saying what the word said you are saying what the pastor say you are saying what your mother said but when you receive the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost come in yes and baptize you into the person of Jesus Christ then you know by personal experience that Jesus Christ is the Son of God you see until you have that you are just guessing you are coming to the church because somebody told you about William Brown yeah right therefore many people stuck with William Brown because they see what the prophet did through his ministry but that Prophet did not bring bring you to focus on him there was a life of God in that Prophet that was calling for other life and therefore when that life goes out if you have life in you that life will identify you as the life of God Amen you said brother you know before this the sea open a lot of people were having an argument oh do we do we come into this Earth with the seed yes the very day you were born something happen in the spiritual realm if you are a seed of God because this body that was created was created for the seed of God to dwell in therefore the day you were born there was something that was happening that you are not aware of God put something what I will call a chep inside of you and he sent you out you do all kind of things and God you see many people the the technology they few years now they have been discovering about GPS they are copycat because God was the origination of the the GPS when God put you there and put his chip and God go arrest every time God was guiding you God was watching you no matter what you do God is like okay I have it doesn't matter let it do whatever he want but when the time the time and season is right for God to trap you you can hide you can run you can hide when it is a time for God to say enough is enough God will send somebody that have life to you and when that life begin to speak he will begin to attract the life that is in you and what happen it's just like when you you people are fing here my brother can tell you more when you plant a seed and that seed have life just only thing you need to do is to water it and as you water it there's a law in that se that he will reproduce himself that that is what we are but if you don't have life in you the prophet can come here and speak Miracles he can do all kind of Miracles here but because you don't have life if you don't have life what can he do he can perform miracle he can open your head and put the Bible you will never believe it because there's no life but if you have life what you just need to hear is the word of God because you are a part of the word of God you are a part without the word of God without you the word of God is not complete wow sir you see a lot of people the Bible go to the church yes but there is a time when God spoke there a journey that the spoken word had to be a manifested word brother AB spoke almost 50 60 70 years some of us were not there but why did you believe the prophet when the was here traveling different countries seven times we were some of us were not born we were not in his campaign none of us were there I don't maybe some was there but for me I wasn't born there no but what makes me believe this man that I never saw I some a man that I never see face to Faith what made me believe his word why because that man he internalized the Holy Ghost right the prophet said I have carried this Christ all along when he was born at about at 5:00 in the morning the pillar of fire came through the window and hang on top of this man and when he hang on top of this man right from that time to the time that he died he was carrying the Holy Ghost therefore the Holy Ghost was eternal life and he was not just giving it to him alone he was son for a mission right because there are other people who has life that that life this life had to and therefore when he stand on the pit he preached there were a lot of people in his campaign thousands of people they perform Miracles he hid them all of them gone they die without that life in them was not activated but here we are today we listen to tape we read the book and something inside of you said nothing but the truth something inside of you come alive what happened is because you yourself when you were born God in a supernatural realm the doctor couldn't see that your mom didn't see that God dropped something in you that can can agree with the word of God you were a part of God no matter how you travel no matter where you were born no matter whether you were born out of wedlock Hallelujah when the time come that life that God put inside of you will be activated and that is our mission the bride mission is to go that is the commission said go into the word and preach the gospel and the prophet said you should not go into the mission or a pastor without the Holy Ghost should not come up here because if you don't have the Holy Ghost you come upon here you know what you'll be doing you'll be swing your own seed and if you s if the person s his own seed that seed will not dramatize now listen to the prophet in the message exposition of the seven Church ages the prophet said Abraham was tried after he receiv received the word The Word of Promise most people think as soon as we we pray in Jesus name over a good promises that there there could be no trial but here it say Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the times referring to Joseph until the the time that the word came the word of the Lord was try now a lot of people can claim that I'm a message believer a lot of people can say well yes I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and you cannot argue that with anybody because it has to be you and God Alone no person yeah amen no I don't care who that Pastor is have right to tell you that you are not a bride or to tell you that you are the serpent SE no no no no no no individual have anything to do with that we our responsibility is to is to throw the net is to preach the gospel and God is the one who knows where he seed is there are still seed of God in the Pentecostal we we don't bring we don't we don't talk down on them there are the seed of God who see in the Anglican Church there are seed of God who are see Jehovah Witnesses there are seed of God who are many organization but they are there waiting they are waiting said where are the sons of God this what I'm here is not it doesn't fit me what where is this God of the Bible that is what I was when I was in Europe I was in the Bible School yeah and all of a sudden there is something in the scripture that they are saying but it does not it does not fit I'll give you an example I was in the bible school they were talking about they will read Genesis 3:15 I've have been looking for somebody I said okay for me I saw the serp the the the Fulfillment of the seed of the woman where is the seed of the serpent I was asking questions upon question but what I will hear they said oh don't go that deep nobody nobody know that that is not a yet but inside of me anytime they get there they will try to explain in a way and but inside of me I said no the Bible has to be true God put this in here so that the anointed I can see it and I saw I've seen it there must be something that is not right here yeah one day I was preaching in the church I was in Europe I was preaching after I finished preaching I preached my hand out that's what I know that is what we taught in the bible school and after I finished there was a brother in the front R who was a message believer and after he said God bless you brother you preach a very nice message but there's something missing I said what something missing because for me I was following what that was taught in the bible school he said if you wouldn't mind will I follow you home I said sure I put him inside the car I drove him home and my wife entertained the brother and he took the Bible said brother I have question I like to ask you I said okay see the brother did not even show tell me about William BR no right he asked me the first thing he go was Jes 3:15 and he explained it as he was explaining it something struck me and at the time he end up in the Book of Revelation said please hold on where did you get this things what you are saying because what you are telling me look real my soul Amen on fire said where he said I ask which which Bible school because that is what I can relate to he said no no no there this is not about from Bible school all of a sudden the brother brought out the seven Church ages yes he said read this and if you have any question call me brother when I read that book when I open that book till I finish that book every night I will jump up on my bed I tell my wife this is something this is God my wife said take it easy take it easy because there are false I said no this is not a false prophet this this is the truth I've been looking for brother the church I was they disown me they sent me out and say yes I would better leave the church and gain eternal life than than stick with a church and I'm dead like a rock and I pack all the church things and I dump it and I went straight after seen something life attract life and when that life not book stand up and I saw that is life I'm looking for what happened all the books from the bible school I pack all of them went straight to the garbage I dump all of them why because life has just been spok and life was released and when life was released because there was life here there was a magnet therefore since then now there is nobody no demon can tell me that this message is not true because I have the experience it's not something that somebody hand to me no I had the experience I know what it is and that is what life does when life magnet life listen let me tell you just watch during spring you see a concrete on a dryway look at the edge of that concrete you see end flower bring out his head and when you when you lift up that that slab or the concrete you find out that that there was that was started in the middle of that what was it doing when the s o n was attracting that life that rock could not even stand it can't better because there's life in there therefore that life had to find a way to come out because there was another life attracting him that is what happened between me that is what is happening with us therefore when the life if you have life in you it doesn't matter whether you were prostitute it doesn't matter whe whether you are drug addict but let that light begin to shine when that Eternal Light begin to move brother I'm telling you what the enemy will do he has to give give you up because there is life that is calling for life and that is why we are here this morning the life of God call you wherever you were whatever you were doing the life you can't hide life how can you hide life no when you have the Holy Ghost in you brother you may not be able to explain the the Deep mystery of the message that is not what is needed no you don't even know how to you know a lot of people say Oh Brother Joseph oh how can how can I understand the seven Thunder the seven SE all this great mystery let me tell you the mystery of God is so simple the mystery of God is Jesus Christ coming to dwell in you therefore when Christ come and dwell in you all the mystery the seven seal the seven Thunder all everything you may not know how to explain it but that seven seal is living his life that seven seal Hallelujah is going to the kitchen to cook for your husband that seven seal it become a truck driver that seven seal is a wife that seven SE go to school that seven se you are the one manifesting that it's not that is what life is it's not you having the ability to explain it having the ability to explain it that is intellect there are people who have a photographic memory who can read one book that's it they can tell you what it is they can tell you the day brother BR spoke they can tell you everything but you know what God doesn't deal with our head the prophet tell us in the Garden of Eden the first showdown between God and Satan what did God do the devil take his head the man's head and God take his heart therefore when when the life of God come inside of you you may not be you may not be able to use good English to explain the seven seal but that is not what it needed the seven seal was supposed to make make flesh the seven seal supposed to come you see you know what time there was a woman in the Bible and this woman was a prostitute because of his maybe the city he was she was living everybody wrote this woman off nobody want to associate with her they put a tag on her but one day I could believe maybe this woman wake up in in the middle of the night he says what is wrong with me I marri the first husband second husband third husband what what is my problem oh I saw my friend just mared had children but all of a sudden the and Ching your husband maybe he wake up she wake up and starts having dep depression and not knowing she not knowing that the seven SE was on the earth and he went there she went there one day in miserable condition because every other people went to the war and she was the only one who go because who go by herself because she was tired and when he get there I could believe I could see her say every time I come here I by myself and they put me in a different corner and she looked at all of a sudden he heard a a voice he said woman give me a give me a drink and could you imagine after 1 2 3 4 five six husband the seventh one was not just coming to tell you oh I don't have anything to do with you the seventh one was the seventh seal coming to tell her all her previous life that is what me and you are experiencing today we we might have gone through different different condition of life but when you come across this message this message is a seven sin this m say come to tell you what where you came from what you are doing here and where you are going therefore this seven sin come to tell you give you your right identity sir when this seven when I have in contact with this seven SE I know that I'm not an African when this seven SE come to you you know oh I am not a Canadian no what happened you this seven SE come to tell you where you came from you know before the seven SE came to us hallelujah we were having the devil was our father this devil that get people confused was the one telling us do this do this do that this devil we didn't know because we thought that we are Baptist we thought that you were maybe you came from different churches and you you want to do the right thing you go to church every Sunday but one day the seven SE appear it tell you you are not a Baptist you are not a Pentecostal you are not a Jehovah weakness you doesn't even belong to Canada when God in the beginning what God was doing God wanted to S seed on the earth and while he was swing that seed he came he take a handful of seed and throw it to to Canada and that is why you are here and he throw he take some handful of seed he throw it in Africa I was born in Africa I can't help it I would love to I would have love for me to born in Canada but God before the foundation of the world he know that I will be born in Africa he put a seed there and that seed was waiting for light s o n you were born in Canada God put you here and all of a sudden there was something in you that was crazy craving for God there was something in you that tell you to do you want to do the right thing why because there was a life in you that was waiting for another life to strike and that is what God is doing for us the prophet said he said God give us exceedingly great precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time the answer we must learn to receive patience into our soul you see that is why all of us we go through trial that is why we have trials and and we pray for things we say God sometimes like God doesn't answer no what God the prophet is telling us the Reason God is teaching us patience to our soul listen let me read that he said God give us exceeding great precious promises and know God said okay by The Strife you are healed that's the promise of God but sometimes you pray you Seck the more you pray the more sickness get worse that's one quote the prophet said God someone have confidence in you that when you pray if you remember silent he know that you will never give up God has so much confidence that you will be able to take the word of God he said he has promised to fulfill then he will but from the time we pray from the time we pray until the time the answer came we come we must Lear patient to our soul not down why for only in patience that you can possess life it is only by patience you go through trials of Trials upon trials and God what is God is trying to do God is trying to transport life to your soul therefore from today when you are going through trial first of all the question you have to ask yourself is am I a child of God God if that settle every other that comes with it God is responsible if you are going through Tri and you're a child of God let me tell you there's something in stock for you that you are not aware of that God is doing that God is trying to give patience to your soul so that you might be able to possess life now in the book of Matthew 16 Jesus came down with his disciples and he start asking the disciples who the man think that I am everybody will say this that oh some said you are Jeremiah some said you are that and Jesus Christ said no I'm paraphrasing now he said no let bring it individual who do you think I am am now listen to the he said and the S answered and said thou Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon by by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee thou are Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gazes of H will not Prevail against it Hallelujah in the message Christ is the mystery of God reveal the prophet told what is the new birth yes everybody until I get into them message the the Baptist explain what the new birth is every denomination explaining even at the beginning of the the message of Willam Braham a lot of people were confused what the new bir is but after the opening of the seal the prophet bring his so so simple that anybody can get get it because that is what Peter did when Jesus CH asked Peter he said Peter you that have followed me because Christ know there were some who did not know who he he is some of them I see confused they were following something then was was moving them to follow Jesus but they could not they could not get the clear revelation of who Christ was but when Christ bring that question Peter I believe Peter was just like somebody else all of a sudden something roll down from the mystical Chanel he bypassed Peter's mind went straight to the soul of Peter Peter all of his son Peter come up come to himself he said thou Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus Christ said Peter the prophet put it in a very simple way he said said Peter did not learn that from the Bible School Peter did not get that explanation from anybody nobody thought Peter something from Heaven roll down from the mystical channel into the soul of Peter and Peter vocalize it out and I can tell you Peter would have stand there said I don't know what I said and Peter would said what what I what did I just said and Before Peter could begin to think of what he said Jesus Christ said Peter Flesh and Blood did not explain that to you my father which is in heaven is the one who transported mystery unveiling of that mystery to you something happened inside Peter listen to what the prophet said Christ is the mystery of God he said what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personal listen it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that is as simple as thatu a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally I believe that statement if you are a seed of God even if you are 7 years old you will understand that right like that he said what is the new bir is the revelation of Jesus Christ personal to you he said not joiny a church not shaking hands not doing something different outside a Creed or you promise to live by the code of conduct you know a lot of people think when when you come to the church you the prophet said we should dress nice women don't cut your head there are people who are who have been doing that they don't cut their hair right they don't they wear long skirt they don't expose themselves they are decent human being but they will never be the Bride of Jesus Christ that's true therefore living by code of conduct does not take you to anywhere that's right coming to be behave like Angel in the church cannot help you therefore the only thing that will help you is that revelation of who Christ is roll down from the mystical Channel straight to your soul and you vocalize it out wow and that is what give you eternal life not you dress nice or good no no no no check the Bible the people that God has used are the most wward human being in the Bible it's not because of the ability why did God all of sudden God take take uh David David who con and kill another man take another man's wife and kill and God turn around said David you are man after my own heart to me it doesn't add up so you it doesn't add up but why did God does that why God do things like that why did God this woman allowed this woman to go to 1 2 3 4 5 six husband and this woman live in a torment thinking something wrong is wrong with his lineage this woman cried day and night she probably she think that somebody put a cur on her not knowing that God was working things out God was working that condition to be able to meet the seven seal that is what God is doing in our life your life might be turned upside down you might go to bed in the night you can't figure out what what is wrong with you you might be you are maybe sit down one place and hm do they put a c on my lineage in my family what is wrong I go through that I go through that and all of a sudden you start comparing yourself with another family but let me tell you the good news is this there's something God is working out there's something God is trying to unveil through your life there is something God is doing therefore the only way for God to do is to bring trial and persecution he said listen he said let me just finish this quote he said you promise to live by code of conduct the prophet said but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody say oh take or what take place it is Christ not the pastor priest or whatever it may be it is Christ in you is is that Revelation that the church was bu upon my question to you today let it just bring it very simple the new birth is not how how many quote you can quote the new birth is not how many tith you pay in the church no it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you because that is what life is therefore when you even if you you don't know your ABC could you imagine that Peter according to the pro and the Bible said that Peter was ignorant and un and come and put another phrase he said even if you write Peter's name with a big letter Peter could not even able to read his name because excuse my expression he was a dummy but in that God choose right to give that man the key to the kingdom therefore the way we think is different from the way God thinks that is why the Bible said that God's thought is not our thought therefore when God is doing something this is God's business it's not my business by the grace of God me and you we find ourselves in the will of God therefore when God are doing something God can decide to choose anybody that is his prerogative can CH take prostitute do anything I believe that is the reason why God choose me and you because if we really look at the society we are not the best humanly speaking no when we look at Society we are not the people most richest people in the society no my brothers and sister if I tell you my story and tell you where I came from you you will see what is called Amazing Grace amen hallelujah because Amazing Grace is what God give you without you any anything God decided before the foundation of the world he looked down through the stream of time he said we will be here in the darkest of the darkest when everywhere there is no truth and God said I'm going to choose the best said Brother Joseph are you saying I'm the best yes God will have put you in the time of Noah God will put you in the time of David God would have chose you in the time of will Abraham but God Reser The Best For Last you are the best God is depending on you God know that you are the one to close up this this what this operation that started billions billion years ago now we are in the final stage it's just like when we play soccer I love soccer when you are playing League you don't just choose people who don't know how to play you look for the best Striker that is why Messi and other people who play in Europe they put them in the center forward you know why because those guys are good in what they do then when they take the ball they don't play with it their aim is to score that is why God choose me and you the brother the prophet said in the message God of this evil age why did God have to choose bride in the midst of this darkness in this evil age why did God choose me why did God choose you I have answer for you the reason is that God choose you because you are the best Martin Luther could not face what you are facing today John Wesley could not face what we are facing today therefore God selected the Bride of the end time and equip them it's not your let me tell you let me just blend this straightforward it is not you the flesh your flesh is not the Bride of Jesus Christ this flesh there you go God doesn't trust it even myself I don't trust myself therefore what God is talking about is talking of the the seed of God that what God put there that he will able to defeat the Devil in his own ground and that why you are the best and that is why I'm the best I only tell people I said our sister in the church they can't preach if they have allowed them to preach our sister can defeat the PHD that went to Bible school and studied for 10 years why because we are not feeding on just ordinary Bible we are feeding on the Mysteries the hidden Mystery that was reserved for the and time and the only people that can able to understand the mystery has to be people who are have Pro prophetic Insight those who have ability to hear from God do you know that everybody can hear from God right do you know there are people that are living like hum like today they are like human being but they when they die they die like dog when they die they die like animal but there are honor specific people on the Earth that when they die there is life in them on the resurrection money those people hallu will be restorated amen and that is a part of who we are we are the special one God by his grace that's why my brothers and sister when I look myself every day I may not have money to pay my mortgage sometimes but every time I look at myself said I am wonderful ful made amen yes sir I'm the most handsome human being on Earth go God ever created God take time I said I want to special make Brother Joseph because Brother Joseph have something to do at the end time God specially put interest in you that when you were being when God is forming you in your mother's womb he did not allow you to have maybe break hand or you have your eyes not completely God wonderfully made you knowing that you are a part of God's program my brother I'm always as I go into Mission feed every go I go to the Jungle of Africa I only tell people I said brother listen whenever you see me you see the ambassador of Christ amen anytime I go to Jungle of Africa my brother I went one time we were going to the remote place and we got there the whole village were waiting for us and car couldn't go there there was no car brother we walked after we finished there's no way to come back we were using our our phone flashlight to track where we are going and the guy carried me I fed down I have bleed on my on my leg and I when I sent it to the church everybody was there I said brother I that is what my calling is I'm happy because God sent yeah I'm happy to see that I am carrying life and when we preach brother it is not like people here when you go to places where they don't have money you see the power of the Gospel when you go there brother here I only tell people the reason why there's not so much Revival you know I went there I see the way people live I was moved I took my phone I called my my children I said listen I think we becoming too SPO in Canada how can some a woman go and do a hair of two $250 where somebody and that $250 maybe in 3 weeks go and change it again and where somebody cannot get one me to eat and I was my my daughter told me said dad let me tell you something God put them there and God put us here and when he said I said that's true God know why he put them there but but when you see people they are rejoicing when they receive message I went to a place and we finished preaching this lady was supposed to go 3 hours by leg and we finished at 9:00 and it was almost getting that 9:00 where there's no light is pretty dark and the brother the pastor from macius is my mission partner he told me Brother Joseph you see those two ladies they are going 3 hours from here when it got home they may not have something to eat and that day we were CRA craving for egg we went to buy Six CR six eggs just to eat then I hold him the brother told me said Brother Joseph let us give this this egg six egg they are traveling 3 hours with leg in the in darkness just a travel 3 hours to come and listen to the message and when I said that I said Lord I'm happy because I'm a part of it we travel from the city 9 hours into the jungle it's not with with a t Road no we were dancing like this every time for 9 hours until we get there and when we got there you see the Revival in the heart of people in the heart of Those Who Have Nothing is it the reason why we don't see the supernatural Among Us is this when we feel the first thing we think about is ohip and because of that the devil give us alterity but back there they don't have alternative therefore they have to pray and pray God's down and you see the supernatural I remember there's a brother I was preaching in in church in uh South Africa as he was preaching that was a sister by inspiration tell the sister go to the bank machine you don't have M go to the bank machine whatever you put there is going to happen the brother the wife get up to back his up said tell me wife to go with her go with her and that sister has no money in his account and when he got there by the inspiration what the brother spoke he got to the and press his pin brother the money was coming out that is the God we serve because we hear the devil give us alternative we we are so relaxed but God know how to pull us into a place because God has a part of himself in US therefore God sometime God Force the issues on your family father issu said since you are you are just sitting not doing nothing you know in the North America know we don't pray we don't pray because Prayer Changes Things somebody told me said brother why should I pray when I have money in the bank why should I pray when I'm okay and through when you are living fine Brother you don't think about God that is why we are living the the North America I'm sorry to say this I'm what I'm I'm not trying to I live here for almost going to 30 years and I thank God I will if you choose for me to live in Africa here I will choose Canada that's but what I'm am I driving to that when when you have a a situation God put something in you to be able to overcome that condition therefore when you have everything simple you you go to to hospital simple if you don't have a job you go to welfare everything the system here designed every everybody to live comfortably I like to live comfortably I thank God for Canada but when you go to other places where they don't have what we have you see the supernatural am in operation why because what is in you you might underestimate what God put in in you I remember when I was sick I think I give this testimony before here I was sick I went to work and all of a sudden I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't work for nine good weeks I was in my living room I can't move my wife have to I take my pee and all of that and that is the time I ever listen to tape over and over I was in pain and that pain there's no medication that can touch it that thing forced me I said devil since you want to torment me let's go on the ride you let the pay go on and I continue to listen to tape brother throughout the night I will listen to tape one after the other one after the other at about 5:30 in the morning while I was in the bed I can't move my leg all of a sudden I saw myself I was not I this is not I saw myself move from my living room all the way to the bedroom come down I I close my eyes I pinch my ey I see myself and all of a sudden the quote the prophet say see yourself you are healed and and jump into it amen all of a sudden immediately I saw that I said in Jesus name I move my leg I moov the second one brother before I know it I went straight to my thread me I was I was in pain I was I was going I was going I said Lord I am I'm Healed I am heal I am heal and all of a sudden at the time my physiotherapy was coming in he saw me a top ofro me and he she shouted said Joseph don't do that I said what I said no I said I'm Healed I said what you say I said I'm heal you see me and I putting the second one I was doing I was in pain but because I saw myself healed I walk into it and what happened the brother the sister asked me said Mr Joseph I want to ask you a question every time I come here when you say something when I say something to you you always use scriptures because these nurses when they come to your house they want to give false hope this woman was telling me Oh the way your leg is they going to amputate it I say sister no no no no you can't cut my leg any time he think say anything bad I will say anything good when he saw me they say are you a religious guy I said yes I said I said oh no wonder anytime say something you trying to use scripture I said yes because W has power evil spirit travel by ways if you tell me I'm going to amputate my leg and accept that you know what I just said my dead warrant I said no no no no I said that is why I was doing that brother after that treadmill I was walking brother I can play soccer now nothing happened why because our God is is still his our God is powerful God is depending on all of us brother when I go to the mission Fe I have testimony to give everywhere I give testimony brother you see people because people know God is still alive and you see people getting healed I was preaching in Venezuela there was a family behind it wasn't he just heard me on the last speaker and this woman was on stage four cancer immediately I start preaching and all of a sudden because I were preaching English were they were preaching Spanish and that woman because of the word I it's not me has nothing to do it's the power of the word of God and the word of God went straight to that woman not even in the crusade in the next house and that woman he went to the doctor and that woman was completely and totally healed with no cancer why because God is still in business of healing God Trust on the bride we are here that is why I will telling my wife uh by the grace of God next year I'm going to be on full time going to Jungle of Africa wherever God sent me why because there are people who want to hear the truth we have the truth the Bible said the L the the harvest is plenty and the labor few God is is depending on me and you to go out there and tell them how powerful this message is that is the experience what devil can tell me now that God doesn't heal not once not twice not three times brother God healed God delivered God provide amen you know God want us to have an experience because when you have experience you can defy the devil when you have experience you can tell the devil listen to me when you were being created I was the one who gave you an existence and the devil knows that but the devil trying to say oh you do this you do that you do that no the prophet said when the sister came to brother BR he said he was complaining if I if I have the Holy Ghost or not you said that is what the devil the devil will come to you and bring all kind of things to you you see the Holy Ghost is not just jumping up and down the Holy Ghost is the life of Christ in you brother ask the sister what is your desire said my desire is to serve God is to do good you think the devil will give you a desire to do good no the devil will not do that therefore when you you have the desire to serve God but you are still struggling with in with your with your flesh you still struggling with the the nature that was given to you by your parents brother the prophet said that is what the blood of Jesus Christ was sh there for yeah but inside of you you want to do good that is the Holy Ghost it's God who put that desire inside of you but don't worry about what you are struggling with because this flesh will never be redeemed this you will struggle with it until you die therefore if you have something inside of you yes who always tell you this message is true yes who never have a conflict with the message that you believe that is God no matter what your struggle is listen in the message question and answer now the prophet said the body is what we look at this one we look at this body every body have different nature you come from a different background and the background that you come from form your body form the way you live therefore you grow up like that and you struggle you strugg but in the midst of that temperament that you have God put his own seed in there because this is not everybody that you see on the street that the seed of God there are two seed lying here on Earth listen the and the he said the body is what we look at the spirit is what controls you your soul is the nature of the spirit the soul that sinth shall die in other words the soul that disbel the word of God will be separated amen when this message of the hour in every age God allocated a certain amount word the word of God is God himself and he bring in this our age there's the word of God that was allocated and you having the ability to receive that you it means that you are a part of God there are some who don't have the ability it's not in them no matter how how what you preach no matter the mirac they see Miracle signs and wonder they can't believe why the prophet said they don't have anything in them to believe with right therefore when you put this two category side by side and you know where you fall into my brother that should give us joy that should make us thank God every day that I be on the other side not able to believe no matter what you do but you now today somebody just present a message to you and automatically you believe and as you begin to eat receive the word of God you are growing the the the mystery of God that was hidden all this age God come to you by the midst of his word and explaining to you and tell you you are not just you you w born by by mistake no you were born by coincident God orchestrated that from generation to generation God was looking after you God bring different people from different from different background to bring you to a point where the word of God will come in contact with you and all of a sudden maybe you you pick up the book on the road side or somebody come to to you and talk to you or whatever you were in the church somebody speak to you and you said that is nothing but the truth and you receed the word of God and when you receive the word of God what what happened God the Redemption program I preach a message one time the movie the title of the movie of God in Redemption claim God is this big Ator you know in the movie listen to this I close with this you know back home when we watch movie I ask myself why is it that any actor of the movie never die any actor of the movie Never Die you see all got accident all of a sudden you see him coming out from the other side I asked myself then one day as I was studing I said okay I see where these people pick this inspiration do you know the great AR we are the part of that AR the devil set up everything all of a sudden he bring Tri and did the trial hit you and all of a sudden the devil say oh I get this brother before he finish see you coming out on the that end and you become the actor of the movie that is what and the devil is wondering who are these kind of people no matter what I throw against them they come to the church no matter what I do they are happy no matter what they do they believe the what kind of people are this let me tell you the devil listen we are super super race we are not like Eve this bride God before the foundation of the world God pray me through I already be praying through the devil can't do anything until God finish with me I don't care the devil might try to do anything to hinder me he can't hinder God and since he can't hinder God and God is living Brother Joseph my brother the Bible says righteous man for seven times and he will rise up and that is why we are the aror of this movie we are the actor we will never die inside this movie Amen in this movie of redemption my brother God specially select you my brother he said you are the one to complete the program of redemption therefore when you wake up in the morning look at yourself in the mirror he said I'm wonderfully made that's why everywhere I go my brothers and sister I only declare there is no some no brother as a handsome brother Joseph no brother is more intelligent as Brother Joseph why because I was wonderfully made that is what God made me and that what God Made You therefore we are not just passing by here we are here to shake the kingdom of darkness oh said Brother Joseph I don't have power to he no no no we don't have power but we have authority we are not given power no but we have the authority of Jesus Christ behind us that if only you can just use that Authority in any situation you know the devil think he can frustrate the bride no no it's too late he said the prophet said the devil will do everything against this bride until himself say is frustrated that is why we are the actor of the of this movie why are we actors because the Life of Christ is in us we carry life no I I read one quote and I will close this quote is one of the most my most favorite quote you see in the message listen to this oh Hallelujah just give me just give me a minute the prophets in the message that day on Calvary the prophet said the first thing I want to say Jesus never leave for himself his life was spent for others that quote what is what prepared me to go to the mission field that quote is what prepared me to go to the jungles out there just to be able to tell people the message of the hour the message that have life the message that can take prostitute out from that condition and make him a messy that can take a drug ad that make him a preacher a message that can take innocent a unworthy servant and look at William Brown's life look at your life you might say oh right not let me tell you I'm here to BU trumpet to tell you that you're specially made listen said he said Jesus never Liv for himself his life was spent for other that is part internal life when you say you go to church and you do good that is fine but when you live your life for yourself you have eternal life but eternal life is living for others let us try to live for others not so much in giving in so much protic Christ this message to your fellow human being and when you do that because where is life today there's life is not on the street this is where the life is and God is depending on me and you whether where you at work whe whether you at work going on just let your light shine if you if you can't preach it's okay if you have a book just stretch your hand and that book may be something that will change your internal destination that book might be what will heal them from cancer that book might be something that will trans just transfer their life in such a way that when they were heading to they make a urn like we don't know where the SE are God is depending on on because we see things are Runing up very quickly but it is time for us we that carry life to Project Life to somebody to project the prophet said when you project love and when that love stop Sovereign Grace will take over therefore when you go to you see some how do you project Lord if you know this message transform your life why can't you find a way to live for your brother live for your sister live for your friend you don't need to explain nothing no this message is capable explaining itself if you present it in a good way if you just use the the the the wisdom of God to say brother try this if you said no take it back you see I give you a testimony where I was working my my brother they know the scripture there are these people you know the the the most difficult people to deal with are people who are religious who knows the Bible back and forth you can't change them that is the hard note to break and this guy knows the Bible back and forth and I studied the brother and we're working together it's my it's my boss and I said okay some tell me probably I I went too fast I just give him seven Church ages you know those intelligent people what they do now if you give them book they they go and do research as he go and do the research the first that came is all those people who tell about William Brown the next day the guy just came he just give me the book I didn't ask no question something tell me just be quiet is said okay I said thank you brother I took the book a day two weeks I didn't ever talk about the message about the book never sometime for me I have a way when they are talking I will inest something I pull it back again and they were he were talking with my supervisor and I threw something there and he turned back said do you really believe that I said well I believe that I said okay now he was having a he was having a problem with one of the employer and the employer I think went to report him for harassment and he came to me because he saw me because I don't talk about when they talking I I slep something in there he said Mr Joseph please I want your advice on this how is he going to deal with this this lady I said okay I said brother the only thing I will tell you is that probably you are hard with this this sister and anything he tell them that you do they're going to believe her you have to be very careful because the guy act like a general like an army even myself when he come to office I get scared I said maybe you have to at least relax a little bit therefore people can relate with you he said that's it I said not only that but are you a Christian he said oh I used to be a Christian I said I know because you you know your Bible very well I said but the best thing to do is to pro project love to this sister when you project love they know that you love them but if you are coming to the office I see you know everything any mistake you'll be in trouble because they will believe her I said project love this brother listen he said Mr Joseph you are a man of wisdom I said no I'm not a man of wi I'm just telling what the Bible said now that opened a door for me to talk to him about about God I never present William Braham since that day I never talk about book I don't talk about will BR until I able to contact your spirit know whether you there's something there otherwise I will not because the denomination have been taught that the last prophet is Jesus Christ therefore when you present Jesus Christ at the Forefront you just you show them off then I tell we start talking all of a sudden he said Mr Joseph h i i this is interesting one day brother Glenn one of the Min in our church was preaching I just told him please can I just I want to listen it was evening service said go ahead then I put my something on my ears he said Mr you said no no no no I want to hear him too I said wow I said good and I open up both of us were watch watching and brother Glenn is from Trad and this brother is from trinda immediately he he asking he said oh is that brother from tra I said yes he said oh wow this brother he was more attentive than me than myself he was listening to the to what brother brother Glenn was preaching after he finished he said Brother Joseph I have every time since that time asking me questions and up to where we are everybody in there he will come me what do you think about this what do you think about that what do you think about that because he has a spiritual Pride that is what the from the Pentecostal even if for me I believe because the way you present the message they may not receive it that time give them time to process it and when you see that coming with different question something is dealing with your soul and that is what I'm praying for that guy he knows the scripture before you quote anything he knows everything and people like that it is very difficult to deal with but if you have life in your office you Project Life if life is there life will respond Amen Let Us stand hallelujah our heavenly father I Just Want to Thank You Jesus I give you praise oh God
