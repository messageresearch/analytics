You know, Brother Junior was talking about, you know, God meeting our needs last week, you know, and whether they be spiritual or financial or whatever whatever they may be. But I had told uh I told dad this week and I told Tim we had uh we had a job we quoted like a probably a two-month project and and the guy hadn't got back to us and I thought oh well you know it's probably probably going to he's sold off and and so he give us a deposit this week you know and that just that'll carry us right through into like you know the end of January maybe even the end of February depending on how far he goes with it and yeah I just praise the Lord you Oh, so uh you know last winter was really slow and we kind of were realizing you know last week and brother Junior mentioned that and it kind of caught me and I was like you know God can take care of everything you know and and uh so I just praise his praise his name for that. Amen. So man each one of us have different needs. Amen. He can he can meet each each need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing uh I will enter his gates. He has made me glad.

[music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; each fall and hears me when I call. Amen. He sure does hear us when we call. Amen. So, Amen. We're going to ask uh we got a few prayer requests. So, Dad's going to come this morning and just kind of read read them off and uh then we'll go in prayer. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; praise you, Jesus. Praise his name. Amen. Amen. Jesus, man. God bless you this morning. There just many needs uh before the throne this morning. Sister Cindy's in Sarnia Hospital and we talked to her yesterday and she's going to London um the first of the week um for surgery and I believe the surgery is a 50/50 chance that she would even live. Um but it's a surgery that you know if she does live she it would help her to walk and and different things and just Sister Cindy's ready to go to heaven. She's begging God to take her to heaven. She's she's we don't visit her without her crying saying, "Lord, I I ask you to take me home." Her moment she she she clearly clearly says that God showed her that her mom and dad are waiting for her. Dan, brother Danny Funk's waiting for her. &gt;&gt; She has no problem going home. She has more problem staying here. And just so let's remember her &gt;&gt; and and just Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, if either one of us was in that state. Amen. The compassion that that we would need. Also, sister Margaret and brother Leu Lu from Uganda. Our family, they're not here yet. Um he lost his father. Amen. And um she just let us know that yesterday. And uh I'm not sure if they go home, but I do know the customs of Uganda. If you don't show up at a funeral, you're really an outcast. Um, and especially it being his father, that would just be probably not prohibited almost. Um, but just remember them that they lost. And um, also let's remember Jamaica. &gt;&gt; Um, it's uh, it it really needs our prayers. Amen. They um they said I'm sure many of you have heard different things, but they said since bookkeeping, since as long as they've done recordkeeping, there will never hit something like this before. And they said common winds will be 150 to 160, but they said the winds could reach 204 to 29 miles an hour. I can't even comprehend what that would be like. There's nothing standing that will be left standing. And they could reach up to 50 inches of rain. That's like beyond belief. I mean, just um and the worst part of it all, it's going to be for 3 days. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; so [snorts] &gt;&gt; you can just imagine brother Junior here and his wife and little boy is in their house alone over there. I mean, and I I I've talked to brother Osborne. I talked to him even this morning. He and and it was just a short clip. They have no electric. But uh it he said he said it's not he last night he said Dale it's not good. Amen. So yeah. Yeah. So you just remember Uganda. Amen. Or Jamaica. Sorry. Jamaica. And also uh uh brother William or brother William's dad. Brother hos uh brother Jose's son-in-law. his dad uh Dreardo in the in El Salvador is the pastor there. I preached for him uh at least twice, multiple times. Every time I went and preached for him, he got he's been notified he's got stomach cancer. And uh William had called me and uh William said, "You wouldn't believe how much he's failed since Sunday." That was just like 7 days ago. [snorts] And he's not eaten or that like he if God don't do a miracle, he will totally be gone. Amen. Let's ask brother Bernard to please come and and pray for these needs. Amen. And just that God can God can do miracles. Amen. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Nothing's too hard for God. He knows exactly what he's doing. But he can heal these just not only from our prayer. We're going to hear that this morning, but he can fix these situations by your love and compassion for those people. Amen. God bless you, brother. Let's pray.

Lord, let's remember these prayer [music] requests. Your beautiful name we pray. [music] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats and just we'll just uh thank your musicians, but I'm going to sing that song before we Man, I just wanted to just pray that you will remember these prayer requests and and we apologize for the halt. Was it hot, brother M? Man, were we able to change the battery, Tim? Or um we apologize for the furnace in the You could uh when you get up, you could message village in the hall. It just decided not to work today. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just uh we're thankful though in all things you can give thanks. We're thankful that it didn't decide to work when it was minus 20 and nobody was here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that would have been quite a water problem. Amen. But uh we just let's just remember these prayer requests and sister Margaret you have our condolence and and the family and our great condolence and I can you know we have a great hope that we'll meet again but it on this earth it'll never quite be the same you know because uh we have loved ones that we miss. Amen. And uh did did the brother go did he go home? Did brother go oh no. Okay. Yeah. Wow. Can you imagine missing your daddy's funeral because of distance? God bless our brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just I just wanted to give a testimony from the and we're going to sing a song before we preach. We had a a wonderful time when we were gone and I know you had a wonderful time here with brother Junior and and uh but just to give you a little bit of history and kind of what we did and I I believe that would be okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um um so we left we left early Saturday morning and and uh Akran, Ohio's about not quite 5 hours and and so uh we met the pastor at the church and uh he took us to Mexican restaurant and uh by our strong approval uh right down the road and and uh but before we went he showed us a church and like they rent a place. It's very It's very similar congregation to us or maybe just slightly smaller but but very slightly but uh I I can tell you this they they just showed us amazing kindness. They bought us a amazing room for two nights at the comfort in suites and and it was fantastic. It was actually close enough that Saturday night we walked over to the church and and it was also close enough to walk to the Mexican restaurant. That's very important. Very important stuff. But uh uh you know uh this uh pastor Jesse has uh they just had their ninth child and their oldest son is 21. So their youngest uh girl was 5 months. Amen. And so uh we've invited him here as that's originally how our friendship had happened. And uh we've also invited them to camp and uh so but you know uh every area is is just slightly uh you know you know and that's good you know God loves flavor and different flowers and that they just could not believe they just could not believe that we would drive 5 hours and get a passport to come and see them. The whole boys I would have went a lot further than that. They just couldn't believe it. every every time we met him, every time of his service and everything, they said, "Can you imagine?" They went and got their pastors, drove 5 hours to come see us. I just couldn't believe it. So, I I have a feeling with his family, they don't go far. He's a school teacher, teaches full-time. And his kids, I just uh show you how his family supported it was kind of similar to us. Uh his oldest son uh does lead songs. They have two services on Sunday, Sunday night. But he was self-taught in the piano. Elliot, I thought of you. It was &gt;&gt; it was uh wow could he like he was a concertous performer and he never took one message. He couldn't read one note but he could just the the piano was like jumping off the floor. It was just unbelievable. And then you know they just you know they you know we were meeting their family. Well actually we prayed before we went to the service and there was a little tiny girl like Leah there and and so she was part of the musician. and we're praying for her and and you know I've never seen him before. Never even seen the pastor before and she was the drummer and wow she was the drummer in heaven. I can tell you that because it was just unbelievable this just little tiny girl that the whole building was vibr like we were just blown away. We said who is that? uh just just a little tiny girl and and uh you know another girl played accordion or organ and another girl did the sound and the videos and everything. So it was uh very similar but they had many many African people there uh at least three families two two and a grandma I think and uh just just uh you know many single brothers there was three or four single brothers and different things and uh and then we Monday we we left there with we we had amazing fellowship amazing services and they their kindness they give us a the gift that we don't deserve and and uh and have us invited back for April. And uh um anyway, so Monday we went over to see Luan's brother that had open heart surgery, triple bypass, and uh and some of his arteries were 99% blocked and we didn't let him know we were coming. So he was driving around in the yard and he was very very shocked and surprised. And we also seen her her sister and uh so we met her sister. We we seen the brother and you know we we slept in the shed. They have a very nice shed. [snorts] We stayed there in the shed on Monday night and then we went to see her sister at a Mexican restaurant on Tuesday and then we drove up to John Laura Garrett's and we took them to another Mexican restaurant in uh Fort Wayne and uh then we had great amazing fellowship with them. Uh stayed up late just visiting and and sharing the gospel and God's goodness. And then we uh had breakfast with them. On Wednesday, we come over to uh Dayton, Ohio to Paula Fontaine's church. And uh uh it was just uh really fantastic to see another church operate on Wednesday night. It's a it's a very if you haven't been there, it's a very big church. It's probably 300 people um or close to that on a Sunday. But I I I was I was I was warning Lan how it was going to be on Wednesday because I had been there on Wednesday before and Brother Paul had told me what it was like. A lot of their people they have people that drive like two three hours to church hours like well there's many people drive from Windsor to brother Paul the Fontaine's church. Anyway, there was a lot of people there and and the their kindness. Brother Paul's just a wonderful brother and and he has been uh extremely kind to us and you know, brother Paul Fontaine's church is one of the closest uh sister churches that you know reaches out to us and and that like they're closer than even brother Jose and Kitchener. Um and uh but we seen multiple people the all Julie you seen all the all of Quebec was there the Frenchman everybody from Quebec's movement to Paul Fontaine's church or a lot of them. Amen. And uh we had a wonderful time. So we just praise God for that. But uh we you know I told the church there I said next to the Holy Ghost next to salvation maybe next to your wife or husband the greatest thing that you will experience on this earth is meeting the other part of Christ &gt;&gt; while you're still here &gt;&gt; you're going to spend eternity together &gt;&gt; and if you get to meet them here &gt;&gt; it was just unbelievable that you you know Pastor Jesse we had communicated of course and I've watched many of his videos and and that but it was just unbelievable the unity and the and the kindred spirit spirit and it was just it was supernatural. Uh even though we hadn't seen in the flesh, we had been together in him before the foundation of the world. It was just really really really good. So, Amen. Amen. I guess I got to get out of this to get my Esther. I need you to help me sing this. [clears throat] We'd like to sing a song before we [music] just encourage you to listen to the words more than [snorts] uh Oh, here you can uh [snorts] you know uh you know uh every one of you's have a gift, a special gift, &gt;&gt; but I have never seen a gift like in the Lefontaine family [music] to write songs. It is it is beyond supernatural. [music] &gt;&gt; I mean, if if that's possible, which it ain't. But brother Paul Devontaine wrote this song in 1988 [music] when the world was trying to make a peace agreement in Israel. Man, listen to the words. Amen. While living [singing] below, everywhere that I go, this world's full of [singing] trouble and pain. [music] There's murder and crime. It's at the end time when everyone's going insane. [singing and music] But I found a release and my heart is at peace with the word of [singing] the hour snuggled in with troules unto my anchor still holds [music] to Jesus [singing] again and this world is falling aart. I'm so glad Jesus lays down [singing and music] in my heart. I'm carried away by the light of today. As this world is so dismal [singing] and dark, while there struggles and trles outside, something is [singing] stiring inside of the bride. As the world gets the dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad Jesus [singing] lives down in my heart. They're praying for peace, for a hostage release while holding a gun in their hand. There's moral decay, a great falling away in the shape this world in it won't [singing] stand but let it crumble and fall. I'm not bothered at all in the cl of the rock I can hide. When it all comes undone, I'm trusting in one who gives me [singing] this peace down inside. But this word is falling apart. I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my heart. I'm carried away with the light of today. Amen. While there struggles and troubles outside, something is stiring inside of the bride. As the world gets so dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down in my heart. Let's sing the chorus. [music] This word is falling apart. I'm so glad Jesus [music] lives down in my heart. I'm carried away [singing] with the light of today. As the world gets so dismal and dark, while there struggles and trles outside, something is stiring [singing] inside of the bride. As the world gets so dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad Jesus [music] lives down [singing] in my heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Maybe we'll stand and honey, you could text village. Amen. We'll just turn over to God bless you. It's just a great honor and we desperately love you, dearly love you in Christ. First uh John or sorry, just John 13:34 and 35. Amen. I believe this will be our fourth uh fourth part to love. And I believe if if God will let me, this will be our last part. Amen. Next Sunday or next week, Brother Ben Nor will be here. &gt;&gt; Saturday service is 3:00 Sunday at regular time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. John 13:34. A new commandment I give you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. But this shall all men know, that ye are my disciples, if you love one another. Let's read that first verse again. This ain't an option, brothers and sisters. This is a commandment. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you. Now that he gave his life for us, that ye also love one another. Lord God, I pray that that you will catch the this uh atmosphere, Lord God, which I know you have. We thank you for your presence. Bless your bride that's present here, Lord God. But Lord, I pray that you can use your servant to portray this thought to your people, Lord God. And may they catch the revelation of of who you are in this thought, Lord God, we pray. And what you've shared through me or shared to me, Lord God, we pray. Bless your bride. In your name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. In the message discerning the spirits a man here brother Bram said the action of God to know that God the action of God in one another draws us together for we are one in Christ Jesus and God's purpose is to bring us together. See God's purpose you know brother said the reason he was against the spirit of denomination was because they built wall and divided the brotherhood. Amen. God's spirit is exactly the opposite. When he here, the prophet says, he says, "When a man's anointed by the spirit of God and he's got the action of God, that action will never break us up." &gt;&gt; So, just think of every time you're broken up, it's never the spirit of God. The action will draw us together for we're one in Christ. Amen. Just look over just laying a little foundation. We're going to look into this some things that God showed us here in John 15:12 and 14 uh John 15:12-13, sorry. And my commandment that ye love one another that as I have loved you, greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Amen. You see that first scripture we read that we're to have the same love as Christ and he left the splendor of heaven to get his beard pulled to be called the devil &gt;&gt; to be spit upon falsely accused &gt;&gt; for me &gt;&gt; that that's an amazing love. Amen. Here's the Bible saying no greater love has anybody than he would very seldom would somebody lay down their love their life &gt;&gt; for their love. Here here another uh just a short quote here. He said the world's dying for love. There's something wrong. And he said he said what we need today is a baptism of love for one another. Amen. And you know we looked into that in great detail and every every example of being having the baptism every evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit was [snorts] love. Everything God is is love. The word of God is love. God is love. God protects his love. Amen. And brother Bram tells the story. You know, I got a bunch of this off this message. Uh he he brother preached love in uh 56. And if if you it's a great I've listened to it multiple times in our in our house. Amen. But he uses many examples. And one of the example he's used is a daughter that went off to college. And I I know you've all heard this, but I can only repeat what uh bring it to your memory. the daughter that went off to school and she got new friends and of course the new friends then know her family and and they they thought you know I I'll tell you this that blood runs thicker than friends by the way &gt;&gt; the family of God is the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know I can remember you know you you can't have a close relationship that somebody how can two walk together unless they agree &gt;&gt; and it's part of the family of God will be will be an unbreakable thing. And so she was this girl being young. She brought home her new friend [clears throat] and she was coming home on the train and and there was a woman standing out there and her friend before she had said that that was her mother. Her friend said, "What an ugly person that is outside the train." And this girl being young and and immature and embarrassed, that was her mother. And so she avoided her mother because she didn't want her friend to see her mother was ugly. She was living a double life. &gt;&gt; You can't live a double life. &gt;&gt; You can't have love at church and hate your family. &gt;&gt; You can't have love at church and hate your boss. You can't love have here in the family of God and then go up town and hate the people in the grocery store. You can't have that kind of love. &gt;&gt; That's cheap garbage love. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here the train man seen all this happening and he was overcome with emotion and he went up to that daughter and he reminded her of what she already knew. He said, "Your mom was twice as beautiful as you when she was your age, but because of love when your house was on fire and nobody would go through the fire to save you, and you would have died. You would have burnt alive. Your mother ran through the flames uncovered and her flesh fell off &gt;&gt; because of love. That's more beautiful &gt;&gt; than what people will avoid you for because of appearances. &gt;&gt; That's a beauty that money can't buy. &gt;&gt; That's that's a that's a nature that's inside that that you know, if we were in those situations, we don't really know what we would do until we live that out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We really don't. The keys on the desk, honey, corner of my desk. You know, it's the love that God's required of us is this kind of love. And this love, not only will it change our church, &gt;&gt; it'll change everybody you touch, &gt;&gt; it'll change the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It'll change the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will literally change the world. You know, when we have our prayer requests today, you know, there's people that are going through a terrible hurricane and there's people that's lost loved ones. It'll be love that'll heal. I'm going to show you an example where brother Bram had had blind healing and he never prayed. Remember the good Samaritan? There was compassion. &gt;&gt; The world's dying for compassion, love. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said telling you brother and sister there's only one thing that can enter heaven is perfect love. He said not because you're loyal to Brandon Tabernacle or to your he mentions many denominational churches. He said they're all right but he said you should be. He said, "But old friends," he said, "if you because I've spoke in tongues or danced in the spirit or or went to church or cast out devils or moved mountains with faith." He said, "All of them are all right and they're good." But he said, "Unless you have real, perfect, genuine love. That's all that was there." He's talking about be when he went behind the curtain time, he said that's where perfect love was. And to get there, you're going to have it before you go. He said, "And that's the only thing that'll ever let you in there. That's the only thing that can stay there. It's the only thing that there was." Oh my. He said, "That's adoption. Perfect love." &gt;&gt; Man, I don't know if you're able to pull these up, Vicki, when you can. He said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, it'll take perfect love to put you in that place, for that's all that was there." Amen. You think of all I It's just It never I don't know. It's been a long time since I had a scripture affect me as much as a good Samaritan. What must I do to inherit eternal life? [snorts] We're so concerned about all our doctrines and the seven seals and all the message and memorizing and they're good. They're they're the truth. &gt;&gt; Even memorizing the Bible, but just compassion. &gt;&gt; Perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what money or how religious you are or how good a deeds you've ever done, he said that won't count nothing on that day. It'll take perfect love. So whatever you do, lay everything aside. else until you find and you're full of the love of God till you can love those who hate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I want to I want to share something. You can't make the ones that hate you love you, &gt;&gt; but you can still love them. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that when you love them, you actually put coals of fire on their head because they can't figure out this love because it's not natural love. &gt;&gt; It's supernatural love. Here is another one. It's beyond the curtain of time. This is a later quote. He said, "I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it'll take perfect love to enter that place. And there will be no jealousy, no tiredness, no sickness, and no age, old age, no death, only supreme beauty and joy. And whatever you do, lay aside everything." You know, you know, when we when we grow into this statue of a perfect man, you'll recognize trying to change everybody around you, it doesn't really matter. &gt;&gt; You don't you a matter of fact, not only do you not have to be like me, you probably don't want to be like me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why can't we just get this unconditional love &gt;&gt; and accept people where they're at and try to understand their situation? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet shows us this perfectly. He said, "Whatever you do, lay aside everything and find perfect love and get to where you can love everyone, even your enemy. No matter if the planes are rocking and the lights are flashing and the guns of the enemy are around you, those things don't matter. Get perfect love. And if you're not saved, accept Jesus as your savior now. And if you've been baptized in water, be baptized now. And if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, press on to perfect love. It'll take you to that beautiful, joyful place beyond the curtain of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything in our Christian walk is love. It's not being right. That's that's the part that that that we have made a mistake on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; God. Everybody in the Bible were wrong. &gt;&gt; God still loved them. &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF GOD'S PROPHETS made mistakes. &gt;&gt; It didn't change that they were God's prophets. God loved them unconditionally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're looking for this some kind of earthly perfection in people. &gt;&gt; That don't exist. &gt;&gt; Love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us &gt;&gt; here. He said, "Then a voice spake behind me and he said, that's what you preach the Holy Ghost is. It's perfect love and nothing can enter here without it." God help us. Let's look in First John 3 11-14. [clears throat] And I'm going to show you how Brother Bram shows us this story. We're going right into that after this. He said, "For this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another." In verse 14, "And know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. And he that loveth his brethren abideth, he that loveth not, sorry, his brethren abideth in death. Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us. How should we ought to lay down our lives for our brethren? You know, I want I you know, when you look at that, that's Bible. And when you look at this next story and you show how the prophet did, I was thinking of this as even a parent. I I would I would if you're not in this seat, that's all right. But I I wonder if how many of us parents wouldn't even have this kind of love for our kids. If you look real deep inside yourself, it's a part of the human body that if we can't change something and fix something, we say, "Well, not my problem. &gt;&gt; It's not my fault. They chose that." &gt;&gt; But that's not God. &gt;&gt; You could think right now and you could think of the people in Jamaica and you say, "Well, I don't live there." Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, there's always been hurricanes go through there. &gt;&gt; Why would anybody stay there? &gt;&gt; You see how we just exclude everything? Parents, when your kids grow up and they whatever they would do to come into adulthood and they would struggle or whatever avenue it would be, it's like, well, I tried to show them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we all tried to show them, &gt;&gt; but you love them in their mistakes. You love them when it don't work out their decisions they made &gt;&gt; and you knew better. But you say, "Well, you know, it's real easy to say, well, I I said told you so under my breath, &gt;&gt; compassion. Remember, keep this love. Compassion is love." And so, you know, you can look at, you know, I want I want to just slow down this quote. This quote is about Mexico. And, you know, most of the world don't live like North America and UK. &gt;&gt; And so, you can think of people that are not as as uh physically placed as you financially or comfort and you can brush that off real easy. And if you find somebody that almost bankrupts himself at home to try to make that change, people will almost well they won't understand. Shut the door, Jerry. Um, they won't understand. &gt;&gt; But God understood. And God showed this kind of love through a prophet. And I I I just want to I want you to try, you know, we can we can all try to justify our situation. You know, you know, I I want to say this. So, the one brother that came that was a visitor to the camp meeting and we've been to his house and he has a sign right up on uh on in his house and he you help me out how the sign says but he says we we live we simply live so others can actually simply live &gt;&gt; and they had loads of money &gt;&gt; but they're staying in an apartment in an H home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there was times that he told he's Pentecostal, by the way. And there was times he told us that he'd give tens of thousands for people to build churches. Tens of thousands. I about fell over. A matter of fact, I did fall over inside. Now, it's not I'm not saying to give your money away and we have to have a house to stay in, you know, like, &gt;&gt; but I want to show you that compassion is eternal life. So, you you know I I want a nicer house than what I'm in. That's that's not evil. But do you still have compassion for the people that don't have a house? Man, &gt;&gt; that's why that's why, you know, Brother Bram tried to take many people to the mission field and every one of you people here should come with me sometime because you can't go and come home the same. It's not possible. &gt;&gt; You're I'll just tell you ahead of time, you're not strong enough. &gt;&gt; I know you're not strong enough. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I thought I was strong. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells this and I I I like &gt;&gt; it's just a really good example here. He said [clears throat] a few weeks ago he said, "I was standing on the platform before thousands and thousands of people in Mexico and he said an old Mexican brother come up and he was blind. We probably wouldn't have let him in his church because he would have smelled. He would have been dirty. And he had a shaw laying over him that was dusty and dirty. That would have bothered me because I would have had the vacuum. And the poor old fellow had a little cross in his hand. He was doing Hail Mary. And I said, "That's not necessary." And so he come up and he wanted to know and he came to him and he said, "I seen his gray hair under his big straw hat. Didn't he know he wasn't supposed to wear a straw hat in church &gt;&gt; where he had pulled it down? And he was saying something in Spanish and I couldn't understand him. They were interpreting it. [cough] Excuse me. And he put his arm on my shoulder and he said something struck me. He said, 'I looked at him about 70 and I said, that would have been about the age of my old daddy if he would have been living. And he said, I looked at his feet, he didn't have any shoes, and I thought maybe he's never had a pair of shoes. He said, "All of a sudden, something began to move in me." And he said, "I put my foot up beside his to see if they would fit him." And I thought, "If my shoes will fit him, I'll just take them off right now and I'll just give them to him cuz maybe he's never had a pair of shoes." And he said, "I pulled up close to him. if my shoulders and he was a wider man than me, I would have given him my coat. And some of you are sitting here and you think, well, that has nothing to do with the gospel. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with the seven seals. That's just &gt;&gt; it had nothing to do with it. You know, brother Bam said another place he said when he crossed the US into the Mexico border and he seen a baby with a big stomach in Mexico and they were he was starving to death. That's why he was bloated. He said, "That boy deserves to live as much as my kids at home do." &gt;&gt; He's made in the image of God. &gt;&gt; But it's so easy that we can just exclude from that and we just say, "Well, I I know there's not one of us here that could feed all of the world." But do you even care? &gt;&gt; You're going to spend eternity with some of those people that starve to death in this message. Brother Bram talked about us building palaces of churches here, million-dollar churches and missionaries going living on water and no shoes. That's not God. &gt;&gt; That's not the God I want to serve. &gt;&gt; Even though I like things nice things here, I'm driving a nice car. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said I loved him something or another. I loved him. And I thought, look at there, that old fellow. Maybe he's never sat and ate a decent meal in his life. And maybe he's never wore a pair of shoes and his old rusty scuffy looking feet and his toenails all turned up. And I thought, that poor old fellow, he's got just as much right to a good pair of shoes as I do. You know, sometimes, and this is just general, but sometimes you young kids come up, you get your first job, you go out and buy a 100 pair of shoes. What about the person that don't even have a one pair? &gt;&gt; That's not good stewardship. That's called stupidity. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam calls it something. He calls it selflove. &gt;&gt; And in Leo, there's a lot of self-love. I have that quote. &gt;&gt; It's all about me and mine and my hund pair of shoes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Said, "He's got just as much right to a pair of shoes and just as much right to wear a good coat as I do, and I got just as much right to sit down to a good meal as I have." And besides all that, the devil's blinded him. [clears throat] So, see what? And something entered into me. Watch. You need to hear this word. And he said, "It was not me." Wait a minute. We all got the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit. Oh, God. Was talking to me. Wait a minute. He's just talking about poorness and money. That don't got nothing to do with the seven seals. That don't got nothing to do with the mysteries. This is the greatest mystery of all right here. Compassion. You don't think so? It's eternal life. &gt;&gt; He said, "It wasn't not me. The Holy Spirit, oh God, was talking to me into the feeling." And oh, when you come to project life by taking it into the feeling of love for that old man. You know, Brother Bram talked about this in many of the other things we'd read about when somebody makes a mistake and they're down, what do they need? They don't need your correction. They just need &gt;&gt; love. You don't need to preach to them. They already heard that sermon. They turned from that sermon. They need love. &gt;&gt; And just then, I put my his arms or just then he put his arms around my shoulder and began to weep on my shoulder and something happened. And I thought that cursed blind devil that blind this poor man that has never had any kind of privileges in his life. And I said, well, blind spirit come out of him and all of a sudden he opened his eyes and began to scream, I can see. I can see. He said, what was it? &gt;&gt; It was praying. It was fasting. &gt;&gt; It was studying the message so we can fight. &gt;&gt; It was simply living so others can just simply live. &gt;&gt; Just simply living so others could simply live. &gt;&gt; What was it? Projecting the love of the Holy Spirit. the evidence of the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; compassion, and that's the way it happened. You know, Brother Bam goes right into this. If you listen to this love message, and I didn't put this down, I was actually going to skip it, but he talked about the maniac that come up. He goes immediately right into this, this message of love. [snorts] And he said when that maniac was coming in, he told Brother, "I'm going to break every bone in your body." And he had had a history of hurting other pastors. All the pastors on the platform flee and ran away from him. Brother Bram stood there and you know what brother Bam said in this love message in 56 he said he said I thought oh you poor brother you've got that spirit on you and he said he fell on my feet. He said I had compassion for the man that was going to come up and hurt me. He said I thought I I'm just from paragraphs. said, "Oh, that poor brother has got this on him and to come up and attack me." And it was a projection of love. &gt;&gt; It was a projection of compassion on a maniac. &gt;&gt; That made him fall across his feet. Now, I I I know some of you are looking at me kind of strange, weird like this, but Brother Bram actually give multiple examples. You know the example about the bull? That's about as weird out as you can get. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know when brother Bam said that the love projected the bull went down, he apologized to the bull for coming in his house. &gt;&gt; I've never done that yet to any of my cows. &gt;&gt; I know that's a bit crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you remember the beast story? He also apologized to the bees. I would have got the blaster &gt;&gt; to kill them. See, this ain't natural. &gt;&gt; That's why it's easy not to worry about people that I'm I'm not saying I'm not saying give your money. I'm just you just do whatever you can live with God and and survive. &gt;&gt; But if you have no thought of it or no character, you know, it's like these prayer requests that we prayed for. We were preparing for church and we were thinking, I don't mean that I'm anybody, but you can be like this this week. Every time I woke up in the night, me and my wife, it was like Jamaica. Jamaica pray sister Cindy, this the family that lost their father. It was like I wake like it was just I I was I went to bed consumed with it. &gt;&gt; Somebody's lost the father. Somebody's lost the grandfather. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody's hiding for their life. Somebody's wife's there without their husband there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you know why you had to be in that spirit of prayer &gt;&gt; was first you had to get in the spirit of compassion &gt;&gt; cuz &gt;&gt; I was sleeping &gt;&gt; right but it's not just coming to a specific spot and that's all right if we do and and kneeling down that but you can be in the spirit of caring and and praying for these needs that that there's there's people already but there's going to be people die in Jamaica A die. Period. &gt;&gt; They're going to die [crying and screaming] and we just Oh, which restaurant are we going to go to? Mexicans. See how easy it is to just, you know, I could I could personally testify that every time I come home from especially Africa, especially Uganda, I was messed up for at least a month. cuz every time I got in my vehicle or every time I every time I bought a coffee that was $2, I think, well, there's people work all day for that. I couldn't justify nothing. It was just it it just it just twisted my mind. &gt;&gt; Pastor Leo works five and a half days a week. He works Saturday morning. He gets $55 Canadian. He can work all week overtime and he can't gas up the van that this church bought for him. Amen. We can't maybe change that. But do we even care? &gt;&gt; It'll show. Amen. See how the blind man it was it was when God's love projected what healed the blind man in Mexico. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown taught us. He said, "You know, if I'm going to pray for you, I have to put myself in your shoes. I have to walk a mile in your moccasins." Some of you parents that have kids that are struggling or that, just try to be a kid. &gt;&gt; Just try to relive their age again. Maybe you remember when you were a kid, there was no halo over your head either. &gt;&gt; Just compassion, &gt;&gt; love. Amen. 1 John 2. Brethren, a new commandment. 2:7. It's 11. It's really 10 I want. But brethren, I write a new commandment onto you. But the old commandment which you had from the beginning, and the old commandment, the world which you heard from the beginning, and again a new commandment I write unto you, which things is true in him and in you, because darkness is passed, and true light now shineth. And he that saith that he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now. But 10 is the one we really But he that loveth his brother abideth in the light. And there is no occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness and walketh in the darkness. and knoweth neither he goeth because the darkness has blinded his eyes. Now I'm not I'm not saying that there's hatred but you know in some situations our country has blinded our eyes. Distance has blinded our eyes. &gt;&gt; Comfort has blinded our eyes. And I like I said I'm not I'm not we're not taking up a missionary offering. That's that's entirely between you and God. But I'm just saying there's others. Do you see what I mean? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham didn't have to feel for the man. Brother Bram didn't have to give the blind man his clothes. &gt;&gt; Wasn't his problem. Brother Brandham was already a poor man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Dirt poor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it was something that he came up from inside him &gt;&gt; was God. &gt;&gt; It was a spirit of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the scripture, by their love for one another will shall all men know. We I think we've kind of failed in that area. Man, I I want to just tell you a little story. This come up fresh. And this wasn't regarding love, but wow, it was a weird experience. And and and you can ask my wife separately. After Paul Fontaine, we had an eight. We hadn't ate since breakfast. And they had a wonderful Wednesday service just I mean they had specials and I mean it was I told the way I said I couldn't believe the way that people were entering into worship and wouldn't leave after we fellowship all and they would have talked some of them like it was just overwhelming and we left there we went to the only restaurant that was still open &gt;&gt; a bar and grill I hadn't ate since breakfast and you know I wasn't carrying my Bible. [clears throat] I took my tie and vest off and just for so you all know I had bibs on underneath of it. Yeah. I went to Paula Fontaine with my bibs on and an open shirt and I put a vest on in church. So I took my vest off and I was going in this bar trying to look And everybody in that bar knew that God had walked in &gt;&gt; and it had nothing to do with me. It was Was it weird? Oh, it was so weird. The guy the lady sat us and a guy come up and I thought he was drunk. and they had been playing bingo. And he said, "Can I move you to a more quieter table? They're awful noisy. You're playing bingo." And I said, "No, no, this is fine." It was the owner. I never seen him come by again. Just sitting down. We ate a little bit and L had only got a bowl of soup. So, we actually ordered a BLT sandwich after we had ate. And the bartender when we left said, "God bless you." When we walked out of the bar and we were like, and I'll be flat out honest with you, I never said anything because I thought he was mocking. And Lanne said, "Everybody in that bar knew that a different atmosphere." We had just came from a powerful service and Paul Fonte and the first words that come out of my mouth I think I saw at the table was I looked across the way I said, "Wow, this is a lot different atmosphere than we just came from." You don't think they It was unbelievable. You want me to tell you what? We never had to open one door when we left. We walked through two doors and people held the doors for us. &gt;&gt; You don't think you're comp You don't think your presence PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IT? YOU'RE BLINDED TO IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BLINDED TO IT. YOU'RE not even recognizing the atmosphere that you're in. &gt;&gt; You're you're packing Jehovah. You can't cover him up. &gt;&gt; You can take off your vest and wear bib overhauls. Jehovah's shining out. That's right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5:25 and 28. &gt;&gt; I want to show you something here. And we're going to read a few quotes. We're not going to be we're going to close here soon, Lord willing. And this has nothing to do with relationships. We're not even going there. I want you to really hear what the prophet Paul's saying and how Christ anointed him. He said, "Husbands, love your wives." This is the part I want. Even as Christ loved the church, that means he died for us. &gt;&gt; Husbands, be willing to die for your wives. &gt;&gt; Most of us would not be. &gt;&gt; Husbands, be willing to die for your wife. Husbands, would you be willing to die for your kids? &gt;&gt; Even as Christ also loved the church, &gt;&gt; it was life and death was the love. So ought a man to love his own wives, verse 28, [snorts] as their own bodies. And because we couldn't understand how strong this love was, he said, "Anybody that loveth his wife loves himself &gt;&gt; because nobody has ever hated his own flesh." &gt;&gt; See the power in love. &gt;&gt; The love was just complete. This ain't this cheap, you know, but this was real God love. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this wasn't the filial cheap love. &gt;&gt; But when you had a God be loved. Brother Bram told the story of this. He said and and I I I fear God fears that that maybe we can do better. You know that if if a if a somebody would come up and mistreat our loved ones, we would just we would even the score. You know what I mean? we would either beat him away or if you were in the States, you'd be packing. &gt;&gt; But brother Bram said that if somebody come up and mistreated your kids or your wife, he actually said handled your wife that God's love was you would get down and pray for his soul. Brother Dale wouldn't do that. You can tell me you would, but but that's where we got to be to get there. &gt;&gt; If somebody touches my sweetheart after we get the score settled, I'll pray for his soul, but he'll be dead then, so it'll be too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's that's that's what agape love is. &gt;&gt; That it's ridiculous. It's insanity when brother Brandon he just rolls it right off his thing. He says somebody's going to mistreat and you're going to get down and say, "Well, Lord, you know, save him." He didn't mean he don't know what he's doing. See, we thought we had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You can tell that by how you would retaliate. &gt;&gt; I said ouch before you. I said ouch when this was coming to me. You know, Brother Bram said that your response to road rage could affect the person's eternal destination &gt;&gt; because we're going to even the score. &gt;&gt; Well, that you know, &gt;&gt; I know the thing popped there, but it's real. &gt;&gt; He said when he went behind the curtain of time, the only thing that was there was completely perfect love. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Here the prophet says a 64 quote. He said, "Many times we want to judge a man because he didn't agree with them. We're not to do that." Wow. We can disagree with one another and be friendly. And if you can't disagree with the man and still love him and pray for him. Wow. And pray that he would get more enlightenment. When you don't want to say nothing to him and you always want to disagree with him, be friendly because I love him. And I certainly don't want to see him lost. The person that you disagree with bitterly, would you like to see them in hell? &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Wow. See, a real Christian, the Bible says, now he knew, God knew because he's omnipotent. He knew that not all would accept him, but he would that none would be lost. That means somebody comes and robs your family, you pray that they're in heaven. I've heard things like this said, "I hope I don't want to spend time with them in heaven." So, you would hope they would go to the opposite place. &gt;&gt; You know, like the little Sunday school girl that came home from school and the the atheist was sit or come home from Sunday school and the atheist was sitting on the porch. Brother Bram tells the story and he says, "How do you know that all this stuff's real?" And he said, she said, "Well, when I get to heaven, I'll ask Jonah." It was talking about Jonah. I'll ask him. She said, 'What if he ain't there? And she said, 'Well, you can ask him at the other place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just she just believed. &gt;&gt; She just believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know which one of us if somebody really hurt your kids. Could happen. &gt;&gt; Canada's kind of changing. Y &gt;&gt; there's things happening in Toronto in Vancouver that you would have never believed would happen in this country. &gt;&gt; Do you know in Vancouver I think uh three out of four people that go up town get mugged? Think of the believers there. Think of the sisters, young sisters go up town. Four go up town together. Three get mugged. &gt;&gt; They're going to pray for that person's soul. &gt;&gt; That's a god by love. That's a place that maybe we have to get to. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it'll have to be when we get behind the curtain of time. Amen. [clears throat] Amen. God help me. I I had to digest this before I could bring it. It's it's it's something else. Amen. Love. He here the prophet says excuse me standing here on the platform he said speak this and rejoicing because I'm so happy to be here said I think God wants his children to be happy and I believe we can run it into the extremes but he said I believe that God wants his people to be real happy and sociable and friendly from our hearts loving each other as God for Christ's sake loved us. &gt;&gt; Just be happy in love. Who cares what any It don't matter if you're dressed like me, live like me, talk like me, just love. Maybe they'd want to be what you are. &gt;&gt; I think that's the way we ought to be happy Christians. I want to close with a scripture and maybe just we're we're just right. Actually, I got the end and I'm going over it. So, [snorts] Proverbs 21:2, and we mentioned this earlier, this I actually just it was it actually come over the radio when I was going to pick up bags yesterday and I immediately put it on my phone. Every man is right in his own eyes. Oh, boy. That sure took to me. Said, "Yes, sir." That's brother Dale. Every man's right in his own eyes. But God ponderth the heart. &gt;&gt; And you know what our prophet said about the heart? That's where the compassion and love dwelt. You know when you came out of God, you come out from his heart. You know when Eve come out of Adams, you come out from underneath the heart. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that we are the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amazing. Amen. You see, it's so easy to justify in place where we're at. Amen. Amen. God help us. Now, like I said, we can't you can't make people like you, but you can still be friendly to them. You can still hold the door and Amen. If somebody walks away from people walked away from Brother Brown's family because of his dad, he couldn't make them love him, &gt;&gt; but he still showed them from his side love them back. Amen. Here in Proverbs 18, and and we we really are winding this down. Proverbs 18, he said, "A man that has friends must show himself friendly." And there is a friend that stickketh closer than a brother. You know, if you if you want to be a part of God's family and and you want to be involved, you just press into it. Press into the people. You know, I I I'll confess this. When we went to Paula Fontaine's church, we'd been gone a long time. We'd been gone 5 days. I was kind of done with being gone. And we came that close to not going. And you know, you know what? Just tip there was the last straw to tip the camel's back. The man said, "Well, I've never been to the church." I said, "Oh, okay. Well, that's good." &gt;&gt; But see, if you want friends, &gt;&gt; you have to be friendly. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. push it. Invite people over. Go to their house. Go. Don't go uncalled. If you're not welcome, just leave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, watch. God help us. &gt;&gt; I want to read my last quote and we'll close on this. He said a whole lot. That's the very last one on the thing, Vicki. I got it marked. I'm not going to read it, but I'm going to read it anyway. He said when Mary and Elizabeth seen Mary come, when Elizabeth met Mary and seen her coming, he said no doubt they both I think I mentioned some of this before they both mention and they rung and hug each other like women used to do and they greet each other and friendly smile. But he said he said I'll tell you what's a whole lot the matter with people today. He said they're not friendly like that like they used to be because people got too much selfish selflove. He said we got to the place where they think they live in their own little world of the self of self-love. Amen. He talked about self-love in in the Leoian church age. Amen. But you know he he told us that Christianity was living for others that I'm not saying you have to take care of your own family and I'm not saying you know I'm not competing for money for other people poor people that that has nothing to do with me. That's between you and God. And you would be unwise if you didn't take care of your own family first. You have to take care of your own family first. A man that don't provide for his family is worse than an infidel. But compassion is eternal life. Eternal life is living for others. And do you even care? And the real way to pray for somebody, the way our prophet could pray for somebody is he would put himself in those people's shoes. The reason the blind man got his sight from Mexico was cuz brother Brandham was comparing him to his daddy. And if one of you brothers come up and I compared you to my daddy, you'd get healed, too. &gt;&gt; Because I love my daddy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, even for for not just as a church and us believers and how we go and fellowship with other churches, I I want to tell you what, you you have all the freedom that the Holy Ghost has given you. You fellowship where God leads you to fellowship and and visit and and you know, I mean, you might call this home, but you're not under chains and balls and slavery. Amen. The Holy Ghost is your guidance. Amen. And and when you go there, just even if there's something you can you can eat the whole loaf of bread and just spit out one pit, but show yourself friendly. Don't try to Don't tell them you're spitting out a pit. Don't even bring it up. &gt;&gt; Don't even bring it up. Just eat the pie. It'll still be good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just eat the pie. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to even bring it down closer into our individual homes. If us parents would understand what our kids are going through or your grandkids are going through, you might change. I'm not saying compromise. I'm not saying I'm not promoting sin or that, but I'm saying or try to remember when you were there and it's a lot worse now. Brother Paul De Fontaine, they just had a youth camp in the states. I think in North Carolina, there was 400 youth there. He was talking about what the youth are in, you know, can be involved in today compared to when he was a youth. Satan is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll be your love to the ones that are struggling and compassion that's going to help bring them along. It's going to bring them into maturity. for your love and guidance. Say, you know, not not compromising with the sin, but saying, you know, you can do better. You can make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can make it by God's grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it it it changes everything. &gt;&gt; You know, around the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost, there's no friction. There's absolutely around your family home with this compassion and love. Everybody wants to come to your place because there's no friction around the church. Everybody will want to visit here because it's just like what? And then when you go out to a a restaurant bar because all the other places are closed, all the world will know that you just walked out of a church service where the atmosphere was a lot different. You know, those people might never be able to, you know, brother Brandham, I I'm I'm trying to close. You know, Brother Brennham had people in his ministry in charge of the tapes that not one of us would vote in favor of. &gt;&gt; They had a sinful life. And Brother Bram's words were, "This is the closest to the Holy Ghost they'll ever get." Maybe some I pray not, but maybe some of those people in that restaurant bar where we went to get because we hadn't ate since breakfast and it was 9:00 at night. That might have been the closest they'll ever get to that atmosphere. Unless God changes their heart. When you look at it like that, would I want those people in hell? No. God God God didn't even make hell for us the people. He never even made hell for the sinners. &gt;&gt; It was made for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; And and and I am going to close on this. Brother Bam said if you go there, you're going to pass every roadblock and every sign says deter and blunt right in to eternal damn or to to damnation. not eternal but damnation because he didn't want nobody to go there. And if you came from him, you'll have the same spirit on you. You'll have the same spirit on you. I I I just I like that thought of that sign. I didn't It It just is fresh today. But we live simply so others can simply live. How even think of eternal life like that way? I live your spiritual life simply so others will catch the vision &gt;&gt; and they'll go with you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would it be all right if we sing our new song again? Wow. I just thought it was just so good. Let's sing that song that we sang. This world is falling apart. You know, these words really spoke to me because this is actually happening right underneath our feet. &gt;&gt; Our houses are being deualed. Our dollar is being deualed. [music] We have no hope here at all. But when you have Christ, you can say goodbye to all your riches because we're not living. We're just was on a holiday. [music] This holiday is going to come to an end really soon. And we're going to go to paradise [music] to heaven to a much the millennium much greater place. Amen. Amen.
