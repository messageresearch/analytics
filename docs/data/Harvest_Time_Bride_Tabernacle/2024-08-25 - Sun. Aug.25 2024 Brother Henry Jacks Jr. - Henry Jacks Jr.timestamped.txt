[37:52] you know a lot of persons misunderstand
[37:54] they believe that having a house having

[38:03] not
[38:04] blessing hallelujah praise God glory to
[38:09] God here and
[38:13] also you're not blessed because you were
[38:15] born into a certain

[39:09] Spirit Cain came from a wom the same
[39:14] home that Abel came from Kan came from

[39:24] Most
[39:25] Blessed produced two different Spirit
[39:28] look at it
[39:31] now and the pops which though are suck
[39:34] meaning the

[40:10] God the topic this morning is blessed
[40:14] are they that hear the word and keep
[40:19] it you notice and and keep it so you can
[40:25] hear but that doesn't mean you're
[40:28] keeping it that's right
[40:31] sir oh praise God brother Paul said If
[40:36] any man be a hearer of the word he must
[40:38] also be a doer that's right Hallelujah
[40:42] sir praise God Amen did not can hear the
[40:46] word yes can hear the word but did he
[40:50] keep it no when you keep something it
[40:54] produce a result there is a result to it
[41:01] Hallelujah they were hearing the law the
[41:05] law was reading every Sabbath day they
[41:08] were hearing it but they weren't keeping
[41:11] it glory to God so here Jesus was
[41:16] explaining to the woman to the certain
[41:19] woman that was in the multitude that was
[41:23] in the crowd because according when she
[41:27] hear all of these things she said no man
[41:32] your mother is
[41:35] blessed your hurly mother is blessed
[41:39] that was she was speaking of
[41:42] Mary
[41:43] hallelujah oh praise God but Jesus was
[41:47] showing her hle is not it's not the womb
[41:51] that you come out of that makes you
[41:53] blessed it's not the breast that you s
[41:57] that makes you blessed
[42:00] Hallelujah you can have a
[42:03] bishop as your
[42:05] father you can have a pastor as your
[42:08] father or a teacher as your father but
[42:12] that doesn't make you
[42:13] bless glory to God I seen in this
[42:17] message many persons Hallelujah they
[42:20] would idolize somebody this big man this
[42:25] great man and they would want to be like
[42:29] this great
[42:30] man they would rather this great man to
[42:32] be their husband or the children rather
[42:36] them to be their father
[42:40] hallelujah oh my God am I preaching this
[42:43] morning Hallelujah they're missing the
[42:47] picture it's not about the man
[42:50] hallelujah it's about hearing the word
[42:54] but not just hear it but also to keep it
[42:58] Hallelujah because you can hear
[43:01] something but that doesn't mean you're
[43:04] keeping what you
[43:05] [Laughter]
[43:07] hear the word here it means to pay
[43:13] attention it means Hallelujah to
[43:18] understand oh my God that word
[43:22] understand is a big word Jesus Jesus
[43:26] said in the book of up Matthew
[43:28] 13:18 Hallelujah and the parable is like
[43:32] unto the man that heareth these Saints
[43:35] and understood
[43:38] it
[43:39] Hallelujah Glory so understanding is
[43:44] important understand is the ability to
[43:48] comprehend
[43:49] Hallelujah glory to God it means the
[43:54] word here it also means to obey
[43:58] hallelujah praise God so when you hear
[44:02] the word you obey it you respond in
[44:06] other words you respond according to
[44:09] what you
[44:10] hear if if I should say just to give a
[44:14] illustration if I should say then okay
[44:17] then hallelujah praise God Elliot come
[44:20] up here and sit on the chair
[44:24] hallelujah what just happened
[44:28] what just happened he responded to what
[44:31] I
[44:32] said Hallelujah glory to
[44:35] God he hear what I said and he responded
[44:39] am H that means he
[44:41] obeyed he was paying
[44:44] attention glory to God so when Jesus was
[44:48] saying to them you got to pay attention
[44:50] to the word and you must respond to the
[44:54] word and respond to the word you will
[44:57] get the
[44:58] result Hallelujah you will get the
[45:01] result glory to God you understand and
[45:06] the word bless it means receiving God's
[45:13] favor wow you heard
[45:16] that the word blessed it means receiving
[45:19] God
[45:21] favor Mary Hallelujah you can't go
