to stand before you in your presence Lord knowing that we come each bearing our licks of fire would come to hear from you Lord I pray that you just take the simple thoughts that I have this morning that you would edify your people with them that they would be blessed from the youngest to the oldest Lord as we turn our eyes to your word may you just illuminate it to our hearts we pray may your spirit Walk Among Us speaking to us in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you all can have your seats this morning I just wanted to express my my gratitude to our pastor brother Dell for the uh confidence that he placed in me to uh to come here and stand in his pull pit while he's uh out on the missionary field you know a lot of a lot of pastors uh they they do and they should guard their pull pits you know and so for for me to be here among you with without him present I I think says a lot about brother Dell and and um I just don't want to do anything that would uh break the confidence that he's shown by having me here um you have to forgive me because I uh two things I have going on here this morning that's a little bit unusual the first is is preaching I Don't Preach a whole lot so um you know uh you could it's real easy to get out of practice if you if you don't get to to use the gift very much and the second thing is I have a sermon that on my notes I have uh my written notes and then I have some slides and so because it was it would kind of mess up the uh program we're we're not going to use my slides but if I you see me going back and forth a little bit that's kind of why um not a problem for me but hopefully it's not a problem for you but hey you know we're just uh we're all in this together you know we're just all Christian soldiers fighting every day getting on our knees and praying and so we're all in this together and there's no big ones there's no great ones and you appreciate the the the gifts of God wherever they are and uh you just uh bear with me this morning as we we take a text out of Psalms 127 if you turn with me in your Bibles and um I I had two different sermons when I when I Was preparing for this uh for our visit here this weekend and I I honestly I didn't know which one I was going to preach and um uh you know some people feel like uh oh thank you for standing for the word some people feel like uh you know if you come to church and you don't have a Pentecostal type of experience have you really been to church and I appreciate that you know I appreciate a Pentecostal experience I appreciate enthusiasm from the from the pull pit to the pews and Lord knows we need the fire but there's also the scripture that says he leadth me to lie down in Green Pastures and so the word can cause us also at times to rest right and um uh so it's important that it settles us as well and so sometimes uh a message may not be a fire and brimstone jumping out of the Pew running around the church but I hope that the word of the Lord this morning ministers to you um I want to speak specifically to the men among us but parents and and in general whether you have uh grandchildren or children and and uh looking to have children um I don't like to go somewhere and and not give tools on how to live a Christian Life I think that's probably one of the most important things that that we seem to miss in in the message is we have all this Revelation people preach Revelation Revelation Revelation and people struggle at home in the family and they they have problems raising children or they have problems in the relationships with their spouses and I've preached here enough that you all have heard me I uh whether I'm talking about forgiveness in the family or I'm talking about how the husband needs respect from the wife or the wife needs love from the husband that this thematically in in my in my Ministry is uh I want to see relationships succeed Among Us so we'll take a text here this morning from Psalms 27 and um we'll start at verse three and the scripture reads this David writes Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of him they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate may the Lord just bless the reading of his words you all can have your seats this morning now I like this I like this scripture there's a there's a lot in it and we could we could certainly spend a lot of time unpacking it but um I want to take my my time this morning and if I don't if I don't finish this there's always a you know a part two to come along uh maybe at a later date but um just to bear with me as I labor to to put a foundation here um the picture that I'd like for you to think of in your mind with these arrows um we're kind of we're kind of distanced from this example that David gives of arrows you know we not many of us carry around bows and arrows anymore if you do you'd probably be looked at pretty strange but in the uh the ancient days uh a warrior would have a a quiver full of arrows and this is the image that imagery that David is relating here is that you would have a quiver full of arrows and the thing about these arrows is this it wasn't like the arrows that we buy today you know you go if you're a hunter and you go to the store and you buy arrows to go and and hunting with uh they're manufactured they're they're carbon they're lightweight they're they're machined you know within certain tolerances they're you know just everyone is just perfect you know and they're perfectly fletched and they're uh certainly wasn't that way 203,000 years ago you know the the warrior would have to go out and he would find the material and he would he would spend time shaping it and squaring it and then you know making it round and he would select just the right feathers and he had just the right arot tip on the end for what the it wasn't just you know like a one arot tip one siiz fit all that you know depending on what was what his aim and his purpose was there were many different types of arrowheads and so um what I'm getting at with that is uh a a a father a man with this quiver fool is happy and each one of those arrows are unique each child is unique and we have to as as husbands and as fathers realize that um our children are not produced in cookie cutter fashion uh they're not machined and and manufactured and and just uh uh everyone has the same tolerances and the same nature and the same uh skills and the same uh dreams that our children are all unique and wondrously made in in the womb and God forms them and gives them individual personalities and as husbands as fathers we have to be able to look at our children uh look at our families and and prophetically see where that person is going to wind up and by by that I mean we need to look at our our children and see their uh their qualities and their their character and be able to mold them and shape them just like uh a warrior in ancient days would spend hours and hours you know shaping the arrow and SEL cting just the right Arrowhead and balancing everything and putting just the right feathers our children deserve no less that's the the imagery here that that David is giving amen so let me get to my notes here so I don't just uh skip everywhere all right okay so as I said I I primarily want to speak to uh fathers today but uh definitely to to the the husband and wife I believe the husband and wife should work as a team um that I don't like the idea uh brother brandom says it here and there throughout the the message you know not to treat your your wife as a doormat because she's your queen and um I believe in in a right relationship a husband and a wife will come together and they form a unit now the the husband and we'll talk about it is is as absolutely the head of the household but they work in conjunction together and so if husband and wife are are budding heads and they're they're not on the same page it creates chaos and confusion into the family but it's the father's responsibility the father's responsibility to fix that it's not the wife's responsibility and so I I know some of you you're older and and you're like we know this stuff and well that's all right you just support me with your amens all right so a true uh I believe that a father is uh called to be the king of his household I believe that a father has three distinct roles within God's economy in the house the first is is the king of the home he's called to be the high priest of the home and he's called to be the have a prophetic service to the home to be Prophet priest and king that's the ministry of Jesus Christ it's the ministry that we see duplicated in the father and I just talk about that for just a moment because a king is not set upon the throne uh uh here on this Earth to be worshiped and adored a king a true king is a servant to his people he serves his people he protects the borders what what is allowed into the home what is allowed what kind of friends your children will have what kind of things that you'll allow your children to engage in it's the father's responsibility and and his duty as the king of the home to uh to make those decisions you know it's not the the preacher's responsibility it's not the pastor it's not certainly not moms uh you know unfortunately what we see is a lot of times is when fathers abdicate the the the role of King many things wind up on Mama's lap and so I know none of us have this problem here today um but uh we'll just uh get through it anyhow a father has to be the uh uh has to lead from the front he has uh whoa sorry surprised me there uh a father h a true king leads from the front that means he's the one that that is the first into battle swinging a sword he's the first one to to go and meet the Enemy at the Gate we talk about the various problems that we have um uh you know with this things in the world and I I liking a lot of times to you know we we believe that there's a hedge of angels around our home providing protection amen and you know there uh as as I would put it is that that beyond the Hedge is the world and all the things of the world and all the enemies all the demons all the things that are set against the believer and they're just there popping their head up of be just beyond the Hedge and as as the as the the husband as the father it's it's our duty as a as the king of our homes to engage that enemy to protect our kingdom as it were right so we have a responsibility we have to be the first in the battle the first to you know when when when children bring something home or they have a question about something it's our responsibility to to look at high priest of the home he has to pursue a vertical relationship with God in order that the horizontal relationships with with mother and with our children with people work out just right because if our our vertical relationships are messed up then our horizontal relationships are messed up amen so he must be able to Shepherd his family he can't just rely on the pastor or a church relationship he has to be comfortable interceding for his family just as our high priest intercedes for us he has to intercede for his children um a little bit later I I want to if I if I don't get to anything else I want to get to some some prayers uh thematic things that we can pray for for our children doesn't matter if they're out of the house and and gone it doesn't matter if you have grandchildren but just some different things that uh I'd like to put put into your your tool pouch a a father must be able to prophetically Shepherd his his she Shepherd his family and by that I means he he needs to be able to pray and seek the leadership of the Lord if we believe that the footsteps of the righteous orain AED by the Lord then a a man a husband has to be able to seek the will of God for his family not just for his life but for the life of his family and Shepherd his family in that will in that the the scripture says that my people perish for a lack of vision and so a husband and a father needs to have a vision for his family he needs to have a vision for his children and where they're going if I if I go back to our uh the illustration that that David gave us of the bow and arrow you know it's not just the arrow that that's unique and different every bow is is a little bit different meaning we you know we each have a little bit different style of of parenting we each are unique you know but the parent is the bow that that pulls back the arrow and depending on where that Arrow has to go the the parent must know how much tension to put on the string dad must know how how far to draw the arrow back he must be able to point it and put it in the right direction and release it amen so that that prophetic Vision to know what the what the will of God is for your family is so important every every child is unique and every every every move that we make as parents must be carefully weighed when it comes to how we point our children in what direction and what we're going to allow them to do and what're we're going to allow them to interact with whether it's at at school if they're if they're not homeschooled or or if it's uh you know having friends and and what kind of friends will allow them to have what kind of activities will allow them to engage in and I certainly don't believe that that we uh uh are are to cloer ourselves off we're called to be Salt and Light to the world but especially when our children are young we must protect them you know they don't have the Holy Ghost yet and so we have to be their Holy Ghost for them that means making the decisions for them that they cannot make uh I know when I was when I was young I I like to use a lot of personal examples sometimes it gets me in trouble I've been told I'm I'm way too transparent in the pull pit and sometimes it makes people uncomfortable but um I I like to use personal examples because they're my examples I'm familiar with them you know it doesn't make sense for me to use other people's examples if you want brother brandom examples you you can read brother brandom's messages and and listen to the word and that's wonderful but um I remember remember when I I it makes people uncomfortable because for some reason we get this idea that the person standing behind the pull pit has somehow they've got it all figured out and they they they've arrived or there's some great somebody or listen we I put my my pants on one leg at a time just like everybody else I make plenty of mistakes and um I'm great you know it it sounds funny but I'm grateful for those mistakes because they've taught me so much um it'd be horrible to go through life and and not learn from your mistakes but um I remember when I was I was young I uh I think I was probably about 13 or so and there was a um uh kind of like a uh a military program for kids and um they uh you got a uniform and they taught us how to March and and how to you know do all these uh Maneuvers while you're Marching In step and in sink and and we sing CAD what we call cadences while we did it and um I when I when I found out I like the military stuff you know growing up I was just always always a military uh minded kid I probably read way too much World War II history and things like that and it just uh it always put it just like you know how brother brandom says you know the talks about the the young boy that turned into a sailor and he grew up in the middle of Kansas or something you know he's like well there was a there was an image of a boat or a little ship on the on his bedroom wall and he's seen that every day and so they put it before him he ended up going into the the Navy or whatever um I think I looked at that stuff way too much myself when I was a kid so then I that's the way I was bent and I was about 13 or so and I I encountered this program that was put on it was by our our air force and I begged my parents I begged them begged and pleaded let me do this you know um and it it it ended up they ended up allowing me but I ended up having to go and talk to the pastor and and he said you know well it's just going to take you away from church and um it it did and my my parents they they ended up make letting me make a decision you know they're like well you're 13 uh we got to start letting you make some of your own decisions so you can choose to do this if you want and uh sometimes 13 year olds aren't qualified to make good decisions like that and um you know at the at the end of the day what it did was it took me all the it took me out of church on on the week on a week night and then it bent me further into the military where I ended up going into the military and 26 years later still in the military and um you know so what I'm what I'm saying is that sometimes we we can't let our children make those decisions on their on their own we have to be able to make the decisions for them as as fathers and as parents we have to know that uh saying no is okay um as Christians the the ultimate the ultimate Target that we're we're pointing our children to must be the Lord it can't be anything else it can't even be University it can't be a specific goal or career field or something like that our ultimate goal is that our children serve God no matter where they are amen no matter where they go in life they must be able to to serve the Lord and uh the the big question for that is for us to do that as parents we have to ask ourselves how close are we to the Lord ourselves how close are we to the Target um righteousness is a a daily Target that we strive for and we want to launch our children to but our children see us they see the backside of us right they know all our faults they know all our weaknesses they know all our failures from the time they're very young they learn how to manipulate us Daddy please Mommy please Mommy says no they go and ask Daddy Daddy says yes or they go and ask Daddy Daddy says no and then they go ask Mommy and and so they they they know how to to manipulate us they know how to pit us against one another they know Daddy's weak in this area he'll let us do this mom's weak in this area she's a softy we can get away with this and and children just pit us back and forth together and then the next thing you know you and your wife are are in the bedroom and you're trying not to argue in front of the kids and and they like well I don't think we should do that but I already told him and and and you go back and forth and and and your little little ones there at the door just listening I'll get what I want you know um they see us they see all the negative they see all the the things that we do that we uh that we wish that we didn't do you know um they they there was a there's a quote I read once that says uh I can't hear what you're saying saying because I see what you're doing I can't hear what you're saying be because I can see what you're doing and we we want to live Godly lives we want to live Christian lives that are obedient to God that are that we walk in the paths of righteousness that we that we uh honor God in all that we say and do and and we're human we make mistakes I'm not saying that we don't you know we're going to get in arguments we're going to get in in disagreements and and we're going to disagree loudly sometimes and and uh you know that's that's unfortunately it's normal I wish it wasn't normal maybe it's not normal for you and and nobody else does that nobody ever else gets into a loud disagreement just it's just me and my family uh help us Lord but you can see I'm saying is like what we're aiming our children for and we and we when we tell them we want you to serve the Lord we want you to to walk in these Paths of righteousness that and and if they don't see our lives match up with what we're trying to aim them for then that creates a disconnect from a young age from a very young age it creates a disconnect and so as as husbands as fathers in particular um we have to know how to do that we have to learn how to do that unfortunately raising children doesn't come with an owner's manual I I have I've had four of them and not one came with an owner's manual or operator's manual each one of them is different not one of them is the same they're all unique uh they all uh the only thing equal about them is I love them all equal you know I don't they you know each one of them is precious to me but uh each one of them is just so unique and so different and uh by the time you got the first one figured out then the second one comes along and you're like okay I've got this and then you're like wait a minute the second one is completely different than the first one and you get that one figure out you're like okay I'm I'm ready for the next one and the next one comes and you find out the next one's different from both the F the first two and then the fourth one comes and you're just like whatever I don't care we'll just wing it you know and then that creates all kinds of resentment later because the children are like wait you let them get away with this you never would have let me done that and as a parent you're just like I don't have the energy to deal with it I was a lot younger when I had my first one but I I appreciate I appreciate this this idea that that David gives us in the Bible because it not only does it it it tell us that children are reward and and they are but it also tells us that we we will be happy with our children if you're not happy with your children something's wrong it's probably not the children it's probably you because the Bible says says you'll be happy if you you have a you have children and then it gives this next thing here it says they shall not be ashamed how many don't you want children that aren't ashamed of you don't you want to walk a life that your children will not be ashamed and it says here that they will speak with the enemies in the gate and what that refers to is that in ancient times when when legal matters were being settled well things were being disputed they would BR they would bring the the the argument to the judges who would sit in the gates of the city and then that this means that your children will argue on your behalf they'll they'll fight on your behalf they'll they'll speak with those people that would try to destroy you or destroy your influence and they'll say no I've seen his private life I grew up in his household economy I grew up under his kingdom and this is how he's taught us and how he's trained us and and that's what we want we want to CH our children to respect us and be proud of us and know that they lived in an economy of God that that uh is done properly amen it's it's so important uh for for us as husbands to to be in the word of God and to teach our children uh the a a scribe came one day to Jesus and they they asked him and uh they said what is what is the greatest commandment and if if I would ask you today you know what's what's the greatest commandment I would you ask just a little one of the children you know they say well uh Thou shalt not steal you know that's I stole candy once and I got a pretty good spanking that's the biggest Commandments don't steal you know or or don't covet or or you know uh what whatever they think it would be but uh when they ask Jesus this question he refers to back to the book of Deuteronomy he says the first of all the Commandments is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord it it I'm looking at my son because we've been learning this Cohen do you think you can recite it can you recite that in Hebrew you can't do it in front of the church so we've been learning this we've been learning this command at home it's it's um brother John why would you do that why would you why would you teach your children that I think that if somebody came to our Lord and savior and said what's the greatest commandment and Jesus didn't say well it's uh Thou shalt not kill or Thou shalt not steal he refers back to this commandment in Deuteronomy this is the greatest one the fir the first part of it is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord is one so immediately we have we have godhead secondly he says he says this that goes on to say and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy strength and with all thy might now if you read the words in King James uh it says all thy mind but the in Deuteronomy it says all they might and the reason why that they put mind in uh the New Testament is because there wasn't a Greek word really that translates well to might and so they put mind but unfortunately I think that was almost I think it was almost prophetic because like people want to have a mental relationship a mental understanding a mental love of God when God does things for us you know we love him but what this what this actually is to love him with all our might is to love him passionately to pursue the things of God to pursue God passionately that we're always seeking after him and remember I'm talking to fathers and I'm and I'm laying a little bit more of a foundation here that that goes on to say and these words which I command thee today shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou wst by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontless between thy eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy Gates and so this is what Jesus referred back to now he only quoted the first little bit when he when he answered the Scribe and he he went on saying Thou shalt love your neighbor as yourself and in doing so you fulfilled the whole law all this is what hangs the law and the prophets all of this and and we must understand that this is the God's model for parents as Leaders as Fathers as husbands that this is God's model that we have his word constantly in front of our families that we talk about it when we go to bed we talk about it at the dinner table we talk about the things of God always that that we're always presenting Christ to our our family we we remind them and we if we had time we could we could go into uh all the different times throughout the the Old Testament where it said that that talked about this to your children for this will save your children and your children's children and it's a generational thing and we just don't have time to go into it all but as husbands as fathers it's our role and our responsibility to to put this before our kids starting at a very young age just as young as they can understand where we teach teach them first by by Bible stories and then we teach them later by by Bible studies and and if we have to engage our children otherwise the world will engage our children for us amen if we don't teach our children then the world will teach our children and so uh this is a commandment for for All fathers All Fathers and and when when do you stop being a father never never and so it doesn't matter how old your children are it doesn't matter if they're your your your grandchildren or or anything like we have a role and a responsibility to always influence our children our children's children according to the word of God I like this because it it tells us that we first of all that it has to come from our heart that the that the love of God has to be in our heart that we're to pursue him passionately now you because you can't pursue god with a with just a head knowledge and a head relationship and expect it to translate to children because children will see through it if it's just head knowledge they'll see when you waffle on things and they'll see you stumble and fall but when you when you consistently go to the word of God for everything they see that they see this consistency they they learn they they will then learn just like how they learn to manipulate us they will learn I can't manipulate them on this this is the word and you and you see people unfortunately when they just have a head know if you have a head knowledge of something you can be talked out of it if you can be convinced of something you can be unconvinced and so this has to be a a a walk within us that we pursue God from our hearts uh it said that I I like the scripture that talks about David it says David was a man after God's Own Heart and and what we like to to think of that and how it means is David pursued the heart of God that David was always after even with his faults even with his failures and his shortcomings David diligently pursued God in all he did and you know I didn't talk about it but you know just when I was mentioning that leading from the front you know King David led the armies from the front until the one time he didn't and that was when he fell with bash Sheba the one time he stayed home from the fight is when he fell and what a lesson for us as fathers the one time that you don't go out and engage the enemy is the one time you'll fail and and it'll affect your family it'll affect your kingdom your children your children's children so help us Lord help us as fathers to to engage with the Enemy to to always be there fighting for our family fighting for the things that we love the ones that we love I I love good teaching I wish I was a better teacher you know so many times when I when I talk about these things I feel like uh I I I'm not explaining it well enough or I can I know I'll come come away it's I could have explained it better I could have explained it deeper but you know we only have so much time to to talk and and and uh I just want to try to put a little a little something in your hearts no matter whether you have children will have children or your children are out of that household that that speak speaks to you and if it and and if it's not something that's going to help you on your way maybe you can give it to somebody else that'll help them on their way amen um I I I just had I had a couple things in here I'm trying to to skip for for time because I I I brought my my phone phone out to set my timer and then I totally didn't and so I'm I'm trying to trying to think how much time I've actually been up here so we'll just go through a little bit more and and honey if I start going long you wave your arms at me it says you shall teach them diligently unto your children and that's I think that's the core of what I want to get at this morning is that we are to teach them diligently that doesn't that that means uh having a a consistent walk a a consistent thing that we know we're going to have family altar we know we're going to talk about God we know we're going to hear these things at the table we we're going to teach them diligently when we set at the table and we talk in the car with our kids our kids should expect to hear something about God they should they should expect to hear if if they don't hear something about God or a lesson that that pertains to Christian Living and how how uh how they should grow and develop and and I I love to do this with my my son um I wish I was better at it when I was when I was a young younger man a younger father I didn't do it so much with my my girls um I I I kind of just I I blame it really blame's not the right word but I I wasn't raised to do it and you learn as you grow amen you know so like I said we make mistakes with those first kids and then we make new mistakes with each one but we learn a little bit along the way and we try to try to to change as as we as we learn and grow and one of the things I like to do with my my son is is if we're traveling or we're talking you know just him and me in the car you know and I just you know Coen you know let's talk about uh I think the last one we talked about was uh doing doing the the right thing even when nobody's looking and having integrity and what that means you know and the lessons that that I like to talk to him about even if he doesn't really realize that he's getting a lesson you know whe I like to talk to him about honesty Integrity uh valuing the right things being principled being uh someone who can be counted on reliable and you know I might talk to him about a little something I might only just drop just a little bit of thing you know a little bit here a little bit there but I like to I like to encourage him and I like to uh you know uh teaching about the qualities that a man should have and that a godly man should have and you know I wish I had done better with my my first three were all girls and I um you know it's kind of funny for for a guy to teach girls about being girls but uh I wish I'd have done better with it but um you know that's where I'm grateful for a for a Godly wife who comes along and and brother brandom says you know there's there's there's uh there's so many gospels Matthew Mark Luke John and then there's mother you know and and we certainly that when we when we work together with our our spouses and our wives and we have that interconnected that we are unified front she catches up on on the things that we don't and and thank God for wives that that are um spiritual that have have discernment um I can't count how many times my wife has come to me and said John you know you did this but you didn't catch how they reacted because she knows them better in some areas than I do she knows them better in a lot of areas than I do and she said and she'll tell me she said you know you didn't see their reaction to this and you don't know that they did this and they did this I think you need to uh talk to them next time like this and and I try to I don't always do it but I try to then go and do what my wife says because she knows best and so you know that's that's that's a good Mama but you know then I talk about these things but it's it's it's it's not the Mama's responsibility to Pastor the kids it's not Mom's responsibility to to teach the kids to uh teach them about the things of God she does it's kind of like the natural order of things when they're young but the father should be over that all right because the way that a that that God set up the household economy was that we have uh Christ as the head of the church then we have the husband as the head of the home and the the wife is there under the husband and then there's the children and so there's there's a the a distinct picture of how things work and so the husband is ultimately responsible for all of it the husband is responsible for everything that happens within his kingdom as the king and so you know you can't you can't just uh say things happen and then you say well Lord look at the woman you gave me you know and try to blame things on the on the wife you're responsible amen so I the good thing the good news is is when is when uh my wife does all these amazing things that that I get to take credit for it because I'm responsible uh for all of it I'm responsible for the good and the bad right you know so when good things happen I'm responsible too so I get I get some of the credit amen Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in the way she go and when he is old he will not depart from it we love that verse uh as it's a promise to us that when we do the right things when we even let me say this you know children you can do everything right with a child just as as well as you could do everything wrong and they'll still go their own path they'll still go their own path and but the principle is is that when we teach them the things of God that's always that that's never going to they're never going to escape that they're never going to escape the things that we've taught them and it's the same way with people that that leave the message of the hour that we've seen in the last decade people who have left the message of the hour they cannot Escape it they they can't escape what they've learned they can't escape they it it's always in their mind they're always rehearsing it they're always arguing about it they cannot Escape what they've been taught whether or not they want to acknowledge it anymore as a TR as a truth they're still with it every day and uh you know and then my hope obviously is that that those those that have departed will come back and and that's the hope that we have for our children when they choose a path that we didn't aim them for when we pulled back the bow string and we've Let It Go and then they they make choices that that take them further away from God that's when we have to rest in in the promises of the Lord that says they and their offspring with them their children and their children's children and and so I believe those things we I think we must believe and we must accept it as a promise from God Psalm 78 1-7 says my people hear my teaching listen to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth mouth with a parable I will utter hidden things things from of old things we have heard and known things that our ancestors have told us so see there you see that that repeating and rehearsing of the things of God we will not hide them from our descendants we will tell the Next Generation the praiseworthy Deeds of the Lord his power and the Wonders he has done he decreed statutes from Jacob and established the law in Israel which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children so the next generation would know them even the children yet to be born and they in turn will tell their children then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands so you see that this is about establishing a generational Kingdom it's not just what what's in front of us but but as men we have to have that prophetic as husbands and fathers we have to have that prophetic vision for our children that aligns with the word of God that I'm not doing this just for my children to day but for my children's Children's children's as long as the Lord would tar that the the seeds that I plant today that they'll enjoy decades from now just like a farmer plants a a an oak tree an acorn he never gets to to sit under the shade of that tree but his children's children's children will sit under the shade of that tree you know and and that's that's the attitude the prophetic Vision that we have to have as husbands and fathers we it's so easy it's so easy to get wrapped up around the now and I think one of the hardest things to do as as as fathers and probably even as mothers is to um to to look Beyond what's happening right now and have a long-term Vision a long-term goal for our family because you know everything's so pressing and so urgent we have Financial concerns and we have you know this problem to deal with this child is acting this way or or whatever it is you know things at the work but it it's so easy to get wrapped as we say wrapped around the axle uh about things that are just temporary where we need to establish a long-term vision for our families a long-term a long-term vision for our children's children say well brother brother John the Lord's coming soon amen I believe that he could come he could come before uh the the day is over uh but brother random also taught us that that we plan our potatoes and everything just like he's not coming for another hundred years and how many of us ever thought if you've been around the message for for a while that we would be here in at the end of 2023 going into 2024 uh how many years now it's a prophet been gone how many years have we been uh saying the Lord's coming soon and he is and he is coming soon but it could be a hundred years from now you won't hear many probably many preachers tell you that but you know if even if it does I'm okay with it I'm okay with it it's it's his timing not my timing and so I want to have a vision for my children the the Bible teaches us that a that a wise man lays up a uh a an inheritance for his children's children yeah and and unfortunately not many of us are able to to really do that unless you're you're very well off financially and you're business-minded and and maybe your parents helped you out not many of us are able to lay out a an inheritance but what we can do is we can lay out a spiritual inheritance amen because our children will reap the benefits of the things we do amen they will reap the benefits even if they don't know it's because of the things we did God will still honor what we do and bless our children and our children's children I know that's true brother brandom talked to a businessman one time and he said you know the reason why you're successful is not because that you're an outstanding business person that's not it at all he said I look back and I see see that your grandparents were Barefoot missionaries in China and gave their lives on the mission field and because of what they did you're blessed in your business amen so the things that we do matter tremendously God honors what we do he honors us he honors his people he honors his bride amen it's a principle of his and so let me just try to get into some some practical application here and say brother John how do I train my example the how do I train my children the first first thing I would say would be to be an example to have Christ centered child training we must first have our hearts devoted consciously consciously to pleasing the Lord Jesus and all we say all we think all we do we need for ourselves to be completely focused on the things of God Amen we need to be completely focused on how uh God would want us to resp respond how God would want us to act and and I would say don't don't ever be too hasty it's so easy to be Hasty in judgment it's so easy to be Hasty with our children and and come up with a response like that when many times we should be whole me think about this in in punishment amen e even in a court of law even in a court of law the defendant gets a chance to to defend themselves and they have an advocate arguing for them and so never be too even too hasty to punish children but you know let them give an account for their actions and then don't spare the rot because they're probably guilty Jesus said I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you Paul says in 1 Corinthians follow my example as I follow follow the example of Christ 2 Timothy 2:15 be diligent to present yourself approved to God a worker who does not need to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and so we live an example we live our W our life in such a way to please Our Savior first but if we want children to glorify God we have to glorify God in our own lives amen so they have to be able to see that they have to be able to see that example and and then we have to be willing to when we make mistakes which we will to go and apologize to our children and tell them I did this wrong I'm sorry or even when we punish our children and we thought we knew the the whole truth of something and things come out later that somebody had hid something and somebody had lied and we punished unjustly then we have to go back and we have to apologize and say I'm sorry and what that does is it it it tells it tells your children that you are willing to be wrong you are willing to be wrong and to make things right Jesus makes things right and a Godly Man a Godly woman will make things right amen we're taught that principle all throughout scripture whether it's uh having conflict with a brother in the church or something that we we always strive to reconcile and make things right uh there's there's nothing wrong with being wrong if you're if you're willing to uh make it right amen so we have to set an example for how in how we treat our wives Ephesians 525 God instructs men to love our wife instructs men to love our wives as Christ loved the church and so gave himself for it and that's a that's a pretty high standard to live up to and I preached it many times that uh husbands don't love naturally we we we we don't you know women women love naturally they're Born to Love and they they express love you know and and and men are like well I told you that I loved you 10 years ago it's still true I you know if it ever changes I'll let you know and so God specifically puts this command in there for us as husbands to love your wives to express love to your wife and so you know little children should see you giving Mama a hug little children should see you uh dancing around the the the the dining room with Mom you know just just holding one another hugging one another giving each other kisses and hugs and and laughing together and they should they they should know how much you love your wife how much you put her up on a pedestal I brother brother Carson I hope you don't mind this but the other day I I when we were we were sitting at dinner um I see where is brother Carson there he is he being blocked the other day you you had your phone we were sitting at dinner and I I seen what you had uh your wife labeled at that in your phone I thought that was beautiful so uh because in in my phone I have my wife labeled as NES shali which in Hebrew means my soul she's she's my queen and so I like that when I seen somebody else does that when somebody else has a you know this this is my my loved one this is this is who my soul desires and I've got her much Jus is everything to me kids should see that they should see that love that you have for your wife and know that nothing can ever come between that amen so they need to see that and then you know conversely children need to be be able to see the wife respecting the husband and honoring the husband and and and showing him the the ad admiration that he's due that he craves that he needs men work off of of affirmation and respect and so as wives you have to be able to Express that stuff when the children can hear it you know thank you honey for for getting uh for for providing thank you for always going to work thank you for being the provider that you are thank you for leading our home in Godly ways thank you for conducting that Bible study that was a real blessing you know I really enjoyed it and saying those little things it's not a stroking an ego it's respect because men need respect and children need to see that because that's modeling then the behavior and what they're to expect amen we have to model things you know you have to you have to date your wife well this is not not on my notes at all but you have to date your wife you have to continually pursue her and never stop just just as we passionately pursue uh Christ in our lives we can't ever stop pursuing our wife um it's not one of those things like oh we've got her we've captured her and we've drugged her back back to the cave you know like a caveman and now she can't escape and uh she has to feel wanted and needed and passionate and pursued and and and that you're always you always want to know more about her it's it's funny how how we're so completely different God made men and women so completely different you know if you a wife gives a husband a book on relationships you know the husband is like automatically what am I doing wrong why are you giving me this book what what's the lesson you're wanting me to learn here you know but you know the the husband brings a relationship book to the to the wife and is like hey honey here you go she's like wow this is amazing do you want to go through it together you know we can highlight things and and so you know that speaks that connection to her uh is you know it's just the same thing you know you buy your your husband uh uh some some dumbbells to lift you know for weights and he's like oh yeah this is great I can exercise he's not ever going to be like even if he's fat and out of shape he's never going to be like she got this for me because I'm fat and out of shape but if you get your wife exercise stuff she's going to think it's because she needs to use it we're just so different and God made us that way it's okay so don't ever do what I've done and buy your wife exercise stuff for her birthday because it does not go over well I promise amen so we got we have to aim for the right goal the goal of parenting is to bring our children up and nurture them uh in the ad in the fear and admonition of the Lord the goal of parenting is not to get children under control it's not to make them polite and respectful it's the goal of our our parenting is not to have little robots it's not to make them obedient that if we say jump they say jump and and ask when they can come down our our goal in parenting is to aim G our children towards Christ and all that they say all that we say and do that we point them always towards the cross towards a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and we see that reflected in in God's goal for us and he shows us the kind of goals that we should have for our children Deuteronomy 10: 12- 13 it says and now Israel what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear that's reverence all respect the Lord your God to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the Lord your God with all your heart with all your Soul wow that sounds familiar and to observe the Lord's commands and decrees that I'm giving you today for your own good wow that's the that's that's that's the the same goals that God lays out for us as the goals that I want for my children that that the things that I teach them the things that they learn from me it's for their own good to walk in the right ways to walk in the right paths to establish the way of the Lord amen Micah 68 he has showed you oh man what is good and what does the Lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God and so I think that one of Christian parents greatest failures is having uh too low of expectations for their children we want our children to uh not do drugs we want them to uh you know not do poorly in school we want them to to do this or that but our our goals for our children should be first that we teach them to love the Lord we we we often times we set too low of goals it's a pretty good goal John I want my children to be successful and financially able and to you know to be a doctor or be a lawyer or be this or that but it's meaningless if they don't have Christ in their lives we put Christ we get Christ in their lives and get a solid relationship with with Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit will lead and guide them amen yes amen so like I said my goal this morning is to give you something to help you uh practically in in joshua8 it says do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful and too often we measure the the measure success by being prosperous or we measure success by the world standards but being successful in life is being part of God 's economy and being one of God's children knowing God's word living in obedience is what God repeatedly calls success me skip through just a little bit here some things that I've already kind of touched on I feel like I'm running out of time um amen so I I I touched on it briefly that that the the father's the head um and let me say this mom's first Ministry the we we all have a Ministry so to speak but Mom's mother's first Ministry is not to the children her first duty is to the husband her first duty is to minister to the husband then the children because she is part of him when God when God put us together he put us back together amen because we were one before the foundation of the world in Jesus Christ when we came we believe that that we separated just as Adam and Eve separated when Adam when God created Adam he the Lord says he he called their name Adam and Eve was still inside him and we believe that that then when Eve was taken out and separate person a separate personality that the ish and the ish and The Feminine was came out of Adam that coming back together the two shall become one for this for this cause shall husband uh man leave his father and wife and the two shall become one flesh not only not only is that just the the physical coming together but is the spiritual coming together as well and so the the wife must first first duty is to the husband and I say that because the overarching duty of the father is for the entire family right and so the the wife ministers to the husband she takes care of his niece she takes care of him um it's it's not it's not uh just the kids the kids the kids and the husbands neglected because the husband needs the wife we need one another I I cannot live without my wife I cannot live without her her affection and her admiration for me if we we've gone through great periods of Separation um with me being in the military and uh for weeks and months and you know at a time and it's it's affects me when I don't when my wife doesn't minister to me when she when she doesn't connect with me and we are unconnected and disconnected it it affects me and so Mama we we we love we love good Mothers and how that they they uh minister to the children but the first duty is to to the husband and that sets a order in the home U because in today's society children control the home and and children children run things by their emotions by their wants I want this I need this give me this give me that and so the children uh end up running parents ragged to practices and this event and that event and so you know we have to have have control and order in in the home a home is built through wisdom and and part of of wisely building a house is acknowledging that God has set things in order amen and so I referred to it e earlier that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is god um and so we we we want our our sisters to live under the authority of the husband father's the head mom ministers to Dad she's under dad and over the kids but the authority uh is over the the the children not the other way around um excuse me as I'm just skipping through this 1 Corinthians 14:40 let everything be done decently and in an orderly way uh verse 33 the same same chapter uh for God is not the author of confus confusion but peace as in all the churches of the Saints and so proper family order is how we build the house we set things in order and we stick with it we don't let children manipulate us we don't let children uh well unfortunately many times we do let children manipulate us but we shouldn't um excuse me my like I said I use examples from my own life and um sometimes it gets me in trouble people don't don't like it when you use examples but my my oldest daughter she's married now we're very proud that she got married some of you came to the wedding we're so grateful that you came we're so proud of her uh she they got a little apartment and they're they're just Trucking along in life and you know we we went and visit them here a couple weeks ago and and just walking into their their little apartment you know and just you know hand me down furniture and everything else just like you know it's just like when we first started and so it's it was a little nostalgic in a way uh to to go and visit with them because of you know like when Laura and I first got married I think we had a cardboard table to eat at I think we had a we had a chair that the neighbor was he he was either throwing it in the trash or donating it to the Goodwill and I went over over there and got it at off the end of his driveway and somebody gave us a this couch from like the 1960s and you know we just didn't have nothing but we were happy you know and uh you know to so we walked in and we' seen all that and you know boxes and uh where where where do you guys eat at they don't even have a kitchen table well we just sit on the couch and eat okay that might get old but we uh so we're I'm proud I sure am proud of them and her her husband's a a fine young man and uh um pursuing the right things and and trying to get a career started as an electrician but uh I don't know why I kind of got down that Rabbit Trail but uh I guess because I'm getting ready to say something kind of bad about her so I wanted to say some good things so my my oldest daughter was very good at at I I don't want to call it manipulation but it is manipulation she would always be able to go to my wife and my wife would be like she would get in trouble and my wife would be like this is the law and You' have broken my Commandments and you will be chastised and then an hour or two later you know she would come in and she my daughter she would just be all sweet and loving and kind and and mommy don't you think this and don't you think that and and the next thing you know uh she wasn't grounded anymore you know it was just how she was she was just she knew her mama so well she knew exactly how to to approach her and to sweet talk her and smoo and she was just like a little politician and and uh always got her way uh well most of the time she got her way she got her way way too much but um you know what I'm what I'm getting at is is that we have we have to follow the order order and it has to be consistent and we can't let our children uh it's okay to let our children talk their way out of things sometimes you know and be like okay let you make a pretty good argument about why why I shouldn't have grounded you from that I'll go ahead and let you go this time but consistency is the PE is the key in in keeping order in the home amen so we have to uh focus on the right things and I don't I don't like we say uh you know get their heart right get their heart right um listen to your heart things like that are are just wrong um we we don't we're not we're not let me say it this way I'm not I would never give my children advice just listen to your heart and do what do what you think feels right because the heart is deceitfully wicked amen and and so it's not a question of listening to your heart it's a question of what does the word say what does the word say the word guides our decision-making process always the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can understand it watch over your heart with all diligence for from it flow the Springs of Life from within out of the heart of men proceed the evil thoughts fornications thefts murders adulteries Deeds of coveting and wickedness as well as deceits sensuality Envy slander pride and foolish foolishness all out of the heart so we we don't I don't encourage my children to listen to their heart especially if they're they're unre unconverted amen our children have to know that they have Wicked and sinful hearts that are alienated from God from the very beginning um I I remember telling telling my two oldest one time that they were they were such beautiful little Sinners and they just laughed and laughed and laughed they thought that was funny but but I always Tred to put it before them that that they had to come to a a personal knowledge of Jesus Christ from a young age I've tried to encourage that in all my children that you can't just rely on Mom and Dad you have to come to a personal knowledge the the word of God is is for us as individuals and it says believe and you shall be saved repent and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and and so I can't repent for you but I can I can show you the path through through my sacrifice through how I live my life that this is the way that the way the truth and the life amen because we are the light of the world Amen so skipping down and then let me I had a couple things I wanted to share with you first of all don't think like Jared brother Jared those of you have small kids don't don't think that I came and I'm like I seen something brother John's seen something so now he's talking about family and raising kids and nothing like that at all I promise I I'm a person who who preaches where I live so the things that I'm I'm studying the things that I'm studying for my own self I end up that's what comes out over across the pull pit so um brother Dell didn't tell me hey you need to you need to talk about this or anything like that um I I I I think what I want to do is I I want to skip a bunch of this and just leave it and I want to um I thought I had it here I wanted to share with you I I pray for my children every day um and I pray for them specifically I pray for them in a specific way every day and and what I what I mean by that is I I pray prayers for my children that are scripture-based and I I speak God's word back to him over my children in prayer and I've done it for years and years and years and what I have is I have a a little card here with various prayers you know I think that I pray over my children and I put it on my my bathroom mirror and anytime I'm in the bathroom for years and years and years now I I have this there and as I'm brushing my teeth as I'm getting ready for the day or as I'm getting ready for bed I go through these prayers and I rehearse them to the Lord and I pray them over my children because the most powerful thing that we can do for our children is to pray for them and so I I want to share these with you and um I would encourage you to uh to copy them and and pray them yourselves and I guess since I don't have the the slide the slides up you won't be able to see them but you can always uh catch the gist and and uh go back and listen to the the tape I guess um the first one is I that I pray is I ask the Lord I say early in their lives fill my children with love for you that they would love you with all their heart with all their soul and with all their might I ask God to help me to train my children to love deeply sincerely and sacrificially seeing and loving others as he does and I ask him to empower me to to give me the strength to model his love and compassion towards them because as as fathers I think this is something that I learned very early on but regrettably it's something that I was I wish I would have have been better at I wish I was better at is that children get their concept of who God is from the father from their view of the Father the father is always angry angry and wrathful and always meeting out punishment then their children grow up with a concept that God is this angry God and so I I ask God to help me to model love and compassion for my children so that they know when they that if I if I'm going to be their example of what God is then I want it to be the right example I I asked God I said Give me give my children love for your word allow them to know it understand it and to follow it wholeheartedly Psalms 1 1-3 I pray fill them with the knowledge of your will and all spiritual wisdom and understanding so as to walk in a manner worthy of you fully pleasing to you bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God another thing I pray is I ask God to compel them to pray Contin continually so that they will live and walk by his spirit that they would listen to him as Samuel did and if you if you recall Samuel heard the voice of God and it it was speaking to him and I want my children to hear his voice speaking to them I I want them to hear him speaking to their hearts and and to to hear his call in their lives I I pray help me to train my children according to the unique way that you have designed each one going over some of the scriptures that we we went through today because each one of them is unique they each have different strengths and talents each one is uh uh passionate about diff different things they care it this is something you know it's so hard sometimes for us as adults we want our children to be little adults too we want them to to just be just like these little men Min mes you know look at this that I have created it should be formed in my image and my model but children are they're different from us you know they have their own personalities they have their own things one of the hardest things for us to do is to connect with a child on their level and and and get down on their level and engage with them as a seven-year-old as a 10-year-old and and to like to interact with them in that way but it's so important I pray father enable me to commit them to your loving care control rather than to worry about them because I I don't know about you but worrying has really never solved anything worry has never really done anything you know when children go go up and they they they start making their decisions and you start allowing them to make their decisions and when they get out of the house the only thing you can do is is pray for them and you have to rely on the things that you've taught them and the things that you've modeled for them and and if you haven't model if you didn't model that you didn't do those things and you have to go back and you have to make it right and say listen I should have done this I should have done that I didn't I'm sorry please forgive me but I don't but sitting there worrying and fretting all the time it doesn't it doesn't do anything I I pray give them Godly friends that they would stir one another up to love and good works because friends uh like the Bible says you know a friend sticketh closer than a brother and and our children need friends they need good friends that that will rally around them that will that will not cause them to Stray From the Path and you hey let's go do this you know let's sneak out and go do this but our children need good Godly friends that will walk with them that will be like a a Jonathan to David and a David to Jonathan I pray I pray this ever since they were young cause them to be and to find a Godly spouse to or to glorify you in singleness if that's what what they're called to keep them sexually pure and honorable and I prayed this I prayed this for a young age for them because in this world there's so much Temptation there's so much Temptation in in pornography and and everything is just it's ever presentent it's everywhere you can't go to the supermarket without seeing it you um you know when when I was young you know is it it was pretty easy to stay away from that kind of thing because it was in a back room you know somewhere that you you know you would never walk into you know and and um the worst thing you saw was the tabloids at the supermarket and I didn't do much grocery shopping so I didn't see a lot of that but nowadays it's everywhere it's the Satan has put it in every in every type of Avenue from the the cartoons that we would allow our kids to watch now have uh lgbtq stuff in them and and the gender you know stuff and and um it's all there it's just all our our children are constantly being bombarded constantly being bombarded by the enemy amen so I you know I I want them to to to to be pure and honorable and keep them from those things I I pray Lord help them to be thankful and content to be thankful for what they've been given and it's gratitude is difficult for children to understand if they are always GI everything if we always give our children everything they want everything they ask for yeah they may say thank you for this but true gratitude comes from lack when when you don't have something and then you have it you're grateful to have it um it it might sound funny but it's good for children every once in a while to go hungry and and to to not have a have a lunch meal or a breakfast and only have a dinner meal you Express a little bit of gratitude for Mama for cooking um You probably won't hear Too Many people say that I don't mean go starve your children but you work hard all day you know and then you come home and you finally get a meal you're thankful for that meal you know and children children don't know AR aren't able to fully understand this concept of thankfulness and gratitude unless they've had it you know and in my in my life growing up we we were very poor we were very poor up until um my my dad when I was very young like one one or two years old my dad worked for the factory he made good money um but he was just getting started he certainly didn't come from General generational wealth he had just got out of the army uh the Vietnam ER and all that and um we lived in a a trailer park our our backyard was literally the dump where the city would come and dump things and we had nothing my dad then got laid off for nearly five years and if we had nothing before we had even less then and you know I distinctly I remember as as a kid uh going to school and at Christmas time they they would in classes as a little kid they would throw throw a little ball and then you know the children would throw a ball to each other when you caught the ball it was your turn and you would tell what you had got for Christmas and I I was really good at lying because I was embarrassed that I hadn't got anything and you know be oh I got a new bike or I got a new this or I got a new that and um we just didn't have it but then when when my dad got picked back up and and uh we finally got moved out of the trailer park and into a house and and they finally started giving us things you know because they could afford it I was grateful for it I was I was grateful for it you know and I I was glad to have little toys to play with and I was glad to have clothes that that didn't have you know uh five different patches in them because I wore them out and Grandma had to sew patches into my jeans and I was grateful that uh I remember many times waking up in the in the winter in the in the trailer that we lived in and uh Frost and Ice being on the inside of the walls because we didn't have enough money to keep things heated very well my eyes just brother Ram talks about his eyes being covered in matter I I've experienced that I don't know if you've ever experienced it but it's not pleasant you know your eyes are completely glued shut with with whatever that stuff is and you know to to not experience that anymore I was grateful I was grateful for a house that had heat I was grateful for uh you know to live in a in a in a when we moved to the to the house that I grew up in after that uh had a corn field behind it instead of a dump I just thought that was just wonderful and um so I was grateful I was grateful if we give our children too much they don't experience that that gratefulness and so sometimes it's good to withhold things from them for a little while and then and then bless them with it later so they experience gratitude uh amen be their Shield I I pray this be their shield in mind heart and body and guard them from the evil one I pray grant me wisdom and strength to raise my children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord and then lastly I pray let your favor rest upon my children let God's favor rest upon my children if I could ask nothing else God that you would just favor my children that you would bless them in spite of my failings in spite of my shortcomings in spite of all the things I've ever done wrong or tried to do right that your favor would rest upon them that's what I want I just want I want that for my children and so I pray these things I've kept this card uh I don't even know how long 10 12 years at least I've had it my wife can testify it I stick it in the corner of the mirror or and then I'll pray it I'll flip it over and I'll pray those and by God's grace my children will make it by God's grace my children will be there and it will be in spite of the failures that I've I've made the mistakes it'll be in spite of my best intentions falling short but by God's grace I believe for my children um I've got a lot more to say and and I'm looking at the little clock here and I know I've run a little I've run over and I thank you for being so attentive and so gracious uh I pray somehow some way this this was a help to you um especially those of you still with children in the household but even even those of you who who who have children who've gone um grandchildren are Second Chance grandchildren are second chance and um I'm personally looking forward to I guess I shouldn't say it that way I say I'm looking forward to having the first one but um that would kind of sound like she's expecting she's not but I'm looking forward to when she does so I can make up for some of the mistakes that I made when they were young um I'm I'm so grateful that the Lord that God is a god of Second Chances amen let's just bow our heads and close in word prayer father thank you Lord for your word for the attentiveness of your people I pray father that you just take these simple principles that we've talked about this morning and that you would help us to each embody them where we are able to uh and I know that Lord sometimes when we we talk about these things it can it can almost seem overwhelming in a way it's like I can't do everything the preacher said I can't remember all that but help us to to take away this the the one or two things that stood out to us and apply them no matter where we are in our lives that we will love you with our whole heart our soul and our might that we pursue you passionately that we will do everything we can to model the right relationship for our children and our family even if they're gone that they'll be able to look back and see a Godly life lived in an example and they they cannot deny the testimony that that you said that the the bride overcame by the word of God and our testimony and let our testimony be true and faithful to you Lord God we pray bless each one bless each family protect them I pray from the the the evil one Lord shelter their families be a hedge of of protection around about them every day as they go on give them the strength to to stand for you in this wicked and evil day and Lord the bride says come quickly even so Lord we pray come quickly we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen Amen brother Jared why don't you come and uh give us a song or two thank you friends for for bearing with me um it was a little difficult for me because I IID expected to have my my slides but I certainly understand I wouldn't want to cause the Audi visual team problems um so I know things were a little disjointed at times but um I pray as a blessing to you sure love you and I appreciate you and if there's anything I can ever do you just let me
