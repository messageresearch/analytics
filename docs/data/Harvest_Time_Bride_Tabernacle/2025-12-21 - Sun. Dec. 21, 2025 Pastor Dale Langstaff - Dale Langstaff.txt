We're just uh uh good to be here. Yes, many. I I was thinking when I was coming up here, I said, "This is almost almost like swearing to me." I said, "I felt like we were back in CO when we were only allowed 10 in the church." Amen. Amen. Just many out. Lauren, brother Lauren and Sister Sheila are gone for Christmas. Went on a cruise and be back the 28th. And I know Lanne was talking to sister Ruth and I had sent brother Bernard a message, but Lan was talking to him about getting together and at our place. And so different ones are out for different reasons. Amen. Brother Matt sick and Amen. And brother Jeff and sister Damla. Amen. They were good on Wednesday. They were here. And just God be with them too. Amen. So &gt;&gt; we just just possible we could have more watching online of our own church &gt;&gt; than we do here. Amen. Amen. But God bless them. I pray that I I pray that the kids are okay with Sister Domla and Brother Jeff and &gt;&gt; and uh Brother Matt gets feeling better. Amen. And just uh God is God is very good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. just uh maybe one little announcement. Brother Jim got somebody to come and watch uh sister Linda from uh from you know assisted living or whatever. And so he's actually here on every uh every Wednesday. So actually last Wednesday or many as long as the weather's good, you know, of course. But so he will actually be sharing some Wednesdays. he shared last Wednesday &gt;&gt; was really nice and and good and &gt;&gt; that but he can get somebody to come on Wednesday but he cannot get nobody on Sunday &gt;&gt; or not not through the same program anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Well, God bless you. It's just good to be here and and we certainly love you and and appreciate your friendship and even those online and we know many are here just or not here because of of just things that have come up. Amen. But um one other little announcement we might uh talk about is uh next Sunday we were actually thinking of having uh next Sunday I believe it's the 28th of having really a worship service and testimony. Maybe I'll share a little something of the word and having communion and footwashing. If I did, it'd probably be about communion and footwashing. Um, the only reason I talked to brother Matt about that earlier, by the way, brother Matt and Abigail weren't here last Sunday because he said they got right on two feet of snow right on the dot. He said the drifts were much lighter than said we had two feet everywhere. He was I forget how long he told me it took it took him like hours to shovel to the curb or it was a long time anyway. I think it was two hours and something but he said we had 2 ft of snow everywhere. &gt;&gt; I mean the the the lake just dumped on him and uh and then this week he's uh not feeling good. But uh so I talked to brother Matt. He he had called and told me that last Sunday and after church and I said, you know, we would have it on the 28th unless they were gone away for, you know, family Christmas or or holidays or things and then we would move it to the first Sunday in January. So if if a lot are going to be gone, we will move it to the first Sunday. That would kind of be our year end uh communion. Amen. Let's just read our scripture and get into our topic today. Let's just turn to Luke uh 2:11 and uh read a scripture here. You can have your seats. Amen. This has been a long time since I ministered on this. We'll just read our scripture. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And you shall be a sign unto you that you shall find the babe wrapped in swallowing clothes, lying in a manger. And as suddenly there appear there was with the angels a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God saying glory to God in the highest and peace on earth good will towards men. Lord Jesus we pray that that whatever your plans were for today it's okay with us. We just are your vessel your tool. We surrender to your will and your leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord God. And Lord, you know, uh, you know, your thoughts before the foundation of the world and what you've laid on my heart to share. But Lord God, if you change them or we go a different route or whatever your will is, &gt;&gt; we give you the glory and honor for your name's sake. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. Am I on, Vicki? &gt;&gt; My mic. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. Well, that's just an amazing scripture. I want to just read a thing and maybe when we get into this or even make a disclaimer. I want my message is today on Christmas and uh and uh I'm going to I'm going to just preach on Christmas uh the truth and the facts of Christmas. But uh in no way if you are in a different spot, I don't feel like I'm elevated because I'm in a different spot than you or or this is not like condemnation and I don't even want to know what you do. And that's between you and God. And and but but you know, I I preached this back in the house before we even bought this. and and I seen our grandkids are getting a little taller and and the the young ones deserve to know the truth. &gt;&gt; Um and uh &gt;&gt; and what we do with it is is an individual affair &gt;&gt; and and so let's just not have an arm wrestling mass after I don't want to talk about it after. It don't make no difference to me. Uh I I do what I feel God wants me to do for me the best I can and and even then I fail daily, hourly, minutely &gt;&gt; and every few seconds too &gt;&gt; and uh but I I there is some history involved here &gt;&gt; and there is some truth involved &gt;&gt; and I want to show you some of these things and if you see it differently you know God bless you. Amen. I want to just show you the first quote here. He said, "Brother Bam said,"Remember during Christmas to worship the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Worship him and the power in his power and his resurrection." Now, you know, I just shared this one quote here. Brother Bram said multiple times that Christmas should be worshiped. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why I said next Sunday, if we did if we did nothing but worship Jehovah &gt;&gt; and testify and give him the glory. You know, there's some of you have powerful testimonies and Sister Dla is one of them and it's just because she's shared them. But but God is very much alive and well. Amen. And and doing we we actually had a a testimony just yesterday. We celebrated the first birthday yesterday of our little grandson, Oliver. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that that's just completely a miracle from the beginning to end. I actually thought when he was born he was under 3 lb, but he was over 3 lb. &gt;&gt; I found that out yesterday. &gt;&gt; But uh God is very good. Amen. And and we just we just know that. And and so it Christmas is about worship. And and we might even get into it uh uh before, but I'm going to tell you another thing that brother Brandham said. He said, "Without Christmas, you would not have salvation." Okay. &gt;&gt; Without Christmas, &gt;&gt; there's no salvation. &gt;&gt; So Christmas is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just maybe we'll read our Oh, here we go. Here. He said, "If there wasn't a Christmas, there wouldn't even be salvation." Now, we're facing Christmas again. And it's too bad that we've changed the real meaning of it. I don't mean you have, but I just mean around it. You know, I might say things. I'm not pointing at nobody. You know, I'm just saying this is very general &gt;&gt; that the general meaning of Christmas has changed of being the birth of Jesus until well that Santa Claus has taken the place of Christ. I don't mean he has in your home &gt;&gt; but in the world. Amen. I'm &gt;&gt; but and you know the the the lies of of you know all these things and and Santa Claus don't come down a chimney and he can't fit in my chimney and there's too much soot in it. It would be sticky, by the way, &gt;&gt; because I'm burning a little bit of almost wet wood &gt;&gt; and he's far too fat. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we need to be truthful. And brother Bram says things like this that our kids need to know the truth. Jesus came and was born and he brought salvation to the earth, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't now. &gt;&gt; It was probably in April. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Bram said that Jesus was a lamb and if he was born now, he probably was like Matt Lacroy last Sunday. He probably had 2 feet of snow through Jerusalem. He would have froze to death on the donkey. A lot of the roads and the mountains would have been snowed in completely. The valleys would have been full and there would have been no birth this time of year. Amen. But it was a birth. &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Bram said things like this. He said, "Christmas is like tubeless tires. &gt;&gt; It's this time of year, but it ain't going to change." Right. &gt;&gt; We can celebrate Christmas April 1st if you want to. That's okay with me. &gt;&gt; But we're not going to change the the world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh scenario. Tubeless tires, brother Bram said, are here to stay. And I hate them. &gt;&gt; And the celebration of Christmas is here this time of year, whether you celebrate it or not. And there's multiple people that don't in no fashion at all. &gt;&gt; At least not this time of year. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's just look in our Matthew 1 and we we're going to read the Christmas story and get into some some history and some facts and and uh here Matthew 1:18. It said, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise that when the mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they had come together that she was found with child of the Holy Ghost." And then Joseph being before them together. Uh uh sorry. And then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was mindful to put her away privately. 20 And while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife, for what is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, and he shall save his people &gt;&gt; from their sins. And the last part of verse 23, and they called his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. And we know as we serve God, and we know this in the message that we're not serving God in a manger. God is not in a manger. He's not a baby. God is real today. He came down in our age. And and he is our headship. Amen. And he is uh Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And but this is the truth. and part of the scriptures. Let's look in our scripture Ephesians and we're just laying a a little bit of a foundation. You know, when my studying this week, uh there's a great amount of studying you could go into. Brother Bam mentioned somebody that was preaching an evangelist and he really liked them. I don't have my Bible. I just I'm preaching on my iPad this morning. But the man said, you know, he said if it wasn't sacriiggious, he said, I would take my Bible and I would put it on the floor and I would stand on my Bible. And he said, "Because the Bible says that heaven and earth will pass away. &gt;&gt; But the only thing that will never pass away is God's word. &gt;&gt; God's written word will never pass away." And brother Bram says, he says, "I like that. I like that because it's truth." Amen. And so here we see in 1 Thessalonians 5 20 and 22 why why I'm going into this I'm going to show you some truths of the Bible and of brother Brandham that it's fine if anybody does it fine. You can cherrypick all you want the Bible andor the message and that's between you and God but it won't clear you on that day. 1 Thessalonians 5:20 says, "Despise not prophecy. Prove all things. Hold fast to that which is good. Abstain from the very appearance of evil." &gt;&gt; Hosea here the next one. And I'm going to, you know, in the new year I'm going to preach on this. I was talking to somebody about this and I'm I'm going to do a message on this. I believe if God will let me. A lot of times messages come, you know, weeks ahead of time. But Hosea, I think I'm saying that right. 4:6, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Because thou has rejected knowledge, I will reject thee. Now, that doesn't matter to me if you believe that part of the scripture or not, but I do. &gt;&gt; I do. Now, God won't hold you accountable. We preach that about grace. God won't hold people accountable that haven't been blessed with the knowledge, revelation, or insight of what we have been. But if you ever hear the truth and you turn it down, that's called iniquity. &gt;&gt; And iniquity is to know to do right and do it not. &gt;&gt; This is to know the truth. Now, a perfect example of this that I just totally don't understand. and and and I'm I'm just Brother Dale, so I'm preaching what God gives me is I don't understand this why people go to Starbucks &gt;&gt; because and I and I'm going to tell you something. One of my favorite ministers is Osman Bartley and I was telling him my revelation on this and he he he couldn't believe it. He said he like he looked at me like, "Are you sure?" And I just took my phone and I just Googled it like that and in 5 seconds I had it. The CEO of Starbucks says he don't want anybody to come in our store and we don't want no money from anybody that's in or believes in a conventional marriage of a man and a woman. Now, what in the world is message believers doing sitting in a Starbucks when it was based on sex and paganism and their very symbol is the woman in the act &gt;&gt; and the CEO you can Google says we don't want your money. &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? I'm just going to tell you brother Dale's opinion. They won't have to worry about getting any of mine &gt;&gt; cuz I would die of thirst and hunger both before I went to one. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Because see, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But because they reject knowledge, I will reject thee. That's like the the another example to show you this scripture powerfully is the uh power aid drinks. &gt;&gt; The power drinks are all the they have the upside down broken cross of Christianity. The symbol on the power eight drinks is the 666, the mark of the beast. The everything on that can everything on that can is to blaspheme Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sure is. &gt;&gt; And you have to either be illiterate or unconverted to buy power aid. &gt;&gt; You have to be monster drink. Sorry. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, that's right. &gt;&gt; My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Amen. God won't smile at these if we know the truth. Cuz see, Satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. &gt;&gt; And and you can be fun. You know, you can be worshiping Satan thinking you're worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that quote that we put up there and you you don't you can or whatever Vicki the but later down in that quote, Brother Bram said, "You can tell your kids whatever you want about Santa Claus, but my Bible says that you shouldn't be a liar." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm not going to be caught lying to my kids cuz someday they'll come to you and say, well, is Jesus just like Santa Claus? He ain't really real either." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what your prophet said. Now, if we get into Matthew 5:17 and 20, he said, "Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets, for I came to destroy them, not but to fulfill them." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass away, not one Watch this now, you need to catch. Oh, now Vicki, don't she's not printing my my my scriptures right off my iPad, but it says not one jot right in the middle. Heaven and earth will pass away. But not one jot, not one title, &gt;&gt; tit shall in any wise pass from the law until it be fulfilled. Now I want to show you this. And brother Brown says every part of God's scripture &gt;&gt; is true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Including the commas. And whosoever so therefore shall break one of these least comments these least comments and shall teach men so they shall be called the least of the kingdom of heaven. But whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. and verse 20. For I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisee, you shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven. So here in Matthew, here's Jesus himself showing us that all of God's written word of the prophecies in the Bible are true. Now watch how brother Brandham answers this. He says in questions and answers 62, he says, "Every word that you speak in the Bible, you you speak in your Bible, the Lord, we punctuate it with an amen. &gt;&gt; We believe every word of it. And we teach it just the best of our knowledge, just the way it's written. Every punctuation, every &gt;&gt; hyphen, thank you. And every period, and every comma, JUST THE WAY it's written, to the best of our knowledge." NOW THIS IS YOUR prophet talking about the Bible. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe that is completely your choice &gt;&gt; here in another one in perseverance he said then when the word then the Bible is either the word or it isn't. And if it's the word and it's got to be produced everything that it promised. Amen. We believe that everything that's in the Bible is for our church. And if it isn't, then then which is right and which is wrong? Which one you want to take out? &gt;&gt; You see, it's all God's word or to me, none of it is. None or all one. So I believe it. Every punctuation, every line, every punctuation, every comma, every hyphen, I believe the whole thing is the word of God. And brother Bram saying, "And I hang my soul &gt;&gt; on it." &gt;&gt; Now, I I want to give you a disclaimer. I don't I don't mean you, but I said many people don't do that. &gt;&gt; Many people don't do that. Like I I I'm just I'm just GOING TO JUST JUMP OUT OF THE BOX for a minute. The Bible says the borrower is the slave to the lender. THAT'S STILL THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; NOW, I don't know how you would buy a house without borrowing money, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE STILL THEIR SLAVE. IF YOU WANT TO JUST JUMP out of that paraphrase, I'm just finishing paying the mortgage on my home farm and so I dropped the insurance on my house. Who do you think called me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Hey, Dell, we got a notice from your insurance company. You dropped your fire insurance." They said, "Yeah, I did." They said, "But our law." Oh, they have a law. &gt;&gt; They said our law is Now listen, my mortgage is about the size of a car loan on my home farm. &gt;&gt; Now, my land with the house and not all tore down is worth like, let me see, eight times what I would owe them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; If you owe me a hundred bucks, you're insuring that house. &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, the borrower is the slave to the lender. That you might not like that, BUT THAT'S STILL ACTUALLY THE TRUTH. IF SOMEBODY gives you money, they get to dictate what you do and how you do that money. &gt;&gt; AND SO, IF YOU CAME FROM GOD AND YOU'RE A PART OF GOD, God gets to dictate your actions. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S JUST A NO-BRAINER. AND AND THE WORLDLY SYSTEM HAS NO PROBLEM calling you. Yes, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY, "BUT I ONLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM. I ONLY HAVE A TEENY MORTGAGE." &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; They'll say, "But the letter says, &gt;&gt; "Ensure your house." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Well, here just to lay a foundation and and and listen, all these quotes I could have gave you doubled. I didn't cherry pick. There's there's multiple, but I I do want to maybe finish today. He said when we get one absolute and that's the word of God, the living word of God. He said by God's word, God's absolute is his word. And when we got one absolute, that's the word. Oh, sorry. I'm repeating that. Next paragraph, an absolute. I I forgot to erase that one cuz I had two lines in one message. Sorry. And now if he's OUR ABSOLUTE, THERE'S NO OTHER ABSOLUTE. If Christ is your absolute, you believe Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm just going to step out of this just for a second because people challenge Brother Brown. They go, "Brother Brown like this message is the Bible revealed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It But it's not the Bible. &gt;&gt; But it is the Bible. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the Bible so you can understand it. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand the Bible before. Nobody did. &gt;&gt; God had sealed it up. There's no theologian understood the Bible. So God sent a prophet to take the mysteries. I will do nothing. Amos 3:8. I will do nothing except I reveal my secrets to the servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; And those secrets were the mysteries that are revealed. They open their eyes and go, "Oh, praise God." That's cuz he loves you. Amen. But people came to brother Brandham and he said, you know, and brother Bham's message is nothing but the truth. And they said, but you could write another book of Acts or Revelation. And brother Bham said, if I did that, God would take my name out of the Lamb's book of life. And so people that come up and they say, "Well, I only need to preach from the message books and we don't need the Bible no more." They're pagan &gt;&gt; because brother Bam said dozens of times that my words I think about 36 that my words will fail or can fail. But let's read the anointed word of God because they'll never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See when Paul watch this. Paul saidf follow me as I follow Christ. I want to show you something. We don't follow Paul as he was following Paul when he was killing the Christians, &gt;&gt; you know. So some people when they look at Chris I mean I mean this this is going to be the worst thing I say the whole message. So just for those of you are nervous plug your ears. But those of you or or those of anybody that would say, "Well, this is what brother Brandham did, but he but he this I want to tell you something. That's thinner broth than a chicken that starved to death." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because brother Bram took a rifle loaded and was a cracked shot and pointed at that three boys and would have killed them. That's right. &gt;&gt; We going to do that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, when he was suffering from the death of his wife and his little girl, pulled off his mitt and grabbed an electrical wire that would have blew his body to smither rings. &gt;&gt; Because he was in grieving. &gt;&gt; So don't tell me that brother Brham did it. So it's okay. Watch the scripture. Paul said, "Follow me &gt;&gt; as I follow Christ." Brother Brennham said the same thing. He said, "If you can't find it in the word of God, just sit lay it aside. Lay it aside." Brother Brennham, he loved hunting. He You don't have to go to the Rocky Mountains and hunt like Brother Bam. You don't have to buy a big bump buckle, have a cap and wear the same uh you know uh you know, briefcase that Brother Brham had. Maybe you won't. He said see is if what I say is in the Bible follow and it is but brother Brennham was a HUMAN BEING. &gt;&gt; HE LIKED FORD. SO ANYBODY THAT'S DRIVING something different than for sorry &gt;&gt; no no that was the flesh side. &gt;&gt; But brother Brown was God's chosen man of the hour for this age &gt;&gt; to reveal the mysteries of the Bible. But he also was a person. He said, "You know, I like cherry pie. My wife likes something else, but we still get along." &gt;&gt; Wow. That's a mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our next quote. So, we just we laid that down. So, this is where people and and it's and and I like I said, I'm just it doesn't matter to me where you are. I'm just preaching the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham preached one thing, and I don't I don't know how to say this exactly, but I I hope you won't leave the church over this, but brother Brown preached the truth, &gt;&gt; but there were things he lived differently. Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; I don't mean he was a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; I just mean he was a human. &gt;&gt; I don't mean he was hypocrite. I just mean he was a human. Brother Bram said something like this. He, you know, believe me, I have studied this tremendously. &gt;&gt; He said, you know, when you're looking at Christmas, remember the children. &gt;&gt; And he goes all into this a huge amount behind the pulpit. I I' I'd like some people to hear this quote &gt;&gt; that that that have problem with children. And he goes into all this about how children love Christmas. &gt;&gt; And then he says something. He says, "Just remember, just remember, Jared, you were a child once, too." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just remember, you were five once, too. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I done forgot that a long time ago. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; sometimes we forget our Just remember you used to wake up mom and daddy too when you were getting &gt;&gt; a bone arrow. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, it just gives us help us to understand that we're not all at the same age of stiff bones and sore muscles. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And believe me, I'm that was for me and Lyn. Wow. We were hanging up these Christmas lights and uh or what? Not Christmas, whatever these lights are. Maybe they are Christmas lights. They're going to stay up year round. But and I needed a massage therapist after I get done climbing the step ladder. I thought sake's alive. I used to make a living climbing ladders. Anyway, amen. things change. Amen. Watch here in our our quote here. He said, "How far have they missed the meaning of Christmas?" And he said, "It's become a commercial act." Now, that don't mean that it has to you or to me. We're talking very general here, but the kids need to the I'm going to hit some facts on on Christmas that the kids need to know that everybody around you is doing this and it's okay if you're their friend. I do not condemn it. You will but you don't have you need to know the truth. &gt;&gt; You don't you need to know the truth. All the holidays have become that mother's day and father's day and you know these are mother's day should be every day of the year but every day ought to be mother's day and father's day but they made Easter Santa Clauses took the birthplace and rabbits and chickens. Do you know I I I know churches that actually have EASTER EGG HUNTS ON SUNDAY MORNING. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And they go outside the sanctuary and the &gt;&gt; and many of them &gt;&gt; I'm online so I you you would be blown away. Now a painted Easter egg coming out of a bunny rabbit has got what to do with Jesus and the resurrection? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, that's just blight and lies. &gt;&gt; That's just blight and lies. We just got to be truthful. &gt;&gt; Santa Claus don't know if you're naughty or nice. &gt;&gt; And he don't know my house address. And he cannot fit down my chimney. And he does not eat the cookies and milk that that's left on the table that aren't left there. &gt;&gt; Those are lies. &gt;&gt; Those are bllightened lies. Don't go there with your kids. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in it. &gt;&gt; You can still have a big meal. I believe that you should celebrate Jesus Christ and your family and friends and have good fellowship and eat a lot and and and and be thankful and and all this thing, but there's a place THAT YOU CAN'T GO. Y that's right. &gt;&gt; Santa Claus has took the birthplace and rabbits and chickens and little ducks have took the resurrection time and it's all about chickens and ducks and eggs and that's what's that got to do with the resurrection. See, it's too bad that we put this before our children. &gt;&gt; And many times little boys out here tonight and you tell them they know more about David Crockett. That that's terrible. Nothing wrong with David Crockett, but do they know about the 12 disciples, &gt;&gt; you know? Do they know do they know how to sing godly songs? &gt;&gt; Do they know anything about the Bible? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the way, we're going to the church or somebody or I or somebody's going to I know somebody that wrote a a a family devotions for for parents with small kids. John Garrick did and it's on Amazon and every one of the families that's got small children in this church is going to have one if it comes from the church or comes from me. Amen. That's God's word. You're to you're to raise up in the morning and plant God's word in their minds. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not lies. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you watch parents, they will dress up their kids in Davy Crockett clothes and sell them and all this. And if you and if we could just take the program of Christ over the people like that. And usually you try to impersonate what you read. What you feed your kids is what they'll live. Amen. So let's go to our next scripture. Jeremiah 10 1:5. And this is the one that makes everyone so nervous. And and I hope you're not nervous, but Jeremiah was actually a legitimate prophet of God. And most people don't believe this and don't believe it applies today. But I want to show you just maybe before we read this scripture. You know, when I preached on Christmas back in the house, we can I preached on I did major study on it. Science, the pagan roots, the surprising facts of Christmas. &gt;&gt; Anybody that wants these, I can print them off for you. The history of Christmas and the Christmas tree and Christmas wreaths. Google. Google. People actually know this from Google. Here, here's another one. I I got these folded over so I can Here's what's the title of this one from Google. All about Christmas trees, the pagan organs, the Christian adoption, and the solar the solless. The sun's burning out. Here's a to-do farms. The history of the Christmas tree. You know, if if Google knows all about this, shouldn't the message believers know about it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whether you have whatever you have, that's your business. And I hear the word of the Lord that spake unto you in the house of O Israel. Thus sayaith the Lord, learn not the way of the heathens, and be not dismayed that the signs of the heavens, for the heathens are dismayed at them. For the customs of the people are vain, and they are one that cutth down a tree in the forest, and workketh the hands of a workman, with an axe, and they deck it with silver and gold, and they fasten it with nails, and with hammers, that it move not, and they are upright as a palm tree, but speak not, and they must be born, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil. Neither also is it in them. Neither also is it in them. &gt;&gt; Neither also is it in them. My old record player stuck on a crack. Neither is it also in them to do good. &gt;&gt; Somebody just bumped me out of the crack. Remember those old records? You know? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Watch what your prophet said about it. He said, "And give us the spirit, the true spirit of Christmas, and today that when the pagan celebrations and Christmas tree worshiped and friction fiction stories, a man named Santa Claus and of our Easter bunnies that have eggs, that's a special bunny, and different fashions and that commercial world has capitalized on. May it be laid aside for God. &gt;&gt; Another one. But when Christians, Christianity was brought into Romanism and it mixed with Dioa. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then they had the sun god Jupiter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the sun god of Rome. And the birthday that was the the birthday was actually December 21st maybe to 22nd. Yeah. And the Roman stated that on the 21st lasted till the 25th to celebrate the sun god. And here we see here blending Romanism with paganism to Christianize. Let us make the son of God's birthday. And they agreed on it. It's always been a symbol of compromising of the truth. &gt;&gt; Every time &gt;&gt; it's always been. Now, we we you have your own thoughts on Romanism and the Catholic Church and all this, but many people that believe that don't believe this. There's not one speck, ditto, or dot of God in the Roman Catholic church. &gt;&gt; That's pagan and false &gt;&gt; from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. 1 Thessalonians 5 4 and 6 and 20 and 22. But ye he But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the light shall overtake you as a thief. Ye are children all of the light, and the and the children of the day, and ye shall not of the night, nor of the darkness. Therefore, let us not sleep as others, but let us watch and be sober. &gt;&gt; Here, watch what it says here. Now I read this before. Despise not prophecies. Prove all things. Hold fast to that which is good. And abstain from the very appearance of evil. Here we go look into another example here that our prophet said. He said this was questions and answers. He said, "What about a Christmas play in a Holy Ghost church?" He said, "Well, if it was about Christ, it might be all right. I would be delighted if you sisters did a play with all our kids." We have more children in this church than we have adults, I think. And you did a play of the Bible scene and the birth of Christ. It involves the kids and and it's beautiful. Amen. And it's also Bible and scriptural. He said, "If it was about Christ, it would be all right. But if it was about Santa Claus, I don't believe in him. I done ground away from that. I don't believe in Santa Claus at all." &gt;&gt; Some of these little Christmas things they have, I think, are ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I think they took Christ out of Christmas and put in Santa Claus. And Santa Claus is a fiction story. And I said, I don't mean to be hurting your feelings and I hope about the children, but I'll tell you here a long time ago, 25, 30 years ago when a minister was here and had a big paper and he said, "I know this real well." He's a bruising friend of mine. He said, "I'll tell you my kids. I have grandkids and I told them that lie no more. He said, "My own little kids walked up to me after they got about 20 years old talking about Santa Claus and they said, "Why honey? I got something to tell you." He said after he came back, he said, "Daddy, is Jesus fake too?" &gt;&gt; Here the last paragraph of this answer, he says, "Tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Santa Claus is a Catholic. Get up about a fellow Christian Chris Giggles &gt;&gt; Gringles St. Nicholas and it's a German Catholic saint from many years &gt;&gt; doing good. Jesus is the son of God &gt;&gt; and he really lives &gt;&gt; and is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our kids need to know this. I want I want I I I'm not going to be long this morning, but I I do have some things on my paper here. Things he said. Now notice that our next paragraph he said, Nian Council and Ro gave gave it to the denominations decrees. They accepted the drama dramas instead of the word to take down the pagan idols like Jupiter and so forth. And they changed the birthday from Jesus from April to where all nature is born. And they changed that up to the sun god birthday to the solar system. And it's just about one minute different than the day that would pass from the 25th to the 21st. &gt;&gt; And every of us play Santa Claus and decorate trees, a heathenism, things like that. And they call themselves Christians. What's the matter with the Christian church? &gt;&gt; Now, I I would just put a disclaimer here. And some of these, not all of them, but that one is well after the seals. That's a year before he was killed. Santa Claus took the place of Christ. And Santa Claus, there never was such a person. It's absolutely a Catholic tradition. And not anything to do with Protestant or anything about it. See Chris or Christmas or the birth of Christ. Not at all. Not. But Santa Claus is here to stay. Another one. He said, "We oughtn't to have anything to do with Santa Claus and things." &gt;&gt; Next one. What kind of worship can you get at a church that knows so little about God that they put up Santa Claus and Easter bunnies in the church? Where did they get that? They got it from the pagan and made it part of the church doctrine. But when it turns, the Lord is full of the Holy Ghost. He'll cease from all such things and his soul will rest beginning to love and worship God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's the more of a myth of Santa Claus? Never such a thing. Telling your kids lies. You'll be responsible in the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For lying. &gt;&gt; Get away from the tinsel of Santa Claus and get back to the gift of God and back to the gift of the Holy Ghost. where Satan has robbed all of us of this is made a great commercial Santa Claus and stole all the worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's become a day of Easter bunny rabbits and pink ducks. What's that got to do with Easter and the resurrection of Christ? Yeah, &gt;&gt; but the birthday of Christ I believe should be a day consecrated consecration and worship instead of tonight people in church on their knees praying and thanking God for the real Christmas gift. Amen. I I know you adults know this, but I got grandkids here that have never heard this preached. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; ever. &gt;&gt; Ever. Cuz I've never preached it since I Felix were small in the house church. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to show you some uh Google facts of some of the things that go on in our lifestyle here. And we might come back to these quotes. We're not we're not I'm not going to hold you long. I know I I hope I'm not borrowing some of you, &gt;&gt; but uh it was Queen Charlotte that introduced the tradition in the royal court to her granddaughter, Queen Victoria. And it was her German husband that was Prince Albert. &gt;&gt; And the first Christmas tree that ever hit England was 1848. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And her German king was pagan. &gt;&gt; But the Queen Charlotte, her husband was King George III, who married Queen Charlotte, German born Queen, accredited with bringing the first Christmas tree to England in the 16th century. And it used to be a yew tree which was just a branch and it later become a whole tree. And they put the first tree up in the 1800s in December in the Windsor Queen Lodge in a children's party. 1800s. Amen. Remember this has this has no eternity attached to it. It had a beginning. &gt;&gt; I want to show you something here. Just Google. He says pagan. Many pagans celebrate a Christmas tree in December and decorate them and still do this. &gt;&gt; And they recognize the winner solus. So am I saying that right? Sultus. And you they recognize and this is what the reefs I you need to know the truth. Whatever you do is besides this. &gt;&gt; But the reason for this was they believed the sun was burning out. &gt;&gt; I want you I I I can read it better. Th this this the sun thing. They noticed that the days were gradually getting shorter and they feared the sun would eventually disappear forever and everyone would freeze in the dark and through this dedication of trees and branches and crops would die. And even some of their their pagan gods were gods of fertilization because of the crops and the Christmas reef. when they started putting the Christmas wreath on the door was to ward out the evil spirits of the darkness so they wouldn't come into your house. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was greenery. &gt;&gt; It's all pagan. &gt;&gt; All pagan. &gt;&gt; That's right. And they thought that it had magical powers &gt;&gt; that would enable to withstand the rigorous winter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The first occasion of Christmas trees was the Greek and they worshiped the god and I couldn't even tell you all these gods names. an ancient pagan Roman dedicated their trees with bits and different things here. And the fertiliz the the fertiliz gods, they were all they had 12 gods. And they normally would put 12 candles on the tree &gt;&gt; all represented pagan &gt;&gt; pagan pagan. &gt;&gt; And this normally I want to show you something here. I missed something here. It wasn't until 1840 that the first pagan tree was accepted normally in England. And write this on Google. They said it was highly unaccepted by the majority of Christians. I got another thing to I might not find it here exactly, but Christmas trees were against the law. I actually have it on my phone. I actually have the newspaper printing print out says notice public public notice forbidden &gt;&gt; forbidden. It was against the law to have a Christmas tree in the states until 1681. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Federal offense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But because of Catholicism wanting to join with the pagan rather than fight them, they compromise all the truth &gt;&gt; of Jehovah. Do you notice that they never took the April birthday, &gt;&gt; but they took the December 21st birthday? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who had the priority &gt;&gt; on the picking? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The kids need to know the truth. The truth of this here. &gt;&gt; The Roman Catholic Church and the customs of the pagan was tra traditionally helped to converting the northern German peoples. It's it's actually Germanetic people &gt;&gt; and the pre-existing all these gods and Rome just said, "Oh, just bring all your gods, fill up our churches." &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; we have no problem. There was the help in the tradition from paganism to people over to Catholicism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what Google will tell you. &gt;&gt; Google. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Witchcraft. What's that got to do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the magnificent birth of Christ. absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; So we we celebrate Christmas, but it's about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's about worship. It's about salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Giving gifts. That's what God gave to us was gifts. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's better to give than receive. That's good. I mean, that's good any day of the week. But God wasn't born on December 25th, kids. &gt;&gt; He would have froze to death. &gt;&gt; And bunnies don't have colored eggs. &gt;&gt; And a Christmas tree or a Christmas wreath has absolutely less than zero &gt;&gt; to do with God. &gt;&gt; And if you wanted to treat, you watch this. You know, if you have a brain, you can think about this. Like cutting down a tree with an axe is death. And we're celebrating a birth. &gt;&gt; If you want to have a tree, why wouldn't you buy a potted plant that cleans the air and bring in a live tree that's about life and resurrection and and &gt;&gt; because you want to know why? Because Satan's all about death &gt;&gt; and destruction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God actually gave us trees to clean our air. They they put out carbon dioxide and breathe in ox or they breathe in carbon dioxide. Put out oxygen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that Google told me this week that MOST PEOPLE GET SICK AT Christmas because dad trees carry molds? And people realize as soon as they get rid of the the greenery in their house, they almost immediately get better &gt;&gt; because they're under the stench of the mold from death. &gt;&gt; From death, &gt;&gt; saying they're celebrating life. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able to be in this world and be of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm not going nowhere. and telling somebody that's doing something different me that they're wrong. &gt;&gt; That's not If they ask you what's right and wrong, &gt;&gt; you're going to make lots of good enemies. If you start telling people that don't want to know what I just told you, &gt;&gt; cuz see, not all people want to know the truth, &gt;&gt; but just for and even some online, I know I know some people online. This is religious tolerance Christmas tree. Anybody that wants this copied off history of Christmas tree facts, proven facts. Pagan worship facts of Christmas. &gt;&gt; You know, Noel Farms, all the history of Christmas, pagan. &gt;&gt; There's got to be something good about the internet. &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the truth &gt;&gt; shall set you free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I actually believe I actually believe and I believe God would teach us that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You can go into any place where there's a Christmas tree and your power that's on you is much stronger than any fake power of any kind. You don't have to act like you're some &gt;&gt; but when you make a conscientious decision &gt;&gt; to go in their camp &gt;&gt; and bring it into &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christmas should be a time of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have beautiful Christmas songs, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; We don't have to sing. There's no reindeers that can fly. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You know, and they don't land on my rooftop cuz I have steel roof. It's very slippery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, like you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; It's all kind of But be careful. I I want to I want to I want to give you a warning. My kids have no clue what it's like to live without a cell phone and date your girlfriend without a cell phone. They think it's always been there. &gt;&gt; OKAY. THEY THEY ACTUALLY THINK that houses always had running water and a bathroom. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're raising your kids like they think there was always Christmas trees &gt;&gt; and there was always Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; And that's a lie. &gt;&gt; Because it used to be illegal &gt;&gt; on this continent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's a drastic change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a drastic change. And so when young people come up and they say, you know, we had car, you know, when me and Len died, like her car never had power steering, it was it was like you when you you you couldn't turn the wheel unless you were moving. &gt;&gt; And our kids farm, none of the tractors had power steerings. &gt;&gt; Hydraulics. What's hydraulics? They never existed. the weight trip that and then you let it down the ground and put it back and click to the notch. &gt;&gt; And so this is how Christmas has come in the church where it's and and watch this. We preach this. If you're going to if you're going to leave the word, we can leave it on everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know there's only one scripture in the Old Testament talks about men and women's dress wear? There's five about Christmas tree. Which prophet you want to believe? Wow. &gt;&gt; See, if we start removing the Bible, it's it's a very reckless slope. &gt;&gt; You see, if one's real, it's all real &gt;&gt; through. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's amazing, especially when history &gt;&gt; will show you the truth. &gt;&gt; This ain't brother Brandham studied these things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brown read books. He was an educated man. He was Brother Brown was a selfeducated man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit came in and said there this is and this is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you need to raise your kids and you know this is what's happening now. But it always wasn't like this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the truth is still good. &gt;&gt; And I I believe I totally believe that God loves families and God loves worship and God provided all your food and and give gifts. Always give lots of gifts. Everything is about love and kindness and grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but it never happened this time of year. &gt;&gt; Now, I do like all the lights because I don't like the dark. &gt;&gt; I don't like anything black. &gt;&gt; And when it gets dark at 5:00 and I or 4:30 and I think 7:00's midnight and I go up to bed and then I wake up at 3:00 in the night and I think my night's over, I I went to bed at 7:00. 3:00's morning time, it's still dark out and I'm like, "Oh, boys." Amen. &gt;&gt; But today we bring a Christmas tree in this church. Do you know I was watching when I was studying this that there's churches in this country that are bringing in drag queens, fat old 60y old men dressed in women's clothes to talk to the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was in Vancouver. You see, you see when you start a ball of snow and it starts rolling down the hill Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you start leaving the truth, &gt;&gt; it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. &gt;&gt; I pray I pray with all my heart. I'm I'm definitely closing that God keeps us in the truth, &gt;&gt; balanced in the truth. Brother Dale don't want to be in either ditch. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I know we're living in the grace age. Praise God for that. And and and I believe me, I I believe that and need that more than any one of you sitting here. &gt;&gt; But there's things that are just plain truthful and not truthful. And I'm saying with God's help, it's worth it to me to be honest and truthful. &gt;&gt; I don't desire to say, "Well, you know, God changed." I don't see that. I see Hebrews 8:13 &gt;&gt; says that he's the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; That's right. and forever. &gt;&gt; And I believe I even believe you know that every service is different but there's times where you need to teach knowledge truth &gt;&gt; of the Bible and the trends of the day so the young people can put down deep roots and when they get challenged in the grocery store say why don't you do this? &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; they don't have to say I don't know They can say because I know &gt;&gt; why do you think God's word says study to show thyself approved? &gt;&gt; Why do you serve God? Because it's real, truthful, and it's still alive and he's doing everything for me that I need today. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have no desire &gt;&gt; to leave that. No, &gt;&gt; you watch how the whole trends in in holiness and and I mean we preached that before and in Christmas, you know, watch this. I I I I'm trying to close. &gt;&gt; Where's my phone? I want to show you something. This message is the truth. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; There is nothing else. Yeah, &gt;&gt; hear me. You can you can do you can say anything you want. I'm going down worshiping this Bible and the revelation that this message is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if we which we are are so blessed in our day to have the secrets revealed. I want to show you something. the Jehovah's Witness Church, the 7th Day Adventist, the Deeper Life Bible Church, the Mountain Five Ministry Church, the God's Kingdom Socialists. I might be saying that wrong. And the Quakers &gt;&gt; know more about Christmas than message people in North America. Because none of them celebrate Christmas on December 25th. None of them celebrate Santa Claus and reindeers on roofs. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to just give you one little closeout as we close. Matter of fact, you can come, honey. If any of you come to meet with me on a mission trip and you went anywhere in this continent and England, you wouldn't even be allowed in the Well, you definitely wouldn't be speaking or singing in the church if they thought you celebrated Christmas like most people do right here. Most most most the whole continent of Africa, &gt;&gt; the whole landscape of the Philippines &gt;&gt; is nothing but conventions from December 24th till about January 1st or 2nd. &gt;&gt; You know, Pastor Vincent, he has a convention at his place. You know how long the church service was? It was from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30 at night. One service and we're going to the same heaven. &gt;&gt; We're reading out of the same message books &gt;&gt; and the same Bible. &gt;&gt; Now, they would have a stop for dinner. Do you see the difference? When I went to the Philippines, I went to church four times. Actually, no, it wasn't in the Philippines. It was actually in Ghana. In Ghana, I went to I went to church four times on Christmas Day. &gt;&gt; Four times. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was all about worshiping &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was all about worship. The only people in the Philippines that had a Christmas tree was the Roman Catholic Church, &gt;&gt; not the Seventh Day Adventists, &gt;&gt; not the Jehovah's Witness, and definitely not message people. &gt;&gt; The only time they had camp meetings in the Philippines was right over the Christmas holidays, Christmas and New Year's. A thousand people, totally not uncommon, in one place. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here in North America, when Christmas falls on sun on when Sunday falls on Christmas, there's churches right in this province that have closed their doors. &gt;&gt; Closed their doors. &gt;&gt; You see, if you start going in the ditch, &gt;&gt; if you start leaving the truth of the Bible, &gt;&gt; Yeah. When our grandkids come up, they won't even know what they won't even &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; See, you have to hold the line. &gt;&gt; Hold the line. Whatever you do and compromise, your kids will do in access. Hold the line. What did brother Brandham see when he seen the bride coming in from all the nations and some of the tailwind of the American, I believe it was American bride, and they started to get out of sin. He said screamed out. He said, "Hold the line. Keep your eye on Christ. &gt;&gt; Keep your eye on Christ. That's all this message is. Keep your eye on Christ. Yes, without Christmas, there would be no salvation. Yes, the son of God came in the Lord Jesus Christ. And yes, he was born in a manger, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't this time of year. And it has nothing to do with all this other commercial &gt;&gt; and glamour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you if we were serving God like the prophet said, we would have a church service on sun on Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. God help us just to to to be truthful. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be truthful. Let's stand. Amen. Let's sing that chorus we sang before. Come let us adore. Oh come let us come let us. Oh, heat, heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat.
