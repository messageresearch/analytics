have your seats this morning it's just amazing to be back and we welcome you welcome brother Je amen welcome amen we welcome our family from India amen it's just amazing to be here and we welcome Charles too and all of you it's just good to be you know the prophet said that when God spoke the logos out of himself that he became a family man that's what he said he said he became a family man when he created his family amen and we're part part of that family man every one of us are an equal part of that family perfectly equal part of that family amen it was just uh God is just amazing amen we just want to share just a just a few moments this is not a service that we're going to share everything I I uh really feel like preaching man just so I want to just something I really believe God gave us this morning amen I want to preach on Amazing Grace through forgiveness Amazing Grace through forgiveness and I I'm G to have to preach like a shotgun to get done but uh we can do it if uh if God helps us amen Let's uh we just want to tell you just a few things about our trip uh it was really wonderful and you know I tell you if I was encouraging you my friends here if you want to be involved in the family of God travel DAV these are people that I never seen their face before I never seen them on on the internet I never seen them on WhatsApp I never seen them on Facebook I never spoke to them I never messaged them complete and total strangers and when we got there the fellowship was it was Heavenly it was Heavenly amen it was just amazing man you know I tell you this story and Vick you going be working on the pictures there I tell you this story when we went to the Customs there in El Salvador we had to have a place where we were going of course we're following Pastor Jose so we don't know where we're going we don't know the name of the people we're going we don't know the city we don't know nothing and they look at us like you're going to El Salvador you don't know who you're staying with no you don't know the name of the town no you don't know their house your address no they said you know the world looks at us like the Bible says we'll be peculiar I said you know I had the thought in my mind I shared it with the church after I said you know I could have told them that we had Fellowship together before the foundation of the world that before God spoke us we were all fellowship and having a great time together how in the world you know these people and you don't know the well I don't know their Earthly face but I remember their Heavenly face amen it's just amazing amen and that's just how the whole weekend was we're just going to show you I think there's about 10 pictures maybe this is a picture of every pastor we preach for except one one is not here one wasn't here the night we took these pictures the picture on uh the the the brother the pastor on the far right was my interpreter so he was from Nicaragua so we didn't preach in his church um and then the preacher in the dad Center in the white shirt was from Gualala and they were the two brothers that begged us to go there the next time or tremendously asked us to he actually got some of the pastors together before we left and said you must come next time to Guatemala from here amen but all the other ministers there we we pastor preached for we preached in four churches um and it was really beautiful you know almost all but one a little bit uh no matter which church we were in everybody come almost without fail other than one church was a little bit more reserved so this is the first pastor we preach for this is up in a volcano the whole country is mountains this is an old volcano where it blew the top out of the mountain mountain and now there is a sulfur Lake and we went there we preached there we got there late late Tuesday we got there 2 3:00 we got in our bedroom probably 4:30 in the morning and and uh we preached for him Wednesday night and you know something I just you can turn to the next picture Vicki when we got there late late in the morning the pastor had woke up to come and pick us up because Jose stayed with his family in another C or another town his brother had brought him and the pastor and his wife no we've never seen them before we've never spoken to them they gave us their master bedroom with an attached bed bathroom with air conditioner and they slept in a house that wasn't finished for one week that we were there when we left their little girl was talking to their dad in Spanish and he said why are these English people leaving he said Dad can't you just give them the house can't you just give them the house so oh we missed so just go back back to the other Church um sorry just back one so that was the first church we preached on a Wednesday night um most every service had probably between 150 and 250 people like this so Wednesday night there was 150 people there amen so we could go to the next one and also another thing that happened after every service they fed everybody outside everybody so this is the pastor that uh is actually ping the church that Pastor Jose started in El Salvador um and this was where the the reunion was and the convention and that little girl was the one that asked her dad if he couldn't just give us the house we could just stay with them amen and this was a lookout mountain so we can go the next service so this is me coming up to preach in the front of his church he's just turning it over to us and we go to the next one there it's just a couple pictures of the Believers they would pack them in there you know it was 100 degrees 100 degrees every day the hottest we' seen on the van thermostat was 102 102 it was just roasting and we actually almost lost our voice because matter of fact The Interpreter completely lost his voice because the air was so hot when we come out of the airport it hit you like a cement truck it looked like you'd stepped over front of a train it was just I mean literally it was just like they opened those double doors and was like bre it was very hot very very hot there this is uh this this still the second Church they actually catered the meal in and this blessed my heart they they really took care of the people they they really took care of they they actually fed the people before they fed the ministers I love that I love that with all my heart amen um we'll just keep going so This Is Us on that same mountain in the lake we don't have to spend this is the uh this is the uh uh third church we preached in and uh we want to take our girls or any young they had a ton of young people they had uh seven eight kids seven kids seven kidss five girls all my girls age they were just a blast and a couple of these people we had to almost carry out on this is a glass platform so their mother had never been on it their son actually went and physically um nicely brought her out with her eyes closed in fear uh but every road is kirked and every road is is like everywhere you look is just just mountains as far as the I can see because there's mountains higher than other mountains and so this was uh this is pretty much all one family except maybe the brother sitting in the middle there in front of me and uh we just it was just an amazing time like literally we went to this Lookout on Saturday and we left on Monday they had already made coffee cups with the picture on it is us as part of the family we are their family yeah so uh just a tremendous tremendous Love Actually the daughter there on the uh on my side the daughter was the daughter of the pastor that had just died former Pastor that had just died uh very uh previous like couple years during Co or something I don't think it was CO as much as I think he had had U I think he had lung issues he had always had lung issues that and that I tell you this this is encouragement every single one of the p pastor's family are still in that church they have a new pastor but the sons are the song leaders Wednesday and Sunday morning there's two sons they they rotate and the kids are there the mom's there everybody's there they didn't HIC up nothing amen that was beautiful this is their church and just an amazing time this brother here you see with the the not too much hair they took us out to a fancy fancy restaurant and and his son and actually I'm I'm wearing his son's tie his wife gave Lan a blow or dress or something and but the one day it wasn't even the last day we seen them the one day they came to say goodbye and it took like a half an hour he would say goodbye and give me a hug and we talk he give me another hug say goodbye and another hug say goodbye and that's just the way it was it's just the way even the pastor of the second church he came and took a family picture and he said Dale I'm not good on Gabby just like many of the People sisters included when they would say final goodbye they would be almost to tears when that true so we preached here on uh brother Jose preached here on Wednesday we preach on the following Friday and uh and I think there's another picture back is that it that's it okay amen amen let's stand and we'll just look in our scriptures and thank you girls and you know we'll we'll talk about our trip more but it was amazing and and they loved the word of God and and we're all part of the family and we all came from him we spoke on a lot of the Mysteries and and we had a really good time it was uh it was a challenge to uh you know know when you're ministering wonderful things it's easy to get excited but it's very hard for The Interpreter one time I ran down the alley way and you know we were talking about we're Christ and different The Interpreter he's just lost I mean amen I told the congregation I said man I sure wish I could preach in Spanish I could really Let Her Fly but uh amen let's turn to Revelations 10:7 and we'll just uh look into our thought here it is wonderful to be home and it was probably the biggest thing I missed I didn't miss the cold but I did miss a hot shower even though it's extremely hot there you shower the temperature it comes out of the tap and so it's not a long shower it's not enjoyable although it is refreshing so but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God shall be finished as he has declared it to his servants the prophets Lord Jesus you know what you've laid on my heart this morning and Lord we pray that you we can convey this thought you can convey this thought through your servant to your people Lord Jesus and Lord I pray that you'll change me to Perfection Lord Jesus and change us all into the image that you've seen Lord Jesus before the foundation of the world and we give you the glory and the praise for it we pray again to bless the people Lord Jesus it's good to be home and we just thank you for this great opportunity to minister your word your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning we want to look in one of the Mysteries you know we believe that the Mysteries are unfolded and the Bible became a new book and and we could read between the letters you know our Prophet said that that uh you couldn't study Revelation although study is good and you couldn't even take uh I turned it on I thought I did uh or you couldn't even learn uh Revelation by going back to the uh Greek although that is good too and we do that too we do both but the greatest ability is when Christ reveals the the the scriptures and drops it down amen what he did in this day to ourselves I changed it either way so uh we just uh uh and that's what we have in our day the Bible's became a brand new book and the Bible every letter and every line the doveet tales and we know that every letter in the Bible is the seed of God and and literally before we get out of here we become his his wife and we will be impregnated with the word before we go to the to the the marriage supper amen and that's the state we have to be in you know the the prophet taught us this he talked about the three room Tabernacle and he saidou know the outer courts was for the unbeliever and the inner courts was the makeb believer and he said until you go into the holy of holies you're not even a Christian yet but when you go into the holy of holies and that Veil drops between behind you and it's you and Jehovah God and you have Fellowship together amen you'll never come out of that place to S amen you'll walk different you'll talk different you'll look different amen everything about you'll be different and we we want to look into Amazing Grace through forgiveness and we see this here in Genesis 4813 to or 13-19 and we see here that Joseph brings his his sons to be blessed before Jacob dies and we're gonna preach fast because I just want you to catch the thought and you know Joseph was a type of Jesus and and and he typed everything in the natural to Jesus a perfect type he was sold into slavery he was left for dead he was disowned by his own Brotherhood and all these types was here's Jesus In the Flesh and we'll see in the mysteries of the Bible that Christ always shows himself multiple times he'll show us here in Genesis here and all the way through the Bible and he shows us and when we get to the end in Revelations you're never going to have an excuse that I never seen you because he shows you in Genesis he shows you in numbers he shows you in Exodus and it's here and here and here and here and you can just go through the scriptures and it's Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus hallelujah amen and we see here Joseph being a perfect type he was still a human and he had a concept of what God would work like and that's what gets in our way all the time is we have a perception of what this service will be or that I was telling brother Carson come over the other day and I said one of the most amazing things with the ministry is I don't have a clue what it'll be like when I start I don't have a clue what the service is going to be like cuz I ain't the service God is I don't know how God will be amen that's that's the greatest mystery amen but here Joseph he's bringing his sons and he bringing his Elder son and his youngest son and he had an agenda because he knew how God should work Hallelujah God helped me and God help you not to be like that the prophet said the greatest gift of all was surrender just just let God be God and you be his children amen amen you know a little child well maybe he does but you know a little child you know he just lets the parents be the parents and they're the children especially if they're very young amen and we see here that Joseph brought the older son that he would be on the side of Jacob's right hand and for the blessing that was the greatest blessing is these are all types the old testament's types types and shadows of Grace amen and he brought the younger son and he would be on Jacob's left hand and he would get a secondary blessing and our Prophet I'm going to look slow down and read some quotes but you know Jacob said Jacob when he prayed he crossed his hands and Joseph lost his mind when he's seen what God had done and he said father father no no you've made a mistake and Jacob answered Joseph and he said God there some of us needs to hear that this morning God made me do it there's some things that God will make you do you won't have no saying amen he'll just he'll just make you know the cross in the arms type Calvary and the prophet mentions that about it was a cross of the calvary was amazing grace to the Gentile bride and the Jew and it took the Gentiles from the law the curse of the law he gives the scriptures in Galatians forward he took the the the curse of the Gentiles and see that how that perfect type was Joseph came to his own and his brothers rejected him and Jesus came to his own and they and and the Jews rejected him and Jesus crossed his arms and he grafted Us in to be his his bride amazing grace Amazing Grace but we we want to we want we don't want to let go of how Joseph rejected that Grace he had a thought how it would be amen and he rejected that here here the prophet says in the revelation of Jesus Christ that Joseph by by type the the marriage of the Gentile bride amen just want to find the one I want here he changed the birth right to us the younger son because the younger son typed the Gentile bride you you see the types of Joseph all the way through see Jesus came to his own and they refused him and he took us a gentile wife Joseph came to his own and his Brethren refused him and he also took a gentile wife amen moved to sold in slavery went to another country took a gentile wife had two sons amen that God raised up and it was just beautiful how these things uh I just seeing what our Prophet said here he mentions this multiple times Christ redeemed us from the curse we want to look into this maybe we can pull this scripture up uh Galatians 3:13 now 13- 14 and Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us because we were Gentiles as for it is written cursed is every man that hangs on a tree but blessed that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith and that was all based on Jacob Crossing his arms to the two sons amazing grace Amazing Grace and we want to look at all these examples of grace through forgiveness here we look at Exodus we're going to fast forward you maybe pull this up Amy Exodus 13 21 and 22 and we see here Israel coming out of Egypt another case of Amazing Grace and we see you know that that in the day of the seventh angel when when he has come down the m mysteries of God are finished and we're going to look at how he came down all the way through the scriptures and almost every multiple times he came different ways but multiple times when he came down he came in the cloud he came in the body of the cloud and that's what we're going to look at today in the body of the cloud and here Exodus 13 we know when the children of Israel come out he said the Lord went before them in the pillar of the cloud by day and here the prophet mentions this she said you know you want to see what the power of God was like in that cloud think of Israel he said every doctor that's alive today would like to look into Moses uh Hospital book Hospital book How The Children of Israel when that cloud was before them before day they could never need a pair of clothes there was no clothing stores the shoe stores all went broke because the Sho mans weren't needed it was the atmosphere around them you know our Prophet said that if you had one Speck of Jehovah that's not a whole lot if you have one spec of Jehovah you have enough power in you to speak a world and go live on it amen that's everyone here that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you say brother Dale that's a bit of a Str that's not a stretch at all you can build a world around you an environment amen you you look at you know we we are so we have to be so careful you know we think sometimes we're so hard done by you know I I and I I'm not lifting them up I'm just showing you where we're at Al Salvador where we were the average income was $112 a day that's was 410 a liter a gallon us when I preached on Friday night there was single sisters that came with her husbands that drove two hours one way Friday night guys is 410 a liter and she made 12 bucks that day you think you had a hard economy you need to look around and you I'm not just that they 80% of Al Salvador goes to the states to work and so if they buy if the young people in the house go to buy a house it's 100,000 US dollar making 12 bucks a day try to figure that out in the bank you're going to have to they have a mighty sharp pencil you know we never had a single person beg us for a dime when we were there and they all gave us gifts and Gifts of money and service and sent us presents home and fed us and we think oh the economy changed here uhhuh you know wherever your heart is your treasure will be amen wherever your heart is they they wouldn't think you know you know was something that was different there you know and and it took some getting used to I'll have to admit because it was extremely hot extremely hot none of the churches were air conditioned they sat the time of the church when you're supposed to come and pray and read your Bible so we came to church sat for 30 40 minutes before the song play even come up I had sweat running down every part of my body I thought the service should be closed and it hadn't even got warmed up yet amen see we we got blind we think oh oh god oh I going to make it God yeah but with the presence of God all things are possible here in Moses day when the cloud came down and led the children of Israel he he said I am am the Lord that Health thy diseases the our Prophet your Prophet said this he said can you imagine in two million people how many babies were born they didn't build a hospital and you think God can't heal you you think God can't give you a baby you think God can't give you new shoes you don't think God can give you a brother that'll give you a tie that it's making tell you it's a humbling experience when people come up with poverty and start giving you gifts you feel like hiding when you know what they're going through to give you that uhhuh uhuh God help us amen amen it's all about Christ amen amen you we know the story when the Israelite when they they went across the desert not one feeble among them that you know the had the oh no not all of them were Israel not all of them went in of course not you know there was make Believers in their group but it was the same Jehovah God that was in their presence he took care of everything they needed and he's taking care of the Bride around the world everything they need amen amazing time when the cloud came down and they never had no sick no baby problem S no no clothing problems no shoe problems no leadership problems no weather problems no grocery store problems nobody got heartburn on the Heavenly Mana amazing amazing and we have the same thing here today if we just surrender to it amen amen this exact same Cloud came down in our day amen we see in in Elijah's day when when uh he had cursed the rain and the do and and all these things in the the time of Jezebel and and the the wicked King amen and he had said he told the king he went to the king and he said now it's going to rain amen and then he went and asked God to Make It Rain I I you know I've preached this before you know when you come into Christ and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are Christ today that's that's a direct quote from the prophet the exact same kind of Glory that came out of God he said today we call it our theophany our theophany and the logos are exactly the same exactly the same he said we call it AR theophany today but the Loos of God there's just some things you don't have to begag for amen God said to Moses why cry unto me just speak and go forward amen and so here here here Elijah had so much faith that he goes and tells the king well he tells them first it's not going to rain they won't even be due God feeds him in the the brook with the Ravens and then he goes back to the king and he said it's going to rain tomorrow he didn't know it was going to rain you say God show no no the Bible says that he went to pray and he said he prayed and he put his legs between his knees that's exactly the how the Bible says he said he put his head between his knees and he had a servant and I love this part how it dub tals he sent the servant out to see if God was send in the rain how many times seven one for every Church age he sent a out for every Church age to see if God was coming down in the cloud every time but then in the seventh day he seen a little tiny cloud of God coming down about the size of a half and you'll see every time in the scriptures when it talked about the arm when Christ SATs at the right arm of the father it was always Authority and power wasn't two people it was a position it was Authority and power and we see the right hand of Christ coming down and the cloud representing the Hand five-fold Ministry the five forward Ministry was Grace to the people on that word which was a cloud that brought physical rain which is the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen ain't that amazing and Christ hid all this from the wise and prudent and revealed it onto his little wife the hidden secrets that you could read between the lines amen amazing amazing grace through forgiveness here we see Solomon after David died died and Solomon builds the temple amen and he's dedicating the temple and he comes down in First Kings 810 and 11 and what comes down in the Tabernacle when he's dedicating the Tabernacle and the thing and this is before the perfect sacrifice had come Christ hadn't been born yet amen this was the power was the sacrifice of lambs and goats a type of the perfect sacrifice that was coming and the Bible says that the cloud came in the Tabernacle and the presence and the power of the cloud was so powerful that the priest couldn't stand and Minister I would to God that happen every place I go that the presence and the power of God and the wow that it would just be a fog around I tell you what when you come into that holy holies you're not you don't know that anybody else exists but God Amen oh we we we have to get there we must get there to go in a Rapture our Prophet compared the Tabernacle to the three room house compared it 14 times to a three room house and he said when when you have your kitchen you're in your cour ship stage when you're of your living room you're in your fiance State engaged state but when you go into the bedroom that's where life happens he said until the bedroom you're not even converted because there's not a true relation there's no commitment there's no relation long term man the same as 14 times he compared that three room house to the Tabernacle in the wilderness amazing amazing power all these times that the cloud came down was Grace and we want to look at how amazing grace through forgiveness you know it wasn't easy Christ came himself to pay the price you want to look at another example of Amazing Grace look at the New Testament Luke 22 and Mark 14 we'll look at 2241 and 44 and I'm going to read this here's Jesus Jehovah down to pay the price for my sins God himself come to die on the cross amen but in the flesh he didn't want to die we're not born to die I mean we're born to die but we're we're born that we don't want to die everything that's alive will fight to live everything that's breathing will fight to live and here Jesus comes and he prays in verse uh let's look L Luke 22:41 he says and he was withdraw from the disciples about a stonecast and he kneeled down and he prayed and he said father if thou were willing remove this cup from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done you know what that was amazing grace that was amazing grace that was a choice that was a choice the Bible says that he could have called 10 Legions of angels to destroy me and set him free it was a CH and God's gave every one of us a choice even though we came from him you still have to die out in this flesh amen and here in 43 it says and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven and strengthen him and 44 and it being in agony him being in agony prayed more earnestly the second time and it was as sweat drops of blood falling to the ground amen Amazing Grace by a choice the Christ would have to pay the ultimate sacrifice because see this was God's law that because of sin in the garden death had to come it was only the blood that would pay the price amen we see we see this in Mark also Mark 14 and 39 and I want to read this also just to to uh show you how it it's said different and both places he he prayed twice and he and he went a little farther from the disciples and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible that the hour might pass from him that was the first time of Grace a decision Mark 14:35 amen this was a process that Jesus was working into that he was given his life he knew he was born for that but it was still a decision and 36 and he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me that's pretty plain but nevertheless not what I will but what thou Wilt that's the second time Jesus prayed Amazing Grace it was amazing grace for us man it was amazing grace for the whole world the sadly the world won't accept it most of the world won't accept it the disciples were sleeping in verse 37 and a 38 he said watch ye therefore and pray now this is Jesus commission to you and verse 38 say watch ye there and pray lest you enter into temptation for the spirit truly is ready but your flesh it's weak amen your flesh is weak God help us God help me God help me to have our flesh in control in Ezekiel 9:4 here the death angel went through the city and this and the Death Angel put a mark on them on their forehead that sighed and cried for the Abominations committed in the city amen the concern of the people around them amazing amazing love when we look into this deeper into switching some now from grace to forgiveness how is it possible to have Amazing Grace it's not without forgiveness even though that I was ugly in sin God loved us before he before we were beautiful amen we were running from God and he still loved us God help us here in Matthew 614 and 15 and this is right before God is teaching the disciples the Lord's Prayer and so you know the disciples that came to us and he came to them and said Lord teach us how to pray and then in Matthew 14 and I I might have this paraphrase some just for shorter he says for if ye forgive men your trespass passes your heavenly father will also forgive you but 15 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive you your trespasses and here's God showing us how he forgave us and redeemed us back to himself but will we do the same for the people that we are in contact with and fellowship with I'm going to tell you some amazing stories here we're going to look into Joseph first and but John 1 says John 1: 14:20 says if any man say unto God say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth his not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth also his brother now we're peculiar people and we're never going to be the same we're never going to see a car or a bus the same way but God still expects us to have Grace and forgiveness those things we see in the Bible here in Philippians 48 and I'm just going fast because I want to get to the Forgiveness part he said finally my brother whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest and whatsoever things are just and whosoever things are pure and whatsoever things are Lov whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things you know it was it it it it it it affected us it affected me being God it did it affected me being gone knowing their situation and what they Liv through you know we don't know what another brother lives through unless you walk in their sand many of you see people and you take for granted that they got everything all packed together and you don't have a clue what they just went through we're all in different situations some of youve lost loved ones or sickness long-term sickness accidents with no fault of your own or different things and we need to be like Christ and have a compassion that touches that infirmity for healing from Jehovah you know I going tell you something what when we went to the El Salvador the first day we went to wear the head the Civil War and Pastor Jose told me stories that I'll guarantee you you don't know their country was in full-fledged War amazing enough when they were in war Canada and Russia were two of the biggest countries that supported the people that'll shock you they were on the same side and America supported the government and brother Jose said he said I was definitely on the people side he said five people owned the whole country of El Salvador and all the rest of us were slaves we got 50 cents a day whether we needed it or not and he said the people finally snapped and they took up arms and they started shooting everybody that moved that was government brother Jose told me himself he said Dale I remember remember jumping into the side road ditch concrete ditch and them shooting right over top of me and me laying there hearing the thud of the bullets hitting people like when we go bunny hunting wow you wonder how people carry something he lived through that he came to Canada from that pastors that we stayed with said I moved the house front right out to the line because the gangs would come and knock on the front door and beg for money but they still went to church and worship they went to church during Co when it was against the law to go to church you need to hear me church and they got stopped in traffic stops by the police with machine guns and the police said where are you going they said we're going to the house of God to worship and he said while you're there pray for us hello hello hello wherever your heart is that's where you'll be that's where you'll be wherever your heart is against the law amen now there was other pastors there was pastors that told us they were out in their street talk to the neighbors and they you know the police come by and they said if we see you out of your house we'll come take you to jail but you see you know when you look at what somebody else has went through maybe God give you a lot easier cup to carry amen we see Joseph here in the Bible we already mentioned to him he was rejected by his Brethren and all those terrible things happened to him why it was all about Amazing Grace and forgiveness because the Bible clearly shows that Joseph was hated by his flesh flesh Brothers for no reason of his own he was just born very and he could have never forgave his brothers until God sent him to prison and he was able to learn how to forgive God sent him to 13 years of prison a no fault of his own and Joseph walked out everything that was behind him was forgotten because you say how do I know that oh it's very clear because he would have killed his brothers when they got there if he had not and that's exactly what they thought he would do uhuh huh and God knew exactly the time it took to put him away that he would have the ability I pray to God we don't have to get that far what we just I don't care what anybody done to you ever period it ain't worth missing heaven for I don't care if they cut off your right arm killed your character destroyed you said you were really bad it makes no difference we're talking about eternal life or forgiveness period and you see the character that Joseph W when he went come out of prison not only did he forgive his brothers but when they came and got gra you know what he put in their bags predestination he placed all their money but then in his fa favorite brother's bag the youngest brother that was a direct brother to Joseph he placed in his King's Cup that's predestination he placed the seed in your heart that you would be able to see the mysteries of the Bible when the whole world is walking blindly in the ditch amen you know one of the messages I preached on and I I don't I don't tell you this God knows my hard and I don't even expect you to understand this but I had pastors come up you said Brother D never heard the message preach like you preached it wasn't me I had another Pastor come up and and Len was there probably every time nothing to do with Brother D I failed grade one and was in grade two you getting the picture I took speech therapy in grade two because I didn't know how to speak English that's the truth God has the way it's just it's just God Amen I had a brother we preached the second service with and I believe you were there he said Dale he said we've had people from Mexico we've had people from South America and we've had people from America he said we never had people open up the Bible like you did it wasn't mean we have Propet we have a revelation of the word and we we're coming to the stage that we're his wife and we're going home to a supper a great party and we're looking different because we're impregnated with the Revelation that the the seven Angel brought down and the Mysteries are revealed I told the church you know like we're like this you know I I was mentioned to brother Carson said you know when Ruth is a perfect type to the bride and Bo perfect PR B you know I I I certain to say we preached on the Sev the perfect of sevs brother Bram said the some of the greatest Mysteries are represented in seven and seven also represents going home I have those quotes right in my Pulpit here amen we're not preaching on that but you see Boaz was Christ and he gave Ruth six measures of barel and she took her apron and she pulled it up in her belly and she Andy is and the B says that every word a SE oh buddy that's crazy good amen see in this St before you go home you're going to know exactly who you're married to you're not going to the the the marriage supper to find out the Mysteries you're not going there yeah I know them all here a prophet said this he said you know preachers will put off all the every all those Mysteries and everything that we're going to find out in the the marriage supper you know what he said to that said you won't need them there you won't need them there you're already there amen hallelujah I want to give you a last quote and this really blew me away and I shared this with brother Carson and I I I hope this affects you because there's one sitting here that needs to deal with Grace and forgiveness there is the ones in this building that need to deal with amazing Gra and forgiveness brother Dale was one of them see it's a process God works on us all Nelson Mandela came from South Africa and it's everything I could read on Google he went to prison because he wanted freedom and equality between you know the prophet said this he said God made man man made slaves not God and anything that I read if you can correct me after I'm free to for correct there anything I could see that Nelson manela did nothing to deserve prison except he wanted the right for everybody to vote and and like we're all brothers and sisters no matter what we look like amen he went to prison for 27 years that's a long time they would have gave him off right till the day they caught him I I seen pictures from Google when they picked him up in the train car in the bar thing and he puts his hands out doubling up his fist said I will not he said I will die before I will give up that we are equal we're all made by God equal I'll die he would have and you know prison was terrible you can't even imagine 27 years I I I I would have rather died amen he was treated terrible in prison but when he come out now this is not on the paragraph that I have here but I asked a pastor to send this to me because I I knew it kind of from memory but I have the facts of his testimony but when he came out those prison Gates 27 years could have you done it I'll tell you what I couldn't I could not you know that P was so powerful that years after the love of his life that Liv let me tell you some of the things that he got I can tell you by memory better than reading it I'd have to find it but you know they got one meal a day they had abusive labor and and all these like prison was terrible it wasn't Canadian prison there was no movie screens and he come out and he won the first election that the black people could vote in a landslide and now that he's president and the leader I had a pastor tell me this story by the way and it just hugely you know Jared said he said I don't know why I sang that song cuz God knew what was coming I never told Jared what I was preaching on man the one time he was President he asked his bodyguards he said I just want to go up town and stroll around up town and they were strolling around and there's restaurants everywhere and he went in a restaurant and there was one man in the restaurant and when he walked in that man began to tremble in the restroom and they sat down at their table they ordered their food now he's the president he has 100 bodyguards and all this stuff and you know in the process of them getting their food Nelson Mandela he he realizes that there's a man over there sitting alone the table he told his SC he said you go over and get that man and you bring him to my table to eat with me and so they did and the man when he came to their table was shaking so bad he needed help to walk to get to the table or just he was just out of control his bodily functions were out of control they had their meal they parted ways and a soldier asked him he said why did you scare that man so much or why was that man scared so much Nelsa Mandela said when I was in prison after they would beat me and we'd have a day of hard labor and I would ask for a glass of water he said that man would come over and urinate on my head no Mandela said these words he because I can't even read it but he said you don't build Nations by torment and cut people's heads off he said the weak can never forget Only the Strong have forgiveness when I heard that I heard that in no Salvador I was just like wow not one of us have lived through that you might have had some people do some bad things about you I know I I've had lots of people say lots of things we've all had people say things about us behind our back it makes no difference it Mak what's that a difference in the scheme of anything amen I've been guilty myself amen Amazing Grace through forgiveness the only way you can taste of Amazing Grace is if you have that kind of forgiveness let's stand hallelujah hallelujah that's Supernatural but our God had that kind of forgiveness he left the Splendor of Heaven knowing exactly what he would have to do amen God help us you know if we we say which we did if we say we came from God and if you come from God you must return to God because God won't be fully complete until you do return to God that's Genesis 1: 128 and if you came from God and you're returning to God you're going to have exactly God's characters and that was forgiveness there is nothing if you you know the Bible says he says fear not the people that can even kill you because they can't take your soul amen so today I know I know today we live in a in a in a free a safe you know that they don't kill you so they kill your character does that change who you are it don't change who you are they can butcher your character but they can never butcher your character with Christ they might in watch this every one of you here somebody might come to me and God help me I would never be a garbage can but they might influence anybody about somebody else but there's one person there's at least one person you can have complete confidence in and that's your daddy so does it really matter because see we're not going to Heaven by what people say about our character or if they kill us or anything else but what about you're going to let Satan build up a root of bitterness and you're going to hold a grudge and it's going to only hurt one person that's the person that you need to hold a mirror in front of it makes no difference I don't make no difference it don't matter if people say I had a hundred wives make makes no difference don't matter what they say about you don't matter if the bullets are all shooting over your back it don't even matter if the bullets hit you because when you get there were you able to forgive them and the only way you can receive Amazing Grace is by amazing forgiveness Hallelujah God help me God help me it's it's my goodness think that you would give up your family your heavenly family it's just not worth most all things that happen are just misunderstandings or or whatever it don't it just don't matter it just don't matter it's never been no matter how rough you've had it in your life no matter how big your trials are travel and in your first travel you'll find out people are going through mountains you know I told you I showed you the pastor of the the kids the pastor of that one church just died her husband died during covid her her sister died six months ago and her father's getting ready to die now she walked in church the first Wednesday night and I just looked at her and I said yeah it's it's not worth it Church whatever's happened in your past just let it go let it go it's good to have a terrible memory I can't even remember what you're talking about it but it happened yet I can't even remember but brother brother Dale didn't shake my I can't even remember but he stepped on I can't even remember better to go to heaven with the less memory one less arm one less eye one less ear and still get there uhhuh we better leave our memory with that ear and that arm and that hand we leave our memory back there too and just go forward amen God help us it's the
