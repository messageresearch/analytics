of our Lord Jesus amen and we're just going to be blessed to have brother Jr Minister for us amen and it's going to be a thrill I encourage you to just just eat the word it'll be wonderful because it won't be his words it'll be his God's words and it'll be just tremendous and man it's just good to be back in fellowship and also you can keep him and his family and prayer he's hoping to bring his

when we picked him up I said welcome home he's been visiting in Jamaica for a while but uh he he made it back home amen we love brother Jr and that just a few announcements before we maybe sing a song honey before we go um they asked us in Ottawa Camp um just how many were going now uh I realized some of you my own kids are staying in a uh you know off the campground and eating off the campground so I mean they probably just you know need to know for I don't know Insurance liability Campground chairs renting chairs whatever so if you're staying on the campground you need to register but if you're staying off the campground it's the only purpose is just for the Tabernacle you know somebody like I know my kids are saying a bed of breakfast or something so so they asked us to get back to them so if you can tell us if you're going to be at the Ottawa camp and also even John dankwas thing if you were being really a part of that you were supposed to register I'm not sure exactly how all the details and that but uh we're gonna be at John dank was on Sunday if you're just going to the service I don't think it's this is a important and also I want to say along that same line to camp in in Saskatchewan that uh the I I actually haven't got it posted but Vanessa has the details and I actually found out from Kelly hillebrand that camp is full but that only means it's full if you're looking for a cabin on the campground or if you want to eat in a cafeteria that only holds 500 people that Camp's not full if you want to go to it to church amen God provided motels and bed and breakfasts and restaurants and so you could go and stay in a bed and breakfast or a restaurant and come to the camp meeting for Cyrus and and uh and I I actually messaged Kelly Hildebrand and told him you know we're many were planning on coming and and it was filled up and he said oh it fills up way early just way early but that just means if you want a cabin or if you want to eat in the cafeteria so I mean if God permits you to go that's I think second week of July the Tabernacle will hold everybody they're not going to send people you know so I mean you could be there and fellowship in the Tabernacle it's just for the meals and all that and so I mean that's something we want to be a part of in the future of me and Mom aren't going this year specifically but we plan to go and and I mean if you got families or kids that go and fellowship with the bride of Christ man get a taste of Heaven here it'll be the greatest thing you've ever had amen and sorry for so many announcements also July 9th July 9th we have Joseph from uh Gerard Samuels Church in Toronto coming to minister and he's an evangelist missionary evangelist missionary I'm not sure which he travels a lot overseas South America brother Gerard is telling me different things that it happened actually brothers Jordan was telling me that his this last missionary trip there was people that wasn't even in the Tabernacle and actually heard the voice over the speakers that were healed to come back and testify until they were healed amen so he said he said so he's going to be with us July 9th and then also uh brother Ben was going to be with us in June and he had something come up in the family and he cannot be with us he was going to be with us on Father's Day and he's looking to reschedule sometime in July or August and I just want to reschedule a good time for each one so if you tell us uh I know our kids are going to Algonquin Park and so Brother Band will come it'll either be late July or August but I don't want to pick a weekend that um people are canoeing amen and uh amen and just just one more announcement is is more a prayer request and I had mentioned this before and I don't mean to take your time but we need to we need to to do this say man is uh we're just praying for God's will in the ministry amen and I personally don't have a Ministry to uh to be popular or I don't I don't have low self-esteem I never did amen I was never affected by peer pressure in high school so I don't mean that arrogant I just mean that's just reality amen but but me and my wife had plants we're going to Jose Garcia's Homeland in December and see his parents then that's the first of December and that's their anniversary means and I we committed to that when he went with us to Uganda and we we really do want to go to Uganda in February we just I don't we just like it there we like the people we love the people but so that was kind of our way of thinking and about a week ago in the period of about one week I had four pastors from the Philippines asked me to come this year and actually the fifth one told me two days ago and you know many people ask you to minister and you just you know you just you're not going but after four or five start asking in a short period and these are not ministers that knew the other ministers they're in completely different Islands they maybe have never connected amen and so we're just praying for for God's will um I I can't even afford to go let alone be gone and so God would God would have to do something it costs a lot to go to the Philippines if I if I win I'd want to go with my wife and and uh it'd be 10 grand just for plane tickets it's just literally maybe more than that but uh but God can do anything and I don't even desire to be there I don't even desire I mean I like I like the Philippines I I mean I don't mean that but you know what I'm saying I'm happy to be here I love the Philippines but if God wants it so I literally had people it's from the south to the north literally as far as the East is from the West in the Philippines in one week and then I had another is it actually an evangelist called me actually our Taxi Driver an evangelist called us this week and you know so the first guy called me or something but when the fourth guy sent it through in about four days we were sitting in the living room I said wow what is God telling us

back home and he said you know I had to do cleaning and around the church and he said I was flat bitter above it just plain bitter because I was too good to run the broom he said now I cleaned the church and it's a worship service it's a worship service see you know you think wow it's just something bacon man just something little like that it just changed the whole atmosphere amen amen let's sing a song Honey is for you Stan amen so we just covet your prayers we're not asking for anything but your prayers son we we don't know what God's will is but uh uh we we just and and I don't even desire to be away from you guys amen so but God knows what he's doing amen and maybe it's just somebody over there that needs to have a worship service when they clean the church amen but uh amen so

you also trusted in whom Christ Hallelujah after that you heard the word of Truth is God see truth is important the words brings truth it is true that deliver us Hallelujah the gospel of your salvation and gospel means good news Hallelujah in whom also after that you believe you were sealed Hallelujah so after you believe God has to seal you what the Holy Spirit of promise praise the Lord you can be seated Hallelujah are you thankful for that ceiling this morning seal God's people are seated Hallelujah you know I have here with me this is an international motor traffic driving permit Hallelujah and on this piece of it's a document and on this document the The Authority has to stamp as a place a stamp on it and that stamp is of authority what about the Holy Ghost hallelujah what about the spiritual Hallelujah when you have this it means you're legal Hallelujah you can drive a motorist and the laws cannot stop you if even they stopping you present this with them it shows that you're illegal glory to God what about the Holy Ghost this morning Hallelujah praise God he has given us the seal Hallelujah that we belong to him the seal means ownership Hallelujah it means eternal security it means guarantee oh praise God when you are a son of God every Son of God God has to give him a seal Hallelujah Jesus Christ when he was walking on the hurt the Bible said in the book of Saint John 6 Hallelujah verse 27. when the Bible said it came to him and ask him a question from whence you'll reach here but early on the Bible said he was across the sea Hallelujah he was across the sea but he fed the multitude and after he fell he fed them they said this is truly the Messiah this is truly the Son of God so the Bible said they wanted to take him hallelujah's Force to become king but Jesus had to move away from their presence and the Bible said he went upon the mountain alone and his disciples were in the boat traveling over the other side of the sea Hallelujah and Jesus he saw what was happening to them in the sea then he stood and started to walk on water Hallelujah praise God so when they said from when she been here because they know that he was on the mountain and they were looking that there was no boat or could he reach here [Laughter] what could he reach here how could he reach a cross little they know that he was the god of the universe he could teleport they could walk on Waters he didn't have to use boats even after you submarine even after he was plain to do to transport from one side from one destination to another it was God he was God In the Flesh but he didn't answer them that question he said Hallelujah and the reason why you're seeing me is because you need Hallelujah you need to be fed again hallelujah what he said live or not for the meat that perish but for the me that Hallelujah that the father will give you that forever lasting life that's the meat that he must labor for what is the meat the myth is to do the will of the father Jesus said to the whom said to the disciples when he was talking Hallelujah he said I have meat to eat when they say come Masters here is the natural meat but Jesus said I am me to eat Hallelujah it is to do the will of him that sent me hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen but then he said to them he said the father said this seed upon the Sun and the seal means ownership the seal means security Hallelujah when God has seen you it means you are his God is protected over you God Hollow is obligated to keep you Hallelujah God is obligated to watch over you God is obligated to guard you Hallelujah because you belong to him Hallelujah he said Hallelujah in Saint John 10. he said none that my heavenly father give it to me shall not be lost he said there shall never be perished and the word perish means to destroy and he said no one can pluck them look at it they can never be destroyed and then no one can pluck them out of my father's hand in other words the father cannot lose you Hallelujah so when you belong to God he cannot lose you yes the world is gonna blow you're gonna experience some wins in your life but you know what the father is holding you they cannot lose you Hallelujah he's holding you though the wind's just blowing he cannot lose you no the shy has come upon you they cannot destroy you Hallelujah because the father I seal you oh Jesus am I preaching to somebody this morning am I helping somebody to understand the purpose of being sealed Hallelujah and when you're seen with God it means the fact action is upon you nature knows that [Applause] Hallelujah can I go a little bit further not just nature knows it but the devil knows it [Applause] [Music] of God upon you two things Hallelujah when the Sealy of God is upon you it means God knows who you are and also that the devil knows who you are because he's watching the seal [Applause] Hallelujah praise God so no matter where you go the devil knows that heard that you belong to God Hallelujah he knows who we are you thankful this morning that the devil knows who you are but the question is do you know who you are [Applause] Hallelujah God knows who you are and the devil knows who we are but you must know who you are Hallelujah praise God and once the devil did know who God is he knows who Jesus is hallelujah because there was a seal upon the father upon him that's why the devil said if no be the son of God God's command these tongues to be made bread Hallelujah praise God and the devil try to use the word Hallelujah so the devil will use the word to you as well because he did it to Jesus he has to do it to you again it's the same thing Hallelujah he's trying to use the word to the father Hallelujah but thank God when you are the Seal of when you have that seal of God you are carrying you're carrying the testimony of God you are the secret of God you are carrying the sacred of the father in your heart the Divine will of God Hallelujah and all of the son can know the Divine will of God because the son is in the bosom of the father the son is carrying the heart of God Hallelujah to the secret no wonder why the prophet said the Hallelujah the Bible does set the Lord because it is a secret it means Hallelujah the will the Divine will of the father she's carrying that Divine will of the father and the prophet said she knows hallelujah what to be done with that will that promise Jesus didn't know what Hallelujah Jesus didn't have to pray to the father said should I command these tongues to be made right Hallelujah glory to God oh praise God Jesus did not have to ask the father Hallelujah should I should I Cross My stones that he will give his Angel charge over thee no Hallelujah when you are carrying that seal of God that sacred of God you knows what God wants to be done with his word hallelujah you become the righteousness of God Hallelujah you become the mind you have the mind of the father when the Bible said he knows here 4 6 my people destroy because of lack of knowledge that knowledge wasn't speaking about head knowledge now come on now that was speaking about the Revelation in your soul the revelation of the father in your soul Hallelujah glory to God and God's people are carrying it because they are carrying the Sea of God and the Seal of God brings Hallelujah the Divine will of the father to them Hallelujah nature knows that that's why brother Paul said nature is waiting on you brother Paul never said that nature is waiting on the father he said he's waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God oh praise God hallelujah nature is waiting on us for the manifestation of God hallelujah don't wonder why the Bible said Oh Glory to God hallelujah when the Bible said you are glorified foreign to whom he justified he glorified Hallelujah and more Transfiguration we saw three things happening Hallelujah we saw the resurrection we saw a translation Hallelujah Moses types the resurrection Hallelujah the dead and the resurrection Elijah types the translation and Jesus types the glorified Hallelujah when he rose from the dead he rose with glorified body Hallelujah thus I was able to walk through the walls Hallelujah and appear before his disciples and they thought that he was a ghost Islam ghost proof give me some meat to heat Hallelujah listen you know what time must come here put your hands in my side Hallelujah so it's the same thing with the wife of Christ she's going to have us a glorified body Hallelujah can I preach to somebody this morning Hallelujah when the Bible said in Revelation 19 verse 11 and I saw heaven open up armies of God come and came and white horse those who are the glorified saints that went up Hallelujah coming back to fight the Armageddon War hallelujah praise God can I tell you this morning Hallelujah those purses were an immortal persons no it was two days ago I was talking to a young girl you know she's about 12 years old and she said to me I perceive that you are a preacher just like that she said I can ask you some question I said oh sure no problem you believe in a Rapture I said yes you believe in the 144 000. I said yes she said we think is 144 000. I said man a person believe that you know different religions have their different beliefs some believe that the whole entire 44 000 is the this some believe that it is the Jews right but I said I don't believe it is the Jews when you go back to Revelation 7 the Bible is an oath of every tribe there were seal twelve thousand so the original 44 000 are Israelites Israelites because the Bible said they were seal out of the tribe of Benjamin out of the tribe of God under the tribe of Manasseh Ephraim twelve thousand and the word of God said not all Jews are Jews and I said if you go back to the Book of Esther yes it was too much but I have to nail this it Hallelujah in the Book of Esther the bombs are because of fear the people become Jews those are fair the become Jews that's why I've been a person not all Jews or juice not all Israelites are Israelites praise God I thank God for the word today Hallelujah we have the word hallelujah no Hermits and you know what word we have is the glorify word his people are glorified Hallelujah the Bible said in the Book of Genesis 38. here was Jude and Tamar you know the story but Judah was to give tomorrow his last son Hallelujah praise God but Judah never keep his promise he break his promise oh God hallelujah do the types God he types Christ Hallelujah because God said God made a promise that out of Judah Hallelujah this shall come forth a lion they said the golden sector when when Jacob was on his dead belt dead bed he said the golden scepter will not depart out of Judah Hallelujah you know that scepter and Authority it represents the power of God Hallelujah and that power of God is living his people today Authority is living in his people today woman as always and will always types the church woman always types the church so tomorrow was a type of the church Hallelujah and here she was Hallelujah and the Bible said she was told that her father-in-law has gone up to timna and the Bible said she took off Earth with a garment Hallelujah she took it off you know that they have been identified because of their garment so is the wife today these are not our garments hallelujah our garments is the Holy Ghost hallelujah we're identify with our garments which is a Holy Ghost and the Bible says she took off or with a garment and she put on the Garment upon a harlot and she went in the world and when Judah saw her Judah desire to come in with her but she said what will you give me Judah said I will give you a kid somehow I said no Hallelujah the kid is going to take too long you know give me something that you have now and your possession hallelujah what Judah had was a staff the staff represent Hallelujah Authority the staff hear what I said it represents Authority what Judah had was braced it the Bible called it bracelet but in other translation it means Court it was used to bind the shape which represent a types of Love protection because when you're buying the ship you're protecting them especially if you have a sheep that is always trained away someday you gotta bind them to protect them from danger and the stop was also used to trace away wild base Hallelujah the Bible said Oh Glory to God and he gave me he gave her his ring which is his Signet Hallelujah which that ring represents Hallelujah ownership I am the owner of this land I am the holder for everything Hallelujah in Judah so each time he would stomp it as his authority his mark those were the three most important thing Hallelujah that Judah had in his possession and yet still he will he had to let it go so somebody didn't know come on what are you saying brother Hallelujah I believe God creates such an anointing not to let it go tomorrow was anointed that she asked for these three things the wife is Anointed to ask for the important things Hallelujah of God Elijah was an anointed he said you know what I need a double portion of your spirit Hallelujah Oh Glory to God we know what is important Hallelujah and we are asking for the important things Oh Glory to God Hallelujah foreign Hallelujah you know what when Tama had it in her possession she had it nobody could tell that she had it the ring which means security you're being safe what are you talking about when Nehemiah was there in Babylon Nehemiah said to the king Hallelujah send me back send me back Hallelujah to Jerusalem because my father's house are destroyed Nehemiah was anointed I tell you saints of God Nehemiah know exactly what to ask for when you were anointed you know exactly what to ask your father for you know exactly what to
