[42:34] [Music]
[42:39] me
[42:43] [Music]
[42:55] the
[43:00] [Music]
[43:11] there's no place rather
[43:25] Shel
[43:30] I I counted a a privilege and an honor
[43:33] to to be with you all
[43:34] [Music]
[43:36] today um you
[43:41] know when I say that you know like you
[43:44] know people say things and they say it
[43:46] because they're supposed to say it you
[43:48] know it's kind of
[43:50] expected but I mean
[43:52] it there's there to be among God's
[43:57] people is just one of the greatest
[43:59] places that we can be and um you know
[44:04] there's there's no big eyes and and
[44:06] little 's or or anything like that we're
[44:08] all in this together and uh it is my
[44:12] privilege to be
[44:14] here it's an honor to stand before you
[44:19] today and
[44:21] um I just want to take a little thought
[44:24] today and uh I pray that you'll bear
[44:27] with me on it I I I spent a lot of time
[44:30] on on on this
[44:32] message and then I was re reading
[44:34] through my notes last night and I
[44:36] realized I could probably say everything
[44:37] I want to say in about five
[44:41] minutes so that made me a little
[44:43] nervous because when you spend hours and
[44:46] hours working on something only to find
[44:48] out that you only have couple minutes
[44:50] worth of of things to
[44:53] say that that tends to make a a a
[44:56] minister just a little
[44:58] nervous so you bear with me and um I'm
[45:02] sure that the Lord has good things in
[45:05] store for
[45:07] us um if you'll turn with me in the word
[45:10] of God to the Book of John the Gospel of
[45:14] John chapter
[45:19] 17 and just say Amen when you're there
[45:22] 17:14 we're just going to read a couple
[45:24] of
[45:24] scriptures
[45:28] amen John
[45:31] 17:14 the word of the
[45:33] Lord I have given them my Thy word and
[45:38] the world has hated
[45:40] them because they are not of the
[45:44] world even as I am not of the world so
[45:49] catch catch
[45:50] that we didn't come from here this is
[45:54] not our home
[45:56] the same place that Jesus came from is
[45:59] the same place that we come from amen
[46:02] and he says I pray not that that that
[46:05] you should take them out of the world
[46:07] but that you should keep them from Evil
[46:09] and so he knew what we would face what
[46:12] we would
[46:13] endure and then he says it again just to
[46:17] drive the point home for us they are not
[46:19] of the world even as I am not of the
[46:23] world Amen let's bow our heads together
[46:25] one more time gracious Lord we're so
[46:28] grateful to to be in your house and
[46:31] we're just so blessed by your presence
[46:35] already from the the songs of your
[46:38] omnipotent unfailing Grace the the love
[46:42] that you have for us we're just washed
[46:45] in it we we bask in your love and in
[46:48] your mercy and in your grace who are you
[46:51] who are we that you our King should die
[46:54] for us it's un
[46:56] unfathomable and we thank you Lord and
[47:00] as we we turn to your word father I just
[47:02] pray that you would help me to get out
[47:05] of the way and that your people would
[47:08] would be blessed beyond measure as
[47:10] blessed as I am to be here I pray that
[47:13] they are blessed in Jesus Christ's name
[47:15] we ask it amen amen you all can have
[47:19] your your seats this
[47:21] morning and um I have I have a lot of
[47:24] scriptures
[47:26] uh this morning to read and I I won't
[47:29] expect you all to turn to them or
[47:30] anything like that but um so just just
[47:34] kind of warn you a little bit I'm going
[47:36] to go to the Book of Joshua and read
[47:39] another scripture
[47:41] here in just a
[47:43] moment but before I do I want to
[47:46] capitalize on this last line in
[47:50] John Jesus said sanctify them through
[47:55] thy truth
[47:56] and thy word is
[48:00] true in the Book of Joshua in chapter
[48:03] 3 it says Joshua Rose early in the
[48:07] morning and they removed from chatim and
[48:10] came to Jordan he and all the children
[48:13] of Israel and lodged there before they
[48:16] passed over and it came to pass after
[48:19] three days three days that the officers
[48:22] went through the host and they commanded
[48:24] the people saying when you see the Ark
[48:27] of the Covenant of the Lord which is the
[48:29] word of
[48:31] God when you see the Ark of the Covenant
[48:33] of the Lord your God and the priest of
[48:36] the Levites bearing it then you shall
[48:38] remove from your place and you shall go
[48:41] after it whenever the word is
[48:44] moving we have to go after it
[48:48] amen he goes on and just he says yet
[48:51] there shall be a space between you and
[48:53] it about 2,000 cubits by measure come
[48:56] not unto near unto it that you may know
[48:58] the way by which you must go for you
[49:02] have not passed this way here to
[49:05] for and we're there we're in this
[49:08] Rapture cycle we've not gone this way
[49:11] before we don't have examples to look
[49:13] back to we're in a in a new thing that
[49:16] God is doing and Joshua said to the
[49:20] people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow
[49:24] the Lord will do wonders among you amen
[49:28] I I I guess before I get started let me
[49:31] just preach my whole sermon and in just
[49:33] a couple minutes and then and then I'll
[49:36] I'll backfill everything with with
[49:39] scriptures um the first point that I'd
[49:42] like to make is that the altar of God
[49:45] the true altar of God is in our hearts
[49:48] within us brother brandom said that amen
[49:51] it's it's not here it's not a physical
[49:54] place it's within our heart
[49:56] Hearts amen secondly that our hearts
[50:01] must be Sanctified and set
[50:04] apart and I'm not I'm not going to
[50:06] preach today some fiery Evangelistic
[50:08] message that you have to you know cast
[50:11] out the sin and you know hold your feet
[50:13] over the fires of hell I'm not when I
[50:15] talk about sanctification this morning
[50:17] I'm talking about being set aside for
[50:19] the purposes of God because we all have
[50:22] things that we deal with we all have
[50:23] things we're encumbered with
[50:25] um faults that we're ashamed of things
[50:28] that we we struggle to
[50:30] overcome I'm not here to to pull you out
[50:35] of that we'll leave that for the
[50:36] Evangelist that comes behind me and and
[50:38] the pastor but I want to talk about
[50:40] setting things aside for God in our
[50:45] heart amen and then the third and last
[50:48] point is that every altar every altar is
[50:52] about
[50:53] sacrifice the altar in our heart is
[50:56] about
[50:57] sacrifice and sacrifice speaks to one
[51:01] thing it is the shedding of blood to
[51:04] reunite us with a god from whom we were
[51:09] alienated because sacrifice is that that
[51:14] that
[51:15] substitution for us for our sins and it
[51:19] was always about redeeming us back to to
[51:22] the Lord it was never about anything
[51:24] else
[51:25] is always closing the gap between us and
[51:30] him so that's my entire
[51:35] sermon so now that we're done maybe we
[51:38] should just stand up and praise the Lord
[51:41] so but I appreciate your attention as we
[51:44] go through some of this and I pray it'll
[51:45] be a blessing to
[51:47] you as we go and like I said you know
[51:50] I'm I'm just a little bit nervous so you
[51:53] you give me just a little bit of Grace
[51:55] and um you know I'm just sitting here
[51:57] thinking you know we're here in this
[51:58] beautiful church and we we've been
[52:02] coming now and visiting for about 10
[52:04] years almost 10 years and I look out and
[52:08] I see your faces and you know some we we
[52:11] grown up a little bit together you know
[52:15] uh gained a little bit of weight here
[52:16] and there lost some hair maybe I got
[52:20] some I gained some hair um but you know
[52:24] we're just I look out and I see your
[52:26] faces
[52:27] and uh I'm blessed I'm blessed I'm
[52:32] blessed to see new faces and old faces
[52:34] to see the children growing up and
[52:36] participating it's just such a wonderful
[52:40] thing and uh we're going to spend ET
[52:43] turn with you together one
[52:45] day
[52:47] amen so to be Sanctified means to be set
[52:51] apart for
[52:54] use
[52:56] to set something from the ordinary
[52:58] day-to-day things and use it for a
[53:01] specific
[53:02] purpose it must be set
[53:05] aside we we when we sanctify something
[53:08] it's it's it's going to be used for a
[53:10] specific purpose that we've designated
[53:12] it for you know you you don't go in and
[53:15] and wash a a a nice crystal glass or or
[53:19] something like that and then you know
[53:21] it's it's all good and clean and then
[53:22] you go out and start you know pouring
[53:24] water to the Hogs with it you know it's
[53:27] it's set aside for a special purpose
[53:30] amen we sanctify our churches we're
[53:33] we're fortunate enough here you know in
[53:35] other countries they're not that we
[53:36] sanctify this this portion of the church
[53:39] for God's use we don't come in here and
[53:41] and we're not eating and talking loudly
[53:44] and fellowshipping and just being
[53:45] disrespectful you know we're we come in
[53:47] and we sit down because this is a a
[53:50] Sanctified set aart place it's for the
[53:53] worship of God it's for the the word to
[53:55] come forth and we're grateful to have it
[53:57] that way and we don't come in here and
[54:00] and uh you know play Bingo like some
[54:02] Churches do we don't come in here and
[54:05] and just have parties and rry this is
[54:07] this is a Sanctified set aart
[54:10] room amen we talk quietly and we we you
[54:15] know respect the place that we're in and
[54:20] so just as I've said we must sanctify
[54:23] our heart as well that that our heart
[54:26] must be set aside and I want to I want
[54:28] to remind you for just a a few moments
[54:31] of how important the heart is because I
[54:34] think one of the most when when people
[54:36] refer to the heart one of the things
[54:38] that I hear the most and I'm reminded of
[54:41] the most and and is that the heart is
[54:44] deceitfully wicked and who can know it
[54:47] and and we always tell that to our
[54:49] children when they're they're dating you
[54:51] know and looking after someone they're
[54:53] like oh I just you know I feel this way
[54:55] towards them and I'm in love and and and
[54:58] it's like just hold on you know we tell
[55:00] them your heart doesn't need to guide
[55:02] you in this necessarily you know let's
[55:05] let's wait and see if those feelings are
[55:07] true and I you know that's the way I've
[55:09] kind of approached but now I I was
[55:11] speaking to the Lord and and you know
[55:14] this this thought came to me but that's
[55:17] not the case when we're filled with the
[55:18] Holy Ghost when we're filled with the
[55:21] Holy Ghost we can trust our heart we can
[55:24] trust it it's not deceitfully Wicked
[55:26] amen it's it's the altar of God and so
[55:30] by the grace of God this morning I want
[55:32] to prove that to you and how important
[55:34] this altar is and why we must set it
[55:37] apart Amen brother brandom said as uh in
[55:40] the re the book of or the sermon
[55:42] Revelations he said here's the true
[55:45] altar of God is in the heart of man so
[55:48] I'm not I'm not just making that up or
[55:51] just not something I thought this this
[55:53] came to me and it's just it's so true
[55:55] true the true altar of God is in the
[55:57] heart of man and you know we might have
[56:00] altar calls and and we might you know
[56:03] people might come up to the front you
[56:04] know I I think the Methodist might have
[56:06] started that you know but there was
[56:08] never that that was never a thing until
[56:10] you know maybe a couple hundred years
[56:12] ago and you know I might stand here or
[56:16] the pastor or the preacher and you know
[56:17] we might have this Focus right here
[56:20] right now but inside your heart is where
[56:23] it's important inside your heart is
[56:26] where our focus should be on this
[56:30] Altar and so I guess if I would title
[56:34] this anything this morning it would be
[56:37] sanctify your altar sanctify your altar
[56:41] because we haven't passed this way here
[56:44] to
[56:45] for we're we look towards heaven
[56:48] expecting a Rapture because we're in the
[56:50] Rapture season and we've seen the sign
[56:52] of the Resurrection the four Runner of
[56:55] his return and and we know beyond the
[56:58] shadow of a doubt that we are in the the
[57:00] resurrection cycle the Rapture cycle
[57:03] that any day we could we could just take
[57:06] a step towards eternity and and we speed
[57:09] up and they slow down and we'll meet
[57:11] just over the
[57:12] doorpost and we have to believe that we
[57:15] have to have faith L we become like the
[57:17] the one said the Lord delays is coming
[57:21] and so they're not watching and waiting
[57:23] and so we have to always have this on
[57:25] our mind always have this in our hearts
[57:27] that we're walking we're walking
[57:29] together somewhere with a purpose amen
[57:32] we're not just walking in this world
[57:34] casually even though God didn't take us
[57:37] out of this world Jesus in fact said
[57:39] don't remove them from the world keep
[57:42] keep them
[57:44] here just keep them from Evil and so
[57:47] we're walking and we always need we need
[57:50] to have this in our mind that we are
[57:51] walking with a purpose with a goal that
[57:54] we are set aside people we're not we're
[57:57] not just here ordinary people that are
[58:00] just floating around you know aimlessly
[58:03] in life you know seeking after material
[58:06] Goods or or things like that that we're
[58:08] here for a called and set aside purpose
[58:12] we're Kings and Priests of
[58:14] God
[58:16] Amen and if I think if there's ever been
[58:19] a time where we should focus on
[58:21] sanctifying ourselves that that time is
[58:25] now and I don't mean that in a way like
[58:27] I said of condemnation or or you know
[58:31] shouting repent repent repent I mean
[58:34] that in this season where we know
[58:37] there's going to be a catching away that
[58:40] we need to lay all of ourselves on the
[58:42] altar in our heart we need to put
[58:45] everything in the right place that our
[58:48] minds are focused on the right things
[58:51] because it's so easy to be consumed with
[58:54] the things of this life you know all of
[58:57] none of us are immune from this world
[58:58] because we we see the news and we we
[59:01] read the papers and we we see the things
[59:04] that are happening in our countries and
[59:05] around the world and we're we're
[59:08] disturbed by it and we we were talking
[59:11] last night and and just to kind of like
[59:14] tell myself you know uh you know if I
[59:17] start feeding on things too much you
[59:19] know if I feed on it too much then it's
[59:21] I become consumed by it
[59:25] amen and so um even even so you know I
[59:30] have a full-time job I'm active duty
[59:33] military on top of that I I go to school
[59:36] for I'm I'm going for my masters right
[59:38] now and I just have a couple more
[59:40] classes left on top of that I also uh do
[59:44] an internship about 70 to 80 hours a
[59:47] month uh to to gain hours towards my
[59:50] certification on top of that I Minister
[59:54] here and there once in a while on top of
[59:56] that I have my
[59:58] family and so there's not enough hours
[1:00:01] in a
[1:00:02] day and I have to and so like I always
[1:00:05] tell you this that I'm not preaching to
[1:00:08] you so much as I'm preaching to
[1:00:12] myself amen so don't you know and I I I
[1:00:15] don't ever think you know if I got if I
[1:00:17] got one finger pointed at you and and
[1:00:19] you think I'm stepping on your toes I
[1:00:22] got three more pointing back at me cuz
[1:00:24] this this is this is a word of God for
[1:00:26] me just as much as it is for you because
[1:00:30] I can get too consumed by things I can
[1:00:32] get too focused on things and and things
[1:00:34] start to bother me and they bother my
[1:00:36] spirit you know and and we're living in
[1:00:38] a day that that I don't think that many
[1:00:42] could have foretold was coming that we
[1:00:45] you know like when you think about it'll
[1:00:47] it shall be as the days you know in
[1:00:50] Sodom and Gomorrah it's hard to believe
[1:00:52] that Sodom and Gomorrah was like this
[1:00:55] I mean when I think about it we're
[1:00:56] living in a time uh just like the the
[1:00:59] Fable uh the the emperor's clothes you
[1:01:03] remember that Fable from from being a
[1:01:05] child yeah you know so like if you've
[1:01:08] never heard it you know it's a story
[1:01:09] that that this these two raps gillions
[1:01:12] uh uh they come and they they basically
[1:01:16] they Swindle the king you know he gives
[1:01:18] them money and and they say that they're
[1:01:20] they're making certain clothes for him
[1:01:22] you know the most beautiful things and
[1:01:24] they're so they're so high tech and so
[1:01:27] highend that they're invisible you can't
[1:01:29] even see them they're so great and so
[1:01:31] they you know they in the story you know
[1:01:33] the whole time they're acting like
[1:01:35] they're sewing and everything you know
[1:01:36] measuring them out yep yep y this oh
[1:01:39] this is beautiful you know and and so
[1:01:41] then the King goes that you know on a
[1:01:43] parade and he's wearing his his new
[1:01:47] clothes and a little boy stands up and
[1:01:50] says he's
[1:01:53] naked
[1:01:56] and and I and I think about
[1:01:58] that and I H I have to be careful
[1:02:01] because I I I know that we're
[1:02:05] we're governments are in control of many
[1:02:08] things and sometimes you can say things
[1:02:10] and that governments don't like and
[1:02:13] people don't like but we're living in a
[1:02:16] time where in all this gender
[1:02:21] stuff it's the emperor's new clothes and
[1:02:25] they're trying to Gaslight people like
[1:02:29] you and I to believe that oh they're not
[1:02:32] naked they're not naked they're just
[1:02:34] they're fine they've got the new clothes
[1:02:37] going on for them and I'm sitting here
[1:02:39] waiting for some point for people to
[1:02:41] just Rise Up and Scream no you're
[1:02:44] naked amen you're you're not what you
[1:02:47] say you are and I and I am not going to
[1:02:51] participate in your delusions I'm not
[1:02:54] going to enable your mental
[1:02:59] disease the emperor is
[1:03:06] naked the Lord said unto Moses in in
[1:03:09] Exodus go unto the people and sanctify
[1:03:12] them today and
[1:03:14] tomorrow and let them wash their clothes
[1:03:17] and be ready against the third day for
[1:03:20] the third day the Lord will come down in
[1:03:23] the sight of all people upon Mount
[1:03:26] Si on the third
[1:03:28] day notice how that's the same thing as
[1:03:32] Joshua go and sanctify
[1:03:35] yourselves because on the third day as
[1:03:38] soon as you see the ark moving get up
[1:03:40] and get
[1:03:42] after Moses sanctify
[1:03:45] herself for on the third day God is
[1:03:48] going to
[1:03:50] speak and in this sanctification that
[1:03:53] was like a a physical act that they had
[1:03:56] to do you know they had to clean
[1:03:59] themselves up wash their clothes they
[1:04:01] had to physically prepare the
[1:04:04] sanctification and it was it was an
[1:04:06] acknowledgment then that that they were
[1:04:08] being set apart that something was
[1:04:10] happening now that was different than
[1:04:12] the couple days before and it was in
[1:04:14] preparation for something new because
[1:04:17] they had not gone this way here to for
[1:04:20] amen and I believe that we're in the the
[1:04:23] cycle of the Third Exodus that we're in
[1:04:26] the the third day as it was that that
[1:04:29] God has
[1:04:30] descended and we hear his voice speaking
[1:04:34] to us and we have to be ready we have to
[1:04:38] be set aside we have to be cleaned we
[1:04:41] have to be
[1:04:42] anointed
[1:04:44] Amen brother brandom says I wonder if we
[1:04:48] have done everything that God requires
[1:04:51] us to
[1:04:52] do Jes have we followed every iota of
[1:04:57] scripture have we give him our hearts
[1:05:00] and lives to
[1:05:04] service
[1:05:06] wow I I I I read that and I hear that
[1:05:10] and I think
[1:05:13] of the The Prostitute that they brought
[1:05:16] before Jesus for
[1:05:21] stoning he goes on and he says
[1:05:24] what's the reason you want to be
[1:05:27] healed and he says this he says that's
[1:05:30] the reason you can't get Faith enough
[1:05:33] see because maybe you haven't made this
[1:05:36] thing sincerely to God in your
[1:05:38] heart and he goes on to in that in that
[1:05:42] message he goes on to talk about
[1:05:44] Hezekiah and how he when he came time
[1:05:47] for him to be taken how he begged God
[1:05:50] for more years so he could do things for
[1:05:52] God's purpose
[1:05:55] and brother brandom here is is saying
[1:05:57] that we have to have our requests for
[1:06:01] God to intervene have to come from the
[1:06:03] right place amen there's a lot of people
[1:06:05] who preach things like Prosperity
[1:06:07] doctrines you know God owns the that the
[1:06:10] cattle on a thousand hills and we want
[1:06:12] some of that you know but we have to ask
[1:06:15] from the right place we have to ask from
[1:06:18] a a heart that's right with
[1:06:21] God and and I and so like I I'm just
[1:06:24] building a foundation here as I talk
[1:06:26] about this the altar of our hearts to
[1:06:28] get to where I want to go so just bear
[1:06:31] with me and so there's a couple more
[1:06:34] verses that I would like to read to you
[1:06:36] in Exodus 40 Moses says and uh or God
[1:06:41] says this to Moses rather and thou shalt
[1:06:43] anoint the altar of the burnt offering
[1:06:47] and all his vessels and sanctify the
[1:06:50] altar see the anointing wasn't the
[1:06:53] sanctification follow with me the O the
[1:06:55] anointing was something different than
[1:06:58] being
[1:06:59] Sanctified and it says sanctify The
[1:07:02] Altar and it shall be an altar Most
[1:07:07] Holy an altar Most Holy that's that's
[1:07:11] that's this is what I want us to see is
[1:07:13] that this is our
[1:07:14] heart that it must that we must clean it
[1:07:17] up it must be anointed it must be
[1:07:21] Sanctified and set apart for the
[1:07:22] purposes of God
[1:07:25] because we're Kings and Priests to him
[1:07:27] and when we we talk about anointing you
[1:07:30] know if you look at it through scripture
[1:07:32] you the first place I think is actually
[1:07:34] mentioned is when Jacob has the the
[1:07:36] dream and he you know you know the story
[1:07:38] he lays his head upon the rock and and
[1:07:40] he begins to sleep and he has this dream
[1:07:42] or vision of of angels going up and down
[1:07:45] a ladder or a Stairway to Heaven and he
[1:07:48] when he woke up this that morning he he
[1:07:50] anointed he poured something out onto
[1:07:53] the rock you know a bit of oil or or
[1:07:57] whatever it was but he anointed that
[1:07:59] place and said it was set apart and holy
[1:08:02] because of what have happened there and
[1:08:05] we what I want you to see is that that
[1:08:07] when you when you anoint something you
[1:08:10] are pouring something out onto it you're
[1:08:14] giving something of
[1:08:15] yourselves onto the altar all right so
[1:08:19] when I when I if I was to anoint you
[1:08:23] know this this if this was the Altar and
[1:08:24] I was anointing it I would take some oil
[1:08:27] maybe perhaps and I would pour oil upon
[1:08:29] the altar when David was anointed
[1:08:33] king before he was ever made King what
[1:08:37] did they do the the the prophet poured
[1:08:39] oil upon him to anoint him and so it was
[1:08:41] a transfer then of something of mine to
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:47] altar okay this bear with me bear with
[1:08:52] me I promise you I'm getting somewhere
[1:08:54] with
[1:08:58] this and so this transfer brother
[1:09:01] brandham says that all that was in
[1:09:04] God was in
[1:09:07] Jesus and all that was in Jesus was
[1:09:10] poured into his
[1:09:13] church and so we are an anointed
[1:09:17] people and when God told Moses to anoint
[1:09:20] the Altar and the vessels and sanctify
[1:09:22] the altar it it was the Act of of
[1:09:24] pouring out something upon the Altar and
[1:09:27] the vessels and setting them aside to be
[1:09:30] used for for a a designated
[1:09:34] purpose it wasn't just to be you know
[1:09:36] sacrifice one day and a dinner table the
[1:09:38] next and you know a card game played on
[1:09:42] it was it was everything was set aside
[1:09:44] for purpose those vessels didn't you
[1:09:46] know go to the campfire and and and
[1:09:49] mother didn't cook you know dinner with
[1:09:51] the vessels that had been anointed is
[1:09:53] set
[1:09:54] aside and so how can God anoint this
[1:09:59] altar in our
[1:10:01] heart how does he anoint
[1:10:05] it he pours out his own self onto the
[1:10:10] altar of our
[1:10:12] heart his
[1:10:14] Spirit his blood is poured out for us
[1:10:18] this anointing it's a
[1:10:21] transfer something of his
[1:10:24] onto
[1:10:25] us it's not just some pressed oil it's
[1:10:29] not just you know like some anointing
[1:10:31] oil you know made with a formula it's
[1:10:34] the literal part of God poured out onto
[1:10:39] you pour that onto the altar of your
[1:10:42] heart where he wants to
[1:10:45] be and I'm I'm still building a
[1:10:48] foundation here for I'm building a
[1:10:50] foundation for the for the last five
[1:10:52] minutes of what I'll say to you the
[1:10:54] whole this whole thing is just
[1:11:01] Foundation sanctify The Altar and it
[1:11:04] shall be an altar most holy and that's
[1:11:07] the whole thing that's really the whole
[1:11:10] thing that this altar within us is set
[1:11:12] aside for a holy
[1:11:16] purpose that that we're we're not
[1:11:18] consumed by the things of the world
[1:11:19] we're not consumed by the things that
[1:11:21] have fears and anxieties and doubts
[1:11:23] we're not consumed with business we're
[1:11:26] not consumed with education we're not
[1:11:28] consumed with with making uh you know
[1:11:31] something of
[1:11:34] ourselves I told you I'm preaching to
[1:11:38] myself Solomon was a a pretty wise
[1:11:43] man and he he gave us many teachings and
[1:11:46] I want to I want to go through some of
[1:11:48] these and and read some scripture and
[1:11:49] some quotes as I go in one in one place
[1:11:52] in Proverbs and 23 he says my son give
[1:11:56] me your heart and let your eyes observe
[1:11:59] my ways because the heart's
[1:12:02] important and God said that that's where
[1:12:05] the true altar is and and see Satan goes
[1:12:09] after the eyes and God goes after the
[1:12:12] heart so you know like you think back to
[1:12:15] to the garden and and Eve in the Sin it
[1:12:19] the first thing that it says is that she
[1:12:22] looked upon the the the fruit she looked
[1:12:25] upon the tree and saw that it was good
[1:12:27] and pleasing to the eyes and then she
[1:12:29] began to reason with Satan that oh
[1:12:32] surely you I should not surely die well
[1:12:35] that sounds that sounds good and so she
[1:12:37] started to reason and she looked and
[1:12:39] Satan always goes after our eyes while
[1:12:43] God always goes after our
[1:12:45] heart and is brother random said in
[1:12:48] looking at the Unseen so is it tonight
[1:12:51] God wants to lead man
[1:12:54] so he made himself a little control
[1:12:56] tower in the midst of his heart so that
[1:13:00] man would be led by the spirit of
[1:13:03] God and this is the great fight
[1:13:07] tonight that Satan took the eye a man's
[1:13:10] head to control him by his head and God
[1:13:15] took his
[1:13:17] heart so what what won Eve over was what
[1:13:21] she looked at what she's seen she
[1:13:24] allowed her eyes to to to consume what
[1:13:28] everything and then she's singularly
[1:13:30] focused on just one thing and she forgot
[1:13:33] all the rest of
[1:13:35] it and so when I told you earlier that
[1:13:40] we need to trust our heart I truly mean
[1:13:43] it if God is there in our heart we can
[1:13:47] trust it we can trust it we need to
[1:13:50] trust it because that's the control
[1:13:52] tower
[1:13:54] you know we we come here and in our
[1:13:57] hearts burn within us you know as we're
[1:13:59] worshiping as we're praising God and
[1:14:02] we're creating an
[1:14:03] atmosphere and you know the angels of
[1:14:06] God you know as I stepped out here onto
[1:14:08] the platform this morning you know I
[1:14:10] just walked into the presence of God you
[1:14:14] know the the Angels love this presence
[1:14:17] you know the the the Angels my angels
[1:14:19] here your angel is here we're surrounded
[1:14:22] by a a convocation of angels from
[1:14:25] directly sent from the Throne of God to
[1:14:28] be with
[1:14:29] us and they love this atmosphere you
[1:14:32] know the atmosphere that we create is
[1:14:35] not the same atmosphere that is created
[1:14:37] in
[1:14:38] heaven no no because we're
[1:14:42] redeemed Angels were created for worship
[1:14:45] Angels were created for a purpose to to
[1:14:48] worship God holy holy holy kados kados
[1:14:52] kados and we say it we say it because
[1:14:56] we're
[1:14:57] redeemed No Angel could ever take your
[1:15:03] praise I think sometimes that when we
[1:15:08] praise and we worship God that Heaven
[1:15:10] Must Fall
[1:15:12] quiet as God listens to the worship of
[1:15:15] his people and he those those
[1:15:20] thanksgivings and those that love that
[1:15:22] we EX toward him and how much we
[1:15:24] appreciate him and his grace and his
[1:15:26] Mercy as it as it ascends to heaven like
[1:15:29] a like like a a prayer almost and it
[1:15:33] goes to heaven and I can imagine that
[1:15:35] the Angels just go
[1:15:38] quiet there's the Believers in
[1:15:41] Wyoming there's the Believers in
[1:15:44] India
[1:15:46] Pakistan all over the world
[1:15:50] Africa
[1:15:51] Congo Sudan
[1:15:55] and God just bathes in it that his
[1:15:57] children love
[1:15:59] him
[1:16:01] amen and I believe that that those
[1:16:04] angels are here brother brandham said to
[1:16:07] energize your faith that they they're
[1:16:10] they're they're standing by they're just
[1:16:12] they're wanting to to help you amen
[1:16:15] they're wanting to with their presence
[1:16:17] and their their their position to coax
[1:16:20] you into things and to ask for things
[1:16:23] that you think are impossible to to
[1:16:25] raise your faith up and and and to be
[1:16:28] around
[1:16:29] you Amen brother Brandon went on to
[1:16:33] say man's always trying to achieve
[1:16:37] something by his
[1:16:41] head amen boy I'm guilty of doing that
[1:16:45] you know a lot of times we we we make
[1:16:47] decisions and we do things thinking with
[1:16:50] our
[1:16:51] head before we can can even give our
[1:16:53] hearts time to to think about
[1:16:57] it and brother Bram says you know man
[1:17:00] he's supposed to achieve things but
[1:17:02] we're supposed to achieve things by his
[1:17:06] heart and that's the control tower where
[1:17:08] God controls him and directs his
[1:17:10] thoughts directs his walk directs his
[1:17:15] emotions and so God wants to direct us
[1:17:19] God W wants us to accomplish things
[1:17:24] he he doesn't want us to be lazy and not
[1:17:26] do anything he doesn't want us to be
[1:17:28] lazy and just wait for people to to give
[1:17:30] us food or or you know to for the
[1:17:33] government to provide you know
[1:17:35] everything that we have need of that
[1:17:37] we're we're able to to to work and and
[1:17:42] and work towards the purpose of
[1:17:46] God and and so I believe
[1:17:49] that when God we when we have our altar
[1:17:53] clear and we're we're led by the spirit
[1:17:56] of God that we can do great things for
[1:17:58] God and it doesn't matter what our what
[1:18:01] our position is whether we're a
[1:18:03] housewife or a
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:06] farmer an engineer a doctor it doesn't
[1:18:10] matter who you are you know I find it
[1:18:13] strange sometimes I find it strange that
[1:18:16] people look down on other
[1:18:19] things people look down on other
[1:18:21] occupations and I really just I I I
[1:18:24] don't understand
[1:18:25] that
[1:18:27] um many times when I've when I've
[1:18:29] ministered you know I've said this you
[1:18:32] know that that guys when we get together
[1:18:34] the first thing we do is we start asking
[1:18:36] one another what they do for work oh
[1:18:38] what are you you know and sometimes and
[1:18:40] we just sort of naturally fall into this
[1:18:43] ranking oh well you're a doctor wow wow
[1:18:46] praise the Lord that took a lot of
[1:18:47] Education you know and and this guy you
[1:18:49] know I'm just a janitor you know just a
[1:18:51] janitor I remember one time I was
[1:18:54] talking to a a a psychologist over
[1:18:58] dinner and um she was a Jewish Jewish
[1:19:01] lady we were out to to dinner with with
[1:19:04] a a good friend of ours and they were
[1:19:06] roommates so she came to dinner and I
[1:19:09] was talking she you know she was telling
[1:19:11] me about uh her education and things
[1:19:13] like that and she says oh you know what
[1:19:15] do you do and at that time I was I was
[1:19:18] working for General Motors and I said
[1:19:20] you know why I'm just a factory worker
[1:19:23] and she said just a factory worker
[1:19:27] just and that stuck with me for the
[1:19:31] until until this
[1:19:33] day that that no matter what you do
[1:19:37] you're important that you have a role
[1:19:39] that you
[1:19:40] play amen and some of us are not called
[1:19:43] to be doctors and lawyers or some great
[1:19:46] somebody some of us are just called to
[1:19:49] be simple people janitors you know and
[1:19:53] and I wouldn't be ashamed of that I
[1:19:55] wouldn't be ashamed you know if if God
[1:19:57] if God LED my life and put my life in
[1:19:59] such a way that every I lost everything
[1:20:02] and I had to to pull a a lawn put a lawn
[1:20:05] mower in a wheelbarrow and and walk
[1:20:07] around the neighborhood mowing yards to
[1:20:09] provide for my family I would not be
[1:20:12] ashamed that's not I'm not too good for
[1:20:15] that I pray I'm never in that position
[1:20:18] but I'm not too good to do that I'm not
[1:20:20] too good to take out the trash I'm not
[1:20:22] too good to pick things up off the side
[1:20:24] of the road and clean the clean things
[1:20:28] up we ought not to to have this thought
[1:20:31] that somebody is higher than another
[1:20:33] because there's no there are no big ones
[1:20:36] amongst USL we meet on the same
[1:20:39] level
[1:20:41] it doesn't matter whether what what you
[1:20:44] are we're we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:20:46] God co-equal we don't come from this
[1:20:49] world we come as Jesus said from
[1:20:52] somewhere else
[1:20:56] amen I believe that God wants to direct
[1:20:58] us through that inner witness that is on
[1:21:00] the inside of our
[1:21:03] heart and so maybe we can we can brother
[1:21:07] renom said this he said you
[1:21:09] know says sometimes I can just let
[1:21:12] loose you know I and just you get so
[1:21:15] freed up in the spirit of God and then
[1:21:17] he goes on and says but you know if I
[1:21:19] look around then I got my eyes on people
[1:21:23] and so you know the people start
[1:21:26] distracting the things that we see start
[1:21:28] distracting us and
[1:21:30] so you know I wish we could just let
[1:21:32] loose a little bit today amen and you
[1:21:36] know if if looking at people and judging
[1:21:39] people and ranking people are are are
[1:21:42] being concerned about what other people
[1:21:43] are doing stumbled brother brandom I'm
[1:21:46] pretty sure it would stumble us too and
[1:21:49] it's and so we just need to pull
[1:21:52] together and unite I believe you know
[1:21:55] brother we've been friends now for for
[1:21:57] many years you know brother Dell of if
[1:21:59] we sat down and we went head to-head or
[1:22:01] I went head-to-head with I any of you
[1:22:03] here and we started talking Doctrine and
[1:22:05] how we believe things we would find all
[1:22:08] kinds of differences there would be all
[1:22:11] kinds of things that well I see it a
[1:22:12] little bit this way I see a little bit
[1:22:14] that way but you know what it doesn't
[1:22:16] matter it doesn't matter at all because
[1:22:18] we're in this together we're friends
[1:22:21] we're brothers
[1:22:23] we're brothers and
[1:22:25] sisters you know and so we we don't we
[1:22:28] don't approach things and let them
[1:22:30] divide us you know like when when you
[1:22:32] have somebody that approaches you and
[1:22:34] like starts asking you things that will
[1:22:37] divide you there's something
[1:22:39] wrong amen a lot of people do that
[1:22:41] they'll come up and they'll they they
[1:22:42] want to get your idea what do you think
[1:22:44] about this what do you think about that
[1:22:45] and if they're asking from a general you
[1:22:47] if they're asking from the right place
[1:22:48] in their
[1:22:49] heart right like brother brandom said
[1:22:52] earlier that I read you know uh we're
[1:22:54] not always asking for the right thing
[1:22:57] right it's not coming from the right
[1:22:59] part of our heart people ask things
[1:23:01] sometimes to cause division to sew seeds
[1:23:04] of of
[1:23:05] mistrust and and to kind of like get
[1:23:08] people on their side of things well you
[1:23:10] believe it like me brother praise God
[1:23:13] that person doesn't believe it this way
[1:23:16] we'll just have to pray for
[1:23:19] him well that's not on any of my notes
[1:23:21] anyhow
[1:23:27] so man is always trying to achieve
[1:23:29] something by his head and he's supposed
[1:23:31] to achieve by his heart because God is
[1:23:34] controlling him and directing his
[1:23:36] thoughts and directing where he's
[1:23:37] walking directing his
[1:23:40] emotions his
[1:23:45] emotions and I sees you know emotions
[1:23:48] are are one of the most difficult things
[1:23:51] for us to control sometimes
[1:23:53] we get mad about things that we ought
[1:23:55] not to get mad about we get upset about
[1:23:57] things that we ought not to to let
[1:23:59] bother us we get we get fearful about
[1:24:02] things that we should not be afraid of
[1:24:04] we we get anxious about things that
[1:24:06] shouldn't give us
[1:24:07] anxiety you know young married couples
[1:24:10] when they they they first get married
[1:24:12] you know it's supposed to be this they
[1:24:13] have this honeymoon period you know but
[1:24:15] then they pretty soon find out you know
[1:24:18] that that well I I don't see it just
[1:24:20] exactly like you do
[1:24:23] you know in my house dad did the dishes
[1:24:26] and you don't want to do the dishes why
[1:24:28] aren't you doing the dishes there's
[1:24:29] something wrong with you and they start
[1:24:31] getting a little bit upset a little bit
[1:24:32] angry well my my mother bless her heart
[1:24:35] she she cooked dinner at this time as
[1:24:37] she had on the table at this time and
[1:24:39] every day it was 5:00 and you're not
[1:24:41] getting the dinner on till 7 something's
[1:24:44] wrong with you you need to line up to my
[1:24:48] expectations and they get angry and they
[1:24:50] get mad at one another and they fuss and
[1:24:51] they fight fight and they argue and they
[1:24:53] say things that they ought not ever to
[1:24:56] say and then they have to you know F
[1:24:59] find something in themselves to repent a
[1:25:01] little bit and then they come back
[1:25:03] together and like well I'm sorry I said
[1:25:04] this and then I'm sorry I said this I
[1:25:06] shouldn't have I shouldn't have whereas
[1:25:08] if God was controlling our
[1:25:11] emotions we wouldn't fuss and fight with
[1:25:14] one another we wouldn't we wouldn't
[1:25:16] argue with little things that really
[1:25:18] don't matter we would just love one
[1:25:21] another and we need to let God control
[1:25:24] us
[1:25:26] Amen brother brother random goes on and
[1:25:29] he says you know it's strange for me
[1:25:31] because I I usually don't read a lot of
[1:25:34] quotes but I'm reading a lot
[1:25:37] today I hope that's all
[1:25:39] right brother Brandon goes on and he
[1:25:41] says there's a control tower of the soul
[1:25:44] the heart and one for the body and each
[1:25:48] Tower is a warning caller for the needs
[1:25:50] of the other each one calls to to the
[1:25:52] Need For What the caller is calling for
[1:25:55] and it sends out a wave of warning for
[1:25:58] instance the flesh thirsts to satisfy
[1:26:01] the desires that's in the body and the
[1:26:04] spirit desires for the things that are
[1:26:07] in the soul and then he goes on to say
[1:26:10] so the flesh wants the things for the
[1:26:11] flesh we all we all need that there
[1:26:14] there's things that we perfectly desire
[1:26:16] that's nothing wrong with my flesh likes
[1:26:18] to have clean teeth so I brush my
[1:26:21] teeth unfortunately my My Flesh if I
[1:26:24] would let it I I I could very easily uh
[1:26:28] get lost in books and and movies or
[1:26:31] things like that and
[1:26:35] entertainment people sometimes tell me I
[1:26:37] I ought not be so
[1:26:40] transparent but I I I I can't help
[1:26:44] it because I'm just a I'm just me I
[1:26:48] can't be somebody else I can only be me
[1:26:51] and I I I detest the idea that we so
[1:26:55] often Place upon the ministry that
[1:26:58] they're somehow above everything that
[1:27:01] they've arrived they have no problems
[1:27:03] you know they have no issues they have
[1:27:05] nothing they struggle with they have no
[1:27:07] you know they're just perfect they
[1:27:08] they're there and they feed us the word
[1:27:10] of God you know and their lies are just
[1:27:12] to be
[1:27:13] envied I am not ashamed to say that that
[1:27:16] that is a mistaken
[1:27:19] concept at least for me I have plenty of
[1:27:21] things that I struggle with plenty of
[1:27:23] things that I deal with plenty of things
[1:27:25] I need to change about myself and my
[1:27:28] flesh wants things that are not good for
[1:27:31] me amen My Flesh wants
[1:27:35] donuts donuts there is a donut shop near
[1:27:38] our house it's actually not near our
[1:27:41] house but somehow we sometimes make it
[1:27:43] near our
[1:27:45] house and they make the best
[1:27:49] donuts I could and I could just eat them
[1:27:52] and eat them and eat them and that's not
[1:27:54] good for my
[1:27:58] flesh but my spirit desires things for
[1:28:01] the
[1:28:02] soul my spirit desires the word of God
[1:28:05] there is not a day that goes by that I
[1:28:07] don't listen to the to something of
[1:28:09] brother brandom I listen to something of
[1:28:12] the message I might not get through a
[1:28:13] whole message but there's not a day that
[1:28:14] goes by that I don't hear 10 minutes 15
[1:28:17] minutes or a half hour or something that
[1:28:20] that that God can speak to me amen
[1:28:24] because there's something in my soul
[1:28:25] that cries out and thirst for the Living
[1:28:28] God Amen and that's what I have to to to
[1:28:33] lean towards and brother brandom says
[1:28:35] you know that many times these War one
[1:28:38] with
[1:28:39] another amen and I'm still I'm still
[1:28:42] laying a foundation I'm not off my
[1:28:44] notes we're we're not till the last 5
[1:28:47] minutes
[1:28:49] yet the spirit and the flesh fight
[1:28:52] against one another but our our heart
[1:28:56] our soul has to be set aside for God
[1:28:59] because if we if we allow other things
[1:29:02] on the altar of our
[1:29:04] soul God can't be
[1:29:06] there faith and fear cannot coexist
[1:29:10] together amen and so if we allow things
[1:29:13] to bother us and consume us and consume
[1:29:16] our thoughts and then then and we put
[1:29:17] that on the Altar and that's what we're
[1:29:19] paying attention to God cannot control
[1:29:22] us God cannot control our Direction and
[1:29:25] our emotions and our and and help us
[1:29:28] walk in the paths that he would have for
[1:29:30] us and so if there's conflict today
[1:29:33] within you if you if you're if you're
[1:29:36] mixed and undecided and you you you're
[1:29:39] consumed by by things that you ought not
[1:29:41] to be consumed with I pray that the
[1:29:45] spirit wins out over the flesh
[1:29:48] today don't let the cares of this life
[1:29:52] bog you
[1:29:53] down don't let the worries of of
[1:29:55] Tomorrow bog you yes we have to think
[1:29:58] about them we have to we ought not live
[1:30:00] like uh you know uh
[1:30:03] the just not thinking about the future
[1:30:06] we we have to plant our potatoes as if
[1:30:08] God is not coming for a hundred years or
[1:30:11] a thousand years you know we have to
[1:30:12] plant ahead for our children and the
[1:30:14] Bible says you know a wise man a Godly
[1:30:16] Man leaves an inheritance for his
[1:30:18] children's children and I'm still
[1:30:20] working on that but
[1:30:22] uh you know there that's where my soul
[1:30:26] needs to be I need to be focused on the
[1:30:28] things of God not the things of this
[1:30:31] world not the things that you know the
[1:30:33] media wants to feed at us you know and
[1:30:35] if you watch too much of it you know
[1:30:37] like they they they guide the the media
[1:30:40] begins to guide your life they guide
[1:30:43] your
[1:30:44] emotions you're supposed to be angry
[1:30:46] about this you know and they'll just
[1:30:48] feed it to you 24 hours a day 7 days a
[1:30:51] week next thing oh you're supposed to be
[1:30:53] sad about this now be oh nope nope back
[1:30:56] to being upset about this you know oh be
[1:30:59] happy here no be sad no be confused what
[1:31:02] are they doing and they try to control
[1:31:05] people through their
[1:31:07] emotions we can't allow ourselves to be
[1:31:10] consumed by
[1:31:11] that brother brandom says in the message
[1:31:14] thirst we find there that what's a great
[1:31:18] trouble today is that too many people
[1:31:21] will try to live between those two
[1:31:25] desires for one of them desires the
[1:31:27] things of Earth and the other desires
[1:31:29] the things of heaven and it's so easy to
[1:31:32] be caught in this war between the Flesh
[1:31:35] and the spirit it's so easy to be
[1:31:38] struggle you know which one am I going
[1:31:41] to allow in my life to take
[1:31:44] preeminence and many times we can't get
[1:31:46] what we need we can't get what we ask
[1:31:48] for because of this struggle and we
[1:31:51] don't ask from the right place we don't
[1:31:54] have God on the altar you know we we ask
[1:31:57] for things you know and blessings and we
[1:31:59] ask for for all these good things but
[1:32:02] what's what's driving that you know we
[1:32:05] can ask God for a brand new car but if
[1:32:07] we just need want a brand new car
[1:32:08] because the neighbor got a brand new car
[1:32:10] Brother D and sister L I drove in their
[1:32:12] car last night it's a beautiful
[1:32:16] car it's a beautiful car you know some
[1:32:20] might say it's the best car
[1:32:22] best best car there's no cars like it
[1:32:24] it's a beautiful
[1:32:25] car and you know just sitting in it man
[1:32:29] I need a I I need a new
[1:32:32] car you know and if I was to pray to God
[1:32:35] to give me a new car you know so I can
[1:32:37] be like brother Dale you know that
[1:32:40] probably wouldn't be the right place to
[1:32:42] be asking for something you see I I'm
[1:32:45] I'm making I'm making a little bit light
[1:32:48] but the point is is we have to have the
[1:32:51] the right motive and
[1:32:53] objective if we want to if we want a
[1:32:56] promise of God to come to come and be
[1:32:59] manifests in our lives we have to have
[1:33:01] the right motive and objective not only
[1:33:04] that we have to have the right attitude
[1:33:06] towards
[1:33:07] it and I think David in in Psalms he
[1:33:11] captures this this Unity that we are
[1:33:14] striving for with the outer man and the
[1:33:17] inner man he says he says my soul longth
[1:33:21] yet even fainteth for the courts of the
[1:33:24] Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for
[1:33:31] the Living God and David I I think David
[1:33:34] of all people he had a clear
[1:33:36] understanding uh that that the heart was
[1:33:39] more important than the Flesh and it was
[1:33:41] more than just you know and he and back
[1:33:44] in those days they didn't just believe
[1:33:46] that the heart was just like some muscle
[1:33:48] but it was the it was the seat of
[1:33:50] emotions
[1:33:52] amen it was it was is where they were
[1:33:54] passionate from it was the center the
[1:33:56] the seed of morality it was it was uh um
[1:34:00] the center of mem morality and it was
[1:34:02] the they considered the heart to be the
[1:34:04] most inner part of a man it it was all
[1:34:08] their feelings all their emotions all
[1:34:11] their will came from the
[1:34:14] heart and the you know the the heart
[1:34:16] possesses enormous capacity for good and
[1:34:19] for evil and people do amazing
[1:34:24] things to benefit their fellow man you
[1:34:26] know they they charity and altruism and
[1:34:30] and people donate and you know to this
[1:34:32] cause and that cause you know uh but at
[1:34:36] the same time people can do very evil
[1:34:38] things out of their
[1:34:40] heart and when we talk today that our
[1:34:43] heart is made for a special purpose that
[1:34:46] it's in this heart this sacred altar
[1:34:49] this sacred place where God meets you
[1:34:52] and unites himself with
[1:34:55] you I I want to
[1:34:58] say that it's not done without
[1:35:01] blood it's not done without
[1:35:04] sacrifice because we cannot meet God
[1:35:07] face to face without
[1:35:09] sacrifice and people can do things you
[1:35:11] know out of the goodness of their heart
[1:35:13] or they can do Despicable evil things
[1:35:15] out of out of the evil in their heart
[1:35:17] but for a Believer for us to do the
[1:35:19] things of God from our heart and then
[1:35:22] let him control us there must be a
[1:35:24] sacrifice made amen there has to be
[1:35:27] something poured out upon the Altar and
[1:35:28] it has to be Sanctified and set apart
[1:35:31] for God to
[1:35:34] use it cannot happen without blood and
[1:35:38] the Heart can no despair the heart can
[1:35:41] no grief it can be these are all
[1:35:43] scriptures be bowed down be broken be
[1:35:47] sorrowful can no bitterness it can be
[1:35:49] filled with anger and is subject to
[1:35:54] fear and I think it's interesting that
[1:35:57] that fear is not called to
[1:36:00] sin fear is not called a sin Jesus did
[1:36:03] not say that ever that I found that fear
[1:36:06] is a sin but the problem is as I said
[1:36:09] earlier that if sin or I'm sorry if fear
[1:36:13] is there that faith cannot be be there
[1:36:17] they are opposites they cannot
[1:36:19] peacefully coexist you know you can't
[1:36:22] just you know be worried so much about
[1:36:24] you know what's coming or what's around
[1:36:26] you or your next steps in life that you
[1:36:29] can't have faith to walk in what God has
[1:36:31] ordained for
[1:36:32] you
[1:36:35] amen let me read some scriptures for you
[1:36:38] just very quickly now as I am I'm almost
[1:36:42] there and we're very close to would you
[1:36:45] forgive me if I went just a little more
[1:36:46] than an hour okay all right so some
[1:36:50] scripture here in the in the morning
[1:36:51] Thou shalt say would God it were evening
[1:36:54] and at even Thou shalt say would God it
[1:36:56] were morning for the fear of your heart
[1:36:59] wherewith you shall fear and for the
[1:37:01] sight of your eyes which you shall see
[1:37:04] and we look around and we see all these
[1:37:06] things and our hearts can be a little
[1:37:08] bit fearful a little bit
[1:37:10] troubled men's Hearts failing them for
[1:37:14] fear and for looking after those things
[1:37:16] which are coming on the earth for even
[1:37:19] the powers of Heaven shall be shaken
[1:37:22] and that's a lot of
[1:37:24] fear fear not them which kill the body
[1:37:27] but are not able to kill the soul fear
[1:37:29] not ye for I know that you seek Jesus
[1:37:32] which was crucified fear not Zacharias
[1:37:34] for thy prayer is heard and the angel
[1:37:36] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[1:37:38] found favor with God fear not for behold
[1:37:42] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[1:37:44] fear not believe only and she shall be
[1:37:47] made whole fear not therefore you are of
[1:37:51] more value than many sparrows and the
[1:37:53] scripture tells us 365 times fear not so
[1:37:59] it must be something that we're very
[1:38:01] prone
[1:38:02] to and and you notice now that that God
[1:38:05] comes on the scene and the first thing
[1:38:07] he says is fear
[1:38:09] not and and the the reason for that I
[1:38:12] think a good deal of it is because that
[1:38:15] faith cannot o exist with
[1:38:17] fear God God is saying okay I'm here get
[1:38:21] the fear
[1:38:22] away get the fear out of your life so
[1:38:25] that faith can take place and faith can
[1:38:27] do things so God can do for us what he
[1:38:30] wants to do because if we're wrapped up
[1:38:32] in fear we can't
[1:38:35] believe the angel always told Brother
[1:38:38] brandham every time when he came fear
[1:38:41] not and God God knows that our hearts
[1:38:44] are susceptible to fears and anxieties
[1:38:46] and I think that if Jesus was here today
[1:38:48] speaking he would tell you fear not fear
[1:38:51] not why why be afraid is is God in
[1:38:55] control amen is God bigger than your
[1:38:58] problems is has God ever failed you is
[1:39:02] does has God ever not had the answer you
[1:39:05] Lord has God ever not run to you when
[1:39:08] you were estranged from him when you
[1:39:09] were backslid and has God not ever found
[1:39:11] you wherever you were at and brought you
[1:39:13] back has God ever not restored you has
[1:39:17] God not ever as he has he ever felt it's
[1:39:20] impossible
[1:39:23] possible in the Book of Revelations it
[1:39:26] says when I saw him I fell at his feet
[1:39:28] as dead and he laid his right hand upon
[1:39:30] me saying fear not I am the first and
[1:39:33] the last I am he that liveth and was
[1:39:36] dead and behold I'm alive forever more
[1:39:39] and I have the keys of hell and
[1:39:42] death thank you Jesus amen
[1:39:46] hallelujah and last but certainly not
[1:39:49] least fear not little clock for it is
[1:39:52] your father's good pleasure to give you
[1:39:54] the kingdom but I want you to to make
[1:39:57] crystal
[1:39:59] clear fear not if you have
[1:40:03] fear God cannot work in your life like
[1:40:07] he wants
[1:40:09] toall we must fear
[1:40:14] not in in the sermon testimony brother
[1:40:18] randam says amen we have a hope today we
[1:40:20] can have faith today because the one who
[1:40:22] tells us I am the first and I am the
[1:40:24] last is also everything in the middle he
[1:40:28] was with you when he forms you in your
[1:40:30] mother's womb he will be with you when
[1:40:32] you take your last breath he is with you
[1:40:35] now he knows exactly what you are going
[1:40:38] through where your footsteps have been
[1:40:41] where they will go and he knows exactly
[1:40:44] where you stand today he is interested
[1:40:47] in every part of your life and he is
[1:40:49] concerned about every part of your life
[1:40:52] and he wants to move on every part of
[1:40:55] your
[1:40:56] life that's my God that's my God he
[1:41:01] knows where I've been he knows where I'm
[1:41:03] at right now he knows where I'm going
[1:41:05] and he holds it all in the palm of his
[1:41:06] hand there's no reason that I should
[1:41:09] have fear there's no reason that I
[1:41:10] should have worry or anxiety or doubts
[1:41:13] or or concerns that he can't do anything
[1:41:16] for me that he somehow he will he's not
[1:41:20] going to show up on time you know in
[1:41:23] this situation you know is he's not
[1:41:25] going to he's not going to answer my
[1:41:28] prayer on time that he's just going to
[1:41:30] leave me hanging that's not the God I
[1:41:33] serve the God I serve knows exactly
[1:41:36] where I stand he he knows he knows what
[1:41:39] what I'm concerned about and he's
[1:41:42] concerned about it with me every part of
[1:41:45] my life God is is involved with if I let
[1:41:48] him be involved if I let him be in the
[1:41:51] control tower he'll control my life and
[1:41:54] he'll control your
[1:41:58] life it says my heart was hot within me
[1:42:03] while I was musing the fire burned then
[1:42:07] spake I with my
[1:42:10] tongue our hearts have to burn within us
[1:42:15] with the fire of
[1:42:18] God while he was thinking about it while
[1:42:20] he was thinking about the things of God
[1:42:23] while I I was musing means while I was
[1:42:25] pondering while I was meditating that's
[1:42:28] right the fire burned within me the fire
[1:42:32] cleansed me the altar of my heart I'm
[1:42:35] reminded of Isaiah in the and and he's
[1:42:39] there in the courts of God in this other
[1:42:42] dimension and the angel comes and
[1:42:45] touches the coals of fire onto his lips
[1:42:48] now go and speak now go
[1:42:51] and I just pray that God father burn out
[1:42:55] everything within me that is not like
[1:42:58] you every doubt that I may have every
[1:43:01] question that I may have God burn it out
[1:43:04] of
[1:43:05] me in another place David
[1:43:08] writes we know the song create in me a
[1:43:11] clean
[1:43:12] heart and I think many times we we might
[1:43:15] sing a song like that as we do many
[1:43:19] times we're just saying saying the words
[1:43:21] but when you think about what David was
[1:43:24] actually writing create in me a clean
[1:43:28] heart oh
[1:43:30] God created in me clean clean Sanctified
[1:43:36] what did they do they they cleansed the
[1:43:39] altar they cleaned they cleaned up they
[1:43:42] washed their clothes clean a clean
[1:43:46] heart and renew a right Spirit Within Me
[1:43:50] renew a right mental attitude within me
[1:43:53] that every Divine promise of God will be
[1:43:56] mine cast me not away from your
[1:44:01] presence and take not your Holy Spirit
[1:44:03] from me yes
[1:44:06] sir and it's interesting in Hebrew this
[1:44:10] uh restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:44:14] salvation this this
[1:44:16] restore renew renew restore is the same
[1:44:21] thing we read in Malachi 4 that the
[1:44:25] hearts of the the children that the word
[1:44:27] will be restored renewed restored back
[1:44:30] to the faith of the fathers it's the
[1:44:32] same concept the same
[1:44:35] idea renew and restore cast me not away
[1:44:39] from your presence and take not your
[1:44:42] Holy Spirit from
[1:44:43] me amen then will I Treach then will I
[1:44:49] teach transgression
[1:44:51] transgressors your ways and sinners will
[1:44:54] be
[1:44:55] converted not when we're angry and upset
[1:44:59] it's so hard to witness and testify when
[1:45:03] you're mixed up
[1:45:04] yourself when you're a little bit
[1:45:06] uncertain about things yourself when you
[1:45:09] have questions and and you don't have
[1:45:11] the
[1:45:12] answers we need sometimes we need
[1:45:16] God to renew a right Spirit within us we
[1:45:20] can take those doubts and place them on
[1:45:22] the Altar and the fire of God would burn
[1:45:26] them amen we must believe this with all
[1:45:29] our heart brother brandom says over
[1:45:31] 2,000 times believe with all your heart
[1:45:36] believe with all your heart that means
[1:45:38] the entirety that there's no room for
[1:45:40] doubts there's no room for Fears there's
[1:45:42] no room for
[1:45:44] anxieties there's no room to consider
[1:45:46] the things that are going on around the
[1:45:48] world that we see we're we not ought to
[1:45:51] be consumed with the the emperor's
[1:45:54] clothes that's not us we're not we're
[1:45:56] not here it shouldn't concern us yes we
[1:45:59] hate to see the countries go we we we
[1:46:01] feel bad for these people with mental
[1:46:03] problems but we're not from here amen
[1:46:06] we're not of this world even as he is
[1:46:08] not of this
[1:46:10] world and I just I I believe that if we
[1:46:13] could just take the smallest promise of
[1:46:15] God and believe with all our hearts this
[1:46:18] morning that Miracles would take place
[1:46:21] right here if we could just believe with
[1:46:24] all with all of it and take everything
[1:46:27] off the Altar and let God anoint our
[1:46:30] hearts and be in control that that
[1:46:32] nothing would stand in the way of your
[1:46:34] prayers this morning I I I believe that
[1:46:37] that people could be healed miraculously
[1:46:39] I believe that you could stand up and
[1:46:41] walk and if you were hurting you would
[1:46:43] be able to that the pain would leave
[1:46:45] that the broken bones could be healed
[1:46:48] that that wounded Hearts could be
[1:46:50] restored and delivered Hallelujah you
[1:46:53] know and I just pray I just pray that
[1:46:56] God may your may your fire fall upon us
[1:46:59] this day May the fire of your word just
[1:47:03] consume us consume everything off the
[1:47:06] altar that that that every bit of my
[1:47:09] heart will be consumed by faith in your
[1:47:12] word that Lord that that I I just pray
[1:47:16] you know this is my prayer is renew a
[1:47:18] right Spirit Within Me restore unto me
[1:47:22] the joy of your salvation take not your
[1:47:24] Holy Spirit for me God move in this
[1:47:27] church move in each person's life from
[1:47:30] the youngest to the oldest I'm I'm
[1:47:32] praying and battling for
[1:47:36] you and if we could just take just the
[1:47:39] smallest promise and
[1:47:41] believe it'll come to
[1:47:44] pass you wouldn't need to be prayed for
[1:47:46] you wouldn't need to come up here and be
[1:47:48] anointed you wouldn't need to to have
[1:47:50] hands laid upon you you could just sit
[1:47:52] there in your seat in the altar of your
[1:47:54] heart and it would happen it'll happen

[1:48:01] impossible you know and I believe you
[1:48:03] know brother Dell mentioned it referen
[1:48:06] it earlier I think you know that the
[1:48:07] prophet was here and he would look out
[1:48:10] across the room that he would see a
[1:48:13] milky white Haze of faith in this
[1:48:16] room that things would just BEC coming
[1:48:19] milky white
[1:48:20] as people reach out in faith to God and
[1:48:24] the angels just gathering around just
[1:48:26] just ushering you just a little bit
[1:48:28] closer to the presence of God that
[1:48:31] nothing would stand in your way nothing
[1:48:34] would would keep you from receiving that
[1:48:38] people would be uh just delivered from
[1:48:41] whatever it is that's oppressing

[1:49:52] believer this morning we bind it in the
[1:49:54] name of Jesus Christ and we saw Satan
[1:49:57] let the people go let them go that they
[1:50:01] may worship their
[1:50:04] God
[1:50:06] Amen it can't be just a mental
[1:50:09] conception an uh an educated
[1:50:13] understanding we have way too much of
[1:50:15] that we have way too much but it has to
[1:50:19] be in our heart
[1:50:22] Hearts our
[1:50:24] hearts on the road to
[1:50:27] emus they said did not our hearts burn
[1:50:30] within us yes as he talked with us along
[1:50:33] the
[1:50:35] way is God talking to you this
[1:50:38] morning is he speaking to your
[1:50:42] heart our hearts burned within us as he
[1:50:44] talked with us by the way and while he
[1:50:47] opened to us the
[1:50:49] scriptures and see I'm just trying to do
[1:50:51] what Jesus
[1:50:52] did I'm just trying to to open the
[1:50:55] scriptures for you a little
[1:50:57] bit let's talk about the things of God
[1:51:01] come let us reason together though your
[1:51:03] sins be as Scarlet they shall be as
[1:51:06] white as wool May the power of God
[1:51:09] deliver you and I'll tell you what's on
[1:51:12] my altar what I what I earnestly pray
[1:51:15] for is that I can do his Good
[1:51:17] Will amen that that the that what's been
[1:51:21] said over me and prophesied about me
[1:51:24] will come to pass that God's word will
[1:51:26] accomplish what he has spoken in my life
[1:51:30] every bit of it because God doesn't send
[1:51:32] his word out and not accomplish what
[1:51:34] he's intended amen his word spoken
[1:51:37] before the foundation of the world is
[1:51:39] going and going and going until it meets
[1:51:43] the place where it's to come to pass and
[1:51:45] be made
[1:51:48] manifest amen
[1:51:50] I pray that God I pray that that his
[1:51:53] spirit will be so present Among Us that
[1:51:55] Miracles would
[1:51:57] happen that depression would flee
[1:52:00] anxiety would flee that God would move
[1:52:02] on your situation and I believe it I
[1:52:05] believe you standing here right now to
[1:52:07] deliver you all you have to do is reach
[1:52:10] out and touch the Lord as he walks
[1:52:13] by grab a hold of the Hem of His Garment
[1:52:16] and say God I believe with all my heart
[1:52:28] amen now let me get to the five minutes
[1:52:31] of my
[1:52:32] sermon now I want you to consider this
[1:52:35] I've been building this Foundation now
[1:52:39] for quite a while much longer than I
[1:52:41] normally go so give me five minutes and
[1:52:44] and give me your attention now than you
[1:52:46] Lord I want you to consider this altar
[1:52:50] that when we hear the term
[1:52:53] altar we have to connect it to
[1:52:56] sacrifice and we cannot say sacrifice
[1:52:59] without something being offered
[1:53:01] something being given and something has
[1:53:03] to be placed on the Altar and sacrificed
[1:53:07] offered to
[1:53:08] God and the first the first instance we
[1:53:11] see of sacrifice was in the garden when
[1:53:14] when God himself Jehovah came down and
[1:53:17] sacrificed Lambs in the garden to cover
[1:53:19] the sins of his children amen there the
[1:53:22] Fig Lees were not enough to cover them
[1:53:24] yeah they covered them physically but
[1:53:26] but there had to be blood because the
[1:53:29] life is in the
[1:53:30] blood amen the life is in the
[1:53:34] blood and so the only way that they
[1:53:37] could be covered was through the shed
[1:53:40] blood a life because they were guilty
[1:53:42] they were they were worthy of death and
[1:53:44] so a life had to be taken to pay for
[1:53:47] that Amen to cover it and brother
[1:53:50] brandom talks about
[1:53:52] this this moment in time and and I love
[1:53:56] I love how he says is just is so po
[1:53:59] poetic you know that that as they they
[1:54:02] walked out of the garden you know
[1:54:05] covered by these animal skins the blood
[1:54:07] still dripping down their legs and and
[1:54:10] the the agony the regret that they were
[1:54:14] going through brother random said they
[1:54:17] they never knew tears before they cried
[1:54:20] as they walked out of the garden that
[1:54:22] day with blood dripping down
[1:54:25] them and they they went out of the
[1:54:28] garden and they they started to build
[1:54:30] this life and as I just move quickly now
[1:54:34] how how did Abel know that a blood
[1:54:37] sacrifice would please God how how did
[1:54:41] Abel know both Cain and Abel went to the
[1:54:45] same church they sat on the same Pew
[1:54:49] they heard the same
[1:54:50] message and and
[1:54:53] fundamentally let me put it this way
[1:54:55] they were both they were both uh farmers
[1:54:58] of a type but fundamentally Cain was
[1:55:01] actually more in line with what with the
[1:55:04] word of God as a farmer tilling the
[1:55:07] soil and bringing forth fruit and
[1:55:09] vegetables and herbs than Cain was
[1:55:12] because the curse was you shall go and
[1:55:15] and by the sweat of your brow bring
[1:55:16] forth food and Toil and thorns so Cain
[1:55:20] was fundamentally correct you know and I
[1:55:22] kind of imagine you know that they they
[1:55:25] they walked to the the Gate of the
[1:55:26] garden that day you know in unity and in
[1:55:29] harmony you know their arms are around
[1:55:31] one another and and Cain probably you
[1:55:34] know had a nice bushel basket of of
[1:55:36] fruits and things like that upon him you
[1:55:38] know just carrying it and and Abel was
[1:55:41] sitting there leading a lamb and and
[1:55:43] they probably went together and they
[1:55:46] they saw the the the entrance to the
[1:55:48] garden and and the the sword of the the
[1:55:50] Flaming sword of the cherubim guarding
[1:55:52] the way and they they began to offer
[1:55:56] their worship and their
[1:55:58] sacrifice Cain you know laid everything
[1:56:01] out very beautifully and you know Lord
[1:56:04] this is uh you know thank you for giving
[1:56:06] this to me thank you for this Harvest
[1:56:08] you know and I just offer it back to you
[1:56:11] but Abel Abel had something within him
[1:56:17] that said sh blood blood because it
[1:56:21] spoke of the sin but more than that more
[1:56:24] than that and I I I want you to to
[1:56:27] really see this
[1:56:28] now is God had a lamb slain before the
[1:56:33] foundation of the world in his mind and
[1:56:36] I I I I don't pretend to know exactly
[1:56:38] what that looked like in heaven I don't
[1:56:40] I kind of I don't really think that it
[1:56:41] was just blood and you know just up
[1:56:43] there in heaven but whatever it was
[1:56:45] whatever it was God had an image in his
[1:56:47] mind something that would would play out
[1:56:50] throughout the the course of time uh to
[1:56:54] to get to a certain spot and so when
[1:56:56] Abel somehow caught a vision of that
[1:56:59] somehow caught a revelation of that and
[1:57:01] sacrificed it God had to honor
[1:57:04] it because it spoke to the sin it spoke
[1:57:07] to what was in heaven it represented
[1:57:09] God's Vision before the foundation of
[1:57:11] the world and so God honored it because
[1:57:14] this this this word that he had spoken
[1:57:17] was becoming manifest
[1:57:20] amen the word that he had spoken in
[1:57:22] eternity that this is what my plan is
[1:57:25] and this is what it's going to be was
[1:57:27] now becoming in it being happening in
[1:57:30] flesh and it was being mimicked and
[1:57:32] replicated that this idea of sacrifice
[1:57:36] of
[1:57:39] blood and it wasn't the chemistry of the
[1:57:42] blood it wasn't you know anything about
[1:57:44] that but it was I think I really believe
[1:57:46] that it was just
[1:57:47] this playing out out of what was in
[1:57:50] God's mind and so he had to honor it
[1:57:56] amen it spoke of the sin of his parents
[1:57:59] being of blood sin and it spoke of what
[1:58:02] was in heaven and it spoke of the word
[1:58:04] of God coming from eternity and creating
[1:58:07] a life that would one day be sacrificed
[1:58:10] to cover all sin for all
[1:58:13] time and that blood was on the Altar and
[1:58:16] it was a product of the word of God you
[1:58:19] the the lamb that a that that Abel
[1:58:22] slew was a product of the word of God
[1:58:25] God said to every every beast of the
[1:58:27] field to bring forth after their own
[1:58:29] kind so that's God's word still in
[1:58:31] effect today that we see that's just
[1:58:33] just you just doesn't happen but that's
[1:58:36] that's God's word being fulfilled do you
[1:58:38] see it's just very simply it's God's
[1:58:40] word being
[1:58:41] fulfilled amen and so it was God's word
[1:58:44] when Abel slew that lamb it was God's
[1:58:47] word echoing then from the sixth day of
[1:58:49] creation that everything shall produce
[1:58:51] after its own
[1:58:53] kind hold on hold on to what I'm saying
[1:58:56] here I I I I I don't know that you're
[1:58:59] with
[1:59:02] me God word has to go forth until it has
[1:59:05] accomplished his
[1:59:08] purpose and until that word was made
[1:59:12] flesh and caused the man Jesus to do
[1:59:15] everything the father will and intended
[1:59:18] everything thing prophesied about
[1:59:21] him that word was just kind of just
[1:59:25] there waiting to be fulfilled I think
[1:59:28] the last time I was here I mentioned you
[1:59:29] know how how God spoke a word that there
[1:59:32] would that there would be a Vicki that
[1:59:34] there would be a Tim that there there
[1:59:36] would be a Charles there there would be
[1:59:38] a Brent and and that God's word was
[1:59:41] spoken in a time when there was no time
[1:59:45] and it just hung there until it was
[1:59:46] supposed to be
[1:59:48] fulfilled
[1:59:50] god brother brand now the the position
[1:59:52] of a believer in Christ but God before
[1:59:54] the foundation of the world for ordained
[1:59:56] that Jesus would come the perfect Lamb
[1:59:58] of God into a perfect cell that God
[2:00:01] himself
[2:00:02] created that was a spoken word of
[2:00:06] God hold hold with me
[2:00:08] now to bring
[2:00:11] blood into the world to offer that the
[2:00:15] blood the blood that houses life and
[2:00:18] through the tearing down
[2:00:20] of which was none other than the Holy
[2:00:23] Ghost himself after that offering of
[2:00:25] that
[2:00:26] man after the offering that man can come
[2:00:30] back and perfect the believer he brought
[2:00:34] Eternal
[2:00:35] Redemption I want you to catch out of
[2:00:37] that that that this created word this
[2:00:40] created word that God had spoke when the
[2:00:43] angel came to a young girl 13 14 years
[2:00:46] old and he and he began to talk to her
[2:00:49] and and rehearse God's words to her and
[2:00:52] say the the Holy Ghost shall overshadow
[2:00:54] you his words were spoken this he was
[2:00:57] the messenger of God his words were
[2:00:59] spoken and they just lay there just just
[2:01:02] hanging there until Mary said be it unto
[2:01:06] me and the moment she said be it unto me
[2:01:09] the words became life and became made
[2:01:13] into flesh and cells began to come
[2:01:16] together that were created cells began
[2:01:18] to multiply
[2:01:19] and a a body began to take shape and see
[2:01:23] while this was a a human body in human
[2:01:25] form it was perfectly created by God
[2:01:29] himself by his word it was it was human
[2:01:32] in the shape and the form of a human and
[2:01:34] yes he was a man but it was God's spoken
[2:01:38] word amen and so that blood was a spoken
[2:01:43] word in the beginning the word was uh
[2:01:46] the word was with God and the Word was
[2:01:47] God the same was in in the beginning
[2:01:49] with God and the Word was made flesh was
[2:01:52] made flesh and dwelt Among
[2:01:55] Us and amen I you know and I just wonder
[2:01:58] I'm I'm sorry for taking so long here
[2:02:00] and I'm blabbering this because I want
[2:02:02] you to be with me and you know and some
[2:02:05] I I sense a little bit of where's he
[2:02:07] going where's he getting we'll get there
[2:02:10] we'll get there I'm just kind of taking
[2:02:11] my time because I can I can feel
[2:02:14] that that you know I wonder sometimes if
[2:02:17] that the Holy Ghost that overshadowed
[2:02:20] Mary that spirit that surrounded her how
[2:02:23] much that's like the a woman who gets
[2:02:27] pregnant and she's pregnant and and all
[2:02:29] of a sudden she becomes you know more
[2:02:31] radiant more beautiful and brother
[2:02:33] Brandon we talk about that because that
[2:02:35] life is right next to her and I wonder
[2:02:37] that Holy Ghost just being there that
[2:02:39] theophany body of Jesus Christ just wa
[2:02:42] waiting and watching over
[2:02:46] her amen
[2:02:50] we can go back and find that before the
[2:02:52] foundation of the world a lamb was slain
[2:02:55] and blood was put on The Mercy Seat then
[2:02:58] God himself sacrificed the Lambs to
[2:03:00] cover his children Abel sacrificed the
[2:03:03] lamb to worship God and poured his life
[2:03:05] out and God tells Moses build an altar
[2:03:08] and sanctify it put Blood on the altar
[2:03:10] sprinkle it on the Altar and it's
[2:03:11] incredible you know if you go through
[2:03:13] the the Old Testament how much blood
[2:03:16] played played a role how much sacrifice
[2:03:18] played a role I think one time there was
[2:03:20] a king and he offered 30 30,000 animals
[2:03:23] of sacrifice I don't even know how there
[2:03:24] could be 30,000 animals for sacrifice in
[2:03:27] in one
[2:03:29] country blood everywhere can you imagine
[2:03:32] how much it must have
[2:03:34] smelled how awful it was the stench of
[2:03:36] manure from 30,000 animals in one place
[2:03:40] just one after the
[2:03:42] other sacrificed blood everywhere so
[2:03:45] much so that that we know that they cut
[2:03:48] channels in the ground at the sacrifice
[2:03:51] for the blood to run through and run
[2:03:53] off it didn't it wasn't just like one
[2:03:56] sacrifice and the blood soaked it into
[2:03:58] the ground there was so much blood so
[2:04:01] much blood because man was attempting to
[2:04:04] to connect with that sacrifice that God
[2:04:06] knew would come that in their hearts
[2:04:08] there there was something that they knew
[2:04:10] that that something great had to be
[2:04:12] offered to bring reconciliation to bring
[2:04:15] Redemption to cover the
[2:04:17] sin and I and I I would say this
[2:04:22] that I I'll just say it like brother
[2:04:24] brandom said it that Jesus he crawled up
[2:04:28] upon his altar on his wooden Altar and
[2:04:31] his blood was poured out of him he was
[2:04:35] sacrificed he was just completely
[2:04:38] stripped of
[2:04:39] everything and and his blood came
[2:04:42] pouring out and we were there you know
[2:04:45] we were there not only were we there in
[2:04:47] Christ when he he was crucified we were
[2:04:50] there in the ground every every mineral
[2:04:53] every atom everything that was needed to
[2:04:56] make us today was there and God his
[2:04:58] blood poured out and redeemed the Earth
[2:05:02] and all that was in
[2:05:03] it and he he paid the price and the
[2:05:06] penalty for us just as as people for
[2:05:09] every person that would accept his
[2:05:14] sacrifice and and you were there and
[2:05:17] everything that you you were made of
[2:05:19] was there and he climbed up on that
[2:05:20] wooden Altar for you and for
[2:05:24] me and that altar had to have a
[2:05:28] sacrifice it could it couldn't just be
[2:05:30] that you know God Jesus was up there and
[2:05:33] then came back down it required death
[2:05:37] and it required the
[2:05:40] blood his blood
[2:05:43] acknowledged
[2:05:45] everything it it acknowledged all the
[2:05:48] the sacrif IES that have been made from
[2:05:50] when God sacrificed the first lamb to to
[2:05:54] Abel to Moses through the the thousands
[2:05:57] and thousands of animals that were
[2:05:59] sacrificed Jesus's blood spilled upon
[2:06:01] the ground acknowledging what had been
[2:06:03] done but saying you don't have to
[2:06:05] sacrifice
[2:06:07] anymore this is the Redemption this is
[2:06:09] the reconciliation SE this is the
[2:06:13] reconciliation between God and man it
[2:06:15] was the spoken word becoming flesh the
[2:06:18] spoken word became blood it was spilled
[2:06:20] out upon the
[2:06:22] ground and it it is still in effect it's
[2:06:26] still an
[2:06:27] effect and it doesn't matter who you are
[2:06:30] or where you came from it doesn't matter
[2:06:31] what language you speak or what color
[2:06:33] you are when God looks at you and you
[2:06:37] believe he sees the blood on your
[2:06:41] altar so whatever you have need of
[2:06:45] whatever you have need of you can have
[2:06:46] it today because the blood has been
[2:06:50] applied all you have to do is believe
[2:06:53] the word of God than Lord you see the
[2:06:57] word is bleeding on your behalf the word
[2:07:00] has been crucified again in this day but
[2:07:03] the the original sacrifice is still
[2:07:05] there for you you know
[2:07:08] if let me say this you know if if we had
[2:07:11] just a a vial of the blood of Jesus just
[2:07:14] sitting here and we knew beyond the
[2:07:16] shadow of a doubt it had been passed
[2:07:17] down through the ages and somehow we had
[2:07:19] a vile of his blood it could do nothing
[2:07:23] for
[2:07:24] you all right it could do nothing for
[2:07:26] you even though the it because it had
[2:07:29] already accomplished the purpose for
[2:07:31] which it had been intended and you could
[2:07:33] put it on you anointed on your face you
[2:07:36] could put your finger in it it would do
[2:07:38] nothing for you because everything that
[2:07:40] you have need of has already been paid
[2:07:42] for has already been claimed has already
[2:07:45] been done for you and all you have to do
[2:07:48] is now
[2:07:50] accepted you were already healed you
[2:07:53] were already
[2:07:55] delivered all that requires for you
[2:07:57] today is to believe with all your heart
[2:08:00] and accept it and I believe that you
[2:08:03] could have anything that you want in his
[2:08:05] name this
[2:08:06] morning and that's how he can say that
[2:08:09] you're the Spotless bride of Jesus
[2:08:12] Christ because of the
[2:08:15] blood he his sacrifice
[2:08:19] brother brandom says this he said if
[2:08:21] there's no sacrifice on the
[2:08:23] altar then the prayers cannot be
[2:08:27] received it's only by the blood on the
[2:08:30] sacrificial altar that lets prayers go
[2:08:33] through to
[2:08:34] God now think about that and consider
[2:08:37] it what's on your
[2:08:41] altar what's on your altar this
[2:08:44] morning is it faith in the word of God
[2:08:48] is the blood on your
[2:08:50] altar or are you too consumed with fear
[2:08:54] and with
[2:08:56] life what's what's on your altar this
[2:09:03] morning why don't you stand with me and
[2:09:06] we'll just try to
[2:09:10] close it is
[2:09:13] essential
[2:09:14] believe the word of that God has sent
[2:09:18] and that there's blood on your altar we
[2:09:21] have to walk when we see the word moving
[2:09:24] we have to go after it amen as we walk
[2:09:27] in the light as he is in the light then
[2:09:29] we have Fellowship one with another and
[2:09:30] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[2:09:32] from all
[2:09:34] sin there's no room in this day for
[2:09:39] fear there's no room today for anxiety
[2:09:43] there's no room today for for doubt and
[2:09:46] disbelief and questions and and make
[2:09:49] believe and make pretend there's no room
