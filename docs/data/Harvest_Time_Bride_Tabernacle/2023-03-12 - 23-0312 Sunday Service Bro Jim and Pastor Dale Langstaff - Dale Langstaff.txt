and with us and then we'll be next Sunday we'll be back on our normal more normal schedule maybe but uh but I want to share this with you and this should encourage all of us you know brother Branham said if you were a carp in the ocean even though you got caught in the gnat of Satan you're still a carp in that net don't change your identity and every one of us who got caught in a net called Satan but if you were a carp before you got caught you're still a cart and God knows how to undo the net amen and that is just that just I just bless I actually use that in one of our messages there just bless my heart wants a carp always a carp amen you might be out of Fellowship you might be caught in a net but you're still a cart amen God will never throw you back when you're a car amen so we're just going to enjoy brother Jim and his experiences and his songs and that and we just asked you to trust that you'll be blessed amen amen praise the Lord well it's good to be home it's quite an experience damn what's what it's like over there guys I should turn this on okay yep green light I got the green light brother [Laughter] that means go well since I got the guitar I think I'll sing a

to walk on stormy seas [Applause] I am strong when I am foreign [Music] God bless you one and all ah well brought a deal you asked me to give a testimony which is good until this morning that's all I was going to do then I had to go to I had to get up and uh something that was I was getting what we call an inspiration so I couldn't leave it alone so I got up grabbed my Bible and I got some verses but uh I want to talk about my my well my experiences there in Uganda it is unbelievable you seen the pictures you seen the pictures when you're there it's live and it's a total different experience than just watch it see we we can look at the pictures okay when we look at the pictures I do that too look at the pictures and then go home and forget about it when you're there you can't forget about it you're there you see it sister Luanne that was your first time since my my second time you know something that I noticed by the deal is uh when we were there three years ago because of the accident I mean that kept us going in uh occupied for all but just about two weeks there and we did leave uh we didn't leave the uh Michiana hey good brother we then leave Michiana and uh so but this time we did we had a chance to go elsewhere visit three churches and it is such a blessing I told I told the people I says I'm taking you the joy and your smiles with me when I go I I it's it's hard you know you can't compare yeah I'm giving a testimon here you can't compare them with us that's such a difference you cannot compare the things that I I got to share with you some of the things that I noticed you you know you I kind of shake my head because you know it's like they're living in the 1940s 1930s 1940s the house everything I mean you saw a picture of uh this family that uh uh is uh is there Kleenex here no oh good good okay uh the family that lives in the school room just that law you sister think about this one okay you haven't got a stove you haven't got a hot plate all you do is you go outside light a fire and that's it that's your stove day after day after day and you've seen that family they're not you know she's got kids husband and uh when we uh when we took it to the house there right behind the church and she had tears in her eyes and I I you know and that touched me but we went inside and looked at the the house uh you know and she had tears in her eyes she was so Overjoyed I believe inside you know to to be able to have at her home a house you know for the family and uh I I was looking around looking at the house and that and my goodness but the thing is they don't have very much and what they do have it's it's it's very special to them you know it it's like you know growing your own crops and that's it what you eat today is what you grow with today or to for tomorrow oh what I noticed see I noticed two um I noticed the machine when we were traveling there I noticed that some Machinery they had it was pretty looked pretty good some big machineries and graders and you know things like that I thought well that's I don't know where it comes from maybe it was donated by China maybe or given by China built roads over there from what I heard but for the most part they they live right off the land whatever they can do and it's not like here you know you want some meat you can go in the forest if it's seasoned get a deer they can't do that over there they don't even have a gun and most of them don't have a gun or a license to do and they wouldn't do it anyway so it's it's quite it's quite something I notice when we're traveling on the road brother Dale that they were doing some construction on the road remember that I couldn't believe now what I'm saying is I'm not putting the people down okay if I'm putting anybody down it's the government it's like it's politicians the government okay now that I want to go on on record saying that it's not the people but as we're traveling they were doing construction on the road they were leaving uh uh giving putting pavement on the road and I couldn't really they had a strip looked like tar to me I think tar yeah it has tar on the road okay and then what is I forget they had a dump truck brother I what was in it that was it's powder form it was like a powder it's like they're going to spread it out and it's going to stick to the tire and it's going to get hard and that's your pavement yeah you know you do that over here they'd be laughing their heads off at you if you try to do something like that here the roads but and another thing too that struck me and I uh is when we were staying at brother Leo's house I'm just standing outside I was looking at the front door just above the front door maybe 10 feet up I could not believe what I saw they had wires bare wires no covering no panel bare wires hooked on and I looked at it and I said my goodness you know if you live in the in the time where they had tubes and knobs that's pretty well what they they have there yeah that's how far back they are the homes everything the thing is though that I want to bring across to you is this is even with the situation the way it is people are still happy you know you you got to go there to experience not just the environment the local and the area but the people the people and it's quite it's it's quite an experience I said before I came back I said we were still in Uganda I said I probably won't be coming back but I might I might if I if I got it right from you know who the Lord uh I might be going back but I couldn't I couldn't see it after we went through we visited the churches and that I thought no it's not gonna you know we're not gonna go back but uh or I won't go back but uh but again it's it's quite something and I'm glad for this because I think I'm gonna I'm gonna go over it with the wife and show her you know everything that we went we've seen in her and uh well uh there's there is I do have a thought that inspiration I do have something so I and uh it's not going to take long but there's something that and I know I mentioned uh when I was there I mentioned something that some have it and some don't have it if you know what I mean and it's very much present over there you don't see it too much here because you know you got the middle glass over there it's poor Rich foreign Rich that's it and you can tell who's got it who has you know and it's sad to say that you know what I've seen and what I heard and what I felt over there it's sad to say that some that have it profess them to be Christians believers okay keep them to themselves and and that was my that's what I had this morning I I said it morning good morning good to see you I just want to read some scriptures uh if you want to stand Matthew I want to turn to Matthew 10. okay 10 26 and 27 verses 26 and 27. and it reads like this 26 27 fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered then not thou shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known what I tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what you hear in the ear that preach ye upon the house stops may the Lord has blessing to the reading of this word you may be seated so verse 27 it says and that preach ye upon the house stops don't we need that you know the scripture says correction starts at the house of God as long as this the house of God you know if it's anointed by God to be the host of God I'll say it that way now I'm not here to judge you know churches people not to but just to preach the word when I was when I was there wrote a deal they kept saying pastor Jim Pastor Jim I said because I'm not a pastor I'm a teacher that's my that's my Ministry okay I'm a teacher so I just want to lay on record so so okay so appreciate it on the house stops you know the Bible says you know if there's if there's something to be said if God wants something said then he has to uh he has to get somebody to speak for him and there's there's things that I've seen as things that I heard that really bother that it bothered me to a certain extent and and I believe that God cares cares about his word cares about his people their children and he cares about those that don't have it as well as those that have it now God blesses you you know if you uh you reap what you sow if you sow much you'll read much but if you re if you sow little you read little now that's the law of God especially too when you go to Malachi where it says that you open the windows of Heaven if wife you obey the word so if you bear the word you'll open the windows of heaven so some people are really blessed and I thank God for that now I'm talking about people in this message not denominations out there okay people in Vietnam in in this message that if God has blessed you and I probably this is going live that's good if this you know if if God has blessed you well thank God for that but the thing is that bothered me when I was there because I heard this and bothers me now is that some have it a lot and some don't have it in this message somebody came to brother Brenham and offer them a million dollars he refused it you know he could have been a very rich man because all the money that came he says he had checks coming in and he would sign them got in trouble with the tax man because of that because he didn't do it right but all those checks and everything that he signed and the money you know he only took what he needed to survive to live on that's all just what he had what and everything else went to the people you know when I was thinking about this brother Dale I was thinking you know if I let's say just to clarify to to let you know where I'm going say I had two uh two dollars in my pocket all right I have two dollars and I can live on one dollar today now Jesus says think take no thoughts of tomorrow because there's enough evil today so in other words don't worry about tomorrow okay so I have I have one dollar and that's going to be enough for me to get by today what about the other dollar give it to somebody that doesn't have it see that's my way of looking at it you know if we Brothers says eternal life eternal life is living for others now if we're living for others shouldn't we care so much more than we do for others going to Uganda opened my eyes brothers and sisters it opened my eyes uh I mean even if it's the second time there but it really opened my eyes especially this trip that we went by now it just opened my eyes now I'm going to read uh there's two other scriptures I want to get to uh let's go to first John excuse me let's go to first John and verses 17 and 18. now I'm just going to go on my Bible here so bear with me First John 3 chapter 3 and verses 17 and 18. okay remember I don't know if you remember brother Dale when we were there I said you know like some habits some don't why don't they chair some of the wealth those that have it they don't need all that only what they need to survive and so that was when I woke up this morning it was like okay yeah I remember thinking I said you know I even said why don't you know you get five you know we have to pay for our way there which that's fine with me yeah I'm okay but the thing is you can't do that all the time where are you going to get the money even if you have a million dollars you keep going pretty soon you don't have a million dollars you know it's simple but the thing is is that you know if you get five churches over there brother five churches in Uganda they could sponsor somebody like brother Dale or somebody to go no problem pay all these expenses now and it was it was this morning was on my mind now I just want to read some scriptures chapter 3 verses 17 and 18. that the whoso had this world's good and see it his brother have need and shudded up his vows of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him and 18. my little children let us not in love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth shouted up his bottles of compassion from how dwell at the love of God in him we met I met some preachers are well off over there I've met some preachers that are not well off and they're pastors they're all pastors most I think all of them were pastors the ones we met all that so they have churches they have responsibilities they have a congregation I look at brother Vincent you know in this situation barely you might say well he lives off the land right gross whatever he eats he's asked to grow and then I get I see some other pastors preachers pretty well off I met some when I look at this scripture I'll dwell at the love of God in him when they see a brother that they're going to spend eternal life one day on the other side right now where where's the word of God how does how does God look at that that's that's my question how does God look at something like this okay okay turn to uh Matthew 16 27. Matthew 16 27. here's your answer for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father and his with his angels then he shall reward every man according to his works what have you done with the talent what have you done with what I've given you you see your brother I'm just kind of give you a story in storyline you see your brother in need you shut up your bowels from him you got more than you need to to get by to to to live and you see that a brother that hasn't got he's he hasn't got a meal like he might he might have a meal one day one one meal a day so this scripture here Matthew 16 27 for the son and that shall come the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works now this doesn't mean salvation that means that what have you done with God what God has given you and I I see that and you know that's just one place Uganda that's just one place how many third world countries are or places what about here in Canada now I'm not I'm not judging you this church because you've done so much I know this firsthand this church has done so much to help brother sister I've seen it so you know in the it you know for for the internet whoever's watching in the internet this church has done tremendously for the people so we're not get I don't want to be guilty I don't want to be guilty of uh like brother Vincent you know that to see uh to go there and to see him suffer it like that and just walk away you know we we helped we helped brother Vincent I should say the brother Dale while we were all there brother Jose it was it was it was just beautiful we had the means to do that we had to meet to do that I'm not asking for five churches over there to sponsor me to come over and preach you know okay no I'm not but it be God's will wouldn't that be the right way to do it right but you know it's it's you know where they at now for me financially now I got to pay my Visa off so it's not Max I didn't max it but I gotta pay you know I gotta pay my Visa off which is fine I I'm not worried about it I will I will with the Lord's help you know in all things I will so but my point is this okay that when we were there that that did bother me brother brother Dale not to the extent that it does now because you might say God has laid this on my shoulders as a burden okay to what to preach it from the housetops to preach it from the house stops if I have to Wherever I Go can you take if if you have whoever it is whoever it is if you have so much and more than what you need to get by to live on but you see your brother struggling no food no money they don't have they don't get government assistance over there it's you know brother Dale you know it sister Luanne mug you go over there and try to live the way they do you wouldn't stay there very long you come back you would come back the next day you would come back because it's not an easy life but the people the people are they they just they don't know they don't know what you give up they don't know giving up is what it means to give up because we were there and nothing has changed very much from the time that we went three years ago to this this uh this year nothing has changed that I could see nothing in Michiana nothing is the same so my point is this to you and to whoever is listening in is one day you'll have to answer to almighty God you'll have to answer is and and I want to read the scripture again for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works one day we'll all stand before Jesus and you'll say what have you done I gave you talents when have you done whatever it might be it might be a gift that you have you know the Bible talks about talents the three towns to Ten Ten thousands five times one Talent okay what have you done well what I've given you I bless you and it's not it's not just I will say it's not just wealth as in money or land but what have you done with what the gift that I've given you to be a blessing to be a blessing whatever yes it's like let's say in the church here okay like you know brother Matt uh God bless you for standing I I did song leading for 25 years so I know what it's like I know as I know when I started song leading I felt like crawling under the rugs so I don't know if you went through it but I did but I did it for 25 years so I know what it's like and everything that goes with it and it's bless you for doing it you know the the young boys I want to give credit to where it's due your own boys here playing the what you call the flute I got it right that's that's keep it up brother you know that's an instrument God has blessed you that way you play it play it for the glory of God remember that don't play it for anything else but for the glory of God amen and God will keep blessing you and and uh he'll make you where you can play the flute like nobody else but God has blessed you so so again I I have to kind of you know say this you know what's fair nothing is fair in this world nothing is fair you don't know what it is even in their own country now we get you know we're talk you know the the government over there and over here oh this is like day and night you know they keep the money over there they don't give it to the people here you get subsidies and you know the you're not going to starve you're not going to go you might have you might get a meal one one meal a day but don't worry you know no here the government takes care of his people and you know in a way but over there no so see how blessed we are today here in this country over there is totally different and my point is this that it's happening in the name of the message of the hour where you have some people that God has blessed them tremendously and you know God bless you for that but don't forget your brother and I seen it in Uganda and like I said this goes on in other countries too I mean I've heard stories you know of of preachers being millionaires millionaires in those countries uh and it's it's just unbelievable it's just unbelievable I I I shake my head I shake my it's going to be short this is going to be short you know I'm almost done but I just want to just want to let you know that you know this is this this is going on and the scripture says okay that every man according to his Works will receive a reward or criticism from the Lord Jesus Christ because all one one day we're going to step on the other side don't go see our brothers and sisters and that's going to come in into view you know he might he might even say he said see your brother over there I remember one day he will say that to whoever he'll say that remember there was a time that he had need and you were able to meet that need you know I said to brother Dale when we were there it says you know you see your brother I have need and you're able to help him you're able to help him whatever it is then help him don't walk away you say I'll pray for you God bless you I'll pray for you why see you know you know it's it to me is like it's like if we're going to be like the word says which is Christ's like word then we should be doing what the word says to me to me to me that that's is it's like uh I there's the division it seemed like there's the division going on in the message where you have those that have a lot and those that don't have it and and I said you know I I asked you uh brother Dan and I remember asking you you know all these preachers these pastors that came like are they all agreeing together or are they you know they all came for the dedication but do they agree with each other is there a unity in other words I doubt it I doubt it that there's a Unity over there that like it should be like it's it's like okay well you know they were invited so they came some of them or they all came those everybody imagine but some came because what for a show or maybe they wanna who knows get disciples after themselves who knows who knows but the thing is is that when you have see out there in the world okay and denominations I remember watching this uh video on on YouTube about preachers in denominations unbelievable what their the wealth that they have it's beyond anything that you can imagine billionaires not just millionaires billionaires okay and they what they're taking the money falsely to me falsely they're they're 10 they're given to people what uh Commandments of men Bible says and the people are swallowing it being deceived now we know the elect cannot be deceived so we know that so that's our that's the word of God that's our Safeguard but that's that's going on out there but you know the brother Brennan said this he says he won't leave you the devil won't leave you alone he'll bring somebody in or raise somebody in the congregation to cause problems okay so he won't he won't leave you alone so the thing is is that who is he going to attack he is going to attack the ministry now I'll take myself okay say uh all of a sudden one day I I feel like well I I should have a lot of money in this and that so what can you know how how can I do it my you know be popular or whatever okay you know three things that Birdman says that can ruin a Ministry you know women bunny popularity well say I did that okay now I know and I don't take credit for this okay bro you're my brothers and sisters I can I say this okay uh I know I do have a gift I I know I do I do okay I sing songs that people get blessed in that okay now that's the gift I could use that for my own good I could go on there in the world and sing and and and uh you know use that gift uh uh Elvis Presley did that he was raised in the Pentecostal Church in the system and he he uh he used this gift that he had what to make money be popular well I probably could do it but no I don't want to do that I'm not very much I don't have very much talent anyway on the guitar I I've seen people uh uh people play the guitar a lot better than than I do so you know but the thing is is that it's not it's not being able to play the guitar see it's not that the talent that I can do Jim LeBlanc I can be popular make money no is the gift God uses a gift to bless you see so it's it's the anointing you know David had a a a a a a gift from God he would play on his harp and and uh uh Saul the the the the evil spirits would leave Saul well that was a town that was something David had a gift for that now I I'm not totally comparing me to you know myself to David but the thing is is I've seen it I mean how many years 36 37 years now that since I heard the message and the first thing I did was play played the guitar and play and I seen uh services that that you know that happened but it you know the gift is not for me it's for the people I told the Lord I said let's keep me humble keep me humble because that's the only way that I can be a blessing to the people and and he asked he has kept me humble with everything that's been going on so to conclude short but conclude is this what you do with what God has blessed you with you'll have to answer to him the Lord Jesus Christ one day when we step on the other side everyone and I'm talking about the children of God with your brothers and sisters everyone will stand before the Lord as the scripture says every man according to his words and I don't want to be one to stand before Jesus and say do you remember your brother here you had need you were able to give them something even a penny whatever you know it's like I said about the two dollars if I got two dollars I can I can live today on the dollar what do I do with the other dollar when I see my brother could use it see so this church again this church has been a blessing to the people there and I've seen it I've been part of it and it's one I I'm glad because going over there and we're able to travel that was so nice to be able to travel other churches especially when you see brother Vincent and brother Sunday and they are smiling they greet you and you know what's the prize with me when we went to Brother Vincent he had food for us when we went to the orphanage they had I didn't expect it I didn't it did ask me I said no no no no no no no no keep that for yourselves but they had enough offering it was an offer so it's not to criticize anybody anywhere that I say these things it's not the greatest like it's just that it's there and I see it and the Lord laid it on my heart and I have to say it I know I remember brother Dale you were you said a few things yourself yeah that scripture that I remember you're you had that scripture one time you hit it real hard and you know yeah yeah and and I don't know what more can I say but I would exhort I would encourage you get on your knees before God almighty and for first of all repent ask him to turn you around and that you look if you see your brother in need give it to him give it to him yeah amen God bless you short message but praise the Lord but but I I have to before I went to Uganda the Lord did lay on my heart three messages and I did I preached two over there so I still got one left so maybe I'll preach it over there I don't know man God bless let's all stand let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we're so glad we're so glad to know you Lord and to have an experience with you and that's what you want lord it's a life lived and Lord God we thank you Lord for your precious word Lord that not only gives us joy and happiness but it also it gives it it brings correction in our own lives Lord I I look at myself and what I can or can't do or things that you know that I see in your word and I know you're laid this burden on my heart that to care for others that have that struggle every day and I've seen that in Uganda and it's it's everywhere all over the world but there's only so much so much that anyone can do one person can do for that matter but Lord you're not able there's nothing No Limit what you can do and Lord I commit Lord that what I said today committed to you Lord to the people here whoever's listening in that it might strike their hearts Lord God and turn them around Lord

to step on the other side and you you say to us Lord and turn to the joys of the lord lord we'll just step in in 200 into eternity Lord God I ask in Jesus name amen amen amen well I don't have a song amen letters [Music] be pleasing to you all praise pray let everything I pursue be pleasing O Lord unto you let's sing it again oh yes please please say let me be pleased [Music] then I dare be pleasing to you pray let everything that I person be pleased [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah if it'd be all right I might just add to brother Jim's for a minute you can have your seats which is still I didn't know how long brother Jim would would share or just uh I like to look at that scripture that brother Jim just for a moment I'm not I'm just I'm just adding to what he what his brother Jim had said and and I appreciate what brother Jim said about youth here in the church have have done mountains we've moved mountains amen and in no way is this a a condemning message to you can't can the word of God can't condemn somebody that's already doing what the word of God has said amen so it's it you know what I mean like brother Brown said if the shoe fits where are they man you're already wearing this shoe so amen and so this is not a personal thing at all but if we looked at uh uh one First John 3 where uh brother Jim read and I would have loved to just to read the verse before where he read it in verse 16. and why we're looking for that to hear our Prophet said this he said if you want to do something for God do something for his people and he said if you want something good said about you say something good about someone else if you want to be blessed then bless somebody else amen if you're a blessing Jesus said it and then the prophet adds us he said and Jesus said in so much that you've done it for the least of these you've done it unto me and brother Jim read this scripture and and when I popped it up of course I have my favorite scriptures highlighted everywhere I go on my Bible they're painted and on my phone they're painted and on my iPad they're painted and here this is just a scripture I had to wear brother brother Jim read he said hereby perceive that we weed the love of God because he laid down his life and ought we not to lay down our life for the brother and I'm going to read if you if you let me read a quote that goes just beautifully along with that here just let me uh pull it up here uh first the second just along that same line here's the prophet preaching amen and and uh I'm just find it here so amen and here's here's the profit you can leave this scripture up because it goes along perfectly and here here's the prophet said on that day on Calvary in 60 and he says and it gives you after the condition his Spirit to follow him and do as he did for others is following on just he he was just the man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for us and here he's talking about God leaving the Splendor of Heaven and lay down his life on Calvary and and he and he closes to the Tabernacle and he said Tabernacle don't miss this he said if you give something and you expect to be noticed if you expect like some kind of gratitude or you expect well like you you did it mentally well I can see they're not well off so I'll give them okay and he said that's not how Christ did it it was just completely unconditional he never it was something it was just like he never even thought about it he was doing it before he realized he was doing it he said that's how he laid down his life on Calvary for you if it's all right I'll just finish reading this uh this quote here he said now the first thing we want to say is that Jesus never lived for himself he his life was spent for others and that's perfectly eternal life and when you say uh you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life for yourself you haven't got eternal life eternal life is living for others and it proves it when you come to the Lamb of God he said he lived and had eternal life because he had he did not live his life for himself he lived it for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live yourself no more this is a beautiful quote he's and this is I mean this blessed my heart he said you live for others some someone said he said how do you stand and let someone call you bad names I'll tell you what this had brother Dales the taxes it did brother Mike I failed bitterly in this he said you're not living for yourself he said it don't matter that you call me bad names because I'm not alive you can you can say anything you want about brother Dale because it don't affect brother Dale because brother Dale's nature ain't here oh buddy he had my attention he said God help me he said you don't live for yourself he said your life is for others that you might redeem that man that's saying the bad words about you oh buddy and you can't you become sons and the trouble of it is is the church has forgotten their sons he said you're a son and you're talking and you're taking Christ's place and you're the son that don't live for itself so you're living for others and they said well brother Branham I can live for my brother because he is sure a nice man he said that's not it he said try living for the man that hates you and live for the person that he would kill you if he could get away with it oh buddy he had my attention he said that's what they done to him Christ oh buddy God help me brother Dale he said they killed him and he died that he might save them the ones that killed him and give them eternal life if they would accept it and he said then you that's in you than you that's in you your bosom and your face in heaven then wow he's now let's just we're just going to the next paragraph I hope this helps you to get to the place he said what that's what the Tabernacle he's talking about Brown Tabernacle he said that's what all the people needs has got to do is to find out what you are and what's your purpose the church isn't going to church just like by playing music and singing songs but the church is a place where correction is judgment begins in the house of God brother Jim mentioned that he said you must reckon with yourself you must reckon Yourself Dead and see if your dad in Christ and somebody comes up and just as murdering your character but your character's already dead see you're packing Christ's character and see they're not talking about Christ's character they're talking about your old character but you don't care because you're you've already left your old character and you've laid it down whoa wow this was just like amazing he said we must reckon ourselves dead and alive in Christ and then he made a way that we could sacrifice ourself to his service and see when your sacrifice to Christ and somebody comes up and says you know that brother Dale he's got a lot of issues and you could just say yup he sure does but he's dead amen I'll tell you what that's when you get to the point that you're being shot at and you don't mind it you realize that you're not there no more I tell you what God help me you can say all you want to say but when you literally get attacked and you can just say oh praise God hallelujah thank the Lord wow amen then he made a way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him and if we follow him we lead the life that he lived that's wonderful now let's just jump ahead and I skipped one paragraph and he said he said and the goats and he said to the goats he said depart from me because I was hungry and he fed me and I was in problem in prison and you never visited me and closed me and I and let's just jump but he said to the Sheep I was hungry and you fed me this this is the part I want you to get and I was without clothes and you closed me and he said watch what he says to the Sheep that's what the prophet said he said you will notice that the Sheep said Lord Lord when did we ever feed you when did we ever close you he said they never realized they were even doing it because it was so unconscious you know this ain't just about money this is you go to the store and you see an old Larry carrying two bags of groceries and you hold the door for her hello that's just a life that you just she's struggling I don't slip on the ice here let me take your you didn't have to preconceive and think about that that was just courtesy that was Christ amen and he said he said you will notice that notice and don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done that the people didn't even know that they were in the line of duty and the man that gives you something or another because he ought to do what that man feeds you because he ought to do it because it's a selfish idea oh I'm helping God's kingdom because God needs me oh you're making God throw up laughs Hallelujah he said it's a self he said it should be your very life your very action and it was so surprising to the sheep that they said Lord when were you hungry and we never ever fed you when were you hungry how did we feed you or naked and we clothed you and he said and you were thirsty and we give you drink he said watch this it's the last paragraph and I'm just going to read a scripture in close he said it was so automatically out of love that your life lived in them and he said God let the people see thy Calvary what he did for us was automatic god Jehovah seen that these people don't have no hope and it was just automatic I can fix it Boop and we are him oh wow let's just read this scripture oh my goodness we've already read it actually my very next Christian on my iPad was John 1 3 16 amen I'll perceive ye I'll I'll buy ye perceive the love of God because he laid down his life for the Brethren whosoever has the world good and seeth his brother in need shut us up as vows of compassion onto him withholdeth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in the word neither in tongue amen and indeed and in truth that's beautiful beautiful scripture God help us amen that that that that that word from or that was just beautiful and bless me tremendously tremendously we've all been attacked at different times oh well that person has a problem and you found out you found out around about the bent and it's hurt you and it's and you don't have to lie to me because you're human and it's hurt me too but you know what when how the prophet said he said you know what when we get to the point that it don't even Hurt No More because you know what like you that's that's like that's like that's Supernatural I haven't been there before when I've had those tests I pray to God that when he was in the next test I'll handle a lot different amen God help us you know God help us it was just uh God help me Amen to portray that amen just and and we're not just talking about money just you know like there's just so many things like just showing up I said about brother Jim going or or sister Wango and those people just knowing that you were willing to be there amen it was like just knowing that God was willing to leave the Splendor of heaven and come to Earth that's a pretty awesome part amen and just to think like like he said we went to Pastor Vincent's like we're in a mud hut on a mud floor and he had a table spread with the tablecloth with all kinds of food and he sent food home with me and I'm still eating them in my living room see see automatic they don't even have nothing to give but you give it because because it wasn't even perceived in their thoughts amen God help us amen you know I mean I mean closed with this you know there I I think I mentioned there was a sister there couple sisters that I told Luanne to go investigate one sister had been born like that and one sister had a big sore on her leg and I believe it was cancer they told us afterwards I didn't know this at the time I did not know it at the time and so uh she didn't speak a lick of English not a lick of English see what most people do but she did not she was all their their language brother Jim was right there and I and so I went got Pastor Leo and I said you know I wanted to know if she was from the area because we would have went to Michiana and Luanne could have bought her some nice sabs and stuff and put on it and bandage it because it was literally a sort am I exaggerating it looked like that big about that type it was big and her whole leg from there below her knee and her foot was all swelled up believe me it it looked in cruciating in pain and when she went to get prayed for at the altar she was I think the dad last person to leave I believe to us if not she was the second last amen anyway so I I got Pastor Leo and Leo said no no she's from a long ways away she came from three hours away so she's not from here so we were unable to see her on Monday and we through you and the church and brother Jim and everybody everybody's a part of this because it's not a it's not a one-man Ministry at all and so I told brother Leo I said we're going to give her some money and and and I want to show you because brother Jim mention stuff like this and you know when you send your money yourself that's the best like brother Jim did things himself and he knows exactly what God laid on his heart you see what I mean but the next best is said it was somebody that you fully trust and will give you a report that's called being a good steward so by the pastor Leo said and I trust Pastor Leo literally was my bank account but Pastor Leo said why don't we give it to her pastor I said pastor Leo why do we got to give it to her pastor it's her that's packing the sore leg I don't need to send it through a pastor that might skim something off the top maybe would maybe wouldn't it I mean it's quite obvious that like you might give money to a pastor and say share this with your people and he because you don't know the needs but this is very obvious I mean we know the needs and he said okay why don't we give her and he mentioned the number 50. and I said why don't we give her double that 100. Matt see when you're there yourself it's God's holy spirit in you that's leading you the footsteps of the righteous are just and you you are protecting watch this you are protecting God's heritage personally the god in you is protecting the god in them and it all comes together it's beautiful let's stand let's stand amen amen next Sunday we'll we'll get this out of our system and move on but it's good to have a report and you know in the future I was also blessed by Brother something else brother Jim said because it kind of made me sad to think that you know I I know brother Jim had said and I know he give a lot I know that and that and brother Jim had said come back said I'll probably never come back you know because of different reasons but I was glad he'd kind of like lighten that a little bit this morning said maybe amen God this way you know and I know some cannot go and if you got small kids or families or or in different stages of life life is different but if you can go you will never ever be the same it's not possible and what brother Jim said you can look at those pictures all day long and that's one thing that we're going to do and and I encourage Vicki to do this is I told Vicki and this is just for your this is I'm we're closing but I said you know we've been on uh yeah I think I've been five different places by God's grace and we also had our daddy and we have many many pictures and and videos and I said we're going to put them all on one stick and we're going to hook up a screen that can just go through the pictures I've been to I've been to Africa three times and I've been to the Philippines twice and plus we have our church done case and I said you never look at those pictures unless you put them in a stick and they just randomly play through the service like it's not like it's important it's not like you're trying to relive your past but it's part of the family of God it's part of your journey to glory amen part of your journey to glory and amen we give God thanks and we just praise him for the privilege to to be in his family and to serve him and and to serve them with you people is the greatest blessing we'll ever have on this Earth this greatest blessing to have brothers and sisters that love us and are traveling the journey together amen and we have but one goal and that's for us to all to make it there some wonderful day amen I I do believe with all my heart and I have quote some iPad just studying this week amen where brother Bram said when he was here he said you're running out of time we're at the door and of course we all know we are so very very close and then it'll be let's sing that family of God Actually honey let's sorry let's shoot inside let's sing that song brother Matt saying and we'll sing the first and the last verse of uh a child of the team man I was thinking when brother Maddie you pull that first verse up you know my father's Rich that's our heavenly father and he owns everything if you're serving him in the proper way everything he'd give you was a blessing from God you never received nothing on your own strengths just try just try to make some money and not breathe with the air he give you I mean I just try to hold down your job and just not breathe like say well God I don't need your oxygen that's no problem I can do it on my own yeah right yeah and he hold us the wealth of everything amen if you have that attitude you'll be the happiest person whether you have it or don't have it or you give it or don't get it amen it was all gods to begin with it's not mine like I ain't taking none of it with me to the kingdom of God Amen this is beautiful we're singing the first this verse and the last verse my father is rich in houses and lands [Music] I pray s and diamonds

scriptures that I would have read he had already read Lord Jesus on my thoughts you know that as I looked on him this morning Lord Jesus and we just praise you for your leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus and we ask the Lord Jesus that you'll bless the ones that are represented here and even the ones that are out because of the day or weather maybe even sickness or travel Lord Jesus but bless them abundantly Lord Jesus just in their spiritual walk with you and reveal yourself unto us Lord Jesus and even meet our needs whether health or Jesus or our finances Lord Jesus and we praise you for the great opportunity serve you Lord Jesus and bless your name and your beautiful name we pray be with the bride of Christ around the world Lord Jesus we pray for mercy and Grace on each predestinated seed and may your divine inspiration and divine anointing follow your bride and your family your beautiful name we pray amen amen
