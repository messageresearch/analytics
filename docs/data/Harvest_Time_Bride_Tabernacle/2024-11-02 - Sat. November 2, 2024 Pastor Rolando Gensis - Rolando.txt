promises us that you would never pass by your elect for Lord in our own self we're nothing but you in amazing grace before the foundation of the world elected a bride oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Blessed Be Your Name Lord we thank you for this great opportunity to be in your house tonight Lord many are out for different reasons Lord but we're here and we're here to hear from your throne tonight Lord God and we pray that you'll raise your servant and and strengthen him and and over saddle him Lord God and may may we understand that we're it's the throne coming from the Throne of God and we'll give you the praise and glory for it for all of eternity Lord Jesus we pray amen amen you may have your seats for just a moment I I ask the musicians to St I want to sing uh we have come into his house house to magnify his name and worship him we just thank you from the bottom of our hearts for coming and God is good and we just uh it's amazing to have friends and to be a part of the family of God and you know there's many out of the home church for different reasons and activities and sisters Patty's mom had fell bad and she was going to see her at the hospital and different brother Jim and Junior will be here tomorrow and but we just know that God knew exactly who would be here and it was who was part of his plan and and it's an amazing message amazing truth that we have been blessed to be a part of and understand this Revelation I want to just share something just for a moment I know you didn't come to hear me and I didn't come to hear me either just a moment before we sing that song and invite our brothers we we preached a message on Sunday that I believe some people misunderstood and I want to quote something that brother Bram said when I preached on this he said that don't sound very good to you and he said I don't think you're getting it and in this message that we ministered on brother Bram mentioned this word 618 times and he never mentioned it once until 53 now his recording start what 45 and every year he mentioned it more and more and more when he got to 59 he mentioned a lot when he got to 60 he mentioned it almost every message 62 and 63 and that word is predestinated and let me read you a quote that brother Brown said you know he said humanity is always trying to do something to get saved but you never did nothing to be saved the minites are a lot more holy than the holiest person in this church that's hard for you to swallow but that's still the truth watch what the prophet said here he said there's a way my dear precious Nazarene brothers and so far you've left the mark why you're falling because you never moved with the light now brother Bram called preach destination a revelation you call election predestinated a revelation because you refuse to walk with the light that's exactly right that's exactly right he repeats it and he said you know the first altar that I ever kneeled at was an old Nazarene altar God bless them they're good holy clean people but you are so legalistic that you go and you must do this and you must do that and you must do the other and you don't realize that it's the grace that God that called you and elected you and it's not by them that willth or them that runneth but it's God it's not brother Dale but it's God that show us mercy and it's God that predestinated his church before the foundation of the world and we got a question on that in a few minutes and he said you can't take the thought and add one cubic to your stature no you can come and you can accept me the father no one can come to me except the father draws them you see it's God that did the calling and it was God that did the pulling and it was God that set the church in order and he said now you say brother Brown that's pure Calvinism he said no it isn't he said now wait you don't believe that that's God that takes them man up and just say here I am I'm going to pick you now watch this I want to just show you another couple short quotes he said here they asked brother brownman questions and answerers 63 they said what how will we know who will be saved in the end of the world and he said he said well all the Jews be actually the question is is it true that every Jew that's born since Christ into the world will be saved and he said no nothing will be saved only those whose names is on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now watch this he says Jew or Gentile amen and he said it's not one name but he said it's a great mystery and he mentions here I want to say he says he said it's a great mystery and he said no you can't see it you know we have to be so careful that we don't get religiously minded and you know I believe in Holiness the Bible says without Holiness no man will see God but if you just believe in Holiness you're going to have to explain to me the thief on the cross and King Saul because King Saul was killing David going to a witch to pray to the prophet and prophet Samuel said but you'll be with me in Paradise you and your sons it don't sound like a holy man to me but he was predestinated amen it's amazing grace that's what I'm trying to tell you it's amazing grace Amazing Grace I'm not con I'm not condoning King Saul I don't believe in killing Christians but the prophet said in the word of God that him and his sons would be with him in paradise and Jesus said this the thief on the cross God help help us God help us to understand and be able to move with the light you know we're the only message that understands predestination and everybody else believes they're saving by works and many in the message thinks that they're going to be saved by works too you know I had a minister tell me and I'm going to close with this we're going to sing Our Song you put the words up he said many believed in Elijah was the prophet and Elijah's day but only one got his mantle there'll be many that believe this message Are Holy people and they'll go to hell if their name ain't in the Lamb's Book of Life amen it's just Amazing Grace you can't put it in and you can't take it out praise God for that you can't put me in you can't put me out and I can't put you in and I can't take you out but we got to move with the light and I I challenge any of you to go look up predestinated 800 618 times and you'll see how it just is more and more and more and more and this last year or two it's mentioned dozens of times every message but the prophet never even got it at the beginning of his message amen God help us God help us not to think that we're going to arrive and serve God by our good works amen amen that's free I just want to clarify that that's that's thus saith the Bible That's thus sayith the word of God I mean that's that's Romans 9 Romans 8 I mean 32 amen God help us to to understand and you know uh God is good God is good I I in no way God in no way is condoning sin but God is God you know we read the script scripture Sunday we have no right to judge God we have no right to judge God don't put God in a box because he'll step right outside that box the day you put them inside it amen you'll say well there's no way though oh no way the prophet said there will be many surprises that's right many surprises amen amen well we're welome we're just delighted to welcome Pastor Rolando we're going to sing this song now I I pray that you'll give him a little Grace he was in the airport or in the airplane for about 36 to 40 hours and he's got a 12-h hour delay we picked him up early yesterday and uh just uh he's still switching and 100% of his clothes got left at the airport and I said I said brother Rolando it's you look fine in blue jeans he got them 15 minutes before we left the house so he's got some butterflies he's trying to figure out his clothes he was the first thing he was saying when we got his suitcase I need an iron I need an iron I need an iron I need an iron amen just pray for our brother and just be a real blessing I I met our brother the first time I believe it was 13 or 14 years ago at pastor nestor's church in Manila the Philippines and met him many times since then and

11 to 14 it says for the son of man is come to save that which was lost how think ye if a man have 100 sheep and one of them begun astray do not do he not leave the 0 and n and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is GH stray and if so be that he find it verily I say unto you he rejoiceth more that more of that ship than of the 90 and N which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish may the Lord had blessing upon the reading of his word and you may be seated in the presence of the Lord so uh Hallelujah uh before I forgot I am bringing greetings from my uh small congregation in uh the island of Summer the Philippines and uh they are praying for me and for you this evening so uh uh this evening is uh maybe around 9:00 tonight and uh they will have their uh uh uh Divine service right we are uh 12 hours ahead than you have here in the in can in Canada and oh I'm I'm happy that uh God is always on time you know uh I was you know I was a little bit worried uh last sat uh Friday Saturday and Sunday uh it was uh October 25 to 27 is is a camp meeting that uh our church is hosting and then before that camp meeting Allelujah there was a strong typhoon you know there was a typhoon not not the wind is not too strong but it travels very slowly and uh it you know the reduce of the typhoon is too big Allelujah and a lot of raining and flooding all over almost all over the Philippines and uh our church and our house was flooded but uh after uh after uh the flooding then we started our uh camp meeting and then after the camp meeting here comes another strong typhoon a super typhoon and then I was worried I might I might not be able to go to Manila because my flight uh to this uh to Canada is from Manila right right but uh and then when I was at the airport and uh while I was checking in and while I we were falling in line and then uh the Personnel of the Eva a told me that uh we have a problem because uh the typhoon that hit Philippines is now in Taiwan and then uh nobody there's no plane that can land and no no plane can take off I said but I I need to be in Canada on on Friday so I told the lady and then he took my email address and my information and then uh after a while I got an a message an email from Eva a that he transferred me into uh Philippine Airlines which is much better than uh than than Eva a so when I was uh when we arrived uh San Francisco so my flight uh was from Manila to San Francisco and from San fran San Francisco to Toronto right and uh when I was in San Francisco I went out and then uh I asked uh the man outside and he said I asked him where is the the I don't know the the terminal for uh I forgot the terminal yes yes and they said uh it's it's uh you have to go there and uh where is your your luggage I said uh the lady in the Philippines told me that uh I have to pick uh my luggage up in uh Toronto and said no you have to pick up here you pick your luggage here all the luggages must be you know must be picked up from here so I went back and uh my luggage was there right so but when I arrived at Toronto my luggage was not there and then uh oh I thank Pastor D and uh sister L stop uh deot some uh my needs personal needs and [Music] uh the Personnel in uh Toronto told me that uh your luggage will be delivered within 48 hours but I thank God that uh before we left home to come to church uh it arrived so I have now my Hallelujah so uh uh I'm very sorry I hope you will understand my broken English oh I uh I don't have education to you know I just learned I just understand uh English and learned to speak English when I started uh reading the message Hallelujah and uh and uh it's you know it's conf confusing you know con confusing Hallelujah because sometimes times I preach in siano in Tagalog and in my own language yes and uh for the whole year this is the first time that I'm going to to speak English because in in my in my church I do not speak English Allelujah except when I I read uh the Bible and the message so thank you very much uh Pastor D for uh uh trusting me to stand behind your P pulpit and I understand being a pastor it is not uh you know it is not easy to to trust anybody Allelujah to to stand behind the pulpit Allelujah this is a a serious matter and uh just pray for me that God will uh bless Jesus that God will help me H Allelujah so this evening I'm not going to speak uh doctrinal or deep things you have your pastor to to do it and uh this evening I just want to be a blessing Hallelujah so as we read here in Matthew h Allelujah this is our Lord right who told this story about the Lost ship right Hallelujah the Lost ship and he he had gone astray right and uh uh separated disconnected from the fold uh disconnected and separated from the sight of the pastor Hallelujah but Hallelujah we know that the ship Hallelujah it is not in us to look or to seek for God no it was God who seek us hallelujah and then he says that Hallelujah when when one ship was lost the shepherd left the 99 and then he looked for that onip H Allelujah and when he found it he said that he rejoiced more Hallelujah of that ship than of the 90 and N which went not astray Hallelujah and he says that even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish no one in his ship should perish no one in his sons in his children Hallelujah should perish Hallelujah once you are a sheep right you will always be a sheep and once you are a son you will always be a son thank you Lord hallelujah because you were in him from the beginning hallelujah hallelujah and your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and it is him Hallelujah when we were lost it is him who made the way for us to be redeemed and the prophet said that not all the people are redeemable yeah Hallelujah only those that came from him that were all that are part of him will be redeemed Hallelujah that's why Abraham said that if you have eternal life this evening if you have eternal life tonight you didn't have it when you believe him you have it Hallelujah before the foundation of the world Hallelujah if you have eternal life today Hallelujah you didn't you didn't have it when you believe it but you have it because you have you are a part of that Eternal one and there is only one that is eternal and that is God hallelujah just like God just like my children before they were born here on Earth I got seven children before they were born here on Earth before I got married they were with me as a seed yes Hallelujah and if you will have a DNA test with them yeah we have the same kind of DNA Hallelujah so if Hallelujah if uh there is an spiritual DNA testing if they will test your DNA and the tast and what's the life the kind of life in you and the kind of life that is in God hallelujah you have the same Hallelujah life which is the eternal life the zooy life Hallelujah now but there are times that the ship got lost right separated disconnected from the father amen hallelujah this is uh Jes it is Jesus himself s right yes who told this story yes Hallelujah and I praying that no one that is in here this evening that is in that condition Hallelujah and if we are may God help us to be reconnected with him amen hallelujah you know brothers and sisters especially in this in this time right Satan is doing a lot of things entertainment on our laptops on our cell phones Hallelujah and you know sometimes people they give much time Hallelujah on watching Hallelujah things on our cell phone then true praying praying and seeking his presence true Hallelujah help us Lord and I hope brothers and sisters that we are still in continuity with him connected with him you might say I come to church every service but you know brothers and sisters even if we are here in the church sometimes the devil is you know your your body is there but sometimes your heart is disconnected with him sometimes your mind is disconnect is disconnected with him and you know Hallelujah you might say I come to church in every service I pay my tithes I help the mission I sing songs right Hallelujah unto the Lord but the question is how's about our relationship right with him amen is it still connected right Hallelujah is there no Gap in it is there no lost connection Hallelujah and it's always been my prayers brother and sisters and my heart's desire to be in line with his word and to be in his perfect will H Allelujah you know brothers and sisters the benefits of uh being always connected with him Jesus said in John 15: 7 if ye abide amen hallelujah it means if you are always connected there you go in me amen and my words abide in you Hallelujah what's the benefit amen ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you am Hallelujah abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in me no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me without me it means if you are disconnected if you are separated like a like a branch it will dried up and then when it is dried amen hallelujah what is the use of it right then to be burned right Hallelujah for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned H Allelujah just like any Appliance appliances H Allelujah if that uh ceiling fun is not connected amen it can do nothing it will not function Hallelujah so the same thing with our relationship with God hallelujah it's good to do things for the Lord to be busy in all the activities Hallelujah just like I think just like Martha Hallelujah but it's good to be dressed right like a real Christian hallelujah amen those are good things I have nothing against that and that should be done hallelujah and then sometimes ministers they are fighting uham said baram said baram said and oh my sometime they almost Hallelujah with those quotation yeah and I have nothing against it brothers and sisters but how about the kind of life that we are living our relationship with him Hallelujah I remember the story of King Saul when God commanded him Allelujah God he wants us to be obedient right H Allelujah God's commandment was to kill all all the amalekites right the old ones the young people the babies and even the animals Hallelujah and you know amalik is the grandson of Esau yeah yes sir a carnal one carnal people which is type of the flesh yeah Hallelujah to kill all the flesh yeah Hallelujah but Saul disobey the word of the Lord hallelujah regardless if she is a cute baby right Hallelujah she is still an amalekite flesh Reg regardless no matter how handsome he is how beautiful she is they are still amalekites H Allelujah how fat is that cow or the sheep and good for offering because God he delighted a fat offering yeah Hallelujah but the Commandment is to kill to destroy them all Hallelujah in some 1 Samuel 15 verse3 it says and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the Commandment of the Lord and you know he was Hallelujah happy I performed Hallelujah the Commandment of the Lord yeah wow and Samuel said what meanest then this bleeding of the sheep in mine ears and the Lo of the O oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought uh they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spad the the best of the sheep and of the oxan to sacrifice unto the Lord th God and the rest we have utterly destroyed then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord had said to me this night wow and he said unto him SE and Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed thee King over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites the Sinners the amalekites Hallelujah destroy unbelief Hallelujah the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then this thou not obey the voice of the Lord but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord it means disobedience is evil in the sight of the Lord Hallelujah then and Saul said unto Samuel ye I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought AOG the king of amalik and have utterly destroyed the amalekites it means partial obedience is Disobedience Hallelujah but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen and sheep of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgal and Samuel said had the Lord as as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to heren that then the fat of RS for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft right wow Rebellion right Hallelujah wow you know brothers and sisters help Lord did Soul make any Rebellion he just disbelieved yeah some word and God said Rebellion that's Rebellion Hallelujah is as the sin of Witchcraft Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry Hallelujah then Samuel said because thou H has rejected the word of the Lord he had also rejected thee from being King wow Amen Hallelujah by rejecting the word of the Lord you are now disconnected with God Amen you are now separated with God there has been a bridge between him and God hallelujah just like David you know you remember David his intention is Right Hallelujah to bring the ark Hallelujah back to Israel but he brought it in different way than what hallelujah amen the way of the Lord told them Hallelujah and the Bible said there were there had been a bridge between God and the People Israel Hallelujah just a a small you know a little disobedient Hallelujah a little unbelief it will cause disconnection Amen Hallelujah by disobeying because of this obeying God's word and now you can imagine brothers and sisters after that Samuel told Saul that God had rejected you and maybe Soul he still looks like a king you know he is still on his throne wearing the the robe of a king yeah there you go Hallelujah doing the service of a king and maybe the people still regarded him as king but in the sight of God hallelujah he is no longer a king he was separated Hallelujah from God and because of his unrepining Spirit you know right instead that uh amen he had to repent right and he got jealous you know you know and he had been seeking for the life of David you know his connection with God was totally cut off and he no longer heard any words from the Lord H Allelujah amen and then he went into the wit of indor witchcraft which is an Abomination before God it means from one sin he added another sin Hallelujah instead of humbling himself repenting himself Hallelujah accepting the sin that he had done and he did not repent brothers and sisters and because of that but he died in a horrible death yes Hallelujah although he didn't lost his salvation right because when he in when he inquired Samuel through the wi of indor right Hallelujah Samuel said tomorrow he will be with me amen it means if Samuel was in hell then Saul was will be in hell but if Samuel will be in heaven Saul is with him then he will be in heaven Hallelujah because he was once the anointed of the Lord hallelujah thank you sometimes brothers and sisters there are some Christians that that they don't you know pay much attention whether they compromise the word of God or not right Hallelujah maybe if you have some decision to make Allelujah it's better to ask God ask advice from your pastor than Jesus pray about it sometimes if if you if there is a somebody offers you a job and uh it has an a good earning income and then you grab it right away without that's right seeking his perfect will thank you Lord hallelujah and then you say oh as long as I go to church as long as I pay my tithes as as as long as I dress right wow with Holiness Hallelujah I'm still a Christian but the question is how about your connection with God amen hallelujah amen you know brothers and sisters if you are disconnected whether you are disconnected or you are still connected with God right you can feel it amen yes sir you can feel it when you pray you can feel it when you worship God we can feel your presence when you read his word am hallelujah thank you Lord if there is still a connection Hallelujah and if there's no more connection you can feel it brothers and sisters you remember the story of brother bham About a Boy flying a kite yeah you know because it it's already it has a long long string and uh yeah the kite is too high and they could no longer see the kite yes and then the man ask him what are you doing I'm I'm flying a kite hallelujah how do you know that the kite is still there and the boy said because I feel it hallelujah hallelujah why because there is still a connection there is still a line and he feel it [Music] Hallelujah Brothers and Sisters Jesus we need to check our connection every day right yes sir every morning morning every time every moment in our lives hallelujah amen for me brothers and sisters Hallelujah there is nothing more important Hallelujah than my relationship with God hallelujah than youus God is not a myth he is a real God a real being Hallelujah and he longs to fellowship with his children Hallelujah same as your fathers amen hallelujah just like uh last uh I think yesterday and I was I missed my my granddaughters Hallelujah yes I'm I missed them amen hallelujah and God is yeah Hallelujah yeah he longs to fellowship with his children children and you can feel his presence every time we pray every time we read his word hallelujah thank you Jesus but brothers and sisters if ever there is a problem with our if there is no problem with our connection with God Amen Hallelujah he promised Hallelujah and he will not lie right amen as we read uh a while ago if you abide in me and my words abide in you thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah if ye abide in me it means if you are connected right Hallelujah and my words is abiding in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I just want to read uh some quotations from uh the message make the valley full of ditches he says when you come to the meeting tonight if you are sick did you come say now father I'm going down there I ask you to be merciful to me and let my faith be raised up tonight to a place where I can believe your son and beheld did you think to pray when you heard the meeting was going to be up here thank you Lord thank you Hallelujah in Cornersville did you pray go around and get the neighbors and have little prayer meetings we forgot those things and that's that's why we get in trouble now he says they went seven days out into the Wilderness never pit no compass and come to find out they got in trouble yeah they went without consulting God and all the water supply was cut off yeah Hallelujah instead of Consulting God seeking his perfect will in everything that we do Hallelujah right and they didn't do it and that's the reason the water supply Supply was cut off that's the matter with the church tonight the water supply is cut off trying to carry the church the church on without the supernatural trying to try to carry the church on just in its natural trying to pattern after the other churches of the world and that's the reason we are not having the blessings we used to have and sometimes not only that but sometimes uh we want to do something and we feel that there is a red light in our hearts right giving us warning not to cross Hallelujah right that's why brother said that uh going to hell not is is not easy right you have to cross that red light Hallelujah that's because God will will warn you not to do it he will and then you force it Hallelujah true and he said Remember the first time you heard the Hy sang at church and something bit at your heart and you just shook yourself and turnour Away amen I'll do it some other time thems all are red light and you just walk right on over them warnings don't go the way you are going little boy little girl turn back to me I'm your creator but you walk right on through it you can't expect nothing else don't lay it onto God if you run through that St light out there don't say the city is is in blame no sir you are the fault right that stop light there to protect you and to help you and you must obey it and then it isn't the city's fault it's your it's your fault cuz you should have stop when you warning when the warning comes on right and when you feel that little buzer down in your heart warning you then you better stop right there and take inventory like I was been preaching along through the nights of the people drifting away from God Amen when you hear the word come right back it's truly the word of God there's a little buer Rings you better listen to it don't walk across that cuz you will never get any further till you come right back here where you left him you'll uh will you leave Christ at by failing to obey his word right there uh or you don't leave him he don't leave you you leave him yeah yeah Hallelujah see you always leave him because he's got he's got you in the path he's trying to lead you but see when you leave him then you have to come right back where you left him at to start again H Allelujah you know brothers and sisters especially in the denominations denomination people you say oh God is love and sometimes they are posting uh you know this worldly and then uh they are still uh uh hoping that God is blessing them and God is with them right H Allelujah Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will not leave you I will be with you even in you unto the end of the world right Hallelujah to walk in his path but when you Hallelujah Walk Off The Path hallelujah amen God will not go with you and help you to go into a wrong right into a wrong way no Hallelujah but baham said where you left him he is still there waiting for you to come back right amen hallelujah thank you Lord he is there waiting for you to come back amen and uh baram there is a story about I believe you heard about this story about the chaplain and uh a captain who was uh machine gun machine gunned he said the captain once said when a man was machine guned he said Captain do you know God and when the man when the captain was dying because he was hit by a machine gun machine gun Hallelujah he said I once knew him said when did you when did you know him he said I can think said where you leave him you will have to go back where you left him to find him he said I don't know he said your lungs are filling up Sir you better sing quiet and fast so he laid the there a little bit said a great pie come over his face said I remember I remember where I left him he said where was it the chaplain asked the captain where was it he said start start right there he said now I lay down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I shall die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take he drw his last breath as he gurgle the blood filled his filled up his lungs and he died what did he do he found Jesus right where he left him Allelujah when he was a little boy when he was sing when his mother was singing those songs for him hallelujah amen and Hallelujah even in his when he was dying huah when he you know when he traced where he left Jesus and then he still found him yes sir hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus now in 2 Peter 3:9 it says that the Lord is not willing that anyone should perish but that all should come to repentance hallelujah hallelujah he is not willing that anyone should perish Hallelujah but that all should come to repentance that's why God hallelujah he has done his his part to redeem us he has done his part at Calvary in order for us to be restored to him back to him Hallelujah but he did not make us as robots you know he gave us the free moral agency he give us a chance to choose to decide whether if uh to Humble ourselves or or not or not or be willing uh or willing to be to come back to him Hallelujah God is always willing but he do not intervene with your life Hallelujah without your permission right although the Bible says everybody they love this verse for God so Lov the world that he gave his only son Hallelujah that whosoever believeth in him should not perish right Hallelujah but if you will not believe although he loved everybody but he knows from the beginning who will love him and who will believe him Hallelujah he is not willing that's why uh Apostle Peter used the term but he should but that but that all should come to repentance he is not willing that anyone should perish but Hallelujah we yeah must come to repentance just like what happened in Eden when man uh fall Allelujah in sin then God was calling them Adam Adam where are now does it mean that he do not know where Adam and Eve was amen right he is an omn omnicient God he knows everything he knows where you are but the Bible said he was calling God was calling waiting for them to respond hallelujah amen then Adam said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself wow hallelujah thank you Lord Edam didn't seek God it was God seeking for Adam and Eve but he did not go there and you know spun them all and then I will put you a a garment you know Hallelujah but God is waiting for them hallelujah thank you Lord God always has his invitation but he always wait for us what would be our response to him isn't it Hallelujah just like in Isaiah 1 verse 18 and 19 come now let us reason together says the Lord though do you though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool yes but the next verse is says if ye be willing God is you know he is wait waiting what would be your response I am not forcing you but if you only Hallelujah if you only willing and obedient Hallelujah there is a promise he shall eat the good of the land no matter how rebellious Israel was God is patiently waiting for them to come back Jeremiah he said in the God said in through Jeremiah for I know the thought that I I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end Hallelujah even though how rebellious they are right Hallelujah God is still have a good plan for them if you are only willing to come back hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus you remember Samson Hallelujah Samson was in Covenant with God right yeah Hallelujah Samson don't drink strong drink your hair let them grow that seven locks of hair as long as it is hanging there my Covenant is with you right Hallelujah you know whatever Samson wants he can get what he you know he wants right power money even woman he he you know no one can stand even thousands of Philistines no one can stand before Samson right Hallelujah that's right as long as that Covenant is there but the problem is because of this too much blessing you know yeah and you know he he was thinking oh it it's me Hallelujah yeah but the Lord said without me you can do nothing amen hallelujah and then Here Comes Delila amen thank you Lord then we know the story that until uh they cut his hair the first time oh what is your secret Samson maybe if you will uh you know if you will tie my hands and and the tide is Samson the Philistines are here but then you know when he woke up he just right broke those H Allelujah and then hallelujah he just took them took it for granted you know until he Hallelujah they cut the hair they cut those Covenant Hallelujah and he was thinking that he is still the same Wow when he broke that Covenant Hallelujah he broke his connection with God and he can do nothing Hallelujah sometimes that's why sometimes material blessings can drive us away from God but Hallelujah as long as amen we we know how to use it yes hallelujah it's really a blessing thank you Lord Abraham said that material blessings is not a sign of God's approval no but we need blessing H Allelujah and then because Samson he forgot the source of his power H Allelujah and then hallelujah after that he was blinded he was taken by the Philistines forced to work every day pushing that Millstone you know and he was now in a miserable condition you know if you are born normal and then you become blind oh my Hallelujah and then every day you have to push that Millstone yeah but one day he realized Hallelujah Lord once more I want to be connected with you again I want to fix that lost connection Hallelujah imagine brothers and sisters if you are posing and you that uh heavy stone and you are in in Philistine and it's hot you know you are are sweating maybe you have oh I don't like this hair uh to grow long you know because it will stick on my face but Samson he is now willing Hallelujah he just let them grow Hallelujah I want to restore the Covenant back hallelujah thank you Jesus amen hallelujah you know brothers and sisters without the Covenant of God even if your hair is up to hair Hallelujah it will not make you strong no Hallelujah but there is something with that Covenant and when Samson humbled himself Lord hallelujah just give me one more time Lord give me one more chance Lord thank you Jes Hallelujah I will not cut it anymore Hallelujah and God Hallelujah herken his prayer thank you Lord and in Judges chapter 16 28-3 he says and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this ones oh God that I may be be at once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes Samson took hold of the two middle uh middle middle pillar upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with the right hand and of the other with his left hand and Samson said let me die with the Philistines and bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords and upon upon all the people that were with therein so the dead which he slow at his death were more done the which his law in his life Wow hallelujah thank you Jesus thank God Hallelujah God give another chance Hallelujah just like David Hallelujah David he did not lost his salvation when he prayed Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation it is only he his salvation that's why what we are talking about is lost ship Hallelujah lost connection right Hallelujah Lord I don't want to hold you too long and uh last verse that I'm going to read maybe uh a little bit longer this verse is a little bit longer the story of The Prodigal Son and he said a certain man Luke 15: 11- 24 and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of my goods that fth to me and he divided the unto them his living right Hallelujah right you know this is a a bad uh yes attitude of a son right his father is still living and then and then he is now asking his inheritance give me my inheritance but the father is very good you know every time Jesus uh give an give an a parable of a father he always depict depict God as the best father yeah Hallelujah you remember one time he said when your son you evil father when your son imagine evil father yeah yeah Hallelujah when your son ask fish will you give him serpent you evil father when your son ask bread will you give him Stone no Hallelujah yeah if you even father knows how to give good things to your children then he compare yeah the heavenly father how much more your heavenly father he is not evil Hallelujah but he is the best father one time he he he Jesus he he he he gave a parable about the the the the widow woman and uh the unjust judge unjust then he you know he he uh what you call he he he really specified right unjust judge and then this unjust judge know how to answer how to give the need of the widow woman how much more our very good Heavenly Father amen hallelujah glory and in this story Hallelujah here is the son asking oh Father give me Hallelujah when he asked it then the father even though he still alive or living yes he gave him what he was asking yeah and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want Hallelujah now this is now the result this is now the consequence yeah Hallelujah he was thinking oh I got everything I got right everything I want H Allelujah but when you are disconnected from your father when you are out Hallelujah of his presence amen hallelujah you will be in trouble help us Lord and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine H Allelujah and he and he would Fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did e and no man gave unto him wow he was he even wanted to to eat the husk the food of the swine but he didn't eat it you know he wanted it he almost ate it but the people didn't give him Hallelujah and when he came to himself he said how many hard servants of my fathers have breed enough to to spare and I perish with Hunger but the good thing is he realized his situation his condition I am away from my father Hallelujah there are servants and even though they are just servants but they are with my father and they have enough food you know yes they have good place to sleep thank you Lord I am a son but disconnected yeah Hallelujah wow then he realized Hallelujah this is not right after realization he said I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned Hallelujah he acceptance Hallelujah come you know against Heaven I have sinned against heaven and before thee then he got his decision I will arise and go back to my father and will confess Hallelujah the Bible says if we say that we don't have sin we are a Liars we are liars but if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us unto Hallelujah verse 19 and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son so you see how he humbled himself I am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hard servants wow Hallelujah he humbled himself and after this he did the first step Hallelujah and he arose and came to his father Hallelujah make me as one of th servant ofir servant but as I have said and I heard also Pastor D said as long as you are a son you will not be a servant you will always be a son Hallelujah and he arose and came to his father but his father but when he was yet a great way off Glory Hall hallelujah amen you know it manifested what's in the heart of the father right yes sir maybe the father was you know was thinking to to find to look for his son but you know it it is God's he is just giving us hallelujah he is just waiting us yeah our own decision to come back to him and if he you know even baham said if you are willing to have the Holy Ghost God is more willing to give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah more than you wanted it you want it Hallelujah if you want to go back to your father your father has been longing Hallelujah to fellowship with you again that's why brothers and sisters but when he saw but when he was yet a great way of his father saw him and had compassion and run and fell you Lord on his neck and kissed him hallelujah thank you Lord Beautiful Jesus Hallelujah verse 21 and the son said unto him father I have Sinn against heaven and in thy sight and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son Hallelujah that's the kind of attitude that God is waiting Hallelujah but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe Hallelujah and put it on him the robe of righteousness righteousness righteous just justif ation Hallelujah we had been Justified as though we don't we never sin at the first place the father he forgot all the things that his son have done hallelujah thank you Lord the most important my son is here amen put Rob and put on him and put a ring on his hand ring means Authority you know in those days ring there they use it to seal Hallelujah yes sir whatever the authority of the father if you have given yes that ring you have the same Authority Hallelujah and she was on his feet to walk in his path hallelujah
