prayed up on these Services you know that you're not just here enjoying a few stuff but no but it's just a Holy Spirit and you believe that you know God brought us together for us to share it's different from a man trying to seek a Pulpit to preach that's not the occasion oh he's not the occasion it's God amen amen send us together hear let's just read and you take your seat thank you Jesus Hebrews chapter uh five and let's just start from verse 8 actually to verse 14 the word says that though he were a son Christ he speaking of Christ Jesus yet he learn let learning obedience by the things which he suffered amen you saw that yeah learn obedience by what by studying the word no preach brother preach am I just love God you learn obedience by going to church no but you learn obedience by the things he suffer who are you you're the Beloved trials and Temptation can never never came to you to destroy you but to train you amen glory to God I love that and being made perfect so through learning he's coming up into Perfection so being made perfect through the learning process he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him of God and high priest after the of of whom now this is interesting though of whom we have many things to say more things to say an or to be uttered seeing that you are dull of hearing Lord that's not an insultive statement but it's very interesting amen amen Your da of hearing Jesus used it to them guys on the road to H remember that yes slow heart do hearing is the same terminology for when the time that you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God hallelujah all right you are becoming such as such as have need of milk and not strong meat you see that amen milk meat amen two different stages milk meat y for everyone that use milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a bab amen amen oh yes amen this is interesting well look at the me part of this now but strong me belong to them that are of full age amen mature amen you're now mature you put away child stuff when you're a child you think child amen I watched the babies one child coming in and you said to his mama this morning he said Mama I'm going out to play it's service time but he want wants to play uhhuh he's a child that's it you don't give him a quote to curve it you don't give him the Bible oh you're going to be in church right he wants to play he's a baby there you go Amen brother sir amen but when I see brother Emmanuel sitting there and then he said to his wife honey I feel like go outside something's wrong your name is so easy to call I'm not picking on you but you God With Us GL to God it's a he though so strong me belong to them that are a full age even those who by reason now listen this by reason of use have their what senses they whates senses plural yes that we going to talk about that they have their senses exercised to Desert Hallelujah both good and evil amen God bless you thank you Lord wo wow so that's interesting for us to get into this morning you know and uh you know what came to my thought just to encourage the young people you know really the song and the how you came together and sung of sister Ruth just you know yes help them and talk amen you know and I want to say can you hear yeah my wife was watching it yesterday and she said Dad she said isn't there no mic there I said honey the mic was there yeah crank you know and really appreciate this Camp yes amen you know the Lord permits having it I have persons from Georgia um want to come in and say oh if the Lord permits we're going to be there next year amen you know and and uh I want to encourage the young people you know no matter how far you are being or discourage you right you may have been Christ Jesus still loves you right praise God and he's loving you through US amen no matter what happened just remember that we still love you right we're praying for you yes get back in line with Christ all right his arms are still wide open yes sir Hallelujah receive the baptism of the holy spirit let nobody discourage you no way you know sometimes we have camp meetings and great conventions and brother Jose it turned out to be nothing than a spiritual Stampede amen only the best survive yeah many left worse than they came because we trampled them we killed them we we CAU them to pieces and they never get life but such as I have I give amen that's good such as I have I give I give life young people yes give them love yes still care for them yes don't trample them don't destroy them even if you know that they are being blow yes going in the world and getting messed up still open your arms to them bring them back Hallelujah that's our purpose amen glory to God I believe this camp meeing we going to give we're giving you love right bringing you back into Fellowship right GL to God if you don't have it you can't give it amen such as I have in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah put aside the IND differences take the the big callers off come down to the level of these people suffering sometime we preach the word so high the poor little kids cannot even understand there you go there you go right amen there you go oh Lord I love you you know preparing you for the word and you know and and we thank God for this great time amen this end time here and the thought I want to share this morning is follow the anointing to the full age amen amen follow the anointing to the full age to the age of maturity amen if we notice that the word says that the Apostle teaches he said have your senses not sense but senses we remember we know in the message of prophet thought us about the six sense which is the super sense all right yes sir which is the super sense but Paul the Apostle now is not refering to the super sense no sir because it is in the same book that he would have read for chapter 11 about faith and the great warriors that gone before about faith amen have you ever wondered and excited how he excited how he put sister Raab yes brother in the Hall of Faith amen Amen brother think about it yes my sister they have had her name in the book of Faith that's powerful is that right glory to God you I call her sister because she has been transformed she was a seed of God the foundation sometimes the to our to our full age have been messy right cannot be even talked about right many many of us don't even like to remember how pass is that right you don't become sheep you are sheep GL only Abraham seed can receive the Holy Ghost so you don't become seed you are seed already but you come to full age the full age the age of understanding and so he never says you're going to express the gifts of the Spirit no but he says your senses the five senses right see hear smell tasting and feeling the natural senses he was refering to here exercise your senses right Hallelujah glory to God Amen mhm it's interesting when you exercise something or someone you train them yes amen right you are forging them to another level Amen brother amen to God Amen so he says in the at the full age the age of maturity you at that level you are able to train amen you are senses yes to a level of discernment amen amen there you go amen wow amen yet the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2:14 the natural man yes cannot amen receive the things of the spirit of Amen neither can he know them because they are foolishness on Amen they are spiritually deserved so it's impossible for us to train our natural senses to receive the things of the spirit because that will be contrary to the Worden amen hallelujah amen you remember the prophet says he said this is an unbeliever amen to God this is an unbeliever oh Hallelujah so he had to be converted now as long as you are here this let is still an unbeliever right so you get up in the morning this morning says I've got to be in Fellowship yes but the unbeliever says I'm tired yeah the unbeliever said my back is hurting right Glory but the believer on the inside said I've got to go to [Applause] church so there was always a war a battle between the believer and the unbeliever amen amen pre that's right morning the unbeliever is tired yes but on Monday morning to go to work the unbeliever gets [Applause] well so you cannot have you cannot put your trust in on the unbeliever you put your trust in The Believer the glory am the spirit man Hallelujah like it you see that and so what you do in training your senses is to produce what the spirit will accept amen amen not you cannot train let me say this again I want everybody to be on the same page with me you cannot train because the word exercise mean train you cannot train your senses to receive the things of the spirit amen it's impossible amen yeah yeah but you train your senses to produce what the spirit will accept you see glory to God it's no this starts and just to pile a few that we have said over the weekend this starts when you know who you are amen and when you know who you are that's when you start to know what you possess right Glory Glory that's right to God the only way you can know what you possess is when you know who you are and when you know who you are that's when you know where you came [Applause] from know where you came from that's know where you're going that's when you know that it has nothing to do with mankind amenallah amen glory amen so when you know who you are then you know what you possess who are you I'm the Beloved yes I'm the Sheep of his am amen hallelujah I'm the chief of his Pastor amen hallelujah beautiful you know can I give you a testimony yes yes there's a young man that baptized years ago sometimes ago and probably listen

it amen glory to God Hallelujah pise God knowing you are produces that GL to God so who are you and what you possess is important knowing who you are what you possess it drives perseverance that you

light is amen if God moves and you refuse to move with God you're in darkness right go there you go amen amen hallelujah praise God glory to God thank you so the word comes down one receive it amen recipient and when the word when I receive the word that's a recipient somebody got to benefit amen what we said this week once God put his word in you as a recipient as as an anointing nothing can
