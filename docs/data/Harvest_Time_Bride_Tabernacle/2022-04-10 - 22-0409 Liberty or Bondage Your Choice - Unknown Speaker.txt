and [Music] oh [Music] how many can say i love you lord amen i love you jesus hallelujah hey man amen we're so thankful why don't you have your seats for a moment you've been standing we bring you greetings from my pastor brother john andy's in ferndale washington state we have a little work there that we the lord has put on his heart about six months ago to start as brother dale was saying the border is closed still and so there's many saints that need a church right can you you can't go out you cannot go without oxygen very long and breathe so that is why a church is essential for every believer to have a home church and a home pastor that they can come and have fellowship with god and so we're so thankful for that and now this covet devil that's tried to take out the bride he is defeated and this time we are going to have the final say we are going to be victorious the bride will be victorious amen how many believe that kova the devil thought he was going to pull a fast one and for many it took them out spiritually they became lazy christians and we don't know where they are today they're casualties of satan he's taken them out of the battle but at the end time it says i will restore saith the lord not i might i might restore i will restore and if you believe that the message is for you you will be restored you'll be restored to your ought to be conditioned amen i better not get preaching here but we want to say thank you to brother dale i've never met brother dale in person and he had reached out to me on facebook social media had heard some of our podcasts and some services i had preached and he just felt to invite us i prayed about it another friend of mine said yeah he's a wonderful brother a couple of my other minister friends said uh we know brother dale very well he used to travel to uganda where i'm going next month and so by god's grace um we have the same desire and vision it's not one man vision it's a bride vision it's not one man preaching this gospel and running with a message it's a many-membered body and the devil ain't stopping us amen and the devil is trying to make people and lie to them and say everyone's leaving the message and i am here to say no there are more coming into this message which the message is jesus christ to deny this message is deny jesus christ you crucified jesus christ unawares and they don't even know it they're spitting in his face but we're here to exalt the name of jesus there's power in the name of jesus to break every chain and that's what we want to talk about tonight we want to speak words of life and now we want to take it and believe it amen my name is brother tim i have a wife sister jessica we have three kids by god's grace it hasn't been easy though we had three children before we had our first child that passed away prematurely so you go through trials in your life you go through things where you lose kids you don't understand anyone ever been there any bride member ever been there anyone dreaming that never heard the name william branham know what we believe why we believe it and we believe that it brings liberty it does not bondage its freedom this mess oh it's grace grace love love love mercy rewrote our life and by god's grace my father has served and was born the message um raised by my grandfather who actually transcribed and edited every message book that you read in english he worked at vgr and then spoken word publications before so that's my grandpa brother ken and by god's grace he's still alive still preaching this gospel so there's a vindication that this message is true you want to say you want to argue people want to argue this message but i'm here to say the life proves that this message is real and people that receive it in its pure form will be free love it they want more of it hallelujah so in my opening comments i just want to say by god's grace i've been born in the message never have gone out into the things of this world and i believe that is a that this gospel is true the gospel holds he keeps young people safe and if you've gone astray you have a testimony as well to tell your children or others you don't have to go there you don't have to go there amen you don't have to go down my road the mistakes i made my past history has been cleared and i was forgiven at calvary so we're gonna around people are in churches and they're coming in with chains on and what i hear tonight is people are bound whites jebusites hittites they've got devil on their case and jesus is coming to tell you you can be free old ones can be free in jesus name young children can receive the baptism of the holy ghost young jesus more than they need water more than they need food we need jesus hallelujah so our announcement i have two announcements the first one is for you jesus died on the cross of calvary to save you redeem you and make you 100 percent free and now you just need to believe it i can tell my wife all day that i love her i can show her my love but if she doesn't believe it brother dale it's not going to have any effect right i can tell my wife all day she could tell me all day but if i don't believe what she's saying now that's why we're here in church tonight if you've come believing you'll receive something but if you've come doubting you're sitting back as the skeptic brother branham talks about skeptics in the church right we want to make sure we're not worried about the skeptic in the church we want to make sure we're just not the skeptic we're not worried about the make believer and the unbeliever we want to be the believer amen that stay true to joshua's message amen let's stand praise god and we're going to pray turn to the word in galatians chapter 5 amen amen man who feels free in the holy amen praise the lord jesus amen so let's just close our eyes bow our heads oh god we just come to you lord tonight lord as a needy people lord we need you jesus there's not maybe 40 50 i don't know in this room god but if you're not here lord it doesn't matter lord so we invite you right now lord the angels of god that came in a prophet's services and he said i'm just waiting for the that angel to come on my right side lord and that same mighty angel or god we're waiting and we're expecting you lord to speak through my lips oh god oh circumcise my tongue god that i would speak words of life god from your word of life which has come and sent a prophet to speak and shown us truth and that truth has turned our hearts back to you oh god malachi has come elijah has come fulfilled scripture god and there's one part and we are that fulfillment of that as the believer we believe we will be raptured god we will be changed and taken away lord in a twinkling of an eye oh god but help us god in our families jesus churches to have a real liberty god not a fake liberty i didn't say we're fr as many in the world say i'm free i'm free i'm free but they're bound help us to be free indeed god and he whose son sets free will be free indeed forevermore oh god never to want to go back to those chains jesus help this service to go according to your will lord if i don't even have to look at my note notes god just may your presence god and your holy spirit speak lord in jesus name amen amen praise the lord let's turn to galatians chapter 5 galatians verse 1 and then we'll turn to luke 4. galatians chapter 5 verse 1 says stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us let's say that made us and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage so you can be set free and then go back into slavery and you can be free on a sunday and on monday you're back free see but god is wanting to set you free and forever you're free indeed never to want to go back to bondage why would a person want to be free from drugs and alcohol have family be restored and then go back to the devil is the enemy the devil has crept into churches into young people's lives and told them this message is do's and don'ts and law that's the devil website any person that comes against this mess is coming against jesus christ himself the revealed word because the message is the same message brother branham preaches what we're hearing tonight if a vessel a five-fold gets out of the way then what his duty bound to do is to edify and uplift the body and if i don't edify and uplift you and you go out these doors and you don't feel that god spoke to you i've not done what i needed to do so now i'm asking as a minister that i'm going to the truth i'm asking that we would be believers of that let's go out and live it we don't need three hour five hour sermons all night prayer means though we do need that sometimes we need a life we need to go out to our families and our communities and live a life please live what we believe ashamed of this gospel ashamed who's not ashamed to say that i believe god sent a prophet and that prophet before he's turned my heart i find myself in the scriptures before the dreadful day of the lord my heart is changed and i am free i have liberty amen galatians chapter 5 verse 13 says for brethren ye have been called you know what it is like on my phone with me when you get a call right you're gonna click this morning this evening sorry this evening and tomorrow is going to be a call going out it's calling you by the tim it's calling you to say you know what there's things in your life it's time to do a little up here that's why we come to church dr jesus is wanting to talk to you he said hello and we're not answering the call we click no later on a phone sometimes in the past on an iphone it would say uh yes or accept or decline and then there was a one that said maybe later and that means that you're going to call him back and it sends you a reminder right people today are in churches and they hear the call you need to be born again i don't need that right now i don't want to give my life to christ 100 no i'm saying no to the call well guess what one day that might be the last call and how many times was samuel called three times that's grace grace that god called him and then finally aster finally told him what to say and as a young boy he did it he believed it he received it and he had communion without god wants to commune with us tonight praise the lord we have been called only use here it is only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh what do people say when i have liberty i am free free in their flesh right there but by love by love we need to serve one body we need a stocking of ourselves what if god changed me jared if god gave me salvation i want to share it right and if i believe that what i'm believing and received is different than the world it's something gonna separate by god's grace but here's what i i believe not all your children are here right now right and we're gonna we're gonna believe that that one could come walking in the he could string this service down the road and i'm telling him i will restore all the years maybe you don't know why but god's going to restore amen let's have our seats praise the lord amen who's excited to hear the word of god tonight i want to say like caleb i might be old you might feel like you're 70 80 years old but i'm young again give me strength god breathe life into me this service if you come to play church if you're right now and you've just come to hear a good talk you're in the wrong church you're listening to the believer of christ as a follower of jesus we believe a mess and we're running with that message we're running because we believe amen let's turn to luke 4. my notes turned off here luke 4. amen how many are free how many have experienced a freedom in the holy ghost our brother back in the back there's a older brother dale any that have gone for 20 30 years the message brings freedom anything that brings a question in doubt is of satan the enemy of god's word the enemy of this bible that the whole mission to make people doubt the message is also them doubt this to make them doubt the authority of the bible because brother branham pulled and said i must decree glorified and we need to make sure we're preaching jesus to people and not william branham i'll never baptize in william branham's name i'll never pray in his name because his name has no power his name has no power there's only one name that can save there's only one name that can help you and that's dr jesus jesus christ and he brings liberty and he uses god like he's using me uses your pastor uses men and sisters of god in the faith hallelujah to bring liberty but you need a message you need a message to play nuggets that lay in here that brings liberty my middle daughter's name is liberty so that that's where the inspiration came amen luke chapter four maybe tomorrow we'll put a picture up of the family see that little boaz was just born one month ago amen praise god number three god works in threes amen luke chapter 4 verse 18 says in in my bible it's red isn't your okay the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel i want you to take this personal don't just think as me like as a minister i want you sister to believe that you have a gospel to preach to preach to the poor that are needy poor in spirit those that are poor that have that need and have we have been sent here it is he has sent me sister brother to heal the brokenhearted the message brings healing the message of the hour preached by a prophet brings healing if it's believed in that way if you believe a doctor has the prescription you need what he gives you will help you but he can do all the science he wants and if you go to the doctor and you here's my problem i need help but you don't want what he has you can't receive your healing it's the same with our lord jesus you can come to an altar you can raise your hands prayer but if you believe their faith cannot ignite it cannot anchor in a person's womb because what has happened is people have received in their womb a doubt a seed of doubt and that can bring forth a life right and you start to show the life negativity in the atmosphere anyone ever been around you don't want to be around that that negative ministry all the time questioning their motives questioning what they're doing questioning the finances in the church that leads to hypocrisy it leads to actually it leads to where you're questioning every person that could help you he's like a doctor your pastor's like a doctor i want to help you a good pastor a good shepherd cares for the sheep and he heals the brokenhearted isaiah 61 is in reference to that to preach deliverance to the captives today's service is to preach liberty to the captive to the bound and those of you that will listen that have left the message because you listened to a friend and you listened to them and now look at their life they're divorced they left everything their makeup they're got two and three husbands and that's what you want to follow there's a result of every decision in your life what we are speaking is life to help a family to not see divorce happen in a family and separation who likes to divorce in a family who likes to see a section in a church not one person in their right mind with god if it's a body in the faith then we say we're the bride of christ but we attack other bride members because they don't go to our church our young people will not want to serve a god in our churches so our it starts with the ministry it starts then with the parents in the home be real be genuine be yourself to be a shouter and praise the lord and dance around do that if you're meant to be a quiet sister and just knock your head praise god and you're plugging it out and no one knows what through all right praise god but you still believe your family might be forsaken who might have left you but you still believe amen but you need the one just as much as you need shouting amen one because i'm going to tell you right now ministries need feedback they need a pool if you're not pooling i'm not going to preach because that obviously means i'm boring that obviously means there's no what i'm saying and 90 of denominations is dead formal blind miserable and naked and don't know it that's scripture and if you want that kind of church leave the message right now relieve it and run away because the message does not bring bondage this brings liver and you can praise the lord you can shout hallelujah you can jump up and down but you can also just sit there okay there's a groaning inside like a growing does anyone see the hunger hungry for something no but there's a hunger there's a deep desire brother felix there's a deep desire for the things of god that desire the prophet said came from god god gave you the desire for the holy ghost he gives you a dirt deep hunger and he's going to give you a determination so you have you have to have the right desire you must have a hunger for the things of god and he will fill that desire amen so i have decided that i only need to read my bible and a message i don't need to read psychology i don't need a psychology book to tell me how to raise my children i can read a proverb a day keep the devil away in my family show the name of the wisest man in this world solomon i don't need a psychologist to tell me how to raise my kids when his own kids don't know what gender i've been in it i went through college i would not recommend one young person to go to college that does not know 100 that they have the holy sister should go to college unless she knows god wants her to go there a brother does not mean if you go to that we are not believing in a god a dead religion we believe in a living god that does miracles in every service we come to we might not see them every time right we might not see it and when the prophet started preaching the third pool what happened his friends left him the money and the finances no one wanted to so that's a good thing when people start leaving the church it's a good thing because right at the end it's harvest time get that get that shaft get that that thing that's just like the wheat it's right so close and i'm gonna tell you right now it'll deceive the very elect and they're in and they say they believe brother branham is a prophet how can you say that but because because they are deceiving themselves thinking brother branham brings salvation not bring salvation jesus christ has brought us salvation brother branham said i point to jesus christ i lift up jesus christ i want to decrease i'm going to say it again so that he might increase that is not to put down brother ministry that is not to say brother dale we you as a pastor you need a pastor a active in-person pastor that can be there and touch you that can pray for you not some internet pastor that's just got a big congregation and sanitize me that's e brother dale could just stay at home the last two years he could just chill at his house and say keep paying your tithes i'm going to preach the truth is he preaching the right message yeah he can be he can be preaching the message 100 truth everything he's saying is great wrong approach not it's anti-bible it's anti-word and if you want to go in a rapture you better get off your couch you better get off your couch and go to church because you've deceived yourself you do not the you definitely don't believe the message because the prophet of god said you need without a five-fold ministry you will die our young people will die you can only push play for so long before your children will see it's dead but praise god i push play every day i listen to the prophet every day and i listen to the part that tells them to go to church and the part the doors are open doesn't matter how sick i am sister brother i'm gonna be in church i have four or five children i understand brother sister i have three of them but you know what after one week of my child the third one being born we were in church what does that tell our children church matters but now church is this you know we just chill we get our coffee and pjs don't have sunday school directly against what brother branham said that is why bondage is creeping in the message bondage just the very elect so the truth will be preached by true five-fold ministry amen true five-fold ministry what will they do first timothy edifying not beat down not say sheep or bad you have to do it my way they will not misinterpret the word a true fivefold minister will not add his own thought he will not think and lift up his even if there was a vision even during that his ministry would be special he is not special any man that tells you has a special ministry in this time right now is a liar and a false prophet any man doesn't matter if he believes he's in the message doesn't matter if he's a friend of the prophet it doesn't matter because i've seen many friends of the prophet leave the message when brother branham died they left bondage why because they loved the man's gift but they didn't love the jesus that he preached and that jesus is the same thing that paul preached read your bible i challenge any person for 30 days to read their bible all that paul said and the message of the hour and you see how many times it's exactly what paul preached and now we're in the 21st century i hope this is all right now we're in another century and the prophet is gone full ministry now has to take an anointing and they need to use words like facebook they need to use words like websites because what it was back then was not websites it was a tape right then it became the cd and then it got greater and great free to listen to the message why aren't we more free when it's free why are we not more free when the message is now free cost to us a brother once he preached the service i was in and he showed how in the tapes you would pay thousands of dollars to get all the cassettes true that was the value they placed on it four or five thousand dollars i think he said and then as time continued they had the cd you pay like 129 dollars you get all the cds of brother phantom okay commercially whatever you want to call it financially the monetary value is getting less and when something becomes free it's not a bad thing but now the value is mean we need to make sure in the message that because we have it free don't get trapped that we don't get thinking it relax and actually reading it less when we have the most bible apps and we have the most bibles ever printed but we're not reading our bible help us god help us jesus we need parents that are going to stand against what the devil is teaching the devil his spirit his using governments right now in canada and in the u.s to cause gay marriage to be acceptable of satan satanic and the pope will accept that and say it's eight and now millions and billions of people accept it we know because a prophet said that's the antichrist and we know and i'm gonna say it quickly for those who never heard this there will one day be relents on that system and they will bail out america there was a vision that was spoken and the prophet said and prophesied that the roman catholic church will bail them out and they will become dependent on them guess what right now the president of the u.s is catholic the pres the vice president says she's catholic spirit has come in to the white house and i can say that because i'm an american and i'm not against government i want to say that publicly we are not against the american government brother branham said to pray for president pray for those in leadership so justin trudeau if you listen to this service i'm praying for you brother that you catch your revelation to open your border so that people can fellowship once again do you know what he's done you know what justin trudeau has done i'm sorry saints but what he they have done is coveted a devil to such a great and mighty thing and now it's causing mental issues it's caused mental issues and the mentalist institut will have more people than kovit ever took out in life our children without without being in person school and i'm a teacher by the way or was a teacher um our children will suffer developmentally they're going to suffer because of covet and that's so negative right brother it seems so but i'm here to tell you that covet stands for christ overcomes all infections and diseases that's what my god said christ overcomes viruses infections and diseases and i don't to fear it and i don't have to wear a mask it's now proven masks don't work i'm going to tell you right let's save you the prophet of god had a prophecy about and you need to go maybe it'll make you see that the prophet saw this coming he saw there would be uh violence there would be a cancer that would come and the cancer now naturally speaking is coming into the church spiritually there's cancers growing and they multiply very quickly our churches will not grow bigger in the message i'm not looking for 5 000 people to follow me i want here's the service on the internet and that's here today to say i want to follow jesus i'm going to follow jesus no matter what i do no matter what my family says i will be abraham i'm going to separate myself from lot but what's happening is we're playing playing church and we can bring our family and go to heaven you're in the message but have you given your have you been born again have you really been born again and we tell our children brother dale hey you believe the message because now when he comes to the age of accountability his dad can apply the token but now he needs to apply the token the token is the baptism of the holy ghost to have a personal relationship with him our children need the truth spoken to them not a bunch of lies you're going to heaven you're not going to heaven because mommy and daddy my dad's our grandpa is a pastor serve and believe the message of the hour because my dad does i don't believe the message because my grandpa does i believe the message because it's real to me if you can say no matter what comes your way it doesn't matter what family says doesn't matter how many great ministers say i believe the message and i've taken my sabbatical and i've thought about it for seven months or eight months and now i want to be free so i'm setting down my ministry of 30 years and i am now going to be free to do what go back to slavery look at their family and if you know who i'm talking about there's a couple not just one there's a spirit they leave the message and their family look at their kids look at not them look at their kids sodomites they go right back because they're lots they're part of lot's group but they were with abraham and that can be 20 years that can be 30 years that can be 50 years brother oh my and then it hurts it really hurts to see and you're you're feeling groaning pains and birth but you need to make a choice today to be free i want to be free from all doubt all confusion any person that has ever tried to text you or call you or or persuade you the message isn't true you need to stop listening to that boy because a voice that's crying out trying to capture your heart sister try to capture your heart right now right week he's trying to capture your heart with lies and i personally know people that have left jesus christ which is the message of the hour for today that i'm preaching the same message jesus christ and they will hate the service they will say things on the internet brother dale guarantee you about you about me it happened a couple of weeks ago i spoke under brother church and he got blasted and i got blasted praise the lord i'll get blasted i'll take every punch of the devil's got cause i'm gonna stand victorious i'm gonna fight the fight for my children's sake for your children's sake because i don't want my children thinking it's a okay to sit in a church with an ipad this is church no deceived bondage oh but your children are happy and it keeps them quiet in church if this keeps them quiet in five years this same thing will kill and take their soul to hell because that it's a-okay to look at this instead of playing outside liberty comes freedom comes when you let your children worship in the god we serve you personal relationship you let him get baptized eat a little longer wait a little longer keep waiting keep waiting no brother brown is very clear if a child comes five six-year-old it could be and they say i desire baptism of the holy ghost if i was a father the only thing i would ask have you repented have you really repented if my four-year-old when i came back listens to the service and says daddy i want to be baptized i'm going to ask have you repented are you really so sick you've already committed because he's made mistakes so have i every day who has never made a mistake raise your hand and stand because we want to give you a handclap none of us so stop making church oh we're just all great people when i grew up i was at a camp okay i hope any of my friends that hear this aren't offended but i would at a camp at all my friends and you're a pk kid preacher's kid you have it so eat rugs you've never drank alcohol you don't even know how it feels to their face and they know i love them they know it i said right to their face i don't need alcohol i don't need to smoke i don't need a needle and a joint to make me happy because i've already seen the end of that road i have a family right now the alcohol divorce the smoking causes divorce that's bondage your alcohol is bondage you're a slave to alcohol you're a slave to drugs you're a slave to pornography eighty percent they say of christian men are in pornography and by the grace of god they can be delivered of that you've just gotta hate that spirit throw away your phone you gotta throw away your ipad not have it for a while break the habit just a habit it's not sin it's a it's the attribute of a sin and your sin and smoking adultery that is all because you have unbelief in this you do not believe this you do not believe jesus saves you do not believe he has power come in your life so therefore you deny power of christ in your life and you will never be defeated you'll never be delivered of that demon because you have a demon on you the more you drink the more you defile your body you have demons legion do when he was consumed by demons he ran from his family and left his family wasn't for the grace of god oh god if it wasn't for a message of malachi 4 come out of her my people and be separate come out of your denominational ideas lutheranism methodism don't bring that into the message no your catholic spirit you had to pay to go to heaven so don't make your children feel like they gotta pay and they give you this three steps to salvation no they need to repent and be baptized in jesus name easy peasy simplicity is the gospel gospel is simple it's man that has made it complicated and that i'm here to say breach the message set the captive free it'll break bond a person can be a pastor's son and you will go to hell i believe brother abraham's a prophet brother tim i believe he's revelation 10 7. that's wonderful the devil believes it the devil knows it too that's why he's howling that's why he's attacking and the devil is bringing bondage on people because he's attack why is he attacking it let every person here that has a brain the brain one plus one equals two raise your if you're a little child and you know one plus one equals two okay i want you to remember this next statement okay it's not an equation if you believe something wasn't true okay and you left it and you don't believe it okay you don't believe it's true who agrees raise your hand if the right spirit and attitude and nature of god is if you leave something you don't talk bad about something you left that's the spirit and nature of god that's a person i'll follow brother bannon was a baptist brother branham preached to the pentecostals brother branham was in those churches but now we got people in the message i would never that message church i would never have fellowship with those people oh my goodness same thing they're talking bad about when the message what did brother branham say bride will not persecute so you want to say you're the bride and you're taking evil of people you're deleting them out canceling the council culture that's happening liberally in the world guess what it's happening in in the message we cancel people out because they don't agree with us we cancel them out because they see the message a little different guess what i have a revelation for you there's four sides to the pyramid and people see it from different sides okay so don't let anything in this message become a tingling entangling you in bondage don't let it happen believe what you want to believe knowing you can change the what he preached in 46 he is allowed to change in 53. ask any doubter and any if they've ever ch about god about a scripture ask the atheist ask the age philosophy is changing so do you want liberty or do you want bondage the message is liberty it brings freedom so the freedom to worship god now we can say i'm free the messages brought me out of slavery moses it brought me out of slavery but that's not it two million people went out of egypt with their children and they died in the wilderness and my children aren't gonna be that that group i'm not gonna be that group joshua and caleb and i'm going to stay true to them because there's a joshua and caleb anointing on the now right now either joshua anointing you have a balaam anointing you have a cora anointing to split to divide churches to make big things out of little things major doctrinal differences and it split a family is not of god amen help us god to get the message in its simplicity for this loves me this i know the bible tells me so i i drove uh three hours okay this is just a testimony okay got in at 2 30 i guess it would be today or yes yesterday it would be today 2 30 in the morning okay i get in i have a reservation for a rental car i go down and rental place is completely closed you know how upset i was oh man but white the vision isn't done i'm i'm walking where god wants me to walk i'm not being spirit over spiritual when i say i'm walking in a vision i hope you unders you're watching i want you to so then i go upstairs i talk to three or four people they're telling me to go this terminal go to that terminal i said no i'm gonna go out get a car right and guess what out i walk to the i'd walk right to the walkway and a car pulls right up rolls his window down and says can i help you do you know what we talked about for three hours everything message proves and speaks about from genesis almost to revelations and guess what that brother did received it received it from pakistan originally received it if i can have never met a man and in five minutes be sharing him the gospel truth and he's saying hallelujah yes god i receive it he was working in freedom tell you right now he was a happy man and he had to drive me three hours one way and drive three hours back and i had to pay 380 to get that taxi was the never paid amen i'll pay 380 if we see him one day reaching out and saying thank you brother tim i was baptized he might never come to my church might never see the message in its entirety but he saw the message in me because i am the quotes i don't have to say one quote of the prophet i don't have to his name one time because quotes i am the fulfillment of this malachi 4 vindicated message is true it's turned my heart it's changed my family it's given me a wife that loves me that has never cut her hair [Applause] praise the lord that's what the message produces a wife that has a modest spirit and attitude a wife that loves you sticks by your side when you make mistakes that's because the message is real you might have been in the message and your father abused you i want to tell you that wasn't the message you my dad he gave me lots of it did not feel like love brother tim that's the message that's what the message produces no no your father i'm sorry to say this your father did not receive the baptism or the holy ghost in its entirety because the holy ghost would do it out of love every time this could help some young man or a young family that's screaming or here i want to tell you you can correct your children in such a way that they love it they're thankful that you told them they were wrong little girl right there you should be thankful when mommy or dad tell you no don't do that but what's happening pressure on a family today just let him do it just let him do it really just let him touch fire and burn their hand just let them touch a button on the internet and burn their hand no i'm not going to let that happen in the message so if you want to go into a denominational and go to your church idea and you like that kind of jesus because that's what it is your love your jesus and if you don't like that jesus and the baptist you'll go to the pentecostal then you'll go to this then you'll go to that and it always leads because you aren't happy with this religion you're not happy with that religion you're not happy with that religion and bound you're so bound up you just need to make one resolution if you've heard anything negative about william branham you need and you're listening on the internet too if you've heard anything negative i want you just right now to forget what you've heard i want you to think about who told you that that seed of discrepancy that was put in your mind and what is seen now that's a good word that's a good word because it's not bringing freedom i'll tell you that in my personal family it's splitting homes in my personal family this doubt this unbelief and we know yourself through scripture that it will be in family and it will be people in the message that will persecute you why because it's in scripture so praise the lord i find myself in the word i'm identified in the word who believes brother branham can find himself in scripture i wasn't going to say this but i'm going to say it brother branham was in scripture i want you to do i'm going to just find this real quick i want you to say amen if you believe not not if you might believe or you're wondering when you say amen if you only believe what i'm going to say brother branham was malachi 4 5 fulfilling scripture brother branham was the fulfillment of amos 3 half of us believe that that's how it is in church though you preach a wonderful service dancing in the spirit and two people their life will be changed i know what i'm talking about help us god that if there's only one i want to be at the altar i'm the pastor church deacon and i need jesus i'm the first one at the altar because my prophet had humility enough one time just congregation and i need jesus and that kind of man is the man i'll follow a man that when he's given a million dollars he says no i don't need your money because all that money is trying to make you do is compromise the word of god never accept money with strings attached never go to a church that has politics have a pastor that hates politics that will not allow politics in the church but what has happened in the message oh we got the group that likes masks and the church that doesn't it's i know what's going on right in this area i'm sniffing it out as brother codrick diggs would say i'm the great hound dog sniffing out things that are going on in this area because it's going on in our area too in washington state same devil arizona jeffersonville indiana the same devil same spirit devil's everywhere trying to attack the elect bride and i'm not going to be deceived i don't care if my family don't go i'm going if ruth i will be the ruth my family leaves me but i'm going to see boaz how many want to see jesus we're coming down to the end now you know brother branham where he was in scripture he was eliezer he was hallelujah we know where brother branham was revelation 10 7. that's wonderful it was revelation 10 7.2 revelation 10 1. and you probably heard a quote about building a platform and brother brandon built a platform for one man who was that man come on those of you that have a revelation of who that man was jesus not j even though it starts with a j eddie biskell not my bad brother john andes not brother tim pruitt not build a platform for jelly i don't even know his first name not brother gibbs whoever he is bless his heart but you are not the eighth messenger there is no eighth messenger that goes against the bible you antichrist that is the truth any messenger that comes and says i have a special gift of interpretation of this scripture is a false prophet doesn't matter if he's in the message doesn't matter if he's my friend my family member my grandpa that's when it comes down to the line i know that jesus is my savior i need to know that what i believe is the truth and it's bringing a freedom in my family the devil is attacking the message to doubt where brother branham was but it's also causing us to not recognize who we are do you know where you are in the scripture do you we need to find our type in scripture we need to find ourselves in scripture i haven't barely looked in my notes my who wants liberty to this evening for their family if you're if you're a husband or a wife you're going to have to receive something different than your neighbor then the teacher your kids might have to go to school with because if they see jesus more in their teacher and she's got blue hair and makeup she's a kind loving person eating dad or beating mom no wonder they don't want what you got the serpent slicky serpent came into eve right at the beginning and that same type is happening today in our schools in washington state sex education is mandatory taught from kindergarten to grade 12. that is prophecy being fulfilled i'm not going to say oh the school's so terrible i know it is i'm not sure and i'm saying publicly you shouldn't have your children education that is causing them to doubt the bible helpless god but we either have to do two things one we need to homeschool our kids or we need to have a christian environment for kids in our community that they can get together that's my vision my child is four years old next year he will be five years old i need to find an educational system if i have to do it myself i'll pour all my efforts into it because his soul is worth ten thousand worlds and i'm not playing games with my son's soul i'm not playing games with liberty or boaz's soul their souls are worth just as much as mine so i'll pour all my money i'll take a loan out on my house i'll take a loan out on my business praise god for my children's sake i won't let them go around jezebel's i think they can come in with their little cut makeup on their fingers and a pants and say ooh oh we're just friends you're a jezebel and you let our children play with it before you know it brother hugging each other they're kissing each other grade twos i'm a witness i was a teacher okay public school system i had to do a year-long internship and i saw it happen right in front of me unashamed girl that's the kind of school you want to say to no i wouldn't do it if my wife has to stay home and homeschool praise the lord i'll do what the prophet said my wife is a maker at home she's the pastor of the home she has a pastorship and her pulpit is her sink that she washes dishes over that she serves her her ministry but see a sister wants lots of money i gotta make six digits and have a career tell you something the prophet of god said jesus christ is number one and after that is a godly mate every single person once they receive the holy ghost and jesus christ in them and have a relationship with him they should be seeking not like desperation but they should be seeking the next thing to salvation and it's not money it's not a career i know this is really backwards and this is 20th 19th century but it is thus saith the lord it's saith the lord and i said that i said saith the lord and if you follow it thus saith the lord said only and i know said thus saith the lord you won't find these critics saying thus saith the lord no sir because they have zero vindication all they can do is they are fulfilling their scripture brother the skeptics are for theirs and what are we what you do now is what you would have done back then so are you job or are you job's wife who are you job how many identify with job i can take all my lands god you can take my house you can have my kids die premature deaths wonder if god is real that is brother tim who's looking for looking at him right now that's what happened i stress in my life who's had stress in their life financial strategy no money in the bank had to get a loan from my brother i've had it that's humbling stress to the point where you're so exhausted you don't know what how you can sleep it's the devil he tried to bind me but i've been set free the devil gonna tell me and remind me of my past because i've been justified i've been sanctified and now i'm filled with the holy ghost will those things come up brother oh yeah the devil's a good mastermind you did that a year ago it's the same that's not the spirit of god reminding you of your past not one bit god doesn't remind you of your past he shows you what your future is brother timothy and your future is clear your future if you have jesus christ the token life over you you will be saved how can i say that that is thus saith the lord because the bible says they that receive it that have the toe this is day a child didn't die you don't want your children to die in laodicea you the token that's a message you're listening to what message are you putting over your children tv is okay no sir science will tell you scientist psychologists will tell you that tv is killing their brain cells but they still do it science will tell you that smoking is your brain and your lungs true but people still do it science will tell you pornography will destroy your marriage and will take you further than you want to go people still do it say they're free in the flesh i don't want to be free in the flesh i want to be free in the spirit where the spirit of god can move in my family where we have family altar in the mornings instead of daddy running at five in the morning it's time to change your schedule it's time to go to your boston and you you have the leverage by the way in this economy because they need you go to your boss and say you know what my family my kids my wife are suffering you're having me work 15 hour days this is not of god i'm going to quit and you know what they're going to do they're going to say oh no no no what do we need to do we'll cut back your hours and we'll pay you more money hallelujah i can give more to the church i can give more suffering i can get out of debt debt is bondage not liberty debt bring people bound and causes divorce the number one reason why people leave churches while number one why people have splits in their marriage is money the number one reason but money can be one of the greatest pools in god's hands money can be used the right gift could go like this and go like this god gives and i give back god gives and i give back but we got two three million dollar churches today in the message this is their hands we only give to people except what we want them to do denomination you are a denomination because you're acting like it you're talking you are a denomination and you say brother branham is a prophet this message we will not turn into the method of the dale we don't want that who wants a formal church go have it here that doesn't believe in clapping doesn't believe in drums they don't believe in the holy ghost move and the whole move when i say that i don't mean shouting all the time because sometimes there needs to be real teaching right brother jared sometimes we need a whole service on family situations sometimes we need to take a whole service yes i'm gonna a whole service on how to spend money it's in the bible and i'm gonna say it i don't have it here but some of us need to do a plat credit card causing you to be bondage you want real freedom in the holy ghost cut up your credit card that's a natural thing but you need to cut up the credit card because you're missing church you on the internet because you have credit card debt and lines of credit and tons of it has matched you out to where you need two and three jobs i'm here to tell you something that maybe blow your mind you need two and three jobs you need one job you need to cut back you need to sell all your vehicles that you have loans on you you just sell your house cannot afford you single ones you guys don't buy a fancy truck like dad don't do it because ask dad i bet you you 70 right brother dale so you see grandpa and he's got the nice truck and the big farm in the big house and guess what a spirit comes in pastor the pastor has a big church he has a big house he's got lots of money praise the lord he's doing good for the kingdom of god we're destroying lies right now misconceptions in the message that money is a taboo subject cause giving to go up without asking for money because but the dale never told me to say this you only need 20 30 people that are real givers in a church to pay your pastor enough so givers oh no they're tim i cannot afford not to pay your guys that's by hey not pay off your debt back pay god you've robbed him no wonder you're in debt you say brother tim i've had a doctor problem i've i'm sorry if i'm going along brother dale i think we're doing some surgery here i think everyone's enjoying the service if you don't and you you're welcome to leave okay the door is back there some people say oh you pre too long brother tim well if if what i'm saying is helping someone i'm going to keep going because if i just keep going but they're felix and you're how old were the felix nine how they're you guys are all awake you're seven brother and you're awake and you're a little girl and you're listening how much did the adults be on the edge of their seat when we come to church in prayer and the kids are gonna come i'm gonna pray right now you have your kids sitting on the front row instead of sleeping in the back pew i've seen it happen when i was a sunday school teacher i told my kid i told the young boys i said that why aren't you sitting in the throw i said it one time because a child desires to please an adult get what happened the next service brother jared the front row was lined up with boys wouldn't i rather my kids in the front row see than sleeping in the pew at 10 11 years old and if our preaching brother dale is getting so boring so formal that our kids are falling asleep we're not preaching the truth because the truth brings liberty it brings freedom it comes up where people stand up doubt hallelujah i'm free i don't need debt i don't know the devil's i don't need to go and believe this sign because believe the sign does not believe the sign they're hypocrites they have a google that's and they will never change that logo you know why because the pillar of fire is on that logo and as long as they have the pillar of fire on that logo that's the only base of ministry they think about it take away everything on your site that's about brother branham they have nothing to talk about so why would we focus on a ministry of pulling down anyone now i'm going to talk why would we preach against george mueller john wesley martin i'm taking i'm talking now why would we even though we don't agree everything because we're christians christians means to be like christ so every person that's tearing down william branham's name is not a christian saying in simplicity out of love i love the people i have family that believe this garbage recycled garbage it's copy pasted every three months the same posts because they have nothing new under the sun they have new no new revelation all they've got is their 120 things and will bombarding your mind the same garbage recycling you know what brother dave this message is not recycled by minister this message is alive the true five full ministry are living proof living proof that the message is true can i get an amen you are living proof brother sister trust don't go against their is that support pastor 100 belief and any person that wants to doubt the pastor wants out what he's doing with the money you have every right to go to him there's scripture there's a scriptural bible way to do this you go to the person you talk to them they don't listen you take a deacon or another minister let me ask you this how many times it happened in your lifetime probably less than five times has anyone ever had that happened where it's gone through the whole time but we've had a lot of people leave our churches we didn't go the bible way we can say we're buying living by the bible we can say we believe a message but times we fulfilled the word in our churches in the last 50 years the prophet died read your bible prophet said pray every day and you'll grow grow grow you know that you know that song kids read your bible pray every day pray every day pray every day read your bible sister and pray every day and you'll grow grow who wants to grow who wants real freedom click unlike unfollow friend and block any doubting spirit they can be your family you have to block them on a web i've done it they send the message they're my best friends blocked you have a spirit on you that's calling things and saying it's black black black and white white no this is just gray and you needed light a message to show you if it's darkness or light eighty percent of things you don't know if they're right or wrong judge a person if a person walked in this room rather and they had makeup on cut hair and had no skirt on and were wearing the tightest pants ever what's the christian spirit attitude to do pray for them love them let them sit in the pew not say get out of the church you don't believe the message you think they're gonna believe the message power preached by brother branham no it wasn't brother branham's message brother branham's just a man like i am that's not putting him down that's lifting him up because he's just like me he says in his word i have to die out to william branham every day sister you're gonna have to die out every day and how to train your child and the way they shall go you do not need psychology you know some woman telling you that you need makeup to be beautiful that's a slicky devil to make your husband more attracted to you you need to just sheer up the skirt a little bit but i'm still in the message i can wear those eyelashes that come way out because my husband will look at me and make me beautiful if you're doing that sister and that's really attracting your husband you're bound you're so bound you're spending 30 minutes in the window in the mirror painting up face why not spend that 30 minutes in prayer praying for your children they don't need to see mommy up there butterflying her eyes for who your husband's already at work and i want to say something to all those people that think girl uh sisters in the message are bound every sister here that believes the message is not bondage please stand please stand right now in this service if you believe the message is not bondage for you it's bring a freedom two sisters three four video cameras this is the witness these peace sisters right here are walking in truth and you can say all you want that they need to cut their hair to be beautiful and they need makeup but i'm sorry friend these sisters are a standing witness right now to the devil they are free free that satan boom stand up sister for your sake for your young girls don't have them wear pants you don't have to ever wear pants in my personal opinion they can always wear a dress even their nightgowns can be i'm sorry if it's stepping on my nose i'm stepping on my wife's toes you've talked about this and she might be listening but i'm sorry you can sit down i'm sorry that might sound a little legalist for her that message oh you're legalistic well if my legal bringing me closer to this call me a legalist every day if i'm a legalist and my wife loves me how does that work i'm a legalist if you're legal you're always like documenting everything you know my wife she did this today to me and i'm gonna get her back legalists right oh let's go a little further brother branham did this in his life he was wrong you're a legalist you've made the legalist doc of all the things brother branham did wrong in his life yeah i can bring a lot of dirt out you too brother sister on the internet have the holy ghost and the holy ghost says i love you enemy i love them that spit on me that curse me that say the message isn't true i love you that's why i'm preaching the way i am do you realize what you believe is a lie it's bringing you bondage not freedom it needs to be said in our churches the message is liberty freedom and it's yours let me just tell you right now the only thing that will keep a marriage is jesus christ the only thing that will keep a marriage is in prayer together before you go to bed that's the only thing as soon as you take the message which is christ out of your life divorce will happen and they might even stay after they leave the message right which is christ i'm not when i say the mess i mean brother branham's message i mean they mean they left christ believe that what to live in separate life they now have no foundation because their foundation and what they believed is no longer the same because now they've created free thinkers and brother ernie villanueva who has gone on to be with the lord was a mighty man of god he said something very why would i open my mind and anchor and be open-minded who's heard that and let garbage come into my open mind you know what i'm not gonna have an open mind i'm gonna have a closed mind thank you very much and i'm going to be closed and heard what's your cloak what are you wearing a sister is wearing long hair because she has a revelation that god said in his word to have long hair is a good thing it's a covering for you it does not bring shame to have long hair it does not bring shame if your husband don't wear makeup it's actually a love because a husband right now could turn to his wife and say you don't have to wear makeup to be beautiful i'll tell my wife right now she knows this she doesn't have to wear makeup to make me beautiful you can turn to your wife right now you don't have to wife you don't have to because i never was attracted to you i was attracted because of your character hey man that's what the message produces character character enough to love your brother as yourself love your enemy as yourself who are you you are mary who believes that they're mary can they say i am mary i am rebecca that came to my bridegroom who many believe that they're rebecca if we say they're the bride of christ we must identify with the female part as we come to a close this is going to bring you liberty right now you say i am mary i am rebecca i am in scripture today brother branham knew who he was i'm rebecca i am ruth and i am ruth sounds weird doesn't it sounds like you don't know what gender you are well i'm here to say no we just found our type in scripture we are the female part that came out of adam we are the christ part that's coming out we are part of god people will not like you when you're part of god this is good preaching you're either gonna hate this love this or leave this hate it love it or leave it that's up to you your soul is worth ten thousand worlds though so you are in scripture saints let's have liberty let's have a freedom and let's turn to our bibles scripture amen man 740 are you kidding me brother brother brother you need to just yank the chain i think it's time to go we still got tomorrow whether tim's got a lot of energy praise god brother tim's not done fighting but i know if i in my sleep tonight i've done all i could do i punched up tonight it's been recorded so if i die tonight you can send it around the world i believe a message i believe a message by william branham he's dead but the god and you know where he's living he's living me you can crucify me take me to jail i'll still serve him not serve brother branham no sir serve the god of william branham the god and it's not another jesus it's not another jesus no sir deuteronomy 30 verse 15. i feel the devil is getting his head cut off and we're not running around we're running around room but at the end of the service we're going to do something a little bit different we're not going to have an altar call we're going to lay our hands on one another pray for one another because the family that prays stays the church that prays stays and you might not even i don't even know you sister someone in the church no one knows that sister or a visitor that will come tomorrow we might not know them but we can pray for them just like that brother said we can pray for our brother and they can wear makeup they can come in here with long hair smell like cigarette they can smoke like i had a friend and blow it right in my face and i still love him and i just told him one day you'll hate those and he was blowing it right in my face deuteronomy 15. is that what i said are 30 30 verse 15 see let's start with 14 the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy saints of god we need to speak the word we need to believe the word in our heart your heart will change and when your heart changes towards your husband and you don't think he's you but you know he loves you guess what it doesn't matter what he says you know he's got your back i have workers at my workplace that work for me he might even stream the service i don't know his whole motto is tim whenever you're gone i've got your back if a worldly guy doesn't even know me from adam six months ago we hadn't ever met i'm gonna say something right now if you looked at his facebook page when i hired him you would have not hired him goals it looked terrible on the outside it looked terrible when i had him come for the interview i would wait brother dale but now that same man is in a management position at my company making the most money he's ever made barely smokes anymore attitude has completely changed in six months because he's in a workplace that shows that they care for him if you have a business pay your people more money that kills it kills any doubt that they don't love because you say i care about you in my company but if you're not giving them more money and you're saying oh no inflation was seven percent i understand but we're keeping your salary the same you've literally told they're not they're worthless to you i'm sorry if this is too natural and carnal but this is right down we're living if you have a business you need to pay your employees more you say brother tim no yes you will lose one profit but actually no you'll gain profits you know why because you show that they care they'll work when i'm not here and i'm preaching today they worked for me and them see how god works and when i prophesy again when you show people that you care for them and you love them and you show it you don't say that you you show it by action then guess what they cannot deny the jesus you serve they can't deny that brother branham was a man of god one bit because you are living what he said humble that's what we need in our church i'm prophesying that if we treat people right they'll want what we got that's what a prophet said live a life now i have a choice right here before you everyone i have given you a choice today this day life and good or death and evil brother felix your dad is making a choice right now to do what's right and good guess what brother felix what's your name again brother elliot same as the middle name of boaz that's right brother elliot your dad and mom have made a choice good in life and they're gonna try and train you in that way right but one day brother elliott have to make choice or death and evil and if i show my child life and good and being a christian can be fun what sorry you can be a christian and have fun you can play baseball and it's not a sin to play baseball what you can clap hands in church what when i know churches in the message that think it's wrong to clap are you kidding me the lord and give him a hand class let's deny lift up our hands into gravity let's choose a living church not a dead church where the pastor has fully to walk around and run around the deacon in the bat he can praise god my dad just elected a deacon in the church out of his church home church is not amen he said hallelujah he claps his hand and he even gets excited praise god that's the kind of deacons we want not the deacon in the back oh brother said i'm a policeman so i've got my gun my quotes i ran one time in the church you're not allowed to come in the church legalism no wonder they think we're legalists i'm gonna say the deacon comes to you you're being too loud in the church i've had it i've had it yeah don't laugh it's true whoo loud in the church i'm going to give a real tip and i hope the old things don't misunderstand if you need to turn down your hearing aid so that others can praise god just do it let them be free because you combined younger ones and i'm doing this out of you i hope you understand i'm doing this out of respect but older ones can children and say why did you clap in church why are you willing to sit in the front row that's weird praise brother branham preached a message for that i'm an oddball elliot [Applause] i'm different than the world so your dad's different little girl he's got jesus in him and if jesus is in him then our children will want jesus my titus boy will be a titus in the bible because i'm true to the prophet's message paul is the same type for my family i found myself in scripture my son i mean my dad called me timothy in the bible because i'm gonna follow the message that's finished then i made my first son titus because he will stay in that message by the grace of god will the devil attack your family yes he will but by the grace of god the tokens apply i'll quit my job i'll take out loans if i have to go on vacation cause i gotta show my kids i love them and we'll send thousands of dollars overseas but are have a fun night you can't take your wife out on a five dollar coffee date shame on you i do it every week almost take my wife out for a coffee take our meal once a month it's in the budget though better start you better start making your roi investment and believe me a five dollar coffee will go a long way but people are caught up in their business profits work seven days a week out of their mind and they'll lose their wife you want me to give you some examples who's ready jeff bezos bill gates richest man in the world and what do they both have in common right now they don't have a spouse jeff bezos is amazon well known who knows who jeff bezos and amazon is everyone knows who amazon is right everyone knows apple and steve jobs was did you know steve jobs who was the creator of apple was also very atheistic in his belief he leaned on science so then i gotta wonder if i'm gonna have an apple computer i'd have full subject to the word of god and not let that thing become a trap in my face i'm not saying the internet is bad i'm not saying facebook is bad because young people and guess what i'm gonna say it publicly preached against something you watch 90 of young people it's in them to do that that they said not to do so i'm a piece of counsel and i hope it helps some young parents okay when a child is doing wrong do not focus on the bad behavior focus on the good thing they just did if you if you told will stop doing it automatically this is crazy this might sound crazy to you but if your child hey how you doing you're listening so good do the rest of the service and when daddy tells her that at the end they go out for an ice cream this is the gospel on the gospel and you go to dairy queen eat it brother for twenty dollars you take your wife out cause she wants a drink that's the gospel for money because oh we're barely able to make it well you got yourself in come on look in the mirror you are the problem you the problem get right get going the bible way sell all your cars that you have debts on or get out of debt stop going on vacations for use that vacation to get out of debt and if you have to cut it up i have an apple watch i'm going to say it i have an iphone what yeah i have that in my home but there's people that believe that you shouldn't have internet there's people that believe that facebook is antichrist facebook can be the greatest tool in the right hands to defeat the devil i know what science says about facebook it's bad for our children's brains but it can also be a great gospel we can send out the truth through it and if we're not edifying jesus christ in our social media whatsapp facebook texting talking not doing it in all other news forgive me god how many want to say forgive me god if i've done anything wrong if i've ever texted someone god forgive me let's just went on and on but right now we just want to talk to jesus how many of us have come into church and we've gone out and done the exact opposite my hands raised and forgive me god i don't want to be a hypocrite i don't want my children to think i'm a fake christian forgive me god for shouting at my wife forgive me god forgive my wife when she doesn't mean to do it forgive them and i can be on the cross like jesus forgive those that have crucified prophet william branham message that he preached and have criticized his life forgive them for they know not

he's that amen it's so beautiful you know i want to [Music] you know so many times you know we're a triune being and when we can get out of this flesh and get in the anointing then we're heavenly beans just for a few minutes we're heavenly beans now i want to share something that our prophet said you can still play honey i just want and this is in perfect gratitude you know a prophet was asked a question about martin luther king jr and something he had said and brother branham had said that he believed he would lead his people to a massacre and they were asking the prophet if that was what he thought or he believed would happen and this is a key point and it's happening right in our midst this morning tonight this is how the prophet answer died he said so many of the times well he said like this let me i would say four things he said be so careful what you listen to now he's talking about himself no i'm not knocking the prophet but this is the part i want you to get he said so much of the time there's so much flesh involved if you have a problem with a brother or sister it's not god it's just flesh it's just flesh if if you have a disagreement it's not god it's just flesh if you have a problem with me it's not god it's just flesh there's so much flesh that we've divided over flesh i don't like potatoes i like fried rice has nothing to do with god it's just flesh just less and people hated the prophet many times just out of flesh they didn't like it that he was a hillbilly any and he spoke funny just flesh had nothing to do with god it wasn't the life of god and if you've got struggles in your family it's just flesh if you've got struggles in the church it's not because god eat god god's the same today as he was yesterday 30 days it's just flesh it's just flesh you you and your this presence is beautiful but if you have a problem the same people have problems it's just flesh it's just it's just flesh and you know you can you can you can show that so beautifully by this experiment there was a dad and i'm gonna close with this there's a dad that had four sons and he sent his sons out to see the same thing at a different time he said once i know to see this this object and the sun come back in january and he told him what it looked like right he sent another sent out to look at it in may the son told him looked at the exact same thing told him completely different story and he sent his son out in august he looked at the same thing he told him it was completely different right and he sent his son out in november they told him four different things it was the exact same god identical god but that god was dark and cold at one time that god was green at one time that god was beautiful flowers and blossoms at one time and then the god was loaded with apples and fruit at one time and all four of the people and that was just flesh it was just flesh it was saying god it was just a flesh seeing something and we get so riled up sometimes in our flesh and it was the same god god help us god help me god help me you know that's where you see with the way of the world and things are going amen is that satan will try to roll up our flesh over lockdowns or anything anything anything money anything why family job car tires i mean anything but god's liberty god's deliberate god's all the same even though we might look different god's tall and skinny god's short and fat god's brown and god's white and god's black amen because the bible says that god is a spirit yes and those that worship him amen must worship him in that spirit amen hallelujah that's beautiful amen god bless you thank you for the beautiful people have come and and brother tim pouring out his heart and especially gordon dot god bless you for coming in man our friends and and uh we look forward to tomorrow man let's just say a word of prayer lord jesus we just counted great privilege to be here and just the lord more than we love the word lord but we sure love your
