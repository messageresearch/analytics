up your mind to go all the way with him tonight amen Dory amen yeah that was an accident sorry about that um anyways I uh I've sung the song before it was very short notice I actually uh it was a couple hours ago the Lord put him apart and I wanted to read this verse because I felt it was um pertinent to the song it's Matthew 21 verse 44. it's where Jesus is talking about the stone the builders rejected and he goes on down to verse 44 he says excuse me and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder you know I was uh This song is called Beautifully Broken I thought of The Book of Job and everything you went through whether he was touched in body he lost his family he lost everything he had even his wife told him you should just curse God and die he lost everything the confidence of his family that was still alive the even his friends doubted him and said you must have sinned or something but in all of that God was trying to take something outside from him but he had to break him in order to do it this song has been on my heart for like a year and a half and it just never felt right to sing it and it just this evening it just felt right so I just pray it's a blessing to y'all [Music] I find myself alone again my hopes and dreams caving in I find myself alone again [Music] wondering this will end but then a voice calls out to me surrender all so you can be Beautifully Broken and perfectly scarred Your Love overwhelms me I am never too far with Grace like a river it washes me clean [Music] what was lost inside of me I'm Beautifully Broken [Music] Beautifully Broken I find myself with you again take control I'm giving in foreign myself with you again we're broken things amended [Music] but then your voice calls out to me instead of making you a masterpiece and you're beautiful [Music] I am never too far with Grace like a river it washes me clean ringing to life what was lost inside of me I'm Beautifully Broken [Music] I'm Beautifully Broken [Music] I find myself with you again take control Lord I'm giving in I find myself with you again [Applause] we're broken things a million dead but then your voice calls out to me instead of making you a masterpiece and you Beautifully Broken your perfect list [Music] me I am never too far with Grace like a river it washes me clean bringing to life what was lost inside of me you're Beautifully Broken you perfectly scarred Your Love overwhelms me I am never too far with Grace like a river and washes me clean bringing to life what was lost inside of me I'm Beautifully Broken foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] make all things new you make all things new I made all in you I made all in you you make all things you [Music] I made all in you oh I made all in you oh I made all you I'm restored in you I'll be stored in you into Beautifully Broken perfectly scarred Your Love overwhelms me God I'm never too far with Grace like a river it washes me clean bringing to life a little feet inside of me from beautifully broken a Beautifully Broken [Music] [Applause] God bless you all this evening I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus wasn't that a a lovely song I've always wanted to preach on that scripture about falling on the rock which would you rather fall in the rock of the crush Rock Crush you to powder let me fall on your rock Lord amen God bless you this evening and um I just want to say Luke and Kristen God bless you it's good to have you guys here uh I don't know how long you're going to be here and everything

anyway uh uh I just happened to mention I said I broke my nose when I was 14. surfing in California and broke it you know when I went over the falls with your surfboard I hit my nose and I pushed my nose up under my left eye lifeguards come got me and everything long story short I looked into the mirror in the lifeguard station and my nose was over here I looked like a monster and I'm vomiting

rhinoplasty they call that where they fix the nose I said uh septoplasty whatever you know anyway I didn't know what it was until I youtubed it the morning after surgery and that's the worst thing you

brother Ron how do you do you feel good I said not good but better I'll be better the Lord willing by Sunday I I want to be preaching to you on Sunday got something really deep on my heart but I want to say we are finishing up right now we are in the last two phases of the remodel of our church one is going to be the lighting we have the lighting here above us and it's ancient it's the old type lighting and they're going to be redoing that and all of these speakers that you see here 22 years old the sound system it's ancient and so we're going to redo the lighting we're going to take down all of these speakers that you see here and we'll redo the ones here on the platform and so that's in the next couple weeks remember when we remodeled the church we took the carpeting that was off the wall right that's a sound proofing that helps deaden it that's the reason that our brother and in the back have been having hard to trying to get it to sound right sound panels gonna be all the way

because we have given ourselves to you father not only have we received you as our savior but Lord as Lord of our lives and so we're inviting you this evening that you would come by the foolishness of preaching and that you would touch our hearts and Lord touch Our Lives father God that we may know how to serve you Lord that when we leave this place father questions would be answered Hearts would be uplifted father God whatever it is the needs that's upon our hearts that those needs would be met we love you we thank you for this opportunity to be together we ask that your presence would be with us now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen praise the Lord God bless you this evening it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord once again and if you have your Bibles turn with me to the second book of Corinthians and we'll read chapter 3 and verse 18. praise the Lord thank you musicians Hallelujah second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 and it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord notice that it says we are changed into the same image in other words we are not going to be in this image of the Earthly forever but we will take on a new image amen First Corinthians chapter 15. just a few pages back there verse 41 through 49. and it says there is one glory of the son and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown in a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy somebody say that's me sure it is the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy for those who were earthy guess what you are going to be earthy it's natural and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening I would like to perhaps just finish up this little series that we've been speaking off on God's School of humility and this is part five and I would like to take for the subject it's all about image it's all about image and brother Austin as we Minister here this evening you'll realize why the Lord put this song upon your heart because it goes right along with the service so now when we first began on this little series God's School of humility we began looking at the Statue of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and how this statue it was uh it was a symbol and it was a representation of not only the Gentile Nations that would be but it was also a representation of our humanity and of who we are as human beings as individuals and so we see that in that dream that God loves our Humanity so much that he takes that image of humanity and he strikes it with a rock that's exactly how much God loves our Humanity not only does he strike it with a rock but and not only does he smash it into these little pieces but the Bible says that it was smashed so small that it was like the chaff on the threshing floor and that when the wind blew it blew it wherever it would understand that this is how much God thinks of us in our Humanity this is how much he thinks of us in our earthy bodies this is how much he thinks of us in this bodily image that we take so much pride in he hates it so we realize that uh what happens is that each and every time that we come to church that this rocket it is it is the it is Christ the word and when we come to church what is that rock doing it is smiting this image of humanity and so understand that when God does something he always does it for a purpose and when when God crushes something he just doesn't leave it in a crushed State when something is broken he just doesn't leave it broken but God is a restorer of those things that were crushed he is a restorer of those things which are broken so what God does is he takes our Humanity he crushes it he tears it apart so that he can rebuild it again into the image of a statue of a perfect man because the first image is earthy it's carnal it's prideful but this second image is humble and in the image of God and that's what God wants out of us he doesn't want us in this earthy image but he wants us to be in the image that we were before the foundations of the world amen because that's what we're going back to praise the Lord so we find out that each and every time we come to church what's happening is this this Humanity that we love so much is being crushed lying upon line precept upon precept sermon after sermon song special after song special prayer after prayer however you want to put it God is doing away with our Earthly carnal man and he's replacing it with the spiritual image Hallelujah so we find there in verse 48 of our opening scripture it says as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy now our Humanity in which we are we are earthy you can say earthy you can say Earthly do you agree with me say Amen okay I come to realize there was there was something uh I learned from Brother Burley Williams and I used to think man you get a you get a minister up here and he's always trying to get the people to say amen and can you say amen and well yes I can say Amen but I realized what he was doing it was actually a very smart tactic because when you get somebody to engage and say amen back to you guess what it does oh yeah I can say amen amen it re-engages the people back into the sermon and what's being said it is so important not only for me as a minister to have a connection with you for me as a minister to have a connection with the Holy Spirit but it's important for you to have a connection with the Holy Spirit and so when you hear something that you can agree to when you say Amen you were connecting yourself to the spirit of God so when you're connected with God and I'm connected and we are both connected together it makes a three-fold chord the Bible says a three-fold court is not easily broken so if you do your part and you connect to the Holy Spirit and I do my part guess what's going to happen God is going to deal with hearts hmm so we find out that our humanity is earthy and that's the kind of person that our humanity is going to bring forth as an earthy or Earthly person an earthy person has a certain way of thinking an Earthly person has a certain way of acting they have a certain way of talking they have a certain way in which they dress why because they are Earthly but we are not just supposed to be in the image of the Earthly but our lives is being changed into the image of the Heavenly so when our lives is being changed by God the Holy Spirit gets what's happening the way we talk the way we act the things we say the things we think about how we dress how all these different things it's no longer Earthly but it's heavenly Earthly people mind earthy things and that's our issues is because we get so Earthly minded that we are of no Heavenly use God help us to cast down our Earthly man and to raise up and say father this is not the image that I'm supposed to be in now Lord let me yield myself that I might bring forth some kind of fruit that is pleasing to thee amen we get so caught up with our Earthly things that we forget which is most important in our lives and that's the spiritual aspect that's church that's having a personal relationship with God that's that's having a prayer life and all these different things is far more important in any of these Earthly possessions and values that we put so much high value upon Hallelujah in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 it says so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them so we realize that though we are born as natural people of the earth it is still God's desire as it was in the Book of Genesis when time first began there with Adam and Eve it was his desire that he would have a man or a son or a daughter that would be in his very own image or else he would have never created them in His image and so it is with us today it is still God's priority Hallelujah it is God's priority that he has sons and daughters that are in the earth but are not earthy it is his priority that he has sons and daughters in the Earth but are of the image of their heavenly father because when we are in the image of our heavenly father we do our Heavenly father's business so this is one of the reasons that we find out that God has to take us and he has to put us through this school of humility because he's trying to bring us from one image onto another image there's a purpose why God brings us through this school amen sir we would see Jesus 1962 brother Branham says he come to show what God was anything that's high and haughty isn't God God is low and humble that's what made him God see something that comes low not them that goes high so God doesn't dwell in hierarchies and things he dwells in humility and everybody said amen you see the Way Up Is Down look at this a teaching from the prophet of God humble yourself and you'll be exalted exalt yourself and you'll be humble that's right see God knows how to do it so you have to remember humble yourself before God don't try to think your own thoughts think his thoughts see so because we are people that are born in Earthly bodies and we are Earthly people of our first uh of our first nature I guess would be a way to put it everything that we've been building as our image as a human being God takes it and he destroys it from a very young boy guess what our young girl a very young person we're always building something within ourselves to bring forth some kind of image this is how I want to be this is how I want to comb my hair this is how I want to look and and on and on and on and throughout our life we're always building Upon Our image because we want to look good we want to be the the cold person we want to do this that and the other whatever it may be but all those aspirations that we have in our carnal nature guess what it is enmity with God so everything that you've been building this image of how you want everybody else in the world to see you God wants to take that image now and he wants to strike it with the word so what's the point in wasting our time I don't want to be building the image of this guy it doesn't matter how this guy looks in this flesh but it matters of what the character of this guy has so there's many different ways that we can preach about this thought of God's School of humility and how God uh destroys something only to build it back up again we could look at the story of the Prophet when he went to The Potter's House y'all remember that story and he went to The Potter's House and there the Potter was and there the wheel was before him and he had a piece of clay in his hand and the Bible says that that piece of clay it was marred in other words there was something wrong with it it wasn't and the image of how the Potter wanted it to look so now the Potter he takes this image he takes his clay and he starts to mold it in such a way he puts it on the turntables of this machine whatever it is called and he starts to add water to it he starts to break it up he starts to break it apart and then he begins now to put it all back together again and the image that he had in his mind before the foundations of the world and so this clade that we are a part of guess what it is marred and it is not in the right image as it should be so now God has to take us he has to break us and he has to remold us into the image of which he wants us to be in we could look at the the examples that brother Branham gave us of the beater of gold and brother Branham said they would take that gold and they would beat on it and they would beat on it and they would beat on it and they would beat on it until they could see their image in that piece of gold and so we realize that God does the exact same thing with us as Believers why does he do it because we are earthy because we are carnal and he's wanting to take that Earthly that carnality and he's wanting to beat it out of us not just for the sake of beating us but he wants to fill us now when he beats the world out of us he wants to come and dwell in US you see God always does something for a purpose we could we could look at the examples that brother Branham gives us that God is a great Sculptor and here's this this piece of ice or whatever it is and God goes to chiseling on that piece of Vice or or whatever piece of material it may be why does God do that because it's not in the right image understand it's all about image it's not about your image and how you want to look before the people but it's all about God's image dwelling and living through the believer we can look at the scriptures and how it says think it not strange concerning the fiery Trials of Life are how that God learned obedience by the things he suffered it's all for a see God is showing us through these many examples within the scripture that there's only one image that God really cares about he doesn't care about how we look and how our Earthly image is before people the only image that he cares about is his own image Hallelujah so what does God so what does God do now he brings us through this school of humility whether it's the school upon the Potter's clay whether it's the school of the the gold being beaten whether it's a the school of sickness within our body whether it's a school of of being humbled by our kids or whatever it may be guess what God has to take us through these fiery trials in order to bring us to a place Hallelujah that whenever he looks at us he sees his image oh my goodness why is he why is he doing this he's doing it because within every son and daughter of God as we all know there's a seed and God wants you as the Son and Daughter of God to bring forth of your full potential he doesn't want us as the bride of Christ to bring forth 30-fold or 60-fold but he wants us to bring forth a hundred fold in our lives and so in order to do that he has to take us through trials and testings he has to Humble us that he might use us because God dwells in humility questions and answers 1964 61. brother Brown says if he wants to do it so bad the first thing you know he finds himself a stuffed shirt like you say God you give me power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you if you just let me move mountains no he wouldn't he can't even get himself to the right attitude see he would never move mountains for God why because his attitude is not correct why because he is a stuffed shirt and full of pride notice this Fellowship 1960 you take a fellow that's always Lord I'll do this if if you'll do this and things like that God knows he'd be a stuffed shirt anyhow so he just takes somebody he don't want to do it and say maybe I can use him a little while till he gets to be one he noticed the problem with our humanity is that as soon as God starts to use us in a certain way we become a stuffed shirt and the moment we become a stuffed shirt guess what God can't use us anymore God keep us humble so that you might use us you see whenever we're humble before God God gets all the glory it's not look what I did for God no it's look what God did we don't do anything for God God's the one that does things for us he said so ah so that's about it you try to go get away from it all the time great ministry says always been someone trying to get away from it not who's always because let God do something for them then they get all puffed up big and how great and everything but a man that doesn't want to do it he just forced to do it and then he wants to get away from it as quick as he can get out of sight and that's usually the way that God works what's what's brother Brown I'm trying to teach us here he's trying to show us hey if there's somebody and they're full of big talk and they're going to move mountains and they're going to do this red flashing lights should be going off Sirens should be going off in our hearts er er something wrong here there's something wrong here this guy isn't in the right attitude to do something for God and if God does use them he'll become a stuffed shirt and take the glory to himself but now within the message people have been taught this so much that a lot of young people they say well uh I guess old people alike oh well uh they'll talk to you for 30 minutes about preaching and then say well I wouldn't ever want to preach because they know the right things to say at the right time so it's up to us now to have some kind of discernment and say ah I know I hear what you're saying I'm reading between the lines God help us now God will always deal with us according to our character and according to our temperaments whether we're bold and forward or whether we're making backwards understand it doesn't matter how you are in your natural person and your character if you're a son or a daughter of God God is going to deal with you amen and God will take you through the school of humility we get so caught up and we say well why Lord why me why does it always have to be me because you're a son because you're a daughter that's why amen my mom would she tells me once in a while she says she says you know son uh you'll always be our we son it doesn't matter I'm 35 years old and got a family and a bunch of kids I'm a man I'm a real man I can prove it you're always my son you always be our little boy my dad's the same way it would matter if I'm 60 years old and they're 85. you're still our little son I guess that's how everybody will always look at their kids they're always their kids I believe that that's how it is with God and with us it doesn't matter of our age or of how long we've been in the message or how long we've been serving God guess what we will always be his kids and so because we are kids he's going to deal with us as children Proverbs 3 verses 11 and 12. my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he correct us even as a father this son in whom he delighteth so what is the love of God I thought the love of God was just was just a big uh fluffy love and love love oh God loves me so much no if God loves you and you're a son or a daughter guess what he's going to do he's going to rebuke you he's going to chasten you he's going to put you through trials he's going to put you through Temptations because he wants what's best for you just because we're Sons and Daughters of God it doesn't mean that nothing bad is ever going to happen because it is going to happen and it will happen but when it happens it is up to us as Believers to always remember who you are I am the Son of God and because I am a son I'm being rebuked Lord the rebuking is hard the chastening of the lord lord it hurts but thank you Father why because you're showing that you love me the moment that God begins to stop uh if God never chastens you if God never rebuked you and you say well I can just live whatever kind of life I want I don't get convicted chances are you're not his but when you slip up and you say something wrong and you do something wrong and and and your your earthy man is is elevated guess what you're quick to repent ah you know the you know what you know what happens to us you know what we do with little kids you throw fits you know what the best thing is for him good weapon and you notice real quick my goodness I should have done that an hour ago you think dude you said it worked then it doesn't break their spirit as a kid but it breaks the spirit that's driving the fit do you see the difference well I just break that young fella I get I'll break it you don't want to break no Spirit of his let them be them let them be who they are but when there's something that's acting inappropriately guess what now as parents and you guys have all done it I'm in the midst of it greatest Time Of Our Lives they say between two and five guess what it's what you're doing all day yeah ask sister Ashland she'll tell you but what does it do we don't do it because for the sake of of of doing it and out of meanness but we're wanting it to bring forth a Peaceable fruit in their lives and guess what it works and that's what God does with us you know what when we get high and elevated when we get an attitude in our lives when we get sick and tired of being sick and tired you know what we're doing we're throwing a fit you know what God has to do then he has to come along and give us a little bit of correction why because we're his kids and that's what parents do to their kids why because we love them and that's why God chastens our lives no matter what age we are because sometimes we're just adults throwing fits and God lets it go for so long and then guess what there's a correction coming lets us go so far doesn't he so we find now that the love of God is not some uh Namby pambi love no God's love is corrective listen to this the exposition of the seven Church ages we're going pretty quickly tonight we're not going to hold you for very long brother Branham says and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view of Correction Jason does not mean to punish it means to discipline because his subject's amendment is in mind so why does God discipline us and understand he disciplines us according to our temperament if you're stubborn and hard-headed guess what he's going to have to deal with you a little bit harder that's just how God has made you we might as well get happy with it but if you're soft and meek and you still hey guess what you need a little uh correction God's still going to bring it but it's not going to be as hard as the other one why does he do it because he has a he has uh uh the subject's amendment in mind he has your well-being and mind that's the final goal Hallelujah so next time you ask well why why God has my best needs in mind that's why he's doing it why is he correcting me because he loves me this is exactly what we find in Hebrews 12 5-11 and you've forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you is unto children my son despite his not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if he endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chastens not but if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers in our flesh which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection onto the father of spirits and live for they verily are a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet somebody say Amen that we might be partakers of his Holiness because understand our Holiness and our righteousness is as filthy rags so now the chastisement of the Lord is to bring us to a place as a son or a daughter of God that we might be partakers of his holiness now that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous put his Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby so what does it do it's not just because God is is some some kind of God up here any any and and God is some kind of uh child beater and he just wants to beat all his children no he's doing it for a purpose that it might bring forth fruit in our lives it says herein is now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his home a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lumpy will now choose vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of the spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands amen sometimes as Potter must take the vessel he was working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be what a revelation that this gives to us as believers to say father through the ups and through the downs and through the good times and through the bad times through the Mountaintop experiences and the valley experiences through the fiery darts of the devil and all these things that we that we go through here and louder you see it to know that it is all for our own good purpose that God is trying to bring us out of this earthy image into an image just like how he is to know that the footsteps of the righteous are of the Lord to know that every situation that God has placed it in our lives is for a purpose guess what it takes all the worry out of it it takes all the the am I a son or am I not out of it it takes all the anxiety out of it why because we're believing the word of God and we believe and say father this is not joyous for the time but I know in my life it's going to bring forth a Peaceable fruit of holiness what a revelation it takes the why out of things it takes the why out of it and you say well I don't want to say why no more but I want to say father I don't understand but thank you thank you that I'm a son thank you that you show me your love through rebuking and chastening Hallelujah God loves us so much that he wants us to be a part of his Heavenly image he loves you so much that he doesn't want you to stay in a carnal state and so now he brings us through this school of humility every school is different in curriculums are different so every trial is different every upset is different everything that happens guess what it is all different everybody's school is different but God is bringing us through this school that we might learn to be obedient children God wants us to come to a place of full maturity he doesn't want to deal with babies anymore that was when that was that was when the when the uh when the church ages began guess what uh there's the Corinthian Church and everything they were they were little babies we're further down the road now we've grown now there's more of the word now the word has been unfolded and it's open to us in its entirety in its maturity and guess what he's wanting us to do he's wanting us to take part of this open book to become mature Sons and Daughters of God because with a change of maturity comes a change of thinking Hallelujah so this is very interesting the other week and I believe even us as as ministers and and even uh to everybody I suppose God will put uh have some little things in our lives happen for us to see the spiritual aspect of it and so like I said you know like many young families we're in the process of of child training and and everything and it's a lot of fun and so we found there the other week that little Henry comes up to Ashland and he goes mama you spank us because you love us right and he goes it's my Ashland goes yes yes it is that makes no sense [Laughter] and it was so funny she had him she recorded it and had him say it again here he is his little three-year-old mind is trying to grasp this this philosophy of of getting whipped and Punishment as a form of love and he's trying to grasp but then and in his little mind he he he he can't understand it why is it that he that he couldn't understand it is because he's a babe he's a babe in the family he's just a little child and when you're just a little child you don't understand the love of your parents and how they portray it to you through child training so it is with the believer as long as we are uh we have a three-year-old mindset towards God and we're and we're little babes in Christ and we're thinking to God and we're saying I I I don't understand lord I can't grasp how you love me when it seems like if it's not one thing it's another in my life and if you really loved me I I wouldn't have this issue if you wouldn't love if you didn't if you loved me I I wouldn't have done that and I wouldn't have fallen on this and that and on and on and on and on and on why are you thinking of the love of God like that for is because you are acting as a babe you're acting childish you're acting like a little baby with no teeth who can't Feast upon the meat of the word but it's very interesting whenever you look at the life of Paul because in second Corinthians 12 verse 7 through 10 it says now notice the attitude of Paul here Paul understands why he has what he has in his life and why is it that Paul understands this Thorn that's within his flesh it's because he's not a babe in Christ it's because he is a mature Christian and he understands the plan and the love of God Paul says unless they should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations he knew he had an abundance of Revelations the Apostle Peter Peter says uh Paul says things that are hard to be understood I'm sure when Paul wrote a letter a personal letter to Peter or whoever it may have been Peter had a question uh I don't quite understand what you're saying you're hard to understand stop speaking on those things keep it simple for me he knew because of the abundance of these Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure Paul knew him his own self he said ah I'm I'm uh I'm I'm a Pharisee of Pharisees and I was I was this and I was that and and I tell you what I persecuted the church and I did all these things Paul was a prideful man but he knew that he had to keep it grounded and he knew that God had to keep him grounded therefore he said this Thorn In My Flesh I know why it was given me because I'm a prideful person and God can't use me with pride in my life so I got to stay humble have you ever just tried to stay humble that's impossible so God now has to take us and make us humble why because he loves us for this thing I've been sought verse 8 I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness now notice most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and Necessities in other words and the things that I have need of I'm going to glory in those things and persecutions I'm going to glory in these things in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong Paul did not have the mentality of a babe in Christ but Paul came to a place of maturity where he realized the issues that he had in his own life was nothing other than the hand of God upon his life he wasn't out here saying well that makes no sense that makes no sense I'm I'm a first church age messenger and here I am an imprisoned here I am I only have one cloak here I am everybody has forsaken me uh uh why how can this be why Lord no he didn't have no little three-year-old mentality but his mentality was these things my needs my distresses my persecutions all these things that I have an issue with guess what they were given of God for my own benefit therefore father I will glorify in my infirmities I will glorify in my weaknesses I will glorify in my persecutions why it's the hand of God David what's God trying to do he's trying to wean us away from the sincere milk of the word and he's wanting us to walk and act as mature Christians Hallelujah as the musicians come I'll bring this to a close what is God trying to do what is he wanting to do what is his purpose in these things his purpose is very very simple that he knows we are people that are earthy he knows we were people that are carnal he knows it he knows we are people because of our first birth guess what we gravitate more to the Natural Things of this world than we do to the spiritual things of God but because we are Sons and because we are Daughters of God he's not going to leave us in this condition so now he takes the lump of clay he takes the lump of gold he takes these different things and fiery darts of the enemy and on and on and on and he makes it work together for the good for those who love God and are called according to his purpose oh and he takes us through this school and he takes us through that school and you say brother Stephen I don't like school well neither did I but here we are every day we're going through school and I hope you're learning because if we're not learning and you don't pass the test guess what's going to happen you're going to go through it again you're going to go through it again and you're going to go through it again and God is a god with great patience it doesn't matter how many times you got to retake the class he is not some prideful parent that's oh my goodness my son let's homeschool him so nobody knows they're 12 years old in first grade I don't understand how they can't pass the test no if you're 30 years old God will keep you in first grade until you pass the test if you're 40 if you're 50 if you're 60 it doesn't matter to God God will keep you in that place until you've passed the test and when you pass that test guess what he's going to take you through another class and he's going to take you through another class and before you know it you're going to start passing these classes because you realize if I don't pay attention I'm not going to pass so now God is taking us from this Earthly he's not just gonna take us and pick us up and set us over here our journey is from here to here our journey is from Earth to Heaven our journey is from Earthly beings to Spiritual Beings but guess what there's a journey in between the beginning and the ending [Music] so God's going to bring things your way he's going to bring situations your way gonna bring people your way gonna bring whatever it may be your way because he has a purpose why because your sons and daughters of God and when he gets us to that place guess what [Music] a Rapture is going to happen only thing we're going to take with us is our character he's not going to worry about this Earthly image that you've been building for all these years for Flesh and Blood shall not see nor inherit the kingdom of God [Music] so he's taken us back to what we was before it's taken us back to a place that we were before he's taken us back to a place where we will be fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God right now guess what we have the earnest of our inheritance but at the time of the Rapture brother Brown says that's when the fullness of the adoption the fullness of God the fullness of everything that we have ever dreamed of guess what happens it's going to take place and you're going to be there a table spread brother Brown said thousands of miles long God wants his children around the table brother Branham says I'll never forget it I remember watching this in my room as a sinner boy Rocco gave me this thing the DVD 20th century prophet Harry was he said oh my and there are this table will be thousands of miles long and the dream the redeemed of the Lord will be sitting on that table he's talking about the wedding supper honey says here our Lord will walk down the midst of the table and he goes it'll be no longer tears of sadness but it'll be tears of joy it'll no longer be Tears Of Heartache but it'll be tears of happiness and he says he'll take [Music] he'll take it his clothes he'll take His Garment and he'll wipe the tears from your eyes I remember presence of God came in that room said spirit of God will not always strive with man now is your opportunity it's the last time I'm calling you spirit of God will not always strive with man if you're out here acting all foolish you're out here acting like a little babe in Christ the spirit of God is not always going to strive with man so why is he doing this because he wants to have a family just like himself surrounded by sons and daughters that were made in His image that were made in his very likeness that have the same attributes as him that have the same characteristics as he has and when he walks down that table that's my son he may be surprised that you make it but God will not be surprised why because he has a plan for every seed plan that they will go if they started a they will make it to be there's nothing in the world that can stop the plan or the moving of God there's no sin that can stop it when he gets something in his mind guess what it's going to happen so now let me ask you this how have your thoughts been towards towards loudestia towards whatever it may be have you been thinking of God as a little three-year-old kid and the love of God and saying my goodness this this doesn't seem like the love of God in my life this makes absolutely no sense how can this be I don't understand and on and on and on have you been thinking like a little three-year-old or have you been thinking like a mature bride have you been thinking like a mature adult somebody who's been feasting on upon the word gnashing on it with their teeth no longer drinking the sincere milk and sin I still don't completely understand but God thank you thank you for the trial thank you for this thank you for that Lord It's Grievous it hurts yeah nobody likes it for the time being but it brings forth a fruit a Peaceable fruit in our lives have you been thinking I trust this evening that you'll think upon these things that we've said that you'll look at the scriptures that you'll look at the quotes and you'll realize who you are and why God is dealing with us with you because when we realize that guess what it brings it brings such a freedom you think wow this is so opposite to denominational love of God so opposite to my carnal understanding of the love of God be a brother Brown have taught it the word teaches it I see it in the life of Paul I I see it in the life of many others Lord I believe think upon these things and when you realize that God has got all things in control guess what oh it'll bring a joy to your life that'll bring us bring to your step it'll bring out something that you didn't even think was there at a time of seriousness in your life let's Stand Together let's pray father Lord we love you so much because you first loved us and we thank you Lord for your love we know that your love is elective
