in Time and Time After Time Again you coming and you revealing step by step Lord bless us tonight Lord as we going into Thy word and put me outside and knowing Lord it was so much of a greater blessing and unto myself let it be Lord father God unto your children tonight and bring more as you usually do even though we have L father God prepared what we know we're looking away unto you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen may the Lord bless you tonight uh it is once again a privilege to be found in the house of the Lord thank you musicians thank you once again Church of the Living God to be present uh in the house of the Lord to share a moment of the word and thank you brother Ron for the trust and to allowing us quite uh repeatedly to come to the pulpit it has never looked at as granted but we believe that by God's grace uh one step at a time and when you spend the time with the prophet you look at the way he grew in the world word and it just makes us realize how humble we are to be when we stand in these places shall we take the book of uh Exodus 12 verse 33- 36 uh the Bible says and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste and they say we we be all dead men and the people took the door before it was leaven and the de door th being bound up in their clothes upon the shoulders and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses and they borrowed of the the Egyptian Jewels silver and jewels of gold and Remnant and the lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoke the Egyptians may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated uh surely i' like uh to continue once again with uh the little Siri that the Lord has put on my heart what house will thou build me and uh continuing on that IID like to take uh a subject here Ministry of the sanctuary uh want to keep the eyes focus on that we started with uh choosing among the flocks what lamb that we are to choose and how do we proceed with uh such element believing and understanding that uh the lamb that we are pointing to is not a natural lamb or or a physical lamb that we come across about but we understand that the lamb is the Lord Jesus Christ or the word of the Living God that we are addressing about because of the word of the ministry because of uh how the Lord was Leading the People he spoke with uh Moses and told him that you go and free my people and they have to come and worship me in this mountain and this very place and uh the Lord uh I was uh quite nervous as I said that you know the more you deal with the prophet the more humble you are because I believe until yesterday I didn't know what route to take because I had uh pieces of the puzzle all over the place and uh I Believe by God's grace and I happen uh very late probably around 9 or 10 p.m. yesterday uh driving around and then it's almost like I was cut off from the rest of the world and and all of a sudden he says take Exodus 12 amen and I came I so rejoicing I say yeah yeah yeah yeah i' I have I have an experience on this and uh I I went home and and I told my wife I said yeah and I told him the experience and they said but you already preach on Exodus 12 then I get stressed again I say I say how am I going to deal with this then then I went quickly to to the Bible and before I know it I was like yeah he's always right amen yeah he doesn't he doesn't repeat things and stuff but is a that's why I say you can it it makes you humble yeah you can brag about these things that you know you know this you know that it's it's not it's nothing intellectual yeah it's it's nothing knowledge and trying to impress the Church in any shape or form is you he knows what the church needs and why have it has to be as at that moment uh the Lord brought the children of Israel under under uh 10th plague the people of Egypt said enough is enough the people have to leave but in the scope of uh what house will thou build me at this time we understand that these people were coming out to come and build the loads a tabernacle uh as they were coming out to build the Lord's Tabernacle the Bible shows us that they had need of certain materials they had need of certain elements to to be brought together and as they were preparing under the Passover we understand that without shedding of the blood there's no remission of sin there's no worship there's nothing nothing there's no relationship with God everything begins with the shedding of the blood and the blood of the Lamb gives opens the way because he's the one that went on before us and he he had opened the way he took the children of Israel out of Egypt and said that that and the people took their door before it was leaven they had all type of element we see type of silver gold and all kind of uh um things that uh they thought he was good for them to carry over because understanding that the children of Israel were in Egypt for 400 years you understand that they understanding the culture the perception everything it was according to the Egyptians and after all these Generations they felt more comfortable if anything that was of the Egyptians than anything that they were going to be that is in the world to come so it is with the Church of the Living God as we coming across surely we come uh from a different backgrounds and different understanding of life and things proven that we think that you know this is our way this is who I am and we and if whenever this happen to be a change in our lives we don't like it it's say like you no no no no no no I don't want that you know I'm conf with this and and this is who I am and stand strong and be confident in yourself but then that's not what the Lord was looking for and in Exodus 25 uh after they came out of the land of Egypt and they took all these things in Exodus 25 it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they may they bring me an offering of every every man that giveth it willingly to build the Lord's Tabernacle is not pushing us to be able to do that because remember his language when we started he say like you know off your own choosing pick from the flocks from the goats and the sheep and again he comes here and say like you know you choose yourself willingly you've chosen to follow this path pathway I've shed the blood because you chose me as the one but nevertheless in this stage of the journey you bring or you bring what you have willingly amen and every one of us according to our background we come as we are we come with our confidence our knowledge in technology our ability to play music and all these things the Lord said bring it to me willingly yes sir and this willingness will help in order to build the Tabernacle that the Lords want because if it's a force or if it's a a colonization type of thing then that there's no life behind it right otherwise it's like you know oh they come and they told us you have to have this long hair you have to cut the hair this way you have to speak this way you have to have this accent then it's not willingly as the Lord is coming down to speak with the children of Israel is looking he has something that he has dealt and told Abraham that I shall fulfill they were under consideration to come and fulfill this promise but then the Lord said like you know hey I know it is my Vision it is my program but you have to do it willingly give it willingly with his heart you shall take my offering and this is the offering you shall take from uh you shall take of them Gold Silver and brass and it just happened that these are the same things that they took from the Egyptians the lord gave them favor to get all this silver and gold from the Egyptians and here the Lord is said like you know bring it to me too you go to work and you make some money say like you know hey just give me a percent of what you're getting willingly nobody's coming to look at the pay Tab and say like you know you should pay this much nobody is looking into your business did you declare all this shareholders dividends and distribution as you should but he said do it willingly amen then it requires it shows us that it's not just the outward appearing of coming to this congregation it's not just the saying but it also the heart the condition of the heart must be ready in order to do this service unto the Lord the Lord is giving silver physically the Lord is giving understanding in the mind and the Lord is also looking for the heart to be willing so the heart must be a converted heart if it's not a converted heart then we have struggled with the mind and the body will be subjected to all kind of things and here we are and said like you know let them bring and blue and purple and verse 8 it says let them make me a centur that I may dwell among them according to all that I should after the pardon of the Tabernacle and the pardon of all the instrument thereof even so shall ye make it amen the Lord is calling them bring all these tools that you have all these elements that you have each one of us your background bring it your understanding bring it your perception bring it and he is the one now to take your perception and put it exactly way he thinks that it should go amen because if it's only you bringing your own perception according to I don't want what the Lord is telling me to do just as can the Lord said do like your brother you have the strength you have the ability you have the understanding but do like your brother he didn't want to amen he didn't have a willing heart that's true to follow what God was telling him and the Lord said like you know let them make me a sanctuary and now this making of the sanctuary is not according to the man himself coming around they said like you know oh K is said like you know I'll make a beautiful altar I'll make put flowers I'll put it in this manner it will look like this he said no according to the pardon that I've shown unto you amen it required a prophet in the land in order to get the PDN of the Tabernacle to bring it among the people so the people with their willing offering they can build the Tabernacle that's why I'm talking about what house will thou build me because if we building this house according to human understanding if it's not according to this paron and if we don't have access to the PN how shall we build because David was willing himself also to build the Tabernacle but the Lord said no no no no you've shed so many much blood it's your son that will do it but then unto whom the Lord has chosen to do this work is a privileged person yes sir but then at times even that privilege people look over it and they think like they're smarter they can do better than God they think that you know this life is just a way of them like you know I am this way I can do it my way I will say what I want I will live the way you want I want yes of course you will do that but there's an end to it amen but then unto the bride the Lord is showing them what is the PDN yes sir a tabernacle met out out of three parts the physical part that we see the most holy uh the the holy place that we don't see and the holy of holies behind the veil that you cannot see unless you are given access to get in that place brother Bram says nobody has ever seen William Brenham you only looking at the representation of it you only looking at the negative of him because the negative the positive behold the father's face and this Tabernacle that the Lord is building it said like you know the outer coat the uh the holy place and the holy of holies all of this has to be built according to the pardon amen yet we see that the out coat is made out of the materials that they received from the Egyptians and all these things now has they coming into the house of the Lord in the presence of the Lord the Lord said these elements I'm going to use them according to my vision to my pattern to what I have shown you Moses as the prophet had seen the vision of the Bride it said like you know I see the bride from Every Nation wearing according to the Nations as they were dressing up it was not as something that we come and say like you know brother uh David now from this day you start you should now start wearing a dressing like the Western people no even the angel of the Lord coming to the prophet on a physical is a physical appearance it didn't show show up as the people of the western people but he showed up as the Eastern people many times the angel of the Lord will take those shap and form and then we reject it because we are we have conceptualize how the word of God should come to us because of that perception then God's program can move forward and because of that said you know I wasn't expecting that to come that way I'm used to it this way because I've been with the Egyptians all these years this is what I know this is the my way of living I can't expect it to come this way no but then he said like you know bring it willingly right and I will use it and out of when the children of Israel came out in Exodus 35 then it takes among the people that came out and said that and Moses uh uh said unto the children of Israel see the Lord have called by name these are the people who were among the children of Israel he said you know I've called by name bezel the son of urri the son of UR and the tribe of of the tribe of Judah and he have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge in all manner of workmanship the Lord using people among us with all kind of wisdom and understanding to do a specific work the Bible says that they learned all these things from the Egyptians a child born in a certain environment will speak the language of that environment a child born of a certain in the forest will try to imitate the environment of the uh of the Jungle and these things right why because it's the environment regardless of that environment the Lord said like I'll use that in order to fulfill a purpose to fulfill the great work of the ministry and now this ministering Spirit are now been called Out Among the people to do the specific work to build a specific Tabernacle and as this tab Tabernacle are being built we are not to watch out on what kind of Tabernacle we are building right yeah because he said you have to do this according to the pattern I am calling Bez with wisdom understanding knowledge of workmanship to prepare the tools and the usil of the Tabernacle so it can you can be erected in the wilderness and here it is and and to devise curious work to work in gold and in silver in brass and in The Cutting of stone to set them and carving of hood to to make to make any manner of canning work and he have put in his heart that he may teach both he and OAB the son of AA a of the tribe of Dan them have he filled with wisdom of heart to work of all manner of work and to of the engraver and of the cunning Workman and of the embroider in blue and in purple in scarlet and and and and in fine linen and of the the river even to do even even them of do any work of those that device canning work I'm showing the Ministries that the Lord is bringing in the among the people to do a specific work but I'm not talking about the physical Tabernacle I'm talking about the Tabernacle of God because he said like you know what house will thou build me because the Lord does not dwell in buildings made out of hands of men therefore we are not to look at this physical building we appreciate the environment that we are able to have to we call the house of the Lord but that's not the place that the Lord wants to dwell because he has a specific place and now in these specific places that he has people around that Tabernacle using the background of those Tabernacle in order to fulfill God's program in other words that the prophet came to us with this great and wonderful message taken from the the presence of God seals being revealed being made manifest unto us in this last day different from all the organizations blew us our mind the things that didn't cross our mind or our heart and we never thought of uh the D of Jesus Christ the way we know it today that's right we didn't know about the SP uh serpent SE the way we know it today and yet now the prophet is come and gone but the work must continue amen and he tells him that I have called belil from this tribe I've called OAB of this tribe for them to take all these pieces and build the Lord's a tabernacle amen praise the Lord these Ministries are coming around about us in order to fulfill a specific work right and and as these Ministries are coming around us we are to be careful where are these Ministries leading us amen into what image are they shaping us we saw last year that Martin Luther a minister of the Gospel took the people right into communism and here the Lord says what house will thou build me men yeah is it after the F manner of the world or is it according to what Moses is brought down and fulfilled to be made manifest and this fulfillment is not just a spiritual fulfillment but it is a physical also fulfillment that's right because the Fulfillment the final evidence is the change of the body and this change of the body is the process of all these ministers building step by step step by step until the full manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God and he said that you know I'm bringing I'm calling these ministers and we all know each one of us as a ministry right and these Ministries as they are being set around us musician i s and deacons song leaders and helpers and seen and unseen they are doing a specific work but then we are to be now very careful what kind of ministry is being introdu into us because the prophet says that you know be careful don't be clannish he said but watch out the devil bring somebody among you it's a Ministry it's somebody with the word because a Ministry is the angel of Light am it's somebody well spoken somebody that can stand and uh say the whole part of the word and and just leave out a section of the word and it destroyed the whole pattern just as the devil went into the Garden of Eden and told her 99% of the truth it was a Ministry but he didn't build the whole Tabernacle according to the pattern amen because if it's not according to the pattern then we are just building an altar onto Malik and if we are building an altar onto Malo then we have to sacrifice our children unto malok but if we building the Tabernacle unto the Lord then we have to take our lamb and sacrifice it on the altar sir and this sacrificing lamb was has to be a perfect one and if he a perfect one it requires that the parent to be fulfilled accordingly sir you're going to see something more here now watch this Ministries are all set in the body but each one of them notice has their limitations right each Ministry you can watch around regardless of how many ministers you can listen to every time that you listen to one being filled with the spirit of God you'll see something different from the next one you'll see a different touch from the next one the more ministers you are listening the more wonderful it is to say like Lord you have given me the privilege to be built by all these ministers then the limitation of these ministers some of us will not remain in our God's given position we like to go beyond our god-given privilege the electricity in the house when it comes into the light it is the same uh electricity but it produces a different work of the ministry right the electricity in the keyboards and stuff it brings a whole different Ministry but then at times the keyboard wants to be the light I am the one being noticed by all at once oh they hiding me behind there I should be the one up there and we don't like to behave our positions and the Lord said like you know but the way I have called you is to have you specifically yes sir in that position for you to fulfill God's program amen but they didn't like it in numbers uh numbers three is the end the Lord spoke unto Moses saying bring the tribe of the of of Levi near all the ministers and present them before Aaron the priest that they may Minister unto him and they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the Tabernacle of the congregation and to do the service of the Tabernacle the ministry is being brought according to the voice of Malachi 4 that's why we don't believe in women preachers because Malachi 4 told us that that's not the place am but then they don't like that with the world system she can she's eloquent oh yeah she can do it better than any other man but the Lord said I have chosen Levi among the children of Israel and this children of Israel the purpose is specific each one of us have a certain position to play but then our god-given privilege had to be very cautious before our eyes amen and when we look at the Tabernacle that has to be built the Tabernacle I said was made out of three parts and all these three parts every single Ministry God has equipped them or given them the privilege that when they understand that if they do only what God has given them to do the ministry will be so successful but then success nowadays is not defined according to the pattern it's defined according to the world Amen I'm talking the ministry of the sanctuary what house will you build me brother whatam say I'll skip here just to take uh in leadership but says now he's showing us all the Ministries then I will go back to the Bible again now mama has taught you to walk a child is born the 16 elements was put together but you said now mama has taught you how to walk but in this modern world Mama doesn't want to teach them anymore no no no no no I have to take Dad's place yeah no no no no no I have to be on the street you read the message you can see all the quotations speaks about look at what is the greatest disgrace of the country look at how the devil is taken a woman out of his place why because the ministry didn't want to stay in its place yeah what house will thou build me because if you you are not in your position how will you do the work of the Lord because the children of Israel down there in Babylon they said how shall we sing the songs of Zion here in Babylon the work of the ministry the ministry of the sanctuary that the Lord is looking to proed and to dwell among the people the Lord said mama has to take the child first the first teacher the first Minister The Fifth Gospel amen she has to take hold of him or her the child in order to make the first stage Papa has taught you how to be uh to be brilliant and and and and a nice young man and how to take care of yourself and behave yourself mama has taught you how to communicate that is coming now to deal with you now in the spirit level mama is dealing with us hey come here I'll wash you come here eat all the physical element momy's teaching mommy's teaching mommy's teaching then that takes over just as we come in the church we come we listen to the word in the outer Court oh the environment looks it's good I like the music oh I like what these people preaching I think it's good it just got to your mind amen physically you hear oh you see everybody wearing skirts and they say oh I don't have much skirts let me go get another skirt you being influenced by those Ministries and now if a Ministry is now not willing to stay in it position like I'll dress anyhow I'll cut my hair I'll do all kind of things you understand that God's vision is being sabotaged is being looked over when he can stay in his position in his responsibility but what I'm says that every is the priest of his home right he's the one leading the way and now if the father can stay in his position what house will you build me very good the teacher has taught you in education how to pronounce word the phonetics and the language structure public speaking when you stand in front of people you stand this way you learn all these things we all went to school but some of us didn't like school either how to read and write but now you are living Papa you are living mama and you are leaving the teacher now somebody has to take you from here on all these people follow these Ministries are working uh consecutively or one after the other in order to lead you somewhere because if they are not doing exactly what they supposed to do you see the child coming said the child can't read the child can talk and the child can keep a communic a a uh a sentence and doesn't know how to present himself and disrespectful to everyone that doesn't know how to shake hands and greet people around the the world and things then you know that a Ministry has fell somewhere remember the Lord has said that he has given them privilege from the Egyptians to have silver and gold and brass and all these things and they are bringing it willingly onto to the Lord I am going very slowly so that it's not confusing of how why the physic these physical element are important in God's Kingdom so that the holy place is important in God's kingdom and even the holy of holies is important in God's kingdom amen because he wants to dwell among the people and by wanting to dwell among the people he calls all these people in different stages with different type of work for them to fulfill and when us the briad of Jesus Christ we look around and we understand our god-given privilege of what we can bring forward it's not something that you know as myself I'm not a singer I can sing I've tried it never worked but then if I start talking I can stop I can force it why because it's God's given gifts according to his own desire to place Us in the Kingdom calling us onto the ministry for a specific purpose thank you Lord I can choose all my life to try to become a musician but brother Ram says like you know yes you know if it's not God's given element you know it's just a struggle left and right but you see them even a child that is born without even taking a a music class will just set in front of those kids and startop playing them why God's given privilege God has anointed them with wisdom and understanding what house will you build me the ministry of the sanctuary let's go back to the Bible and now as the Tabernacle is being set I'm taking the Shadow the type of uh uh of the Tabernacle here in the wilderness so we can see another layer the limitations of the Ministries around the Tabernacle that the Lord wants is wanting to build and the Lord spake unto Moses uh numbers 3:23 around the Tabernacle says that you know the families of the gites shall peit behind the Tabernacle Westward watch what the Lord is doing and the and and the Church of the sons of gersan in the tab in the Tabernacle of the congregation shall be the Tabernacle and the tent the covering thereof and the hanging of the door of the Tabernacle and the Cong conation of the congregation and the hangings of the court and the curtains of the door the door of the Court which is by the Tabernacle and by the and by the altar round about and the cords of it of all the service thereof the Lord is defining the ministry amen just as I'm standing here it say like you know on the back there we have all these ministers back there or take the person that is next to you behind you there somebody is bringing an atmosphere right he bringing a Ministry if the person behind you is joyful you get carried by the spirit too if the person behind you is slumbering and out of focus and in having all kind and before you know it it's on you butam says like you know in the prayer line he say like you know watch out the spirit is calling help from one another in order to bring more unbelief among the people why because the devil has the pardon of what God has and is duplicating it in all our services the type of wife that you are choosing to marry is bringing an atmosphere around you this this was on the the Gite will be behind on the west side and um numbers 3:29 the families of the son of Kath shall pitch on the side of the Tabernacle Southward this is the South and the chch shall be the Ark of and the and and the table and the Candlestick and the altars and and the vessel of the sanctuary wherewith the minister and the hanging and the all the service thereof merari on the North 3:36 and under the custody of the sons of marari shall be the boats of the Tabernacles and the bars thereof and the pillars thereof and the sock door thereof and all the vessels thereof and all the the servers that there to and the pillars of the CT roundabout and the sockets and their pins and their codes the Lord is splitting the work amen don't try to be the next fellow's job don't try to preach like the next one don't try to come on the pulpit when you can just be on the pews and be praying William Brenham shows said you want to see the reason these meetings are having a success it opens the door and man is praying he say at this time my wife is out there praying for me y when he's going to work somebody's working is praying for him he doesn't even know that somebody's praying for him he doesn't even know why he's getting all the success in his business because there is a Ministry sitting in his position doing exactly what is supposed to do praise the Lord but then when there's no such a thing around us what house are we building and we'll see the consequences of building the AR according to the Tabernacle and according to how the prophet saw that Tabernacle and how the mind of that Tabernacle shall be how the soul of that Tabernacle shall be what kind of Revelation is supposed to be but here we just laying it around that we see that around us we are to be very careful we can say like you know we've come to Jesus we worshiping in The Message Church but that Ministry that environment can be very deceptive we prove it according to the word according to the prophet he said like you know many times the churches has become businesses amen they have a different agenda than God's program that's why it say like you know then when a church becomes focused in the in the uh uh in money they say that church is done there's no way back and when you get in that type of church then you start to see the type of focus people have right right the mind is turned around how deceptive they can be how negligent they can be Accord with the word such a place that we are standing conscious and the Lord said uh Leviticus 12 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying if um sorry I wanted first numbers 3 uh 38 but uh those that encom before the Tabernacle toward the East even before the Tabernacle of the congregation east east word shall be Moses and Aaron and his sons keeping the charge of the sanctu for the the charge of the children of Israel and the stranger that cometh night shall be put to death if the person is not recognized among the Ministries and try to get close to the Tabernacle it is death amen that's why I say like you know it is a great responsibility to stand up here amen am I giving God's word or am I giving my mind am I giving my interpretation of the word or am I giving God's word right is it according to the pardon yeah because William Brenham went to hell and you saw all kind of Tabernacles and one day he stand and looks and said oh my God those Spirits are here those Ministries are being made manifest but then the Lord said do not worry there's another one coming back around again hallelujah how all of us we have come from Babylon we have come from all these kind of backgrounds but then the Ministries that I'm pointing to that we are to be very cautious that it is according to the pattern amen that's why is showing that the Tabernacle laying standing there he puts Moses and his Aaron and the sons of Aaron on the east side and it puts all other tribes on the three other sides and all of them or on the four sides and all of them the form they Gathering the throne and as they are gathering the throne they are respectively bringing an anointing as it is in Revelation 5 that on the throne was surrounded by the four living beasts one of them a lion one of them uh the ox one of them uh the men one of them the eagle as they are sitting around was to God the Tabernacle so that everywhere that the Tabernacle goes so that those Spirits goes with them as we are seated in the church surround yourself with people who are anointed because the more they are anointed the more you are ready to fly because Ezekiel Saw the throne coming down he was always surrounded by all these four living beings and as they were surrounded by these four living beings they were ready to fulfill God's program at all time but then when God's program is not according to what God has shows the shown the prophet we are unable to get anywhere we can fool ourself and say like you know in the message we are I believe the message and all this this is Brother this is what I believe that's why I said like you know last time you better understand what what type of choice that you make out of the lamps part of the doctrine here portion of the doctrine here but then when you sit with the part of the Prophet you listen to him you look at him from 47 all the way up then you start understanding wow I thought I was a Christian I thought was just going to church I thought it was just like you know hearing A good sermon and paying the tight all these stages out quot holy place and most holy have the specific things and these Ministries each one of them have the limitation you can see an evangelist can only take you so far amen it's not that he's not an it's not he not a minister but that's what God's given him but then it requires all these four living beings in order to make the complete program come to pass because he said I the Lord has given them unto some he has given unto some he has given unto some he has given right but then when a minister start calling himself a hole in hole he can preach it all he can know it all watch out because the Lord wants to dwell among us and this Tabernacle that we are speaking about about is we are talking about us our body our mind our soul the Lord said he that defiles his body the Lord shall destroy right amen yet a minister will tell you like you know yeah the body is not really that important say if you don't take care of your teeth they'll pull it out it is God's Tabernacle if you come to church without excuse me but then you'll make everybody else uncomfortable if you come to church with your mind all crowded by workload and left and right and your mind is not focused then quickly you start spreading it around and if some of us are weak and cannot hold hold up the faith and quickly start affecting everybody else did you see what the pastor preach and you know I don't really believe that you know according to what I know you know all this now you start bringing all kind of mind botles in the church before you know it what is that all kind of Ministries that we are bringing around us that we allowing as I believe brother Ron usually said so like you know you and you go you listen left and right and you end up you know with all questions and that you can't even answer and yourself you can't find a way because you didn't follow God's program that's right he said do it according to the p and some of these ministers they will come to a point because they were not God orain man just as brother bam speaks of balam he said like you know hey look at what he does he calls he wanted to strengthen his uh uh uh to strengthen his uh his uh uh personality in front of the people he can he went and joined himself and and started showing how to get to God's children and Destroy them and weaken them and all these things so it is that we are saying today ministers all over theam this andam that and all these things here what are we doing we allowing these Ministries to get into our mind amen and once they get to our mind quickly they find their way into the soul let me prove it in the word quickly and then we shall finish Leviticus 10 1-3 and nadab and ab the son of Sons of Aaron the word the Bible is recognizing them as being ministers right they were positionally placed there to minister to the Tabernacle but look at what they're doing and took either of them his sensor and put fire therein and put incense there on and offered Strange Fire before the Lord when we come to the pulpit we can can we can have the idea to impress the church I'll preach a sermon that will be outstanding nobody has preached like this before Strange Fire and this is the result he said like you know which he has not uh Str before the Lord which he commanded them commanded them not and they went out went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord then Moses said to Aaron this is that the Lord spake saying I will be Sanctified in them to that come n on me night me and before all the people I will be glorified and Aaron held his peace amen I can say like you know that brother bite like you know that he's not a minister no he's God's given Ministry but they were just overcame but what God has given in them they went a little bit farther the mother just went a little bit to become a little bit masculine Minister wanted to have a higher speech but I'm saying like you know they would even use voices that that they would the the the the Pastoral voices they wouldn't speak like that normally but then when they come around sister you know according to what God has given me we have the greatest Revelation here I'm quoting they just want a little bit farther then each one of us in our ministry mother father teacher whoever we are it has to be according to the PN and to the level of access that God has given us sir because God is said to the woman that she can only be saved by being a mother and doing what continuing in the faith but then when she doesn't believe she say no no no no no no now I can just like you know be a free woman freedom freedom is that what you call Freedom and when you die you don't see that should dying because when America turned from God look at America you'll be foolish to stand up there and say like you know America is what are you talking about this the greatest nation we have the better Road systems in the world we have the best diplomacy in the world but it didn't look like it God took the kingdom away from Saul it didn't look like it the man kept doing what he supposed to do we kept preaching like we usually do but we already dead now I'm calling us to be aware of the type of Ministries that we are looking at that we are setting ourself onto amen all this goes to the father mothers preachers in the church and everywhere in the workplace and all these places that we putting ourself into because those at places they have atmospheres those music have atmospheres as I preach it last last time last year I Believe by God's grace regarding music and all these things you look at them they just like you know innocent people they look good they write good words and good Melodies and all these things but then how come the prophet a man who was singing uh uh NIS Presley and all this good music when you listen to it naturally and you say like you know it's evil inspired Al Presley with all that the rhythm of el Presley compared to what the churches have today who has went farther then Elvis Presley or us I'm showing us the ministry of the sanctuary because the Lord said I'll be Sanctified and glorified among the people amen yes let's be aware of what we are doing with this amen of what we are doing with this and what we are doing with this all these three codes because when nadab and Hab went they didn't go into the holy of holies but they went into the holy place to offer sensor they didn't go farther but they just went into the mind they just offered a Strange Fire into the mind oh sister you know you know know really it's not really that you know really actually also have a quotation here you can also have these things here like that do you know the consequences quickly death set in say like you know EAB in the church but it doesn't look like it but says he say he say look at this woman she was a Christian woman she stands there and she goes to church and and all of a sudden then she moved into a different neighborhood after moving in that neighborhood she start seeing how the girls and the women in that neighborhood that was dressing and they were going to bars and things then she say if they can do it why not me right oh if they can listen to that music Why Not Me butam said you see she started battling her mind mind after battling a mind but then her soul caught up with her on a death bed then she realize I am lost why the Ministries that we are surrounding ourself with amen the ministry of the sanctuary I am placing these things here so we can all be have the clear understanding that despite of who it is that you are Liv listening to you yourself must have the pattern amen you have access to the tapes and to the books because out of the same books and tapes any Minister can preach any type of sermon that he wants as long as he knows how to read and listen he will conceptualize anything of his of his own willing because of his lustfulness he will dress you the way you think they should be dressed maybe your weakness sister the way that you are dressing is influencing the younger ones around you in the faith without realizing true then we have to be very careful amen very cautious the example that we are setting before each one of us as I was when I was teaching the Sunday school back in Colorado one of the child came to me I say where's your notebook I said you know I don't have it I say I quickly cut the spirit I said like you know Hey listen you know in this environment we learn how to respect each other these are the basic things if you unable to just be respectful go to your mama let him let it let her teach you because that's leadership right taught us that Mama does that it's not us it's a simple thing look around after service you see somebody pass by you shake their hands God bless you brother God bless you s some of the basic things but then if that doesn't work how are you going to serve the Lord because that Ministry requires a whole different level of understanding right the lord requires that he has given us that element in our lives that Ministry that we may fulfill and when the child understood that I said like you know brother I'm sorry I said like you know we are brothers amen that's why we here to help each other at times he can be very basic and very cutting in some places but it is very important amen that parents that we are leaders that we are in all our level of responsibilities understand what house are we building him I can go on and on showing brother bam say like you know he say in U unwelcome unwelcome Christ he say like you know look how the when the uh The Prostitute went to buy the the the to buy the the the the perfume he say like instead of the man standing there as a gentleman to say like how can I help you it's say what do you want at times you see that among the people these are things of the outer Court these are things that have to be learned to be gracious these are things to be held in the mind so that when the Lord does when we see brother I was listening that to the prophet the other day he comes and the woman walks on the pulpit but he couldn't say what the woman was going through on the mic he puts the mic on the side and they even blur what was said on the on the on the tape I said like you know you see you know I couldn't say that to the public what does that work of the ministry that's right respectful of the people that you are dealing with the atmosphere that you are creating and the type of Tabernacle that we are building because as by God's grace that we are seeing all these four corners being surrounded by this anointing and these anointing will influence everything that will go into the holy of holies because remember Aaron will go into the holy of holies once a year the sons of Aaron will go into the holy place to offer Ence and the sons of the levite the rest of them will take care of the outer courts this Tabernacle as the Lord is building it he said I will be Sanctified and be glorified among the people amen it's not a choice the choice was given when the people had chosen to choose that lamp and that lamp to become what cover them in order to go and build the temple without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin amen and if the blood is not shed then what are we dealing with human reasoning the Egyptian mindset you reading the same Bible Shalom didn't understand that she brought with him his son that he had that she had with an Egyptian and when the child came came into the camp of Israel there was certain manners to behave then she looked and say she start he started cursing then the Lord said bring him before Moses he come before Moses say Lord what do you want us to do he say Stone him all these things are laid down in the word specifically regardless of the background where we come from sorry he hased that he wants his church to reach Amen on the outer Court in the holy of hly in the most holy uh in the Holy place and the holy holy of holies all these three stages you can say like you know I I want pay much attention to the out of place outter court because it's it doesn't benefit me too much why are we dressing up why are we dressing the way we dress why do we think the way we think why do we believe what we believe all these places are very important to God's program amen he wants that building that house that Tabernacle that Sanctuary to be built but he's putting us round about each other amen where's your brother it might my brother's keep you are amen you are the ministry that's the more I'm standing here the more is giving me but I have to stop and that's the beauty of the word I didn't read all the quotes at times this is the hard place with the ministry it tells you take only one portion but you want a whole section of it and you come here none of it is being used but I believe that you getting what God wants us to dwell thank you Lord what he wants us to do if we are confused about the ministry that we have to do let's go back to the pattern open the book listen to the tapes let's know exactly what it is and let the Revelation come in let the Revelation flow because without Revelation it is impossible to please God we are not here just making backgrounds like you know I'm African left and right I showed this about I believe two years back on Nim road we had the result of that every one of us different backgrounds and uh they split us into white blacks and left and right up and down and all these things but then until the Revelation comes then you start looking all those things different amen said like hey we are God's Garden black white and brown yellow whatever you are bringing Beauty to the Lord when the Lord looks at us in unity of the spirit of the faith and one Lord one baptism One Faith he's dwelling Among Us in humility amen but then Nimrod looks at that pattern and he started using it otherwise I can talk to that one hey he's inferior I'm superior hey I think like you know I'm this then you know that's not the ministry of the sanctuary that we are talking about that's right amen shall we pray heavenly father has a musician come surely Lord uh in Simplicity Lord father God our word is so perfect and so precise Lord this fite Lord father God of all the work but you know exactly how to lead your children in Simplicity Lord what house shall you shall we build Lord father God unto you Lord the prophet took this father God so far so deep Lord father God in places Lord that you have revealed Lord but step by step Lord you're making it Lord father God revealed unto us let Lord father God this word sink into your children's Heart Lord because father God that's where father God the beding ground that's where the seed is planted that's where you come to meet men that's where God Moses being there on the mountain being filled father God there the Tabernacle by the SP by the presence of the Holy Ghost Lord he came down he veiled his face Lord father God but in this day you are the unveiled God yes you're being revealed Lord father God in your children that L father God a pill of fire the leak of fire as it was in the hoer room will come down and be father God in every one of us Heart Lord whereby Lord you can be made manifest and put us exactly in our places so we can build you this tabernac Lord the more you give the more happy we are the more humbl we stay the more focused we are father God to build you this Tabernacle Lord Lord anoint L father God the vessels around us to lead us Faithfully Lord father God until Exodus 40 where the peill of the cloud came into God the Tabernacle and it was consecrated unto the Lord father today may be the last sermon we can go to bed and never wake up Lord [Music] but one thing is true we want to be standing L father God Faithfully in our position so when we come to you and say we can hear from you well said well done my faithful servant father we don't want to be like the sons of Aaron Lord to bring Strange Fire in any shape or form father to be conscious Lord of this precious word that you have given us in this last hour we love you Lord we praise your name we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen may the
