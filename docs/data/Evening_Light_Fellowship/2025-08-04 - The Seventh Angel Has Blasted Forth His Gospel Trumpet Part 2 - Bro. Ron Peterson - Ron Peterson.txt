Amen. Ask my son-in-law Ben if he'll come lead us in prayer this morning. Me and McGrady if you'll come lead us in prayer. Sister Pam Torres this morning says, "Please remember Sister Gloria in prayer. Barker. Sister Gloria has been having terrible headaches all week. And uh she said to remind the devil that he's a liar. So let's remember Sister Gloria, a very faithful saint here. Let's remember her this morning. We want to remember Sister Mary Anneus and their family and her. She's in hospice. May the Lord just be with her at this time. Uh Sister Maria Arasola would like us remember her daughters Rachel and Alicia. Uh they're going to Aaho Youth Camp with True Word Fellowship this weekend this week. So let's remember them for traveling mercies and the ones that are going to that camp this week. May the Lord be with them. Amen. All the ones that are traveling, let's remember them as they're traveling uh during this vacation season. We have two praise reports this morning. First from Sister Karen M. Uh we want to thank the Lord for what could have been a disaster. We were asleep around 11:30. Brother Neil heard our ice maker making a noise. Uh I went out there and tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't shut off. I smelled some burning, a burning smell. So, Brother Neil got up, tried to turn it off, and he'd seen sparks and smoke. And obviously, we unplugged it. If Brother Neil wouldn't have heard this, I suppose it would have caught fire. They want to thank the Lord for &gt;&gt; keeping his eye on them and keeping them safe during this. Could have been something big, but he made it small. &gt;&gt; What a caring God we have. We're so grateful for his loving arms around us. What a wonderful praise report this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a help. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Veronica says this morning, I'd like to praise the and thank the Lord for answering my special prayer request on Friday. He answered and he gave me a good outcome and he's always so mindful. Even when I was unsure of what to do, uh he has seen me through. He is so good in all things. Thank you for your prayers, Sister Veronica. God bless you. Amen. Do you have a need today? If you do, let's sing it one more time as Ben comes and leads us in prayer today. I need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord, right now. &gt;&gt; We got a need lifted to him today. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. I lift my hands to you. Oh, I lift my hands and bow my knees. I worship your I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. [Music] Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's just all pray. Dearly, Father, Lord, we thank you for the opportunity to be here in your house this morning and worship you and come and to receive from you this morning, Father. And first of all, we just uh want to pray for each one of these needs uh both uh written requests and unspoken requests. God, you know each need. You know exactly what uh everyone has need of, Father. And you're an ontime, present God. and we just come before you, Father. Asking that you would be here in our midst, Lord, and just let your presence and spirit come in our midst, God. Cuz Lord, we know that where you are, miracles take place, Father. And we're asking for each one of these needs, God. And asking, Lord, uh that you would just be with the ministering of the word today, Lord. That you would speak to our hearts, God. Let us not just be hearers, but doers of the word and prepare our hearts, God, to receive from you. Father, we want to give uh you the praise and honor and glory for the uh the testimonies this morning. And God, we also believe in that there will be testimonies coming out of this service. Father, we just ask God that you will anoint the music, the the worship, Father, and anoint us as as uh listeners, God, and let us uh enter into your atmosphere and your presence, God. And just let your spirit be with us this morning, Father. We just ask all this in the name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you shake your neighbor's hand and welcome to the house of the Lord this morning, Billy Silva has a friend Isaac here, another coworker of his. I want to welcome Isaac here with us today. Amen. Brother Mark Stany, if you'll come forward, he's got an announcement. Uh junior youth meeting today at Justin and Jenny Dubsky's house and that's at 5:30. That's Junior Youth 5:30 uh at their house. And we also have an announcement to make and I think we have some pictures as well. But we would like to congratulate Carissa Chavez and her fiance Noah Smith. They are engaged now and we want to congratulate them and may the Lord honor their footsteps and guide their hands. But we want to congratulate you on your engagement to Noah. So God bless them. Let's give them a round of applause. Amen. Amen. Brother Mark, if you'll go away and give your announcement. &gt;&gt; And just real quickly, just want to take a few moments. Hard to believe we're into August already. A lot of our children are going back to school. And of course, that means Sunday school is just around the corner. And as we do every year, Sunday school will start the Sunday right after Labor Day this year. That's on September the 7th. And we do have an announcement on the bulletin board over on the Sunday school site. If you want more information about Sunday school, please see that announcement. Uh we do have three classes, ages 3 to 5, ages 6 to 8, and then ages 9 to 11. Uh we start 9:20 over here in we have them singing in the senior youth room and that lasts about 15 minutes and they're dismissed to their classrooms and they're usually back here in time for the preaching of the word. So just looking forward to what the Lord's going to do for our Sunday school this year. But we're doing just a something a little bit different this year. We've had a little bit of change in classroom sizes and we've got new families that have come. And so what we're asking everyone to do this year, even if you've been in Sunday school before, we have reg or I don't want to call them registration forms, but information forms and they're on the Bolton board over here. And we'd like each family to go ahead and complete that. It just asks for your family name, your child's name, or if you have more than one, you can put them on the back. Uh date of birth, your parents' name. We sometimes get new families drop children off. We don't know who the children belong to. So, we just get the parents names and a contact phone number if we need to get a hold of you during the week or something. And one other question here, but does your child have any food allergies? We sometimes have snacks for the children. And so, if your child has an allergy of some po some some sort, we'd like to know about that. So, if you could do that, once you complete that, if you give that to one of the deacons and then the deacons will get that to us or if you run into me, you can always hand that to me as well. Um, I think that's pretty well all I've got. Uh, we did not get a chance to present the Sunday school offering to brother Ron yet this year for this last Sunday school year, but I did count that up and the children gave $44345. So, we'll be giving that to brother Ron to do with as he sees fit. I think he still has the offering from last year as well that he was going to allocate and that was about $461. I think in the last three years the children have given between 11 and $1,200. So, just want to thank the of course you as parents have a big part to do with that, but just want to thank all of the all of the children for faithfully giving. It's a joy to watch them dig in their little purses for their their change every every Sunday morning. But if you'd be in prayer for the Sunday school this year, I know we have regular meetings for the junior youth and the Sunday or the senior youth, but uh Sunday school happens each and every Sunday. We go September through May and appreciate each of our teachers and all the helpers. And most of all, we would appreciate your prayers. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you a blessed people this morning? &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. Name them one by one. We thought about this song yesterday. A lot of people are looking at the trials they go through. &gt;&gt; Count your blessings &gt;&gt; because we are a blessed people this morning. Amen. Put your hands together and let's worship the Lord this morning. Unlike fellows who dischar when you are discouraged thinking all is lost. Count your many blessings. Take them one by one. It will surprise you what the Lord has done. So count your blessings. Make them one by one. Your blessings. See what God has done. Count your blessing and them one by one. Count your many blessings.

Give him praise this morning. Take this whole world. Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated this morning for a few moments. Uh we have a baby dedication this morning and so we want to sing that song. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus as Ethan and Hannah Stany come. And I'd like to ask the the grandparents if they would like to come and uh be with us up here as we dedicate this uh new little love gift to uh the Stanky family. Yes. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on over here. Come on up a little closer. Yeah. Yeah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is all part of the cycle of life, &gt;&gt; youth meetings, infatuation, engagement, marriage, children, dedication. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what he does, he gives you love gifts. &gt;&gt; He takes a couple and he makes them a a family by giving them little children. And that's such a great responsibility because he said, "Take these little children that I give you and raise them up in nurture and admonition of God." We thank God for our Sunday school teachers and stuff because they have a part to do in all of this because prior to even them understanding what we're preaching in here, they preached to them in the back classrooms and we bless our Sunday school teachers and and everything and uh we're just very very pleased. Let me read the scriptures, then we'll take the baby. The Bible says in Matthew 18, "And they brought unto him also infants that he should touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called unto him unto him, and suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. Now, we do not baptize infants &gt;&gt; because they have not come to the age of accountability. Now, the prophet of God, his teaching on that was because I had someone ask over the internet just a few days ago, brother Ron, what was the prophet's teaching of age of accountability? And he said, up to about 12 years of age. Now, some mature faster than others. That's true mentally, physically. But I want to say he said it was about 12 years of age, age of accountability. And prior to that, if a child were to die, &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said all babies and children prior to that age of accountability go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Talk about God's love. &gt;&gt; God's love. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so his teaching was that what you do is you take these little children and you dedicate them to the Lord, okay? And you name them names that are going to have an effect. He said, "Stay away from Ricky and Elvis and different things because they've got a a bad meaning." But you have chosen some names here and we're going to read those names. And they have chosen to name this little son August Grant Stanky. August means consecrated and venerable. I said, "But he was born in July." He said, "No, brother Ron." He said, "August is actually a is it a family name from your grandfather? It goes back quite quite a a ways." So, we thank God for that. You named it August, consecrated, venerable, and grant means great and to bestow and to be given blessings. &gt;&gt; So consecrated to be great and bestowed &gt;&gt; many blessings. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And it also means tall. So hopefully that helps. Now, that's that's what he wrote. I didn't say that. Hopefully, that helps. For Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man, upon his son, and upon his brother, that he may bestow upon him a blessing this day." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's Exodus 32:29. And our prayer, this is what they wrote down. Our prayer for August is that his life be consecrated unto God and blessed throughout his life. &gt;&gt; Wow. What a &gt;&gt; a great request &gt;&gt; that these parents have asked. &gt;&gt; And so we're going to take this little child now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you turn him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There we go. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Get a photo here. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Let's just bow our heads and our hearts. Heavenly Father, as I hold in my arms, August Grant Stanky, one whose life is consecrated &gt;&gt; that he might be bestowed many blessings. I pray you, heavenly father, that you will bless this young son. May he grow up to be in the stature of a perfect man according to thy word. I pray, Father, that you will bless Brother Ethan, Sister Hannah, as you've given this little love gift. May they watch over him, teach him, and tell him about the great things of God and the price you paid for our sins. And that you've given the good gift unto his children. So, Father, I pray now as I dedicate him back to you for a life of service, &gt;&gt; Ethan, I consecrate you now and dedicate you back to him who gave you life. The parents conceived, but you gave life, the breath of life. Father, I pray that you will bless him all the days of his life. Lord, watch over him. Keep him safe and secure. Father, in an evil and dark generation that is uh bombarded with all kinds of things to try to deceive and to take away and to hinder the things of God. I pray watch over his little hands what they touch his feet where they go. His ears what they hear, his eyes what they see. May you, Father, watch over him and keep him close to you is our prayer. We dedicate August Grant Stani back to you for a life of service now in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you grandparents say amen to that? Huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Praise the Lord. All right. &gt;&gt; What was that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We dedicated you guys a few months ago, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. That we're all getting old. God bless you. Watch your step here. Watch your step. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I wanted to say congratulations to Sister Clarissa, too, and the Chavez family that uh they have an engagement. And uh Noah's going to be moving here, right? Or are you going to go there? I think you're going there. You know, the scripture says that the woman goes where the man is, but uh we're kind of we guard over our youth and we'd like to have them all here, but we all understand that that doesn't happen all the time. Amen. And praise the Lord for the the praise report of Sister Lori &gt;&gt; for her to pay to take a few steps right now. If you knew the situation medically, what the doctor said, &gt;&gt; okay, that that is a miracle in itself that she's taken a few steps. May this be the first of many and may she go come back come back to a complete restoration, &gt;&gt; walking on her own. &gt;&gt; We just ask God to do that. We thank God also to brother Kelly McMillan. Now, it's been about almost four weeks since his uh operation. So this four weeks posttop and he had throat cancer and they took part of the back part of the tongue. He said they cut him down on both sides of the cheek under the chin. did all this operation and um they did a study where he took some uh radioactive ingredient to drink it and they took a picture of him being able to swallow and they said that things aren't functioning the way they would and one doctor said you may never eat or drink again and I uh spoke to brother Kelly yesterday and he's listening right now very faithful brother in Christ. And I told him, I said, "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst." And I said, "And but you've got that spiritually." But I said, I I said, "Now, we're asking God for a miracle. The doctors say you may never Well, hey, listen. They say you can never walk. You can never whatever. Hey, listen. We don't have to take the doctor the doctor's prognosis. So we can say we have a higher court of appeal. &gt;&gt; We go there and by faith &gt;&gt; we call those things that are not &gt;&gt; as though they are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're just praying you. You pray with me &gt;&gt; that we'll see in the next couple days. &gt;&gt; A miracle to happen in brother Kelly to be able to eat and drink once again. He's lost about 80 pounds. uh being fed through the nose and then they're doing a port in the stomach right now and everything. But hey, listen, that's not the way God intended us to be fed. &gt;&gt; Huh? So, we're just asking God for a miracle. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. Open the eyes. Open the eyes of my heart. Oh, open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. &gt;&gt; I want to see you. To &gt;&gt; see you high and lifted up. To see you high and lifted up. Shining in the light of your glory. All around your power and love. We sing holy, holy, holy. I want to see you. I want to see you, &gt;&gt; heavenly father. &gt;&gt; We have an open book before us. &gt;&gt; As we have opened your holy scripture, And yet we know that though one might have the education and the understanding to be able to read, to write, but Father God, it takes the opening of the understanding of our mind and of our spirit that we might see the things of God. For the education of this world does not unlock your mysteries, nor your love, nor your redemption. Therefore, Father, I'm asking by the supernatural element of the opening of our understanding by way of the Holy Spirit, would you come make the scriptures real to us? &gt;&gt; Make it alive. And Father, once we see it, may it become a manifestation in our life. Yes. &gt;&gt; I thank you and I praise you. Bless each and everyone that is here. Those by way of internet, those by way of archive, &gt;&gt; however they hear the word of God, &gt;&gt; I thank you. We even have a brother who streams our services uh very faithfully and he's blind, &gt;&gt; but he streams and he hears. And so, Father, I pray that you will bless him too abundantly. father as we just met him here just a few weeks ago up north there in Oregon and he stood there on the second row. He said, "Brother Ron, I've listened faithfully for years, but this is the first time I've ever met you." Father, I pray &gt;&gt; bless our brother &gt;&gt; and those Father that hear the word of God. Bless this congregation, this group of sheep, Father, that you have placed under our leadership. May my leadership be your leadership. &gt;&gt; May it not be my interpretation. May it be your interpretation. &gt;&gt; May it not be my viewpoint, but your viewpoint. Father, come now and speak to us from thy word. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. God bless you each and everyone. Remain standing if you'd like to turn with me into the book of Joel chapter 2 and chapter 3. Joel chapter 2 15 and 16. Joel chapter 2 verse 15. Blow the trumpet in Zion. Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly. &gt;&gt; Gather the people. Sanctify the congregation. Assemble the elders. &gt;&gt; Gather the children and those that suck the breast. Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet. &gt;&gt; So as he comes forth from his chamber, she comes forth from the closet. &gt;&gt; So we see that this is all connected together with this blowing of a trumpet. Amen. Joel 3:es 9-14. Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles. Prepare war. Wake up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near. &gt;&gt; Let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen, and ye gather yourselves together round about. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be awakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat. For there will there will I set in the judge all the heathen roundabout. &gt;&gt; Put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe. Come get you down for the press is full. The fats overflow for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining, and the Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake, but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. May God bless the reading of his word. You all may be seated this morning in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to title my sermon this morning. The seventh angel has past tense has blasted forth his gospel trumpet. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is part two and I want to take the direction this morning or the subject of come out of her my people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, as we as message believers, I want to to take and expound on some things this morning. uh that we might understand a little bit more about why God sends a prophet in this age and with the revealing of the word that it causes spiritual conflict. Brother Brennham says when a seal opens it declares war. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it says there in the book of Joel, "Proclaim ye the ye this among the Gentiles, prepare war." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, there must be a preparation because if you're unprepared, you'll be conquered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're not understanding of what kind of spiritual warfare you're in, &gt;&gt; you can be conquered. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a system, a religious system that is rising up and it is called, brother Brennham said, denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's organized religion. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And that is coming and trying to anoint and deceive many to come into a world council of churches." It may seem like it's innocent, may seem like it's okay. And what difference does it make as long as we all claim that we're all part of this great movement of God and really God is the center of the wheel and all of the spokes of the different religions that come and and the center is God anyway. It doesn't matter whether you're Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal. It doesn't really matter. Or does it? For Jesus said, "I am the way, &gt;&gt; the truth, and the life, and no man comes to the father but by me." &gt;&gt; So God in sending a prophet, his ministry was to declare that there is a spiritual war on &gt;&gt; and we need to know how to fight the good fight &gt;&gt; because you know what? seducing spirits, spirits of fornication and adultery and seducing clergy spirits and all kinds of things have come in. And it started in the first church age after God sends the Holy Spirit, gets the church in order um according to Acts chapter 2. And then Peter stands up on that great day, men and brethren, what must we do to be saved? And he says, repent and be baptized. So he begins to enter into the church by giving direction of what you need to do to be saved. &gt;&gt; God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if what he instituted back then and if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, then we can see what he's done to know what he will do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the past declares the future. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, um I want you to understand that everyone welcomed the prophetic ministry of Malachi 4 up until the opening of the seals &gt;&gt; because the vast majority of places where he preached because there weren't message churches, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There were denominations, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, whatever. And they were all inviting him because they saw a great grip gift. And as Moses was given two signs, &gt;&gt; you're going to be given two signs. So you do this to get the attention. It's an attraction. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Getting the attention. No man can do these things except that God be with him. &gt;&gt; So now he was given the sign in the hand and the gift of discernment to get the attention of the people. But that's not what caught elected &gt;&gt; caught their attention. &gt;&gt; But I'm interested what catches seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm interested on what catches the soul of a person and causes them to be different. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so I wish to declare to you some things this morning that might be a little bit different, but just bear with me &gt;&gt; because I want you to understand what part of this beast system &gt;&gt; do you want to be a part of? What part of the Antichrist system are you going to allow and say it really doesn't matter when we're all one? &gt;&gt; What makes us different? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why do we gather? &gt;&gt; What makes us different than denominations? &gt;&gt; Because the rain falls on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; Don't they both rise up and and praise God together? So, I'm not talking about anointing. I'm not talking about signs and wonders. I'm not talking about &gt;&gt; doctrinal teachings. I'm not talking about uh healing the sick because the prophet's ministry was not just on majoring on minors. &gt;&gt; Majoring on minors. &gt;&gt; He says that's just the first and second pull. That's the attraction. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "What catches him?" Watch the change of ministry. &gt;&gt; And it happened in the days of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When he began to say, "Except you eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, you have no part with me." &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And many of his disciples were offended and they walked no more with him." &gt;&gt; Now, he did not become apologetic. He did not go after them. He didn't say, "I'm sorry. Excuse me. I need to kind of tell you it's not really my flesh and it's not my blood." He didn't do that. &gt;&gt; In fact, he said, "Does this offend you to the even those that were still with him? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, &gt;&gt; Peter. &gt;&gt; Why don't you go also? &gt;&gt; Where could we go?" &gt;&gt; So, there was a change in the ministry. &gt;&gt; And if I could say this, it was a purging. That's right. &gt;&gt; God is separating &gt;&gt; back then as he is today &gt;&gt; the shuck from the wheat. &gt;&gt; There's got to be come out from among them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to understand this ministry. &gt;&gt; So listen carefully. &gt;&gt; With the opening of the seals, &gt;&gt; it is the total exposure of the spirit behind organized religion. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the system, not the people. &gt;&gt; He said, "Good people in each one of them." &gt;&gt; But I'm going to give you some very astounding quotes &gt;&gt; of what the prophet of God said. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And how that your ignorance today will be no court of appeal if you miss the rapture." I'm going to show you some of these quotes &gt;&gt; because I believe saints of God, what happened when we when we look at the message of the hour, I don't want you to to it's like the pieces to a jigsaw puzzle. When a couple pieces put together, it doesn't give you the complete picture. &gt;&gt; So, you don't sit there and study, well, yeah, okay, this fit perfectly together. Yeah, but what about all the other pieces? &gt;&gt; You know, the border is easy to do because each side has got a square edge or a straight edge. &gt;&gt; So, a lot of times we put the border together and then we do the filling. I want you to understand that sometimes what we do is we as message believers have a tendency to micro focus on one piece to the puzzle &gt;&gt; and don't stand back and look at a great overview. Oh my, &gt;&gt; look at this. From 1947 until 1965, actually go back in 1933, behold as John the Baptist and the introduction and all of this, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we begin now to look as an overview. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that the prophet when he names sermons and gives them titles, &gt;&gt; it is a sermon in itself. When he gives you a question, who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Sir, is this the sign of the end? &gt;&gt; What is this attraction? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; Melzdc. &gt;&gt; He's making a declaration during his sermon for you to find the answer. &gt;&gt; It's an open book test. &gt;&gt; Open book tests are the hardest &gt;&gt; because Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All I know it's it's somewhere. Yeah. Let me see. I wrote it down uh years ago. I remember Yeah. Where where is that? And you spend all your time listen &gt;&gt; that and thy word, oh Lord, have I hid in my heart that I learn not to sin against you. &gt;&gt; It's not just head knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it it it's a documentation of his word there that when you do a query or a search &gt;&gt; in your life, if you do not have it on your hard drive, it says doesn't compute, doesn't come up, &gt;&gt; invalidatory search. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand when you go to church, you young people listen to this. When you go to church, you're hearing the word. It's logging into your mind. Jesus said, "My words are spirit and they are life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so you begin to see that you hear the word. Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. So you go to church, you hear the word, you read your Bible, you read the word, you listen to a sermon. All of that is the word coming forth. But that only brings forth knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. It gives you some kind of a um an understanding but it doesn't reveal the mystery of the scripture. &gt;&gt; So we need the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to make it alive to us because the letter kleth &gt;&gt; but the spirit giveth life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now watch the opening of the seals now revealed mystery Babylon &gt;&gt; the mother &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Unclean woman. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand religion is just a covering. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a man-made covering. &gt;&gt; We don't want religion. We want a relationship. &gt;&gt; And so you begin to understand that this system has began to work when the white horse rider went forth going forth to conquer and to con conquering and to conquer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's giving out his doctrine. &gt;&gt; It really doesn't matter. We're all one. &gt;&gt; God is changing. He's with his church and not with his word. and so so on and so forth. So now for for the seven church ages, we've seen now how the devil has wanted to come in and to send in his interpretation, &gt;&gt; send in his ideas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he wants to dilute the word of God. And once that happens in every age and that church goes off into apostasy, goes in with truth, rejects truth, goes off into apostasy, and the next thing you know, God has to send another messenger. &gt;&gt; Ephesus, Samrna, it on on until right down to this very age. So now we had here the prophet born 1909. This church age started 1906. So it was already it started because of the glosselia or the Holy Spirit coming down anointing the gifts over there in California called the Isusa street revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it began to start a Pentecostal movement and it was God and and and God manifesting uh the fruits of the spirit and so on. But it, brother Brennham said it was just a few years until they already began to divide and have their own interpretation. And he says really, he said, what'll happen, the further you get away from the revival and by the time the fourth generation comes along, there's just a few glowing embers &gt;&gt; of the original revival. Right. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that his ministry had to change. &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says there's coming a change. You all know it's been prophesied. He says back uh in with the first sermon that he caught the vision of what is the third pope and he titles it what is a vision? And he says,"I begin to see in fishing and little fish and a baby shoe and trying to this and that." And he said, "Don't try to teach Pentecostal PE babies supernatural things." &gt;&gt; And so we see the tent, the cathedral, and why in there, why that little room, etc., etc. Now, remember, all of these are symbols. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's word is &gt;&gt; symbols. &gt;&gt; The parables of God within the scripture are symbols. And the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who swed seed. &gt;&gt; Some fell in thorny ground. So on and so forth. All of those are symbols, are they not? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have to understand the prophet of God said watch the symbols and keep them correctly otherwise you'll get the cow on top of the tree and he never says chewing grass he says picking grass. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you never get that quote by saying the cow on top of the tree chewing grass. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's picking grass. Now since the opening of the seals, the denominational spirit among message believers began to close their doors and they said the prophet is no longer welcome to preach in their churches. &gt;&gt; Bobby McGary is a prime example of that with his pastor over there in Shreveport who was a great supporter of the prophet and had brother Brennham come to the meetings. But it was there that brother Brennham uh was going to he was taking a series of meetings and I forget brother Bobby what sermons it was but he was there in Shreveport and he was at the motel room and the local pastor had said he sent his some of his board members to go to the motel and tell brother Brennham he's no longer welcome. &gt;&gt; Tell them to not bother coming to service tonight. But they couldn't find his room. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; do you think God was in that? &gt;&gt; Couldn't find his room. Couldn't tell him he couldn't come. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand some of these that were great supporters &gt;&gt; at one time now close their doors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So now, Brother Brennham sits down in Tucson without any invitations for 18 months or three years. He says it a couple ways &gt;&gt; each time. But I want you to understand, he's no longer welcome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In fact, Brother Billy Paul told me, he said, um, the denomination said, "I'll tell you what. We will have you come and you can come to the meetings and perform your sign, do the discerning of hearts and do miracles and then when you get done, turn the service over to uh the learned ministry and let us preach because you're ignorant and unlearned. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; All they were interested in was the signs. &gt;&gt; The signs were an attraction. Right. &gt;&gt; It was the change of ministry of the revealing of the son of man in this hour that caught the seed. &gt;&gt; You might have been in all kinds of denominations. You might have been a Catholic. You might have been Pentecostal. You might have been in some kind of denomination of organized religion. May I call it this so that you'll understand Jezebel &gt;&gt; religion &gt;&gt; or a church that was full of blasphemous names &gt;&gt; do you understand? &gt;&gt; Don't let this offend you. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Take it for what it's worth and understand what was this prophet's ministry to do. &gt;&gt; He was not to just tell us how to go to church. or how to dress. That's a part of it. &gt;&gt; But if that's all you get out of it, you become a religion. &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry to say, there are religious denominations within this message already because they've gone no further. &gt;&gt; And so all they do is preach the legalism of how to dress and what to do and how to go to church when there is something far greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's step back and look at the overview. &gt;&gt; So this exposure with the opening of the word now rips off the mask of the system which is deceiving the people &gt;&gt; and it's doing it even today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a system that is rising up. Remember there was one that came out of the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And one come out of the sea. &gt;&gt; And this last one he said now watch. It started like a lamb. Revelations 13. He said it started like a lamb. &gt;&gt; Looked innocent. &gt;&gt; But pretty soon it took on the image of the beast and it spake with the power of a dragon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said, "What nation is that?" &gt;&gt; America. Revelation chapter 13, America. 13 stars, 13 stripes, 13 colonies. He said, "There she is, America." &gt;&gt; And he said it wasn't a lamb. It was a symbol. And when John looked at it, it looked like a lamb, but he said, and had two horns, &gt;&gt; civil and ecclesiastical powers. &gt;&gt; And he says it wasn't a lamb. It was woolly like a lamb, but it was the American buffalo. &gt;&gt; Wow. When you begin to catch this stuff, and I remember reading this in the seven church ages and hearing this on the tapes, I'm going, "Oh, wow. I was never aware of this before." &gt;&gt; I I I I thought, well, it really doesn't matter if we're Baptist or Pentecostal. It really doesn't matter because we're all going to the same place. We all believe the same thing. But when the eyes of my understanding become opened, &gt;&gt; I realize that the third pole is a separator. &gt;&gt; It is the sharp two-edged sword of the spirit. It is the unshathing of the sword that declares war. I read to you that this last Sunday. Amen. &gt;&gt; So understand when the prophet has the sword placed in his hand, he's up in Sabino Canyon. And and how many of you have hiked to Sabino Canyon? Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; You gone up there. I want to see. Wow. I want to see where where this happened. That That's good. That's exciting &gt;&gt; to go up and see where it happened. But what happened? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; It was for a purpose. &gt;&gt; A sword is now unchath and placed into his hand. And he thought it was the end. Listen to me. He thought, "I'm done with no one." Because according to the vision, there was a blast. No one can live through that. &gt;&gt; He says, "I think I my ministry is over. I'm done with. I'm probably not even going to come home, Billy. Take care of the wife and kids." &gt;&gt; But when he gets up there and the sword appears in his hand, it's not this will be the third pull. Not giving a future. This is &gt;&gt; the third pull. &gt;&gt; This is the vindication of your ministry. Wait a second. You mean all the years prior to the sword coming in his hand was not a vindication? &gt;&gt; No, it was just an attraction. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; The first pull didn't expose the system. &gt;&gt; It's outer court. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's a sign in the hand. &gt;&gt; It's the outer cord. It's little birds. &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you symbols. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Showing you the sec second pull did not expose the system. &gt;&gt; Though it went to the inner court. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Though it was talking about the spirit of man. And brother Brennan preaches a sermon, the anointed ones of the end time, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says they are false anointed ones. &gt;&gt; I thought the anointing was false. He said no, they are false seed &gt;&gt; but true anointing. &gt;&gt; So it goes from the outer court to the inner court to the spirit of man to the discerning of spirit. The second sign, second pole. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he said went from little birds to what? Doves. &gt;&gt; Okay. Symbols. He said but the third pole now totally exposes &gt;&gt; the spirit of the system. &gt;&gt; Exposes it. &gt;&gt; It goes now to the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Goes beyond the veil of human flesh. goes beyond the outer court, inner court into the holy of holies and goes down into the soul &gt;&gt; where the word is revealed. It goes from little birds to doves to angels. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So, the third pole was the change of his ministry that he kept telling us about. &gt;&gt; You know, there's coming a change. you know now it won't be something sinful won't be but watch I I I've got to back off I've got to be very sincere &gt;&gt; okay because what's coming is far greater &gt;&gt; the other he says that was just a a minor &gt;&gt; healing that's fine discernments that's fine &gt;&gt; but he said I want something far greater now &gt;&gt; which is Christ the mystery of God revealed in you into the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brennan says in the resume of ages, please follow along with me as I we're going to do a little bit of reading here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that I am not here to just read &gt;&gt; quotes from the prophet, but to substantiate what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; To show you he said it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Resume of the ages. Now, and I want to say this to our brothers who whether it's Stephen McNeely or Brother James Loveall or Brother Warren or anybody or visiting ministers, don't waste time. Page and paragraph and what year? &gt;&gt; Tell them where he said it. Let the quote say it. Bang. Go. It's Well, let me see. Um, page 371, paragraph two. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Of the resume. A stop. &gt;&gt; Give them the quote. Let's read. Let's go on. How many say amen to that? Okay. All right. And I don't mean to How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, watch the doctrine of Balum most carefully. Notice above all that it is the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy &gt;&gt; to bind the people to them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there's a union taking place of binding of clergy &gt;&gt; by leading the people deliberately into the sin of unbelief. &gt;&gt; The nicotan doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power amongst themselves. While balumism is the subjection of the people to their systems of creeds and worship in order to hold them. &gt;&gt; So they're developing a system to hold people. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding the spirit that's holding people corrupt clergy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Deliberately, &gt;&gt; bringing the people, &gt;&gt; oh, don't listen to everybody else. Listen to us. We got it. We're here. We're part of the bride. We're all in. &gt;&gt; Come on. So it binds the people. &gt;&gt; Now watch this carefully. What is it that bound the people to the nominal church and thereby destroyed them? It was the creeds and dogmas formed into church tenants. &gt;&gt; It was the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's showing you the spirit of the system. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Where'd it come from? &gt;&gt; Roman Catholicism. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Balamism, &gt;&gt; nickelotinism. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "In which things I hate." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were not given the true food, the word. They were given the food that came from idol worship. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Babylonian &gt;&gt; paganism wrapped up in Christian terminology. &gt;&gt; Let me share a little bit of that with you for a moment before we continue reading. &gt;&gt; Easter, &gt;&gt; Christmas, &gt;&gt; Valentine's Day. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron. Come on, man. You're tearing down my Christmas tree. Doesn't really matter. I put up the lights and we have a a thing and we sing away in a manger and all that and it's not we don't worship the Christmas tree. Brother Brennham said Christianity versus &gt;&gt; idolatry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wrapped up in Christian terminology. &gt;&gt; Does it matter if you celebrate a pagan holiday &gt;&gt; brother? &gt;&gt; Do we bring it right into our church and say it really doesn't matter? Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take the word of God as my absolute &gt;&gt; That's why I'm I'm showing you these things. &gt;&gt; And they were the very same spirit and doctrine is right amongst all Protestants and it's called denomination. &gt;&gt; Nicicoatanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby deposing the spirit. Balumism is the denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And the and right to this hour, many of God's people are caught in the snare of denominational &gt;&gt; is God is crying to them. So what is God crying to these that are caught up? God's people &gt;&gt; that are caught up in denominationalism just like brother Bobby and them over there in Shri for that pastor their pastor refused brother Brennham and no longer wanted to be associated with the message &gt;&gt; what they did is they started listening to tapes because they couldn't go where the prophet was always that. So they started listening to tapes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Because there weren't quote a whole lot of message churches at that time. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So as they heard the tapes, they began to realize there was more to his ministry &gt;&gt; than just let's say how that we dress. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And how that we go to church. They realize, "Oh my, this is a prophet of God." &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, come out of her, but my people. So now, those that were caught in that denomin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lest you be partakers of her sins, &gt;&gt; and that you receive not her plagues. You see, they are ignorant. But if the rapture should take place at this moment, ignorance would be no court of appeal from the judgment of God for being in the wrong ranks. &gt;&gt; Does it &gt;&gt; matter? &gt;&gt; The revealing of the son of man in this hour is the sharp dissection of the two-edged sword. We know that the sword is a symbol. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For the word of God goes forth as a sharp two-edged sword, even dividing a sunder, not between body and spirit, &gt;&gt; but now between the spirit and the soul. &gt;&gt; And tells you, well, you can have the Holy Ghost 24 hours a day and your soul still black as night and on its way to hell. &gt;&gt; Never before did we ever hear something like that. Do you understand? So now the sword's placed in that prophet's hand. And he's now dividing between your spirit and your soul. &gt;&gt; You may look like a Christian, act like a Christian, you may have dance in the spirit. You may have the gifts of the spirit. You may prophesy. You may do all of this stuff. And he says, "And you know what? Your soul is not got Christ sitting on the control tower." Because when the word of God comes forth, you don't follow it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, the total exposure of this mystery Babylon, the mother the mother of harlots, it's a system. &gt;&gt; What part of that system do we want? What part of it is okay? &gt;&gt; What part of it do you embrace and say it really doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to show you some things here. And remember now, Sabino Canyon, the sword was placed in the prophet's hand. &gt;&gt; This is the third pole. This is the vindication of his ministry. So, all of that prior was just an attraction. Now is a vindication. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. And with the opening of the seals, it declares war. &gt;&gt; Never before until now with the opening of the seals is it the exposure of the system or the spirit in denomination. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, Revelation 17 verses 1-6. This is your Bible. There came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me, saying unto me, come hither. I will show unto thee the judgment of the great that siteth upon many waters. These are symbols, &gt;&gt; many waters as people. &gt;&gt; So it's a system sitting upon many people having an influence upon them. And how does his influence come? With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication? &gt;&gt; The kings of the earth have committed. I want to ask you, how do you commit fornication against God? Direct quote. When you knowing better by the intercourse of the mind, which is the wound to your spirit, &gt;&gt; you add to take away from the word of God or say it really doesn't matter. You have absolutely committed spiritual adultery on Christ the word. &gt;&gt; You want to know we're unclean, seducing, lascivious? &gt;&gt; You want to know why the young people within this message are having such a problem with fornication? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is fornication? Unclean living. &gt;&gt; That's right. What's the difference between fornication and adultery? One's the act before marriage. The other is the act after marriage. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's all unclean. Religion is a sexual spirit. &gt;&gt; It's Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Now watch how she watch how she causes the people to come under her influence. This is the scripture. In whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. &gt;&gt; So whatever stimulation she has in her cup, &gt;&gt; said, "Oh, if I had a cup here and I said,"Hey, drink, drink. go ahead and drink. And denominations are giving you the wine of a stimulation. Well, &gt;&gt; we're all going. &gt;&gt; Yes. It doesn't matter how we live. It's Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And they're stimulated by it. &gt;&gt; Right. There they are. &gt;&gt; And they still live in a fornicating, adulterous life contrary to the word of God. And yet they're drunk. Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And drunk people are happy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Drunk people. &gt;&gt; See, so now what she's doing. This system giving a cup. What is it? Fornication. &gt;&gt; It's unclean living. Doesn't matter the way you live. Listen, God loves us all. When we all get to heaven. What a day. What a lie. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz not everyone's going. &gt;&gt; Many are called, but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election. Sure. &gt;&gt; For broad is the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And many will go in at that gate. &gt;&gt; Think of the Broadway. &gt;&gt; Bright lights and Broadway. &gt;&gt; Hollywood. Hollywood evangelism. &gt;&gt; All of this kind of stuff. giving to the church &gt;&gt; a cup of fornication and they drink it and they become stimulated and they become deceived. &gt;&gt; So he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast. It's a system. It's a power full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and 10 horns. Again, these are symbols. &gt;&gt; And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornications. It's okay for a woman to cut her hair. &gt;&gt; It's a fornicating spirit. &gt;&gt; It's okay for her to dress any way she wants to. &gt;&gt; If she wears clothes that pertains to a man, it's an abom it's an abomination. But do they believe that? Why? They're stimulated. Doesn't matter the way we dress. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I cut my hair or trim my hair. Doesn't matter if I shave it off. Do you see? Because the woman, why the woman? Because a woman is a type of the church. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a greater mystery besides the husband and wife." &gt;&gt; I show you Christ and his church. &gt;&gt; Are we Are we together now? &gt;&gt; He's saying she's got in her hand a cup full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. And upon her forehead was a name written, mystery Babylon. &gt;&gt; The great, the mother of harlots, and the abominations of the earth. &gt;&gt; Wow. This is this pretty serious, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Now, those words are highlighted in your Bible. I didn't highlight those. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Those are capitalized. &gt;&gt; And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of all unbelievers. and and pagans and sinners and idoltors and all. &gt;&gt; What is she drunk with? &gt;&gt; The blood. &gt;&gt; You think it's a system that is not going to turn and kill you? &gt;&gt; Look at this. &gt;&gt; I'm going slow because I want this to sink in. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw her drunken with the blood of the saints. Look in the dark ages. 68 million. &gt;&gt; Marty by who? Catholic church. What was it? Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you seen what's happening around the world? Recently happened in the DRC. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Democratic Republic of Congo. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the believers just not I don't know they but they were Christians in a church. &gt;&gt; And ISIS went in there and killed over 40 of them as they were there in a prayer. &gt;&gt; It's coming. &gt;&gt; Sure did. &gt;&gt; The spirits that were on Hitler, Moose, uh Mussolini and Ikeman are pre-tribulation spirits, &gt;&gt; right? What is holding back these people that are losing their minds? &gt;&gt; A mother and father take their two daughters on a hike in a place called a devil's den. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; They're just hiking out in the and the next thing you know, I don't know what happened, but the guy kills the father first. The mother runs with her two daughters to take him to a place of safety. And she goes back to try to save her husband. And that man killed him. Killed her, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why are these people coming with guns? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And knives. &gt;&gt; And innocent people just whether they're going to church or walking down the street. &gt;&gt; Come on. Think about it. &gt;&gt; This world is going insane. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you see spirits influencing people? Why are people got road rage and got all this kind of stuff? It used to be, you know, if you got upset with somebody, you get out of the car and you whipped him and the fight was over and that's it. Not no more, man. You you you get upset with somebody. Hey buddy, pull over. Okay. &gt;&gt; Make my day, buddy. &gt;&gt; Huh? Yeah. They'll blow you away. &gt;&gt; You don't even look at people anymore. &gt;&gt; Leave them alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey man, don't you realize I'm packing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I'm packing too. It's just &gt;&gt; 238s. &gt;&gt; Acts 238 &gt;&gt; and a sword. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? We fight not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers &gt;&gt; of the darkness. &gt;&gt; Okay. If you think that denominational Christianity is harmless. You're already deceived. &gt;&gt; You've been drinking of the wrong &gt;&gt; cup. The wrong wine. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you think it really doesn't matter how you're baptized, Brother Brennham said the devil travels in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Trinitarian. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think it really doesn't matter whether a woman can cut her hair and wear pants, you're already drinking to the wrong cup. It really doesn't matter, Brother Ron. Come on. Well, you don't realize that you've been influenced &gt;&gt; and somebody told you it really doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Well, this prophet told us it does matter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're together now. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Brother Brandham in 1962 preaches a historical um they're all historical, but he begins to declare why I am against organized religion. &gt;&gt; Because everybody wants to know, hey, wait a second. You've been going to all these organizations. &gt;&gt; You've been going to the Baptists. You've been going to Pentecostals. You've been going Lutheran. And everywhere you were invited, you went, you did the sign. You had prayer lines. You had people come to Christ. Raise your hand. Okay. And so now he's declaring because he he's there's changing in his ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; So why am I against organized religion? He's gone to all of them. &gt;&gt; They've opened the door, but now they're closing doors. Watch this. Look immediately after her mystery was made known, who she was, and what she was, who her daughters was, the mystery has been made known. &gt;&gt; Then God sent an angel, a messenger to what? &gt;&gt; Call out, &gt;&gt; come out. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is not just on how to &gt;&gt; dress. &gt;&gt; Come out. &gt;&gt; Come out from the influence of a system that is causing you to drink of the cup of the wine of her abominations and fornications. &gt;&gt; That's why denomination will never preach against those things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her plagues. He's going to curse her. Watch. Come out of her. God sent a mighty angel or a messenger. And his light wasn't in a corner. It scattered over the earth. Come out of her. What? Her and her sisters too to lighten the earth and call his people out of her. Now you know that's the truth. A messenger was sent from heaven to go call God's people out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his light lighten the earth. &gt;&gt; It shall be light about the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The path to glory you shall surely find. &gt;&gt; You understand what is this light? &gt;&gt; And I will send a light unto the Gentiles and thy light has come upon you. Oh my good. How many of you say, "I've seen the light." &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We'll walk in the light. That beautiful light. &gt;&gt; Walk where the dew drops of mercy are bright. Shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus, the light of the bride. &gt;&gt; That That was my little adding there in the last little bit. &gt;&gt; Right before the opening of the seals, he is now setting forth a precedent. Here's why I'm against organized religion. So now he preaches two weeks later 62. Is this the sign of the end, sir? What is the sign? What do you mean the end? Is this a sign that this is the end? What is it? What scripture does he take as his text? Revelations 10 1-7 &gt;&gt; serves. Is this the sign? What is all these angels and visions and dreams &gt;&gt; and prophecies going forth? What is it? Is this the sign that the end has the countdown started? &gt;&gt; Amen. Who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Watch this, sir. Is this the sign of the end? &gt;&gt; Now, when sounding forth, now that's thus sayaith the Lord. We have that clear. When he sounds forth his message, declares war. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like Paul did on the Orthodox like the rest of them did Luther Wesley against organization. All of them came out against organized religion. &gt;&gt; And when he declares war and tells them they are lying and it's not the truth and they're deceiving men, when it sounds forth that, you can't fail. It won't fail because he'll be vindicated by the word of God. You know exactly what it is. And when he does, he sounds for to call from Babylon. Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins. God send him. Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the first seal 63. I'll just read the highlighted part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That organizational system is of the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's no punches pulled out pulled on it either. It's exactly &gt;&gt; it's the root of the devil. &gt;&gt; And now not many people not people in there them are God's people many of them. And when that last angel file flies at the same time that message drops here for the last trumpet, that angel message, the last seal opens, all happens at the same time. Yes, sir. All seals up and goes over into eternity. Brother Brennham said that seventh seal, it's a final seal. It's the end of all things &gt;&gt; and the coming of the Lord. The seventh seal is the coming of the Lord. Revelations 10 1-7 is the coming of the Lord. But I want to ask you when do you say that he came? When the coming of the Lord in his first coming when Isaiah prophesied hundreds of years before it happened, behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that was a part of his coming? Yet it was hundreds of years later that it manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Mary conceived, was that his coming? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or was it when she gave birth &gt;&gt; and the shepherds adored him &gt;&gt; and there was announcements &gt;&gt; and he was a Christ child. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Was that his coming? &gt;&gt; These are events &gt;&gt; that all have to do with his coming. &gt;&gt; It's a process. &gt;&gt; So is this message. It's a process. &gt;&gt; The rapture is a process. &gt;&gt; He said the rapture is a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's a process. It's not just the catching away of the bride. &gt;&gt; That's the final event. &gt;&gt; Behold, we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which sleep. Right? &gt;&gt; That's that's the final catching away. But I'll tell you, he's already sent an Elijah ministry. Behold, I'll send to you Elijah before. &gt;&gt; Somebody say before. &gt;&gt; Before. &gt;&gt; Before the great and terrible day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's going to turn to hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we when we begin to understand what was this message all about? &gt;&gt; Okay. The seriousness of this. That's why I want all of you to understand that mystery Babylon the great &gt;&gt; is there to try to deceive all those &gt;&gt; who it possibly can by a system &gt;&gt; and saying it's okay here it doesn't really matter and so they drink of that &gt;&gt; and they're drunk &gt;&gt; with an inspiration that's incorrect &gt;&gt; false wine will make you as drunk as good wine. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; for sure. &gt;&gt; False stimulation can get you as it stimulated as true revelation. &gt;&gt; I've told you the story before. I was out hunting. We were hunting elk. We got out there and I'd heard the elk bugle. They Oh, they sound so close. Oh, man. He's close. He's close. Lock my gun in. Ready? Oh, I see the horns. There he I got you, buddy. I got you. I'm getting so hyperventilated and it's winter time and everything. And my glasses are steaming up. My scope is steaming up and Okay, come on, buddy. I got you. Yeah. Just Just one more step. It's a branch. There's a branch moving in the wind. &gt;&gt; And yet for 5 10 minutes I was so anointed. &gt;&gt; I was so inspired. &gt;&gt; I thought it was a branch. &gt;&gt; Yet for a a little bit I was there. I was ready, man. That 7 millimeter. I was ready to squeeze that trigger. &gt;&gt; Now Now I want you to understand please the Bible says be not deceived. God is not mocked. &gt;&gt; For whatsoever you yield your spirit to you become the servant thereof. &gt;&gt; Is it Huh? Either to righteousness &gt;&gt; or to unrighteousness. Because whatever you yield, you say it doesn't matter. I I'll yield. I'll give right of way. I I'll say it really doesn't matter. whatsoever you yield. If you yield yourself to Jezebel religion, &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; and say doesn't really matter. &gt;&gt; What you've done is you're deceiving yourself because God is not mine. That's why when you preach the revelation of this message in its fullness, it causes some people to get upset because you're you're making people in denomination as though they're nonseed. Brother Bram said, "No, if they're true seed, they'll hear the word for this hour and come up and &gt;&gt; and come out." &gt;&gt; Now, some are going to stay in there and they're foolish virgin. That's right. &gt;&gt; They just fail to hear what the spirit is saying to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Just before the Israelites crossed over Jordan to possess the land, Joshua, a type of the Holy Spirit leadership, told the people of Israel to sanctify themselves and their homes before you cross over. &gt;&gt; Three days. Don't even go in under your wives. It's your Bible. &gt;&gt; This means they said, "Sanctify yourselves. Clean yourselves up. &gt;&gt; Look at your home." &gt;&gt; They're getting ready to cross over. And I'm saying we're getting ready to cross over right now. &gt;&gt; Sanctify yourself. &gt;&gt; How is your home doing? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Have you sanctified it? Have you applied the token? What does it mean to apply the token? Well, I say I apply the token and then you live with the things that's contrary to the word of God in your home and say you've applied the token. &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. &gt;&gt; God is not mocked. &gt;&gt; God is purging the church right now like he did Israel. Two million, brother Ram said, was a mixed multitude. Okay. Every trial cause the group to be thinned down. &gt;&gt; This is not the time to profess the token. It's the time to possess the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the token be applied to our lives and to our homes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let there be a holy fire of God that comes down and consumes each one of us and bringing the conviction of sin and cleansing us from the top to the bottom, from the pulpit to the pew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to apply the token? Oh my 63 he preaches the token. He says, "Apply the token to your house." That then what do you do when you apply it to your house? &gt;&gt; Move all the trash out. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get all the short skirts. &gt;&gt; Get all the short skirts &gt;&gt; and the shorts &gt;&gt; and the cards. and the cigarettes and the vapes. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach it. &gt;&gt; Well, he never said nothing about a vaping. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cigarettes and televisions &gt;&gt; and whatever more. Kick them out the door and when you go apply the token, it won't stand still for it. Take it all out. all the dances, the parties, and the rock and roll, old vulgar newspapers, and stuff like that out of the of the world. Kick it out the door. We're cleaning out this place around here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember when I would go to other countries, pastors would take my children off to themselves and ask them, "What does your daddy believe about this?" or "What did the prophet say about that?" And so I remember they they took Amos one time and had him and they said, "What did the prophet say about television?" He says, "Well, brother Brandham said, kick that thing outside and watch it outside." [Laughter] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not kicking it outside, watching it outside, &gt;&gt; right? I remember we lost Amos one time at the Flagstaff Mall when they just had opened it up right next to Rosson Pyina there and the Flagstaff Mall. Mine was great. We walked through Sears, I think it was. They had a whole wall of televisions like all these things here on the wall and and guess what? We was holding all our kids and I think I'm holding Rebecca's and and Sandy is holding Matthews and Amos, he's the oldest, so he's kind of wandering by himself. Well, all of a sudden we lose him. We get we get out of Sears and we get into the main mall. Where's Amos? Ah, somebody child abduction. Sound the alarm. Where is he? Ah, you know that's a horrible feeling. &gt;&gt; Have a child loss. Oh, man. Where'd he Where'd he go? We run back and there he is in front of all the the whole wall of television. Amos. Amos, what are you doing? I'm watching the radio. cuz we used to listen to the craft mystery theater. Do you ever you guys remember any of the craft mystery craft mystery theater and the the man come walking through the house and all the sound and my kids would all sit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; My kids love me to tell them stories. Dad, tell us another bedtime story. Tell us, you know. Yeah. So I I Well, okay, let me tell you about the three little bears. The first little bear, his name was Amos, and the next one was Rebecca and Matthew. And Matthew's sitting there sucking his fingers and he's going and I says, "And they went into the woods and they went out and they was lost and they got to this." And I'm making this big old elaborate story and they're just sitting there and their eyes and I says, "And it started to get dark and and they saw a big old cave. So they went into this cave and they went in there. It was dark and it was spooky and and they heard something in the background and all and then I said and then it went you know like this and all three of them they love for to be entertained to tell them tell us another story then well saints of God listen I don't want to be a teller of stories. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be a preacher of the gospel. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to entertain you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not. &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach to you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And preach to you &gt;&gt; that there is an opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; And it caused the sword of the spirit to come down &gt;&gt; and divide aunder between the spirit and the soul. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And now it cut away everything that was not God circumcised this message &gt;&gt; from the flesh of denominational teaching with the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; And with the first seal, brother Brim said, "Well, you all know I preached the seals before. It took me about 20 minutes." And he says, "And I listened to Clarence Larkin, Hisop's two Babylons, &gt;&gt; pre- Nioan fathers. He read all of this stuff and he said, "Yeah, and a white horse writer." Why? That's Christ riding down through the ages. &gt;&gt; That was knowledge. &gt;&gt; But he said that morning, he said, "That first angel came to me. &gt;&gt; Walked into the room. &gt;&gt; I come to hear to give to you the opening of the first seat." &gt;&gt; Wow. That white horse rider. It's not Christ. It's the Antichrist. Oh my. I was 100 miles from the truth. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you see he now cut away &gt;&gt; that flesh of man's understanding? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of denominational teaching of men that probed at it. He says what the others have probed at down through the ages. He said now God is giving his prophet thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you apply the token, there must be a response on behalf of the believer. &gt;&gt; Don't just say, "Yes, I believe it. That's nothing but the truth." And then don't do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; It's not acknowledging that it's truth. &gt;&gt; It's not just agreeing with it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's not just pressing play. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But you have to obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to apply it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how it is to apply the token to your home. You've got to obey it. It must cause you to get into action. It caused Noah to build an ark. Got him into action. &gt;&gt; It caused Abraham to seek a city whose builder and maker is God. It caused Moses to apply the blood on the doorpost of the home. &gt;&gt; Are you you understand? They got into action. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation of this message is to put you in action. If there is no action, there's no manifestation. If there's no manifestation, it's just knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And knowing what's right to do does not give you the power to do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I know. I know. I I know. I know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But why not do it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's apply the token. &gt;&gt; Let's apply the word of God in our lives and let her see a manifestation. And we have to tell that to our children. And our children come under the leadership of the revelation of the head of the house because he basically is the absolute to that family. &gt;&gt; Right. Fathers, I want you to understand, no matter what we preach here at home, it's what you apply at your house. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of whether or not your kids are going to follow. &gt;&gt; Because you can say you believe it and they see you live a life that is contrary to it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What's this message behind that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I need to do what I want. Soon as I get out of the house and have my own thing, have my own apartment. I can do what I want. Nobody gonna force me to do I could. If I want to wear pants, I'll wear pants. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, parents understand, do not preach legalism to your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not it. They don't understand about those kind of things. I remember how it was so nice that Sandy, we went over to my sister's house over in California, Huntington Beach. She married a multi-millionaire. Her kids were spoiled little girls, my nieces, they were given anything. They went out to dinner and when they ordered from the meal, they didn't order from the kids menu. They order, well, I'll take a T-bone steak, medium well, and baked potato and everything like that. And then they cut and eat a little piece of it and waste it. &gt;&gt; And our kids, no, you ain't getting that. You're going to get over here child's menu. You get the macaroni and cheese or you get the hamburger or whatever. You know, &gt;&gt; why don't we Well, you can spoil your kids. So, my sister, she didn't hold nothing back for her girls. the latest fashion, all the bell bottoms, the the jeans, the the the clothing, and all the kinds of stuff that you would get in modern day fashion. And when my family would go to visit my sister, my sister would say, "Hey, my girls have outgrown all of their their clothing. Rebecca, come on in here. We want" And so they and oh, look at this. They start giving her all kinds of stuff. Well, man, she gets all her eyes get real big. She tries on some pants. Wow. Looks in the mirror. Okay. Well, anyway, this is just personal testimony. So, then you have to say and you you want to you don't want to tell your sister that's an abomination in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; You know, and they don't understand that. The Bible says carnally-minded people are enmity with God. Neither can they understand the things of God. &gt;&gt; So, we graciously accepted it and we thought, "Well, we'll throw out the stuff that we can't use when we get home." &gt;&gt; But anyway, my wife took little Rebecca and sat her down, said, "Sweetheart, those things are not what little girls should be wearing in this day. You should you look so much nicer in a dress." and applied that to their heart &gt;&gt; because they don't understand. If we make this message rules and regulations are kids, &gt;&gt; okay, if you tell your kids you cannot play sports, &gt;&gt; no way. You realize that's of the devil. You can't even read comic books. &gt;&gt; And on pretty soon, you know, your kids are so restricted &gt;&gt; Yeah. that they look at this message as a bunch of regulations. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not. &gt;&gt; Well, do you let me just share with you in the Bible there's so much more thou shalt &gt;&gt; instead of thou shalt not. This message is so vast &gt;&gt; and the more that I get into it and the more that I study it as a minister of God, &gt;&gt; then it makes me aware of a system that is out there that is trying to permeate itself right into this message &gt;&gt; starts with fashion, &gt;&gt; television, movies, &gt;&gt; internet, cell phone. Come on. &gt;&gt; And if it comes into the house, how how does it come through? The head of the house allows it. &gt;&gt; Achan, that's what he did. &gt;&gt; Little Babylonian garments. It doesn't really matter. It's my home. &gt;&gt; Won't affect the church. Wedges of silver and of gold. &gt;&gt; Head of the house will carry the responsibility. Brothers, understand you're the head of your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you fail to apply the token, then your children will not make it because you're not applying the token to your family. And if you kids sit there and think, well, daddy said the token is applied and you don't see any manifestation, he's deceiving you. Because otherwise it well you know I've heard young people say well parents said I'm applying the token to you and though you're not living the life uh you're going to go anyway. That's not true. &gt;&gt; If you're not living the life you're not going. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How dare you dilute the token of the hour? How dare you say it doesn't really matter? &gt;&gt; Must I go to heaven &gt;&gt; on a flowery bed of ease? &gt;&gt; When others sought to gain the prize, they sailed through bloody seas. I must fight if I must reign. Increase &gt;&gt; my courage, Lord. I'm putting responsibility back on you men. &gt;&gt; Don't place it on. If you miss it, it's not because we're not trying to preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Responsibility is what you do at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where did the children learn to get a an attitude against the ministry of Elijah &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, bald head. Oh, bald head." &gt;&gt; Huh? Come on. &gt;&gt; He said they were sitting around the dinner table and heard mom and dad talk against the ministry. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Parents, &gt;&gt; if you're critical, at least don't say it in front of your kids. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? When they're going to go to church and they hear, "Well, you know, I heard daddy say what ministry really doesn't matter and on." Then they then when the ministry is there trying to save them, &gt;&gt; they say, "I ain't listening to you. I heard my daddy say I heard mama say." Doesn't really matter. Don't listen to him, old baldheaded. &gt;&gt; Depends on attitudes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. It really does. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Brother Johnny Green came into my office just before service. Brother Ron, I want to tell you something. He says, "I've been invited by two of my sons to come down and the doors been opened for me to just come down and have fellowship with him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Brother Johnny, what a great opportunity. I said, "Use discernment and wisdom." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said, "Love your children. Tell them, daddy's always loved you, &gt;&gt; even if you didn't serve God in the way that I see." And I said, "And I pray that God will use you &gt;&gt; to win your own children." What good is it? We go out here and we go to all these countries and we try to win all these converts to Christ and we lose our kids. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I want to take every one of my kids. &gt;&gt; I don't want them to have some kind of religion. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the Amish of the end end time that we wear our hats and our beards and our our special clothes and try to stay away from the world and we go back to horse and buggy. Ah, &gt;&gt; no no no. You miss it. Let us bring our children to an into a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said the first audio visual he says that the devil brought into the world was he called it a biocope. That was a movie house, a bioscope. He said, "We used to go down and we take a couple cents and go get a bag of popcorn and sit there and and everything." He was just raised up as a normal kid. &gt;&gt; Huh? And so he went down to the biocope. Now, anything that'll make you compromise on the word of God is an enticing spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. Anything that'll cause you to compromise on any portion of the word of God is a compromising spirit. A Jezebel spirit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A religious spirit, a seducing spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Well, it really doesn't matter. Now, watch what Brother Rem said. God keeps his word. &gt;&gt; Put television out the way it is now and uncensored programs of all this vulgarity and everything. Let a little boy go. The gate to the eye is the soul. The eye is the gate to the soul rather. Let him go and let these little girls go into one of these movies or something or other and see one of these here women out of Hollywood with eight or 10 husbands making love to some man. That little girl will practice the same thing the next day. &gt;&gt; Does it matter? You see, if we let the uncensored and next thing you know, pretty soon it used to be, you remember the things were censored. Well, that blink blank &gt;&gt; if they blanked every censored word now half the dialogue and he went blink over there and blink it'd just be blank blank blank. Everything be redacted. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. If they take away sex and violence from every major movie, &gt;&gt; are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; It wouldn't get any awards. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the world is feeding upon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what the first thing that was fed upon the children of God in the Garden of Eden, sex &gt;&gt; and violence. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who am I? My brother's keeper. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me what to do. &gt;&gt; I can bring any sacrifice I want to. Why is thy countenance fallen, Cain? Why are you upset? Did I not give you a word? Didn't I get give you? If you'll give the same sacrifice your brother did, but he couldn't do it. Why in none seed, there's nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; And he gets upset and wroth with God. said, 'Well, I'm going to offer whatever I want to. He says, 'What you feed on? Let me go in your office, sir. &gt;&gt; And tell me you're a Christian. Let me hear you. Turn on your radio when I'm there. And you're listening to some kind of old boogie woogie music. Let me see half-dressing uh women pinups on the side of your wall. I don't care what you say. I know what your spirit's feeding on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's a tool in the hand of Satan to brainwash the minds of the American people. The radio started first. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says, "What was one of the first uh wrong type of songs?" &gt;&gt; Roll them, Giries, roll them. Remember I I went and found that for you and I played the tapes. It's a snappy little tune. Roll them giries. Roll them. Show them your pretty knees. Haha. And grandma and paw. And he says, "See, it was already affecting the minds of the people. It started with a radio and the prophet of God saw it in its embionic form. &gt;&gt; What would it think now of the vulgarity of the rappers &gt;&gt; speaking such vulgar things about women? &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?" &gt;&gt; Then came the television. It had an impact by the programs that people watched. Then come the computer, a revised version, &gt;&gt; a more intellectual version. Then along comes the cell phone &gt;&gt; where all of the above are in one thing. Music, movies, &gt;&gt; right? There &gt;&gt; parents. If Steve Jobs And these other guys, I forget the other one, refuse to let their children until they're 18 have a cell phone. What about you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're the inventors. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I said, "We're not going to let our kids have until they're about 18." Because you know what? It's a babysitter. Musicians, if you come, I listen. I'm I'm not going to be able to finish this. I thought tonight or today I could finish this. I can't because I want to go slowly. I want to &gt;&gt; I want to cover these things. &gt;&gt; One of the worst babysitters that you could give your children today is a cell phone. &gt;&gt; Give me this here. Have the phone. Have the phone, man. Okay. And they sit there &gt;&gt; bugeyed. &gt;&gt; Huh? Then you have family reunion. &gt;&gt; The kids sit on the couch. &gt;&gt; No talking with grandma and grandpa. &gt;&gt; No interaction. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; If I had a loaded pistol up here, I said, "Hey, you know what, Justin? Go and bring your little girls up here. I got a gun. Let them play with it. I don't play cowboys and Indians. I hope that what you would do is say, "Brother Ron, as much as I love you, &gt;&gt; don't hand my kids a loaded weapon. &gt;&gt; In fact, I don't even want to get close to it." Do you see that? Go ahead and just play something softly here. You hand your children. You may think I'm oldfashioned. You may think, &gt;&gt; saints of God, &gt;&gt; watch your children. &gt;&gt; Watch your children. &gt;&gt; Watch over them. You hand them that and say, "It's okay." All right. I done warned you. Because in their room at night by themselves &gt;&gt; with a little haze blue light. [Music] &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And they have access to anything. There's no filter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without the Holy Spirit in your life, &gt;&gt; there is nothing to filter out &gt;&gt; the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no filter. &gt;&gt; You think you parents, you can put a child filter on their phone or whatever. Hey, let me tell you, those kids know how to use your phone much smarter than you do. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I have my phone is acting up. It's not working right. I hand it to one of my kids. Okay, here here grandpa. It's done. How'd you do that? It just It's simple to me. &gt;&gt; Why are they called smartphones? Because they're smarter than you are. &gt;&gt; About the time I buy an iPhone smart 12 or whatever they call it is and everything. Now they come out with 16 or 18 and it's got a flamethrower of mega power and everything and you can you know you want this and get the new one. Man, I haven't figured out the one I got. They get a one that's even that much smarter. Yeah. The prophet took the sword of the spirit, began to dissect and discern what's troubling you in your spirit realm. &gt;&gt; Come closer, sir. That won't hurt you. That's him. &gt;&gt; Oh, I see you now. I I see you. There's something troubling you. It's your wife. Oh, yeah. And you you took her and you and you know the discernments. Or I saw you young girl. You you've got a phobia about a certain thing. Oh, you're afraid of dogs because when you were a little girl, you were chased by a dog and so you have this phobia. Are those things right? Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, he was discerning. Now you go into the thumb and they wonder why that something was bothering them to such a degree. It took the Holy Spirit to discern are those things true? Yes. Yes, that's true. Come here. Let me pray for you. The reason young people within this message, I had a brother send me a link to a minister who's preaching about sexuality. It's got over 10,000 hits talking about sex within the message. And our kids have got to hear about this. Well, I agree. We need to tell you because you know what? You're going to face it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to face it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You want to know why young people got problems with seducing spirits and fornicating spirits and adulterous spirits? Cuz you open the doorway. &gt;&gt; You got a stronghold. &gt;&gt; You listen to the wrong kind of music. You watch the kind of wrong kind of music and oh, oh, I wonder why I can't get free of this lust spirit. &gt;&gt; Cuz you don't open the door. Now, no matter how much you anoint them with oil and lay hands on them, that devil has a right to stay there. Why? Because they open the door. And until they close the door and admit and confess and become convicted of the life they're living, &gt;&gt; ymen. It's not a cure all to have everybody come through a prayer line, but get all the ministers to lay hands on you and [Music] and they think that they got free of it and they go couple weeks and oh yes, yes, you're free. Come on, praise the Lord. Couple weeks later, the scripture said, "And a strong man being cast out of the house goeth and find others even worse. And the house having not been filled, he goes and gets these other spirits and come back. And the condition of the house is worse. &gt;&gt; That's why these many of the young people are really getting to disillusioned. &gt;&gt; They've gone from this camp to that camp and this t preacher to this preacher and some preaches. It's so dynamic and they're the their deliverance ministries and come up here and and we're going to lay hands and that devil's going to cast off and all this stuff and they've gone to all of these meetings and when it's all said and done, where do they what kind of life do they live? &gt;&gt; Then they get disillusioned. Well, I guess there's nothing to it. &gt;&gt; And somebody talked to me the other day about adult Uh, video games. Adult video games. Now, I guess they're video games. I've never I played one video game way back. It was Pac-Man. It goes and you remember that, huh? gun and it goes and swallows up and pretty, you know, and it had a music and then then the excuse me, I guess I've done two ninja and all this stuff. The music and every level the music gets higher and more intense like this man going that got me. I go back to square one. But these video games that adults play, you think it's innocent. Computer games, stay away from them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adults playing it. &gt;&gt; And then you wonder why the kids would have a problem with it. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm just trying to tell you truth, saints. &gt;&gt; That's all. You apply the word as you hear it in your life and say, "I'm going to do better." &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Wow. I got &gt;&gt; That's okay. I I I'm done for today. I think I've made a couple points. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that this system that is out there fashions, music, television, computer, movies, let's call it mass media. &gt;&gt; Is all out there to try to tell you, "Go ahead and drink." &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; It's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all right, man. Come on. It's innocent. Just a little sip. And when you take a little sip, he just holds the bottom of the Come on. A little more. Ah, that's Yeah, come on. Until you've megga dosed [Music] and then you wonder, how did I get this way? &gt;&gt; How did I get where? How did I become the way I've become? [Music] remember that little girl that was at the altar and brother Brennham told him he said sis you need to stay here you haven't you haven't repented all the way and everything anyway she resented brother Brennham got a little bit upset with him and she left I think it was just a short while later maybe a year or two and he saw her on the street &gt;&gt; drunk your clothes half offer. Hey preacher, you want a drink? Oh, [Music] he says, "Remember that night that you told me?" Yeah, I do, sis. Well, I didn't listen to you. Then I took a spirit and now I can't quit. [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you do you all remember I was with brother Joseph Brandom. I'm saying this in closing. Joseph went and bought some flowers. We were in his car together. He said, "Excuse me, I want to take this by this hospice." I think it was it was a place for older people. He said, "I want to take in." He said, "Do you remember daddy talking about his first girlfriend that made fun of him that he wouldn't smoke a cigarette?" [Music] Had a neck like a swan. And you know how he says, "Oh, my just" And he says, she says, "Uh, Bill, you want a you want a cigarette?" "No, no, ma'am. No thanks. I don't smoke." "You don't smoke? Are you big I want to be big bad bill. Give me that cigarette. [Music] Goes off crying. Joseph said, "Brother Ron, just stay right here. I'm going to take these flowers to brother Brandham's first girlfriend. Take him in there." He said, goes in there and she says, "Joe, ever since I made fun of your daddy that he wouldn't smoke a cigarette." &gt;&gt; Said, "Now I became a chain smoker and my life fell apart." She said, "If I could ever relive a day over again, I would have never made fun of you." &gt;&gt; Be careful what you make fun of. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't understand this message, don't ever make fun of it. &gt;&gt; You just hold it before God and say, "God, in your season, if you want me to know, please let me know." Depends on your attitude. If you ask, &gt;&gt; he'll give. &gt;&gt; If you seek, you shall find. &gt;&gt; If you knock, &gt;&gt; the door shall be open. God bless you. We're talking about come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be ye separate, &gt;&gt; lest you be partakers of her plagues. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's the name of this song? &gt;&gt; Hope is in the Lord. Stand this morning. All within the presence of the Lord. In the wisdom of the aes [Music] from the raes of the seire.

When your pastor rejected the word and no longer embraced the ministry, it caused you to take a step higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And you come out.
