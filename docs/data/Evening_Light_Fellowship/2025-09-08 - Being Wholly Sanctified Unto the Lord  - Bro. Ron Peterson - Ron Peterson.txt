Until that time, Father, we will gather together as often as we can here on this earth that we might give you praise and honor and glory and &gt;&gt; we might seek your face and ask you to come down among us, meet every need, answer every prayer, set every captive free. He sent his word and it healed the people. May there be healing virtues go forth. be some father whether they have a sickness or something within their body.

Then we'll go to Acts chapter 26. Amen. Certainly enjoyed those song specials. &gt;&gt; It was so wonderful. I love it. We want to welcome Brother Randy Hail, Sister Mary Joseph to Carrie. Where are they? To to my right. Okay. God bless you. It's good to have you here. God bless you. Amen. Faithful streamers, they don't get a chance to come down here often. And so when they're here, we are thankful to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they can make it. Brother Mario, Sister Josephine, God bless you. It's good to have you back back home. And uh wasn't it certainly a lovely time Wednesday night? Stephen &gt;&gt; knocked it out of the ballpark. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but that &gt;&gt; that just rung home with me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; we went home and Sandy and I just kept saying, "I'm thankful for this. I'm thankful for that. Got the right attitude and everything." We laid down in bed, held hands. I had my head on the pillow. I said, "Father, I don't want to ask you for any requests. I just want to thank you for all you've done." I just and I'm praying out loud. I said, "Lord, I thank you for a comfortable bed." My wife says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Oh, how how &gt;&gt; we should be praising God with the right attitude, &gt;&gt; being thankful in all our hearts for all that he's done. Huh? &gt;&gt; He's a good guy. Amen. A few Sundays ago, we were preaching on warfare at the end time and I had the Holy Spirit quicken something to me which I will branch off from that because we are not ignorant of the devil's devices nor of his tactics and what he does. it realm. It verges on the realm of demonology uh on uh spirits and different things and how they affect our lives. And um so I want to maybe just lay a little bit of a foundation this morning for what I will go off into in the next couple services. And um so I want to be able to take my time. I don't want to hurry. Uh I think when you get a hurry, sometimes what happens is you kind of miss things. I want to be very attentive to the Holy Spirit. I want you to be sensitive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the Holy Spirit. God's going to speak to you. He's going to give you something. He's going to help you. Amen. Wherever two or more are gathered together, there will I be in their midst. That's a promise of God. So he's here, Lord. You've just got to recognize it. You've got to thank him that he's &gt;&gt; he's preparing you right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For things of not only what you've been through, but what you're going to go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him this morning with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. If you have the book of Leviticus, open chapter 20. Leviticus 20 verses 7-8. Sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God, and ye shall keep my statutes and do them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord which sanctify you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice sanctify yourselves and I am the Lord which sanctify you. &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to the book of 1 Thessalonians. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. Amen. verses 18- 24 in everything give thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. &gt;&gt; Quench not the spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things, &gt;&gt; hold fast that which is good. &gt;&gt; Abstain from all appearance of evil. &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Who also will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Notice verse 23 again if you would. And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In every part, &gt;&gt; your spirit, your soul and body. Here is the triune being of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is saying, I want you to be wholly sanctified &gt;&gt; in all three areas. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to understand &gt;&gt; those three realms. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The natural realm, the spiritual realm, and the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Acts chapter 26. verses 13- 19 and here it is Paul goes before a grippa and he is to give an account of why he is doing what he is doing and how that there's been such a great change. &gt;&gt; Now notice this change. He had been a Pharisee of Pharisees. &gt;&gt; He had been a religious zealot &gt;&gt; concerning the law blameless. &gt;&gt; And yet it took just a moment in the presence. &gt;&gt; It's all it takes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. It just takes a moment in the presence of almighty God &gt;&gt; and lives are changed. &gt;&gt; And so now he's giving an account to King Agria. &gt;&gt; He's brought before counsel. &gt;&gt; And so let's catch this. Verse 13. At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven about the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyied with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the bricks. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutes. But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister, and a witness, both of these things which thou has seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee. So every appearing of God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Not only of what he has shown you in the past, but what he'll show you in the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 18, excuse me, 17. Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee. He delivers them from the people and then sends them back to the people &gt;&gt; to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan &gt;&gt; unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly &gt;&gt; May God add the blessing of the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in the presence of God. Amen. I would like to title my sermon this morning, being wholly sanctified unto the Lord. Because that's what the scripture says. the very God of peace sanctify you holy &gt;&gt; in every part of your being that your whole spirit and soul and body might be preserved blameless to the coming of the Lord Jesus. I would like to preach on this subject this morning of being sanctified holy unto the Lord. And I want to talk about and go in this direction of possessing the gates of the enemy. &gt;&gt; And to just remind you, brother Brennham said, "My worst enemy &gt;&gt; is myself. He said, "If I can learn to get myself out of the way, God might have his way in my life." &gt;&gt; So when we talk about so much of the time, Lord, deliver me from this devil and this thing that's bothering me, really, &gt;&gt; you might look in retrospect and say, Lord, deliver me from myself. &gt;&gt; Because it's self-inflicted. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got gates that have got problems and I need you to possess the gates. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of this enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are three scriptural principles being applied here. God sanctified Israel. &gt;&gt; I the Lord God I sanctify you. So there is sanctification that is coming from God and we'll speak about that. And then he says, "Sanctify yourselves." So God does a work of sanctification, but then he expects us to do sanctification ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I ask you, how do we sanctify ourselves? &gt;&gt; And he says, keep my statutes and do them. &gt;&gt; So this first part, I am the Lord who sanctifies you. We see that God sanctified Israel by peculiar privileges, laws, and favors and covenants that distinguished Israel from all other nations. &gt;&gt; It was God that chose them. So God now signifies to these people that they are set apart by God himself. &gt;&gt; God did it. I sanctify you. I am the Lord God. I sanctify you. &gt;&gt; And we see that God's people and are and will be people of distinction. God has set you apart. He has called you by a holy covenant. He wants you to be distinguished or set aside, separated unto him that you might show in your life holy conversation and a holy life by the life that you live. &gt;&gt; God, help us to live a sermon more than preach it. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Amen. God's sanctifying us is a good reason why we should sanctify ourselves. &gt;&gt; For what good are God's covenants to us unless we keep his commandments? &gt;&gt; God takes the first credit by saying it is I the Lord God who sanctify you. So we understand really this start of sanctification is not something of your works but it's God's works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet there's something for us to do. God leaves you. Each and every one of you &gt;&gt; man, woman, boy, girl, it doesn't matter. Every one of you have got something to do &gt;&gt; as far as sanctifying your life. We ask the question, how might I sanctify my life? When we sanctify ourselves, it is when we become obedient to the word and we do what the word says. Because in doing what the word says, we actually cleanse our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we accept the blood of Christ and thank him for dying for our sins, we are then justified before God. But there is another step. There must be a time of when we've not only accepted the sacrifice, but then we give ourselves back to God as a whole &gt;&gt; living sacrifice unto God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We sanctify ourselves. &gt;&gt; When we start walking in newness of life and keep the commandments, we're actually sanctifying ourselves by being obedient to the word. It's not the hearing of the word only, &gt;&gt; but the doers of the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Help us Lord to not only hear what the spirit's saying but to do &gt;&gt; what the spirit is telling us to do. &gt;&gt; In St. John 17 14- 20 I have given them thy word and the whole world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but thou shouldest keep them from evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. &gt;&gt; As thou has sent me into the world, even so I have also sent them into the world. and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth. &gt;&gt; Neither I pray for these alone, but for them also which have believed on me through their word. &gt;&gt; I believe that God is calling every one of us now to a higher calling. &gt;&gt; I do. I believe The bride of Christ has entered now into her final season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. I believe that we have been called now to a higher degree, &gt;&gt; to a higher placing than what you were uh a year ago, two years ago, &gt;&gt; or in the past. Right now, God is calling you to a higher sanctification. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said the angel came to him and said, "As long as you hold on to the first and second pull, the third can't come." &gt;&gt; He said, "In order for it to come, you've got to be more sincere." &gt;&gt; And I think more sincere. If that prophet was told by the angel, "You've got to be more sincere." I ask you and I, "How much more so for you and I?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God help us to be more sincere. You must be careful that the cares of life of this Liosian age and the culture in which we live among has little effect upon you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will have an effect. It just depends on how well insulated you are &gt;&gt; from it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we can isolate ourselves and go and do like Jim Jones and go to some jungle in Guyana and have a a a little campground and a compound where it's just us and nobody else and where, you know, uh we have all things in common and sisters do all the cooking and we grow our own food and we live there and we don't have mortgages and everything. It sounds good, doesn't it? And yet, brother Brennham said it won't work in our day. &gt;&gt; I mean, so much of the time we want to be relieved from all of the stress and the encumbrance of the world which is upon us. And yet, you got yourself into it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you might have asked for a job that you it's too much &gt;&gt; can't handle the pressure. Then you wonder why you're falling apart. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, don't ask God for something that you're not willing to follow through with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all want greener grass. We all want easier lifestyle, &gt;&gt; but um hey, let's face it. We're right here in Laa. &gt;&gt; And just about the time we catch up to the speed of the rats around us, the rat race gets faster. Along comes a faster rat. And the cares of life, if we're not careful, choke the feed, the seed, and it becomes unfruitful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so I do believe that the bride of Christ right now is being called to a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as the voice of God quickened John on the aisle of Patmas and said, "Come up hither, John." And the Bible says, "And immediately I was in the spirit." You got to get into the spirit, saints. And you don't need to hesitate. &gt;&gt; You got to get in. &gt;&gt; You got to get with it. &gt;&gt; If you're going to seek God, seek him now. &gt;&gt; Now is the time. This is the day. &gt;&gt; Now is the time of salvation. If you're going to get serious, get serious now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He has quickened you by his voice. &gt;&gt; He has sent to you a message &gt;&gt; that is called of God to prepare a people to go to a prepared place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in the everpresent water of the rock, Brother Brennham says this. Everything the birds sang different. Everybody was sweet. And oh my, how everything was just dandy when you first got saved. Do you remember that? &gt;&gt; Then come the trying time. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Nobody told me there'd be trials. &gt;&gt; The chastening, sanctifying time, sanctify yourselves from the things of the world, laying aside the weights that do so easily beset you. You, a man, had to stop your smoking, stop your drinking, stop going to pool room, your allight card parties, all those things. You had to sanctify yourself from them by the faith of the blood of Jesus Christ. Sanctifying yourself. You women had to let your hair grow out, lengthen your dresses, act like the different than what you was. Sanctifying time. Many times they'd rebel and go back. Well, that's not a child of God. I want to say this while I'm talking about how women let their hair grow and lengthen their dresses. I want to say how proud I am of those girls that sang that song. &gt;&gt; I looked at them and I said, "God, I am so proud." I said, "I believe you could say each one of them &gt;&gt; was exemplary." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of modest dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. clean faces, long hair. &gt;&gt; If I'm proud of them, how about God? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here in the midst of Ladia, &gt;&gt; there is a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are a few that have yet to bow their knees to the God of fashion and that this Baal, this end time god, the God of this evil age. There is people. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that you're a part of it. I'm glad I'm a part of it. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this gospel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice this that through the process of receiving the word of God there is a cleansing that is taking place. It is a purification. It is a purging from sin. You are being washed. You are being cleansed by the washing of the water by the word. It's not the preacher that does it. It's not the prophet that does it. It's not the pastor that does it. &gt;&gt; It's God who does it. &gt;&gt; You're being cleansed in your body and in your spirit and in your soul. There is a cleansing from guilt, from sin, and by the word of God which has been spoken. Understand this that to receive God's word is to receive cleansing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said about the woman at the well, even the disciples said if he knew what kind of woman this was. See, they looked at the outside. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He said, "But Jesus &gt;&gt; saw cleansing &gt;&gt; before repentance." &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Don't judge a book by its cover. Don't ever judge a person because of an outward appearance. &gt;&gt; For was it not Samuel &gt;&gt; who told Jesse, "God lookketh not upon the &gt;&gt; outward appearance, &gt;&gt; but he lookth upon the soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the soul is where it holds that predestinated seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there's a cleansing taking place. My mother's mother, I only met her a couple weeks before she died. She lived with us while we were here in Phoenix across from Turf Paradise Racetrack on Bell Road here. And she was going to the city of Hope for her cancer. But my grandmother, my mother would say, "Get them boys ready for bed." 7 8:00 at night and grandma would say, "You boys get in here." And she had she she used ivory soap. If I smell ivory soap to this day, I think immediately of grandma, my mother's mother, and she would just take that sink and fill it with water, put that rag down in there, and get just soap that thing up, and then she would scrub on you. And she had one hand on you while she's scrubbing with the other cuz you're wanting to get get away. And I mean to tell you when she got done scrubbing you, you were clean. You squeaked when you walked back to the bedroom. I say, "God, give us ministry." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They grab a hold of us with one hand and the other hand scrub us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take us in the filth of the the things and the grime and all of the complexes and all of the issues of Ladia and scrub us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take us and just wash us clean. Our spirits have been defiled. You've rubbed shoulders with devils. &gt;&gt; You've had things and and different issues that have come up against you all week. and you fought against the god of this evil age and it's affected you. &gt;&gt; You can't go into a mall without the music blaring, a restaurant music blaring, &gt;&gt; signs and things all around and it naked women here and all of these things and it just affects you. &gt;&gt; And what affects you the most? Listen to me. is that which had an influence on you prior to conversion. &gt;&gt; So the music of today when I hear it I have it has no effect &gt;&gt; on me. It's just noise &gt;&gt; but the music which was a the music in my age &gt;&gt; it has an effect. I hear it and unconsciously I start humming it. &gt;&gt; I all of a sudden I I'm singing a song &gt;&gt; and unconsciously you're just kind of it it's sucked you into it. &gt;&gt; And my wife will say, "What are you doing? Oh, excuse me. Scooy, Satan, I rebuke you. Just like the natural man who goes to work. And you, some of you that have jobs where you work hard, you sweat, you get dirty, you get in the trenches, you know, you don't work behind a a desk and in an air conditioned office, but you actually get down and dirty. It's so nice to be able to come home and get cleaned up and then have have a dinner &gt;&gt; because it refreshes you to get cleaned up before you go to bed. Wow, what a blessing. How many of you are thankful for a shower and a bathtub and a clean bed? Huh? And a wife that loves you and the nice food that she serves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My wife baked some bread yesterday. My the best bread I've ever eaten in my life. I We ate a whole loaf. I just kept I need another one. No, honey. Yes. Yes. Okay, honey. I'm not supposed to, but I Yeah, I said I eat a whole loaf, man. Just butter that dude up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a reason I'm fat. It's the woman thou gave us. But they're just to be thankful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That that resonated in my mind this whole from Wednesday night &gt;&gt; all the way through is still resonating. Sandy and I, you know, hey, I'm thankful that for this and I'm thankful for that. I believe saints of God when you are thankful or you're grateful. How many of you love to give somebody who's grateful for the gift you give them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, if they're not grateful, give it back. &gt;&gt; Spoiled rotten. &gt;&gt; No, it's always But God loves a cheerful giver. &gt;&gt; Even if they're not a cheerful receiver &gt;&gt; anyway. So your spiritual man is defiled here amongst the laian age in which you live. It has an effect. &gt;&gt; The Sodom condition around us is a vexation. &gt;&gt; Televisions, movies, social media and the internet are the highest forms of brainwashing and influence. in the world today. &gt;&gt; It influences all forms of our society. &gt;&gt; And it affects each one of you. Brother Brennham said on basis of fellowship back in ' 61. Now there's several quotes on this, but brother Brennan was talking about a rabbi. He was speaking to him and he says here not long ago I was speaking on this at a fellowship meeting and one of the great rabbis in the United States met me back behind there and I never heard that like that in my life been a rabbi and come from a generation of rabbi rabbi to rabbi to rabbi now he's a Pentecostal rabbi with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I was preaching with him in shreport and the lady told him sir Uh uh Rabbi, I have a television put in your room. He said, "Not television, television. &gt;&gt; Take them out of there." And so, Brother Brennham, now I want you to understand television is one of the highest forms of influence in the world today. You see it and you receive it in the womb of your mind and you take it into your spirit. Even brother Brennham uh in his day uh he said his wife told him to go buy uh her a pair of stockings, rayon or chiffon. I can't remember which one it was. But brother Bram said, uh, "Ah, I can do that. I, you know, chiffon, chiffon, chiffon, like that." Somebody said, "Hey, Bill, how you doing? How's the fishing?" Oh, like that. Next thing you know, boom, he can't remember what it was. But remember, now I'm taking you a little further than that. And he says, "Why? I brought home some dish soap." Said, "Honey, you ain't never going to have to wash them dishes again because all the food's just going to fall right off." So just put in there. That's what the advertisement says. You don't No more scrubbing. Just put it in there and it'll fall off. Oh, Bill. You You just Do you believe everything that you're told? How many of you have ever told somebody else, "Hey, man, don't believe that." Hey. Huh? So many times we get sucked in by certain things and and this is the uh this is the sure cure. This this will cure anything from toonial fungus to gout to cancer. You just take this and drink this thing and you'll get rid of constipation. You'll get rid of uh bloating. You'll get rid of uh uh all the weight you got and it'll drop off you overnight. &gt;&gt; And the moment you click on it, I'm going to tell you in just a minute. Just hold on. Just in one minute. I'm going to tell you how you and 40 minutes later they still ain't told you. &gt;&gt; And guess what that does? That puts you a link to something else. So the next time you you get all these advertisements, &gt;&gt; how to lose weight, how to this, that I tell you what. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, television used to be censored. Videos used to be censored. They used to bleep, you know. Well, that guy said bleep bleep and he did bleep. If they did that today, there'd be no dialogue &gt;&gt; in the music, &gt;&gt; in the, you know, in the media &gt;&gt; because now, uh, horrible, vulgar words are said and it doesn't bother anybody anymore &gt;&gt; because the devil wants to desensitize you. &gt;&gt; You understand? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, one little word here and there. It used to be that the first one that come along, oh, I'm not turn the channel, do this, turn that thing off. I ain't going to listen to that. &gt;&gt; Well, what's happened is you become desensitized to it. God, help us to keep our lives sanctifi. I'm going to I'm going to come into the area where we're living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And talk about some of these things. The reason that you're having here in America the rise of violence among youth is because it's been swn into their minds. &gt;&gt; They've seen it on television and movies. They have glorified killing and using guns and go ahead and make my day and all of this stuff that is permeated into their minds to where young children 8 and 9 years old are facing police officers using weapons. &gt;&gt; What did it? &gt;&gt; There was seed sown into them. the violence, the sex, the premarital sex, all of this kind of stuff has absolutely permeated the minds. They said by the time a young person in the world now who has watched televisions and all of these uncensored programs has not only seen adultery and killing and murder and that sort of thing that by the time they're 16 they've seen just in murders alone over 40,000 murders. This is what the media they make studies because America right now is is mega dosing. I shouldn't say just America. The world has gone pleasure mad. &gt;&gt; They uh the things of pleasure and if it feels good do it &gt;&gt; until they have mega dosed on the things of this world until what happens is it starts to affect you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. When Israel started losing battles, they were given a word, "Thou shalt not lose a man. You'll not lose a battle. I, the Lord God, will go before you. I will fight your battles." And Joshua knew that he went to a battle one day and he lost some men. And when he did, he went before God. And God said, "Get up off of your face, Joshua. There's sin in the camp. The people are no longer sanctifying themselves." And so, you know the story. Remember, God told him, "There'll not be any army stand before you. Nothing will stop you. There will not be any people strong enough. There's no giant big enough. But what I will go before you. I want you to understand now. Let's bring it down home. Because as it was with them, so will it be with us. If you're losing ground, &gt;&gt; if you're losing battles, if you're having harder time now than you have before, sanctify yourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to get into this now and we're going to show you in Joshua 7 12 and 13. Therefore, the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies but turn their backs before their enemies because they were accursed. Neither will I be with you anymore except you destroy the cursed thing from you among you. up. Sanctify the people and say, "Sanctify yourselves against the moral." In other words, what you've been doing, don't do it anymore. We're losing men. We're losing ground. Sanctify yourselves. &gt;&gt; For thus sayith the Lord God of Israel. There's an oursed thing in the midst of thee, oh Israel. Thou canst not stand before thine enemies till you take away the thing from among you. Many times it's the little boxes that spoil the vine. &gt;&gt; When do you remember when we first came to the message? &gt;&gt; Why? I tell you, one of the very first things we kicked out was the television, &gt;&gt; the worldly music, &gt;&gt; the worldly entertainment, all of those things. Divorce was unheard of among message believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Churches were filled with saints just wanting to hear the word. Tell me what he said. &gt;&gt; It was very common to travel long distances in your car. &gt;&gt; Not in an airplane, in your car. Drive from Tucson to Arkansas. Sister Molly Johnson was just a young girl. We got on the Tucson Tabernacle bus and we're going back to some meetings back in Arkansas and they had two old men that were going to drive the bus and we're supposed to drive all night. It's, you know, takes a long time to get there. And so everybody's all happy being on this bus and so we're riding along and everything after about six or eight hours and sun starts going down these brother and they got so tired said we're going to have to quit because we're just we just can't keep driving our eyes and everything like that. Is there anybody here on this bus that has got a you know that can drive a dual speed axle? And I kind of hunkered down, you know, I drove a lumber truck up in in Oregon and so finally, okay, I'll do it. So anyway, uh I got in there and we we drove the bus and we drove all night and I I drove from about 10:00 at night till the sun came up the next morning. I had a great time. I enjoyed it. Everybody slept. Nothing worse than have a driver when he lugs the engine in a higher gear when he ought to downshift, go up a hill and you sit in the back of the bus and downshift, grab a gear lower, right? And then you know you Anyway, Sister Molly, she's just young girl at that time and she sat there and we told stories and made them laugh and everything. So, Sister Molly goes way back and that was a time when Sandy and I were we were just engaged. Yeah. And I remember going to the meetings. I tell you, we went to the meetings. So, so anyway, Sandy and I were holding hands there as we're going into the meeting and one of the deacons saw me. He said, "Hey, hey, don't you hold her hand." I said, "Uh, well, we're engaged. That's my fiance. It don't matter." Yes, sir. Anyway, it used to be that we Hey, we we we persevered, got in a car, we drove all the way, and when we got to the meetings, we got there early. &gt;&gt; Because we were excited. We wanted to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were excited to be there. People fellowshipped around the word of God and the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; When we got together, even after the meeting, we were talking about what was preached. &gt;&gt; We were rejoicing on what we were hearing. &gt;&gt; There was no news about uh who's in the World Series or the Super Bowl. I could care less. &gt;&gt; Nobody knew the names of movie stars. What was the upand cominging movie? &gt;&gt; It's time that we sanctify ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everything that we do, the word is a sharp two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to take this eventually and show you the dividing user between spirit and soul. &gt;&gt; And we're going to look at that triune being of man. And we're going to hear some things that the prophet of God said as an example. He said, "You say,"Well, I've got the Holy Ghost. I'm saved." And he said, "That don't mean nothing." Then he takes it because now what is his doctrinal teaching? You got to have the Holy Ghost. You got to have the seal of God to go in the rapture. Here he says that don't mean nothing. But now take the teaching because he says it depends on the level of your anointing &gt;&gt; because it can be on the body and on the spirit and your soul just as black as night and the devil's still sitting on your throne room. You're justified, sanctified, but do not have him on your control room. in the sermon waters of separation. The water of separation separates for you from sin. I'm gonna go to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Robert. The water of separation separates you from sin. If you are weary, apply the water of the word. If you are sick, apply the water of the word. For it separates you from sickness. Separates us from sin. It separates us from weary. It separates us from every attribute that sin produced. Oh, I love it. For he has washed us and cleansed us through the washing of the water by the word and separated us unto himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't stay around the word of God very long, but what it starts to wash you has an effect on you. &gt;&gt; If the word is not having an effect on you, there's something wrong. Either it's not the word being preached or you're not applying it. &gt;&gt; Starts washing you, cleansing you, &gt;&gt; separates you. &gt;&gt; The fellowship by redemption. Hold on now. I'm not just wanting to read quotes, but this is substantiating this thought we're talking about. This waters of separation must be kept in a clean place. Oh, wish we could deal on that a little while. A clean place. Waters of separation is the word. &gt;&gt; Paul said over in Ephesians over here said, "For he has washed us with the water of the word." See, the waters of the separation the word preaching the word separates you. You hear the word say, "I'm wrong." &gt;&gt; Or are you always right? &gt;&gt; It's good when you see yourself and say, "I failed there. &gt;&gt; I'm wrong." &gt;&gt; Some people never say, "I'm wrong." Some people never say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; Oh, you proud God, help us humble ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm sorry. I'm I'm wrong. Forgive me. &gt;&gt; I didn't do right. I'm wrong. I better quit this. I'm playing church. I better quit that." See, that's the water of separation. It should be kept in a place. Not a cigarette smoking preacher. No, sir. Not a preacher that's running around over the country, run with other women and things like that. Not a church that practice free love and all these go ungodly things, goes to baseball games and has big entertainments and social dances in the church is to be kept the word of God kept in a clean place. Amen. A clean place. &gt;&gt; That's when the wayward man comes by, he can come into a clean place and be sprinkled with the waters of separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to know that the word of God and the message of the hour is a water of separation. &gt;&gt; It'll take the old filthy abominable things that you did cause you to get right. &gt;&gt; I was wrong. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Lord. &gt;&gt; Cleanse you from old filthy habits. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. How many of you remember when you first came to the message? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; It seemed like that every sermon was another piece of the world being hacked off of you. in this and in that and television and radios and comic books or whatever that you had and the next thing you know it's just being taken away from you and you you didn't sit there and begrudge God when he took it from you &gt;&gt; but you said Lord okay I'm a sheep shear me Lord he said a real sheep says Hear me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; In the marriage of the lamb, Esther perched her heart before God, washed up with a meek and humble spirit. The church that's going to be the bride of Christ. So now he's taking Esther, a church that's going to be the bride of Christ. Esther. Esther. Somebody say Esther. &gt;&gt; Esther. Don't you love Esther, Ruth, and these different stories? My tell me about those women of faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go before the king. If I perish, I perish. &gt;&gt; Now remember, Esther refused the worldly adorement. She took the spirit in her heart &gt;&gt; to go before the king. She took the spirit. It's a sweet, kind, reverent spirit of the word of God. Washed by the water of the word and the word in you. It's a washing. Amen. The church needs a washing. A full gospel washing. That's right. Not just a part washing, but a full gospel washing. Cleaned up, made new creatures in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Ordinary water won't do it. &gt;&gt; Yes, water is called a universal solvent. But even water baptism outside of godly repentance is only being going down a wet center and coming up or a dry center and coming up a wet one. &gt;&gt; Because the precedent to water baptism is repentance, &gt;&gt; a turning from your ways. Bring forth me fruits of repentance. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just saying, "Well, I'm sorry." No, a real godly. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, God. I turn from my ways. &gt;&gt; Water baptism. There is no virtue in the water. &gt;&gt; It is in the act is only a symbol of what God is doing in your heart. And you were buried as the old man going down in oldness and coming up in newness of life. &gt;&gt; Many people come to water baptism and stop right there &gt;&gt; and they think that's enough. They believe on the Lord Jesus and stop. But you must keep going to the next step which is sanctification. Many people go to sanctification and stop. They don't keep going. They live a good, clean, holy life. They dress right. They talk right. Yet there's another step. Water, blood, spirit constitutes a birth. Somebody say birth. &gt;&gt; Birth. &gt;&gt; A birth. water, blood, spirit is a birth. &gt;&gt; The new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not the seal of God. &gt;&gt; It's not the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The new birth is simply a birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a new creature in Christ Jesus. But now you are placed under tutors and governors to see are you faithful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Though he be a son and heir to all things, he's no more than a servant. &gt;&gt; And he's under a time appointed by the father under tutors and governors for them to bring back a report. How's my son? How's my daughter doing? Ah, he ain't doing too good. He ain't listening. &gt;&gt; He's not ready to take his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Doesn't have his father's character. A little renegade, a little shyer. &gt;&gt; He comes to church, but he listens, but he don't hear. See, God is wanting all of you when you come to church, hear what the spirit of God &gt;&gt; is saying. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going slow and some of you are sleepy. &gt;&gt; Everybody stand up for a minute. Stand up. Stand up. Little calisthenics, a little raise your hands. Hallelujah. Okay, you feeling better now? Okay, go ahead and sit down. If you're not careful, what happens is while the word of God is going forth, you have a tendency to just, oh yeah, I know you love me and trust me so much that Lord, it's just such a blessing to be in tr. The new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham, will all born again believers go in the rapture? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Nope. If you make the new birth, the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the seal, the token of God, then brother Brennham answers all of those questions incorrectly. &gt;&gt; No, he said only the Holy Ghost filled ones. &gt;&gt; So there's a difference between salvation and being sealed of God. Saved and not sealed. &gt;&gt; Had he right asked for the salvation of her two boys, &gt;&gt; right? Right? &gt;&gt; They'll be saved. But are they bride? &gt;&gt; If they were bride, if they were bride, they would be doing what the word tells them to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many are called, but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election sure. &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin will be saved. &gt;&gt; Had no oil. Come on. &gt;&gt; Wasn't sealed of God. Are they going to do they have eternal life? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; They will be in heaven. &gt;&gt; They will have eternal life. &gt;&gt; They'll not live in the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Now, let's take the doctrinal teaching of the prophet and of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you in the sermon, the countdown, 1962. Brother Brandon, so if a man sets on the thought of just sanct justification's all you have to have, he's wrong. &gt;&gt; He's got to be wrong. And if the church who believes that the like the many of the Pentecostals that the Holy Ghost is it, that's all. Just repent and get the Holy Ghost. That's still wrong. &gt;&gt; Wow. Because you got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in. I want to ask you, do you think God seals an unholy vessel &gt;&gt; contrary to God? He does not seal an unholy vessel. &gt;&gt; If you don't, you leave out the blood. See, the new birth as people talks about the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth. Now, that's wrong. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new birth. &gt;&gt; The new birth is when you're born again. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is when power comes into the birth for service. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those disciples been serving the Lord Jesus for years under his ministry, &gt;&gt; preaching the gospel, &gt;&gt; casting out devils with only a new birth. &gt;&gt; And he told them, "I want you to go into Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and tarry until you are endued with power." &gt;&gt; Power. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the Holy Ghost is. It's power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a wonder working power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this. &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to back that up, St. John 5:24, he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life. See, he's got life because he believes. And that same group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. See, exactly. Holy Ghost is powerful service. So when you talk you like like you got to be born again and applying that to the Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth are wrong there. And I want to say many message believers are wrong there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; They just Well, you just do you believe the message? Yeah, you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, wait a second. I want to Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? Let me see the fruits of the Holy Ghost in your life. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; He cannot just won't cope with it. See, they'd already believed to eternal life and so forth, but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power. You shall be witnesses unto me after the Holy Ghost is come upon you because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ. no longer bases with the sincere milk of the word, but now you have become adults, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Those who are of full age, born again. You're a baby. I don't know any of you sisters that gave birth to a full grown man. Oh, he might have been a big baby. He might have been a 10 pound whopper, &gt;&gt; but you know what? He's still baby. still got to go in the milk and everything. That That's right. &gt;&gt; So, the new birth is you're a new creature in Christ Jesus. You're a baby and you got to learn to walk. &gt;&gt; You got to learn to walk before you run &gt;&gt; and you're going to fall down. You're going to make mistakes. Yeah. That's what life is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is hey, you know, your parents, they they're pretty smart. My dad, you know, he was one of these guys, especially us boys, you know, we trip and fall. We run all the way home from the ball field. Your elbows got a big old knot on it like this out here cuz you tripped and fell or you're riding your bicycle and you went over the handlebars and you went home and you didn't even cry till you got about two blocks from the house and then and by the time you got to the door, you're losing it. &gt;&gt; What's the matter? What's the matter? I fell. I fell. So what? It's too far from your heart to kill you. Get back out there. I wanted sympathy. I didn't get any sympathy. Some of you want to be babyed so much you fall. You have a issue. Oh. Oh, I need you to be pray. No, you don't need prayer. &gt;&gt; Get back up. Go on. &gt;&gt; You don't need hands laid on you. No. Oh, well come. Oh, come here. Come here, baby. Come here. Could you see me taking this brother? Come up here. Come up here, my brother. Sit on daddy's lap. Oh, good. Huh? Or brother David? Huh? Come up here, brother David. Sit right here. Are you kidding me? You're born children, babies. You grow to be adults. Key to the door, Brother Ram said. So communion is for Christians. It's born again. We're taking communion tonight. &gt;&gt; Communion is for those that are born again &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. And born again does not necessarily mean that you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now remember now many teach that. I don't know anybody that teaches it like this as old brother Arggonite and the other night from the pulver sea. The new birth is not the baptism of the holy spirit. Scripture doesn't support it. I don't think so. See to my way of seeing it. Amen. There's a vast difference between having salvation and being bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's your faith in the word of God that cleanses you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your faith in God's word is what purifies your heart. the revelation of God's word. Not just hearing it, not hearing preachers preach about it, though it be taught so eloquent. Though you have graphs and pictures and ooh and awe and oh that's how it is. Oh my, I never saw it like that until revelation takes it from head knowledge down into a inspiration in your heart and the inspiration becomes a manifestation. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's your faith. It's you sanctifying yourself. &gt;&gt; But let me clarify that. I feel a little checked. It's not your faith. It's a gift of God. God gave you the faith, but yet you got it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. For by grace are you saved through faith, and that being a gift of God, huh, and not of works, lest any man boast. &gt;&gt; So the the gift of faith &gt;&gt; is given to you freely, &gt;&gt; but you got to use it. &gt;&gt; What is What good is it to have the gift of faith and you never use it? What good is it to have a tool in your toolbox and you never use it? Now in Acts 15:es 7-9, and when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, "Men and brethren, you know how that God that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God which knoweth the hearts, bear them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us, and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Do you see what God's doing? He's purifying their hearts through a revelation that God is giving them. &gt;&gt; So that's what the bride of Christ is doing today. Her revelation is actually her cleansing. She's being washed by the water of the word. She's being cleansed by the word which she has heard spoken. She, if she's catching the revelation and applying it, she is then washed by the revelation of the word. 1 Corinthians 6 9-12. And know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you, &gt;&gt; but ye were washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, I say I'm guilty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of the above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I've been washed. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the washing. &gt;&gt; But you are sanctified. You are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God. All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will be brought I will not be brought under the power of any. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; St. John 17:1 17 says, "Sanctify them through thy truth. &gt;&gt; Thy word &gt;&gt; is truth. That's what the revelation of God's word does to you. It sanctifies you. Sanctify you. Sanctifies you through the truth. &gt;&gt; Did you realize that when you have received the spoken word of the hour because you got to recognize your day and its message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you receive that, actually, what's happening to you? You're being sanctified by the word of God that's been sent to you. &gt;&gt; Don't you realize Moses's word sanctified Israel? &gt;&gt; Samuel's word sanctified the people. &gt;&gt; Paul's word sanctified the people. &gt;&gt; Luther's word. &gt;&gt; Wesley's This prophet of the end time has sanctified &gt;&gt; the people. &gt;&gt; It's a message. It's a separating message. &gt;&gt; Everybody who likes a likes a a mixer, not a separator. &gt;&gt; I want a guy that'll compromise and well, hey, don't preach it so hard. Come on, man. Back off. Relax. I remember my brother and I going to a high school reunion. My brother and I were popular in high school. I'll admit that. No brag, just fact. People like twins. Oh, are you twins? Yeah. Anyway, it was, I think, a five or 10 year reunion and we were back in Monrovia, California. uh where we had gone to high school and we went to a a little steak place and we were standing in line to make our order for the steak and the girl standing behind my brother and I. And uh so anyway, my brother had at that time he had left the message, went back to California, started his own surfboard shop and his Lucadia surf and skiing and he grew his hair long and he was all tan and he had a gold chain around his neck and he's wearing shorts and sandals and you know looking hip for his time. And so anyway, we're standing in line. We're getting ready to order and the girl behind us says, "Excuse me, excuse me." She asked, "Uh, uh, are you one of the twins?" Speaking to my brother. Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, uh, which one are you, Ronard? Oh, I'm Don. Oh, wow. Wow. That's so nice. Where is your brother? And I'm standing right next to him. I'm his twin. She She says, "Where is Ron?" He's right here. She looked at me and looked at him and said, "Oh, you look so plain." Later, my brother, he says, "You look so plain." I said, "I can't wait for God to burn off this loud Jezebel, you know." Hey, relax. Relax, man. Don't get on my king. Yeah. I started putting him back on him. Anyway, do you know what? God has called you to be different, &gt;&gt; saints of God. He has He has called you. He has sanctified you. And you sanctify yourselves. And if you don't sanctify yourselves, if you don't look different, you're not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you look like the world, act like the world, talk like the world, you are of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that the children of Israel had been affected for 400 years under the Egyptian rule and the Egyptian culture for 400 years in captivity and that culture had an effect on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. even to the point when they they were delivered by Moses, sanctified under his ministry, went out in there and they wanted to go back to the leaks and garlics. Right? &gt;&gt; They forgot the taskmaster. &gt;&gt; Not only that, but the Canaanites upon whom they were to enter the land and take the land and fight against the inhabitants thereof. That had an effect on them also. Listen, Louda has an effect on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You young people, old people, every one of you listen to me. It has an effect. &gt;&gt; You're in it. &gt;&gt; You're right in the midst of the worst of all times of the media and of music and of books and of everything around you and the people and the people's minds have gone crazy. Hey, you're the only normal ones in this whole city. &gt;&gt; Everybody else, I went shopping the other day with a wife and I sat down in a chair and I just said, "You go shop. I'll wait till you I'll just pay for it when you get done. Just go shopping. I'm sitting there and u the people that come in I looked at them and I said, "Oh my." Have you guys opened your eyes and seen what the people look like? I I said, "God, take me out of this place." &gt;&gt; Huh? Remember, Brother Ram said, "I went into the regions of the lost." Remember, he's a young boy. He he says, "I went into a vision. I saw women with their with their makeup on and green eyes and everything like that." He said, "There I was in where was it? J C Penney or May Company or something. He's on an escalator. Here come the women up the deal." And he they had all the same pain. And he said, he says, "Oh my, I got so upset." I said, "Ma, ma, I got to go." Why? He was seeing what he had seen in a vision of souls in prison and the things was happening. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh my, &gt;&gt; are we there?" &gt;&gt; The lid of hell, understand, has been ripped off. &gt;&gt; But anytime that the devil makes a move, God makes a counter move. &gt;&gt; God's not going to let you suffer. God's not going to let you uh uh uh not have a way of escape. God gives you a way of escape. But many times you don't you don't recognize it. &gt;&gt; Oh, like that that guy that during the flood Matthew Vasaki was talking to me the other day. He said, "Yeah, the guy you you know he's on the roof of his house and and you know, God, why didn't he wound up drowning? Wound up drowning." And and when he got to heaven, he said, "God, I thought you were I asked you to save me." He said, "I sent a boat. You told the guys in a boat, it's okay. He'll he'll Yeah, I sent you a helicopter. You told the guy, "It's okay. I'll be all right." I wonder how many times God has sent you a boat, a helicopter, a way out, and you just I'll be all right. I can It's okay. Go ahead, God. Go to sleep in my boat. I can handle this. &gt;&gt; You can't handle it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wake up, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Canaanites have influence on you. &gt;&gt; It's all around you. You rub shoulders with them every day. In Exodus 23:es 31-33, "And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea, even under the sea of Philistines, and from the desert under the river. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and thou shalt drive them out before thee, and thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods, and they shall not dwell in the land, lest they make thee sin against me. &gt;&gt; If thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. Leviticus 18:es 3-4. After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, you shall not do. After the doings of the land of Canaan, whether I bring you, you shall not do, neither shall you walk in their ordinances. Ye shall do my judgments and keep mine ordinances to walk therein. I am the Lord your God. Israel failed to keep themselves sanctified amongst the people of the land. I'm wondering is that happening to us? Are you failing to keep yourselves your house sanctified before the Lord? I'm asking you, judge yourself. &gt;&gt; Remember one of the last things that Joshua told the children of Israel when they're crossing over into Canaan, sanctify yourselves. And then he's told, "Circumcise Israel again." Like we heard the other day talk about two circum there's only one circumcision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't circumcise a man twice. stay with the scriptural teaching. &gt;&gt; Now, even Joshua questioned the Lord. But I'm going to show you. I think sometimes what happens is we fail to do all of the word of God just like Israel did. And they're in a movement of God. And yet even Moses failed to circumcise. Huh? Thank God for Zapora. &gt;&gt; Zapora, are you here? &gt;&gt; Stand up for the word of God. &gt;&gt; Thou art a bloody husband to me. &gt;&gt; Joshua 5:es 2-7. And at that time the Lord said unto Joshua, "Make thee sharp knives, circumcise again the children of Israel the second time." Whoa. I thought there was only one circumcision. circumcised them a second time. Now God's going to clarify it for him otherwise it becomes unclear and Joshua made him sharp knives circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of foreskins and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise here you want to know cause and effect you want to know here it is here's the cause all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt And &gt;&gt; now all the people that came out were circumcised. All the old people &gt;&gt; they were circumcised. But all the people who were born in the wilderness, by the way, as they came forth out of Egypt, them had not been circumcised. &gt;&gt; We're so caught up in the message. &gt;&gt; We're so busy. We failed to tell our own kids, you need to have the Holy Ghost. You need to be circumcised. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says the children walked 40 years. Verse seven, and their children whom they raised in theirstead, God raises up them. Joshua circumcised. Who got circumcised? There was nobody circumcised. The second time Israel was circumcised because the others it did them no good. It became just a Huh. Even Paul said circumcision, uncircumcision, nothing. because you have made it like a law. &gt;&gt; Not because you were adherent to the word. &gt;&gt; It just became a ritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was necessary for God to tell them to do this because they failed to sanctify their own families. Now in doing so, remember as I started with the scripture, may you be wholly sanctified in your body and in your spirit and in your soul. Now, brother Brennham says in the sermon, the rapture, I got two I got this quote and then I got I'm going to pass out some paper here to you so you guys can have some. I've only I said I don't know how many will want it. So, I think we only did 70. But if you want one, well, I'm going to give one to the head of the family and you can share it with your wife and your kids. And our young people, you should get one yourself. But in the sermon, the rapture, you say, "I got the baptism, the Holy Ghost." That don't mean that you're saved. Not by a long ways. Woo! Woo! Somebody say amen to that. &gt;&gt; What does he mean? &gt;&gt; That don't mean you're saved. Not by a long ways. I understand. That's why you got to read before, you got to read after. Otherwise, you're going to get confused and your kids are going to say, "Well, my somebody told me I need the Holy Ghost and that's the token and and you ain't going without the token. And if it got to token, I'm going and I'm in and on and on. And now he said, "I don't mean nothing." He said, "Look at here. You're a triune V. You are inside this little fellow here is is the soul. The next is the spirit. The next is the body." Now, you got five senses in this body to contact your earthly home. They don't contact the rest of it. It's just your earthly home. Right? &gt;&gt; You got five senses of the spirit here. Love and conscience, so forth. But here is where you live. That's what you are. He's talking about the soul, the heart. That's who you are. &gt;&gt; That's what you are. &gt;&gt; Brethren, go ahead and come forth if you have. Did we Did we print out some of those, brethren? Did you do that? &gt;&gt; On the coffee bar. &gt;&gt; They're on the coffee bar. Okay. I tell you what. We won't waste time right now. I'm just going to put it on the overhead. But you that want one, when you leave, you get one at the coffee bar cuz you know what? I'm going to use it next service. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram then says, "Now Jesus said, rain falls on the just and the unjust. One of them will be a cockleberg because that's all he is. The cockab will raise his hand, shout just like the same as the wheat." So, let me close with this graph here. And I'm just going to take this and expound on it just a moment. And I've got a laser here. Yeah, it works. Now, I want you to see the threepart nature of man. You have the outer court, the inner court, and the holy of holies. This is the same as the tabernacle in the wilderness. Okay, now this is many of you have not been around when I did this teaching years ago and I'm sorry for the graphs and I, you know, I tried to take the picture that I had from something I taught uh years ago and send it to the and I didn't know how to do it. I couldn't, you know, copy paste and everything. I just got lost. Finally, I took that which I had. I said I gave it to Ethan. I said, "Have them print it up. Have them do it." So now you have the outer court, the old man. And we show you the scriptures. 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Hebrews 4. And so now understand that this flesh man, he's the outer court. He's the that brother Brandham also calls it the living room. &gt;&gt; Okay? And he says, "Now watch this. First pull has to do only with the outer court, with the flesh man &gt;&gt; laying hands on the sick. It's the body. It's healing the sick. That's the body. Okay. But then he goes into the second pole. He starts discerning the spirit. &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, I see. You're not from here. You're from another city. Oh, I see. I see what's troubling you." So now he starts discerning spirit because what he couldn't see on the outside he now begins to discern using discernment of spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so now here's where I want to start and lay a foundation for you and show you that there are these gates that lead into or has an effect upon the carnal man. See, taste, smell, feel, hear. And every one of you when you were a baby, everything that was a stimuli around you, you tried to understand your world by seeing it, tasting it, feeling it like babies. &gt;&gt; That's why you put these little chandeliers in front of them and it spins and moves in a little be. And then finally, he reaches up and he grabs one. What does he want to do? He wants to taste it. Why? He's trying to assimulate to his little body. What is that? What does it do? Uh and everything. So, see t then he smells it. Huh? Whatever. You take a little rattle. Huh? Mamas, you got little rattles. Kids love rattles. I went to the carnival one time and I bought me or I I won. You know those rings you throw and you go around a bottle and you win something? I won one of these whistles and it was a shrill, a high shrill. Well, I went through the house just blowing that thing as hard as I could. And it it was a I was mesmerized. I was locked. I was in tune. My eyes was closed. And all of a sudden, this hand come broke that thing. I looked at my mom. She's going, "You're driving me nuts. It's a whistle. You must be crazy." You see, kids, they do silly things. They like loud. Huh? &gt;&gt; God, remember not the sins of my youth? You remember how you used to like a loud car, loud muffer? Yeah. Go through a tunnel. Like it was, you know, or or music. You liked it loud. You turn it up, man. Now, as the older I get, I want silence. Silence. And yet I look back and I say, God, thank you. &gt;&gt; I don't want a loud muffler now. I don't. Huh? &gt;&gt; I I rode in a Tesla the other day. This is the second time I've ever been in a Tesla. Wow. Silent. There's no turning on the motor. There's We just start moving. &gt;&gt; This is weird. And you know this thing, it it parks itself. It drives itself. I never said he said, "You want to see something?" He said, "This thing drives itself." Auto drive like this. He starts talking to me. I'm getting nervous, man. Watch the This thing drives itself. It parks itself. Huh? But I don't know why I'm saying all that, but um this technology and everything that we're in now and and youth the God, may we have and may we have understanding for our youth, moms, dads, listen to me. I I went to dinner with my daughter and my grandson the other day at Malachi. We sat at the table My daughter says, "Uh, Dad, if you had it to do all over again, would you do anything different?" Man, I put my head down because I I thought of all the things how that I applied the law. I didn't understand them. I I was so legalistic. &gt;&gt; I said, Rebecca, I said, knowing what I know now, &gt;&gt; I said I would do things different. But I didn't know what I know now then. And I said, if I haded to do all over again, I would have done the exact same thing because at the moment, I thought it was right. And yet I was hoping there would be an elder or somebody that would come and shake me up and say, "Son, let your kids be kids." &gt;&gt; They make mistakes. &gt;&gt; They do stupid things. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm not putting you down. &gt;&gt; They do. Don't put that bean up your nostril. And guess what? As soon as you leave, up it goes. Why? You told them not to do it. Don't touch that. It's hot. Guess what they got to do? How hot? &gt;&gt; Some kids learn by just telling them it's hot. Don't touch it. Okay, won't touch it. Some of your kids How hot? Right. And guess what? the kids. The apple don't fall far from the tree. &gt;&gt; Was you stubborn, hard-headed? &gt;&gt; Did you give your mom and dad a problem now and then? &gt;&gt; I am cursed by my mother. My mother, we gave her such a hard time. She says, "Son, I hope when you grow up and you get married, you have kids just like you. My mother didn't understand. I'm a far better grandfather as a father than I was as a father because I know something now. &gt;&gt; I know something. I I've got some experience and I I love my kids and my grandkids and we had some over to the house the other day in Prescuit and I tell you what, I just I loved it. I loved it. I just want my family with me. &gt;&gt; Now, what about our spiritual family? I just want my family with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I realize some of the kids say, "Yeah, they're they're having a hard time." And I'm going to show you. Let's go back to our graph here for a moment. And just going to show you now. God uses one of these gates for the seed of God to come and make its way. Now, here's a womb. This is the mind. The mind is the womb to your spirit. You understand that? The mind. Where's the greatest battle ever fought? &gt;&gt; Where is the seed aborted? &gt;&gt; In the womb. the spermicide of unbelief. You can hear the word and say, "I don't believe it." And the spermicide kills the germ of life. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says that faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. So God uses the heargate for you. He that heareth my words. &gt;&gt; So the through the process of hearing you hear the word it comes into the mind and where's the greatest battle ever fought mind. &gt;&gt; Where is it that most of us have our greatest battle in my mind. We're going to get into this a further later and through then now here you have these five gates to the spirit musicians if you come I'm closing with this you guys when you leave take a copy of this and you look at it because we'll go over this graph uh when we come to church again and then we'll talk about the five gates to the spirit memory imagination, conscience, affection, and reason. Because many times ministers are not really preaching the word. They're preaching emotion, &gt;&gt; sensation, reasoning. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, you can just imagine how many of you, you want to go to heaven, you want to see your grandma. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to be there. Yes. it, you know, and so you use the memory, the imagination, the conscience, the affection. But where what gate was it that the devil used on Eve in the Garden of Eden? &gt;&gt; Reasoning. What gate will he use against most of you? &gt;&gt; Reasoning. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm doing what I do because I justify it in my own reasoning. &gt;&gt; Sometimes what you go through, it's self-inflicted. &gt;&gt; You reasoned that it was okay and it wasn't. [Music] If we're not careful, ministers come right along. And I'll give you an example with brother Brandham. His first sermon. He said, "The first sermon I preached," he said, "Like a young lawyer, I got up there, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm going to prove my case." He get up here and he said, "I took the word of God and I cried. They cried." And he said, "Everybody cried." He said, "I went back to the back room. How'd I do?" Worst sermon I ever heard. Bill, what? But they cried. He said, "Bill, you just stomped around and just used the channel of emotion and affection. Got them all crying." He said, "You never even said the word." boy. He said, "Took the wind right out of my sails." I want to then go through some of this stuff and show you how the devil will fight you to the realm of your spirit by using your memory, your own imagination. How many of you have ever had an issue in your life and you only imagined it? It wasn't really there, but you imagined it. And so your imagination made it so real that it hindered you. &gt;&gt; If you think people don't like you, &gt;&gt; and they really do like you, but you imagine they don't. Nobody can tell you different. They don't like me. Nobody shakes my hand. I leave right after church and nobody stops me. Well, it's cuz you're the first one to the car. You're the first one to hit the door. The Bible says if you want to have friends, &gt;&gt; show yourself friendly, &gt;&gt; right? If you want fellowship, all of you understand this. There is never a perfect church. &gt;&gt; There's never a perfect No. And if you do find a perfect church, when you move there, it's now imperfect because you're going to find the imperfection there also. &gt;&gt; If you want fellowship, create it. &gt;&gt; Invite people to your home. Don't wait to be invited. Invite others. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this morning. Anyway, uh so I have a couple other graphs. Do we have all three of them? Did we print all three? &gt;&gt; Okay, the other two are this. I'm going to show you how man's a triune being, body, spirit, soul. Showing you how one's inside of the other. Then we're going to go into the thing where brother Bram says, "Well, you say you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm saved." Said that that don't mean nothing. Well, he when you understand his teaching, it's because Pentecost says, "I spoke with tongues. Therefore, I know I got the Holy Ghost." He said, "No, tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost." He said, "It talks about it's only the anointing on your spirit." &gt;&gt; And then we'll look at the gifts of the spirit, activating gifts of the spirit. And you can have the Holy Spirit on your spirit and your soul. the control room, the devil's still sitting there. &gt;&gt; But when God comes in and he kills that old first nature and changes you and now he sits on your throne room, now he's in the control tower. &gt;&gt; Does that mean that you don't have issues and there are things in your life and you're going to walk perfect from them on? No. No, of course not. You're going to have trials, tribulations, but you got to keep sanctifying your life. Amen. Come on, somebody. That's true. We need to sanctifi. We need to take a good look at ourselves. &gt;&gt; And fathers, do not chasen thy son if thou doest the same. Take care of your self first. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't try to if you see somebody drowning and floundering and having a hard time, don't try to save somebody drowning if you don't know how to swim. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you've ever tried to save somebody that's drowning and you don't know water safety rules and everything like that, they're going to drown you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So again, this just kind of a teaching lesson. I didn't really preach. It kind of went slowly and uh I did that for a purpose. But we're going to get into this these areas and we're going to be talking about possessing the gate of your enemy. And we're going to bring it down home and show you possess your gate of your imagination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of your conscience, &gt;&gt; of your affection, of your reasoning. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I might live a life &gt;&gt; that is pleasing to you. And the only way you can do it, Lord, is change my heart. Thy word, oh Lord, have I hid in my heart that I learn not to sin against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh, [Music] &gt;&gt; make it ever true. Change my heart, oh God. May I be like you &gt;&gt; for you are the partner. [Music] I am the mold me and me. And this is what I pray. &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God. Make it ever true. Change my heart, oh God. May I be my You are the potter. I am the clay and you are the potter. I am the flame. [Music] Hold me and make me. This is what I change my heart. Change my heart. Oh God. God make it ever true. Change my heart. Oh God. [Music] May I be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we bow our heads for a word of prayer or dismissal? Heavenly Father, we love you today. We ask you to lead us, guide us, inspire us, direct our footsteps, Lord. Prepare our hearts for communion service tonight at 5:00. Go with us. Begin our afternoon today. We love you and we worship you. We need you in all things that we do and say. In your name we pray, everyone said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the service at 5 tonight. As we go this morning, in moments like these, I sing out. Sing it as you go this morning. I sing out a love song to Jesus. In moments like these, I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you. The Lord singing I love him. Singing I love you, Lord. Singing I love you, Lord. Singing I love you. Oh, [Music] God bless you. Remember service 5:00 tonight for communion. God bless you.
