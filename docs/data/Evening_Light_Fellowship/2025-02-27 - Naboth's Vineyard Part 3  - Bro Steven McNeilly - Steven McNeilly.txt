together father Lord we are here this evening on a Wednesday night midweek service and Lord we haven't come just to play church this evening but we have come Lord to hear and learn of you father and I ask this evening that you would just bless each and every person that is here that has made the effort to come father God not to hear of a man but to hear from you Lord bless your people tonight we pray bless the ministering of the word Lord speak to our hearts like only you can father and we'll give you the honor and all the glory for it only belongs Onto You In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen and amen amen amen thank you musicians God bless you God bless you excuse me this evening is certainly good to be in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles turn with me to the book of Isaiah chapter 5 and we'll read verses 5 through 7 we just want to make you all welcome this evening and uh we got I got a little um little thought upon my heart and uh if I'm being quite honest with you it it seems like it would be more of a uh youth meeting service so um the Lord knows and the Lord knows whenever he takes you in a certain direction uh though it's even if if it's deeper if it's simple uh we trust the leading of the Lord so we trust that this will be for someone tonight Isaiah chapter 5 and verse vers 1 through 7 I have a lot of rebound back here Brothers I don't know if we can touch that up a little bit that would be great thank you very much verse one says now I will sing to my beloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard my well beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful Hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a wine press therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes wow so we see here this this husbandman he went through uh he he went to great great depths and and did a lot of things to make this Vineyard uh a very good and and and beautiful Vineyard he he fenced it and he did everything he could to it in order for it to bring forth uh good fruit but what did it bring forth it brought forth a wild grapes instead of regular grapes grapes and now inhabitants of Jerusalem and Men of Judah judge I pray you between me and my Vineyard what could have been done more to my Vineyard than I have not done in it wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now go to I tell you what I will do to my Vineyard I will take away the Hedge thereof and I will and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trotten down and I will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come briers and Thorns I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel and the man of Judah his Pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but Behold a cry amen you may be seated this evening we trust that the Lord will add the blessing to the reading of the word amen I would like to title my sermon tonight this is uh part three of nebba's Vineyard and I would like to take for a subject of the husband of the vine the husbandman of the vine now the first time that uh a Vineyard is mentioned within the scripture is found in Genesis 19: 20- 27 and it says and Noah began to be a husbandman and he planted a Vineyard now if you want to know what a husbandman is is just a farmer it is a man who tills the ground who wants to bring forth who plants something and wants to bring forth a crop or a fruit and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two Brethren without and Sham and japeth took a garment and laid it upon their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness now Noah woke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him and he said cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his Brethren and he said blessed be the Lord God of Shem and Canan shall be his servant God shall enlarge japeth and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem and Canaan shall be his servant so whenever you read this scripture you wonder to yourself well I wonder what was the the character of ham what was uh how did he approach his brothers whenever he had walked in and he had seen his dad in this the drunken state that he was in uh was his immediate reaction trying to say well uh this is kind of embarrassing I I I I need to step out a second or I need to cover my father's nakedness because he's been drunken with wine and and he's not in his right mind and and and this is kind of embarrassing for the whole family but instead of helping his dad in a time of need uh the character of ham really started to shine through when he went to his brothers and no doubt he went to his Brethren and he began to laugh and he began to Snicker because understand that's what the seed of the serpent does they laugh and they Snicker and they make fun of the seed of God so no doubt he went and he told his two brothers and he said hey watch Dad Dad is drunken with wine and he he's laying in the tent and he's uncovered go and check this out this is so embarrassing for Dad but the two brothers of of the two other brothers they they realized the seriousness because they had a respect for their father that's something that a lot of us uh need to be reminded once in a while is respect for our mother and for our fathers especially the older we get you know uh it's very easy to to lose respect for Mom and Dad but it's important for us to keep respect for our mom and dad because it is a commandment of the Lord to respect your mother mother and your father amen it doesn't have an age category on it it doesn't mean whenever you get older andever you have your own family and you have your own children that now you have the opportunity to disrespect mom and disrespect Dad no the Bible tells us age doesn't matter respect Mom and Dad amen and so we see that this attitude of of ham now was was starting to to to show forth of the lineage of where he came from because we know that the lineage of Cain came through ham in the ark now are some of you ready for some Christianity 101 amen say Amen okay here we go here's our youth meeting tonight because we understand that as Christians we are not to partake of strong drink alcohol or liquor and let me put in there also wine you say how can you say that brother stepen well the scripture declares it have you ever been uh have you ever been asked you know why don't you drink why don't you smoke everybody else does why don't you do it have you ever been stumped and you wonder well I just do it because uh mom and dad said so or because the preacher said so and you don't have a scripture to back up why you don't do these simple things that the rest of the world does and we don't do it as Christians well here's your scriptures tonight Proverbs chap 20 and verse one it says wine is a mocker strong drink is Raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise so in other words if you're deceived by strong drink if you are mocked by by uh if you're mocked by by by by wine and the drung drink guess what you are not wise you are a foolish person whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise so what do we learn from liquor and strong drink and taking wine in abundance we learn that it is a deception and it deceives the foolish into thinking that it's okay even as Believers so you might say well this is just for denominational Christians and and denominational Christians uh they believe in having a a social drink around a social Gathering but I think would we we would be very amazed to see the people within the message who are into social drinking who are deceived within themselves and are not WI eyes because they have given themselves over to strong drink Isaiah 5:1 woe unto them that rise early in the morning that they may follow strong drink in other words watch out for that person the person that wakes up early in the morning and they're they're chasing after a drink to drown their sorrows or to make the pain go away watch out for that person earmark that person stay away from that person why that continue in the night till wi and Flame him Proverbs 31: 4-5 it is not for Kings o Lemuel it is not for Kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink let me put Believers in there because you are all Kings and you are priests onto the Lord so it is not onto thee Oh mess believer to drink of wine and strong drink what is the purpose why lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the Judgment of any of The Afflicted why because when a person is stim is under the influence of this strong drink and liquor and alcohol and whatever it may be you know it's not mentioned within the scripture but let me put it in there let me put in there medical marijuana Amen Let me put in there anything else anything else that that takes our uh uh our senses away from us whether it be medical marijuana me whether it be marijuana in itself whether it be medications prescribed from a doctor or whoever it may be if it takes away and it dos our senses there's something wrong you know we don't need pills to heal us of our infirmities we need the blood of Jesus Christ but if you have to take something once in a while please feel free Hallelujah but saints of God understand this as it just comes to my heart you know so much of the time we're in a hurry to run to the doctor so much of the time we're in a hurry to go to urgent care we're in a hurry to go over here we're in a hurry for a prescription because we want the prescription to make us feel better but what if we would just stop hurrying to the hospital hurrying to the doctors and hurry to Dr Jesus we might get a prescription that'll heal us right on the spot but a lot of the times we're not giving him his our first choice amen we're so quickly to go I got to go to the doctor I got to go hey if we got to go we got to go but if it's not life and death how about you give Jesus a chance Hallelujah you know the fault that I have especially with the kids you know my kids my kids have to be extremely sick in order for me to take them in like there will be times I'll I'll tell ashin ashy let's just wait let's just give the Lord a day and we'll pray okay let's just wait a little longer and all of a sudden this gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse and she's saying honey maybe we should take the child in I say okay you know brother brandom did the same thing with sister ma whenever she had that big old tumor or whatever it was he said oh doc just let's just just give the Lord a chance and and he kept postponing it and postponing it postponing it until finally they went in to do the uh uh the examination and they went in to to to take that thing out and all of a sudden it wasn't there wonder how many of us do we have faith enough to postpone things to give God a chance to heal our bodies God help us I said God give us a little bit more faith you say brother Stephen you're kind of walking out on a limb here and telling people not to go to the doctors that's not what I'm saying understand what I'm saying I'm saying give Jesus first and give him the opportunity to heal our ailments amen said uh verse five of Proverbs lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the Judgment of any of The Afflicted what happens when we drink and we forget the law we become fools we foret for get the law of God we forget the teachings of the Lord and all of a sudden we afflict we we we pervert the Judgment of God upon The Afflicted Proverbs 23: 19 through 22 hear thou my son listen to this and be wise don't be foolish but be wise and guide thine heart in thee way be not among wine bibbers among riotous Eaters of Flesh for the drunkard and the Glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with Rags hearken onto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she is old Hallelujah why does it tell us not to be around why bibbers why does it tell us not to be among the riest Eaters of the flesh I'll tell you why because it's easier to pull somebody down from a chair than it is to pull somebody up whenever you hang around the wrong crowd whenever we get around the the crowd of the wine bibbers guess what we're going to want to become wine bibbers why because we are we are attaching ourselves with that spirit and now we think hey well this is what everybody else is doing so I'll just do the same thing don't be a fool don't be foolish but be wise and stay away from that kind of company say brother Stephen that's just for the Youth oh I'm sure it's for a lot of older people too you got to watch your company you got to watch who you're hanging around with you got to watch the guys at work yeah you think you're just uh because you're old that you have all this wisdom and and you can just hang around and go wherever you want to go to that's not how how it works A little leaven leavens the whole lump God help us I told you it was a little youth meeting tonight so all the adults you can say Amen with me but if it hurts you can just stay quiet because you know it's the truth put your toes in your shoes like this huh a lot of you are getting a calf workout right now CU you're ah this guy I'm not not preaching at you I'm preaching for you I'm preaching at the Devil I'm preaching to remind you to put you in a a little bit of remembrance of of the company that you're keeping and stay away from from alcohol and drink and cigarettes and smoke and marijuana and the things that dulls our senses because that's what Satan wants to do to us in this age of Lady OA he wants to dull our senses to the voice of God in this day true so you might say that uh it's the Bible says that it's it's okay for me to take a little bit of wine because the Bible says it's it's okay for thy stomach sake and thy often infirmities I wonder how many people have been Have Become consumed by Wine and Liquor because they start off with a little bit of wine for there often infirmities in their stomach I wonder how many people has it set off on the wrong track and it's taken them off the straight and narrow way and and it may not have happened overnight but over a couple of years and before they know it they have a fullon addiction to to to all these things that we've already mentioned why because they started off with a little bit of wine but you don't understand brother it's for my stomach it's to help me feel better well if you would just take a a natural remedy of something that'll clean out your stomach once in a while it might make the infirmities in your stomach feel a little bit better you don't have to take wine for those things right I believe that it's important for us we're going to be taking communion here in a couple of weeks imagine and and just just just imagination right imagine you take a glass of wine a night for the stomach sake and then you come up before communion and it doesn't mean anything to you it's is wine I already drink it every night just a glass it's it doesn't really do anything for me it takes away the sincerity of the Holy Communion that God Has are has given us to do amen that's just wine not a big deal but try taking that little shot of wine did you all taste the wine this last time stuff is strong it's good stuff my daughter Mariah was her first time taking communion and they had changed the wine and and everything and and she took a little sip of that thing and my my her eyes just began to turn you can feel it there's a real stimulation that comes from it a real stimulation within your mind and in your body and and you think m my goodness God thank you so much for the blood of Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord told Brother brandham not to smoke drink or defile your body in any way and I believe that the counsel that the angel that was sent from God give brother brandham is very good for you and I today don't drink don't smoke smoke don't defile your body in any way let me say this don't defile your mind in any way by looking at things you shouldn't be looking at on the internet don't defile your hearing in any way by listening to music we should not be listening to Don't defile your spirit in any way by going to places and hanging out with people and wine Biers that we shouldn't be hanging out with amen don't defile yourself in any way good but keep yourself clean keep yourself holy keep yourself Sanctified keep your mind on the things of God keep your heart uh set on things above because where your Treasures are there will your heart be also so if you set your heart on things above your your Treasures are going to be on things above God help us God help us to shake out of a a laxad daisy lukewarm ladyo see in spirit and get on fire with God because when you're on fire with God when you're tempted by these things you'll say Satan I've heard that voice before I've been through that Temptation before and I'm saying no in the name of Jesus Christ yes did you know that your spirit can be defiled by how you talk to one another that was good your spirit can be defiled how you speak with one another how you act towards your wife can defile her spirit and it'll defile your own very Spirit how you talk to your wife and to your husband do you understand that if you do it in a wrong way that your prayers will be hindered sister ma slammed the door on brother Bram she had it she had it up to he she was sick and tired of of of taking care of the kids when he wasn't there and she said hey why don't you get on Joseph he needs a weaping he wouldn't do it oh she just had enough slamed the door he goes I poor little fell she didn't mean to do that I she's she's stup stood before me in the public her her her hair is going gray and and here she is there's people always coming to the house and and there's always something happening and she never gets to see me and here here on her on their honeymoon he took her on a hunting trip and and so on and so forth perhaps uh brother brandham at times wasn't the best loving husband to his wife because he was so busy serving the people of of this generation and she just had enough and she couldn't take any more of it and she overreacts and she slams the door on him and God gives him a scripture and he goes oh my and he went and he knocks on the door he says oh mey mey open the door and she wouldn't open the door to him and and everything and he says no I have a word from the lord well now it got real serious real serious something began to form within here why I can say this because God wanted to fulfill his word in her life through a a a a spoken word miracle but also because of this why did it happen it was a lesson for every one of us both husbands and wives and young people am that are reaction to one another to our husbands and wives and moms and dads it has an effect on our spirit it has an effect on our lives and not for the betterment very good you ever see somebody and you ever see somebody that didn't have a good upbringing as a child and they're an adult and you can tell on their Spirit their spirit is still affected maybe they hide it in the flesh they they they can't see it yet you can't see it and you don't notice it but yet within their Spirit their spirit is marked their Spirit has been defiled because they weren't treated the right way and because their spirit is defiled it affects their walk with God my brother my sister may God help us to talk to each other appropriately Amen to talk to each other with love and respect first of all within our families within our own household and then within the Church of the Living God treat each other right look out for each other feel like I'm talking to my my children at home we ought to take care of one another amen you know what mcnees do you know what I tell my boys you know what mcnees do mcnees take care of mcnees at school they pick on one McNeely they got two other boys to deal with you know what I tell him the one that's at school and he thinks he's a bully you bully the bully stand up to him stand up for yourself and you'll have the other boys backing you maybe I'm wrong in that but I'm teaching my boys loyalty to one another yes teaching my boys and my daughters loyalty to their family we ought to be loyal one to another amen as the family of God that's right we ought to be loyal one to another not just when somebody is loyal to us but when they turn their backs on us we ought to still try to be loyal with them and re why because if we believe they're a part of the family of God their family amen that's true got to stick up for one another you ought to love one another you ought to learn to enjoy one another's company why because we're family amen hallelujah don't let your spirit be defiled by overreacting don't let your prayers be hindered to God because of how you're talking one to another very good Hallelujah but soften amen soften your spirit with prayer you know this is none of this just so you know is I didn't even think about any of this stuff but I'm just preaching you know what how you speak to a boy is different than how you speak to your girls you know I speak to my boys got stop it knock it off what are you doing son get up you know you're a little bit more harsh with the boys than you are with the girls so the other day little Heidi came in and she did something and I thought it was one of the boys what are you doing and she looks at me and my goodness her little face she's so cute you know her little face I looked at her and I thought honey I said I am so sorry it absolutely melted my heart to see the reaction on her little three-year old face that Daddy just talked to her with kind of a mean voice and I was quick to apologize to my little three-year-old daughter why cuz I don't want to harm her little spirit amen I don't want her thinking that dad is just some mean guy that's that that's always shouting and always doing stuff and always you know uh getting on my case and everything and I'm all about correction believe me and so is my wife but I'm all about showing the love and the grace because there's a balance amen there's a balance with the strictness there's a balance with the hardness and it should be balanced with love and with Grace amen saints of God we ought to give each other room to fail you need to give your children you young couples I don't know where you're at you need to give your children space to fail because if they feel like they can never fail they'll always feel like a failure and never be able to pick themselves up when they fall down but when you give them space to fail they realize I have this room here I can get back up I can go to Mom I can go to Dad so it is within the church amen we need to give each other a little bit of space to fail a little bit of space to fall down that we know hey we failed but it's not the end of the world we failed but not everybody is against me I have room I can get back up I can go to my pastor I can go to the Deacon I can ask for counsel and I can ask for help and I won't have the finger being pointed at me very good hallelujah it's okay to fail but keep getting back up amen it's okay to do something wrong once in a while just don't be foolish and do it again get back up put it under under the blood and walk on Amen we find that Noah had Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord because uh not only did he recognize the voice of God when it spoke to him but he he recognized it and had put him into action into building the ark because remember the Bible says that Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord and he found Grace because he was able to not only hear the voice and the word of God that was that would put him into action and build the ark but he found Grace that he had a heart to be able to receive the message by the voice of God each and every one of us here this evening we have found Grace in the very eyes of God himself why because I've heard his voice not only have I heard his voice I have a heart to receive what that voice said and to put what that voice said into action thank you Lord talk about Grace what did the voice say it said come out be separate come out over my people come out of the things of the world come out of those denominations and be separated be a separated people not onto yourselves but onto me because when God has us in a place of Separation now he wants to dress us with his word thank you why does he want to dress us with his word because when he returns his word is the only thing that he's going to be able to recognize and when he recognizes his word that's who's going to go with them because we are a part of the word praise the Lord be encouraged my brother and my sister because this is not our final resting place Jesus said go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also he said in my father's house are many mansions and if I go I will come back again and receive you to myself that's what we're waiting for this evening that's why we're here at our post of Duty why because we're watching and we're waiting for the soon coming of the Lord I say father even so come quickly amen so the vineyard of the Lord is Israel like we read in our open scripture but we are fully aware that the Gentiles have been grafted into the original Olive Tree which is Christ turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Romans chapter 11 Romans 11: 13- 2 says for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh I might save some of them for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first fruit be holy who is the first fruit is Israel the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off verse 17 and thou being a wild Olive Tree are grafted in among them and with them partak of the root and fatness of the Olive Tree boast not against the branches amen but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee so in other words don't be boasting against the Jews or don't be boasting against denominations because you don't believe that they're not uh h a part of this this this olive tree not they've been a branch that has been cut off from this uh Olive Tree don't boast against them don't say all manner of evil against them don't let a root of bitterness rise in your heart against them because brother brandham said this he said I called them Ricky and rickettes and the Lord came and spoke to him and said I still have seed within there amen so if we have a a a a root of bitter Bess or something in our heart just because somebody belongs to a denominational Church chances are you'll never win them over but be salty because ye the salt of the earth boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou wil say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high minded but fear amen for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee so when we read the scripture he's telling us don't be highminded within yourself don't become a stuffed shirt because it's very easily it could happen that you could be as one of those for if thou were cut out of the olve tree which is wilded by nature and were grafted contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree for I would not Brethren that ye be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become come in we understand that on the day of Pentecost the Gentiles were grafted into this good Olive Tree because of the rejection of the Jews rejecting the Messiah that that God had sent them and I like how Paul puts this he says uh he he really uh put them in their place didn't he he says don't be high minded and thinking you're someone but rather fear it's amazing how quickly it is some of us within the message we can turn on a person who is struggling within the church or within the message it's it's amazing how quickly if somebody gets up and they leaves that how quickly we turn against those people as if they're some kind of enemy yeah we see them on the road and we cross the other way you see them and you cuz you don't want to talk to them you don't want to look at them because they don't go to church anymore because they don't believe the same as what you believe anymore how quickly we turn to we turn to quotes and scriptures and we say well praise God they they they went from us because they weren't of us I always knew that they were the seed of the serpent I always knew that person was never a seed of God we get so highminded and lifted up in our own pride and within our own mind and we become a stub shirt Paul says don't be high minded but fear fear lest the same thing come upon you the same struggle comes upon you as what Came Upon that person amen but we're just so quick to judge aren't we we're so quick to throw stones it's not good for us to throw stones when we live in green houses why because our house will be smashed up to bits in no time amen I have learned I have learned this and that's Never Say Never Never Say Never about anything in my own life because chances are that never is going to happen but also never say never about other people never say never that someone is too far gone never say that someone has passed the line of Grace especially if they've kept their mouths of the message I will say this there are people that have left and they have sewn Discord and they have got websites and they have got podcasts and they have done everything that they can do to try and tear down and discriminate and to absolutely ruin this message are they past the line of Grace certainly seems like it because they don't even want to change they don't even want to turn back if someone has a little inkling within their heart that they want to go back to church never doubt that person out amen don't leave them out don't build a wall between you and them but be there when they need it the most it doesn't mean that we have to sympathize with the sin it doesn't mean that we have to Pat him on the back and say uh wishy-washy and tell them it's going to be okay and just love them no we can tell them the truth but don't build walls between us and between them make sure that they know when it's time to come back that you're there with open arms and saying welcome back to the house of the Lord amen help us Lord yes sir help us Lord Lord help us to have the right attitude help us Lord to have the right spirit because if we have the right Spirit brother brandham said this he said I would rather have a person with the right Spirit than the right Doctrine because a person with the right spirit is teachable amen some of you are saying man you don't know my family members and you're right I don't but you know what those family members are teaching you patience you know what those family members are teaching you longsuffering you know what those family members are teaching you gentleness huh shall we go on through the seven steps of the Statue of a perfect man there's just some family members are very good at bringing those things out of us in our lives whether we like it or not but don't cast them out amen I say father help us now we understand that there's been many grafted in vines into this good olive tree that have been grafted in by man and not by God they're called Baptists they're called Pentecostals whatever denominational name you want to give them that've been grafted in by the by by by the leadership of man rather than the leadership of God and what does God do whenever they're drafted in and and they become a grafted in and they become a an organization he as a good husbandman he he looks at the tree and he looks at the fruit that's upon the tree and he says Ah that's the wrong kind of fruit that's growing upon this tree therefore I'm going to prune it I'm going to purge it I'm going to cut it off I'm going to take it off of this tree because it's living off of the original life but it's producing the wrong kind of fruit there's been many branches that's been grafted in to what we call the message of the hour and you say brother Stephen how do we know how do we how do we know if it's been grafted in by man and and and everything look at the fruits that the word produces give them the word cast and if it's not according to the word it's a grafted in man-made denomination Hallelujah and what does God do with it it doesn't belong there why because it's been taken over like brother Ron's been preaching about by the leadership of Man by man's intellects by the understanding of man well he said this but I believe he meant this this is what he told me in person and before you know it we have all these grafted in branches living off of the original life I say father give us understanding give us discernment to be able to discern what is the word and what's not the word hallelujah that's why this this this this Vision that brother brandham had of uh of of when he crossed the the the curtain of time it's so very important to us as as Believers because uh we realize this that the original church and the church at the end time is going to be saying the exact same thing the seed that that was first planted in in Ephesus is the same seed that comes forth in leoa and so we understand that uh what was in the beginning the Alpha and the Omega will unite and it'll be the same word it won't be a different word and so whenever we uh uh whenever we see of this hear of this vision of brother brandham and he's talking about um going past the curtain of time and and he says my all those people over there and the angel talks to him and says uh uh you're going to be judged according to the word that you've preached and he said well is Paul going to be judged according to what he preached and the angel says yes he'll be judged and brother Bram says well praise God because I preach the exact same word the exact same message of what Paul preached it's the same word as it was in Ephesus as it is here today it is the same word that that would began at Pentecost will be saying the same thing in this day there will not be any deviations of it right but the true bride of Christ we'll be saying what brother brandham said and they'll be saying what the Bible says of what the Apostle Paul said so we see that uh not only are you a a a part of the vineyard in type because we realize there was this Vineyard and he's talking about Israel being the vineyard but also that we are a part of this Vineyard we've been grafted into this Vineyard not also are you a a a a a tree but you're also a husbandman or a laborer in the vineyard of the Lord and we realize that this this life of or this process of making uh making wine it represents the life of the believer so not only are you a a Vineyard and are you you've been planted as a Vineyard and you're going to bring forth fruit but also you are a husbandman you're a a laborer in the vineyard of the Lord and and a laborer has something to do within the vineyard a husbandman has a has a work that he must do and taking care of the vineyard of the Lord it is up to the husbandman to take care of his Vineyard so in other words it is up to you to take care care of your Vineyard because you are a part of a Vineyard your body is a Vineyard it is bringing forth fruit and so as a laborer in your own Vineyard so to speak it is up to you to to labor and to take care of this Vineyard or of this vessel proverbs 24: 30 through 34 I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and Nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction yet a little Slumber a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall they poverty come as one that travelleth and they want as an armed man every one of us have a Vineyard in our lives that we must take care of we actually have two Vineyards we have a spiritual Vineyard and we have a natural Vineyard and the spiritual Vineyard I put it as number one because natural things come second now the job of the the husband men is to do this is to make sure that the The Vineyard is properly taken care of by maintaining the soil taking debris and loose twigs and and leaves away from the bottom of the tree the most important job of a husbandman and a Vineyard is pruning the trees it's taking care of the tree it's taking care of the debris and the leaves and the stuff that that that the wind and the conditions of this world would would blow against the tree to prevent it from reaching its full potential it's the husbands man's job to go and to dig around it and to water it and and if there's a a branch that doesn't belong there or a certain something that comes up in one of the branches it's up to the husband been now to look at the branch and to look at the the vine and to say this doesn't belong here if this Branch continues growing it's going to ruin the rest of the crop so I must cut it I the the husbandman has to spay has to uh spend special attention to his Vine and to his trees that he's in charge of because one thing that's very natural for a um for a Vine and for a for a a a grape tree per se is that it grows wild extremely quickly amen it gets out of hand real quick and so there's all kinds of branches and all kinds of things that begin to grow and if if those things aren't taken care of it's going to Hinder the growth and the production of the fruit at the Harvest Time right understand that everything that the husbandman does to the tree is for its own good you think people think well why uh why would you just cut that Branch off and why would you do this and and and and why would you do that because it's for the betterment of the tree some people think well why does the preacher why is he preaching so harshly why is he speaking so harshly because he's a husbandman and he has a vision of the tree and he wants it to bring forth much fruit and when the husbandman gets under the inspiration of God God's one purpose that he wants out of your life is this is that you might produce fruit and he does what he has to do in our lives in order for us to bring forth a h hundredfold within our lives thank you Lord there might be times in our lives and circumstances happen that we don't like it's uncomfortable it hurts for a period of time but understand when God is pruning our tree it's for our own betterment because he wants us to grow in the right shape in the right way and to bring forth much fruit like I already said Vines naturally grow in a disorder orderly fashion and it needs to be pruned to help its structure to control its growth and ensure the production of quality fruit what are we doing here tonight we're being pruned God is taking things in our lives and he's saying this don't belong here and he's snipping it off he's taking things over here and he's cutting it off and and sometimes it can be very harsh but sometimes harshness is needed amen it seems uncomfortable it's it it it it hurts it's not easy for the Lord to speak to our hearts about Sin in our lives but let me say this it's worth it let me say this if God convicts you of sin in your life God loves you if your friend tells you truth in your life it's because he loves you if your mom and dad tell you truth it's because they love you Hallelujah Proverbs 29:15 says the rod and reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame it is natural for us to grow disorderly even as adults and so we need to be pruned by the word of God the printing process is the most important part of having a Vineyard if you want to have a great Vine find the work in the field is what makes the end product it's the work behind the scenes it's the work leading up to the Harvest is what produces the right kind of fruit but we read in our scripture there and it said uh and it said here's a man void of understanding void talking about his fig chucking about his Vineyard and lo it was all grown over with thorns and Nettles had it covered the face of it the stone wall thereof was broken down what did he learn from it the man himself wasn't working in his own Vineyard because there are times where the preaching of the word will go forth and God will speak to our hearts and and and and the Lord of harvest the the great husbandman will come and he'll prune branches off of our lives and and he'll come and he'll shave us down a little bit and he'll work something in our lives but there's other times s that God expects you as a husbandman over your own life to prune your own tree there's things in our lives that God will not take away from us but he says you are a husbandman of the vineyard you need to work on your own Vine am you need to take the Cutters and you need to go to pruning the things that I am not going to take from you you but you need to give to me yourself brother brandham says this in the Statue of a perfect man you remember the bride tree you remember the sermon on the bride tree they eat it down he he pruned it they got denominational branches he pruned them off they raised up in another church denominational branches he pruned it off but the heart of that tree kept growing and in and in the evening time it shall be light see that's when when comes Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church then and he will resurrect this church being his own body in there is the body and the way God is expecting us as an individual to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow every Church age it becomes one big church see so he says there the way God is expecting us as an individual to grow is the way he has brought his church in to grow so what does God do to us he prunes us there's things arise in our lives from when we're little bitty kids until we're we're aged adults and as it arises he comes and the word Goes Forth and he prunes it and the word Goes Forth and he prunes it and then finally he gets to a place and he says no this certain instance in your life this thing that you've been dealing with with all these years I'm not going to take it away from you you need to give it to me as the musicians come tonight I bring this to a close I wonder what it is in our lives that that God is expecting you to prune as the m Master Vineyard of your the master the husbandman of your own Vineyard I wonder what it is in our lives that that holds us back from God I wonder what it is that trips us up so often and we can speak from both y to both young people middle-aged people and old people alike because guess what like brother Steve coffee says we're people we got people problems amen but there's certain things my brother and my sister and I don't need to go through a list but there's certain things in our life that you know that hey this has been a branch that's been veering off for a very long time and and it's really beginning to grow other branches and I've ignored it for years and and I thought it it it really doesn't affect me but it's affecting me it's affecting my spiritual growth it's it's affecting the fruit upon my tree and I know that if I I just don't want to go on like this any longer in dealing with this same issue the same issue within my flesh this issue within my mind this issue within my heart there's certain things that God isn't going to prune off of your tree but he wants you to do the pruning thank you he wants you to take a look inside your own heart and say this is really holding me back it's really affecting me oh sure we can come up with all kind of excuses and we can say well it's because of this and because of that and you know H I'll use an excuse I was an only child I was an only child as a kid so therefore it's it's just natur natural for me to be how I am it's natural for me to uh to be selfish selfish sometimes I'll come home early or whatever and don't tell the wife and where I could have went and got the kids from school cuz I just want to get home selfish selfish so I called Ashlin the other day said babe I'm on my way home I'm calling cuz I can pick up the kids say I'm selfish I'm not being selfish today cuz I'm an only child no CU you can be selfish sometimes that's why amen what is it it's a branch doesn't belong there it's got to be pruned so now I make a I make a a decision an act of decision that if I'm thinking about myself sometimes and going home or whatever no no I'm want to think about my wife I'm going to think how can I betterment her how can I do something that's going to help her not be so selfish what are you no doubt there's no selfish people [Music] here but what is it in your life we all got something we all got something in here not everything manifests itself outwardly right but if you got an outwardly thing that you're struggling with tonight's your night to prune it off tonight's your night to take the saw and to take the little uh little Cutters there and go to cutting on that thing and saying you know what I've dealt with this for long enough I'm sick and tired of it and I'm going to cut it off and I'm going to take it and I'm going to I'm going to lay it at the feet of the Lord and he can do what he wants with it he can bundle it and he can burn it but most of us it's all inward stuff what's your thing what's your stick what's your branch that's hindering your walk with your wife that's hindering your walk with your husband what's your branch that's hindering your walk with your mom and dad what is it that just keeps getting in the way that you know you need to take care of tonight in your own way is is your night to think about it and to be honest with yourself and to say Here I Am Lord in very my vulnerabilities um here I am you know it's really hard to admit when you're wrong you know how hard it is to say that you can be selfish sometimes [Music] s but you got to be honest with yourself because when you're honest with yourself you realize there's something here and I need to deal with it so here I go let's stand [Music] together yeah what's your branch in your tree think about it be honest with yourself say yeah here's a branch cheer and it's been hindering me my whole life it's been stunting my growth I I I I haven't been bringing I haven't been bringing forth fruit like I should be bringing forth and I know it and I know it's because of this and well if you know it and you know it tonight you know that you need to take care of it let's pray together father a very simple sermon and perhaps Parts Lord I tripped over my words and really didn't make any sense Lord but father I believe that there's a reason that you that you put this on my heart and that it went in this direction and so Lord I'm just trusting in you and I'm trusting in the gift and Lord I'm trusting that this sermon will bring forth fruit Lord help us father God that Lord that we would pay attention to our tree as good husband men that we would go and Lord very gently and delic delicately Lord go to cutting off branches that don't belong there because father you know I I read today Lord that it said you just can't uh hack and cut at a at a at a at a Vine and at a and at a grape tree but it's got to be done the right way otherwise you'll damage the tree and the healing process would could take years and affect the outcome of the tree so father may you help us to be kind of delicate one with another Lord as as husbands and heads of our homes Lord not to get the Cutters out and to go crazy on everybody else's tree but father that we would just do it to ourselves first and I'm sure we would find that the rest within our home would follow soon bless your people tonight I pray Lord we commit this service and these people and all these hearts and souls into thy hands
