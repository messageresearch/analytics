that you would come down now amongst us yes speak to our hearts God as only you can Hallelujah father we're just waiting and under great anticipation we're under expectation Lord because we know that where two or more are gathered there will I be in their midst amen father I thank you for that I pray that you will be with with each and everyone this morning and thy servant Lord as I have waited before you and you have given me a thought but father we need you to come and blow the trumpet Lord father that it would give a certain sound that we would know what to do yes and father I thank you and I praise you and I love you with all my heart come now and anoint our eyes of understanding in Jesus Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you let's just remain standing turn with me if you would to Matthew chapter 18 amen we greet you all this morning in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's thank you musicians and certainly enjoyed the song specials always a blessing amen and um I've been studying quite a a bit lately on the theophanies I wonder if we fully understand what this message is all about come on brother that's truth right amen do we really understand what God has done in this hour not only what he's done but what he's doing amen we dn't just make it a bunch of Creeds and dogmas and rules and regulations but may it be a life and that life should be the Life of Christ himself and I've done some study here on theophanies actually you type it in and you you'll type in theophany or theophanes you'll have 85 different quotes and it's just amazing to me to see what brother Brenham says about theophanies and remember that when you leave here and you go somewhere else than you when this Tabernacle be dissolved yes you have another one that's waiting amen it's waiting for you brother Bram says and down Through the Ages he said this theophany it will be speaking to you and he said sometimes Revelation it'll be things coming to you and he said you're actually hearing from your theophany hallelujah amen so I want to go in this direction I've got an awful lot this morning I don't know how far I'm going to go so I want to relax my spirit and say okay let's take it slowly let's look into this and let's just have a a jubilee time this morning and a Revival of seeing what God is doing in this hour amen Matthew 18: 10-14 and then we'll go to Hebrews 1 amen so good to have so many out to the house of the Lord many are gone this morning some are TR traveling uh my wife has left me she went up to presc her and my daughter Rebecca that's why it was a little bit late this morning uh I had to get out my own suit had to get out my own shirt and tie and and everything had to make my own coffee I called her up she says oh you poor thing yeah so anyway she told me what color suit and what color tie so she helped me out that way anyway praise the Lord Matthew chapter 18 may we ask God now to come and bless his word amen let it become an open book come on let it be a re revealed book that you might see yourself see a reflection Lord let me see something I've never seen before let me see the picture within the picture Matthew 18 verse 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven notice their Angels these little ones do always yes now watch this that means continually behold the face of My Father which is in heaven for the son of man has come to save that which was lost how think ye if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray do he not leave the 90 and n and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray and if so be that he find it verily I say unto you he rejoices more over over that sheep then of the 90 and N which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that any of these little ones should perish that's right amen amen Hebrews 1 if you would Hebrews 1: 10 through 14 and thou Lord in the beginning H has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thy hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture Thou shalt fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make my thine enemies thy foot stol are not all these ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I say amen and amen what a privileged people we are yes that God has seen fit to open our eyes of understanding of what he's done in this hour Amen to recognize your day in its message thank you Lord now it's far more than the way we dress it's far more than the way we go to church amen I would like to title my sermon this morning and I'm probably going to use this as a platform to launch out into um something perhaps in the next week or two so it's just been brewing on the back burner so to speak now for a few months and I've been praying about it seeking it and the Lord the other day just spoke to my heart in fact quickened it to me so quickly he said go into your room and write this down amen and I was really quickened immediately to go in because I don't want to forget that thought and we as human beings can tend to forget and if we don't write it down you may forget that and I've had that before and it's very very frustrating and so I learn I'm learning I'm learning that when you are given a thought go go write it down and then the holy spirit will bring it to your remembrance amen I'd like to title my sermon this morning being united with your theophany through the revealing of the son of man and I want to take a subject this morning the loud and bride is United to the word under the seventh seal so this message is so greater than we could ever imagin and uh like I said I've been studying and praying about this for a couple months now and I looked up you know brother Brenham said I went and looked up Oxford or Webster dictionary and I happened this morning to look up in the Oxford dictionary um of what a theophany is and Oxford says that it is a visible manifestation to humankind of a God or a god of God or a God so we know that it's a visible manifestation in fact as I begin to study this that through the scripture there are over 50 visible manifestations of God which could be termed a theophany of God it is a visible manifestation of an invisible God he can show himself in many different ways the word theophany is actually made up of two words Theos which means god an epiphany a Theos Epiphany an appearing so God doing an appearing and we know that God when he shows himself in many different visible forms whatever way God comes whatever way God chooses at that time that he is doing it for a purpose God doesn't do anything haphazardly he always does something for a purpose he came as a pillar of fire as a cloud by day as a burning bush as a rushing Mighty Wind as a whirlwind in the top of a tree or in the malberry tree God has shown himself down Through the Ages and the Bible is filled with Angel visitations amen so it behooves all of us to use our discernment and spiritual understanding and we are commanded of God to try the spirits and see if they be of God brother Brenham said why that one angel or an appearance of what appeared to be the angel or or the Lord himself before St Martin and he had a crown remember and he said I am your lord Bow Down and Worship me and he was already crowned and Martin Knew by the word of God that he will be crowned later by the Saints and he knew that this Apparition this visible thing that was before him was not him so he was trying the spirits and so um I looked up in what brother Brenham says in the balm of Gilead what is an angel It's a messenger get the dictionary and find out what does an angel mean some of them's Heavenly Messengers some of them's Earthly Messengers that God dwells in to bring his Earthly message now whenever you understand whenever Angels come and there is a visitation to mankind it's for a purpose because God will never bring judgment without first warning these are messengers angels of the Lord Messengers to you they're standing back there with their hands out to obey What God Says lay hands on the sick they shall recover it has to happen doesn't it now most all of you have been affected by Angels sometime in your life yes you have witnessed with your eyes the angel or the pillar of fire that has come in this age brother Brenham said just seeing the picture of the pillar of fire above the prophet's head he says can bring judgment to the world he says actually those that see the picture he says is a greater manifestation than those who saw it physically and remember one time there was a woman who saw that and she looked at it and she snickered in making fun of it and it said she blasphemed God yes sir so there are angels and ministering spirits that are all around us and we have the Angels so we've seen that the pillar of fire has come in this hour and it's done for a purpose amen and you have been witness of an Earthly Angel which we all can recognize or should recognize is the angel of Revelations 10:7 but then you also have other Messengers under that messenger or that prophetic Ministry of the Angel Messengers brother Brenham said that are in the Pulpit that's true so the Bible is filled with all kinds of Angel visitations and when he comes down makes himself known but did many times when that happens the people do not recognize that it was an angel we see it in the scriptures that after the angel disappears or whatever then they recognize it was an angel even brother Billy Paul to me said brother Ron I did not know who my daddy was until after he passed away and then I realized to him it was just daddy with a gift but he says after he went away then he understood oh my that was the angel to the Church of laiaa now we're talking the Earthly Angel because we know there was a Heavenly angel that came down and met with him now um we know of different Angel visitations Gabriel was sent to Mary to let her know that she was a chosen vessel of God and brother Brenham uses that so much of the time and he said as it was with Mary so shall it be with the bride yes that there'll be someone come there'll be an angel messenger let you know that you are a chosen vessel of God because we had a messenger tell us how that God chooses a bride yes he looks for character not Beauty he looks for attributes that are his attributes amen Angel spoke to Saul on the road to Damascus there he was knocked off his high horse and to the ground and he says Lord who art thou he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest then we see ananas was visited by an Angel to go and pray for Saul can you imagine this man who's been persecuting the church I think this is one of the most outstanding scriptures of a man who has a visitation and God tells him to go and do something and he thinks you mean Saul amen really that Saul the one who's been persecuting and killing the Christians and putting them in jail I mean this may mean my death he said I've chosen him for is he he is a vessel and imagine that everywhere that Paul would go later Saul to Paul everywhere he would go he would identify there was a man who came to pray for me and lay hands on me that the scales of my eyes would fall off and he said that man was ananas imagine everywhere that he went and how that um so many people did not know of ananas but they had heard of Saul or the Apostle Paul oh my one day we'll get up there and we will he's not ananas and saf he is ananas just another CU many have the same name you all know that Jacob wrestled yeah with an angel Gideon met an angel what's amazing is they make a proclamation to whoever they are coming to and he says uh hey Gideon thou art a mighty man of Valor who me yeah yeah you he didn't know it and I want you to understand that this messenger has come to show you you are predestinated ordained of God you are chosen of God to hear God's voice in this hour and to manifest yes that which is God is doing in this hour you're a chosen vessel of God God sends angels to bring about a change we have been influenced by an angel in this hour can you say Amen to that that's why all of you are here y yes because there was something Supernatural that came across your path and when that Prophet began to speak even at the as the woman said it was more than a man all of you can bear witness that when you heard the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound what happened there was something inside of you there was a deep calling to the Deep there for this deep inside of you you didn't understand it let me tell you God never did ask you to understand it he just said Do you believe it and there's something inside of you that if you heard that voice you said beyond your caral knowledge beyond your understanding something inside of you said I believe that yes sir it's nothing but the truth that inspiration would come upon had he right and all she said was that's nothing but the truth once you identify that who is speaking you're uniting with the very merging of Heaven coming down I want you to understand that as the Lord descends with a shout with a voice with a trumpet he does all three as he's descending yes sir I want you to understand this message is bringing to you such a supernatural understanding of what's happening in this hour I don't think we have much time left I believe that the the sands of time are just about over all of you have been witness of what God has done in this hour it's a voice that he sent and that voice began to ring something inside of you your receiver if you please this receiver this seed that was in you began to resonate it was being quickened because everything that God did in the beginning God said and God said and God said what was he doing speaking his word and his word spoken amen must become a manifestation because of it remains just a thought it's only a thought but when it is spoken it becomes a manifestation he can think about light but it wasn't light until he said let there be [Music] [Applause] light many of you I could have you bear witness that if you through throughout your life have unexplainable things that have happened to you that you said it must have been an angel it must because it was Supernatural someone came someone did someone said or whatever and the next thing you turn around look they're gone I'll tell you I remember a supernatural element I was probably about 16 we were coming from a Bible study a youth Fellowship we were in a car a Volkswagen and a girl by the name of Irene Coughlin was driving little Volkswagen Bug we were in this car and it was here we are in San Diego and we're we're on the freeway and you know it's one of them storms or your windshield wipers are just going as fast as they can and it's not fast enough and and we were just going we were singing and we were rejoicing and you know how the little Volkswagen Bug it doesn't have a very good uh system to keep the the windshield from being fogged up and everything and we're just singing and Irene is is wiping the fog on the inside and we're excuse me and we're just going along probably doing 65 70 M an hour much faster than should have but we're going along and all of a sudden there was an 18-wheeler right in front of us I'm sitting on the passenger side in the front seat and Irene doesn't know what to do all of a sudden the it's there it's it's either slowed down almost to a standstill or it was at a stop and all of a sudden a it's there and Irene threw up her her arms and she screamed a like this and as she did and we're I mean we're headed straight for it she threw her hands up and the wheel turned I saw it thank you Lord I Saw the Wheel turn and it turned to the left and we missed the trailer and all of us even Irene said what just happened I let go we were all stunned and I realized right then it was not our time how many of you have had unexplainable things it wasn't your time why God watching over you something in the invisible realm came down grabbed a hold of a wheel it did [Applause] something so for a few moments this morning I would like to look closely at what the prophet said about angels ministering spirits and guardian angels am resurrection of Lazarus 1953 God always sends his warnings just before the coming of Jesus he sent an angel down Out Of Heaven by the name of Gabriel now minor Angels come yes my yes you see Angels everyone has a guardian angel according to the scripture Jesus said there Angels always beholding my father's face which is in heaven now he's taking the scripture that we started with in Matthew 18 and these little ones despise not these little ones and it is your father father's will that none of them perish so now brother Brenham is making a suggestion to us that these angels now I'm going to I'm going to um approach this in a very careful manner this morning because I don't want you to misunderstand but you will find out that these angels which did not fall are a representation of the elect that told Satan know in the beginning it says that these little ones always behold the father's face in heaven now let's see take this slowly and I have a hard time not wanting to run faster than what I should this morning in questions and answers on Genesis now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we're returning back to that image that's right to our first created image when God created me William Brandon I was before the foundation of the world he made me made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of I was there I don't believe you're getting it I love this probably because they're going like students when the teacher trying and they I'm not getting it so now watch this he says but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me Morman Neville and the rest of all you here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began and here's to my analysis of that you want to hear his analysis I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or the spirit AP part of these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell my God that never fell in the beginning and resist the de the devil's lie in heaven brother Brenham said the original you God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world and put it in his family album but this you is after the fall and it's made an image of that but you are not complete without that which never fell I'll substantiate that in just a moment but he said these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven now remember that on our last tape service Sunday evening we listen to the sermon Discerning of spirit wow and those of you that missed it we were having a wonderful time and oh it was just lovely and also my giving you quotes concerning spiritual Amnesia now brother Brenham only preaches the sermon spiritual Amnesia once right but in that sermon he uses the word Amnesia 28 times he says Amnesia is a disease that is caused by three things a shock of some kind either the effects of war that can cause a shock or Amnesia many men who go to war have that and brother Brenham talks about that soldier boy that through the shock of War he had forgot who he was and he had Shell Shock It wasn't until he was on a train I believe going through a part of where he was raised up and all of a sudden he looked out the window and he saw a water tower he said I got off the train as it had made it stop I got off and he said this Soldier Boy doesn't know why he's walking this direction but it seems familiar and he keeps going this message keep going this message my brother my sister is familiar yes sir it is taking you places where you were before you just keep walking hey Wow Wow when he said that when he preached that all of a sudden I was jettisoned I was I was back there it gave me just a brief all of a sudden a little millisecond wow how wonderful how blessed that is my brother my sister one of these days it won't just be a little flash of a midle a second it'll be flash after flash until all of a sudden it will be a reality Hallelujah and Enoch stepped into his vision and he was not that's how real this is becoming this message right now universally around the world is being moved upon into the minds of an elect lady and she is no longer an immature woman to pass off uh this promise to someone else but she's embracing it to her own bosom and she's saying be it unto me according to Thy word cuz she believed the angel do you believe the angel it said sh can cause Amnesia and that's the you not knowing who you are and I tell you there is a real identity crisis in the world today but I say even among message Believers you can be raised up in this message you can be around it you can see the effects but until you have wrestled with the angel yourself amen amen all it is is just well that's what Mom and Dad yeah that's their religion that's the way it was with Jacob God was not real to Jacob he talked about the God of Abraham and the god of Isaac but it wasn't his God and so therefore God hallelujah God has an appointment with every elect seed there'll be a time where he will come down and he will meet and he will speak to the seed my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow you'll begin to hear something something inside of you resonates something inside of you beyond this carnal knowledge Beyond you trying to understand it it's Revelation striking you what is it your deepest responding to the Deep shock will do it worry will cause doubt and unbelief oh I just wonder oh worry worry when we worry we do not doubt and and when we have faith there is no doubt or you can get amnesia when you're halted between two opinions yeah if there's ever a time when people within this message listen to me closely now are halted between multiple opinions this one on the internet here and this one over here and this one over here until finally people get confused and if the parents are confused let me tell you the children will become confused amen God help us have clear understanding God help us to understand who we are and where we come from just as you were in the lines of your father but you don't remember it so were you in the mind of God in the beginning but you don't remember it but you are the very offspring of God now I'm going to S I'm going to say something here and I want you to listen carefully you are not created theophanies you are begotten theophanies because even Satan and his angels were created but we're not begotten but you who are of God he didn't create you he begat you amen you're his you're his offspring let me show you in scripture acts 17: 27 that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he may not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also as your own poets have said for we all are also his offspring prise the Lord Adam the first man was begotten of God you understand that the second Adam begotten of God do you know the first man born of a woman a deceived Church by a union with Lucifer Satan himself the serpent he beguiled Eve a deceived Church by the world and she took his thoughts and received it into her mind and later he seduced her physically do you understand that and the first seed that came forth of a woman was Cain and Cain the Bible says was of the wicked one and you want to see how Wicked he is he had the ways of his father in him that even when Abel Abel by fa Faith he gave a sacrifice better than that of Cain why because faith is a revelation it was revealed to him God cannot reject his own revelation God cannot reject his own word that's why you were begotten in the mind of God do you understand it in the mind he had attributes those were thoughts they were Eternal in him Hallelujah you had fellowship with him let me tell you there was a shock a fall a war that started in heaven and you were separated from that Angelic part of you that never fell and God allowed allowed because of sex birth to come down here to be be brought into this Earth by a uh sex birth Y and he said therefore he said the first one who had rule over you was your first husband how many of you know that and he said there's only one way to break that he said it's got to be a death amen and so he's not going to die till he's thrown in the Lake of Fire so how do you break the union spiritual death and he that comes to Christ must die and give know you not that you must be born again because that which born of the flesh is flesh do you know the Bible says that Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God that's why this body has got to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and you'll all be changed but guess what God's doing it right now he's transforming [Applause] from this terrestrial to a Celestial you're hearing something beyond beyond that curtain of time there's something there is a part of you that is encouraging yourself come on boy you can do it come on buddy there are times you reading your Bible at home doing something and all of a sudden a thought comes to you you're better than that what is it your theophany that angel being part of you that never fell in the beginning it's there the Bible says acts 17:28 for in him we live and move have our being and certain also your own poets have said for you are also his offspring for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the God has like un gold or silver or stone or Graven by Art and man's devices and that the times of this ignorance God winked at it but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent because he hath appointed a day amen amen that's why the prophet of God was so um accustomed to looking at times and Seasons s is this the sign s what time is it do you see he's making you acutely aware there's an appointed time s is this the sign of the end is this the appointed time is this when Revelations 10:7 will begin to sound not when he begins his ministry not the first and second pull those were gathering but the third pole is a separating pull it is one that is an offensive pull to those without Revelation but to those who have Revelation it's life Hall does this offend you no be because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness that by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given Assurance un all men that he hath raised him from the dead we have entered into a Time listen closely now this message has come to adoption the message is becoming clearer am I the only one who seems to find out that as I listen to a tape it becomes a new tape I read my bibl a new Bible why did I never see that before why because now is the season Jesus said he said behold I'd like to tell you many things but seeing that you cannot bear them now how be it after I'm Gone the holy spirit will come and bring to your remembrance everything that I said to you Hallelujah so there's a quickening power you may come to church you may have something laid on your heart there may be the Word of Promise placed inside of you but there'll come a time when that is quickened by the Holy Spirit and you'll recognize it and you'll grab the promise and you will seize it and say that's that's my inheritance amen sir somebody say Amen to [Applause] them amen Romans 8: 14- 23 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but have received the Spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father I looked up the word ABA father one time and you know what it means Because Why didn't it just say my father my father Abba Father Is by Revelation calling him in a relationship he is Abba Father understand something far greater G than than just calling our heavenly father I call him Abba Father with a quickening power placing him as omnipotent as being the head as being the rule as being King theophany Spirit itself Beth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then a and listen let me tell you all of you that have wrestled or are wrestling right now with who you are in your identity you know if you don't know you're a Son of God well then you got to get to wrestling you better know because we're we're fixing to get out of here this game's just about over you understand I'm I can't I can't baby you into it I can't talk you into it you have to work out you're own salvation with fear and trembling amen amen amen and if children then ears HS of God join ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed what's it say in in US where's this Revelation coming in Us in us being revealed in US my being revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God did you know the whole earth is w yeah for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into this glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth together until now the prophet of God said the whole world is in birth pains tear up FMA Mother Earth has been raped and pillaged and all of her fossil fuels and her oils and the Seas and the airs have been polluted if you think it's pretty now just wait until it's refurbished God just as he's going to renew the the Earth he does to each one of you amen hallelujah the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body brother renam says you have the earnest of your inheritance he says you are redeemed that inner man inside of you is redeemed but this flesh body listen because it is a byproduct of sin none of you shall see God in this flesh body it's got to be changed but God is doing it right now he's changing you from Glory unto Glory he's changing you from terrestrial to Celestial he's sending you Angels he's sending you Witnesses he's sending you voices from the edge of Eternity letting you know who you are yes sir not how to dress that's a part of it not how to go to church that's a part of it but I'll tell you what on it's not how good you you are it's how good he [Applause] is in the Old Testament when they brought a lamb to be offered for the sacrifice of sin let me tell you the levitical priest never looked at the man bringing the lamb God is not looking at you he's looking at your lamb how many you say Jesus is my lamb he is without spot or wrinkle amen yes sir never looked at the man he looked at the lamb thank thank you Jesus let me say this also none of you in this flesh will ever be good enough it's not not by works of righteousness but by his grace I'm saved it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace I'm saved you understand it ain't how long your dress is although when God gives you revelation of modest apparel you put it on and God says that's righteous because it's not the long dress it's itself it is the modesty given from the very Mind Of God because without Holiness the Bible says no man shall see God if we are not different than modern Christianity if we don't look different dress different talk different act different then we are not different but you God has chosen he's chosen you he's yes he made you different he said you men will dress like men you women will dress like women Galatians 4 verses 1-7 now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be the Lord of all yeah he's air as long as he is a little child immature thinks as a child acts like a child and Paul said when I put away childish things I became a man that's what God told job job I want to talk to you like a man right G up your lines joob I want to talk talk to you I demand of you an answer where were you when the sons of God shouted together when the morning Stars sang For Joy but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father an appointed time even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world when the fullness of time was come notice always about time when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that he might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons yes and because you are Sons the prophet of God made an astounding statement he said because you are Sons you have the right to the New Birth he said in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken he said the new birth did not change the seed because you are seed because you are Sons amen hallah because you are [Applause] sons help me Lord whereby because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts again crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ the Apostle Paul picks it up and he speaks to you the Ephesian Church Ephesians 1 verse one he says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus to the faithful yes to the faithful in Christ Jesus he's not talking to the beginner he's not talking to the unbeliever he's not talking to those that uh uh have not come to full age coming to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you let me let me see this when the Holy Spirit comes down he's coming to you that's faithful yes I ask you are you Faithful if you are faithful you know what yes he is bound and determined to come to you why because word must come to word Alpha must come to Omega he cannot deny himself that's why a word birth causes you when you hear the word whether you understand it or not there's something inside of you amen amen it's the word yes speaking to word the word cannot deny itself that's why he say you tell me you have the real Holy Spirit right the genuine Holy Spirit and you live a life contrary to the word he said it's not the holy spirit it's a religious spirit amen Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Jus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ brother Bram said you know what Heavenly places means your position and placing by the Holy Spirit to know who you are and where you belong amen amen if somebody left you something if your great uncle who had all kinds of money left you a bunch of money and they had the reading of the will don't you know you'd have to identify yourself you'd have to say I'm that one and he said in the will now give me my inheritance but if you don't claim it you don't get it oh blessed be the God and Father Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him after we got converted according as he has chosen Us in him before somebody say before before before the world even was [Music] created you were chosen y that don't make you arrogant and and looking down at everybody else let me tell you real Grace causes humility huh not stuff shirted not self-righteous huh no we say oh man by Grace man how dare we look down at other people right all kinds of tattoos and piercings and all kinds of stuff and hair and everything that would have been you and I I had it not been the grace of God yeah they're out there they're just looking for something real that's all they want to be different amen Satan marks them well I tell you God marks his also but before the foundation of the world he put a ring of unmar favor upon your finger and it don't matter how many times you fail it don't matter how many mistakes you make guess what you're coming why all that the father hath given me will come and I it's God's will that none of these little ones should [Applause] perish God Amen according he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself he gave himself to himself beauti according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted and to beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made unto having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself he made known unto you the mystery of his will Revelations 10:7 is to finish that's right the mystery do you realize you're a part of it amen H he quit passing it off to somebody else recognize this message I was born for it yes sir I'm not going to pass it off to somebody else I believe it is for me man amen no man spake like this man that in the dispensation of the fullness times excuse me I'm trying to read too F my mouth can't go as fast as my mind amen you you know what when we get over into heaven I think we're going to have mental telepathy we're going to be able hey Jonathan and you're going to say Amen brother why you're going to catch the thought cuz guess what you're catching God's thought right now that's right you'll be even to travel like a you ain't going to need no airplane n why take the supernatural away from the [Music] resurrection Hey listen do you think that he's going to use the mosy brothers airplane out here that's all dilapidated and just an old beaten down aircraft listen if he's coming back in the resurrection why won't he speak a a Lear jet I mean so you know F16 or something man come on why do you need something Hey listen don't take the supernatural away from the resurrection tell you what between 30 and 40 days here we're going to catch there's going to be people coming to you people okay your loved ones that have passed on because because you know what the dead in Christ shall rise what and you which are alive and remain okay hey saints of God I'm excited because I believe that right now I'm going to be part of those I didn't think it so I you know when I was a young boy I thought well man you know he may not but you know what I see he's not caring his coming I I want to be here alive and remain I want to see I don't know how the change of the body is going to be I don't know how it'll be I don't know when will it be when I see the dead in Christ rise first and they come to me hey you made it you made it oh my wow yeah like on a game show run up and down hug the host and there what what is going to stop your face when you your faith when you know it you mean I made it you mean really really yeah yeah hey it's on the resurrection's on let me tell you what's going to stop your faith then I don't know I don't know how it'll be but there'll be a change there'll be a sweep amen wow my if be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah God is just about ready yes to give the last signal and when the dead in Christ rise guess what and they begin to show themselves he said we'll be here on Earth for about a period of 30 to 40 days because the Bible says in the book of Acts he showed himself by many infallible proofs he he came up as the first fruits of the resurrection and went back to the disciples and declared unto them right behold I told you go into Jerusalem go into Galilee and I will appear unto you there and many of them thought it was a spirit let me tell you if something appeared through this wall right here right now huh if all of a sudden somebody just all of a sudden appeared right through that wall you think he would get your [Music] attention because things are happening let me tell you the theophanies yes why when Christ came came down was it silence in heaven brother brandom said he is accompanied by 10 thousands of his Angel he said there was silence in heaven but not on Earth yes sir because he said he ripped off those seals he threw them down to earth and that seventh angel messenger caught it and began to see the Revelation that was broke open the Seven Seals brother R said Revelations 10 he says is the seven seal we're living it my brother my sister what is it it's his coming why the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming don't miss it my brother my sister amen we've obtained an inheritance now we are the sons of God Amen not will'll be we are now amen 1 John 3: 1-3 behold what manner of love the father ha bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is yes sir and every man that hath this hope and in him purifieth himself even as he is pure I looked at that that's an interesting statement interesting verse look at that and every man that hath this hope hope in him the word hope El elsis it means the anticipation under expectation abstractly it means to have the confidence I have this confidence in him that purifieth himself purifieth habia means the cleanliness especially Chast ity or Purity you're a chased virgin who has this hope this expectation of the chaste kept way of God in your life and to be pure the base words comes from heos which means sacred pure morally blameless yeah and religious ceremonially consecrated it means a saint you're a saint you're a saint not a haint you're a saint amen now let me say some things because time's going by so quickly Eternal theophanies are not created theophanies you're not a created son you're a begotten son you understand that where were you begotten when were you beot in the very Mind Of God before the foundation of the world y thank you do you know there's no such thing as an eternal son now listen to this quote 1957 questions and answers I'm not going to read the whole quote but italicize so the Catholics call it the Eternal sunship of God which I have said before the word doesn't even make sense see there cannot be an eternal son because a son had to have a beginning a son had to have a beginning and so Jesus this a now take this chew on this for a minute Jesus had a beginning because he was the beginning of the creation of God God but the Bible says he is also the only begotten Son of God now watch this he says see there cannot be an eternal son because a son had to have a beginning and so Jesus had a beginning God had no beginning no beginning of days nor ending of life he had no father or mother who is this miles he says not Eternal sunship but the son that was with the father in the beginning was the logos that went out of out of God it was the theophany of God that went out it was God himself God's theophany in another form because God is a spirit and you do not know how to worship God who is a spirit that you cannot understand so God condescended down and he brought to us a thought and he put that logos thought the concept of God himself into a man we called Christ Jesus it was a theophonic sended into a theophonic he says watch he had eyes like you see but a better eye it didn't I'm sorry it didn't have eyes like you see a better eye didn't have ears like you hear a far better hearing Moses saw it when passed through the rock like that saw the back Parts said look like a man now did you know now I'm going to try to cut it off right here because I'm gonna uh the other stuff that I want to go into is going to take a little bit too much time but brother Brenham said Jesus had a beginning but God had no beginning all right are we together on that now in Luke 22 verse 37 Jesus speaking for I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was re among the transgressions transgressors for the things concerning me have an end you mean the things concerning Jesus have an end you see understand this now all the prophecy about Jesus and everything that he was to be he is to accomplish but once he's accomplished it he says I didn't come here to reveal myself I come to reveal who father father for if you've seen me you've seen my father because my father and I are one come on go beyond some carnal understanding right now and put on a spiritual thinking C get some spirituality about yourself everything concerning me will come to an and does that mean in in hang on hang on just Mikel came to the back office he said brother Ron man I'm ready to L latch on my seat belt I said Put it on tight because I'm going to I'm going to rock it out of here amen all the prophecy once it's fulfilled in Christ the Fulfillment of pro prophecy will be what swallowed up I want ask you when you go to heaven are you going to see Jesus only and the father is still on the throne somewhere Jesus said I did not come here to reveal myself but I came here to reveal him because the mystery of God is revealed in Jesus Christ once the Fulfillment of Christ is finished you will see only the fullness of the Father the three dispensations of God were God above us the fatherhood of God God With Us amanuel god with us then God in us the Holy Spirit the spirit of God in The Believer but now the alpha comes back to Omega God will come back to become the all and all and when the mystery of God is finished the father Son and Holy Spirit will be one in him is one body y he is not going to be God the Father throughout all eternity he's going to be Jehovah Elohim the self-existing one who has made himself revealed himself to his creation to his begotten yes amen you see once the prophetic scriptures concerning Christ are finished fulfilled guess what once you're redeemed there's no need for a redeemer once you're healed there's no need for a Healer once you are saved you have no need of a savior once your case is dismissed you don't need an advocate yes sir but God will never dwell alone again amen he will dwell with his seed throughout eternity who do you this say this is 1964 that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt Alone with his thoughts who were those thoughts his family his begotten oh my God God dwelt Alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again cuz his thoughts are being made manifest and that's why we are here we are right here this day is God fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest is that what God's doing with you he's fellowshipping with you why you are his thoughts made manifest he thought about a bride in laiaa guess what he was thinking about you the woman is the glory of the man musicians have you come amen the bride is the glory of Christ am we are his glory he is not complete without her we complete him that's deep that's good stuff we complete him because the mystery is being finished right now that's right brother Juan because the same God began to deal with you as a young boy and he led you and he showed you he's continuing day by day every time you come to church and you bear witness every time you come to church brother Ron God speaks to you that's how many of you say I can say Amen to that you know what cuz I hear him he he's speaking to me he's calling to me he's telling me I'm his [Music] own those Eternal theophanies are coming back to the King theophany right now what is happening is those Eternal Realms are coming down and interpenetrating into this realm it's so close [Music] because they are waiting brother Ram said those theophanies are waiting yes just in another dimension a little faster what's happening I want you to Bear witness of this they are slowing down while we are getting faster until the two dimensions are going to come into a blending and this invisible Union yes that is taking place right now understand we are not going up to the marriage he said you're United here you're being united right now with your theophanies oh I'm having a hard time holding back because I want to save it for the next time I preach these theophanes all of these Angelic beings he said said that was you that was a part of you that never fell that part of you that is coaxing you on we know the Holy Spirit does it we know the Holy Spirit speaks to you but also are not all of these others brother Brenham called them Guardian Angels they watched over you yes they're watching over you even now yes thank you Lord when the bride and groom are united together they become one [Music] flesh and the two have become one flesh brother Ram said do you see this invisible Union that's going on right now what is it he said there's a unit in time and sign and the seed will see [Music] it brother Bram said since the fall in Eden you bypass your [Music] theophany and you came down to this Earth by a sex birth and the new birth is now the only remedy to bring you back to reunite reunite you with him and to reite reunite you with a part of you that stayed up [Applause] there you never fell you never sinned in the first place but you did down here you made mistakes down here in the first [Music] place I was begotten in the mind of God I was eternal in his thoughts that's [Music] me you see the will of the father is redemption and restoration that none will perish we never knew that we had another body until this messenger came and told us there's two of you he said yeah there's another part of William brandom he said another part it was over there he says and he said when I began to know who I am I refuse to be called the son of Charles and elen he now realize I'm calling unto him Abba Father begin to recognize who you are the Bible says if our body be dissolved we have another one waiting any of you ever wait for something waiting is painful I hate to wait hurry up don't make me wait I tell all my kids hurry up man don't make me wait I'm not real good at waiting but the Bible says that the they that body is waiting for you just [Music] waiting well waiting is one of those things that once it happens and they're they are there then all of this frustration and all of this that got you you all flustered because why didn't they Hur you I don't like waiting but you wait upon the Lord yes he'll renew your strength it's going to be here one of these days Saints he's coming soon without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will never understand the word of God Heavenly places is the B the position of the believer in Christ two parts of redemption I'm going to close here I'm going to close here two parts to Redemption he said first part [Music] Calvary the lamb was slain gave his blood but even after Calvary there's another part of redemption who's worthy to take the book to loose the seals thereof no one in heaven and Earth was found worthy and John began to weep there was a voice behind him said weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath revealed he turned to look to see a lion and what did he see I saw a lamb yes having been slain the you see first part of Calvary second part is someone to take the book because no one was found worthy there was no re the the finishing part of redemption wasn't there I was bought but nobody claimed [Music] me the price have been paid but nobody came and got me out of the pond shop we're still in the pawn shop we're waiting to with the Redemption of our [Music] bodies so between the breach be spiritual now between the breach of the church ages and the seals it is that in between place because right now between Revelations 10 and Revelations 11 is a breach do you understand it's an in between he said God can't come to Israel and revealed through the two prophets Moses and Elijah until the days of the Gentiles be finished he's finishing up right now and until you come into your position and take your place in the body of Christ and that only comes to you revealed to you by the Holy [Music] Spirit go ahead and give me that other verse there you had it just I stand In Awe with the presence of the Lord in whom the wisdom of the ages lies For Whom the Raging of the Seas subsides The Living Sacrifice the only source of life don't you love him this morning all right brother Mark I stand in all within the Pres stand of the Lord in whom the wisdom of the agees lies for who the Raging of the Seas subsides The Living Sacrifice the only source of life my hope is in the Lord From This Time on and ever more oh my hope is in the Lord forever more his Tender Mercies his tender meres come with every Rising Sun to meet The Sinner in his Brokenness to offer healing and [Applause] forgiveness and those who trust in him will find their hearts at rest my hope is in the Lord from this time on and ever more my hope is in the Lord forever more brother brother deham would you come and dismiss in a word of prayer [Music] please an elder Among Us you don't hear much from him but he's faithful he sits over there and while I preach I can I can feel him pulling brother deham God bless you my brother I honor you as an elder among us would you please if you want to pray in Fr that's [Music] fine I would like to pray in French because that comes from deep within in English it should be like a recitation coming from my head but accept that pray in French do you agree thank [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] for for [Music] [Music] amen amen let's sing that song
