Lord take away our doubts take away unbelief Lord but we can stay focused on your promises to made it come to pass or manifest Lord in our MST thank you Lord that we become a very special people Lord God because is you yourself Lord come down and open the book and reveal to us our name Lord and we thank you that we recognize that we are part of your program Lord part Hallelujah of your of your plan before the foundation of the world Lord oh God thank you Lord that you make us worthy tonight and be with us and we humble ourselves tonight Lord in your presence and we commit the service to you Lord and may you once again be with us speak into our heart Lord and let your name be happy preeminence Lord among us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen and amen can we say praise the Lord tonight praise the Lord amen so my wife is always asking me who will be our preacher tonight so I told him it's the holy ghost that would be preached for us tonight because I know you don't want to listen to a man preaching but we want the Holy Ghost to preach but the Holy Ghost is using the man right Amen to be his mouthpiece tonight amen so we are enjoying the presence of the Lord tonight and we will go directly to the word of God in Genesis chapter 17 we'll start in uh verse 19- 21 then Genesis 21 1 and two amen thank you for bringing your little leak of fire and we will we will not know what God is going to do to us amen it's always a two ways that's right I will be the preaching and you will be the receiver amen amen and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac so at this moment Isaac has not yet been born if Isaac is not born by Sarah then the future seed of the elect of God would not have come forth that's right so this is a specific promise to Sarah and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him and are for Ismael I have heard the behold I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall be beget and I will make him a great nation amen so if anyone becomes great it is because God makes him great that's right but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this time in the next year so during the time Sarah is 89 years old when God spoke this uh concerning her and so the promise of God must come specifically through a woman and no other woman but only Sarah amen but the problem is he was already 89 years old so there is a mystery hidden in this types and shadows right so let's uh jump to Genesis chapter 21 and one and two and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken amen for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in an old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him so the conception of the Bride of his hour is produced by the visitations of an Angel and may the Lord have the blessing upon the reading of his word you may now be seated so the title uh tonight is the enforcers of the Covenant the enforcer of the Covenant so if I if I will uh bring uh a subject it will be the restoration of Sarah between the appearing of the Lord and the coming of Isaac and we know that Genesis chap 12 uh I we know that uh we can preach about Abraham uh every preacher everything you can preach it maybe not only a month but a year or even eternity amen because there's always when the SE was opened the open book when the seal was open it could no longer be sealed again that's right so it just keep on unfolding keep on unfolding keep on unfolding praise Lord because we have an open book so this Bible becomes a new book so in Abraham alone we can get a lot of uh sermons as the Lord's inspired and we know that uh God had a pip Ministry so each Ministry can get a little angle and a little angle and we can form into a picture it's just like Apostle this is a this is a this is not a oneman revelation amen amen so so that no one can say oh I am the greatest I am the best I am the great no that is Lucifer mentality that's right and we know Lucifer always want to become the best y he was the best of all but if we love the Lord Jesus Christ advis his disciple if you love me feed my flock so this is not about who we are but about how we love the flock of Jesus Christ because the ministry is edification until we come into the unity of the faith so each Minister had its own angle to present and I believe God is doing that amen so this is a is a uh five po Ministry just a onean Ministry so God put something in my heart and the last time I preached it was about uh remembering God's Covenant of Grace but tonight I will uh just preach as the Lord leads me the enforcer of the Covenant and remember that the life's journey of Abraham started in chapter 12 and God spoke to Abraham and he said that separate yourself from your Kindred and your tongue and everything and God make it un contributional Covenant with Abraham amen so before the and this unconditional Covenant take effect he need to separate from unbelief right anything that will hinder you from the blessings of God you need to separate yourself amen and when he separate there is the condition you need to separate before the blessings come amen and and God made a covenant and conditional Covenant I will make your name great amen I will make your seed great everything God promised Abraham is UN conditional Covenant and the prophet said in this last day that it was true election yes he elected Abraham not because he is good or whatsoever it's just by the grace of God that he elected Abraham and we are the Seed of Abraham amen so our calling is by elections not by what we do or what we have or whatever we do it's just by God's election and and when God said I will bless you everything in the blessings our trials and whatever we've been through in life it is included in the blessing and sometimes we misinterpret blessings to be Prosperity or something or achievement but but blessing included in what we are going through in this life that's right that's right some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but that is through the blood our blessings is included in in the blessings of God our trials and testing are included amen because when God called Abraham Abraham is nothing he is a hidden he has no character whatsoever so when God blessing that is included the trial the testing is including the blessings to mold Abraham's character so actually Abraham's life's journey is a reflections of our journey because as Abraham saided we are on the same category so in Genesis chapter 17 this is where God confirm his Covenant with Abraham so we'll start in 17 verse1 he said and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine so in chapter 12 he was only 75 years old when God gave him the promise so remember during that time there will he has already a lot of ups and downs in his journey amen but in chapter 17 God confirmed his Covenant and when Abraham was 90 years old and n9ine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almight Mighty God walk before me and thou shalt be perfect appeared unto Abraham in the form of the message in a voice amen I am the Lord God Almighty walk before me and thou shalt be perfect so there is perfection in Walking with God and remember that Almighty in in in Hebrew it's called el shed I which mean the breasted one the strength giver and the sustainer in all those years that that Abraham travel and journey God then confirmed and and confirm his Covenant that it was he amen himself who sustained Abraham's journey through his ups and down he is sustainer he is the strength Giver he is the the enforcer amen he he is reminding Abraham that all those trials yes I not leaving you Abraham Hallelujah I am be with you in your trials just like something that's he said that you need to walk with me and thou shalt be perfect so our Perfection is Walking with God and walking is something that you need to align right yourself with the word that was given in your day you need to have harmony with the message of the hour praise God from Genesis to Revelation so that's why you can walk with God imperfectly if you have the harmony of the message of the hour from Genesis to Revelation Perfection is not by Good Conduct that's right amen Revelation first then Good Conduct follow am not Good Conduct then Perfection if you do a Good Conduct first then you can boast about yourself oh I made it I do this but by Revelation then good canu follow that's why we need to eat the word of God eat the word of God pray in the word of God and you don't just realize it you are manifesting the word of God the more you eat the word of God the more you become the word that's why there is always an Harmony if you walk with God that is your Perfection because when God the mighty angel of Revelation then come down and he set his foot upon the sea and upon the land with an open book in his heart and seven then there other the voices and that message was given to the seventh angel we cannot find any Scripture that said that after he he's coming down after he descended from Heaven there was no scripture that tell us that he leave the Earth amen when he said his putot upon the landine of the sea he remain until today he is with us because he promised I will be with you even in you until the end of the word no scripture that say he went back no he is here according to his promise I will be with you even in you until the end of the world so that's why whatever trouble in your life is don't forget God is in it whatever trial you are in God is in it whatever situation you are in he is in it because he is here that's why we are privileged people amen that's why I always say don't don't don't don't do party py party we are the most privileged people that's right why did we need to realize the message of the hour is so rich it is to shake us from all unbelief to shake us from all doubt we need to recognize our day and our message walk before me and thou shall be perfect our Perfection is the reveal word of the hour not by our good as I said before good cond follow if you have the good Revelation thank you Lord God is confirming his Covenant that's why he appeared unto Abraham and confirming his Abraham this is also in chapter that he changed Abraham to Abraham he put his name into Abraham yes he put his part in Abraham so that's why now Abraham is not expressing God yes sir because by believing the promise of God it was imputed unto him for his righteousness and the scripture said he who knows no sin becomes sin that we might become his very righteousness so he put a h apart of him in Abraham and he chain Sarai the I into the H he is no longer I I I it's become him him him amen it's no longer about us is about him he changed Sarah to Sarah and identify the age you need to change Sarai into Sara turn the eye into him glory and God requires the token Amen in these last days the token of the circumcision which is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our day this is a sealed mystery before the opening of the book but now it's a reveal into us the manifestation thank you Lord amen so we are now we are not reading in the Old Testament translation but we are reading in the open book amen that's right that everything that we can read in the Old Testament always reflect here y amen and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and multiply thee ex God is confirming his Covenant amen so if you are in the presence of God you will multiply amen it will take away your great it will take away your bitterness it will take away hatred it will take away jealousy it will take away whatever things that exalt himself against God that's right he will change he will multiply exceedingly thank you Lord don't struggle too much that's right just eat the word amen lay in the presence of the Lord read your Bible read your spoken word listen to the word don't be conscious of your fruit because fruit will follow if you just keep on eating the word that's why it's an open book it's free yes it's not for display it's not for something but it's for us Amen to enjoy the buffet thank you Lord other words for Buffet eat all you can that's right so it's up to you to grow you need to eat and eat and it don't stop Hallelujah so when we go to chapter 18 it was God himself revealed or come to Abraham and Sarah in human form yes only the prophet of God revealed this you cannot find this in any denominations or whatsoever it only takes the prophet of God in this last day that it was God in human form so it was not tupan form form it was not a glorified body because Juan form is a word body that you cannot eat cannot anything but this is human form because in God there is nothing impossible that's right he can spoke something into existing he can speak something out of nothing he can spoke a body into existence and he can spoke the body out of existence it was human body yes and it is a sign for our day that God once again come into our generation manifest in the body of Revelation 10 and speak unto the word speak the word unto us amen thank you Lord yes sir and God is continuing that even in the time of BOS God spoke flies into existence for one day spoke flies into existence old house and old G is full of flies right then few days he spoke out of his system those flies right then the following he spoke lies and all of Egypt full of lies then in one second he spoke out of existence he still the same God that's and that God is still he spoke squirrel into existence yes and spoke out the squ into existent he's still the same God hallelujah hallelujah so in in the Feast of the trumpet he said but the one that stayed with and talked Abraham Abraham called The Almighty gen one uh uh Elohim the alls sufficient one the self-existing one and Abraham called him Elohim and he sat down and eat with Abraham he drank and he was in human flesh and was the sign that he gave to Abraham amen so only the prophet identify that angel coming to Abraham as human amen now they were looking for a coming son a promised son Isaac 25 years on a long journey they had looked for it but they were at the end of The Journey God appeared in many forms amen as he has through the church ages he appeared many forms in light and so forth you know in many form in lights in pillar of pillar of amen he can appear in the form of a man amen and he spoke to Abraham by Voices but just before the coming son arrived now we've been through it and now you know I'm just rehearsing to get this to you that he changed the body of Abraham and Sarah immediately after this so they could receive the son this messages directly came from the mighty angel coming down with an open book and those mystery the hidden Mystery of the time of the of the Shadows of the older Testament was given to us oh Hallelujah no denomination can explain that God changed the body of Sarah and Abram in order to receive the son only in this generation and he typed that shadow in our generation that before we meet the promis Isaac there will be a body change oh God hallelujah our heraches our time that we we are suffering our old age some we cannot see some it will not last long amen praise the Lord it has a beginning it will be an end because the promise has come notice the last sign that they got before the son arrived was Jehovah talking to them in the form of a man amen so this story in Genesis showing us the mystery of this end time age of what we also promised the day that would happen to Abraham's Royal seed what happened then will happen again because history will repeat itself God has a pattern he cannot change his pattern that's why we can say he's the same yesterday today and be forever praise the Lord that's why we can have the consolation if we can see the type there's always if you can see the shadow there is always a reality so this was the secret coming of the Lord to Abraham and this is also the secret coming of the Lord to the bride to Abraham's seed but we know that the story doesn't stop in Genesis 18 so we will continue that a little while so let's go to Genesis Chapter 18 where God appeared in human flesh and the scripture say and the Lord appeared to him in plain of Mumy and he sat in the tth door In the Heat of the day Abraham is waiting God already appeared to him and spoke to him that he is confirming his promise so when we hear the word of God we need to be aware we need to watch every born every days in our life we need to to watch something Supernatural happen will take place in our life while waiting yes for the Fulfillment of the coming of the Lord amen we need to wait amen don't struggle with anything in this word your life your career whatsoever because as the scripture said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you but be aware of his presence he is waiting at the T door he's waiting and waiting and waiting for the promise of God to make manifest in his life that's right he was not thinking about his livelihood he was not thinking about lot or whatsoever he is looking and he lift up his eye and look and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bow himself towards the ground remember in verse three he saw them when he saw them he was so excited are you excited to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen yes sir if God Appears to you in the realing of his word you need to be excited not only on Sunday but even in Wednesday you need to be excited amen you don't you don't need to wait for the to the door to open to the Deacon to stand at the door you need to be in the house of the Lord that's right that's why he recruit the tree coming but he said in verse three and I said my Lord as we always say he was not a trinitarian amen he saw God made manifest In the Flesh he identified because he already God already appeared unto him God is always talking to him have fellowship with him so when they come the tree come he recognize amen and he said my Lord amen it's all capital right I now have found favor in thy sight pass not by I pray thee from thy sermon and let Ally water I pray you be peit and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I will Peach a morcel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant as they said so do as thou has said hallelujah amen when when he saw the Lord right away he make a service to the Lord yes he didn't just say and you know just listen to the word and all of that go to church Wednesday no he work he serve he do the service we need to do a service to the Lord and whatever things we can do unto the Lord let us be an encourage whatever things God put in your heart God don't call us by accident God called us with a certain purpose in our life amen we are not called just to be a flower vase we we have a a certain function in our life that's right even by saying amen alone that is your function that is good enough amen it will encourage the preacher it will encourage the the one besides you when you say you raise your your hand and say Amen it will cage the one besides you or at the back if that is the only purpose you have be good at it say amen hallelujah because amen means so be it Lord Let Your Presence be done hallelujah if there is somebody who is sick tonight let it be done Lord amen by your manifestation by your action it can heal somebody beside you or in front of you because he saw the enthusiasm in your heart he saw the fire burning in your heart and that there encouraged [Music] am you see our presence so contagious that's right if you're happy the one beside you will be happy if you are sad the one beside you will be discouraged but if you are always happy just smile at me amen cuz I'm always discouraged when you're proning me amen and I will pit a morel I bread and comfort your hearts and so Abraham has so much things to do he pit the tent he make a morsel he he make something like he's too busy we need to be busy serving the lord amen don't give chance to Satan to give us you know different mindset different problems for all of that if you stop serving the lord Satan so enjoy it y he will bombard you with all negativity in your mind and all discouragement but if you keep on per persuade your yourself encourage yourself even if you don't feel like it Encourage Yourself sir because even if you don't feel like it doesn't mean that God is not with you that's right but remember when he come down he didn't return back he stayed with you oh thank you Lord even though how much we search the scripture what is the scripture that say he leave the Earth no scripture amen after he come down he is with us praise the Lord thank you Lord he's ministering to each and every one of us he give us encouragement and Abraham he into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quick three measures of meal and need and make cakes and and Abraham ran into the herb and so Abraham become hyper oh I need to do this I need to do that he become so nervous y That's why when you are in the Pres God you need to be nervous oh I need to do something for God I need to do this I need to keep yourself busy yes he was attending the ministry then he went to the kitchen Sarah Sarah but Sarah is in his right position that's right yeah that's why the blessing come because Sarah is always way in the kitchen she is listening to every conversation because Faith cometh by hearing and not hearing by the word of God he don't want to miss what is the message of the hour she don't want to miss anything so that's why although she's working she's listening that's right verse 7even and Abraham ran into the herb and fetch a cup tender and good and gave it unto the young man and hastened to dress it do you think how many hour will take to dress the cup but he's doing it he was so excited but you notice how Abraham made haste to service the Lord he didn't slot around and miss the church because the service start he was already in his seat praying 30 minutes before the service was doing service to the Lord he's praising God Amen is he's doing something yeah very good but during this time the purpose is something we yet the Lord just keep silence he allow Abraham to do the service and sometimes if we feel dry in our journey and sometimes we feel dry we feel discouraged just keep on serving because when God called you he didn't Guaranty that you will always be happy amen trials is in part remember trial is part of your blessing does it count it all joy when you fall into diverse places count it all joy so that is the secret of your trial count it all joy because all things works together for good to them that love the Lord all things not part all things is for your own good so the Lord is silence about this purpose of his coming he allow Abraham to serve him with haste with all his might he servant yes and he took butter and milk and the cup which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did it he just keept on looking why they are eating he is already enjoying it that's right yes well you are Ving God somebody is blessed by the way you act I am blessed if I see people around here before the service start they already praying kneeling I'm already blessed amen and some of them is driving 3 hours 4 hours ready in the church while somebody that is only 30 minutes are late amen so that's a blessing amen yes you may not know it but your sacrifice is always be a blessing to somebody else that's right Amen in verse 9 he show Abraham's purpose and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent so their visit was specifically with Sarah because there can be no coming of Isaac until Sarah is first dealt with in a certain way amen amen so his visitation is not for Abraham but for Sarah because Sarah is receiving seed for 25 years and come to the point that he is she's doubting the promises of Abraham so that's why he told Abraham go to Hagar she's receiving seed but she was not conceiving seed so it will take an angel visitation to give her strength so that she can conceive amen was in Paul said in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 and Sarah conceived seed God gave him strength to conceive seed because he knows the one who made a promise is faithful that's right so after the the Angel's visitation it gave her strength to conceive because that was not an ordinary man who can discern the thought of his heart he was away from the tent and he was listening to the conversation he was listening to the fellowship amen while he was listening is create a faith in her heart although she was doubting but when God in the form of a man discern her heart it creates strength for her to conceive amen and he said I will certainly return according to the time of life I will certainly amen God is confirming his promise amen not only to Abraham but now he's mentioning Sarah return according to the time of life after he had left them the form human flesh he would return to them again to perform the promise both to Abraham and Sarah they need to turn from an old man old woman to a young man to a young woman in order for the promise to take place amen amen yes amen so it was clear because it was the prophet who got the vision that there is really a changing of the body before the promised son came amen hallelujah denomination will explain oh for God nothing is impossible that's it but for us God changed their body into young man and a young woman in order to conceive which the prophet type that before we meet the Lord in the air there will be a changing of our body because flesh and blood cannot inherit to the kingdom of God God need to change it before we meet the Lord in the air praise the Lord and he said I will certainly return according to the time of life and low Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were all were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of the women therefore Sarah within herself saying after I am walks old shall have pleasure my Lord being old It seems impossible but God With God nothing is impossible that's right he can do whatever he want because God is Sovereign amen it is he's doing something according to the good pleasure of his will Hallelujah and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I ofely bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sh shall have a son amen God when God speak a promise he is faithful to forgive the promise I will certainly return according to the time of life amen so the promise must come to this woman who saw The Secret of Heart revealed by this one there is no other woman that can fulfill This Promise amen amen amen This Promise is directly connected to this woman Sarah and so Sarah shows the mystery of the body chain before the appearing of the promised son Isaac you see that each woman in the Bible show a portion of the mystery of the Bride of this hour that's why we can see that the Old Testament is a sealed mystery in types and shadows but the opening of the seals is revealed those character in The Bible just like Ruth shows the four stages of end time gentle bride of this hour by her deciding by her serving by resting and after that the reward Ruth also showed the mystery of the marriage at the Harvest time in the evening time amen hallelujah this is the evening time where the marriage took place Revelation 19 the bribe has made herself ready amen amen hallelujah Rahab is also a type of the message of the hour believer remember that heab is a ill Fame woman praise God with a with a bad reputation is she was a prostitute she don't really meet the prophet but she was hearing yes what is being done in Israel she heard that there was God praise God who opened the Red Sea there was God in the pillar of P who lead the people out and she was listening and she was listening and deep down in in her heart she believe it and she's expecting maybe someday I can meet that that that Fellowship I can meet that Believers that can share to be the message of the hour because I have heard I heard I heard something is is is taking place she was a type of the message of the hour today we may not had been with a Propet in flesh cuz I received the message in 1985 so when I received the message to be I I read about the prospet visit South Africa all the manifestations of the prophet and sign and I don't really know it but tears running out my te I keep on crying and crying and I believe in it amen although I don't see I I I don't see phally the prophet but the way he present the message the hour and testimony it keeps my heart it gives my heard something say that's real and when the prophet said he always humbl himself the presence of Lord Lord I want that kind of spirit in my life amen I want to experience that Lord in my life just like Rahab he heard she heard the Mighty God is moving among the Israelite I see her even though she don't see it but deep down in heart she's longing maybe that God that they are serving the god that they are are they they preaching will reveal it to me it is important to note that Rahab was called in the time of the Harvest at the evening time and received the token which blind well with the third pool Ministry see didn't really meet the prophet but when she heard that there was a spy bringing the message of the hour she received the message of the hour she belied it and she hide it she not really hiding the message but the message is hiding her amen because the message apply this token and when the Judgment strike we will pass over you apply the token so anybody in Jericho that want to be saved need to go to rahab's house that's because Rahab is the final voice to the final AIDS unless they come into the roof of Rahab they will be destroyed they will be judged but Rahab even though he don't see the prophet he believed the message of the prophet and applied the token and everybody need salvation need to go to Rahab because Rahab at that time is the final voice to the final AGS amen no other place people can be saved except in the place of Rahab God look at Rahab blameless spotless hallelujah thank you Lord she became the final voice of that city of Jericho God did not see her uncleanliness amen God looked through the red color of the token God looked through the blood and saw her completely Justified she was clean she was holy she was blameless I have a church without spot without wrinkle because she applied the token God is being she was justified in the sight of God that all her uncleanliness thank you being a prosecute is being clean in the sight of God praise the Lord in the sight of men he she may be unclean dirty but when she received the message of the hour everything changed she become the final Voice Hallelujah we are dirty in this generation we are dirty we are adulterous we are Gentiles but when we receive the message of the hour God declare us and say you are Justified thank because I know you even before the foundation of your word in fact I already Justified you I already Sanctified you and I already glorified you hallelujah hallelujah that is the mystery of Rahab in this generation and isther also have the authority of the King how he comes into that same Authority where her word become the same Authority as the king sword as the prophet said here is the secret the wordy see the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he once done to the word and she does it in his name for she has does the Lord then it gmati as the Holy Spirit Waters until it grown and serve its purpose Easter have the authority of the King on his side and who is the Easter today you are the Easter today you have the septer of the revealed word that's why you can speak healing you can speak restoration you can encourage people hallelujah because the word is in you praise the Lord prise the Lord you don't need to call the pastor to pray for youen although you need to respect the pastor because he is the highest Authority in the church amen amen but now the authority is given to each and every one of us in case of emergency you need you don't need to call your pastor while he was sleeping you have the voice of God in your you have the authority of the king in you you can pray for your family you can pray for your friend you can pray for somebody else you can pray for your offic mate everything you can pray because the word of God is in you the authority you have that said the Lord praise the Lord praise God and all these women in the Bible are showing us portion of the one picture of what this end time bride will be this hour it was not an accident that God put every scripture put every character in The Bible but they represent each and every one of us amen that's why we recognize our name is written in the book because we can see our we can identify ourselves in this character and that's how God call our name because we identify oursel in the scripture and also Rebecca show us the evening time it her call and she was willing to follow him to meet her unseen bridegroom of a man she had never seen before she was just hearing from elaser and she follow it and we have elaser in our day and Mary show us how the word was formed in her after the visitation of the Angel be it unto me according to Thy word that's right you don't need to memorize you don't need to explain you just need to believe if God show you the scripture you need to believe it and don't doubt it that's the only way that you can conceive just like Sarah when she believed the the word of the Angel it gave her strength to conceive just like Mary when the Angels visit the should come and give her the word it give her strength to conceive amen the same with with uh with uh Samson's mother she was baren she cannot do it but when the angel uh come unto him and the angel said Thou Art baren and you can bear not but you will bear a son and she will be a Nazarite from the day he was born until the day he will till he die he will be a nazarine and it give her strength to conceive Amen in this generation we have an angel visitation in our day and it give us strength for the body changed it give us encouragement to move on because the message is not an accident that comes to you Hallelujah it was not given to any other woman except for Sarah only this message is not given to anybody else but for the Bride of Jesus Christ praise the Lord so in Genesis 20 is something that take place in between chapter 18 which is the appearing of the Lord in chapter 21 which is the coming of Isaac amen so between the ministry of Bram and we meet the Lord in the air we see the event of Genesis 20 is take place right there in this two event restoration of Sara between the appearing of the Lord and restoration or the coming of Isaac amen so the whole plan and promise of God would have failed right there Hallelujah it is to do with Sarah chapter 20 remember when God appear to Abraham chapter 18 and verse 19 he went to Sodom the two Angel went to Sodom and proclaimed judgment but one stayed with Abraham right and Abraham become a coworker with God he stand in the Gap that's right because God is going to judge Sodom and he he he commune he B with if you can find 50 will you no 50 40 10 and God don't judge it so in verse 20 it say that Sarah was Straten with the seed of another men that was not her husband's seed she was treaten in verse 20 Abraham travel and go to and to go to meet aimc and Abraham was afraid and said that if aik the king will ask what is our relationship just tell tell him that you are my sister verse 20 and Abraham journeyed from then toward the South Country and dwelt between cadis and S and sourn in gerar and Abraham said of Sarah his wife she is my sister and ab king of J sent and took Sarah you remember even though he lied it is still part of the program of God Amen because God is going to express his attributes exactly but for a man like us we are so judgmental ah God don't like God hate lies no one can go to heaven if you lie we are quick to judge amen but God is longsuffering that he's not willing that anyone should Pierce but come into repentance thank you Lord but God came to aik in a dream so he took Sarah and he want to marry Sarah but God came to aimc in a Dream by night and said to him behold thou art a dead man for a woman which thou Hast taken for she is a man's wife but aimc had not come near her and he said Lord will thou slay also a righteous [Music] Nation so right here aim would have destroyed the future nation of Israel that would come to Isaac if he had taken Sarah for his wife and live with her she can do anything with Sarah because he knows that Sarah is a virgin not being married or not anything so he's free to marry Sarah right anyway Abraham already told him that she was my sister so ack was excited there's no confusion there's no hindrance she's a virgin praise God and I'm going to marry him marry her but God knows everything that's right so that's why he he but a b he he said unto and he said unto me she is my sister and she even herself said he is my brother in the Integrity of my heart and innocency my hands have have I done this so he was honest amen right and God said unto him in a dream yeah I know that thou did this Integrity of their heart for I also will heal thee from sinning against me therefore suffered I Thee not to touch her notice how aimik thought it was his own restrain and Integrity that he hadn't touch s up to that point said the Integrity of my heart anyway he said that she was my sister but it was actually the Lord that had put a boundary on Sarah that we heeld him that's right amen God allow everything to happen even in your failure God still is on the Move God still is in control of the situation even though we fail and sometime we have failure but still God is in control of every situation praise the Lord now therefore restore the man his wife who he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shall live and if thou restore her not no thou thou shall surely die thou and all that are dying notice how this is to do with restoring this woman restore to her his wife amen there is a restoration message yes sir amen we are being restored by Malachi 4 amen unto our fathers Hallelujah and that is what this message of Malachi for was to commission to do this hour to restore all things restore the man his wife so there is an enforcer of the Covenant irregardless of their failure God don't look at the failure but God is enforcing his Covenant to Abra restore Amen to him his wife yes that's a powerful command that's right restore because he is the enforcer of the Covenant he gave the Covenant and he enforced his Covenant that's right so this SP King had no real choice in the matter but to restore her God was enforcing the restoration of Sarah to Abraham in regardless of their failure and of them outside of their rightful position right that's how God gave his Covenant yes when he died for us he don't take away anything it regardless of our trial as I said it is part of our blessing amen he always keep his promise thank you Lord Genesis 20:8 therefore aimik rose up early in the morning and called his servant and told those things in their ears and the men were so afraid and they had very reason to be afraid that's right because the judge of all the Earth was in the land to enforce the promise that he had sworn to Abraham and Sarah amen he is the enforcer he will perish if they will not do so this is all showing that he's doing this in the hour to enforce the promise of ab Abraham's Faith seed of the same one who had seen him reveal the secret of the hearts in this day and are between the coming of the Lord in human flesh just before the destruction of Sodom and the coming of the promised Isaac he is enforcing the Restorations of s amen and regardless of our failures God is enforcing his Covenant and one of these days hallelujah so don't look at our shortcomings you may fail don't get discouraged because your failure God is always in it he's trying to mold something he's trying to show praise God in the midst of your situation he is still in control amen even though how poor you are you are suffering whatever suffering you can whatever s situation God is still in control just walk by the revelation of the war as he said to Abraham I am the almighty God come and walk with me and thou shalt be perfect our Perfection is believing the word of God not in our works that we show or hard work that's why James said that work is Faith Express amen praise God so I will just finish this uh few verse and we'll be closing then a called Abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have I offended thee that thou Hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou Hast done Deeds unto me that ow not to be done right he was blaming Abraham because Abraham lied and Abraham said because I thought surely the fear of the Lord is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake so Abraham is honest enough to confess his sin we just need to be honest with God Amen if we fail we just confess and Lord I fail you Lord just give me one more chance just let me stand Lord in my plan I'm failure sometime I've been stubborn I I I do this and I suffer myself I suffer within my family but give me one more time lord yes amen and it came to pass when God caused me to wonder from my father's house that I said unto her this is thy kindness which thou H has show unto me at every place whether we shall come say of me he is my brother and aimc took sheep and oxen and made servant and women servant and gave them unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his wife and aimc said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleased thee and unto sarrow he said behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver beh behold he is one to thee a covering of the eye and to all that are with thee and with all others thus she was reproved 17 and Abraham prayed unto God and God healed aimik unto his wife and his made servant and they bear children and the Lord had fast Clos up all the wombs of the House of AMC because of Sarah's wife so he can open a womb to a seed and he can close a womb to a seed so if you receive the seed of the world is our it only because he has opened your womb and for no other reason so can we stand tonight amen God is orchestrating everything in our life we just need to recognize the presence of the Lord be honest and sincere and if you if you can see something in your life that's not pleasing unto the Lord you can come unto him Lord forgive me amen amen I want to be a better servant I want to be a better Christian just forgive me Lord give me one more chance amen sometimes I I overlook your goodness I overlook your kindness I overlook how you did to me I overlook that you are in our presence yes but when if we come in recognition God will use those people around you to bless you amen remember abik and Sarah he said behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver thank you amen God is blessing us amen but we need just to seek the kingdom of God first because everything that we need God knows about [Music] it we just need to walk and be perfect in his sight amen walk in the harmony of his Revelation and the Bible said that uh the the the message the sign of his coming the Bible said that Abraham's body was As Good As Dead As Dead that's right and Sarah's womb was dead but he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God Amen know that what he promised he will do that's the way we got to and his seed does the same thing his promised seed Royal seed believes the same thing amen because we are Abraham's seed If Abraham believed the promise of God and he staggered not of the promise of God and if you are the Seed of Abraham you will do the same thing Hallelujah now look she laugh and he said why did Sarah laugh there's his sign there's the sign to the church the call out Church a man human flesh eating chopped corn and bread and drinking milk did he do it yes was it God see if he isn't look in your Bible and see if it then show Elohim the self existing one Elohim in human flesh what's it a sign of eloh him back in the bride human flesh again in the last day doing the same thing where it that there your sign for the last day God manifesting himself in the FL and before we meet him the Lord there will be abundant change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there will be a change hallelujah what a promise we need to be encouraged by the word hallelujah don't be discouraged because our time as the scientist before the prophet said that there's or 10 minutes or 5 minutes before midnight but now the scientist says that we have no more time it only it it is only 89 second before midnight there's nothing left in this world they are groaning volcano there volcano here the Earth is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God there is Sons and Daughters of God in this generation and this Earth is groaning waiting shouting it's time for you to manifest it time for the sons of God to manifest praise the Lord God bless you Hallelujah that was good and forcer of the Covenant then he walks you all down through the scripture you begin to see all these things takes the types and shadows goes through the women re showing as it was with Mary as it was with Ruth as it was and goes on and on you begin to see those amen and Perfection comes by Walking with God in harmony that's right amen it's not you doing it it's God in you Paul says when you look at me Behold a mystery it's no longer I that live but Christ that liveth in me and the works that I do it's it's not me doing it but Christ in me doing the [Music] works since God has come down he's never gone back up Hallelujah that was so good when you see the dispensational changes God above us he changes and come down and God with us then with the Holy Spirit coming down on the day of Pentecost he came down and he said I will be with you even in you until the end of the world here we are at the end of the world and if you didn't catch what uh brother Mario was saying you know brother brandom refers to the scientists say 3 minutes till midnight 5 minutes whatever with the world clock the world time clock they said it is so close to the end of Destruction where 89 seconds wow hey the flashing red lights [Music] Hallelujah you see when Abraham got into action he hastened he hastened that's what we do when when we receive the angel messenger when we receed mzc coming down we begin to catch the sign what did it do it put you into action because if this message of this hour does not put you in action you're not elect seed and he hastened and he went and found his wife and she was in her position in the kitchen amen oh my when you begin to see this and God appeared unto Abraham and you see all of these appearing did you catch that God appeared unto him God appeared unto him all of the appearing of God appearing unto Abraham is the same type of all of the appearing of God to brandom in this end time but the promise was not it it was a covenant to Abraham but there was a part that God had to go he gave the promise to Abraham but it's going to be manifested in who in Sarah that's right so God had to move on her heart Hebrews 11 and he mentioned it several times and by faith Sarah receives strength somebody say strength strength when she receives strength power to conceive seed it's not just hearing this message it's conceiving it amen and what is it Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah when we begin to see all of this and then we realize it's quickened us Hallelujah quickened under power cuz God you know what he's doing right now he's enforcing amen the Covenant yes Hallelujah and I'm just like Ruth I'm resting huh he went beyond the curtain of time and what did we say we're resting on that Hallelujah amen amen I listen I don't know about you but I I so enjoy it when you come to the house of God you know you might be a little bit down discouraged or whatever and oh I'm a failure and I you know that but when you see God revealing himself through the word it quickens you and you say h I'm just like Abraham amen even if I tell a lie God's going to back me up I don't want you go out and lie now that's not but what I'm saying it wasn't God says I'm going to be with you even in you till the end of the world I the author and finisher of your faith I will finish it Lord God is determined to take you to heaven hallelujah hallelujah what's the name of this song goodness of God huh
