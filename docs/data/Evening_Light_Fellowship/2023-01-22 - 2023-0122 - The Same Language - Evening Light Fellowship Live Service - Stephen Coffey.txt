there's a lot of things we can do I've got a ton of hobbies this is my favorite place to be serving the lord with people who who actively pursue him and want to change amen praise the Lord God bless you thank you musicians and uh everyone it is just good to be here with you today it's such a pleasure I wonder if you would uh before we bow our heads let's read a passage of scripture if you don't mind so let's take our Bibles and read there wouldn't mind if you turn with me to the Book of John and I want to read in the um 17th chapter 17th chapter of the Book of John now this is one of uh one of if not the last this is one of the last prayers that Jesus prays and he's speaking to the Lord directly uh a lot of actually there's a lot of people who ask why did Jesus pray who did he pray to why did Jesus pray a lot of I've talked to a lot of denominational people and they'll say hey that's you know proof he's talking to God the father he's separating all these things I said well then why do we pray because the scripture says that it's Christ in you the hope of glory um he was praying to to the God that was in him he was God and he was praying and willingly submit himself to the word that was at work in him it's the same reason why we pray it's an amazing thing but he begins to pray in in verse 12. he's saying John chapter 17 verse 12 while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name and those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves and I have given them Thy word and thy world hath created them and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world verse 15 and I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep him from evil and they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth and thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee and that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou has sent me in the glory which thou Hast gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One let's bow our heads and just pray Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for the opportunity to gather into the to the to the just to gather into your presence as like-minded people Lord we're all pursuing the same thing I believe that deep down we all want the same thing and that's more of you so Lord we give this brief moment of time into your hands to do it as you please and I ask and I believe Lord but we ask because we know that you're here we know we believe that your presence is here we've gathered in your name so you promise that you'd be here but I ask that you'd speak to us however you would desire to to speak if you want to correct Lord make us willing to be corrected if you need to encourage us Lord then I pray may we be lifted up but may we have the courage to listen and to do what you want to say to us and so we give you that preeminence we give you that opportunity bless each one and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you can have your seats uh it is again just so good to be with each one of you here and uh so thankful to brother Ron and sister Sandy um I think they've known me for a very long time there's a lot of people in this room who have been Christians longer than I've been alive it's proof that God has a sense of humor I can't go anywhere without someone being there I knew you as a little baby and I think yeah and things have a way of coming around full circle um I was thinking brother Brian sister Patty it's good to see you all back there they know too much about me foreign a little bit scared about what they know that I don't even know I essentially grew up with brother Matt uh back there and a good friend of mine in charity and faith and uh their families and uh love and appreciate you guys very much it's just wonderful to see you um and then all the friends and just so many uh connections where the Joel sister Ruth good to see you all and uh just everyone I hope I get to shake every one of your hands but you know how that goes it doesn't always get to work out that way but love each and every one of you and it's good to be here with my wife sister Sarah glad that she was here and then her sister Lily and uh it's just been a pleasure to be with you all and to be here in this assembly in this beautiful church this is my first time in the church it's amazing it's beautiful it's fantastic you know but it doesn't I I genuinely believe it doesn't matter I I don't um I don't care I'll say it like this uh I want the Lord to speak to Hungry hearts and I have a Hungry Heart I know that you do we all have hungry Hearts we all need more of the lord we all need to be spoken to in in that way um and I'll say I'll say this I I don't really care how I do care but I don't care as much about the delivery that I have I don't care if we walk away from this building and you think oh brother Stephen it's just a good speaker it's articulate he's just good I don't really care I would rather the Lord speak to us in whatever way he would choose and I I really feel that that's my heart's cry is that I I don't care if you think I'm smart or not doesn't matter at the end of the day it does not matter what matters is at this moment I've been trying to do this in my my older age uh I've been trying to live each moment to the fullest because God gave us this moment you you may be sitting here this morning you may be depressed you may be anxious you may have all these different life decisions going on many are the afflictions of the righteous we're going to have those until we're gone out of this world so mine will we might as well get used to dealing with problems and situations but this moment in particular God has given us and we'll never get it back that may seem like a little bit of a cliche but it's true this moment God has given each one of us in this room you have a choice of how you'll spend it I have a choice of how I'll spend it we have a choice in what name we lift up so brother Stephen coffee can go fish I don't really care we want to lift up the name of Christ not about me it's not it's not even it's not about anybody else it's about Jesus Christ and him lifted up but he cares about you he loves you I really believe that he loves you so much and so he set this order Apostolic order of preaching and it's foolishness to the world it's a foolish thing that we do to stand here and to sit there and listen to a guy spit in speech in all things for an hour it's very foolish thing but by that he would choose to save them that belief to that mechanism he speaks to you and he lifts you up hearing but Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so as crazy as this is because this this is what we're used to this is what we do but to the world driving by they're thinking that's just crazy it's just weird and it is but by this the Lord would choose to lift you up he he can poke at you say hey I want you I want you to listen to this I need you to get this he can lift you up he can change you he can he can guide you and Lead You he can do all sorts of things if we give him half a chance so I say that let's do that today but you play a part in that so I'd ask you just to pull on the word of God let's just let's turn our attention to the word and let his name be lifted up can we do that amen you know I want to um I want to come back to this passage in John so keep your finger there I want to come back to it but I want to ask you a question I've been wrestling with with this question for quite a while and I'll be honest with you I'll be open and honest I'm still figuring out what it with the answer uh no I don't know everything uh I don't have all of the answers just I didn't know if you would know that or not so I just wanted to share that I don't know everything and I don't have all of the answers I've been wrestling with this question here's the question have you ever wondered why God confused all of the languages at the Tower of Babel why would he do that it's very simple it may seem like a very Sunday school type of answer and we can quickly say oh well you know he's confusing all the Earth they were building the big tower so they confuse the Earth and he scattered them all abroad you know all over the place so we can be you just assign that answer very quickly but I've just been wrestling with that question why did he do that so I would study for this service and sometimes as brother Ronaldo's telling you sometimes God will lead you and you'll just have just a thought you know drop in your heart and just all your notes will come together and things like that I I couldn't leave this question I just came kept coming back to it and kept coming back to it and I just thinking diff you know different directions and this is really this has really bothered me I'll say it like that why would God confuse all the languages at the Tower of Babel why not do something else why not um whatever it may be now I think the language part of it just to talk about that for a second we all speak the same language it's great right most of us will speak the same language some of us are listening through translators and I think translators are just some of the most amazing people on the face of the planet it's just amazing I think God uses them so monumentally but our sister Sarah and I were we had the privilege of going to visit a church in Tokyo a couple years ago and we rode the subway in Tokyo and you think New York City Subway was bad and I'm from rural North Carolina and so the subway is a hard thing for me anyways but then we get on the Tokyo subway and everything is in Japanese that was difficult it was very difficult so you're in a place where you don't speak the language it's hard for you to it's hard for you to get to where you want to go everything comes to a grinding Halt and that's that's just the way it goes when you don't have the right language I think also too even if you speak the same language you have a different dialect brother vasaki back there he's from rural Tennessee and people in Tennessee say they say Tennessee they don't say Tennessee uh you say Tennessee they say Tennessee so in the South you look at the different dialects and we all have different ways of of speaking and things like that I think you all speak the same out here uh I don't know but in the South we have different dialects of southern accent so you can be in West Virginia and they'll say well you get up in them heels and it is not up in them heels and then you move down further to where in Virginia and it's a little bit slower but yeah but you get up in them heels it's it's nice and then you go down to North Carolina and it's just it just slows down to you get up in them heels it is nice and then you go over a little bit to Tennessee where brother vasaki is from and it's appreciate you brother those those heels are nice and it's different accents but hey we understand each other you have different ways of speaking and all these different things I find it amazing that at one point on the planet we everyone spoke the same language so there was no barriers now there may have been cultural differences between the families and the parents uh you had all the different descendants of sham ham and japheth you had all of all of the variability within the family and the cultures that were there but everybody spoke the same language we're going back to that again in Zephaniah chapter 3 it says for then will I turn to the people of pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent so I began to realize if you go through the scripture and you begin to look at how important language is to the Lord he started out everybody with one language it wasn't just oh everybody should just speak the same language because it's easy there was intent because they could lift up their voice upon and call upon the name of the Lord with one consent so that was the intentionality behind one language so God confuses the language we'll go back to that at one point now in Genesis chapter 11 which is where God is is speaking about Babylon and he's speaking about um all the different things it says in the Hebrew that word he confused the language it's the origin of laughter it's uh the the feature of this I'm reading down just through the definitions in the Hebrew it says insulting Grimace place of the a bridle um a Divine speech quivering in Terror so when it describes the language it means a lot of different factors involved in it it wasn't just you know um I say hello and you understand hello or I say um hola and you say hola it was more than that it was understanding the the personality behind the language and the intent with which they spake so in the Hebrew that's what it meant the language and um I I I feel um when you look at this question of why God specifically chose the language um a few a few uh chapters before this God is saying I am done with Humanity I'm I'm done with Humanity the flood comes Enoch and and Noah find favor with the Lord and the flood comes and then they all come out of out of the Ark and they're there and shamham and japheth they go off and they uh begin to repopulate the Earth uh God says in in chapter nine I want you to go out into the Earth and repopulate it I want you to go in and regrow it so they go out and they begin to repopulate it but again they all speak one language so they were all kind of they were doing the same thing and then what happens is Nimrod who is the son of uh Kush and um the whole thing happens with ham and uh the curse was put upon Canaan and then cush was also the son of ham so Nimrod was the grandson of of uh Noah and you've got all this lineage and all these things happening and so Nimrod begins to assimilate a lot of people together into a unification so he he begins to get everybody together under the same purpose now it was it was interesting because he was easily able to get on everybody under the same attitude or under the Same Spirit or under the same systemization because everyone spoke the same language everybody understood one another but it wasn't just that they had the same vocabulary because they probably had different dialects and all these different things they were able to understand their intent so they were able with one consent to get behind the initiative that Nimrod set right if you think about it if I'm trying to get you involved in something if you um let's say I'm trying to communicate something to you and and you understand it in my language we can get behind that because you can comprehend it and understand it if we don't speak the same language and I don't understand you then it's harder for you to catch my intent and what I'm what uh what I'm understanding that's why I think that translators are just fast just amazing people in the kingdom of God because God will give them the intent of what the preacher says even though that may not be their initial language to me I'm thinking how on Earth do you translate the prophet of God but the holy spirit gives them the ability to do it and then there's people who are able to read what the prophet said in Kentucky English in their own language in kiswahili or whatever it may be that's an amazing thing to me now brother random teaches that um the the or the scripture brother random teaches of the scripture that the intent that Nimrod had was to build a name for themselves so they wanted to build a tower to the heavens and they had these certain kind of brick and all these different things but they want their intent was to make a name so they wanted everything to be underneath that name so it wasn't that we're going to make this name in defiance to God because the scripture doesn't say that what they did is that they made a name for themselves and the culture was a um a pluralistic culture in other words there was all kinds of idolatry that was happening in Babylon because that's the city that was there Babylon so brother Bannon would teach that the scripture says that Babylon did have a name for itself and it does have a name for itself spiritually right because you wind all the way up here today and you still have spiritual Babylon so they did make a name for themselves but it was almost a pluralistic society where you can have you can have idolatry over here you can believe this over here we can believe God as well we can believe all these different things but I want you to be unified behind this particular cause and so everybody comes down and everybody is doing that now the Lord said um in in the verses that um uh come out he says and the Lord said behold the people is one in other words they were unified so if you go down through the Hebrew I like studying the words and the Greek words and the Hebrew words partly because it makes me sound smart but just because you can gain a lot of perspective when you go down through those things and so the the word he says the people is one they are unified they're they've rallied behind this cause and they speak the same language so they can communicate it they understand each other's intent and they can get behind that very easily so the scripture shows that they did God says um uh uh behold the people is one they all have one language and they begin this they begin to do and now nothing this is interesting because God understands their potential that they have by their unification so they've got one language they've got one intent they've got one cause they're all rallied behind it and the Lord said we don't we didn't look at that and say that God said they can do anything they want to do amazing that God himself now just keep in mind that that a few chapters before the the Earth is still wet from the flood so he he had just taken Humanity off the face of the Earth and gave Grace to Noah and gave Grace to Enoch as a result but he he had just destroyed Humanity because his Spirit didn't strive with him so here again he is saying now they can do with this with this capability they can do anything they set out to do amazing Humanity can do a lot of things ever been below a skyscraper and looked up at it how on Earth do people do that it's amazing man is meant to achieve you want to achieve things brother Bannon would preach that many times he'd say mankind is they're just meant to do things they're just meant to achieve so we build skyscrapers we do all these things we build planes we by the grace of God we build planes we build automobiles we do all these different things technology advances men run to and fro and they do stuff you're with me knowledge increases so as men run to and fro and they do stuff they learn things and they adapt and they grow and they evolve and then things come about technology all these different things so he says they can do now nothing will be restrained from them and he says that they have imagined to do whatever they want to do they can just do it so he says let us confuse their language so he comes down and he confuses the language he literally separates the language apart so he creates a disunity now you might think well brother Steve I thought God was not the author of confusion but what he's doing is he's preventing Humanity from creating a greater sin when when Paul said that in Corinthians when he said God is not the author of confusion mankind was causing a disunity in the services that they were in so he said God is not the author what God sets forth to do he does not author confusion so he doesn't say yeah go and praise the Lord and have worship Services um because if we do that then you know there's some factions of that where they have snakes all up in the front and they toss the snakes up and they're called snake handlers so he doesn't say now just go and worship me and do whatever you want because we get craziness we get all different kinds of things so he says I want you to go and worship me and I'm going to fill you with my spirit and he'll lead you into the way that you should go so I want you to follow my word because I'm going to protect you and I'm going to keep you there's a lady in our church and she grew up in a snake handling church in the back Hills of Virginia and it was a total cult but they were they were worshiping the Lord they were worshiping the Lord and it was a total cult and they were tossing snakes up and they would let the snakes run all around the pulpit and people would um uh come up and if they get a wind of Faith they'd come up and grab the snake and throw it up she was a little girl little five six seven year old girl sitting in that sanctuary and said this is wrong there was something in her that let me just go ahead and say it she wasn't the same language wasn't there she wasn't speaking the same language she knew this is wrong there's something off here and so they're thinking oh we're worshiping Lord we're we're exactly where we need to be and the Lord said this is not what I had intended this is not what I said but they're saying oh no but he did because he said you take up serpents and they won't harm you and all these different things so they have they're listening to their own truth but they don't have they're not speaking the same language ever heard in business or um marriage where you're saying something and you just you're not getting it uh I don't have that problem I I don't I'm you may uh in your marriage where if you you're saying something or you're trying to get something across and you're just you're you're not it's not coming across or my wife is trying to tell me something that I desperately need to know and I'm just I'm just not getting it it's is you're not you we use the term you're not we're not speaking the same language you're not getting it you're not understanding it you're not comprehending it we're saying the same words we have the same vocabulary but I'm just not in I'm not catching the intent and now um that's exactly what was going on and so he changes their ability to communicate and breaks them apart so now these people with this language and this difference now they can't understand they can't get behind the same intention so he cause he allows the disunity to happen in other words they separate and they then they accomplish the word of God because he says go out into the world and and repopulate the earth I never said to come together and build this large city it says I want you to do what I asked you to do so to do it and and Nimrod pulls everybody together into a cause that is apart from that and so I I think they become unified behind that I think if those people if God was so intentional about having one language and then he he causes that disunity the the next time that the world uh will will be in that same kind of unification is in the full swing of the fourth horse rider right is when Satan has his full swing on the earth and everybody unifies around the Antichrist Spirit that's the next time that kind of unification will happen on the earth at that time we'll be speaking a different language praise be to God so until that time you have disunity on the earth and you won't have it like it was you just won't have it the Russians will the Russians will never see eye to eye with the with the Americans we'll never see eye to eye with the Iranians it's just you have disunity as a result of culture as a result of the intent that surrounds the language barrier you'll never have that but I began to think and as I ask myself that question why did God change the languages you begin to unfold to me if that's what they could do apart from the word of God imagine what people could do when they speak the same language of God and they unified together under that cause again because if he said if they spoke the same language and they were doing it against God and they nothing that they set out to do would be impossible for them then you begin to go back into what brother banham said and he said if we could all get in Harmony in that then the Rapture will go he said if we could all believe in the same way then there wouldn't be a sick one Among Us so I began to think what could it be if we all spoke the same language and we were able to come into Unity not the unity of our own cause or the cause of this church or the cause of this building or the cause of the cause of brother Ron or the cause of brother Steve but we all came under the cause of Christ and his Spirit lifted up imagine what could happen do you do you can you possibly imagine what could happen if we were all in the same vein of the Holy Spirit backslider uh no spiritual the one who's been in the message the longest the one who's been in the message the the the least if every single one of us regardless of respecting persons could be in the same vein in the Holy Spirit and he could deal where he wanted to deal change what he wanted to change I wonder what could happen it's an amazing thing to think about you know I also have learned I've been in the message all my life I grew up in a message church I've known the Lord for many years but I've grown up in message churches and I've realized this one thing that they're full of people and people are people they don't always uh that people don't always get along because people are people and when you have people that are people that hang around other people the fact that they are people causes problems and the fact that we'll never have the unity that they had of one language even if you speak the same language when people hang around people you have people problems and therein lies the issue and they're in disunity thrives when when Satan gets a toe hold and Satan moves in Satan has the ability to affect people you know you have a brain God created you with a brain and you have reason you have imagination you have all these different things so you can imagine to do something you can think about doing something and you can do it you can think in your career or you can think oh I'm going to build this house and you go and build it you do all these different things God gave you the ability to do that but Satan can use that as well Satan has Avenues to the spirit realm and he messes with your brain he's got the ability to mess with your mind God can God deals with your heart Satan deals with your mind so what happens is he he tries to get you to be thinking in a certain way you know you have memory you have conscience you have all of these different things and your memory is a is a is a real thing you have um it's uh it happens in your brain it's a physical thing it stays with you so even if you're saved and you're filled with the Holy Spirit you've been changed years later you can still think about what you did when you were a sinner because of memory it just it's your brain it's a physical thing so Satan can use that and say oh no no no no you you remember this way back here and then Satan can get in and he can use imagination and you can begin to imagine oh this is not really the way it is or this is not you know maybe I'm not as you know maybe I'm not maybe I'm I don't have the Holy Ghost right you could you you know the you know the drill Satan Satan uses that tactic against all of us and he begins to press now I'll say this I don't I don't want to ever have anybody thinking that they have the Holy Ghost when they don't but neither would I ever want somebody who has the Holy Ghost to doubt it when you have an experience with the Lord you know there's just something in you that you know he's changed you and he's he's molded you you don't have to doubt that and and uh God will never disbelieve himself so when you're sealed in there you're sealed in there I believe that nothing can take that away from you and there's an Evidence to that but I don't I don't um I don't think you have to doubt without a play around with with thoughts you can bring those into subjection of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul gives us the the ability he gives us the instruction on how to do it he says everything that sets itself against the knowledge of Christ bring it into subjection to to him so you bring those thoughts subject because it's not what goes into a man that defiles him or a woman it's what comes out so you can it can be thinking all different kinds of things and as we're talking to to the youth um that's what that's what Satan does he's really good at it he has nothing better to do with his time um he doesn't really have any other Hobbies that's what he does is he can mess with your mind so you need to understand that and even with things like depression and when you deal with depression and I've dealt with depression in my life and when you deal with depression it took me a long time to realize depression is worrying about something that has happened in the past in a very simplistic answer anxiety is oftentimes worried about something that's in the future right something that may or may not have happened so you can be depressed and anxious at the same time that is something that is rampant in in society is anxiety and depression so you can be dealing with depression when in actuality what's what depression is it can be an actual physical chemical imbalance right um it can be something that's actually physical but the Lord can deal with you with that he can help you he can he can allow you to overcome that I'm amazed at how many young people will cry themselves to sleep with anxiety because they just they don't know who you know is everyone is anyone ever going to marry me well yes that that may be what the Lord wants for you worrying about it and being in that constant state of fear is a is is of the devil he wants you to be in that state because God has something for you and he wants you to press into that he wants you to be unified uh into the cause of Christ so if you begin to think differently then you're going to wind yourself up in trouble down the road people can deal with depression and anxiety for years and years and years and not effectively deal with it maybe they don't know how how maybe they don't know how to uh answer they'll come to an altar again and again and again and and the preacher will say you you can be delivered of that and then they come and then they go home the next day right on Monday and they have to deal with the same circumstance that they left and that circumstance may be causing the depression so sometimes you have to deal with the circumstance in order to receive the Deliverance right in order to receive the the being made whole because it to to the leper that came back he said you've received your healing so did the other nine but I make the whole in other words he brings him into a whole uh new Deliverance of what's going on he makes him whole so that he doesn't have to deal with that anymore depression can can plague you and you you many times you have to learn Lord how do I bring that into subjection to you but there's power in that and there's power behind the Holy Spirit to deal with that but Satan can use your thoughts and get in your mind and mess with you that's what he does and so you you have to bring that into subjection now you can have imagination you can have all these different things but I God gave you those things so when brother Bannon was speaking about them and he said he Satan has five Avenues into the spirit realm God created each one of them Satan didn't create them God created them so God gave you an imagination God gave you the ability to critically think God gave you a conscience he gives you the ability to remember he he enables you the ability to hide the word in your heart so that you might not sin against him so God Gave You memory and you can use memory to the good you can switch around bad memories and say Lord you you allowed me to go to that horrible circumstance but I see what you've done through it and you can throw that in the devil's face and say Satan get thee behind me you shall not Prevail because the Lord took something that was ugly and he's made it into what it is today and praise be to God he's still changing me and I believe he'll still make something beautiful of it you may you may not feel like you're something beautiful but you are in the mind of God because he's still molding you and shaping you into whatever his image of beauty is for you and yours is not going to align with his so you need to align yours with his because you look at yourself every day and you know how you know how frail you are you know how messed up you can get and so if you look at that you're going to allow Satan to give you all kinds of things that you don't need to be thinking about when God said something completely different about you so align your thinking and your mind with his thoughts because your thoughts are not his thoughts to align yourself to his thinking you can imagine all these different things so I I wonder if we can all bring those things into the subjection of God what could he do with us I mean I'm just asking the question I think it's a fair challenge what could he do just in this room with us this morning if we could all just Lord I want to be in alignment with your spirit I want to be I want to be exactly where you want me to be right now you know you can you can receive the Holy Ghost even as I'm speaking to you you know that a birth is a mess but sometimes that mess can be uh a long period of time was for me but you can receive the holy spirit in an instant I believe you can while he yet spake they received the baptism of the Holy Spirit if you need life change you can receive it right now He's Able he's he's here dealing with each one of us and he can speak to you so you don't have to wait till the prayer line whatever it may be or however the Lord would choose to move he can do with you right now he wants that he wants to move you and to shape you and to mold you young people need to understand that the Lord can deal with you if you if you if you give him half a chance and so we have to be in that place of willingness that the Lord would move us and that the Lord would do this now here's the beauty of of being unified behind a cause of Christ is that you have to want it every dictator had followers every dictator has followers there's always going to be somebody to follow them Biden is going to have followers Trump is going to have followers who cares somebody's going to have followers there's always somebody there there's always somebody to come along behind it and get behind it you have a choice of what cause you get behind and I find and I fight this hard in in Even in our own assembly back home I I said I don't want you to be unified behind me I want you to be unified behind the cause of Christ because let's say you take brother Steve out of the picture who are you what cause are you behind are you just going to wander and hopefully find another church I don't want you unified to Brother Steve I want you unified to Christ to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ who is in our midst and he is the one who does the changing and the molding he is the one that should be doing the speaking so I don't want you aligned to Brother Steve I want you aligned to Christ let's lift his name up so it's not about me and my friends and this it's about him being lifted up and you need to align to that cause I don't I don't think it's good for you just to be in association with with an assembly it's never healthy for you to be so infatuated with the assembly that you're not actually in alignment with Christ what good is that going to do anybody now you'll play the part and you can oftentimes play the part really well I've known people for years and years and years in an assembly who are playing the part really well in other words they get behind they've got their shoulder uh behind that Ministry and pushing it and pushing it and pushing it as soon as somebody says something they don't like they are gone well this is not this is not this is not this and they they've you know pitter patter around back home I know we don't have it here but back home we have church hoppers and I'm not home so I can say it because I'm on the west coast so anything anything goes right uh back home we have church Hoppers and and you see these people and they're never settled they're never settled and I I feel like it's because they're seeking after individuals and not the cause of Christ and brother Branham said if we get people to the church we should be getting them to Christ I don't want to know what Paul or Apollos I want to know Christ and his name lifted up I want to know him in the power of his resurrection that's what I want to know and so people many times they'll pursue after individuals and then they'll get disappointed because people are people so if you get infatuated with me if you get infatuated with brother Ron brother Robert as amazing individual as he is you may be disappointed you may be disappointed it happens because people are people but through the foolishness of preaching God will put someone in your path that may just grab you by the lapels and Shake you a little bit and say hey I need you to listen up and then he may he may lead you over here he may lead you over here I I tell the people all the time um uh uh in our assembly I said I want you to be in a church where you're happy and you're fulfilled I want you to be in that I want you to be in that assembly if that's not here tell me and I'll help you move I will help pack you up and I will help move you to that church wherever the Lord is leading you you make sure that the Lord is leading you to that church and you make sure your reasoning is right but if he's leading you to that assembly and everybody was just you know like what and I never heard that before I said I want you to be where you are going to be spiritually Fed so if you feel like that's a church somewhere else go and I'll help you move I feel the same way I don't want I would never want to put my family somewhere where they would not be spiritually fed I want them to to be as fulfilled as they can be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so that's that's what we do as as Believers and we need to unify into that not just the assembly because you can be unified in the assembly and receive the benefit of being in the presence of God for the Bantam explain that all the time you under you understand many many different places you would say you can be in an assembly you can be and the rain falls on the just and the unjust so you can be in a really healthy assembly and actually not be anywhere you need to be with Christ you can be so far off from a personal relationship with the Lord that that that cultivates fellowship with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ you can be so far off of that and be so alive in the church be so filled and be a part of it and active and all these different things and be so far away from the presence of God what good does that do anybody God wants to fill you the unity between the church and the bride is not between the church or between Christ and some bride group it's between Christ and you you are the bride personalize it so don't say it's between me and the bride out there is between Christ and the bride out there as if you're outside of it he's come to you the voice of God is speaking to you in this day Christ this is who I am I want you that's what he's saying that's what the message of the hour is to me is the voice of God speaking to me and if he speaks to me he'll speak to you so don't sit yourself outside of the bride of Christ run into it and say Lord I want you to speak to me I need it personalized I don't want to be outside of it in an assembly that's wonderful and thriving and not being the person of the Lord Jesus Christ I'd rather be filled with the Holy Spirit knowing that I am in I am in him and he is in me that's exactly what Jesus prayed he said I pray that you would not take them out of the world leave them there because in the world is the mechanism whereby they can be shaped and molded and changed and all these different things so leave them there but I pray that you keep them from Evil and the method whereby you will do that is you will make them one as you and I are one so the unity that that Jesus Christ had is the same Unity that you can have with him and it's not just with an association with the church or personality right I always tell everybody you don't don't be so caught up in in brother Steve or his personality because I'll disappoint you I'm a people so I'm going to disappoint you so be caught up and Associate yourself with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and he will in turn place you in that assembly and you will Thrive you'll be such an on fire member of of the of the Assembly of God because when you get the the vertical right the horizontal will work itself out all of the scripture is speaking in the New Testament Paul is speaking about Unity with the church that you may have Unity with your brethren that you may keep the bond of of Peace uh which is Charity the bond of unity which is Charity which is love so the thing that holds the unity together is love so he said keep that but there's a different Greek word that's used there as it speaks about the unity between you and Christ it's a totally different word the word that speaks of unity in the scripture and I don't have time to go through it um is is the word that speaks of unity in in reference to your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ is all about Fellowship and and the relationship between Unity with the Brethren is about love and patience and kindness so it says you're going to have to be patient with one another because you're all people and people be people so when people be people you make sure that you're in alignment with the Lord Jesus Christ first and foremost and then he'll bring unity in The Bride of Jesus Christ Brethren among brethren when you switch that then you're going to get yourself into trouble because what I find a lot of times is that people will try to create Unity first and then bring the Lord Jesus Christ into the picture so they're trying to you know get Unity together and get all these things together and and um I'm amazed at how God brings the bride together um uh brother Ronald just use you and me you saw me grow up and I'm you know I'm um I know a lot a lot of you you've been in the message longer than I've been alive and you know things that I don't know you have you have a knowledge set you have an experience set that I'll never know but the Lord is over here working in my life and the Lord's over here working in your life I doubt there's I doubt we would agree on 100 everything right we're just different we're different guys the Lord has called us different things um uh we're just different guys so we may not agree on 100 everything but in in areas of Doctrine and where the Holy Spirit wants us aligned he'll bring us into an alignment and we can have Unity on the basis of the word even though even personally we may not may not agree that's a beautiful thing and we have that yeah and I pray we always keep it amen amen and it's the power of the holy spirit that will do it people and people in the assembly the same way the unity is not just in agreement right the unity is in your alignment to the holy spirit that brings your understanding of the knowledge of the Lord so as you grow in Grace and in knowledge the scripture says the spirit of wisdom and a revelation will work according to your knowledge of him you may have different knowledge than me at this point in time I may have different knowledge than you but the spirit of wisdom and a revelation that's working in and amongst us will bring us right into an alignment with the spirit of Truth and he is this he is the truth Jesus said I am the truth and the life and the way so it's not your truth it's not my truth he is the truth and where there's the truth will set you free So within that there's freedom to be ourselves but we're going to come into alignment with the word you can't follow one scripture while breaking another so you can't say well yes I believe in the word and then and then a sister go and say well I can trim the ends of my hair off right that you're you're adding something in there it's not according to the word so we're not going to have unity in that there's going to be all kinds of different uh feelings on these different things the Holy Spirit wants us to bring us into an alignment with his word and so unification happens and it can happen when you have alignment with the Holy Spirit first I find that all I've seen it many times even myself um in our in our town where I live years back there are all kinds of um just disagreements Between Brothers and all these different things and for a long time Believers wouldn't even talk to each other in the same grocery store I know you don't have this problem out here but back there we we it was it was it was legitimate it it happened and years and years and years and years of of those disagreements and back and forth and back bitings caused that separation between Believers now I believe um God has a way of working everything out to his purpose and you never I always look at something you think man that's a horrible thing and it's um it's exactly where God wants it to be and you think oh it does not make sense oftentimes what the Holy Spirit does not make what he does does not make sense and so people are in the grocery store not even talking to each other and I uh there was a when I first became a pastor at the church I said Hey Brother so-and-so is having meetings um I'm gonna be there let's all go and they said what it was a foreign concept totally blew my mind no we can't we can't do that we can't do that at all I thought man what a shame and it's taken years and years and now people from that assembly are going uh to meetings and things like that and it's like you know what let's let the Lord have his way where that's concerned and I want Unity with the Holy Spirit and let him create the unity amongst us because if I manufacture Unity then something's going to come in and disrupt it if I can convince somebody into something someone is going to come right along behind me and convince them out of it so I'd rather be in alignment with the Holy Spirit and let him set the foundation and let him be the Rock and then the unity happen as a result of that alignment because if someone is shooting off over here and I want to be right in alignment with the Holy Spirit I want to be aware of that because the scripture says know those who who labor among you discern those things and be aware of those things be wise as serpents and harmless as doves and so we want that kind of unity in the Lord Jesus Christ now brother Branham he said many different times he said in 58 in the unity of one God in one church he says there is what God wants you filled with he wants you filled with the Holy Ghost and then you'll be United so brother Brown taught this from 58 all the way to 65. he preached it from 47 all the way to 65. and he says um what to a church no sir you'll be United what to agreed no sir he says you'll be knighted you'll be United to God he says in your in you and him will be one and he and his father is one he says and then God's holy spirit will live in you and the same works that the Holy Spirit performed when it was here in Christ Jesus shall be performed in you for he said it he would do it then we are one now he said in 1958 in the Oneness of unity a different service he said God wants people to be one and it is strange to think but the devil tries to put his plan into existence and make all the people one under his plan so God wants unification Satan wants unification as well so Satan wants to disrupt the unity that you have with the Holy Spirit he wants to mess with that but he also wants you to come under Unity to to what he's doing now in the same service a little bit later brother Venom he says and if you will get behind it is the same motive that was at the Tower of Babel to build a man-made Earthly Dominion he said if you get behind Satan's desire for unification he says it's the exact same spirit that led everybody with the same language the same unification to get behind that he says instead he don't want you all United under Rome he don't want you United under any church Dominion he wants a United under his spiritual Kingdom the Holy Spirit that's where we find Unity now I find many times I want to just switch over here just for a second to the Book of Exodus and I'll just paraphrase for the sake of time the Israelites are there they come out they're wandering around and they come to Mount Sinai and I've always I've always wanted to go I want to go and climb Mount Sinai um maybe you'll come with me I've always wanted to go up to the top of that mountain here's um Moses and here's the raw power of God come down on top of that mountain the lightning the Thunder the light it's just the wind and that's that's God down there on top of that mountain and Moses goes right up into it he walks right up into it he's considered a friend of God he walks right into the raw power of God not an amazing concept here's the people of Israel and they're down there and they're they're they experience it it's so powerful that they can't even look at the mountain so here they're praying not just chapters before they're saying Lord we want you to come we want you to help us we need water we need all these different things and they're saying I want you to help me I want you to to bring us to the promised land and now here God comes down God himself and then Moses comes back down and they say Moses we we can do this you speak for us don't let God speak directly to us we want you to speak for through uh through him uh or him to speak through you because we literally can't take the presence of God so chapters before they're saying God we need you and we want you and then a few chapters later God comes down and they're saying oh but we don't want him that close so they they literally draw back and they say no no no we didn't want this this is not what we signed up for we didn't want this it's you're way too close back up a little bit Moses you speak for us and so God says okay he says okay I find that a lot of times many Believers will say Lord I want you I want Unity I want I want you to I want to be United with your spirit and then he'll come down and speak to you and you back up and you say oh I want him that close I don't want him dealing right there he comes down and he starts messing with your marriage to try to make it better and sometimes it needs to get things need to get hard before it gets better sometimes we need to let down our stubborn Natures because people do be people and just let some instruction in and let it burn a little bit let your pride down and just just be wrong once in a while and God might be able to work in your marriage think critically about that it matters it matters to your children so stop fooling around and let the Lord deal with it and it's going to hurt it may hurt it may really cause some pain but oftentimes people say I don't want them that close and so the holy spirit's moving and he's he's in the place we say Lord I want you to move but you don't want him to move in that area and you never know the Lord may want to deal with this area over here before he deals with this area over here before He blesses you over here he might want you want you to deal over here you can be so successful in your career and be spiritually stagnant and be blessed and have all the money in the world doesn't mean anything money money God's got plenty of money money doesn't matter obviously we need to pay bills it matters God will give you exactly what you have need of sometimes you need to let God deal in the areas and just because you're being blessed and you've got a great job and all these different things does not mean that you are spiritually where you need to be so you need to think critically about where you are at and let the Lord deal with you because the children of Israel asked for him to come and speak to them and move them and bring them into unification to lead them into the promised land he comes down and they say oh and I didn't want that if you want to break through with the Lord you've got to be Willy willing to get close to him and let him get close to you because you might not like what happens when he gets close to you you might push back on a little bit because you you can be messed up you can have situations in your life that need serious dealing with especially young people you can you can be in a place in your life where you're we're talking about it Friday night where you can be apathetic you can say and you need to own that and be real with yourself and say brother Steve I am just not into the service I don't know what's wrong with me I'm just not into it I'm apathetic to whatever is happening around here so if you're raising your hand and you're saying yes Lord you know I want you and you're getting into the music and all these different things you can be sitting there and thinking I am feeling nothing I don't even know what's going on around here you need to own that because the Lord knows about it and you need to deal with it you need you can seek after the Lord because the Lord is very clear he said if you draw near to him he will in turn draw near unto you but when he does draw near to you you need to let him get close don't be afraid of that and don't push back on that because that's how he is going to bring you into Unity with him so his process of bringing you into Unity is Jesus Christ sitting there Lord may they be one as you and I are one and there's nothing in between Jesus submitted himself to the word that was within him he had the power to raise up and to lay down and yet he willingly went to the cross and he laid himself down by the word that was in him he let the word work in his life he wasn't afraid of it he submitted himself to the Lord because he and the Lord were one and he wasn't afraid for the Lord to get close and to do the work that the Lord needed to do so he yielded his vessel to the Lord and said have your way not let this let this cup pass from me if it will but your will be done not mine he would teach his disciples pray this not mine will but thine be done on Earth as it is in heaven and so we can pray yes I want the Lord's will on Earth as it is in heaven and then the Lord gets close and said you need to change this and we'll say oh no no I don't want him to be that close or I'll deal with that I'll deal with that in my own time you realize that demons and spirits they're real they don't they don't want to leave they do they they mess around because they don't have anything better to do and so they mess with that which has life so they're going to try to mess with you and your children in your family and Satan and his army is going to try to come at you with everything that he's got and try to mess with your mind and mess with your brain it's what he does but greater is he that's in you that's he that than he that's within the world so you have all of the promises of God behind you through the power of the Holy Spirit and when you live in the power of his resurrection you can by his grace bring unto subjection that which sets itself against the knowledge of God but when the Holy Spirit comes and tries to consume you and take you and and and do something in your life you have to let him you have to you have to let down the bars and say Lord I want you I I invited you I asked for it let me have the courage to receive it you know there's a lot of things in my life that I've dealt with and I've realized I am the one that's holding myself back brother Branham said the same thing he said if I can get the guy in the mirror if I can get that guy and bring him into subjection to the word then something will happen in that guy's life and so some of the greatest things that I've gone through is when I've come to the realization that Grace and humility coincide and at those points in my life God has done something great because I was I I don't want God to Humble me I'd rather humble myself and you you when Grace and humility coincide that's where God will deal with you that's when God dealt with a prodigal son the prodigal son was at a place of humility and he had never been in his life and at that point Grace coincided and his father was running out to him and said I want you I want you back and his son was saying I'm not even worthy and his son was walking right up to his father's house boldly before the throne of grace at a place of humility where he realized Lord I I don't want to hold back anymore I don't want to sit in the Hog Pen anymore I want to let you in in order to have unity in order to have the unity that you that you really want you've got to be willing to let God close you've got to be willing to let him come and sometimes it will it will burn a little bit especially young people this will happen multiple times in your spiritual lives the new birth produces the Life of Christ in you it is the screaming kicking baby that the birth produces that baby grows it changes it evolves that life that's now produced is the Life of Christ that it learns it it becomes intelligent a baby doesn't just stay a baby it grows it it goes through hard knocks it goes through all these different things it becomes intelligent it becomes uh it learns things and adapts to its environment it grows that's exactly what God is doing in your spiritual life he's changing you he's growing you he's adapting you he's he's bringing his word to pass in your life and One Sweet Day there's a promise that's overriding the Bride of Jesus Christ and we'll be gone in the moment of a twinkling of an eye that promise is already inside of you and it's the word it's the holy spirit in your life that will bring that promise to pass it's not it's not you making that happen the Holy Spirit and the promise that God said and set in order before the foundation of the world is going to come to pass because of the word that's inside of you you have to yield yourself to that process yield yourself to the word that's inside of you because the greatest of mysteries that would be given to the Gentiles is simply put Christ in you the hope of glory now brother Branham said in 1959 and he said a reaction to an action I love that title he says now he's talking about the the meetings that he was having he says and I think it would be good for prayer meetings to be going on all day long around here just everywhere for you cannot get anything from God until you get close to God so brother Branham says this he says now you've got to get close to the Lord many times we have trouble with that maybe because you don't know him as you could now I find that a lot of times if I have a relationship um with one of you Brothers brother Enoch and I we have a great uh I think we have a great friendship we don't hang out as much as we should we need to change that but uh we know each other we're good friends now we we can come into a relationship and a relationship is a little bit different than Fellowship because um I can come in I can know brother Enoch's name and I can say hey what's your name you know what do you do what are your hobbies you know all that kind of stuff and we can know each other on a superficial level and have that relationship so if I um if somebody says do you know brother Enoch I said yeah I have met him I know him and I I know of him and and things like that and they say what is his greatest heart's desire and I said well I don't know that I mean I we haven't you know spent weeks together out in the mountains maybe we should uh that would actually be really cool but you know we I haven't spent that much time with you to know your heart's desire right what does brother Enoch want what does he want to do with his life where does he want to go I don't know that because I haven't spent that time in fellowship with him because when you're in a relationship you know each other you know of each other you know about things you can you know we can talk we can hang out but if we come into Fellowship together we're coming on a whole new level we're actually developing a Unity together because we're understanding what drives you and what drives me what problems are you facing he can be vulnerable in a fellowship with me if he if he learns to trust me and if I learn to trust him I can share things with him I have I have a you have a fellowship with your spouse I have a fellowship with Sister Sarah I don't have with anybody else because she knows me she knows what I'm like when I get off of the pulpit she knows what I'm like at home she knows how I treat her at home nobody else knows that we're in Fellowship so she can help me in ways that none of you can help me she sees things and can talk to me in a way that none of you can do because we're in a completely whole new different area of relationship we've come into fellowship with one another we know one each other we we we get on that's what you that's what God wants with you is a fellowship you young people you have to believe that you don't have that right now no problem he'll give it to you he'll bring you into fellowship with him and don't you for a second think that he doesn't want that with you he does want that with you that's why he died on the cross and rose again and sent back the holy spirit so that he could be alive in you to show you how much he cares about you to show you the Redemption story in the last day today which is why it's such a special moment that before the foundation of the world I had set my voice to speak to you in this day to tell you who you are and that's just to the oldest just as much to the new because I think you can be old and still struggle with fellowship with the Lord you can be old and have gone to a message church for 50 years longer than I've been alive doesn't matter you can know him in a fellowship but a lot of times it's harder because you've developed patterns and things like that in areas of comfort that you don't want the Lord to come across maybe you've got areas of stubbornness that you don't want the Lord to come across he can deal with that don't you tell me for a second that the Lord can't teach an old dog a new trick because it says behold all things in Christ are new all things are passed away so don't tell me that he can't still deal in your life if you're in 80 90. he can deal in your life and he can bring you into a fellowship that you never thought was possible regardless of how long you've lived so it's not just to the young it's to the old just the same God doesn't want you just in mere association with an assembly he wants you to be in fellowship with him he desires that more than anything else Jesus himself prayed it Lord I pray that you make them and he's praying for you that should make them one as you and I are one so why would we fight against that why would we fool around with that and dance around it I say we step into it and say Lord I want that fellowship with you teach me how to do it give me a life give me a show me the process how can you make me to know you in the power of your Resurrection that's what I want I don't want to fool around just with the doctrine of the message of the hour I want to be the message of the hour that's what I want in my life if I really am the only Grace that the world around me will experience then I pray that I would be able to give a hope to the calling that was made sure in me so I need to make my calling an election sure I need to know and in order to do that you have to let the Lord get close to you when you invite him if you profess Lord I want to know you in the power of your Resurrection then you need to be willing to let him close to you and deal with you and change you and mold you and shape you because he promised he would don't think for a second and he won't do it in your life whatever it is you Lay It Before the Throne boldly and say Lord I want you to deal with this and I will have the courage to respond in whatever that looks like yes you might not like what it looks like we were talking on Friday The Greatest Adventure that you will ever have is following the leading of the Holy Spirit he will lead you to do things lead you to say say things that you never thought you'd be doing my father is a is a pastor um my grandfather was a pastor so everybody looked at me and they said you're going to be a preacher and I genuinely in my heart I said not on your life I said I I will not do that because I know the hardship that a pastor goes through I know what I know the toll that it has on him and his family and I know that that's difficult and I know that that that's a pressure that I didn't wish from my wife I didn't wish for any of my family and the Lord had other other things in mind it's been an adventure and it's an adventure that I want to I want to press into I want I want to have that adventure of the holy spirit because life is just a breath it's just a moment so whatever you're dealing with whatever depression you have or anxiety you feel like you're worthless you've got an adventure waiting for you that may seem cheesy true it's into that press into that Adventure that he he wants you to have but you've got to be willing to let him close if that means you need to run to an altar and say Lord I I want that from you then run don't stop run if that means that you just need to raise your hand and say Lord I I I'm just I'm dealing with apathy I want you to I want you to feel me I need you I need you yeah maybe you have kids and you're thinking oh Lord I need to I need to get myself right so that my kids will know the power of the Resurrection because I you need to be real with yourself enough to say that my kids are they're probably not seeing in me what they need to see so you can deal with the Lord can deal with you on that and you can be in unity with him in a whole new level of Fellowship that you never thought possible and in turn he'll deal with your kids lives he'll answer your prayer but you need to get yourself in order so that he can work in other areas of your life it's an amazing thing brother Branham says in order to get to get anything from God you got to get close to him what kind of people are we professing to be if we're not letting the holy spirit all the way in brother Banner said we should be the happiest people on the face of the planet but I wonder how many miserable Believers there are absolutely miserable Believers people who believe the message of the hour and they're just always down and always out and all these different things do you do you know what you believe do you know what we have in our hands do you know what the Lord Has Done in this day and when you really grab a hold of that it's a personalization remember the Lord is speaking to you you are the bride you are the one you are the Redemption story this is not you out here and and the bride over here that you are the bride he wants you so you have to personalize that and you have to say Lord you're speaking directly to me you have spoken to me in this day and I'm listening to the voice you have to let them get close 1963 God deals with an individual not with groups now brother Brandon was dealing with denominationalism but that denominationalistic Spirit can get into the ranks of the message and cause that associative attitude while I'm associated with The Message Church young people especially maybe because you haven't met the Lord in the in the way that you can I don't know whatever it is but you can have that associative attitude of well if I go to the camps if I do this if I go to the altar when they have the altar call if I if I really believe you know and do this thing then I'll get this so it's a fast food window mentality especially in in that Millennial uh gen Z generation because I go I put them in my order I go up to the window I get my food out and then I go on that's good um I deal with road rage and I'm just being honest I'm being vulnerable I deal with road rage and when you go road rage translates really well to a fast food window so if you go to a fast food when you order your food and then you have to wait or something and and just it just I I the Lord tests me in those lines and that's the kind of society that we have so naturally it's going to affect your thinking so you may be have an associative kind of attitude with the message of the hour and you don't even realize it filled with the Holy Ghost and you've got this attitude of if I go to church I put in my coin I get the thing out and then I go and that's that's a shameful way to live and everybody may live like that but I don't want to live like that you don't have to live like that because the Lord is not a coin machine or an Aaron boy that you put your coin and you get your feeling out right or you get your oh I feel great because I was at the altar and then you go home and you're struggling with the exact same things that you've been dealing with for 5 10 15 years not happening in my life I don't want to live like that I don't know about you but I serve a powerful God and he has enabled us to overcome in this day and if he's promised me that then I want that Adventure so I'm not going to play patty cake with the devil I want to get serious and I want to let the Lord close what a challenge God wants fathers he wants mothers he wants young people he wants grandparents he wants you to be in unity with him he wants you to know him in the power of his resurrection and I know that there are people in this room who don't have that as much as they would want to have it you can have it listen to my voice you can have that relationship with the Lord that you want you can come into a fellowship with him that you never thought was possible you're looking at the sum total of your complexes you're looking at the sum total of your parents complexes you don't have to live like that you get to determine your relationship with the Lord and you get to determine to come into fellowship with him because it's on the basis of free moral agency God God has predetermined that you would come up to the knowledge of the truth God has predetermined and predestinated you to stand on Jordan's cold Banks but he says whosoever will you can come across it that's that's how it's a free moral agency and it just kind of it dealt with me one time it got predestinated that you would come to that point but he doesn't Force anyone into the holiest of holies he never forced anybody across Jordan's River he said here's Jordan's River you can come across basis of the holy spirit is on the basis of free moral agency he leads you to the truth but you have the choice of walking across maybe you've been filled with the Holy Ghost for years and years and years and you know that but you're dealing with something or perhaps you've fallen out of a relationship with him and you want to restore that you can have that today you can have that you have to be willing to let the Lord close the reason I'm not exactly defining that is because it may happen differently for each one of you it may be here this morning it may be as you're driving home it may be on your way to work tomorrow as you're driving you're just thinking about different things that the Lord wants to get close to you it may be a week from now that you're dealing with something and the Lord wants to press into you a little bit and and touch you and and and shape you you have to be willing to let him close this right now is not your only moment because he's he's gonna If he if the Lord tarries and he gives you tomorrow he is the same yesterday today as he is tomorrow but don't wait till tomorrow let him get close to you and what that is is it may look differently for each one of you the way that the Lord deals with me and presses into me and gets close to me it may be different than you I'm not a very emotional person I don't get emotional some people are really emotional and that's how they respond that's how the Lord gets that's how they deal with them that's how they that's how they act and that's you have to respond to the Lord in the way that he's pressing into you don't worry about who's around you that doesn't matter a lick they may be dealing with something worse than you and you responding to the Holy Spirit could change them in a way that you never thought possible so don't hold yourself back from letting yourself into the presence of God let yourself go let go and let God have his way you know many times we pray for Unity and we pray for it and we want it we ask it and then when it comes we say oh no no that's I didn't think it would look like that I don't want it and sometimes that can be with us that can be with the Lord the Lord wants to be one because Jesus that's what he prayed his prayer over you and Isaiah 55 is very clear the word once given shall not return void so the word will have its way I say why stand in the way let the let the word have its way in our lives if we are the message if we are message believers then let's let's let the Lord have his way if we really can be some of the happiest people on the Earth I want to be happy I don't know about you so let's be happy brother Venom he said in the statement one time he said down with Satan and his Gloom and up with the Lord Jesus in faith that's the way I look at it I say down with Satan and his gloom and up with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ you don't have to be depressed that's not just a cliche or a statement greater is he that's within you than he that is within the world you don't have to deal with anxiety anxiety is nothing fear is nothing it's a fabulous element but there is substance to our faith it is the reality of the things that are unseen so they're a substance to your faith so down with Satan and his Gloom and up with the faith in the Lord Jesus Christ you don't have to be someone that feels like they sit on the outside and look in God has come to you the voice of God is speaking to you in this day you can let God close but when he gets close don't say no no I didn't want that let him in let him deal with you whatever it looks like let him deal with you bow your heads with me musicians won't you come I want to pray with you and then the musicians come here brother Robert Come and sing just with your heads bowed I I there's probably not one of us in this room that feels like they're they're finished they're done being worked on all of us we have we have we know that there's things that need to be worked on so thank the Lord that he doesn't change but praise be to God that we can so let's just pray and let's let the Lord have his way and you can make this moment personal I'm not you don't I'm not asking to respond in any specific way because this is the holy spirit dealing with you so you respond to the Holy Spirit and how he's leading you you talk to him interact with him he's here he's a real person you can know him in the power of his resurrection you can be refilled you can be you can have the joy of your salvation restored whatever it is whatever need maybe there's no specific need and you just want to be in that presence then just let the Lord speak to you cultivate that that reality that the Lord deals in the lives and hearts of his of his people Heavenly Father Lord I've got my I've got my hands raised I want more of you I want less of me and more of you and what I've I've in my life I've prayed for years but I want you to be close I want you I want to I want more of you and I don't I want to come into Unity with you I want to know you more the Lord cultivate in me the willingness to let you close sometimes I don't like it and I'm willing to to say that to admit that sometimes I don't like it it's uncomfortable being wrong receiving criticism changing I don't like it but it's necessary so Lord if you need to do that in me if you need to have my wife speaking to me and me listening if you need to have uh which I know you do if you if you want to speak to me in whatever way you would choose may I listen and have the courage to follow through on what you said I don't want to stagnate Lord I want to grow in Grace and in knowledge Lord I want to be delivered of the things Lord there's so many things that we deal with lust even depression anxiety maybe there's healing that we need Lord you promised healing you promised healing you said you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you said you are the Lord that heals all of our diseases so what may we claim that Lord you you said that you'd help us through in in in the difficulties you would be a present help in the time of trouble so Lord I I pray that you teach me to know what does that look like what does that mean teach me to wait Lord teach me to know your sheep hear your voice and another they will not follow so Lord I want to be in tuned to your voice I want to know you and the power of your resurrection and have a fellowship with you that will hold me that's an anchor that will not allow me to be tossed to and fro by everything that the world would throw at me I want to be anchored I want to be solid I want to have that life I don't want to just talk about it I don't want to just believe it Lord I want you to make that a reality in my life so let me let you be close let me get out of the way let me let you close [Music] Lord may your presence have its way in our hearts may you speak to those who need you Lord maybe there's those who need the baptism of the Holy Spirit Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever you can fill anyone with the Holy Spirit Lord if they have they are the desire for it so Lord may it may if there's someone here seeking that may they press into it Lord maybe they don't know you at all Lord may they find you today may they just say Lord I want to know you I just I want you I want to know you Lord maybe there's someone who's dealing with whatever it may be may we boldly come before the throne of grace Lord and say Lord I need you I need you Lord right now would you just speak to our hearts Lord sweetness of your presence may we just yield ourselves to you may we really truly do that so that we can have Unity with you that was Jesus's prayer Lord concerning us I believe that it is possible to me we have that [Music] deal with our hearts Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] I keep it all to you [Music] know I Surrender my life [Music] amen [Music] I believe that God can speak to hearts in such a simple way and I believe that what brother Stephen said was solid stuff was good stuff take inventory of Our Lives oh God I want you to come down I want you to draw an eye but not not that close [Music] huh the guy in the mirror we can say that's me both that's me one saying not that close [Music] you understand he said why did God confound their language because what he did they could achieve anything [Music] because they're made in the image of God so God comes down can confuses their language and they are no longer unit unified under nimrods understanding his intent and he said people are people did you guys catch it huh now I'm sorry but you found out some of your people people got problems and people to get with other people got people problems and you have to deal with people issues now he said that the vertical Unity will take care of the horizontal Unity that's what the cross is all about you get right with God you get right with that Unity between you and God and the horizontal will find its balance [Music] I got to thinking about this language because the this message is actually a language [Music] we speak a language different than denomination [Music] it has within it a voice behind a voice it has an intent there that others cannot catch but when you hear it there's something inside that all of a sudden you catch the very mind of God the intent [Music] and that causes you to come into a Unity with God [Music] this message language actually brings us into the unity of the fellowship are you understanding that it'll bring us to the true Unity with God and create that total Fellowship that God had with those in the beginning Lord help us to hear the voice Behind The Voice amen [Music] I have a special prayer request this morning as a pastor I'm going to lay before you my daughter went to the doctor the other day she'd been having some stomach issues she's been diagnosed with colon cancer I go on Tuesday her mother and I go to Steve to speak with the oncologist and the surgeon but it is a darkness that has been placed before us and I'm going to ask all of you to be in prayer with us but as a pastor even my own family is not without the trials the issues but I believe that all things work together for the good to them or are the called according to his purpose didn't say it would be good didn't say but God will use it because God can use all things to work together for the good so I would like you all to remember my daughter Rebecca in prayer may God have his way in her life it is the goodness of God the Bible says it leads you to repentance and you know I've been praying for years oh God whatever it takes and now I don't want to say oh no oh no that that's a little too close I say draw me nearer Lord let my heart first be checked let me say oh God sanctify me consecrate Me O God amen so I wanted to share that with you you are my family We are family together and one one member suffers we all suffer so I wanted to share that with you I hadn't shared it with anyone outside my immediate family until this morning [Music] so I just request your special prayer brother Stephen you did a tremendous job this morning [Applause] [Music] I'd like to sing a song before we go because I believe it's very fitty once God sends his word out there it becomes a challenge to you then you have to have the courage to say okay I see something now give me the courage Lord to go ahead and do something about it I identify the problem how many of you can say amen amen I identify the problem now help me to have the courage to deal with that issue let's sing that song change my heart oh God oh God Is that the name of the song okay and brother Robert get your your amen yes because maybe it's your heart maybe is there something right there in the channel maybe there's a room there's a closet there's an area that you have just never let him ah lordy close but not not that close [Music] and maybe God is dealing with you in a very special way every one of you he deals with you uniquely because you know what you're all different so again I don't use a cookie cutter if you got to do this and you got to do that no what you do God deals with you uniquely the way it's dealt with you from your youth onward it's the same way he will continue so if he spoke to you in a special way you see this area then say Oh God give me the courage help me change my heart oh God yes Lord make it ever truth that's my desire God bring us you've given us a message language that we all speak and if you don't think it is in a different language talk to somebody out there that you talk about predestination election elect seed they got no idea you're speaking Greek to them what it is it's a language this message is God's language to you to let you know who you are and where you're from you're a part of him you always have been and you always will be amen now God deal with us come close yes Lord come come close and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put my hands up and say that that's too close let's just sing this song and take a moment today is his day this is his time I don't ever want the word to have you
