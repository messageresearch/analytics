bless them they've been gone for about three months or something like that you guys have gone forever see you know I told my kids I never took them on vacation and now my kids have taught their kids yeah yeah anyway praise the Lord are you glad you're here amen Genesis chapter 11 if you would thank you musicians thank you sister Bethel for your your song special I appreciate it each one using their gift how many of you have ever had God speak to you from a song huh absolutely God will give somebody a song put on your heart they sing and guess what you got touched maybe he got delivered maybe got healed whatever you know because what it did it cause you for some reason to get into that and believe that God is uh God was speaking to you amen amen so Genesis chapter 11 verses 1 through 9. and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to and let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they had for Mortar and they said go to let us build a city and a tower whose talk May reach into heaven and let us make a name lest we get lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men building and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they began to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from fence upon the face of the Earth face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the languages of all the Earth and from fence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon all the face of all the Earth amen turn with me to the book of Zephaniah one of the smaller books there just past habakkuk and and everything you know sometimes I have to look and find that because when you look at those Minor Prophets there you go nahim have a cook there's Zephaniah uh hag guy you know I've never preached from some of these um smaller books but I'm taking here uh uh from Zephaniah 3 verse 9. if you're there Say Amen all right for then will I turn to the people of pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent may the Lord add the blessing to his word you may be seated this evening amen some of our visitors still hear from Canada God bless them grants Keys freezing Amen brother Jim each and every one of you God bless you now as we read this scripture you all know that the founder of uh Babylon was nimrod is that Dan back there too I said yeah you snuck in your bed you told me next time you're gonna let me know you didn't that's all right you're gonna have to take me to lunch or something to pay for that all right um where was I said nimrod he was founder of Babylon brother Brown talks about how that nimrod and we see him of the lineage of Cain and brother Brown said you want to know where civilization came from he said modern day civilization is uh is from the lineage of King and uh so uh brother Stephen Coffey when he was here he he touched on a similar subject on this here and he had preached about God confounding the language I thought that you know that's interesting and he said something and he mentioned the scripture there in Zephaniah so us Brothers uh we've gone from The Golden Boys to the Over the Hill Gang now to the table of the Gods it really is something these guys are amazing so anyway they're on Monday morning these Brethren got together and we got to talking about one language we actually got to visit about this and they said what was that scripture in Zephaniah and Zephaniah 3 and 9 and we begin to read it and we were just kind of going over this and we began to kind of discuss this topic and I thought well that'd be interesting so I went ahead and researched it and I think it'll be a blessing to you um this evening I pray so um revelation is what God uses to make his word known to you for faith is a revelation faith is an illumination faith is sight faith is you being able to understand God's word otherwise it's a sealed book so any of you that catch the understanding of the mysteries of God what God is doing is he's giving you understanding and that's what he does with Parables he does something in the natural okay referring to something spiritual but the disciples said why is it that you always speak to the people in parables and he said to them it's not given he said but to you it's given that you might see these things so understand that faith is the illumination that God uses to make his word known to you to your understanding faith is catching what the spirit is saying the word pure in Hebrew because it we took Zephaniah and said a pure language what does a pure language uh what does it mean it means all cleansed it means all refined clearly polished pure purged and I thought isn't that what the Holy Ghost does when he comes in where who he comes into our lives and he gives us a new language because the Holy Ghost comes in and purges you and takes your old conversation the way that you spoke before gives you a new life huh Hallelujah it gives you a new tongue a new understanding praise the Lord yes so it is a refined or pureed language from false doctrines and teachings of mystery Babylon now I wish to make a little bit of a parallel on this this evening um and Revelation is also what causes you to come to God's provided place of worship brother Branham said without understanding where God has placed his name he said because in that name and that name alone is where God is provided a place of true worship and faith is the key also that unlocks the door of the scriptures and Christ is that door and faith is a victory that overcomes the world so God has sent to us a message in this end time and it's become the language if you please of the redeemed bride the message is God's love language that he's sent to you because he sent you a letter and brother Branham said you read the letter from somebody that is your sweetheart or your lover and he says and you read between the lines Hallelujah are you catching where where I'm going with this that this message is God's love letter to you as a Believer because you're catching that which was unspoken those mystery secrets that he's he's giving to you in your ear in your ear alone Hallelujah so without faith it is impossible to please God neither can you understand God because the carnal mind is enmity with God neither does it know the things of God someone else and perhaps that's a unbeliever or whoever you're sharing with them something that they look to you like you're an alien that you're speaking a language and I want you to understand that this message is a language that very few people understand but you that are the initiated you that are have caught the Revelation what God's doing we talk about predestination it goes right over their head they can't understand talks about election the election word birth those things that is we have a secret language you talk to a denomination right over their head they can't catch it why it's another language because the message is Christ and Christ is the word and though many heard the voice of Jesus speaking to them it was only the elect that heard what the voice was saying now when we look at the word voice it actually in the Greek word is phone p-h-o-n-e just like we have a phone and it says it means the sayings or the language or the understanding of what is being said to voice yourself actually means to express your thoughts by using vocalization now brother Brenham says in the sermon voice of God in the last days he says God has promised to meet the need of the hour and he always and he always does that how many of you know that he said he said the end time message will meet the end time conditions so I don't want any of you to think that any of you are shortchanged that that you were born out of due season I should have been in another no you are here in this age and God has given every one of us that care package of his word to get you to the resurrection amen he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and today one reason that church is in the condition that it's in is because there's so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God till it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right in their midst they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day God has a voice that he's using today amen even as Elijah heard a small steel voice God speaks in many various ways as I told you he can speak you through his song through a friend through his sickness through a circumstance through dreams Visions reading the word preaching the word through a pillar of fire through a whirlwind or even a donkey but by the most popular way is by the foolishness of preaching but until you hear the spirit speaking you may be religious but you're not spiritual you are not spiritual until you're hearing what the spirit is saying to the church I would guesstimate that the vast majority of people in Christendom today that claim to be Christians have never ever heard what the spirit is saying to the church but you're different why you have an ear to hear you have heard what God is doing in this sea many are merely outwardly religious people they've been programmed by Church systems and Creeds and dogmas and they depend on others who they have put their faith in that they will tell them what to do and we're not careful that same type of mental programming will come right into the message listen I don't want you to learn this message I want you to live this message I want you to catch the revelation of Jesus Christ because Revelation to your soul is what transforms you huh from Earthly to Heavenly from Marvel to immortality in thy seed shall possess the gay brother Branham said um I could point you Assemblies of God people that's got deacons on their board that's married two or three times preachers carrying on women with their hair cut wearing shorts makeup still professing to have the Holy Ghost depending on the evidence of speaking in tongues or jumping up and down and shouting they failed that still small voice of the word amen they failed one thing they had all this other stuff but they failed what was most important to cause their lives to get changed and that's to hear what the spirit is saying to the church unless the gospel we hear is mixed with faith it'll do us no good is it possible for us to hear his voice and failed to catch the meaning failed to understand what the messenger is saying I'm quoting John 16 verses 12 through 16. Jesus speaking I have yet many things to say unto you now to say unto you but you cannot bear them now be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth understand that that the Holy Spirit brother Brown said is the Divine revealer of the word of God now Jesus was speaking to his disciples he said I'd love to tell you of great and wonderful powerful things but you cannot bear them now be it when the time comes when the Holy Ghost comes that Divine revealer he'll reveal unto you all truth amen show you things to come those things I've spoken unto you in Proverbs with the time coming when I shall no more speak to you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the father this message is become becoming clearer and clearer and we're not talking about removing the static and the background noises from the tapes we're talking about clearer understanding we're talking about something that's no longer a mystery we're talking about God coming down by way of the Holy Spirit and by the maturing of the Bride she's no longer a little child amen she's a full-grown woman and she has virtue and character and you watch her and she catches what her bridegroom is telling her Hallelujah that is this time now there's an unveiling of God is no longer hid in parables he's no longer hid behind a veil of mystery why the mystery of God has been revealed does it not say in Revelations 3 and verse 20-22 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant him sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches for you to be able to perceive to understand to catch it I look up the word perceive in Hebrew it means yada it means to know properly or to ascertain by seeing it by understanding the ability to know or understand by way of Supernatural instruction Hallelujah do you realize that when you're catching Revelation when God gives you an epiphany of his scripture what it is you're actually catching something that God himself is giving to you and what he's doing he's speaking lip to ear somebody say Amen amen let me show you an example of Jesus speaking and he very openly says why do you not understand me in Saint John 8 verses 43-47. why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word now they're hearing his voice are they not they're hearing the vocalization they're hearing the language that he's speaking he said but why don't you understand my speech because you can't understand my word because if you understand the logos thought of God you're going to catch my thought why because the things that I'm speaking to you are coming from him you are you up your father the devil the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning a boat not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speak of the light he speaks of his own for he's a liar and a father of it because I tell you truth you believe me not which of you convinced me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god listen to this he that is of god he that has begotten of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god wow no wonder they wanted to kill him and crucify him he said you don't understand my speech because you don't understand my word they didn't understand the voice behind The Voice they didn't understand there was a sign but there was a voice behind the sign are you with me stay with me now because some heard the voice but they failed to understand because they looked at the veil and many times brother Branham says that we miss what God is telling us because we got too much concentration on the veil and he said it is the human Veil God help us to preach tonight that the human Veil is what keeps you from hearing from God so much of the time God help us go Beyond the Veil amen many heard the voice of Jesus Christ but very few heard the voice behind the veil very few heard The Voice Within The Voice God give us Revelation and understanding in the Serpent's Seed brother brennam says this and I want you to turn with me now over into the Book of Genesis of the third chapter if you want to know anything I can show you in the Book of Genesis where every cult and every ism and everything that was got right today begins in Genesis Genesis means beginning we find the Catholic church in the beginning Babylon nimrod the founder we find it in the middle of the Bible we find it in the last of the Bible and we find trying to bring in women preachers in the beginning of the Bible by worshiping little statues made out of roots how many red his slops Two Babylons the history now I tell you what brother Branham did some reading and brother Branham would take history alone to prove and if you read hislops to Babylons he makes the comparison of the old Babylon its ways how they worshiped what they did to mystery Babylon okay and he began to show you the idolatry of Mr Excuse me of ancient Babylon Now understand we have Babylon is in Ruins it is archaeologists have to dig it up to go find it but there is another Babylon that is alive and well today and we by spiritual understanding realize that it's here mystery Babylon and you remember when Jacob stole his father's gods and his daughter hid him under her and took them out there in the wilderness which defailed the camp later on okay earnestly contending for the faith hang on I'm going somewhere understand that when a minister preaches to you he's actually taking you somewhere so I want you to follow along on this journey when Babylon first appeared look at it down through the Bible Babylon appeared back there you know Nimrod built Babylon first Babylon was called the Gates of Heaven then it was called confusion there's where idolatry first started Nimrod was the son of ham which come back from the son of Cain and watch them Kneads as they come up watch what they bear watch the actions they take and we're plum in above the skies with it the crop has grown up oh I hope God soaks that way down deep now so you can get a foundation I need I and I see something moving up now I want you to understand God confounded a language back there in Babylon did he not he did it for a purpose because the people were United together and whatever was upon their mind in the imagine of their heart they could do so God said lest they do that let's confound their language and because he confounded the language they had to quit building the city Now understand spiritually speaking Satan is not happy with letting that go because his seed is still doing the very the exact same thing and I wish to show you that here in just a few moments now he confounded the language so they didn't understand one another and I want you to understand if God's going to return us back to a pure language he's going to redefine a refine it he's going to make it to where we understand it we're all in one Accord in one consent is that right in Acts chapter 2 verses 8 through 12. when the Holy Spirit come down now how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthenians medes elamites Mesopotamia Judea Cappadocia Pontius and Asia virgin pamphilia in Egypt and he goes on Libya about Cyrene strangers of Rome Jews and proselytes Creeds and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongue the wonderful works of God now I want you to understand when the Holy Ghost came down upon those Believers he gave them a language the Holy Ghost is a Giver of God's language that language is faith they were speaking under divine inspiration the wonderful works of God so what language is it faith some people say will it be German or Russian or Hebrew or whatever even over there in Romanian Hungary one of the Romanians said I think it's going to be Hungarian because Hungarian will take a lifetime to learn it correctly because with you are we gonna all speak English over there French kishwahili Burundi I don't know I know this that you won't have to learn it it'll be there some didn't have to go to school to learn English Adam was born and when he when he began to speak the Breath of God gave him life gave me moderates let me tell you that's what God does with you when he gives you life he gives you utterance won't be something you have to go and learn and learn the tensed and uh dirty Doss like in German or in Spanish you know the masculine feminine and neuter I never learned that with German how do you tell if that table is feminine neuter or masculine they said and I thought well tell me you guys are German everything is calculated they're organized they go by the rule and he said we just learned it by memory I said well thanks man I can't even there's no rule anyway so what I'm saying they all began to hear their own works of God in their own language though they knew these how were galileans now some of you that are from a foreign country now and you speak a dialect our sisters sitting right here on the second row they have a earpiece in their ear and we have a translator in the back room now I tell you what they would their eyes would get wide open if all of a sudden they heard me speaking their dialect because they would know I don't speak dear dialing so I want to just show you some hearing questions and answers they ask a question at one time were we all white or colored or or two which one of the curse was put on as far as I know I can't tell you that's what he said I don't know and it really doesn't matter white brown yellow black don't matter I kind of tell you as we come of all one language and one people until the Tower of Babel a confusion and then their language is went different and as as far as We Know they were all one people till that time and they broke up and Scattered in different parts of the world so when the people were scattered into different parts of the world they were all broke up because of language they couldn't understand one another so what God is going to do in this end time he's going to restore us back I'm going somewhere with this now just hang on don't freak out God is going to bring the elect seed back for a rapture and he will send them a pure language in other words it's going to be re-defined it's going to be refined it's going to be circumcised the Flesh of man and the knowledge of man is going to be circumcised from it and you're going to have a pure word Hallelujah do you understand Hallelujah he had to pull brother Brenham away from hislops to Babylons from Clarence Larkin and pre niacin fathers and had to get him into a room by himself Hallelujah and the empty out his own thinking and the Holy Spirit by way of angels coming to him and those angels broke to him each one came and gave him the revelation of each seal first Angel first seal and so on so that language is the language listen to this that the Holy Ghost speaks revelation is the language of the Holy Ghost can you accept that because when he speaks to you and he's giving you Revelation it's his voice and he's showing you something so the voice you're hearing is the language come on come on now so what he does now remember in Matthew 24 verse 31 he will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his leg from the Four Winds and from one end of Heaven to the other in Ephesians 1 9-10 having made known under the mystery of his will remember he's making known the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven are rich in our Earth which are in him this message is what is causing the bright believers to be gathered together until they come into the unity of the faith and faith is revelation is that right this message is not an Earthly message it's a Heavenly message it's not an Earthly language it's a Heavenly language and if you don't think it's so just start trying to explain to different ones what you believe you might as well be speaking Greek amen now watch this Prophet Elisha 1954. I'm going to read just the highlighted portion for the sake of time our nations are polluted our dumb democracies are Torn to Pieces and broke up and are the kingdoms of the earth is to be Torn to Pieces but there's one Kingdom that we believe that is coming soon the Lord Jesus Christ is set up an everlasting Kingdom and all the nations of the world that Sade will live in that Kingdom that we want flag one nation One People speaking one language and that's a Heavenly language you like that listen it ain't gonna be English or German or French or Swedish it's a Heavenly language what Heavenly language does the Holy Ghost speak he speaks revelation the Oneness of unity they want them to speak one language he talks about Germany and Russia just like they did in Babylon they are one language and he wants all to speak one language they want them all to be you to be one United person but it will never take place under man's Dominion but I'll say this there's coming a time when all nations will be United together under one king and that will be Jesus Christ God's son and they'll speak one language there'll be one in heart and one in purpose you see good what God is doing he's giving this bride from down from the ages all of them he's speaking his Eternal Word which is a language oh yeah it's god making himself known it's sharing his mind he's sharing his understanding with you you Lord Hallelujah revelation of this man's message is making us all speak the same thing say what I said on those tapes I don't want your opinion I don't want you yeah I want revelation amen foreign ation to non-seed you might as well speak a foreign language talk about having a word birth you speak a foreign language talk to them about the voice of the seventh angel It's All Greek tomb foreign language they don't catch it but the moment that that elect seed begins to hear the word of God God's thought what is it God makes his word known to them you know what he's doing his voice his language and the Holy Ghost making it known to you what is it the language of God comes to you by God himself and he is The Interpreter of his own word here what hears thou Elijah the man wants before tried to build a tower to get away from the Earth and God just didn't give them any Unity I think men today are trying to build these towers to get over to the Moon they're setting Yonder now with all kinds of conferences with no Unity they can't even speak one another's language there's one language that we all ought to know that's the language of God about what I'm preaching it's a Heavenly like it's a Godly language there's one language you ought to know and that's the language of God God's love for one another and Brotherhood among men and when we learn that kind of a tower that kind of a language there'll be a tower let down from the heavens watch this that'll take us away to Glory that'll be Jacob's Ladder that God will let us climb up someday hallelujah what is it every rung goes higher from justification to sanctification to the restoration of the gifts to the adoption to the glory we once had with him in the beginning hallelujah what God is doing allowing you to climb Jacob's Ladder out of the abundance of the heart the Bible says that the mouth speaketh when you catch revelation of this message it causes you to speak God's language faith is God's language that the Holy Ghost Believers speak I had somebody wearing a mask the other day I don't know about you I don't only don't like wearing a mask but I can't understand the people that speak through the mouth foreign I don't speak mask anyway now in the sermon law watch this now it's strange thing that this so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say because you're just talking his language right there when you dealt and I believe that's the devil's language but when you have faith that's God's language must have never speak the devil's language let's sit here let's get rid of these negative thoughts whatsoever things are pure whatsoever Things Are Holy think on these things amen so if the devil's language is doubt and unbelief then faith is the language that the Holy Ghost is bringing to every believer he's a Divine interpreter of the word be certain of God and if you could only grasp that this afternoon that his goodness to that little woman now watch this finish or whatever she was last night to be sure that her faith would be recognized he called her in her own language yes now overseas many times we see that happens in foreign countries that I'll be standing speaking and I'll turn right back around and use my language and call the people in their names and everything just like it does here in their own native language That's What I Call Pentecost I believe it that's the Holy Spirit you like that let me read it again all right let's read it again I'll be standing speaking and I'll turn right back around and use my language and call the people in their names and everything just like it's done here in their own native language now he's speaking like they did on the day of Pentecost well that woman whether she was Finnish or whatever she's hearing it watch this watch this you talk about a Google translation when you speak now and you're under the blood God hears your voice but he said when it goes through the blood it changes and it becomes his voice so it's not you making intercession for yourself it's the oh my God my God help me it's the Holy Ghost inside of you making an intercession for you hallelujah it's a language do you know that moanings and groanings within yourself it's a holy spirit inside of you making intercession for you I hope you're enjoying this because I'm enjoying preaching it listen carefully now since the confounding of the languages in Babylon man has sought to be able to speak each to each other in one language so they're devising another Tower where that everyone can speak to one another it's a scientific man-made Tower of Babylon and any of you know that the computer is a language all on its own it's called a universal language they write applications they do this and a man in China his computer can can reach up and what link up with one in Russia and though they speak different languages and under these two computers by what is called a computer tower do you see a scientific Tower creating the world to come under one mind one consent perverting their minds getting them they go into the internet and these Souls talk to one another and it's all over the world it's going global where are they getting it from another Tower they're building just like it was in the days of nimrod modern day nimrods are again building a tower in the midst of mystery Babylon everyone's connected to it and causes them to come under the unity just a carnal in person for impersonation of what God is doing in the spirit they're scientific and educated Minds have built a system of one computer language call them it has caused them to call and come into a false Unity of the same mind and they say that that when you are hooked up linked up now I'm sorry I'm not a computer person thank God for that but when you are hooked up you're under the influence of the cloud but the bride has been linked up under a different cloud you like that a different cloud and when you come under there depending on how sensitized you are some of you only have one bar can you hear me now holy spirit talking can you hear me now you're not praying like you should you're not reading like you should you're not sensitized when you start praying all of a sudden it goes from one bar to two can can you hear me now yeah loud and clear buddy I got you somebody say I got you that's what the holy spirit's wanting to do with you sensitize yourself to the Holy Spirit somebody say I'm under the cloud amen which cloud that cloud the cloud okay the message is a pure language that has been restored back because God circumcised this message from all kinds of man's ideas denominational teaching Creeds and dogmas with the opening of the seals and how do you do it with a sharp two-edged sword amen you like yeah you like that we're gonna take it a little bit further is this okay now watch this in First Corinthians 14 talking about languages and here it is gifts in the church follow it's verse 1 St Corinthians 14. follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you might prophesy now stop here for a moment because Paul said do all speak with tongues do all prophesy do all have the gifts of healing but he said God gives gifts to you severally as he will he said tongues is the least of the gifts and the one most easily impersonated see my tide time my tie told you that before first time went to a Pentecostal church and the guy told me just just Babble that's what he told me just babble and I yeah so he I I said I don't know how to babble he said see my tight time I die I said see my tie tie my tie he said say it faster Timothy Hallelujah here's another one that got it what a joke what a false Deception come on brother raise your hand just praise God thank God you got it say you got it you got it you got it I ain't got it and that caused me to backslide because when you sincerely by somebody telling you that that's it and when your expectations are not met and he doesn't give you the holy ghost or if you think that's the Holy Ghost you think there ain't much to it that's why don't ever let some preacher get you all wrapped up in some kind of emotion some kind of thing because you jumped shouted you spoke in tongues brother Branham said I've seen witches and wizards do the same thing drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil God help us amen listen to me now verse 2 but he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaking not into men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it the spirit speaketh in Mysteries but he that prophesies speaketh on demand to edification exhortation to comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself let me just stop here for a moment because people have asked me brother Ron do you speak in tongues yes I do do I have a gift of tongues yes I do how often do I do it not that often but I'll tell you what we've been here and we've been having worship Services right here and I start speaking in tongues right here and I have to say that while I'm speaking in tongues I'm not doing it that it might be an interpretation I'm speaking unto God self edification I'll tell you what some of you need some of that right now yes I speak with tongues but I'm going to show you what the Bible says I would that you all speak with tongues but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth then he that speak with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying now brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine then he goes and things with with uh without life-giving sound pipe harp I'm not going to go into that go to verse 11. therefore if I know not the meaning of The Voice I shall be unto him that speaketh up Barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even so for as much of your zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you meet Excel to the edifying of the church wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he might interpret for if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is fruitless unfruitful First Corinthians 14 says verse 18. I thank my God I speak in tongues more than you all get into the church do you like that he's showing you yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also then ten thousand words in an unknown tongue Brethren be not children and understanding how be it in Malice be children but an understanding be men some look at talking in tongues is a sign of God's blessings and that we're that that is the Holy Ghost isn't that exactly what what the the false doctrine of Pentecost says false evidence and he said it was the genuine Holy Spirit on your spirit he said it is the Holy Spirit he said the jumping the shouting it's on your spirit doesn't go to the soul because many people do that and they do all of those Sensational things and he says and her soul just as black as night and on their way to hell don't base what you believe or your evidence of the Holy Ghost because of some emotional thing amen easiest to impersonate the Bible also says First Corinthians 14 wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all fun things be done decent and in order so we don't forbid to speak in tongues my wife has a genuine gift of tongues and she also has a genuine gift of interpretation of her own tongues this happens several times in her life in fact the first time shortly after we're married in Sandy excuse me for using you because you don't like it when I do we had been married just a few weeks and she was not in bed and I reached over and I thought where is she I heard some music in the front room I opened the door and when I went out there and she was on her knees and she had her hands in the air and she was singing in tongues see I don't have you ever heard someone sing in tongues she was singing in tongues now tongues is an actual tongue it's not stammering lips it's not bad though we understand and I'm not trying to impersonate something but it's an actual in fact you hear the enunciation you you hear it spoken and I had heard it often and she had heard it often and one day we were in the Flagstaff church and we had a man come from Israel and he spoke Hebrew and they asked him would you pray at the beginning of the service in Hebrew put his hands up he began to speak in the Hebrew tongue and chills when all over my body Sandy she got all stiff she looked at me we looked at one another and she said that's my tongue now saints of God there are tongues and I don't need you to raise your hand but I know that there are many of you in this congregation that have spoken tongues but we don't point to that and say that's the evidence thank God that I have spoken tongues thank God that he does it forbid not to speak in tongues but the prophet also said let everything be done decent and in order and when the prophet of God began to put the church in order it caused a split let me show you and they could what's called La Celia which is the gifts of tongues and it's actually because you have justification sanctification and you have the restoration of the gifts glosselia it's not just tongues but Pentecost has said it's the evidence that it's the Holy Ghost well there are more gifts of the Spirit than just speaking in tongues are we together on that let's be Bible believers now when the prophet of God began to put it in order and make people accountable is when they all got real shook now I'm going to show you here excuse me I'm going to take some time tonight I'm enjoying this and I don't want to have to wait until another couple Sundays it preaches to you go overtime tonight you're getting your money's worth tonight all right a lot easier in church age then there's all this talk about glossalea it's supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of Holy Ghost and people are thinking that we're in the midst of a great Revival Revival's over America's had her last chance in 1957. now the tongues are God's sign of impending disaster even as they were when they appeared on the wall of belshaser's feast he talks about Lord Lord heaven we've done many wonderful Works in thy name cast out devils and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you Matthew 7. Jesus said they were workers of iniquity you get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil blood appearing in the congregation prophecy coming forth and all manner of the supernatural and the people will gather around him and swear that he's of the Lord even though he's actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin the only answer they have is the absolutely unbiblical answer of well it gets results so it must be of God how terrible how actually poor is this age in the spirit of God and the poor poverty-stricken ones that don't even know it my the third poll is a separating pull Junior Jackson pulled away from Brother Branham because he set the church in order concerning tongues here it is questions and answers 64. I don't know I don't think my brother's here tonight but somebody made fun of somebody leaving the Tabernacle went down to brother Junior Jackson's for a church said they went down among the dead birds aren't you ashamed of a remark like that ever who you are if you're my kid here in Christ I'm ashamed of you don't do a thing like that Junior Jackson is my brother Don ruddle is my brother Don ruddle also split well the reason of it because when I set the church here in a certain order well I come back to see if I could get the manifestation of the gifts half of them pulled away look at that half of them pulled away from it because when you start to speak or preach or something it was getting to such a place you could hardly preach unless there was somebody spoken tongues somebody interpreting somebody given the interpreting half of it never even come to pass now brother Brahm said when uh tongues and interpretation is given that's a prophecy is that right he says to prophesy is to foretell a future event it is not repeating scripture it is not well wishing it is not saying what the word is said now let me give you an example of that all ye my people if you will hear my word if you will harden not your heart if you will seek me with all thy face if you will get on your knees and pray if thou will humble thyself before God will they not show you what my will is to you will I not pour out my spirit upon you and on and on people that's repeating scripture brother Ram said he said no it'll be something like don't go home tonight on I-10 because there's going to be a bad wreck and he says now we got one that speaks in tongues one that interprets it and you've got three Elders that judge it is that of God I want you to sign hey Jonathan you think that's of God here son my brother you think yeah okay you guys sign it you're Elders you thought it was of God and it don't come to pass then what oh oh my goodness he says not only the one that spoke in tongues the ones that interpreted but now the elders that wrote their name said you got a lion devil among you that said thus saith the Lord said this was the spirit of God and it won that's why brother Graham said half of them never even come to pass you know why because it's just reiterating do you see what I'm saying come on we are not we're not babes we are elders we have raised up we we come out of Pentecost we saw those things those Saints they're real they're genuine they're genuine gifts but when they put them in order that's why Paul said look I'd rather I speak them in five words of a known language than ten thousand words unknown tongue now watch this I told her Brendan there's Witnesses here that know this I said let it alone after a while we'll find out whether it's of God or not they cannot stand chastisement then it's a bastard child exactly what the Bible said and when the test my chest went come what happened did I tell you that long ago asked to pass here well what about this and that just let it along they're babes we can't judge it but watch when it really comes to pinned down to the word Junior Jackson has a right to disagree with that he wants his church the people wants to speak in tongues and things in the audience that's brother Jr's troubles that's up to him but Junior Jackson believes this message the same as any of the rest of us does he's one of us it's not a dirty bird to go out there tenure Jackson is a man of God that I love with all my heart and it's and it's not here tonight so I can really pour it on the way I want to next quote he's saying we are called unclean Birds because we go to Junior Jackson church sometimes he don't comply with the new church rules here at the church are we out of the perfect will to attend there at times no sir Junior Jackson be a man of God I've already explained it now we don't agree with the order of the church and I want to say that ministers are absolutely the worst when it comes to disagreeing with them because we're supposed to be able have you ever read the quote we can disagree bitterly as far as East is from West but when we get done we're still Brothers put your arm around no hey you're out disagree with me Hey listen brother Brigham said my wife and I disagree huh he says I like apple pie and you know she likes whatever and he likes to put calf slobbers on it and all of that hey come on You can disagree and I'll tell you and each one of you understand this you can disagree with one another bitterly but brother Branham said I would rather have a church where the Holy Ghost is bringing forth Godly brotherly love then all the gifts you have in the Bible so let me see you manifest the the love of God when somebody disagrees with you well brother God bless you I certainly don't agree with that you remember what those men did when they came to brother Brandon because we're going to lay hands on you because you you got all this false Doctrine we come here to help you because we disagree with your doctor he said well go ahead and pray for me they prayed for him and guess what God increased his revelation be quick too agree with them right so God gave him Revel God gave the prophet revelation and you know what they when they left they said well he sure has the spirit of Christ God help us to have the spirit of Christ instead of somebody disagree with you and you get all puffed up you got to get upset and stop that that's nonsense that's childish let's do what he said let's love one another he said one says he's coming on a white cloud the other says he's coming on a white horse who cares as long as we agree he's coming amen God help us he says we may not see things eye to eye but we stick together that's him but now watch this he's calling them brother and let's stick together but did they stick together with him no he Church ordered himself right out of the Holy Ghost where are they today okay now you see when he corrected the heir of the gifts operating incorrectly people broke away from the prophet and left the Tabernacle it was the sword of the spirit because the Bible says Hebrews 4 12. and I'm bringing this to a close hang on I'm going to go quickly kind of like that that you ever been at the mall and you put the penny out there and it goes it's gonna drop here in a second word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder between Soul and Spirit now three compartments of the human being Body Spirit soul and this sharp two-edged sword has the ability understand this to discern the difference whether you got the Holy Ghost on your spirit or on your soul what did it the word when the sword of the spirit was placed in the hand of the prophet he was up there in Sabino Canyon he thought it meant the end of his ministry he thought he was he was going off the scene he told Billy Paul take care of the kids and everything you know the his his testimony now I want to play a portion of tape for you I told these brothers to get it ready are you ready very good this is on the sermon trying to do goddess servants without it being God's Will from paragraph 46 to paragraph 59 now just let it play Brethren please turn up the sound so everybody hears it the Phoenix meeting remember I preached the sermon sirs what time is it remember that I said I seen that I said before it comes to pass remember thus saith the Lord something's going to happen you probably got to take your library and take down and there I said you remember now the visions that never fail something's going to happen remember and a few days after that I was getting nervous and I thought what I just I'll go to die I hope it's quick so I can get over it I don't want to linger one more of your lord said go up the topic to be in your Canyon I was up there holding up my hands praying I felt something spanked my hand it was a sword now you can just imagine how you'd feel standing there by yourself and here's a knife in your hand about that long I pulled it down and looked at it it's just nice when I'm now I'm scared of a knife anyhow and it had a it had a a metal something like one of these knives like a hot metal or something real sharp Panera had a sheath around it here where the duelers used to keep cutting one another's hands and it had a pearl in the handle here just sit my hand exactly I rubbed my face and looked back right on that same spot the other day I saw a little white dove come down I'll tell you about that later and uh I was holding that in my hand on all that strange now Lord I am I losing my mind there's no one here I'm miles from anybody and here is the sword I had my hand up and where did it come from I thought that's the strangest thing out of here it's a store I said there's nobody here standing here I'm up on top of these rocks come on top of the mountain you couldn't even see Tucson from there it's a far down although now that's a strange thing that's got to be in this vicinity somewhere somebody that could create and make a sword and put it in my hand watch this I said it could only be the very God to create a ram for Abraham to create those squirrels now to here is the material three different kinds of material in it and I'm holding it in my hand just as real as anything else I could hold in my hand I Heard a Voice that that's the king sword I don't know where does that come from Rock somewhere and I held it my hand like that I said a king so uh looked around and the sword was gone and I said a king sword that's the the Knight was sort of distorted I think that's right the army or some way the unite with it you know and I said well that's what that was probably far it means that maybe I'm to lay hands upon ministers or something like that to make them Minister and then uh a boy spoke back and said the king's sword not a king the king although now um either beside myself my mind is flipped or there's something taking place did somebody stand around here to buy me and brethren these things are true I don't I don't know how to tell you you've always seen it always happen that way and it's a I couldn't understand so it's the strangest feeling uh there and I thought now every who that is that talks to me all my life since a little bitty baby boy just standing right here and I can't steam at all I said the king's sword that would be God is the king and what is the sword the word word been placed in your hands so don't fear of death it's your ministry oh my God down off that mountain I only crying screaming the top of my voice jumping over rocks I went down told my wife I said I'm not gonna die I'm not gonna die it's it's my Menace I told her to get with Billy Paul here take the children I said I don't have anything but the church will see that you all don't go hungry and things and I'll meet you across the border and uh and so I said no I'm not going to die it's something about my ministry that's good right here that's good right there now musicians go ahead and you'll come I'm bringing this to her clothes you see what was it this is that third pool what is it the word revealed amen what is it the sword the word of God has now been placed in his hand and now he comes and he begins to show and this this word now divides asunder between spirit and soul and they can't stand the correction of the word because he said it in order are you with me now now the deacons started fighting for brother Branham and said those guys are nothing but a bunch of dead birds and he said now if you're my seed in Christ if you're one of my children shame on you he said now if they want to have that in their church that's up to them that's their trouble and I say the same way today we're not you know what creates a lot of confusion to people today because they're looking at all the different churches and the way they preach in the way that uh they worship and everything and one's got to go this way and one's got to go that way well Hey listen I I'm talking about the responsibility I have right here and listen I realize we ain't the shoutness we ain't the prettiest we ain't the dancingest huh but you guys are stable you're solid you're right here and I love that and I'm not afraid to match us with anyone else regardless of what they're doing I say God sovereignly is doing things in every church let them do what they want to do let's follow God in the way that God shows us can we say Amen to that [Music] Nathan and Cora became more spiritual than Moses did they not oh Moses takes too much Authority are we not all spiritual and if God causes separation God's once said separate yourself Moses [Music] the religious Pharisees and Sadducees thought they were more spiritual than Christ but God caused his separation among the group the 70 elders became offended when Christ entered his third pool except you eat my flesh and drink they said this hard saying who can hear it the Bible says in many of his disciples walked no more with him Saint John 6 6 6 mark of the beast to refuse to walk in the light of the word takes the mark of the beast the third poll is the word revealed it is the revelation of the word to you personally what is the language the pure language that God is using right now it's a Heavenly language it's a holy ghost language because the Holy Ghost speaks the revelation of the word to you and you understand it it's the language that I want all of you to have the ear to hear you like that God bless you this evening let's Stand Together amen some of you might have to take this tape and listen to it again go and read these quotes and go slowly but on the day of Pentecost when the penny when the Holy Ghost was fully come they all began to speak as the spirit gave them utterance was it a language and then everybody that was there I think there's 15 different nationalities we read them and they all said how is it that these are all galileans yet we hear them speak the great wonderful works of God in the language we're in we were born [Music] an unknown tongue they were glorifying God they began to worship God and the Holy Ghost gave them utterance and they were speaking a language it was revealed to them and they were worshiping God and all those people said these people are drunk on new wine or on wine he said these are not drunk as you suppose but he said they are drunk brother Bram said what was it that they were drunk on on that morning he said it was the Holy Ghost amen so when you think about a Heavenly language and coming under one language then understand that the computer is being used right now with the tower to speak one language to get all of them through YouTube Instagram Facebook all of this stuff for everybody to do you know that if you speak around your iPad or your cell phone and you say something I'm thinking about buying a hot tub guess what kind of uh uh commercials come up on your huh oh there's a new hot tub come out you never even researched it that thing's listening to you have any of you had your your cell phone down somewhere and all of a sudden Siri or something starts talking to you it's freaky my wife and I whoa what is that [Music] you see we're we're in a realm right now saints of God where science science breaking into God's Great Laboratory and just like everything is getting voice activated it is replicating what God is doing because when you heard the message of the hour as it was in the Book of Genesis and God said and he activated with his voice is he not doing the same thing but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should speak his language guess what when you heard it you took life Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen somebody give God praise tonight amen amen hallelujah amen heavenly father I thank you for the goodness of God in our lives with mostly I thank you for the Holy Ghost s which speaks to us the revelation of God and faith is that language that every believer has got to speak because without faith it is impossible to please God and though those that were in the first Exodus heard the ministry of Moses but seeing what they had heard was not mixed with faith and were overthrown in the wilderness father I pray o God that you will allow us every time we come to church may we have what we hear be mixed with faith and may that Faith cause us to get into action I thank you and I praise you and I ask that you will bless this sermon that we have spoke I pray it was a blessing to them it blessed me father I thank you for showing it to me I laughed I wept I enjoyed it just looking it up I thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen Amen brother Mark what's the song Here been a day there's never been a day like this day to me snake has never been a day like this day I see there is [Applause] [Music] so bright as this day this Glory [Music] there's never been a day like this day to me there's never been a day like this day I see and there is never been alive that shines so bright as this [Music] amen God bless you thank you for coming to the house of the Lord tonight brother James Lovell would you come here would you dismiss in a word of prayer my brother [Music] I was going to call your father-in-law but he told me he gets nervous if he gets called to pray so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do that come up here brother James you know God used these young men I do not have a soul complex if these guys they preach us a great sermon or something like that that just pops my buttons and I say thank God for these young men that are catching things but honestly brother Meadow it's not fair these 11th Hour workers catching the same Revelations taking us 35 40 years to get to but it's fair in God's eyes it's fair in God's economy God bless you with James it's by our heads our gracious Heavenly Father we come before you this evening Lord so thankful for the word that's gone forth Lord for a language that we understand and that we're catching in this hour Lord we're so thankful that we're coming into the unity of one father and we're beginning to understand it through Revelation and father I just ask that you just continue to unfold yourself reveal yourself to us and we just ask now that you would just go with your people may you give them protection and Lord we just ask you to bring us back on Sunday on fire and Lord wanting more of you we just commit our lives and each one in the congregation in your hands bless us and go with us I pray in Jesus name amen and brother Mark come on up here and sing a song amen God bless you thank you for coming to the house of the Lord tonight to each and every one of you listen to God's language and let him speak to you God bless you
