I fear when this very same Jesus is always so near he's an ever-present help in that time of storm he's a cleft in the Rock he's an anchor he's a good God Amen Why Should I Worry why should I fear if they pull the words up for us this morning amen we'll sing this song and then we'll get ready to change the order of the service Why Should I Worry why should I fear out on the water the storm raging High s the waters [Music] their heart s they felt they would die they failed to remember that the master the pastor was [Applause] [Music] obey his will and he called their storms like he will hide or if I just remember the key to it right here this deep inside and why should I wear free and why should I be with the very same gene he stays always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry

very strange [Music] [Music] I'll call on his way till the storm passes by Give the Lord a handclap Hallelujah [Applause] trials will come the winds will blow Temptations will surround us on a daily basis but what does it matter because we know the master of the Wind we know him by name and because we know him by name we can call upon his name in a time of trouble if you have a need upon your heart how about you make it known to the Lord by an uplifted hand as we pray Heavenly Father this building is full of needs Lord your children are approaching you with uplifted hands father with many desires and needs upon their hearts and Lord we are completely depending upon the father we're not depending upon our own righteousness we're not depending upon our own works or our own abilities but we're depending upon the finished work of Calvary and so by Faith Lord we say meet our needs Father Like Only You Can your Prophet taught us he said that you can do nothing more for us than what you've already done and so I'm asking that Faith would arise in our hearts faith in the finished work Lord faith in the written word father that we may know that you are alive and that you are with us that our needs would be met we thank you for this opportunity to be here bless your people father be with our pastor and sister Sandy touch them in body father God we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord thank you musicians uh if you have your Bibles turn with me to the Book of Proverbs chapter 4 and we'll read verse 25 and is certainly an honor to be here this morning to minister the word of God and um we had a a nice wedding there on on Friday brother Matthias Robson and sister Ellie there they they tied the knot I guess you would say and that do we have did you Brothers get some of the pictures yep so there's the happy couple you know for a wedding at the end of May you couldn't have asked for any better weather it was so beautiful there's brother Ron some of the girls there that was kind of interesting the boys they all came out and you know one of them did a cartwheel and the other one did a backflip when the wedding party's coming out and stuff and and I and I told the brother the people at our table I said watch Isaac's going to do a a rollover and sure enough he comes out and he rolls over I'm just a good guesser is all and so brother Ron asked me to greet the people and uh and just you know he really wanted to be here there's one thing about brother Ron is this uh he's got no reverse in his vehicle all he knows is forward he's got no white flag and uh so for brother Ron not to be here you know he's he's pretty sick in body so we'll just raise him up I'm gonna claim that God will touch him for a speedy recovery and uh we'll be expecting to see him and sister Sandy here on Wednesday night Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 25. it says let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee let's read 26 Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left and remove thy foot from Evil amen was he trying to teach us here don't be looking to the right don't be looking to the left but look directly straight before us amen first Samuel chapter 12 verses 20 and 21. also so I don't forget if the minister Brethren after the service is over we're going to have prayer for little Josiah and Megan and Ben in the back corner here after we minister so just in case I forget so I can be remembered that would be fantastic brother James and brother Warren and brother Mike and brother martin so just uh be ready for that after the service first Samuel 12 and verse 20 and it says in Samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should you go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain amen let's just pray one more time father I ask for your anointing this morning I pray for your inspiration of the Holy Spirit Lord we are completely depending upon you Lord to take the word to break the bread of life to our hearts father so I pray that myself that I would be anointed and inspired that the congregation Lord would be anointed and inspired father that we could take the word and apply it to our lives father God that we might live a life that is pleasing today we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated I would like to title my sermon this morning staying focused in times like these staying focused in times like these if there was ever a Time in the history of the world that would cause the children of God to lose their focus I would say it's right now we find that there's many things in life that bombards us on a daily basis and of an assurance we can say that we are living in Satan's Eden and Satan has had six thousand plus years to perfect his Eden and we can say that it is pretty perfect for him because on a daily basis we are bombarded with distractions in our lives as Sons and Daughters of God and the reason that he has perfected it in such a way is you know Satan doesn't care about those that do not claim Christianity do not claim to be Sons and Daughters of God but he's after you and I whenever we confess and we profess Christianity that we love the Lord and we have a testimony of God what of what God has done in our lives immediately there's a Target that's put on our back and that Target Satan has there because he wants to take us down he wants to take our eyes off the prize he wants to take our Focus off of what what we should be focusing on because he doesn't want us to live a life that is pleasing to God as I think about it even just now we could say yeah Satan he wants to take us out and he wants to take us down but he wants us to feel that we're not worthy enough that we're not good enough that we're not a good enough Christian and so what he does is he puts things in our lives he puts distractions in our lives so that our eyes are not on the prize and so when he gets us to a place of undergoing yeah we'll never uh we'll never disclaim God and we'll never say that God isn't real but if he can get us to a place where we're feel like we are undergoors where we feel like we're never will never live to our full potential that's exactly where he wants us to be I want to tell you this morning that you are able to go the distance that the potential in you is a full potential and God is going to bring that out of the seed so it doesn't matter about ourselves take your eyes off yourself and put your eyes on God keep your eyes on the prize because this bride is not going to be a defeated bride God's children are not going to be a defeated children but God's children are Overcomers God's children are going to make it you can't help it because you were destined to make it Hallelujah so we find out in times of War the most dangerous thing for a soldier to do is is to lose his Focus is to lose his vision on the mission that he is on at that time because one second of losing focus one moment of of forgetting the mission that they're on at that certain time it could cause death one moment a moment of not looking around a corner good enough a moment of not staying in with with with with with those who are fighting with you your comrades the people that are on your team one moment of of not looking out for them one moment of of distraction one moment of losing your focus it can be of great catastrophe not only for yourself but for those around you not only does it put you in trouble but it puts the whole Battalion in trouble understand that an army or a battalion is only as strong as its weakest link that's why when you watch these uh you ever see it online there uh of hell week and the things that that these men go through in order to be a a a a special marine or a Green Beret or whatever the title might be and they're always telling them just quit just quit just go ahead and quit you're not made for this this is too hard for you you want to quit don't you isn't that what Satan wants to try to do to us on a daily basis yeah you might as well just quit it's too hard the journey is too rough there's too many trials there's too many Temptations this one has fallen away so you might as fall away as well go ahead and ring the bell ring it it's got your name written all over it well these these men they are so deprived of sleep they're so deprived of of food and shelter and everything is stripped away from them until they finally think you know what I made it I made a mistake this is not for me I might as well just ring the bell but the purpose of it is this is that they don't they want to push these guys to their limits they want people that will not quit because if they quit there they'll quit on the battlefield God is not raising quitters in this end time but he is raising people who are not going to ring that Bell who are going to continue and press on in the fight when I was younger I used to do kickboxing and so my uncle was uh Australian Commonwealth champion and and different things he was pretty good and so when I was eight nine years old I wanted to be a kickboxer and I wanted to fight and um so I remember he took me down to Belfast and and I was always sparring with people that was older than me they were there I was in an adult class but he let me in the class because I was family sometimes family get uh little things like that that other people don't get so anyways he wanted to see what was in me so it takes me down to Belfast Billy Murray's gym and there's all these young people are and and I didn't realize it but they're all waiting for me and I'm thinking well this is fantastic and so you're nervous and all these different things anyways we get in we get into the ring and we begin to spar well these guys were way better than what I was man they could kick and do all these different things and and and and and and and all I knew all I had what was good was a good low kick that could look kick very good because I'm short well it turns out in kickboxing there's different rules so when the rules set no low kicks well great so these guys are coming out and they're kicking me and everything well I saw my chance and I just cracked this guy right on the chin as hard as I could and so it made me feel really good but after that he he hit me back really good and he kicked me and I ended up on the ground well truth be told I lost my balance but my uncle Danver he always told me he said it doesn't matter if you get your bail rung it doesn't matter if you slipped he would always tell me take an eight count take an eight count and get your breath back get your composure back get yourself back in the zone so whether I was hurt or not guess what I did I took an eight count I was fine what was I doing I was I was taking uh taking everything in I was getting my composure back I was getting my mind back in the right place why because I was on the ground one thing about a Christian he doesn't stay on the ground even though he gets hit down and he gets his bell wrong he gets back up again and so I get back up I have my composure and he comes at me again well I hit him with this really sweet straight right hand and so after that you know his because they play favoritism down there as well uh because he was hurt well they took him out and they put somebody else in so now I'm sparring against somebody else but I look over to the side and I see this guy and he's shaking his head and I thought my goodness if I wouldn't have taken the eight count understand it might have went a little bit different and so it is with the Christian Life the strength that you gain while you're on your knees is what's gonna take you further in your Christian walk so let me encourage some of you this morning take an eight count don't get up in one or two seconds if you got your bell wrong don't get up in one or two seconds if you have slipped and you've Fallen but spend time upon your knees spend time in prayer take that eight count because eight is the number of Eternity that's where we'll gain our strength is from the eternal spirit God so don't be in a rush to get back up don't be in a rush to try and get back in the game but spend your time in prayer and God will renew your strength too much of the time people try to get up too quickly well I'm okay I'm okay no you're not okay take the count ask for help reach out to your pastor reach out to your parents you know what's uh you know what one thing is a fact about young people you're gonna fall you know it's a fact about older people they're gonna fall you know it's a fact about Humanity we are going to fall and when we fall we have no reason to be embarrassed about it if we need help reach out and ask for help no matter what age we are we often think about the young people well it's only young people that make mistakes can some of the elders Say Amen give some of the younger encouragement don't be scared to Humble yourselves and to reach out for help when you're in a time of trouble amen foreign we find that there's many distractions on the battlefield there's Rockets blasting there's people getting injured there's those who are close to you who are falling left and right but no matter what happens upon the battlefield no matter what distractions there is out on this battlefield each individual has to make sure that they keep their focus I didn't even think about tomorrow being Memorial Day we've had many soldiers that are amongst us that have fought for our country but you know what we have soldiers that are amongst us who are fighting for the bride who are fighting for one another a lot of times I'm sure you've seen it where there will be man and young boys especially they'll get shell shocked and something will happen there will be an explosion there'll be something catastrophic that'll cause them to completely lose their focus and lose where they're at at the very present time where they are and you'll see that the commander the captain who's in charge he'll go and he'll grab him and he'll say stay focused stay in line keep your mind in the game I know there's many distractions amongst us I know there's many falling I know it's not easy but there's a mission at hand we have sent we have been sent here with a purpose we've been sent here on a mission and our mission is to fulfill the purpose that we've been sent here for now stay focused I feel like some of us need a good Shake in this end time Felix in you gotta stay focused man you gotta stay in the game you got to stay in the word this is not a time to get unfocused this is not a time to be looking at worldly things and pleasures and materialistic items that we may want in our lives but now is the time for us to stay focused in the word now is the time for us to stay focused on the mission that we've been sent here for you know what the mission is for the bride right now is to take a rapture she's the final voice to the final age but her purpose is to find the last one in order to take a Rapture don't be taking your eyes off the goal don't be taking your eyes off the gold just because it hasn't happened yet well brother Stephen they've been preaching on the Rapture for years and until it happens we'll keep preaching it I'm here to remind you of the goal because when we have a gold set in our mind guess what we have something to focus for you but I feel too much of us are getting distracted we're getting distracted by life we're getting distracted by Family we're getting distracted by all the chaos that's going on in the world right now the things that have happened since covet hit you ever hear that well since covid I can't remember how many years ago it was well coven oh yeah it was three years ago that happened everything is since covet had and we find that since covet hit my goodness it seems like things are just getting worse and worse and worse but that's just normal that's just natural because it's been prophesied in this time that things will get worse and worse that man will be heady they'll be high-minded they'll be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God they'll be lovers of materialistic things more than lovers of God they'll be lovers of the world more than lovers of God so don't be surprised when it gets worse don't be surprised when our school systems get worse don't be surprised when Society gets worse don't be surprised when the Rapture happens don't be surprised but be ready for it many distractions stay focused stay focused stay focused on the prize stay focused on the mission stay focused on your purpose that you have in Christ Jesus stay focused stay focused on your position in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God we are called to a battle it's an automatic draft this isn't something that you're asked to do but this is something that automatically happens when you have a born-again experience with Jesus Christ guess what automatic draft into the army of God it has no age limit it doesn't have no specific gender it's for boys it's for girls it's for men and it's for women of all ages who's had an experience with God Almighty guess what you were called to a battle every day we're faced with a battle every day we are in the midst of the greatest battle that's ever fought therefore Sons and Daughters of God are on the Forefront of the battle each and every day it is not an Earthly battle that is fought with guns and fists and kicks and all those different things but it is a spiritual battle it is the Battle of the Mind Ephesians 6 verse 12 it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities notice where your battle is against and is not against your brother or your sister in the Lord young people your battle is not against your parents your battle is not against mom and dad your battle is not against the people sitting beside you but your battle is against principalities it's against Powers it's against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places the battle that we are in is a spiritual battle it's a battle that's fought within the human body within the mind it is a spiritual battle because we Are Spiritual Beings that are trapped within a natural body we are not carnal people with uh something spiritual we're not a natural people with something spiritual within us but we are first Spiritual Beings because that's what we were since the beginning this is second place this is carnal but who we really are is a spiritual being in Christ Jesus so therefore the battle is spiritual Hallelujah as we look we find that there's many battlegrounds where Armies come against each other you can even look in Ukraine right now and you see the the battle for uh back Moon Back Moon and kive and all these different places there's all these different battlefronts that are along this Ukraine border and and within the the city it's the country itself there but we find that within our own lives there's many battlegrounds sure we realize that the greatest battle that we fight is is within our minds and and just let me encourage you this morning that you need to stop listening to your mind into your own thoughts but you need to spend time and prayer to sensitize your spirit to that still Small Voice because it's still Small Voice it does not speak to your mind the still Small Voice speaks to the heart because God chose the heart for the dwelling for his dwelling place and Satan chose the mind but what happens too much of the time is we're thinking too much with our carnal mind and everything that comes into our minds we believe it but rather if you would pay attention to this still small voice and the leadership of God that dwells within the heart of a born-again Believer it would be far better for us there would be less carnality in our lives there would be less fighting in our lives and bickering one with another why because we are being led of the spirit you know God speaks to you on a daily basis a lot of times we think to ourselves my if I could just have been in the time of the disciples if I could have just been a prophet and that God would speak to me like he did Abraham if God would speak to me like he did with Moses if God would speak to me like he did with Elijah I've got news for you he does our problems exist that we're distracted by this uh by this place that we call Earth and everything that's designed to distract us we we get caught up with those things rather than the things of God what happens when we get caught up with everything around us is our spirit gets hardened have you ever had a hardened spirit before have you ever had an attitude where well I just don't really care anymore yeah because your spirit is hardened so how does a person's Spirit get hardened within them they're not yielding to the things of God they're not sensitizing their Spirits by prayer and reading so if you ever come across somebody and it seems well yeah today they're a little more carnal than they were yesterday and if it goes on for a week or a month you know that there's something wrong within that person's heart you know that their Spirit has been hardened by something because number one they're not spending the time that they should in prayer with God because brother Branham said that prayer sensitizes your spirit so if you're hardened this morning let me encourage you spend a little time on your knees spend a little time with God sensitize your spirit because God will speak there will be little red flashing lights that are warning us not to go down this Avenue don't go down there don't do that don't say that but there will be also times where he'll speak to our hearts and he'll say go down this Avenue go there talk to that person do this or do that but if our Spirits is hardened if our hearts is full of callous guess what there's no way for us to hear the mind of God there's no way for us to hear his voice you know what happened to brother brown one time he got so hard and calloused he said a bunch of rickies and bunts of rickettis I tell him I tell the women not to cut their hair and I and I come back and and it's worse than it was before you know brother Branham had a backbone when I was in Ireland I went to uh I went to a Pentecostal church with my parents and there's zero holiness there's zero all the women have cut short hair burn pants all on and on just I could just say there's no Holiness and you'll understand what I'm trying to say and I got to thinking about brother Branham and I thought brother Branham who did he go to Pentecostals brother Branham was ministering the gospel now he would say and you women I'll look at a man you women right he should be ashamed of yourself and we all laugh that's kind of funny but imagine here he is by himself in another man's pulpit preaching to other people sometimes from 30 to 500 a thousand whatever and he's making eye contact with people should be and you men letting your women go out like that should be ashamed of yourselves he was talking to people brother Brown didn't pull no punches he was a man with absolute backbone for us it's easy now women don't cut your hair yet we all know it's easy to remind once in a while but I just thought my goodness this man was such a man of God that no matter if it was hard or not he still preached the word and he preached the truth whether anybody agreed with him or not for man so next time that you that you hear that just think of the people who he's preaching to it gives us that little bit more of respect for brother Branham but we find out that one of the battlefronts that's within our lives as Believers in this day is the Battlefront of the family we find out that Satan is doing everything that he can to uh to divide and to conquer the family unit and he does it through our own carnal selves he does it through the disobedient children he he does it through all these different Avenues whatever it may be but whatever what he wants to do in his main goal is to divide and to conquer our family lives and our family units Now understand this that it's not the pastor's uh job to keep the family unit in line in our own houses as the pastor's job to keep the family unit within the church body you understand that but when we go home that responsibility goes off onto somebody else it goes off onto the heads of the homes and so we find out now that Satan is trying to attack the heads of the houses he's trying to attack our families because he understands this concept that the church body is only as strong as our families are strong if we got weak families at home if the heads of the home are weak in mind if they're weak and standard if they don't have a backbone guess what the family is not going to have a backbone the family is not going to have any kind of standard the wife won't be in her place he won't be in her place and neither will the children and so we find that whenever our family life and the family unit is um what's the word I'm looking for not comprised but compromised when the family unit is compromised it compromises the church body because we're we're like a battalion we're only as strong as our weakest link I wonder how life is with you at home I wonder how life is with you and your family at this very present time when you go home I had a dream the other the other week and uh and in my dream I was ministering and I was ministering from a chair it wasn't in this church but and I was I was I had a seat belt on and it seemed like I was trying my best to minister and I couldn't and I was trying to get up and I and and I just couldn't Minister like I know how I should be able to well all of a sudden they took the seat belt off and I was able to minister like I should and what I began to preach on was the family life I began to pray I remember it just like it just happened in real life and I began to say how is your family life at home how are things behind closed doors we can come to church and we can put our Halos on and we know the right things to say we know the right things to wear we know how to greet people we know how to be respectful but how is the standard in your home how is your family life at your home at this present time I begin to think I think that's an inspired thought because what is happening behind closed doors it only takes a matter of time before it becomes manifested and if things are not correct behind closed doors how can we expect things to be correct amongst us how can we expect God to freely move in our church services so let me speak to your hearts to see this morning how was your life at home dad husband are you raising your family are you controlling your household according to the word of God are you holding a standard debt hey yeah the world might do this and the world might act like this but as for me and my house this is how we're going to serve the Lord I don't care if you want to do this or not hey these are my standards so much of the time we preach at the women and we forget about the heads of the homes we forget about the husbands who aren't being diligent in their walk with God we forget about the husbands that have forgotten their first love with their wives we forget about the husbands who beat their kids instead of correcting them with a spanking there's a difference we forget about the husbands who aren't holding any kind of standard in their lives they're doing what they want because they say they're the head of the home Christ is the head of the man Christ is the head of our homes we forget dads and husbands where's the standard are you raising your family will you say brother Stephen you're too late in the game I already raised my family well it doesn't matter it doesn't give you an excuse to lose focus on the prize because chances are you're going to have grandkids and they're going to need trained up also let the Holy Spirit deal with your heart how's your home life how's your prayer life how's the family alter with your family I think we've left off the family all the family Altar for YouTube we've left off the family Altar for watching things online that do nothing but waste time we've left off the family Altar for CNN we've left off the family Altar for Fox News what happens when you leave off the family altar with our family there's one let me ask you a question what brought you and your wife together as a unit it was Christ if it wasn't for God I never would have met my wife so God is the magnet that brought us together he is the one that tied us together he is the one that brought us together as a unit But as time goes on how quick and how easy it is to leave off of the one who brought us together because now it's about you and your family now it's about you and your wife know it's about you and Christ and the rest follows I like that scripture in Samuel that we just read and Samuel said yeah you've done all these things you've went you've looked to the left you've done what was wrong but you don't have to stay in that condition but there's a time to repent there's a time to make things right and there's no greater time than the very present dads husbands stay focused stay in the game if you've left off of your first love of God and the unity of God within the home guess what there's no better time than the present which is right now to say God I've been wrong God of my focus has been on things that I shouldn't be focusing on but from this time Lord I'm going to rededicate my life back to you because I want you to be the center of my home brother brother Ron said on Friday at the wedding a couple who prayed together Stay Together leave off of prayer it's I was thinking about it it's kind of funny you know you get them up here and they're so in love and they're holding hands and oh yes I'll always keep her my sweetheart oh yes keep her your sweetheart he's he I think that you know the thing about weddings is for me as a husband and is like yep puts me in remembrance oh I'll always keep her my sweetheart well Ten Years Later plus you forget hey she's still your sweetheart your job is not your sweetheart the people at work is not your sweetheart your sweetheart is your sweetheart and you said you would keep her as your sweetheart so keep her as your sweetheart yeah time goes on focus is change father bring us back lord into Focus amen amen we're living in a time where the teachings of the family unit and God's expectations of each role within that unit our we don't hear it enough we know what is right but I feel like we need to be kept in remembrance once in a while of the roles of the husband and the roles of the wife within the family unit not according to what they say out there but according to what the word of God says we find that uh many people feel that this is an old-fashioned way of raising a family it is an old-fashioned way of of of of of how you should treat one another but God's word is not old because it is eternal it is not old-fashioned it is not in fashion and it is not out of fashion but it is the way the truth and the life and So within the word of God now he lays out certain roles in certain ways for us as Sons and Daughters to raise our families can you say Amen okay Genesis 3 16 it says on to the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so we realize that everything to do with childbearing and everything has to do with the woman believe it or not we're living in a time where they're trying to switch it I watched the little thing the other day uh that guy Matt um whatever his name is the who is a woman guy and um or what is a woman he did that documentary and so he's having an open air because he's all of a sudden he's he wants to be a politician or whatever and um they're asking him questions so there's a transgender woman which is a man that's asking him a question and and so he so this person is unfolding their life before him and it turns out that this person is an EMT so a lot of times they want to ask all the questions but they don't want to be asked questions and so he said I'll answer your question as long as you let me ask you a question at the end of this question and so anyways he answers her question she doesn't like the answer and walks off and so he goes no no no no no no no come back here I have a question for you he said you said that you are an EMT that's right he said now let me ask you a question you have a person that's laying in front of you and you know it's a male and they're telling you that they have severe abdominal pain but they tell you that you're that they are pregnant are you going to do a scan to see if they're pregnant or not she said no he said why she said because it's a man just totally debunked their own question he says wait a second I thought wouldn't you have to check it and wouldn't you have to be politically correct to say if they say they're a woman and they say that this is happening that you have to agree with it just walked off the stage does not make any kind of sense whatsoever God help us huh to raise our children to know what's right and what's wrong to know what a boy is and to know what a girl is no matter what anybody in the school tries to tell them amen Ephesians 5 22 verse 24 wives submit yourselves onto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject onto Christ let the wives be to their own husbands in everything so the scripture is is laying out a pattern for us to live our lives and he's saying wives guess what submit yourselves to your husbands because he has rule overeating because Adam was formed first and not Eve the Bible says that Eve was the one that fell in the transgression it wasn't the man he said because thou has done this Eve every single woman from now until the end of time guess what their husbands is going to have rule over them now does that mean for a husband that he should get out here and rule with an iron rod and with a fist of no real man wouldn't act like that a real man will love his wife has Christ loved the church but for our sisters let me encourage you because we are living in a time where I don't want to say women's rights and Liberty and all that stuff we're we're living in a time where it's more pushed for a woman to be elevated above the man and a lot of times the woman is smarter than most of the men and speak by experience [Laughter] but because I have a wife who loves the Lord and wants to be obedient to the word of God what did she do even when she's smarter and she might be right she brings herself subject to the headship of her husband which is myself you know a lot of times if you approach your husband the correct way he'll take it correctly she'd say honey you missed out about this no honey it's not that and she'll explain it three different ways until finally ding I was right and then I'll tell her what it is huh and then she'd go that's what I've been telling him the whole time but what happens is we're living in such a society now where the woman is elevated above the man in the world and now she begins to take on that Spirit of well let me tell you and let me tell you something well you're just absolutely wrong no your approach is wrong so God help us help our wives to be subject to their own husbands you don't got to be subject to everybody else's husband husband and say Lord what does the Bible say of a quiet and meek spirit it's of great price and the eyes of God it's not always about being right or being wrong but it's having the right Spirit and the right attitude don't let the world infiltrate your home life don't let the women out there come into your lives and let them inspire you no let the word of God inspire you amen first Peter 3 verses one through six likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives notice notice how important it is for a life for a testimony in a life of a sister what will it do it'll win the unbelieving husbands because the husband will see hey guess what there's something different about this one do you remember the story of brother Branham he would say he told the story about the man was at the bar and they were sitting there and everything and they're talking about Christianity and everything the guy says I have a wife I know a real Christian oh they're they're all Hypocrites this and that he said come to my house so these guys are obviously drunk and they go to the house and and he starts treating this woman like she's a dog woman give us something deed bring us all these different things and he's doing it on purpose to prove a point and so we find out she fixes them something to eat and brings it over and all of a sudden he gets it and he throws it off the floor and he says this isn't how I like it give me something different so it happens a couple of times and because she had the right attitude because she had the right spirit because she had it was because she had a relationship with God that's what makes the difference her spirit was soft her heart was tender and she just kept singing a little song to the Lord I forget what song it was but she kept saying then all of a sudden the Lord moved on these men's Lives why was it it was because of the testimony of the wife preach a sermon and use words if you have to Hallelujah I remember the first time that uh so Rocco's wife Jenny was was the first person uh uh the first mother in Christ I guess I could say that was ever an example for me and uh I just remember her when we would ride in the car she would let me sit up front and this was just wild to me I thought no you said and I'm trying to show her respect no you sit in the back I'll sit in the front it's okay and no no no no no no you sit in the back and I are you sit in the front and I'll sit in the back and I realize now that she was bringing herself lower because she was having respect to me as a Young Man rather than respecting herself and sitting up front with her husband in the car something simple but it was something that I noticed I would always notice that she would go in and man she would always be bacon fresh cookies and bacon this and doing that and and just how she served roccoa I would always think man I want a wife just like Jenny and I got one it's always bacon and bread and cookies and all these different things and and just homemade and fresh and I'm thinking you know I'm I'm actually living off of the fruits of Jesse and Tracy how they raised her I think when I raised my daughter Mariah she's just going to stay at home it's tough I don't know how some of you fathers did it giving your daughter away huh is it tough brother Steve yeah I don't even want to think about it yeah Rapture amen verse 2 it says while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear who's adorning now notice he's still talking to the wives who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of uh plotting the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection onto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement what a far cry that is from the women of the world today not the women of the church not the women of the Bride but the women of the world I gotta bring myself into subjection to this guy that's why there's no more marriages anymore people just coexist with each other within the home that if something goes wrong guess what that you can just get out of here and I can get another one see marriage is marriage has lost its value how does this happen how does marriage lose its value why why one minute there and one minute not there what's the matter they lost their first love with Christ and when we leave our love for Christ guess what happens everything else just falls apart God help us God help our young men our young families to keep God the center of our lives and of our families God help our older ones to keep God the center of our lives and the center of our families amen say brother Stephen are you preaching up people because you know that there's people within the assembly that have drifted apart absolutely not I'm just preaching as I feel led how to preach God help us and go and help our youngers to learn hey what happened here what went wrong because if you know what went wrong don't do the same mistake you know what has happened to others they were in your position as young people and you think well it'll never be me it'll never be my family it'll never be this yeah it might be it might be if you don't keep your first love with God yes Lord Hallelujah some of our older sisters they might say well I've already raised my family and this and that well doesn't the Bible say it for the older to to train the youngers sure it does to teach them to be keepers at the home and to love their their their their uh husbands and and and and to raise their children in the admonition of God I wonder when the last time an elder within the assembly reached out to some of the younger sisters and said hey sis ah I can see that this is not working with your children now do you think a young sister will be able to take this huh let's stand on some toes they'll get mad all right if they're not prayed up and praying but when somebody approaches the younger and saying I see you're having trouble with your younger kid or or I see with your husband how that you talk to him or whatever it may be if you would do this instead it might help you in your life when was the last time an elder was in the assembly had a backbone to reach out to one of the younger family uh of the young of the families and scriptural it's scriptural is it easy no nobody said it would be easy but it's scriptural and so then it is also scriptural for the young families and the young people that whenever somebody comes with a slight rebuke and they come in love it's up to us to respond the right way and say ouch that hurt but I know you're right thank you for taking the time because love is corrective Hallelujah that's the job of the elders it's time to get to work you're going to come up to me after service today young man I'll take it because I know if you've got something to say it's probably true we just want to be right don't we amen Genesis 3 17 verse 19 and on to eight Adam he said because that was hearkened onto the voice of thy wife and I was eating of the tree of which I commanded thee sin thy shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life notice he doesn't curse Adam's Body but he curses the ground he curses the ground that he's going to be telling by the sweat of his brow Thorns also on thistle shall bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return onto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou return I don't want to work it's too hard it's supposed to be hard there's no such thing as easy money if somebody comes along with a get rich quick scam guess what hey it's not real they're going to take your money and they're going to leave there's one way to build wealth that's to work hard that's to save hard and that's to invest what you can ain't gonna happen overnight these guys are all like man I thought it was out there it's not in Dogecoin huh is that how you say it it's not on these apps that you can get on your phone well I'm gonna buy now and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna sell it when it's ten times more all these guys did it and they lost their money don't get caught up with get quick Rich scams nothing like a good old uh fashioned Hard Day's Work whether that's behind a desk or whether that's digging a ditch whatever it might be as long as you work hard this is what I listen I came from Ireland I came here with a backpack of clothes and a thousand dollars cash I'm not exactly where I wish I was should be but I'm not where I was and I have found out I've found out that when you work hard you show up on time you're faithful to your job guess what you're going to be successful no matter what it is that you do because we're living in a society where people don't want to work they want a bunch of hand me outs they want money for free they want housing for free they no there's nothing for free you gotta work for it but that's the beautiful thing about America if you work hard and you save your money you will be successful I just listened to uh uh uh podcast brother Dave Ramsey everybody know brother Dave and there was an Irish guy on there an immigrant just like me and he give out these statistics that um what was it it was something crazy about that um people who immigrate to the U.S are 20 something percent or whatever it was more likely they talk about becoming millionaire it's like I could care less about being a millionaire it's just a number um that it's a higher percentage of people who come here from another country that they actually end up living the American dream of working hard and being and being financially free it's the Americans who are raised here that they don't see what's before them they don't see the opportunity they think well the American dream is over I beg to differ I'm living it show up and work huh is this too old-fashioned huh everybody just wants to buy and sell online in their pajamas huh like that's what a what a time we're living in huh yeah by the sweat of your brow it's going to be cursed the ground is cursed why is Adam's fault listen to Eve but guess what even though it's cursed it's still going to bring forth fruit amen it just means you got to plow a little harder you got to till the ground a little harder it just means you got to sow a little more because what you sow is what you're going to reap praise the Lord okay I'll get off my Dave Ramsey stuff here Ephesians 5 25. Ephesians 5 verses 25 through 32 husbands love your wives we're still talking about the husbands here even as Christ also loved the church and give himself for it for he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen so what man to love their wives is their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined onto his wife when they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband amen we need to be taken the word of God and applying it to our lives applying it to our lives as individuals whether we're a husband or a wife a boy or a girl and say you know what the young people you could say well I'm not married but you say this is how I want to live my life is according to the scripture not according to what the world is trying to teach us but according is what the word of God wants to teach us amen what am I trying to say this morning I'm saying families that stay focused on the word of God and the roles that has been given us to play as fathers mothers wives and kids if we play our roles guess what it's all going to work out okay I could look out over this audience this morning and I can see men and women husbands and wives who have raised good Godly children of God who have respect and who have honor and who uh put God first in their lives I can look at their lives and say well what did they do they raised their families according to the word and when we raise our families and we do what is according to the word the word will have an effect don't leave off your first love amen don't leave off your first love with God but keep him the center of your family I better hurry our topic this morning is staying focused in times like these and we realize that we are living in a time of great turmoil and there's earthquakes in different places there's fires and floods and covet and all these different disasters that's happening all around the world and we realize what can what else can happen except for the coming of the Lord all these things is just pointing us to one thing as pointing pointing us to say to look up for our Redemption as drawing nigh we realize that it's happening so rapidly and it's kind of almost overwhelming that it seems like one thing happens and then another thing happens and then another thing happens and and it's just in a uh uh uh a Snowball Effect if you please that it's happening so very quickly and so very rapidly did you know that the the last several Prophecies of the Life of Christ when he hung in the cross they were all fulfilled within a few hours of each other it was a Snowball Effect and I believe that that's what's happening in this end time there's a snowball effect in the natural which is giving us a Snowball Effect because the natural is the type of the spiritual we should be having a Snowball Effect and the spiritual catching up with the Revelation that God wants to give us in order for us to get out of here we realize there's a lot going on around us there's a lot of gunfire there's a lot of voices there's a lot of screaming but I want to encourage you to stay focused stay focused on the game and the prize at hand stay focused on your family stay focused on your loved ones stay focused on your children stay focused on God and in his word we realize that as as human beings we can only focus on one thing at a time I can focus on Anthony here on the front row but everything else is in my peripheral but my focus is upon you and so we find out that whenever our Focus gets out of line and we begin to focus on other things though we are still Christians though we're still Sons and Daughters of God though we're still going to church and we're going through the rituals we realize that if we're out of focus everything is just in the peripheral and our peripheral is okay but we need our Focus to be on the word because everything else is just noises just around for just a few seconds or a few moments I would like to speak on some people who lost their focus within the scriptures Genesis 13 10-12 and lot lifted up his eyes and behold and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou cometh onto zor then lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves the one from the other Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan and not dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom out of all the places for lot the pitches tent he pitched his tent towards Sodom why did he pitch his tent towards Sodom and not towards the open areas and towards the uh the plains where Abram was because he lost his Focus he was more focused on popularity he was more focused on the money he was more focused on what Sodom had to offer and because that's where his Focus was that's where he pitched his tent towards understand wherever we pitch our tents towards everybody that's dwelling within our tent they will be pitched towards that same place that's why it's so important that our tents are pitched towards the cross that our tents are pitched towards the word of God because when we pitch our tent and everything that we are towards that everything else everyone else that dwells within that tent will also be pitched toward that way Hallelujah we find in second and second Samuel chapter 11. it was at the time when kings go forth to battle and as Kings and Priests we are also called to go forth to battle it was at this time that King David sent joab and the armies of Israel to go and fight and to destroy the children of Ammon but the Bible says that David tarried still at Jerusalem at a time when the Kings went out to war David was still in Jerusalem David was out of his position as a king and because he was out of his position as a king it caused a great sin in the in in the country of Israel because he was out of his position because he wasn't facing his tent toward it should have been he got wrapped up with Bathsheba and we all know the story but if David would have been in his rightful position as a king Leading the People into battle that sin never would have occurred in the life of David stay in your position stay in your position in Christ Jesus because when you stay in your position there is Comfort when you stay in your position there is protection but when we get out of our position guess what we are open to everything that the devil has to offer for us being having a position goes it's further than being a preacher playing the piano and being a song leader or a deacon each of you have a position in the body of Christ and whether God God has placed you and he has given you a family of children that is your position with that family and children and your responsibility Hallelujah to make sure that that family unit is running according to the word but when we get out of our position no matter who we are trouble comes knocking at the door and because out of your position there's no Authority there's no power you know when you're in your position and trouble comes knocking you can deal with it because you're in your position you're in your rightful position in Christ with authority and with power and you can speak to the mountain you can speak to this situation you can do these different things why because you're in your right place but when we get out of place there's nothing we can do about it until it's too late he look at the life of King Uzziah within the scripture also we find out that God really blessed the young man as a 16 year old King he blessed him so much to where Uzziah thought he could do whatever he wanted to do and so now he tries to take the place of a priest and he tries to burn incense and the priests run in and they say don't do it man this is not your position you're not supposed to be here but because God had blessed him so much he was so prideful and arrogant in his Spirit he thought he could do whatever he wanted to do and we find out that because of that prideful Spirit further Branham said that Pride was lifted up in his heart because of that prideful Spirit guess what happened God had to lower him and cause leprosy to come on his life he lost his Focus he was a great king he was a great leader he was a great leader of men but he lost his focus and he tried to take someone else's place we find that this church AZ Church age even itself was all out of focus they would say a million more and 44. it was all about numbers rather than having an experience with God it was a just make a confession oh we got a million more and 44 a million more confessions I wonder how many people really had a true experience with God not just a confession confession is okay but we gotta have an experience with God that God had baptism speaking in tongues emotions and Sensations all these things brother Brandon had to bring back into focus of the word of God spoken word is the Original Seed someone come the other day and said uh something bad about me and accusing me of something that was wrong what's the attitude I said oh forget it said how can you take take it like that that involves your family said oh my that was predestinated before the foundation of the world to give me a trial I said oh my my my sure that's all right said how do you do it I said if I look down right down this way I'd be falling all the time in other words if he looked down the weight of everybody's negative negative uh comments about them and the things that they were saying about him he said I'd be falling all the time that's the way with the people today if I accept the truth of God's word brother Branham they had kicked me out well what are you looking for look out here at the end of the road see a man who likes this he he don't know where he's gone he looking this way but if you look out yonder you don't care what's going on now you know where you're going see so in other words he's keeping his focus on the prize that's down the road Yonder everything else is peripheral it doesn't matter but he's saying as long as I keep my focus on the prize as long as I keep my focus on the word of God guess what these other things it doesn't matter that's it look where you were going stay lined up with the word all right as the musicians come we'll bring this to a close we've seen examples within the scripture no doubt if you go on you read your Bible you'll see many more examples of people like you and I of like Passions of you and I how that within the Bible God really used him at one point but at some point in their lives they lost Focus and when they lost Focus God had to do what he had to do to their lives he he had to take Uzziah and he had to Smite him with Leprosy and I was even thinking of judas's carrier he was part of the twelve he cast out Devils he prayed for the sick he did all these different things but at some point he lost his main focus of the mission that he was on and it caused him to fall the greatest fall I believe that there was ever was betraying the son of God all because they lost Focus for a Split Second for a few moments in time give their minds and give their hearts to things that they probably shouldn't shouldn't have done let pride get lifted up in their lives this happened that happened hey because they lost Focus what about you [Music] what have you been focusing on this past week what has been your main focus in your life have you been focused on other things that church and praying and reading and serving the family of God is just in our peripherals you know what's there but someone else is taking care of it what have you been focusing on what have you been focusing on in your family life have you lost Focus altogether or is it just in the peripheral of your sight that the Holy Spirit deal with your heart this morning that if you have lost Focus in a time of a lot of distractions if you have lost focus on God if you have lost focus on the word and you've been looking at different things well guess what just like I said earlier there's no time like the present to make it right why put off until tomorrow what can be done today so as we bow our heads and close our eyes I want to invite you to let the Lord deal with your heart because he can only deal with you and he can only work in your life as you let him that's what my question is this where has your focus been where have you been spending all of your time on what have you been thinking about most what have you been doing most if you realize that you know you say yes uh preacher I've gotten out of focus my focus hasn't been on the word my focus hasn't been on God my focus hasn't been on doing the things that I know I should be doing how about you make it known to God with an uplifted hand and you say Lord forgive me God sees those hands my hands are raised also and how about you just open up your heart and you say father forgive me that I have lost focus on my life forgive me that I have lost focus on the things that really matter which is your word and your people forgive me Lord for losing focus on my family and the family Altar and all these different things Lord but from this time forth father from our hearts we say Lord we want to do better father now we in the name of Jesus Christ we we put our Focus Lord back onto your word we put our Focus Lord back on to the things of God as loud as you see a lord has us torn every direction and up and down and left and right Lord and sometimes father it's hard to know where to turn we have we have family responsibilities we have work responsibilities we have these different things that we're responsible for Lord but I realize Lord that if we get out of focus none of these things matter all that matters is being in focus with you so I pray Lord forgive me forgive me for getting out for for getting out of focus Lord it seems like it happens so very easily but father I say in front of your people this morning that I'm gonna do better these binoculars as it were Lord that are out of focus I now turn them Father so that uh so that I can see plainly I I use the little the little thing in the middle there Lord and instead of seeing multiple objects I just want to see you I ask you would bless your people Lord made us little sermon have an effect may it have an effect in our lives Lord then our Focus would be regained once again I love you commit all these things into your hands for thy Kingdom's glory and Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's Stand Together [Music] [Music] for I could never ever ever the ministering Brethren could come and brother Michael and some of the deacons will go back into the corner here and we're going to offer prayer for little Josiah for sister Megan and brother Ben they're going to Florida I believe they leave on Tuesday and the operation is going to be on Friday really big deal they need our prayers [Music] but when something is a big deal in the natural we know that God supernaturally will come on the scene for his word says that if two or more people would agree on any one thing that it would come to pass this is a promise of God and Dwight is there more than two or three Believers here this morning is there more than two or three Believers that you would say I'm going to agree with you this morning that this operation is going to be a complete success the recovery is going to be a complete success that God is going to guide the surgeon's hands and that from this time forth this young man let me tell you something the miracle that God has already done in this young boy's life as Miracle after Miracle after miracle and we're not going to stop praying and we're not going to stop believing until God has finished the work in his life I guess this is a time for me to share some little dreams that I've had whenever Josiah was uh about a month old I had a dream of of uh sister Megan and and um Kristen was there her sister and I remember in my dream that have any of you ever seen brother Steve Menard how he holds his little boy facing outwards like this is not holding him in towards the shoulders holding them out the way and in my dream I seen Megan sister Megan as she was holding little Josiah and he wasn't so little he was a good sized boy probably two three years old and I seen her and she was holding him like this and I saw and I looked and I remember when I had the dream the the doctors and everything didn't give much hope and I seen it and I looked at her and I said he's okay and Kristen turned around and looked at me and she said yes okay he was good he was normal and so I remember I told Ben and everybody I told him because I don't want to be the one of these guys that says oh well I you know after everything is okay no say it put God to the test so I have an assurance within my heart because I was touched within my dream and when I woke up I was touched on my bed you know when God deals with you and so now by faith we're gonna go and we're gonna anoint the little guy and we're going to pray for him and we're going to believe and expect a complete recovery so brother Robert if you want to lead us in a song until we get down there and then we can just leave my mic on so you all can hear and agree as we pray for the family [Music] [Music] we approached thee now by the blood of Jesus Christ then we're thankful for this life that you have given Lord and now father we are believing for a complete recovery father God that you would guide the surgeon's hands that this surgery in this operation Lord would go perfectly father God that the recovery would go perfectly and Lord that he would be a complete testimony of thy healing power father we pray for brother Ben and sister Megan that you would bless them Lord we're so proud of them of their faith in you Lord that it has been unwavering father God and we ask that you would strengthen them and that you would be their portion now father God as they take their journey to Florida you are Jehovah Jireh you are Jehovah Rapha Lord you are the one who heals all of our diseases and we just thank you for this promise that we have that if we would lay our hands upon this they shall recover so let it be father according to Thy word it's not the words of a man that we're saying but this is an eternal word that we have our faith in We Love You Lord we commit their lives into your hands now your word says so so let it be done Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen yes sang this song A couple of weeks ago this listing this song
