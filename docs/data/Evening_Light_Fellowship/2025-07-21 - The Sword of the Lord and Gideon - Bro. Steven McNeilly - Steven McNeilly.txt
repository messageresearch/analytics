So pray the Lord be with brother Freddy and meet his need. We have a request this morning for Sister Miriam She's been told she has possible mastitis and is in a lot of pain. She coverets our prayers. May the hand of the gentle shepherd touch her body and be with her. So let's remember sister Mary Cox this morning. Sister Gracia Castor has turned in a request for Ivonne Rodriguez in Durang Durango. says she's going through dialysis and the doctors have told her she only has 30% of her kidneys that are working just having faith that the Lord will come on the ceiling heal her.

[Music] &gt;&gt; As we come before him, we was singing earlier about Lord, we want to see you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, where is he? &gt;&gt; He's right here. Look around. &gt;&gt; He's right here. You know, we &gt;&gt; we look at the flesh and that's not that's not him. He's in us. &gt;&gt; He's causing this flesh to overcome this stuff. &gt;&gt; This is this is nothing. You know, we we look at we look at death as, oh, it's a horrible thing. It's not a horrible thing. &gt;&gt; It takes us to where we've been living all our lives to go. &gt;&gt; We should never have fear &gt;&gt; for death. &gt;&gt; Because why? Cuz he's in us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So these ones that asked for prayer, it's just like Jesus whenever he as whenever he was God and yet he still prayed, right? So that's what we got to do. We pray for these &gt;&gt; these are even people we don't know that you know maybe but somebody here knows him that they're asking for prayer. &gt;&gt; So as as God, what do we do? &gt;&gt; We pray. Let's let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, Father, we come to you, Father. Lord, we love you, Lord. Lord, when we look at the flesh, we see the weaknesses, Lord. And but that's not what you want us to look at. You told us to sacrifice, this flesh. And a sacrifice is something that takes a lot of pain and agony and it hurts. And Lord, we have loved ones that are hurting, Father. But Lord, we sacrifice this flesh. We look to you, Lord. We look to you for your promises. We believe what you say. Lord, it's your word, not our word. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that you these prayer requests that you answer each one according to your will. Father, &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord.

Let's pray together. Father God, &gt;&gt; we approach thee now in the most holy, wonderful name of Jesus Christ. the one who walked in the water, calms the seas, speaks to the storms, and you're still the same today as you was then, Lord. And so, Father, I pray this morning that you would come by and Lord, that you would calm the seas in our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would speak to the storms, that you would speak to the wind, and Father, that you would let faith arise in our lives that we might walk on the water with you, Lord. Father, we love you. We commit all things into your hands now. I give this service over to you, Lord, for thy kingdom's glory. Let thy will be done in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you. You may be seated just for a few minutes. Thank you musicians. You can just wait there while I greet the people here. And I feel like I need to reintroduce myself. And uh it's certainly good to be home and back with my family and back with my church family. And uh you don't realize how much you miss people until you're gone. And um so yeah, brother Johnny understands, huh, Brother Johnny? And um so anyway, just to give a a little update, um I was talking to brother Pierre in the back there and he thought, "Well, I thought you were in Ireland and I thought you were here." and I was like, "No, no, that's all wrong." So, I figured I might as well just share with you all uh where I've been and what's been going on. So, I was in Australia there at the beginning of the month with brother Daniel White um in Brisbane and uh I was one of two speakers at his youth camp there and we had such a really nice time and um it was a real blessing. you know, the the the people, man, it they were almost like laughing too much with me, you know, and um but I just had a real good time with them and we had some wonderful testimonies of of what God had done. And what was amazing to me was not one time did I ever uh mention about prayer lines or uh mention about uh the laying on of hands or any of those things. And not one time did I hit against it. Okay. And so after the services were complete and everything, um they had a testimony service and there was there was quite a few of the young people. They said, you know, uh I always thought that I had to go through a prayer line or I had to have somebody lay hands on me or I had to come to an altar in order for for God to meet my need through the minister. And their testimony was this, that I found out that God can meet my need right where I'm sitting. &gt;&gt; And that God can answer questions in my heart right where I'm sitting by the ministering of the word. &gt;&gt; And and it just encouraged me so much. &gt;&gt; Um because you know they were saying this is a different kind of a camp. Well, the humanity and man, which is myself, thinks, well, different in a good way or a bad way, you see, and that's kind of the the battle that we that we fight with as ministers. But I guess it was a good way. And I have some pictures here uh that I would like to share. Uh starting from the left, that's sister Cheryl. That's brother Daniel's uh wife, brother Daniel in the white there. Uh he was the host pastor. In the middle is brother uh Ben Gloin um from New Zealand. And on the right that's me obviously. I never realize how short I am until I see pictures of myself. Like there's no way I'm that short, but there's a way. The picture does not lie. Okay, it's up here. Praise the Lord. So, here we are again. Uh he took us uh on a little drive and um you know, it's amazing. In Ireland, uh car sickness wasn't a thing for me. And you know, Australia is very similar to Ireland is low rolling hills and lots of curves and the road and everything. And I realized getting, you know, here in Arizona, the roads are all straight. And so it was just a real battle for me not to get car sick. And um but go back to that other picture. Sorry. Um the brother on the right there, his name is Brother Paul. And brother Paul was from Western Australia, came and he's moved to Brother Daniel's church. And so I left here on the Monday. I got there on Wednesday morning and then I preached Wednesday night at the church. So after I got done ministering, I got to greet the people and this brother was right on the front row and and he's a real character. And um so I shook his hand and and I said, "Hi, brother. What's your name?" And he goes, "Oh, my name is Paul." Huh? You know, I'm true American. Huh? He goes, "Po?" I said, 'I'm sorry, brother. I I I didn't catch your name. Can you say it one more? Paul. I said, 'Oh, Paul. He goes, "Yeah, Paul." So, you come to find out in certain uh sides of Australia, they have different accents just like here. And um Western Australia, they take the full word, they cut it in half, and that's what they say. So, they speak half sentences. And um so I needed an interpreter for a little bit at the beginning, but we we got through it and I f I found out that brother Paul is a fine fine man. Fine man. Uh let's go to the next one, please. This was this just blew my mind. Can you guys see that? Kangaroos, people's yards like rabbits. I thought, my goodness, look at that thing. Huh? Isn't that just the oddest thing you ever saw in the front yard? It's just it just abs it still blows my mind. I got a video of one of these things standing up and they got these really long feet but they look like a big muscular man and uh and you know people talk about fighting a kangaroo. It's all nonsense. You don't want to fight those things. So I thought you guys would like that. Let's go to the next one please. if we have any. Oh, yeah. Here we go. So, that was the camp. There was about uh I think there was 65 young people there and then they had, you know, the counselors and everything like that. And they actually they make all their own food at the camp. Um and they're a smaller camp so they can do that. But in saying that, it's a ton of work. And um and so they actually had a banquet one of the nights, which was really, really nice. We should do it at our camp sometime. Um, and this was this is in Canada, but going back. So, anyways, there was uh I love lamb. Lamb is like one of my favorite things. And we don't really eat it here much in America. Over there, they got that's all they eat. And so, they had lamb for the banquet. So, Sister Cheryl told the sisters there, you know, hey, Brother Steven really likes lamb. Okay. So after I preach the banquet, you know, it's like 11:30 or whatever, and they set this massive plate of lamb right in front of me, and I'm all, "Thank you so much." Like, it was late. That was a heavy meal, but I ate every bit of it cuz that's what that's what you do when you go traveling. You eat what's before you. Okay. Um, so then I came home and what was awesome, which was really nice, this is a real blessing of the Lord. when I was flying there. Uh, where did I fly to Ashlin? First first flight, I can't remember. San Francisco. So, I fly to San Francisco and all all of a sudden I hear my name over the intercom. Steve McNeely, please come to the front desk. I'm Oh, great. What's going on? You know, I always think the worst. She said, "This is your lucky day, pal. You got upgraded to premium." Like, let's go. So uh so I went from you know a small seat to a big seat with lots of leg room. It thing recines and there was nobody sitting beside me and I slept I think it's a 12-h hour flight. I slept for like on and off for 8 hours. So when I got over there I was golden. It was really good. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. It was a real blessing. So then I came home. I was here for a week and then we went to Canada to preach for brother Eugene Braun. And then if we could just put that last picture up there, please. Uh we had a little youth meeting there um outside and it was just just real real real nice. Um they were real um responsive to the to the youth service and and it being an open discussion rather than being preaching. So I just kind of walked around the campfire and we spoke a little bit there and they were they were really really encouraged. So, that's where I've been and here I am uh back in the house of the Lord, back at my post of duty and um I'm just happy to be home. So, God bless you. Let's just uh let's just turn to our Bibles. I'm sorry, musicians. Thank you. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Let's stand together. Turn with me to the book of Judges, chapter 6, and we'll read verses 1-2. I'm not too sure exactly where I'm going this morning. Uh but if you pull, I'll preach and I'll try my best to yield and um and we'll see what what direction the Lord leads us in. &gt;&gt; Judges 6 uh verse one. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian 7 years. And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. And because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds. And so it was when Israel had sown that the Midianites came up and the Amalachites and the children of the east even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come onto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox ass. For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude. For both they and their camels were without number, and they entered into the land to destroy it. Notice they weren't going in to fight with the Israelites or to kill them or with or to slay them with the sword, but they were taking away their inheritance. They were trying to take away what God had gave to them. And by doing so, they were just taking over the land to destroy them. And that's exactly what Satan wants to do with us. He He wants to come and take over our lives, take over our mind because he wants to take away our inheritance. &gt;&gt; And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, because of the Midianites, that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage. I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not the gods of the Amorites, Amorites, and in the in whose land you dwell. But ye have not obeyed my voice. &gt;&gt; And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak, which was an O of that pertained unto Joash the Aiserite, and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. Amen. And you may take your seat this morning. In chapter 7 verse 18 it says uh and this is Gideon speaking when I blow with a trumpet I and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So I would like to title my thought here this morning, the sword of the Lord and of Gideon. I it's very important and I and I and I want to the Lord willing expound a little bit about that because uh Gideon came to a place in his life to where it just wasn't the sword of the Lord. He came to a place where of of of uh a a place of position and a place of confidence in the in himself and not just in the Lord that he said uh this is the sword of the Lord and of Gideon. And so where I want to perhaps go this morning is that I I want us all to realize that we have the sword of the Lord, &gt;&gt; but we don't just want to leave it as the sword of the Lord, but we want it to be the sword of the Lord and &gt;&gt; put your name there. &gt;&gt; Don't just leave it the sword of the Lord and and and and a two-edged sword or the sword of of the Lord and Brham. But I want you now to take your name and put it in that place because now it'll give you a place of position and authority alongside the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's where I want to go to. I don't exactly know how I'm going to get there, but we're going to get there &gt;&gt; by the help of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we just read in our opening scripture how that um Gideon was threshing wheat by the wine press. And for those of you that, you know, it's very easy just to skip over this portion of scripture and and say, "Yeah, he was threshing wheat at the wine press." Well, you're not supposed to thresh wheat at the wine press. You're supposed to press wine at the wine press. you're supposed to thresh wheat at the threshing floor. And so the re his reasoning for doing this was because um Gideon was living his life as an Israelite, as a Jew in a in a in a in a way of fear. And so he was fearful of the Amalachites. He was fearful of the Midianites and and and all the countries of the East because they were as grasshoppers. They they they were they were as grasshoppers in multitude. And here he was, he was a let's call him a son of God. That it can make it a little more relatable for you and I. Here he was as a son of God and he's trying to feed his family and he's and he's living in the promised land and and and and he's harvesting his his wheat. And the reason that he's harvesting his wheat is because he was a man of diligence. He was, "You can't harvest wheat without first planting wheat. &gt;&gt; You can't plant wheat before you till the ground and you put in the work and and and then the rest of it, you kind of you have to leave it up to God." People say, "We'll leave it up to mother nature. We'll we'll do our thing. We'll leave it up to mother nature." That's not what it is. We'll leave it up to God to bring the increase. So the reason that he was able to uh harvest his wheat is because he was a man of diligence. And so for us as sons and daughters of God, we need to make sure that we are diligent in our life with Christ. And what does it mean to be to be diligent? What does it mean to be diligent as a Christian? Well, it means that we first must uh plant the right kind of crop. We must first plant the right kind of seed because whatever seed that we plant, that is the seed that's going to bring forth. That's the kind of plant and the kind of fruit that our lives are going to materialize. Why? Because it's a law of God that whatever seed goes into the ground, that seed is going to produce itself uh uh at a time of harvest. And so it is with our lives. It's it's it's so um it's kind of uh interesting how that we expect to to have uh a spiritual life with Christ and we expect to have an overcoming life with God and a closer walk with the Lord, but instead of sowing to the to the spiritual, we sow more to the natural man. Instead of sowing to the supernatural, we sow to the carnal. And we sow to the carnal expecting spiritual results. And that just isn't going to happen. Whenever we sow to the carnal man, we're going to reap carnal results. And so my question to you this morning and to myself as I as I preach and minister these things, what kind of seed are we planting in the grounds of my heart? Cuz understand on a Wednesday and Sunday is just not good enough. All right. &gt;&gt; Well, I go to church on a Wednesday and I go to church on a Sunday and I'm there and I'm faithful and that's great and we love that. But what about Monday and Tuesday? &gt;&gt; What about Thursday, Friday and Saturday? What about the rest of the days of the week, the rest of the time on a Sunday or on a Wednesday? What kind of seed are we sewing in our lives? &gt;&gt; Amen. because whatever kind of seed we sew in our heart, it's going to produce something. &gt;&gt; And so, it's really interesting when you begin to think about the law of of sewing and reaping. Um, you know, it it it it even not only does it uh affect us as individuals, but you know, a lot of times as as families, we expect the most out of our kids. We expect the most out of our family. We're we're believers in the word and we go to church and and we take it seriously and and and we expect our children to to to walk the line and to have a standard and so on and so forth. But so much of the time as parents here is where we fail. We expect something out of our family. We expect something out of our children, out of our husband, out of our wife, whatever it is. But we never give the way to get to that spot. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we expect everything up here. But yet you see let's let's let's put it like this. So God has an expectation for you and I. &gt;&gt; He has an expectation for us to come to a place of repentance in our lives. &gt;&gt; He has an expectation for us and how we live our lives. He has an expectation for us to receive the Holy Ghost. And not only does he have the expectation, but he provides a way in order for us to come up to that standard and to live up to that expectation. &gt;&gt; But as parents, what we fail to do is we we expect you to walk a certain line or a certain road and we expect you to come up in a certain way, but we don't give the way and how to do it. And so our expectations of our children is actually, let me say it like this. This is what you, brother Eugene Braun, would say, it's evil. &gt;&gt; And the reason that it's evil is because we're expecting something, but we're not providing the way in order for the fruits to fruition. Right. &gt;&gt; We expect something in our family's lives, but we're not planting the seed in their heart that's going to bring forth what we're expecting. So, a lot of times we're expecting uh X, Y, and Z. But really, we're planting A, B, and C. And so, we're planting A, B, and C in our own hearts, in our wife's life, in our children's life, in our church family life. and we're planting ABC, but we're expecting to get X, Y, and Z. And then we get frustrated when we don't get ABC, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And so I believe, and I've been really I'm just preaching from my heart. I've been really taking a uh an inward inventory of myself &gt;&gt; and and realizing, you know, uh where I'm at in life and realizing where my family is at and my children and and and realizing the responsibility now that I just can't expect them to get to a certain place if I don't provide the way for them to get there. And if I don't provide the way for them to get what I'm expecting out of them, it's not their fault. &gt;&gt; It's my fault. &gt;&gt; And I'm really looking in inwardly like it's it's pretty heavy. &gt;&gt; And maybe it's just God taking me to a higher standard. It's it's just God bringing me up another level or I I don't know what it is. Even this sermon this morning, I I I was up to 1:00 last night and I'm thinking, man, where am I? And I there's just no inspiration. There's just absolutely no anointing. I have a little direction and that's it. And I'm like, Lord, what's going on? &gt;&gt; Here I am before the people and and there's an expectation in their hearts that they want to hear from you and not from me. And and here I am and I don't have anything. And so perhaps it's God just taking me away from the comfort of of of a structured sermon. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because who says that a sermon has to be structured in a certain way. &gt;&gt; That's perhaps just me. &gt;&gt; That's perhaps what I expect a sermon to be. But perhaps God is is just taking me out another channel. And he's saying, "Stephen, there's more ways than one way to skin a cat. &gt;&gt; Just because you think it has to be structured, it doesn't mean it has to be structured and how you want it to be. &gt;&gt; So you got to walk by faith." &gt;&gt; And so God, he doesn't expect you to have everything all figured out. Actually, he wants you not to have it all figured out because his ways are above our ways. and the ways that he takes us is different than our carnal man. But so much of the time we struggle with our will and with God's will. &gt;&gt; But God wants you to surrender your life. He wants you to surrender your way of walking, your way of living, your way of raising your family and say, "Son, this is how I want you to do it." And in order to do that, you've got to walk by faith. [Music] Because God doesn't show us everything right away, &gt;&gt; but it's one step at a time. &gt;&gt; Where are you going, Abraham? I don't know. &gt;&gt; But I'm walking and I'm walking by faith and I've heard a voice and he told me to separate from my family and I've separated from Lot and I have all these. I have this covenant that I don't deserve. this covenant that God has given to me that I haven't done nothing to deserve. But it's but it's his election. It's his sovereign grace that he's reaching out to me. Where are you going? I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; How are you going to get there? I'm going to walk &gt;&gt; unless he takes me home. &gt;&gt; And so that's how it is with you and I. We get so structured. We get we put God in this tiny little box &gt;&gt; and we say, "Lord, whenever you've met my requirements and when the time is right, I'm going to open this little box because I think that this is how you want to do it." &gt;&gt; We ought to take God out of the box. &gt;&gt; Because when you have God in a little box, you're you're you're you're binding him. &gt;&gt; You're binding him. Brother Brandham said that through denominational creeds and dogmas, the Holy Spirit was bound for 2,000 years. How many knows the quote? Well, now in the message, we bang God with our own lives, thinking, "Well, this is how I want to do it and the way that I want to go and this and this and this." And we put God in this little box. And what we do to God is we bind him working in our lives. &gt;&gt; We ought to let God free once in a while and say, "Lord, you know what I'm going to do with my paycheck this week? I'm going to give it away and I'm going to do this and I'm going to walk by complete faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because it's opposite to our carnal man. &gt;&gt; That's walking by faith. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steve, &gt;&gt; I don't have to have it all figured out." Mm- &gt;&gt; I don't have to have every every every inch of my life planned out of how I'm going to get there. No, &gt;&gt; it's good to plan. But let me say, let me put it like this. It's good to plan ahead cuz cuz if you plan to fail, you might as well if you fail to plan, you might as well plan to fail. &gt;&gt; But let me put it like this. Be flexible with God. &gt;&gt; That when God places something in your heart, you're not so structured that you can't get out of the way to where God wants you to be. &gt;&gt; So a plan is good, but be flexible. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we see that this was a time of harvest &gt;&gt; for Gideon. He had did the work. He had tilled the soil. He had planted the seed. He had did everything that he could do. And he had a harvest. It was a time of harvest. And so, he was able to harvest because he went and he did all of the right things. Now, we find that his reasoning for um being at the wine press is because uh Satan is is because he was scared of of of the Amalachites and all those different people. And his reasoning for having fear was it was very natural, I suppose. &gt;&gt; You ever been bullied in your life? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You ever had someone that come up to you, you know, give me your lunch money and you know, you little you little weed, you little whatever. You know, you're different. You know, we think about bullying of of of, you know, fighting and and and stuff and just give me that and I'm bigger than you and I'm stronger than you and I'm going to take that from you and you know, bullies. You know, nobody likes a bully, &gt;&gt; right? You boys know that. &gt;&gt; You middle-aged men know that. &gt;&gt; You older men know that &gt;&gt; that nobody likes a bully. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are you a bully or were you bullied? &gt;&gt; You know what the best thing to do to a bully is? You stand up to him. Right. &gt;&gt; Well, what if? &gt;&gt; What if? &gt;&gt; So much of the time we think of bullying as fighting and getting a black eye and a bloody nose and so on and so forth. And you go home with your shirt ripped open and raggedy and I got bullied today at school and it was just terrible. But now bullying we see it goes from the physical to verbal. &gt;&gt; You know that you can verbally bully each other. &gt;&gt; And do you know it just doesn't happen at school. &gt;&gt; It just doesn't happen at work. &gt;&gt; But unfortunately you see bullying happening within the house of God. &gt;&gt; So how do we bully each other? Let me say this. that bullying shouldn't be once mentioned amongst the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because what it is, it is carnal &gt;&gt; and a form of bullying. Why does somebody bully somebody else? &gt;&gt; They do it to make themselves feel good. &gt;&gt; They do it because I'm bigger, I'm stronger, I'm faster, and I can do whatever I want to. Therefore, I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's something within their own heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that they're not happy with. Perhaps it happened down the family tree or down the line. Perhaps they were mistreated by dad. &gt;&gt; And because they were mistreated by dad, guess what? They want to mistreat other people. &gt;&gt; Understand that is complete evil. And when that happens, we have to be extremely careful and we have to recognize it within our own lives &gt;&gt; because each of you have it within you. No matter the size, no matter how strong you are, how weak you are, how tall you are, or how short you are, all of you have it within you. The ability to be a bully. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not taking someone else's money. I'm not stealing their things away. No, but you're stealing their joy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, but you're stealing their confidence in God. You're stealing their confidence in the word. You're stealing their confidence in the pastor, the ministry, the deacon board, whatever it may be. How am I doing that? By your words. We hear lots about cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is not something that's physical. It is something that is mental. &gt;&gt; And when it affects the mind, guess what it does to our spirits? It bruises our spirits. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me give you an example. The woman came up before brother Brandham, 20th century prophet. And here she was and she's t brother Brandham's talking to her. And uh forgive me if I get the exact quotations mixed up, but she's crying and and and I forget what it was. It was heart something to do with her heart or something. But what I'm trying to get to is somebody told a lie about her. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And somebody called her a witch. &gt;&gt; And it bothered her so much as a daughter of God that nobody nobody physically touched her. Nobody got her in a headlock and and and and punched her a bunch of times and and took her money in her wallet and her shoes. No. &gt;&gt; It was verbal. &gt;&gt; And because somebody called her a witch and because of the person that done it, it was a minister. &gt;&gt; It affected her so much that here she is, she's got this trouble within her body. First of all, it starts within her mind and it goes and it bruises her spirit. And after it bruises the spirit, then it begins to take control of her physical body. Why? Why was she sick in her body? Because she was sick in her mind and in her spirit because of the wounds of the words that a preacher said to her. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he told her, "You're not a witch." &gt;&gt; Now understand, how did he discern it? He was discerning her spirit &gt;&gt; because it was on her spirit. Amen. It was her spirit that was that was attacked, bruised, and wounded. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it went from here into the inside, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not a witch. You're okay. You're just all worked up because they've been saying these things about you. You're going to be fine." And and you can tell the release in her body, the her outward expression. She's all, "Wow, well, I'm going to be healed. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm not a witch." You tell someone they're a witch more often enough they'll begin to believe it. &gt;&gt; So now we can bring this story into our own lives, into our own minds, into our famil family's lives, into our children, how we how we rule our homes and how we go about our business. We need to be careful number one what we say to ourselves, but number two, what we say to others around us. I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; Joke. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever said that to you? &gt;&gt; JK. Lol. [Laughter] Huh? Everybody ever said something to you, "Oh, I'm just kidding. You look great." I do. No, you don't. &gt;&gt; Well, do I look good or do I not? I don't know. I need someone to tell me. &gt;&gt; But so much of the times we have absolutely no under no no uh understanding of the effect that our words &gt;&gt; are having on each other, &gt;&gt; on those around us and on ourselves. &gt;&gt; Because the more that we begin to tell ourselves things and the more that we feed our wounded spirit, guess what happens? &gt;&gt; We take it out on everybody around us. &gt;&gt; Come on. True. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is this called? You could call this demonology. &gt;&gt; Of spirits &gt;&gt; affecting us because brother Brandham said this. He said that words travel on &gt;&gt; spirits travel on &gt;&gt; words. So brother Brandham would tell us that the the titles of father son and holy ghost that the devil travels on these titles. Yes. &gt;&gt; So the words that we're speaking to our family members, our children, our siblings, the people at church, we ought to we ought to do away with the whole foolish gesting thing. That's what the Bible calls it. &gt;&gt; And guess what? We all do it. &gt;&gt; We've all been there. And we'll all be there again. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's in every one of us the ability to be a bully. because of your humanity. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many bullies we got within the church. Let's raise your hands. &gt;&gt; Every hand ought to go up cuz if you're not bullying somebody else, you're bullying yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the question to ask is, is that what I want to be? Is that what I want to be known as? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Is that what I want my children to see me? Is that what I want the people in the church? Is that the answer to these questions is no. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now it's up to us to realize. Okay, Steve. Uh yeah, you need to watch your mouth. Right? &gt;&gt; You need to have a little bit more respect for your fellow peers. &gt;&gt; Cuz understand this. &gt;&gt; I'll say that every one of us in here are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That means that God is our father. &gt;&gt; That means whenever you come against one of God's children, you're coming against the father. And he is a jealous God &gt;&gt; over his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is true. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; A lot of times I feel we need to be put in remembrance sometimes of gossip and &gt;&gt; so on and so forth and this and that and this church and that church and this and that and we can all get we're such a we're such a tight-knit group &gt;&gt; even within the message. &gt;&gt; The message of a whole is not very big. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And so it's so easy for us to be in everybody else's business. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You hear about these people in Canada? Did you hear about people in Australia? Did you hear this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Who cares? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But before we know it, we're we're just this. We're an open garbage can and we just take whatever everybody saying, putting all their trash in our minds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and all of a sudden our spirit is defiled. &gt;&gt; God keep our spirits clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see then Gideon here he was and he was he was he was thrashing at the wine press. He was threshing his wheat for fear of these guys because Satan was a bully. And now we we're you guys are going to be thinking about bullies all week. And that's good. It's for us. What am I doing? Hey, it's making us aware. Just like when brother James preached on on value, guess what? All week, what were we thinking about? Value. What is value to me? What is not valuable to me? What is it in my life that I'm giving too much value to? &gt;&gt; We're thinking about it all week. Why? Because the word of God has an effect. So the reason that he was able to harvest was because what he had planted had come into maturity and it could be harvested for the use of food. In Matthew 13 24-30, the Bible says another parable putting forth unto them saying, "The kingdom of of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field. But while a man slept, his enemy came and sowed tears amongst the wheat and went his way. And when when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tears also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, "Sir, didest not thou sew good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tears?" He said unto them, "An enemy hath done this?" The servant said unto him, "Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest while ye gather up the tears, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let them both grow until together together until the harvest. And in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, gather ye together first the tears, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn. So, we can see from this from this parable that we just read that there's two seeds that have been sold in this earth. There's been a seed of wheat and a seed of tears. A good seed and a bad seed. uh a h a a a seed of faith and a seed of unbelief. And really it boils down to two things. It boils down to the seed of God and to the seed of Satan. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we see that when these seeds were first planted was in the garden of Eden when Satan threw the serpent through the beast, excuse me, he swed his seed to Eve and it had a a reproduction and it reproduced itself because every seed must bring forth after its kind. So, we see that the seed of the serpent brought forth uh a a fruit and that fruit was Cain. And we can tell by the manifestation of Cain's life that he was of the serpent, the devil. Why? Because the manifestation of his life, it brought forth after the manner of Satan. And so we understand that in order for Adam to redeem Eve, Adam had to go in onto her himself. Adam had a choice. Adam had a choice whether to leave Eve in sin, shaped in iniquity just to uh to be banished from the Garden of Eden and the very presence of God or to say she is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. Because she was taken of me, she is a part of me. And if she dies, I die. &gt;&gt; Therefore, if she's going to die, I'm going to redeem her and I'm going to die with her. And so, we understand that Jesus Christ did the same for you and I. Why? Because he came to redeem those who were a part of him before the foundations of the world. How did he redeem us? He redeemed us by becoming sin. &gt;&gt; Become sinful because there was no sin in his life. But he became sin. &gt;&gt; That I might become him by grace. &gt;&gt; The word became flesh so that his flesh might become the word. And that's where we are here in this harvest time is that the seed that was planted back here in Ephesus is now shooting forth and bringing forth fruit and reproducing itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We don't have anything different than what they had in the Ephesian church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't have &gt;&gt; because the seed was planted there. That's right. &gt;&gt; And now it's coming to fruition here. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "When I saw the vision of the bride, the first one that came by, there she was. Oh, she was pure and clean and so on and so forth." He said, ' Then I saw the last day bride and oh man, remember is this is what my ministries produced. &gt;&gt; But then he saw the bride because that was the church. &gt;&gt; And the last day bride when she came forth, she looked exactly like the first age bride. Why? Because it was the same seed bringing forth the same manifestations. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Life of his life, bone of his bone. bringing forth him. &gt;&gt; Adam brought forth Abel who was a righteous man who was a man of revelation. Why did Adam seed bring forth a righteous man who could walk by faith and offer a sacrifice to God uh that was pleasing to God with the correct revelation &gt;&gt; because he had the right seed and he had the right father. &gt;&gt; Right? And so you can't help what you bring forth. &gt;&gt; If you come from God, you're going to bring forth the fruits of that seed that lays within your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what does that do for us? &gt;&gt; If we have a true revelation of who we are and where we came from and where we're going and we have a true revelation that we are sons and daughters of God, what does that do for us in our lives? It gives us peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz we're going to find out the angel went to Gideon and he said, "Fear not. Peace be onto thee." &gt;&gt; The angel's message, what did it do to him? It brought peace. It told him, "Fear not." Understand, Brother Brandham told us this. He said, "A sheep doesn't have to manufacture wool." &gt;&gt; A sheep just bears wool. &gt;&gt; And sons and daughters of God, we don't have to make ourselves do anything. We just got to walk by faith and let God do the word. Because as long as we are in the word, as long as we are in the presence of the son, it's going to draw all of the life out of the sea to bring it to a full manifestation. Why? Because he wants to have a harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz we are living right now in the harvest time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; True. So let me let me see here. Excuse me just for a second. So brother Brandham said in the resume of the church of the ages the church age book. And so we come to the last church age that is our age. We know it is it is the last age for the Jews are back in Palestine. Notice if you want to see God's time piece, look at the Jews. &gt;&gt; No matter how they got there, they are there. I love that. So, Brother Brandham is acknowledging the way that they got there might have seemed to the carnal man a little um uh heavy-handed. Let's just say that &gt;&gt; that God would cause these wars and that God would cause uh Hitler and Stalin and these different men to rise up with a hatred within their hearts for the Jewish people that he would take them to concentration camps and and burn them up and smoke them up and kill them and and and do all these uh horrible horrific things to the Jewish people that he would look at that there and he would say it was the tender, merciful hand of Jehovah that was bringing the Jews Jews back into their homeland. &gt;&gt; So, as a carnal person, me and you, you and I, we look at it and we say, "That doesn't seem tender to me." &gt;&gt; It doesn't seem very merciful to me. &gt;&gt; It doesn't seem like that would be the hand of God. But understand, God knows what to do to his children to get them into their uh correct uh placing within the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew exactly what he had to do to those Jewish people in order to get them into their homeland. &gt;&gt; But let me ask you a question. I forget which seal it's under. The souls that are under the altar. &gt;&gt; You know who they are? &gt;&gt; They are the they are the the Jews that were martyed &gt;&gt; at those times. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, here we see these Jews that that that had never accepted Christ. Are they a part of the 144,000? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; 144,000 is completely different. Hasn't happened yet. But these people under the fifth seal, &gt;&gt; souls under the altars crying with vengeance, how long, Lord? How long is it going to be until you avenge us of these things that happened? &gt;&gt; But here they are. They're given white robes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, you talk about the grace of God. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, would those Jews have been better off staying around the whole world and just living in sin and dying and go going to hell or were they better going to those concentration camps &gt;&gt; in order to receive something for go from God because they were martyed of their lives just because of their nationality? Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's mercy. &gt;&gt; That's grace. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I haven't even gotten to any of this yet. And that's okay. Sometimes sometimes uh within the scripture, we think just like Gideon and we think, well, if God is with me, number one, where's all his miracles? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And if God is with me, number two, why are all these things happening to us? &gt;&gt; A lot of times we don't understand in our own lives of why things are happening and this family member and that and situations and we and we don't understand why. But we've got to have faith and trust in the plan of God for our life. &gt;&gt; So though it may not feel tender, yet it's tender. Though it may not feel merciful, yet it's merciful. Why? Because the plan of God is greater than our emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. The &gt;&gt; plan of God is greater than our feelings and how we feel about things. But the plan of God is the grace of God to get us into the proper position that he might use us. &gt;&gt; The sword of the Lord and of Gideon. &gt;&gt; It becomes one. Why does it become one? Because now God uses Gideon with the sword of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said it's harvest and this uh they no matter how they got there, they are there. He said and this is harvest time. So now he's talking about Leodysia. He's talking about the Jews in their homeland. And now he's bringing it to us. And he's saying this is harvest time. So what time are we living in right now? We're living in the harvest time. &gt;&gt; But before there can be a harvest, there has to be a ripening, &gt;&gt; a maturing of both the vines. Notice, not just a maturing of of the vine of the bride of Christ, but a maturing of the serpent seed and the false vine. And what's interesting with this is Satan Satan thought he got one over on on God whenever he multiplied himself in the human race. But he took it one step further that when he saw that God wanted to have a church, now he injected himself within the the ranks of the church. And so now the true vine and the false vine is intertwined throughout the church ages throughout every church, throughout every family, and throughout every person. Because within all of those things, there's a believer, a makebeliever, and an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Within your own body, hallelujah, you have a believer, which is your which is that seed gene of God, which believes no matter what. You have an unbeliever which is your flesh and you have a makebeliever which is your spirit. &gt;&gt; And it all depends on which one you cater to. &gt;&gt; You say, "I feel like an unbeliever in my life." Well, you're catering to the unbeliever too much. You got to cater to the inside man. Make a differentiation between the seed and the flesh, between the believer and the unbeliever. But too much of the time with our spirit and our mind, we are catering. We got two against one. &gt;&gt; We got a we got an unbeliever and a makebeliever against a believer. &gt;&gt; And the problem with that is we only understand everything we see. We understand with the outside man. &gt;&gt; And we try to bring that carnality into our Christian walk with God. &gt;&gt; Understand it. It it shouldn't be there. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we shouldn't be trying to understand God with a carnal uh uncircumcised mind. &gt;&gt; But we ought to be understanding God through a prophet messenger and looking through the eyes of a prophet and feeding our soul and saying, "This is what I believe." &gt;&gt; Which says, "No matter what I see, taste, feel, smell, or hear, &gt;&gt; as long as it's against the word of God, I'm not believing it. I'm not catering to it. And we ought to separate those two guys. &gt;&gt; That's our problem sometimes. &gt;&gt; We fail to split the believer from the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; And we cater to the unbeliever way too much. Why? Because that's where we're living at. &gt;&gt; And understand that's where the battle is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you say, "I'm I'm fighting. I'm in a battle and I'm struggling." That's good &gt;&gt; because if you're struggling, it means there's something that's struggling against something else. &gt;&gt; You ever had a thumbs war with somebody? &gt;&gt; It's a struggle. &gt;&gt; That's what's going on within our lives. &gt;&gt; We have a constant thumbsy war, a constant struggle between two natures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I would be worried if there was no struggle. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if there's no struggle, there's one nature &gt;&gt; and the nature is carnal. &gt;&gt; But if there's a struggle, &gt;&gt; I want to do right. &gt;&gt; And it's so hard &gt;&gt; and I want to do this, but I can't. And and I love it. The Apostle Paul, &gt;&gt; he he here he is. He doesn't give much into his life, but he tells us his struggle. &gt;&gt; I'm a wretched man. &gt;&gt; When I want to do good, evil is present with me. And the things that I hate, somehow I end up doing them. And I realize when I want to do good, evil is present with me. Why? Because he's always with himself. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, wretched, miserable, vile man that I am. Who's going to who's going to uh uh uh deliver me from this guy?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he gives us the answer. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is coming a time where there's going to be a complete separation of this body and the seed. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ that does it. And it won't be your good works. It won't be your good mindset. It won't be your good mentality. It won't be you trying to be something that you're not. It'll be God that does it. &gt;&gt; So, we ought to be as Ruth and just rest in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But before you can do that, &gt;&gt; you've got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't know who you are, there's no resting place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very good. That's good. &gt;&gt; He says there's got to be a ripening, a maturing of both the vines. The Lutheran age was the springtime. Wesleyan age was the summer of growth. The Leodysian age is a harvest time of gathering the tears for binding and burning and garnering the wheat for the Lord. Harvest time. It's amazing. So, both are being gathered. And you know what? They're both being gathered under different voices, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The false vine is being gathered under the voice of the church, but the true vine is being gathered under the voice of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the very voice of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so whatever voice that you're listening to in your life, [Music] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; If you're listening to Jordan Peterson more than brother Brandham, you're being gathered together for burning. If you're listening to these men that have these great ideas and and great philosophical things and and great insight to the scripture, if you're listening to that and self-help books and and and and and all those different things more than you're listening to the voice of God, &gt;&gt; you're being bound. &gt;&gt; You're not being bound for the garner as the weak, but you're being bound for something else. &gt;&gt; Saints of God, there's only one thing that'll loose. Cuz I believe that there's wheat plant that gets that gets caught up sometimes with the weed of the of the false vine, &gt;&gt; but sometimes the only thing that'll loosen it is the voice of God in this day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, those things are okay. I listen to him once in a while. &gt;&gt; Jordan Peterson. Yeah. Great insight into into certain things. Amazing. Sure. But he's binding people, &gt;&gt; his voice, his teachings, Billy Graham and all Roberts, &gt;&gt; great men of God with great ministries of God who were used greatly of God who were angel messengers of God. &gt;&gt; What is their voice and their teaching doing? &gt;&gt; It's binding the people and it's blinding them to the truth of the hour. &gt;&gt; But yet great men used greatly of God. So now you're all asking, "So brother Steven, do you think every to Billy Graham and all Roberts and and Jordan Peterson are all serpent seed?" Nope. &gt;&gt; I don't. Let's take his follow his teaching. He said, "I believe there's there's sons and daughters of God in all those denominations." &gt;&gt; Wow. You talk about grace. So notice, have you noticed that in the harvest time though there is a real accelerate acceleration in the ripening there is consequently a slowing of growth until there is no growth. by if that doesn't if that doesn't say where we're at right now, I don't know what does. &gt;&gt; Just seems like there's no growth. That there was a fast acceleration of growth from the time that brother Brandon went off the scene to I don't know if you could put a number on it, but we can tell of an assurance that the growth, the acceleration of growth has slowed down. People aren't getting converted like they used to get converted. When was the last time that there was a a person from the street came in and got converted within the church? &gt;&gt; Far and few between. &gt;&gt; Not to say that it doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; But it does happen. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't happen as much as it used to. Why is it our fault? No. It's just where we are in the &gt;&gt; pyramid of God. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said at the very base of the pyramid why there was 4,000 would get saved in one day and so many thousand would get saved in this other day. But as we go up towards the peak, it's one here and one there. It's one here and one there. The acceleration of growth is slowing down. But what does that mean? It means that it means that now we have almost grown because when a weak plant has grown to its full maturity, it's not going to grow anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like you and I as human beings, when we grow to our predestined height, you can't grow any further. &gt;&gt; I was looking at I have pictures of me. This is not a joke, so don't laugh. I have pictures of me under 14 soccer. I was the captain of the team, goalkeeper. Okay. Um, you know where they put the tall guys in the pictures? Back row. That's right. I was in the back row. Arms folded. Goalkeeper captain. That's right. I was taller than everybody. I had a really early stunt growth or growth. But now I have a stunt growth. Now I'm growing in the wrong way. And that's just natural life. Okay? &gt;&gt; People who are younger than me, you'll find out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you can only grow so tall. &gt;&gt; A wheat plant can only grow so high. It can only produce so much corn wheat. It can it can only do so much. Can only grow to a certain a certain uh a certain amount and produce a certain amount. But when it grows as much as it can grow, then it's got to ripen &gt;&gt; because it's still green. You ever see an apple, it's fully grown, but it's still it hasn't ripened fully yet. Or a banana, take a banana, this banana is still green. We got a lot of greenness in us still. So, how do we get away? How do we get the greenness out of our lives and and and have our the fruit ripen? Well, Brother Brandham said this. Brother Brandham said, "Stay in the presence of the sun. He says, "That's where we're at. The bride has to stay in the presence of the son to bake all the greenness and ripeness out of her." Why? Because a a fruit that is not ripened is not good to partake of. &gt;&gt; And so now he has brought the church to a place of maturity. And I think we could all say amen to that. Do we have a mature understanding of what they didn't have 20, 30, 40 years ago of the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So at our maturity level, we're there, but our greenness of the fruit in our lives is not ripe yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So until the fruit can is is is ripened enough, it cannot be harvested yet. &gt;&gt; So why has the Lord not come? Because the fruit hasn't ripened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So where are we? We're at the harvest time. Where are we in the harvest time? We are in the ripening stage of the fruit of yours and my life. Understand? We talk about the church coming to maturity, but it's the individuals that is coming to maturity that makes the church mature. &gt;&gt; So he says, is that not exactly what we're seeing now? The false vine is losing multitudes to communists and other various types of belief. We see that within our own country. Her numbers are not increasing as she would like us to think. Her hold on the people is not what it used to be. Christianity just really took a tank, didn't it? And in so many cases, going to church on the people is not what it used uh is is just for a show. &gt;&gt; And the true vine, what about her? Is she growing? Where are those vast numbers that keep coming to revival and answer altar calls? Are not most of them merely emotional in their approach or desires of something physical rather than desiring that which is truly spiritual? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Is this age not like the day in which Noah entered the ark and the door was shut, but yet God terried in judgment seven days. &gt;&gt; No one was literally turned to God in those silent days. And yet it was a and yet it is the harvest time. There then must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat and tears to maturity. The tears are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word. But the wheat also must mature. And to her God is sending the prophet messenger with the vindicated ministry that he might be accepted by the elect. They will hear him as the first church heard Paul. And she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride. The mighty works will be found in her that are always attendant upon the pure word and faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, where are we at now? We're in the ripening stage. &gt;&gt; A stage of getting all the greenness baked out of us. Why are we here this morning? Cuz we want the greenness out of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the sermon, the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. So old man and old woman, don't you be discouraged. If you are a representation up here in this attribute of God, if you have it, if you're represented here, you're in the eternal. And if you've crossed from that seventh day into the eighth, you got into the eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. You are included in this. He's he's he's pointing to a circle of an attribute of God on the on the blackboard. Now, if you're just trusting upon a sensation or jumping up and down or I do this, I keep my seventh day, I don't eat meat and things like that, that's going to perish anyhow. But this is the eternal. See, this is the eternal. The feast after the feast of tabernacles. See, the feast of tabernacles was the last feast, the seventh feast. We are worshiping now under the feast of the tabernacles, the seventh church age. In the millennium, it will be under the feast of tabernacles again in the seventh day. But then after the seventh day, we have a holy convocation, go back into the eternal hell by the eternal one that came and redeemed us and taken us back, letting us recognize that we were a part of this. &gt;&gt; So if you don't fully recognize it here, you'll fully recognize it over there. &gt;&gt; That makes makes me feel really good. in uh paragraph uh 40 457. Now, how do you know you're apart? Because at the word of the hour, the promise of the day, what is it? A restoration back to the first day, the first. See, he's talking about going back to where we came from. That's what the eighth day is all about. Seven days, seven church ages. Once the seven church ages is finished and the millennium is done with, then we go back to what we were in the beginning. And saints of God, that's what we want to go back to. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just go to a millennium. &gt;&gt; But I want to go past the millennium to the streets of gold &gt;&gt; because there's a difference. Because in the millennium, it's still a space of time. &gt;&gt; A millennium is a thousand years. A thousand year reign. And after that, we walk out upon the ashes of the wicked. But we're still in the feast of tabernacles at that time, the seventh age. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. So, I want to go past the millennium and I want to go past what is it? Gog and &gt;&gt; Magog. &gt;&gt; To a place that is prepared &gt;&gt; for me. &gt;&gt; That's my end goal. Notice this. It's very interesting. This is a few paragraphs back in the same scripture. Um, paragraph 215 we just finished in 24 257. Notice it was also upon this eighth day, last day, feast day of the tabernacle. Notice after that, after the last feast day, after the last church age, after the last complete seven days upon the earth, after the millennium that this holy convocation comes, remember this is feast of tabernacles, tabernacles, gathering places. Amen. Where in the millennium they shall build houses, they shall inhabit. But in the new earth, he has already went and prepared the place. It's built. We have nothing to do with building of it. Amen. Oh, I just love that word. A holy convocation. The eighth day, which is only seven days. Then on the eighth day, which comes back to the first again, comes right back to the first. The eighth day is a holy convocation. Notice seven days only has to do with the old creation, world time. Seven days, that's a millennium. the rest day. As God labored six days, rested the seventh. The church labored six days and rests the seventh, but you're still in time element. &gt;&gt; So when we jump back up to the previous quote, brother Brandham said, "We are worshiping now under the feast of the tabernacles." Paragraph 454. But he tells us that this feast of tabernacles it is the seventh day but he tells us very plainly there he says uh tabernacles gathering places paragraph 216. Amen. Where in the millennium? &gt;&gt; So when does the feast of tabernacles take place? Takes place in the millennium. So what is this feast of tabernacles? The feast of tabernacles was the seventh tabernacle. Now, brother Brandham said we are worshiping now in the feast of tabernacles. So now we are actually worshiping God in a place that we haven't been to yet cuz he said the feast of the tabernacles is in the millennium which means it's a changing of dwelling. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So the feast of tabernacles what they did was is called the booths. Have you ever read that within your scripture? It was at the final time of harvest. And they would have the the harvest time and they would take these little booths and they would they would build these booths um near to the fields where they were harvesting. And they would do that in remembrance of their journey through the wilderness of how they had booths and houses and how they would build these things and how that God would meet their needs. He would feed him with mana and he would give him uh uh uh uh water from a rock. Uh though they were dwelling in different dwelling tabernacles, the feast of tabernacles, the feast of booths, a changing of dwelling place, a changing of bodies, a changing of dispensations, a changing of a dwelling place. So now we're not there yet, but we are worshiping there right now. &gt;&gt; So what is it that what is it that we all love to worship about? It's the changing of our bodies. &gt;&gt; The changing of this vile, miserable man, the changing of this dwelling place from this earthly to the heavenly. &gt;&gt; We are already worshiping there now. That's where we're at. But the actual takes place in its in its reality form is in the millennium &gt;&gt; when our bodies are changed, our dwelling places are changed, our booths are changed, then we're not only worshiping in the feast of tabernacles, but we'll be dwelling and living in the feast of tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when does the feast what comes after the feast of tabernacles? &gt;&gt; A holy convocation. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls it the eighth day. &gt;&gt; Back to the beginning again because the feast of tabernacles. We're still in time element. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; The millennium thousand-y year reign is still time. Time has not been done away with yet. But after the seventh comes the eighth. And the eighth brings us back to the first. And the first is where we want to get to back to where we were in the beginning with God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; The feast of tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a day that'll be. &gt;&gt; So now we see picking up our our story with Gideon. Um in verse 12 of chapter 6, brother Brandham says or the Bible says, "And there came an angel of the Lord and set under an oak." Verse 11, "Which was an Ofra that pertained to Joash the aiserite and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midionites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him, the Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." And God Gideon said unto God, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then has all this befallen us? And where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of sand? Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. So now he's beginning to question, hey, if God is with us, why are we here? Why is all this befallen us? If I am a mighty man of valor, why am I why am I hiding? Why am I threshing wheat in a wine press? Why do I have this fear about me? It's because he never had a a a he never understood his identity from God. &gt;&gt; He had never really met God face to face. He was living his life according to his family heritage. &gt;&gt; He didn't understand where he was from. And because he didn't know or he didn't have that relationship with God yet, he had never met God face to face. Guess what? He had no value in the things of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you don't know your true identity, you cannot have value in it. But when you have a true identity and when you don't have no value in who you are as a son of God, you'll take your value from somewhere else. &gt;&gt; So if you don't understand who you are in the great plan of God and why he has uh sent you here at such a time as this, without an identity, there is no value. And if you don't value the things of God, you will not value yourself as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Just like the one guy uh um uh um what would you call it? He was um you remember the slave. The slave. &gt;&gt; He's different. This guy, man, he I want to buy him. He's a good worker. He he this and that and the other. He's different than all these other guys. Don't got to whip him to work. He's a good guy. And no, he's not for sale. Well, I want him. He's not for sale. Well, what makes him different? Do you feed him different? No, I don't feed him different. Does he sleep somewhere different? No, he sleeps everybody else. Why is he so different? You want to know why he was different than everybody else? &gt;&gt; He had value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a value of where he came from. And he understood not only who his father was &gt;&gt; cuz you can understand who your father is, but not who you are. So he not only understood who his father was, but he realized and he understood the blood that dwells within him is not a normal blood. It's the blood of a king of a royal family. And because he had value in that, his life was different than everybody else's. &gt;&gt; Gordmen. So now you can take this this this this identity and value that with identity there comes value. Talking about Christianity and we can take that and you can take a boy and a girl that's raised in the church that doesn't know their true identity as a son or a daughter of God. Therefore they don't value the things of God and it's in our lives. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So we could take a young girl for instance or let me say a young woman and she comes into womanhood and she doesn't understand the value of her of her body that God has given her. It's a it's it's it's a jewel. Something that should be protected. It's something that should be um reserved and not flaunted or shown before everybody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a godly value &gt;&gt; of a young lady that will dress in modesty and and and with a meek and quiet and gentle spirit. &gt;&gt; But take that same person that has no heavenly identity &gt;&gt; and they'll take their identity from their carnal natural family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the opposite happens. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now the body is shown. Now the body is flaunted. Now, there's no meekness. There's no there's none of these attributes that we expect from a daughter of God by the word of God. &gt;&gt; You guys understand that? &gt;&gt; Not not just cuz the minister's saying it, but because it's scriptural. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; And so, without a heavenly value, a heavenly identity. We have no value in the things of God to live our lives accordingly. &gt;&gt; So, now take a young man. It's the exact same thing. No heavenly identity, no spiritual value. And it shows in our lives. Now what happens is if you put these two together, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; what kind of marriage are they going to have? &gt;&gt; It's going to be a mess. &gt;&gt; Why is it going to be a mess? Because there's no heavenly identity. And the only thing that will keep a family together in this age is a heavenly identity within the family between the man and the woman. &gt;&gt; If there's identity missing between one or the other, the family is going to have a hard time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the children are going to have a hard time. Why? Because they're fighting and waring one with another. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's an identity missing somewhere. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what happens now we get two people that have an identity crisis &gt;&gt; and within the message, you know, I wasn't raised in the message. You know what? You know what our our biggest fault is within the message? As soon as a girl turns 16 and he turns 19, yeah, let's get them hooked up. Let's get them married. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cuz they've been raised in church. That doesn't mean squat. &gt;&gt; That don't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. It doesn't just, well, we were born in the church and we were raised around it and yeah, praise the Lord. Good for you. That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; But yet, if there's no heavenly identity, &gt;&gt; that identity cannot uh transfer. Amen. It cannot transfer into the family. &gt;&gt; So, you see the importance in in number one, having yourself right &gt;&gt; before you get married. &gt;&gt; You got to be right cuz if you're not right, the marriage won't be right. And the same goes on the other side. &gt;&gt; But not only you have to make yourself right, you have to make sure that the person you're picking is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Oh, he he's got small feet and smells good." That's what the girl told him. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great. &gt;&gt; His feet won't smell good for very much longer. That's a that's an excuse from a person that has no heavenly identity &gt;&gt; because a sister that has a heavenly identity will look at the guy and say, "He's not spiritual. &gt;&gt; He can't keep a job. &gt;&gt; How's he going to raise? &gt;&gt; How's he going to treat me right? How how's this going to happen?" And that's what a spiritual girl should be thinking. &gt;&gt; And a spiritual guy should be thinking. What kind of mother is she going to be to my kids? Right. &gt;&gt; Not if she already has a good job. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Well, she has a good job already. She got money in the bank. &gt;&gt; She got this. She's a catch, &gt;&gt; but she's not spiritual. &gt;&gt; What happens if she has all those things and she's got that wild sterei &gt;&gt; that if you're not spiritual, you don't catch it? Amen. &gt;&gt; And what happens if you're not spiritual and you don't catch it? We're going to have problems. &gt;&gt; You see, it all transfers. &gt;&gt; And so then take the two people, no identity. They're going to church. They're they're they're paying their tithe. They're doing what's right, but yet there's there's no true identity with their father, their father, God. And so they begin to look elsewhere and to get their identity, whether it's in their their their family nature, whatever it may be, I don't know. But now take them and have them have children and have them raise the children. What kind of children are we going to have? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, it's it's pretty serious, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and I feel that we've married kids off too early. &gt;&gt; I do. That's And if I'm wrong in that, that's okay. That's my opinion. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I was 25 when I got married, okay? And I was not ready a day before. &gt;&gt; Some of you are maybe more mature than me, and that's good. I hope you are. But there's absolutely no way that I was ready for marriage before 25. I just wasn't. &gt;&gt; It would have been a mess. &gt;&gt; Absolute mess because I was all over the place. &gt;&gt; Ah, should I go here or here? Didn't know how to take care of things. and you know just doing my thing and I wasn't ready before. Amos is laughing cuz he knows. He knows me before I was 25. And then marriage marriage changed everything. Nonsense. No, it didn't. Doesn't change anything. But I got a wife that had a heavenly identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that helped me a lot. So did I. But before that, &gt;&gt; good luck, man. True. &gt;&gt; It's interesting, isn't it? &gt;&gt; So now &gt;&gt; it's of vital importance. Start off with the guys. Get your heavenly identity first from Christ &gt;&gt; before you start looking at other things. &gt;&gt; Once you get that, then you're on the basis of moving forward. &gt;&gt; And then we have young couples and we have families and stuff. Hey, where where are we getting our identities from? Because where we get it from, that's where we're going to place our value. And if we have a heavenly identity, our values is going to be scripturally based. Not man-made based, not Joe Rogan based, not uh Jordan Peterson based, not not all these guys based. No, it's going to be scripturally based by the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when we can do that, and we can just be patient. &gt;&gt; We can just be patient. We can be patient before we choose, patient when we get married, patient with our kids, just be patient with ourselves. Understand God will do a work in our lives. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But it all comes down to identity &gt;&gt; and value. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; what's his name? Gideon. Didn't understand. He didn't have he didn't have no value. But all of a sudden, he the Lord begins to tell him and and share things with him and tell him he's a he's a mighty man of valor and and and begins to tell him, "Hey, you can do this and you are a son of God and you are a Christian and you know so on and so forth." He begins encouraging Gideon, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so let me keep reading here. Fine. Um he makes a cake and everything for Gideon or Gideon makes a cake for the Lord and he presented it. Verse 20. And the angel of God said unto him, this is ver chapter six. The angel of the Lord said unto him, take the flesh and the unleaven cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth. And he did so. And the angel of the Lord put the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. And perceived that this was an angel of the Lord. Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I've seen an angel of the Lord face to face." And the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee. &gt;&gt; Fear not, thou shalt not die." &gt;&gt; Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah Shalom, unto this day. It is yet an Ofra of the Abiserites. God had to get God spent many years getting Gideon to the threshing floor or to the wine press to the to thresh his wheat. It didn't take overnight. You know, it's it's pretty interesting when you think of it this way. We think of of where we're at in life and we think of the trials and this and that and the other, but we don't understand the plan of God and how long it has taken God to get us to a certain place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we look at it and we see Gideon and we say, "Man, Gideon was a man of no faith. He was he was fearful. He he he was hiding and so on and so forth." That's our carnality. But when you look at it through God's eyes, you realize that God met him there. Uh God had an appointment to meet with Gideon. &gt;&gt; But in order to meet Gideon there, God had to make a way for Gideon to be there. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. So all of those years of of those guys stealing their crops and stealing their animals and taking up the land and so on and so forth. It caused Gideon to get into a place where he was like, "Well, the only place that I can thresh my wheat is back here in the secret place where no one else is." And that's where God meets us is in the secret places. And those secret places, they change destination, they change location. Uh but it's it's when God can get us alone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That now he begins to talk to Gideon. All those years of pushing Gideon there until finally we would say the stars aligned for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right there. &gt;&gt; This is his time. this is his appointment. I'm going to meet Gideon right there. And Gideon had no idea. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we have absolutely no idea what God is doing in our lives. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you this morning that all things work together for the good. No matter where you're at in life or what has brought you to the place where you are in life, it has all been the hand of God getting you to that place where he can deal with you directly. &gt;&gt; And it was in that place of uh fearfulness and loneliness &gt;&gt; that God now reveals himself. God didn't call himself Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; It was Gideon. Yes. &gt;&gt; It was Gideon's revelation &gt;&gt; and Gideon said this. Wow. Fear not. Wow. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God brings us to places that he might reveal certain attributes of himself to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As the musicians come, we'll bring it to a close. Vaniah asked me what time service will be over today and and I said 12:00. I'm a dad of my work today. Chapter 7 and verse uh I think it's 18. That's my opening. Let me see here. &gt;&gt; Is it is 18? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Good. Chapter 7 and verse 18 says, "When I blow with the trumpet, I and all that are with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of the camp and say, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Gideon went from a place of of of hiding and threshing at the wine press. Then he got in of the Lord. He had a call of God on his life. And then as he began, the Bible said he got anointed and he began to blow a trumpet and gather all the people. And then as he gathered all the people, he he says to himself, "Well, now what?" So now he puts a fleece before the Lord. He says, "Oh, God, if this is really you, let the fleece be this and that. Let the dew be on the fleece and the dry ground." And you know the story. I can relate so much to this story that God puts a call in your life. He asks you to do something to go somewhere, whatever, and then you don't want to do it, then you get excited about doing it and then you think, "Oh gosh, no. &gt;&gt; Let's do a let's make a fleece." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So much of the time we make all these fleeces before the Lord &gt;&gt; and God just wants us to walk by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so he God just so encouraged Gideon. went up and he heard the dream and the the the the uh interpretation of the dream and he said, "Wow, this is all true. God is actually going to do this through me." So now he was he was so uh strong in his faith and he was so certain. He goes, "Here's what we're going to do &gt;&gt; and we're going to do this that and the other and we're going to blow the trumpets and we're going to say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is no longer the sword of the Lord. What is the sword of the Lord? It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; So what was Gideon doing now? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Gideon was becoming one with the word. &gt;&gt; Gideon did not fight with swords. He fought with the trumpet and with lights and smashed these things. He didn't have a sword. So why would he say the sword of the Lord and Gideon? &gt;&gt; Because now Gideon was becoming one with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gideon was becoming one with the sword of the word, with the promise of the word. He was saying, "This is what the word has promised me today. And I'm going to take the word. I'm going to become one with the word and I'm going to move forward with the word and I'm going to fight and I'm going to battle and I'm going to struggle and I'm going to overcome." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now, Brother Brandham says that sword caught in my hand. &gt;&gt; He said it fit my hand just perfectly. He calls it the sword of the Lord, which is the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So now, what's he doing? He's becoming one &gt;&gt; with the word. &gt;&gt; Just like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, they were told, "Hey, eat up the scroll." &gt;&gt; Why did they have to eat up the scroll? Because they were the prophet and the word was becoming one. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:8. You know what's it's really interesting? If you go and you look up, take the little book, Brother Brandham hardly says it. He hardly speaks about Revelations 10:8. It's interesting. Why? Because it his part to fulfill. &gt;&gt; What is Revelations 10:8? &gt;&gt; John, take the little book. &gt;&gt; Eat it up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So then John, he hears the word of the Lord and he just doesn't stand there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. I'll do it. And he doesn't take it. &gt;&gt; No, give it to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Give me the little book. &gt;&gt; Give me the word. I want it. &gt;&gt; You're telling me to partake of it? That means I'm a part of it. I want to become a part of the word. So now he does what he's told. Here, give it to me. He doesn't ask all politely and stuff. No, it's his. He wanted it. So he takes it and he partakes of it. What happens when he partakes of it? He becomes one with the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. Was the book still open when he ate it? &gt;&gt; Sure it was. &gt;&gt; What happened to it? It changed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No longer a book is what we would see a book, &gt;&gt; but now it becomes an earthn vessel. So now the book changes dispensations. It changes form &gt;&gt; to where it's no longer a dead letter. It's no longer a closed book. And it's not just an open book, but it's an open book now. That's a part of me. And I am becoming an open book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now we become these open book people. That's what we are. We believe in the open book in the revealed word. But what does it mean? Is it just a a saying? Is it just something that we that we rejoice over and and give me the book and let me eat the book and I become the book. And so what does it actually mean? Let me share you a little bit about what it means. It means now that your life becomes an open book. &gt;&gt; So what does that mean? That means we don't have no more Achans. [Music] &gt;&gt; Achen was living his life as a closed book. &gt;&gt; These Babylonian garments and stuff. Yeah. I'll take it. I'll keep it in my home. I'll bury it. No one's going to know. &gt;&gt; Though he was part of, let me say the open book revival of taking the land, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the promise that God was giving. He was a part of it. But yet he felt that he could still be a closed book within his own home. &gt;&gt; And we all know what happens. So what does it mean for us? It means that our home is an open book. &gt;&gt; It means that our cell phones is an open book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It means that when we're by ourselves, &gt;&gt; we are open books. We are not open books at church and closed books everywhere else we go and doing as we please. No &gt;&gt; because we have partaken of the word. This open book we apply it to our lives and now our lives is open before all people. &gt;&gt; Now we got nothing to hide. Now we got no seals in our life now and people we want to use our nature and our family and all this nonsense. We are an open book. The opening of the seals has opened our lives up now that we be become a living oracle of God. A written epistle that is read of all men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's more than just words. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's a life. &gt;&gt; So, you have the ability to look at my life and to know if Stephen has partaken of the open book. That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look at my life. My wife's like our household. How I live. &gt;&gt; Does he really believe the open word? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The manifestation will make it known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me end with this. What kind of book are you producing in your life? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're living. The seals have been loosed. Praise God. It's been opened. It's been revealed. We're waiting for the coming of the Lord. We're we're we're at a place of maturity. We're we've grown. We're we're understanding the word. But I wonder where we are in our ripeness. I wonder where the fruit what kind of ripeness our fruit is bearing. And only you can answer that. &gt;&gt; And it all comes from your identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you have a true identity of God and the word for this day and what has been set before us and what we're partaking of, it will be valuable to us as believers. And we won't close it up whenever we want to, but it'll be open before everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, there There have been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God give blessed consolation that my trials only come to make me strong. Oh, through it all.
