Tonight, Father, we will lift your name on high. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; use me, Father, for your glory. &gt;&gt; Lord, I bind every power of demons tonight and we will put them under our feet &gt;&gt; and we will rejoice tonight &gt;&gt; because we will read your word and your word is eternal and your word is you, Father. So we glorify you tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Before I preach, I saw this from the news uh I think two months ago. Thank you musicians. I almost forget again. On June 12, Air India, how many of you heard about the crash? On June 12, Air India flight 171 from Amedabad or Ameabad to England. There were 242 people on board and just 30 seconds after the takeoff, the plane crashed into the neighborhood. Everyone on board lost their lives. But there's one her name Boommy Chuan a 20 year uh 28 years old student from UK. She was supposed to that flight her seat was 36G but she missed boarding by just 10 minutes because because why? Because of the traffic in India. So because of the traffic in the city, she was frustrated and disappointed. She said, "We got very angry with the driver. I cried and begged to the airline staff just only 10 minutes late and to let me her uh to to let me in but they refused. She was heartbroken sitting the near nearby comp cafe ordered tea and called her travel agent and complained. Then she got the news the very plane she missed had crashed. Bowie survived because of the traffic jam. So when she was interviewed by the BBC news, she said this is a totally miracle because of the traffic. How many of us sometimes frustrated if somebody will overtake you? Somebody you're in the middle of the traffic. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need to take a deep breath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you ask to yourself, a son of God, &gt;&gt; everything that happened to you &gt;&gt; and to me is not by chance. But God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; How about if there was no traffic that day? &gt;&gt; Boommy Choan was one of the casualty. But because of the traffic, it's a blessings in disguise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to us brothers and sisters, everything that happens happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the footstep of the righteous &gt;&gt; are ordered by the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was like thinking about this. I I I I I cannot wait to share this to the people because don't be frustrated. Don't be upset. Don't be angry. &gt;&gt; You bless the people that overtakes you. How many died because of the road rage? &gt;&gt; Right. But I believe we're not the one that get upset if somebody will overtakes us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I have a very strange title tonight. I don't know if the title of the message tonight is Daniel's diet. So we will stand up and read the scripture. We will eat good food tonight, but it's healthy. Brother Peter, I will not let you eat the tortilla tonight. Daniel 1 to 20. Oh, just just 20. Well, I thank the Lord for the opportunity to stand behind this pullpit again. And I thank God for brother Ru at allowing me to stand here. In the third year of the reign of Jehoakim, king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, into Jerusalem and besieged it. And the Lord gave Joakim, king of Judah, into his hand with part of the vessel of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar, to the house of his God. And he brought the vessel into the treasure house of his God. And the king spake into Ashpinh the master of his unuks that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed and of the uh princes children in whom was no blemish but will favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldans. And the king appointed them in daily probition of the king's meat and of the wine which he drunk. So nourishing them three years that eat the and at the end thereof they might stand before the king. Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Haniah, Mishael, and Assaria, and to whom the prince of the Unuk gave name for the uh for he gave Daniel the name Beltacar, and Hana, Sadrach, and to Mael, Mishak, and to Assyria of Abednego. But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drunk thereof. He requested of the prince of the unuk that he might not defile himself. Now God had brought Daniel into a favor uh into favor and tender love with prince of unuk. And the prince of the unuk said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for my my uh for why should he then shall ye make me uh in danger of my head uh to the king. Then Daniel to Milsar, whom the prince of the unic had set unto Daniel, Hanama, Mael, and Hesaria. Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, just 10 days, and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. And let our countenance countenance be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat. And as thou seeest, deal with thy servants, so he cons uh consented to them in this matter, and proved them 10 days. And at the end of 10 days, their countenance appeared fairer, fatter in flesh than all children which did eat the portion of the king's meat, powerful food. As for the four children, God gave them knowledge and skills in all learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. Now at the end of days of the days the king had said he should bring them in. Then the prince of the unuk brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king consumed with them. And among them all was found none like Daniel, Haniah, Michel and Azariah before stood before the king and all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them. He found them 10 times better than all of the magicians and astron astrologers that were in all his realm. May God bless the reading of the word. You may be seated. Amen. I will read in 1 Corinthian chapter 2:15. It said here, "But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judge of no man." Praise the Lord. For who hath know the mind known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him, but he have the mind of Christ. Can you see the pattern of Daniel and Paul speaking to the believers &gt;&gt; that we have the wisdom that that the world cannot have. &gt;&gt; We have more wisdom than any others. We cannot that's why we cannot judge other people &gt;&gt; because we're not a judge here right now. But the word that we speak is the word that will judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I was I was in uh Safeway and there was a uh uh you know the sometimes the uh there was uh like uh sound or music and then advertisement. He said if you want a superfood just go to the aisle uh something 25 and superfood. I said maybe I will take uh I will study about the superfood. So when I was searching superfood, it shows that Daniel's diet. I said that's a good topic. Daniel's diet. Amen. Now why the children of Israel are in Babylon? That's a good question, right? Because we cannot start in Babylon. Why the children of Israel, they are the children of God. They were chosen by God. Why they were in Babylon? So if you go back to 32 years ago, it started in the age of Solomon in first king chapter 11. Solomon said uh the the Bible said, "But King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of Moabites, Ammonites, Sidonians, and Hetites." So because he loved those women, women brought their gods &gt;&gt; and goddesses, don't go into them, neither the Bible said, don't go into them, neither shall come to you, for they will uh turn away your heart &gt;&gt; after their gods. Don't go to them &gt;&gt; or don't let them come to you because they will turn your heart. &gt;&gt; You serve only to the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; Isaac, Jacob, but don't you serve the God of all or or the Hittites. So now because of King Solomon when he died, Rhoboam his son became a king and he followed the footstep of his daddy. He served. He he he kicked out all the councils of Solomon and he invited young men that he grew up with and the the young man became the counselor and they advised s uh uh Rhuboam a bad a bad advice. So now you will question why there were two kingdoms supposed to be there's only one kingdom in Israel but because of Rhoboam the 12 tribes split in two. So Rehoboam the tribes that uh decided to stick with him was Judah and Benjamin. And the 10 tribes was looking for another king and they found Rehob not Rioam Jeroboam. Rhoboam and Jeroboam. So Jeroboam he came from the lineage of Ephraim. So now when he got the 10 tribes he keep thinking that he will rule forever. So he said maybe the people will go back to worship God in Israel or Jerusalem because there's only one temple worship and that is in Jerusalem the temple of Solomon. So he was thinking maybe I can let them worship here. So now if you go back to Kings 12 or first Kings 12 28 he said here the Bible said here whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is not too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold thy gods. You can worship here. &gt;&gt; Why you travel 40 minutes drive? Or brother Ruben, why you come here? There's so many churches in Dwey &gt;&gt; or in Prescuit Valley. &gt;&gt; So now he said, "Behold thy gods, oh Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. blasphemy. So now 29 and he set the one in battle and the other put he in them and this thing became a sin. For the people went to worship before the one even unto then. So now let's go. This is like a complicated topic, but let's go to Revelation 7. I'm not a teacher. Brother Freddy, Brother Freddy was preaching really good last time. Revelation 73 saying, "Hart not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. For I heard the number of them which were sealed, and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of Israel, children of Israel, and of the tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed 12,000. Of the tribe of God were sealed 12,000. and of the tribe of Acer were sealed 12,000. And of the tribe of Nef uh Neptaleim were sealed 12,000. And the tribe of Manasse were sealed 12,000. And the tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000. And the tribe of Levi were sealed 12,000. And of the tribe of Isachar were sealed 12,000. And of the tribe of Sabulon were sealed 12,000. and of the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 and the tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000. Where's Dan and Ephraim? The Bible said God blotted their names under heaven because they worship gods. My brother, &gt;&gt; they were not there in the 144,000. &gt;&gt; But remember under heaven. &gt;&gt; So if you go to Ezekiel chapter 48 that is millennium and you will see their names over there. But that's another topic. I will just pass by to this. So that's the danger of worshiping other gods. &gt;&gt; Now in our days the prophet said if you spend more time to this that will be your god. &gt;&gt; If you spend time to your football that will be your god. &gt;&gt; If you spend time to your baseball that will be your god. Don't forget maybe you're not your name is not blotted out but there's a lamb book lamb's book of life and the book of life. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; So that's another topic. Let's go straight. So now Deuteronomy 28 uh 29:16. This is the warning of God to the 12 tribes of Israel. He said,"For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the nation which ye passed by, and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them. list there should be among you men or woman or family or tribe who whose heart turned away this day from the Lord our God to go and serve the gods of the nations least there should be among you a root that beareth gormwood and it came to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he blessed himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace. Do I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst, the Lord will not spare him. But then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in the book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven. That's why Dan and Ibraim, you cannot see them over there because they worship the gods of Jeroboam. Now, in Jeremiah 29, you know, the the children of Israel followed their parents. You see, Jehoa came, he killed Uriah the prophet. They persecuted the prophets. They won't listen to the message of the prophets. Instead, they put them in prison and killed them. So that's why Jeremiah started he was prophesying that he said um he said in uh Jeremiah 25 and this whole land shall be desolation and astonishment and this nation shall shall serve the king of Babylon 70 years. That was the prophecy of Jeremiah. But after he prophesied, look at the grace of God. Brothers, yes, he will kick. Sometimes he will rebuke you. Sometimes he will spunk you. That's our God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to serve a God that will put you to loved every day. &gt;&gt; He will tell you that he you are my son. I will correct you if you're wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then after the correction, like I I after I spunk Mary, I tell her that I love her. Why I spunk you? Because I love you. Mary will going to tell me later about that. So, but here was the message after he prophesied that they will go to to Israel or to Jerus or to uh Babylon. He said, "For thus said the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good words towards you and causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, said the Lord. Thoughts that of peace and not of evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I love my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not of evil. Thoughts that of peace, not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, &gt;&gt; and ye shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Search me, &gt;&gt; you will find me. &gt;&gt; Call upon me if you're sick. Call upon him if you're if you need him. &gt;&gt; If you're struggling, call upon him, Papa God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then Genesis 11, Babylon means confusion. Brother Steven was preaching about that identity crisis. Brother Steven, Babylon, I went to the dictionary, it said a city devoted to a materialism and sensual pleasure. Now if you search the most before the most visited site before was the Bible. The Bible is not the most visited site anymore. The most visited site right now is pornography. And that because we're living in Babylon. Revelation 17 and upon the forehead was name written a mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots. So if if if the church the Catholic church is the mother of all of all harlots, she has daughters. &gt;&gt; And the daughters right now are the one that you will see. Every corner you will see cross, every corner you will see Jesus saves. But they worship God but they don't have the quality so that God don't answer their prayers. You know people I was I was searching that I love the song of the brother who was uh brother Steven. He was singing here last week. I was searching that song, brother, and I was I don't want to see the the the name the the guy that composed that song. Long hair, tattoos, and he was praying. He was singing. I don't have something in me, but all that I have is sing hallelujah to you. Don't look at that singer, brother. See they thought they can worship God &gt;&gt; but is it God listen to them? &gt;&gt; Peter the Bible said in first Peter I don't even hear your prayers. Now Daniel means God is my judge. That's the name of Daniel. Babylonian name is to protect the king. Belt Caesar is the the guardsman. Protector of the king. Hanana means Yahweh is gracious. But then they gave him a name, the God of the moon. And Asia Yahweh has helped. Mishak, God of the moon, also Mishael, who is like God. But then the Babylonian name Abednego, God of wisdom. So God the the the the Babylonian changed their name. I remember if I if you search the history of the Philippines when the Spaniard came to the Philippines, it was three that they were under by the Spaniard for 333 years. That's why my wife's name is Maria Chavez Corason Chavez because the Spaniard put the name tag to the Filipinos that we owned you. We will change your name, right? You can see that to the Congalles, you know, before the name of brother Jonathan is uh Mundu Matumbu. But then that was the original name of the Africans. But then when the French came they changed the name so that they will show to the to the to the other countries that I owned you. Now after in 1895 the American invaded or or the American won the SpanishAmerican war. So now the Americans took care of the the the Philippines and now they started changing their names. Warren, brother Jonathan. So that will show who owns you, right? Patrick, Oliver, there's so many names that you can identify. Like if if I own the cattle, brother Jonathan, if you own the cattle, you put name behind the cattle, the the the the cow, right? On the side. So meaning to say if that cow will stray away and they will find the the the marks on the side, they say, "Oh, Peter owns that cow." And that's what the the the Babylonians did to the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; I will change your name so that we can own you. &gt;&gt; I told you before that when I became a citizen, I want to change my name to Peter Parker. So I went to I went to Tennessee last May and here was Josiah Brown. He said, "Brother Warren, Brother Warren." And it seems like he knows me, brother. And I I I said, "I don't know this guy." And uh you know, to show that you know him, too, you say, "Oh, yeah. Good to see you. Are are you are are you visiting here?" No, he said we're we're here. We we're from here. My dad is Joel Brown. Oh, yeah. I know the preacher. He said, "Yeah." "Oh, brother, I know you." Why? Why you know me? Because you were preaching about Peter Parker. And I said, "So, do you follow me?" He said, "Yeah, I I watch I watch your preaching." But the favorite thing that he can connect to me was the Peter Parker name. So I want to change my name because my kids keep telling me you your name is Warren Banana Arcola. And so I was like, I need to change this. I need to change this. I need to change it. And when I found out that Peter Parker was a Spider-Man, I said, I I'm I'm okay with Warren. So, you know, your Babylonian name is your name right now, &gt;&gt; you know, in in like uh Jonathan. Well, my parents are believers. And you say you uh that's a Babylonian name. All the names that give it to you here are not your original name. &gt;&gt; But then when you become born again, you recognize your position in Christ. Then God changed you to a Christian, &gt;&gt; to an eagle, &gt;&gt; to to to uh now your name before, brother Brandham said, your name before was Elvis. &gt;&gt; Your name before was Ricky. And say, but how about the Christian names? Oh, yeah. Brother Paul, go to Mexico. Their names are Pedro, Huan, and Jesus. and they're drunkards. Jesus means Jesus and some of them are cartel members. So you don't the name here that we have is the Babylonian name. &gt;&gt; But then once you Oh, it's get deeper and deeper, brother. Once you overcome, the Bible said in Revelation chapter 2:17, "He that had an ear, let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of hidden mana, &gt;&gt; and I will give him a white stone." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in that stone a new name written, &gt;&gt; which no man know it, saving he that receive it. &gt;&gt; Now don't ask me about my new name, because only me knows that. &gt;&gt; But I will get that new name over there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I will sit in my father's throne. The prophet said in the message exposition of the seven church sages, it also says here that he's going to give the overcomer a white stone and in uh the stone a new name which the o the owner only knows. &gt;&gt; Don't don't go to the preachers in the Philippines. They know that already. So now he said the owner only knows. Now the idea of a few names is familiar one. Abram was changed to Abraham, &gt;&gt; Sarai to Sarah, Jacob to Israel, Simon to Peter, and Saul to Paul. These names either brought out a change or were given because of a change. It was only after Abraham and Sarai or Abraham and Sarai had their names changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive &gt;&gt; the the coming son. &gt;&gt; In Jacob's case, he had to overcome and then he was called a prince. &gt;&gt; From the deceiver to prince, from mama's boy to prince. My in the case of Simon and Saul when they had received the Lord their chain their their name their chains came and today each one of us true believers has had chains in name. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; now we are Christians. It is a name common to all of us. But one day we will have another change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will of a certain receive a new name. It could will be that name was our true and original name written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world. He knows the same that name but we do not. &gt;&gt; Amen. One day at his good picture &gt;&gt; we will know also &gt;&gt; I will have a new name. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because you tell me brother I am an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Yes. You you you don't see me in my work. You don't see me in my house. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you I am an overcomer. We are an overcomer &gt;&gt; because he overcame first. &gt;&gt; Now the husband said you don't do anything. All you do is just believe. &gt;&gt; Go to church and worship me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; And fight a good fight of faith. &gt;&gt; Food are very important in our body. Appetite means a natural desire to satisfy a bodily bodily need especially for food. Now many of you heard this. You are what you eat. &gt;&gt; Don't you know gluttony before is a sin. Wow. We don't hear that preaching anymore, brother. But gluttony is a sin. You know the prophet said the the Paul said you know they're after is their own belly. Now what you see is feeding you right? If you see a good thing, you're feeding your soul. If you hear something, what do you hear? Young people, please check your apps. &gt;&gt; What you listened, &gt;&gt; right? You're feeding your soul what you hear, what you see. And it will affect your body. Why? You see sometimes girls with earrings, with purple hair, with all black clothes, because they seize that. They saw that somewhere. I have a picture before and after. Do you have that? Uh, brother Ethan, my you see this all over the if you go to your mailbox, you open your mailbox, there are like newspaper advertisement that this kind of diet you will eat and you will become like this before and after there are those people are not AI they're true and you know what kind of food they eat they will let you buy a a small pack every day so you will eat it three times a day but when I tried that one it tastes like brother no appetite will you don't have you will not going to like it, brother. It's better the the the good one, right? The um the chicken and the and the tortilla and the burrito, but it will affect your body. If you're eating right, it will affect your body. You know, in in Mexico, I am a missionary to Mexico. Most of the people that comes to the altar for prayer, they want me to pray for their diabetes, their diabetic. And I I asked them after we prayed, I asked the brothers, can we talk about, you know, we need to Yes, God will heal you, but please cocoa is so be it's sweeter. They said it's sweeter than the United States cocoa. Coca means Coca-Cola. So they keep drinking CocaCola. So I told them please don't drink soft drinks. Then it will reduce your blood sugar. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So not only we're feeding them spiritually but they're we're helping them naturally now. They will call me the the um what do you call that? uh uh the dietician. So you listen, the prophet said here, this is a good one. I was um reading this and I was like ready to share this to you. It said here, every beautiful type of a born-again Christian cannot digest the things of the world cuz if they do, it will spiritually kill them right away. But did you ever notice the old crow? Now he can sit on the dead carcass. That's the decaying in plain Kentucky language, patting. And it can sit on there and just eat all day long, but the dove cannot go around it. It strikes and she will fly away. But the crow uh the crow can sit on there and eat all day long and then it can go right out in the wheat field and eat with the dove too. So a hypocrite, an impostor, he can go to the world and &gt;&gt; affiliated with the world and act like the world and live in the world and enjoy the pleasure tend to be a Christian. But the real Christian can't where is it? The real Christian can go out to the world and come back. There's something wrong. So that shows you your company. &gt;&gt; I will tell you who you are. &gt;&gt; Show me your friend &gt;&gt; and I will tell you who you are. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron one time told me he said, "Brother Warren, I I was telling him that the the a pickle ball group here in the church, the young people." So he said, "That's good because if you don't let them join with the young people, they will look somewhere a friend. So show me your company and I will tell you who you are. Show me your friend, I will tell you who you are." There's so many There's so many believers here. Make friends with the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me go to your house and see what you read. Let me listen, what you feed, what kind of music you are playing. Let me see what kind of magazines, what kind of literature you read. Let me look into your office and see it's a big bunch of these vulgar pictures or this app uh apps and things and you and I and you will tell me you're a Christian. I won't say nothing to you, but in my heart I will watch what kind of fruit you're feeding, what kind of food you eat. Amen. Now, here's the the two children, the the the sons of uh Isaac, Jacob and Esau, you know, would say, well, food is nothing. It's only a food. I will not deceive by food. But here's in Genesis chapter 25:29. And Jacob saw pottage or pottage. And Esau came from the field and he was faint. And Esau said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint." Therefore was this name called Edom. And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy birthright." &gt;&gt; Mama's boy, but wise. &gt;&gt; Sell me your birthright. I'll feed you. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Well, um um Esau said, "Behold, I am at that point to die, and what profit shall this birthright to do me?" See the difference of the believers and the non-believers, they doesn't care. They're God-given right. &gt;&gt; They can sell that to the world. The prophet said, "Elvis, look at Elvis. He was a very God was using him to sing in the church. &gt;&gt; How great thou art. How great thou art." And everybody was clapping. Everybody was happy. The anointing in the room, you can feel it. &gt;&gt; But then the prophet said he sold his birthright because of money. &gt;&gt; Where's brother John? He was singing pause me not, oh gentle save you. He was singing that last Sunday. And you know who was singing that? the blind woman Crosby, they offered her millions of dollars to to sing to the world. But you know what she did? What she say what she told to the to the um record something. She said, "I'd rather sing to my savior &gt;&gt; than to sing to the world." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; my brother. But Esau did not recognize the power of birthright. So he said, "And Jacob said, swear to me this day, and swear unto him." And he sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage in lentil or lentil lentiles. And he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way. And Esau despised his birthright. Supposed to be Esau was the prince. But because he sold it to Jacob, the mama's boy became prince. became Israel and his name is up to now known all over the world because he got the birthright. Now in Amos chapter, you know, uh 8, it said, "Behold, the days come that there will be a famine in the land, but not for food or for drinks, but of the word of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; there will be a famine in the land. When is that coming, brother? &gt;&gt; I I found this today. How much food is wasted in America? Well, this is 2025. It said here just how much food do American waste? Here's some food for to forought. While the world waste about 2.5 billion tons of food every year, 2.5 billions. &gt;&gt; The United States discard more food than any other country in the world. Nearly 60 million tons, 120 billion pounds every year. There's no famine in America, brother. &gt;&gt; Now, the estimated to be almost 40% of the entire US food supply and equates to 325 pounds of waste per person. That's a lot of food, brother. You're counted here. per person. 225 pounds of waste per person into the garbage or rather right into landfill as mo most discarded food ends up there. In fact, food is the single largest component taking up space inside US landfills making up to 22% of municipal solid waste. All told, the amount of food wasted in America has approximately value nearly 28 billion. The quant uh equivalent of 130 billion meals. There's no famine in the United States. &gt;&gt; But what is the famine? The word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You go to work, don't you ever talk about religion. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever talk to them about Christ? &gt;&gt; Because they said there will be no end if you talk about Christ. There's a famine in the land, &gt;&gt; but not of food or water. But in Matthew chapter 4, he said, you know, the the the Bible said, um, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. So every Christians cannot live without the word of God &gt;&gt; because the word of God is their lives. &gt;&gt; It's my life. It's your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. There was a story in the Bible when when Elijah in uh brother Freddy was mentioning this one time uh in his preaching, you know, when when Jezebel was uh when he was speaking to Jezebel, he was so powerful and he wasn't uh scared of Jezebel. But when the spirit of the Lord came out from him, he was running. &gt;&gt; He was scared. So now Elijah was was sitting in juniper tree. But then God always there for him. So now God send a an angel to feed him. I love this message, brother. The message is a sustaining strength to us &gt;&gt; when we are down. The angel will come and feed us. &gt;&gt; The angel that follows you and the angel from the pulpit &gt;&gt; we get fed every day the strong meat. Now Elijah when he was and when they uh and and behold there was a cake bake on the coals and a cru of water at his head. And he did eat and drink and laid him down again. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said, "Arise and eat because the journey is too too great for thee." And he arose and did eat and drink and went in the straight of that meat 40 days. &gt;&gt; What kind of food? What kind of food did he eat? &gt;&gt; Angel's food. &gt;&gt; The sustaining strength. &gt;&gt; And the sustaining strength is in in our time right now is the message of the hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; 40 days and 40 nights &gt;&gt; without hunger, brother. &gt;&gt; And he went in the straight of those cakes for 40 days. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If he can do that to Elijah, &gt;&gt; Elijah is a man like us. And when Elijah prayed, God heared his prayers. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, don't you underestimate this is the word, but if you believe it, it's power. &gt;&gt; It's donamous. Now, the prophet said in the message, spiritual food in due season, it's not their food. It's not the church so-called food in its bride bride. It it's it's the bride's food. It's spiritual food in season. &gt;&gt; It would make them sick if they're in at their stomach. It's too rich for them. See, you can do it. But for the children, it's a bread. It's a life. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. to the nominal churches brother that's too much for them &gt;&gt; they cannot swallow that food &gt;&gt; because the food only for the children &gt;&gt; he is a sustaining power almost time my now the prophet said what he would however ever over and us and nourish us and would give us today our daily bread both physical and spiritual that we might have the sustaining strength of body to walk about upon the earth and the sustaining power of the Holy Spirit to bring the word of God to a hungry people. &gt;&gt; How many of you are hungry tonight? Then God will sustain us. &gt;&gt; You know the song said, "Fill me." Well, it's I'm full, but let me let me ask one more. Fill me. &gt;&gt; Let my oil overflow. &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied that I have a full oil, brother. I want my oil overflowing &gt;&gt; from head to toe. That's what we want. &gt;&gt; My now God called Elijah to sustain the widow. The widow is type of the bride. The widow he her first husband was dead. And our first husband is dead. Satan is dead to us. Now here comes the prophet Elijah to come and sustain you. with this with this sustaining power. Brothers and sisters, you know what is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is the word in your hour. &gt;&gt; God called Elijah to sustain this widow. They just had one little cake, one little thing she was holding on to. And Elijah said, "Give that to me." That was a command, brother Freddy. Give that to me. Give that to me first. For thus said the Lord, that barrel will not go empty. Neither will the cruise dry run dry until the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the earth. Putting God first, his word first, &gt;&gt; then God will sustain you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will skip because it's almost time. I have more to share. Okay. It said the Bible or the the prophet said here. He said, "Father, this is his prayer. Father, so it is today the church, the true believer, the body of believers has access to food, spiritual food that the nominal knows nothing about. The world knows nothing of this food, Father, but your church, your people, the bride of your uh your son loves it. We have access to healing to our bodies. When the doctor has failed, we have access to this. It's one of food of God that he gave to his church and promise it in the last days to this believing children. Father, help us to be believing children. For all things are possible to them that believes to the believers. Grant it dear father, dear God. We ask it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the message said, "Oh God, give us like Daniel, give us Christian like Shadrach, like Mishak, like Abednego that in the middle of of we call that I maybe if if I can type that Babylon, you're in middle of New York." in in the middle of New York, there are like different kinds of characters, Rambo, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck. And they will come to take picture of you, but then you will pay them. They will go after you. He said, "I didn't take a picture with you, but you did. Here's your picture. It's filthy. you go to the train station. But for 70 years, they were faithful because you know why? Because they have a sustaining strength. They have the word. What's was the word? The word of Jeremiah that after 70 years, I will bring you back to your homeland. Brothers and sisters, this message, well, it's it's more than 60 years now. But are you still okay? To me, brothers, I am okay because I have a s sustaining food. I have a sustaining power in me. I have the word &gt;&gt; that the prophet said, "You walk, you run because one day the rapture will come." &gt;&gt; Don't you, the prophet said, "Please don't you ever uh to be there in that uh great tribulation because you know why? You cannot buy, you cannot sell without the mark. You cannot buy to satisfy your needs. That's why the prophet said, "Don't you ever go there. Whatever you do, my goal is the rapture." &gt;&gt; Whatever we do, I need to eat food. &gt;&gt; But the pulse, what is the pulse? the vegetables that Daniels eat, you know, it's something that that too too little to the people because the food of the kings are fried chicken and sirloins and pammenion but to Daniel just corn beans water but there's power there's power In that message, the power of the word &gt;&gt; this something to them they they said if you look at the message the Google they said the prophet is an illiterate but that illiterate man satisfy my need. &gt;&gt; That illiterate man called us from from uh where you from brother Stephen uh Ireland from the Philippines from Congo from different countries. gathered us together &gt;&gt; to come here to eat the food. &gt;&gt; Oh, taste and see if the musician can come. I am ready to sing. Oh, come and see. Or what is that, brother Jonathan? You know that song, right? That's the food. The food of this hour is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the sustaining power. Father, thank you for the sustaining strength. It's almost there. Maybe a a short mile to [Music] Father, we are still enjoying your food. I don't care when are you coming or I don't care father because I'm enjoying the food of the hour right now. God is sustaining me. &gt;&gt; Father we thank you Lord. Thank you for the message. &gt;&gt; Thank you for this message of the hour that the people the nominal doesn't want to partake but to us it's a strength. It's a joy. It's a power. It's life to us.
