Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. Because he lives, all fear is gone because I know, yes, I know he holds the future. This life is worth the living just because he sing it one more time.

And we have a praise report tonight from our brother Jim. He says, "Sister Nancy has been shattering all expectations since her TE-C cell infusion on Monday. The next 3 to 5 days will be indicative of the type of side effects she may be dealing with. She sends her love to all and thanks each one for their prayer on her behalf." So, let's continue to remember Sister Nancy. The Lord be with her through this procedure and just grant her a full recovery. Know that he's more than able tonight. Amen. I want to remember sister Karen M. She's at home sick tonight. There's some others that are home sick. Our brother Eric Andress is quite sick. He's at home asking for prayer. The chewers are at home sick. Brother Steven said Ashlin is sick tonight as well. And brother Chris Roine, I'm sure there's others. How many would have a need tonight? You just want to lift it before the Lord. Brother Paul Maple, would you come tonight, brother Paul? And just take us before the Lord in prayer. Also ask you remember our little dog Popsy. May not seem like much, but he's been hobbling on three legs for the last few days. So believe nothing is too small. &gt;&gt; God honors our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you need tonight? Just want to lift your hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Paul, if you'd come. &gt;&gt; How many are thankful to be here tonight? Thank you. &gt;&gt; You know, I was uh rushing from work, rushing home, &gt;&gt; trying to get here. You know, I wanted to get in here and try to get in the spirit and maybe drive a little faster than I should. And all of a sudden, I said a thought. I thought, God, why me? Why is it so important for me to be there tonight? I'm just so thankful that he called me. I said, "God, why do you call me that?" &gt;&gt; I don't put the hunger in my heart to be here. He does. &gt;&gt; I'm just so thankful for his mercy and grace. &gt;&gt; You know, I remember that service brother Steven had a attitude of gratitude. &gt;&gt; I appreciate all you guys that are here today, all my brothers and sisters in Christ. And you guys don't know how much it means to me to be able to come here and see you and the spirit that you bring and to fellowship with you and worship with you. It's a blessing &gt;&gt; and it's an honor and I appreciate every one of you and I want to make sure I let you guys know that. So, thank you so much for being here. Dear heavenly father, we're just come to you this evening, dear Lord. So thankful of your mercy and grace. We're thankful that you call us, dear Lord. For without you, where would we be, dear Lord, that song because you live, I can face tomorrow. That's true, dear Lord. The pressures and pulls of this world, dear Lord, they just consistently push down upon us. But dear Lord, you bring peace. You bring joy. You bring happiness. You bring a purpose in my life, dear Lord. That purpose is to serve you the best that I can, dear Lord, each and every day with all of my heart, dear Lord. That I know that's the desire of all of our hearts here, dear Lord, is to just to little live a little bit more like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To walk a little bit more like you, to be a light, dear Lord, in this dark and perverse generation that we live in. Dear Lord, we know that you are almighty God and you know, dear Lord, the prayers, the desires of our hearts. I'm sure there's many unspoken requests, dear Lord, that are here this evening. I know I have some on my heart, dear Lord, and you know what they are. Dear Lord, before there is ever a desire in our heart, dear Lord, you already had the answers. So, we lift them up to you this evening, dear Lord, for all the sickness, dear Lord. We already know you've healed them, dear Lord, those that we love, dear Lord, you love as well. And we ask for dear Lord whether it be a family member, whether it be an animal, dear Lord. Whatever it might be, we bring them up to you and lift them up and say, "Dear Lord, would you heal them according to your word? Would you give us the faith, dear Lord, to rise up inside of us and claim those things which you've already promised, dear Lord? We're just so thankful to be here. We pray that you would just bring every spirit, dear Lord, every everybody under your subjection, dear Lord, this evening. Lord, cast out every worry, every fear, dear Lord, every thought of life, dear Lord, or work or just pressures that we have going on. May we just worship you this evening, dear Lord. We're just thankful to be here, dear Lord. We know it's by your grace and your grace alone. And dear Lord, I can just say with all my heart, I'm so thankful for your mercy, for your grace, and I love you. &gt;&gt; Pray that you would just, dear Lord, just speak to the speak to the man this morning. Dear Lord, may we hear Christ, dear Lord, speak to us, dear Lord. And maybe we not just walk out saying, "Well, that was a good a good a good good service by this minister of that." that we may say that was Christ that came down and spoke to us this evening to tell us how to to walk. Tell us how to live. Dear Lord, prick our hearts, dear Lord. Give us the urgency and help us to realize how late it is. Dear Lord, may we live for you with all that we are. Just so thankful for your mercy. We pray that you'd bless the service. Bless the songs that are spoken. We ask all these things in your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Paul. You may be seated tonight. It's good to be in his presence. Just want to welcome each one those that might be streaming tonight. Uh just a couple of announcements.

[Music] Your love is so much stronger. [Music] Then whatever [Music] troubles me. [Music] Sometimes it takes a mountain [Applause] to trust you and believe. [Music] Forgive me, Jesus.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Billy. Sometimes it takes a mountain to get our attention. put our trust totally on him. Let's stand tonight and wanted to sing the potter's hands. How many times do we find ourselves on that potter's wheel molding and shaping us? &gt;&gt; But I want to be molded into the image that he wants for me tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior.

Amen. God bless you. You can be seated for just a moment. Amen. I appreciate the song special tonight, Brother Billy. That was enjoyed that. Sometimes it takes a mountain. God lets different things come into your life and and uh so &gt;&gt; he uses all things to work together for the good. &gt;&gt; Didn't say they would all be good, but said it'll &gt;&gt; work together for the good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, I'm just uh happy to be home and Sandy made me some real strong coffee to drink before I came to service. So, I told her, I said, "I hope I don't fall asleep uh while I'm in the pulpit." And she says, "I hope I don't fall asleep while So, I'm watching you, honey. You keep keep your eyes open." Yeah. But God is good. Amen. We um uh Brother Mario is going to go ahead and give us a little bit of an update on uh on Sunday of a little bit of our trip, some photos and things and and everything. that I I thought I would give you something that that was we found quite humorous. Um is we got done with our meetings in the Philippines and we flew to Thailand and we got to Thailand after midnight. So, and and you're in a foreign country, you don't know is there going to be taxis there or there, you know, to get around to take us from the airport unto So, anyway, brother Mario has got a friend uh of his uh sister Josephine's old friend that lived next door to them, I think, in the Philippines, and he's been living in Thailand for many years now and married a a girl from Thailand. Anyway, long story short, they called him and said, "Hey, will you get a hold of somebody?" And so, uh, you know how you have people holding up a sign that has a name on it, you know? So, Mario Chua, real big like this. So, we got off. Oh, this is good. This is good. So, we got a guy waiting for us and he take our luggage and we put it in the car. And so, Mario, I have him sit in the front because he's bigger and he needs more room, you know, for his legs. And so, Mario, you know, always asks, "So, uh, what is your name?" He said, "What is my name?" And uh he said, "Yes, I'm I'm" because poor English, you know. Yes. Uh what is your name? What what is my name? And uh so yes. Yes. I'm asking uh what is your name? And he said what is my name? Ah yeah. Who's on first? Right. It's one of those things you got you're do you understand my English? What? His name actually is what and uh it it means temple. Temple. So anyway, that was funny. We we were going back and forth. So what? Yeah. What is my name? Okay, brother Brighton, you have your brother here tonight, Joseph Lubanza. Where is that? You, brother Joseph, come on up here. Is he older than you, Brighton, or younger? He's older. Okay, come on up here, brother Joseph. I'd like you to um to greet the people here. He is a minister and he's living in Ireland, Stephen. So, you need to talk to him. He's living in Ireland. Find out where he's at. Come on up here, brother Joseph. And uh this is brother Brighton's uh flesh brother. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're older than Brighton, huh? How how much older? &gt;&gt; I'm 59. &gt;&gt; 59. How old is he? &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not going to embarrass you. Come on up here. Greet the people. Please say hello. God bless you. God bless you. I'd like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm very happy to be among you tonight and fellowship with you around the word of God. &gt;&gt; As pastor said, my name is Joseph Lubanza. I live in Ireland but formerly I'm from Congo. That's why I got a lot of churches around. We establish churches and we put some pastors there. So we are now in Ireland because we have to move there for some troubles we have in Congo civil wars. That's why I moved the family there. I love you. I appreciate you. God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank our brother Stephen and brother James for preaching in ourstead while we're gone. I never have to worry about it. I know you're well fed and everything. I did hear Stephen's remark. He said, "Well, our pastor left sick and we he'll probably come home well instead of going away well and then coming home sick." So that's what happened actually. The Lord really really gave us grace because I was not feeling well, lost my voice and and everything. But two days before um I just prayed about it and the Lord put it on my heart to to go ahead and go. It is never recommended to leave when you're not feeling well and everything. But we went and when we landed over there in Philippines, uh uh it wound up I still don't have a voice and I've got three services to to take and everything. And so I'm asking them, you know, pray for me. So they were all praying for me anyway. Uh so the day of the services, I got a voice, &gt;&gt; you know, so praise God. And and I feel and I I tell you what, I felt so good throughout all of my whole trip. I I just felt pumped. So I'm pumped tonight. [Laughter] I got some caffeine in me. I'm feeling good. We'll have a short quick work here tonight. We love all of you. Thank you so much for coming to the house of God tonight and uh being so faithful to Christ. Thank you musicians. God bless you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's stand together. Allelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So many people have been gone and cruises and different things like that and different ones. Sister Marty, you've been gone a long time. It's good to have you back. Each and every one of you, I just take a moment to look at your faces and make contact with you. Uh you're a great blessing to me. A great blessing to me. I feel honored honored to have such high quality believers as what we have here in this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. I don't just say it. I I believe it with all my heart. Luke chapter 21. Luke chapter 21. Then we'll go to Revelation chapter 3. Amen. Just a little thought the Lord put on my heart and I just very quickly typed something up before I came. So Luke chap 21 verse 29. Luke 21 29. And he spake to them a parable. Behold the fig tree and all the trees. We know the fig tree is a type of Israel. And when they now shoot forth, you know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when you see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. So what God does is he gives you signs to let you know the season in which you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the closeness of his coming. &gt;&gt; So there'll be no one with any excuse because God, Brother Brand preached the sermon, the flashing red lights of the signs of his coming. We see it. We see it all around us. Verily, verily, I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word words shall not pass away. and take heed to yourselves, lest that at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfing and drunkenness and cares of this life, so that that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man. Amen. Turn with me now if you would to Revelation chapter 3. Very familiar portion of scripture. And I want to just as you're turning to Revelation 3, we'll go to the verse 14. But we're talking about Ladya. And understand in the seven church ages every time there is a messenger unto the angel of Ephesus, unto the angel of Samrna and Thitra and you are all very much aware of that. But as that angel preaches his message, the spirit is speaking something &gt;&gt; that each one of the over each one of those in that age are going to have to overcome specific issues of that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand? Those are the things that we have to be aware of lest it be a snare to us. &gt;&gt; So, Revelations 3:14, "And unto the angel of the church of the Ladyans, write these things saith thee, Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works. Thou art neither cold nor hot. I would, thou were cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be riched in white raignment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. May God bless the reading of his word tonight. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. Amen. To he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church. So we see now I'd like to title this uh this evening the snares of Laiusa. The snares of Ladius. And I take a subject of the deceitfulness of the cares of life. Now this may not seem to be real spiritual or whatever but I just want to put you in remembrance of the things that we are going to have to overcome because um when God gives the analysis of this age because you say I am increased with goods I have need of nothing and on and on and he says but you don't even know that you're poor miserable blind wretched and naked. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you don't know it. Can you imagine the people's minds so corrupted that they they're in this horrible condition and don't know it. &gt;&gt; So that's why he says, "I want to I'm going to ask you to to buy of me gold." And that gold is the the the trials and the temptations that you're going to go through to bring you that Christlike character. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Larry. Sister Linda, too. It's good to see you guys. She snuck in on us while we were gone. It's good to have you here. So, God bless you richly. And so, you see, and then white raignment that you may be clothed and is. What is is a the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that will anoint your eyes that you might see the conditions of the church and be aware of it. It's a terrible thing to to be poor, miserable, blind, wretched, and naked, and you don't know it. &gt;&gt; So, God help us that we understand. So, we've got to take heed of what the spirit is saying about this age. And as we see the fig tree putting forth her bud, we know that this generation shall not pass away. So, we know we're right here. We're right at the end time. We're in the midst. Gross darkness is covering the people. And just about the time you don't think the people can get worse, they get worse. uh the things that are happening, it is so far beyond normal thinking that what you're doing, you are witnessing America coming apart at the seams. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She's not going to get better. She's not going to recover. Um and understand that she starts as a lamb, but the prophecy is that she shall come forth and speak as a dragon. That's the prophecy of America. So it's going to get worse. The conditions will get worse. But we thank God that whenever things uh get worse, God gets better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, we would become uh &gt;&gt; you know, we we become in despair and despondent and depressed and oh what's the use or whatever. But whenever the enemy comes in like a flood, &gt;&gt; God will raise up a standard against it. So thank God. You know what? You are the standard. &gt;&gt; You are the part of what God is raising up in this hour. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "Look, and many of you will never preach a sermon, but you'll live one." &gt;&gt; So, let our lives shine the light of this glorious gospel in the end time. We're not ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Snares are used to catch something. a snare. Like over in Africa, they put a snare, which is usually a wire or some kind of a tripping device that when the animal and and they put them in areas of high capacity. In other words, there's going to be a lot of volume of things going through this area like a game trail and whatever puts their foot in there and they kind of trip it up and then it catches and the the more they pull the more it tightens. And it's a it's a horrible thing to see an animal that has been snared. It's a horrible thing to see a Christian or somebody in this world being snared by the things of Laosa. And we'll look at these things. Well, look at these the the deceitfulness of riches and the things and the cares of life. This is not sinful things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's just the cares of life. And if we're not careful and we're not aware of this, you can become a victim yourself because you're not aware of the snares of ladies. Jesus warns the the people that there will be all of these snares at the end time. So we have to um be aware of that. It said let your heart not be overcharged. That the the Greek word means to weigh down to burden to charge to to have a heavy load to be pressed upon. You talk about a pressure right now. You know uh brother Bram says watch when you see that third pull and it begins to manifest itself. He said watch that pressure. And how many of you realize we're having pressure? There's there's pressure just cares of life uh uh going to the grocery store uh everything is a pressure and we have but you know what I want you to understand you are pressurized &gt;&gt; and if and we have to have the area to let off pressure otherwise you will there's two ways to that pressure can affect you &gt;&gt; you can you can either explode or implode And both ways are not not nice. You ever seen somebody explode? They don't explode nicely. There's pieces everywhere. Their family falls apart. Everything, your job, your career, everything just just or you have so much pressure, you implode. You know, you sit there and become reclusive. Next thing you know, uh the pressure is so great and I'm going, why should I go to church? and next thing you know, you're you're having these things affect you. And Satan wants to keep you away from fellowship. &gt;&gt; It's extremely important for you to come to church &gt;&gt; more important than you possibly realize &gt;&gt; and even that much more so as we see that day approaching. No, &gt;&gt; those material things that can be a snare to God, like I said, there they within themselves are not evil, but they are things that if we're not careful and we don't keep them under control, it can be a snare to you. In Matthew chapter 6 31 and 33, therefore take no thought, saying, "What shall we eat and what shall we drink and wherewith shall we be clothed?" You know the first thing you do when you get up in the morning is what am I going to eat? What am I going to wear? So these are issues that we deal with on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things. How many How many realize he knows? &gt;&gt; Oh God, are you sure uh that you know all? Come on. &gt;&gt; He knows you have need of all these things. &gt;&gt; But seek ye first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. &gt;&gt; That's why my brother, my sister, listen. You're not to be looking for those things that's going to produce a greater life in this kingdom because our world, our kingdom is not of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have another kingdom that is far greater than this one here. That's why you are a pilgrim and a stranger in this world. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to prioritize our lives. &gt;&gt; We've got to be aware of the things that can snare us down, stumble us up, and you might become a victim of the snares of a lot of them. Brother Brennan picks this up in the Sranian church age. And I just uh let's read this together. Here is where you have to believe again in love and goodness and the wisdom of God. This too is needful. Remember he admonished. Take no thought for the tomorrow. What you shall eat and what shall put on. Your father knoweth the things you have need of. He who clothe the lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you. These physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you're reading it. It's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are not the basic necessities of your life. For a man's life consisteth not of the things he possesses. &gt;&gt; But rather, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all material necessities will be added unto you. Seek him first. And guess what? Houses and clothing and food. If he'll feed the sparrow, how much more will God feed and clothe you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The people of God are not material-minded. &gt;&gt; They are Christminded. &gt;&gt; They do not seek the treasures that are below. They seek those above. It is absolutely true. The majority of Christians are not wealthy. Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kind he's talking to us, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Rather, they are on the poor side. It was so in Jesus day. It was true in Paul's day and it should be true today. Oh, it is not too true for today. for the loudian age is one of the vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly goods. My how rich the church is in goods but how poor in spirit. Blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink. It is not material. It is within us. Amen. &gt;&gt; A rich man is rich in God, not in worldly things. &gt;&gt; Prayer and reading your Bibles is absolutely essential. &gt;&gt; You want to keep your life prioritized, you got to do those simple things. &gt;&gt; Read and pray &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to replace going to church with um streaming remote. &gt;&gt; Well, today is remote. Many of you had jobs prior to COVID and you had to go into work 8 to5. You had an office. You had things to do. Now many of you work remotely. And so that that spirit of working remotely is also creeping right into the church. Well, you know, look, uh it's so easy to go ahead and stay home. I don't have to put on nice clothes and go to church and I don't feel well and I'm kind of tired. And you get all these excuses. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, Satan will do everything he can to get you so overburdened because work. And the thing you don't realize I'm on a treadmill. Well, you might have put yourself there. You might have said, "Well, I need that job. I need this. I need a bigger car. Everybody wants a nice car. New Yeah. When I go to the car wash and I want my car wash, I tell them, "What what smell do you want? New car. Give me new car. Like that new car. But listen, that car that you buy and you drive it off of the lot, you take it back the next day, you want to trade it in. Oh man, this thing's a junker. It's it's $15,000. You just lost $15,000 right off the top. Hey, listen. You know, and all of a sudden, this this uh joy of having a new car now for the next five, six years, you got a $500 payment. The joy just very quickly &gt;&gt; leaves. And then you think that old junker wasn't so bad. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Anyway, I believe that what the devil is doing today is he's using social media, the computer, and cell phones. &gt;&gt; My wife read an article yesterday about over in China, they're making it a law that you cannot let your children in China, okay, have a cell phone until they're 18 and older. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is amazing to see and and and we saw this over in the Philippines. We saw it there uh in Thailand that everywhere everywhere we went, children all had their own little cell phone and they're sitting there. They're not talking to mom and dad. or not. Uh, you know, they're this here and they're doing this and I mean, and this little cell phone or the iPad is right there. Imagine what it does to the the eyes &gt;&gt; and the different things. Okay, they're sitting here and they're just uh uh working on this little thing. Well, it's also putting thoughts into their minds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the highest form of brainwashing in the world today. You wouldn't let your child play with a loaded gun, but you'll put something like that. I say to all of the parents here, all of you be extremely aware, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; with your children, &gt;&gt; okay, of what they're doing. either. I'll tell you if you if they have an Instagram or if they have a Facebook or if they have one of these social medias, ask to go on their site and see how many of the their friends are friends from the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, it might shock you. And another thing too, uh, it it's a real cute thing for our children today, especially our girls. I haven't seen the boys do it, but I'm sure there are some that do it. Is they all get together and they do this. Got to be kidding me. Who are you puckering up for? &gt;&gt; That's right. Honestly, now look. Yeah, I'm an old man, 72 and everything like that. But listen, sisters, be aware of that. &gt;&gt; Be careful. I don't want you out there. I want you to look nice, but not too nice, &gt;&gt; okay? You don't have to do what the world does. You don't have to, hey, and give all these signs and stuff like that. Who cares? &gt;&gt; I didn't get one. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just something to be aware of. &gt;&gt; Okay. All kinds of filters that we uh can put on cell phones or computers and everything, but the I'll tell you the only filter that is 100% is the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; who will convict you &gt;&gt; when you get on there and you do something wrong, convict you. And you know what? It'll filter itself. &gt;&gt; That's a real thinking man's filter. Amen. The Bible says that uh don't let your uh heart be overcharged. Don't let the weight of the world and things come upon you or a surfet. Uh I looked up the Greek word surf s u r fi t. It means uh a headache having from too much intoxication or pain caused by overindulgence either by eating or drinking. Any of you ever ate too much? &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. Oh, got to undo the belt here because you know I had a little bit. You see that's what the world if you're not careful. Okay, you overindulge surfing and it means in Webster's dictionary it means excess indulgence as in food or in drink. There is another word uh that is also associated with that is to dissipate or dissolute. Dissipate means to eat or drink to an excess. overindulgence. And so God help us. It's not that eating and drinking is sinful in itself. No. No. The Bible does say beware, you know, the glutton and overeating. One thing I think was very, very interesting. I'll tell you a story that Brother Jim Dalton told me. Brother Jim, the pastor up in Flagstaff, uh, former pastor up there, now Brother Steve Robson is their pastor. But brother Jim, they took Brother Brandham hunting with them up uh in Colorado or perhaps it was in Prescat somewhere, I forget, but they were out hunting and they were around the campfire and they're talking and brother Brennham is sharing and everything. And he said, "Uh uh, brethren, everywhere I go, the Holy Spirit is not far from me, that pillar of fire." And he says, "In fact, turn." He said, "There it is in the top of that tree." They all turned. They were all turned around and saw that amber light in the top of the tree. And so, Brother Jim said he was there until the early morning and until sunrise. But, Brother Jim, as he was passing Brother Brennham's uh tent. Now, Brother Bram said, "Brother, listen. We got to get up early, so I'm going my tent." They had fixed his own private tent. And so as Jim was uh Brother Jim was walking by the tent, he hears Brother Brennan praying out loud. And he says, "Brother Ron, I didn't want to be a hypocrite or anything, but I wanted to hear how he prayed in private." And he said something as best as I can remember. Brother Jim tells the story. He said, "Um, Heavenly Father, we had such a lovely time with the brethren tonight. I pray that I didn't um I you know I didn't tell too many funny stories or anything like that. He said, "We had such a a a lovely time." And he says, "And father, uh would you forgive me? I had a little bit too much for dinner." Now, I don't know about you, but when I heard that, I thought, "When have any of you &gt;&gt; I don't even tell my wife. I've had too much for dinner. &gt;&gt; To be so intimate with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your prayer. Father, I'm sorry. I I overeat for dinner tonight. Imagine having that that uh simplicity and the sensitivity &gt;&gt; to be so close to him that you would excuse yourself and say, "Forgive me. I had too much for dinner. I think that in this age we see there is a lot of eating and drinking disorders and it just goes along with the the this end time. Um if your heart is not right with God, listen to me now. If your heart is not right with God, these things can become a snare to you. The cares of life can snare you and take the very life out of you. We can see this in the parable of the swer of seed. Matthew chapter 13. Let's read this in the scripture. Matthew 13 verse 22. He also that receive seed among the thorns. So remember it's the type ground. And I ask you, what is your ground like tonight? Because the type ground you have will affect the seed that has been sown &gt;&gt; into your heart. Nothing wrong with the seed. It's the ground in which it was received in. And so also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful. Have you ever met anyone that ran for a while, but the next thing you know they got a new job or a new home or and money and they're chasing the almighty dollar and all next thing you know they're not in church. &gt;&gt; Where are they? The cares of life. &gt;&gt; It wasn't sin. It was cares of life and it choked the word. It becomes unfruitful. But he that receiveth seed into the good ground, is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it, which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth such a hundfold, some 60, and some 30. I don't want to be just a 30fold, nor a s. I want to be hundfold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want fruit all over my life. I don't want just some spinly little uh orange on my orange tree if if that's what I am. I want to bear fruit. I want my uh my limbs to be bearing much fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will take your life and purge it that it might bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; You know what purging means? Cutting off things that just not necessary. &gt;&gt; That's what they do. A harborist, one or arborist, not a harborist. An arborist is one who takes care of trees. And you know what they do? They purge it. &gt;&gt; They cut off the unnecessary limbs &gt;&gt; to therefore the to make it more fruitful. &gt;&gt; See, so in Mark chapter 9 verses 19 through 20 and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in. Look at this. The lust of other things choke the word and it becomes unfruitful. And these are they which are sown on good ground, such as hear the word, receive it, bring forth fruit, some 30, some 60, some hundfold. Again, we see the deceitfulness of riches, but notice what else is listed. Other things. &gt;&gt; Wow. We could we could start uh having a fill in up here right now. Tell me what are the other things that can be a snare to you. What are the other things? It might be your hobby. It might be different things that you have that takes away your time from serving God, from going to church, from doing the things that you need to do. And it may not be sinful. It's just the cares of life and and these other things. God help us to be aware of that. In Luke 8:es 14 and 15. And that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. We all like pleasures. We all like the easy road. We like the nice things. If we're not careful, the pleasures of this life, &gt;&gt; can become a snare to you &gt;&gt; and bring forth no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. Pleasures of this life will deceive you if your heart's not right with God. the pleasures of this life. You know the Bible says that the heart it is a deceitful thing. In Genesis 6 and5 God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 28 26. He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y &gt;&gt; never trust in your own heart. Ah, just, you know, God, give me the desire of my heart. God, I don't want the desire of my heart. I want the desire of your heart to be my will. &gt;&gt; I want your will to be my will. Not not not don't turn me over to my own heart. &gt;&gt; My heart is deceitfully wicked. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 17:es 9 and 10, the heart is deceitful above all things. and desperately wicked. Who can know it? I the Lord searchth the heart. I try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. You will get what you sow. It is the law of God. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. So, I've seen so many good people how they've gotten snared by the deceitfulness of riches and the pleasures of this life and they choked over and it becomes unfruitful &gt;&gt; and next thing you know the love of many waxes cold &gt;&gt; and no longer on fire, no longer uh seeking God. Why? Because you just you you know look loud uh the lukewarmness God said, "I'd rather be hot or cold." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get in or get out, &gt;&gt; but because thou art lukewarm, I will spew thee out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; You know, when you go to the hospital and you have ingested something, a poison or whatever, they give you something to cause you to vomit, an epic or whatever they call it. I don't I hope I say it right, but they give you something and it's usually warm. Could be some kind of warm milk or something like that and they give it to you, get you to throw up. Well, imagine that the lukewarmness of this age, okay, causes God to want to spew you, &gt;&gt; you understand? &gt;&gt; Spew you out of his mouth. And a lot of times, what man calls the middle of the road, God calls lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. &gt;&gt; Let me burn for you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me be fanatical. Let me let me when I come to church, let me put my all into it. Let me put my shoulder to the wheel. Let me pray about the service before we come. And Lord, would you use the minister to speak to me? I don't want some flowery sermon we're all going to heaven because we're not. &gt;&gt; Broad is the way. And wide is the gate that leads to destruction and many go in there at &gt;&gt; but small and narrow is the way. &gt;&gt; God, I don't want to go the broad way. &gt;&gt; I want to go the small way. &gt;&gt; I want to go that narrow way. And it the Bible says in few be that go therein at God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people do you know that have endured for a season? They were there and they sprung up quickly, but then the cares of life and different things and next thing you know, they're burned out. Where are they? If we were to take a loan, John and Linda Laauo do the church directory. If we were to have everybody that's been in this church from the time that we started it, we couldn't hold them all here in this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that it would be amazing to me to see as many people here on a Wednesday night as what we have on Sunday morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just talking now and I realize there are a lot of people they have to work throughout the week. I realize that I I am not saying that uh put uh you know pressure on people because they can't be here on a Wednesday night. But I will say this, God help us that we don't become slackful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because yeah, Wednesday night, uh, you know, you if you only knew how busy I am. Listen, one of the busiest guys I know in this church is my son Amos. &gt;&gt; That guy, I I don't even like to ride in his car with him on the cell phone. He get Hey, can I call you back? Yeah. Okay. Over here. And stuff. And he said, "Dad, I tell you, I am so busy." He says, "I've got every excuse why to stay home." Is that right, Amos? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true, son. And I honor you &gt;&gt; because you honor God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an investment. &gt;&gt; Say that out loud. &gt;&gt; It's an investment. &gt;&gt; It's an investment. Do you really believe that you are investing? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That when you go to church and you invest by hearing the word because faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God, you're actually kaching. It's being invested into your family and into your life and into things because you know what? One of these days you're going to get out of here. But if you haven't been invested, &gt;&gt; huh? And you haven't been be &gt;&gt; been depositing into your account, guess what? You're going to be overdrawn. There's nothing there to draw from. &gt;&gt; You're going to be left behind. Why? Because you're a poor investor. &gt;&gt; I say if you're going to invest in something, invest in the kingdom of God. Seek him first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; In a hidden life with Christ, brother Brandon, we said we find out now that this arc being a type of the human heart, the heart is deceitful. That's where people fall today because they get a head religion &gt;&gt; and instead of a heart religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, don't let me just uh have a religion, &gt;&gt; let me have a relationship. &gt;&gt; We were we were over there in Thailand and boy, Thailand is a they have temples. It seemed like on every other corner big golden temples and you know all of this stuff and they got those guys in the orange robes and walking around their heads are shaved and and uh you know uh there's temples and and so there people are religious everywhere. They're just religious. I asked uh one of the people there I said your your wife she's she's a Buddhist. Um you know do they dance? Do they drink? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. They just kind of fit in with everybody. &gt;&gt; And you see, uh, that's just a religion. It's a covering. Brother Brennham said, "Religion is a covering." &gt;&gt; That's the first thing Adam and Eve did when they found they were naked. They made a covering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so religion can be just a covering. And that's why they just put up with uh we we we went to like a mall and outside uh we were going to take a little river cruise and go up and down and you're going to see the the lights of the city of Bangkok and and uh so anyway we go outside and here's uh man oh man they got all these different religions and they got the guys and they're doing their little dances and Har Krishna Har say it har and everybody's And you don't realize you're worshiping Hari Krishna and all of the it's just and and then my you talk about people not knowing identity because transgenderism is a plague over there. You just see it. It's well you know today I think my wife saw a lady walking around. She had a tail. &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of tail it was but she she had a tail. you want to be a cat or a cow or something, you know. &gt;&gt; Um, you may think that it's funny. It's not, saints of God. &gt;&gt; And I'm not making fun of them because I'll tell you what, &gt;&gt; where would you be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, where would you be? I'm not looking down at those people. I just say, "Thank God that thou has given me the eyes have, Lord, and the ability to see this." And I'm not looking down at them. I say, "Hey, but for the grace of God, there go I." &gt;&gt; I would have been a radical. I'd have been some weird freak. But God in his infinite mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let your desire of your heart be God's desire. &gt;&gt; Let his will be your will. I am a rich and increased in goods and I have need of nothing. They don't even recognize what they're missing. What they're lacking the most is character. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said in this life when it's all over the thing you take with you &gt;&gt; is your character. &gt;&gt; Your car, your bank account, &gt;&gt; your &gt;&gt; all that stuff's Yeah. It's gone. burn up. So all of this that you're trying to achieve here, guess what? You ain't taking it with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You lack character. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing to give you character, and that's the cause of Christ in your life. &gt;&gt; To give you full character &gt;&gt; that you might live for him. That's the only remedy for that situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram said in loud DC in church age, you had better come before it's too late, sayaeth the Lord, and buy of me gold tried in a fire. Then you will be truly rich. Are we getting it? Listen to me. Naked physically. We came into the world, but naked spiritually we will not leave it. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. We're going to take something with us. What that something is is all we can take with us. Nothing less, nothing more. We had better be real careful now to see that we take something that might make us right before God. So then what will we take with us? We will take our character, brother. That is what we'll take with us. &gt;&gt; Now, what kind of character will you take with you? &gt;&gt; What a question. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction? Or will it be the softness of the characterless &gt;&gt; loud you see in people? It's up to each one of us. &gt;&gt; For in that day every man will bear his own burden. &gt;&gt; If a man has $100 character and you give him $1,000, you've ruined him. It's not the riches that destroys a man &gt;&gt; because many of the men in the Bible were men of wealth. &gt;&gt; Abraham, Job, Solomon, but they had character first &gt;&gt; because otherwise the next thing the cares of this life will choke you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you become unfruitful. And so I want to show you before we close here tonight. I told you coffee is starting to wear off. Hurry up and finish this sermon. My bed is calling me. Luke chapter 10. I want to show you because we're going to look at two churches here for a moment. Two churches because a woman in the scripture is a church. &gt;&gt; Are we are we together on? Okay. Luke 10:38. Now it came to pass as they went and they entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word. And Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said, "Lord, does not thou care that my sister hath left me to serve to left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her. Now he's going to speak to Martha. Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things. Look, he he's discerning her heart. Why don't you get my sister who's wanting to just sit at your feet and hear your word, but listen, have her get in here and help me. I got to do the cooking and cleaning myself, and I'm trying to prepare and do things just for you guys. But one thing is needful. Now, Jesus, watch. He's correcting the air. One thing is needful. Mary hath chosen the good part. which shall not be taken away from her. &gt;&gt; Now he's given her a balance. &gt;&gt; I want you all to understand I as a pastor I think the greatest burden I have on my heart is to have b well balanced families. Don't be the the Martha who is so cumbered about her house and how it's clean and you know all the plates have got to be there and the silverware and everything is set. That's good. That's good. But what about Mary? Jesus said she chose the better part. &gt;&gt; I want all of you to understand you two are choosing a better part. I want you to &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be so cumbered, so burdened just about the house and cleaning and making sure everything is in order. Why not leave some of that alone because it'll be there for you tomorrow? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will. Your house don't clean itself. I understand it. &gt;&gt; But wouldn't it be better to choose the better part? &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus was saying. Martha, Martha, Bless your heart, sweetie. He says, "It's not so bad that you sit and you learn of me because Mary has chose that part." &gt;&gt; God, help us make a choosing in our life. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; this is actually story of two churches. &gt;&gt; One is so worried about that everything's got to be in order and everything and this and that. &gt;&gt; Wow. Sometimes I think we make the church too comfortable. &gt;&gt; We have air conditioning and we have heating. We have nice chairs. I've been to places there in Africa and some of you brothers Brighton and I'm sure any of you brothers from Congo, you go to places and I've seen them sitting on a 2x4 2x4 on two logs and the people sitting there for hours and they come hours before the church service starts and they sit on a little 2x4. If we did that and we took all of these chairs out and we gave 2x4s here and you had to sit on that, I guarantee it uh there'd be a whole lot less in attendance. &gt;&gt; I remember a little a little black boy was sitting right on the he was right up here close right to me. He was so tired. He's sitting there going like some of you do. And I thought he's going to pitch over any second and he's gonna he's just gonna go on a little 2x4, but he didn't. And I think that sometimes we have it too good. Sometimes less is better. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you can have the nice house and the nice car and the nice job and everything, but you have to work so hard to keep at it. And I had someone tell me not long ago, I'm just tired of the whole rat race. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of of the big city. I'm tired. I just would like to to have a house not so big, not so nice, just the cares of life. Not so who wouldn't, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come on. I I want all of you to to look at your lives first. Don't get something that you can't afford. &gt;&gt; Get something that's within your means. Otherwise, you're going to be a slave to whatever you're whether it be the car or the house. &gt;&gt; Okay? And then you're going to burn yourself out. And then you're going to want to say, "Let's just sell this and let's just go off into the bush somewhere and, you know, build a little cabin and we'll be happy." Well, seek first. &gt;&gt; Okay? Seek first the kingdom of God and all these other things &gt;&gt; will be added to you. &gt;&gt; Is this good? Is this the word? &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. Doesn't seem so spiritual. But I'll tell you what, I'd rather see you seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness than all these other things and you become burned out. &gt;&gt; Your family's burned out, your kids are burned out, then you get burned out. And what good is it if you if you faint? &gt;&gt; It's not good. &gt;&gt; The Bible says don't faint in welloing. If you're not careful, just the cares of life. These two churches cumbered it means to to be unnecessarily burdened to distract with the cares and duties of life. You know I became a uh firstline supervisor at Ralson Pyina. I was the first employee. Any of you ever gone to Flagstaff and you see the big parina tower there and and you've gone through there. I was the first employee hired. first one. And uh anyway, I was there and I got hired in the warehouse. Next thing you know, uh they offered me a job to become second shift manager and uh I did. I took it and everything and I was the highest paid babysitter in all of Flagstaff. and the warehouse of, you know, the warehouse is usually the the the dregs of the company. They're they're usually, you know, the not the most intellectual and, you know, they just drive a forklift and they're big and they carry heavy things and and uh stuff. Anyway, I wasn't part of them and uh I told my guys, I said, "Guys, I'm not going to babysit you." I said, 'I'll tell you, if you will listen to what I'm telling you, I says, if you'll work hard hard the first two hours, you can coast the next six. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; On any job. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; If you'll manage your time and you will really bust it for the first two hours of the job, you'll find the next six you can kind of coast. Okay. And I wound up in the whole I'm not bragging here. It's just fact that I took one of the worst efficient manh hours per forklift operator on how much that they load in the box cars and this and get shipped out. We had some of the worst these guys. you know, you just couldn't motivate these guys. I took the worst of the whole grocery products division and we became the most efficient and everybody in the front office loved it. Say, Ron, how do you do it? How did you take all of these guys? Because they all had bad records. Okay, they did. They all had bad records and uh everything. And I said, "Because you know what I've done? I've told them I'm not going to babysit you. I'm going to treat you right." I said, "The company policy, none of you are allowed to use the company phone. You're not allowed to. You can't call home. Your wife is sick." It was before cell phones. Any of you remember before cell phone? It was called the landline. Do you remember the rotary? Put that in front of a kid now. What? &gt;&gt; They Yeah. Ronnie, you remember that? The old rotary. Yeah. you remember? So anyway, um I went ahead and they had a 20 minute lunch period. I said, "I'm giving you 30. I'm going to go ahead and give you 30 minute lunch." I said, "Instead of 10-minute breaks, I'm giving you 15. I'll let you use my company office to come in and call home if you need to, if it's important." I said, "But if you abuse it, you lose it." And I said, "So any of you come in here and I catch you just abusing the right that I give you." I said, 'Then everyone loses it. So I said, "So all of you are put on a disciplinary action you have to keep yourself because if you abuse it, all the rest of the guys, everybody here will lose it." And so it wound up that by God's grace, it wound up that we got these guys and and you know what? It turned them into a a real operating machine. And we did well. And they even said, "Ron, we'd like you to go to corporate headquarters and tell the people how that you've made your second shift warehouse crew as efficient as what they are." And I just told him, I said, "I am not a babysitter. I am going." And one of the first line supervisors came out because usually at 4 or 5:00, everybody in front office goes. Second shift is from 3 to 11. So we kind of had it our so very seldom do we have anybody from the front office. All the managers and warehouse manager and personnel manager and them come but we had the personnel manager came and and our break uh room was above. We had to go upstairs into a break room and my office was downstairs. So he sat in my office and you know exactly when you have your lunch and everything and he saw went 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes. And so he's he's upset. He's very upset. Ron, Ron, your guys are 10 minutes overdue. I said, "Yes, sir. I gave him that opportunity. I'm doing it." And I said, "When our efficiency drops," I said, "Come tell me." I said, "You know what? Otherwise, you give them 20 minutes, they're going to sit out here and talk on their forklift to one another and this and that and they're going to they're going to take the 10 minutes extra somewhere. I said, I give it to him. And he said, "Okay, all right, Ron, but if your efficiency drop," it didn't. It went up. You see, saints of God, and here's here's what I say with all of you. I don't want to be the the biggest babysitter of a church within the message. No, I give you all adult responsibility. You know what you got to do. You know the responsibility. You know you should come to church. You know you should be prayed up. You know these responsibilities. Yes, you've got kids. Yes, you've got a job. I understand all of the above. But Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Here is a desire that I have always placed before God since God has placed me to be a pastor. Here's what I would like to have the highest percentage of people in my church to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's what I would desire. Lord, let me preach to him &gt;&gt; a little rough. &gt;&gt; Let me be a drill instructor. Let me drill it into them. Let me be a good captain. Let me be a good leader that they would be good followers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I couldn't think of a better legacy to leave as a pastor &gt;&gt; than to say, "Brother Ron, you had &gt;&gt; you had over 50% of your church went in the rapture because &gt;&gt; two in bit One taken. Huh? Two at work, one taken. That's 50%. &gt;&gt; I'd like to have 70%. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to say 100%, but I that's being I think foolish. So, I don't want to be foolish. But my desire is Oh, God help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; That I might help your people. &gt;&gt; One of the greatest quotes that I've seen of the prophet and you have to hear it on the way that he says it. &gt;&gt; He says, "Lord, let your people love me." &gt;&gt; Wow. And he said it with such a meaning. Lord, &gt;&gt; let your people love me &gt;&gt; that I can bring them to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints, I I I would love for you to love me because I'll bring you to him &gt;&gt; because if you'll seek first the kingdom of God, musicians, if you come, coffee is ended. &gt;&gt; I'm tired. It's not easy to go over. We went into two countries. We spoke It's rough. I was gone only 12 days and three of those days are just in transit. &gt;&gt; The rest of the time you're in services. That's not easy. And the older I get, Sandy and I on our way home. And we kind of say this all the time. I ain't never going so far away again. Yeah. you say Lord willing because uh but I'll tell you when we were over there and I'll share with you this the little group there in Shanghai which if you look at the country of Thailand you put your finger on the very northern part that's Shang Mai the southern part is Bangkok and then there's a little appendage of land that goes down to Fuket which is your tourist spot that you know along the ocean and everybody everybody wants to go along the ocean and brother Malcolm Wano who has a real heart for mission he's gone there and let me tell you this guy [Music] he goes out and wins new converts and everything and and so we went there and we kind of thought this is you know a whole church of of believers No, they were new Christians just come out of Buddhism. Some of them a month, couple weeks. Wow. You know what it's like to meet new Christians that are just in love with him, that don't have a clue about the way to dress and all of that. They just love him. &gt;&gt; And so, you just start talking about God and how that you love him. and they look at us and they look at our wives and they see we're dressed different. What makes you different? Um, one thing, what is it? If you love me, you keep my commitment. &gt;&gt; I said, I'm just in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all. Wow. So the next thing you know this pastor, Pastor San, he he said, "My people would like you to pray for them." Do you know when you go through the book of Acts, you know, one of the greatest things that you see the disciples doing is they pray for people, lay hands on them, go, they're delivered of spirits. We had There was one guy and he said, "Oh, I'm I'm hurting so so bad here. I I I can't hardly move. Would you pray? Would would you pray? I I need God to touch me." Okay. So, we've got pictures of it. I go and I lay my hands and we all other new Christian believers, they're they're hands out like this just and they're praying behind us. and brother Mario and I and the local pastor and different ones were laying hands on and I reached down and I put my hand on the spot where he said he was hurting. I said, "Father, in the name of Jesus." I said, "God touch this me." And the next thing you know, he's going, "Oh, look, look, look. Oh, I'm healed. Healed. Healed." How many believe that God, if you'll just have faith in God, &gt;&gt; these signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; I love him. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us &gt;&gt; to not let the snares of Ladya and the deceitfulness of riches rob you. choke the very life of God out of you &gt;&gt; if you're not careful. It's so easy to happen. &gt;&gt; You just become a little lukewarm pleasures of life. Oh, next thing you know, you just your spirituality is being choked out of you. What happened to all the people? Where'd they go? Many of those that did run. My wife and I have been reading the seven church age book and we're we've been going through and I'm probably going to preach on this on Sunday morning. And it says, "And the fire of God, if it's lit, if you don't refuel it, &gt;&gt; you'll turn from fire unto a form. You're just a form of religion." &gt;&gt; So I think I'll preach Sunday morning from fire to form. God, &gt;&gt; don't let me become a form. &gt;&gt; You cannot get warm &gt;&gt; by a painted fire. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say it. &gt;&gt; I want to experience it. &gt;&gt; I want to be on fire &gt;&gt; of God that other people can see it in our lives. &gt;&gt; How about you? Y &gt;&gt; is that your desire? &gt;&gt; Maybe. And I I got home and I thought, you know what? Maybe I'll play a tape tonight because I'm so tired around 10 11 o'clock during the day. My eyes are crossing. I can't hardly see it. I'm thinking, why why did I say I'll take Wednesday night service and ah like this and you're just Any of you that's traveled internationally, you know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It's not easy. You're in a different time zone &gt;&gt; in your body. And your time zone coming back is much harder. You know why? Because you're at home. You're in your house. And so if you want to get up, you can. If you're in somebody else's house or somewhere, you know, you just kind of lay there and suffer. it at home. So anyway, I do love all of you. &gt;&gt; And this little thought, let it be your desire. Don't let the cares of life, the pleasures of life, that wasn't sin. eating, drinking, pleasures of life, cares of life. Yeah, but the Bible says if you don't provide for your family, but didn't say you had to have the biggest and best. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; The cares of life choke out the seed. Nothing wrong with the seed. It's where it's planted. &gt;&gt; And I ask all of you, how is your ground? Is it thorny? Is it stony ground? Is it on the way side? How about good ground, Lord? Let thy word be hid in the good ground of my heart. &gt;&gt; Not just 30, not just 60, but 100fold. Let's stand together this evening. God bless you. Brother Mark, would you lead us in this song, please? &gt;&gt; This is my desire to honor you. This is my desire to honor you, Lord, with all my heart. I worship you.
