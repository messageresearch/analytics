somebody give him praise this morning I'll tell you yeah yeah Glory [Applause] he's God Matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. Hallelujah then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the fully said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut I want you to notice in they that were ready and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I said to you I know you not watch therefore for you no neither the day nor the hour were in the son of man cometh Revelations 19 if you turn with me please while you remain standing Revelation 19 verses 5 through 10. and the voice came out of their Throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and he that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth that let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come in his wife hath made herself ready notice that and his wife hath made herself ready amen and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in the fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy father God now in the name of Jesus I ask that same Spirit of Prophecy that was upon John there on the Isle of Patmos when he was told to come up hither immediately he was quickened and got into the spirit I pray heavenly father as you have already came in the early portion in the song service father I pray come let the anointing of that same Holy Spirit Come anoint Thy word Lord I pray and let everyone make themselves ready for your soon coming I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you and be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord amen I want to title my sermon get right into it Rapture Ready I don't want to take a title of subject how was your walk with God you know we can talk all kinds of spiritual things we can act religious we can do all of those things we can go to church but I want to know how was your walk with God because it is your daily walk with God that is your measuring post that God measures You by how is your prayer life how is your walk with God how is it that you walk with him daily or is it this three times a day father bless his food this morning Lord bless his food this afternoon Lord bless my evening meal I need to have a walk with God 24 7 365 I need to be in his presence that's where I belong that's where I am strong in your presence Lord rapture ready if the Rapture of the church were to take place at this very moment I want you to ask yourself would I be in that would I be taken would I be going or or have I been being a a little lackadaisical about my walk I I haven't been as fervent as I should oh my brother my sister we are facing the greatest moment of the of the church since the the foundation of the world since the beginning of the creation of God God remember right now in the loudestian age this is the crescendo this is when the Maestro is bringing this to the greatest Crescendo he did all of that he thought of you before the foundation of the world he created the world he he allowed sin to come he allowed the devil to come and do his say Stars fell from heaven there was a great cataclysmic thing but God said it's all under control I'm bringing it back I'm bringing back restoration I'm bringing back reconciliation and today in this hour in the darkest of all times he has shown the greatest light somebody say Amen to that [Applause] and guess what if you've seen that light then you're a part of it if you haven't seen it then I pity you because the next thing that you're going to see is the Tribulation and oh God let everyone that's here let's everyone that has a real seriousness and a consecration with God may you be so serious to say oh God let me be in the catching away are you ready to go with him the Bible says that he shall come as a thief in the night oh if we'd only known what hour he was going to come I would have been ready oh he comes as a thief he has announced he has sent all of his proclamations he has sent his signs he has sent a flashing red lights he has Sent His prophets he has sent his ministries he has sent all of this that you might know the day and the hour in which you live Hallelujah that we've got to be quickened to this hour not looking back to what God has done not looking ahead to what he will do but let us see what God is doing right now brother Branham said in the sermon God hiding in simplicity the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride the church goes through for purification sure under that Sixth Seal right Israel does the same thing for the hundred and forty four thousand but not the bride the brightest forgiven she goes straight to Glory in a Rapture that's right she my opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days it might come and you won't know nothing about it remember it's a secret secret catching away he'll come in an hour that you think not you won't know nothing about it she'll be gone be too late then I say oh God let everyone that is here Quicken themselves this morning to realize the lateness of his hour you don't have no time to stray you don't have no time to get away from the word of God this is the time you've got to press the battle this is where you've got to go towards the goal oh if you're going to fight fight a good fight if you're going to run run to win the prize keep us away from this loudly seeing Spirit to want to just be lukewarm neither hot nor cold oh God give us members who are so on fire for God hallelujah Enoch is the type of the bride of Christ for he is the seventh from Adam a type of the seven Church age that is going to be caught up you know what's interesting about Enoch is he never did any miracles he never preached a sermon he never did anything the Bible does not record anything the Bible says and he walked with God simply he did something so simple most people Overlook it I want to ask you this morning how is your walk with God and he was none because God took him Walking with God think about that for just a moment it's a sign of Fellowship walking is fellowship now I want you to notice the Bible says in first John 1 and 7. but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin my brother and sister I want to ask you are you walking in the light and I'll tell you just get around somebody and talk to them and if they're talking to you about the Phoenix Suns or some kind of football team basketball team or who's doing this or that I could care less do you hear me I could care less so I don't want to hear about that I really don't want to hear about your business I want to hear how is your walk with God I want to know have you been eating of God have you been eating that word where that word so stimulates you Hallelujah that everything in your mind Hallelujah is it is is coming to the place I want to be right with God amen when you walk with God you have fellowship with God when you walk in the light you have fellowship with God amen Romans 6 verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so also we also should walk in newness of life Hallelujah newness of life because old things have been passed away and all things have become new I'm not worried about what you did back then I don't want to hear about the old you I want to hear about the new you I want to hear about the resurrected you I want to hear about the one who was raised from the dead I want to hear about you that was raised in a resurrected Ministry hallelujah how many believe that he is the resurrection he is the life when you get into Christ yeah it is not a religion it is a relationship it is a love affair between you and God it is not lighting candles it is not pressing play it is getting in where your life Hallelujah you're feeding it is a one way between you and God come on your conduct and your behavior right now either convicts you as a Believer or convict you as an unbeliever is there enough evidence in your life right now for somebody to say I can tell by the fruits he's a believer oh God help us to live a life amen I want you to judge yourself this morning how is your walk with God oh God why do you have this burning in my soul this morning am I here to just warn your people oh but God I pray that each one will take this as a solemn morning I want you to to know he's coming he's coming are you ready for his coming Romans 8 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Walk With Me Lord on the road to Emmaus they were walking and you know they were walking and he was there he was there with them and I and the Bible says in her eyes were holding that they didn't know oh God I wonder how many today on that road to Emmaus he's been walking with you he's been right beside you he's been leading you and guiding you and you haven't your eyes are not open oh my Emmaus means a place of strong desire a place of earnest desire oh if we would have that Earnest desire this morning and we would walk with him and we would just say oh God if I'm not recognizing you're here Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and the Bible says and he made as though he would go further let me tell you if you are just fleeing this morning with God he will move on he is a god he's an omniscient God he's omnipotent he's omniscient he's omnipresent but my brother my sister he doesn't play he's God and you need to have respects towards God because one of these days his grace and his Mercy will turn to wrath into judgment I say run run now into his grace right now while there's yet the door open because the door will soon shut Galatians 5 16 then I say walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the last of the flesh that's the problem you are filled too much with Instagram you are filled too much with Facebook you are filled too much with the other things and your mind is cluttered up I tell you let us steadfastly set our face towards Jerusalem if you got the Rapture on the horizon it ought to be on you in the morning it ought to be you on you in the noon time it ought to be on your mind when you go to bed at night Hallelujah brother Warren you just was down in Veracruz and you preached the gospel 10 people came in oh Hallelujah and they got baptized I tell you oh God one of these days the last one the last one's gonna come in and we're going to get out of here they might be here this morning I'm on something this morning the spirit of God is on me and I'm on your case if you aren't in the place that you're at the hound dog is on you he's got you smell down he's got the nose of the spirit he knows where you have [Music] yes sir I'm on your case and I hey you can run but you cannot hide [Applause] Hallelujah somebody say I love him amen and if you love him you serve him amen because if you don't serve him you're not in love with him amen he said if you love me you keep my Commandments that's why we do what we do that's why we live the way we live not because of fire insurance if you're serving God because you're afraid of going to hell let me tell you you need to serve God because you're in love with him amen not for some fire Insurance because you're afraid of going to hell no I'll tell you what the Bible says that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance if God ever put it on your heart to get right I tell you move quickly move quickly why because the door is quickly shutting and one day when the door is shut and it's over and they that were ready went in and those that were not ready I ask you are you ready are you Rapture Ready this morning amen now walking in the Bible is a sign of Fellowship it is a type of a person that's obedient to what they have heard preached without Revelation it's impossible to serve God Ephesians 2 and 2 says we're in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience you want to see why those people out there are acting the way they do you want to know why they are all tattooed up why they color their hair why they do the things that they do they are doing The Works of their father do you understand it is the spirit of Disobedience that's why they look at you and they think you're crazy they look at you and think that you're out of this world oh you are out of this world you don't belong to this Cosmos you don't belong to this Kingdom my kingdom Jesus said is not of this world if it were of this world you couldn't crucify me you couldn't stop me but because my kingdom is not of this world and he said in you that are here you're going to have trials you're going to have tribulations and understand but I will be with you even in you till the end of the world Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 and 7 for we walk by faith not by sight oh God help wean us help wean us away from all of the carnal eyesight from all of the carnal thinking from all of the five carnal senses why because that only causes you to recognize what's happening around you oh but God give me a portion of Faith this morning let me look Beyond this realm look let me look into the Realms of God let me see that angels are walking up and down these aisles let me see that they're hanging on the walls that God is there God omnipotent is ready to orchestrate the final move Hallelujah are you Rapture Ready Hallelujah the question is has been asked because Jesus said I want you to be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect how many of you realize that in your flesh you'll never be perfected oh you've tried you've tried to keep every commandment you tried to do that which is right but I realized my perfection is not coming in this flesh I fall on a daily basis I think wrong on a daily basis but I have an advocate before the father I have blood that stands between me and God why I said God I accept my blood I accept your your sacrifice and because of that God's not looking at me he's looking at the blood I walk not by sight but by faith amen the question has been asked do you get your perfecting from the the tapes or how about the fivefold ministry let me tell you it's neither one of them it's not just listening to tapes it's not just the ministry it is a combination of the both and it must be the Holy Ghost movie when you hear the tape it's to them who have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying amen it's not just the ministry the ministry is a tool in the hand of God it's not to minister it's not the Apostle Prophet evangelism who is it it's God it's God himself he's the ones perfecting the church [Music] questions and answers 1964 watch this here watch this question dearly beloved this is Brother Brandon's Reedy about the scripture of Ephesians 4 11-13 do we all let's see do we get all the perfecting of saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the Spirit are operating in different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts have believed all the word of the Lord and he goes on talks about a guy from Oregon and he says no they want to come here to church for the perfecting see that we get Fellowship one with another here at church but the perfecting comes between us and God the blood of Christ is what perfects us in the Holy Spirit do you see that it is not by your righteousness it is not by you keeping the Commandment but it's because God rich in Mercy a God knowing you couldn't keep it a god-knowing Abraham could not keep it so he gave Abraham an unconditional Covenant Abraham it's not what you do it's not how good you are it's not how you walk Abraham it's because I have made a covenant and it's unconditional I don't care what you do you can be a lion Prophet you can give your wife away you can do the things wrong you can get out of the will of God you can get into the wrong spot but guess what I will bring you to where I'm going to bring you Hallelujah oh saints of God you quit worrying about what God on whether or not he can bring you to where he's going to bring you it seems like at times I hit plateaus you know what you need you need a breakthrough that's what happens when you get on a diet you sit there and you go and you go and you lose a few and a few and until you plateau you know what they tell you to do you need to you need to press through you need to do something different Hallelujah that's what we need to do we need to press through this morning we need each one of you to say I'm gonna do some I'm going to press harder it must be a combination it's not just fling tapes oh I tell you what I don't know about any of you that love that voice more than I oh there's some about that voice every time I put that tape on good evening Saints I greet you in the name of Jesus there's no flash there's no Hollywood evangelism about it there's no Flair what it is it's in the humility and in the character and virtue of Jesus Christ no wonder I love the prophet because he loved him one of the most wonderful quotes I ever read brother Branham says oh Lord let the people love me Lord let the people love me that I can bring them to you God I don't care to be popular I don't care to be the most popular Pastor I don't care to have all of the big things no I'll

even have the ability I don't have I don't have education I didn't finish seventh grade he says I sit down with great monarchs and kings and he says in the he says I don't know which Fork to use for the salad I don't know how to cut my meat I don't know the etiquette and he said oh Father forgive me he says I don't have the eloquence of speech like Moses but you know what God Said you speak the way you are they will understand how many of you have heard him and and in butcher up the English language and and hate and taint and fetch and tote and all these things but you knew you know what he

puts the ball over the goal line Hallelujah God help us I want you to reach I want you to run I want you to fight and then I want you to do it with purpose [Music] perseverance I didn't give you the quote let's go perseverance I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that Ministry of perfection where the offices Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting the church them pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that I believe we're nearing that time now 1964. they were nearing that time now yeah Enoch was walking by Train by by Revelation there must be Revelation prior to translation amen Israel and the church 1953 I truly believe before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have rapturing faith we can't even have faith for Divine Healing let alone rapturing faith got to have a faith that'll change and Quicken this body and be taken away I believe there's a church watch this prophecy you want to hear what Elijah said you want to hear the spirit of Prophecy I believe there's a church on the road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning the church is coming out not a psychologist not some sort of put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out Church somebody say that's me watch Brethren said God's doing it it's not you doing it it's God doing it every time the word was spoke in the third pole Ministry it was sovereignly given you don't have to work it up you don't have to put yourself down because you when you look at the sovereignty of the the third pull you know what it was years sometimes in between one event to the next how many how many miracles did Elijah do in his all of his years how many did Elisha do it isn't something done every week it is in speaking this speaking that it isn't driving your car down let every light be green thus saith the Lord are you kidding me God don't waste his time on green lights God don't waste his time on carnal things I'll tell you what may you have a green light in the spirit it's time to go to church I got it it's time to get on your knees I got it it's time to get a hold of the spirit I got it it's time to get into this I got it Hallelujah are you with me now he said this third pull it's so Sovereign he said it means a lot of my uh letting go and giving away oh that means all of us also give way to those things those carnal things that don't matter it's God doing he that began to work in you what will he do he'll finish it how many believe that he's not a quick start oh some of you are so hard-headed and some of you are slow but I'll tell you what my daughter shared with me this the other day she said you know what Daddy she said in the ark they had all kinds of animals they had jaguars leopards cheetahs they had different things they had elephants slow lumbering elephants but you know what when the spirit of God are you listening to me when the spirit of God began to pull they two by two began to go and walk towards the ark and I'll tell you what the cheetah he might have been the first one there why he runs faster than all the rest but I'll tell you what while the cheetah is already getting in the ark here come the little turtle I'm on my way I'm on my way Hallelujah yes some of you are turtles some are you are big lumbering elephants but I tell you what God ain't closing the door until the last one is in Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord just keep moving keep moving [Applause] you like that hmm El Tortuga but I'm moving it may not be the fastest but I'm moving I got a determination and I'm moving hallelujah praise be to God we are God's business you are God's business you are God's workmanship Ephesians 2 and 10. we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them Hallelujah Ephesians 4 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherein you are called look at that worthy of the vocation Hallelujah that Greek word vocation it doesn't mean your your profession you might be a carpenter but God has called you to be a Christian Carpenter your vocation is in Christ your vocation your calling many are called but few are chosen amen you might be a housewife but you're a Christian housewife you might be a school teacher but you're a Christian School teacher you might be a lawyer but you're a Christian lawyer do you understand you might be a clap under but you're a Christian carpet walk worthy of the vocation wherein you are called [Music] end time evangelism getting the bride ready getting the bride ready that's what it is look at that huh Kitty the price don't tell nobody great that third pull don't you tell nobody it's a secret don't you get your line all tangled up in times like this oh this is the one you've got to be real sovereign end time evangelism getting the bride ready that's what it is now we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready prepared for the rapture how many of you have received the message then guess what you got a care package directly from God [Applause] put on your dancing shoes buddy you know what I got me a care package and everything I have need of to get me to the resurrections already here amen I don't need another message I need a revelation of the message I already got I don't need another messenger I already received the messenger I need to be obedient to that message somebody say Amen you are God's business you're God's workmanship what can do it according to Malachi 4 is to bring back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore saith the Lord that real event in time evangelism now I want to say these couple of words before I close I'll bypass the rest of these scriptures maybe sometimes get to them but I want to say this we believe that we're at the end time we believe in and though it seems like at the end time at this time that the message in messenger is both about broke oh my seems like we got more trouble than we've ever had seems like we got more trials than we ever had it seems like the messenger and the message that's just about broke a little bit bankrupt man I ain't got nothing I've done spin it all come on don't you got a little of that I'm broke man I ain't got nothing I'm no tingle dinero I ain't got it it ain't there looks like it just about somebody say broke yeah say it again say it again it looks like the message and the message just about broke what good is all the years of Ministry of telling the people where they're from and their name and all of this stuff what good as far as I'm concerned I'm going up into the Hills I feel like that many times I tell you what he felt like what good is it done I think what brother Stephen said I'm going to have a prayer line and no vision I don't need a vision I need a revelation because the Revelation is my vision lay hands on the sick they shall recover anoint them with oil God shall forgive them you understand Hallelujah we believe we're at the end time looks like it's Beth both wrote looks like we're defeated don't you worry you know it's usually at that time it's usually at that time it's usually at that time when God steps in on the sea of something he's been watching for a long long long long long long time Hallelujah guess what God is fixing to do something why it's been a long time as far as I'm concerned it's been too long may God says I'm always on time he's waiting for that turtle brother Brown said yeah that Turtle remember he's a little boy had a little turtle he said man he says you know come on come on move move he said the more I yelled at it the more it did huh that's what some of you the more that we yell at you come on what I did I put it in the water blue didn't move he said I hit it with a stick come on man come on get up he says so he said to build a little fire he said built a little fire put that little shell of that Turtle over and the neck came out here you know what something you need you need a little bit of fire you need a little bit of fire all built underneath you quit sitting on them peel waiting for something to happen God I'll tell you build a fire underneath you and you'll stand up and you will scream it's against the law to yield fire in a crowded building only unless there is a fire then everybody starts crying fire fire I got fire shut up in my bones I got a fire Ezekiel said I got a fire that's in these bones I can't quit I can't give up I won't back up I want to I won't give excuses no sir I gotta fire hallelujah how many of you got a fire if you don't then God I pray fan the Flames stand [Music] amen I'm blowing on some of you this morning come on come on a little smoke that's it that's it same yeah yeah yeah watch this the sermon the absolute 1933 in June he said it's John the Baptist was center for forerun the first coming Christ I sent you with a message to the world to forerun the second coming of Christ and around the world she went Revival fires have been built for 15 nearly on Every Mountain Divine Healing Across the Nation power restoration I believe she's ready to strike the final climax Yonder to bring forth of faith that'll wrap the church into Glory it's the truth she's laying in the messages now stop there for a second she's laying in the messages because the message is Christ when she's in Christ she's in the message do you understand she's laying in those messages and when the word is spoken there's quickening power to the voice of God in the beginning God said let there be light and he quickened it to light God said let there be the firmament and he brought the firmament and God said and everything that he spoke he quickened with his voice is it no wonder that in the days of the voice of the quickening power of God that when he Hallelujah when he spoke let me tell you there was a in the congregation he said I say just enough that if they're elect seed they'll catch it he don't have to explain it from Genesis or Revelation he says just enough and they say I got it whoa I got it like that woman at the well no man speak told me oh Hallelujah Hallelujah this message we're really at the end time she's laying the message we've talked about it and everything but the thing has moved upon us now it's moved Upon Us listen saints of God I'm going to declare something to you it's not coming it's here I'm going to prophesy to you it is here brother Ram said that third pull you all know what it is he says it's been Vindicated before you he said it's in me now it's in me now I am the resurrection and the light he who believes in me shall never die I am the resurrection and the life what about you you got Christ how was your walk with God I want all of you to understand God is quickening me this morning to tell you are you Rapture Ready and if you're not all you got to do is say Lord help me Lord help my unbelief Lord I believe that that thief on the cross that Thief he said when the other one reviled against the Lord Jesus he said hey how dare you do that this man has done nothing to deserve death but we do all he said oh my God all he said he wasn't baptized he didn't hear a sermon of Jesus he said Lord when you come into your kingdom would you remember me Jesus said I tell you this day you will be with me in Paradise let me tell you my brother my sister something's moving right now among the bride you don't have time to get out there you don't have time to be the prodigal you don't have time to get out here and do that I'm talking to young people I'm talking to older people if you've never gotten into Christ I tell you right now you need a ride as quickly as you can you need to ask Christ to come into your life he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not life we must prioritize Our Lives focus on what is most important let me give you a scriptural example Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew 22 verses 2 through 5. the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and send forth his servants to call them that were bitten to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them that are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen my fattening are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage and they made light of it and they went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise see they made light of it I wonder how many people today are making light of this well we heard about his coming all these years we've heard and you know this and that well they one by one the Bible says in Luke 14 let me follow along just before I close Luke 14 verses 16 through 24. they said in him a certain man had a great supper and bade many sent his servants at supper time to say unto them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I've bought a piece of land or a piece of ground and I must needs go see it I pray thee have me excused don't let real estate stop you Saints buying houses and lands well I you know I look as soon as I get this and when I close escrow you know then I'll get snow another said I bought five yoke of oxen I gotta go prove them I pray have thee have me excused also business opportunity and he gave me a promotion oh I I you know as soon as I make some money enough to retire I'll be all right another said I am married a wife what's getting married Got to Do with It [Music] yeah yeah take her with you yeah that's right but maybe she's what's hanging you up because you got the wrong one you didn't pray about it well I married a wife but what I'm seeing hey hey don't let any of these be your excuse huh no none of you because I want to ask you what's your excuse if you miss it which one are you going to say when you get to it uh well I pray thee have me be excused okay your excuse go ahead anybody else here uh look I I'm going to be buying a piece of land would you excuse me brother Ron yeah yeah okay go ahead the Kingdom of Heaven is like an unto a man who is throwing a marriage supper and he sent his servants and he and he went and he he went to those that were bitten God bid you to come I've made all things ready I've got everything prepared the feast is ready come come now for all things are ready excuse me this is serious business married a wife therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord to these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly to the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou is commanded yet there is room the Lord said on the servant go on to the highways and hedges tell them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of these men that were bitten shall taste of my supper what a poor excuse brother random now before I give you this quote let me let me say you as a pastor right now what I feel God is doing he's compelling the last ones that come in he's compelling now it's not them waiting for a sign it's not them waiting till La sinks and then they get serious right now by a still small voice that has been calling you since you're a little bitty baby and he's been calling you and wooing you and asking you to come I remember in 1969 I was a counselor for Billy Graham crusade Anaheim California Anaheim Convention Center the largest youth convention Billy Graham has ever had in the course of his ministry and if any of you have ever met Billy Graham or come close to him I was about from here to brother Jimmy Tempe in the back of the church that's about how far I was away from him brother Jim and when he made the the call to come forward and they were playing that song Just As I Am Without One Plea and here was Billy Graham I knew he was a great man there was such a an aura sauna about him he said yes you up in the altar up in the the up in the balconies and you hear he says every time that Christ bid his disciples to come he had them do a public show Christ is bidding you right now yes if you feel a tug in your heart I want you to come yes that's it my brother my sister and Billy Graham says I believe God is making one of his last calls in America today and and here and you saw the people coming oh my let me tell you I believe my brother my sister what God is doing right now as he's bidding the last ones to come amen because I feel it in my heart it's almost over it's just about home time the Gaither Trio I think they sang that song I can hardly wait no it wasn't Gaithers is another old-time God and they say I can hardly wait to enter the gate can't you hear those shouting sounds tell you what listen listen can you hear him they're across the border they're screaming and they're shouting Hallelujah come God omnipotent Reina there's shouting sounds all over because the closer I get to the gate I can hardly wait to hear those shums out amen but until then what I do as a minister I say Okay God God it's only by your spirit because the Bible says that the presence of God and the goodness of God leads you to repentance it's not somebody leading you come up here brother sister no it's that still Small Voice and you know whether or not you that you have committed your life to Christ or not watch this perseverance when that Rapture takes place it'll be a change and the first thing you know that change that you're caught up into and gone away and the sleeping virgin it moves right on just the same thinking everywhere everything's going fine and they're already gone it's already happened and you knew it not I don't say like it'll be like that Romero I'm not saying the Lord tells me it'll be that way but I believe it's so close at hand it's possible I don't want to take any chance I want to be ready I want everything ready I don't want the weight later the weight laid aside whether how it comes probably the way we got it all drawn out will be different it's always is than what it's been planned his first coming was that way in the second coming will probably be the same thing let's pray now let's be sincere have you been caught up in the revelation because it'll be you to be caught up in the Revelation before you're caught up in the translation you have to be changed into the newness of life before you change dimensions musicians come on up I'm not done I'm not done almost but I'm not Enoch walked with God he walked differently didn't he so this walk was not just walking up right on two feet because there was millions of people walking and it says he walked with God what about you have you been walking with God lately when was the last time that you got alone and God Alone with God in your prayer closet when was the last time that you took a walk and he just said Walk With Me Lord amen walking is fellowship sometimes you can walk with a buddy and a friend and you're hiking and Elias you can be walking down for miles and not say a word and you've had wonderful Fellowship while you were just walking you were together with your friend your buddy Walk With Me Lord [Music] Walk With Me Lord come [Music] in the trials walk with me in the fire walk with me through the flood Walk With Me Lord is that your desire he'll walk with you right now if you'll ask him if you will be so sincerest to say Walk With Me Lord I I've been straying I I kind of been doing my own thing the cares of life and different things just walk with me [Music] [Music] [Music] let me share with you another scripture Galatians six seven through nine be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall we reap for he that sought to the flesh shall have the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth through the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not I looked up the word so to sow that's used 53 times in the scriptures talks about sowing 43 times it means to scatter seed Zara z-a-r-a Zara to sow seed [Music] please where it means also to become pregnant [Music] 43 times it is used the word Spiro which means just sowing seed only four times in the Bible [Music] it's Zara to receive seed as becoming pregnant and Zara is close to Sarah was she not receiving Abraham's seat years from their youth onward in no child no child no no conception but when faith came into the Bible says and Sarah having received Faith to conceive see Zara to absolutely conceive the message how many message Believers have been hearing sermon after sermon going to church and doing this and that going to youth meetings and everything but they're not manifesting or conceiving this message in their life why they've not let it conceive it's not mental [Music] in the womb of your mind Let It Go Beyond and then let it have the bedding ground of your heart Thy word oh God if I hid in my heart that I learned not to sin against you so sowing seed is not just giving out but four times he refers to to conceive seed so the majority of the time in the sowing of seed is actually meant to be are you receiving it are you listening this word to receive seed so many people have gone to church in church and heard sermon after sermon and their life has never changed change my heart oh God [Music] oh God [Music] I want to ask you have you been sowing to the flesh [Music] only you answered that well no wonder you're reaping such corruption around you it's the law of God be not deceived do not mock God for if you sow to the wind you shall reap a whirlwind what if you shall sow to the spirit so I want to ask you you that have come to church this morning are you receiving the seed saying brother Ron I take it to heart what you just said let it conceive in me let this message become alive in me let it come out of the books and off of the tapes huh let it become a living entity let it become living vessels that each one of us would become living Epistles a book sealed within and without sealed with Seven Seals wide those Seven Seals is Christ [Music] amen are you rapture ready [Music] I'm sorry I I couldn't type fast enough this morning and I'd very quickly put this together [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is for somebody here today God would not put me through what I've been put through God would not take this and tell me just two words two words Rapture Ready [Music] you heard the songs [Music] I'm going to take back huh Austin you sing that enough you'll start believing in it you'll get your dancing shoes on you'll go into the enemy camp you will take back every promise huh huh [Applause] amen you see how you guys all responded to his positive huh yeah this is a positive gospel preacher don't tell me what I'm not tell me what I am the things that are wrong with me I know that tell me the things that are right with me go on and tell me why because when I hear and I understand who I am and when I recognize who I am I will take my position because we're position is power and pleasing with God then you will know your purpose right now you're tossed around every window Doctrine I don't really know what what is my purpose it's cause you don't know who you are amen [Music] so I'm gonna go fishing this morning it's okay I'm gonna go fishing I feel led [Music] he said cast it out now let it go down real deep [Music] he said you don't want the little fishy they all swam after it he said Let It Go real real deep let this sermon right now go real deep and if God has been speaking to you and you realize that maybe you haven't been there where you should be [Music] and he said now don't get your line all tangled up in times like this he says now make that third pull boom he said that'll catch him what is the third poll the revealing of the word and so God is revealing the word to you of who you are and your position and if you recognize that then I want you I want you to publicly make that declaration now I'm first going to make it first now let me tell you is there somebody here that has never given their life to Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior if you haven't I want you to stand foreign God is making his last and final call around the world right now I don't beg and I don't coax and I and I pray that everybody here but maybe you're a little kid maybe you're somebody maybe you're an older adult and you know you've never really given your heart to God [Music] played around maybe you've gone to church I mean just been caught up in this whole movement it really you didn't even know if this message is right and you've just been following the crowd is there somebody who says pray for me because I need Jesus Christ in my life all right now
