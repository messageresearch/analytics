thought it was me it wasn't me it was this sound system I had brother Jude Murray come up here I want them to see the technician that put this thing together that way we know who to blame when uh

you're not seeking God and you don't have your spirit sensitized you could have the word of God and it be very anointed to he coming right across but it'll fall right in front of this Pulpit unless you are doing your job that means seek knock and ask amen so if you've got something on your heart and there's something that you would like from God tonight then why don't you just ask him but the thing that you need to do is say Lord maybe this week I've gone through some yeah my heart is calloused it's a little bit hard right now soften my heart with oil amen so that I can receive how many

call a conference with his children without having something for them and I believe if he's gathered here tonight he has something in store for those who believe and amen I just want our heart to be to be tender and open to him and amen the beautiful thing about it is we've been taught by a prophet that as you hear the word and you re receive the word you become the word so I believe tonight there's a people that's in position to hear the word to receive the word and as they leave here they're becoming the word they're hearing amen let's just bow our hearts together tonight for a word of prayer and let's just invite him to come Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon father some of them been in the workforce today different places father maybe in school Lord different activities of life but Lord as they've set aside these few moments tonight to come into your house and Lord to lift up holy hands and to begin to worship you and to begin to exalt the name that is above every name Lord we know that we're two or three are gathered together you made a promise that you would come and you would be in our midst and Lord as I look across this building tonight there's more than two or three here but there's a house full of Believers tonight that have gathered under expectation Lord that your word that has been written has been prophesied has been has been laid in the scriptures for years but Lord tonight that it would come off the pages of the word and it would come into their flesh and Lord that we could leave here father Lord not just hearing a man or singing the songs but Lord leave here and say did not our hearts burn within us not as brother Andrew come and talk to us along the way but Lord as you came down and took your word and begin to break the bread of life and to begin to feed your children Lord I pray that you would send your anointing in this building tonight father Lord not the anointing that would just put us on a on a few moments of an emotional High Lord an anointing that would destroy the Yoke of the enemy father Lord an anointing that would not just rest upon our flesh or move into our spirit but oh God an anointing that would seal our soul father until the day of our Redemption Lord we ask you father for those who are homesick may be Desiring to be here and can I pray you would send healing in their bodies for those that are here tonight with different things on their heart may your word just minister to every need and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory and the one wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says am amen and amen we love the Lord tonight don't we amen it's a real honor and a privilege to be here with you once again and we want to just thank you for the opportunity brother Ron to come and be in service with you all once again and I've just been enjoying a few days of fellowship with brother Ron and a different Saints and we're actually coming uh here from Saskatoon Saskatchewan so there's a host of Brothers have sent their greetings to you all brother meno FZ and since his greetings brother Dwayne Fair brother Kelly Hil Brent different ones said to be sure and bring their greetings uh to the church here so God bless you all from them and we bringing greetings from our pastor brother Shawn Martin the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle in blackburg Virginia amen it's just a real honor to be here with you this evening and if you have your Bibles tonight we'll go straight to the word we want to invite you in the New Testament uh to the book of Acts the 20th chapter the book of Acts the 20th chapter and sure good to see all of our friends here tonight different ones I don't want to start calling names will miss somebody but it sure is good to good to be in the presence of the Lord in fellowship tonight amen the book of Acts the 20th chapter and we want to look here in the 25th verse Paul here writing his Farewell words he says Now Behold I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more so Paul was not going about preaching himself but he was going about preaching the king Kingdom in the 26th verse he said wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God now watch verse 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath P purchased with his own blood now I believe believe that the things that Paul was declaring was actually going to become the food to the Church of the Living God he was not declaring himself but he was declaring the revelation of the word in the 29th verse he said for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and also of your own selves shall men arise so they're not going to come in from outside but they're going to arise of your own selves speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears now watch verse 32 and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this afternoon I want to by the the help of the Lord for just a few moments uh to speak to you tonight if I will title this I want to speak to you on declaring the message with Liberty uh declaring the message with Liberty I've just been uh studying and speaking a series of thoughts along these lines of of I started actually on a thought from Isaiah 35 on in the middle of the road uh with liberty and I was studying how that the Bible said there amen that there would be a highway and then Isaiah brought it down and said there would be a way and he said that would be the way of Holiness and he said said the fool shall not he therein if you study the New Testament Matthew 7:14 and 15 the Bible says that there's actually two ways there's the Broadway that leadth unto destruction and many go therein at but then there's a narrow way and that way leadth unto life and me he says few there will be that will find it and as I begin to study these things I begin to realize as uh the prophet of God would speak to us about the middle of the road and there be in a way amen that it would actually be essential for believers Amen to find a balance in all things both in our natural life as well as in our spiritual life and you know when I started thinking about that balance I couldn't help but think of how I've heard it shared that brother Brandon would actually tell brother Perry green he said brother Perry always keep your balance Amen in the scripture so brother Bram was not bringing something outside of the word amen but he was bringing something from the word and when you look at that word balance it means a condition in which different elements are equal amen or in their correct proportions it is the stability of one's mind or heing Amen to keep or put something in a steady position amen so that it does not fall so there's actually a direct connection amen between stability and balance between position and balance because the prophet of God would say if you go to the doctor and get a prescription uh the doctor will write a prescription he said now there's enough antidote in there Amen to upset the poison he said then there's enough poison to upset the antidote he said see because it's all got to be balanced now that's in the natural amen but then we understand that God has sent us a spiritual prescription amen and the prophet of God said the original and eternal prescription is acts the 2 chapter and he said if you'll take it to the one who wrote it amen he will give it to you and you'll get the same results that they got amen when they took it back then amen because see a prescription in order to have an effect amen it must be balanced now I'll just say what I believe here for a few moments amen I do not believe amen that God sent us an unbalanced message amen and they needed a bunch of preachers to bring into balance but I believe amen that God sent a balanced message Amen to a church that was unbalanced Amen to bring them from the ditches of fundamentalism or the ditches of Pentecostalism amen and to bring them to the middle of the road you know as well as I know the prophet said amen that the balance will be amen when you can get the two together now uh just just laying a foundation here he said if you could ever get that fundamental Faith amen or fundamental Doctrine with the Pentecostal people he said then my what a me meting that you would have and you know he would say that that the Pentecostals have been looked down upon as maybe a low class or on the other side of the railroad tracks are not that important a bunch of bunch of fanaticism amen so they would actually be looked at as the low class but then you would look at the the fundamentals and maybe they were on the maybe the the upper class and they would be looked at as educated or smart or whatever amen but a prophet was not coming Amen to to continue in a ditch he was coming to pull from both sides Amen to pull from the Pentecostals as well as the fundamentals amen and produce a middle class that would walk Amen in the middle of the road now when you start studying the middle of the road it's a beautiful study from a prophet he will say that the road is actually built Amen to where the highest part of the road is in the center he said the reason that is is because it lets all the trash amen wash off to both sides and I love how he says it he said see when the rain comes amen the rain will wash all the trash off amen so that does not leave the responsibility up to us Amen to keep the road clean but when the rain falls amen the rain has the ability to wash off the trash amen and keep a people centered and focused in the middle of the road he said that the true message from the scriptures amen it lays in the center of the road he also says that the angel of the Lord amen he dwells in the center of the road now this is my favorite quote he said I always preach in the middle of the road amen so when a Prophet was preaching he was not preaching from a ditch amen he was preaching from the middle of the road amen because if you get out of the middle of the road brother said then your adoption will leave you amen but we are here as a generation that is not running from adoption amen but we have come into our adoption and we are being positionally placed as the Sons and Daughters of God now you all know the prophet said that you were Sons and Daughters at Birth right amen you were a son at Birth but then your adoption amen would be your positionally plac it now watch a prophet he said some people when they get born again they sit right in the middle of the road amen Their Eyes On Christ but finally they get over here and they get so much knowledge and wisdom till oh they know it all he said you don't know nothing and if you don't do that he said then if you run off to a bunch of wildfire and fanaticism amen but right in the middle of the road there's a true sound unadulterated gospel amen and power of God right down through there taking the Kings and the monarch where anybody can stand in Search and they can see amen that it's the power of almighty God it's not a fanaticism amen neither is it a formality it's the power of God Amen it's a beautiful thing I don't have time to give you the whole study tonight amen but it's a beautiful thing to watch a prophet run this all the way through and even come down and say some have made the gospel of Frolic he said then some have made it a funeral procession right he said but it's neither he said it's a feast amen amen so a feast is only found in the middle of the road friends I've always he said tried to keep a balance of the road he said you get way off on formalism just as form and ritualistic as they can be he said and people grab for that a lot then if you don't want that you get Plum on the other side just just fanatic amen but there's a middle of the road how many will agree there's a middle of the road amen where the true sound San gospel is preached amen and God moves in there vindicating it to be the truth amen then that does not relieve or that relieves preachers from the responsibility amen of vindicating the message Amen to receiving a message that has already been Vindicated he said the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit just to move as the spirit moves amen not till or after amen but just as the spirit moves amen I believe here tonight that that we are a spiritual people I believe we are Desiring amen the leadership of the spirit of God right amen as sons of God they are led by the spirit of God and you know as sons of God sometimes we wonder amen what do we really need to be what God has called us to be you know maybe someone say well I needed to be born in this family or I needed to to come out of this move or I needed to come out of this church amen but I believe that all we need Amen to be what God has called us to be is Liberty amen the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 3:17 he said now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now that word Liberty has a beautiful definition it is the Liberty to do amen or to Omit things having no relationship to Salvation amen Liberty is a license it's the Liberty to do as one pleases a watch this true Liberty is not living as we want to but it's living as we ought to amen so if we have Liberty amen then we're not living according to our flesh amen we are living according to our spirit amen which is on the inside which the Holy Ghost has taken control of the control tower amen and I believe that God has sent a message at this hour amen that has omitted all the nonsense amen and things that does not have any connection Amen to true relationship with God and true salvation the prophet said in the church age book not for one moment do I bring a message so he's declaring a message Amen to the people that they may follow me or they may join my church or start some fellowship my organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things amen but I do have an interest in the things of God Amen and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied and that one thing is to see established amen a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ amen and they are filled with his spirit amen and they live according to his word amen listen church I believe in receiving the baptism amen of the Holy Ghost but that was the third stage amen of a complete restoration amen we're not here just to receive the Holy Ghost and have a repeat of aus or have a repeat of 1906 amen but the justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made way for the person himself Amen to come down into the church amen in the Perfection of the word listen we're not just a bunch of Christians shouting on Sunday and living like the devil on Monday amen but this message has brought a stability it has brought a balance to the life of the church and we're walking and living according to his word amen and in that middle of the road we got Liberty how many how many agree in the middle of the road we got Liberty Amen in the middle of the road there is Liberty now when you start talking about Liberty amen we've got to identify amen the source of our Liberty now I love it because our Liberty thank you our Liberty is not man-made it is not maniv amen our Liberty comes from the word of God Amen now I believe the Bible is very specific in 1 John 1:1 it says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled amen of the word of life now watch verse Two for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness amen and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father amen and was manifested unto us amen that which we have seen and heard amen declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ amen now watch these three words seen heard and declare that word see means to see with the eyes it means to see with the mind it means to perceive amen that word seen gives the pro uh the prominence to the Discerning mind amen then John says we've seen But now we've heard and that word heard means not to be deaf it means to perceive by the ear amen what is announced in one's presence it is to learn to give ear to a teaching or a teacher so John says we have seen amen and we have heard amen but now declare we unto you and that word declare means to Proclaim and to make known openly and he says these things right we unto you that your joy may be full and I love verse five amen this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you amen that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all now when you look at that word message the Greek definition amen is an announcement it is a a promise it is the act of promising it is a promise given or to be given it is a promise good or blessing so we could very easily brother Russell read that and say this then is the announcement amen this then is the promise this then is the blessing that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all I love what the prophet says he said father we ask tonight for Mercy amen for Liberty of spirit that we might be able to bring the people the gospel truth amen of what we believe to be the message of the hour amen for your church amen the only thing the prophet needed Amen to bring his message amen with some Liberty to bring it into he was not needing a denomination he was not needing a pope or a bishop amen or somebody to give him permission he was just needing somewhere he could have some Liberty to declare amen the things that God was revealing to him in the season that he was living you know as I look across this building tonight amen I see all kinds of Believers of different ages amen I believe we can raise our hands and we can say we have seen the message amen I believe we can say we have heard the message amen but I tell you what I believe I believe it's time to declare the message I think we've seen it I think we've heard it brother Robert I think now is the time Amen to declare it I love what Isaiah says in Isaiah 48:6 he said th has heard and see all this and will not ye declare it I have showed thee new things from this time amen even hidden things that thou did not know them amen so here is coming secret things into Revelation amen the hidden things are becoming revealed amen now you all know the prophet reads Deuteronomy 29 and verse 29 and says the secret things amen belong unto the Lord Our God Amen so we have no right Amen to declare secret things that belong unto the Lord amen but those things which are revealed they belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do amen all the words of this law listen friends if it's still a secret it does not belong to us it belongs to God Amen but when it's revealed amen it moves from belonging to God un belonging to his children and we are not waiting for God to send a prophet and reveal the seventh seal and reveal the third pull he has already revealed it and there's a people on the Earth tonight who are the possessors of the revelation of the mystery of Christ that dwelleth in you amen I believe it tonight friends I believe that God sent a prophet Amen to reveal to this church amen that the most the most mysterious book of the Bible with all kinds of symbols amen belongs unto his children and the prophet of God says the Book of Revelation it has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the Bible it has more symbols amen why because it's a book of Prophecy it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood amen by a prophetic class amen a prophetic book has to be understood by a prophetic class he said this book is not meant for anybody or everybody rather he said the book is made for a certain class of people and can I say it to you like this amen The Book of Revelation was not going to be revealed Amen in a fundamental ditch amen because they would just made a morg out of it and neither was it going to be revealed in a Pentecostal ditch amen but when God sent a prophet Amen to pull from both sides and gather the seed in the middle of the road he began to declare the things that was on the back part of his mind amen because there was a people in the middle of the road that would not become a fanatic with it and neither they become a a dead intellectual person now come on church amen but they would walk as Sons and Daughters of God Amen manifesting the desire of God for their lives amen the carnal mind cannot comprehend great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them amen but to the ones who are lovers of the word of God Amen to those who are lovers of the word of God Amen that who the book was written to amen the church amen I love that brother brother Ron amen the revealed things belong to us amen the revealed things they are our possession amen the revealed things that's our bread the revealed things that's our food come on that's why we're not out here blazing new trails and trying to find something new to say every week amen we're satisfied amen feeding from the wheelbarrow loads amen of food that's been stored up amen fine healthy vegetables have been restored and they've been released in this generation Amen to feed a bride and to move her from mortality into immortality amen the revealed things belong to us can I just go ahead and say it you are not a trespasser in the revelation of this message you got to ride in the revelation of what a prophet taught if it come from the scripture and it come from the message you got a right Amen to declare it because that's your food and it belongs to you amen that'd be like somebody that' be like somebody giving you a steak you know and somebody come along saying don't eat that don't eat that don't eat that well why can't I eat it amen it belongs to me amen and we got tapes where the Prophet said rapturing Faith amen is laying on these tapes amen then listen friends there ain't no man got a right to interpret amen what we can preach and what we can't preach amen God is sent a prophet in this generation to unveil the word and to release to us a seven course meal the revealed things belong to us amen now there's two powerful quotes I love amen the prophet says and from that time 62 he says my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or a teacher he said if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean to amen but this is my Ministry amen this is my Ministry see Amen to declare him that he's here amen a prophet was announcing a promise amen that Jesus Christ the son of God would return to the church in the form of his word but there would be a forerunner on the earth to announce he's here in the anointed ones at the end time he said the very day when this messenger when he starts on Amen not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pool was healing the second pull was prophesied amen but the third pull was the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed and there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember somebody say remember remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that was hidden in the word amen so if this is the third pool and I believe it is then the third pull was the moving amen of the Revelation from the mind of God to the soul of the believer and you know God has only one provided way Amen to declare his word and the prophet said that way is by prophets he said he chose his way his word came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being a part of God's word he says declaring the revelation of his word to that age and that time amen so when Luther come he was declaring the word for the revelation of the time he was living when Wesley come he come de Dearing the Revelation amen and listen when the gifts were restored to Pentecost they were declaring that this is the restoration of the gifts amen but don't stop there amen God sent a prophet who had a Moses anointing as well as a Joshua anointing Amen to bring us out of confusion amen but to positionally place Us in the promised land with an inheritance amen I believe as the prophet said amen the the the preacher that God sends the prophet of God of the age he said he's not coming Amen to make a declaration that the church has made but he's coming to make a declaration that God has made he's not declaring what the church has to say he's declaring what God has to say Amen now watch a Vindicated Prophet 1951 he said I stand Here amen declaring the creator of the heavens and earth Jehovah God he said I claim to be a representative his in these last days Amen to bring a faith to his church amen 1964 he says in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here amen under my control now we got that memorized we got we got guys love to quote that amen cuz the next thing they want to do is perform themselves you know amen they want to try to reenact ay side or try to go off on this tangent amen but read the rest of the quote he said I take every spirit in here under my control Amen to declare the word of God see a prophet had to declare the word amen cuz he had to give the bride a place to stand amen you cannot stand upon the shifting Sands of man's ideas you cannot stand upon your feelings you cannot stand upon your sensation amen but when the revelation of the word of God comes into the church it gives a bride a place to stand and there's a place by me amen come stand on the rock of Revelation where heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail listen we're not standing on our feelings we're not standing on our emotions we're not standing on personalities we are standing on the rock of Revelation and when everything else fails this word Will Survive because it's the only thing that will overcome the age that we're living in is the word of God Amen now I believe and I believe we ought to take every spirit in here to declare the message of the hour sir yes sir now we have a responsibility you read do you believe that brother said everything is a responsibility he said that's hard to say but it's true amen that ministers many times Sher a responsibility amen for standing for the true word of God when they're confronted with it they'll Sher back that responsibility he said but when truth of the word of God is brought face to face with human beings we are prone to Sher back until the last resource another place you said the church before the church can ever be taken to Glory it has to go through amen the world of criticism amen and sometimes we try to Sherk amen or pull back from criticism listen if you're waiting on there to be no critics to do something for God you're never going to do anything for him at all as long as there's time as long as there's a devil loose there's always going to be a Critic brother Ron we can't preach it quite enough and there's going to be a Critic we can't preach it loud enough and there's going to be a Critic we can't sing it soft enough and there's going to are you hearing me there's always going to be critics amen but listen the critics are going to criticize in a ditch amen but there's a bride who is home with Christian Soldiers and they're marching through criticism they're marching through opinions they're marching through man's ideas and they are declaring this message is the only way out of time into eternity amen God forbid I ever Sher amen the job amen he said God forbid I ever Sher Amen Let me just go and say this God forbid amen that the ministry ever Sher amen preaching this message cuz there's a bunch of a bunch of reprobates on the internet that ain't got nothing else to do but sit around and surf services and criticize ay they going to put me on there so God bless you amen just go ahead and surf around and criticize this pastor brother Ron I've actually wondered do they have a job how do they pay their bills amen because I know we ain't paying them to sit there and critique this sermon and critique that well I'm feeling pretty good tonight he me it's a critical devil and it's going to be here till the change of our body but I want to announce you can criticize us all you want to but we're not shutting up and we're not clotting down and we're not backing off of this message if we got to stand by oursel we're going to declare this message is the return of the power of the resurrected Lord in the midst of the Church of the Living God we will not back up because of criticism we will not change because of criticism because we have a responsibility to declare in Acts 20: 27 Paul says these words he says I have not shined Amen to declare unto you all somebody say all all the counsel of God Amen I love this word shine it means to draw back to let down to lower to with to withdraw it is of a timid person to withdraw oneself it is to be timid to cover listen it is of those who from Timothy hesitate to avow what they believe it is to be unwilling to utter from Fear amen so when Paul says this he said when the time come to declare the counsel and the the definition of counsel of God is purpose of God so Paul was declaring the purpose of God and the purpose of God is an eternal purpose according to Ephesians 3:11 right amen and then a prophet says amen that the purpose of God will never be defeated amen so that's why Paul did not come up against opposition when he was declaring the purpose of God and draw back because he knew the purpose of God would never be defeated listen to The Prophet woe unto me if I don't declare this counsil of God the people of his healing power and he's here yeah Christ the son of God is here to heal the sick and needy another place he said this divinely revealed amen by the Holy Spirit he said the same angel of God that directs me to see visions and so forth like that amen and the healing of the sick amen now watch a word Prophet is coming amen and he's declaring the nature of God he's declaring the thoughts of God can I say it like this he's even declaring the attitude of God the prophet of God said in the worst center in the city he said I told them Lord that you love them and you got the same respect for them that you did for that woman that night many years ago amen now here is a prophet amen it's in the message it is I Be not Afraid 54 he said breaking out of a human being he said and going into that Dimension listen who else stood in the pull pit amen and was preaching and broke out in a dimension of vision and said I can see Eve she's a blond-headed blue-eyed woman who else stood in the pull pit and broke out in vision and preached Adam and Eve leaving the garden with those bloody sheep skins hitting the back of their legs amen but a Vindicated word Prophet who was sent in this generation to declare the mind of God he said he cannot be a Healer once and not a Healer again he cannot be a god of Miracles one day and not a god of Miracles the next day for the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever amen the attitude of God is the same yesterday to today and forever he's still God he's still God Amen and if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any promise when that when you read it on the Bible it's the truth no matter how many tries to put it on another age or it's in the past age or it's an age that's in the future he never did declare he was the I was amen he's the I am always he did not come in this generation and declare I was or I will be now come on Church amen cuz we've had a lot of guys put it back in the past amen or put it so far in the future that nobody can obtain it amen but I want to declare to you 1 John 3 says beloved now now we are the sons of God see this is not in the future church amen and it's not in the past amen come on it's right here right now the Revival is on are you hearing me listen some of y'all been looking forward to church all day long you've been preparing for it you've been getting your spirit ready amen because at 7:30 you was going to start singing amen at 7:30 church was going to begin to happen amen so you've been looking for it all day but let me say this amen if you keep looking for it in a few moments we're going to close and go our separate ways and you'll say well I'm looking for church amen and you was sitting right in the middle of it and looking for it and missing it are you hearing me wake up church this is the Wednesday night service it's happening and a lot of guys say Brides Revival's coming Brides Revival is coming amen but let me say this wake up church amen pinch your spiritual conscience and awaken to the fact that the brid's Revival is happening come on church it's not just happening one church but I may get trouble but I'm going to preach it's not just happen in one man's Ministry amen this bride's Revival is a word born Revival then wherever the devil is put in subjection and the message has Liberty there's a Revival burning in The Bride of Jesus Christ and there ain't sickness stopping it there ain't devil stopping it because it didn't come from a man it come from the word don't you ever let some devil tell you this word reev this bride's Revival is a bunch of emotion or a bunch of fanaticism the bride's Revival is the word now do those things come with it they do but that's not the sign of Revival the sign of Revival is the word has been revealed and there's a people who's come to the revelation it belongs to me now watch what Paul writes to Timothy he says Timothy preach the word in other words Timothy whenever you get a pull pit preach the word whenever God opens a door Timothy just preach the word don't stand there and tell about your problems and tell about who don't like you and who's against you but no just stand there and preach the word Timothy be instant in season out of season reprove and rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doct amen preach that word preach means to Proclaim after the manner of a Herald it always with the suggestion of formality gravity and Authority which must be listened to and obeyed so Timothy has said stand there and declare the word and don't declare it half-heartedly don't declare it without your whole soul into it amen but declare it with such Authority that somebody will hear it and somebody will believe it and somebody will obey it amen preach the word Timothy publish it Proclaim it openly amen something which has been done now brother says we ministers we have orders from you Lord preach the word that's why they call us Full Gospel preachers it's because we preach the whole word the whole counsel of God now don't get mad at me but this message is not a buffet that's right the message of the hour is not a buffet it's not a take what you want and leave what you don't and well I don't like that no it's a seven course meal which means whatever is set in front of you has already been deboned there's no seeds in it it's pure word and if you'll feed on it it'll have the same effect upon you that it did upon those that were walking the road of emus when he stepped in the little room and begin to break the bread and their eyes come open and they seen that this is he that was dead but he's alive forever more and there's a bride on the earth tonight who has stepped in the little room and she's feeding on the bread of his presence and her eyes have come open that he's not in a tomb in Jerusalem he's not in a grave in Jeffersonville but he's right here tonight in the power of his resurrection performing his word manifesting his presence because he is here we must preach the whole word the whole counsel of God I'll just say this our preaching the message and believing of the message it must be free from Prejudice you say preach preacher why you saying that well Prejudice is it's an irrational attitude of hostility directed against an individual a group a race or their supposed characteristics now do you realize that the Pharisees and the Sadducees accuse Jesus of prejudice they said listen amen you got Prejudice remember said the reason they said that is because he didn't join up with their group he said but if you had come and said are you Pharisees are wrong and I'm a sadducee are you Sadducees are wrong and I'm a Pharisee then the Pharisee would have said I told you we were right but he didn't come to any of them come on Church the Sadducees was in a ditch and the Pharisees was in a ditch but he didn't come to either of them the prophet said he stood between them glory to God he stood between the Pharisees he stood between the Sadducees and he pulled the elected seed out of the confusion of saguy and confusion the Pharisees and he pulled a group to the middle of the road and they walked with the same Authority the same Authority that was on him was upon them who was in the middle of the road oh church amen I love this the Vindicated prophets preaching is free from Prejudice yes it's free from natural Prejudice it's free from spiritual Prejudice he was not here as some angry preacher trying to find somebody to H to preach at amen he was here declaring the thoughts of God to the church amen in the Rapture message he said you're not blind people you're sensible people and if I stood here and said those things for prejudice I say it because it's life I say it because I'm responsible to God for saying it and I must say it somebody say he must say it he must say it and my message all the time knowing backf there under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention brother Ronnie just takes us all the way back to the first pool and the second pool and said that was to catch the people's attention but called it one place he called it preparation years to catch the people's attention he said because I knew that the message would come so the third pull was the message of the hour to pull the bride to the balance of the word of God he says and here it is amen knowing the message would come 1965 Rapture he says and here it is so brother Robert is no longer on his way he has now taken his Liberty to declare what was coming is now here here it is see and them Seven Seals open them Mysteries amen showing those things of what's happened now when I say like this when the Revelation broke when the Revelation began to break amen a prophet could not hold back amen the Bible says in Matthew 13:11 amen Jesus said unto them it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given so that so Jesus could not hold back a prophet could can not hold back amen and neither as we the disciples can hold back on the Revelation that's been revealed to us he said and doing this I've come here for the purpose of teaching the last vows the last seven vows and the last seven trumpets and the last seven thunders of the Book of Revelation tying them together in this hour that we're now living to follow amen the opening of The Seven Seals the seven Church ages he said and by this it's not appointed to any certain person Creeds whatever it might be it's just as I see God's word and last Sunday we had a very fine outpouring of the spirit upon the word so brother Brandon was not preaching a bunch of a bunch of lectures amen but he would preach the word and because the spirit follows the word there would be an outpouring of spirit upon the word now come on I believe our services ought to build amen I believe our services ought to build from the bottom to the top every service but let me say this I don't think our worship amen should quiet when we get to the word I I don't think our shouts and amens amen ought to get ought to calm down when it comes to the word amen if there ought to be a time to shout it ought to be about the word if we're going to dance about something let's dance about the word if come on church amen listen and I'll say like this the message of the hour is the only place you can go with liberty and respond to God's word the way he called you to respond are you hearing me in the middle of the road there's liberty you know what brother Ron in the middle of the road amen there's liberty to say Amen if you're an amen or if you're a loud vocal amener there's liberty to stand up and just shout amen but if you're not a loud vocal amener and you're just one that sits there and receives the word amen there's liberty to sit there and receive the word if you're a shouter there's liberty to shout if you're a runner there's liberty to run if you're a dancer there's liberty to dance if you're a teacher of the fivefold ministry there's liberty to teach if you're a preacher there's liberty to preach if you're an evangelist there's liberty to evangelize if you're a pastor there's liberty to are you hearing me because it's the only place we're not here Amen to force everybody to worship a certain way under a certain direction under a certain atmosphere the only atmosphere that belongs in a message church is a creative atmosphere that has come from a creative word that is packing a creative power that will manifest the creation of God by the spoken word that's the only atmosphere that belongs in the message church is a created atmosphere yes sir not a man-made atmosphere a creative atmosphere see so in other words Jesus did not give his disciples amen private interpretation because private interpretation it does not loose it binds now youall know what the Bible says don't you this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation look at this word prophecy it's a discourse emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God glory to God so when you're preaching this message it's prophetic word so you're actually prophesying Revelation 10 you're actually prophesying the word again look at this word interpretation brother brother interpretation is a loosening it's to unloose something so when something is interpreted amen now watch if it's a private interpretation let's just go and say it it came from the serpent which was Eve's interpreter and that interpretation binds now you say brother Andrew you better be careful cuz brother so and so privately interpreted this to me and I'll tell you what it's it's a powerful interpretation well let's not put it on brother so and so's head let's put it back on The Interpreter of Eve which was Lucifer because he's the he's the father of all private interpretation he's the father of all false interpretation and it comes in to take out the liberty and to bring us under a certain direction under a certain Ministry come on church amen but true inspiration it does not come from Lucifer it comes from the spirit of Truth and when true interpretation begins to break out in the church it begins to move the church from bondage unto Victory from bondage unto Liberty now you know what the devil does not want the devil does not want the Great Commission of Mark 16 to be preached because that commission says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and says cast out Devils now you know what the prophet of God said he said the preaching of the word is the casting out of the devil when the word is preached the preaching of the word cast out the devil now why does the preach of the word cast out the devil to bring a liberty to the seat of God Amen to believe the word without private interpretation but true interpretation you know what sometimes you you see your pastor up here or your or your ministers up here laboring under the word you know what they're doing they're they're in spiritual warfare right because preaching a amen is spiritual warfare but I want to say this tonight we don't quit come on preachers we don't quit amen the Bible says it like this amen we have come to Mount Zion under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem Amen to an innumerable company of angels do you know why we do not quit amen because we're accompanied at the pull pit amen by the angels of God the prophet said in Junction of time he says Angels appear in the end time and if God did that for those little Junctions back fair then what will he do now when all hell is turned loose when all hell is turned loose all heaven will turn loose Angels appear signs and wonders on the earth now watch this the counterfeits AR Rising amen but God is proven which is right and which is wrong now when you start talking about counterfeits how can you not go back to the book of Timothy where Paul says amen as jambers and jambers wied Moses amen so do these men of corrupt mind reprobate concerning the truth amen watch amen but the Bible says their Folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was why would the prophet of God pick this up in spoken word Original Seed he said as they wisted Moses in the last days they would reappear those Spirits again so the spirits of Janice and jambers would reappear again what just before the liberation of the people he says hallelujah The Liberation time is here and they would exceed the very elect if it was possible he said but it's not possible because the word is the truth what did Paul tell Timothy to preach he said Timothy preach the word and if you'll preach this message it'll discern the false it'll discern the true and it'll bring a liberty to the seat of God to manifest the power of God in their lives I just believe it friends I believe in the ministry of angels I believe what Paul said he said there ministering spirits that have been sent from the presence of God to minister to those who are The Heirs of Salvation you say preacher what do you getting that probably God said may angels of God just hover as it was the audience amen day after day night after night until there will not be a sick or feeble person in our midst he said now if I fail Lord I don't mean to but I pray that you'll help me and help me to pray a prayer of faith for the sick and needy and help me to explain Thy Word in such a way that the people would believe on thy beloved Son and be healed and saved do you realize church that there's an angel in this Pulpit tonight helping me deliver this word I literally believe there's an angel here amen helping me preach the word I believe there's an angel that accompanies your pastor to the pullit and helps him preach the word but can I say this the same Angel that's helping the preacher preach it is the same Angels that's helping you to believe it the same angels that's helping them to deliver it and declare it is the same angels helping you to believe it remember said may your angels take their position in places positionally Out Among the People speaking to their hearts amen getting them to believe he says take away all unbelief another place now you feel real odd and strange but that's nothing in the world but the angel of the Lord amen moving on this side that's exactly what it is it's coming to me now see now it's not to hurt you it's to help you to get you to believe in what amen Jesus Christ amen that's the only thing it can do so the angel is not there to hurt you the Angels there to influence you to believe that Jesus Christ has been declared presently by the seventh angel he's here the pr of God goes on another place he said may the great Powers may the great angels that now listen this that rolled away the stone Amen on Easter morning may they stand present today to roll away every Stone of Doubt of fear every Discord take it from the people's heart amen the same angel that equipped Martha to roll away the stone amen from the from the tomb and let Lazarus come out is the same angel that a prophet was invited in the meeting to stand by the heart of the believer amen and roll away the stone of fear roll away the stone of Doubt roll away the stone of Discord that the people might be able to believe what's being declared amen can I move a step further further Paul says I've not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God that word shunned amen is to be unwilling to utter from Fear do you realize the prophet says that one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear one of the greatest chur curses on the church today is fear Everybody's scared to death here's what it is what's going to happen who what y'all know what I'm talking about come on the world's full of fear but let me say this natural fear come comes in a church and becomes a spiritual fear but the Bible tells us amen 365 times Be not Afraid fear not see Jesus himself stood and said fear not little flock it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom brother says what is the kingdom he says it's the word made Power so it's the father's Good Will to give you the word made Power in 2 Timothy 1:7 he said God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind you know what love is it's a powerful force there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust love has no fear love cast out fear and one of the greatest things I find among them is fear and what makes them fear is a lack of confidence a lack of confidence brings a spirit of fear he said if you if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but you know what I believe I I believe we have been called Amen to declare the message of the hour amen with liberty and rebuke the spirit of fear come on church God delivers by his word the Bible says you've not received the spirit of bondage again the fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB Our Father brother said that there he died and he sent back the Holy Spirit and he said to the church amen take this and follow me and fight with it he said the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible Amen to be backed up with the Holy Ghost amen that Christ died at Calvary to free his church I believe that Christ died at Calvary to liberate his church to free his church from superstitions and fear and doubt and trembling he lives today he rose from the grave I'm turning the corner here and closing because I believe that fear is real but let me say this to you fear is a spirit it's a spirit of intimidation and it's a spirit of manipulation it begins intimidation brother jonan then it moves into manipulation but watch this amen What Fear will do is it will intimidate you and then when it gets you all scared and all backed up then it begins to manipulate you now if you don't believe me just look at Co are you with me amen I believe Co was a real germ a real virus that come out of a lab come I believe it's real I'm not a conspirac okay I believe it was real but let me say this what I believe become more real was the fear of Co than the actual germ of Co because somebody got on the Airways and said there's a virus and it's coming to the country amen and people got so scared and they got so intimidated now watch amen it intimidated them and then it began to manipulate our ways of life amen instead of going to the office we stayed home instead of going to church we had to stream come on y'all know I'm telling the truth brother brother Robert we never went to Walmart and wore a three masks we are you with me amen we we we never left our groceries out on the front porch and sprayed them down with LOL before we brought them in amen but a but a spirit of fear which was real begin to intimidate and then begin to manipulate our ways of life but let me say this amen there's a spirit of fear in the last days and I tell you where it come from it come from the pits of hell and it's trying to manipulate this bride it's trying to intimidate the ministry it's trying to change the way we worship it's trying to change the way we preach the message it's trying to say we're going to get out of balance it's trying to say we can't believe this and we can't go here but let me say this that same spirit of fear is of the devil and there's a bride on the earth tonight who will not be intimidated you will not manipulate our preaching you will not manipulate our worship you will not manipulate our singing We Are The Freeborn Sons and Daughters of God and we have been liberated by the Oh Glory to God we have been liberated by the message of the hour by the seventh angel who declared the whole Council of God has brought up full Liberty to the church listen to this and I'm closing so don't fear fear is of the devil don't fear fear is of the devil are you with me now he said everything Jesus would say was fear not constantly fear not fear not see God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe so he sent an angel in the Pulpit to preach he sent an angel in the building to influence you to believe he does not want you to fear he wants you to believe so every one of you believe with one Accord every one of you can I close on this point in Matthew 14:22 the Bible says that straightway Jesus he constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea and it was tossed with waves for the wind was contrary I'm not going to slow down and preach it but I'm going to say this am I'm I'm I'm I'm bringing a to to you amen the wind was contrary if you go to Ephesians 4 the Bible says the time will come they're tossed about to and fro right and it says this amen they'll be carried about with every wind of Doctrine I preach the message one time Amen on there's a wind advisory in effect in the last days amen there's a wind advisory amen there's been a wind of this Doctrine and a wind of that Doctrine amen but watch verse 25 it was the fourth watch of the night when Jesus went unto them walking on the sea says it is I 1960 he says Revelation 17:15 says that the waters which thou sawest amen is sickness and multitude to the people when the disciples saw him amen walking on the sea they were troubled saying amen it is a spirit now watch and they cried out for fear brother Russell here they're in a storm the ship is rocking the winds are blowing and here comes Jesus amen walking on the water and they cry out for fear and say it's a spirit but straightway Jesus spake unto them and said be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid are you hearing me here comes Jesus walking on the water brother Robert said here's what happened he said they was down to nothing he said the ores were broke the boat was falling apart they needed help are you with me they needed help and you say brother Andrew how can you use that for today he said in Jehovah gyus 64 today people are something on the order like they was in the day days when the disciples Was Out on the Ocean a nightstorm came up there was nothing all hopes was gone and they seen him come walking on the water now their ship was water locked and the sails was broke and the ores was gone they were holding one another screaming and they looked out there and seen him come walking on the water and they were scared of him their only hope they were afraid of the only thing that could save them if that ain't a true picture today again brother Bram says it like this he says they looked at him and said it's spooky you know they said they cried out for fear now watch if you'll just look like they did when they cried out but then they heard a voice Oh Glory but then they heard a voice here they are in the middle of a storm they're in confusion fear is filling their hearts fear has filled the ship they don't know what to go amen the fear is intimidated them and it's now manipulating them but then all of a sudden brother Ron here come one walking on the water and they looked at him and they said he's spooky but then they heard a voice Oh Glory then they heard a voice I don't know about you amen but I remember when I was on the ship and everything was falling apart and I didn't know what would save me I didn't know what would give me some Liberty but then all of a sudden I heard a voice and it said fear not it is high Be not Afraid amen be of good courage amen I'm closing on this point right here when he rebukes the fear he replaced it with courage when he rebuked the fear he replaced the fear with courage and said do not be feared do not be fearful but be strong and be of good courage he said if you'll just watch The Word of Promise for this day you'll hear the same voice speaking through the word it is me come on even theight Fellowship amen I believe the same Lord Jesus has come in this building tonight and he's walking on the people he's walking in the church and he's saying it's me when a prophet began to declare the Revelation and it looked a little bit spooky you know why it looked spooky the way they were perceiving it now come on y'all know I'm tell them the truth amen tell somebody you believe a prophet and brother Russell they look like at you like you got three heads ooh that's spooky he said it's me I promised to do this in the last days fear not don't be scared put your trust in me the Son of God who he is believe it now let our musicians come tonight who he is believe it now who he is not was not will be who he is aren't you thankful for a prophet he said the only thing that can bring the church back together and take the Rapture they say it's fortune telling it's be elub when the very thing he said he would do as it was then so it is now but what did he say then he said I wish I had a little longer but I haven't but what did he say then be not afraid be of good cheer it is I are y'all ready for this Hallelujah are you ready for a prophet to break out Beyond Humanity in division and say to you what Jesus was saying to them he says fear not it is I Be not Afraid Be not Afraid now it is I be of good cheer be of good courage build yourself [Music] up and what did Paul say he said build yourself up to give you an inheritance among them which are Sanctified here Jesus is saying to you build yourself up I've got my eye on you I'm watching you I'm coming into the midst of the assembly into the midst of the Church of God and I'm coming in here to do what to take out the elected not to make another organization but a Rapture to go home he's coming to pull from both sides to the middle of the road where there's some Liberty to lay in the presence of the Sun and let all the greenness bake out of us and take us home he said today it's the same thing they're afraid to take a hold of the Holy Spirit they're afraid to believe God's message they're afraid to believe the Holy Spirit when they see it working among them but can I say this church the days of holding back and preaching or declaring or believing this message are over they're over proud of God said we need men of God who won't hold back he said what we need today is men we need gospel preachers and any preacher will stand in the pull pit and hold back on those things I got little respect of him being called a God are you hearing me listen as you stand to your feet with me tonight I believe he's come down can I ask you this question brother Warren when they was in the ship the wind was was blowing the cils were broke the ores were broke everything was falling apart and their lives are filling up with fear and Here Comes Jesus brother Greg Here Comes Jesus walking on the water and he sees him in that condition they look at him and they become afraid of him can I ask you this how did he rebuke the [Music] fear he declared his presence Hallelujah it is I Be not [Music] Afraid now I don't know about y'all but I know right now the world's falling apart and I want to say this I believe the hour has come that we ought to have some Believers in stability of what a prophet taught I'll just be honest with you brother Ron you you can clean it up when I leave but I'll just I'll just say it I was actually blown away by people who actually got moved by the as bear Revival around this message oh God's moving God's moving brother Andrew and I asked one brother I said brother I said how many sermons have been preached he said oh they're not preaching they're just singing you know it's a singing Revival come on brother man sit around the message for years you know why because of world events they're no longer happy just believing a prophet said he's here but let's just say what a prophet said he said you mean you could see and hear the word preached and see God turn around and say the word is the truth that's me that's me I'm standing here the very God that that's going to judge you and then hold back he said don't you do it you might cut yourself off forever Lord can I ask you tonight what fear has got you holding things back what fear has bound your faith to fully release it in this message now if you're a chicken you're fearful but if you're an eagle amen probably God said the very word that God said has your spirit said amen to it it's been fulfilled in your life then don't you hold back something well my church teach is different be careful Hulk Eagles believe there's no question in them how many Eagles have we got here tonight how many Eagles can raise your hands and say he rebuke the needless fear over my life oh brother Andrew they're talking about bombs and they're talking about they're talking about World War II and they're talking about this and talking about that but but guess what we're talking about we're talking about a seventh Angel's message that come in this age and declared the presence of Jesus Christ and said before one bomb ever hits this nation you'll be seated at the Merit supper of the Lamb Hallelujah you know what he done he rebuked the fear and now there's a courage there's a courage in this bride there's a strength in her how many can say Lord keep me in the middle of the road keep me walking where a prophet stayed keep me walking in Liberty it is I Be not Afraid won't you bow your hearts with us tonight ever head bowed ever eye closed maybe you're here tonight and you say brother Andrew I find spots in my life where I'm I'm shunning to declare there's areas I I'm shunning to declare the whole Council of God maybe there's a fear maybe there's a pressure maybe there's a this brother R said what will happen this what about that what about this maybe there's some fathers here tonight and husbands you look at your homes and you see that you need to declare this message maybe the devil of fashion or Leota is trying to pull your babies out in the world maybe psychology is coming in and trying to replace prayer time and the spirit of God brooding over a home and the devil saying it's going to fall apart this is going to happen but I believe right here tonight that Jesus Christ has come walking I believe he's come walking on the water brother said like this he said now Satan had him right where he wanted him he said where he wanted them was he wanted them without Christ now you all know what Christ is he's the anointed word he's the anointing the devil wants to get you somewhere by yourself apart from the anointed word But Here Come a prophet and said Jesus Christ is in your midst the anointed word build yourself up in it God bless you there sis God bless you God bless you brother brother Ander I need that courage tonight the fear has been rebuked over my life now give me that courage Lord to declare declare the purpose of God for my family declare the purpose of God for my

preparation for the coming Lord I believe you're here tonight I believe you're here preparing Hearts pulling them out of this ditch pulling them out of that ditch pulling them away from this voice pulling them away from this confusion father pulling a body to the middle of the road Lord as I read where your Prophet said it's me I'm coming in your midst I'm coming in there to pull from the assemblies to pull from the Oneness to pull from this denomination not to make another one and would say I've not come to build organizations I've come to build individuals to the stature of a perfect man powerhouses Lord I believe as your Prophet said behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice will open the door will come in I will s with him and he with me how beautiful Lord your Prophet interpreted that word s to us and said reveal that Lord you would come in these last days and he said you would reveal yourself to the same yesterday today and forever that Lord this message has invited you into our lives and a prophet's Declaration of your thoughts and your word has revealed your attitude to your people and now Lord there's a people not walking by emotions not
