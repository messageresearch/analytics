message he was our Sunday school and sister Holly she is here too his wife sister olly would you stand up so everybody can see you God bless you good to have you this here this morning uh brother Paul was our Sunday school teacher there in in Welden Saskatchewan up there uh in the Northland and uh I was thinking they had gotten on a plane in Saskatoon and flew they they are landed at 7:30 and I thought oh doing the time and the math and everything like that but no I think they came from Kansas City or something and so that's not so bad although it was 1:00 our time they got on the plane but they slept a little bit and everything but we're awfully glad that they're here I'm looking forward to it he is not a novice to the word of God I have confidence in in brother Paul he loves God and that's the main thing when you love God you keep his Commandments and you preach the gospel without fear or favor and we're let's just I'll turn it to brother Robert if you'll sing a song here and we'll have our our brother durksen to come at that time amen if you pull the song up amen behold Jehovah let's stand this morning the word Goes Forth May our yay be yay and may our voice say Amen this morning because he's worthy to be praised worthy to be adored let's sing the song of worship as we get ready to change the order of the service I'm excited to hear the God's word today he's been in our midst today water him with your worship with this song Let's sing this this morning behold Jehovah Seated on the throne [Music] father the well that overflows The God Who and his shall be forever

is Jesus the course let's look our hands and saying [Music] God blessing and honor and glory and [Music] Power [Music] blessing and honor and glory and [Music] power amen he is the amen and we say Amen to him the word it's good to be here this morning I'll let you have your seats here for a [Music] moment we were hoping to come and to hear brother Ron speak but things have kind of taken a turn um there are things that take place behind the scenes I don't know if you noticed it but the brother that came up here and pushed a button over that was the preach button and I think he hit the three-hour preach button I'm I I can't see you know when you get to the word there's no starting or stopping it's just it's Eternal and just Without End but it's good to be here sure appreciate brother Ron and and the family there but it's uh been a real privilege we had him up there or saw him up there in in Saskatoon here a little bit ago and enjoyed the fellowship there mentioned that I had been raised in the message and I'm thankful for that amen but I was not born again until after I was married to be a Christian is much more than knowing about the message agreeing with the message believing the truths of the message I mean I I would have fought for it I was convinced but I hadn't been born again my life hadn't been changed and when the reality struck me and my life was changed I had a birden on my heart for for the young people in the message ever since realizing that we can be raised in the message and we've got to realize we must be born again and uh so we're hoping and praying this morning that this will be something that will will help us all just draw a little bit closer to him what we're going to speak on this morning now again we we left early and we were praying that all the connections would work and and so forth and the rental cars and I've never had a trip go so smooth as far as just everything I got to the rental car and there was nobody there we just went right through the line I've never had that happen before brother Ron had he he told me yesterday he was kind of looking forward to a day yesterday that he'd just be able to relax because he's going to have a guest speaker here and now it was like well will he be here in time so he was studying for Plan B and so I know how that goes I've been on both sides of that situation but uh regardless the Lord had a purpose at all we're thankful for that now so he's prepared for next Sunday or or whenever the Lord would lead him maybe maybe we'll have him up our way and he can take the notes and bring it there but but God's in control amen what I want to speak on this morning and I'm going to move real fast because there's so much that you want to get across it's something that has changed my life in the last couple years and uh it continues to do that and I know that there will be some from our group that'll be listening in so we greet you this morning I they'll probably might not stream it I don't know what the time difference will will be whatever else but uh I I I believe this is something that we need to be reminded of back home again as I went through this and this was on my heart I realized I needed to be reminded again because you can have something that God reveals to you and if you aren't careful then all of a sudden it kind of you lose the focus it slips away and oh yes you need to be reminded and brought back amen and that's it's done that for me again as I've last few days going through this so my prayer is that this will be something that will change your lives things that I believe that are are crucial for the coming of the Lord things that he's left in our hands and you know it's always that way God has certain things that he's asked us to do and then he'll do all that he's promised amen I mean it's almost like and our part is so insignificant but it's crucial you know if if you're at the bottom of a 100 story building there's an elevator to go up okay well just push the button here and you get in and push floor 100 and then the elevator does it but you got to push the button that's right we have our part to do and so we we we we always want to do God's part and forget to do our part and that's kind of what we're going to be looking at a little bit this morning if you'll stand with me we're going to read from Ephesians 1 and from Genesis 1 and this first part is the foundation before we get to our text but you'll see I think in the end why this is crucial that we that we catch the context or the setting of of what we want to speak on it makes the the real uh I guess the the heart of the the message this morning to have a a purpose that we can hold on to I think with maybe a little bit more Assurance but Ephesians chapter 1 we want to read verses 9 and the first part of verse 10 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now that's our time that he might gather together in one all things in Christ now that's God's will that it's a mysterious Supernatural thing that God has purposed and it's for our time everything has been building building building for our time this is the time that God has purposed in himself I am going to gather together all things in myself in Christ Genesis chapter 1 veres 27 and the first part of 28 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it let's just ask the Lord to Quicken his word to us this morning Heavenly Father we we can read we can hear the word but only your Holy Spirit can make it live to Quicken it father and that's what we need and that's what we come asking because we know that is your will and desire for us Lord I pray that you'd help me to step aside Lord that somehow you could could use my lips or whatever to speak the words but then I pray each ear each heart would be anointed to receive it that we might be changed we leave this place and say that that God has come and and and done something in my life his word has changed me that's my prayer this morning even though I might be delivering the message Lord I want to be changed by Your Word by your spirit Quicken these things to us now in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated now I want you to to realize now when it says God created man and he created man he he didn't just create Adam he created Mankind we were created back then and then he brought forth the first man and he put him here on Earth but he was a spirit man because he was in the image of God but if you'll notice this commission was given when Adam was yet that one single spirit being so this commission is not just the the the natural commission to multiply replenish the Earth and and populate it with with human beings In the Flesh it is a spiritual commission brother R says this in marriage and divorce he says that's why he said to Adam before sex was ever introduced multiply to replenish the earth when he was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself it shows that the bride's got to come from the word by spiritual multiplications replenishing the Earth so we're going to see that this commission that God gave there at the beginning it is an eternal commission that means it's still his commission today that's right we are still under that commission and it's a spiritual commission and the bride has to come forth by that spiritual commission so at that time we know that then God then put Adam into flesh and then he separated him into two physical beings that was all for his purpose of of part of this Commission because it did include uh bringing forth the the physical Tabernacles that the Spiritual Beings that were created would would dwell in now they were to come forth by a spoken word at that at that original spot so at this point there are two beings that are are in in existence now to fulfill God's commission but they have not been given any details of how this is all going to unfold God likes to do it that way when he gave Abraham the the commission he says follow me to a place I'll lead you he didn't tell him where it was he went and then he says okay uh in ER and his father passed away and then he went on and he came to the Palestine the pro says now this is the land he gave him more information he ran to Egypt and then came back because of circumstances he came back and then he gave he kept giving more he never gave all the details at the beginning God does that I think he's looking to see and to prove us if we can be tested that we'll just simply take him at his word trust him and act on and do what he wants us to do so Adam and Eve were they knew they were under the commission to be fruitful to multiply to replenish the Earth to subdue it they didn't know how they needed to just be patient and wait until God brought the details but in the meantime Satan comes along and he counterfeits something he brings a false fulfillment of God's word so spoken word's original seene she received Satan's lie what did she bring forth by doing it Satan said you know this is glorious this is a wonderful thing do you know you were made for that now think of that for a moment even though Eve was not originally to bring forth children in a sexual way but it was going to be a spoken word somehow she was made with that capability it was there amen there's another thought you know that that here we are we have we have in us our blood if we cut our our our hand our blood will clot well God made man in the physical sense with that capability even though they had nothing to fear they didn't need it at that time but brother BR says God knew they would need it one day that they would be cut and they would need that capability so God has made us with with things that we might not even understand why and I believe there's things I'm getting into another thought here but there are things in our in our spiritual walk with the holy spirit that he is given us and created us that we don't even understand why we not might not even be aware of it but it's for a purpose and there will be a time when it will be necessary Hallelujah so at any rate he Satan says you were made for that and that was true he says why you actually made for this purpose so now she could bring forth life but it was not the spiritual commission that she could fulfill that spiritual commission be fruitful multiply that was not the physical bodies that was the tabernacle for that spiritual fulfillment to dwell in so Shake could bring forth the physical the natural but only God could bring that fulfillment of that commission so Satan says through this Union you can fulfill God's commission he goes on he says now if God said multiply to his bride to Adam's bride and replenish multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's commission and she would have done it when God give a commission which cannot perish God's word is eternal it cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's Eternal purpose well then it's still his purpose today to carry it out you cannot die God's not going to require something of us that is going to cause us to to die to be separated from God he says because it's his word you have to live and if that child would have been brought forthright there' have been no death but she couldn't wait so she could bring forth the flesh bodies but she could not accomplish the real replenishing of the earth bringing those those mankind the the the spirit beings that were a part of God in this in his Spirit she could not bring them forth she could not place them in that that body that was that was coming from her herself and so forth so as we go on here we're going to see that God has a commission he has a union that he has purposed and Satan always comes by behind him and brings a false counterfeit to it and that always brings death and Division and separation amen so in the message oness he says what did he tell Adam and Eve go on and multiply replenish the Earth scattered the human race all over the Earth so he could deal with them individually that's interesting till he could bring them back together says look you need to be one but I've got to do it so for now I'm going to separate you scatter you through all the years and I'm going to deal with you individually he took Cain and and sent him away and different things I'm going to bring you together but I've got to do it and until then I need to have you separated so I can deal with you each one individually dealing with the people individuals each person but they didn't want it that so what happened next of course we know that the first false Union was there between the serpent and and and Eve so further on the same message is a false Union brought judgment on the earth to Eve and Adam in Eden and a false Union brought the floods of God's judgment on the earth because that the daughters of Cain flirted with the sons of God and they fell for it and United together again there you are false Union so he says look I I am scattering you I'll bring you together again so what did Satan do well look and he brings the daughters of man with the sons of God and he brings a false Union a mixing and that brought judgment again we're going to see this pattern over and over and over God's commission his purpose his Union and Satan comes in with something that sounds so real uh reasonable sounds so right but it's just a little bit off and it brings death amen so now we can come to the time of Noah after the Judgment comes and and and Noah's the flood and so forth and so in the future home he says after he come out of the flood just like it was with Adam before after he come upon the new Earth he said multiply and replenish your there's God's Eternal commission it was given to no okay this is this is a brand new start to the earth now this commission has to be fulfilled go forth and replenish the Earth notice was to be fruitful replenish the Earth as adamant the first so then we come in and again in in in in the message Oneness he says now after that after the death of Noah and that spiritual family of Noah first thing you know the children of men begin to look at one another what did they do they said now we're not infidels we all believe in God so they got a fellow by a leader some great Archbishop by the name of nimrod and they built a tower to bring Unity oh yeah but it was a forced Unity he conquered the Ley he brought them under his carnal leadership and his carnal Authority they wasn't infidels they believed there was a heaven they believed there was a hell they believed in judgments but the children of God were the the daughters of men again and they made them themselves a union falsely built a great big Cathedral big organization all the other places was to Babel was to pay tribute to it so they did not have what was needed once again for the true Unity that God had purposed they could bring a Unity yes and and and they were unified to where they could build this great building God came down and he says we we got to separate them because because they're unified they could do almost anything and so what did he do he separated them again like he did after the Garden of Eden by changing their language where they couldn't understand one another and so they scattered through all the Earth again but once again we have uh it sounded reasonable every time and it had an element of truth to it amen that's the way Satan does it always he will he came to Eve quoting did not God say thus and US yes but he also said oh no no no no God's a good God you know just and so he'll he'll twist and pervert it always is the approach that Satan take takes so now we could go through but I want to jump ahead to pentec cost because this is the time now that God had said I'm I'm I'm I'm separating you scattering you until I can bring you together again this was the time he was pointing to this was where the real Unity of God was going to be brought forth was when he gave his own Spirit there at Pentecost that's what unifies US amen it's his spirit that unifies us and that's our thought this morning the unity of the spirit thank you Lord so in Father the hour has come he says the time had come for Joel's prophecy to be fulfilled the time had come for Jesus to pour out his spirit for with stammering t lips in other tongues will I speak to this people that's Joel's prophecy this is the rest that should come from the presence of the Lord no matter if they never spoke since Babylon their languages had been scattered and there were some that they couldn't understand one another and maybe they had never been able to communicate since Babylon but it was the time had come for God to unite the Nations together and band together one heart and one Accord not under a man like Nimrod not under a system like the Babylonian religion but this was God's Unity I will place my spirit in them and they will be one because they are born of The Same Spirit they will be all part of the same family there's the unity that God was was had had planned from before the foundation of world everything was working towards that but Satan kept interjecting himself and twisting things and just a little bit off to to bring a false Union and every time it it it brought death and Division and separation from God now when he came there at the time of Pentecost Mark 16:15 says he said to them go into all the world preach the gospel to every commission there's the commission again be fruitful mul remember it was a spiritual commission to bring forth the spiritual Sons and Daughters of God the T Tabernacles are just kind of incidental what's really important God created Man In His Image mankind they were male and female so we have a spiritual birth that needs to take place and that commission is still upon us go into all the world and preach the gospel and it doesn't mean just preach like what I'm doing here to this morning it is with the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit it is a new birth that takes people that have been born in the message agree with the message and it changes them they pass from death and life and they're never the same after thatl that's the same commission to Adam to Noah all the way here to the day of Pentecost the commission continues on to this day in 2023 now we know kind of skipping ah head here a little bit um brother B says in Fellowship God made one preparation for man to be restored back to that Fellowship one preparation he says blood was the way back to fellowship no other way no Organization no strong leader the blood of Christ was the only way back he says this is God's way it was God's way it will always be the right thing to Fellowship through the blood reconciliation bringing the believer back into contact with his maker we've tried to educate people to it it'll never work we've tried to draw denominational barriers and say because you go to this church or this see what's the whole point of that we're trying to build a Unity because everybody body here believes this certain thing a certain way so we have Unity step back a little bit and say yeah you've got division because you've drawn a circle around our little group and all the others out in God's economy are not part of us see that's a reasonable thing to our carinal mind but it's not God's plan or provision that's right so now when he told him he says I want you to to go and Terry in Jerusalem you you shall be Witnesses unto me yes sir but you need to T in Jerusalem until you be filled or indued with power so again how is this going to happen they didn't know just like they had given the commission Adam and Eve didn't give them details but they needed to be patient to wait until God did what he was going to do and told them what they needed to know and so they did this they went to the upper room and now they are just simply waiting getting ready prepared for it because it takes the power of the Holy Ghost to be able to fulfill the commission amen because it's a spiritual commission bringing forth Spiritual Beings so God's Unity is a Unity of the spirit so they knew what was come to pass but they couldn't do it of themselves they couldn't make it come to pass it needed God to do it that's and that's why he gave his holy spirit in the message conferences he says notice on the day of Pentecost what did God do knew he took that big Pillar of Fire and divided it that was himself tongues of fire fork tongues clothing tongues came down Fork tongues and set upon each one oh listen to this he says we ought to be ashamed to let our organizations divide us when God divided himself Among Us that we might be one amen isn't that a statement Hallelujah shame on us that we do and and I'm preaching myself this is how my life changed two years ago all of a I realized God that's me I'm guilty of this and so how dare we divide when God divided himself so he could give each one of us a portion of himself so that we would be one I like that amen he says God divided himself we're never divided one another because we're parts of God amen if that hits home we could just dismiss the service and all is well if that really sinks in deep that's a life-changing reality isn't it we're never divided because we're parts of God and we all see everything exactly the same and no no no no no no I'm going to jump way ahead we have four children we had three two years apart and then we were done for 11 years we thought and surprised God had a real blessing for us and we had number four now let's fast forward about three years this little guy sure doesn't sound like these three I mean you can talk to these about this and this and this and have a conversation makes sense but this one pH he was every bit of durksen as those he just wasn't as mature yet but he was on the road he was growing he was maturing and every one of us if we've been born of the spirit the Holy Spirit has been given us to lead us into all truth and we are at different stages of our journey different amounts of Revelation and so we look that well he doesn't have the Revelation that I do he might be further up the road we just don't even realize that or it might be vice versa then we need to have Grace R but when we recognize we are of the same father The Same Spirit we have a unity and it's not measured by our maturity or our Revelation it's measured by our Birth by that holy spirit thank you Lord now in Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever he says now I want you to think of this this Upper Room experience waiting there for 10 days he says I think the 10 days that they were waiting for the original and first outpouring of the Holy Spirit how that must have been a unifying time so they all went into the upper room because they needed to be unified they had to be of one heart and one Accord okay it must have been a unifying time of the people all in one heart and one Accord and every time that that man gets together like that since then the holy spirit always meets with them I like that every time if we've come here together in one heart one Accord the holy spirit will meet with us always but that's what was necessary that first time when he first ided himself and filled the different ones there the 120 with himself parts of himself the licks of fire the Holy Ghost but they had to get into one heart and one Accord they had there had to be a unifying in that manner that was their part that's right then God could fill them with the real unifying power which was him so now after Pentecost what does Satan do he brings a false Unity the nickan spirit the power and demonstration of the Gospel became a formal religion the commission was not being carried out anymore oh they were going through the motions everything looked good just like the children of Israel when they would they would bring their sacrifice on the feast days when they were commissioned they were doing exactly what but their heart wasn't into it right it was just a routine it was a tradition it was carnal and it became a stench in God's nose so this is the the first early church there they were do you realize brother man says they had everything it was perfect why didn't God just take his bride home because you and I weren't brought forth yet thank you Lord the commission hadn't been fulfilled throughout all the ages there was the elect of God that had to come forth right in their age and their time in our age and our time and so all of this had to take place and so while this has been going on Satan has been working behind the scenes to bring a false Unity like always saying that this is how you fulfill God's purpose this is the way to to bring this into reality but it's a lie the nickan spirit once again brought forth a forced religion the nickan religion or uh spirit there was a continuation of the Babylon religion from Nimrod Babylon that's that organized religion it's that for brother says that is a forced religion you got to believe it this way you got to do this or else and then they cut you off and in during the Dark Ages it was even a physical where they 68 million Martyrs because they didn't believe the way that that the Catholic Church said you must believe that's right see they were trying to bring a Unity a purity let's get rid of all the heresy do you believe this I kid fine they're gone do you believe this okay now they're part of us that's right that was the unity they were trying to build amen and it was reasonable to them but that was Satan reasoning wasn't it that's right so that's all history so what about today where are we at what's going on today what are we challenged with how does Satan work against us and here's where it really hit home and this is where it really changed my life changed the focus of our church and is continuing to do that here's kind of where it starts he says in missionary talk from Middletown he says where we've made a fatal mistake is not following this commission go into all the world and preach the gospel or demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost to every nation and every people what have we done we've went and made schools organize people together make them well they don't believe just like we do don't associate with them them don't go around their churches Lord I've done that oh we'll be friendly God bless you brother God bless you but but he doesn't believe like I do so I'll be friendly I'll smile and shake his hand but I really don't want to fellowship with him I said Lord that's what I've been doing I had a circle and those that didn't see just my way but you know the funny thing is if I had gone back to where I was 10 years ago I was outside of that Circle where I was 10 years further amen because I've been LED along more Revelation the Holy Spirit leading to more truth so if I draw the line where I'm at today where am I going to be two years five years by God's grace moving forward amen so a fatal mistake what we've done they don't believe just like we do don't associate with them don't go around their churches he says this there's many quotes like this here's another one for him will I accept he says the only thing that's holding off the coming of our Lord Jesus for his church and setting of his kingdom is the differences between the Full Gospel people the only thing as long as one say I belong to this I belong to that I received this I did that and don't recognize the brother as your brother I believe that's one of the hindrances we have now one of the hindrances of not receiving Jesus Christ's coming amen and I thought Lord this isn't just message this is this is me I'm guilty of this amen God have mercy forgive me and I made that right with our people we had it at camp and I made it right there in front of people from many churches I have called many ministers and said brother forgive me I have not been a real Christian the way brother Brandon said I have I have tried to build my own little unity and I'm wrong and I'm part of what's holding off the coming of the Lord and you know what I found the fellowship that we have and it's not just where we can tolerate one another it's fervent love for one another big difference big difference brother BR brother Billy says you could never tell brother bram's enemies from his friends by the way he treated them in questions and answers he says this when God's people begins to gather back together and that's what I believe is happening in my life and in others that I know yes we're beginning to gather back together it's it's something is stirring something is taking place the coming of the Lord is close look at the news look at the conditions in the world I mean everybody knows something's fixing to happen and it could be tomorrow amen when God's people begins to gather back together there's Unity there's power and whenever God's people gets together completely I believe the resurrection will take place then there will be a rapturing time when the Holy Spirit begins to gather it up so there's a Unity once again this is God's Commission in the fullness of times that he wants to gather all together in Christ and when we truly get to that place that's when the Resurrection The Rapture is going to take place so there's something that he's they had to they had to be in the upper room to get into one Accord one heart one Accord so he could give his spirit and there's something he's waiting for here that we have a minor part but a crucial part so that he can do what he's promised to do but I haven't been faithful probably most of us haven't been faithful if we really are honest with ourselves not to the extent that we could or should amen thirsting for life he says when I can see all the different Full Gospel people with one heart and one Accord standing together as one big army it'll bring Jesus Christ to the Earth just as certain as I'm standing here one heart and one Accord see that's why you got to believe like me you see the quick detour to Satan takes us to that's right yes we need to be one yes I can see that and I'm so thankful for the Revelation God's given me now if you could just Embrace that will have see that's that's the way he works and it seems so reasonable to us amen let's go back to the upper room I think that we think of it as 120 people they were all fishermen that had been kind of together do you know who those 120 were made up of brother B says lamb and the dove he says there was 120 people up there Pharisees Sadducees and everything there were some from the Pharisee background that were following Jesus but they had their Pharisee Doctrine and there were some that came from the sadducee denomination following Jesus but they had their sadducee Doctrine and those two doctrines were totally opposite you remember later on Paul where he's called before the Sanhedrin what does he do he pits the Sadducees and the Pharisees against each other because the Sadducees don't believe in spirit they don't believe in angels they don't believe in the resurrection and it's very important to the Pharisees so he says now the reason these guys over here against me is because I believe this and they don't and now oh so now there on Paul's side I mean there was no friendliness there was no Unity between Pharisees and Sadducees and they were in the upper room so you know what happened all these years and years and years of this doctrinal differences they were able to that resolved in those 10 days thank you Lord not a chance you think they resolved those generations of differences but you know what they did they said you know what these things don't matter what I believe here doesn't matter what you believe there doesn't matter we're here because Christ has commissioned us to come and wait till we're endued with power and they join together with that focus and God came down gave him the Holy Spirit now the holy spirit's there to lead them both to all truth and little by little by little they would have they would have realized the error of their understandings their their their Revelations and so forth they would have been led to all truth they did not do that in a carnal human way they were not resolving these things in that upper room they were waiting for God to send the power to accomplish what needed to be done but there was a one heart one Accord that they could come into that was their part the other part was God's part and we're going to get into Ephesians 4 in just a moment and we're going to see the two different unities they put aside all the things that they had made circles and divisions over I believe this and they don't so here's our Circle they're out because they don't see this and this is important this is crucial do you think it's important to believe in the resurrection you think it's important to believe in in in spirit beings and angels of course well then of course those sag they're out about there was some of them in the upper room there was something a seed in their heart God was calling amen something that as we look back with hindsight something real but where they were at right now they were in this place of division each one standing for what they were convinced was the truth with good motives and intentions but they had drawn a circle that brought Division and so what they had to do is they say you know what these things aren't important let's just put them aside I'm not going to make this something that we're here together God has spoken to you the Lord Jesus spoke to you he spoke to me he gave us this commission to come here we he he's called us to be Witnesses in Jerusalem and then throughout the whole Earth but he said we need to T here and wait till we're endued with power I don't know how he's going to do I don't know what's going to come Eve didn't know what was going to come she should have just waited they did wait and God came down and filled them with the holy ghost in a way that they probably never imagined amen and now the unity that had been separated there at the Babylon with the with the separation of the of the languages now all these different ones that couldn't understand their languages Peter spoke and they all heard in their language that's the unity of God you don't need the Rosetta Stone and a bunch of interpreters to accomplish that God has a way when he brings a Unity it's real it's Supernatural and it's what is necessary to get us out of here now we want to go to Ephesians 4 this is my text and it won't be as long as the background but I wanted you to see this pattern of what's going on that God has a commission he has a purpose he's going to bring bring the unity that is needed that's his M mystery of his will and Satan always comes in and counterfeits it and and and and makes it sound so reasonable and and realistic and sounds spiritual but it isn't because it's contrary to God's word with that as a background let's look now as Ephesians 4 here's where we come to the unity of the spirit Ephesians 4: 1 to8 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called what's a vocation that's your calling in life you might be a farmer you might be a lawyer you might be a doctor that's your vocation that's what your life is all about in the natural it's how you make your living whatever else you've got a vocation as Christians there is something that we've been called to we have a vocation a purpose why we're here so he says I beseech you walk worthy of this vocation that God has called you to walk worthy oh my yes you got to go get four degrees in college and this no how how can we walk worthy of of this great vocation that God's called us with all loneliness and meekness amen with longsuffering if everybody was just like me there'd be no suffering it's when we run into people that aren't just like us we got to have patience with them we got to be longsuffering for he says forbearing one another in in love amen and here's the key endeavoring and endeavoring means it takes effort it takes choices takes action endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace if I could put it this way we have been given a Unity because we've been born of The Same Spirit we have a un so we are to keep we aren't to create we not to make the UN he says no keep the unity of the spirit I have given you a Unity you're all born of one Spirit I've given you a Unity Endeavor to keep that with all loneliness and meekness longsuffering forbearing one another in love now I've used we need to maintain that Unity of the spirit if I can use those terms brother Ron have you maintained your uh 200ft yacht lately you haven't well he doesn't have one he can't maintain what he doesn't have yeah you notice I said 200 foot yacht I didn't know about 100 foot or where you know I I had to be careful I didn't [Laughter] know we can only maintain what is ours if we got a car you better maintain it if you don't that engine's going to blow you can get by for a while but it's the the Day of Reckoning will come there will be a price to pay so we need to maintain we need to keep the unity spirit because he gave it to us we have it it's ours right now that's why we've gathered together like this we have a Unity of the spirit we've been born of that same Spirit do we all see eye to eye of course not my wife hasn't quite attained where I'm at yet either no she's probably ahead of me in in many ways but we are one in marriage but also also is Children of the Lord thank endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit I want us to to Really catch that we have a Unity of the spirit we are one in that Spirit if we've been born again not just raised in the message not just agreeing with the message not just knowing intellectually that yes brother R is a prophet I believe every word and and Jesus the son of God and yes we believe that but have you been born again have you TR he died to yourself and repented of your sins with a Godly sorrow and conviction and a full surrender a full commitment a full repentance then God will fill you and seal you with the Holy Ghost he will he'll never fail to keep his word but we just come partway well that's fine it's not that you haven't come anyway but just keep on until you reach that place of full commitment then you watch God will meet you there so endeavoring to keep the unity of spirit that's what we miss is that we have that yes and we don't value it we don't recognize it to the extent that we ought to amen we don't realize what God is really we get so busy and preoccupied and distracted and the Devil comes in injects this and injects this and we focus on this and we yes but but I have a Unity that God gave me and that's my vocation which I've been called so he says there's one body one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he would he ascended on high to make the atonement for us but that's another subject he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men that's what our gifts are for in the body of Christ now there are five office gifts and there are nine spiritual gifts and every member of the body has at least one gift and we need to ask God lord use me where and how you desire to use me for the purpose of your body Amen to please you father because we've been commissioned now to finish his work I don't have those quotes with me right now but but it's a wonderful reality the church is to finish the high priest work of Jesus Christ and even today the devil trying to take that that away don't need preachers anymore don't need this anymore there's no place for this that's not what the word says so now we come to Ephesians 4:11 these gifts that he gave un man and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints and we make a big mistake I think lot of time it isn't the perfecting oh I now I'm perfect I'll never have another thought again that's wrong I just no it's the completing bringing it to its completeness what we've been ordained to be those five offices can't perfect only the blood of Christ and the grace of God can perfect Us in the the way that we we use the English word perfecting but you go and look what the meaning of it is in the Greek it's for the completing of the Saints we're down here God has commissioned us to be something and so we're here to help to to bring everyone to what God has commissioned us to be amen the occasion where we've been called to so he says for the perfecting of the Saints the completing of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying for the building up of the body of Christ till in other words this is not something that we have right then we have the unity of the spirit says till we all come in the unity of the faith there's a Unity of the spirit which we have the moment we're born again we are now in that Unity of the spirit but then there's a process that is underway and he's that's what the body of Christ is all about is a part of that process till we come to the unity of the faith the unity of faith is a work in progress It's the goal or purpose of our commission but once again the commission can only be accomplished by God Amen I can't bring a Unity of the faith Eve couldn't bring forth a spiritual seed of God into a body she could bring forth the body but she couldn't do the spiritual part we can keep in one Accord in one heart because that just means longsuffering and humility and meekness and dying to ourself and forbearing one another recognizing why we are are are are one in Christ but you and I even though I'm preaching I can't bring a Unity of the faith God has to do that he'll use maybe the words that I speak but then the Holy Spirit has to Quicken it to each one we can read it in the Bible still takes the Holy Spirit to Quicken to it we can listen to a tape but we still need the Holy Spirit to Quicken it to each one of us and that is a process okay so the unity of Faith it's the goal or the purpose of the commission to be multiplied and be fruitful to multiply to replenish the Earth that was the goal of the commission but only God could correctly bring it to that fullness that completion the commission gave them there at Pentecost only God could bring it to the place that it needed to be they could do their part they could gather in the upper room they could put aside all these things that divided them say those don't matter and then God could bring his unity and if we can do our part of endeavoring to maintain the unity of spirit God will do his part to bring a Unity of the faith he has to do that now this is a quote that I found years ago and it struck me but I never saw really how it fit into the picture that piece of puzzle God's provided a way to Fellowship he says help us Lord to have Unity of the spirit until Unity of the faith is brought forth and when we shall see him face to face then we'll see eye to ey and we're convinced that we can see eye to eye if you just see it my way no no and then I found one was even stronger this comes from message to the ly in church fitting name he says talking about Jesus he longs to get in to have Fellowship in his people he's knocking at the door come into communion to bring you something good but the church and the people keeps him away to coming down because you say well that group don't believe just like I do what difference does that make that has nothing to do with it now I'm going to bring a balance to this we are are Christians born again in the same family a bunch of pilgrims will never see eye to eye until we see him face to face okay never well then why am I struggling so hard to bring a Unity of Faith If You Could See It My Way it isn't going to happen amen until we see him face to face and that's when the resurrection's taking place and there we are our bodies are changed and all whatever's all going to take place there when we see him I die that's when we'll see we'll see I die when we see him face to face Hallelujah that's when the fullness is going to come and the unity of faith will be brought forth but we have a Unity of spirit now we have since Christ died in in day of Pentecost sent his Spirit maintain that endeavor to maintain that it's not something that just happens by itself it takes effort it takes death to our will and our reason and our pride and our carnality it we'll never see eye to eye until we see him face to face and be changed and made like unto his own glorious body so this is God's plan that's what's Satan doing he has a false Unity thirsting for life he says can you see now why I'm standing for the unity of every church every F gospel chur every believer we ought to be one heart one mind and one Accord no matter how much we different in the scriptures that might be one might see this that way or that has nothing to do with it but in principle we ought to stand one Great Mighty Army of God marching on ever present water he says that's exactly what Pentecost did when it began to organize it began to break up Fellowship saying well now we won't associate if this guy believes that go ahead stay with him till he comes to the word of Truth the the knowledge of truth whatever it is let it go anyhow just go on be as brothers amen oh but we had to organized say well because you're not Oneness because you're not Tess or threeness or like this we won't have no fellowship with you and see these are things that are stepping on my toes hard god brother BR says until you're honest with yourself he says you'll never be honest with God he also said if we can't be honest with our brothers we'll never be honest with God I said Lord that is me that is me I'm guilty woe is me like Isaiah said I'm a man of unclean limps I God forgive me amen make this Revelation heartfelt may it intensify every day may may I walk worthy of the occasion which you've called me to Lord and that's why I say it has changed my life oh I I'm he's still working on me and that's why I say I think it's time we need to bring this back to our church because I I went through this thought you know what we're starting to slip back into some of these attitudes some of these things and oh not intentionally but the devil's a wiy adversary and our carnal reasoning and and and intellect and everything else is a good Target that he can work on and we need to be on guard the message where I think Pentecost failed he says the reason the church is not progressing brother he says you're fussing about your organization your denominations whether you're this that or the other whether you're Oneness Tess threeness or Fess whether you've been baptized Face Forward face backwards all kinds of things and fussing and drawing barriers and things that's the reason the church is not going on if you'd ever break down your walls let this one be this and that one be that whatever you are that doesn't matter but when you can put your hands in your brother's hands and call him your brother and we're working for one cause that's the kingdom of God if it ever gets to places I couldn't put my arm around any brother that's working for the the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm backslid I'd be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that I had Envy in my heart against any brother no matter who he is that's trying to reach the go preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life if we disagree a million miles upon theology a million miles not just one little thing here and one little thing here because that's usually enough to kind of bring a division at least that's been my experience amen if we disagree a million if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and it's my sister and we've draw those lines and if you can't love your brother who you have seen how can you love God who you can't have never seen amen so I believe that that the devil has come in and he has used our understandings of doctrines and truths and they might be absolutely correct it does matter what we believe I want to make it very clear I am not saying oh it doesn't matter what you believe just let all those things go we can okay let's baptize in the name of the father son holy yes because that way we have Unity see if the devil can't get you in this ditch he'll get you over the other ditch we must stand with what God has revealed to us but that's not the basis of our Unity you could have this little three-year-old that's been born again and he's just coming along and say well because you're not over here you're out of the picture just have Grace forbearing one another in love that's right Doctrine is important hold what God has shown you walk in the light but always with that comma button out Lord I believe this I see it in the word you you've made it real to me but I know that I don't have any cu the moment we put a period we're done we have succumbed now we have our own Tower of Babble we have our own false Unity this is it everyone gather around we've got it it's a com about and say Lord I I'll walk in this light as long I mean there have been people tell me I need to do this in my church I need to do that in my church I'm saying I don't see it I'm I'm walking in the light that I do see if I'm missing something pray for me I've got to see it in the word but for right now my combo button out and I've told him look if I find something I've missed and what we're talking about here is something I've missed and I've acted on it I've made things right I've I've I've apologized I've called all around the country and talked to different ones saying forgive me brother I have been wrong with good intentions I thought I was fulfilling the the the Commandments of the Lord for his kingdom standing as a Believer a champion of the faith and Satan is using that to divide and separate and bring death amen but my my commitment is Lord I've got the com about out if you can show me something and it's got to be in your word it's going to be in the Bible it's going to be in the message it's going to fit your pattern all says oh Lord I never saw it that way oh thank you let me just throw throw something out here to maybe help make a quick Point everything in God's word is a pattern so everything has to fit the pattern if you run into something doesn't fit the pattern you need to back Who whoo there's something I'm not missing I'm not getting right I'm missing something because God's word fits perfectly does not contradict itself that's right so I give you a a pattern here how many mathematicians do we have out there yeah you know better you've had teachers ask you and it's a trick question you're going to get set up but I'm just give you a simple pattern three five 7 what's next uh-uh that is a pattern but it's not the pattern I was thinking of you were thinking odd numbers and that would fit the pattern I'm thinking prime numbers 3 5 7 11 because nine is not a prime number 13 17 19 a prime number is a number can only be multiplied by itself three is 3 * 1 5 is 5 * 1 you can't do it any other way nine is 9 * 1 and 3 * 3 it's not a prime number okay I'm not here for the math but I just I didn't want to leave you holding I didn't want to have them lost for the next week what in the world's going on and you'll notice I asked you I didn't ask brother Ron back here because I suspected he would would would maybe have troubles with that I didn't know I didn't want to risk our friendship but you you get the point you were all positive that you had the pattern figured out and so God's word going to fit the pattern that I see and all of a sudden you run into something that that doesn't fit the pattern what's going on and devil say well just set it aside don't worry about it no no no no it's all got to fit together the moment I run into something it doesn't fit the way I presumed God had had meant it I step back say Lord I thought I had the pattern but something doesn't fit here Matthew 28:19 Jesus everybody heard of Jesus pretty important person the fullness of the god in him Jesus said baptize the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and Peter who was just a fisherman couldn't sign his own name he said baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I've heard people say you know what I'm going to take what Jesus said I don't know what Peter was they don't realize there's a pattern they fit together so they're willing to pick and choose and that's what happens is we get into something and say okay now what am I going to do I'm going to pick this or I'm going to pick that you need to step back and wait and say God somehow these fit together I can't choose against any of your word but I need your Revelation and I'm just going to wait till you give it to me in the meantime I'm not going to go build some big Doctrine or or following or an ism over this understanding that understanding I'm just going to be humble forbearing longsuffering and realize my well this brother sees it that way it might be the truth this brother sees it that way it might be the truth but Lord you got to Quicken it to me in the meantime they're my brothers amen so we understand that we must have Doctrine and God is quickening his word to us but that is not the basis of our Unity right I I hope that comes clear because the devil will try to say well see brother Paul was saying it doesn't really matter what we believe just believe whatever you want not at all but be willing you real I've stayed on this and I believe this and all of a sudden oh my goodness there's more to what I saw well then Lord and if I have to make I've told the people of the church if I have to come back and say Brothers I stood on this with all I knew but there's more to it and I was just a little bit off Target because now the word says this forgive me for that but here's but I've got to be able to show it in the word amen I want the truth because they receive not the love of the truth God turned them over to strong delusions not because they didn't receive the truth but they didn't have love I've got to love a truth if you love the truth then you also love correction because if what you're seeing is not the truth you got to be corrected so you can have the truth that you love and it takes humility 11:45 okay I was looking for a round clock see we don't have that up in Canada like that I got just a couple more things that I want to to bring out if I can the breaking down of the walls that we build because when we stand carnally intellectually for something and it might even be the actual literal full truth but we do it in a carnal way and we make it the basis for for for for Unity and with good intentions we cause Division and death so brother B says in Fellowship he says we always fence ourselves off and make and Clans but God wants us to tear down them barriers yes Lord if you want those barriers torn down please tear them down you know where the Bible says humble yourself oh Lord humble me no no we do it it's a choice that we make Amen brother that's the pushing the button to go up the elevator that's my part it's not much in the big picture picture but it's my part God wants us to tear and that's what I've been doing by God's grace I want to tear down the barriers that I built it was my fault God wants us to tear down them berries like all you are doing around here now bringing the whole body of the Lord Jesus in Fellowship around the sacrifice the Lord Jesus why my you talk about spiritual gifts in the church just keep that fellowship and Watch What Happens it'll pour down God automatically if you'll get the thing running right it'll run and God will add to it but you've got to get on the right Road first and you're on the right road now when you go to Breaking the denominational barriers down putting your arms around one another and say we're Brethren then you're on your road back you're on your road to the original and that's exactly right when you start walking this way and make it's been incredible what God has done in my life and in our our group and between different churches friendships and fellowships like we've never had before thank you Lord I believe that's God's desire his purpose we are in the dispensation of the fullness of times when he wants to bring all things together in Christ and we've been hindering it I've been hindering it this is a powerful one simple from the message once more always and I love those things always never only pay attention pay attention that's something you can really get a hold of you shall receive the gift of the Holy I like that it's not it's not wishy-washy he says always when the power of God comes in the walls that you've built around you fall always Lord I want your power to come in amen cuz I want these walls that I built to fall your denominational walls will crush and God will be known again he's the same yesterday today and forever then he goes on he says oh god let's break them walls down once more Lord I don't care we're at the end of the time folks we ain't got much left I said yes Lord let me break down those walls there's a quote I don't know if I have it in here but one place he says ministers break down them walls he says congregation he says if your ministers don't break your walls You Break Down The Walls so we're all under that commission another place is our little petty differences between our organizational fences and so forth has separated them as far as the East is from the West and God will never be able to do nothing to us never until them walls are broke down and we become one in Christ and it's not an understanding all the doctrines the same it's a Unity of the spirit amen we got to Endeavor to maintain that to keep that Palmer room caner caterpillar Locust he says God help us send us teachers that'll straighten to get these old middle walls of partition broke down so we can get to be one in Christ Jesus so the Rapture can take his home there's so many things that that this is essential it's important here he says um we need to lay aside every weight in the sin that e be set us that's part of this this this context or this topic he says ministers break down their middle wall of partition church members that'll forget the differences this is the one I was referring to but it's similar church members that forget the differences between the denominations of churches church members and ministers hold to the horns of the altar with one Accord and pray until the fire of God begins to fall again the stubbornness indifference of men has broke up and godly fear and Brotherly Love Takes its place in the human heart he says Christianity in action not just taught from the pulpit but acted among the members among the pastors that's when you see Christ Living in the church so we need Grace for one another that's love and action that's what Ephesians 4 was talking about meekness humility forbearing one another longsuffering so he says a minister called my wife about a month ago been talking to some scripture he firmly taking a stand that my belief in Divine Healing was wrong that the scriptures did not support what I was teaching that Christ was the same Jes yesterday da Fair that's what brother saying this brother is saying no well he's an American got a right to his own belief but I tried to talk to him nicely no matter how much he tried to argue I just talked to him like a Christian should talk stayed on what I believe but give him room for his belief you ever been in a conversation where you're not giving the other brother the room for his belief that's a durksen characteristic I'm going to stay with it until you finally see the truth because I've got it even if I've got the truth if I come across with that attitude you're never going to receive it from me I need to give you room room for your belief and then pray saying Lord you had to reveal it to me you got to reveal it to him and and maybe he's got something I'm missing and I need to you use a donkey to speak before I mean we limit how we will allow God to speak to us we need to be humble he goes on another place super sign he says we're grateful for every one of you I'm very thankful to God for every member of the body of Christ everywhere in all different phases of faiths 3 years old 14 17 or 16 18 I won't tell you how old my wife is or I but doesn't matter what phase we're in no matter how much they might disagree with me I'm still grateful that even if I think they'd be a little in error in the scripture but yet trying earnestly to stand for what they believe I'm certainly willing to bear with those Brethren and them bear with me in my errors and things because there's none of us perfect amen amen see the holy spirit's the lead us into all truth but none of us have reached the conclusion yet that's yet coming but in the meantime we want to keep pressing on by God's grace closer and closer more Revelation more light and then we should have more grace and more patience as we go up that ladder for those that are following behind that we can help them not criticize or condemn them or or be condescending to them proud and hoty because they're not oh Lord I Thank that I'm not like that Publican over there we hear those stories but we do it amen I did I do if I just that's right God I need I need more of your grace I need to be humble jumping ahead here life he says there's bound to be little things come up in difference of ideas here we are sitting here this morning as much in harmony as men could be I suppose but let us sit here a little bit and begin to talk first thing you know there'd be some brother say something the other might disagree with him a little bit I'd say that might happen here well maybe not here it would in our church anyway it happen in every group wouldn't it that's right he says now it takes real man real CH Christians to withstand that and still feel like a brother wow isn't that powerful isn't that the truth you've got to have it in your heart this Unity that God is looking it's got to be his Unity not some man-made denominational whatever a false Unity we want the real Unity takes a real man of God to be humble enough to give room for the brother in his belief even if it's wrong Lord just keep bringing him along I believe he's sincere he loves you he's given his heart to you he he's on the road he just needs more light and I need more light amen and then we help one another 1 Peter 4:7 the end of all things is at hand can we relate to that is that today be therefore sober which means in the right mind and watch under prayer and above all things there's one of those say above all things okay you got my attention this this is really important above all things have fervent charity among your elv amen not tolerance charity and fervent RedHot burning charity that's what leads to engagements like we saw this morning that's right hey you want to get married uh whatever I guess I think there was some fervent charity that was taking place in that relationship is that right but you know what what can also happen and it happens in marriages today then the cares of this life creep in and things start to cool off and we need we've been given the unity of the spirit we need to maintain it and we need to have that fervent charity above all things have fervent charity among yourselves 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you've purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned not put on genuine love unfeigned love for the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently that's what I believe that we need to see today I've got one more thing here and then we'll close and this is one quote but it kind of puts it all together and it ends in a in a way that I could never say it as good as what is said here this is one that just it stays with me constantly comes from the message I will restore I think that's fitting look where we are look where we've brought ourselves look at the barriers that I've built up look at all these different things that with good intentions I will restore sayith the Lord thank you Lord he's going to bring about the Fulfillment the finish of his commission it's his eternal commission it will be fulfilled amen yes so he says of course we people today we believe that there's three the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost is the three persons of the one true God it's three offices not three Gods now we all believe that so we've got the unity of the faith Brethren okay listen now we think that was ridiculous in the Catholic church but we went right down here at Pentecost and tore yourselves to pieces with it set up another organization started something else I'm going to stop for just a moment have you ever seen in the message where brother Ram talks about the new issue I thought he was just talking about things went along and then another issue came up a new issue there's another new issue no they had something that they called like we call this the message they had something called the new issue where do you stand on the new issue it was it was a huge thing in the ear Pentecostal church and they blew up and split over it what was that new issue well he says instead of coming like Brethren with brotherly love and with unity the first one begin to see that the three persons of the godhead was in one person Christ Jesus now that's truth it's it's it's a greater light a greater Revelation he was the manifestation of God in flesh not another man and then you set up and got the little dogmatic idea of the Oneness soall they went a little too far then you started on that begin to harp on it and you made God one like your finger one and you know that's wrong instead of setting and reasoning together when I come into the factions of the Pentecostals they set a table bigger than that with their heads around you go to this you can't go to this You Preach for them you can't preach for me I said we're Brethren absolutely and if the Oneness faction hadn't have went off to one side and made an issue out of it and would have stayed with their Brethren and let the Holy Ghost anoint them that thing would have never spattered and broke up Brotherhood the way it did amen but they had the truth they saw that the Trinity was not correct it wasn't scriptural hero Isel the Lord your God is one God Peter had the key baptized Jesus now we miss Matthew 28:18 this is something my my dad was an English teacher before he was pastor and this is something has always stayed with me when you see the word therefore in the Bible go back and look what's it therefore something has been that's simple isn't it but we walk right by it it's because I've said something the pizza truck's going to come across here anding lunch therefore when you hear the Bell that's the we're going to close I mean okay so you you got to know what I said before so what I'm going to say now has some context and meaning why so when Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore teaching all men baptizing the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost for what reason what was the reason 2818 he says that God has given all power in Heaven and Earth to me go ye therefore and baptize the name of the father son and ghost because it's all in me now yes it's all been put here vested in me and that's the Revelation Peter had this same Jesus that you crucified God has made both Lord and Christ it's all in him therefore we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that is the Father the Son the Holy Ghost it's in one amen so when you see it therefore stop and make sure you understand where this is coming from man that opens things up in ways that you might not think but it does so he says that thing would have never spatter broke up Brotherhood the way it did it broke up Brotherhood you had to have a little Unity of your own it's an oxymoron two words that don't don't make sense a Unity of just us that's called separation and you go out there and you look in the political word world our social world there's a lot of things like that they say one thing and it's the exact opposite of what they say but we do that scripturally or spiritually he said you had to have a little Unity of your own Unity is not an isolated thing Brethren Unity is for the whole body of Christ not just for me and my little group my little family or whatever group I want to put it to those that follow follow me or whatever he says it started in the early days Paul said when I come among you one has this one has that one said I'm of sephus and I'm of Paul okay we got a decision make here today now sephus Peter he was given the keys to the kingdom I can't discount that that's pretty important but Paul on the other hand God met him on the road to Damascus commissioned him with a pillar of Fire and send him to be the Apostle to the Gentiles oh which one am I going to pick see that's our carnal way of doing it isn't it and they said well I'm of sephus yes but I'm of Paul and so you had that division starting way back then he says was sephus crucified would you baptize in the name of Paul well that stuff had already started it was eating into the church listen to this but they had in the beginning the unity of the one true God a Unity of the spirit endeavoring to maintain to keep that Unity he gave them the unity we have that unity in the spirit not of sephus not of Paul Unity of the spirit of Christ and then he says he heard from some Believers or friends down in South Africa and they have some that baptized three times Face Forward because the Bible says that Jesus pitched forward when he died and the other say no no no no no when you bury some you always lay them down backwards so you three times backwards and they split up over that two great divisions down there and they both and here they were now trying to to sponsor brother braham's meeting and this absolutely was a a thorn in the flesh of trying to to to for him to to work with but he says so they baptized him three times backward once for the father once for the son once for the Holy Ghost they and they split up my goodness Brethren can't you see don't you understand let it be a vision to you what difference does it make when we have lost our feeling of Brotherhood we're in a terrible shape but these little things that break out when somebody grabs it and said we'll make us a Unity he says that's not Unity that's pure petty jealousy amen I spoke on selfishness not here long ago I guess I've done it a few times and there's things that brother random identifies as selfishness that I wouldn't have recognized he he says I saw somebody that was wrong and he that little selfish spirit rose I need to go correct him come on selfish huh okay I'm missing something here I wouldn't have called that selfish I might have said it's wrong but I wouldn't have identified it as selfish and I started looking and there's a number of places he talks about that because I have the truth and I yeah it's selfish it's Pride amen it's pure petty jealousy when we draw these little things he we need real Christian Apostolic Unity Paul said some preach for one thing some preach for gain what difference as long as Christ has preached he had a right to call and said I know that after my departing Grievous wolves will enter in and some among you will raise up with perverse things and so forth but John trying to capit all said oh keep Christ the unity of Christ the love of God in our hearts little children love one another and I've heard the story told that when John the Revelator in his final days he L up into his n 90s I believe and he had to be helped up to the pulpit and he say Brethren love one another love one another don't let love that was his theme he was the same one that says Lord should we call down fire because they wouldn't let sell us uh food for lunch over here he was one of them but then says he became the Fountain of love he says you know not what Spirit you are of we're to love our enemies not tolerate love and I'm going to confess something I have found it easier to love my enemies and people out in the world than people in the message that don't see it just the way I do that sounds silly but it's the truth amen because somebody's maybe so far this way say okay I have Grace for them I realize that but this guy he ought to know better and he ought to see it my way and the Lord why is it so hard for me to love my brother that might have just a little difference here little difference there whatever it is Lord forgive me amen and I draw a barrier there I want to break that down now we're come to our conclusion real quick John trying to cap it said oh keep Christ the unity of Christ the love of God in our hearts little children love one another I believe we have to go through these things we've and going through it I believe we have to go through these things before we can really see the real meaning of them if I had not gone through those things and then come out and realize oh my goodness look at me look what I am look where I've been going Lord I have missed your focus if I hadn't gone through that I wouldn't see it the way that I'm able to see it now and I want to see it Greater I know there's more that I don't see but he say I believe we have to go through these things before we can really see the real meaning of them John was the one who wanted to call fire down out of Heaven burn up Samaria that day because they wouldn't give him something to eat the same one become the very funnel of love and I want to leave you with this phrase here and I'd like to sing that song before I just turn the service back I'd like to sing one of them with musicians or whoever wants to come he says I wonder Brethren if someday when all of our differences when we really see the vision that God is trying to get before us if it just won't break us right down at one another's feet amen oh that hits home makes me feel like that all these differences that I've been standing for championing putting them down building this up when you really see it from Christ's eyes forgive me brother amen Forgive Me Lord break us right down at one another's feet that's that unifying thing that they went through in the upper room that's what brought the unity of Christ in that day and I believe that's the very thing that that every one of his children need to go through that kind of a of an experience we're going through things right now it's going to come everything works together for the good I'm not here scolding I'm just telling you the testimony of what God has done in my life and in my circles that I'm walking in where the barriers were trying to break them down and it's marvelous the fellowship that God has blessed us with good friends that never would have been friends they would have been tolerated acquaintances but now I love them and we have Fellowship there's one brother up there that it's probably one of my closest friends and we get into the word and it's just like did you know a oh my goodness you know what and then there's B it follows a yes oh yes do and see and just together we're both we have all these pieces but fellowshipping with him it just it comes in I wouldn't have that Fellowship cuz he was one that I was it was outside my circles I think Lord what would I have been missing but now when I can see the road that I've been walking and the consequences of it and I realize what's at stake it's the burden of my heart to spread this wherever I can I know we're all believers I know we love the Lord we've been born again now let's walk worthy of the vocation where with we've been called with loneliness meekness longsuffering forbearing one another love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit God gave it to us and so I've got to be meek and lowly and humble space for my brother with his belief pray for one another he might have something that I need take what they say well Lord go through and search the scriptures prove all things hold that which is good amen oh I wouldn't take something from that guy you know what God used a donkey at any rate I just want to say this we love you we really do in a way that I could never say that before I appreciate the fellowship the friendship that God has given us brother Ron it's been a privilege through the years and I have not always walked worthy of the location where I've been called and you know there were some there were some that I looked down on up there in Canada and they would come to our camp I thought why would they come to our camp they don't believe like us well yeah maybe they'll get the truth because they're coming and they came year after year after year and all of a sudden I thought my goodness that was real love that was real Fellowship I says Lord I couldn't have done that I should have done that and so now we have Fellowship back and forth all the churches at special meetings we do all we can I might well of course we don't agree with one another on every detail but that doesn't matter amen we are brothers and sisters in the Lord that's the unity of the spirit may God help us to keep that and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them amen that's what he gave us amen let's sing that we'll let you go in Jesus name one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them yes one of them well I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them sing the chus again I'm one of them one of them well I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that one of them they were gathered in the all praying in his name they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and Powerful service came he did for them that day he'll do for you the same I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them one of them and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of [Music] them glory amen I enjoyed that Paul told Timothy put them in remembrance though they already know these things put them huh was you put back in remembrance un of the spirit until you come to the unity of the faith yes Lord amen he lost me though in that service when he come to prime numbers I wandered around in my mind for about 10 minutes let me see divide by itself and everything like this and then then finally he come down and he said therefore yeah always Paul Paul's always been a teacher and he's always brought these little nuggets all the years I've known he brings this little nugget and therefore yeah I'll never forget that therefore huh a't that ain't that ain't that good and it takes Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers amen huh for the work of the ministry huh each one of them is special gift and I appreciate it brother Paul God bless you richly we love you dearly you know that and I do believe that if we will start showing huh Divine love one for another regardless now that quote about Hey listen we're not going to see I die until we see him I die then why in the world are we trying to get everybody to see it the way I see it right huh Lord help me Endeavor to have the unity of the spirit yes Lord that's important till we come to the unity of the faith the faith is the true Revelation I'll get the final true Revelation I'll get the fullness yes when I see him face to face and then I'll see all of you eye to eye amen amen give God glory this morning amen amen you got to have the you got to have the right Spirit huh sir amen we're going to sing a song we're going to have a a baptismal uh this morning our brother Zach the young man he's got his family here he's going to get baptized and Paul you put it so plainly huh that no one in the Bible ever baptized and the name father son Holy Ghost so when everyone that was ever baptized in the Bible was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is because Peter had a revelation I know what the name is father is not a name it's a title Sons I Jesus said I come in my father's name and there he stood on the opin of this same Jesus whom you have crucified God has made him both Lord and Christ hallelujah hallelujah what is the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost what is it Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then the door comes open the four gospel men that are holding you back the four gospels open up hallelujah oh isn't God good Hallelujah all right did I say the name of a song no no thank you brother Ron that helps me yeah it helps you well T well I'm
