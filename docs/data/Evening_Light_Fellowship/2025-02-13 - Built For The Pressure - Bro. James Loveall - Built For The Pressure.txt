together you have a need in your life maybe a desire you wouldd like to make it known unto God with an uplifted hand yes our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have gathered on this Wednesday night Lord we didn't come to hear man but father we've come to hear from you and we're just asking now father by the foolishness of preaching with Lord you come by our way once again would you minister to lives would you walk the aisles Lord we're a needy people and but father you're so great and you're so mighty and you will meet every need that we have Lord You're an ontime god you're an everpresent help in the time of trouble and so father once again would you come by our way and break the bread of life to us we just Commit This Service as time into your hands Lord we'll be sure to give you the honor the praise and the glory in Jes Jesus precious name amen and amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Proverbs 24 and verse 10 then we're going to turn to Psalms 91 Psalms 91 I just have a simple thought this evening and something that we can be put in remembrance of and we trust that they would encourage you and as I begin to this past week I begin to go and just listen to the prophet of the god you know and I began to listen to the series that he would preach or it's not necessarily series but he would preach several times letting off the pressure and as I begin to just listen to it it just something began and I begin to dissect it and just listen to different parts and so we just trust we can say something this evening so let's start over here in Proverbs 24 And1 and it says if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small if thou faint in the day of adversity and we see this word adversity it refers to a time of hardship a time of difficulty a time of trouble a time of pressure but I want you to understand that your strength will never be enough Amen in a time of adversity and hardship and trials and temptations your strength will never be enough but his strength his strength is always sufficient amen and let's turn over to Psalms 91 Psalms 91 and verse one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadows of the almighty amen I will say of the Lord he is my refuge in my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snares of the fer and from the noisome pestilence amen he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy Buckle Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flyth by day nor the for the pestilence that walk WTH in darkness nor the destruction that w at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only in thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked you understand what he's saying is you will be only be able to see with your eyes everything Satan is only going to be able to get those things that are around you amen but Only With Thine Eyes th thou will behold the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitations amen there shall no be there shall no evil befall thee neither shall no plagues come nigh by thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways can you say Amen you can be seated this evening he shall give his Char his angels charge over thee to keep thee and all thy ways thank thank you Lord so this evening for a subject we'd like to title it built for the pressure built for pressure with the subject of there is a place of Refuge there is a place of refuge and as we begin to build this here everyone is under pressure y everybody is under pressure yes sir do me a favor take a big breath in and let it out one more time a that feel good amen don't go to sleep on me now but you see everybody is under pressure right this world is under pressure pressure has no boundaries it has no limits it has no limitations it it doesn't matter if you're a Believer if you're an unbeliever it don't matter if you're young or you're old it don't matter what age you are it don't matter if you're rich or if you're poor it can go from the pastor to the deacons to a to a position in the church it can go to the Ley it can go to the children everybody is under pressure different forms of pre pressure different kinds and it doesn't matter the stage of life that you're in but pressure comes in different forms right you can have Financial pressure but sickness pressure high blood pressure low blood pressure yeah no blood pressure there's all kinds of pressure in this world and pressure reveals a lot about a person when they get put under that pressure that's right it reveals a lot about that person you have peer pressure within this world trying to fit in or they they they force you into something I can't say he forced me into it but Justin lava he got me to run a half marathon this coming Saturday and I just trust I can get through it but pressure let me say this about pressure it don't matter how much you practice something it's until you get put under that pressure it's going to manifest everything about you you can take professional athletes and they can hit the same shot time and time again on a golf course or or in a batting cage or take a you know a practice free throw and you can shoot in the gym all day long and hit that but whenever the pressure comes and the game is on the line why is it they miss why is it they fail pressure kids are under pressure kids can be under pressure through their parents and wanting them to succeed and to meet need an expectation I've watched it many of times kids in in in certain Sports and they have to live up to their dad's expectation and he takes away the whole Joy of playing the game why because they're trying to live up to that pressure that expectation teenagers Under Pressure trying to to to find themselves husbands Under Pressure to provide to lead by example wives and raising their kids being supportive many times we put ourselves under this pressure and and instead of allowing things just to happen instead of just living life and allowing things to come to as they may and and just walking the Christian Life we we put these pressures and these expectations upon ourselves now maybe maybe you're all perfect and you don't you don't battle with this pressure so I'm going to preach to myself a little bit because I deal with pressure go I'm under pressure you know and it's all in how you handle that pressure when I begin to you know first started preaching and and I was always nervous when brother Ron would send that text and you're waiting around you don't know when you're going to get it and you would sit there because you know why you would sit there as a young Minister and I'm still young in Ministry but you see you sit there and I would I would wonder what am I going to say and how am I going to say it and what's going going to come to me how am I how am I going to put this together but when you realize that it's not you when you realize that as you walk in your Christian Life is you don't have to think about what am I going to do and how am I going to act and how am I going to live no whenever you give yourselfself to Christ you just begin to live it out true many times we don't sensitize ourselves and the pressure begin begin to build as I said brother Brandon would preach us many of times and if he would preach us back in 1963 and I believe there was several others within those similar years that he would begin to preach how much more is the pressure 50 years down the road what is it Satan's trying to do this through the Avenue of pressure and many times we don't realize it that people will act out out of turn and we don't realize that we're here at the house of God and maybe you you have a you know brother Greg walks past me he doesn't even he doesn't even acknowledge me and then we I get offended because brother Greg didn't acknowledge me but yet I don't know the pressure he's going through I don't know the things that he's going through at home I don't know the work life that he's going through people under pressure and I looked it up what causes this pressure or what does it cause on the human body and when humans are under pressure they experience physical emotion and behavioral changes this is called the stress response yes sir physical symptoms would would would be increased heart rate or sweating nail biting butterflies of the stomach em emotional response would be fear anxiety anger feeling easily distracted underconfidence ain't that something you see that's what Satan's trying to get you to have fear a little anxiety a little worry feeling not confident in who you are and who God made you to be and who he called you to be that's right behavioral symptoms irritability tearfulness defensiveness flying off the hand being under characteristically aggressive you ever meet those type of people over aggressive overreact listen we're all human we all do it true you know some of these you can hide a lot easier than others but as I said whenever the pressure comes it's going to manifest and we understand that human nature always finds a way to escape pressure and try to run away from pressure and so what do we do we try to find Avenues to go down and the world if we took an example of them they would try to find it in a bottle or smoke smoke this or distract this way why because they're trying to escape the realities and the pressures of life amen right trying to get it away from these realities and if I can use the story that brother Brandon would he he would tell us about and we all know it of his Winchester rifle and how somebody would give him a Winchester rifle they gave it to Billy Paul and they gave it to him but he's a left-handed shooter and it's a bolt action so he couldn't use it so then brother brandham took it and one of his buddies says well we can make that into a weather bee and a weather be is a bigger you know and so they would have to bore that weatherbe or that Winchester to match that weatherbe right and so he sent it off to weatherbe and they rebore it and they got it back and what happened we know the story it blew up on him when he shot it and brother brand would use this example and he would say that's what happens when a Christian or a person tries to come to Christ and not they're not bore right they're not born again they don't come the right way and when they get put under the pressures of Life they blow up amen but then I begin to think that there's another type there because there's something in that there's situations that we go through and we try to force this God gave us this situation but we want to use it in a different way so we try to bore that situation to go this way good we try to bore it to make it work in our life but yet God didn't all lot that for us so what happens pressure comes it blows up your life will be spared God will spare your life he spared our prophet's life but yet it's an example I say God let us be in your perfect will built under this pressure you know even have it came to me that even in the fire service when you have a a pro let's say a propane tank and it's called C on fire and the gases are escaping it's very hard to put that fire out because the fumes are still coming out so what do you do is the temperature rises and their pressure within the gases begin to become gas and it begins to expand and that pressure what does it do it there there's a there's a Breaking Point amen there's an explosion point that if the temperature gets too hot what is it going to do it's going to explode so what do you have to do you have to take the water and you have to hit that tank and you have to minimize the temperature and you have to try to keep the temperature down you see that's what we're going to do tonight we're going to spray some of your tanks down some of them are at a boiling point that liquid's getting a little bit hot and it's burning real hot and ladyo seed is coming in hot but let me tell you let me spray some water of the Holy Ghost on you and cool you down a little bit and get you to relax and say it's all right let's let off the pressure amen thank you brother brandham says in letting off the pressure he says it's just becoming a neurotic age everybody's all built up having got no time and that builds up to a place that it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off and say things you don't mean mean to say now everybody is guilty of it I'm guilty of it you're all guilty of it yeah we're all guilty of it we're all guilty of it we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there's an e excess pressure built up today and he says before I go any further I say this I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil amen I believe it's the devil so here he is identifying what pressure is it's the devil coming in trying to press down trying to cause you to say things and do things among one another in family members son to son to Father father or mother to daughter whatever it might be pressure conflict and we know the coming of the Lord is at hand and the Bible says in the last days that the devil would go out like a roaring lion and if he can get you under a pressure hurry and running over something you will make a decision that you wouldn't make if You' have sat down and thought it over right he's trying to make you to make a decision and you wouldn't have done otherwise if you would have sat down and thought it over a little bit and I was listening to the sermon today and brother brandom uses the example of him going hunting Colorado and they were riding some horses up the mountain with a a chief that was 10 years younger than him and that they spotted some elk up on the mountain and brother brandham jumps off and takes off running after those elk Chief says slow down too fast too fast he says slow down brother BR said I I dropped it a gear he says too fast Slow Down slow down he says I begin to walk he says too fast Slow Down slow down yeah so he got down to just a slow pace and he's like and the chief told him preacher move too fast he says but the elk are up there chief he says but the YK they stay up there why because they were born there he says you need to do like the the the chief does walk them once look them nine times walk him once look him nine times too many times we're in a hurry we're going about life in a worry and we're making decisions Under Pressure he says there's two classes of people today he says may I say this there's men and women in the world brother rutle he says that really that they don't want to do the things they're doing there's men and women in the world today that don't want to sin and I feel sorry for them they want don't want to go out and do wrong but they do it they're drove to now there's a place for that person that wants to do right there's a place to let off the pressure it's true but there are some that they don't care you see there's two classes there's good people out there true that are looking for a refuge that are looking for a sanctuary looking for a place to let off the pressure then there's some that we've all met them they don't care they don't care if they cuss in your presence they don't acknowledge Christ they don't care about Christ by their own lips will they be justified and some will they be condemned but yet we know that God always makes a provided way amen we read in our Bibles and I won't go through these stories for we know them but we see ones who who have faltered under pressure and I'm not going to say failed Under Pressure because I I I I don't believe that they failed because we don't fail as Christians we might fall we might fall on our knees but let me tell you if you fall down get back up and if you fall get back up you're not failing as a Christian just because you make a mistake just because you you you slip up that doesn't mean you failed as a Christian it just means you faltered a little bit yes and whenever I read in my Bible I see men that have walked with God that talk with God and they fell down but then they got back up again you can take Peter who said I I won't deny Christ I that not me not me Lord but what did he do he denied he cured what about Jonah going in the wrong direction he chose he was going in this direction God told him go this way what did he do he tried to bore his own situation what happened it blew up on him yes sir Abraham lied the prophet was under such pressure in this day what happened he came to a place that he tried to take his own life under such pressure and if the prophet isn't exempt from it who is come on and the prophet came to such a place he was under so much pressure that he he he would listen to his mother-in-law and what happened he lost his wife and there he sat on the bed of his daughter dying Sharon Rose he says God you can take my wife but don't take my little girl don't do it can you imagine the pressure he was in you imagine the decision he would have made if he wasn't under that pressure I guarantee you it' had made a different choice but he was under such pressure what happened that's when Satan came down because whenever you're under pressure Satan's going to come cuz he's going to make you want to make a decision and when that pressure came down what happened Black Sheep came in front of him I thought you said he was a good God I thought you said he loved him let me tell you something when that pressure comes and Satan's in your ear let me tell you that's when the Anchor's going to hold that's when something's going to hold no matter the pressure that anchor holds Lord because you were built for the pressure so let us look here in the Old Testament in Joshua 20 if you could turn in your Bibles Joshua 20 and 1 but we know that the the Old Testament laws that they would live in was an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and a burning for a burning that if you do something I have a right to do this and if you killed a man then you got to be killed and so we see that Joshua because God always makes a place of Refuge in Joshua 20 And1 he says and the Lord also spake unto Joshua saying speak to the children of Israel saying appoint out of you Cities of Refuge where of I spake unto you by the hand of Moses that the Slayer that kth any man unawares and unwittingly May flee thither and they shall be your Refuge from the Avenger of blood and when he doth flea unto those cities he shall stand at the end entering of the Gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the Elders of that City and they shall take into him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the Avenger of blood pursueth after him then they shall not deliver the Slayer into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwi willingly and hated him not beforehand you understand what's happening that if a man comes to one of these Cities of Refuge he said app point six cities that I'm going to make that if anyone would out of cause let's just say by accident and kill his neighbor or something maybe it was by an association that you were a part of maybe you went out with a buddy and and these two guys brother Brandon would dramatize this that you know you would go out and this man he would he was married had a wife and would go out and these two guys were like well can you take us to the store and they took him to the store and they robbed the store we if you've heard it and they robbed the store and now it's by association so now you're caught and now now you're on the run so you come to the City of Refuge seeking safety right in verse six and he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation so first he must come to the entering of the gate and he'll plea his case before the elders and they will decide if he's just to come in or not then he's got to wait before and stand before the congregation for judgment until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then he shall shall the Slayer return and come his own City and unto his own house and unto the city from whence he fled now notice here in these next uh verses of the places of Refuge because I believe that God is trying to tell us something here he appointed in Kadesh in the Mount of naptali and sheam in the Mount of Ephraim and and heam in the Mount of Judah so what is he saying here that there's mountains or these places of Refuge are in a high place they're in the mountains you can see them from afar off you don't put a place of Refuge down in the valley you don't put it in a place down in a low where there's flooding and things that would happen but you put a place of Refuge where people can see it from afar off and on the other side of Jordan so there's three and I'll show you a picture here in a minute but there's three on one side of Jordan and three on the other and they assigned and bezer in the wilderness upon the Plains and rth and Gilead out of the tribe of Judah and Gan and asan out of the tribe of Manasseh and so you see that these other places one is built in the wilderness and one the other two were up on on a a plateau to say and so we see here that the meanings and I begin to look up the meanings because I believe that God speaks to us in meanings that these places must have meanings and so we see that Kadesh means holy Shea means shoulder Hebron means to join or to bind and beaser means to a fortress or a stronghold rth means a high place and Goan means a joyful and so I began to look at these meanings and we're going to come back to these let's read verse 9 and these were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the strangers and for the strangers that sojourned among them that whosoever kth any person at unawares might flee thither and not die by the hand of the Avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation so we see in this last scripture that it's just not for the Israelites it's not just for the Israelites it is for all that the sojourners among them let me tell you this message this Refuge isn't just for the message believer it's not for just those that believe it let me tell you there's some out there in the denominations listen there is a place of Refuge there's two classes of people ones that are willing and ones that are not but what it's saying is it's not just for the Israelites it's also for the sojourners yeah that's good there is a refuge for those of the Sinners that want to come into Christ give me the first picture there so there's six cities might be hard to see there's six cities that are spread out and the reason I wanted just to show this is because there's a strategy in which as I begin to look into it that that it was strategically placed throughout the land that of any person that would come under this cause or have a case against them they would be able to flee to one of these cities no matter where they were in the land that they could reach one of those cities within one day travel that there is a place of Refuge one day away from them that no matter where they were if they came under a circumstance if the devil was pressing on them there was a a way of Escape at least one day away and so we see that there was it it was placed there for a purpose and a reason let us read numbers 35 now I want us to remember that this person is going to come into the City and he's got to come before the elders but then he's going to come before the congregation and the then the congregation shall judge between the Slayer and the the Revenger of blood according to these judgments so he comes before the elders and they let him through and now he comes before the congregation now my wife was just had to go to jury duty we all have to if we get called it's our citizen obligation so it's an obligation of these this congregation to judge this man rightfully and when they come before and they bring this man before him and say I want you to judge this man just F now that this congregation is is going to look upon the man and they must judge according to what the law says and also the grace that they're willing to give this is the congregation he says and the congregation shall deliver the Slayer out of the hand of the Revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his Refuge he's it's not the elders restoring it's the congregation restoring are you understanding where I'm coming from that it is the congregation if I was to bring brother Greg before the people and I'm saying that Satan is coming against him and he is accusing him of him and he's telling them and he's bringing all these accusations let me tell you who is doing the restoration let's just bring it to our day cuz that's where I'm headed if who is a part of Christ and if Christ is the judge and the jury and he's one and you bring a person before the congregation who is doing the restoration it's the congregation giving the man to welcome him into the city and I trust you judge according to the grace that was given unto you yes sir that's good amen if Christ is our refuge and if you're a part of him who's helping him do the restoration today but if the Slayer shall at any time come out of the borders of the city whether he was fled and the Revenger of blood find them without the borders of the city of his refuge and the Revenger of the blood kth the Slayer he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in the City of Refuge you see if you come within the city if you come within the city it's one thing to be accepted and you come into that City and you accept the Refuge there but you must abide there in the city because outside of the city the Revenger of blood is out there and Satan is out there seeking whom he may devour and if you come into Christ and Christ is our refuge listen outside of Christ is death outside of Christ there's there there's there's everything he's seeking yes sir he's trying to find ways to get you outside of that City you must remain within that City of Refuge and so these things shall be for a statue of judgment unto you throughout your generation and all your dwellings so we see here that these six cities that were given unto Moses and then Joshua implemented here that they would be six cities of as an example of God's provided place they were physical locations that the people can run to and remember I said that it was within one day of travel of no matter where you were and all these attributes as I begin to see and I begin to read into them and I begin to look them up and I begin to find scripture for them that all these attributes were wrapped up in one final attribute or one final Refuge because all these attributes are all tied up into the New Testament attribute or Refuge you see God came down on Mount Calvary as a place place of Refuge give me that picture and there he spread forth his hands he said it is finished and he gave his life that we might have a new testament Refuge to run to that no matter now it's not some City it's not some destination it's not some location it's not Jeffersonville or some headquarters that you got to go to no it's not a physical location but it's in Christ because when you're in Christ you have the Refuge all these attributes are wrapped up in Christ it's not the The Refuge of a church building it's not the Refuge of a pastor of a preacher or somebody no it's not in the The Refuge of your parents because listen people will fail and they will fall but let me tell you the Refuge is in Christ I begin to look in the new and the old scriptures of how the it was spoken of a coming Messiah and Kadesh means holy and 1 Peter 1:16 says but he that hath called you is Holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am Holy shech means shoulder and I begin to this one I I was having a hard time with because I was like how do you correlate this one in but then I found the scripture of Isaiah 9:16 For unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be wonderful counseler the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace let me tell you in a time of trouble he's a good shoulder to put your head on he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble and in Luke 15 I I had to throw this one in here because it begin to talk about the parable of the lost sheep and how that the Good Shepherd would leave the 99 to go for the one and it says here in in Luke 15 and5 and when he hath found the lost sheep he layeth his his he layeth it on his shoulder rejoicing and when he cometh home he called it together his friends and his neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my lost sheep which was lost and I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than 99 just persons which need no repentance one sinner want some let me tell you God the heavens are rejoicing when one sinner comes back to God over 99 needing no repentance I say God bring back the Sinners bring back those lost ones that are out in Wayward yes sir yes Lord Hebron was to join or to bind and in Psalms 147 and3 he heals the Brokenhearted and binds up their wounds baser means fortress stronghold rth meant high place Proverbs 18 and10 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are saved Goan means joyful Nehemiah 8:10 says the joy of the lordu is my strength amen the joy of the Lord sometimes we need a little bit more joy I say Lord give us the joy of our Salvation when the pressure comes in like a flood and it's pressing down of a on us sometimes we just need a little bit of joy we need to get out of these things let me tell you something whenever you're going through a pressure time you just need a little bit of joy you know and you want sometimes you won't find that just you don't have to be fasting and praying sometimes it can come and and hiking going out hies talking with sister Marty on Sunday and now she just goes out and just hikes the the the trails to get along with God and talk to him what is she doing she's letting off the pressure sometimes letting off the pressure is finding something that you have enjoyment in maybe it's hunting maybe it's fishing maybe it's hiking maybe it's running I don't know what it is sometimes you just got to get alone with God and let off the pressure so 51 and12 restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit brother brandom says now I believe that a man coming to Christ and Christ is our refuge now he says that is the New Testament Refuge is Christ now a man coming to this Refuge must want to come and he must remember another thing he's got to stay there he's got to stay there oh my can't run in till the pursuer gets by and then go out again he's got to be satisfied that's what happens with a lot of people that come to Christ they come to Christ under a pressure and God delivers them from a certain circumstance and they come into Christ and they're happy and they're on fire with God and they get to a place and but yet they're not satisfied because they're waiting for the that that Avenger of blood to leave them and they think that Satan's left them in the past and then they step outside of the boundary they get outside the protection of the word but I say when you come to to Christ come completely in give all yourself to Christ Come Holy unto him when you come to Christ you must be satisfied let me tell you something I'm satisfied I'm satisfied and I'm happy to be a Christian I'm happy to be in the house of God I'm satisfied on a Wednesday night that I can come into the house of God and give him praise and give him worship God why because I've seen the evidence of God's goodness in our [Applause] lives I'm satisfied yes sir people in the world get their satisfaction from elsewhere they try to find it in in entertainment and all these different distractions but when you come to Christ let me tell you you should be satisfied and as long as he's in the refugees days and if he ever goes out again he's subject to the Slayer and in Christ we have a refuge and are secure that we have safety from the wrath of God and the wrath of hell that is coming Upon Us in that Refuge you're safe I say get in and stay in get in and stay in now's not a time to play around if you're not in get in because we don't have much time left that's right right get in and stay in stay satisfied with him because let me tell you when things begin to happen it's going to happen very rapidly it's going to be too late whenever the death angel was passing in the days of Moses and he was going through the land of Egypt and he said apply the blood apply the token over the doorpost I guarantee you there wasn't a lot lot of time left when that them black angels or the black he calls them the big black wings would begin to fly over Egypt there yeah and the fear would begin to sink into your body if you never applied the token if you never got right if you never took it serious and as that Death Angel would begin to fly brother Brandon would tell it he would say that Death Angel would begin to fly and he says I could see and this little boy was sitting next to his daddy and he says daddy that that that them angels are coming them wings are coming right come on and he says I can hear old Johnny's mother out in the street crying he's dead he's dead he says daddy he's coming for us next what are we going to do what are we going to do he said son I he he said to that old father he got his Bible and he put it down he took Johnny over to that doorpost or he took Junior to the doorpost he says you I want you to show you something he says you can let off the pressure why because I've applied the token I've put it over the house nothing's going to get us it's going to fly right past us yes sir glory to God I say each one of us each father each mother each young person should be able to say this evening that I've applied the to token over my life yes sir let me tell you if you get a gut feeling in your stomach this evening that you you're not sure you're uncertain now's now's not a time to play to question whether you do or you don't you better get in because when that those wings Begin to Fall let me tell you death and hell's going to follow him it's going to be too late then pressure when you've applied the token that pressure is off you can tell your first born that I've applied the token I've done Junior might ask well Daddy how do I know that it'll save me how do I know it's sufficient enough because it's his word it's his provided way yes sir listen Christ is his provided way this evening thank you Lord the prophet he would walk us down through time and he would begin to tell us about and show us the Evol ution or the the evolvement of man and he would begin to break it down into he would show us and talk to us about the the buggy age and he would say then we've moved on to the car age and we'd come up to the airplane age and you see these car and buggy they're Earthbound Vehicles they don't need to be pressurized they're not built for pressure they don't need to be pressurized you can roll down the window you can roll the up but whenever you get off the Earth these vehicles such as the airplane they got to become pressurized and so we see that as it begins to evolve it would get into the airplane but now the airplane can only take it so high there's limitations to that vehicle let's call it there's limitations on how high you can go that if it gets up so high that it would bust in half so there's limitations on that and we see that and I I looked it up that it was the maximum of a commercial flight can only go 42,000 ft in the air so everything has to stay below that limit and these are daily happenings people are going to and fro in their cars they're going to and fro in the airplanes these these are things that are happening all around us every day thousands and thousand times a day but the prophet would begin to take us into he would say we've gone further we've gone into the astronaut age and when we realize that the astronaut age is is something this vehicle is not built just for it's not going off every single day it's not just keep going and going and you just keep making it happen no what does the astronaut have to happen they there's a lot of preparation going into it yeah right the preparation is key to the journey you have to be you have to have the right kind of suit you have to have a pressurized suit you have to have a pressurized helmet you have to get ready because the pressures up there are unbearable so you have to get to a place that you can h stand the test and you can stand the pressure that's coming and you see that's what God is doing he's preparing you he's prepping you he's pressurizing you he says I'm not going to take the pressures from around you but what I'm going to do is I'm going to pressurize you from the inside I'm going to build you to stand the test of time I'm going to build you that whenever that time comes that in a moment and a twinkling of an eye when things are getting ready to go let me tell you you're going to be pressurized to stand the test you're going to be able to take this trip amen most of the time astronauts and all these ones they take how many trips one maybe two but most of the time it's a one-time trip let me tell you you're getting ready for a one-time trip you're getting ready for a one-time trip you better make sure that this thing is sealed because if you find any Nick or cranny or anything any lug nut any wash or anything that's off let me tell you it's going to explode but whenever you're ready and that thing is sealed let me tell you it's his provided way in the countdown he says the astronaut age we are living in in the astronaut age just as God has testified by natural happenings there and so he testified now that we're achieving an astronaut God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi 4 only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands listen to this only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from them airplane and Automobiles and what more and not look back to what it was but more on the power to lift him higher lift him up into the Pres of God lift him up there where all things are possible now we see it's happening there is no doubt to it he needs a person to stop looking in the past stop looking in the Pentecostal age stop looking for emotions and all these things stop looking for Sensations back in the past we're trying to look up we're trying to look forward move forward sir he says if I can get one person on to cut loose I say Lord let me be one of them people I want to cut loose thank you Lord to get into the presence of God he says one of these mornings God's achievement of an astronaut that's climbed into Christ been born in there by the holy spirit filled with his power he says one of these mornings the whole universe will be screaming and wailing and nashing of teeth when they see they've missed it he says when the Great Eagle powered by the Holy Ghost in fire brings and spreads her wings the astronaut will take off into the sky and go to meet with the bridegroom and when the bride takes off and in the astronaut power of God Almighty he says who sent Jesus Christ to the Earth in the form of the Holy Ghost has brought the church through all these achievements she's progressed she's progressed from the automobile and and and from the airplane age and all these different things but we got to keep moving forward we got to keep moving higher we got to go into higher Heights and deeper depths until now she is getting resurrected power in her to fly beyond the things of the world seeing him in out there in the church making himself the same yesterday today and forever yes sir he says the countdown is even over every Church age has done past we're ending on the loud youa we're here brothers and sisters get in my brother my sister he says get pressurized the pressure won't hurt you when you've got inside and get pressurized get in Christ and you won't care what the world says they can't never hit you anyhow you're safe you're tucked in you see the journey is now the preparation is now the ceiling is now because whenever the Rapture takes place it's going to be in a moment and a twinkling of an ey but now the preparation is the most important thing getting in Christ is now making sure your calling an election is sure now praise the Lord God Amen how do we know how do we know whenever this time happens how do we know that we'll stand the test of time when that Rapture comes how do we know that we'll be pressurized why because his word says so now if I can say like the chief said he says how do I know that he was talking about the milk he said they live up there because they were born there let me tell you how do I know I'm going to live up there it's because I was born there it's because I came from God and I'm going back to God glory to God you were built for the pressures built for the trials built for these things of Life built for the chest yes it's why the Bible says buy of me gold tried in the fire why is it so tried and molded Under Pressure because it's the only thing that can stand that test of that heat and that pressure everything else when you go through trials and everything let me tell you everything's going to burn off and fall off absolutely Psalms 9 and9 says the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in a time of trouble and they that Know Thy name will be put their trust in thee for thou Lord Hast not forsaken them that seek thee Psalms 46 And1 God is our refuge and a strength of very present help in the time of trouble praise the Lord yes sir letting off the pressure here he says the waves can beat and baffle sickness can come death can come or anything else but you're safe ever more amen Christ our refuge God provided place of safety Christ is the only place of safety for those that want to live he is the only one that has eternal life there's no church no denomination no president no King no Pope no Bishop no minister no nothing can give you safety but Christ Jesus that's why you can't put your Assurance in anything else but Christ the word he says he is the only provided place that can give you safety and he is God's provided safety musicians come oh we can provide this and provide that and it'll fall but when God provides anything it's Eternal and that's God's provided way of sa of our for our safety in Christ I love it he says when you're in him when Trouble Comes like sickness or worry or disappointments he bore our sorrows with his stripes we are healed everything that we have need of for the rest of the journey is right here in the Refuge so let me ask you this evening what do you have to worry what do you have to fear when you're in Christ you have everything hallu when you have Christ you're and you're in him you have all the answers why it's not why me this why this no no don't question just walk keep having faith [Music] believe we're living in an age that you see pressure is building up it's building up ah we're all humans we we make mistakes hey I'm guilty of it I snapped the other day it happens sometimes you just got to bring yourself into you know check yourself I'm sorry it was my fault I made a mistake this was over the phone and you know many times that's when I feel like a failure because you're supposed to live the life of Christ and you're supposed to be an example and then you're on the phone and you you blow up or you get an argument and but yet you know what we do we dust it off we get back up again uh these trials these mistakes these pressures of life these things we go through what is he doing is he's molding and he's making us thank you [Music] Jesus you were built for the pressures yes many times we think we get to our Breaking Point ah you're not there you know I've been training for this couple weeks not much training for a half marathon but you begin to run and you know within the it's 13 point something miles and as I begin to run and I I don't even enjoy running I don't enjoy it but you know it's some sometimes it's good for us to do things that we don't enjoy it gets us out of our comfort zone to you know go out of the way and talk to somebody that you haven't talked to or have somebody over for dinner you know it allows you to get out of your comfort zone amen right so I begin to run and you know within every time I run within the first two miles I want to quit I want to give up I why would this isn't no fun this is what am I doing but you know what you do you tell yourself let me tell you something if you're going to quit quit tomorrow and when tomorrow comes quit tomorrow when tomorrow comes quit again quit tomorrow always quit the next day why because that means you're just going to keep going and you're going to keep [Music] going whenever you get out there and I was running you begin to realize and you put put on a sermon and after a while you just kind of put away the pressures of life and you begin to run you don't have any worries you don't have anything holding you down I begin to think Lord help me let this be a resemblance of my Christian walk let me run to gain the prize if we're going to run let us run to win let us strive let us not quit let us not be a a quick give in that whenever the pressures build up and things happen and it's so easy to throw in the towel husbands whenever you get an argument it's easy to snap off or maybe mothers with W with children it's so easy that the pressures and you're going through something and to identify what's happening that's all we got to do we got to expose the devil because the prophet of God told us it's Satan coming in trying to press on your lives he's trying to press down on your families he's trying to draw a conflict between you and your father you and your brother brother you between different ones pressures you know the thing about pressures you have an incident that blows up doesn't mean I don't love you but it just you you acted at a turn you allowed this boiling point to happen I say let us let off the pressure let us take a moment and just say God help me to come to a place that the cares of life and tries of life and I understand the pressures we all understand pressures Financial pressures maybe there's not enough money in your bank account maybe you've come to a place you see even with this races I begin to think there's a deadline coming and I know that this Saturday is a deadline and I'm going to have to run no matter what let me ask you if you knew the deadline or the end of your life how would you be living amen what kind of pressure would it put you under would you be have more Zeal toward God or would you be more more slacked and say you know what God you told me I have 10 years so I'm going to just be a little bit more slacked but let me tell you that shouldn't be the case because when you come to Christ as I said you should be So Satisfied Hallelujah that you have no hungers of this world you have no desires of this world because he said the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world Christ is not in you I say God help us amen let's stand you were built for the pressures let's just say a prayer [Music] father letting off the pressures Lord if your Prophet would preach us several times and he'd say I go places and before I get into the pulpit I seek the mind of God and I would get out of the way and Lord what would you have for your people and he would sensitize himself and he would say and he came to the the pulpit there and he' say there's such a pressure I can feel the pressure of of people and the church and because there's no boundaries of pressure and of things we go through in Trials of life but he says if we can come to a place because in Christ is our refuge in Christ in him is our refuge and I'm so thankful Lord that you made a place of Refuge that we can come into Christ that we have access that it's not a place it's not a day away it's not a month away we don't have to travel somewhere but it's in Christ and we can access him 24/7 365 we can access him day we can ACC access him in the middle of the night Lord no matter what it is Lord you're always there you're ever presentent help in the time of trouble we're so thankful and we're blessed that you've called us you've elected us you've chosen us [Music] Lord Lord and we're so thankful that you sent Lord your prophet in this day Lord I know it's not deep it's it's not something but father may it help the people in their everyday lives may they be able to apply it in their lives and expose the devil when a situation arises when something comes up and identify and say you know what maybe he's under a little bit of pressure I'm going to give him a pass I'm going to give him a break maybe I'll pray for him maybe I'll I'll say a prayer for him Lord help us help us Lord I ask a special blessing upon your people Lord I I know they're going through things I know things are hard and this the uncertainty of this this government and the direction of America we know where it's headed Lord but lord it's under the shelter of your wings it's under the shelter of your wings lord it's not the strength of ourselves but it's the strength of you father how blessed we are to be able to call you father and to be able to call on your name that Lord as I said the these pressures aren't just for the believer but they're also the unbeliever but they don't have a place to go they don't have a place to go and let off the pressure but Lord we're so thankful we do that we can come into your house even into this sanctuary set aside the cares of Life set aside the worries and say father here am I Lord we commit this day this midweek service I ask a special blessing upon your people Lord bring us back

just get a little break I said I never get a break I'm always Under Pressure but you know what God has it that way that's right keep you focused and when you fall you fall forward then get back up his

it amen but Lord when I give everything yes all my thoughts all my ambitions all my ideas everything that I have when I give it to you and I place it at your feet Lord Lord you're more than able you've already provided sometimes you're just waiting for us to realize to recognize Lord we take it for granted sometimes Lord and sometimes the cares of this life they they seem to get get us all intertwined with just our emotions and feelings and stuff like that Lord but you're doing it to bring us to a place Lord there's a reason why you said consider the trials of your faith more precious than gold amen because it's in those times it's in that time where your Prophet said when Satan under such pressure says you say your God loves you and yet he leaves you alone in a time like this he don't hear your prayers and he said there was something that helped Hallelujah because Lord we can't curse you even when job got to that place he couldn't curse you why because you were part of him and he was a part of you from the very beginning Lorden thank you Lord and Lord we we I liked how brother James said it tonight says the elk they live up there because it was born up there amen we were born up there Hallelujah returning back to there and all this other stuff is just meant to pressurize us thank you Lord help us Lord to not be in the horse and buggy days and to not just coast along Lord but help us to get more pressurized and if we're not going through it maybe we're not walking like we should because the pressure is something that you give us as a gift and we thank you for that we thank you Lord for the fine tuning of the holy spirit amen I pray that you would bless this church Lord bless the ministry bless the bless all the people Lord that came here tonight Lord this was certainly a place of Refuge for me tonight and Lord I I'm just thankful to to be here and amen I liked how he even said that it was the people at the church it was the congregation that's
