each one of you while you're standing just flip over the Bible with me to Genesis the first chapter um good to be back in the presence of the Lord to feel his presence you know we sometimes I think we take it for granted you know we we come so often and feel that prayer presence that we maybe just don't appreciate it like we should but you know if you if you just go out maybe you go visit some other Church sometime you'd come back here with the a smile on your face thanking God for the presence of the Lord amen money can't buy that that's right that's right you can go a lot of places you can buy a lot of things hey they had Amazon Deal days right all you sisters supposed to said amen you know I didn't even look at it but you can't buy what you have here at Amazon our deild days or anything else right amen so I appreciate it let's let's just read here and then we'll pray and let you be seated Genesis the first chapter I want to start the 11th verse and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding SE yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought brought forth grass and the herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day drop down the 20th verse and God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that have life and the foul that have that fly above the Earth in the open Firmin of heaven and God created great Wells and great living creature that that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and God saw that it was good the 24th verse and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle creeping and creeping things and the Beast of the earth after his kind and so it was and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the animal after his kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father we just come tonight calling upon your precious Name Lord God we need you tonight Lord because we know that it is your spirit your anointing that destroys the Yoke it is your presence that comes and brings he health and life and peace and joy Lord the things that we need from you dear Lord and God we stand here before you and before this congregation Lord confessing our need for you to minister Lord I let me get out of the way it's a et's gift was just to move aside dear Lord let me get out of your way that you may speak to your people what you so desire to do Lord we just ask all these things in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and the church said God bless you may be seated tonight um thank you brother Ron I really enjoyed the service there Sunday uh brother Ron had called me and asked me about taking his service on the Wednesday night can you said understand you're supposed to be out here and I said well so my wife tells me I'm supposed to be out here on you know because there's the baby dedication going on and a birthday and so we we we have to come for that she tells me and so she books the tickets and I get to carry the baggage and and so forth so uh she's not going to be a sad and you know I I was so grateful for the dedication there Sunday the service Sunday and um you know a year ago this time it was extremely difficult you know when we were looking at a a baby that medical staff didn't expect to survive didn't expect him to live and heart and hypertension from trying to pump blood into a lung that was undeveloped and you know a miracle of God that that developed a lung that put that lung in place that has and done so many wonderful things in Josiah's life and so we're we're so grateful we're very very thankful for all that the Lord and we know the Lord's still working he's not done right amen sometimes we we we fail to remember hey he's he's doing what he knows to do that is best right amen so we we appreciate that enjoy brother Ron's testimony I'd never heard it you know you don't really know somebody till you really get to hear their testimony so now I feel like I know brother Ron I knew that he had been a surfer and so forth and I'd always imagin long blonde hair I have a vivid imagination but but you know to hear the testimony it was it was tremendous it was a blessing so I appreciate that and I always appreciate the the presence of the Lord here at evening lot it's just it's a it's such a a joy to walk in and hear you Worship the Lord and feel the presence of the Lord like I said you can't you don't get that everywhere so but let's let's jump into the word of the Lord now we going here Genesis the first chapter and you may have recognized we read some different scripture we read seven different scriptures here and the word kind was used in scriptures and the word kind is used in the Old Testament 31 times and it's actually used 10 times in these seven verses that we read and it actually makes a statement here after his kind and that statement is also here 10 times in these seven verses after his is kind and I would like to take that for a title tonight if I may after his is kind that word kind in the Hebrew actually means species after this species that something is going to be made after a certain type or after a certain species and we know we read there in the the first couple of verses 11th 12th verses where God was dealing with a botney life and he was telling the herbs to bring forth the trees the fruits the things and he said whose seed is in itself now you recognize that when you read these passages he doesn't use that term whose seed is in itself other than when it's talking about the boty life and the prophet of God told us you know every Apple that's going to be in an apple tree it's it's in that it's in that seed it's in that apple or in that little sprig of a plant when it's just a few inches tall every Apple that's ever going to be there is in that tree at that point right so it seed is in itself amen you know that that tree doesn't have to mate with another tree to produce fruit so but he doesn't use that term uh when we get down here to when he starts talking about the living creatures when he starts talking about manimals and fish and so forth so it it's it's uh it's it's different but he uses the term after his kind and and this is a law of God's nature it's a law of nature that you know whenever you produce something whenever you plant something it is going to produce whatever you planted right that's that is it is the law of the spoken word whatever God spoke amen that's what it was going to produce I mean it was going to bring forth whatever the the word was I mean an Acron is always going to produce oak tree an acre will never produce an apple tree uh you know if you plant a pumpkin seed you're not going to get a watermelon it will never ever happen it's not going to produce a squash to me you know I can go down to the the farmers market and they've got all the fall pumpkins and squash and gourds and whatever else out and you know I can stand there and look at the green and the orange and the white and whatever and you know I really don't know the difference between a pumpkin and a squash so many of them look they look so similar you know but if you plant a pumpkin seed no matter how close it looks uh a squash may look like it you're always going to get a pumpkin right amen it's never going to transform that seed is not going to change Amen to produce something else I mean that's what you plant it that's what you're going to get so it's a law of nature it's going to happen I mean it's like gravity it's a law of nature right I mean I can stand up here and drop his handkerchief a thousand times gravity is always going to do the same thing it's a law right you don't break that law and so a law of nature that what it that that that thing is going to bring or produce after its kind now Jesus reaffirms this law and he applies it spiritually also we find out in Matthew the 7th chapter and the 16th verse it said ye shall know you shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles you do not right you're going to get a grape you're going to a grape vine somewhere to get a grape right amen whatever many kinds of grapes you still going to have to come of grape vine it's not going to come from something else even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth forth not gr food is heun down and cast into fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know that because whatever the kind of tree that is it's going to produce that fruit I mean it's we know it is a law of nature right and it applies spiritually now Paul also confirms this over the book of Galatians 6th chapter and the 7th verse he says be not deceived God is not mal for whatsoever man sth that shall he also reap physically and spiritually naturally and spiritually amen whatever you s if you PL a garden amen you're going to going to reap whatever kind of seed that you have planted that's what's going to grow and whatever we whatever we're planting spiritually amen that's what we're also going to reap amen so it's a law of nature it doesn't change amen the prophet of God said in three kinds of Believers he said Nature has a law and there is a law of nature there is no way at all to get around it it is a law of Nature and the thing and then there is a law the spirit there is also no way of getting around that amen so here is a law of nature brother said you know you you can't change that God put in place this principle in the law of nature that whatever is planted that's what's going to grow that is what is going to be produced amen that's what is going to bring forth would you do it spiritually or you do it in a natural now we we stopped reading in Genesis the 1 chapter and the 26th verse or 25th verse but God was not finished with creation that's right in the 25th verse and he goes on into the 26th verse and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and everything that creeping the thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the of the Sea and the foul of the air and over everything that moveth upon the Earth so here is God now after he's made all these other things and he looked at all these other things he said you know what it's good and that tree is good that grass is good amen that that eagle is good that cowl is good uh all these things that creep on the earth they're good but you know they're not in my image and I really can't I really can't have fellowship with them amen so he took and he his final creation was in his own image he made Man In His Image after his likeness after his kind he made man so he could come down in the cold of the day and walk in the cold of the day and have fellowship with him and make could commune with him you know I know people love their dogs and you know your dog you can have a bad day amen you go in there that dog is waging his tail and and and his tongu hanging out no matter how bad a day you may have had amen no matter if you've lost your next of kid whatever that dog is always but listen he don't feel like you feel it doesn't understand what you what you're going through right but here God has created Something In His Image amen that that can that that can uh realize and feel what he feels can think like he thinks can speak the language that he speaks that has the to do the things amen that God could do amen hey that tree don't belong there let's move it over here that mountain don't belong there let's move it over this way amen he created man in His image amen so he can have that Fellowship now here's the thought if if man is created in the image of God and God tells man to go and be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth so what is the fruit of man going to produce if the law of God the law of nature is it's got to produce after its kind and God has created man in his own image now listen I can take that pumpkin amen I can plant that seed it grows it produces a nice pumpkin I can Harvest that pumpkin split it open take the seeds out of it dry the seeds next year plant the seed amen and guess what it's going to produce again another Pucket in the same image right amen every time I do that year after year now if you get some hybrid seed we know the hybrid seed it's good for one year it won't reproduce amen but if you go back to the original seed amen it's going to produce amen the same thing that it was and so if man is going to multiply be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth what is his fruit going to be should be in the image of God right it should be in the image of God now we know uh uh that there was a problem there and we we look over in Isaiah the 14th chapter and we find there Lucifer the son of the morning right the 12th verse Thou Art Fallen how are thou fallen from Heaven a loose for the sun of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which which didst weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the Stars of God and brother bam said Satan he and that was the sons of God right he said that's Sons the stars of God that's the sons he said I will sit upon the M of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high and so here's Lucifer amen trying to say you know what I'm going to be like God I want to be like God it's my desire to be above the sons of God the stars of God and I'm going to bring my Throne up and I am going to be like the most high but God was not going to have any of that Lucifer was Satan was cast down because of his desire to exalt himself into the image or into the likeness of almighty God now you can imagine here it is Satan is rejected from projecting himself into the image of God and yet he looks and he sees that God has created man in his own image amen and so we know that Satan he corrupts that lineage he interjects he pollutes he corrupts and contaminates the seed of God so that now whenever whenever man goes to produce fruit he's not producing in the image of God are you with me come on don't leave and so we know we know the story Satan begals Eve and so forth and we find here then in Genesis the 3D chapter after that Satan had beguiled Eve uh uh and and uh corrupted that that bloodline it says in the 14th verse of Genesis the thir chapter that the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly thou sh go and th Thou shalt eat all the days of life and I will put eny between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now we know so the serpent had a seed it amazes me all the people that want to leave the truth today all of a sudden they don't believe that the serpent had a seed any longer they don't believe that truth anymore amen but the scripture tells us right here that there's going to be and we see the results of the seed of the serpent we look around you don't you walk outside the door and you'll see the results of the seed of the serpent you'll see what the seed of the serpent is producing you you you go to the internet and you find out that that what 40 babies were beheaded in Israel babies babies now what kind of human being could behead a baby that is the serpent seed that is what do that is what the serpent produced you look out here and you see sin you see the vile acts are going on you see people doing unconscious acts amen that that they that and don't lose a sleep over day America guilty of what uh I think it's 62 plus million uh uh uh abortions don't think a thing about it think that's all right it's our body we'll do what we want to with it and you know what that is it is showing the fruit of the serpent it is showing that that that that product of the serpent is still very much real and very much alive here in Satan's Eden in Satan's Eden that fruit is being produced amen and and and the ungodliness it's it's just beyond uh uh what we we our minds can imagine I cannot I cannot fathom that somebody could take a a a child and behead it a baby beheaded I I mean that that is the product that is the product of a serpent it's it's beyond just being an animal it's beyond being an animal see that an animal an animal acts better than that amen but but a human that a corrupt seed the corrupt bloodline of humanity that was corrupted by the seed of the serpent amen is producing in Satan's eating the most vile ungodly things you know you you you I don't know maybe I shouldn't get off on this I don't know but you know sometimes you walk out here down the street you go you you go shopping whatever you go to a restaurant and in walk someone you know got tattoos from their eyebrows down to their toenails you know they've got Pearsons everywhere going all kinds of places and and today they I mean they I I've seed them you know where they they split their tongue to look like a Serpent's Tongue it's a manifestation of the seed it's a manifestation of what is on the inside of them it's something that a spirit that's on the inside of them that is manifesting itself on the outside and we see that minut it is very real you don't have to go very far to see these things and and so it's just that manifestation of of what is taking place but now I want you to know something whenever Satan polluted into or interjected into the bloodline of humanity because here is the the the creature that was made in the image of almighty God and he pollutes that he didn't just pollute one we all become subject to that we all become guilty we all become a part of that Romans the 5th chapter 12th verse says wherefore as by one man cented in sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that that all have sinned and so we all become subject to that right no matter what kind of a good home you may have been raised in amen you know nobody had to teach that child at 2 years old how to lie we were after church here oh guess it's been two or three weeks ago and and I ID come out after service and I was setting in the nursery and and my two and a half-year-old little granddaughter she runs in there and she says pop uh are we going to go out to eat I said well go ask Gali she took off running out the door and I heard her she running out that door and the top her L pop said yes whoa that's taking a lot of Liberty with what pop said and you know nobody had to teach her to say that I mean it just it's a part of it as much as I love her amen you know there's that if she gets in trouble she'll she'll come out with something to defend herself at 2 and 1/2 years old I mean just we we were we were uh telling her to you know look you here a few months ago say if you'll quit you know wearing a diaper and to pull up and you'll use the potty we'll have a we'll have a potty party hey try it sometime it works okay so we not the potty the party so we told her okay you know and you'll go a week or whatever it was and not not wet yourself and this and so forth and use potty we'll have a potty party we'll get every everybody to come and we'll cook out and do all this stuff so she was getting really close and she was outside playing and all of a sudden she had an accident she got up on the she got up on the front porch and there's some water there and she started pouring that water out and I said what is she doing you that's Sharon had it to to water the flowers with and she's ped and she started stomping around in that water and like you know I I'll go tell them I I didn't wet myself I I stomped in the Water 2 and 1/2 years old nobody taught her that you know we I I we telling hey you don't lie you tell the truth that's but look at that's a part amen they're born with that nature right we were all in that place at one time we come forth amen from our mother's womb speaking lies amen we formed in that shaped in that amen We inherited that from the fall am mean that's what the position that we were put in so death passed upon all men in that all have sinned righten so we've all been in that place now I I want to look amen over here to go let's flip over to John the 8th chapter uh real quickly John 8th chapter the 31st verse then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him so I would just I want to I want to take us to that verse because I want you to know who who he's speaking to he's speaking to Jews that believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed so it's not the fact that you've been following me that you say that you believe in me you got to continue in the word amen if you leave the word amen then amen and and this is a group so we're going to drop down here just see what he begins to tell the Jews that believed on him Amen in the 37th verse says I know that ye are Abraham's seed which is the natural seed in the natural yes you can do the DNA you can go back and you can look up your lead you can go take it all the way back to Abraham you can do it amen so in a natural yes I know that you are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word have no place in you it's not there my word is not but if you'll continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free right amen so if you continue in the word amen then you're going to know the truth amen but my word doesn't have any place in you the 38th verse I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen with your father so here he is talking about a lineage Who Who Are You amen who do you Bel and they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said unto him if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham and so now you know one he says I know that you're Abraham's children you are naturally yes you are amen you're that's that's who that's who your father is in a natural but there's another father there there's somebody else amen that is Father the spirit that is in you and he says in the 4 41st verse he says ye do the Deeds of your father then they say to him we be not a fornication we have one father even God so now they bring it to the spiritual we have you know it's not Abraham's Our Father our spiritually speaking God is our father so the the convert the conversation here has been that you know yeah in the natural you're Abraham's seed but in the spiritual you're not you're not and you know the scripture says uh they're not all Israel that are of Israel that's right right now let me let me give you just a little help on that they're not all Israel that are of Jacob you know Jacob is Israel so the all the lineage that is of Jacob is not all Israel they're not all Israel so so you do the Deeds of your father and mean you because you you bear the image of your father now you know I the older I get the more they say that I look like my dad I I've sounded like him for a few years every once in a while something would come out of my mouth and I say I didn't say that my dad said that that wasn't me but now the problem is is I I lost my dad uh back in 2019 I'd love to spend a day with him whatever but you know I'd love to see him but I'm getting tired of seeing him in the mirror because that's where I go I see all yeah we were sitting in in the living room one day and all a sudden Sharon go just like that I'm like what you know I thought oh no there's another snake in the house or something she said I looked over there and you look just like your dad sitting in that chair not exactly what I wanted not day here right but you begin you know you take on that image you know I I didn't do it I didn't ask hey can I look like Richard McGrady can can can I sound like him can I act like him but you know there's those traits those characteristics in the natural the seed in the natural is beginning to manifest itself more and more and more amen but God help us that the seed in the spiritual amen should be manifesting more and more and more right amen that we're bearing the image of our father amen so you do the works of your father Amen in the spirit or whatever that is you're going to produce whoever is your father you're going to produce the works of that amen that's what you're going to do in a 44th verse of John the 8 chapter says ye are of your father hey let's just cut to the chase let's just get right down to the Brass taxes here you of your father the devil and the lust of your father will you do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there was no truth in him amen the truth did not reside there was nothing there he had a desire to be like God he wanted to exalt himself into that image or that position that place amen and yet because he couldn't he didn't want anybody else to be able to get into that position either amen so he was a murder from the beginning there was no truth in him when he speak of a lie he speak of his own he is a liar and the father father of it amen and he wants to he wants to to lie to you and tell you these things so we see this amen now first John the 3 chapter and the eth verse says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so Satan's works are being manifested all around us amen and unfort some of us am me can dig back and recessive our memory and we can we can recall when we were doing some of those works yeah I heard C I'm not mentioned any names but I heard a certain man say something about smoking some good pot or something like that I don't not mention in any any names but we can every one of us most every one of us can can dig back some of us a lot worse than others a lot of things that we did maybe a lot worse than what some of others that was raised in the message you know thank God I hope I hope maybe you said yeah I remember that time I I told that lie that we was going out to eat or whatever when I was 2 and a half years old we're not going to get into mine because mine are pretty bad too so we're just going to leave it's 18 I was 18 years old and I was doing everything you could find in Ash County North Carolina to do all 20,000 people if there was problems I was looking for it because there was something that was pulling me to that right I mean I was raised a Methodist I was looking to get in every bit of trouble I could find and I found some and then I created some okay so oh the stories I could tell you but we're not going to I'm not going down what is it a rabbit hole is that what it was we're not going down that rabbit hole tonight we got to get out of here I think he just charged this microphone up for 45 minutes so I got to hurry so you know in in this 1 John third chapter verse he that committed sin is all the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose of the son of God manifest he might destroy the works of the devil hey I'm glad that he come my way to destroy the works of the devil that was being produced in my life amen because they were there I'm not going to I'm going to tell you well you know what I was always good I always believed and all these I didn't but he destroyed those Works amen of the devil amen and you know what we the Bible tells we've all seen to come short of the glory of God so don't tell me how pretty your Halo is and how brother answer how good you are amen we've all sin come short we've all was put into that category it said the verse n says who soever is born of God does not commit sin what is sin unbel unbelief amen whoever is born of God I'm going to tell you something when that doctor smacked your behind you were not born of God you were born of Mama oh y'all got quiet on me right there for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot see because he is born of God right amen so thank God there is something that you were born in the 10th verse of 1 John the 3rd Chapter in this the children of God are manifested and the children of the devil so we see amen these these two groups here whosoever do not righteous is not of God neither he that do that that loveth not his brother for this is the message you have heard from the beginning that you should love one another that is going to be the that is going to be the fruit of a Believer by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you have loved one to another amen amen you can quote all the quotes you want to amen you can carry your Bible or a message book just like the prophet of God did all you want to amen but absent of having the love the fruit of love amen in our life amen you know that is that is what tells us amen that that we are the children of God Amen look a lot of times it's hard to love somebody else that's not my message tonight let me get back to my thought here that the children of God are manifested amen the children of the devil for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that you that we should love one another and guess what it doesn't mean I love you because you don't have any faults that's right it doesn't mean that you love me because I don't have I've got plenty of faults just ask that Lolli back there she'll tell you some of them and then you if you she don't give you enough go to her son and in my daughter-in-law they'll tell you I have plenty of faults so it's not that we love one another because we don't have faults that's not it right amen not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous so we see amen that the the difference that come down here and people want to deny serpy I said well wait a minute let me ask you a question why did they when they committed sin in the garden why did they notice that and they make apron you know looks like they would have got into the to the coid mask don't e an apple no they made aprons why was it the sign of circumcision why was it a virgin birth hey but why were all these things me because it all goes back to the original sin right that polluted mankind that God's promised Abrahams guess what Abraham that's how the problem come amen but that's not how I'm going to solve it it's going to be a virgin birth it's not going to be bisexual Act Right amen so we see these things now so we find out amen that we all amen come forth amen speaking lies we all had our problems we all had the wrong attributes amen that's why Jesus told us in John the third chapter that you must he said Marvel not that I say unto you that you must be born again that you must be born again amen not that it's a good suggestion it's an idea but you must be born again he said in the fifth verse Jesus said ver I say you unto the except a man be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God Amen so a new birth is still necessary now you know I've been preaching on the seat here and I want to put this little caveat in here or disclaimer in here because a lot of times we get to preaching on seed and and and you know what we some somewhere along the way we lose the birth we lose the baptism of the Holy Ghost in that well you know I was born to seated and so and then we do damage to people I know you know as a young person as as an 18yearold when I first come in and began to serve the Lord and heard the truth and and and was making that every time that I would mess up the devil would come around to me and say well you're not seed you didn't really get the Holy Ghost that was just uh you know that was just emotion you know he began to be brother Ezra he beat me over the head that beat me over the head with that so you know I try not to do that to other people I don't want some young people say say well you know what I made a mistake I I I I I I I laughed at a joke I shouldn't laughed at or or this or that or whatever and and you the devil starts saying H you're not you might as well give up you might as well CRI because you're not seed the devil uses that so we need to be careful with that and we need to be careful that by talking about a seed that we never get away from a birth CU Jesus said Marvel not that I said to you you must be born again except you're born to the water of the spirit you cannot enter in to that into that spiritual realm you cannot enter into that Kingdom you cannot enter in to that place Amen in the spiritual realm you cannot do it except there be a birth and so we see the birth makes the difference Romans the 8th chapter the nth verse be not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if he a man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his the 11th verse but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Jesus Jesus from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit of him that dwelleth in you so what is that Spirit dwelling in you amen where did that Spirit come from when did you have that experience with almighty God when did you come and receive that that made a change in you that changed your nature from someone that would do preserve Yourself by telling a lie or doing whatever amen where did that change where did that nature change take place in you now I can go back even as a little boy whenever I like I said I was doing every right thing that I could get my hands on to do but I could always go back and say you know God was dealing with me even then and I'm so glad for that I thankful that you should be thankful for that but I still had to come to a place that there was a a a birth that took place there was a change took place in my life amen so the 13th verse of Romans 8 chapter says for if you live out the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do more mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live amen it takes his spirit amen to mortify the Deeds of the corrupt flesh amen right you don't think the flesh is corrupt go look in the mirror hey a few years ago I didn't have this this silver stuff gray silver whatever you want to call it it was all nice dark didn't have those things but it's there righten so I see the effects of the corrupt flesh right amen but the spirit amen gives us the ability to mortify those actions those deeds those desires those things of the flesh the 14th verse for as many as are L by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again into fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry because of his spirit amen we can cry ABA father that's my father amen I have a new father praise the Lord the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than ARS of God and join ours with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time any sufferings sure we all have sufferings right but the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall which shall be revealed in US amen so yeah you might be going through some things but it's going to produce something in you it's going to begin to bring out the character amen of that Spirit on the inside of you amen it begins to change amen it begins to break away the things of the flesh the desires of the flesh the the battles of the flesh amen some of these things you don't just you know hey well I Reed the baptism of Holy Ghost and and I'm a a full grown mature Christian now no you still struggle you still have battles you still have trials because there's a maturing process that is going on that is that is created remember amen that that character it is it is not a gift it's a victory right amen so you're fighting amen you're going through these battles and these struggles and it begins to produce a character in you and it's not your character amen amen it's a character of the father that begins to be manifested in you amen it's something that's begin to change in you now listen you know I know that my I've got a long ways to go I'm just going to be honest with you I've got a lot of things that I still need to overcome that I I still need to get victory over uh and so forth but thank God as as the old sister said I'm not what I used to be amen I ain't what I want to be but thank God I ain't what I used to be amen because there's that transition there amen you're going through that you're changing amen you're changing by his spirit amen as it says I think it's 2 Corinthians the 3rd Chapter and the 18th verse you're changing into that image amen by his Spirit praise the Lord amen so that's the work that is being done on the inside of us now amen John the 12th chapter and the 24th verse says verily verily I say unto you except a court of wheat fall to the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen and we know this is talking about Jesus Christ and Jesus is saying it's about himself talking about the death that he was going to die and that with his death was going to produce more of the same thing it's going to bring forth much fruit now it's going to produce more of its kind when H this death is going to produce more of this kind now you know you have to imagine how bad Satan hates this because he corrupted the original created Son of God he crucified the spoken word or the begot only begotten Son of God he defiled the whole of humanity and yet on the day of Pentecost there was 120 more of them so here he is you know he's got to think hey this is my victory i' I've nailed Christ to the cross and yet there's 120 more and before the day was over there was 3,000 more so what is that got to be I mean here's the one the architect of trying to corrupt Humanity so that Humanity cannot be in the image of God and what he destroys the only begotten Son of God the next thing he knows here's 120 more of them that are of the same spirit in the same image in the same likeness as Jesus Christ was in doing the same works that Jesus did and greater than these that shall they do amen they're doing the same thing so Satan had to hate that it had to be like a literal nightmare to say wait a minute I got rid of Jesus I corrupted all the rest and now there's 120 of them and before the sun went down there was 3,000 more on top of that hallelujah thank God you see what the baptism of the spirit of God does in your life it changes who you are if you've ever been filled with the spirit of God you know amen you can't deny it amen it did something in you amen it changed you praise God it made a difference on the inside amen so listen we know the greatness of God I take no glory on myself uh none at all me because I realize it's all him it's all Jesus Christ it's all God and so Satan took the image that God had created in his likeness and he defiled that so that was it was unrecognizable and God took those broken pieces of broken humanity and he began to call this one he began to call that one and he began to deal with that one amen he began to reach out to that when he took that broken life amen and when he put it back together it was greater than it was ever before and that's God I mean God was the one that was able to say you know what I'm going to take something that is so broken amen you know what would I be if I pulled out here in in a parking lot and a a a brand new uh what's a nice car I don't know what ice car is Bentley and a what Bley a Bley a Bentley a Ben Bentley or whatever yeah brand you I mean I mean I I I had a a developer friend he went down to Asheville North Carolina he lived in John City Tennessee went down to ice North Carolina he bought a brand new 12 cylinder Bentley and and he paid $250 $50,000 and they told him said this car will will do over 200 mil hour he gets on Interstate i 26 coming out of Ash well going back to John City he said well I want to see what this car will do this guy actually he uh he actually Ro ra raced cars and so he tromped on that car was he said when I CR the hill I was doing 180 miles hour on i 26 and other side of that hill Oh no said a State Trooper he said I let off the gas said I blew past him said he didn't even he didn't even pull out on the road he just turned his light on and said I I let off I blew past to him and I finally slowed down and stopped and said that he come up he said he come up to my window and it's like what's going on I said listen officer listen said you're not going to believe said I just paid he said right here in the seat of the car said right here I just bought this car $250,000 and they told me to do it 200 miles now if you paid $250,000 for a car wouldn't you want to wouldn't you want to know if he do what he said he would do and you not like man you're you know you pass why do you just keep going he said there's one motor you cannot run Motorola it's a radio right he said he said the officer looked at me said I Ain never seen nothing like his M he said I said I'll make a deal with you I will not give you a ticket now he said if you'll drive from here to Bristol Tennessee and not go over 55 miles an hour he said I didn't go over 50 mil an hour but he didn't get it I go 180 miles iron didn't get a ticket okay I mean broke the laws broke all these things right he mean he he done that but you know I if I drove into the parking lot with a brand new Bentley 12 cylinder 250,000 that's been several years ago and and pulled in the car you know and that was polished well I didn't do that somebody else they did that right I mean that I I didn't put a wheel on it I didn't put a lug Bol on it I you know I I just got in it and drove into the parking lot oh wow look woo I didn't do that but now if I drove into the parking lot in a 1964 Mustang that had been out sitting at a barn somewhere and it was all rusted and the motor wouldn't start and I said you know what I took that I took the engine out of that I redid the engine I rebuilt the transmission I took it down to the frame I scraped it all up I sanded it down I painted it I did all that well that's what God he did more than that when he took broken person like me when he took a broken life like me he didn't just say hey well here's somebody that was perfect here was somebody that was good here was somebody that was was righteous no he he let the he let the devil take us down to the bottom and he said Satan stand back and let me show you what I can do and he took that broken life amen sometimes you may think your life is so broken that it's hopeless that is exactly what God is looking for is a life that has broken that he may take hold of it and put it back together and say he didn't do that I did that amen the devil you did your worst but look what I did amen look what I took from your worst amen and made out of it I made something back in my image again I took something so corrupt amen something that was unrecognizable and I brought it back into my image into my image praise God that's what God does to us amen not because we were good or we was righteous or there was some Merit in us that deserved it amen or some favor in US amen it was all God so don't you ever think maybe your life is too broken God loves to take a broken life and show what he can do that nobody else can do it brother Ron cannot do that I cannot do that nobody can do that amen but God God does that right say he takes that corrupt and he makes it he produces it back and he said that seed that went into the ground said it's going to produce more fruit it's going to produce exactly what went into the ground that's right so what does the seed that went into the ground produce John the first chapter the first verse in the beginning was the word that's what was in the beginning I'm going to create man in my image in my likeness are we going to create man into that image so when that seed was produced amen we know that the the in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh in Jesus Christ right and so now he said okay here the the word that was made flesh is going to die and go into the ground it may produce more fruit the very same thing the law of God says it can't produce something different amen the word that went into the ground is going to produce word right and it's going to be produced in Us Praise the Lord it's going to bring us into the image of almighty God into the image of the word Romans 8th chapter the 29th verse for whom he did for know he also did predestinate period I don't see a period actor predestinate for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that is the word amen to be conformed to the image he didn't say hey I predestinate you I predestinate you I have pre-ordained for you to be into the image of my son into the image of the word that's what he's producing in us he's bringing us after his TI Into His Image not the image of a man not the image of society not not the image of religious people but into the image of almighty God into the image of the spoken word into the image of the Original Seed amen he is bringing us back to that amen Jehovah Gyra the second message brother Bram says and where can you put your faith on anything else but the word if God said it hold your finger to it that's true it doesn't shift it draws from the God's breasted book The Bible his attributes what he promised what he promised amen that's his word the word produces itself amen when it becomes in you amen when the life of God comes in you it produces the word it does not produce arrogancy it does not produce amen you know one thing I never met brother B I was I was less than two years old when he was taking off the scene but one thing I've heard brother Ron was the people that met him was talking about how the humility that when he walked on the platform people said you know we be S I would just be weeping and he walked walked on the platform around was like why am I weeping why am I weeping and they look around and everybody was weeping just because that humility is that the image is being produced again or is it producing arrogancy it don't if it's the word if it's the spirit of God if it's the word of God it's not good if it's the life of God is not going to produce something different right it's going to produce amen that same thing the word produces itself it's going to do that in your life right it's not you it's not you doing it it's him doing it amen praise the Lord amen in the message why little Bethlehem brother B says I mean a genuine holy baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ back into the person the life amen coming back the life of God in you you weren't born with that you were born again with that right that was a new birth amen praise the Lord you didn't just join a church and say well hey you know what all of a sudden I think I'm going to go to evening Light Fellowship and and and and no amen you're born into the kingdom of God you're born into the family of God Amen then the Holy Spirit baptism produces a life of Jesus Christ what does it produce it produces the life of Jesus Christ back amen into the person amen I don't want to be like chrisan McGrady I want to be like Jesus Christ I want to be like that's the image that I want to manifest is who he is Amen in the message God's power to transform brother R says God through a seed of his word and there is only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word and when the life that is in the word meets the life in the spirit it produces whatever the seed is amen so it takes the spirit of God you can know the quotes you can know the Bible but until the spirit of God comes in and meets the word and anoints the word amen and brings the word to life it is nothing but a dead letter right but when the SP of God comes in you it takes the word that is done on his and it begins to produce something that is greater amen than you something greater than Humanity something greater than religious acts can do something M greater than what going to church can do amen I used to think well hey if I could go get me a cabin somewhere in the Yukon or maybe up in a Rocky Mountains of Montana somewhere back off the beig path man I could live this thing anybody else ever felt like gu yeah man if I just get away from from people people are the problem I could be a good pastor if it wasn't for the people the people are the problem but I did you know that's my mentality if I can just get away from everything oh I could live this thing but I want to tell you something with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the spirit of God moving on inside of a Believer amen you can put that person in the most wicked place on the earth and it'll live the life of Jes Jesus Christ that's what he'll do praise God because it ain't you if it's me doing it yeah I got to get back somewhere where there ain't nobody else and I still couldn't do it I still couldn't do it but because it's not me it's not you see you know what people get Christians Believers get frustrated because you know they try to live for the Lord try to serve the Lord they try to do it in himself he never intended for you to do this in yourself he never tried he never intended for you to live this by your own ability or your own power if you could do it then the Jews could have done it under the law they couldn't do it and so you can't do it amen it takes him to do it it takes him to do that Amen to produce that in you it is the lifegiver to the word the Holy Ghost is the lifegiver to the word it'll make the word and you live he'll bring it from a Sunday school bi uh Bible memory verse Amen to make it something that you live praise God and the devil can't take it away from you the devil can't talk you out of it the devil can't tell you well you know what that's just fanaticism and and and and you going believe the sign somewhere no you believe the word you believe the word right and the devil can't take it away from you also in that message God's power of transform brother Bram says says what kind of seed you are that shows what's in you you can't hide it whatever you are inside it shows outside you can't keep from it you can't make the tree anything but what it is see it's going to be that way the Holy Spirit trans transforms the seeds that's on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is it'll transform it if it's evil it'll bring forth evil if it's a hypocrite will'll bring forth a hypocrite if it's genuine word of God it'll bring forth a genuine son or daughter of God that's what it's going to produce amen praise Lord you take the word you put the spirit upon it amen and it is going to produce the life of Jesus Christ nothing else will do it amen 2 Corinthians the third chapter the 6th verse says who also have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth and that's what we do we'll take this Bible right here under the anointing of a man under the anointing of a Pharisee and we will cut each other to pieces with it we'll try to bring other people down we'll try to say oh they don't believe this like this and and you know what we're you we're just trying to cut them down right we're aren't we doing what exactly what Satan did to begin well if I can't be like God I'm just going to cut down man so man can't be like God but that's what a lot of times we do with a lad we start cutting one another down well if I can't get up there and be holy and pi and and be be like Jesus Christ well I sure don't want brother Ezra to be I'm going to tell you about brother e he thinks he just a hypocrite he just thinks is see that's what that's what we do with the word we try to destroy one another with the word but that is not Jesus Christ he come to destroy the works of the devil that's what it said amen not to destroy each other you're supposed to love one another amen right amen not destroy one another the letter kth but the spirit giveth the life so yeah if we if we just got the letter oh my it's all dos and don'ts and I can't do this and I got to do that and this and so on and if I don't if I don't do this and the pastor man he's going to come visit me or or I'm going to get a letter from the from the trustees or or from the deacons or you know would get excommunicated from the Sunday school class or whatever if I don't do this I mean that's the letter kth but the spirit he brings it to life amen amen it gives you the ability to live it amen it does it for you praise God the message of trial and I don't think I gave this quote to the to the brothers back there I I preached different services on this thought and and I pull this one out it says brother Bram said in the message to Tri says now these men claim they believe but the Holy Spirit knew know nothing about it and he's the only one who can Quicken it just like your body here see your body is dead without the spirit so is the word of God dead without the Holy Ghost to Quicken it the spirit quickens the body and the Holy Ghost quickens the word so that's why we need that new birth amen for the Holy Ghost to take the word because the word was the seed the spoken word the original right amen but it takes the life of God to make you live the life of God did you get that or I need to repeat that it takes the life of God in you to make you live the life of God you can't do it Lindsay McGrady can't do it amen it's very frustrating amen and he tells he promised the Jews this in the Book of Ezekiel the 36th chapter and the 27th verse he said I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judg judgements and do them so it's not you doing it it's the spirit my spirit that I am going to put within you it is going to bring you into Conformity to my will and my word amen not you doing it it's not that hard what's hard is when you try to do it without it because you'll never succeed you'll never you'll be frustrated you'll never succeed amen I'm I'm getting this down to a closing Point amen I think my 45 minutes is about you hear it you hear it my voice is 45 minutes is about up right first John the 3rd Chapter second verse beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen so we're going to be brought into that image we're going to be created after his kind we're going to be manifested and that's what we are now we are now the sons of God amen by the spirit of God dwelling on the inside of you amen producing the life of the word in your life praise God now listen this whole thought it started off with God's goal God has a goal to produce Jesus Christ in us that's his greatest goal is to produce Jesus Christ in us heyen he don't want you to be like me he wants you to be like him amen amen he wants you to be in His image he wants you to think like he thinks he wants you to respond like he responds he wants you to speak like he speaks I mean you go over to First Corinthians 12th chapter we got the the the the gifts right the gifts of the Spirit to make us think like God to make us speak like God Amen to make us act like God Amen so these things he's creating us back in that image again praise the Lord oh my so I'm GNA tell you something amen we we a lot of times we use that we get caught up on just being seen and and and and and and we forget somewhere that hey I need to go down somewhere and get a birth I need to bring the the the life of the spirit of God upon the word in me Amen to produce Jesus Christ you can't skip that you cannot skip that amen you can try amen how many people do you know and I know amen that maybe preached this message that are no longer preaching it preached it for years people that believe this message that you would have never ever imagined amen that they would go out into the world they'd cut their hair uh the women would put on their pants and do all these things it's because they had never had the spirit of God on the inside of them amen and I'm closing this if musicians will come back see I forgot my watch and so I left it North Carolina 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter and the 17th verse there for feing man be in Christ he is a new creature he's a new species he's not the species that was born from Richard and Lena McGrady but he's a new in Christ he's a new creature he's a new species amen he he you know what I I look at this way we're no longer a part of this uh Homo Sapien species amen now we're a new creature in Christ Jesus all things have passed away the things that we once loved that we once did that we once run to amen that's gone amen there's no longer amen you take that pig out of that pig pin wash it down scrub it down spread perfume put a bow in its High paint its toenails but the first time it gets it's going back to the bud cuz that's the nature that's in it but you change the nature that is in it and you'll change what it does you'll change the results you'll change its characteristics amen and that's what it does all things have passed away behold all things are become new that's what Jesus Christ does in you thank you amen the spirit of God on the word anointing the word in you the The Original Seed amen producing the same thing amen let's stand to our feet tonight amen I don't know I have no idea what songs you may have to go with that message tonight amen but it still takes somewhere meeting Jesus Christ out there in the Woodshed out there on the back side of the desert down at an altar at your bedside wherever it may be amen not just say well you know I I I go to church I believe the message I believe the truth the devil does too but that doesn't make him into the image of God just because he believes the message he believes it more than you believe it he knows it's more true true then you know that it's true but that don't make him a Believer that's right that does not make him in the image of Jesus Christ there's only one thing that's going to do that it's whenever his Spirit comes upon the word in your life and then it's going to cause you to walk after his statutes his judgments his Commandments his word it's no longer you doing it it's him amen you know now somebody comes against you does something to you you get upset about it but when the spirit takes control in you it becomes you respond as Jesus responded and Jesus you know he said over there Matthew the 5th chapter the 44th verse he says but I say unto you love your enemies now look it's easy maybe to love your brother we're supposed to do that it's easy maybe to love your neighbor gets a little bit harder but he says love your enemies love your enemies that takes Jesus Christ amen you can't fake that that's right you cannot fake that that's where it comes down is do what I what I have is it real or is it just religion do I love my enemies can I love that one that don't love me can I love that one it talks back about me that's when the spirit of Jesus Christ becomes truly manifested in our lives amen and at this end time he's going to have a bride that's going to be manifested word she's going to be that image she's going to be the image amen let's
