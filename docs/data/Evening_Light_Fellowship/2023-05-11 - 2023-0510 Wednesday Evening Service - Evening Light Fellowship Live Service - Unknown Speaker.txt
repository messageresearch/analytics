is a Waymaker amen ask brother Russell to take these needs and before he before he comes we'll read these needs and I want to sing the song soften my heart with oil so easy to get the seem a little Brash maybe a little calloused as the world is a tough place to survive in as we're not of this world but our daily prayer should be God just come Lord brother Ron's been preaching on perfection you know what we can't be perfected without perfect love but truly that's Perfection and you know what I'm not there yet I'm just being very honest I don't know who's had an easy week and Satan took it off and just let you just have an easy week no sir every inch of this ground we're gonna fight for it because God equipped Us by his word amen I believe that brother Warren has turned into requests he says please pray for the family we'll be traveling to Florida this Friday for church meetings they will be back next Thursday any man would pray the Lord just be with them and keep them safe this is from Sister Suzanne since her husband has passed away it's been very really hard for Michigan she just came out of surgery and had a pacemaker place pray for a quick recovery and comfort Ximena she's been here and visited several times she's a very sweet lady and she's alone then I pray God just be her overwhelming portion God bless sister Suzanne for being there for for amen Ben Lau turns into request to pray for sister Lori she's not at home not feeling well and then a special unspoken request here for Brother John Lyle God knows the need would lift it before him knowing the Lord is the he makes a way man this is from Sister Molly I believe it's sister Molly Johnson please pray for Sylvester for Maryland the doctors thought her body was rejecting her kidney transplant but they found out it's that the kidney function is down to only 25 percent this is causing issues with her sugar levels and her blood pressure she also has a has had a brain aneurysm she is really needing a miracle she asked me to thank you for your prayers amen thanks in advance knowing that we will do our job and we will hold her before the throne knowing that God is a Waymaker and you know what this just tells me hey the doctors may be they maybe they've reached their end but you know what the Lord that's where he steps in and takes over because he's the only one who can completely restore this sister brother Sylvester whoever it is the Lord knows and he will meet that need amen and I wrote down here Sister Ann lovell's nephew Caleb I'm not sure how old he is he had convulsions this afternoon it was taken into the hospital he is stabilized but we're trusting and asking for prayer that God will give him a full recovery I wanted to mention my father-in-law brother Brian yeski has put his back out he's at home they're streaming I pray the Lord will go and just be as fortunate to touch him and continue to be with brother Neil Mater as he is still healing from his surgeries and he's going to enter the phase of you know his physical therapy and his Prosthetics and you know just pray God be with him every inch of the way amen and then sister Rebecca page is still going through her chemo we just want to keep her lifted Before the Throne and Theo's doing quite well I just thank God for the mercies that have been put on his life and I believe every day he's just a little bit closer to his complete deliverance I'm going to continue to remember also little Josiah McGrady I don't know exactly what all surgeries he's having or you know where he's at in his his healing because I believe it is a healing and I believe God is going to restore him 100 so let's sing this a lot of needs but you know what we serve a big God amen there's not one of these needs he didn't know about before the foundation of the world and he he gave it he equipped us to speak the language it's the language of his word and it's a Living Word and we don't speak our words but we speak the words of life because he gave us a book of life amen do you believe that absolutely let's sing the soften my heart [Music] open my eyes [Music] open my eyes to see fill me with understand me soften my heart [Music] your desires for me Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] Christ [Music] increase [Music] [Applause] could I just give a testimony also if you haven't heard probably where that we're just two weeks ago we were at brother Gustav and sister Anita's in Germany and mayor Elise McGarry's parents there in Germany and he had just the day before had a biopsyonic growth on his neck and but they were so hospitable and so nice to us while we were there and I'm sure on their mind was this this you know whether it be cancer or and it was a cancerous but just as I understand today they've determined that it has not spread anywhere else it's very localized here and it's it's treatable and so we're very thankful for that report for brother Gustav there in Germany thank the Lord shall we bow our heads Heavenly Father we're thankful for this time in the middle of a busy week to come together and to quieten ourselves in thy presence Lord we're so glad have a hiding place and that's in the Jesus Christ and we're so glad to be separated from the world and the chaos of this Satan's Eden that's amongst us and about us Lord so thankful to be a separated people Lord many needs had been mentioned across this desk tonight and so many very serious ones and Lord but as our brother said we serve a big God and Lord there's not a sparrow falls to the ground but what you know it so you are so aware of each one of these these are your children Lord and nothing comes our way lest first it passes through thy hand so Lord we have confidence that you're undertaking for each one of these needs and we bring them before you as we've been taught to do and place them at thy Throne of Mercy Lord we thank you now again we ask thy blessings upon the service in each part upon your children gathered here Lord we commit ourselves to thee and to thy keeping in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you can have your seats also brother Ron is traveling he will be back and uh we'll lift up this prayer request

your inheritance for this this is the year but you believe arise be not entangled with the Yoke of bondage understand the Liberty by which Christ set you free entangled with heavy chains of captivity bruised and battered by sin oh [Music] god there was no peace Within but then the sound was heard it was like the abundance of rain saying rejoice [Music] men except the pardoning word which was provided for you because you're not of the Bond woman you're of the free so rise possess your inheritance for this is the Year of Jubilee arise be not entangled with the Yoke of bondage understand the Liberty by which Christ set you free aren't you tired of living under privileged don't you don't you hear that sound saying freedom to the captive restoration to the blind mind is free those who are bruised thanks empty your vessels and let him fill them with oil cause you are free you are free you are free and when the Creditor comes to take away your land show him your account settled long ago

there's only one way to the father and that's through the son amen absolutely tired of living underprivileged some good lyrics in that song I tell you what we don't have to live under privilege amen he said he give us the inheritance this he gave us a deposit on this side of Glory because it'd be like harnessing electricity in a paper sack if he poured all himself into us right in this flesh we couldn't take it hey man let's stand let's sing this song Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord you know friends a lot of people can read the word amen it's true you know what there's people that read the Bible every single day there's a lot of the amount of Revelation that God has bestowed on the free adventure of this life but in this age amen just think that this book is an open book we're very very privileged people and where there's a lot of Revelation there's a lot of requirement you man to be Gods hands and feet the prophet he told a story he said this was after his commissioning and he knew he was the seventh angel messenger he asked the Lord he said forgive me God for he'd lean on this gift and even in the name of doing something for the Lord which is the right reason for any Christian the prophet and his Humanity would still lean on the gift God show him a vision he repented he said God forgive me you still give me a vision and still got talked out of doing it think about that friends now you know why brother Ron's preaching on our perfection because we're really hard on ourselves but the moral of that story was the prophet says God is a gentleman he's not shoving no one through a door he's not forcing our hand on anything and his program is paralyzed if we can't be his hands and feet do you believe that yes Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord [Music] [Music] Open the Eyes of my heart [Music] Open the Eyes of My Heart I wanna see Lord I wanna see oh I want to see [Music] to see you I am lift it up shining in the light of your glory for me pour out your power and love we sing Holy Holy God [Music] will always [Music] pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy Jesus [Music] all I want to see [Music] you Lord praise the Lord there we go it takes somebody that knows what he's doing with these things to fix them God bless you this evening it's good to be gathered in his name isn't it there's no other place in the house of the Lord let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we certainly appreciate this opportunity Lord that we can be gathered together and we know that your word says where two or more are gathered in my name there I'll be in their midst and we know father that when you're amongst us that you do Mighty things and so we're expecting this evening Lord for you to do Mighty things because you are a almighty God and there's nothing Lord that's too difficult for thee and so these requests and everything Lord that has been brought before us this evening we're trusting that you're going to meet every single one of them Lord for it's by faith that we can accept that I ask that you would bless your word Lord bless it to our lives Lord our desire is that we would have a closer walk with you we love you we thank you for all things in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this evening uh we greet you in the name of Jesus Christ to our regulars our visitors our online streamers may God's blessings be upon you uh turn with me to the Book of Psalms chapter 22. and we'll read from verse 7 down to 19. thank you musicians and uh I'll be traveling here next Monday I'll be going back to Ireland to to see my parents and so I appreciate your prayers for traveling mercies and I just keep my mom in your prayers also uh having a hard time with her health there and stuff and um you know the worst thing about being sick is waiting on a diagnosis so she's been waiting since January for them to try and figure out what's going on and uh uh you know you got Dr Google where you can look up symptoms and everything like that and uh kind of makes you think the worst so that's why I've kind of held back and saying you know what it is because we really don't know so it is not a a goodbye trip I am not going to Ireland to say goodbye to my mom I'm going to encourage her to encourage my dad to lift them up to pray for them that's all we can do isn't it so we covet your prayers and I know my parents do also so Psalm chapter 22 and verse 7. and it says uh uh all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but Thou Art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts I was cast upon thee from the womb Thou Art my God from my mother's belly be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help there's only one place that we can go in a time of need and that's God many bulls have come past me strong Bulls of Bastion have beset me round they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like Wax it is melted and melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a pot shirt and my tongue Cleaves to my jaws and now has brought me into the dust of death for dogs have come past me the Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierce my hands and my feet I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture be not thou Far From Me O Lord my strength Hasty to help me amen Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6. and we know that that scripture there is is a prophecy of the sufferings of Christ Philippians chapter one and verse 6 it says being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen you may take your seats this evening being confident of this very thing not confident in our own abilities not confident in what we have to offer or anything that we can do be being confident in this one thing that God will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ God has begun the work and God is going to finish the work that he has begun amen I would like to title my sermon this evening it is finished with the subject of God always finishes what he has started God is not like you and I where he starts uh a honeydew here and there and and he never gets around to finishing it he hasn't a bunch of things that are left undone like like us or perhaps I'm the only one that's like that around the house it it seems like I I get a bit of encouragement and a little bit of enthusiasm and and I'll get to that honeydew list and I'll start five of them and I won't finish one of them and so but God is not like that when God starts something he always finishes it and that's where our hope and our confidence lays is that if God started something in our lives if God started something in the lives of our children our family members our loved ones or whatever it may be we know for a fact that God is going to finish that work he is not a quick start he is not one that does something haphazardly but he is a God that finishes finishes everything that he starts you say well brother Stephen uh I can see a bunch of things in my life and I haven't gotten a complete deliverance yet just hold on because if God has started the Deliverance if God has started the healing in our lives God is going to finish it what a confidence that we can have in a God Like That Hallelujah so when we look back into Genesis which is the first book of the Bible we see that God began something and we can call it he began creating and so we find out that the Bible says that God created the heavens and the Earth and there was a period geologists and people who study rock formations they say that the Earth is millions of years old and they'll they get paid a lot of money and they and they take this rock and they'll find this bone and they'll find these these this artifacts of of history and they'll come up with these numbers and they'll say well well this rock is is 10 million years old and this is this one is this many years old and this one is this many years old and the critics they they try to take this information and they try to disprove God's word by their science which is kind of funny they've been trying to do that since the beginning of time and still they can't disprove God's word because they say well the Bible says isn't that how Satan likes to work he likes to try to use the word and say well uh didn't Satan take Jesus up onto a high mountain one time and say well the it is written that if if you if you if you fall uh you know you won't get hurt you'll not Dash your foot off a rock what is he doing he's he's using the word but we can you can't combat the word by the word but Jesus did he said it is also written so Satan tries to come at us sometimes and and you think wow well it's the word and I don't see what happens is when we don't have a full understanding of the word the word will never contradict the word right but when it seems like there's a contradiction within the word it's because of the lack of our understanding and so I say God help us with our understanding this evening I need to relax myself a little bit a little nervous would you be nervous if you were up here [Laughter] bless you foreign so we find out that these uh archaeologists and these different uh geologists and different people they they take these formations and they try to disprove God's word but the Bible says and brother Branham taught us very clearly that in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God and we find out that when he began to create the heavens and the Earth he created the heavens and the Earth and there was a period now brother Branham said that every seed laid within the Earth at that time he said but it might have taken x amount of years for this seed to come forth but yet it still came forth how long was it brother Stephen how long did it take we don't know in verse 2 it says that the Earth was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep this Earth it was without form it was void it was it was shapeless have no real purpose for anything it was in a place of Darkness it was form of life it was it was void of life it was void of light it was an empty place it was a wasteless place it was it would seem that the Earth at this time within the scriptures wasn't worth anything it wasn't good for anything it was it was full of Darkness it was it had it was void of everything that that that would seem uh uh that that it could have been of use for it was just a dark chaos of nothing but then God said let there be light and we realized that there was light and so we could say within ourselves at one point in my life I was as the Earth was in Genesis 1. this Earth I was void of life I was living in darkness I was I was wasteless I was a I was a sinner I was a person that was of of an unclean nature it seemed that I was void of anything good at odd no direction I was just turned upside down and it seems like everything we touched nothing would work out this Earth that was void it was void of something what was it void of it wasn't void or empty of the things of the world but it was void of the word of God but when God spoke to our hearts and he said let there be light there was something that changed in our lives this Earth that was once void and seemed useless now started to change it now started to turn around because where there is light there is life Hallelujah you see before a seed can germinate it must first have life in it because brother Branham said that the seed already laid within the Earth but now when he began to say let there be light that sunlight now began to germinate the life that laid within the seed that was laying within the Earth and so when God speaks to our hearts and he says let there be light that seed that was already in this earth though it was overshadowed and it was clouded by darkness and the filth of this world when God spoke to our hearts when God said let there be life in that seed that I've predestinated before the foundations of the world there was no Darkness there was no emptiness there was nothing that was uh covering the seed that could prevent it from coming to life why because when God says something it must come to pass now before a seed can germinate it must first have life laying within it the seed before it can bring forth life it first has got to rot now that's why Jesus said he who comes to me they must come and die we must die to ourselves we must die to our flesh why because something has got to rot in order for the life of God to come and make itself manifest in our lives when a seed begins to grow we find out that its roots begin to dig down deep and when the root of a seed begins to push down there's only one place that that seed can grow and that's upwards when the seed is in the ground there's only the only friends that this seat has are a bunch of animals of the dark a worm or a slug or a snail something dirty that's laying within the dirt but when they're seated it begins to look around at the beginning it thinks well that's who I am also because you're a you are who you associate with but all of a sudden when life begins to take forth and something happens in the G the seed germinates there's only one place where we can look and that's upward and so now we find that when a seed begins to grow it grows past the Slugs and the snails and the filth that's within the ground because there's something that's pulling the seed higher because there's a warmth that's coming from the Sun and it's drawing the life out of the seed because there's something that lays within the seed that must be manifested so it is with a son or a daughter of God we might have been out and influenced by people of the world and influenced by the different ones at school and work but when God spoke to our hearts and the warmth of the son began to draw us up higher we begin to say I don't need these things in my life anymore I don't need these people in my life anymore I don't need to watch those movies I don't need to listen to that kind of music why because there's something that's drawing me higher at the beginning you don't know what it is you don't understand what it is but all you know is that there's something that's drawing you to a higher place than what you were before it's nothing but the word of God a lot of people like myself you know we uh I wasn't raised in church or anything like that and so when I first went to church my the word of God had such an effect in my life but there's many people that they go to church for years they're raised in a message Church they're raised in a message family but yet their seed has never been germinated just because you go to a message Church it does not mean that you're a believer because you've got to be born again of the spirit of God I really love the ah the thought of the new birth and you say well brother Stephen uh because a lot of people they like to put a timeline on it well at this point yeah I accepted Christ and at this point and at this point and and at this point we try to figure it all out and well brother Branham says it this way at one spot and he says it this way in the one spot and and and and I want to figure out whether I've been truly born again or not your life will be manifested and it'll make it known if you've really been born again or not but just because somebody uh because brother Branham said that you can be justified without being sanctified and you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost so you can believe onto eternal life so because if one person accepts Christ as their Savior and they say a sinner's prayer and their life has changed does that mean that everybody else has to have the same experiences that person had water blood spirit is a birth brother Branham said all three can happen at one time but yet you can be justified without being sanctified you can live a clean life without being born again I just love it the problem is with us we try to make everybody else come through the same steps and process that we came through but because we're individuals God does something different for each one of us and so just because you haven't went through a same experience to a new birth in Christ Jesus as somebody else it doesn't mean that yours is wrong and theirs is right but watch your life watch the manifestation of your life watch the continual growing of your revelation of the word and that'll tell you if you have it or not so don't get caught up with will uh I had an experience with God here and one over here and one over there but somebody said that that wasn't right no you make your calling and your election sure and if you believe that you had an experience with God you hold on to that experience amen we don't want no copycats but we want real genuine Believers in God who are standing Upon A firm foundation that know they've had some kind of experience with the Creator of the heavens and of the Earth a lot of people feel like uh well it was that one sermon when it happened it was that one sermon that that that one preacher preached and and that was the one that was the one that really changed my life there was something that was going on in the heart of your life way before that sermon was ever preached because you might not know it but there's something that's been drawing us and drawing us and it's the holy spirit it's the word of God and so we might not recognize it but when we come to church on a Wednesday night you know what God is doing God is drawing us closer to him he is revealing a little bit more of himself to us through the ministering of the word so it's not just one sermon it's not just one special preacher but it's a continual washing it's a continual drawing and pulling by the Holy Ghost by God himself that brings the change in our lives I say God continue to draw us oh praise the Lord I've been saved I've been born again I I've been adopted into the family but I don't want to just stop there I don't want to just rely on an experience of two years ago but I want to have a continual experience with God I want to have an experience today that I had last week I want God to continually make himself known and real to me too many people live you ever hear Brother Brown I'm talking about living in the glare of another age too many Believers are living in a glare of history in their lives well when I was younger I used to do this and praise God I used to fast and pray well what are we doing now what has God done for us today we can't live in the glare of yesterday but I want to live in a very present experience with God amen so when God spoke to our hearts and he said let there be light we see that God drove back the darkness he drove back the unbelief that we might live and walk in light because where there's light there is life and when we're walking in the light of the hour we're walking in the life of the hour which is Jesus Christ amen Fellowship 1956 brother Branham said greatest Miracle ever performed when God can take something and convert it and bring it back to itself again just the same as you could take an animal by science and drop a little drop of water on top of a hog and make it a lamb now that's the miracle of it has taken uh a hog and putting a drop of water on it and changing it into a lamb he's saying that's the miracle of being born again he said that's the miracle of it change his whole nature appetites attitudes everything that's what God does when he saves a man from sin he changes his entire makeup he says so no greater miracle any part of Divine Healing that I've ever seen and I by the grace of God I've seen pretty near everything that I could ever think of or hear of done by our lord Jesus even to raising up the dead after they were gone and still I think that salvation is the greatest miracle how many miracles have we seen amongst us where God has taken a life and he has changed it he has transformed it not by uh not by uh conforming people but the power of transformation by the word of God what a miracle it is that God can take our desires our attitudes our carnal nature the things that we thought we once loved and now when you look at those things you think my goodness what a wretched person that I was you know the changing never stops but God's going to continue to change us until finally this dirty vile wretched body that we live in it is going to be changed Hallelujah what a miracle so God said let there be and there it was the trees the animals the fowls of the air and it kept coming higher and higher until there was something in his very image we find out that on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made you see God always finishes what he starts he began to create he began to do those things he he began to this plan that was in his mind he began to unfold it until he got to a certain place he said I'm done with creation I have finished I have started it but now I have finished and I'm going to take my rest so we find out that everything and at this time it was perfect everything was in harmony there was no sickness no there was no growing old there was no heartaches it was just a wonderful place to be in until one day we know the story that Eve had a conversation with the serpentine he beguiled her we know the story which means he seduced her with words you know Satan never changes his tactics if somebody it's kind of hard you know if somebody's just giving you all these accolades and all these accolades and all these accolades oil are you trying to seduce us with words right now I am not a critical person but by Nature I'm skeptical why why why why do you want to tell me I'm so great you're all going to tell me afterwards you're the worst you couldn't even turn on your mic you were stumbling with your words at the start you're the worst preacher in the LF I'll be thinking praise the Lord I won't be critical skeptical if Eve just would have been a little skeptical and been like hey why are you talking to me my husband isn't here you've got no business talking to me while he's not here things might have been a little bit different hallelujah it's one of those things isn't it can you imagine being adamant coming home and now Eve is trying to seduce Adam can you imagine coming home and you're finding some other person talking to your wife trying to partake of this forbidden fruit you got to be kidding me what love he had for his wife Maya would disgust us you imagine even at the supermarket somebody trying to talk to your wife I don't know about you but I'm a Capricorn that would be very hard to deal with that's my wife he got no business being here get out of here that's right brother Branham taught us he said if if you go to a person's house or to a brother's house and and he's not there and the wife is just there all alone and she says well just come on in he he just went to get gas in the car and and he'll be back any minute now what do we do as men do we go inside oh that would be wonderful give me a cup of coffee and a biscuit that would be really nice let's sit and have Fellowship brother Branham taught us he said no you wait in the car you go for a drive you go somewhere until he comes back because we never put ourselves in questionable situations and so it is well I might as well just go ahead so it is with young people I can say it I guess I'm the youth leader don't put yourselves in questionable situations I don't think we should be the youth should be riding Alone Together boys and girls even if there's a complete trust with the two of them there's a complete trust with the family it's a questionable situation and now rumors start oh well did you see this then did you see that and well what if they didn't get home to this time of night what happens is now it starts rumors that aren't true so how do we prevent it from happening you prevent the situation from happening that's good isn't it you know what it does kind of preaching it keeps us out of trouble accidents happen people fall wrong things happen which should not happen but if the situation would have been prevented things would have been different so we shouldn't be lowering the standard but we should be keeping it high and we should be trying to raise this standard he said well we know these things brother Stephen we need to be put in remembrance of these things because we have to watch that we get if we get too comfortable one with another well it's okay it's okay for me to do this it's okay to wait in the house with her it's fine we're we're friends we've been longtime friends no it's not maybe that's a standard of denomination but brother Branham brought us to the higher standard in Christ to protect us to keep us away from these situations in our lives amen now everybody's going to be having a hard time getting to the wallaces at the weekend who am I gonna ride with figure it out foreign so we find out that it seemed that Satan had interrupted the plan of God but what Satan didn't know was that God had other thoughts in his mind that he wanted to bring to pass because that's what this life is all about really when you think about it this this life that we live in Christ it is all a part of God's Great drama and so we might think well why is this happening and why does that happen and why and why well it happens because it's a part of God's plan and that we are just actors that are acting out our parts in the great drama of God and so I say father let me live my part let me play my part and let me play it well whatever that may be that you have for me I believe that sometimes things happen in our lives and I'll take this example sister joy for example sister Joy when she was diagnosed with the cancer and she got sick and her hair was falling out and all these different things um I remember so then at that time I believe my mom was diagnosed with another form of cancer and so but my mom would watch sister joy and the things that she would post on uh social media and she always had a smile on her face and she always had uh an air uh Aura of uh of of of it um what's the word that I'm looking for positivity and there was always something that my mom could see through what she was posting online and it gives my mom the faith to say well if she can be positive while going through this situation and if God can touch her I believe he can do the same for me and so what happens is she was playing her part with the positive attitude though the circumstance was terrible there's nothing worse than a sister in this message to lose her hair but yet look at her life look at her hair it all grew back it's beautiful why because there was a right attitude towards the situation and it helped those that were around her those that were watching the situation and it comforted and it encouraged them also sometimes God will put us through something and I've said it before but it's for someone else that they might take courage from that same situation so God help us to have a good attitude because you never know who's watching so we find that now God began his great Plan of Redemption because he had a plan in his mind that he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be all these different things and and Satan didn't know that he was playing right in to the plan of God and so now God began to speak with Abraham he began to speak with Isaac and Jacob and from Jacob onto the 12 Patriarchs and we find out that what God was now doing he was starting to he was starting to fulfill his plan of of Israel now becoming a nation notice this in the Feast of the trumpets brother Branham said now notice now exactly that continue uh continuity of the scripture exactly the same under the seventh trumpet as to Israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church we find under the seventh seal that when these Souls that was under the altar there they received robes they were given robes not that they earned them because they were in the dispensation when God was still dealing with Grace with the Gentiles not Jews Israel is saved as a nation God deals with Israel as a nation Gentiles is a people for his name not a nation for his name so God began with Abraham what was he doing he was building a nation for his namesake not a people for his namesake but he was beginning to get a nation that they would serve him that he would be their God God that he would be their ruler and so he began this work in Abraham and we find out in the Book of Revelation that he finishes up this work in the tribulation period through the 144 000. so God now he started in a with Abraham and he finishes the work in the Book of Revelations you see God always finishes what he starts now from that from we see that God began to speak through man from Genesis to Malachi foretelling of the Messiah that would come and save the people from their sins Moses said the Lord your God will raise up a prophet likened unto me Isaiah 50 verse 6 it says I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I hid not my face from shame and spitting Isaiah 7 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel Zach Zachariah 9 verse 9 Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout o daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly in writing upon an ass and upon a cult the full of an ass Malachi 3 verse 1. behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he delight and behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts so we realize that all these scriptures are foretelling of a future event and they're foretelling foretelling of a messiah that would come he would be smitten he would be bruised for our iniquities by his stripes we would be healed he would be the Messiah he would be the one that would come and save his people so God said that a virgin shall conceive in Isaiah and 740 years later it's recorded in the Book of Matthew the first chapter you see God finished the prophecy that he had began through the men of old through this new testament scriptures Now understand that because it doesn't happen immediately it does not mean that it's not true 740 years later they were looking for this Messiah but when God speaks something it's got to come to pass God is not a God who is bound by time it is but a split second within his mind that his word is fulfilled so don't get all caught up well what about California and what about these different things that was prophesied and x amount of years later it hasn't come to pass don't worry about it if God spoke it it'll come to pass if it's thus saith the Lord it cannot not come to pass so God finished the prophecy of Zechariah 9 9 and Matthew 21 1-7 and what we remember as Palm Sunday now we come to the time of the Cross there is more scriptures that came to pass in the last few hours of his life while he was on the cross and throughout his entire life talking of Jesus what happens when scriptures begin to unfold and they begin to come to pass guess what it's like a it's like Dave Ramsey's Snowball Effect it just gets bigger and bigger and faster and faster and before you know it all these prophecies that we were once waiting on guess what they're all fulfilled in the click of a thumb so we find out that when Jesus hung in the cross he said it is finished what was it exactly that was finished it was the Plan of Redemption was complete God had finished what he had started and he made a way back to the Tree of Life Fellowship had once again been restored to man that Adam had once lost so he began this work and he began to speak through the prophets but there was a time now that this work became finished because God always finishes what he starts so we find out that at the cross now there was a changing that had happened there was a changing of dispensations we find that now God turned from the Jews to the Gentiles and we realized that God now began another work where he was calling out a bride now because he's wanting a fellowship and an intimacy that is far closer than what he had had before and so now he brings this bride and and he brings her out through seven Church ages from Ephesus to laudiusia we see that he sent the messenger and that messenger had a message for the elect of that age and what was he doing he was calling a bride out of a church why did he want a bride so he could share his secrets with her things that had been hidden since the foundations of the world guess what this bride in this last day shared it with her shared it with her through the revelation of the word through the opening of the seals and now we can have a relationship with God that has never had before since the beginning of time hardly since the fall of Adam why because it is an open book it is a book that has been revealed there has been nothing that has been left out others in history have probed at this book they have guessed at it they have wandered at it but before our wandering eyes guess what God has done he has opened this very book before us what happens is with us as we get to accustomed to it I've heard that before yeah I know that I've listened to the seals I know this horse rider I know this yeah yeah I know that we get too used to it but guess what when brother Brandon was preaching these things these things had never been taught before and I believe that the moment we get so arrogant that we say ah yeah I've heard that a billion times I know that when you become a know-it-all you because you don't know nothing at all when we become a new it all guess what God can't reveal himself any more to us because he won't deal with an arrogant Spirit like that so God help us to stay humble God help us to say to stay sincere in heart and spirit before him that if he has anything else he wants to reveal to us that our hearts would be open to receive it God take away the arrogance out of our lives happens so much as message believers especially when we speak on denominations huh ah they're all just wrong they're wrong mystery Babylon this and that yeah your spirit is wrong what happens if there's someone within that denomination that God wants you to speak to they'll never listen to an arrogant Spirit I'll never have a friend outside of the message in another church nonsense how are you going to win anybody well we get so arrogant we get so caught up in our own little selves well everything's wrong and this is wrong and I've heard people preach before and you know and and all the only Revelation that they have of the message is that denominations are wrong good grief man maybe because they're arrogance that's why God only reveals a little bit to them but if they just humble themselves there's a lot more to this message than the nominations being wrong there's a lot more to this message than women you know wearing short skirts and not cutting her hair this message is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ himself and when we have that relationship with God guess what happens the arrogance goes away those things the immoral dress the bad conduct the things that we say that we shouldn't say guess what it begins to fade away why because God is doing a work in our lives and our friendship you know what happens the closer you get to somebody you become more like them you ever notice that if you come and work with me for a week I guarantee you you'll pick up on words that I say and you'll be saying them in the second week for a while it was sure oh yeah sure sure and you don't realize it until somebody tells you hey you say sure a lot don't you sure yep sure do why is it because the more time that you spend with somebody that's why they say the longer that a man and a woman is married the more alike they become they even start to look alike why because they're they're they've spent so much time with each other that they become one with one another she finishes his sentence she he knows exactly what she likes to buy and on and on and on why because their relationship is close so it is with us and God the closer that we get with God the more that we read his word the more light that has shown in our hearts guess what the more of God we become and the more of God we begin to project how do I become one with God get in Christ spend time with them spend time in his word amen if the musicians come we'll bring this to a close so we find out that God began to pull a bride in the first church age of the Gentiles and God finishes with the Gentile dispensation when the last one comes into the body and takes their position within that body then the Rapture takes place see God started with the Gentiles at the time of the cross and God finishes up with the Gentiles when the last one takes their position within the body you see God always finishes what he started so what about you and I let's bring it down home so much of the time we we think well I don't know what the future holds and I don't know about this and my loved ones sick children sick family members whatever it may be Lord I don't know how it's going to end just rest assured in this one thing if God has started a work in your life we've seen it throughout the scripture God is going to finish it if God had started a healing within the the body of one of your children or whatever it may be little Theo little Josiah guess what what God the healing that God has started he is going to finish it because God always finishes what he starts he's not out here like us and he is a bunch of half done things around no no no no that's not how God works so we ought to have confidence tonight in God and in his word we have seen this pattern throughout the scripture simple sermon tonight I I fell over my words I oh whatever it was human because humans have mistakes I don't pay no attention to that look at the thought throughout the scripture look at the pattern and the examples because there's scriptural examples are given to us that we might follow the pattern to see what God done there that he'll do it again here so if he started something throughout the scripture and he never and he always finishes it he'll do the same for us as Believers in our lives therefore there's nothing to worry about there's nothing to worry about well what happens or what if that doesn't happen being confident of this very thing this very thing that he who began this work he is able and he is going to finish it when's he going to finish it I don't know I don't need to know but all I know is this thing it's finished so take confidence tonight and say Lord here is my life here is my situations here's what I'm going through here's what's happening Lord I know that you know but I want to tell you anyways I want to tell you what's on my heart I want to tell you what I'm feeling I I want to tell you what I'm going through but I know Lord that you begin something he began to do something I can see the change so now I'm expecting you Lord to finish it Allelujah let's Stand Together [Music] if we could have the words please

torment was so strong and he said you're gonna get up and testify I'm sorry he was sorry he wasn't here but the Lord just spoke and said the work's been finished Hallelujah you have the Lord some praise this evening now if you would have seen my mom sister Tracy a year and a half ago you would not think that's the same lady now to show that when God does something he does it perfectly brother Ron prophesied he said you're going to testify in front of the church at that time in her life there was no way now to show that God when he does something he completes it we just went on a vacation last week Ashlyn and I and our cousins Olivia and Ethan Strayer we got five kids eight years old and younger Tracy took care of them all by herself oh wow if you know the stress of five little kids
