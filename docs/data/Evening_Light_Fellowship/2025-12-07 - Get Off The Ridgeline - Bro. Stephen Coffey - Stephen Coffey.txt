He said, "Out of the belly of hell," cried I. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we feel like we're in the belly of hell, Heavenly Father. But he said, "They who observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving." &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, so &gt;&gt; we lift up these needs to you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for every way that you help us and every way that you meet our needs and answer our prayers. We ask you to come on the scene for these needs this morning, Lord. And may each one turn around, Lord, to become a testimony, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help the ones that are not feeling well this morning and touch the ones, God, that need healing.

Isn't that your desire this morning? &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be able to sing songs like that together. &gt;&gt; That's what we're supposed to do. We come together, we sing psalms and hymns. But what that does is it opens up our heart. We're singing the truth. We worship him &gt;&gt; in spirit, &gt;&gt; which is he's here. &gt;&gt; We feel him. &gt;&gt; It's such an amazing thing. &gt;&gt; But also in truth, &gt;&gt; we are singing the truth. Whether we feel like it or not, &gt;&gt; we can be close to him. He's made a way for you to have that this morning. However you came into the room, maybe you felt distant from him when you came into the room, you can be close to him now. That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that a wonderful thing? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's good to be with you this morning. It's good to be here. Uh it's good to sing with you and worship with you. We've had a good weekend. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm just excited for the Lord what what what he has in store for us today. &gt;&gt; Are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I'd like to invite you, if you don't mind, while you're standing, let's get right into the word. I'd like to invite you to stand with me. Thank you, musicians. Uh, as you're standing, I'd like to invite you to turn with me uh to the book of Hebrews. It's good to see each and every one of you friends. And uh well, I only have one family member here, but it's good to have all all of you friends here. &gt;&gt; Yes, we're all family. I guess in a way that's true. Uh but uh we had a good time this weekend and uh just with the older youth and the older um uh group and just going through the word in a I guess a very in-depth way, very um just took scripture by scripture and went through together and uh had a good time. I guess you'd have to ask them if it was good, but we had a I had a good time uh being with everyone and um just the fellowship that we had. We um we had some pork tacos last night that I thought were going to usher us right in to glory. It didn't happen, but I I thought it was Was it Brother Mark that smoked the &gt;&gt; Mark &gt;&gt; Brother Mark Stany? Lord bless you. Um I love poor tacos. So it was it was wonderful. We had a good time, good time together and uh I trust all that you were there uh that the Lord dropped something into your heart. He challenged you um to take another step and to go forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, that's a wonderful opportunity that the Lord has given us this morning. I'd like to read with you in uh in the book of Hebrews chapter 10. And I want to start in verse 35. Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward, for we have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto predition, &gt;&gt; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we thank you for these few moments that you've given us to gather in your presence today. We give them back into your hands. I ask that you would take complete control &gt;&gt; that you would use me uh to accomplish your will and whatever whatever that would look like. Sometimes correction it begins in the house of the Lord. Sometimes we need encouragement, instruction, guidance, whatever it would be &gt;&gt; for each individual. I pray that you would come on the scene and that you would speak to us this morning. we give you the service and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do we pray and do we ask amen &gt;&gt; and amen you can be seated thank you for standing with me uh I'm happy to have my wife Sister Sarah here and uh we've had um just a good time here and I I want to get right into the service this morning and get right into uh what the Lord has pressed upon my heart and I feel led to go in this direction I Um, I want you to pull on the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, my brain has been proven to only be able to do so much. Uh, very little actually. Uh, so if you pull on the spirit of the Lord, um, the Lord will use what little brain I have, uh, to to affect you positively and to move you a step forward. So, I'm asking every single one of you just pull on the spirit of the Lord. Let him speak to you. uh and and how he sees fit this morning. Now, this passage in Hebrews chapter 10, uh, to me, I I I was just looking at it and just going back through it again this morning, and, um, to me, it it is one of, uh, the strongest um, uh, it's it's so inspirational, but I believe it's one of the strongest exhortations that that Paul gives in Hebrews uh, about in endurance and a a steadfast faith, &gt;&gt; understanding who he's speaking to um in the book of Hebrews and I believe it's written there there are a lot of uh warnings and there are a lot of uh admonitions here in Hebrews. He says a lot of things, but in this particular passage of chapter 10, he changes his tone a little bit. And I believe he addresses this endurance the steadfast faith, this exhortation to believers that were discouraged or persecuted. They were perhaps tired or perhaps tempted to draw back. You can see that very clearly by what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Uh we are not of them that draw back &gt;&gt; unto predition, &gt;&gt; but of them that believe. &gt;&gt; So he's he's referencing to those who whose perhaps their confidence is wavering. So the the tone is almost pastoral than it than it is uh condemning. And I I like that. But if you look at this church, they um they were not rebellious people. It it he he says very different things to this church than he does to the church at Corenth or even to the church at even at Ephesus or um to the church at Galat or whatever wherever it may be. He he speaks to them in a in a very comforting way. And this is the tone that we see &gt;&gt; right here before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 10, I I I don't see it being written to rebellious people, but to the weary. &gt;&gt; And that is an amazing thing. &gt;&gt; Paul is answering the question, what should a believer do when pressure gets heavy? &gt;&gt; What What do we do when life gets hard and faith when faith begins to feel costly? when you really do begin to have to sacrifice &gt;&gt; what you want or what you think. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to people who are at that point &gt;&gt; a point in their Christian walk where faith is costly. You you actually do have to lean not unto your own understanding &gt;&gt; and you really come to a place where you realize I I am not able to make it through and my own brain is not going to be able to carry me forward. I I'm going to have to genuinely rely on where my faith is anchored, which is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's who he's speaking to here. He's speaking to them that are weary, to them that are are in need of a boost of confidence. Now I look at this and when you look at this term and I was looking at this a few weeks ago uh verse 36 for ye have need of patience and I I was looking at that word and perhaps you've looked at that word and it should be very familiar to us um in the English sense but when you look at it in the Greek and and and things like that um uh and begin to really ponder on what that word looks like for you because it's one thing to read it and to believe it, but when it when it actually becomes a reality for you and you have to be patient, &gt;&gt; it may look very different than what you're looking at on the page. &gt;&gt; And so what patience actually looks like for you this morning or perhaps you've you have had to be patient and you know the challenges therein. So whatever it may look like for you, when you get down into that word, what it means, it it means unwavering endurance and a steadfast perseverance. Now, Brother Brandham preaches perseverance. I I think um I counted 11 times, but I I think it could be more. And he he entitles it perseverant. Perseverance. And uh every time and I was looking through each one of those services and the differences between the two and there's not a lot in the thought. There's not a lot of variance in the thought that he gives. He brother Benham will naturally go to different topics within the sermon and it also would depend on where he was at. But in in most all of those services, all the 11 times that he preaches that, he he gives a very clear definition as to what perseverance is, steadfast perseverance. And that is the the Greek definition. It's it's in the definition. It's in the word of patience. And Paul is here to that church, to the Hebrew church, saying, "Ye have need of patience that after that ye have done the will of God, you can receive the promise." So patience is going to be a necessity. &gt;&gt; It's it's not a um no, I don't think I'll need it. Uh I think I'm good. Uh it's you you you will have to you you have need of patience. Every one of you in this room have need of a steadfast perseverance. &gt;&gt; Now, when brother Brandham preaches that, he uses the the and he he he very clearly says the definition of what it is. It's a it's a a continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failures or opposition. It is it is continuing on. Perseverance is what happens when revelation drops into your soul. &gt;&gt; And he says that faith and and perseverance are brothers. &gt;&gt; He said when you have faith, you can persevere in it. &gt;&gt; So perseverance is uh uh it's never quitting. It's it's it's an it's a continued effort to do or to achieve something in spite of the difficulty and the failure and the opposition. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a continuing. &gt;&gt; It is a uh we persevere from the revelation that we have. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe that that that calling, the call of the Holy Spirit upon your life uh and I to me and I'll just share I'll just say it like this. To me, uh I when I witness to somebody or I share the gospel, I I always immediately I don't really go deep down into very doctrinal things right away. &gt;&gt; I always share to them what has happened to me &gt;&gt; because I want them to see that something has happened way down &gt;&gt; that I was not convinced of. Oh, &gt;&gt; nobody convinced me into the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But I share that something has happened to change me &gt;&gt; from from death &gt;&gt; unto life. &gt;&gt; I am new in I am made new in Christ Jesus. I am old things have literally passed away &gt;&gt; and there was a voice out of heaven. You look at Revelations 4 1 and 2. There was a voice out of heaven that called to me &gt;&gt; and called my name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a group out there or somewhere or some other person's name. A voice out of heaven called my name. &gt;&gt; And said, "This is the time that I want you to come up hither. &gt;&gt; I want you to be in me and I want to be in you and I I want to be in unity with you, the a member of my bride." It was a personal thing. It wasn't a doctrinal thing that I was convinced of. It was the person of the Lord Jesus Christ revealing himself to me. &gt;&gt; And when he did that, I was and I received his life. &gt;&gt; And I stepped into being a uh uh uh of the original seed, stepped into being a seed, word bride, and I stepped into being uh a manifestation of the word of God. the only grace that the person that you're talking to may actually ever experience. But when that happened in me, I I I I I wasn't convinced into it. &gt;&gt; So, nobody can convince me out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't convince me otherwise because it's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that has unveiled himself to me &gt;&gt; in in and I I walk in that newness of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'm changed. &gt;&gt; You can't convince me otherwise. &gt;&gt; I see me. I see all my failure, all my inequality, all my issues, all that I am. &gt;&gt; I see my failures. But I also see him &gt;&gt; and he is in me. It is truly a mystery unto all of us as Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Christ in us, the hope of glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am a representation of what Paul said to to the um to the Colossians. It is Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as a result, yet though I live in the flesh. Yet though I live, &gt;&gt; I live with Christ in me. &gt;&gt; He lives through me. &gt;&gt; I just it's it's there. A sheep bears wool. &gt;&gt; It just happens. And that's what's happened to me. Now, that can happen to you this morning &gt;&gt; because perhaps you are thinking here, sitting here, I don't know, but if you are, just for a moment, I I want you to understand you don't have to live like that. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live just adhering to a a set of doctrines. &gt;&gt; Uh we must be in uh in true in our doctrine, &gt;&gt; right? We must seek truth in our doctrine. But that's not what I'm I'm the doctrine or the the the words on the page don't save me. The person of the Lord Jesus Christ does &gt;&gt; and I must know him. And you can know him regardless of what you've experienced in your life. &gt;&gt; All your failures, whatever &gt;&gt; you can know him this morning &gt;&gt; in the newness of his of his life. It's it's a it can be a fresh anointing on you this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can truly know him in a in a fellowship that will change you. &gt;&gt; You you will pass from death unto life. &gt;&gt; That is available for you this morning. &gt;&gt; You have only need to receive it. &gt;&gt; Because he has already extended the offer. &gt;&gt; He is here this morning and he can give that to you. While while they yet spake, the Holy Ghost fell. But even if you need a touch after having received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you need a restoration or a touch, he can give that to you right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have that. But I I um after I have received that and I have been changed from that point from there now I can be perseverant in the truth. &gt;&gt; I can be perseverant in the faith. &gt;&gt; I can continue as the definition is of perseverance. I can continue steadfastly. I can I can have that continued effort uh in despite of the difficulty, despite of the failure and despite the opposition and the action of um uh uh of of opposition. I can persevere in the midst of it &gt;&gt; because I know who I am in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; as a walking in the light of this day. &gt;&gt; I can now continue without wavering. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Before you can be perseverant, you have to have faith in what you're trying to achieve." &gt;&gt; We must, we can be perseverant in our faith. &gt;&gt; And when Paul says this, "Cast away therefore not your confidence, which you have great recompense of reward, for you have need of patience." That patience, that endurance comes from knowing your identity in the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your, we were talking about this yesterday, your identity is not as a a a member of evening light fellowship, &gt;&gt; because what if evening, heaven forbid, what if evening light fellowship didn't exist? &gt;&gt; Then would you just be like, I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am anymore. &gt;&gt; You would still be a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And that's your identity. And the Lord has placed you in evening light fellowship &gt;&gt; to serve him and to uh uh push your shoulder to the wheel and to persevere. &gt;&gt; Your identity is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Ye have need of patience when you know who you are. &gt;&gt; That after ye have done the will of God, you might receive the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul is encouraging the Hebrews, don't cast away your confidence &gt;&gt; for yet a little while, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry. What an amazing thing. &gt;&gt; Now, I would um I'd like you to turn with me to 1st Samuel chapter 17. And I think we should come to 1st Samuel 17 frequently. Uh but I want to go here today. &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 17. Now the uh the setting of 1st Samuel 17 we see in the valley of Ilah. It was a natural uh battleground. You you you know where I'm you know you know what I'm talking about. It was a natural battleground. If you've ever been there, it's an amazing place. It's an amazing thing. And um it's a long uh flat place between two opposing ridges. And it was perfect for battle. Uh I love oldtime warfare because it it was such thought that both sides put into it. It was just, oh, this is a good place for them. This is a good place for us. Um, this looks good. We'll take it. And it happened all the way up to the uh Civil War. Um, oh, this is good ground. That's good ground. It's it's going to work for both of us. We'll come together um in a very, you know, they know what we're going to do and we know what they're going to do. And and I I just don't understand the warfare, but I guess someone did, and it seemed to work uh for them. But this is the way that warfare happened. they would come together and they would face one another and then they would encamp and they would they would uh get together and and um the in this particular case the um the Philistines were coming out from uh uh uh there a few different particular cities. There were a lot of different Philistines coming uh Philistine villages that were coming together and um the the same was also true of Israel. And then they they both armies uh the Israelites and the Philistines came together within this valley. And um this particular time, we're very familiar with this scene. Um Goliath uh very big man, very tall man. He comes out and the Philistines uh for 40 days Goliath stepped into that valley and issued the same exact challenge. &gt;&gt; Um and he he there was no um you know we're going to attack you after this and things like that. He all they did was they just sent Goliath out in in a in a means to intimidate. And we know that story very well. But what I really want you to do is at this particular moment in time, we are, you know, the story of what's happening down where Goliath is very well. Now, David is not there yet. He's off somewhere. But this is something that we're very familiar with, but I want you just for a moment to take yourself and put yourself in the shoes of one of those soldiers that are looking down into that valley. And that's a perspective that we rarely take. And I was thinking about this and I I've had this on my heart for a very long time. And the amazing thing about all of these Israelite soldiers is that they were in the promised land for 400 years, roughly 400 years. A lot of generations had passed since the Israelites had possessed the land. They they had possessed the land. Yes, &gt;&gt; they they had driven out a lot of armies. They had gone through fighting their their uh armor, the Saul's armor, it was it was um crafted to the warfare that they they had fought for many many many years. So the Israelites at this point had been in the promised land for a very long time and they they were possessing it. They had possessed it and so they were where they should be. And in this particular scenario, the Israelites are there and the Philistines are coming into the land and it's they they've they've crossed the border and they're right there and they're looking and then they send Goliath out and the Israelites the normal warfare would be okay, the Philistines are going to be here um you know Saul and the and the military people are going to and we're going to go boom boom boom boom and then uh we'll run them out and then we'll win. But this scenario is different because they sent out Goliath to intimidate. So again, now put yourself in the shoes of one of these soldiers on the sidelines because if you if if we look at it, they were precisely where they should be. They were precisely where they should have been. They were in the promised land having already possessed it. &gt;&gt; And they were suited up, armored up, &gt;&gt; having gone to war. &gt;&gt; They were not saying, "I don't care. I'm not going to go. Maybe the Philistines won't come all the way in. If they do, so what? They It wasn't the attitude here. &gt;&gt; They were at war. &gt;&gt; They were in the fight. &gt;&gt; They were suited up. They were armored. They were ready to go. They were standing on the other ridge line and they were looking down into the valley. But there was Goliath. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what I'm amazed about and I believe that if we if we see the light of this day, brother Benham said we would have seen the light of that day. &gt;&gt; But put yourself in their shoes. &gt;&gt; If you were an Israelite looking down and the challenge was send out your best champion. So all of those soldiers were like, "Okay, well who's the best champion?" &gt;&gt; And the attitude is sometimes, okay, well where are the ministers? &gt;&gt; Send them out. And the attitude is, okay, where's the champion, Saul? Saul, where's the champion? The champion's out. And it's not that they weren't um uh it's not that they weren't unwilling to fight. It's that they were just standing there in their position, suited up, ready to fight. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; But just halting &gt;&gt; and just standing in the promised land, suited up, ready for for war, standing there. And I wonder how many of us in this room either feel or are in the exact same place &gt;&gt; because these men were persevering. &gt;&gt; They were I mean look if we look at the definition now of what Paul is saying ye have need of patience. They were being patient. &gt;&gt; They were being perseverant. They they had a they were they had a continued effort to do or achieve something despite the difficulties or failure or opposition. They were suited up and they were saying okay well you know for 40 days they were saying okay well what what do we maybe we should send a champion out. Saul and everybody are trying to figure out what to do. And then the Israelites are there they haven't gone home. They haven't sherked their responsibility. It's not like they they gave up and left. They were there. They were standing there for 40 days. And Goliath is saying, "You cowards." And the enemy standing across from them is taunting them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You cowards, &gt;&gt; you say that you're the the army of the living God, but where's your champion? &gt;&gt; Come on. and he's taunting for 40 days and he's he's trying to get them to make a a move because he knows he has the advantage against uh a regular he thinks he has the advantage against a regular soldier. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the greatest of the champions, he thinks and he he that's his his mindset is okay, I'm going to go out and and intimidate because I've got a physical advantage on their greatest champion. So when we kill them, then we're going to be good. And that was the the intimidation tactic here. And the Israelites suited up for armor standing on the inside. And I wonder how many of us feel the same way where we are in the promised land. Holy Ghost fil believers walking in the light of our day. We are in we we are in the word. We have been in the word. And yet you feel, and if you'll allow me just to say it in that way, you feel like you're standing on the ridge line looking down in the valley and you're thinking, "Well, here I am. I'm suited up. I'm ready for war. I'm not unwilling to fight, but that seems very insurmountable. I I I don't like, should I? Should I not? I don't know exactly where you should be." persevering, &gt;&gt; but halting slightly. &gt;&gt; And I'll be honest with you, I feel like that a lot. &gt;&gt; I can I've felt like that many times throughout my life as a Holy Ghost fil. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand something. You don't have to feel that way. You don't have to feel like you're just uh uh um someone who's just standing on the ridge line wondering what to do. You don't have to feel like that. Now, here's the interesting thing and I want you just to um just think with me here for a second now. when uh and I was I was looking and I was just studying through and trying to figure out um when brother Brandon would talk about perseverance, what was the what was the next thing? What what would he say? What would be the um you know the next part of that? And when he would say uh to be perseverant to um you know when I am perseverant then then what happens? What's the next step here? What do I do? Now look at this. He would say in uh uh uh uh in Perseverant 1963, he said, "Now John knew it. He wasn't afraid of failure. That was his charge and that was his commission. So he could be very perseverant." &gt;&gt; Knew his commission and so therefore he could be very perseverant. And you can be very perseverant when you have faith. &gt;&gt; When you have a revelation of who Christ has made you to be. &gt;&gt; Then you can be perseverant. &gt;&gt; But brother Ben Brandham takes it a step further and he says when John understood his his commission then he could be very perseverant. &gt;&gt; He could persevere within that commission. He would say uh a few paragraphs later, he said, "Now, no matter what what they say, why they'll throw you in jail. The ministerial association will kick you out. You'll have you won't have any fellowship. There's no cooperation." Didn't make any any didn't make John any difference. He was perseverant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a message and somebody must hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 1962 in the sermon perseverance, he says this, brother Benham, now talk about perseverance. Moses, he walked right up in the face of Pharaoh and said, "Let them go." Why? He talked face to face with God &gt;&gt; till he had his commission. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I think if minister brethren today would just not take it from an intellectual standpoint, &gt;&gt; but would find them a place on the back side of the desert on those sacred sands where Satan cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief and stay there until a message comes from God and positionally places you in the ministry. Then all the devils out of torment can't shake you from it. He takes perseverance and he brings it one step further into commission. Now if you look at where brother Benham talks about commission he says now first there is and this is in the sermon influence. He says first there comes a cleansing. Notice the following the cleansing was a commission. Oh my. Yes. First a confession then a cleansing and then a commission. Now, if we look at Revelations 10:7, that is not the end of the story. We focus a lot on Revelations 10:7 because it's what we believe &gt;&gt; in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; We believe that. There is no doubt. We believe that. We can have confidence in that. We've seen it. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be convinced of it. &gt;&gt; I see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if I um if we I and I I I think about this a lot, but I I always um and I think uh Brother Ron and I you were you were talking about um Believe the Sign the other day. And I I'll just be honest with you, Believe the Sign has never really affected me uh uh um in terms of uh uh uh what I believe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um because I look at their arguments. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think, is that literally the best you have? &gt;&gt; Have you read the Bible? &gt;&gt; Because there's no scriptural arguments there. &gt;&gt; It's well, it may not have been so many people on the bridge. They weren't there. &gt;&gt; They weren't there. &gt;&gt; They weren't there at the bridge. &gt;&gt; So, there's no scriptural argument &gt;&gt; to say that Revelations 10:7 hasn't happened. Come on. &gt;&gt; There's no life to back it up. There's nothing that they point you to. There's nothing greater that they have. They tear down. That's a scoffer's message. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, don't go to a scoffer for the truth. &gt;&gt; So, if you want the truth, don't go to someone who's just tearing something down because they have nothing to offer you. And when you seek that as a source of truth, you will wander. and you'll go to this to this to that and you'll never be settled because you listen to a scoffer for truth &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF SAID I AM THE WAY the truth and the life &gt;&gt; so if you want truth go to the word &gt;&gt; go to Christ himself &gt;&gt; so someone can't convince me out of the message of the hour because I met the person of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; you can't convince me out of a PERSON &gt;&gt; HE IS in me and I am in him. &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You won't you won't convince me out of that. I'm standing firm on that revelation and WITHIN THAT I WILL PERSEVERE. &gt;&gt; I will stand strong by his strength, not my own. &gt;&gt; I have confidence in him, not my brain. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have confidence in him, NOT MY ABILITY TO understand and discern. &gt;&gt; He is my source of strength. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. &gt;&gt; So, if that's the best argument that you have. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying that arrogantly or flippantly. I mean it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You open up your Bible and let's talk about the message of the hour. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; I have no time for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when I I come to someone who is struggling, &gt;&gt; questions are okay. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that questions and having questions that's okay? Yeah. &gt;&gt; If someone is sitting across from me and they have they have a purpose to undermine my my belief or to witness to me to something else &gt;&gt; or to witness to me that what I believe isn't true. Which doesn't make sense, but I've encountered that a lot. I I I'll stop them and I'll say, "Now hang on. What are you witnessing to me?" &gt;&gt; Because you're trying to convince me out of the message of the hour. That's what you're doing. What are you witnessing to me? What have you got? &gt;&gt; Show me what you got next. I'll listen to your arguments, but show me where you're going to bring me next. And they have nothing. They have nothing. So, I'm not going to argue like that. But if someone, and I've I've dealt with this in my church for so for so long, uh it feels like if someone has a question and say, "Well, what about this?" Or, "What about this?" I am I am right there. Let's talk about it. Let's crack open our Bibles and let's talk about it &gt;&gt; because it's okay to have questions. I want to know what I believe. I have so many questions. &gt;&gt; I have so many questions. And I ask and I search I search the scriptures to see whether those things be true. &gt;&gt; I want to walk in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to know what I believe and be able to stand firm in it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be wavering or double-minded. I want to walk true, walk strong, walk. &gt;&gt; Walk circumspectly in the truth. &gt;&gt; And so I will search. I will seek. I will ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have I have no shame. I have no shame to ask a question &gt;&gt; as if we as if we know everything in this room. &gt;&gt; You should never be afraid to ask a question &gt;&gt; and and say, "You know what? I've never really understood this. &gt;&gt; Can you explain it to me?" &gt;&gt; I'm amazed at the amount of people who sit in a message church for 30 years &gt;&gt; and can't explain a simple doctrine to you. Brother, &gt;&gt; I don't mean to put you down. If that's where you are, because you have an opportunity to search &gt;&gt; and to grow and to learn. &gt;&gt; So, if that is you, then I encourage you, seek out the truth &gt;&gt; because you will find it. &gt;&gt; But don't go to a scoffer. &gt;&gt; Go to the truth. &gt;&gt; Now, Revelations 10:7, understanding that that is the truth and that has happened. That's only the beginning &gt;&gt; because the reality for us is Revelations 10:8-11. &gt;&gt; That's what you and I fulfill. That's where we are right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We fulfill Revelations 108 through 111. &gt;&gt; You take the book. &gt;&gt; A voice out of heaven says, "Come and take the book." You take it. You eat it. It becomes a part of you. &gt;&gt; You are changed by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You become what you eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you look at at that, you eat the book, it's the inward, and then you prophesy again. That's the outward. In other words, the faith that that is established by the the revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you. &gt;&gt; Is then able to be persevered in. You are able to persevere within that revelation. You are able. It's it's a brother Benham refers to it as a keeping power. There is a keeping power there. It is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the Holy Spirit that leads you and guides you into all truth. &gt;&gt; How to be a good husband. How to be a good wife. What what it what that actually means, not a misrepresentation of it. &gt;&gt; How to be a good father. &gt;&gt; How to be a good mother. &gt;&gt; How to be a good grandparent. All of those things are there for you. &gt;&gt; We have the the full message of the hour and the the the entire word of God. The scripture is never irrelevant to the situation that you are in. &gt;&gt; He is a present help in the time of trouble. So he will have an answer for you. whatever you face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever difficulty, situation, trial, whatever the complexity may be, and I'll be honest with you, family and and work and society and and the economy, it is complex. &gt;&gt; Family situations are complex. &gt;&gt; It's not cutting I don't know if uh maybe that's just me, but it's not cut and dry anymore. &gt;&gt; We got to worry about this and that and this and this factor and that person and this and that and this. It's very complex. Maybe it's always been that way since there have been families since the dawn of time. So maybe it's always been that way. Maybe we're more aware of it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in that complexity, the Lord will meet you &gt;&gt; as you persevere upon the revelation that he's established in you. And within that revelation, it is unfolding. You are growing. Grow in grace and in knowledge. And as you acquire the knowledge of the truth, he applies it to the complexity that you are in. &gt;&gt; So if you're wondering, I've what do I do in this job situation. If you are the kind of person that um you need somebody else to tell you what to do and and seeking counsel is a godly thing. But if at the end of the day you're so unsure about your step that you have you have to uh you can't make a step in confidence or assurance then you can that you don't have to live like that. &gt;&gt; You can walk confidently and assuredly within the word. &gt;&gt; He is there for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, a pastor is there to shepherd you and to preach the word and to establish the truth in the church, &gt;&gt; but he can't hold your hand on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. You have to pack out the revelation that he has established in you, that the Lord has established in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And your pastor preaches the word and establishes that truth. You have to pack it out. And therefore that necessitates you seeking the word in a way that you can apply it to the complexity that you find yourself in &gt;&gt; so that you aren't actually just a person standing on the ridge line &gt;&gt; all suited up for armor and all ready to go &gt;&gt; but saying well where where's the champion &gt;&gt; maybe the pastor can fix this situation that I got &gt;&gt; maybe and and where you should be but unwilling to step into the fight And it's an amazing thing. &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to live as a a a believer of the message of the hour &gt;&gt; in in question all the time &gt;&gt; or in fear because we're not in bondage to fear anymore. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So being that you are in the land and you have possessed it and you are there, then walk circumspectly saying, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" Proverbs, I believe it's in Proverbs, it might be in Psalms, he says like a a horse with a bridal. If you pull it this way, I'll go this way. If you pull it this way, I'll go this way. And being able to have a fellowship and a relationship with the Lord where you can discern what is right and what is wrong. And when you need clarity, there is counsel there that God has placed around you to give it to you. But you need to be able to live the the message of the hour on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and not live in question and in fear and in in in just uh consumed by the complexity that is life nowadays. &gt;&gt; You can live strong. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can you can uh understand and discern that is the enemy &gt;&gt; and say, "Get thee behind me, Satan. You shall not prevail." And you can move forward. Now, if you go back with me here to 1st Samuel chapter 17 and just to just to lay clarity to it, I believe that the commission in if if if we move from perseverance to commission, what I see as a consistent theme in the message of the hour, what brother Bham says is when he talks about commission, he doesn't just refer to um to a calling. He doesn't just refer to a a preacher getting a commission and then going and preaching. He doesn't just refer to it. But when he talks about perseverance and he talks about commission, he refers to the believer's godgiven obligation to act upon the revealed word of the hour. When he talks about commission, it is to obey the revealed word of the hour, to speak it, and to walk in it and to manifest it. &gt;&gt; Of what value is it to be able to see the truth and not to apply it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The message the the a believer is not called just to uh uh understand the message &gt;&gt; of the hour. We are called to walk it out. We are called to be the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; You are who he will rapture. &gt;&gt; Not someone a far off. He raptures us. &gt;&gt; We are that which is quickened. &gt;&gt; The commission is that you you walk in the revealed word of the hour. Understand it, but obey it and speak it and manifest it. &gt;&gt; That you walk it out. That's the commission. a believer walking in the midst of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We pack out the message of the hour. We walk it out. We live it. We press towards it. &gt;&gt; We don't just look at it. &gt;&gt; We don't just read it and say, "That's nice." And then set it aside. &gt;&gt; John consumed the book. &gt;&gt; And when he did, it caused an action. &gt;&gt; He prophesied. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the message of the hour should do &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; Now in 1st Samuel chapter 17, you see all the way through verses 1 uh through 11. And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid. All suited up. They were all in the armor. They all had the They were all there. And then this happens. Now, you can imagine you're standing there and you're thinking, now this is the story we know very well. But again, you are an Israelite on the ridge line. You're very familiar with David and Goliath. But this is you looking down and you're thinking, "What on earth? What is happening here?" Because you're thinking, "Okay, where's the champion? Let's send out the champion. Let's send out the best ministers that we have because they're the most spiritual among us. So, they'll be able to do all the things. And we we're just but humble sheep. And we will sit around and we'll be entertained for an hour at service and then go home and live confused &gt;&gt; like we have nothing to live a powerful life with, &gt;&gt; like we have no weapon or tool to defeat the enemy. That does easily beset us. And David waltses down into the field and we know precisely what happens. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what I want you to understand. In verse 51, uh David um uh verse uh let's start in verse 49 47. Let's start in verse 47. And of of 17. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with the sword and the spear, for the battle is the Lord's. This is David. &gt;&gt; And he will give you into your into our hands. Now, keep in mind that all the Israelites had a promise that it was their land. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, the Philistines had no place being where they were. &gt;&gt; But the Israelites were not moving. They were not acting. &gt;&gt; They were persevering because they showed up to the battle. And David says, "The Lord, he will give you into our hands." And it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David. And David hastened and ran towards the enemy or toward the army to meet the Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag and took then a stone and slang it and smokeote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead. And he fell upon his faith face upon the earth. And David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smokeote the Philistine and slew him. But there was no sword in the hand of David. Therefore David ran and he stood upon the Philistine and he took his sword and drew it out and he slew him and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw this, their champion was dead. They fled. &gt;&gt; I love it. He We're Israelites on the ridge line looking down and we're thinking, what is happening here? because that little boy could not have done what he just did. &gt;&gt; But yet this has just happened. And now uh Goliath and uh sorry for the gruesome image. Uh I guess I should have I guess I should have monitored that. Um sorry children, but it happened. Uh and and so the Israelites are looking there and David ran &gt;&gt; and this is how it lay. &gt;&gt; And all that was so fearful and all that was so um big &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; lay dead on the battlefield. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what brother Brandham said about this &gt;&gt; here in Why Little Bethlehem 1963. Here, Christ is represented in this both king and warrior &gt;&gt; because he cut his way through. He broke the enemy's lines of death. He broke the enemy's lines so that we might have eternal life. the waters of eternal life. He came through even to death and took death upon himself and died. The warrior, we didn't conquer. It's already conquered. &gt;&gt; We never conquered death. &gt;&gt; He conquered death for us. &gt;&gt; He's our David of this day. &gt;&gt; He conquered death. &gt;&gt; Bethlehem's bread and water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, type David to Christ. &gt;&gt; In this scenario, Brother Brandham, type David to Christ, not to you, &gt;&gt; but to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We think, boy, if I could just be a David and get out there on the field. That's a good thing to desire. But do you understand that the Lord Jesus Christ has made a way &gt;&gt; for the enemy to be defeated? Now, keep in mind that what happened is when David ran, he he slung the the uh he slang the sling and the the he was dead and then he cut off the head and Goliath is lying there. The scripture is very clear that the enemy fled. It is then true if we bring it into today's context that the enemy knows it is defeated. &gt;&gt; THAT THE ENEMY IS TRULY then a bluff. &gt;&gt; Albeit he is very smart. The enemy is very smart. He is very shrewd. He does indeed walk about as a roaring lion. He does attack you sometimes. Vast majority of what we deal with is by our own doing. &gt;&gt; But the enemy does wage war and he is after you. And he does mess with you. &gt;&gt; He entangles himself in the COMPLEXITY THAT IS YOU. &gt;&gt; And he messes around. And scripturally we should know that he has no place &gt;&gt; in our midst. &gt;&gt; The enemy has no strongholdise. &gt;&gt; The enemy is defeated. &gt;&gt; And in this scenario, David typed Christ. &gt;&gt; He has gone before you. He has defeated death. &gt;&gt; He is your conqueror. You don't have to feel like, boy, I'm never going to be able to be that spiritual titan that I want to be. HE IS YOUR spiritual titan. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS CHRIST IN YOU, THE hope of glory. &gt;&gt; It is not your strength. &gt;&gt; It is by his spirit, saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the enemy, as a result, has has flew. &gt;&gt; It is gone. &gt;&gt; They don't have a stronghold anymore. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the amazing thing. Because remember, you're a person on the ridge line &gt;&gt; and you were looking down at this whole thing. But if you look at verse 52, and the men of Israel of Judah arose &gt;&gt; and shouted &gt;&gt; and pursued the Philistines until thou come they until thou came to the valley and to the gates of Echron. Do you understand that? that was actually beyond where most of the soldiers of Felistia had come from. So what had happened is that the enemy now the Israelites they saw Goliath is dead and as a result of that we are in the promised land. &gt;&gt; We do have possession of the land. I just happen to be suited up with armor. &gt;&gt; I just happen to be standing here on this ridge line with an enemy that is fleeing before my face. And what it did is it built up immediately confidence. &gt;&gt; They were persevering. But what it did is it emboldened their commission. &gt;&gt; It enabled them to realize so quickly, &gt;&gt; I am a a child of God. I'm an Israelite. I'm suited up. I've got the armor on. The the conqueror has has defeated the enemy. The enemy is fleeing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I will get down off of this ridge AND I WILL PURSUE my enemy. &gt;&gt; And that's precisely what happened. &gt;&gt; Watching their conqueror defeat the enemy emboldened their commission. And it went from just persevering, from just being willing to show up and being willing to suit your armor uh uh uh s sew it up and to and to sharpen your sword and to stand there into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of what value is the message of the hour if we don't live it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we don't walk with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Of what value is it just to look at it on a shelf? if it isn't in you and it isn't in me because the message of the hour is Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; It is a voice out of heaven calling to you in this day and it has given you a commission that greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world. And the same spirit that is in you will quicken your mortal body that was in Christ that quickened his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as A RESULT OF THAT LIFE that is now on the inside of you which makes you a message believer. It's the life of God. &gt;&gt; It's not a a convincing into a set of doctrine. &gt;&gt; But when we are in it and we do have a revelation, doctrine becomes clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or at least it should. &gt;&gt; And when you are there, the commission becomes clear that I can I can rise up. I can I can live out my God-given obligation to act upon the revealed word of the hour. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, young people and old. This is irrespective of age because there was a lot of different age groups in that in that uh army right there. There's a lot of different people. And you old who are here, you might say, "Well, I've done I've fought too many battles and things like that." You need to be emboldened like Caleb to pick up a stone and start sharpening your sword and say, "I'm not done yet. I'm going to persevere because I've got a commission. And there was a generation coming up behind me and I will persevere. The enemy will not hold me. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed at the amount of um uh uh in the older generation who allow themselves to be crippled by fear. Knowing full well what it is, that it is a valless element. It has no substance to it. &gt;&gt; There is no fruit to fear. &gt;&gt; It is valless. There's nothing to it. It may or may not happen. There is value to faith. It is substance. It is the evidence. &gt;&gt; And when you, regardless of your age, stand on faith, the revelation of the revealed word of the hour, AND THEN PERSEVERE WITHIN YOUR COMMISSION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Then God can do mighty things in our midst. &gt;&gt; To you young people, it's the exact same thing. When you meet the Lord Jesus Christ in a new birth and a when you meet him and and however the Lord does that in your life, whatever your story looks like, but one thing was always certain in the book of Acts, he came to you. Brother Bannon was very clear. You don't get the Holy Ghost, he gets you. And when you have that revelation of who he is to you, then now you can begin to persevere. You place your faith on the word of God and you begin to walk forward in your commission to obey it, to speak the revealed word of the hour, to walk in it. I believe with all my heart the message of the hour did not come to decorate us like the Catholic Church and robes and &gt;&gt; pretty buildings and &gt;&gt; all of those things. The message of the hour is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in you &gt;&gt; that one day will quicken your mortal body from this life to the next. He will change you in the moment of a twinkling of an eye. But until then, &gt;&gt; I will live assuredly. &gt;&gt; I will live in the strength of who he is in me. &gt;&gt; In his strength, &gt;&gt; I will handle whatever situation comes my way as effectively as I can. I will be the best uh husband, wife, father, mother, grandparent &gt;&gt; that I can possibly be. I will live intentionally. understanding that the enemy is fleeing before me. &gt;&gt; So I will not live as a soldier on the ridge line suited up. &gt;&gt; I will step down into the valley. &gt;&gt; Understanding that Christ has already made a way for you to live victoriously. &gt;&gt; So what have we to fear? &gt;&gt; What have we to dread? &gt;&gt; We are really leaning on the everlasting arms of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So I challenge you and I ask you, are you a soldier that's just standing on the ridge line in the promised land, having possessed the land, suited up, but you're not willing to go out and say, "You know what? I can be a better father." &gt;&gt; I can I can be I can be a better mother. I I I want to know what that even looks like. &gt;&gt; Because from my life, I don't know what that looks like. &gt;&gt; I'm all messed up. And so by the by the power of the resurrection &gt;&gt; and in my land, the enemy will not wreak havoc in my family. &gt;&gt; And if when the enemy does come and difficulties and failures happen, &gt;&gt; I will get back up &gt;&gt; and I will continue to pursue the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because failure is not final. &gt;&gt; We fight the battles. We fight the the difficulties. We go through them. We've already won the war. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I I look at I look at this and I look at what the Apostle Paul was telling this group of not rebellious people but weary people. And I don't know where you are today. I don't know if you uh maybe maybe you do have doubts about the message. I don't know. Maybe you are weary in in just the continuence, the perseverance. And Paul says to you, "Cast not away therefore your confidence." &gt;&gt; We are not that draw back under predition. &gt;&gt; That's the enemy's lie. &gt;&gt; But for us to be able to genuinely say, &gt;&gt; "Satan, get thee behind me. I am I am of them that believe &gt;&gt; to the saving of the soul &gt;&gt; and I am getting off this ridge line of inactivity and I am going to go down and I am going to carry out the message of the hour in my life. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to live as effectively as I can enjoy the process that the Lord brings me through and I'm going to go live like a a person that Christ has changed and passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to claim my mountain. I'm going to claim my victory that you've already made possible. &gt;&gt; Would you bow your heads with me? I want to stop right there as the musicians come. And just in the stillness of his presence and in in just the quiet place that you are, I I want you and I want to I want to pray with you that just wherever you you may be in your life, a person standing on the ridge line. Maybe you've been there for many, many years. Um, maybe you're a young person and you feel like you're there right now. The Lord has already made a way for us to endure, for us to steadfastly persevere. He has already enabled us to have patience. And it is it is for us to rise up as the me as the bride of Jesus Christ and to live out the commission to walk it out to stand in our God-given obligation to act upon the revealed word of the hour. not to sherk back from it, not to sit and say, "Well, maybe that's not true or maybe this is not true." Seek out the answer, find the answer, and stand there in that revelation that God will give you. SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND. &gt;&gt; It is not a hope. So, it is a promise of the Lord Jesus Christ. So, if you are there, seek because you will find. &gt;&gt; It may not come like you want it. It may not be the answer that you expect. very rarely is it is but that it is he will give it to you. &gt;&gt; And when you have that, you can persevere in that. If you know where you are today, you say, "I know that I'm a son and daughter of God. I've gone through I've got a really scratched up shield and a dented sword, but I stand firm in that in that revelation that he gave me. And as a result, I will persevere and I will walk out my commission. I will step down off of this ridge line and I will continue running after that enemy that is fleeing before my face. The enemy has no hold on you. He does not have to have a hold on you. Come boldly before the throne of grace. allow him to work in the very deep places and say, "Lord, I don't want to be a ridge line believer. I want to get down off of this ridge line. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I raise my hand. I want that. I want to recognize my conqueror has done the deed. Goliath is defeated &gt;&gt; and me standing on that ridge line looking down. May you embolden my commission. May I not weary in this perseverance. May I have confidence, Lord. May my confidence not be shaken. May my confidence not be uh um cast away. But Lord, may you strengthen me. I pray that for everyone in this room. &gt;&gt; I pray that Lord that you would bless them every heart that you would embolden them Lord in where they stand. Oh Lord, I pray that you would just move among our hearts this morning. May we stand strong. May we stand firm. I love what brother Brandham said. down with Satan and his gloom and up with the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ. May that be our prayer this morning. May that be our heart's cry. Away with Satan and his gloom &gt;&gt; and UP WITH FAITH in the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for giving us the message of the hour. We thank you for giving us the truth, &gt;&gt; for being here in our midst, &gt;&gt; for revealing yourself to us. &gt;&gt; May we stand strong. May we stand firm. Oh, how we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray for each one. May you bless each heart. Your name do we pray. Amen. Let's stand and let's sing a song. The splend of the king. Oh, clothe mesty. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it together now. &gt;&gt; All the earth rejoice. And all the earth dreams. Oh, he wraps himself. Oh, darkness tri and trembles every treble his voice is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; How great, how great is our God. Sing this. He says, "Oh, when time is in his hands, the beginning, the end, the end. God, we all are one. Oh, father, spirit, son. the way might is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. How great how great is our God. Oh, when you see he said through an open book in Thank you, Lord.

How great is our God. Sing how great how great is our God. Amen. Praise the Lord. I wonder if we could sing that song. You were singing it uh before. And uh I just love it so much. And if you want, it's rising up. And if you want prayer, I'll be happy to pray with you. But I just I just feel like singing this song &gt;&gt; because I look at that and I I I don't feel woe is me. I look at that story and I place myself in the Israelites seat and the enemy running and me running after them and I think &gt;&gt; I'm excited. &gt;&gt; I'm excited to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; I have problems, too. &gt;&gt; I'll deal with them. &gt;&gt; I'll handle my problems, but I'm excited to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; I'll face my inequalities. I'll face what I am doing wrong. I'll own up to it. I'll live with accountability in the principles of the scripture. &gt;&gt; I'll be the best husband I can be and really try to understand what that means. I'll try to be the best pastor I can be. But I'm excited to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song. Rulers of across the land. See God's mighty hand. Oh my go. Rising up the message. Rising up. Rising up. Rising up the New Testament church. Rising up. Holy Ghost fell. Wonders were on by Apostle J. Spirits were cast out. They sing and shout by God's holy angel church. Rising up. Rising up. Rising up. is all miracles are done. I have some good news bringing you in right now. Rising up for the New Testament church rising up. Rising up. Rising up. There's a New Testament church rising up. Hallelujah. Just go ahead and keep playing it because I believe God is doing things here. I believe he's speaking to hearts and he spoke to you this morning. You've been on a ridge line too long. You've been looking at the complexities of your life or your career or your job or whatever the complexity of this Goliath that has stood up. Understand here were the armies ready for battle. Brother Brennham said God didn't call you to a picnic. He's called you to a battle. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he's given you the armor. He's given you the weaponry to enter into the battle. So we don't stand there and we just observe because there will be Goliaths that come in your life. There will be obstacles that will impede your going forward which will hinder you from TAKING WHAT IS YOURS. And tonight you've or this morning you have very very clearly seen that you've got to quit observing. &gt;&gt; I've been on a ridge line of this message &gt;&gt; and of the word OF GOD IN MY LIFE and I YEAH I'M CALLED TO A BATTLE BUT HOW DO I GET INTO IT? will understand your captain has gone before you. &gt;&gt; He said, "Greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world." He just didn't say, "Okay, boys, go get them." &gt;&gt; Your captain said, "Come on, follow me, boys." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT REAL FAITH does gets off the ridge line &gt;&gt; and gets into action. And I think there's some of you that have you've been playing around. &gt;&gt; You've let whatever hindrance it is that stands before you and you've halted in your experience. I believe that this sermon has stirred hearts. I know it stirred me. So if it's stirred you, &gt;&gt; I want you to say, "I will get off of this ridge line. &gt;&gt; Get away from the complexities that have hindered me, and I will now enter into the valley of the battle. And though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE HEAD RISES, the body rises with it. That's why when David cut the head off, Goliath will never rise again. &gt;&gt; That's why, my God. When you go into battle and you cut that head off, it'll never rise again. &gt;&gt; There's only one that's going to rise. That's the resurrection. That's he who's got it. He says, "Though I was dead, I'm alive forever more. &gt;&gt; And I am the resurrection and I am the life and I will give you the victory." So, I think it's time. And I I tell you what, I just think there should be more people coming here right now saying, "You know what? I want to I want to come. I I want to show myself. I want to get off the red ridge line. I I want to come. I I just want to show I'm part of those that I want to get into this battle. &gt;&gt; As I look out across the land, &gt;&gt; Is anyone else &gt;&gt; you'd like to say? I'm going to get off that ridge line. Come on now. New Testament church rising. I'm rising up. Rising up the New Testament church. Rising up. James, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Come on up here. We want to pray for these people. Holy angels. I know. I know. I know. I know. Hallelujah. Mirales are done. The good news bring you in the last days. The spirit will be well renewed. I love my Psalms 34. This poor man cried. This poor man cried this morning. You got a need, come forward. I saw the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from everything. That's what he does on our radian. They'll never be ashamed. this for this morning. Thank you, Lord. You save me from save me from my enem. what we heard today.

Yes. into action, into your promises, &gt;&gt; in your heart. How I long to be second by the spir of your &gt;&gt; My heart has found &gt;&gt; My heart has found me Hope I hope I hope you can trust in this morning. Here in your presence for me with Jesus only.

And I will bless the Lord forever. Cuz you can trust him. I will trust him at all times. He has and he will do and he has delivered me. It's what we heard this morning. The truth, the gospel. We have Oh, set my feet upon the rock and I will not be moved. I say of the Lord, you are my shield, my strength, my for my sh my dress. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. That's what you are to us today. and hold in heaven you and there's none I desire beside you. truly not like you, Lord. And you have made me glad. And I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield, my strength, my for my sh my presence in time of You are my strength, my strength, my worship. My sh my very present, &gt;&gt; my very present helping touch. Sing that last line one more time. My very present help. &gt;&gt; My present help. &gt;&gt; You are. You are this morning. Come Jesus. Come today. Come Jesus. Come. Let's sing that this morning. You got a need, he's here to answer your need this morning. Sometimes I fall. Oh my Jesus. Let today be. Oh, sometimes I feel that I'm glory. &gt;&gt; This is what he preached this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come Jesus. You've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and write every wrong. We need you right now. Oh, come and turn this around. Oh, now I go. This world is in Jesus. Come Jesus. Second verse. There'll be no more be. Holy Jesus comes and today is who he comes for. He'll come for the we and the strongest and all. Do you believe the power of his name? &gt;&gt; Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come. We've been waiting so long for the day you'll return to heal every heart. Oh, we need you right now. is around world is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Wonderful. And I just feel a strange moving of the Holy Spirit right now. I'd like you to just keep your heads bowed for just a moment. You know, I don't do this often, but when the opportunity comes, I want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit. And it wasn't necessary for you to come down here to actually be prayed for, but it is necessary for you to get off the ridge line &gt;&gt; and get into the battle. &gt;&gt; It's not that you need us to pray for you to even walk down here, but it does take a willing heart. And if this message stirred your heart &gt;&gt; to want to be better, &gt;&gt; would you raise your hand? Say, "Thank you." And right now at the altar of my heart, &gt;&gt; that's what I want. I just want to be better. &gt;&gt; I want to fight a good fight. &gt;&gt; I don't want Loudiusa to overcome me, but I want to overcome Laudi. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And right now I'm responding to this. I'm responding and I'm saying I realize I can't do it. It's not my by my power, by my might, but it's by your spirit, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, Father God, you see every hand, both of my hands are raised up. Because Father, I realize that in this age of complexities and all the diversities and whatever Goliath and whatever stands in the valley that impedes your progress to take that land that belongs to you, it's your inheritance. I pray that you will rise up right now and say, "I claim this inheritance. It is mine. It is my rightful position as a believer and I want to claim every promise unto me. I will not pass it off to someone else. The promise only came to Mary to quicken her when she said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." So we say those words, be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Quicken the life of Christ in every believer. &gt;&gt; Yes indeed. &gt;&gt; It's not rules, regulations. It is not standards. It is not commandments. It is a relationship between you and God. strengthen therefore that relationship, Lord, as we pour our hearts out before you. I thank you. Thank you for brother Steve, Lord, for putting this on his heart, Father, to take a simple thought but very profound. How that they were there, they were persevering, they were looking what's going to happen. I pray that each one of us will not be one of those that just stand and watches but now gets into the battle and is ready to go after because our Christ has already entered and defeated our enemy. Therefore, we have a right to possess every gate to claim every promise. &gt;&gt; We ask these things for your glory &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I know when God moves and I know he moves in very special ways. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I love I love as a minister, as an elder within the message, see a young man standing there with confidence. &gt;&gt; Speaking truth &gt;&gt; and confidence breeds confidence. Faith breeds faith. &gt;&gt; And add unto your faith virtue, and to your virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge temperance. God is building you to be a powerhouse for the living God. &gt;&gt; And he's doing it. It is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; It is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is believe. &gt;&gt; That's what believers do. &gt;&gt; Is they believe. Brother Brandham given a commission go into the whole world preach the gospel. I'm going to give you two signs as Moses given two signs. And I want you to heal the sick and do the discernment. But that's only the attraction. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be a voice behind the sign. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you'll get the people to believe, &gt;&gt; has he gotten you to believe? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm not that great warrior. I'm not that great." Hey, the greatness is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David told Goliath, "You come to me with spear and shield. You're a man of war war, but I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord God of Israel, I come. That's where how and that's how you should quit looking at you. Well, I I'm not strong enough. Of course, you're not. You can't do it. &gt;&gt; And when you finally accept the fact it's not me, it's him. &gt;&gt; Then let him &gt;&gt; take control. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, what a lovely, lovely, lovely service. Amen. And if you've never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, why don't you do it now? &gt;&gt; If you are afraid of failure, you'll never get out of the boat. I tell you all you have to do. He says, "Come unto me all ye that are weary and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy &gt;&gt; and my burden is light. &gt;&gt; Seek and ye shall find. Ask and it shall be given. Knock &gt;&gt; and the door shall be open." That's all you got to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. We're going to just sing this song. We're going to be dismissed. And Amen. All you have to do is just say yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Quit saying no. No, I can't. No. No. No. No. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is say yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Activate the promises by saying yes. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes to your will, Lord. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; If you mean it, put your hand up. You lead me. &gt;&gt; I will go. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; One more time as a commitment. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll say yes, Lord. Lord, I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; And to your will, Lord, I'll say yes. Where you lead me, where you lead me, I will go. When I say yes, Lord, I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; Right before you leave, if you have to go, you can go. I'd like to sing. You're worthy of it all. The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords is worthy. You're worthy of it all. You got to go. You can go this morning. Oh, from you are holy and to you are holy. You deserve the glory. You're worthy this morning. You're worthy of it all. All that's within you says you are worthy. You're worthy of it all. Amen. For from you are all things and to you are all things you deserve your glory. &gt;&gt; All the saints and the angels and all the saints and angels they will bow before your throne. And all the elers cast their crowns before the lamb of God. And sing you're worthy of it all. Lord, we say you're worthy. &gt;&gt; You're worthy of it all.
