written but Lord reading between the lines father the application and the moving of the spirit in the sanctuary Lord in humility Lord father God as we're looking away unto you ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you tonight uh let's take our Bibles in the book of 2 King chapter 2 verse 11-4 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked and that behold there appeared a chariot of Fire and horse of fire and departed them from uh departed them both Ascender and Elijah went up by a worldwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him and he saw him no more and took hold of his whole own of his own clothes and rent him into two pieces he took up also his man the manle of Elijah that fell upon him from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the water the waters they departed hither and thither and Elisha went over may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated may God uh once again bless you tonight uh it's uh a privilege to be in the house of the Lord thank you brother Ron for the confidence and also the church for making it to the service tonight uh we are still uh carrying on with uh seeing Jesus and his program uh want to take uh tonight's service as a elas ministry as a Crossing Point uh between uh the first part of uh covering communism in the land also uh under jer's Ministry and to get into elas because we understand uh that God's program is still the same in all shape and forms and we take it from many uh types and shadows uh when uh tonight's service preparation I had to finish up uh it was a little bit different I said I'm not used to this type of him moving over me so you can tell I'm a little nervous uh it's the first time I don't know if uh that's his way of giving me my birthday or something we'll uh we'll see how how things will go by his grace because we are understand that uh many uh times when we dealing with the word is not human ways of doing things but at times we also get used to the way he moves and uh you become acquainted you know that hey when he's moving from the right it's because he wants to do this but then when he start moving a little bit different coming a little bit in the center he said well I need to find a scripture for it but by his grace uh we're looking forward uh to what he has for us uh also want to take the opportunity to thank all of you uh for everything that you have been for me all the invitations and uh uh the trust and uh respect and uh everything that you do in the background unheard and unseen from the church may God reach bless you uh because are some of the areas that you invited me I said well I'm quite a a young man I don't think I deserve this but you've done that inviting me over may God richly bless you uh all the feedbacks and everything that uh you um the way you're receiving the word and at times like you know you get off the pull pit you think that hey I should have said this and but by his grace he comes all over you and you know you start ministering to me too I believe we'll just uh keeping moving forward with the language the way he wants it to come forward by his grace uh tonight we'll be speaking about Elisha and I'll be also uh speaking a little bit about myself by his grace because I've Been Told told that uh I'm a little bit of a Myster man to to to uh to many you know I I just have uh this background of uh when I'm on the pulpit it's not it's not about me you know but then you understand that uh cultures are different you know cultures are different and uh sometimes uh you just used to eat chickens with bones and then you go somewhere else they tell you remove the bones you know so put a little bit of a smile and uh speak to the people relax and all that so you know we take that into consideration uh so it also like you know felt that it just happened that you know it is my birthday and uh to also give the church a little bit of uh background of who I am because because I don't usually do it when I'm behind the pulpit and also that he also comes along with uh elious Ministry just as the crossing point between um communism and uh everything that goes forward uh by God's grace uh will'll uh try to unveil as much as possible because I wanted to have a little bit of a longer Ser service but he said like no no go this way so if I just take 20 minutes you understand understand so by his grace but if I go longer you also understand let's just keep balance you know uh in the book of uh Elisha uh we see that Elisha represents the bride in this uh last hour that as we've been covering upon uh communism we see that uh the word uh hide these things in Simplicity the prophet says in question and answer sir uh he says uh you know he said like you know to prove my point I'll show you that you know this communism uh he's a spirit and he's something that is among people of all backgrounds I never had never seen that quote or I probably have listened to the tape but never uh pay attention to that quote uh he showing how communism came into the land uh and other scriptures that are found today you say like you know communism is a spirit and when it's a spirit you know you can just take a hold of one uh part of the land or one person and tie that hand to them you know but by his grace uh he was uh we've been able to see that communism as he comes along he came into the land with a false hope telling people hey you'll become this just like in the garden of Eden showing them that a you will uh stand uh you will become like God you'll be just like you know the way God is but they didn't know that what they were already that's what God had made them to be but nevertheless uh God in his Mercy under Elijah's Ministry he brought uh Elisha uh he gave him the vision about the work ahead when he had for all the Jezebel religion he brought him under in the cave and he gave him and said hey you're going to anoint Elisha je and the other one in your stad because you're going to leave the Earth upon the time that he came at the time of a planting of new seed he found Elisha in a certain place and Elisha found himself that he was under this man's ministry as the bride is under Elisha's Ministry in these last days Elisha thought it was good for him to offer sacrifices in order for him to go and separate himself from his parent and follow Elisha Elijah um we see that under every man that ever came to God the first starting point is the blood without shedding of the blood there's no remission of sin all of us when we came to the message that's our first step we come by listening to the word and we are convinced and then we are concerned to come and be baptized and to surrender under the Lord Jesus Christ when we come under such great privilege uh we find that there's now a whole journey ahead and as Elisha was walking along brother bam says in the message Elijah and Elisha he said uh I can see Elisha watching him every move he made that's the only way he was ever going to get the blessing that uh the blessing he is when he washed him because along the way all of us as we are walking and we are um Believers uh especially in this last hour that uh We've come up to the understanding and the knowledge that hey Bam have made so many mistakes and all these things but then I want to draw the church attentions that Elisha has a Ministry the same way that Elijah had a Ministry but then Elisha's Ministry could not be enacted until Elisha was of the Earth but then prior for uh Elisha's Ministry to be enacted it had to be under Elisha's Ministry and the prophet says that you know this is the guy who was going out to sit under his ministry and watch him in everything that he did and the Elisha's blessing was tied to Elijah's Ministry and everything that Elijah was going to Elisha was going to do to do that's what Elisha was going to do and many times so you finding a message that the prophet calls Elisha Elijah and Elijah Elisha because many time this that's where the whole separation between the two seeds comes into play because the two spirits in the framework of the church it's either it's going to repeat the same thing or it's only going to be a whole another thing not something of 99% of the truth but the entire truth but then many times that we find ourselves that we become so knowable one would say to me well you know I've listened to the message have worked so many years in the message have uh devoted my life in the message but I came to find out that the TR the message is not the truth well if the message is not the truth that means that Elijah is not the it does not have the truth that means that every single person before him does not have the truth because Elijah preached like Paul and Paul preached like uh Moses and Moses preached like Adam so that means like you know all that pedigree all of them those people are wrong that means that you know whoever came into the Garden of Eden was also wrong that means all of us here we are also under false truth understanding that our blessings is tied to a certain linage we are not just birth out of out of out of the ordinary or out of uh by chance that say like you know I'll go by myself and find the truth you can't find the truth by yourself because the Pharisees and Sadducees came in front of the truth looked at the truth and they called it Bible and this last hour it is the same way that Elisha is tied and connected with Elijah and he said that you know everything that we are to do the way to dress the way to talk the way to conduct our family has to come through Elijah and if Elijah has not preached the entire truth then he is the most deceitful person that we have known in this last hour one would say like you know but we don't have such a scripture in the message regarding this regarding uh long skirt or cutting your hair in a man whole another yes that's the reason why you have to sit under Elijah's Ministry before you enact your own Ministry because that's why brother bam saying that before you go into your ministry meaning on the pulpit get married or whatsoever you need to go and find yourself have that back uh back of the desert experience so Elijah also started following Elijah along along the way we see that even myself uh being born just like you know all most of most of us young people born in the message grew up in the message it came a time where my parents you know they will take us to church just like anybody else take us to church and said you know after service what did the pastor preach oh okay this becomes an issue now you come back home you have to have your notes written down so that you can just ify your presence in the church and as we we going ahead then the teenagers ages start kicking in then you start having now double you become double-minded why do do the parents call me to go to church and why do the pastor preach this way and why all these things and along the along the life Journey we came to the point was like well I believe the parents are just ftic ICS because that's all I knew because you used to it they play the TS at home you go to church and that's the environment you know you never been to all other churches then I took the courage now to start listening to everybody else I'll go along the street and they will send me go get some bread around the corner at 7:00 a.m. and I'll show up at 12: 1:00 a.m. 1:00 p.m. why because I went to another church and I wanted to hear what do do they have before going to school I'll be stopping by somebody along the street will be preaching and I'll be like you know standing there I'll never forget one and this guy was uh in a typ of a meeting and he wanted to he was in sort of uh Discerning people's uh uh needs and things oh I see somebody going to the United States and all this and then all they said like what about me they speak to me too discern my life too how come you Discerning everybody else I come here every single all of your meetings and nothing is happening so is Elijah's Ministry at some point most of us grown young old we can find ourselves in the same situation we come to church for a certain purpose probably because my husband Tes me to church but we are not convinced about what we are doing yet the make make us wear long skirts and not cut our head just because maybe because I am Somebody's Daughter somebody's son and I don't want to chish my parents image in the church but nevertheless we having this outward appearance but we are not convinced yet about what is this message is all about we don't even understand what is the message to begin with and elishah sitting under Elijah's Ministry as the prophet say I can see Elisha watching him every move he made glory be to God that once upon a time down the road the parents saw it was neat for me to leave the city because the city was just too much I had the city on my shoulders and I had to be relocated to a different area glory be to God that under such a Ministry that I was exposed uh in those days the brother was gracious enough to open up to me and by his grace he found me one time uh in the church uh I never I'll never forget the book I was probably on the third row of the church was not a church uh a uh a service day I just sat in there and I went to his uh his table or office and I took the book and I one of the books and it was talking about drugs and how coffee is a drug and how tea is a drug I say oh oh so the only arresting people who are taking weeds what about those who are taking coffee they should also everybody should be arrested and as I was digging in the book he stepped up to me and he gave me leadership I started reading leadership started reading leadership and before I know it I was on the Altar and from that time to this day this has been my life Journey I never understood everything not everything was clear in my mind right but one thing was true to me was that hey this is it I do not understand everything then I started asking questions Pastor why this why do we we this then you turn up to be Martin you're going to finish the entire message with questions I said well probably like I said why but you supposed to be the pastor you supposed to have all the answers many times we look to the man of God in those manners too I have to call the pastor who's going to give me an answer on this I'll have to call this here just as elishah was doing he said I watched him every single move that Elijah did the also you said like you know tie this way Pence this way skirt this way every single move but it was not an experience he was following I was following but then until that point I wouldn't say that I had received the Holy Ghost but I knew that this is my life this is my journey right then I took the seven Church age book then I started digging I had a little bit of a background because I grew up in the message they speak about this they speak about that one time then I went to school my teacher would ask me said I was wearing the cloud on my on my shirt he said if they ask you this what is this what are you going to answer I had no answer why are you wearing skirt the way you wearing oh it's because our church does it why don't you have a girlfriend oh my father will will not allow that to happen why do you do what you do oh because uh everybody in our church does that but it's not a conviction yet it's not a revelation yet and such a person might also have a Ministry but does not even know what is this is all about Elisha was standing there looking at every single thing that Elijah was doing we look at our parents we look at our fathers our pastors and we know where to find the quotations because I knew if we we if we speak about woman here I know I have to go into the church order book I knew where all these things were but it was not a conviction yet as young people we face that challenge but it is also God's program for our lives because he has to take us from our Earthly journey into that Heavenly Journey but then before all all of us we are called regardless of our spiritual growth to be under a certain leadership to take us into the next stage amen and he said all the blessings he says keep your eyes on Christ don't look to how sick you are and what the doctor said look at what Christ said keep your eyes your eye right there believe what he said his words are true and as we are I was going through along this life journey I found myself that you know this is it I found what what my heart has been longing for because this is what I've been going to church but this is no more Church church for me this is no more just a place where I go I see other young people this is not a place where I come and say like you know I am in the message then experiences after experiences then I went back home and my parents couldn't understand what happened to me I said what happened like you know this guy has changed this guy doesn't go out anymore he stays there in his room all day and he's praying he's reading what has happened to him then the news went across because you know when you have a a a energetic son who turns very tame and all this everybody noes notices that what happened to him you know oh well well he went uh we sent him by this pastor and say and the parents started bringing the children and said well what do I have what do I have to give to them why are you bringing them to me why am I here what is happening to me yesterday nobody wanted to have the children around me but then all of a sudden but I couldn't understand what that happened in my life so is a son is born in the house so is some of us coming to the message the atmosphere that we sitting under is a drift liting us from our Earthly into the Heavenly but at times it doesn't just click to our eyes because it's not an intellectual thing because it's not about reading the message because it's not about knowing how many quotations it's not about giving the right answers to everything but then when there's an experience to somewhere then now something internally start happening that you can't explain with your mind just as I said that you know what I experience today is something different than all the previous years that I've had amen and under these constant anointing I find myself oh there are Jehovah Witnesses outside can you come and help us because the abundance of the from the abundance of the heart so the mouth speak but then I found myself speaking and giving all these detailed lectures if I say of the message in school and at home and in family and everything without even realizing that this was my Ministry this is what I was called under that's why each one of us especially young people or grown where whenever the Lord comes into our lives he wants us to have to enact to be un to have the understanding that our ministry is about to kick off right amen he called The Prophet The Prophet wouldn't listen he said I have called you and you wouldn't go where about you have you called me I have called you and you wouldn't go it wasn't for the prophet was just like you know I just want to be like the rest of the boys I just want to go and smoke and and have a girlfriend like everybody else but under that anointing it just couldn't help it until the Lord started pushing things around him for him to understand they hey I have called you for this purpose as of as as the human being I wanted to be a farmer I had all my life planned out I I'll be planting corn in the South selling it to the West taking the product I'll take from the north and bring it to the east I planned out my whole life then he said no that's not your life it took me and remove me all that production that I did from my first uh uh field I sent it away and I sold it and stuff and all the money was stolen why because I he had a work to do with me he has a work to do with every one of us it's only by his choice it's what he wants to do and that's what is going to happen regardless of how much we want to push our own agenda we just going to find out that even the prophet would say he say if I had known I would have not wasted my the first 20 years of my life I would have committed it to to serve him and until then when we find ourself in that spot then we look behind said why did I lose all my life all this time and I should have served him why by the time you we come to discover the purpose of Our Lives we zero in in that point our life is the best life ever job cannot replace it Church cannot replace it family cannot buy it to you nothing in this world will be able to give it to you if this doesn't make sense to us it's only until we get in that area then you find yourself like you know what have I been doing because Isaiah looked up to the king and said I want to be like the king I see the political figures in the land I want to be like them why how can I become like him but then until he started seeing the destruction and the fall of the king then the Lord lifted him up after being lifted up he had a six W he saw the the the angel the the angels with six wings coming under under such Ministry he found himself like you know hey I found the place what I've been looking for in all this time I was always aspiring to something great our sisters we aspire to something great oh I want to be like the Kardashians because at this stage of our journey that's what we see to be great I want to be like this other fellow it's because we look at them as being something great but then until now that Earthly Veil is torn before our face and we are lifted up in the heavenly then our eyes perception of life changes and the prophet says what is that it says um the absolute the woman's absolute was the prophet the prophet absolute was God and together with the word I am the resurrection and life I see the power of God the Creator can do all she rise up again the baby amen the woman and when the child when when Elisha when the brother when the sister when we come to that understanding into the Heavenly places it said like I have found the absolute amen because the absolute was not something so far away the absolute was just next to them and the absolute was the prophet and behind that Prophet was the word and allog together now he found the absolute he said I'll stick under this such Ministry yes but then when we come into that absolute we start finding errors then it's no more the absolute because regardless of how much the world can become smart and find all the issues in the message and left and right they will still end up with an absolute to some degree that's right it's either the mind is the absolute or the word is the absolute because leaning to our own understanding will give us the reasoning oh I don't believe that I think this is a mistake because our mind is our absolute yet the Bible tells us lean not to your own understanding and as long as we have our own understanding and we are unable to be such as babes that we learn and SE at his feet is pretty much much impossible for us to see the kingdom of God that's why he said that ye must be born again and the birth into the kingdom of God as Elijah was lifted up into the Heavenly it said like you know who is me I don't deserve this where should I be in this life Journey who am I they said like you know but then the angel came because you cannot start your ministry without having Angelic visitation amen Leia cannot get out of Darkness without Angelic visitation when William bham came to us is the Angel of the age amen and when William bam came to us he came with six wings with humility hiding his face hiding his feet and with wings it he did fly and by him flying among us we saw him from 47 to 65 we saw all the moves of his ministry then when we sit under that Ministry we know that if we keep our eyes on him we're going to receive the same blessings as he did and Elisha who was also called said that this is the only way for us to receive the blessing is to see him to watch him glory be to God that we have these tapes of available to us for us to know what is the absolute and if the prophet is not the absolute if the word is not the absolute then what is the absolute because the Democrats are bringing an agenda the the Republicans are bringing an agenda the Communists are bringing an agenda we've we've seen all these things on the past few services and as they are coming and what is the end of our what is our faith because they're not fighting those people out there because they already won them but they say we're coming after your children and if they're coming after our children then us the children then we must have a safety we must have a place that we can come and hide ourself under we must be able to identify the place where he said like you know come he's The Refuge we must find The Rock we must find a place where that still small voice is still speaking through but then we can find that that's still Small Voice in dispute and debates and movies and and all kind of filthy lives and things but then he provided a place he said that you know uh in the leian church age he [Music] said a momentary consideration of the of church history would prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dogma and Creeds and and not simple word it's exactly what is happening today no we can't take this butam is wrong on this or we can't take this butam did mistake here butam did a mistake here why because that's the spirit of organization we take what pleases us what fits us especially with our cultures oh you know with our cultures you know we we think that we have the right kind of music and kind of atmosphere the way to conduct the service it's exactly that same Spirit it begins in a very humble subtle way before you know it it's like you know we don't really want to listen to that we don't really want to take that into consideration because the prophet really didn't really mean that why it is that same Spirit then God send s sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from the from God became the living EP pistol read and known of all men for of all men for their generation elishah was to sit under this man Ministry for him to become the word made manifest in his day and the word in this hour tonight is still the same and he has sent us William brunham so that we can become the word because Elisha was sitting under Elijah's Ministry showing us his life story showing how the woman understood that Elisha was under elijia Ministry for her to become for him to become her absolute because the word didn't come from uh start from with uh with elishah but Elijah came to restore the altar amen Elijah came to destroy all the false prophets and when he did that was to reestablish the word amen come from wherever background that you came from all of us we have to leave all our cultures our mind our ideas our self centeredness all those things we have to put it on the side and take everything that Elijah is saying and whatever Elijah says amen amen if youah say that your sisters I want you your place to be here amen it might not make sense as yet it might not even be clear but glory be to God that when we saw the communism that the way if it came into the people people could we couldn't even realize it that's right we said y we we don't have you know the jobs that don't pay enough anymore the way they used to pay now we have to have our women to also start working but then it comes to say that's communism we couldn't understand it but then when if we are Elijah today what do we say Amen Lord I don't know how you going to do it but I have to believe it I don't see how is it going to happen but I have to believe it because the woman when she took Elijah as her absolute right she didn't know if the baby was going to raise or not right because all the Medical Science and everybody all the smart people showed her all the evidence that the baby is dead all the economics of the World shows that if the two parents do not work they cannot pay all they cannot meet all the needs of the family my everything is showing there but Elijah said I want you first to be [Music] healed I want your husband to be in your position it is hard for the woman to understand that that's what Elijah want but as long as we are under his ministry he said take the word your place is to take care of those babies you Minister your job is to sit down and study the word and pray over it you matters your your your time spend it in prayer for your CH your children am regardless how hard it is but the Bible the brother say we carry on the the people who took his Revelation from God it was not wly coming with his Revelation the fact that I'm taking the word my life journey I took the word he said like you know this is your life everything that I tried to do oh I want to go and become a nighty guy said like no that's not your job well I'll go and I'll start this business here I'll probably go leave it he say no I didn't tell you to go there he want he has a people in mind and we are that people am and we are the chosen one that he wants to fulfill that Revelation because by receiving that revelation we are becoming the living Epistles how you making it in this generation no girlfriends no boyfriend no this and all that because we took the words of Elijah and Elijah to us as he would go to God and say Lord you know one thing that in my life I never committed adultery he also want to have sons and daughters also in this last day you grew up in the message you are born or with all your virtues until you get into the marriage like that God wants that to happen and he has people in mind and that people is us and that people we are the ones that are called to that that great vision the people who took his Revelation from God became the living a pistol read of and known of all men for dead generation ation when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone he has gone on through the years until until this last day there is again another people in the Land There is a people again in the land it's not the future now tonight and he says who under their Messenger right people who will sit under the messenger not people say oh no I I know also I can also preach the Bible no you cannot preach the Bible yes amen you take what Elijah told you bring it in the Bible then you'll be able to preach the Bible you didn't know what the D of Jesus Christ was until Elijah came forth yes because that's the greatest revelation of all time because if you don't have the revelation of Jesus Christ the rest of the Bible is blacked out to you and yet we have people who say know I can also preach from you know from on my research and development and you know I've studied and but God didn't send you God didn't send you regardless of the research that you've done God didn't send you yes Wesley and and all of them they didn't send themselves because many times that the people God sent they don't also don't always like to go and when you come to us like you know I know I know I know we can clearly see like n that's not kind Godlike we know people that God s they know they understand that the work is to too great Moses god I can go you see me I can talk you Ela go I don't know why me I'm je go I have excuses me Gideon go I am the least Joshua go I no all of them have always had excuses because they know the warfront is not a joke because standing on the pulpit is not just coming and one quotation two quotations and you go no after this I have to deal with Spirits after the word so therefore we have first to sit under Elijah because Elijah will tell us demonology how to work with them and if we do not sit under his ministry then we are just exposed to all kind of things no wonder we see today people just you know gets the church make a lot of money gets him under organization he's dead and forever but if we have to be that people in the land today brother says who under the Messenger will be the final voice to the final age for you to be the last voice I am the bride I am the bride stay under the messenger stay under the messenger what the prophet says that's what I believe for my family for my household and for everybody else amen yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it it it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride amen here goes not the greatest challenge ahead we sit under the messenger after the that's why as I laid out my a little bit of my life there you putting all this you know natural hair and long skirt and all this you don't do this you don't paint your nails and all this you don't stay under that that level because he says that you know God will confound the church there are people in other words there are people who are going to challenge your faith why why why why why it's it's just a pent it's it's just there are pens for women there are pens for men but all you know is just pens it's just I have to wear skirt now you are faced with a challenge then you have to challenge yourself you have to know where you standing you are a housewife a a young boy walking around he's handsome look at him he doesn't work out but look at him here oh my God it it is the challenge you are a man now like you know God has blessed you now you have all the money and now here comes the challenge now you you as uh the brother was telling me uh in um in Mexico in Mexico they said oh he's single again when a a a married man goes out they say like no he's single again that's the challenge I Hadad it says he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says that in the last chapter of Revelation the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be rep repudiated in as in the first age Amen to sit under Elisha's Ministry is not an easy ask that's right brother I went to South Africa first time ever in my life I face this challenge in the house I see a young man and a young girl coming out of the room my first reaction said where are the parents I said this is shouldn't this shouldn't be possible they shouldn't be then I start realizing oh who am I who am I what am I doing I've had all these experiences what am I doing how am I going to deal with this oh daddy's not here oh mommy's not here nobody to look after me nobody to tell me one two three oh I can go out whenever I can oh I can do when whatever I want nobody's looking after me there Comes The Challenge it's either I had a proper conversion or I didn't because at that time the only person that I couldn't fool was myself because going to church I will show up like any other brother right I will shake hands God bless you we know the the the the greeting God bless you brother God bless you how are you oh Shalom my brother shalom but here now on the street nobody was there with me if I had not said truly under Elijah's Ministry then I wouldn't have known what way to to take then came the challenge along you don't drink really even a little bit H you know this one here it's not uh I believe uh you from South Africa you know Savannah you can have some Savannah you know it's says it's just probably uh uh 5% or less than 5% of alcohol maybe I should it is a challenge it's not a joke of uh I think that you know I'm in the message to have uh to have the title of the message but it's at that time that the time that you spent you invested in your younger age you'll see that that now come to pass take the time now that you are young yes take time to invest in Reading yes sir brother you may not see it the reason why you're doing now but that investment will bring forth dividends in the appointed time that you will expect the least invest that time now yes sir the same way that Daniel 14 years old went into Babylon for him to be able to stand there and say like you know I'll defile myself not against with the meat of the king it was the investment of all these 14 years prise God many times we think that you know oh I'll just go to church I'll just say no come to church bring your pen write it down go back review it it might not make sense today brother say I spent two years studying the Book of Genesis it didn't make sense to him you're not alone under this journey it's not an overnight success he wants you to invest more in those years so that in the appointed time then now you're going to see the men of Faith rise then you'll be surprised is this still me how was I able to overcome that how did it even come to pass who am I that is our life Journey amen that is the mystery of elishah under Elijah's Ministry it was not just like you know going to church coming back home and stuff and praying with the parents and things right he said in Joshua Joshua chapter 1 uh um verse one now after the death of Moses El leta's departure the the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nan Moses Minister MOS Moses Moses Minister saying my servant is dead 1965 now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people and unto the land which are give to them even to the children of Israel he's not commissioning Joshua yeah this is 1965 the man is laying there in the casket some of them are still wondering is it going to raise do you think you know maybe we should wait maybe have a plane somewhere you know waiting for him to come back but God's program was unfolding because if they had set under his ministry listening to what he was telling them showing them God's program they wouldn't be the waiting for him because they were under the ministry but they couldn't understand the move of the ministry from one member to another member she is not she she's still thinking that she's still a little girl she wants to wear high heels and all these skirts and all these stuff she doesn't know her body has already changed that now she has come to maturity that when she's walking around in the street people are noticing her right she wants to to dress like the rest of the girls like no Elijah told you go up go here sit under my Ministry if you want the blessing this this is how you need to dress God willing will'll get into that in the uh in the next series God willing the outer coat the the the holy place and the holy of holies and at times we get influenced by all kind of Ministries keeping us bound but we need to be aware to sit under Elijah's Ministry we get to that by God's grace but he say you know stand up go take now the work to get going he say every place that the soul of your food shall tread upon that I have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness of verse um verse 6 to to save some time it said be strong and of a good courage verse seven only be thou very be thou strong and very courageous they say this is your ministry now this is your time for you to work I'll Lead You In all these steps here they said but be thou strong and courageous I said when he gave me the scripture when I was probably 16 I say why is he saying about like you know being s courage and stuff I think it's just another reading of the Bible you know maybe I don't really but I didn't know whatever you saying you need to take into consideration he will tell you something but you're going to face the challenge five six seven years later it's not because like you know it's a sermon mixed up with somebody life story that it's just maybe it's just another sermon no he's preparing us for the journey ahead he said be thou strong I read it I said well maybe it's like but this was supposed to be brother Bram right he's the one who take us out of Egypt and bring us into our promised land now I'm having confus mind battles now how do I reconcile what brother Brenham place is and me receiving this scripture about Joshua who am I going to bring into the land I'm I'm not I'm not a minister I'm I'm just here you know helping cleaning the church and maybe a little bit of Sunday school here and there you know I'm around all these elders but God's grace God has given me that that Grace to always be around these men these men of God but he was preparing me he's preparing each one of us he said like be thou courageous when you go out there be strong verse seven and then it goes again verse 9 he say have I not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage three times and when God is repeating the same thing over and over and over you better pay attention to it because he knows the challenge ahead because he knows that it's not a picnic that you're going to I'm going into Canan land oh we going into Jerusalem no you have to go up right amen you have to have the breastplate you need to have the soul you need to have the helmet you need to have the sandals you need to be wired up but I'm saying you need to be prayed up because the challenge is real as the brother likes to say the struggle is real because you're not going to when that boy the fantasy that you like to have about girls or boys and you see it's that very girl walking up to you it's that very boy walking up to you now you you having all these mind bottles what am I going to do oh my God how is it going to happen now I don't know what to do and all these things here that's where the investment that you made right amen learning how to sit under his ministry because everything that Elijah is telling us say like you know hey you the H the head of of the household look at your position you need to L them in prayer you you don't need you need to apply the blood you you just think why should we pray every morning and every night why should do you can you guys can read your Bibles right you read we'll have our night devotion at night you come back how I'm very tired don't you have homeworks to do go finish up with your homework then we'll get to that then before you know it you asleep and you think that you are being courageous and you are just pleased that your children your family is getting degrees and having making all this money but you don't see the distraction but you don't see communism coming into play right by the time that those children turn that family turn against you then you sit you say how did this happen to me but you were not aware you were not awakened you didn't pay attention to Elijah's voice I thought I would read the scripture that would uh that you would understand that the holy spirit that was Upon Jesus on this on the on this church today a moving is the same manner as the robe of Elijah fell down so the uh so these things that I do greater shall you do if I go unto my father and the Rob fell upon fell on the day of Pentecost that brought the glory back to his people but God but God lives in his church and he says and his spirit moves upon his people we must first realize that we living in a day of skeptic generation of people will not believe Jesus said though though the dead be raised they wouldn't believe them word has to be fulfilled this is the hour in which we living in after you we sit under Elijah's ministry under we face all this challenge for some of us at this stage but God's grace God willing in few weeks uh uh speaking about uh my life Journey that it has the desire to be married and this is one of the greatest challenge in our day right we walk in the churches we see even in brother brenham's time marriage a big challenge a very big challenge all these Investments people make they get into marriage it all breaks down then you wonder did they not invest did they not believe did they not sit under Elijah's Ministry here's the prophet says we must realize we're living in a day of skeptic many things will happen I am really asking for your prayers because I've been in this uh uh relationship for about since 2021 uh she is in the Congo God willing in uh few weeks she'll be among us I haven't uh set the date uh to to be married yet but once she's around I spoke with brother R and uh I'll be also reaching out to some people that he told me to talk to to help me with the wedding to prepare the wedding but it shouldn't just look it as like you know a joyful thing I know it's a joyful thing but the challenge that we seeing today we're dealing with in the in the message particularly people will get married and they can't make it through a year or two the wife is on the left husband is on the right if uh you have time in your daily prayers when you don't have enough time to do anything or you tired of praying remember me I'm really begging you or beseeching you remember me in your prayers because I've seen as I said my life I've shown you a little bit of my life story here that I think he has called me to do this work here everywhere that he has sent me there's no better success that I've seen in my life it's when I'm serving him and you know brother Bram says that if my wife divorces me I'm kicked out of the pulpit remember did devil will do anything in his power will try in any shape or form to try to take me down already just being alone all these years that I've been preaching we've been dealing with it yeah when you pray when I go I was was uh in Mexico here in Mexicali the pastor's daughter for six years never had a child then they came to me I say you know who am I I said well we'll just do what the prophet says set up the atmosphere start talking to the sisters talking to the brother and I prayed for him and I passed and I forget and before you know it you can verify this with brother Jose those who know him he is usually my interpreter down there is actually the one who told me he say hey do you know that uh the sister conceived I said oh okay good to know passed and then the K like hey the child is here then you understand another sister in the El see you say brother my uncle is dying you come you pray the Lord opens up the way amen and many other things a sister was a emic and uh in Colorado I just knew it when I went back there said do you you know when you prayed for her she had a blood issue but from the Time You Prayed he was gone amen but then at the same time some of these events always stay in our minds then you start going back and say oh now I understand after this I was going through such such a trouble such this such a this why because those Spirits they know you the channel through which yeah very good we were kicked out now we're dealing with you the reason I'm saying this now there will be another person who will be headed next to me who will also be the target of those Spirits right though said we know that marriage is something to be joyful about right but he said be thou courageous I'll be courageous but nevertheless but what I'm say the success of my Ministry is I have people 6:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. 12 300 p.m. 6:00 p.m. 900 p.m. and on and on praying for me and we are called to work like he did and I'm coming and I'm asking prayer in front of the church because you'll be helping me naturally setting up the wedding and all these things but also remember the most powerful weapon that the Lord has given us is prayer because it is our ministry you might not be on the pulpit but if you are the prayer Warrior remember me remember our pastor remember our young people remember our sisters remember the church yes so that the work can unfold amen because after this we see that the challenge come and we're going to close here quickly and when Elijah came into his ministry after Elijah's Elijah Elijah's departure and when the sons of the Prophet uh 2 King verse1 15 and when the sons of the Prophet which were to view Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah do right upon on Elijah on Elisha and they came to him and and bowed themselves to the ground before him right after they saw the Spirit upon the sky the worship started you are greatest Pastor great ministers great song leader they start bowing before him and here's the challenge he said like you know the challenge is going to come but he didn't know how soon this is going to happen those who were married before us they didn't know how soon the challenge is going to kick in those who have been preaching they didn't know how quickly they're going to get into trouble and they bowed before him and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servant 50 strong men remember this 50 strong strong men under Elisha's Ministry three times the king had sent 50 men to come after elishah the Same Spirit also coming after Elisha he say like you know you know they they're trying out like you know to get him into a certain form of security and said they said unto him behold there be with thy servant 50 strong men let them go we pray thee and seek and seek thy Master Les per Adventure the spirit of the Lord have taken him up and cast him upon some Mountain or into some Valley and and he said ye shall not s if this not returning Ministry let's go look for him let's have a plan let's have some some ideas of our own our security of our own you know when you get into America there'll be this challenge here and this this here it's like no Elijah didn't teach us that Elijah told us that we have to be young people holding the flame of the of the ministry we have to be this a pistol red of all men in our marriages in our families in everything that goes with it he told them no don't go but the Bible says and when they urg him till he was ashamed brother you have to do it brother you have to do it brother sister you have to work in Sister you have to work sister you have to work sister you have to work okay maybe I should just work you can wear pants you know it's just a pant you know it's just a pent you'll be beautiful you know just cut a little bit of your hair just a little bit of your hair just a just a clear base on your on your nails you know just a little clear base just a okay just a little bit of foundation you know just a little bit of foundation just straighten it up a little bit just straighten it up a little bit just a little bit you know just a little bit you know then he said maybe I maybe I just I'm just a girl like the everybody of the rest of the girls maybe I'm just a boy like the rest of them maybe I can just have a girlfriend like the rest of them maybe I can just have a girlfriend though I am married nevertheless maybe I could just you know be running around without anybody knowing maybe I could just watch a movie there and nobody knowing why the pressure was upon him because he told him he said be the courageous three times and then before he knows after the Moses Elijah's departure here comes the pressure 50 of them try to convince 50 people of your of of your holy ghost of your faith at school at work try to convince 50 girls walking up naked before you not saying a word it requires really a lot of strength some of us said well I'll just probably you know start my own company so I can control everything then the law said like you know you cannot discriminate when you're hiring and the most qualifying person look at the way she's dressing and when she comes to work there Comes The Challenge you try to hide under the work but what couldn't hide you you try to have a professional as much as you can but then she can make up a story and she'll be believed and where is our refuge but he said I need you to stay with everything Moses my servant told you I want you to create the atmosphere that's where the greatest battle ever fought comes into play she comes in with all her attire but then when the angel of the Lord stands around as the prophet says you know she came in and say sister God bless you you know he liked the way he dressed the girl went was at school alone nobody with her say oh you know for you to play with uh everybody in the gymnastic you need to put like no I'll stand with the word nobody was with her but the angel of the Lord the the Lord went to give report I say sister when you took that position the angel of H was very happy at times we think that we alone at school you know nobody's looking nobody's uh nobody knows me around here no the angel of the Lord wants to see that because every time you come to church the word is taking place be natural keep your virtue don't let those boys put your hands on you right amen until that day then when you see that you may think like you know it's just the this little steps yeah it's building up it's shaping a whole different person inside of you he wants you to keep that hair just going as long as he wants you to he he has given you the ability to it's not you go you cut your head then you try like you know to put some something underneath but say you know here here's the place that you're standing to close it says then when they send him he say like you know you shall not go and when they pressed him he gave up to the pressure said okay you can go and they went and they said they sent there for 50 men and they went then they sought three days but found him not and when they came again to him for he Terri the Jericho he said unto them did that not say unto you go not we need to come to this place this is the ministry will get into the other part of his ministry when the ministry get gets into it affects we have musicians we have mothers and fathers and deacons and song leaders and all of us and this is where Elisha's Ministry kicks into play because the ministry to see how communism is coming to the nation Right is coming to the church people can't even realize it that's EXA and the way the pressure is going how we out to understand to stay under the prophet's message how this Prophet this message will give us all the blessings that we want amen and how the challenge is going to face us right after this and when we are able to overcome these challenges each one of us can go and study our own lives and say like you know hey this is my challenge here this is where I take the pressure from right for for me it's music for me it's money for me it's a woman for me it's a man for me it's all these things here each one of us must be able to understand our 50 men where we get our pressure from I can easily get under depression we need to be able to understand those places so that when we are able to overcome then we'll be able to see what comes afterward may God bless [Applause] you amen the musicians would come believe we've been challenged tonight to press deeper into him was thinking of that song take me deeper how many can say that's your desire
