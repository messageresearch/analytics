everyone tell them what Jesus has done for you amen get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is King get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is King oh get all excited could tell everybody [Music] that Jesus Christ is still Hing sing it one more time oh get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is King oh get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is King oh get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is King Jesus Christ is still the king of kings amen God bless you for singing for us tonight God bless you earlier this week I uh needed to learn a thing or two about love so I listened to When Love Project and brother brandom was talking about how he thought Jesus didn't like him but God loved him and he learned that Jesus was the very heart of God and um I I really enjoyed how you know I pulled the quote here he he just described how John 3:16 when God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him would not perish but have everlasting life so he said God's love divine love to Adam's race when he loved it Christ stepped out Sovereign Grace took its place um so I thought I'd sing 10,000 angels that Jesus could have called a host of angels to take him down off the cross but he didn't for you and I so I hope it's a blessing to you [Music] today they bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where he prayed [Music] they led him through the streets in [Music] shame they sped upon the Savior so pure and free from sin they said crucify him he to [Music] blame he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the [Music] world and set him free he could have called 10,000 angels but he died [Music] alone for you and me upon his precious head they placed a crown of thorns they left and said behold the king they struck him and they cursed him and mocked His holy name all alone he suffered everything he he could have called 10,000 Angel to destroy the [Music] world and set him free he could have called 10,000 angels but he died alone for you and [Music] me when they nailed him to the Cross his mother stood nearby he said woman Behold thy son he cried High thirst for water but they gave them none to drink the sinful work of man was done he could have called 10,000 Ang to destroy the world and set him free he could have called 10,000 angels body died [Music] alone for you and me to the howling mob he yielded he did not for Mercy cry the cross of Shame he took [Music] alone and when he cried he is finished he gave himself to die salvation's wonderous plan was done he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free of God 10,000 angels but he died alone for you and [Music] me for you and [Music] [Applause] me amen such truth every time I think about Calvary huh it ought to strike something inside of your heart and saying if Who Am I who am I that a k king would come and die for that makes you somebody very special this prophet of God began to tell you you know he says when you begin to catch who you are who you are a lot of times we see him but we don't see oursel but he says you're a part of me you're bone in my bone flesh in my flesh you're a part of me you was always in me you are always will be if you ever are a son of God you always were he said you just came to the realization Malachi 4 that voice came quick and all of a sudden hit hit that predestinated seed when it did it was quickened you just came to life that's all yes sir Hallelujah God quickens everything by his voice God bless you all this evening I love you I appreciate you being here this evening amen you know it was not the nails that held him to the cross it was his love he said no man takes my life from me he said I lay it down told pones PA you you

of course he's not at home he's he's uh traveling the world again and he actually he actually prefers that that way uh just being honest he uh he he likes to be on the road he likes to be doing and going and I'm happy that he's still got the ability to do that it's he is uh he's just one of those men that like brother Ron said he'll as long as God gives him breath he's going to be a testimony to somebody and so we're thankful for him I'm happy to be part of the family and uh but you know there's a family that's closer than that and that's the family of God and I'm so thankful that there's a tie that binds us closer than even blood relations you I'll tell you what you ever realize you ever get to the spot where you got family that's that's Wayward or family that hasn't come in yet your relationship with a Believer is closer than your blood family and there's only one thing that could do that that's the blood of Jesus Christ so I'm thankful that his spirit that there's a love that pass passes all of our understanding and and I trust tonight that some that the Lord will say something to you I you know if you come with an expectation God will grant you your expectation I was uh I was at some meetings down in newfinland one time and had a h you know I was preaching and I got talking about you know expectation how that this little song fill my cup Lord I lift it up and you know uh I just I got ministering and got walking down the aisle somehow got the freedom of the Lord was there I got free you know and and I got I stopped by the seat where this young lady was and I said sis I said did you bring your cup tonight and and she said yes I did I said expect him to fill it and well the next day I met her just walking into the into the pastor's office and I I I said oh even and sistera said did you bring your cup and she said no brother Dwayne I brought a barrel I said well God bless you now that's an expectation Saints you just bring the barrel when you come cuz if you I I mean he there ain't no shortage to what our God can do I think we just ought to expect great things all the time that you know that's just the way that's the kind of God we serve and I'm and I'm happy to be in uh in part of his great family anyhow just let me say thank you to uh brother Mark and sister Tina uh you know uh with the exception of your pastor and his wife you know there's a there's a every time you know us Northerners come down we get all this yeah God bless you brother Dwayne one of these days we're going to come up and see you and I I uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh I don't know what's the attraction in the South but I know that there's not a lot of Attraction up north most of them are waiting for a millennial reain but brother Mark bless your heart now we brother Mark and sister Tina came to visit us this year and we were just so happy uh that we could have some fellowship again and and when we came back I don't know what they all paid you all that came on the bike trip the other day but brother Ron I had some of the finest Fellowship while we were biking around the mountains brother Gustaf where are you at sir that was just some of the I tell you what you you can't even do that in a coffee shop that was just some good and God bless you have you got your Bibles tonight I hope so why don't we stand together Luke turn over to Luke chap 11 if you would and Luke the 11th chapter when we're done reading this we're going to pray and you pray for me that God would give me just what we have need of tonight and and know when's enough is enough and Luke 11 starting at verse one and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and he said unto them now why don't you know why don't we just say this together and he said unto them them when you pray say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth give us our day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil and I think the last part of that says for thine is the glory Glory forever and ever amen God bless you Saints you can have your seats I want to take one little portion out of that uh out of that scripture and I would like to pull out that last little portion in verse two it says thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth and if I was going to put a a title of any kind to my thought tonight uh I wan to I want to title my thought tonight my ways are not your ways and then if I could put a subtitle behind that I'm going to just say this it's not all about you I know that's hard for us to comprehend in lady OA that it's not all about us brother Johnny what happened to you last time I was here you were sitting right up here brother Ron did you scare him off I did it's not all about you brother Johnny is not the way isn't that isn't that hard for us to comprehend in this world though somehow in our little life and all the uh you know the pressures and not just the pressures the spirits that have have taken over lady oia somehow we have come to a conclusion of some kind that life is all about me and everything is seems to have to revolve around me and and if it doesn't revolve around me then something's wrong but but let me just say it this way one more time tonight let this stand as a record that it is not All About You Now let me now let me build on that tonight not that it shouldn't be but let me build on that tonight because God's ways are not our ways his ways are different and when we get to you know brother would say this you know God's like a he's like a great drama producer and you know if we would say it like this you know brother Bram tells us that before there was a world and before there was a moon and a stars and before there was even a universe that we were there then he he he actually asked job job where were you when I laid the foundation of the world and the sons of God shouted for Joy I don't know about you but I was there then I was one of those sons of God that shouted for Joy but can I just brother R can I just use a a h h maybe can I just dramatize just for a moment if I if I could just get started just for a moment you know what what if while we were shouting for Joy listen you never had any idea about your birth you never had any idea that you were going to come down to a place called Earth there wasn't even one made you never had an idea that that you would be found in lady OA you and I were sons of God shouting for joy we were just enjoying the presence of God enjoying the glories of of whatever it was that we've forgotten about now but but listen what if Papa God would have stood up at that time and and he said and he would have said children gather around you know I got something I I want to share with you and I I want to tell you about something I I want to put together a drama and you maybe don't understand what a drama is but but listen I want to give each of you a a part to play and and I want you to play it well and and you know we'd be sitting there as children of God what is your very tonight your very heart if God would come to you and he would speak to your heart you might be in prayer saying Lord Lord I what do I do about this situation or Lord can I go talk to somebody Lord can I can I share can I share the gospel with with somebody and the Holy Spirit comes and talks to you and that day you meet that person you know that's a Divine appointment you know father set that up and you can hardly wait to get out what God's put on your heart all right let's jump back before the world began for a second and here's Papa God and he's got this great drama he's going to that he's going to he's going to begin to play out and he and he and he begins to talk about the different parts and he would say now listen Mark when you get you know I'm going to put you right there's going to be somebody's going to have to play a part right at the very end of this great drama and and I'm looking for somebody to play this part and and you know what you're going to have to it's not going to be an easy part brother Mark it's listen I'm I'm telling you son there's going to be some hard things that you don't understand but are you willing what would be the first thing you would say if if he if he would have put it out if Papa God would have put it out this way and said who's willing which one of us wouldn't have jumped up and said I'll take it I'll take it I'll do it right yeah the difference is you and I had no idea what we were volunteering for we just want to be in his will we just want to we just want to make whatever he wants we want to make him happy and so when we come down now we're here found ourselves in a fallen condition and everything about your life is up and down and up and down and and great turmoils and you know it seems like things Change Daily you can be happy a meadow lark and standing on the mountain top and singing the Praises of God and go back home and all of a sudden you don't even have to go home man your phone rings boom and you something comes across your plate it's enough to make you want to throw up sometimes it's like oh my word I can't handle any more of this God's ways are not your ways now listen David was that kind of man David you know we we know David was a man after God's Own Heart I want to Brothers if you could throw up um script rure Psalms 139 I want to just read that as we get started this morning or this evening it says oh Lord thou Hast redeemed me here's David a man after God's Own Heart a man that could could get into the channel of God and the spirit of the Lord could could flow through him and he begins to speak he says oh Lord thou H has searched me and known me thou knowest my downsitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou compassest my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but but but lo oh Lord thou knewest it all together and thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me now listen to David listen to this statement like he is Overjoyed with the presence of God he he's he's thrilled with the presence of God listen to the statement he makes such knowledge is too wonderful for me to know that you'll never leave me and you won't forsake me and Lord you've got my best interest at heart listen he says such knowledge is too wonder it's it's high I cannot attain unto it now watch verse seven whe shall I go from thy Spirit here's the question whether shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend into the heavens now catch this tonight church if I Ascend into the heavens Thou Art there and we can all say amen yeah Lord we believe that but now watch the Revelation that David has cuzz the same God that was with him is with you tonight he says but if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there what a consolation what a consolation for whatever we're going through tonight whatever we're going through today you know Psalms 13 David would you know we're we're I'm just going to use the flip I'm I'm going to flip back and forth you know here's David rejoicing in the presence of God but not every day is going to be a sunny a bright sunny day and the lake is calm and and you know the wind is at your back and the fish are that's it's not every day can be that way God's placed us here with a purpose to mold character in our lives and there's only a there's certain ways that God does this and so now let's jump to Psalms 13 for a minute and David is in a totally different position in his life I don't know how far this goes or how you know what time frame this is but you and I know by experience that that things can change in a moment and if you don't if you haven't forgotten just go back to 2020 for a moment when everybody's lives got turned upside down at least over in communist Canada listen Psalms chapter 13 here's David when his life has changed completely and and things have gone wrong and and and he begins to he begins to cry out in his heart and he says how long will thou Forget Me Oh Lord forever the same man brother Ron that was just proclaiming come on Church how many times you're you're rejoicing Sunday morning and and you're so enthused about the word and you're so thrilled with what God is doing and you walk out and Monday afternoon you get a phone call you didn't expect and now you're in the same spot David's in Lord how long will you forget me oh Lord forever yeah I mean we he he just finished telling us that that Lord it didn't matter if I made my bed in hell you're going to be there and now he's questioning Lord do you even know who I am do you remember me come on this book is written for a reason I mean it don't just talk about all the glory of every man it talks about the downfalls it talks about our shortcomings and it's there to bring us courage church he says how long shall I take how long shall I take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall my enemy be exalted over me consider and hear me oh Lord my God lighten mine eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death lest mine enemy say I Prevail against him and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved but I've trusted in thy mercy and my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me what is it this is the same man this is the same man that that that that just we could say in days and moments in in months maybe in years whatever but things don't always stay the same church things don't always stay the same and and I I'm saying this to remind you that God's ways are not your ways we just we just finished praying Lord let thy will be done as it is in heaven so on Earth well he's got a Heavenly plan he's got a Heavenly plan that's got to be played out and you and I are part of the plan tonight now listen David the same man would come to a spot that he would become so heavy in his Spirit whatever whatever position he was in he become so heavy in his spirit and just cuz you're down doesn't mean that God's not there listen David would begin to in in in in in this great groaning in his in in his Spirit he'd begin to he'd begin to cry out my God my God why H has Thou forsaken me well you know that wasn't David we know that actually that was the spirit of God ing through David and then the very same Spirit would God himself when he was hanging there on the cross he would himself cry out God why have you forsaken me so if that same spirit is living in you tonight then you shouldn't be all worked up you shouldn't you shouldn't be distraught when things don't feel good because this message never came to assure your feelings of your salvation this message came to assure you that God keeps his word and that what he started he's going to finish and the work that he begun he will finish it Lord I I want to I don't want to be found with my lip hanging on the ground stumbling over it but I want to rejoice in these things Hallelujah you know we we can look and I'm Lord help me to to to get to where I need to go tonight but you know we can look God's ways are not our ways and and here you know here the very Christ Jesus Christ himself that the very God of Glory the Bible would say he would come to his own now I want us to catch this tonight church he would come to his own and as he would begin to pour himself out remember they were looking for a king they were looking for a king they were looking for the god of creation to come down and the truth of it was when Jesus stood there and he began to break the bread and he began to uh you know change water to wine and the Dead begin to be raised and they literally begin to call on him as king hosana The King hosana The King they were looking for a king for a new kingdom to come and they thought that he was going to that that kingdom was going to officially be there then they were excited listen Church they were excited finally they were going to they're going to rise up above their Roman captors and and they were going to be the people of God again and a and a Godly King was going to lead them but Watch What Happens cuz your ways are not God's ways and your thoughts are not God's thoughts and they were under expectation for him to become king and the Very King that was coming brother would say this God would blind their eyes God's own children he would oh church I hope you catch this tonight he would blind their eyes to do what to bring in a gentile bride to bring in people like you and I brother on he would take in blood God's ways are not your ways and his thoughts are not not your thoughts there's no way you would have done that there's no way I would have done that but God Almighty he had a purpose and he had a he had a thought in his mind and and the vision of God was to bring in a gentile bride and that would make listen who would do that to your own your own children the ones you love we wouldn't do that church we wouldn't do it in our Humanity but God had a greater plan Hallelujah he was going to redeem a people from every Kindred and every nation and every tongue and she was going to love him not because she was forced to love him she was going to love him because that something inside of her and something inside of her fell in love with him hallelujah praise the Lord he literally would have to Blind their eyes the same here's his own children that would begin to call a call on his death begin to call him a be begin to you know they they stood there and called for his own blood let his blood be on us be on our children it doesn't make sense brother Ron it doesn't make sense but God's ways are not our ways you know we can we we can just jump we could just jump some 2,000 years just just jump right down here into the into the 1900 century and what they proclaimed with their voices here's the Jewish people and pretty soon the Germans and Italy and and you know all these different we got Hitler and miscellania we got all of a sudden the pressure begins to come on what's God doing he's running his children home but the very same ones that said let his blood be on us and our children and our children's children brother Ram would say and here Here Comes an ikeman and a Hitler and 6 million Jews I think they slaughtered him like you blood running everywhere and then he would say and every one of them received a white robe God's ways for what brother Mark for you because we're here church because of a gentile bride he didn't have to do that but because he wanted a gentile he wanted not just a Jewish bride he wanted a gentile Bride for 2,000 years now we look around us even now here Israel is being tormented and bombarded you know they still hate the world hates Israel why because they're God's children and yet he loved you he loved me you know brother Brandon would say this the tender hand yes of Jehovah he the tender hand of Jehovah if that was the tender hand of Jehovah running his children home through persecution through hardships through through trials that that you and I can't even hardly comprehend how much more is the tender hand of Jehovah leading your life guiding your life and when things don't go the way you thought remember this is not all about you when it don't go the way you thought remember that God's ways are not your ways hallelujah hallelujah Isaiah 55 would say this for my thoughts are not your thoughts and neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from Heaven returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void Hallelujah it shall Brothers I don't know about you but my God he can't lie my God he can't lie he can't change his mind and he can't lie listen it shall accomplish that which I please now listen to this and it shall prosper and it shall prosper in the thing where where to I sent it really in the hardships in the struggles in the trials in all the hardships that God puts us through and still somehow that word in you is going to prosper you're here here's your pastor speaking to you just before I get up here and he said listen you were part of that word then and now here you are as an attribute a manifested Son of God word of God attribute of God manifested in the 21st century it shall prosper I'm not talking about money church I'm talking it's going to bring to pass what God has put it here for Lord that's what I'm interested in the rest God will take care of Psalms the Bible says that the Lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance you know listen here's a I'm thinking back to Israel again and all these and I'm thinking about these six million Jews and you find them in Revelations chapter 6 what is it white robes given to all of them every one of them because our ways are not God's ways now let me just let me just bring this just a little closer to home tonight Lord help me not to be too long you know we we we we we we we we get in the scriptures and we we get to read reading and I don't know about you but this is our Lifeline this is our Lifeline we deem it more essential than our daily bread are we better anyhow because your daily bread it'll run out in about three hours but two words out of this will keep you running all day that's a reality now listen you know we look we look at the scriptures and we begin to read about Solomon you here we are in a kingdom that's falling apart now and and more and more we begin talking about brother dway it can hardly wait for the body change we can we can we're starting to groan we're starting to cry we're starting to actually Express Lord I want out of here not just us old people no no young men young women are saying oh I can hardly wait is it almost over lord we begin to look and and our heart our hunger is is the reality that we we came from in the beginning was Perfection we want to go back to that and so when we get in the scriptures we begin to we begin to looking at this great man Solomon and brother Brown would say you know Solomon had a kingdom that that that that to this point we we realize it was a a shadow of what is to come but but there Solomon had a kingdom that that there was no Wars and there you know everybody was in Harmony and it was it was beautiful and and the whole the whole Kingdom prospered it was under the hand of God and the and the whole Kingdom began to prosper now let me just let me just give you a little a brief if you would Brothers First Kings chapter 4 I'll just give you a little brief of what what Solomon's day life look like you know this whole world the whole American dream is to have a have a life like this a Canadian dream too by the way First Kings chapter 4 and Solomon's provision for one day listen to this Solomon's provision for one day was 30 measures of fine flour three score measures of meal 10 fat oxen 20 oxen out of the pastures 100 sheep besides hearts and robu and follow deer and fatted fowl for he had Dominion over all the region on this side of the river of tisva even unto aah uh over all the kings on this side of the river and he had peace on all sides around about him and Judah and Israel dwelt safely every man under his Vine under his fig tree from Dan even unto beers Sheba even all the days of Solomon wow can hardly wait I don't know what it's like to have you know three consecutive good months in a row just the way life is right I mean about the time you get comfortable you just expect change expect change but listen we look at Solomon we and we think of the glory that God was trying to express in a natural carnal man now my question is but how did Solomon get there this man that is that that would type Christ the coming Prince the coming king of a new kingdom that's that for a thousand years there's not going to be any death no sorrow perfect peace there it's going to prosper how did he get here how did Solomon show up now remember God's ways are not your ways how do how did Solomon show up what brought Solomon on this Earth I mean God predestinated him to be on this earth now watch how God brings it to pass you see his ways are not your ways here's this a great king called David a man after God's Own Heart a man after God's Own Heart who literally loved the Lord he loved the presence of God his his whole being was set to do the will of God here he is a a you know he he battled out half his life and now he's King and and you know he's got he's only got 500 wives brother on 500 wives and one day he just happens to be walking on the wall and he begins to look over the wall in his kingdom and you know he begins to look down come on the Bible says the footsteps are the Righteous are ordered by God and we don't understand the end you only know today I only know today and David begins he looks down and there's a woman having a shower down there and she's dressed probably less than most of the women in in America right now he stops for one moment well we already know what his problem was 500 Wives come on let's just be real okay so that wasn't the that wasn't the bad part that he sto well sh hold on let me say it right I mean he stopped and looked he didn't he wasn't condemned for that the problem was I I suppose maybe he checked his time and the next day he made another round found out it was the same and and and one thing led to another pretty soon we have this man of God this King and he begins to talk with this young lady and he begins to uh something in his heart begins to to pit or patter in a way it shouldn't listen she's a married woman she's off limits she's off limits he's a king he can have any virgin he wants she is off limits we're talking about God's ways are not your ways come on Brothers it's not I want to say this it's not all about you it's not all about you here's David God had a plan that no but David didn't understand God's plan listen here he comes and now all of a sudden he starts this relationship you know with bash Sheba and here it's his best man Uriah one of his one of his great Fighters it's his wife yeah and David to to to bring more shame upon everything here I I mean David doesn't just take her H you know as his own wife but but he brings Uriah in and has him killed it it don't make sense God's ways are not our ways he's predestinated a Solomon to come why wouldn't he just bring it you know just righteous and godly and and holy and everything would just be just right but God gets no Glory out of everything just right church God gets Glory out of making things just right hallelujah it's hard it's hard for us to understand how anything good could come out of this here's David's got a you know here David's got another man's wife pregnant now he takes the man and gets him killed so you know everybody's always trying to cover for themselves don't you just love that we're shame on us but that's the kind of people we are man you do something wrong and you'll squirm and you'll twist and you'll paint a picture to you know to try and make it look this way and you'll tell people this so it kind of looks this way and God's looking down and he sees the reality of it and your heart knows the reality of it it don't matter what you tell people it don't matter what you what picture you present God knows and you know David knew he was in the wrong David knew he had made a mistake David knew it should never have happened in walks a prophet Nathan begins to tell him this story about you know about this sheep and the and the rich man and his sheep and how he had somebody coming and how he took the poor man sheep and David gets all self-righteous and says hey that man's going to pay for his sin he's going to die Nathan looks him right in the face and says David you're that man why why cuz God's ways are not your ways and his thoughts are not your thoughts if he's going to bring something to pass he's going to bring it to pass the way he ordained for it to come to pass Hallelujah the good part about David is when he was when he was confronted with him immediately he fell on his face and repents Hallelujah God loves to take things that look all wrong and make them right make them right you know sometimes we come up against things in our own lives and things that we can't understand we just seem to can't wrap our heads around it and we ask the question why why I just want to read this quote out of the message of Shalom brother BR says this many times people ask why they ask some sometimes they ask me why why must these things happen what why why did this happen to me or why did I start and this happen and I had this trouble here and this upset me and I lost this here sometimes I've asked why here's brother Brown saying sometimes I've asked why when I was a young Minister first started out did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby right out from beneath me right beneath my heart why why did he do that I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his come on church and kept trusting him when we can't understand it and our question is why just keep your hand in his and keep trusting him it'll be it'll it'll come out sooner or later amen you know I I think sometimes we get in situations and and things happen in our homes and in our churches and and immediately it doesn't matter uh there's got to be somebody somewhere that will point a finger and try to condemn it you know there was lots that could have pointed their finger at David we would have pointed our finger at David let's just be honest we would have pointed our finger at David and we probably would have condemned him but God didn't God didn't now the Bible says in in St John chapter n there was a there was a man that was born blind there's a man that was born blind and and if you keep reading down in the scripture you find out that that the question was well why is this man blind why is this I mean let let's just bring it home like it would be today you know we we don't much preach to the Pentecostals and the Baptists we preach to message people and and so everything that we look at is that something happens oh it must be because of that oh if that happens well then it must have been because of that and we always want to make our assumptions and our predictions and our you know we're so quick right and and so the people would say well they would come to him and say listen the reason he's blind is there there must his mom and dad must have done something wrong they must have done something wrong Brothers can you mute me for one second thank you God bless you but the scripture says this it says that when Jesus was asked he said neither has this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him sir well he must have sinned and that's the reason he's in this position he must have you know it's got to be God coming down and and and smiting him because of something he's done secretly no it's not that at all we need to get rid of that kind of thinking God has a plan for us yes if you've sown you're going to reap there's no question about but that's not that God's not going to condemn you on that listen that sometimes things happen good things ha bad things happen to good people I just say that bad things happen to good people and we don't understand we can't make it work in our minds but God has a plan and if we ever lose sight of the fact that God is in control of this we've lost everything church then we might as well eat drink and be marry and tomorrow we die because if what good is it going to do us listen God is in control of our everyday life if you are a new creature in Christ then my scripture says that your footsteps are ordered by God the very breath you breathe is God given to you and he's absolutely ordained a path for your life Hallelujah all right so sometimes bad things happen to good people and I want to say it this way brother Browner makes a little I'm reading a quote here tonight brother Browner has a a woman show up in the prayer line that's got I think diabetes maybe or something let me just look back for a second here uh yeah she's got she's she had something bad on her her ankles and she she's been walking with high blood pressure and let me just go to this and he says he he begins to State he says now dear heavenly he goes to pray for this woman he says now Brothers have you got that can you throw that up he says now dear heavenly father our beloved sister stands here yet a young woman but Satan would give her a stroke if he'd uh if he could and he'd lay her up yonder on the bed of affliction he'll put her out of commission if he can now watch what he says for he don't want her testimony why did this happen to this Christian why we would question or those are those who would not understand but father we know that it was For Your Glory oh I hope we could just catch a reality of that tonight whatever position you're in it's for his glory let's just remember this it's brother Dwayne I I I just can't see it it doesn't matter what you see tonight it's for his glory listen he said he said one time uh who sinned this boy or his mother and you said neither but that but that the works of God might be made manifest we believe that for our sister this morning we believe that's the reason her ankles God in that condition we believe that's the reason the high blood pressure struck her so that you could show her your love and kindness to her your ways are not God ways his thoughts are higher than my thoughts so we believe that reason the high blood pressure struck her so that you could show her your love and kindness to her that you could prove to her that you're the Jehovah who heals our diseases Hallelujah isn't that beautiful what kind of testimony ought we to have tonight Church you sick tonight you're not yeah things are going wrong you know uh what kind of testimony ought we to have we ought to be able to get up every morning put our hands in the air you know stand up by our bed and say thank you Lord for healing me amen amen here we're sitting here tonight I'm going to just go on this little thought for a little while longer here that God's ways are not our ways and and you know it's not all about you we're sitting here tonight at the end of the ages we're on the brink right now if I could I just say how I feel I believe that Time and Eternity is Blended I already believe it's Blended we've already been caught into Heavenly places in our spirits and our bodies just got to catch up there comes a time when everything is done the consummation is over we stepped into that other dimension and it's finally complete but even now even now we're sons of God even now we're sons of God we're sitting here today and and for years now your pastor's been preaching from the open book from the open book that God would come and that he would literally come down and break the seals of in the back of the book and begin to to pour out his heart and his mind to his childrenall and we're enjoying revelation after revelation after Revelation we're walking from Glory unto Glory from Glory unto Glory we're enjoying it all but Church how did that book get here amen how did that book get in this book let me tell you how it got in this book here's a man some 2,000 years ago by the name of John who had one time was a zealot who who one time was he was so on fire for the kingdom of God that that when somebody disagreed with him he's like should we call fire out of heaven and and should we have it consume them and the Very God that he was worshiping looked him in the face he said you don't even know what Spirit you're of but now watch after the trials and the struggles and the troubles and and here the Bible says you know John would be he he become a pastor and because that he gone through so much and he gone through you know had so much wisdom let me just refer to you brother Ron I'm going to put you as John tonight you know been through so much and had so much life experience and so much struggle and so much trial had he had gone through and he actually had an understanding and he could literally get down to where the people live help them through their troubles and you know brother Brown would say this John you know John the people loved him so much that they would come to him over and over and if he had a phone it would rang constantly he was busy you know as a pastor doing a p but listen if he would have stayed being a pastor and just gone about his daily taking care of his sheep This Book of Revelations would never have been written one day God was like John I need your attention and so John in order to get your attention I'm going to do something that you're not going to appreciate you're not going to like I'm literally all of a sudden one day there's a knock on his door door here stand some Roman soldiers this humble Meek Pastor the same one that would would would call fire out of Heaven is now saying Brothers love one another fervently love each other Above All Things love one another most so mellowed out by all of the struggles of life and now here he is in his old age and now there's a a knock on the door and there Roman soldiers standing there and they haul him off for what what did he do what had he done wrong only tried to help God's children haul them off to a to an island listen Church it wasn't like jail today where they give you three Square meals a day where somebody like brother John would make sure you were fed and you were watered and you had a good bed to sleep on no no no it was serpents and scorpions and rocks and and caves and and God's son God's God's child Lord what are you doing h I I mean John went from his nice cozy bed to a to a rock pile and and and and Lord what are you doing and I got criminals around that want me dead and they're out of their minds and Lord what what's going on here listen we don't know how long that that John had this turmoil and oh no now what and and what what what's tomorrow going to bring and can I sleep with can I actually go to sleep tonight or do I have to keep my eyes open and somebody going to kill me and listen we don't know listen Church John was not on the island for John's sake John was on the island for your sake and for my sake cuz this book never got open till this time Hallelujah yes sir listen it wasn't all about John matters of fact none of it was about John he might have the devil might have come to him and said oh God what did I do Lord how did what did I do something wrong he might he might have checked every facet of his life and went back it wasn't about John it was about making sure that the word of God would be it would be hidden away that the revelation of God would be given so that a bride in the last day could literally have it given to her so she could take the same book and eat it Hallelujah God's ways are not our ways listen Psalms 138 says this the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me amen the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me the Mercy oh Lord endure thy mercy endureth forever forsake not the work of thine hands [Music] hallelujah it's not all about you John would have had the same question Lord why why but God was working something greater out oh don't never lose sight of the greater picture of God how many were at the beginning of the service how many's hands would have gone up and said Lord I'll I'll do that I I'll volunteer Lord you know one day Jesus he was out in a boat this Runner comes running up to him master I have a I have a message for you it's from my master and he's you know he's he's going to have a great feast and he wants you to come would you come I can see Jesus say tell your master I'll be there you know the little Runner goes running back days go by and pretty soon the feast day begins to come we know the story Jesus shows up at the feast walks in nobody acknowledges him we're talking about a king of glory we're talking about my king nobody acknowledges him nobody gets down take and clean his feet nobody gives him the time of day but somewhere back up yonder or down the street a little ways is a little woman listen Jesus didn't come to Simon's house it wasn't about Jesus coming to Simon's house for Simon's sake it wasn't the fact that brother Ron he could mix he could rub shoulders with some of the finest preachers in the world it'd be a good a good ministerial convention and we could all be there together and you know I could Jesus didn't come for that he didn't come so that he could you know cozy up with Simon and and and somehow fit into their great organiz he didn't come for that he didn't come to have his feet Washed by them he he didn't come to put on their nice robe or their nice perfume that they should have perfumed with he didn't come for that sake it wasn't about Simon and it wasn't about the rest of the ministry that was there it wasn't about the nice house and the nice food and and the wine and and whatever the conversation might it had nothing to do with any of that why because God's ways are not your ways if Simon only would have recognized IED if he only would have recognized how put out he was when he saw this little woman that had this bad reputation if he would only have been willing to sacrifice what that little woman sacrificed to get in the presence of Jesus Christ do you know that that God that Jesus literally forfeited all of that just for one woman for one woman that had no reputation for one woman who had spent all that she had for one little little Alabaster Box he gave it all up he never came for anybody else other than her just so that his word could be fulfilled listen God's ways are not our ways why would he do that I don't get it church I don't understand why would this God come this very one who could have spoke a world into existence while he was there the very one who who who who raised the dead and gives sight to the Blind and knowing that they were calling him for to degrade him to make him little and why would he do it because there was a seed there because there was a seed there and he lit listen Church we're looking at a man that that's rubbing shoulders in the world and the dirt of the world's on him and his garments are filthy by the world stepped out of the portals of Glory to to to shed his Robes of glory and put a garment like yours and mine to go and redeem his own oh but we live in lady oia you know how we would have done it brother Ron we would have ran we would have got into town I'm going to run into you know Phoenix I'm going to find out where the best Motel is I'm going to make sure that when I get there that I can hand the valet guy my keys he can drive my car off make sure that somebody notices while I'm getting in and out because we think it's all about us we think it's all about us but Jesus don't work that way Jesus don't work that way Hallelujah the same God would cross the Seas to a man who is literally out of his mind if he could cross the Seas to reach him what about you and I tonight you know sometimes things happen in life and we don't like it but how do you know except that God has allowed that to transpire in your life and now he used that to push you out of your little comfort zone the place that you have loved for so long and been so comfortable at and now all of a sudden it's gone and Lord now what do I do and now I begin to panic and I don't understand and he'll use that in your life to assure you that I will never leave you he'll use that in your life to make sure well brother Dwayne you don't understand you know I can't even afford to pay my next bill but he can listen he promised he he'll never leave us and nor forsake us he's still the god that knows where there's a fish where there's a coin in a fish's mouth he knows just how to take care of it just trust him just trust him Hallelujah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil I'll fear no evil you know we look at we look at Great men like like Moses I'm going to I'm going to ask the musicians come I'm going to try and just get closed here we we look at a great man like Moses you know predestinated by God himself to lead a people out of is out of Egypt you know wouldn't it just made more sense just to let him come in as a great warrior it wouldn't have made more sense just to just bring a whole army with him and just take out Egypt and what do you think would happen then brother Ron you know we're so human that as soon as something I hope this is all right I hope this is all right you just let the spirit of the Lord move one time somebody comes to get prayed for in your church and you have the blessing of praying for that person watch God supernaturally heal him it's pretty hard not to think that you had something to do with that isn't it because we're prone to think it's it's about us it's nothing to do with you nothing to do with you your hands are his hands your feet are his feet Hallelujah here's Moses now here's this great man is that strange God would bring a great man like Moses he's trained him up Mo from a child he understood that he was supposed to be a deliverer you know what his problem was he was unregenerated he had a temper he had a temper brother that temper was bad enough that it killed a man one day God would use a man like that a man that would have a temper and that would murder somebody go God would use somebody like that oh yeah yeah because his ways aren't your ways his choices aren't your choices you would have fixed you would have picked somebody better but God Specializes in things that we think are impossible Hallelujah you know that now just watch watch the picture what did that one what did the murder of that one man cause in Moses's life it caused him to run off into the Wilderness and there God could

got to do is is look after these stinking criminals over and over and over and over and over and over day after day until he was so weary of his life but something on the inside there there was something that had never been satisfied in his life in his life little did John and and and and and Paul who is it Paul and Silas little did Paul and Silas know that morning come on church it's not all about you it's not all about you little did they know that morning when they got up when they begin to preach the gospel and the authorities come in and begin to beat them and and and tie them up and throw them in prison listen Church little did they know that that morning what was coming their way but it wasn't about them it wasn't about Paul and Silas in prison oh we read the story and we're so thrilled the angel of God comes in and and he and he breaks the chains and and he sets them free it wasn't a about the angel breaking the chains come on church it was about a soul it was about a man that God had predestinated to life and here's two men bleeding and broken and now the spirit of God comes by to encourage them and as they walk out here's the man standing there ready to take his own life and they're like don't hurt yourself don't hurt yourself Hallelujah it wasn't about Paul and Silas it's not about you tonight whatever position you're in it's not just about you tonight

yourself the choice to choose you as a son or daughter you wouldn't have done it why because you know yourself you know your faults your failures and yet God his ways are so far above your ways his thoughts thank you Jesus so why I can Rejoice here stand behind this Pulpit it's not because of me it's not because of something I've done it's not because I kept the word it's because you kept your

mountain right now Jesus said you can be movers of mountains if you will ask something in my name will I not give it to you he told the disciples if you had Faith you'd speak to the storm even the winds and the w waves obey what kind of man is this man what kind of people are we that we would have the ability to be able to speak to storms that we would be able in this loudan age to speak things

would be easy amen but he's promised to be with us each step of the way he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb he never offered the victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in just hold on our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to clim he never offered a victory without fighting he said help would always come coming in [Music] time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision brother Amos if you would come G just hold on our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire just hold on just hold on our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire [Music] again wow sorry I'm wearing the T-shirt but it wasn't for me it was for my sister today was her last day of chemo and uh she rang the bell and we wanted to thank God praise the Lord and I told her today I said sometimes your second chance is so much better than your first one you know we all need a second chance that's what Calvary was for thank you Lord let's just bow our heads dear heavenly father I certainly was just reminded once again how your ways are so much greater than ours and how all the bad it's actually for the good if we could just look past the situation and the pain and the suffering that comes from with within the the trial and you could realize and have faith and confidence that on the other end of this it's for something it's for a purpose it's for a person oh God I know that my me personally I just feel like the closer I get to to you I don't worry about things I just have confidence Lord knowing that you provide all things and it's just an it's just a normal thing for me to trust in you I just can't help it Lord I it's not about me it I remember the the very scripture the steps of the righteous are word of the Lord I when I first came back to you Lord you showed me that it wasn't that the steps of the righteous were always righteous but they were ordered by you and we heard about that again tonight Lord and I started even thinking of Stephen who would want to get stoned but the prophet said he didn't even feel a stone but in his death Lord there was someone there you could just take about every story Lord and realize that there was someone there that benefited from the pain and the suffering Lord help us Lord Lord to yield and to not live selfishly help us to be present Lord to be aware of the needs around us Lord to not live for ourselves but to live for others Lord the disciples asked you one day how can we love you he says when you love one another you're loving me help us Lord to show your love one to another we love you Lord we thank you for this service pray that you'd just go with us in our separate ways give us traveling mercies bring us back back together on Sunday Lord if it' be your will be with brother Billy Lord be with the Reagan family and the different ones Lord that the Parker family and I believe the bagots are all related the church members the family the body of Christ Lord pray that you'd just help us Lord to have more compassion one for another Lord but Lord we have confidence that even in death Lord that there is a purpose and we love you Lord and we trust you and we don't question anything you do in Jesus name amen amen you are dismissed tonight in Jesus name [Music] amen [Music] sh [Music]
