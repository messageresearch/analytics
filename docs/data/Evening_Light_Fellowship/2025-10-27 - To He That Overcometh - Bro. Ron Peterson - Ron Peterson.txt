We drove out here, wanted to take a little road trip, give my wife some of her bucket list. And uh and so visiting Brother Warren for his 50th birthday is so valuable to a friend, a colleague in this message to me. And so it's a privilege to be be with you this morning. Uh let's just let's just I want you to remember something. You know, as we as we approached the Lord with our needs, I want you to remember the prophet is the only one that taught us the reason there was a fall was because God wanted to reveal his attributes. &gt;&gt; And so people even bride people become sick so that God can glorify himself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so the thing that you go through is not for yourself, it's so that God can be glorified in you. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet said like for healing, if there's if there's not a reason if God doesn't show you why he won't heal you, then we claim it. &gt;&gt; We claim what he's already done. He can't if he was standing here in the flesh right now, he couldn't heal you because he's already done it. And so we just need the faith to grab hold of what he's already done. So let's bow our hearts. Our heavenly father, &gt;&gt; as we have come this morning as as a a portion of your bride, Lord, in this end time, Father, with a a claim on your word like no one like no one in any age before has, Father, as as the stargazers have expanded their understanding of the stars and the universe continues to get bigger, Father, that was your first word and Lord, this word that you have given us is also, Father, as we read it, as we look at it, as we sit under the the the canopy of this message of the hour, Father, these words are becoming more more valuable, more uh more consuming for us. And so, it's it it's it's in the knowledge of this word that we approach you this morning. And we thank you, Father, for what you're doing among us. We thank you that you have brought needs before this bride of Christ because these are needs that can be ministered through the branches of the tree of life. And we claim Lord the healing. We claim the deliverance. We claim the the peace. We claim the the comfort. Whatever whatever is the need before us now, we claim it because you have promised it to us and we thank you for it with all of our heart in Jesus wonderful name. Amen.

[Applause] Stay, stay, stay, stay. &gt;&gt; I just want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I want to thank you for all uh for remembering us in prayer where we in the Philippines and we know that the prayer of the saints as the prophet said are million times stronger than angels. So we were kept by your prayer because when we arrived in the Philippines there was a lot of earthquakes multiple places and we are just kept by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So before uh we go to the mission report I would like to read a portion of scripture which can be found in Matthew chapter 24 verse 47 and 48 and 49. and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. We are witnesses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not only ministers, but even uh as a member of body of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And behold, I send the promise of the father upon you, but carry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high. And as the the prophet said, you have no right to preach the gospel unless you meet Jesus Christ personally. So the commission until you are endued with power and I believe we are now endued with power on high. Amen. So we are our life is a testimony and we become the witness that uh our God is a living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So can we pull out the map of the Philippines brother? The Philippines. Another one. So, so that's uh Philippines is uh located in the south southeast uh Asia and it's composed of 7,67 uh 41 islands and almost 2,000 island are inhabited. So it's a big island composed of 116 million people. So it's comprised of three big island. the Luzon which is the northern Visayas in Bindanao. So we were located when we arrived uh we left uh August 8th and arrived in October the 10th at around 12:30 p a.m. So uh we were picked up by brother Danny Dil Mundo and put us in a hotel. So we have a good rest in that Friday. So just to refresh ourselves and relax for ourselves. So brother Ron is so sick at during that time when we travel and he said that if I cannot make it I will send you but in my heart I know that I can go but I am not the right person for that occasion. We always need to know our position. So we've been praying for that and I I can go but I am not the right person to do that occasion because it's a ministerial banquet uh uh meetings. So it's important that an elder from from the message of the hour is uh very important. So we arrived and there was multitude of earthquake in the part of Bisayas. There we can see in the central Bisayas and the northern part of Luzon and the Mindanao area there was multiple earthquakes. One is uh 6.4 the other one is 4.9 the other one is 5.6 and there was always a lot of floods and typhoons but by God's grace as I said it was by the power of your prayer &gt;&gt; that keep us during our stay there. So, so we uh Friday we arrive and Saturday uh brother Danny Deluno pick us up to have a lunch and uh after the lunch we have an casual fellowship with some of the ministers that arrived earlier for the occasion. So we have uh this agenda of question and answers about the message of the hour and uh it was really a blessings. So Sunday morning uh start of the service. So we have services Sunday morning, Sunday evening is a banquet then Monday morning. So when brother Ron stand out he opened with a word that he says I didn't come to bring you revelation or teachings or doctrines but I but uh to put you in remebrance to put you in remembrance of the things that you have already &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; heard so it makes a a calm spirit among the ministers and he opened in the book of Exodus chap 23 verse 20 and he said behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in a way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him and obey his voice, provoke him not, for he will not pardon your progressions, for my name is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, an adversary unto thine adversary. And he titled the sermon, keep by the power of God unto your destination. So it was a powerful service and everybody enjoy the presence of the Lord and I feel the spirit of God moving and I forgot to take photo of the event. So I we are focusing on the sermon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And brother Ron don't need really interpreter because his English is so clear that even the little boy after the service said that that's the kind of preaching that I want. So it was a blessing. things that after the service everybody is still enjoying the the the word that we heard even little boys and they're enjoying it. So after the service we have a lunch again and break time. After that we go to our hotel to have refresh relax and prepare for the banquet that evening. So if you have uh some picture brother that you can uh pull up the ministers I don't know if the I don't uh yeah so that's the only photo I got that's uh almost the ministers that attended the service this morning. So another slide. So brother Ron is preaching. Maybe there's another one. So that's the church of uh brother Danny Del Mundo. So while brother Ron is uh preaching introducing himself uh do you have uh the the video one of our Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to be here in the Philippines once again &gt;&gt; and to be with you knowing that God that children all over the world, &gt;&gt; different color skin, &gt;&gt; speak a different language, &gt;&gt; but we have the same father. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to have my wife and sister Sandy to be here with me. &gt;&gt; I saw a miracle today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You had my wife come up and see Next uh video, the miracle that brother Ron says. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that's enough brothers. So that's a real miracle cuz brother that's the first time that happened in his entire ministry. So praise the lord. So this is the fourth time that I am brother Ron traveled to the Philippines and second time for sister Sunday. So it's really a blessing and it's an honor to be with brother Ron in this trip. I really enjoy them. They are so much fun to be with. So I'm see to it that he is uh okay. So we bombarded them with the vitamin C. So they recover easily. So I always stand at his back make sure that he's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. So so the next uh after the service that morning so we went to the hotel and relax and refresh ourselves for the banquet. So if you have the uh pictures of the banquet uh vers so that's brother Ron uh the title of uh the theme of the banquet is 20 years and beyond. So 2025 and beyond it gives tributes to the pioneer of the message in that area because the area in where brother Danny lives is formerly a leaper colony and it was dreaded by neighboring towns but there was two brother who was converted to the message of the hour and they were the one who pioneered that area and God's blessed that area right now. So, uh, brother Danny gave tributes to the wives of those two ministers and, uh, it was quite, uh, it was, uh, quite, uh, very successful event because they planned, uh, a year a one almost one year that they planned it. So as brother Branham said that uh it's nice to have a friend and meet new friend but there's nothing like old friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was a beauty to behold the unity of the brothers and sisters and it breaks the wall of misunderstanding. It breaks the wall of dysfellowship &gt;&gt; and uh long friends become friends again. &gt;&gt; So usually it's almost the same spirit. So sometimes uh there's a misunderstanding, miscommunications, somebody thinks something like that and it separate the fellowship. But this event is very uh uh memorable one because everybody see each other and they forgot all the differences. They just hug one another &gt;&gt; and uh reminisce the the time that they were uh they they receive and all of that. So it's very memorable that the presence of brother Ron is very special. So he's like a father mentoring to his children especially when he shared about his life testimony meeting with uh Billy Paul and brother uh Joseph because it's really significant because there's always a lot of followers of Joseph. So when brother Ron share about his testimony about Billy Paul and and uh brother Joseph there it seems like there is a man who knows personally brother Joseph but this was not very boastful about himself. Oh I know this I know that he's just humble person he make it common. So it's just a special things for the believers in the Philippines. So after the after the banquet Sunday evening so the following day Monday so if you have uh the slide brother for the ministers meeting so there was uh so some of the ministers so the the attendee of the banquetss almost 250 uh ministers and their wives. So the next slide uh so by the way it's still going. So that's brother Ray Soraniano the if you remember brother Aser Gab Gabriel that's his pastor in the Philippines. So if there's other slide so just you can go. So this is uh Monday morning uh there is a wives minister's meeting. So sister stand shar something in there and uh we have the also the minister's meeting at the church. So, brother Ron is uh sharing the gospel and there was question and answer and the agenda for the question and answer is guess what what is the difference between the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost and new birth. So before we went to the Philippines that the subject that is brother Ron is also preaching in our church. So God is so on time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the minister that attended almost 50 ministers. So it was really a blessing that some of their question were answered and they requested a copy of all uh brother one is uh uh sharing to them. So after the minister's meeting then uh Tuesday uh we flew to uh Shangmai. So so that's the Philippines. Shang uh Thailand is west of the Philippines. So that's we're in Thailand. So we uh there's only one direct flight from Manila to Shiang. And I told brother Ron if you there's only one uh way one flight direct but the time is 900 pm and we will arrive at 1:00 a.m. So if you want to go to Shiang in the early hours we need to fly from Manila, Bangkok and Thailand. So it's double flight. So he said that I don't mind flying 9 and arriving at 1:00. So he's okay. So I booked the ticket and I called my Filipino friend who's now residing in Bangkok to prepare a taxi for us when we arrive at around 1:00 a.m. So do you have a picture, brothers? Uh the taxi driver that uh pick us up at the airport. So my friend already arranged for a taxi to pick us up. So when we arrive at 1:00 a.m. we meet that brother or not brother. We met the taxi driver and he made our day because oh that's me. That's that's my name. What is your name? Say what? Yes. What is your name? My name is what? Yeah that's what I'm asking. What is your name? What is my name? That's why I'm asking you what is your name? My name is Mario and what is your name? My name is what? Yeah. What is your name? In other words, what means temple? Oh, I got it. So, he made our day and made us a good lap early in the morning. So, we went directly to the hotel and have a rest. And uh since the meeting will be in the evening, so we explore the land, spying the land. So we're just enjoying the tropical fruit, the coconut. And she's just standing enjoying the second round of coconut juice. And so we explored the the area and uh we meet uh uh brother which brother Rondown introduced to brother Mark. Uh by the way brother Rondon's parent are here sister Judith brother Steve God bless you. So their son meet uh can uh Thai Taiwan uh Thailanders and brother Rondon introduced cyan to brother Malcolm. So when brother Malcolm knew about our travel to Thailand he gave the contact number to brother Ron. So when we arrive, brother can say meet us and if do you have some pictures there brother can you just pull it up. So I thought uh before we go there I thought that it is only a house meeting but uh it was really a church that he bring us to and I realized that uh Thailand is an open country for Christian. So actually there are five major religion in Thailand. Buddhist, Muslim, the Hindu, uh the shik and the Christian. So I thought that they are pure Buddhist. But uh I just know that there was a Christian. In fact in Shiang Mai there was a huge uh Christian school, a Bible school in that area. So that is brother Zion. And as we begin to have fellowship, I asked about him about the books. So we just be very careful what we meet. So I asked him about the books if you have. So he said we don't have books. Have you heard the message of Dawa? So he said that he's just listening to YouTube about brother Bham occasionally. So we're concluded that they are just new to the message of the hour. They don't know anything about really deep into the message but he entertain us. He prepare a dinner and you know that uh uh when I travel uh abroad I always brought my wife with me because he can easily uh join or mix can easily uh get in to to some of the sisters there. So while we are fellowshipping we know that uh brother was always on fire to share the gospel in the message. In fact uh the one who attended that uh evening mostly are new converts to Christianity. uh they are from Buddhist and converted to Christianity just three months some four months and the other one brother Pisit he was uh he was on fire to share the message or the gospel of Jesus Christ to his villages but he has no Bible school background so that's why but he was always on fire so all of them so during the night after the dinner they prepared us a dinner uh Thailand uh uh delicacies they have crocodile curry. So we tried crocodile curry. Sister Sandy tried crocodile curry. So brother Ron always a chili uh one bowl of chili always prepared for him. So we enjoyed their hospitality. So after after the dinner we have a song uh worship. Then after that we have uh testimonies. So brother Juan gave the testimony and share my testimony. I know that when I asked him what is your background Christianity? So he said that evangelical. So are you are you uh what is your organization? Are you independent or are there you have a mother church? So he said that uh they have a mother church but they operate independently. So I know that the evangelical are trinitarian. So I start to gave testimonies about my conversion in in the message of the hour. So I bring it very subtly and about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, son, holy ghost is not a name but that's a title of the name. So so after the testimonies uh we have a prayer meeting. So brother Pit so that's why he asked for prayer. He has this uh in his side he is aching for some times and we prayed and after we prayed I mean the next slide so he's moving his uh &gt;&gt; he feel healings after the after the &gt;&gt; so he's rejoicing and uh so everybody after that go one by one everybody have a prayer meeting during time so we have we enjoy the fellowship we enjoy the the meetings and uh we has uh uh bring the message very wisely to them &gt;&gt; so that they will not be choked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So after the meeting, so the following night they invited us again for dinner because they have question about the water baptism in Jesus name. So brother Ron did the followup of that uh Friday. Then uh uh after that uh uh the next library. So, so that's not the one the the last day in Shangmai. So, after the meeting, the last day in Shangmay. So, we have nothing to do. So, we just explore the the area, see the So, sometimes we don't really explore all the city because if you see a temple, it's just all the same because in every corner there's temple. Every corner there is a temple. So, we just explore. We rented a called it they called it talk. So we rented it for one hour to room around the city see what's the city likes. So that's our last day. So there's a crocodile barbecue that we enjoy and so we have a nice dinner beside the river because since it was our last day. So we have a good time. We're enjoying our time together there. Sandy and brother Ron and since there is no direct flight from Shiangme to the US so we need to take a flight from Shiangme to Bangkok. So we spent two days two nights in Bangkok then to the Philippines. So the last slide is when you see brother Ron and Battle. Uh the last slide please. So that's so that's uh another slide. So in our apartment there's always an image there look like Bettle. So every morning brother hi betel. Good night Betel. So when beta pick us up at the airport that's the slide of the show. So thank you very much. God bless you. Let's stand together. I speak the name of Jesus. Brother Robert, if you'll start us out with that song, please. &gt;&gt; I just want to speak the name of Jesus [Music] &gt;&gt; over. I know there is peace within your presence. I see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Your name is power. Your name is power. Your name is healing. Your name is mine. Bring every stronghold shine through the shadow. [Music] Heavenly Father, as we come to you this morning, we bow ourselves in your presence. And we would ask heavenly father that you would come and grace us now with your presence as you walk among us. Speak to every heart. Open every eye. Lord, for we know your Bible is hidden from the wise and prudent, but it's revealed to babes such as would learn. So, Father, we are here this morning to sit at your feet &gt;&gt; and ask you to come speak to us. &gt;&gt; Let thy word, Father, may it become alive to us. May it become quickened because the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. Therefore, Father, may the author of that word come. May the Holy Spirit have preeminence this morning. Bless each and everyone we ask in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you musicians. God bless you. Thank you brother Mario. There we went to the Philippines and to Thailand and uh it's always a blessing to be a witness for Jesus Christ in other places. And whenever you have a new work, you realize just like it is in the book of Acts. And many times what it is, God gives you an opportunity. You go there and then there's needs and you see needs among the people. You pray for them and God is doing signs and wonders. people are getting healed and everything like oh wow they realize that God is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we appreciate that and and we just see what the Lord would have for us in the future uh in going back over there. Uh amen. Let's just remain standing. Turn with me in your Bibles please to Revelation chapter 3. Very familiar portion of scripture. to each and every one of you this morning, all of our visitors and everyone. We greet you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Revelation chapter 3 verses 14- 22. And unto the angel of the church of the loudans, write these things, saith thee, amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou art cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods, and ha, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raignment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and to anoint thine eyes with Isab that thou mayest see. As many as I love I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. And to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. Even as I also overcame, and sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. I want you to to notice verse 21 because it's there that I wish to place my emphasis because this this is to a very specific group of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's to those who overcome &gt;&gt; that makes you an extra special &gt;&gt; type of person. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To him that overcomes will I grant with me. Will I grant them to sit with me &gt;&gt; talk about throne worthy &gt;&gt; to he that overcomes. &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to first John chapter 5 verses 2-5. 1 John chapter 5 verses 2-5. By this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not grievous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For whatsoever is born of God overcomemeth the world. And this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith. &gt;&gt; Who is he that overcomemeth the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in the presence of God. I want all of you to understand and take it very seriously that your destiny is to overcome not to undergo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not to be survivors of Laosa &gt;&gt; but overcomers of it. &gt;&gt; That is your destiny and you must claim it and you must believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I would like to title my sermon this morning he to he that overcomemeth. So I'm directing it to a very specific group of people &gt;&gt; to he that overcomemeth and I take a subject this morning of overcoming the effects of louda not just surviving it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I want to take this a little bit of a pastoral message because I'm feeling in my spirit to teach on this. So, it will be a help to all of you. I do not need to remind you that we are living in the worst of all ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where hell has the lid to hell has been lifted off. Demon spirits and all kinds of enticing, seducing spirits and deception which will deceive the whole world &gt;&gt; of those whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; So there's a great deception. There's a darkness over the country and over the world in itself. A gross darkness. And we know that the enemy is going around as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. And you and I have inherited a battle. It started in heaven, was cast down to earth. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham said, "And it has become a warfare here down here on this earth &gt;&gt; and we inherited it." So, but we've got to be aware of the what type of battle that we're in &gt;&gt; because we don't want to be one that just beats the air. We want to know &gt;&gt; what we're up against. &gt;&gt; We want to know the conditions that are going to affect us. &gt;&gt; Because the God of this wicked world has created an Eden in which that he can perfect sin. We're living in the days when they will call evil good and good evil. &gt;&gt; We can see it in the social media around us, whether it be in televisions, newspapers, radio or whatever. It has permeated America. That's right. &gt;&gt; That word overcome is only used several times within the scriptures with the bulk of that usage found in the book of Revelation. And we find out that it's used among seven church ages. &gt;&gt; To he that overcomemeth will I grant. And in each age there is something that they must overcome. &gt;&gt; And only those who overcome that in their age will be granted the reward what he says will happen to them. And we just happen to be that seventh age that says, "I'll grant to you &gt;&gt; the right to sit with me &gt;&gt; on my throne." &gt;&gt; You talk about a responsibility. I realize as a pastor in this age and as a minister of the gospel that weighs upon me heavily &gt;&gt; because I realize that God is going to hold me responsible to tell you truth. I am not here to just preach to you something that make everybody feel good. &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach to you truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we realize that in every age there is a prevailing spirit that dominates the agemen. &gt;&gt; And like a shadow that hangs over a mountain &gt;&gt; or like a coastal fog that enshrouds a coastline &gt;&gt; so does this loudian spirit hover over everyone that is living in this age. &gt;&gt; We all know that the spirit is speaking now to a directed group of people. I want you to understand God's word is direct. &gt;&gt; It is focused &gt;&gt; and it will produce what it is going to produce. &gt;&gt; It will not return void. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we all know that the spirit is speaking then to every age and gives the details of what they are to overcome. And the prophet of God said, "It's not so much what you overcome, but how you overcome." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want all of you to understand this, and that is you are meant to overcome this age. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to become a victim mentality, but a victor mentality. &gt;&gt; God has said, "I will empower you. &gt;&gt; I will grant to you the ability." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. to have a power that will transform you &gt;&gt; into a powerhouse of the living God. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be just little weaklings and just barely. I'm just hanging on. Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, the prophet of God says, "You watch what you have seen happen temporarily through my ministry." He says, "When that squeeze begins to come down, he says, you watch then that third pull." What is that third pull? the revealed word in its season. It isn't something that you pray about and say, "Oh, I want to speak squirrels." We're not talking about squirrels. We're not talking about healings. We're talking about the word of God when it's quickened, &gt;&gt; when your situation with your family, with your need. Because it may not be squirrels. &gt;&gt; It may be something else, but every one of you have got an opportunity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and a responsibility. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is power in the spoken word. &gt;&gt; None of you are going to be exempt from it. All of you will face it. All of you are going to go through trials and testings. Just as our father Abraham was tested, so will we be tested. &gt;&gt; Because we are the sons and daughters of Abraham by faith. Brother Brandon picks it up in the sermon, the adoption, 1960. Now, Canaan does not represent the age of the millennium. It represents the age of the overcomer, the dispensation of overcoming. Because in Canaan, they killed and burned and took cities. And there'll be no death in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now you all know that we that this battle that we fight, we do not fight against flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; but against principalities and powers of the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back in the days of Jesus, parents were not trying to be politically correct. &gt;&gt; They weren't trying to use words that would not offend others. Many a time they would come to Jesus and they said, "My daughter, my son is grievously vexed &gt;&gt; with the devil." &gt;&gt; They called it what it is. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand today that we must call what it is &gt;&gt; what it is. &gt;&gt; They are spirits. They are demons. They are demonic oppressions. &gt;&gt; But we have a right to cast out devils, &gt;&gt; to possess the gate of the enemy. It is our destiny to become an overcomer, not an undergoer. &gt;&gt; I want all of you to quit having pity parties. Oh, woe is me. I'm having such trials and testing. That's good for you. &gt;&gt; Knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious to you than gold. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So get happy about it. Put a smile on your face &gt;&gt; and say that Goliath is coming down. Yes. The age of pressure and nervous tension. &gt;&gt; But that goes along with the age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said we've got to know how to let off the pressure. Most of us do not know how to let off the pressure. We add pressure. &gt;&gt; You don't pray. You don't read. You don't seek the mind of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And next thing you know, you're you're going through trials and issues and you're wondering, well, woe is me. Why is God allowing me to go through this? Many times, the trial you go through is self-inflicted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So much of the time, our sicknesses in our bodies are because we got the wrong kind of diet. &gt;&gt; We're not eating right. I mean, come on. Use your brain for something to just keep more than just keeping your ears apart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You sit there and eat all that junk food, everything. It just tears down your body. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and ask God to bless your Big Mac and give it all the nutrients and and everything that you need when you know it's junk food and it's just going to make you get big and &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything around us is affecting us. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that televisions, radios, &gt;&gt; the internet, the cell phone, the magazines and the newspapers, everything is attacking the minds of the people. &gt;&gt; God help us. Never before has there ever been an age like this age. &gt;&gt; People's minds are going completely insane. &gt;&gt; 1965, brother Brandham says in a sermon, God's provided place of worship. Look at this teenage insane. Why? I told you the other day they was taking an analysis there in the schools of Arizona. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Come on. where I live and 80% of the children in school is mentally &gt;&gt; What will their children be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't have another generation. We're at the end. Jesus said these things would come. Look at all the television things getting these fictitious things in order. It'll come a time, I predict, that people will be completely and totally insane. The world will be. The Bible speaks of such hideous sites as they show in movies today of some prehistoric uh creatures egg that's lived in the earth for so many thousands millions of years hatch and come forth. Huh? That's just a minor thing to what's going to happen &gt;&gt; when hell is open. The devil comes out with all of its mysterious things. Women locust with hair like women teeth like lion. Why the world will be completely totally insane. It's not but just one degree from it. Now, &gt;&gt; the reason you feel the way you do so much of the time is because the cares of life &gt;&gt; didn't say sin. Cares of life choke the seed. &gt;&gt; If you're I listen, I'm not talking about smoking and drinking and and running around. I'm talking about cares of life. Loudia that'll make you lukewarm. &gt;&gt; God said, "I'd rather you be hot or cold." Don't be lukewarm. Come on. &gt;&gt; Too much of the time, what man calls middle of the road, God calls it lukewarm. God wants you to be on fire. God wants you to get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're just going through the motions. &gt;&gt; There's no real sincerity in it. You're not praying. You're not seeking God like you should. &gt;&gt; They asked Brother Brennham in 1964, "Brother Brennham, what seems to be wrong in the day that we're living a believer and following the message and messenger of today when you cannot seem to pray like you would like to?" How many of you feel that kind of pressure? &gt;&gt; Why is it that I I'm having a hard time? That's a good question. I believe brother sister ever who asked it it's a co it's because of the conditions of the time the revival is over the revival is lasted some 15 years never did last over that uh about three years I believe it's received its last revival I believe that's why you can't pray and feel in the spirit like you used to is because the revival fires has gone out brother picks it up again and Abraham's covenant concern confirmed. America's revival is over. It ended about four years ago. It's over. There's no more revival in America. We're only gleaning in the fields that's already reaped and burnt over. &gt;&gt; You pick up a stock once in a while, but very few. My brother, my sister, I want you to understand as it was in the time of Boaz, &gt;&gt; she found him harvest down harvesting the field. And when Boaz noticed her, he told those reapers of the field, "Leave her blessings. &gt;&gt; Leave her handfuls." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to understand, my brother and sister, every one of you, if you'll look and you'll seek, there are handfuls in your field, &gt;&gt; and you need to reach out and say, "God, fill my apron full. I want to come back and prove to my family I've got blessings. &gt;&gt; Handfuls. &gt;&gt; It's yours if you'll believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you're looking for some big revival and all this and that. No, it's going on in the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not all these people coming and big thousands. No, that it's not happening anymore. &gt;&gt; The big coliseums are filled with thousands of people coming to hear about Jesus. It's over. &gt;&gt; They'd rather have some rock concert. They'd rather have some big uh musician or or some kind of entertainment. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to entertain you. I'm here to preach to you the gospel. And I'll tell you what, if you need entertainment, this ain't the place to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed is now coming to maturity. &gt;&gt; It's forcing all the greenness &gt;&gt; out of the plant to go into the seed. &gt;&gt; The word is now becoming ripened within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know that the wheat is ready for harvest? &gt;&gt; When it bows its head. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It doesn't bring an arrogance. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it doesn't bring a hottie, I know it all type spirit. &gt;&gt; In fact, the more I learn and the more revelation that God gives me, the more it makes me humble and I say, "Father, it's not me. It's you. It's not my keeping myself. It's you watching over your seed." Why? You made a covenant. &gt;&gt; And you said in Genesis 1:1, "Every seed will bring forth of its own kind." And if God ever had a seed, hallelujah, I want you to understand, if God ever had a seed and he planted it, and when it comes forth, what kind of seed would it be? It's going to be God's seed. It's going to be godlike. It's going to be God attributes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "End time seed sign. There's a revival going on." What is it? the sewing. You don't hear much of Billy Graham no more or about oral. What about the rest of them? You know, the great revival fire is not burning. What is it? It's the end time seed sign. &gt;&gt; The words have has been sown. &gt;&gt; What is it? Denomination will reap denomination. &gt;&gt; That makes them confederate themselves together. &gt;&gt; But the word of God has been swed also. And when the spirit of God begins to fall, &gt;&gt; the word of God will live in the people. &gt;&gt; The word of God will live in the people. &gt;&gt; And the false bride that's committed adultery out there, brought herself into creeds, sold out her birthrights, &gt;&gt; will reap what? A confederation of church. That's to be bound and burned like thorns and thistles. But where the word of God has been swed into the people's hearts, it will reap a bride for Christ. &gt;&gt; As certain as I'm standing here, what is it? End time signs. &gt;&gt; This evil age of laia that we live in is constantly wearing upon each one of us. &gt;&gt; It's all around us. It has an effect. We know that your environment has an effect upon you. Right. &gt;&gt; Your work, &gt;&gt; your school, &gt;&gt; the music, &gt;&gt; you can't hardly go anywhere and there's just all kinds of stuff bombarding your minds. &gt;&gt; Greatest battle ever fought &gt;&gt; is in your mind, &gt;&gt; not in your heart. Thy word, oh God, have I hid in my heart. Most of you realize that your greatest battle is in your mind. &gt;&gt; And that's why you've got to take every thought, &gt;&gt; everything that comes to you. Brother Brendom, how do I know if it's my thought? How do I know if it's me or if it's the devil putting He said, "If it's bad, if it's evil, if it's corrupt, it's the enemy." &gt;&gt; He said, "Why?" The enemy has a right. Because you came into this earth hybrid born, &gt;&gt; right? You came into this world through a hybrid birth. That's why the very first teaching of Jesus Christ. No, you not. You must be born again. Because except a man be born again, he will not understand the things of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to be have the new birth. And when you get the new birth, then all things become new. And &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you become a new creature in Christ Jesus. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Peter, who do you say that I am? &gt;&gt; He asked the disciples. Who do they say I am? &gt;&gt; Some say Jeremiah, &gt;&gt; Ezekiel, &gt;&gt; Isaiah, one of the prophets. It might be John the Baptist raised up. &gt;&gt; Peter was having something inside of him. that was coming forth. It was bursting out of him. &gt;&gt; Peter &gt;&gt; see Jesus could see it. He discerned Peter. Peter, &gt;&gt; who do you say that I am? &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah. Flesh and blood did not give this to you. You didn't get it by a preacher. You didn't get it by your parents. You didn't get it by education. You didn't get it by theology. You got it from God himself because your father gives you revelation. And when it &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When revelation strikes that word, &gt;&gt; it'll quicken it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It'll absolutely quicken it until it brings forth life. And I'll tell you, if you who say that you're a son or daughter of God, &gt;&gt; you can study your Bible, that's good. &gt;&gt; You can learn all these things. That's good. &gt;&gt; But when the heavenly father &gt;&gt; quickens, &gt;&gt; what you have heard &gt;&gt; and it goes beyond your human intellect and all of a sudden &gt;&gt; God gives you revelation. What is it? God giving you the very mind of himself &gt;&gt; and then it has the power to transform you &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; not just memorizing Bible verses that's good &gt;&gt; but if it doesn't change your life &gt;&gt; if there is no changing of you change your church &gt;&gt; because there must be something inside of you that is getting a transformation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those things which I once loved now I hate. And those things I once hated now I love &gt;&gt; it ain't giving up something. It's getting something. &gt;&gt; It's getting revelation. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that power &gt;&gt; when it strikes that seed &gt;&gt; and and and gives to you revelation, &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that is the most powerful &gt;&gt; thing you could ask God for. &gt;&gt; Give me &gt;&gt; revelation. &gt;&gt; I've heard all these things. I've heard stories. I read my Bible. I've memorized. You let a young girl hear about holiness dress. It's just legalism. &gt;&gt; Until &gt;&gt; it's revealed. &gt;&gt; It's not conforming. &gt;&gt; Conform means to mold under pressure, but being transformed &gt;&gt; by the renewing of your mind. If you young girls and you don't have a revelation of it, I tell you, get alone with him &gt;&gt; and ask him, get on your knees &gt;&gt; and ask God, God, what about holiness? &gt;&gt; Because if you look like the world and you act like the world and you talk like the world, the love of God is not even in you. &gt;&gt; God has called you to look different, act different, talk different. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are different. You're from another kingdom. [Applause] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. You're of another seed. &gt;&gt; This is the age where they call evil good and good evil. &gt;&gt; You are ought to be thankful that you are citizens of another kingdom. Yes. &gt;&gt; Kingdom where there is no sin. There is no death. &gt;&gt; There is no murder, rape, or taxes. &gt;&gt; A kingdom where there's no sickness and suffering from diseases. &gt;&gt; I seek a kingdom whose builder &gt;&gt; and maker is God. &gt;&gt; In every age, you will have the overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is going to be she may be a minority. &gt;&gt; But a minority with God is a majority. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. A minority with God is a majority. &gt;&gt; Because you've got all heaven &gt;&gt; behind you. We are encompassed &gt;&gt; by such a cloud of witnesses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, there is far more in this building right now than what we can see. &gt;&gt; There are angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are theophony beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things that are hovering &gt;&gt; right around. And if we could close our eyes and we could say, "God, let me see into that eternal realm right now. &gt;&gt; Angels are here walking up and down the aisles waiting to give you something. But you got to ask." &gt;&gt; Ah, quit clowning around. Quit playing with God. You want to have something with God, get serious and ask him. He's God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The unveiling of God did not stop with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because Christ &gt;&gt; is the mystery &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know if you went back into your Bible and you go to Genesis 1 and it says, "In the beginning, God." Then it goes in the next few verses and God said, "And God said and God said and God said and you keep reading down. And I've showed you in your Bibles. And then you come to the point where after he creates man, it never says and God said, &gt;&gt; it says the Lord God, &gt;&gt; Jehovah Elohim, &gt;&gt; God has now given a portion of himself &gt;&gt; and he's united it with man. So whenever he now speaks to man after he created him, it's not just God, &gt;&gt; right? But a God who reveals, &gt;&gt; a God who speaks, &gt;&gt; now the Lord God, &gt;&gt; and the Lord God said, and the Lord God, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to understand that this unveiling of God has continued. It started before there was stardust. &gt;&gt; It started before there was time. &gt;&gt; And it's started to unfold. came down through Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who was the beginning of the creation of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; He was the firstborn. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Because in him &gt;&gt; was every elect seed. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? In him, &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, God with us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the mystery continues. &gt;&gt; There's yet another mystery that is now being unfolded right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when we see Adam became the mystery of God revealed to the earth &gt;&gt; because God is now revealing to the world his son &gt;&gt; Adam. And yet because God dwelt alone and he wanted a family, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Adam when he was here, he dwelt alone. Why? He was in the image &gt;&gt; of God. But he says, "I'm going to put you asleep, Adam. And I'm going to take a mystery out of you." &gt;&gt; And he laid Adam to sleep. And he took the feminist part because when you God God created man, he created him male and female. That's right. &gt;&gt; But he took out of him the male. He took out of him that female portion and he put it into another body. &gt;&gt; And when she came to Adam, she was the mystery &gt;&gt; of Adam revealed. That's why she had to come to him to know who she is. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you must come to him to know who you are. &gt;&gt; This world is without identification. They go to school, they go to education, they go to professors, they do all this stuff and they don't even know if they're male or female. &gt;&gt; Come on. There's only one way for you to know who you are. &gt;&gt; You got to go to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your identity comes to you from your father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Eve was a mystery of Adam revealed, &gt;&gt; but it continues. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to know who I am? &gt;&gt; I'm him revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a mystery. It's no longer I that live &gt;&gt; but Christ &gt;&gt; that liveth in me. And the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you realize &gt;&gt; who you are? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:es 25- 29. Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the mystery which hath been hid from the ages and from generations. &gt;&gt; But now. &gt;&gt; But now. Somebody say now. &gt;&gt; Say it again. Now. &gt;&gt; My mother when she used to get want to get our attention. You boys come. Yes, mom. In just a minute. I said now. And you knew when she said now that that don't mean in 10 minutes. Come on. &gt;&gt; It means get your hide in movement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now it's made manifest to his saints. &gt;&gt; It's happening. &gt;&gt; It's happening. &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery &gt;&gt; among the Gentiles. which is &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; This mystery which has been hid from ages. &gt;&gt; But now is made manifest. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. What does Christ mean? Anointed. Amen. &gt;&gt; If that same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead &gt;&gt; be in you, &gt;&gt; he will quicken &gt;&gt; these mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; Not to make you a church member, not to make you a religious person. God don't want religion. He wants a relationship. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want a fig leaf covering of religion. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want rules and regulations. He wants a relationship. I want to reveal myself to you. And if you'll led me, this very mind that was in God will be in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Transferral of thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what revelation is. &gt;&gt; God giving you his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good &gt;&gt; revelation is God giving you &gt;&gt; his thought. &gt;&gt; I cannot overemphasize. &gt;&gt; It'll quicken. I remember the first time when Revelation struck me and I was listening to a tape and I heard that prophet's voice. There was something that struck me inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. long-haired, dope smoking hippie surfer. &gt;&gt; And yet inside &gt;&gt; like the woman at the well, &gt;&gt; there was seed. &gt;&gt; When I heard that voice, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, it was not the voice of the prophet. &gt;&gt; I heard a voice. &gt;&gt; I heard my father's voice. I heard the voice that spoke my name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before there was stardust. &gt;&gt; Before the world began, he spake my name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every one of you have a name, but that only identifies you here on this earth. &gt;&gt; But you've got another name. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Part of the great mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says that hidden inside that rock, &gt;&gt; that rock of revelation, he said he'll be given a new name. And brother Brennham says it'll perhaps be that name that you had that doesn't identify this. &gt;&gt; He says you might know this, but he said you don't really know me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is this okay? &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been thinking and reading about this age we're living in and studying. And we must be aware of the characteristics of this age &gt;&gt; because it's going to have an effect. It &gt;&gt; sure is. The world right now is getting into a survival mode. My son Amos sent me here a while back a a little video clip of these dooms doomsday preppers underground bunkers taking water putting them in shelters and food and stored up stuff because something's happening. &gt;&gt; Listen, the world knows it. They know it. They're scared to death. &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; This world is falling apart. America is coming apart at the seams. &gt;&gt; You can't get the left and the right to agree with one another. Our government is shutting down. &gt;&gt; Everything is shutting down. Our economy is shutting down. Everything is is in chaos. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's another kingdom. It's coming. &gt;&gt; And this one's got to fall apart. Another one is coming. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the king is coming. &gt;&gt; And his kingdom he brings with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let this world fall apart. I don't put my trust in money. I don't put my trust in Trump. I don't put my trust in the government. I don't put my trust in anything except for the word of God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But my word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; The bride is not preparing to survive the tribulation. She's preparing herself to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Enoch prepared &gt;&gt; to be caught up. &gt;&gt; Noah prepared an ark &gt;&gt; to go through. There's something about when you know you're going to go on a trip, you got to get prepared. &gt;&gt; My wife, I tell you, she starts preparing a week or two ahead of time. She's just get the get the suitcase out this and that and honey, did you get this and that and drives me nuts because I kind of just throw it in there last second. Not not her. She organizes. She thinks. So is the bride doing the same thing. I'm doing everything I can right now to think I'm not trying to find out how I can survive laia. I want to get out of LA. &gt;&gt; I'm not one to just undergo all of these situations. I want to overcome. I want to overcome the spirit that's in this age. I want to overcome all the things that are trying to take me down. Why? That's my destiny. I claim it. It's mine. Greater is he that's in you &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Listen, the diagnosis of Laiusa came from God himself. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the messenger. &gt;&gt; God himself. He says, "Thou sayest, you're rich and increase with goods, and have need of nothing, but knowest not that thou are poor, miserable, blind, wretched, and naked, and you don't even know it." &gt;&gt; What a horrible condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I took the wife the other day. We were shopping. She had to go to HomeGoods or somewhere. And I said, I I'm going to just sit out front. I sat out on the front with my little dog on a bench. &gt;&gt; And I just watched the people coming and going in and out. I didn't see one woman in a dress. &gt;&gt; Not one. Except for my wife. rest of them, whether they were skinny or fat, with a nice body or with a body. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I tell you, &gt;&gt; it was bad. I thought, "Oh my goodness, if I look like that, &gt;&gt; I'd hide." &gt;&gt; But I don't try to make a joke out of it. &gt;&gt; What What would make What would make the people do this? &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; That's why. &gt;&gt; What would make you sisters dress the way you do? &gt;&gt; A spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because without holiness, &gt;&gt; no man shall see God. &gt;&gt; You sisters, I tell you, let me salute you right now &gt;&gt; because I say, Yeah. Yeah. Come on, give them a hand. I told my wife, I said, "Sweetheart, you're the only woman I saw that wore a a dress coming in and out." And she said, "I'm I'm just used to it. I don't even think about it." &gt;&gt; And I said, "I am so proud of you." &gt;&gt; And I may may I take my hat off to you sisters? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we we we men, we can kind of fit in. You wear, &gt;&gt; you know, you wear a pair of pants and you're not wearing shorts and everything. You can kind of fit in. You could we don't have to uh you know our hair we you know if you were a Jew if you were a Jew a boy and you had the the ringlets huh &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you hide the ringlets man but you sisters you can't hide &gt;&gt; I I I watch some of you girls you you go out here and you play sports and you wear dress. I thought, "Oh, God, &gt;&gt; you wear a dress when everybody else is wearing their little spandex shorties." &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, God, bless our girls." &gt;&gt; Our young women. &gt;&gt; I do. I say, "God bless them." You sisters, the way you dress when you go to when you go to out here in your you're shopping and and you're going anywhere. Do you realize, brother Brandham said that that one woman, he says there in the midst of all these kids and the rebels and all of the this and that, he said that one old lady that was dressed nice, he says God allowed her to bring judgment. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that what you're doing? You're showing to those to the world &gt;&gt; what a woman should look at. You should you should be proud &gt;&gt; you should say I'm doing this for him. This is not me &gt;&gt; and the works that I do. I'm not doing it because I want to, you know, no, I'm doing it because I love him. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you love me, you keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; Works are a visible manifestation of what you believe. This is the age wherein Satan has had 6,000 years since Adam to perfect sin. This is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, just look around. &gt;&gt; And if we cannot be differentiated from those out there, &gt;&gt; there is no revelation in your life &gt;&gt; because your revelation will make a manifestation. You show me a person that says they have faith and I'll see their see their faith by the works. &gt;&gt; You understand it? &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians 4:es 3-6. But if our gospel be hid, &gt;&gt; it's hid to them that are lost. and whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of this glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God should shine unto them. God is light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the light that I give to man is the light of life. There's something about light that is lifegiving. Hallelujah. God is light. &gt;&gt; And we are children of light. &gt;&gt; I remember the first sermon that I preached. They asked me to preach in Flex Tabernacle years ago. Young boy. And I did not remember the name of my sermon, but Sister Mary Dalton She said, "Brother Ron, I still have the notes of your first sermon." &gt;&gt; She said, "Do you remember what you preached?" I said, "No, I don't." She said, "The children of light." &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; children of light. You realize that God is light. &gt;&gt; And that they Einstein and all of these great scientific minds said, "If we could reach to the speed of light, time stops. If we could go to light speed, we could come to a threshold where time there is no more time. It just enters into an eternal realm. And then if I could go faster &gt;&gt; than the speed of light, &gt;&gt; I could reverse time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I go back to the future. Because what we see here now is the after effect. But if we could enter into light speed, I'll take you back to where you were. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The mind of God. &gt;&gt; I'll take you back before there was a fall. I'll take you back &gt;&gt; into my very mind where I conceived you. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. I just seem to be a little overcome right now. &gt;&gt; Says, "The God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not." Why do you believe what you believe? Why do you believe this Bible? &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, I don't really know why I do. I just do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I believe &gt;&gt; when I heard it, the first time I ever heard about Jesus, I wasn't I wasn't raised in church. My parents were not religious people. Jesus Christ was a cuss word. Never never one time did we go to church. Never did we ever have family devotions. Did we ever pray together. In fact, when I came to Christ and I gave my life to God, my father begged me, don't don't serve God. Don't serve Jesus. That's for weaklings. That's for people who Son, if you're going to make something out of yourself, you're going to have to make it. You yourself. Why though? Look at those people. They're weaklings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think I'm a weakling? Carry this with you to school. &gt;&gt; Carry it to your work. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I had my Bible stolen in high school at school at lunchtime. I had it there. I had all my notes in it. You know how you do? You might write all your notes and everything like they stole my Bible. I got so upset. I says, "Can you imagine? They stole my Bible. And I thought, why don't I pray for them &gt;&gt; that they'll read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had on the I I had on the front page here, read the Bible. It'll scare the hell out of you. I thought I hope they read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't get my Bible back. &gt;&gt; But I asked God, God, whoever took it. &gt;&gt; If they meant it for maliciousness, forgive them. But I pray that they read it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, the Bible is not for you to sit on the coffee table or up on the shelf somewhere and to say, "I've got a Bible." No. The Bible's to be read. &gt;&gt; The Bible is for you to read. It is a compass. It is a light. &gt;&gt; It is a way that'll show you your destiny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every other book, do you realize that this is the bestseller every year? &gt;&gt; The Bible. &gt;&gt; I just love to speak the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. I'm sorry. I'm overcome. &gt;&gt; I fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first time I heard the story of Jesus, I said, "Who am I?" I was told the story that he bled and died. He gave his life for me. I said, "Who am I that a king &gt;&gt; would bleed and die for? &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; I don't understand this. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but shall have everlasting life. Who am I? It wasn't until I came to the revelation in this hour I knew my identity. &gt;&gt; I knew where I come from. I knew my origin. And like on a Coke bottle, I got a revelation off a Coke bottle one time. No deposit, no return. &gt;&gt; Unless you have something deposited inside of you. Listen, Jesus said, "All that the Father hath given me &gt;&gt; will come." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can fight all you want. &gt;&gt; You can resist all you want, but you're coming. You're coming. Whether you come screaming and hollering and dragging your heels or something, you're coming. &gt;&gt; And you don't think that, hey, listen, God is the greatest fisherman. And once he's got you hooked, you're hooked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You're coming. You don't Whoa, man. I'm Yeah, I ain't coming. I ain't coming. Yeah, you're coming. I don't want to go to church three times a week. I don't like Bible study. &gt;&gt; I want movies, music. You're coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fight all you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fight all you want. A good fisherman. He loves a good fight. &gt;&gt; John Dubsky. He said, "Hey, if you haven't ever gone fishing with John Dubsky, go fishing with him one time." This guy gets so excited. He He Hey, brother Ron. Brother Ron. Watch this. He said, "Right over there." Yeah. Come on, baby. Come on. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No. No. Okay. Now I got to get out the good stuff, you know. He starts changing all these lures. Yeah. Watch. There's one. Yeah. I know he's down there. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. All Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got him. I You're coming home, baby. You're And that real like that. John, he just goes and getting so excited. You're coming, man. You're coming. Yeah. Oh, Ron, look at this. Look at the fight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. when you got hooked. &gt;&gt; You got hooked &gt;&gt; and you're coming &gt;&gt; until you know. What is it? What is it? What does he do when the line keeps going just set the set the drag? [Music] your last little until &gt;&gt; till your eyeballs pop out &gt;&gt; because God will not lose one of you. There's something happening in the world today &gt;&gt; and everybody's realizing they're feeling it because there's coming a change. &gt;&gt; There's coming a change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isaiah chapter 60 verses 1-3. Musicians, if you come, I never really got into my sermon this morning. has come &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; And behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people. But the Lord shall arise upon thee, &gt;&gt; and his glory &gt;&gt; shall be seen, &gt;&gt; upon thee. &gt;&gt; And the Gentiles shall come to the light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the greatest conflict that has ever happened. What is it? Light versus darkness. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; are in the greatest conflict right now. And you're right in the very midst of the heat of the battle. But while there was in that first Exodus, there was darkness and death in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yet there was light in Goan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize that? &gt;&gt; There was light in Goan. and what separated them and the others that tried to get over to them and they couldn't because the pillar of fire separated. &gt;&gt; You realize that God is with you. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world." &gt;&gt; We just was over in Thailand. &gt;&gt; These are new Christians. These are people just come out of Buddhism. They've just heard the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; People have gone over there. Brother Ron, your son's gone over there and shared with these people and told them about an end time message. They don't understand it all. They're just new sincere babes in Christ. You don't try to give them a big piece of meat right now. Just let them just talk about the love of God &gt;&gt; and what God has done in this age. As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be. As it was in the days of Sod, so shall it be. And you begin to just talk to him. One thing about it, man, though, you know, I love to meet new Christians that just are excited about talking about him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's the greatest thing I can talk about. I could care less who plays the Super Bowl. &gt;&gt; I could care less about all of the sports and things. And &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. Amen. But the darker it gets, &gt;&gt; the greater the light shines. &gt;&gt; You may not think that your light is very bright, but just let the darkness come. Sometime you'll see how great &gt;&gt; is your light. &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate all of you. Thank you for coming. Our visitors and different ones. Amos, you got your friend here, a buddy came. You You witnessed to him. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sir. It's good to have you here today. Want you to come back. We're We're different. &gt;&gt; We're unique. The Bible calls you peculiar people. &gt;&gt; We're dangerous. &gt;&gt; His lives change. &gt;&gt; Worlds get turned upside down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Arise, shine, for the light is shine, for the light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen. And the glory of the Lord is come. And the glory of the Lord has risen upon me. I shine. Shine for the light is shine. For the high is come and the glory of the Lord is risen. And the glory of the Lord is come. And the glory of the Lord is risen upon me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a a blessing it is to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; I do not I do not feel that being a Christian is grievious or burdensome. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come unto me all ye that are weary and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Peace I will give you, not as the world gives." &gt;&gt; He says, "Come learn of me, for I am meek and lowly." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take my yoke upon you. &gt;&gt; For my yoke is easy. and my burden is light. Brother Dave Maple, would you come here, my brother? Come here. Come on up here. &gt;&gt; Would you dismiss us in a word of prayer? I'm happy to see you, Brother David. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. I've been seeking the Lord for answers, direction in my life and you are a blessing to me. I come here one time and I said, "If God be with us, where are the miracles?" And you see many people healed receiving a blessing from God, but that's not the greatest miracle. That's good. &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is sitting beside you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When God reaches down his hand and touches the hearts of your family &gt;&gt; and your friends and opens up their eyes. &gt;&gt; There's the miracles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My friends, God &gt;&gt; has richly, richly blessed you. Yes, he has. &gt;&gt; And I want to thank him today. &gt;&gt; And I thank brother Roy for asking me to come up here because I've been seeking more light from God. &gt;&gt; And today we've heard some wonderful things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The light has come and has shined upon you. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Heavenly Father, what a blessing it is for all of us to be here &gt;&gt; to hear your word and to know you are our God, our father, and we are your children. Lord, we thank you for this service. And may your blessing be upon each and every individual that's in this gathering today. In Jesus Christ's name I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother David. Amen. Listen, we started this this service with I speak the name of Jesus and that brought us such a presence. Did you feel that &gt;&gt; when we sang it? I'd like to close this service with singing it. And I'll tell you, let me just give you a clue. Do you remember was I was in the hospital. I was I had a near-death experience. I heard this song &gt;&gt; being sung outside my uh room that I was in in the hospital. I heard it. I heard him singing. There is power in the name &gt;&gt; of Jesus. And I took my cell phone. I got up. I I asked my nurse, "Are they letting people sing out in the parking lot?" Why? I've never heard such singing. So I went to the parking lot. I I or excuse me to the window out on the parking lot. I looked outside, took my cell phone. I could hear it. I could hear it so plainly that I turned my cell phone on to record and I took four different movies, whatever you call it, you know, when you video. I told Sandy, I said, "Sandy, I recorded it. I heard the voice, but it wasn't it wasn't with the physical ear." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so this song is very, very special to me.
