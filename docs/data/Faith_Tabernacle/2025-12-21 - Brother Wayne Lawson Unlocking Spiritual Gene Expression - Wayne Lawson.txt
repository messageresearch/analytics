What a what a wonderful time to [music] be in Virginia. Have nice warm weather. Amen. Felt so good today. And and uh the sun is shining. And amen. We certainly want to thank each of you that would come out tonight and spend [music] your Saturday evening with us as we Amen. as we move along across this word and and [music] pray that it would be a real blessing to you tonight. And amen. As always, a great honor to be here with Faith Tabernacle with [music] Sean and certainly appreciate him the invitation to be here and and for each of you that's drove and came and and set aside your time. I just pray the Holy Spirit would would [music] speak to you in a special way. Amen. And Amen. It'd be wonderful. Amen. It's good to see you all tonight. And Amen. We've [music] got some things upon our heart and I just pray the Lord would just move upon it. Amen. Let's [music] just bow our hearts together tonight and and let's just look to him for it. Father, we certainly thank you tonight, Lord, trusting, believing, Lord, as we put our hands in yours, knowing, Lord, that above all things, we [music] worship you. We serve you. We love you, Lord. And we ask that, Lord, that these meetings would just bring glory to you and to your name, Lord. Father, I pray [music] that you would bless your children tonight. I pray that you would take your word of faith, Lord, and that you would place it in them, Lord. That you would use [music] the words, Lord, to be able to inspire and strengthen this group, Lord, the believers that have gathered here tonight, Lord. Now, [music] Father, we ask you and invite you that you would just begin to take the services, Lord. if there's something that is a great need among us tonight. Lord, [music] we invite the supernatural, God, that you could take a hold of these things [music] and use them for your glory. And Lord, we ask you now, come take control of the service. Father, we pray in [music] the name of Jesus. Amen and amen. And God bless you tonight. And [music] Amen. I just want to enter back into the word if it's possible. Amen. It's uh like I said, a very wonderful to be here with you. Amen. Let's turn into the book of Hebrews. We're going to go back into the seventh chapter of the book of Hebrews. And I'm going to just read it again. Uh Hebrews chapter 7. Amen. It's a um it's a a tremendous time, amen, to be serving the Lord and and to be in the age that we're in. I I think of a prophet saying that we would rather be in this age as any other time. And I don't think that he was ignorant of the other ages. I just think he had a revelation and reality of what really was happening in this age. Amen. And comparable to the other ages, it's a very powerful time. Amen. Amen. Um I want to read here from Hebrews chapter 7. We're going to read four verses. Now for this Mazdc is the king of Salem, the priest of the most high God whom Abraham met returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all by being interpretation the king of righteousness and after that also the king of Salem which is the king of peace. He had without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of God abideth a priest consent continually. Now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of his spools. May God bless his word tonight as you could be seated. And I I want to talk to you a little bit tonight about the things that uh that's upon my heart. And Amen. I I've just been uh in a in a bit of study upon these things. And I know I know we're right at home tonight here with brother Sean and the church and all of you uh just message believers. I I I I've never pretend to be anything different than a message preacher. That's just who I am. And that's what I believe. And Amen. And uh I I just I'm just not ashamed of the message. I'm not ashamed of the commission. I'm not ashamed of the prophet. I'm not ashamed of what he taught. Amen. But rather, I'm very happy to be identified with such a a message and such a grace that we would be able to be identified with that. And I certainly thank the Lord for that. Amen. Tonight. And Amen. As we're as we're entering into these things, I'd like to talk to you a little bit about uh uh I'm just going to take this for a title maybe to get you an idea where I'm going with this, but uh I want to talk to you about unlocking uh the spiritual gene expressions. Unlocking spiritual gene expressions. And and and when I I I talk about that, I I recognize here that of course we're dealing with Melazdc and and and last night we we spoke about him a little bit. Amen. But of course, amen, if you're if you're talking about Melkazdc, this is the age uh when you can. Now, Paul said it in Hebrews 5 that he said that he would like to talk about it back then. He said, "But they're a bit dull of hearing and it wasn't the time uh for this to come out." But then, Brother Bam, he he he comes forth and really uh uh dives into scripture and brings out who Melazdc is. And he does it for the believer. Amen. that we might be able to understand who this is. And somebody said, "Well, who is he?" Brother Wayne said, "Well, the prophet said, watch, the scripture said he's without beginning of days or ending of life." So, he's an eternal person. &gt;&gt; The scripture says he was also a man. So, whoever this man was, Amen. It was God who created a human body and stepped into it and spoke to Abraham. And it was like to the son of God because it was a created body, not the begotten body of the son of God through a virgin birth. Amen. But it was God in theophonic form speaking to his servant Abraham. Amen. To Amen. to bless him. Amen. And to bring communion unto him. And I I think it's so powerful because it's the effect of that revelation is what uh as what made Abraham, brother Abraham said when he saw uh three come to the tent door, he could look at all three and he could say my Lord. He said and oh Lot down in Sodom, he said when he seen him come down there, he said he's seen two and he said, "My Lords." He said, "Then watch the effect of that revelation." And Abraham knew just that one God and and was able to witness him when he began to speak to him. And Amen. when he come to that tent door. And now, Brother Bam told us, he said, "Then see the very same one that come to that tent door to Abraham, he said, now let me turn my back to you." He said, "So you can see that the same angel that was there at the tent door is the same angel that is here tonight." Amen. And I I would like to uh say, Amen. I don't believe that that's just a history lesson in the church. But I believe that same angel is still with the message of the hour just like he was in the days of the prophet. Amen. Amen. He's still just as alive tonight because we wouldn't call him Melazdc tonight. We would call him Jesus Christ because Melazdc became Jesus. And Jesus is not dead but yet he is alive. Now, now, Brother Brandham is very uh uh clear and I love how he does it because he uses this revelation of Melazdc. Amen. To expose you, the the seed of Abraham to the same revelation Abraham had. And that revelation is of that eternal person of that God. No matter if he appeared in a pillar of fire or if he was in a burning bush or if he was standing in the cloth, amen, of Melchazdc or whether it was that one he called Lord God Almighty. Whoever it was, he showed you it was the same person just changing mask. And he said that God never changed his attitude. He never lost ability. He was the same God all the time. He was just changing mask. And brother Bam takes that revelation then to explain to you his ministry and what was happening in the in his generation. Now, in the proving of his word, Brother Bam tells us a powerful thing when he says, "See, now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham back there that could discern the thoughts that was in Sarah's mind." He said, "That was not Jesus. He had not yet been born." But it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim. And he said, "That great almighty." See, as it was in the days of Sodom, watch now. In the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man. when the son of man is being revealed. Now, watch what he's doing. He's taking Luke 17:30 and Genesis the 18th chapter and telling you the same thing that happened in Genesis 18 is exactly what Luke 17:30 is about. Amen. It's in the days of the Sodom, so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is revealed. Now, not as a churchy, but the bride is called in the day when the son of man is revealed to join the church. Amen. To the head. Now, we only have one head, and that head is our Lord Jesus Christ. And and the church is to be joined to the head, our Lord Jesus, which is the word. He says, "For the marriage of the bride." See, the bridegroom call will come right down through this. So, brother Ram is telling you now the ministry in Genesis 18 is the ministry that the son of man will have in the last day. And when he begins to speak, it'll be the age where the bride is going to be brought to the headship. In other words, this this ministry is going to bind together Jesus and his bride. That it's going to it's going to cause a union to transpire between the two. And brother Bam says, "Then the church has to be the word because he's the word and the two unites together." How many realizes that's what the marriage of the lamb is about? It's about you being the hearer of the word and him being the word. And when them two come together, it's called a spiritual union. Amen. That God invisibly has come into union of the bride. Amen. And it's by the message of the hour is how that union's going to take place. In other words, you can't be the bride without the message of the hour because that is the purpose of the message is to join together the bride and Christ. Amen. Now, it'll take a manifestation and a revealing of the son of man. That's why not a clergyman can do this or just any preacher. Amen. See, it's Jesus Christ. And he'll come down in human flesh among us and we'll make his word so real. Amen. That it will unite the church and him as one. Now, the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper. Now, if you're a if you're a study of the message, this is one of them that you can put on your on your uh refrigerator and you can read it daily. He said, "The wedding supper, see not to the marriage." See, I'll go home to the wedding supper. But she's already united. See? Amen. We're not going to the marriage. We're going to the wedding supper. The marriage takes place here under the message of the hour. See, then you're already a married woman. Amen. Isn't it beautiful tonight to think about the rapture is the marriage supper. Amen. Then brother man said, see then the only the Holy Ghost fililled bride is going to go in that rapture. Amen. So tonight, if you're that Holy Ghost filled bride, Amen. you're going, THERE'S NO WAY to miss the rapture because you've already become the bride before the rapture ever takes place. I'm so glad to know that there's already been a union that has transpired in the age we're living in. That's what is so powerful in the sermon of Christ, the mystery of God revealed when brother Brandham says, "They are now one unit." Amen. It's not two different things. A prophet is now looking at the bride and he's saying the bride and Christ are the same thing. This is not two DIFFERENT THINGS. SEE, CHRIST AND THE BRIDE ARE NOT SEPARATE. It is now she has become, amen, the word in the age she's living in because she is the bride of Christ. Now, I think it's very powerful when you begin to see brother Brandham says then watch. He says when that son of man manifested itself, he said then the two become one. And when it does that, what's going to happen? It'll manifest the son of man again. &gt;&gt; It'll manifest the son of man again. Now, many people think that after brother Brandham left the scene, then this then we go right back to the son of god age. Amen. And it's no longer a prophetic age. It's no longer a prophetic time. We have moved out of the son of man dispensation. But that's not true, folks. Amen. This message joins you with the headship of Christ. And brother Bam said, "I now challenge you to believe that the Son of Man will be manifested in the bride's body." Well, you talk about a challenge tonight to believe that the Son of Man is manifested in the bride's body, but it's done by THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU'RE NOT THE PROPHET. You're the product OF THE PROPHECY. AND NOW THE vindication of his word HAS COME RIGHT IN TO the church of the LIVING GOD. OH MY GOODNESS. AMEN. We can look at this tonight and we can look back 50, 60, 70 years and we could talk about the PROPHET AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW God done things with the prophet OF THE HOUR. AMEN. BUT LISTEN, I think it's time to move the revelation. Amen. To move it up from what God DID IN THE PROPHET UNTIL WHAT GOD IS DOING IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WE'RE NOT HERE JUST FOR A HISTORY LESSON. WE are here to manifest what has been brought into this age and has been proven to be thus saith the Lord. This bride is not feeding on just anything. She's feeding on the mind of Christ. That's what she's receiving is the mind of Christ. It's not what has happened, it's what is happening. She will manifest the son of man again. Isn't that beautiful? That's why he said in John 12. Amen. Jesus said, he says, "I will glorify thy name." The father spit, "I'll glorify thy name." And they said, "Well, that's the thunders." And Jesus said, "No, that's the voice of God." And he said, "I manifest thy name. I'll glorify thy name, but I will glorify thy name again." &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Now, watch that because that again part is what really what really brings forth the bride of Christ. Now, of course, brother Bham in the future home. Amen. He says it here. He says, "Amen." He said, "Now, there's a difference between the intellectual faith, Amen, and the revelation." &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bam used the Pharisee and the woman at the well to tell the difference. And and what he said was he said, "Of course, the Pharisee had learned it from the Bible. He had learned God was God. He had learned holiness was right. He had learned there was a law of God. He had learned an intellectual conception. And he was born in the right lineage. He was a Levite, but he only knowed it by intellectual conception. Amen. But see, Amen. He had learned it from what had happened. &gt;&gt; And that's a lot of good theologians, a lot of people reading the Bible, they learned it of what had happened. And they can they can tell you a lot about what had happened. Amen. But it'll take a spiritual revelation to tell you what is happening. IT'LL REQUIRE THE ability to hear from God. It'll take the spirit of God to bring revelation to make the thing clear up in your mind to bring clear understanding of what is happening today. I I love how brother Brandham said that little woman at the well, she had an attribute in her that was a represented in heaven. So when she saw the manifestation of the son of man, Amen. she knew what was happening. It was something happening, folks. She dropped her water bucket and run into the city to let them know what was happening because she had the ability to receive revelation. And I thank God tonight that there's something on the inside of us, amen, that we're not just reading the message, amen, of something that happened back in 1960s, but there's something about the message that is stirring up a revival THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CHURCH TONIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF THE believer that has been awakened by THIS MESSAGE TO LET US KNOW WHAT I'M DOING TONIGHT COMES FROM WHAT GOD HAS done in the age that I'm living in. My goodness, when you see what's going on in the day that you're living in now, now uh uh there a couple direct statements here I think is a is a real blessing. Amen. And and maybe just to uh make a definitive statement upon it. Amen. You said, "Brother Wayne, what's happening?" Well, let me read you what Brother Bam says. It's a spiritual union of Christ and his church. &gt;&gt; When the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh, that's what's happening. The positive is moving into the negative and the negative is moving into the positive. Amen. That's what's happening. You're you're reading the messages. You're hearing your pastors preach and the spirit of God is taking the word and bringing it into your life. And you are starting to become the very word that you are hearing. Amen. I I love how brother Bam says the word is becoming flesh now. That's what is going on. Amen. You You have began to nurse from the promises of God a change into your life. Amen. Amen. When you think about it, Amen. Somebody said, "Well, Brother Wayne, then then what are we dealing with?" See, but it's time for Elohim to come into bride form. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it time for God to come back into human flesh? Brother Bam said, "The word is sharper than a two-ed sword, a discerner, and see, he's here to appear on the scene to make Jesus the same yesterday, today, and forever." It's a promised word that's been allotted for this day. Now, we are living in this day, and God is here with us to manifest it and make it true. See, it'll take the Holy Spirit in you. It'll take the message that's been sent to you to take the two and to make it true in the day that we're living in. Now, this is the day brother says it now. He says, "When the son of man is being revealed, Elohim will return back to the royal seed of Abraham and show them the same thing he showed him in that day." Has he done it? Then Elohim as it was, it will be a characteristic of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Ram says, "Now watch this. Jesus said, at that day ye shall see me." See, the world seeth me no more, but ye shall SEE ME BECAUSE OF THE revelation of Mechazedc when it's COMING FORTH IN THIS AGE. You'll see that revelation, BUT NOT JUST SEE IT, you will allow IT INTO THE HEARTS THAT IT WILL BEGIN TO change you and change your lives. The characteristics of God. Now, now, now, Brother Bama, he sums it all up by saying the whole picture. He says from Genesis to Revelation, there's nothing wrong. This is Elohim materializing so he can be touched. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is Elohim materializing so he could be touched. Now y'all don't y'all don't maybe sometimes think about it like this but when that word is coming into your life this is Elohim in coming into you through the word and the spirit that's in you is starting to manifest Elohim the invisible God is becoming visible and you are becoming the visible presence of almighty God MY GOODNESS THAT'S WHY IN CHRIST the mystery brother Ram said what was hid in the mind of God is now in the flesh of the bride of Jesus Christ. You want to know what God had on his mind? Amen. I say this, you turn, look around the room right now and you can see what God had on his mind. Might not impress you. Amen. But it impresses GOD BECAUSE GOD IS SATISFIED. AMEN. It's his bride. It's his word. And there's been a union in this age. Amen. And I thank God that when he looks upon it, he is satisfied with what his work has done in this age. You say, "Brother, brother Wayne, now there there's I'm just making direct statements. This whole thing is God becoming tangible." &gt;&gt; Elohim materializing. God becoming tangible. What is it? It's God, the eternal one is becoming tangible in a bride. [screaming] Brother Brandon uses the word immorate. He said he's becoming immorph. What is it? It's immorphe in a bride. Amen. The word is hid not behind badger skins. It's behind bride skins. Amen. What is it? It's the eternal spirit. And his attribute displayed in his body. Amen. Moving it from a negative to a positive. Just like a dark room develops a picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had took a picture of you before the world ever began. God's got a picture of the bride tonight. Do you know God put the picture up there in his attribute? Amen. And and brother Amos, it doesn't matter what the devil does, that attribute can never be destroyed. &gt;&gt; The attribute. Now, think of that's a quote. Attribute can't be destroyed. That picture cannot be destroyed. It was not taken of you, Amen, at your worst. It was taken of YOU AT YOUR BEST. AND GOD is here by the message developing. Amen. They say the best you. I'd say this. Amen. You can't get 10 steps to the best you. And you can't buy some theologian book to get the best you. But the best you IS THE ONE GOD HAD IN HIS MIND. But the way to get the BEST YOU IS BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, [screaming] BROTHER. IT FITS LIKE A glove on the bride of Jesus Christ. It is the developing of a picture moving from the positive to the negative. Now, many times it'll take death to develop that picture. But there's a bride on the scene today that that will not be a development of death, but the spirit of God will develop the full picture while they yet live. And they step from one body to another. My goodness. Amen. That attribute of God. What is it? It's Elohim. And these are direct quote. Amen. It's Elohim back in the bride. &gt;&gt; Elohim is back. You said, "Brother Wayne, WHERE'S HE AT in the bride?" &gt;&gt; He's not just in this room. He's not just in the age. HE'S NOT JUST IN A PROPHET. ELOHIM IS back in THE BRIDE. HE'S HERE TONIGHT IN THE FORM OF THE BRIDE. LOOK, YOU AIN'T got to PRAY HIM DOWN. HE'S ALREADY HERE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO SAY, "GOD, COME DOWN TONIGHT." HE'S ALREADY HERE. HE'S HERE IN THE FORM OF A BRIDE. WHEN YOU BEGIN to surrender, Amen. GOD BEGINS TO COME OUT of the inside. It's Elohim. And he's back in a bride. That's it. Amen. Brother Brandham talks about it. It's Elohim, but this time he's back in the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; He's in the seed OF ABRAHAM. ALL that God was, somebody say, all. All that God was, he poured into Christ. Come on, folks. That's what he did. But what's he doing? AND ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST HAS been poured into this bride. Amen. I heard a guy quote that one time. He said, "Well, you got to know that, brother Bam really didn't mean all. No, all means all. And all that was in God was poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ was poured into this bride. There's not one man walking around on the earth with all OF GOD." AMEN. BUT YOU GOT THE SAME element in you that WAS IN JESUS CHRIST. IT MAY JUST BE A TEASPOON, BUT BROTHER, IT'S GOD. AND THERE'S NO WEAK SPOT IN GOD. IF GOD IS IN YOU, ALL POWER IS IN YOU. THE POWER OF CREATION IS IN YOU. LIFE IS IN YOU. TRUTH IS IN YOU. Because God, the eternal one, is on the inside of you residing. Amen. In you. &gt;&gt; That's a prophet we're talking about. I'm not reading some Baptist theologians. And I'm not just picking on Baptist, but they GOT A GOOD GUESS. THIS IS THUS SAYAITH the Lord. ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST has been poured into THIS BRIDE. AMEN. NOW WATCH THIS. If you want scripture, it's John 14. At that day you shall know that I'm the father, the father and me and I and you and you and me. Now that's a that's a complete, isn't it? That's a complete revelation. The Bible in the bride. Amen. Who is God? Brother Bram says it. Deity is here with us. He says, "Deity is in us." This is a prophet speaking. Deity is not in heaven. DEITY IS in the bride. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, I'm a Christian." Do you know what it means to be a Christian? To be a Christian means to be Christlike. &gt;&gt; You're tabernacling deity. &gt;&gt; You have become the tabernacle of deity. Amen. The the spirit of God has come into you. Now you you you look around today and we see what was happening in another age. We had see what happened in another time. But where are you standing? What what what is the standing of things as they are today? It's God our Lord Jesus in the form of bride. Amen. Now now brother Brandon will ask it. You say bride word bride. You keep talking like this. And brother Ram said, "Oh yeah, that's the manifestation of this hour." Not a creed or denomination, but a living oracle of God, an attribute of God, displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of bride. It's God, but you're viewing it in formation of bride. You're not viewing it in formation of a of a bush. It's not in formation of the man Melazdc or the man, the Lord Jesus. You're viewing God in the form of the bride. My goodness. You ought to tell that old devil, "Get on out of here, Satan." Amen. God chose me. Whether you like it or anybody else likes it, he made his election before the foundation of THE WORLD. HE CLAIMED OUR LIVES and now in morphase himself in that body. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, thank God tonight. Amen. Brother Bam says it is the displaying of the world the attributes of God in the formation of bride that's to be expressed in this hour. Now when we come to the house of God tonight I there's some things you hear Brother Bam say it's just so powerful. Amen. You come to the house of God tonight and and some people I know we're in an age it seems like you got to pick you know are are y'all are y'all a spirit or y'all word. Well uh we're both. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like people got to make you choose now. You know which side are you on? Well, we're both. Amen. We're both word and spirit. And if you get one without the other, you got out of balance. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the prophet will tell us. He says, "Now people make it a funeral possession." &gt;&gt; He said they make it a funeral possession. And he said other people make it a frolic, &gt;&gt; but it's not a funeral possession. And it's not a frolic. He said it's a feast. And that feast is with Christ. You see, the bride is receiving a feast with Melazdc. Just like Abraham was fed by Melazdc, so is the bride feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. She has received the message of the hour. Now, now if you go back in the Bible, amen, in Genesis, and you find out that when Abraham met Mekazedc, it was after the battle. It was after the battle was over and he served his servant communion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He served him communion. Now he brought forth Melazdc brought the bread and the wine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's like you're going to a to a party. They bring your own party. Bring your own steak party. Bring your own chicken party. And then there's just come on and eat party. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you have come to. You have come to a feast where the food has been provided. Amen. You don't have to bring your own wine to this one. You got both the bread and you got the wine. I tell you, it's the best bread and it's the best wine that a person can have. This is the BEST MEAL THAT YOU'RE EVER GOING TO EAT. MATTER OF FACT, WHEN YOU BEGIN to feed on this word, you will never BE THE SAME AGAIN. BECAUSE THE SAME ANGEL THAT MET ABRAHAM AND BROUGHT THE BREAD AND THE WINE IS THE SAME GOD THAT HAS BROUGHT THE BREAD AND THE WINE to this church. HE'S BROUGHT A WINE THAT'LL STIMULATE YOUR SOUL. HE'S BROUGHT A BREAD THAT'LL CHANGE YOUR BODY. THIS MESSAGE WILL AFFECT YOU EVERY TIME YOU eat it. &gt;&gt; It's the same one. Amen. He brought forth. I love that. He brought forth the bread and the wine. The same one. The same one that did it. Now, here it is. The effect of that revelation we spoke of last night. The effect of that revelation tells us who this is bringing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're you're Bible readers and we know we know the promise of our day is 1 Thessalonians 4. Brother said, "If it not for the rapture, what promise do we have?" &gt;&gt; We we don't even have a promise. this this louda this age this darkness this troubled world that we're living in what promise does the bride have amen I if it's not for the promise of rapture what would we have but God made a promise in Thessalonians that there would be a rapture of the church in 1 Thessalonians 4 the Bible says for the Lord himself amen shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead shall rise first. Now, if you're if you're uh looking at the age, Paul put this in there in the Thessalonians. Brother Brandham is the one that broke into the scripture in the message of the rapture and opened it for us. Remember, he said to the bride, "The rapture will be a revelation." &gt;&gt; He said, "She'll be waiting on it." Well, you had to wait about three or four pages. And then he broke into it and told you the revelation laying in the rapture. The revelation. Rapture. Revelation. He told you what it was. He said, "Do you see what it is?" The shout of first Thessalonians 4 is the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows that to be true? &gt;&gt; The shout is the message of William Brandom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that shout then therefore is going to be brother Brandham said the living bread. Do you see Christ himself is the one bringing the message? When we when we talk about this, we're going to have to we're going to have to break into a little something here because when you see the three-fold of First Thessalonians 4, you're dealing with the seventh seal. How many knows that's his coming? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when Brother Man preached on the seventh seal, he said there's a three-fold revelation to it, didn't he? Now, if you say, "Brother Wayne, what's the three-fold revelation of that seven seal?" You got to go to Christ, the mystery of God reveal. And Brother Brown breaks it down in three parts. He said, "There's a revealing, there's a preeminence, and there's a taken back to Eden." So, you got a revealing, you got a preeminence, and you got a taken back. Can you see it? You got a revealing of the message, the shout. You've got a preeminence of that message in the bride, which is the voice. And then once that voice fills up in the bride, there'll be a body change and a taking back to the marriage supper of the lamb. Isn't it beautiful? Watch that adoption lay right over that seven seal. There's a revealing by a tutor. There's a preeminence of his teaching and then there's a change of the body. Didn't brother Ben say the adoption, the fullness of it is the changing of the body. Amen. Then you can see that God, Amen, is bringing us into an adoption age. YOU MEAN YOU CAN SAY IT a rapture age. You can SAY IT A BRIDE AGE. AMEN. WHATEVER wording you want to pick it. AMEN. IT'S THE SEASON WHERE THE BRIDE HAS RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM GOD THAT'LL CHANGE her mortal body. My goodness. Amen. Then we we we all of a sudden now we're going to break in the seventh seal a moment. Okay. So when we start talking about the seventh seal, we know the seven seal is in three parts. We know the seventh seal was a space of a half hour. &gt;&gt; Now I don't have a lot of authority to say what that half hour is. I'll say this to you. The great revelation behind it is it's a process. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that's what we all missed, wasn't it? That it was a span of time. So when it says it was the space of a half hour, it tells you it was a span of time. Cuz when we first read, when I first always heard as a kid, Amen. I thought it was in the blink of an eye that the whole thing was going to take place. You know, Jesus would appear in the heavens and then in the blink of the eye, we'd all change and go with him. That's what I that's what I thought because that's what tradition taught. But the message of the hour is a tradition shattering message. It'll shatter every tradition that's been put upon this. Amen. So that you can see that the seven seal is a space of time. IT'S A PROCESS OF THE MESSAGE becoming life in the BELIEVERS IN THE LAST DAY. AND WE'RE LIVING IN HELL. THINGS ARE FALLING APART ALL AROUND US, BUT NOTHING'S OUT OF CONTROL. NOTHING'S OUT OF PLACE. THAT BRIDE [screaming] IS RISING UP JUST LIKE THE MESSAGE said she would be. You see, the Satan's too late, Brother Amos. We've already got the message. Satan's too late. They can ATTACK THE MESSENGER, BUT THE SEED HAS ALREADY been preached. The message HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN. CAN I SAY IT? AMEN. THE DOVE DELIVERED THE MESSAGE. YOU CAN KILL THE DOVE IF YOU WANT TO, BUT WE'VE GOT THE MESSAGE. It's already been given in this age. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you everything's falling apart. All these problems is everywhere. Amen. But you you see the message is going to go right on living because there's a bride receiving it as the message. It's a span of time. Amen. But you see the seven seal. Amen. It it's a accumulation of a lot of events. And you can look at things of what brother Brandham calls it on the events of his coming. But we call it we when you read about the king's sword, how many knows that's part of the seven seal? And when you read about the third pull, that's the seventh seal. You read about the tent vision, there's your seventh seal. The seven seal is the coming of the Lord. It's the headstone capping the pyramid. It's the fulfillment of the book of Revelations, the 10th chapter. Now, that's the one that is is so powerful to you and I. We can see the coming of the Lord in that king's sword. And we can see the coming of the Lord with that prophetic ministry. And we can see the coming of the Lord when it's a prophet with his back turned to the congregation. But we were not careful. Satan wants to miss wants us to miss THAT. IT'S A PART of the coming OF THE LORD OF you receiving the word and bringing IT TO LIFE IN THE AGE WE'RE living in. You are the living revelation of this word. &gt;&gt; A mighty angel descending into this age opens the word for the church. Now I I pray I have full liberty here. Amen. Let me let me just break into a word. Now they used to call this word by a different name and they misp mispronounced it. And I'd say many that mispronounced it also mispreached it. Uh a lot of people found the Greek word uh paraca. Amen. And and this Greek word paracia is found in 1 Thessalonians 4 when it says this in the 15th verse. And we remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleeps under the coming of the Lord. Now in the Greek when they wrote that word, the word coming meant it it was it was actually said paraca. Now a lot of people took that and they did away with the literal body of Jesus Christ. Amen. And they made it all a spiritual thing which they missed. They missed the thing because brother Bam said the true believer believes in the corporal body of Jesus Christ and a catching away of the bride to the marriage supper of the lamb. There's a real marriage supper. There's a real physical body and we're going to meet him in the air. But watch because the happening of this time is not around the physical body. This is the spiritual body of Christ bringing a message. Amen. That's coming from himself to you and I. Now, now, now if you look at this word under the coming of the Lord, the word paraca, Amen. It actually means, and this is just a word study, Greek word study has no no other thing. Amen. It's the concept of a divine visitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's divine visitation. It means a coming or an arrival. It means the face or the presence. It is actually I love this one. Amen. It's properly the arrival of the owner who alone can deal with situations. Brother, if that ain't what we needed, &gt;&gt; we needed the owner. &gt;&gt; We needed the one that owned the lamb's book. &gt;&gt; We needed the owner of all things. Amen. To show up. He alone can change the situation. It's a technical term that deals with the visit of a king. You mean like king of peace, the king of righteousness. Amen. It's some official or some royal visit. Do you know the word literally means beside? It means the personal presence. Now, now when you say that, Amen. We're living in a time we've BEEN PROMISED A VISITATION. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. And brother Bham takes this in a sermon. if you like to listen to his sermons. Is there anything too hard for the Lord? And he takes that sermon and he sets Abraham in the tent door and he says that must have been a hot morning and he says the cattle was thirsty. He said the lamb was dry. He said Sarah was complaining because she didn't have the latest fashion and she was upset over some things. And brother Bam said the conditions were as such to make him miss the oncoming visitation. Amen. But watch what he done. He was telling you that the conditions of Leardysia are designed by hell. Amen. To make you miss the blessing of the visitation of God in your age. Oh, but I tell you this, Abraham didn't miss his blessing. Abraham didn't miss the visitation. And brother, the bride has not MISSED THE VISITATION THAT GOD IS. I SAY I MEAN HELL MAY SEND EVERY DEVIL IT'S GOT BUT WE KNOW THE PRESENCE OF JESUS Christ anyhow. Whatever he sins BROTHER YOU'RE ABLE TO OVERCOME IT. WHATEVER COMES. AMEN. CHRIST HAS VISITED THIS generation anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the coming. It's the coming that of first Thessalonians 4 &gt;&gt; in the 15th verse. The coming of the Lord shall not prevent. Now, if you read it, if you read it, it would just read it's the coming of the Lord. He shall descend from heaven with a shout. The unseen one will make an arrival, an appearing, and he will give forth a message. Now, watch because that message then, now if you if you if you like to compare scriptures, I I do. Matthew the 24th chapter and the 27th verse, very familiar to you. For as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth unto the west, so also the coming of the son of man be. Now, isn't that beautiful? Because this time it doesn't say the coming of the Lord. It said the coming of the son of man. &gt;&gt; So, you recognize he's talking about that Genesis 18 experience. And he's telling you it ties to 1 Thessalonians 4. Watch what he does. Until the coming of the son of man be. Now, for wheresoever the carcass is, y'all y'all know that scripture. Wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered. &gt;&gt; Now, go back to 1 Thessalonians 4. He will descend from heaven with a shout. Amen. He will come from the east and west and bring forth a message. There's a coming and there's a gathering. In 1 Thessalonians 4, the shout is the message that gathers the bride. In Matthew 24 and 28, there is a gathering of the bride. Then you can see that God has wrote it in different places with the same revelation. But without the revelation, there's not an ability to read what has been written. Some people say, "Well, Brother Wayne, Amen, you people can't preach the message of the hour by the Bible." If you would let me use the scriptures that was given for the message of the hour. Amen. There's plenty of scripture that backs up the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; This bride, Amen, she will know her mate. It It's the revealed word of the hour. We're living in the age his coming will be in. We're living in the age his coming will be in. She will be identified. Now, if you just place that coming on his corporal body, then that coming is something way out in the future. And it will be and we're going to meet him in the air. But he's not talking about that coming. Well, it's an appearing, not a coming. BUT IF YOU FOLLOW BROTHER Brown's teachings, you see sometimes he interchanges coming and appearing without even blinking. That's right. &gt;&gt; And sometimes he's talking about the coming of the corporal body. And sometimes he's talking about the coming of the son of man. Amen. But I thank God tonight that it uses another word. He says, "Even in the day when the son of man is revealed, what good would it do for him to be here and us not know it?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what we have had in this age IS A PROPHET OF GOD TO make the presence of God known among us. Amen. We're sitting right here tonight. Amen. And there's colors coming through this room. And there's voices coming through this room. There is another dimension here. There's all kinds of things happening. And you say, "Uh, it ain't happening." But turn on a television and you can see it's happening. Turn on a radio, you can hear it's happening. And the presence of God was coming to this age to marry a bride. And it AND GOD SENT A PROPHET AMONG US TO IDENTIFY HIS PRESENCE. THAT'S WHY brother Ram said it wasn't me that created those squirrels. He just used my voice. It wasn't me. Amen. That did that down on THE RIVER. I WAS JUST THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED. YOU'RE NOT FEEDING ON ME, THE MAN. YOU'RE FEEDING ON THE WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. Oh church. Amen. God has revealed to this age. He has brought an unveiling of who it is that is speaking. It's been uncovered. It wasn't William Brandham speaking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be careful the next time you call it his opinion. &gt;&gt; Somebody told me said, "Well, Brother Wayne, that's just Brother Bam's opinion." Will I take his opinion over your thus sayaith the Lord? &gt;&gt; You say I got studied on that one time, brother Sean, because somebody was bumping me pretty. That's just his opinion. I think it was about shorts that people shouldn't wear shorts. You know, brother Bam said, "You if you do." And they were all tore up about it and that's just his opinion. So I got to studying opinion. Y'all got to forgive me. It's just me. I got to studying opinion and I thought, "Well, opinion has to have a source. You you get an opinion because you who you hang around with. You draw your opinions from your company and your fellowship. And I said, "Well, Brother Brand was hanging around with that angel. He was fellowshipping with that angel. So, his opinions were rooted in the presence of Almighty God." Let me give you one more. You know what a real opinion is? That's what they call the Supreme Court. When they judge something, they pass down an opinion. Well, it may be just an opinion, but it's coming from an absolute authority. And God has sent a MESSAGE WITH ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY ON WHAT THE MESSAGE IS IN THIS GENERATION. AND I HAVE RECEIVED OF GOD AN ABSOLUTE AMEN. AND IT'S UNLOCKED SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME. AMEN. THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY over my life. THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE OVER OUR CHURCH. THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE OVER MY FAMILY. AMEN. IT absolutely is the truth. And an absolute will produce a paradox. &gt;&gt; In an age where there is no absolutes, we got an absolute. &gt;&gt; He's here to reveal or to uncover. Amen. Now, if it was just what it was, that's one thing. But I'll tell you this, he's still here. The prophet of God said, "I am my message is to declare him he's here." Well, let me say he's still here. When the spirit of truth, when he shall come, he shall lead you and guide you into all truth. He is still here. HE IS STILL LEADING. HE'S STILL ACTING. HE'S STILL MOVING. Who do you think gets a hold of your pastor and preaches that sermon? Who is it that uses that evangelist? Who is it that moves to the church? Who is it that amens the word? &gt;&gt; Come on. WHO IS IT THAT AMENS THE WORD? THAT'S NOT YOU. THAT'S AN ATTRIBUTE OR A GENE THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU THAT RECOGNIZES THE WORD AND THE WORD IS COMING TO THE WORD AND IT'S WAKING SOMETHING up in you. &gt;&gt; He's still here. &gt;&gt; He's still in He's still in the bride, manifesting through the channel. He promised to do it. &gt;&gt; In the shout the brother said in the bride uh the rapture, Amen. He says it here. does all three things. Amen. Just before he appears, Jesus, a shout does all three things. He's descending. A shout is a shout. It's the message going forth. The living bread bringing forth the bride. Watch what he called it. The living bread. What did Melazdc bring? Bread. What was the opening them seals? Bread. &gt;&gt; What kind of bread? Living bread. &gt;&gt; Unleavened bread. &gt;&gt; Uncorrupted bread. Untouched bread. Undenominated word. You hear the Bible says it. Amen. Watch in 1 Thessalonians, he deals with it. But in 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter when he talks about our body change, he said this corruptible shall PUT ON INCORRUPTION. HOW YOU GOING TO DO THAT? What message are you going to take that don't have corruption? It'll have to be one THAT COME FROM GOD. It'll never come out of no book. You'll never bring [laughter] You'll never bring it out of no denomination or no school. It's contaminated. &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. But he brought a message from God. &gt;&gt; Oh, the purity of this message, the purity of this word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And now, now when I say that, you have to pay attention because brother Bam said he does all three. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The same God that brought the purity of this message is the same God in you accepting this message. &gt;&gt; Don't you think the voice is separate from the shout? He does all three of them. The same one that brought the message is living in the bride, receiving the message and manifesting the message. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That's what's working in you. It's the living bread &gt;&gt; bringing forth the bread and the wine. Now, in Genesis 14, you can read about it. It's the 17th verse down to the 24th. And you can read how that the king uh uh uh Melkazedc appears unto Abraham. And when he appears unto Abraham, Amen, he brings the wine and the bread. It's communion because, see, the battle's over. Amen. It It's It's already been whipped out. And And when he brings this, what's he doing? He's bringing him the bread of communion. &gt;&gt; He brought it. I I I don't have enough time to preach the real realities, but I'll just maybe touch it. You remember brother Brandham when he goes up on the mountain and he that is in you and he says he comes down out of that storm and hears that voice talk to him and he said I had a sandwich in my shirt and he said well I thought I'd just stop and eat that sandwich. You know what I'm talking about, brother Mark. You go out there in them mountains and you make that sandwich in the morning cuz you're going to be in the mountain all day if you up there walking and you can make that sandwich and you can do your best. Put in your backpack, put in your shirt. Brother Ram had it in his shirt. Can you imagine? He said it was all sogged and mashed together, you know. Amen. because he was carrying the bread with him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You you see that when you you can't car Abraham couldn't have went and fought that battle and went and did all that and come back carrying bread that would not have been affected by the battle he was in &gt;&gt; or by the situation of his life. You do you see what I'm talking about? Your family somehow would get into that. Your your ideas, your mentality, those things, the things that brother Brandon was bringing us. Amen. He didn't bring them himself. They were brought from God. &gt;&gt; When Melkazedc met Abraham, he had fresh bread. Amen. The only journey it had made was FROM ETERNITY TO TIME. AMEN. IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM DIRECTLY from the hands of God uncontaminated. &gt;&gt; That's the way I eat this message. &gt;&gt; I eat it uncontaminated. Amen. I eat it as the as the presence. Now, now if you're an Old Testament reader and you read about the Old Testament and you know about the about the uh about the tabernacle and the wilderness and you can see the levels, you know, the holies of holies, nobody could go in there but one time a year and it was the high priest and he went and anointed. Now, the presence of God was behind that badger skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they had bread in the second veil. They had bread in the outer court. Now, that bread was called shoebre. It was actually the holy place, not the holies of holies. But they had bread in there and they actually called it showbread, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or the bread of his presence &gt;&gt; or the bread of his face. This bread was what they were eating in the visible because there was a God in the invisible. So they sat there and there was some presence behind that veil and they were eating bread that had to be baked to prove there was something back there. Do you see? When they'd eat it up and break it. Amen. They would do it for the purpose there's something back there. You can't see it, but this bread is proof that the presence of God is behind that veil. Now, if you went behind the veil, back in behind that veil, there was the the ten commandments that had been written by the hand of God. And they were laid in the ark of the covenant. Remember that? And they were laid in the ark of the covenant. So, that was the word. And it was in the ark. And brother man said, "Now watch, the pillar of fire stayed over that word." But the priest would come in and he would then sprinkle the blood upon the ark of the covenant. He said, "There you go. There's your seed. gets the word. There's your light, the pillar of fire, and the sprinkling of that blood, he said, was the spirit life. &gt;&gt; So, as the as those three things hit together, it ripened something that come out of that holies of holies and it was called shoebre and they eat it. So now, Brother Bam is trying to show you that there's there's things that's been laying in the Bible that needed the presence of the pillar of fire and it needed the spirit of God to bring it out of scripture so you could eat it. &gt;&gt; You see? Amen. Until it's manifest, the bride could eat it because you know true interpretation of the words to manifest it or bring it to pass. Now, now, Brother Bam, in the unveiling of God, and I I don't want to get too deep in this. I I pray I don't get too too deep on this on you, but Amen. Brother Bam says it like this. He said, "Now watch. That shoe bread was believer's food. &gt;&gt; It was only for the believer." Now, what was it? It was shoebre that was brought forth. Now, you said bring forth. Brother B said to reveal it is to bring it forth. &gt;&gt; When you reveal the word, it brings it forth. Mechazedc brought forth the bread and the wine. Now what's he done in this age? When the son of man will reveal the scripture, he is bringing forth the bread and the wine. That is the provision of the church in the last day. What is it? It is a command for the church. Then to feed on the message the same as Abraham ate with Melazdc. When you're eating the message of the hour, you are feeding on the presence of God because that's the unseen force. But the bread you're eating is the revelation of his word. &gt;&gt; I I I just love the scripture. Now, when you get into this, you get into that seventh seal, then that's Revelations 10, right? &gt;&gt; Now, if if you're if you like Revelations 10, how many knows you're John &gt;&gt; in the book of Revelations? &gt;&gt; You're the believer. &gt;&gt; In Revelations 10, there's there's there's a couple things happening. Number one, John is seeing a mighty angel descending out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Just what happened in 1 Thessalonians 4, he's watching a mighty angel descend out of heaven. And as he's descending out of heaven, he has a book open in his hand. And John sees this. He sees a mighty angel bringing the word to a prophet. That's what he sees. Amen. It's a powerful thing because it's the seven seal. the word coming to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Look at the beauty of that. Y'all, you ever wonder who that angel was? Brother Ram said that that notable one, that notable angel up there. Somebody said, I always wondered what it was. The other day I was reading and brother Bam says he came to me. That is the seven seal. I said, "Oh my goodness." Then that was Christ bringing the word to a prophet. That's the seventh seal. That angel was none other than the covenant angel from Revelations the 10th chapter. Look what he's doing. He's bringing the word to a prophet. And John saw that. But the John that saw it was then commanded to take the book and eat that book. &gt;&gt; And it was the eating of that book. Amen. That was going to change John. Now, when he began to eat it, I I spoke shortly last night. I want to continue this just for a moment. When you eat something, it's a miracle because you don't think about it. I don't think about it. It's just a paradox. You eat it and it and it turns into life. That's all you know. But but what it does is it don't change who you are. It just makes you develop in what you already are. Now when when I I've got to do this in case uh just just for subject matter, but but you think about uh you think about the food you eat, your food does not change the individual. So in other words, let me just say uh that you have the son of of brother Sean, sister Heather. Amen. Now what's happened is that they each one gave to their son a certain instruction a certain kind of trait that come from their family. Sometimes you see the father sometimes you see the mother but but it's because that it comes from both side. Now if I say trait that speaks of what is passed from parents down to their children. &gt;&gt; I see the father in him. I see the daughter in him. &gt;&gt; All right. Now when when that is coming down into the into the person it's called a trait. But it comes from what we call a gene. Now the word gene was not really relevant until the late part of the 40s and then brother Random himself started using it in the 1960s. Now a gene is only what it is. It's just DNA but it's talking about a block of your DNA. So like if you have a a stretch of DNA, if you just took one stretch of your DNA at six foot tall, just one stretch. And that 6' tall stretch has many genes in it that determine your hair color, your size color, uh everything that you are. It has your instruction manual. But until you eat something, the instructions never come out into the life. You got to eat something before your DNA does you any good. You you you could have genetics in you the greatest the greatest champion in the world but till you begin to eat something you have no ability to use what potential is on the inside of you. Now of course amen when we say this word DNA is pretty powerful if you like to study these kind of things. Amen. That DNA actually was uh was discovered a bit in the late 1800s but it wasn't really broke into until 1953. That's significant, isn't it? 1953 gave us the invention or the discovery of DNA. It also gave us looking under the unseen demonology. Amen. The unseen world become greatly important in the 50s through a prophet of God to the church while DNA became the spiritual natural side of the tree of life. And and scientists started breaking into it. And it's pretty powerful because DNA then actually is just the genetical model or instruction of your life. You know, it's in every cell in your body. Whether the cells in your hair or in your big toe, the same instruction is in every cell that's in your body. Now, now when you talk about DNA, and I'm I'm going to I'm going to bring this to something that DNA in you, they find out that it has four letters. They just they just gave it fourletter alphabet. your English letter uh has 26. So like ABC D all the way to Z, you know. Amen. That that 26 letters, you take them and they can make a bunch of words. Those words are stacked up in a dictionary. All right? There's four letters in a DNA. Those four letters can only be put together so many ways. So what they do is they call it they call it a book of life or a genome. and they have discovered so like if you like when you get the dictionary wrote and you say well the the the letters can only be put together so many ways the code of DNA was broke in 1966. So in other words from the ' 40s till 1966 they were trying to break in to what the DNA was. They were trying to discover what DNA is what what DNA does and they were they kept breaking into it. But in 1966, they solved the code. Amen. In other words, from 1966 until the day we're living right now, there has been no more discoveries on the unfolding of what it is. They have now just put it in use. So what it did, it opened up a field under the scientists. They got through medical and they're using it in every kind. They're using it in investigations. They're using it in hereditary 23 and me. They're using it in all kinds of different areas. Amen. Because they're no longer trying to break the code. They're now using it in life. &gt;&gt; Do you see a message of the hour come on the scene and a prophet opened up this message? Amen. And God solved the thing for you and I. So today, preachers are not coming to the platform trying to open up the mystery of what it is. WE HAVE BROUGHT IT IN A PLACE THAT IT SHOULD BE PUT INTO the use of the bride of Jesus Christ. It ought to be WALKING POWER. IT OUGHT TO BE LIBERATING POWER. IT OUGHT TO BE STRENGTH IN YOUR BODY. But only when you begin to feed on it. &gt;&gt; When you begin to feed on it, it begins to open up the traits. How many knows, brother Brandham said, when we near the headstone, this bride will have his potentials. The potential or the traits of almighty God is laying in every believer sitting in this building. &gt;&gt; The potential to change dimensions are already INSIDE YOU TONIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU JUST HAVE TO EAT the message of the hour and it will do the work for you. &gt;&gt; Now, I I just I just think about me being a human being, being my mom and dad's son. Amen. I never had try to be that. After I had a birth, I just started eating and and when I eat, I begin to develop and begin to mature and I become exactly what my DNA was. Do you recognize why are we trying so hard to be something that God ALREADY MADE US? WHY ARE WE ALWAYS working so hard to be something we are? Amen. It puts us under weary, puts us under stress. But if we WOULD RELAX OURSELVES AND JUST BEGIN to eat the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, YOU ARE ALREADY BRIDE. YOU ARE ALREADY WHAT GOD MADE YOU TO BE. But when you begin to feed on the word, it begins to unlock the things that God has put inside of you. I I I I mean I I just got to I just got to studying on this thing and it's amazing because they actually have a book. You know, they call it the book of life. It's it's actually a book of of all of the genomes of what DNA. So if they're if they're looking at your DNA and there's a pair of the ATS and the CGs and it's arranged a certain way, they can say, "Oh, that'll turn out to be cancer one day, they can study your DNA and tell you before you get cancer because it's in your it's in your it's in your script. It's in your instruction." Amen. I think there was a famous Angelia Jolina one I think it was her. I'm not sure. I think it was her, but they one of them they found breast cancer in in they went in and she didn't have cancer, but she had the gene that would produce cancer eventually. They didn't know you get it in 5 years or 10 years. So, she preventively already had stuff did so that she wouldn't ever develop that in her body because genes are actually so real that they can prevent diseases before they ever happened. Amen. Do you recognize that we have a book? And in that book, it can detail the characteristics of your life and tell you where you're going and what you're doing. Before you ever get there, God can predict your future. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because it's already in you. &gt;&gt; Now, I I think it's powerful &gt;&gt; because on the DNA, amen, of certain people, it's written, you know, me and you share a DNA something probably similar. You're probably somewhere from Europe cuz it's that little short DNA, you know. Amen. We ain't going to get very tall. And and I don't care what kind of food you eat. Amen. I I often say I'll get bigger, but it ain't going to get taller. Amen. I can grow, but I'll never grow taller. Amen. Do you see the DNA either is your potential or your limitation? &gt;&gt; And there's a limitation that is set upon you. Do you know Brother Bram said this bride can't fail? &gt;&gt; Do you know HE SAID THAT THAT first Eve fell by the word, but there's coming another Eve that will never fall. Come on, CHURCH. THERE IS A a limit to what you can do. YOU CAN NEVER FAIL BECAUSE GOD HAS SO SET THE THING. YOU CANNOT commit adultery. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'LL NEVER COMMIT ADULTERY. IT'S WRITTEN ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. YOU CAN'T COMMIT adultery because the seed is already in you. You can't fail. The seed is already in you. Amen. It's written on the genetics of your life. There is limitations. Amen. And there is potential. Look at that potential laying there. He said there'll be overcomers in the last days. There's some overcomers sitting here tonight. And you can overcome anything the devil can throw at you. It's already written in the scriptures. Amen. He that overcomemeth what I grant is sit with me in my throne. You've got potential to rule. You got potential to rule IN THE COMING LIFE. BUT YOU GOT POTENTIAL to rule tonight. Amen. YOU GOT POTENTIAL TO RULE over the devil, OVER THE FLESH, AND OVER THIS WORLD. The ruling potential is in you. Now, if you're eating the wrong foods, it never unlocks it, right? Shuts that down, don't it? Y'all know what I'm talking about. You You start looking at the wrong things, you start eating the wrong things, you start listening to the wrong things, and it starts taking away that dominion, right? Amen. And so, you ain't nothing. You can't do nothing. You'll never go nowhere. You'll never be nobody. You eat on that a while and you can't get your head up. Amen. Because the devil knows how to lock your potential with what you're eating. That's why he's feeding this world with all of his demonic powers and influences of this age. Amen. But you know when when when I say these things, you know that actually is epigenetic. And there's a big study being done right now because they actually say uh uh that the food you eat. They said what it is is like okay like your uh your your your body is a piano. Your gen your genetics your DNA is a piano. The food you eat is the pianist. So when your food comes in the certain kinds of foods can unlock certain things. So like if a pianist is reading music the piano's the same right? But it makes one key sound louder. Like if he hit if a guy hits a certain key and that key is louder and the other one's light. Your food is doing that. It doesn't change the keyboard, it changes what's coming off of it. And and the message that you're devouring is determining what kind of life is SOUNDING OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN. YOU START EATING the wrong things and it quietens THAT NOTE OF SUPREME RULER OF POWER. IT QUIETENS THAT NOTE. AMEN. and all. It's still there, &gt;&gt; but it just quietly sounds. &gt;&gt; But you got it in you anyhow. It's written right there on the gene right there. Right there close to that overcomer, brother Will. Amen. Right there. There's that serpent stompings. It's right there. And they shall tread upon the head of serpents and scorpions. Amen. And every unclean thing, it's written there. Now, if you get the wrong message and people say, "Well, that was for days gone past and and that ain't for us no more and miracles ain't for the bride no more." You see what it does? It quietens. Amen. It quietens that hand of the supernatural that ought to MAKE IT RING OUT OF THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. BUT BROTHER, I BELIEVE IN A GOSPEL THAT'LL OPEN UP THE SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. BROTHER, let me tell you something tonight. You got an authority in you. You can walk on the head of every devil. Every devil IN HELL HAS BEEN PLACED UNDER THIS BRIDE. You can walk on the head of that demon. It's got no rights here. It's got no powers here. Amen. And if you get to listening TO THE RIGHT MESSAGES, AMEN, YOU'LL FIND an anointing that comes in your life THAT'LL GIVE YOU AUTHORITY OVER EVERY DEVIL, OVER EVERY POWER. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And they shall tread upon the head of serpents. You are genetically designed by Almighty God to walk on the head of devils and not get hurt. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. YOU'RE DESIGNED TO do it. YOU'RE DESIGNED. THAT'S RIGHT THERE on your right there on your jean. You're an eagle, sister. You're an eagle, right? And it means they fly higher than any other bird. That's who I am. I'm going to get higher than Leodysia. I'M GOING TO GET HIGHER THAN THE WORLD. I'M GOING TO GET HIGHER THAN THIS AGE AND ALL OF ITS TROUBLE. IT'S ON MY GENETICS, BROTHER. AND I GOT A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU'RE BORN FOR IT. YOU'RE DESIGNED FOR IT. YOU'RE ANOINTED FOR IT. YOU'RE THE BRIDE of Jesus Christ. It's written right there. [laughter] Amen. If you could pull out my DNA, my spiritual DNA, you could do it because it's written in the Bible, too. So, well, Brother Wayne, what are you really talking about? I'm talking about what you eat, &gt;&gt; how it determines your your your how your piano plays. It determines how your life lives. Things that are written in you, Amen, can be quietened and they can be prayed louder. You you take you take good worship, good praising people. How many like to praise the Lord? I mean, really, y'all like to worship the Lord. You know, I know some of y'all I've been in church with you really like to worship the Lord. You you get to listening to the wrong voices and it'll quieten that one. You know, they get to saying, "Well, it's just a bunch of emotion." Oh, they're just excited. They It's emotionalism. They get up there and beat the drums and get the people excited and and you know, and and what they'll do is they'll feed the church. They might take a part of a quote but not the intent of the quote. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to be balanced. &gt;&gt; You got to be balanced. If a person has good balance, brother John, do you know a good balance? You you can you can stand on one foot if you got good balance. So when you hear a quote that's one-sided, if you got balance, it won't throw you off your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when somebody gets up and reads a quote that makes it sound like, Amen. Don't lose your balance. You're balanced people. You know exactly what truth is. &gt;&gt; But Satan would quieten your worship. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD QUIETEN THAT PART of you that wants to worship God and wants to lift your hands and praise him. So he'll put an ever dirty name on it. He'll cause impersonators to rise up. He'll raise up ministers who are angels, transform themselves into angels of light, but they'll be dead men. Amen. There'll be doctors of divinity trying to put out the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Devil still talk, folks. And it's the seed of the serpent. It's it's it's brother Bam called it. He said the seed of discrepancy. Amen. To preach the Holy Ghost was for another age. Do you see what it'll do? IT'LL START QUIETENING THAT SIDE. IT'LL START HUSHING DOWN the moving of the Holy Ghost because of what some intellectual has to say. And if you start feeding on that mess, it won't be long. You know, they'll start preaching against certain songs or certain directions. And brother Kevin, you hear that song come across the church. Amen. And people will get tight &gt;&gt; because Dr. So and So Bishop So and So ain't there to say it's okay. I pray to God we don't have to have men that come and tell us what song we can sing, what song we can't sing. We ain't got no need for bishops in this message. We need to let THE PRESENCE OF GOD UNLOCK THE WORSHIP IN THE CHURCH AND THE ANOINTING OF GOD GET A HOLD OF THE BRIDE AND GIVE WORSHIP BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, I believe in it. I believe in it. You say, "Preacher, what are you talking about?" I'm talking about if there is foods that can quieten it, there's foods that can engage it. There's foods that'll open it up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There's good places. You go read Psalms 150 and tell me you shouldn't dance in the church. You read Psalms 150 and tell me we shouldn't have music in the church. You read Psalms 150 sometimes. Read the quotes. Read what Brother Brandham says. Brother Brandham said, "Oh, I tell you this." He said, "Any religion without emotion is dead and anything dead needs buried." Amen. I tell you what, tonight I'm not dead. I'm alive and I got SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME. AMEN. I STILL BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. I STILL BELIEVE IN WORSHIP AND THE POWER OF GOD. YOU LET ALL THE DEVILS DO WHATEVER they want to. I'M GOING TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. I'm going to do it IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMY. I believe I believe we are to feed the people something that'll BRING LIFE AND STRENGTH and anointing upon their lives. I believe we ought to be able to praise God. I believe we ought to praise him IN SUCH A PLACE, AMEN, THAT WE RECOGNIZE WE'RE NOT JUST eating bread. We're drinking the wine OF MELAZDC, WHICH WOULD MAKE a man drunk. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'll tell you what, plain and sensible. We ought not act like a bunch of people. Brother Bam said it. He said the revelation of the word would bring a stimulation that would affect you the same as natural wine affects a man drinking it. the preaching OF THE GOSPEL OR TO GET SO WONDERFUL IN THE CHURCH UNTIL IT'S LIKE DRINKING WINE. YOU LOSE YOUR CARES, YOU LOSE YOUR PRESENCE, YOU LOSE YOUR PRIDE, AND YOU GET INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN JUST WORSHIP GOD. You said, "Preacher, how far we are to go." Amen. I'm afraid we might go too far. Brother said, "That's all people want to talk about is who didn't go to they didn't they went too far." He said, "Denying the millions that never went far enough. I think we ought to eat something and make us feel like getting up in the mornings. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. We ought to be able to eat on something. Some food that'll turn on some praise jeans. &gt;&gt; You built to do it. You built to do it cuz God built you for worship. God loves worship. He built the bride for worship. How many knows that you WERE DESIGNED FOR WORSHIP? THAT GOD that you serve loves worship. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, amen. He ain't going to have to go to no angel to get the worship that belongs to him. I'm not giving it TO THE DEVIL. I'M NOT GIVING it to the world. I WAS CALLED TO WORSHIP. I WAS ANOINTED TO WORSHIP. I AM A MEMBER OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, folks. He don't want no blessing bride. He wants one that can go in the presence. &gt;&gt; One that can walk in there. Amen. to where they can feel the presence of God, the anointing of God. MY JUST WAIT OFF IN THERE. BROTHER BRAM SAID, "You ought to worship till you get to the place you don't even know your own name." &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, they really call him a fanatic, wouldn't they? That Brother Bam done lost his mind. All he wants to preach about is worship. Brother Bam said, "We ought to get so drunk until we don't even KNOW OUR OWN NAME." WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU even had a buzz? COME ON. WHEN'S the last time people got enough buzz just to lift their hand or clap THEIR HANDS OR HOLLER AMEN? I THINK WE OUGHT TO BYPASS THE BUZZ AND GET DRUNK ON THE ANOINTING OF GOD UNTIL THE PRESENCE OF GOD BREAKS INTO THE CHURCH. BROTHER, I want the WORD. I DO, TOO. BUT I WANT A WORD THAT'LL TURN ON [screaming] THE PRAISE GENE ON THE INSIDE OF A BELIEVER TODAY. &gt;&gt; HEY, HEY, HEY. Somebody said, "Well, Brother Wayne, hey man, I tell you, I'm just worried. I'm just worried that I might get out of water. I'm afraid I might get too loud. You know, somebody's going to think so. But not God. &gt;&gt; But not God. We are not rejoicing. We have power over demons. We are not rejoicing that we can cast out spirits, but our names have been written in THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. THIS MESSAGE IS THE BOOK OF LIFE BEING PREACHED IN THE AGE YOU'RE LIVING IN. And you begin to worship and praise under him. Brother, it to turn something on on the inside of you that brings steering and manifestations of life. It's the truth, folks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. We eat things. We eat things that make us so worried that we can't enjoy life. &gt;&gt; We can't enjoy things because it's what we're feeding on. &gt;&gt; We get to feeding on that stuff. Amen. And I tell you what, what you really need to do before you come to church is go get you a good bake full of TNT or Fox News or CNN. That's what you really need. Go sit down an hour of Fox News and get yourself full of all the nonsense that's in this, it's a political mess. AND WHICHEVER SIDE you're reading, IT'S A MESS AND IT'S A HELL BULLING OVER INTO THIS AGE. AND EVERY time you feed on it and you get stuck on it and you get to watching on it and you get more nervous and YOU GET MORE NERVOUS AND then you get short-tempered and then you get mean AND YOU WONDER WHAT'S WRONG. YOU'VE TURNED OFF RIGHT BACK IN THE CHURCHES. AMEN. WE OUGHT TO THROW THEM OUT LIKE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID to &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got an unsaved child. Amen. And and the devil just keeps feeding you. Oh, this is going to happen and that's going to happen. Just look just look at their problems and look at their issues. I tell you what, I got a food that can turn your head. I got a food that'll make your head spin the other way. Amen. It'll make you look at the promises of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I was thinking about this the other day and I was thinking about had he ride out there. Brother Brandham came with squirrel spoken word spoken word meat. &gt;&gt; My goodness. A prophet with spoken word meat come to her little cabin, little humble place. There was just a few of them there that night and he she was going to cook for him but he done the cooking that night. Hey man, she was going to cook him squirrel for him. But what he brought was another kind of meat didn't need cooking, brother. &gt;&gt; He got to tell him about that squirrel and how he spoke that seventh one. It was laying there. Amen. She got to gobbling that up. She got to believe in what he was saying. And it be to unlock something on the inside of her. AND SHE SAID, "BROTHER BAB, [screaming] IT AIN'T NOTHING BUT the truth." And when she began to agree with that word, ALL OF A SUDDEN there was something unlock. Listen, folks, if I had the God, I was to have the ability. There has been things that have been a part of what God created man for from the Garden of Eden all the way to the 1950s that had never been unlocked in a human being. &gt;&gt; But when brother Brandham told a story about creating a squirrel and she began to eat that and begin to feed on that, brother Bam said for the first time the third pull was exercised on a human being. Listen, it has not happened from the Garden OF EDEN ALL THE WAY TO HATTIE, RIGHT? BUT WHEN SHE FED ON THAT GOD WAS USING A MAN TO CREATE AGAIN, SOMETHING UNLOCKED ON THE INSIDE of her and brother weary turned to faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's not worry about them kids. Let's claim them. &gt;&gt; LET'S QUIT WORRYING ABOUT them and let's claim them. LET'S QUIT WORRYING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER OUR FAMILY. LET'S CLAIM WHAT'S going to happen OVER OUR FAMILY. IT'S IN YOU TO do it. &gt;&gt; There's a message for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you begin to feed on this word, listen, I'll tell you what it'll do. It'll unlock something in you that you can claim a child that don't look like there's no way for him to get saved. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you got an authority by almighty God. And when you begin to feed on that, what's it going to do? It's going to unlock something. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You start feeding on this message. The message is designed to make you what God made you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; People get a hold of it and they go to twisting it on &gt;&gt; and they take the great piano of God and they play the wrong song. [sighs] &gt;&gt; But you can eat this message. Oh, and it'll belt out the best music. Sweet sweet words of life. Your your your spirit, your life, your manifestation. I wish that uh I wished all the food that turned on good things taste like ice cream, but they don't cuz they start talking about broccoli and green tea and salads. And &gt;&gt; so sometimes you got to eat things you don't like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it'll do something for you nothing else can do. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. &gt;&gt; See, it'll unlock the expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's a natural DNA, folks, there is a spiritual one. &gt;&gt; Well, if I had another two hours, I'd preach it. I'm not going to tonight. I'm I'm going to make it mentioned so you can go look it up. But in Hebrews the 8th chapter, he said, "I'll make a new covenant." Hebrews 7, Melazdc. Hebrews 8, Melaz Mazdc's covenant. I'll make a covenant with you and I'll write it. I'll write it upon your heart. I'll write my laws in you. &gt;&gt; It'll be inscribed on the inside of you. And as you begin to feed on the word, it'll just start manifesting. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to try to be. You already are. &gt;&gt; You just have to eat to eat the message of that. I want you to stand to your feet with me tonight. It's a mystery of food. just go pull up that little butterfly and ask him how he got to be what he is. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I I tell you what I was. I was just a worm. I was just a worm and crawled up on the right leaf. I watched one of them one time and you know they they got real time then they got fast time and I watched a little butterfly while it was yet a caterpillar crawl upon a leaf and their bites are so small and they're so insignificant it takes a long time for you to even see that they ate anything but after a little while a hole begins to appear in the leaf where it's been brother as they start eating something starts unlocking something thus sayith the Lord said, "Crawl up in that tree right there and goes and crawls in a cocoon and and the things that it ate all of a sudden has the ability to change that thing from a worm to a butterfly from something that's ground on the ground bound to be there to something [music] that can take the heavens.
