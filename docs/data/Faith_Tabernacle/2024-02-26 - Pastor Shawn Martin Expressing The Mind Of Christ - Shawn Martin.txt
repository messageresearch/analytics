way he can do that is with his spirit burning all of our human ideas and things out of our lives and we certainly know that he's here to do that amen amen and the musicians can be dismissed it's good to be here in the house of the Lord and sister Bonnie it's really good to have you this evening and amen and um appreciate sister Bonnie and uh just all of God's people and uh we want to I heard brother Branson is sick and um uh I think there saying it's the flu or whatever so we want to pray for him and the Lord will just be with him as he's down there in Ohio and so they'll be traveling tonight or tomorrow I don't know which but want to keep him in our prayer amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of uh Philippians first of all uh the second chapter the things that we speak on tonight is something that we all know but um we just wanted to go uh through it again and because I think it's very essensual and so but uh the book of Philippians uh chapter 2 and verse five and it's says let this mind be in you can you say that with me let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so no other mind but his mind then if you'll turn with me to 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter amen and um I believe the 16th verse but it says for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we everybody say we have the mind of Christ amen let's just bow our heads our hearts to our maker father Lord as we come with Open Hearts truly the desire of our heart is that you would consume us Lord consume every selfish idea every selfish motive consume all the hum human part of us father that you could have complete control Lord that we wouldn't be a hindrance to you but that we would be yielded to you and I pray father that you would just anoint both speaker and hearer to tonight Lord I need you in a special way father and pray Lord that you would just um use my lips to speak to your people father that when we leave here we'd be better Christians Lord better equipped father we love you and we Just Surrender ourselves to you even now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen you can have your seats and I guess my title tonight would be expressing the mind of Christ expressing the mind of Christ and we are in a spiritual warfare I think most of us would know that and if you're trying to serve the Lord with all of your heart it becomes more I guess an awareness of just how great this this Warfare is is we all know that we're fighting an enemy that is so far stronger than than what we could even uh fathom as the uh Prophet said we're no match for the devil and and that is true um we see people overcome constantly by this enemy uh the people that once had strong faith that once had joy peace that once had just contentment um you see people that have just somehow they've been overcome by this by this enemy to where maybe they still go to church but it's just um it's just ritual it's just um survival surviving if you want to call it that and and um but but it's it's because that Satan is constantly warning Waring warning warning but I I truly believe that our experience with God can be greater than what it was when we first gave our heart to the Lord it can be more real it can be more uh um vibrant and uh but but we've got to know how to to to face the enemy to fight the and to overcome him and uh uh this this battles that we go through there is no natural weapon that can defeat the enemy it's just it's impossible uh you know and and we tend to to lean to the Natural uh such as if someone you know gives us a chew and out we just automatically react in a natural way that is just more common to to naturally to act and that is chewing them out or um uh you know again building this wall of offense and things or if the doctor says well you know there's just no hope or we start feeling the pain and not feeling good it's just automatically natural to start um uh you know looking at the natural things and well the doctor says there's no hope so I guess there's none or if if you know I feel sick so I am sick and I'm hurting and so therefore you know and I just don't know what's going to become of me and and and and it's just it's just that way and and and the world is becoming more negative no matter how we we have positive speaking as far as uh you know um I'm trying to think of the name of a gentleman that uh we'd hear on the radio a lot when I was a boy but uh he was a positive speaker just always speaking positive things and and yet uh uh it just seems like it's not the enemy is just still having a hey day but I don't believe that the church is meant to succumb to this enemy I I I believe that we are victorious in Christ and so what makes us different and and I'm talking to the elect and I trust all of us here are the elect Sons and Daughters of God but what what makes us different well the prophet said we we first were created for the purpose of controlling controlling not being controlled but the purpose of controlling and ruling and to praise God and to live for him so that's that's what we were made for is to control for the purpose of controlling to rule and to praise God and to live for him and what we are is our channels we're we're a channel and I looked up the word channel uh this afternoon and it's a a passage or a place of passing or flowing that through which anything passes it means a means a passing conveying or transmitting and I thought well that's that's pretty powerful that we we are channels which the Unseen can make itself known through us and our enemy is unseen our God is unseen right and yet we are the channels um we we're finding that people are more of a channel for the devil than they are God and and God uh Satan is able to manifest himself through them in in all kinds of ways and in all kinds of levels and and so anyone that can look at the sin and the muck and I don't care if it's in the rim of of religion Society culture science um uh Church whatever you you can say that there's something besides the humanity that is causing humans to act the way they are no no natural human would act evil in in that way and and these things well it's it's because they become uh a channel for uh Satan to make himself known and visible but we're not to be channels for the devil uh if if uh we are called the for to be channels that God can work through you see God wants to display his power and his authority through us you believe that amen we we say that God is a living God and I believe he is a living God we say that God is all powerful and that he reigns and and that nothing can defeat him that nothing can Dethrone him we we we say that that there's nothing greater than God and and and truly we we believe that how many believes that there there's nothing greater than God well then God chose you to think of that God chose you to show that he's all powerful God chose you as the channel to to reflect that that to let the people know that he is all powerful that he is not defeated and can never be defeated ain't that right see so so God wants to display him himself through us so when he comes through us we're just a channel we do not we do not make him weaker we do not change him in any form or fashion he is what he is when he comes and he works through us we're just the channel and and we know that he is the word and his word is spirit and life ain't that right so then if if he's going to have his way in us and we're just the channel for him then we must be a channel for his word amen for he is the word ain't that right you cannot separate the word from God you cannot separate God from the word to believe the word is to believe God to accept God is to accept the word ain't that right for God to flow through you is for God's word to flow through you see so then we we look and and I think you know uh God for the message of the hour to to to give us the Insight of things and and but but brother brandham he he goes uh and he talks about what it was before the word came what was it before the word and he says you know it was a thought first ain't that right amen so a word is a thought expressed and he brings that to our attention quite a bit a word is a thought expressed so God created the word World by his word ain't that right he spoke it let there be and there was but before he's created the world by his word he created the world by his thoughts he created the world by his thoughts first of all ain't that right God thought it first and then he spoke it into existence and then the word became materialized there is an order for that it comes as a thought then a word uh uh expressing the thought and then becomes material anytime that God's word is spoken it will materialize it must it it's got to there is no time there is no space there is there is nothing that will hinder the word of God from coming to pass if it is the word of God ain't that right see so we want that we want to be the channel That God's word can be uh uh flow through we talk about speaking the word of God and uh uh uh but but the the the but God's got a law and Matthew 21:21 and there's many other scriptures but it says Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if you have faith so say that with me if say that again if you have faith if you have faith and doubt not ain't that right you shall not only do this which was done to the Fig Tree and remember the conversation is that he went and and and he he wanted to find fruit on the tree that there was no fruit and so he cursed the Fig Tree and then he moves on he just he didn't stay around to see if it'll happen he knew it was going to happen he spoke the word right and so he goes on up into Jerusalem I believe it was or or wherever it was and then that evening he comes back or the next day and they stop by that tree and the tree is withered up and the disciples now he's not the one that brought it up the disciples brought it up because they were amazed that that tree obeyed his word right what he said happened to that tree and he he wasn't like oh W guys did you have to see this I spoke it yesterday and it happened you know no no they were amazed uh uh and and and so now Jesus turns to them and says but if I say unto you if you have faith he's not working any kind of magic he's not giv them all kinds of things go to school and learn this and you've got to be this this this and that and have so many Bachelor degrees and all that if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the victory but also if you say unto this mountain be thou removed ain't that right who's saying it you are saying it ain't that right if you say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it might be done I think it could no it shall be done now he is just as certain about that as he was certain that that fig tree was going to obey his own word he was so certain of that ain't that right true see see all things he goes on to say whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believeing everybody say believing you shall receive so then you must have faith you must believe so faith is not wondering if it's going to happen faith is not questioning if it's going to happen faith is not wishing for it to happen Faith knows it's going to happen amen Faith doesn't consider time Faith doesn't consider situation Faith doesn't consider situations amen is circumstance or whatever see so now what kind of Faith must we have well there's only one faith that that Jesus talks about when he says have faith in God the Greek is have the faith of God have the faith everybody say have the faith have the faith of God Amen God's Own Faith don't have the faith of the preacher don't have the faith of mom and dad don't have the faith of the deacon don't have faith of the hope don't have the faith of President Trump amen have the faith of God ain't that right there's no other Faith that's going to move mountains but have the faith of God ain't that right see so then as we know in the beginning God believed his own word God does not ask you to have faith in his word if he's not going to have faith in his word amen you're you're a chip off the old block ain't that right amen see so if you're a son and daughter of God then he would expect you to have his own faith if if you're part of him amen Peter says being made partakers of the divine nature well if we're partakers of the divine nature then we should be partakers of his Divine peace of his Divine Joy of his it's it's it's a joy it's a peace it's a faith it's a contentment that surpasses anything that Humanity ever can tap into it's a divine nature ain't that right so he tells us the faith that we must have is the faith of God he believed his own word that's what caused him to speak it in the first place he would have never said let there be light if he did not believe that his word would produce it ain't that right but he believed his own word therefore he stepped on that invisible platform when there was nothing to show that there could be light there was nothing that could produce light except within himself and he spoke the creative word which is in you now he create he spoke the creative word Let There Be and there was but first of all he believed it ain't that right and what did he believe he believed his own word and what was his word they were thoughts in his mind he in his thinking he wanted he wanted light in his thinking he wanted a world in his thinking he wanted Sons and Daughters of God in his thinking he wanted redemption in his thinking he would provide a savior A Healer a way out in his thinking ain't that right and this whole Bible is nothing but God's thoughts Express of not only a messiah of a redeemer of a of a savior but also of you ain't that right yes sir and it's nothing about uh uh uh you being down and out it's nothing about Satan just trumping all over you and and stopping and destroying you and and and to where you're nothing but just in Ruins no it speaks of you as an overcomer as a Victorious a as a Son of God if if he reigns you Reign if if if if he triumphs you will Triumph if he has overcome you shall overcome if he did it you will do it can you sayen you're a part of him and he expects none less he expects no less amen you with me he expects no less that's right the Lord come on now so God believed his own word that's the faith of God so having the faith of God is God believing his own word in you not God believing his own word in heaven God now in you believing his own word am ain't that right so that kind of faith comes by having the mind of Christ and the prophet says then you can see it clear once you have the mind of Christ I and I I think this is important Once the mind of Christ comes to us the faith of God comes to us because we can see it clear now we can see Victory clear we can see healing clear we we can see that every promise of God that it belongs to us and we can see it clear we're not guessing at it we're not wondering at it it's we're not looking at it as as the donkey chasing the carrot all day long no no no we see it clearly as for you and I can you say Amen see so therefore by having the mind of Christ we're not looking at natural things we're not looking at the at at at at what this natural eye can can looks at that we're not we're not depending on anything of our feelings of our emotions of our Sensations everything can testify contrary but if we have the mind of Christ then we have the faith of God see just because you cannot just I'm speaking naturally now just because in the natural your back is against the wall you see no way out does not mean you are helpless it does not mean that that that that Satan's got you and now you're just a victim that is a flat if you're a part of God now God is giv you something greater than a president has something a power than than even angels have is you now have the mind of Christ the mind of Christ can you say Amen so so I I hope that is all right see then brother Brown said see when the mind of Christ is in the man it then becomes a faith then we speak it that's good can you say Amen why because we've we tapped into his thoughts we've tapped in it's not our thoughts it's not me trying to be a Christian it's not me thinking well I I just want to go to church and I just want to make it to heaven and I just oh no no no no you tapped into his mind it's his thoughts that sees you already there it's his thoughts that sees you saved you were saved before the foundation of the world you you were all you're already in the Rapture before the foundation of the world you you've already got a body that is waiting for you can you say Amen it's in the mind of God and then when you catch that Mind Of God Amen then it's not you just wishing it's now it's becoming a reality you caught the thoughts of God see then it becomes a faith not a wish not just a desire a faith then we speak it and it comes into existence he said the very same thing that God did in the beginning yes amen amen praise the Lord see it's as though God is speaking see himself and and he is he is speaking except he's using your body he's not done in a spirit form in the form of a pillar of fire as he did in the beginning amen there was no body uh human body then ain't that right he just spoke uh in it as as an invisible but but he was in that Pillar of Fire that theophany amen and he spoke from there let there be now he speaks in your body praise the Lord see so to have the mind of Christ is to think his thoughts see the prophet said it's a Channel of Christ that we have tap tapped into tapped into yes sir you know uh uh people tap into a lot of things yeah they do they can break into your email they can tap into your bank account they can tap into your phone conversations they can tap into and they're good at it you know and they know what know what you've been saying know what you've been conversing nobody you know they they know about you believe it or not sometimes you know you it's scary having them them phones you be You' be talking of a conversation and all of a sudden advertisement pops up of the very thing that you just talked about and you're like oh okay this is weird something's going on but to think of it you can tap into the mind of God to know what an eternal God's been thinking about for eternities and we have that ability to do so we are Sons and Daughters of God and he expects none less who have known the mind of God but we have his mind ain't that right see so now brother brandham said see it's a Channel of Christ that we have tapped into who Sons and Daughters of God he said it's the mind of Christ see that the human being has the privilege to enter in and know the mind of Christ Hallelujah my what a reality to dwell in the channel of Christ what a reality to think of it you could go through your discouragement you can go through ups and downs you can go through all kinds of Hell on Earth but you're now having the reality of being able to tap into the channel of Christ man see so we unworthy Mortals have been brought in to be Sons and Daughters of God to be fellow citizens ain't that right amen you know if if we're Sons and Daughters of God if we're part of God then surely there's a part of God about us that we got to act like God sure speak like God think like God ain't that right so see he says see we've been brought into a real that even the angels know nothing about you and IJ angels are just servants you realize they're at your bidding yeah they are angels are at your bidding you're not at the bidding of angels angels are at your bidding angels Don't have the power that you have praise our God it's a relationship with God that they don't enter they cannot enter into so it's the Sons and Daughters of God having the mind of Christ amen see what is it thinking as God thinks thinking as God thinks you've tapped into his thoughts you're the channel that's right for his thoughts to Anchor amen amen ain't that right before you can speak the word of God there's got to be his thoughts that's right amen amen so then you have the mind of Christ to have the mind of Christ is to be able to perceive to understand to know and I think this is what the message is all about is getting the thoughts of God to us that you are Sons and Daughters of God that you are his offspring that you are the redeemed of God you cannot lose you cannot fail you cannot go under you cannot be destroyed if God before us who can be against us amen thoughts thoughts of God can you say Amen this Bible is nothing but God's thoughts that's right God's word in seed form amen ain't that right now notice what the prophet said the word is in the bride right God ain't going to place his word in nothing else but his bride I think that's powerful the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ who's got the mind of Christ the bride you who's got the word of God you you we're we're privileged Church amen no man could put his Dogma in you God reserved you so he can put his word in you Satan's tried to put his traditions and all kinds of false lies and doctrines and well false lies false doctrines and lies and and all of these things of man-made and and and all of these things but God would cleanse us from these things so he could put his word in there and the word now is in the bride not contaminated bride a real bride holding a real uncontaminated word of God can you say Amen praise the Lord yes sir and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with that word that's right she does it in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord she has thus sayith the Lord can you say Amen to think of it you in this day could fulfill the scriptures you're you're you're called to fulfill the scriptures if you shall say not if I say but you shall say right remember that become real known to brother brandom out in the woods you know it wasn't that if I could say but you shall say he I didn't even understand that scripture and then all of a sudden you know there was no squirrels sitting there and then it voice how many squirrels do you want right you know and and then God held him to that remember he's he he spoke let there be a squirrel and and then there was one then he was going to go home I think that's what it was but you said you said three CH if you say it it's got to come to pass it's the word of God God's going to hold that Hallelujah you believe that even though it was just brother brandham in in the woods no one could have refuted it no one could have known any different he could have kept that quiet and said well I thought you know but God with hold him to it it's God's word amen amen so to have the mind of Christ is to have the word in you and to have the word in you is to have thus say the Lord amen ain't that right so a word is a thought expressed it starts as a thought then expressed into word brother Braham said what is the word a word is a thought manifested a thought spoken forth see God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and uh it became a word and the word became material everything that God has spoke in his word received into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is say that again everything everybody say everything that God has spoken his word received into the right channel amen how means the right channel this word is so powerful it amen God has protected this word throughout the ages he is so protected it ain't that right now if he would protect it on the pages how much more would he protected in you he he protected this so that you would come along in this age a prophet would come and straighten out all the isms and all the schimms and reveal the true mysteries of God so that you could have the true word and if you're that right channel then that word's going to going to produce exactly what it says for whatever promise be behind it is God will do it he's obligated to do it ain't that right now John 15:6 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you see so you abiding in the word the word abiding in you means that you and the word are inseparable ain't that right that's right you and the word are are inseparable so the word must abide in you don't you let the devil take that word out amen don't don't don't let the devil take that word out don't let your trials take that word out because the words got to be in you before you go to asking come on now now brother Bram said this is Christ every word in here is God itself wrote in print receive it in your heart amen and watch what happens after you receive it another place if you need anything from God the seed of God will produce it if you'll just receive it into your heart and believe it with all of your heart can you say amen amen that's right see now everything that Satan has taken from us Christ redeemed it at Calvary so our faith is is based upon the finished work of Calvary right ain't that right the Lord the finished work of Calvary and so we have been redeemed back to our position everything that we are air to that God made us for and God gave to us we now have the rights Amen to take it it it it belongs to us amen our children belongs to us amen I don't believe that that brother brandom just talked about our children uh you know uh being ours if it really wasn't for us but this is part of the book it's ours our children belongs to us healing belongs to us do you believe that healing belongs to us joy peace contentment happiness Victory It All Belongs to us a new Heaven and a new Earth it belongs to us a millennial Reign belongs to us the changing of our body belongs to us every Divine promise of God it belongs to us do you believe that church if you believe in the Redemption of Christ you have to believe that it belongs to you he didn't die and just to give you a part of a promise and then and then leave the everything out that's just a lie you if we believe what he he died for then we truly have have to believe that every promise is ours it belongs to us it belongs to us there shouldn't be one thing that we should question about God's promises oh well I believe I'm saved but I don't know if I'm going to Rapture then you don't believe you're saved you can't if if God would save you then he's not going to leave you well I believe i' i' I've got the Holy Ghost but I just don't know if I I'll ever get my healing or not well then you can't have the Holy Ghost you've got if you can believe for the Holy Ghost and you can believe for your healing why would God leave it out for you why why would God leave all the promises out can you say Amen we're the one that limits God we're the one that limits him because we can't believe for it but have the faith of God all things are possible to them that believe how can it be possible he redeemed it he bought it all back Satan's just a squatter can you say amen he might be squatting on your spirit tonight you have the right to say get away from me he might be disturbing your mind but you have the right you're a son and daughter of God that's right you believe it now we can see that it belongs to us through the opening of the book that's right it belongs to us see this message is the open opening of the word and when the word was opened John saw himself as I said I believe he saw himself in every promise amen amen and John was only a representation of us he was caught up in this day he saw the lamb take the book he saw the book open he looked up on that book and every promise he saw himself in why would the prophet spend all this time preaching promises if we ain't going to believe it that's right brother amen that's right come on church it's so sad when message people believe that God sent a prophet and they believe that the lamb has opened the book and I'm I'm I'm talking to all of us now and we get into the dumps we get as though we can't see Victory true it's because Satan has a way to mess with us but I'm telling you you ain't going to go in a Rapture that way you got to you got to look see it clearly for you right you got to see everything clearly I will make it can you say man that's what mind of Christ is I've got the mind of Christ then if we've got the mind of Christ if we know that this Bible is true if we know every promise is true and the prophet brought us these promises then we must not let the devil mess with our minds amen that's the truth brother BR talked about living below their privileges well I think it's time that we quit below living below our privileges can't you can't go on Rapture living below your privilege that's right now come on church it's just the facts ain't that right God ain't going to wiggle the wand over us and then we make it all of a sudden yeah no you fight your way through it you speak your way out of it you speak your way into it speak your way into a Rapture speak your way into a body change clim it confess it Lord that's what we're doing we're confessing can you say Amen creating an atmosphere a creative atmosphere not an atmosphere of doubt and moolly grubs and grumbling and mumbling and as though you know God ain't for us hogwash I don't care if you don't feel that if God is for you God is for you it's the word of God let this mind be in you take on the mind of Christ can you say amen he knew he was Messiah he knew that he was the promised one he knew that that word spoke of him he knew that even before they arrested him that he would rise from the grave he knew it because the word said let that mind be in you can you say Amen let that mind be in you see Jesus Christ redeemed every promise at Calvary amen but in this day in this day what has he done he didn't come to die again we don't need him to die again he he died once and for all he perfected once and for all them that are Sanctified once for all that you are perfected once for all when did when are you perfected when you when you come to an altar no he perfected you that day at Calvary he redeemed you at Calvary he saved you at Calvary he healed you at Calvary by his stripes not we are healed we were healed we were healed can you say Amen why because Redemption has power in it calvary has power and the blood has been speaking in this age the word the bloody bleeding word oh every promise covered by his blood do you believe it yes sir covered by his blood that's what makes it sure see so he didn't come to die again but he's come to claim claim what he has redeemed claim everybody say claim he's come to claim clim you he's come to claim you what was the seals all about coming to claim you what was the the seven angels all about he came to claim you well what was it was it a bum claiming you was it some little wimp that was claiming you it was the Supreme judge that the devil has to give way the Supreme judge said you're you're sinless you're spotless you are my bride the sest judge amen or the Supreme judge has called you what you are according to his thinking that's exactly right can you say amen he come to claim he come to claim and now what's he doing he's claiming it in you every promise he's claiming it in you through you amen hallu you believe it he's claiming these promises through you through you don't act helpless it's through you he gave you the word he put the word he deposited the word in you you shall speak everybody say I shall speak I shall speak and it shall be done you need it speak it praise the Lord claim our god-given rights yes amen you love him the power to create the world came from God's thoughts being expressed not expressing a wish not expressing wants right but expressing his thoughts yes sir power came by God expressing his own thoughts surely amen prise the Lord don't express your thoughts you can express negative all you want to ain't going to work right amen can you say Amen Express his thoughts that's it have the mind of God the mind of Christ yes see there had to be a thought first the thought had to be there and then he had to express those thoughts into word by speaking it ain't that right the thought had had to be there church before you can speak the word the thought has to be there and he's giv you a bunch of them that's right now you got to receive them to God think upon them dwell upon them meditate upon them didn't the pon say let the meditation of my heart be acceptable unto thee don't don't don't just meditate on anything don't just accept anything don't accept anything as true your feelings ain't the truth your sensation ain't truth then don't accept them as truth your symptoms ain't the truth God's word is the truth ain't that right you're you're you're simp you can feel sorry for yourself it ain't going to give you the power to do anything praise God we all ought to know that one right now brother Bram said what is a word a word is the manifestation of a thought is expression of a thought before you say anything everybody say before you say anything oh subconsciously you think it before you speak is that right so in the beginning was the word that's as far as we go back by this by theology but before the word was it was a thought and a thought was manifest made manifest you see what I mean that's how he said first he thought and he spoke the word and the Word was made manifest oh how infallible God is notice every thought when it's spoken no wonder when Jesus came off the hill that night and looked around that tree for food there was no food on the tree and he said no man eateth from thee and he went on away see and the next day coming back the tree had withered what was it God's mind everybody say God's mind God's mind that that what was it did he have did he have h a superpower no just had God's mind was he trained in how to say it no just had God's mind praise the Lord and the mind the mind that in the beginning the same mind that was in the beginning amen that was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ the same one was expressing that word back again oh see so to speak the word of God is to express the mind of God Amen is that right right see now man can speak the word through intellectual conception but that's not possessing the mind of Christ we're speaking of Revelation something that has struck your soul Glory that's it right there how many believes you're saved amen you believe you're saved how do you know you're saved because the preacher said you're saved or did it become such a revelation to you amen I'm sa so then if someone were to come to you and say oh you're not saved what what would you do would you sit there and say well I thought it was well the preacher that's dead now or my mom that's gone they used to tell me I'm safe so I just believed it no it becomes such a revelation to you then then and they come and tell you you're not saved you say well you wasn't there what is it you're expressing something you're expressing the mind of God because it became a revelation to you well that goes with healing that goes with anything of God's promises the devil now here's the thing a lot of times it's not a person in flesh it's the devil coming into our thoughts and then our thoughts become more intimate with us we think it's actually us that is doing it we think it's actually us that are Sav saying it we're and it actually a lot of times them thoughts coincide and with our feelings and our Sensations and everything well I don't feel s saved you know and the mind is saying you're not saved well I don't feel saved so I must not be saved that is the devil can you say Amen don't be a channel for that stupid devil God didn't save you to be a channel for the devil and lend your body over for his power and subject your thoughts to his thoughts and and all these things you are a channel for God the Bible says you are bought with a price you're not your own your Gods Hallelujah you believe it yes sir so you speak by Revelation see it's it's something that's been revealed to you that's right now brother Brandon goes on every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form that if received into the human being now think of it this word can literally be received in to you ain't that amazing God made it to where that you just wouldn't receive it or or read it but literally this word could be received in you oh I'm so glad for that e Jes that we can actually receive the word that we've got the ability to receive the word you got you got the ability to receive it well if you got the Holy Ghost you do how in the world could you even get the Holy Ghost if you didn't have the ability to receive the Holy Ghost so every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought don't put nothing to it if God said you're healed you are healed don't put anything to it well I thought I was healed well but I'm still hurting well I still can't see well nothing's changed don't you put nothing to that must be spoke by the same thought and remember God's thoughts are Eternal and they are real it's not a fake it's not it's not like a a a man Builder looking on the blueprint and then looking and and and and going to transfer this into reality see God's thoughts are real already that's why you're already saved that's why you were already glorified you're already it's already done it's God's thoughts so then when you take on the mind of God and now you speak the word in the same thought by that same thought you don't worry about it no more I don't care about feeling I don't care about the pain I don't care about how I look and I don't care about the situation it's already done it's already taken care of already saved they're already filled with the Holy Ghost we are victorious we've already made it it's already done well how do you know it's already done God said so that's all that we need God said so we don't need scientific proof we don't need medical proof God said so spoke by the same thought sir can you say amen amen that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass that's right how powerful could the church be see the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression we'll try to hurry now God said let the world let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God in the creation created the thought the World by his thought first then spoke it and the thought be expressed became material ain't that right amen see now if that same spirit that said let their there be light and there was light Let There Be trees and there was trees if that same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so see it's your thoughts well I thought it was God's thoughts but hold it you and God are one now can you say Amen you and God are one yes sir on now see you say oh that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you if you should say to this mountain be moved plucked up and cast into the sea don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you shall say will come to pass you'll have whatsoever things thou sayest you shall have it not me Jesus said not me see you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happens amen glory praise the Lord well how do you know you're going to go in a Rapture I see it how you know you're one of them I see it how do you know you're going to be not left behind I I see it well how do you know you're going to have a body change I see it how do you know you're going to be at the wedding supper I see it I there's a table waiting for me there's a chair I see it can you say Amen yes sir there's no one going to take my place I see it that's the mind of Christ having the mind of Christ feelings are going to lie to you emotion's going to lie to you your old flesh is going to lie to you who cares Hallelujah GL you got to keep fighting church this is no picnic yes sir you're in a battle God called you to be a so you're not a wimp and he's given you his word what word his own mind can you say amen that's why God needed to have a prophet we needed a prophet not a theologian a prophet no wonder Satan tried his best to make muddle up this word so we wouldn't know how to fight that the church is being defeated long enough it's time for the adoption of sons it's time that the sons come back to their Authority their rightful place to control to rule to defeat the Devil to handcuff every situation and bring it under their feet Hallelujah can you say Amen you see it before it happened and notice and express it in word form can you say Amen express it in word form you say well how do I say it because you believe with all your heart that this Bible is right God ain't playing these stupid games he loves me loves me not he loves me loves me not I like him I don't like him I like him I don't like him he ain't messing with you he's for real it's Satan's the one that mess with your feelings now Satan's the one that get you wrapped up in the world to where you get to feeling happy and then he dumps you amen amen that's right brother can you say Amen s get you into a mirage but God will never lead you into a ra Mirage you'll never see a mirage by God what God says it's real and these are his thoughts concerning you they're Eternal thoughts not passing thoughts they're Eternal thoughts premeditated thoughts that's right amen good preaching so he says see you express it in word and then word form and that word word takes a hold and becomes material a thought expressed oh my if your heart and your mind is so and in filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being see I hope this is helping you tonight what kind of people should we be if if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or power that you don't use your own thoughts leave your own thoughts behind die to your own thoughts crucify them thoughts can you say Amen yes sir now see that's what we got to fight that's right fight that's right amen God help us all to fight amen he said see you don't use your own mind you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church we would be amen don't wait for something magical to happen it's already here it's given to you you're the one that's been called to this message than Hallelujah I don't understand why people think they need to go listen to everything else besides the message good Lord you know why because the devil is so blind to them to where they don't understand what this message is to us amen you ought to feed off this message every day every day every day you got time to feed off the off the thoughts the negative thoughts that the devil puts in your mind why not use get some Arsenal and fight against the guy come on church I don't you should never be too busy to listen to a message never be too busy amen I don't care if you're slow as an ant in house cleaning and and doing your work and all that I don't care listen to this message too many people are getting whipped up because they don't take this message seriously amen the devil's goddess all the time he get you in your dreams it gets you when you get up it gets you when you go to bed get you when you're while you're eating get you while you're at work at school he just he just comes Na and we entertain it and before you know what we start I don't know if I'm saved what who told you that who told you you're not saved who told you you're sick now don't think I'm just crazy I'm just passion right now I'm tired of that stupid devil who told you you ain't going to make it brother Tim who told you your children ain't going to be saved God didn't that's exactly so we let the devil tell us these things and he convinces us to where we just hold our head down we just don't know what to do oh gosh you're a child of God you're a child of God put on the mind of Christ put on the mind of Christ can you say Amen you don't have it's not up to you to wonder how it's going to happen I don't care how it's going to happen it's going to happen you understand what I'm saying I don't care when it's going to happen it's going to happen glory to God see so what kind of a people would it be this morning at the brandham Tabernacle we'll put Faith Tabernacle this evening was so filled with the presence of God when you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't he have no alternative of your own but just to be led by the spirit amen they that are the the sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out the spirit of God FS that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material oh God he says see I that's when the church in its power I believe it's on its road now see that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from theirselves that they don't see themselves they have no thoughts but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ and the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity everybody say deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the very thought of their mind am how is deity going to be revealed by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the very thoughts of your mind that's right God have mercy that's where we're at church amen amen glory yes sir isn't the Lord wonderful this is the age of personal life of Christ it's what the prophet said right it's the token amen and it's the only time that God's required a token of all ages or the church ages is in this time remember ra said they kept the lamb lamb lamb lamb all the way through but now is the time for the token to be displayed the personal life of Christ amen put on this plate deity being revealed now the mind of Christ as we get get ready to just wind down the mind of Christ does not produce negative thoughts right you with me it does not produce negative thoughts amen so you got to get that very clear negative thoughts don't say well I don't know if that came from the devil or came from God it did not come from God right now you're the channel you have every right to refuse what thoughts you want to entertain now God help us yeah that's right amen because because I'm be honest a lot of times it's so it's it's it's just natural to want to feel sorry for ourselves right I mean petting this old flesh I mean come on sure ain't that the best thing to do a I just don't feel good then we want mama to feel sorry for us then we want everybody to feel sorry sorry for us I just don't know if I'm going to make it I don't know why no one's calling me you know just to say hi maybe I need to make it a little louder we like to pet ourselves we we we we like to and here's the deal we like to identify don't identify with sickness don't identify with defeat don't ident them aren't God's thoughts that's right can you say amen and you know good and well this old flesh is so carnal it'll just go that way the carnal mind is iment against God it cannot become subject to the law of God you have to have the mind of Christ then by that mind you put this body under subjection amen it's more easy to speak negative than positive because when you speak negative you you're you're speaking to how you feel how you think you're speaking to this old flesh everything about you is testifying yep amen sister you just preach it right and any audience that we love is ourselves if no one wants to listen we'll give ourselves the audience right and so many times we even just speak it out loud I'm sick oh dear old me I don't even know how this day is going to go who you talking to uh nothing we got our own audience but the mind of Christ does not speak NE produce negative thoughts hello Prophet said when when we believe God with all of our heart and accept his son the Lord Jesus and God recognizes that faith is true in him May our faith be true in him then he sends back down the the Holy Spirit of promise and seals us until the day of our Redemption my that takes all the scare all out of it there's no negative thoughts at all in Christianity so ham is a true blue Christian praise the Lord I don't care if you have to lift it up by faith just no there's no negative thoughts in Christianity and God has called me to be a Christian I ain't here to be a Christian and a sinner right I'm not here to be a believer and a doubter I'm here to be a Christian my mouth is going to speak Christian my thoughts are going to be Christian my ways are going to be Christian can you say Amen am amen Christians got got a good name that's right no negative thoughts negative thoughts as we all know does not produce positive language amen negative thoughts produce what negative language negative talk negative actions right so how are you doing that don't know well you just automatically know they're entertaining negative thoughts well that's just me I'm just negative well if you're a Christian you got to change that and you have the power to change it God gave you a prophet God gave you a word can you say Amen you got the choice to either receive all the negative and and receive all the the garbage to where you live such a life of defeat or you have the power to say you know what I'm sick and tired of this just sick and tired of it may not happen all spont spontaneous but you start speaking you start thinking God's thoughts can you say amen and before you know it you're going to climb yourself out of this thing climb yourself out of it can you say Amen we're not here to be defeated you realize Church you realize church that when we get to heaven as the bride of Christ you will have overcome every enemy there will not be one little imp be able to walk up to God and say you know what you took him out early because he didn't get me well who are you well Pride bitterness no no no everyone's got to go under our feet and the thing is the Bible says he's already put everything under his feet Christ's feet and if you're his body and he's the head then it's under your feet so then let's talk like that is that all right brother BR said now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of of people they say well and I read this last Sunday but I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil want you to say man he said you're just talking his language right then yes amen you must never say that everybody say I must never say that that's just as much of a sin as going out and getting a beer come on church it's sin when we talk unbelief remember we talked about last Sunday brother brand talks about them when God told them Israel to put up the blood display the blood on the house and get in and if when I see the blood I'll pass over you he said for them to fear under that blood for them to worry and fear and and and shiver and and wondering what's going to happen he said it would have been an insult to Jehovah that's right and he says and we insult God when we talk unbelief and he said don't insult God if God said he'll provide for your needs don't insult him by talking negative that's good he's the one that said you're loosed by the very blood of God then don't insult it by questioning it now notice you must never say that don't let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all of my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all of my heart you might be sick as a dog but I still believe in Divine Healing amen you might have been in plague for years but I still believe believe in Divine Healing can you say Amen let your testimony always and your thoughts and everything never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it and when it starts that don't entertain it God help us right well you say well I can't help the thoughts from coming we'll be like that the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting that's a good thing you can't help thoughts when they come but you don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to keep them and I'm going to testify of them keep your thoughts positive can you say amen that's what he said keep your thoughts positive so keep your thoughts positive about your future keep your thoughts positive about your family keep your thoughts positive about your lost children keep your thoughts positive about your health hello brother BR said you know how that farmer kept them crows away from from from rouon he said he had a shotgun and he said and so do you have a shotgun you can keep them thoughts amen from going into your mind and roosting them he said you got the shotgun he's old and new testament can you say Amen you don't Old and New Testament you don't have to win the lottery Old and New Testament amen Lord so he says see you know when you think about God when you keep you keep your mind oh see he said you sit in church and think about everything else but God how you going to do your washing how you going to do at the office tomorrow how you going to do this or that or the other keep your mind off of that and think on God the Bible says if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things well I wonder if I'll be even called in the prayer line wonder if God will speak don't think that kind of negative thought don't let don't let it go through your mind make every word positive and every thought positive is this okay make every word positive make every thought positive run that stinking devil off sir Amen Let deity be revealed in you can you say amen I think negative thoughts keep us from being a real channel for God Amen because we we know that what sweet and bitter water cannot flow from the same fountain and this is why the fight is so hard because Satan is prevalent the lid of hell has been lifted off he's here he's manifesting himself and it's getting stronger and stronger to where he's going to be incarnated and and it's it's so the fight is on and it's it's very real it's very true you're the only ones that have the power to resist him ain't going to go there devil can you say Amen you know what the prophet said you cannot get anything from God with the negative thought right so no wonder the devil puts us thoughts negative thoughts and we catch it and we entertain it quit doing that and I'm talking to myself right now quit doing it you can't get nothing from God by negative thought that's right amen notice what he says while I'm praying and speaking I want want every person in here to have this in your mind that as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building well now that's what he told everybody to have as we're getting ready to pray he says every one of you this is what you're going to have now I want you to start thinking on this way I'm going to get up and I'm going to walk out of here well right he says don't have nothing else in your mind just keep thinking that let your testimony be positive let your confession be positive can you say amen that's right Amen brother Brown said every time you get sick and you were prayed for and you go out and get a little sick you say well I guess I lost my healing he said then your testimony becomes negative and Jesus can't say no more for you he's the high priest of your confession sitting there making intercessions on you your confession on what you believe can you say Amen you can bring Doom and Gloom on you just by negative thoughts you can make them things happen come on brother job said the things that I feared Came Upon me can you say Amen yes sir the devil knows the power of thought but God does too and God has made it known to us in this age amen I love the Lord do you amen if the musicians will come 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God who's going to cast it down you me the children Sons and Daughters of God cast down reasonings brother Bram called it reasonings casting down all reasonings and every High thing that exalted itself against the word of God yes the mind of God the thoughts of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ oh ain't that wonderful so one last quote brother Brown said in order to stay with God stay gentle for God is gentle in order to stay with God stay with love for God is love stay Meek don't never be self-sufficient all always rely upon Him amen never use your own mind take his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts and take them into your carnal mind and repeat them over and over and over repeat them over oh God and say oh God take all my doubt away and let my thoughts be your thoughts and you sick people do that as we're speaking just take away Cast Away the thought of sickness whatever you're having issues with tonight just cast that away and take God's healing thoughts and let them become your thoughts if you're bound then don't dwell upon them thoughts of bondage take God's delivering thoughts right can you say Amen Tak God's thoughts of Victory if you're needing Victory don't sit there and dwell on defeat well I'm just this way you you'll never no person on the face of the Earth will be able to stand before God and say well I was born this way I was always this way so you just have to accept it no there's a power of transformation in the word of God that'll change you change you I've seen it I've seen it change the drunk to sober I've seen that I've seen God take drug addicts that cannot help themselves and totally deliver them and change them around I've seen that I've seen God put marriages back together I've seen it amen yes I've seen legs that were short grow out to the normal length of the other leg I've seen the blind open I've seen the lame walk seen it there's a power of transformation thank you Lord it can happen it will happen it is happening how else did you get here that's right how else did you get where you are can you sayen oh my we've been made more than
