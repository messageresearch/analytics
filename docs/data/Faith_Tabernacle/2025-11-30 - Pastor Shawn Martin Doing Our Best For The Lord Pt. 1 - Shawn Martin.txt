God bless you all. And always uh good to have them here. Amen. I trust everyone had a good Thanksgiving. Amen. Didn't eat too much. Amen. Maybe you did and still tired and Amen. I uh well I was telling the musicians down there, well everybody looks the same. You didn't grow too much. I think I grew out a little bit, but uh anyways, we had a good time. And so we thank the Lord for that. And glad we was able to make it uh to church today. Amen. All this uh weather. Amen. And I guess that's to be expected, but uh glad we're here. And um just a reminder, Brother Wayne uh Lawson will be with us um the end of the month um uh the 19th through the 21st. And so we're looking forward to a great time in the Lord. And and um I just encourage you uh to spend time in prayer. Amen. And um we you know just uh maybe just a small church, but got needs and um I know we've got those that need the Holy Ghost and I tell you what, I I just believe that God still does them things. He still fills with the Holy Ghost and he still answers prayer. &gt;&gt; He still works miracles. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so we want to be in that right attitude, that right have that uh be in the atmosphere to expect things from God. Ain't that right? Amen. And um and so uh if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to Matthew the 9th chapter first of all. Amen. And Matthew chapter 9. And we're just really thankful for what the Lord has done for Sister Martha. And uh continuing to do for her. Amen. And um doctor was surprised at how um uh much that tumor has shrunk. &gt;&gt; And they were expecting it to be a just shrunk maybe a centimeter. And um it was a uh size of a grapefruit and it's down to the size of a golf ball. &gt;&gt; So it has shrunk a lot. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the surgeon wanted to do surgery right away. And uh or schedule for surgery and uh but uh Sister Marth and brother Tim felt well if it's shrinking then we don't need to do that at this point. and and the uh surgeon says, "Well, what we're worried about is it shrinks too much. We can't find it." Well, I think that would be great. &gt;&gt; And uh that's a uh good thing to worry about, huh? Good thing at least for the doctors. But uh &gt;&gt; uh so we just thank the Lord for uh working on her behalf and just believing that God's just going to take care of that situation. Amen. And um before we go in to the word, may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord and ask him for his help. Father, we come not as beggars, not as strangers, but we come as your children. Father, we realize that we were in you before the foundation of the world. And it's now coming to our knowledge, Father, through revelation, through the message, Lord, that we are your children here on this earth. and that we could come and sit at the table, Father, and eat of everything that you have provided for us. And Father, we're just asking now, Lord, that you would feed us, Lord, and take the words of life, Father. We're hungering for you. We realize our need for you, Father. And Lord, I pray that you would just have your way today. You know the needs that are present, Father, and you know how to meet them. May I just get myself out of the way, Lord, and that you could anoint me and use me, Lord, for your glory and help the people, Lord, to just uh get themselves out of the way, Lord, and pull upon the word. Father, we ask it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. So, we want to look at Matthew the 9th chapter and um we'll start at the 35th verse and read down to the 38th. But it says, "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest. Then if you will look at Matthew the 25th chapter and we'll start at the 14th verse and read a few verses. This is Jesus speaking. He says, "For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to every man according to his several ability. And straightway he took uh and and straightway took his journey. Then he that had received five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had two had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord's money. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh and recketh with them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliverest unto me five talents. Behold, I have gained besides them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of the Lord. He also that received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliverest unto me two talents. Behold, I have gained two other talents besides them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of the Lord. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strolled. And I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth. Lo, there thou hast that is thine. His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant. Thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not s strolled. Thou ought uh therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with us. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath 10 talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he that uh and he shall have abundance, but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and nashing of teeth. Amen. You can have your seats this morning. And I've just got a simple thought today and if I would title it, it would be doing our best for the Lord. Um, there are several scriptures that we could go to today uh that tell us who we are as the church of Christ. And uh and we we do hold a an important position on the earth. uh whether we realize that or not we we do uh for one Jesus says that we are the branch and that he is the vine and which telling us that the vine does not bear fruit. It is the branch that bears fruit. So God does not bear the fruit but he flows his life through us that we would bear the fruit. So, it would tell us that God, well, the prophet tells us God needs us in that we would bear his fruit for him. We're part of this. And also, uh, the Bible tells us that we are the body of Christ. Uh, which God, the Bible says, no man has seen God in any time, for God is a spirit. So then if we are his body just as Jesus was his body on earth uh the Bible says that Jesus was the image of God uh the prophet would say it this way he was the visible image of the invisible God and so today we are the visible image of the invisible God today. So it it tells us that we do have an important uh uh uh place here upon the earth. Uh then the Bible would tell us that we are ambassadors for Christ. So we are the vine that bears fruit. We are the body of Christ, the visible image of God on earth. And we are ambassadors for Christ. So we represent heaven. We represent deity. We represent everything that God is. We represent that on the earth. And which tells us that all heaven is behind us. Everything is behind us because we are the ambassadors. We speak for Christ. We act for Christ. And and uh uh everything about us is for Christ. It's uh because we are the ambassadors. Uh every one of us every one of us are asked to do something for the Lord &gt;&gt; and we have something to do for the kingdom and we are to work in his kingdom for his kingdom. Uh uh there uh this is why the Bible would tell us that we are not our own. we have been bought with the price. Um tells us that that uh uh the Lord is it's it's not just an object of worship but he God go God is not just an object of worship to us but he is our lord which which means that he is our master. He is ruler over us. And that is one of the the things that the prophet tells us that of of the three-fold purpose of God was that God could have preeminence uh in his church. He could have the first place. He could have uh first in everything in in us. Uh that's his desire. But we are to work in his kingdom at his bidding. Um in what he's called us to do. &gt;&gt; Um brother Brandham would tell us God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now say that again because I think that's important. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, think of that. God ordained a time for a rapture, but there had to be a people for that time &gt;&gt; or the rapture couldn't have come. We are that people. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; God has arranged these things. So, now, Brother Brandham goes on, "And as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do, we're paralyzing his program." But when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost, then we're in God's will doing his program. &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "Now God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit." Ain't that amazing? We dependent on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet God is depending on us. So, he's depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit. Now, if he's dependent on you, let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, this is what ministry is all about. And we are called to do something for the Lord. It's doing something. It's it's serving for first of all, we're serving the Lord, but we're also serving people when we serve the Lord. That's that's the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As parents, you're we're not just parents, but we're we're we're parents that we have the responsibility to raise our children and to teach them the way of God. As husbands, we have a responsibility uh uh that God has given us. And you wives uh uh God has given you a responsibility. Preachers have a responsibility. The lay member has the responsibility. Uh God did not call us all to do something at at all all the same thing as as even Paul would say, you know, uh one one planteth uh one waterth and but God giveth the increase. It's it's we we all have have something to do. We all have our part. And and so uh uh Romans 14:8, Paul says, "For whether we live, we live unto the Lord." Ain't that right? Whether we die, we die unto the Lord. So whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's or we belong to the Lord. So we are responsible. We we are responsible for what we do in this life. and the and we're responsible to him. We uh and all of us as as the prophet preached in that uh sermon running from the presence of the Lord and and he starts out uh telling us that we all have to own up to our responsibility. Every one of us have to own up. We we cannot hide um uh behind someone and let them do the work. Whatever God has called us to do, we must do it. And and we will not be responsible for what anybody else does. We're going to be responsible for what we do. You know, in our opening scripture there, uh it talks about the man who had only one talent. Now God didn't give them they all three men were not given the same amount of talents. &gt;&gt; One had five, one had two, one had one. And and they had variety. It it was a variety which Jesus was given the parallel to what the kingdom of God is. And so, um, but because this man only had one talent, he built himself up a complex that, well, I ain't got much to do. It ain't much. And and so instead of taking that and using it like like these others, uh, he hid the talent. And and so uh uh this this this complex see he he saw that he didn't have much to do as the others. He saw he wasn't doing much like the others. He didn't have much gifts and much talents or whatever. And and if we could say it this way maybe well this man didn't I I I ain't got the worldwide ministry like that man does. I I'm not out reaching so many souls like these guys are doing. and and uh you know I I I I don't have it all together like maybe uh this woman does or or uh or or or whatever. See, and and so maybe I'm not uh as talented as someone else in the church or whatever. But but and so he built this complex and then he hides the talent. But see, no matter what, no matter what he thought, it was important to his master, &gt;&gt; his master gave that to him. &gt;&gt; True. and and and so uh uh INSTEAD OF BUILDING THE COMPLEX, INSTEAD OF LOOKING and and feeling inferior to to the others, he should have just used it with everything that he had. See, AND SO WE FIND OUT JESUS IS FOR letting us know that that every man that has been given talents and and gifts is going to have to answer one of these days. &gt;&gt; True. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to answer for what we've done with it. &gt;&gt; We're going to answer on how we did it and what we worked with. And you may not have much to work with, but you work with what you got. and and and he's letting us know that IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO matter how many had this and how many had that. It's just going to matter did you do with what I've given you? What what did you do with that? So he had to answer. Now the Bible says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all your might." &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatsoever thine hand findeth to do, do it with all your mind. In other words, do your best in whatever you do. Can you say amen? Do your best for the Lord. Don't just do it halfway. &gt;&gt; Be your best. right now in in giving us things. God doesn't ask us to try to impersonate someone else. I found that ministers, young ministers especially, &gt;&gt; and it can even get into older ministers, but young ministers, &gt;&gt; uh, they start out and then they're trying to impersonate other ministers that maybe they idolize or that has good ministries or worldwide ministries. And so they they set their goals to be just like that. &gt;&gt; Yes. I've told you, you know, one time before a a young man was, you know, uh he idolized an elder preacher and and uh I mean, he copy him down just to a tea, you know, and so a pastor kept having this young man, you know, to preach for him and and he told someone, he said, "Now, the reason I do that, he says, cuz I can get him for a cheaper price than I could the other man." You know, and he was just making a joke, but he was saying, you know, I ain't get no one different, you I mean, the guy preaches just like him. I mean, to to the tea. I mean, puts his hands just like him and says the exact, you know, words and lingo and all that just like him, you know, so I can get him for a cheaper price. &gt;&gt; But see, that's not what God wants. &gt;&gt; He wants us to be our best in what we are to do. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, so this this isn't competition. We are not to compete. And I I think this is another thing that that that uh uh is is a bad thing about social media is because we get so wrapped up in what everybody else is doing and it looks it looks good. But God never called you mothers. God never called you wives to to to look at someone down the road and say, "Well, I want my my I I want to be just like that. I want my home to be like that. I want my husband like that. And you husbands looking at, well, I want my wife to dress like that and look like that and be like that and and and that that all just causes uh uh uh discontentment. &gt;&gt; There should never be any discontentment in the body of Christ &gt;&gt; because God didn't make us all the same. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, I I think we can learn from others. We can take what people do and say that that's a good thing. You know, maybe maybe you see a woman, you know, in in prayer and or or she's she's consecrated. I think that ought to inspire us to be more consecrated. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You you see a man anointed under his ministry and and and there's an anointing as he's preaching. Well, that that ought to make that ought to inspire all of us preachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. But to try to be like that and try to copy that and and try to, you know, to to hold yourself the way they do it and and and all these things that that that's not the way God's done it. We are to be our best for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are to do our best for the Lord. Not everybody is is has the same build and same makeup and and uh some people like to talk a lot. Some people when they walk in the room, they command the attention. I mean, it's just there. They can't help that. Other people when they come in the room, you don't even know they're there. And and some people, they they they can go out, they got a bright mind. They're just businessminded. Other people aren't businessminded. And and and and some people know how to, you know, they raise their family this way, and others raise their family this way. And and and w women, not all mothers are made the same. Not all husbands are made the same. And and and we all think differently. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, so when it becomes a rat race and and it becomes nothing but competition, you know, uh uh this family competing against this family and and this family trying to keep up with this family and and ALL THESE THINGS THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD INTENDED. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, but but we are to do our best. Now, the prophet said this, "He's deserving of the best you got. &gt;&gt; Not of the best that someone else has, BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOT." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "DON'T GIVE HIM A LITTLE CORNER. GIVE HIM all you've got." WELL, WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT, HE GAVE it to you. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If he's given you the ability to sing, it may not be like a Randy Travis or a Wendell Martin or Donnie Reagan or whatever, BUT IF YOU'VE GOT the ability, YOU'RE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO PREACH. HE MAY HAVE NOT CALLED YOU TO BE A WAYNE LAWSON. HE MAY HAVE NOT CALLED YOU TO BE A A A Terry horn or or whatever, BUT BUT WHATEVER HE'S CALLED YOU TO DO, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THEN HE DESERVES THE BEST THAT YOU'VE GOT AND THE BEST THAT YOU can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another place he says, give your best to give him your best. Give him the best of your life. Give him the best of your songs. Give him all your talent. GIVE HIM EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. GIVE HIM YOUR FEET. GIVE HIM YOUR HANDS. GIVE HIM YOUR EYES. GIVE HIM YOUR MOUTH. GIVE HIM YOUR EARS. GIVE HIM YOUR SOUL. GIVE HIM YOUR HEART. GIVE HIM YOUR PRAISE. GIVE HIM EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. FOR HE'S DESERVING OF THE BEST. HOW many believes he's deserving of the best? &gt;&gt; He's deserving OF THE BEST. DON'T COME TO CHURCH JUST SLOUCHY. DON'T COME AND AND LET YOUR MIND JUST WANDER OFF AND AND LET THE WORLD ENTERTAIN YOU WHILE YOU'RE AT CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE'S DESERVING OF THE BEST THAT YOU GOT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So many times WE WE ALLOW WE GIVE SATAN OUR MIND. DON'T YOU GIVE SATAN YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; WE GIVE SATAN OUR THOUGHTS. WE JUST LET HIM RUN RAMPID WITH OUR MIND. AND AND WE ARE TO CAST DOWN ALL REASONINGS. &gt;&gt; GIVE GOD YOUR THINKING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The Bible says, "Whatsoever things are of good report, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE TRUE, LOVELY, AND OF VIRTUE, FAKE UPON THESE THINGS, &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; GIVE GOD YOUR BEST." We shouldn't do things half-hazard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You brothers, when you go to your job, you do your best. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether you're an an employer or employee, you're working for yourself or you're working for someone else, you're doing your best. Why? Amen. Because you want a good reputation. And and it it would bother you just to do a halfway job, even if it's in your own company. It's something I've admired, you know, working with uh around brother Tim, you know, even even at our church, just doing something at our at our tent and uh uh uh you know, we he in charge of everything. And man, now that guy wants everything right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and I mean, if it's just a little off the bubble, uh we ain't we ain't doing that, you know. And and I appreciate that. I brother Mark, you know, I've when he was behind, you know, doing the sound and all that, how professional that man was, you know, uh uh I mean, everything was clean. Everything was just right. Why? He wanted to do his best. Everything was at his best. I' I've heard, you know, Brother Brother Kevin that uh that he's he's one of the best carpenters around this area because he does it right. He's doing it his best at what he does. You understand what I'm saying? And we all doing our best. We we want to be our best in in everything. Well, then then then if we do that in the natural sense, THEN THEN CHRIST DESERVES THE BEST in everything that we do. You understand what I'm saying? Amen. And this where this is this is where we we we we want to be and AND IS STRIVE TO be the best in everything. and not because it's a pride issue, BUT BECAUSE HE IS deserving of everything that we've got and and we want to do our best. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I um a man said to brother Brandham said, "Brother Brandham, I notice what you do. You put your whole heart into it." I said, ' That's the only way you can do a right kind of a job for the Lord is put everything you've got right to the forefront for Christ. All your strength, all your soul, all your heart, all your mind, everything you've got. You understand what I'm saying? You know, it used to be when I was growing up and and and we we tried when our children were younger is is, you know, when it it come to Saturday nights, we they we get better early. We just didn't do a lot of things on a Saturday night because we were preparing for the service the next morning. You know, we I I remember one man, you know, he just constantly griped about service being too long and too long and and he'd go to the pastor, you know, Wendle, and and he would call him in the office. You preach way too long and all that. And and Wendle finally stopped and said, "I want to ask you something. What do you do on Saturday nights?" The man just stopped, you know, he just hushed up. He said, "When do you go to bed?" He goes, "Well, I get to bed about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning." He said when you can start to you know uh straightening your act on that part. Amen. Then then then we'll talk about the other. But don't come in here trying to control the service because you couldn't control yourself out there. You understand what I'm saying? BUT WE WE WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN AND EVERYTHING WE WANT, BUT WHEN IT comes to the house of God, when it comes to the things of God, we limit God. &gt;&gt; We limit God. Do you understand what I'm saying? We can sit and you know uh uh I was talking to a a man one time. He was getting on to me for uh it's been years ago but been getting on to me for for preaching long you know brother Ram said 45 minutes 45 minutes 45 minutes you know he never read the rest of the quotes you know and and uh uh but I asked him I said well don't do you ever watch a movie? Yeah. I said well do you just sit and watch a 45 minute or or aren't they an hour and a half? Aren't they two hours? Yeah. He said, "But them them are interesting." I thought that's exactly right. You know, it's where your heart is. It's it's the thing THAT THAT YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED. Then we'll put our energy into those things. You understand what I'M SAYING? THAT CHRIST DESERVES THE BEST. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; So, so we find he says, "Now, when you're doing anything, do it right or don't do it at all. Just leave it alone. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A CHRISTIAN. PUT EVERYTHING that you've got to Christ. THAT'S YOUR TIME, YOUR TALENT, YOUR EVERYTHING. Ain't that right? Now, another place he said, "There's nothing too good for Jesus. Give him your best. Give him everything you've got. Your life, your soul, your being, your time, all that you have, give to him." We know the story of Queen Sheba, Queen of Sheba, and how that uh Brother Brand talked about her quite often and and how that she had heard about what God was doing in in in Solomon and and in Israel. And so she lived a a long ways away and and several days journey and and and and she was a heathen. and and and so uh she you know, Brother Brown said she went to her priest and told her she's going I'm going over there and and see well they kicked her out of her church. If you're going to do that, then we're going to kick you out. Amen. But she she said, "BUT BEFORE I GO, I'm going to I'm going to load up my camels and I'm going to give uh bring gifts and and bring gifts of of gold and of silver and of frankincense AND AND ALL OF THESE GIFTS BECAUSE SHE SAYS, "IF IT'S TRUE, IF IT'S REAL, I WANT TO GIVE IT. I WANT TO SUPPORT IT. I WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING FOR THE CAUSE." Ain't that right? Amen. See, and and what she had to go through to get there, the prophet says through the heat and the desert and and robbers and thieves and and everything and to the natural mind, it was insane FOR HER TO TAKE ALL THEM GIFTS THROUGH ALL THAT ROUGH country and and no guarantee that, you know, they wouldn't rob her and eventually kill her or whatever. BUT SHE HEARD THAT GOD WAS IN THE CAMP. SHE HEARD THAT GOD WAS DOING SOMETHING AND SHE LONGED TO SEE GOD MOVE AND AND IF SHE'S GOING to be there, she's going to bring gifts for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother says, "See, if if people only thought that level today instead of putting all of their money on some kind of a dead ritual or creed, you know, that's building million-dollar churches instead of supporting min missionaries and getting the gospel to the people, living God, a resurrected Christ, you'd be a better thinking people. Friend, don't stick your money on something that's nothing but a bunch of fanaticism. Don't support something that's dead and smelling. support Christ, the living God. Put your not not only your money, but your time, your prayers, your efforts, YOUR TALENT, EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT, GIVE IT TO HIM. Can you say amen? See, she says, well, this queen says, you know, I'll laden these uh uh camels uh with myrr and frankincense. I'll lay these laid these laden these camels with gold and silver. And if it is the truth that that living God has a living witness, then I'm going to support it. Can you say amen? Now, God didn't give us things uh for our own glory and our own amusement. I believe it is the desire of every believer to want to further God's kingdom and to work for the Lord. How many wants to work for the Lord? I I do I won't work for the Lord. I don't you know after you read the Bible characters of the Bible and you read of the history of men and women through the ages. I don't want to be one that come up and didn't do nothing for God. hear all their testimonies of them walking with God and doing something for the Lord and and then here I am without a testimony, without anything. And I I just don't want to be that. I I want to do something for God. But see, working for God is not an easy thing. And that's because we are human. God didn't call superhumans. He didn't call robots, mechanics, whatever. &gt;&gt; He called normal human beings to work for him. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so, it's not an easy thing to to work in the kingdom of God. Uh to be honest with you, it's harder today than ever before. Now, life is easier than it has ever been in the sense that we have our cars. We're able to travel faster. We're able to do things more uh at an easier way. Um, you know, and and these things, but yet it's it's harder. It's harder in another sense. For one, we have more demons of unbelief than we ever have before. &gt;&gt; The demonic powers, spirits, as the prophet said, I think in the invasion of the United States, he said, they're pouring in from everywhere. &gt;&gt; The the lid has been lifted, taken off from hell, and demons are just pouring in. It's never been like in this age. So, so then we're we're seeing that it it's not just elderly people. It's not just a preacher. It's not just uh uh middleage. All it's attacking ALL THE WAY DOWN TO you young people. And and we're we're finding that it's it it it's just the warfare is such a span in age groups. Um it it it it's just it's it's really amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But there has never been a time that it wasn't hard to work for the Lord. It's it's just when you look at and you read Hebrews chap 11 and you see what these people had to go through and the choices they made, you really stand in awe because it's not just a story of history when you look at it as that I am a part of this. Do you realize that? Go read Hebrews chapter 11. How that women their bellies were ripped open. They they were sold a sunder like like uh Isaiah just just because he declared the word of the Lord. Just being a servant of God and declaring the word of the Lord. Men misunderstood him. Men didn't believe it. They chased him. history says they chased him and he crawled up in a hollow log and they found him and they stopped up that log and they saw that log of sunder in two and that's how Isaiah the prophet died. GLORIOUS WORDS THAT we read but the suffering that went with it, the rejection that went with doing the work of God. But they were fed to the lions as I believe the Bible says and they saw the sunder and so so many things that they went through and God asked a lot of them. See, he gave them a promise and then he asked them to believe that promise. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? and and and ask them not to let their faith waver in that promise. &gt;&gt; Now, you got to think of that. Their faith was sorely tried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY SPOKE WORDS. THEY MADE DECISIONS. THEY'VE GIVEN A PROMISE THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO HAPPEN. BUT THEY HAD TO RELY UPON GOD. AND WHEN THEY DECLARED THE PROMISE TO other people, it made them feel look stupid and and OUT OF PLACE and ignorant and insane. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE THERE DOING A WORK FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Noah waited. Now you think of it. I'm sure it was a you know, brother Amos, when we have those times, the anointing is upon us, revelation comes and I don't know how it come to Noah. But let's say an angel of the Lord appeared to Noah and what an experience that would have been. We we all think, well, if I could just have an angel to come and live in that presence of an angel and and he just tells me the future. Well, Noah had that. He had that revelation come to him that it was going to rain. It could have been an anointing there. It could have been, oh, just a a great thing. And the inspiration hit Noah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it was just, yes, sir, it's going to rain. God never told him how long it was going to be. God never told him what he was going to have to suffer for that. God never told him nothing. God just gave him the word and and told him to declare it to the people. &gt;&gt; Noah didn't know that it was going to be 120 years before this happened. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Noah didn't know that he was going to be considered a fanatic and laughed at and mocked and scorned for just declaring what the word of the Lord said. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOAH DIDN'T have the angel coming to him on a daily basis. Keep it up, Noah. KEEP IT UP. KEEP IT UP. IT'S GOING TO RAIN. THERE'S TIMES THAT NOAH HAD TO JUST GET OUT BY FAITH and and and feed OFF OF WHAT GOD TOLD HIM. REMEMBER WHAT GOD SAID AT THE BEGINNING. And year after year, DAY AFTER DAY, MONTH AFTER MONTH, HE HAD TO FACE THEM PEOPLE THAT DID NOT BELIEVE HIM, THAT SCORNED AND LAUGHED AT him asking proof. And yet he had no proof except &gt;&gt; Amen. God said it's going to rain. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Abraham waited 25 years for the promise. 25 years. The Hebrew boys, their faith was tried. THEY STOOD THERE AND SAID, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO BOW." &gt;&gt; AND YET GOD DIDN'T COME INSTANTLY AND THEY FEEL THE ANOINTING AND SAY, "OH YES, we're right. We're vindicated." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T COME TO THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY JUST STOOD ON WHAT THEY BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And they were threatened. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they were &gt;&gt; talking about scary. But yet they were there to do the work of God. We're not going to bow. We've been called by God. We're people of God. We're chosen by God. Can you say amen? See, so the faith, this is something that we all uh uh have and will continue to experience as believers. James 1:2, "My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your faith workketh patience." 1 Peter 4:12, "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. But rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, THAT WHEN HIS GLORY SHALL BE REVEALED, you may be glad also with exceeding joy." When is his glory going to be revealed? We We're not told. WE'RE NOT TOLD WHEN the things that that we go through and all of these things, but we know it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "As I have overcome, you shall overcome." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So these men and women, excuse me, of the Bible, they were not superheroes, super or superhuman. Amen. We find that they were normal people that dealt with their fears. They dealt with their complexes. Moses, God chose Moses. He had a stuttering problem. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And then he is called to walk before a king, intelligent king, educated king with a stuttering problem. You would think that God would have sent someone that knew how to articulate the words right and make sure that the message is clear so nobody can misunderstand and nobody say, "What was that again? I didn't understand that." But he called a man with a stuttering problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it caused Moses to have a complex. And Moses began to talk with God. I can't go. I got this problem. Right. &gt;&gt; You find Gideon. God calls Gideon, Amen, to to deliver the children of Israel from the enemy. And yet he had complexes. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He was scared. &gt;&gt; He was &gt;&gt; so much THAT HE HE PUT OUT A FLEECE BEFORE GOD. EVEN AFTER AN angel appeared TO HIM, HE PUTS OUT A FLEECE TO GOD. GOD, now if you really want me to go, then let this this such and such happen. God answered his prayer the next day. That still wasn't satisfactory. So he says, "Okay, I'm going to put out another fleece." So he he he puts out another God, now let it be this way, this way, this way. AND GOD ANSWERED HIS PRAYER. &gt;&gt; SEE, we were human. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at Elijah. When the anointing left him, he ran for his life because he was scared. A woman had threatened to take his life. A PROPHET OF GOD THAT HAD JUST CALLED FIRE DOWN FROM HEAVEN. And when the ANOINTING LEFT HIM, there he stood in his humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But whether Elijah was under the anointing or not, he was still God's prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they all had their issues to deal with. What I liked about Elijah is he didn't run out in the world. He didn't get out to a bar and start drinking. No, his heart was right. He wanted to serve God. He was scared. He he he realized that the anointing didn't take away his humanity, but but GOD WAS ABLE TO come to him. found him hid up in a in a cave and that still small voice began to speak to Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what issues the men and women had, it didn't stop God from using them. So, so I want to tell you today, no matter what issues you have, what complexes, what fears, what weaknesses, whatever, that is no excuse. God can still use you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I've often said, God doesn't use qualified people, but he qualifies those that he chooses &gt;&gt; to use. He qualifies them by giving them his promise and his spirit. Abraham and Sarah were not qualified to have a son, but God gave them the promise &gt;&gt; that qualified them. &gt;&gt; Zachchariah and Eli uh uh Zachcharias and Elizabeth were past childbearing, but God said they would have a son. &gt;&gt; That qualified them. Noah was a farmer, not a builder. But God told him to go and build an ark. And he TOLD NOAH JUST HOW TO BUILD IT. THAT qualified him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Gideon didn't know how to fight a war. AND YET GOD TOLD HIM TO GO AND DELIVER ISRAEL. THAT QUALIFIED HIM. &gt;&gt; TOLD HIM HOW TO DO IT. Shamgard was a a farmer, but the spirit of the Lord came upon him and that qualified him. He wasn't a soldier. He didn't have experience to go defeat the enemy. But with the spirit of the Lord, he he he slew 600 Philistines. That qualified him. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There were times when the enemy was way more in number than Israel. One day the enemy was coming after the children of Israel. And the Bible says that King Jehoshaphat, a righteous man, when he got the news that these uh uh three nations were coming against him. AMEN. THAT FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART. HE FEARED. The Bible says the people feared. Here they were a people of promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND YET IN THEIR HUMANITY, FEAR STRUCK them because they saw the herd of of the enemy and they knew that they were outnumbered. They knew they couldn't do it upon themselves, but they knew they were chosen of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They didn't go and run and hide. They they didn't go and just say, "I give up. I quit." No. The Bible says that Jehoshaphat set himself to seek the Lord. &gt;&gt; He did. Amen. &gt;&gt; And proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord. Even out of all the cities of Judah, they came to seek the Lord. I want to say this morning, and I trust it's a help to you today, but people are afraid to do things because they're afraid they're going to do it wrong. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, don't be like the people at Kadesh Barnea. Kesh Barnea was a testing time for them. God had given them the promise. God had given them the message. But then when they saw the giants in the land, instead of looking at the message and trusting God and walking out by faith, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; unbelief showed up in their heart. The Bible says they had an evil heart of unbelief and they cowered down and they said, "I ain't we ain't doing it. We can't do it." You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to meet challenges in whatever God has called you to do. I don't care if it's just to be a housewife. I don't care if it's just to be a a a husband, a lay member in the church doing something that God has called you to do. You're going to meet challenges. You're going to meet things that are beyond you that humanly you can look at it and say there's no way it can be. And fear will try to grip you. QUESTIONS WILL TRY TO COME TO YOU. COMPLEXES. WELL, I'M NOT JUST I'M I'M NOT GOOD TO DO IT. I I I can't do it good enough. I I I'm not a good singer. I'm not a good mother. I'm not a good wife. I'M NOT A GOOD FATHER. NOT A GOOD HUSBAND. We meet these complexes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We meet these fears that if we're not careful, we'll find ourselves withdrawing and giving up. True. &gt;&gt; But see, you just have to know that God has called you. Check your motive. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I doing it for my glory? Am I doing it to build myself up, or am I doing it because God's called me and I want to do something for God? Right? I know we've all raised children. We got children. That's the normal thing to have children. Everybody's got children just about. Not all, but you know, I'm talking about world. Sinner and Christian. But as a Christian, I want my children to know God. As a Christian, I want to be a godly father. As a Christian, I I WANT TO BE SUCH A AN INFLUENCE in their life. I I WANT TO SEE THEM THRIVE AND THAT IF GOD WOULD EVER TAKE ME OFF THE SCENE, THEY'LL carry it on. &gt;&gt; Serving God. &gt;&gt; My wife feels that way. I believe every one of you do as parents. And because of that, you see more you see the enemy more challenging than it would be if you didn't care. There's parents that just don't care about their children. They they don't care what they watch. They don't care how what friends they hang out with. They don't care. They'll just let them go off. Some of them even adopt them or just leave them off at the porch. But a lot of them just keep them in the house and don't don't don't do nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They don't have no guidelines. And you know, it it's it's tough being a parent and having guidelines for your children. It's tough being being a parent and and and and and not just raising them as though we all know they're going to get big. We all know they're going to grow up, so we just feed them, right? But there's more than just feeding. &gt;&gt; It's teaching them the ways of God. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. But see, every one of these people in the Bible that God used had their failures and mistakes. But one thing that we can say about them is they never quit and they never gave up. &gt;&gt; They never quit and they never gave up. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; James 5:17 says, "Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are." The prophet said he was just apt to make a mistake as you and I as you are or I am. He's just he he's just as apt to do something wrong as you are or I am. Another place he had his ups and downs. He wasn't an angelic being. He was a man. Big old rough looking fella. Hairy body and his hair sticking out like one of these fuzzy worms. his beard out like that and a piece of leather wrapped around his body. If he come up to your house begging, you'd run away from the door perhaps. But beneath that old brown skin be the heart that was true to God. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Brother Brandham talks about that company. You know, Ballard and Ballards fell went over there for a job interview and they asked him to sign his name to the paper and when he went to sign, he didn't have anything. And uh he didn't have an eraser at the end of his pencil. And and and and the man interviewing says, "You have no eraser?" He said, "Well, I don't need it. I don't make mistakes." Mr. Ballard says, "Well, then I can't use you. You ain't going to do nothing." &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I can't use you. You ain't going to do nothing. And and and that's the if you're afraid to make mistakes for God, God can't use you cuz you ain't going to do nothing. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It's easy to look at other people's mistakes. &gt;&gt; But if you're ever going to do something for God, you're going to make mistakes. &gt;&gt; You're going to fail. I I I might be speaking to human superhuman people here, but I don't think so. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; your life is going to have regrets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to feel like a failure. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But see, down beneath all of that, there's a heartbeating true to God. &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER BRAM SAYS, I THINK that's about right. If we don't make mistakes, we're not doing anything. But what I like about a person is that when you make a mistake, a real soldier, everybody say a real soldier. &gt;&gt; Come on. A real soldier. &gt;&gt; A REAL SOLDIER is ready to rise and try again. There used to be a little song we sing, if I fail, there's something or another. Let me rise and try again. Forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. He says, "I have prayed that so much to God that I'm ashamed of myself almost. Let me rise and try again. &gt;&gt; Constantly falling." And each time he's been merciful to help me to come back again. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says now if we just look it over there isn't an hour through the day hardly but what we do something that's wrong. Now he said there's no little ones or big ones there. They're all big ones before God talking about our mistakes and our failures. So if Apostle Paul had to die daily, how much more will we have to die daily? Then I think a person that has done something wrong and is willing to make it right, the real Christian attitude is to forgive that person. And there's where I think brother Graham and the per the church people today miss it so much instead of trying to raise this person back up with just keep shoving them further. Christ when we were the lowest when we were the lowest, he stooped and picked us up. And so that makes it to where we ought to have that kind of spirit too. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another place he says, if you don't make no mistakes, you're not doing nothing. So let's go, brother. Be up and going. Another place God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes. He holds you responsible for your willful sin. He that sins willfully after he has received the knowledge of truth. But a man THAT'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING is going to blunder. &gt;&gt; Amen. True. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; A man that's going to do something, a woman, a boy, GIRL THAT'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING, he's going to blunder. HE'S GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. But if HE'S REALLY DIVINELY CALLED AND GOD IS IN HIS HEART, he'll rise again. &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses had his mistakes and God stayed with him in his mistakes. Prophet said no matter what Moses done, it was Moses's office that God respected. He was a prophet. He was above all the prophets. Another place he says God had commissioned Moses. His failures meant nothing. God knowed his heart. So then when Joshua was commissioned to take the people over into the land, Moses had already gone. But God told Joshua, he says, "Now remember, as I was with Moses, so shall I be with thee." &gt;&gt; Now the prophet, he took that. Now, we might have taken that, well, man, he'll get to see the angel then, and he'll get to do this, and he'll get to be under that anointing and experience the supernatural and all these things. But what the prophet said is that was a consolation to Joshua because Joshua knew that in all of Moses's failures and mistakes, God stayed with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND JOSHUA KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES, BUT GOD SAID, "AS I STOOD WITH MOSES AND HIS, I'LL stay with you and yours." &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said after reading this scripture as I was with Moses, he says we find here that God in spite of all the failure that Moses had done, he still had his hand on him. He called him to go do his service, calling him to his commission. And what a consolation that must have been to Joshua when he heard God say, "As I was with Moses, so I'll be with thee. ALTHOUGH IF I'M TRYING and I fail, God won't leave me. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; OF ALL THE TIMES WE FAIL and trying, God won't leave us. &gt;&gt; I don't have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything. I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And it's true. &gt;&gt; Another place he said, "I'd rather be found making a mistake than crying on the sideline criticizing those who are trying to do something." Anyhow, I'll just be honest. I, you know, you kind of got into the I kind of got in a mood of just feeling just that way of failure. all my mistakes and all that being brought before me and I'm thinking, good night, I probably ought to walk away from even the just being a father, being a a husband, being a a pastor. And it was in them times that Satan was just really working on my mind. See, look what you are. Look what you are. Look what you are. I wasn't even looking for it, but I just opened up the my laptop and these quotes started just coming before me. I'd rather be found a failure and trying than too lazy and not try. Another one, Brother Brham says, "Brother, I'd rather be found on the battlefield making mistakes than to be a criticizer of the man that's trying to get so saved to God." &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And these words became a comfort to me because I realized then that Satan was talking, but God began to talk through the words of a prophet. It ain't time to quit. It's time to keep on going. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Satan may be talking telling you parents that, "Oh, look at me. You know, I just I blew it. I'm a loser and I'm this. I just if I only could have." No, you done your best. You tried. And I say to you young young mothers and fathers, keep trying. Keep trying. Keep trying. Don't give up. Keep trying. You're not failing. You're doing exactly what God called you to do. Raise your children right. It's easy to look at everybody else and criticize them. I've done it. Sad to say, just being honest. But other people have done it to me. Especially when you're raising your kids. Here I am doing my best to raise my kids. And then I found out, you know, my three oldest, you know, that someone says, "Man, I hate dread when they get older. They're going to be Helens." Well, I found out later why he said that. You know, I think it was Daniel or Faith or whatever. You know, they were watching. I had family members watching my kids. They were going Chickaoo chicka poo chickaoo. you know, tell them to do. Well, I don't have to do it, you know. So, when I pick up my children, they left with the impression these little devils. They don't get whipped big hard enough. They don't get corrected hard enough. And I'm thinking, good Lord, I'm doing everything I know to do instead of kill them. That no matter what you do, you're going to have failures. You're going to make mistakes, &gt;&gt; but that's part of the kingdom. It would be easy just to lay it down and just say, you know what? I want to be their friend. I want them to like me. I'm going to like them. I'll give them candy every day of their life. I won't make them eat their okra and their vegetables and whatever they don't want to do, I ain't going to make them do. And and and I'm just I'm just going to we're going to live free love, freefor all, just have a good old time. That's not what God called us to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that would be even in the church. That would be even in anything of our lives. I hope this all right. This morning, I want to just say this. Do not let anyone define who you are as a believer. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. It is easy for people to look at us as human beings and define us. Is it is it is easy for us to look at our mistakes and define our own selves. And if we are not careful, we'll define others by what we see about them. I look at David for example in the Bible. He was a ruddy boy. He didn't look to be a king. He looked everything but a king. Even when the prophet was sent, God told the prophet, "Go down to the house of Jesse. There's a king there. I want you to anoint." He didn't tell him who. Samuel just went. And there was boys, David's brethren, that was older than him. Every time they appear to him, Samuel looked at their appearance and says, "Surely this is the Lord's anointed." And when he got ready to do it, no, God said 8 to one. He went through every one of them. And Sam Samuel the prophet's ex, you know, he's exasperated. He's like, don't don't you have anyone else? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, we got one. But he's the youngest and he's out there with sheep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when David came before that man, that prophet, God says, "This is the man." &gt;&gt; Amen. David didn't look like a slant J a giant slayer, but he was &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By his appearance, he he didn't look like a boy that could kill a lion, but he did. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ONE THAT THAT would destroy a bear, BUT HE DID. HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ONE THAT would be uh his THRONE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER, BUT GOD DID IT. &gt;&gt; He was everything but. But God chose him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So don't let anyone define you as to who you are. There's only one place that we can look to that would define us accurately and that's God's word. That word define means to determine or identify the essential qualities or meaning of &gt;&gt; to discover and set forth the meaning of something. to make a definition and there's only one that describes you and defines you and that's the Bible. Can you say amen? And even though God's word uh uh is what defines us, it took a prophet to look in the scriptures and by REVELATION PULL OUT THE TRUE INTERPRETATION OF WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; This message defines us. Do you believe it? He had a vision of what we are. He said, "A few weeks ago, I was in a vision. I was standing up on a high place, and I was to see the preview of the church. And I noticed I was standing more like this way, facing the west, and coming this way was a lovely bunch of women, really nice dress, long hair fixed nice in the back, sleeves, and skirts down neatly. They were all in a marching tune like onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before. And as they passed, I stood and there was something there. Some spirit was God and said, "There is the bride." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God was uh defining who she was. &gt;&gt; There's the bride. And I looked and my heart was happy. And she went around this way and passed around me. And after a while when she come back like back this way, it said, "Now the modern church will come into preview." And here come the Asian church up and I never seen such a filthy bunch. Here come the other churches up of the different nations and they looked horrible. He said, "I say this because I'm duty bound to tell the truth before God." When he said, "Here comes the church of America now to be previewed. I I I if I ever seen a bunch of devils, it was that." See, them women were straighten naked with old an old gray looking thing like a color of an elephant's hide and they was holding it in front of them with no upper part on it at all. And they were doing this kind of stuff, these dances that these kids do out here and that stuff that twist and stuff and that kind of music going on. And when I seen MissUSA come up, I almost fainted. Now this is thus sayith the Lord. You believe me to be a servant. You believe me now. I wouldn't say that for nothing in the world. There's not enough money in the world to get me to say that if it wasn't true. And when she came by, that was the filthiest looking thing I ever seen. I thought, "God, is hard as preachers and we brethren have labored to get you a bride, and that's the best we could do." She was twisting and holding this in front of her like one of these hoola skirts of a thing and holding it in front of her parts, her lower part like this, dancing, twisting like these kids do out here on these vulgar shows that they have twisting. That was Miss Christianity of America. &gt;&gt; So help me by the help of God. That's what it looks like in his face. I could have fainted. I thought all the trying and the preaching and the persuading every one of them with bobbed hair and they were twisting and carrying on holding this in front. They come around where I was standing there with this supernatural being. I couldn't see him. I'd hear him talking to me was right around me. But when they turned this way, they held this way or hold this. They was just twisting, laughing, carrying on like that, holding this in front of them. Now me standing in his presence there and his servant and of all I tried that's the best I could do. I thought God what good did it do me? What what good did it do? All the crying, the begging, persuading and the great signs and wonders and miracles that you have shown and how I stood there and go home and cry after preaching to them and things. What good did it do me? Then I have to present something like that for you for a bride. And as I stood there looking, she passed on by. And you can imagine the back part of her with nothing on holding this in front of her like she was went shimmying by like that to this twist throwing her limbs out like that. Oh, her. He said, "Oh, it was vulgar how she was carrying on her body shaking like that." You say, "What does it mean, Brother Brandham?" I don't know. I'm just telling you what I seen. And when she passed by like that, I looked at her and I just got real faint and I I just turned around. I thought, "God, I'm condemned. There's no need of me trying anymore. I just might as well quit." He said, "Miss Carl Williams, if you're sitting here, that dream that you told me about," he said, "you had the other night," he said, "the steering wheel is taken from my hand." He said, "And I just thought, you know, I might as well forget it. I was gone. And then all at once, I heard it coming again." And and coming up on this side come the same bride that went around this way. Here come them little ladies again. Each one of them was dressed in their national garb from where they had come from like Switzerland, Germany and so forth. Each one wearing that kind of garb all long hair just exactly like the one at the first. Here they was coming walking. Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war. And when they passed by the preview stand where they we were standing, just all at once, every eye went that way. And they turned back and they went on marching. And just as they started going right up into the skies, this other one went up to the brink of a hill and went down like that. See, they started marching right on up into the sky. And when they went to marching, I noticed a couple of little girls getting in the back. And they looked like might be some foreign girl, Swedish or Switzerland or somewhere. And they started to get look around. I said, "Don't do that. Don't get out of step." And as I screamed, I come to in the vision standing there with my hand out like that. You see, what was he seeing? God was showing him that there is a bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was showing him us. I truly believe that. And even though this bride, this little lady was marching, no doubt she was, she had her problems as we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had had her inferiority complexes, had her weaknesses, had her failures, but she kept marching, &gt;&gt; doing her best for God, staying true to the word, staying true to this message, doing her best. Can you say amen? You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message is what defines us. If the musicians will come, Revelations 22:17 says, "And the spirit and the bride say come." And the prophet of God shows how this happens, how she would have a voice. He says, "In the dark ages, the word was almost entirely lost to the people, but God sent Luther with the word. The Lutheran spoke for God at that time, but they organized." Then again the pure word was lost for organization trends toward dogma and creeds and not simple word. They could no longer speak for God. Then God sent Wesley and he was the voice of the word in his day. The people took his revelation from God become the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation. When the Methodists failed, God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger Malachi 4, right? Under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age. Superhum. No, just common ordinary people that has their ups and downs that has to say, "I'm sorry." That has to ask for forgiveness, that has to ask God for mercy. And yet God chose us for this age to be the final voice to the final age. And it isn't our word. It's a word of authority. That same word that spoke in the beginning, let there be and there was. That word is now being spoken through the bride. She is the final voice to the final age. The prophet said, "The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's its own mouthpiece." So God is turning on her and he will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. It will be in her. Amen. Do you love him? I love him. We look at what the prophet said about the church being a super race, an invincible army. He's trying to define us. He's defining us as who we are. Don't let your problems define you. Don't let your mistakes and your failures. Don't let what people think of you define you. Let God's word define you. Don't let the enemy that looks so much bigger than you define you. Remember what Israel said are as grasshoppers in their sight. Don't let the giant Don't let your problem define you. Let the word of God define you. Do the work. Do the work. Keep pressing on. Don't hold back. Don't get your complexes to where you don't want to do nothing. Well, I get embarrassed. I I just don't like standing before people. But if God has called you to do something, do it. I ain't getting on to anyone. I'm I'm just saying you've got something to do. We could all have excuses of not doing something for God. If if if I let things uh bother me, I wouldn't be standing here today. I don't feel like I should stand here. I don't feel it's not that I broken scriptures or anything. It's just you you know you you're just a man of of of of failure, a man of of whatever. Not a perfect man. But there's one thing about it. The word defines me. Are you with me? The word defines me. We don't feel like coming to church all the time, but we come. We come because we're doing something for God. We got a place for God. We're doing something. God has called us to do something. And we're faithful. And you remember, you remember what Jesus said about them men? Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of the Lord. Can you say amen? Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. I could never ever love. I thought of what brother Wendell had spoke two weeks ago, I guess, now talking about, you know, the the three women that Brother Brandham used as an illustration. Brother Random talking there in the shock shall uh the the seed shall not bear with the shock and other other sermons but he's defining the bride of Christ and he uses the illustration of the three women Hagar Sarah and Mary Hagar represented the Lutherans age Sarah represented Wesleyan age Mary represented the Pentecostals All three of those women were just carriers of life. They were not the seed. They were just carriers. Hagar brought forth Ishmael, a wild son. Sarah brought forth Isaac, the natural seed of promise. Mary brought forth Christ, the royal seed, the word seed of promise. And and as the prophet speaking of these things, he does not define the bride by these women. He doesn't use these women to define the bride. He didn't use Luther to define us. He didn't use Wesley to define us. He didn't he didn't put us in the category of the Pentecostals. He said that was the shock, the the tossel uh the tossel uh stock and and shuck Pentecostals of the shock. He took scriptures that only are applicable to our day and showed us who we are. And we realize this is the day of the revealing of the son of man. We are not another carrier of the word or of the seed. We are the seed. Just as Christ was the seed, the promised seed, so are we the promised seed. Aren't you glad for that? In all of our failures and all of our mistakes and all of our ups and downs and all that, we are the seed. It took a prophet to identify us and say, "There she is. She's on earth. She is him. She's life of his life, power of his power, bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, word of his word. She is him." Hallelujah. He was able to look past everything else and really see the heart and say, "That's what God has chosen for this day to be the final voice." Aren't you glad you're that? I'm so glad. This is seed time. This is bride time. Oh, I want to love till there's just no more love. I can never never out love the Lord. Sing it again. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no end. I can never ever out love the Lord one more time. Oh, I want to live the way God. He wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. I can never ever out love the Lord. In Jesus name we press on. again in Jesus name. We press on in Jesus name we press on dear Lord with the prize clear before our eyes we find the strength to press on. Oh him, can we just stand to our feet and sing it with our heart? We press on. Yeah. In Jesus name we press on dear Lord with the pride clear before our eyes. We find the strength to press on. Is that the way you feel today? Say it again. All in Jesus name. Something pushing us, something urging us on. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus name. Oh, you may be scarred. You may be from the battles and all that, but all the reward will be great. Press on. Don't quit. Keep pressing. Keep praying. Keep that dedication. Keep teaching. Keep preaching. Keep singing. Keep playing the music. Stand in your post of duty. We're going home, church. Going home. I think of what brother Brandham said about that. Caesar, I believe it was. He was looking for a man to ride with him. And he's looking at all these men with shiny shields and shiny swords and their armor was just intact, man. As he was riding down there, I think maybe toward the last he sees an old man or a man that was scarred up, looked looked worn, looked tattered. He stopped and he said, "What what happened to you? Where did you get those scars? What what what happened?" He goes, "I was in service for my Lord. service for my king. Caesar says, "You're the man. I want to ride with me." And brought him up there. And I thought, "That's right. That's what God's looking for. He's not looking for perfect people." And that got got it all lined out and all the ducks lined out in a row. He's just looking for people that are staying faithful, staying true to God and working, pressing, pushing, laboring for the kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing it now with all your heart. All in Jesus name. We press on. Oh, in Jesus name we press on. Dear Lord, win the prize. Hallelujah. We find the strength to press on Lord. Oh, in Jesus name we press on. Glory in Jesus name we press on dear Lord with the bright clear before our eyes. We find the strength. Oh yes, we find the strength. Are you finding strength? We find the strength to press as they just continue to play. God bless you is our prayer. Soldiers of the cross. You are an amazing group of people. You are a people that God is qualified to endure to the end. May your faith be strong. May you stand strong in his grace. Amen. want to remember those that weren't able to make it today and keep Sister Kim Weeks in your prayer. Let the world help her get over that soreness and uh thank thank the Lord that she didn't mess that knee up and u keep Sister Martha in our prayer. God want to just continue doing a work in her life. Sister Rhonda in our prayers. She's facing the things in her body and challenges there. And uh love you, appreciate you, and may God with you is my prayer. Let's just bow our heads before our Lord. Brother John, do you want to dismiss in prayer? Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we appreciate you for protecting us this morning, letting us giving us the opportunity
