that I I I the Lord has given me a part in the kingdom of God and I don't ever have a desire to pull anyone to me because I have nothing to offer but if I can offer Jesus Christ and if I can make we're living in a wonderful hour a wonderful day and I believe that amen here real soon we're going home to our rewards if you have your scriptures let's look here in the Book of Ecclesiastes the 3D chapter and if you wouldn't mind giving me a little bit more on this is a familiar passage of scripture amen thank you brother and we want to to look here at Ecclesiastes 3 And1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace a time to Cast Away a time to Ren a time to seow a time to keep silence a time to speak A Time To Love love and a time to hate a time of War a time of Peace what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons in his time amen I want to minister tonight on the appointed time I would also like for us to turn just real quickly to uh uh Revelations 10 amen this a familiar passage of scripture amen and then we'll let you have your seats Revelations 10 and one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now Revelations 5 lets us know there was a time of this Mighty Angel which was Christ the angel of the Covenant there would be a little book open so there's an appointed time and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw upon stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things therein are in the earth the things that therein are but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel now this is an appointed time he's given us a little time piece here when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is oer and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take it and eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and I soon as I eaten it my belly was in tongues and Kings thank you for your patience let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your love we thank you Lord for this wonderful meeting in the presence of the Lord that we have felt and the wonderful songs of Zion that have been sung and I pray Lord that have laid upon my heart I pray father that you would anoint me Lord to speak only as you would have to speak that you would anoint all of the ears to hear as you want them to hear father we love you and we thank you and we give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church the appointed time I I think finding our place in scripture is a must in order to have a resting place for Faith you have got to know where you are in scripture you have got to know what is required from you in scripture you've got to know amen that there's no way that faith can ever stand solid unless there is amen a a solid foundation because we are not amen salvation does not come from the bottomless pit salvation comes from a well-founded faith in the word of God Amen we're not based on Theory we're not God Amen and too many too many times we go from camp meeting to camp meeting meeting we go from preacher to preacher amen we we we get a a special feeling amen we we we we get something amen sometimes we're looking for something to know that we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost or we with those things thank God for C meetings thank God for the gifts and thank God for the uh one and and even preachers thank God for the preacher but our faith is not Reliant upon the preacher our faith is Reliant upon thus saith the Lord the Vindicated word for this hour amen and there there is a position of the believer that can only be found through the word of God Amen now amen the we we do not rely on gifts we don't rely on gifted men I I Amen brother sea mentioned we came from uh Pentecost and we uh uh we I could tell you a few stories on Amen uh uh upon go back to that again you know when I came into the message of the hour I found that God had a very specific word for me and this specific word amen is something that no devil no trial no emotion no anything can take me from can you say amen amen and so through a Vindicated Prophet that has come in this generation we can stand clearly and identify and be able to see amen the the times that God has has placed upon the church amen not not every generation not every Church age knew what they were but it was in this generation that God came with a specific anointing place you in this book because it was going to be needed it was going to be it had to be something amen this is the ending up of all things can you say Amen now the three-fold purpose amen of Christ would be summed up in in this one phrase amen bringing many sons unto glory amen the promises of God now I want you to look at this because the promises of God in the scripture are on condition amen the there is a certain timing there is a certain season that that must be right Amen in other words you could not expect God Amen to send a Rapture in the second Church age or the fourth Church age there has to be the specific time a specific season for that time and for that message can you say Amen now the prophet would tell us there are three things that we must be we we must not do you must not misinterpret the scripture you must not misplace the scripture they are because only then will you be able to tell time well glory to God Amen now I just want to let you know right now God's got a master plan God's God an eternal purpose amen and he has been working this plan for the last 6,000 years he has been prophets did not realize amen that they were bringing Stone upon Stone they were were bringing the Lord Jesus Christ the perfect Redeemer to the Earth amen and all of the offerings and all of the sacrifices and all of the temple and the priesthood all of these things were adding up to and Christ would come in a body oh blessed be the name of the Lord they did not know what was going on Hallelujah but I want to tell you amen when it came there was the elect that knew what God was doing man now he sets the times and then he works everything to that time the cogs of God's prophetic will they grind very slowly but they grind very surely to Abraham amen he told him he says at the appointed time you're going to have the child can you say m Christ came at the fullness at a specific time let me tell you here tonight you're not here by accident you're here at a specific time for a specific purpose you're here to fulfill a specific portion of the scripture I let Once you turn to your neighbor and tell them you're here with a purpose hallelujah amen now when God sets those times when God sets those times it would be it would be sin for you not to follow those Seasons Hallelujah the scripture says that the Israelite would be totally cut off from the people if he did not bring the offering in of the Lord in his appointed season and that that man would bear his sin so if you did not recognize the season and you did not worship in that season then then you would have to bear the reproach of your sin because God sets the seasons and he expects you he expects you to honor his word in that [Applause] season amen now identifying those seasons are so his plan season and the time strike zero then you can recognize God in his word because it is living before you in your presence well praise the Lord Brother Brandon in our life God sets times and time limits and then it works all to that time he says many of them before the coming of the Lord Jesus they were there uh they were many thought false things raised up that said this is the Messiah and many false things taking place according to scripture just before the coming of the Lord and people tried to do it within themselves they tried to make God's word fit in their program but you've got to do it vice versa amen you've you've got to fit in God's program now there's too many times amen there's been too many times that that we're trying to get God's program to fit in our program there ain't none of your praying there ain't none of your trying is going to make God's word do something different than what he's already predestinated so you know what God is looking for God's looking for a people that is going to identify what God is doing place them through and vindicate his word through you well glory to God because God's got an appointed [Applause] time can you say Amen now so we must carefully follow the scripture do you realize that that you're not going to find that in the first church of Pentecost or the First Church of the Nazarene or the first church of the Baptist you're going to find that in the prophetic will by the prophetic word coming through a prophet that was ordained for the this generation can you say Amen now God would give us types he would give us the four stages of the wheat plant and as a type of the church amen coming out of the Dark Ages amen one of the Mysteries that were to be unveiled was the mystery of the church that the church has been a mystery for seven Church ages Hallelujah and then we would find that there would be a blade and a tassel and a Shu amen that would bring back the seed the original seed that went into the ground at the beginning would come out can you say amen and declare what it was now we don't want to remain back in the in the blade we don't want to remain black in the in the tassel if the life of God is in the shock we don't want to go back to tassel and when the life of God is in the seed we sure don't want to go back to the shack because there is life in the seed I remember as a Pentecostal amen we would we would get the music and amen I call it Voodoo today amen playing and the beat to going and amen before you know it the the people that came in just I running all over the church and doing whatever and yaking and talking and amen before you know it everyone's sort of getting in the spirit of the voodoo you know and before you know it amen someone gets out and starts dancing and amen and and and and if you needed some help amen our our pastor come that was the kind of of worship that was the kind of and we called that a move of God we called emotions a move of God can you say Amen but what I found out is when the emotion was done I had nothing left in my heart I was still searching in my heart but when the Vindicated word comes along I can still do a little bit of jigging sometimes I can still feel like shouting sometimes but when the shouting is over I've got the power and the praise of God why because the word is Vindicated in me alar and you gave your life to God and you repented of your sin was that real amen but then the Lord begin to move on you and begin to say listen amen those movies you're watching is wrong and amen some of that stuff that you're doing is wrong and amen sanctification begin to work in your life what was it it was God coming on up it was the Holy Spirit dealing with you bringing you into a Sanctified life convicting you of sin telling you I don't want to live in that kind of a vessel that's right glory to God hallelujah I remember brother Sean's motherin-law sister Rebecca's mother was man she was a a rough lady amen and I and I I always thought that if the serpent seed had a picture Hallelujah now brother window don't give up on Mama got to keep on praying for Mama your prayer amen I and but I'm here to tell you she prayed and she prayed and she prayed amen one time when the presence of the Lord Brother Shawn and her was listening

phone call and it's her mother out in the parking lot there in Oklahoma amen and she's as blind as can be and she says she said Becky honey I you got see just just lost blind she says what's going on mother I'm blind I'm in the parking lot can't see where to go but Rebecca I just got this something in my heart I'm as lost as lost can be this is a religious girl amen she says I'm lost as lost can

the Holy Ghost and she says and Sean well maybe we need to talk and about that time no matter what they said no matter when it was said the woman would pick up a phone and say I I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh I need Hallelujah and just a screaming and a crying and a balling amen I'm here to tell you there is a season I sort of got ahead of myself here but I'm here there is a season for the sons of God can you say Amen every time so she needed more and more and more of God it's not a one-time fix God's got a purpose for you being here God's got a purpose for you being under this tent tonight God's got a purpose for you being in this generation God's looking for spoken word Believers now God's moving so we know that the the man the leaf the blade of grass the blade that came up that was justification the tassel sanctification the shut coming on up looking more like the wheat that went in the ground it's the Pentecostal the baptism of the gifts but then it had to come the prophet would put it this way justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the Harnet word it made way for a Son of God deputized by God to come complete his work here on Earth this is where we are today can you say Amen now he says God's got a time for all these things he's got a time we plant corn we got a time that we plow corn then at the time we harvest corn spring rains come Dro through the summer fall rain snows you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow and go out and harvest it God has time for season he has seasons for his word praise the Lord want wi at the end time he says now the Sun comes across and ripens the grain now it cannot ripen it all at once it goes on maturing constantly ripens until it comes to a full year so it is to the church today with the church started out in his infancy in the Dark Ages where it went under the ground and it's grow now into maturity and we can see it perfectly how that through God through nature always can you say Amen now now just as we in our individual walks we go through San justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost we grow into that word so has it been throughout these Church ages they came out of the the Catholic system and came out with gesture by faith and Wesley comes with sanctification you got to live a Sanctified life 1906 power of the Holy Ghost fell down right there on isusa Street now there might been a little bit of voodoo in our worship but I don't believe there was any Voodoo in that worship you know why because God was in 1906 filling them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they would come in within a couple of blocks of of a Zeus Street and they season what God said that he was going to do it was it but God couldn't Harvest God couldn't Harvest that plant because though am I too Elementary for you thou it was look so close to the seed though it looks so close man I wish I'd brought my pictures I've got some pictures back at home amen of when they of of when they uh uh uh when they separate the Shu from the seed the shocks look so close to the seed life was in the shock but but I'm going to tell you God did not save me to be a tongue talking [Applause] Pentecostal God did not save me to be a a Justified church member he didn't saved me to be a Sanctified church member he those Seasons had their time but God had a purpose for me being here I am his son can you say Amen while I'm thankful for what I had back there that was not what God's intended purpose for me [Applause] was God sent a prophet God raised him up and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit was so real and he went around the world and it was the Pentecostals that took him around the world and sing the gift of God in his life and Buddy the manifestations of God were so Supernatural we're talking about people that did not have any eyes no eyeballs no no no no nothing no socket there was nothing there and when they begin to when when when he came up for prayer amen when she came up for prayer then brother Ram was starting to pray and then he asked he asked I'm sorry sweetheart I didn't ask you she says give me blue I've never seen blue but I'll take blue eyes come on now and God gave her blue eyes there was a vind come on Church the Vindication was real indication was right the Holy Ghost was there we seen the first and second amen but there had to come a time where the shock was going to abort the word there had to come a time to where the shock separated itself from the word from the [Applause] seed 1957 brother BR begin to start teaching amen and these things started and all of a sudden this one started pulling [Applause] back the season the season somebody say the season the CH was changing it was going from The Shack into the seed now there were a lot of Pentecostals out there am I going too slow am I all right there was a lot of Pentecostals out there that were that were wanting amen the the gifts and they loved the gifts and they amen and there was a lot of impersonations that were going forth but when brother brandham came in and the Vindication of God be through that Prophet begin to discern the changing of Time series he says listen you're all speaking in tongues you're all prophesying you're all doing wonderful things but this ain't it they were going whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you talking about this ain't in he said God's wanting to adopt his church God's wanting to place his sons Over The Inheritance what what was taking place all of a sudden those Pentecostals that were genuine Pentecostals at the beginning the power of God was there they begin to pull back what were [Applause] they well come on Church you know why because it was a changing of [Applause] Seasons it was God and just to prove just to prove that that that wasn't the original that went into the ground they denominated fighting over this and fighting over that and fighting they ended up baptizing three times forward three times backwards they were doing all everything was just going before you knew it the Pentecostal move was just as denominated as every other denomination and they begin to pull away brother brandom explains it really good in ad do in in in indictment he says now is in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb the natural lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there is a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning doing the very thing there that they had to do that's right God be blessed for sing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization and religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word from then on comes the word and the word only and from that Old pasal lamb passed away and Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed in the stad of the word that's the day that the word come into full effect and that's just been [Applause] recently it took a prophet it took a prophet to deserve it took a prophet to tell you whoa It's a changing of Seasons am I is it are yall are y'all catching me because there has to be somebody prepared to walk in the authority of that word and emotions will never do it and I'm one of the most emotional guys there is in the country I'm an emotional guy I wear my feelings on my sleeve amen I love to feel good I love to smile I love to can pretty well tell what I'm thinking amen that's just the way that I'm built but I want to tell you right now emotions will take you on a roller coaster it'll take you up it'll take you down it'll take you in it'll take you out but there's only one secure thing for the blood of Jesus Christ the sons of God have been given an open book it's a book of authority it's a book of placing it's a book of position it's a come on Church it is God placing you over the adversary of your [Applause] life when we talk about the word coming the word age the J this is more than a saying this is you the word coming into your rightful place you say be easy calling people the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and you were chosen in him so here we stand in the grand scheme of redemption as it has come in the full picture today the present Earth is in its seven for the 6,000th year or the sixth day the seventh day is fast approach ing the seventh day will be the Millennium of the Thousand-Year reign with Christ and we are in the season of the dispensation of the fullness of times brother Brenham would put it this way he said do you believe in dispensations the Bible said so in the dispensation of the fullness of time of John the Baptist there was a dispensation of Christ there was a dispensation of church organization there's a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and now's the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting and groaning when the fullness of times come when the dispensation of the fullness of time what the fullness of the time what is the fullness of time it's when the dead Rises when the sensation of time someone shout hallelujah hallelujah we're in the dispensation to where we're going to walk out of these B IES into brand new bodies the full adoption is a full adoption where I'm not going to have to worry about dieting and then gaining weight and Ding and gaining weight not going to have to worry about my about my head and being covered and all of those kinds of things amen I have been promised what the church has been looking for through the first age second third fourth fifth six fullness of time to where the full adoption is to take place in these mortal [Applause] bodies some of you is not impressed yet you are in the season of adoption [Music] yeah come on and it's because you are in that season come on that God has sent his word to bring you [Applause] up some people say you can't say bright age no more brother brandom did where do you think I got it from word age huh well you're trying to say there's an eighth age there is no there is no kindergartener in the message that would call the bride age the eighth age I've never said it I've never heard I've never met anybody that believe [Applause] that but brother Bram wanted you to know what [Applause] season where is in the leoy and church age but don't identify yourselves with that Pentecostal group this is the Bri age this is the word age this is the adoption age this is the preparation for the rapture [Applause] now now now now brother W now now brother w i you're you're messing with my theology did the way brother brandom taught it he taught it pretty simple he taught it pretty [Applause] plainly I am being separated yes sir like Abraham was being separated from lot lot Was preparing for tribulation Abraham Was preparing for body change Abraham had something in his soul he was waiting for the promise to be made flesh glory to God [Applause] God don't put me down there in [Applause] lot it was in the here's another season as it was how are you going to identify the season as it was in the days of lot when they were buying and selling marrying and divorcing for giving in marriage brother bam says that Shack it up as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the bright age so shall it be when God is going to come down in flesh and separate you back I just feel like shouting right now I I came up here not feeling too very good but I'm feeling pretty good about right now the power of the holy spirit is here to vindicate his word in you I'm glad I'm Justified I'm glad I'm Sanctified I'm glad I speak in tongues but I'm so glad for the Vindicated word of M 4 that has given me something to shout about to redevil the season of the manifestation of the sons of God is in this day [Applause] it's our season somebody tell your neighbor it's your season what's your season full [Applause] adoption and while the full adoption within this message what is the full adoption it's when this this old frail body of Decay sin and torment mind battles that's when this thing is fixing to let go of my soul and Buddy you think that I'm a little Pentecostal right now you wait till I get rid of this body you wait till I right now I'm panting oh but when I get into that new body I'm going to Rejoice with joy unspeakable because the word has been made real in me it will be a season of sunship now what is season what is this season of adoption Sons Coming of Age Sons ain't little Pentecostal babies no more Sons not giving the preacher a hard time anymore Sons not flirting with the girl instead of loving on your that's coming into that word more God give me the reality can you say Amen now some people say it's Deeds they want to put adoption as if it's a bunch of legalism brother Bron says I don't condemn the good works I don't condemn their hospitals and good things they do I think it's wonderful God's blessing to poor suffering Humanity I don't condemn all those things those other the things they're doing fine just fine they're great organizations and millions of dollars I'd sure rather see that than bootle joints on the corner anytime I certainly honor them as minister standing in the Pulpit but when it comes to time for gathering together at the end of the dispensation Bunch your neighbor and what is Christ how do we get in him 1 Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ made partakers of every gift and every good thing that he's got is that right and the Earth is groaning crying waiting for the Manifest ations that when Christ and his church will unite together now what makes this so different we've had the moving of the spirit every all through these other Ages come on go back and look at the church age books history says that Christ was there the supernatural was all through that church it's been said that Martin Luther had all nine spiritual gifts while smoking his cigar his pipe he's placing must be in a season then he stops again and says time and season and it must be according to his word it must I don't care how well you say this ought to be and that ought to be and this ought to be it's got to be according to his word be given accordingly praise the Lord because you are not here to fill up another church age you are not here to build up another kingdom you are here to raise the dead of the past Seven [Applause] Ages amen Sons the book was closed in the age of the fullness of time in the age then God sends a prophet opens time for you to stand in the position that I've been or that I've ordained for Adam the season is calling for matured [Applause] Sons that's right and since the season was calling for it there had to be an answer and since God is behind the grand scheme of things and he created the hunger he's also got to invented are you hearing me there there's a brother in our church he he invented a he invented a a a Saul he's a he he's a he's on it and so amen you can saw right inside you can saw right inside the the office or in in the house or whatever and no dust is going to escape that and so he he went over to the is a world that is in need in this evil World demons are everywhere evil is everywhere if there was ever a time for Sons and Daughters to come to their position this is the Seasons denomination says I've got it didn't have it Baptist says we've got it didn't have it that great man says I've got it didn't have it it wasn't the season but now The Season's here now they're Sons and Daughters of God here on the earth they've got the authority can you say Amen do you love him now God built you I'm I'm closing amen is this okay here tonight what was that adoption about gave him his name this is not done in a corner somewhere this is for all to see this is the day that he was going to place his son his air now before that day as long as that son was a child he differed nothing he was had no Authority he had no had nothing there to there was nothing there about him he was still a son I let let me just let me just put this right here what I have found is in all the wonderful and what I have what I have partook of what I have experienced there is nothing that is any more settling than Vindicated word the gifts have been throughout all of the ages the gifts have been that the gifts the gifts have been here and the prophet have told us that whether whether it be prophecy or whether it be knowledge or whether it be any of these things the prophet Paul says they will cease but there's one thing that'll last and endure forever and that's what has been given pastor's door of his office just begging God to give me a word now he wouldn't know it I'd be out there in the in the daytime at my at at at at my pastor's office in Pentecost and you know what God would move upon that Pastor he wouldn't know I was I was I was back I was to me was that real you better believe it was real come on but the next week I was backed down in the Molly grubs I was backed down [Applause] why hear me Church are you hearing me but when the message come when the power of the word come when that something come and settled my heart Hallelujah as we wind down here tonight I've preached too much and not not not got to where I wanted to get to but when God or when when a son that was that was the father initiating the son into manhood that's that's the time every one of us need to initiate our sons into man man hood matter of fact that's the reason why we've got so many wimy [Applause] males because the sons have never been initiated into manhood by their father it is the Father's responsibility to initiate his boy into manhood amen now I I I looked there at Adam and though Adam didn't really have to grow he was born in Perfection or created in Perfection no doubt when he looked into his father's eyes and he sees the sheer Delight re radiating from father and his father says you're my son purpose and call and maybe Gabriel looks up to father and says you know he looks like you and oh look at him he has your eyes and Adam is coming to grips with the fact that God is his father that the Creator is his father that he was created as God takes him through the garden and maybe the father shows him around the galaxies amen but there come a day when God comes to Adam and God initiates him and he begins to tell him you're blessed I want you to be fruitful and I want you to multiply and I want you to replenish and I want you to subdue the Earth and I want you to have dominion I want you to have authority Adam is no longer just seeing God as some something big Adam is seeing himself as the very one that he is adoring God is telling Adam I'm giving you Dominion I'm giving you Authority I'm calling you I'm placing you over the kingdom can you say Amen what was Mount Sunset it was God giving a book to his sons this wasn't done in secret this wasn't done but he he had Life Magazine take a picture and put it in there he had look and he and he had everyone all asking questions about but his sons knew what God was saying God told that Prophet go back to Jeffersonville it's time for the opening of the seals come on God was going to show them that it was going to be a sword in the hand that was going to be a place of authority we are not vagabonds we are not Misfits we are [Applause] Sons turn to your neighbor and say you're a son maybe you need to say you're a daughter on somebody else you are Sons and Daughters Kingdom Authority has been given to you the message has equipped you slaying my Devils I'll kill him myself I don't need somebody else getting victory for me I'm going to stand with authority I'm going to chase Devils I'm going to be a serpent Bruiser I can no longer look at God like I once did far out [Applause] there when God looked at Adam and said Adam I here your you're looking at my majesty and you're looking at my greatness and I've showed you around the galaxies and I've showed you through the garden but Adam you're a little me and what I've done out there you're going to do here you're in control you're in Authority this is your Galaxy this is your Dominion you take authority I'll never forget the day brother Sean says I lost my church over it and I did brother I'm going to tell you right now I sing this message I came right in Hallelujah I just thought everyone would understand it I just got up and preached it and and I told him I said you all you girls had a whole church full of Amen I probably had 50 women in there with pants and shorts and probably had and uh so I came back to the next service and said what are y'all still doing in shorts pants Hallelujah preached on a little while longer and short hair and you know not just just preaching month later I man nothing was happening I just jump I remember I jumped off the coming into this church building with your pants on I would be as [Applause] shame I emptied my church no that ain't nothing to clap about I wasn't clapping I wasn't doing cartwheels man I was I was I was bummed no one understood it no one knew it no one could catch the vision that I come on now I mean these people I've taken them off the streets amen i' got them delivered from from alcohol and drugs and I mean come on me and brother Shawn we worked hard amen I I mean if I was bum brother Shawn was really thinking wow all of my work hallelujah what glory to God but when the Revelation came come on now now I I would I do that again or yeah yeah that was the bad way of doing it huh but Mount Sunset has given me a totally different look of God it's not legalism come on it's not what I do or don't do it's [Music] not what I found at Mount Sunset was the great Eternal God has come to Earth yes and he's not keeping he sent his seventh angel messenger and says you are my sons you are my daughters you have a right to this you have come of age isn't it's the season of authority it's the season of adoption it's the season of a body change it's a season you can now take your rightful place because the season is here the appointed time is here if the musicians would come I I come with notes so close to what brother Wayne was preaching that then Jonathan got up and preached and I had to throw away those notes and I say I'm a cook Goose but this is something that's been been ministering on at our church we're not waiting for authority to come the authority is here come on now I told the Rebecca story I supposed to have told that right now The Time Is Here Josh all through history there's always been gifted men Smith Wigglesworth was one of the greatest men how many's ever read on Smith Wigglesworth one of the greatest Godly men God used him wonderful man throughout our history the anointing would call fall Upon A man the anointing fell upon William brandham but William brandham was not here just as a Gifted Man God can never work outside of a prophet so when God is wanting to give something to his people it has to come through a prophet now God had to vindicate that man through those gifts in his life [Applause] but the prophet wasn't going to keep it to himself now God is inviting every one of you I'm thankful for the gift that brother Jonathan has I'm thankful for the gift that brother Caleb has brother Lloyd has I'm thankful for the gift of Wayne Lawson but the book book has been handed to me [Applause] too I'm thankful for the gift of brother cross I'm thankful for these gifts but the book has been handed to me too Authority's been given to me too you see well Rebecca can I tell you finish telling the story that was brother Sea's first wife when Rebecca called me to baptize her mother and we baptized her and what seen the great moving of God the great Supernatural move of God Rebecca died six months later seven months later Rebecca was one of the most spiritual girls that I knew she used in dreams and a wonderful little lady and her one heart's desire was always I want my mama to be saved right Sean I want my mama to be saved 7 months later Sister Rebecca would die at the age of 30 God used that little lady to speak salvation [Music] gave her her very heart's desire did you know that it was another year how how long little over a year her mother passed away God saved that woman that I said if there was a serpent seed in the dictionary there would be a picture Hallelujah yes sir God made a saint it was in his season Rebecca had been praying all of her life they snuck her to pwn E when she was just a little girl 15 years old to get baptized in Jesus name and she always Prayed For Mama but in the season you say what are you trying to say could it be that Rebecca was created for That season she brought her children to the world she was a faithful mother she was a are you understanding what don't give up don't give up don't lose hope yes sir you've got to fulfill your purpose in this season there's an anointing up here folks I'm trying to get off the platform you cannot give up when it is your season to prevail [Applause] see as Pentecostals if we were handed the open book we'd be trying to empty hospitals we'd be trying to heal everybody and prophesying over everybody and now these sons have been tutored this message has taught us and if my only purpose if my only purpose come on Church the Pentecostals wanted it all that the big the big flash God's looking for sons that he can put confidence [Applause] in that'll stand at your post of Duty regardless of how you feel regardless of what is going on around you
