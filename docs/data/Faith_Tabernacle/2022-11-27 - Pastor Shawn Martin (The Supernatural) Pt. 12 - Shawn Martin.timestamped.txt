[46:56] people of God
[46:58] amen and the book of Ephesians the first
[47:01] chapter
[47:03] and um
[47:06] I want to just start maybe the 15th
[47:09] verse
[47:10] wherefore I also after I heard of your
[47:13] faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto
[47:16] all the saints he's not to give thanks
[47:19] for you
[47:20] making mention of you in my prayer
[47:24] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:26] the father of Glory may give unto you
[47:30] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[47:32] the knowledge of him
[47:34] the eyes of your understanding be
[47:36] enlightened that you may know what is
[47:39] the hope of his calling and what the
[47:41] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[47:43] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[47:46] greatness of his power to us word who
[47:48] believe
[47:49] according to the working of his mighty
[47:52] power
[47:53] which he wrought in Christ when he
[47:55] raised him from the dead
[47:57] and set him at his own right hand in the
[48:01] Heavenly places
[48:03] far above all principality and power and
[48:06] might and Dominion in every name
[48:08] that is named not only in this world but
[48:11] also in that which is to come
[48:14] and hath put all things under his feet
[48:16] and gave him to be the head over all
[48:19] things to the church
[48:21] which is his body the fullness of him
[48:25] everybody say the fullness of him
[48:28] that filleth all in all
[48:31] amen you can have your seats
[48:34] praise the Lord
[48:37] and um
[48:39] we uh
[48:42] want to just again take a little thought
[48:45] on the supernatural
[48:47] and um
[48:49] I have been studying
[48:53] the subject that I'm going to be
[48:56] speaking on for nearly a month or so and
[48:59] I just felt a time to speak on it and
[49:03] the direction
[49:04] and so
[49:06] um
[49:07] uh you know
[49:10] I as your pastor I'm going to take my
[49:13] Liberty and sing what I believe to be
[49:14] the truth
[49:16] and
[49:17] um and what I say will be from the
[49:19] message and so
[49:22] um and of course I it's a it's a long
[49:26] subject day so I'm not going to get my
[49:28] thought complete today
[49:31] but I do ask that you just listen
[49:35] and let me speak to you and
[49:39] um I I again it'll be from the message
[49:43] and because I I believe that's the only
[49:45] way a man can be balanced
[49:48] is not taking someone else's word but to
[49:52] to look at it in in the light of what
[49:56] the prophet has said
[49:58] so we're going to read a lot of quotes
[50:00] because I feel it of necessity
[50:04] and it is important that we know the
[50:07] truth
[50:08] because as the Bible says know the truth
[50:11] and the truth so set you free
[50:14] and we certainly want to remain free I I
[50:18] think the Prophet come with a message to
[50:21] set the bride free
[50:23] and we've heard the the uh The Voice
[50:27] come out of her my people
[50:30] and we have come out I I hope you have
[50:34] and and so therefore we were going to
[50:38] remain out we're going to remain free
[50:41] and so brother Branham said no True
[50:44] Believer is any stronger and spiritually
[50:47] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[50:52] an adherence to the pure word of God
[50:56] as seen by multitudes of examples in the
[50:59] Old Testament and and we can look and
[51:01] say today that we could look and say as
[51:04] well as the New Testament uh uh so your
[51:08] strength your uh um your your your your
[51:12] spiritual healthiness and aliveness uh
[51:18] uh is is as strong as your knowledge
[51:23] and adherence to the word of God and
[51:28] notice he said pure word of God can you
[51:30] say man
[51:32] so last Sunday I had made a statement
[51:36] that there is no difference uh between
[51:40] the church today and I'm I say the True
[51:44] Church of the Living God uh when uh from
[51:48] today
[51:49] uh than it was in the in the first
[51:53] church on the days of in the days of
[51:55] Acts and and that is true there is no
[51:59] difference and yet there is a difference
[52:02] uh uh between us and the church uh back
[52:07] then so today I'm going to deal with the
[52:10] comparison of what we are versus what
[52:15] the the first church is there I'm going
[52:18] to deal with the comparison not the
[52:20] difference and
[52:22] um and so I believe that the the church
[52:26] today is the mightiest force on the
[52:30] Earth today
[52:32] it's the mightiest force uh on Earth I
[52:36] don't I don't care what government power
[52:39] whatever the church is the mightiest
[52:42] force and yet she is the uh the the
[52:45] smallest uh uh entity or or whatever on
[52:50] the Earth today very few minority and uh
[52:55] compared to
[52:56] uh uh uh
[52:59] What uh whatever but
[53:02] um yet God is with her and and so the
[53:06] prophet would tell us that she's a super
[53:08] race and one she realizes who she is and
[53:11] that she can discern uh the the spirits
[53:15] within the framework of the church and
[53:17] she can discern them things then she'll
[53:19] become an invincible Army and I believe
[53:22] that's where the church stands today is
[53:26] because we are Discerning we are
[53:28] recognizing the two Spirits uh that are
[53:32] in the within the framework of the
[53:34] church today and and so uh the church uh
[53:39] is the body of Christ in the
[53:42] Supernatural God dwells in it
[53:45] and uh uh it's not just the body of
[53:48] Christ but it is the bride of Christ
[53:50] it's the only bride of Christ today many
[53:55] many uh uh who claiming to be bride a
[53:59] man of Christ but this bride this church
[54:02] is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[54:05] life of his life power of his power
[54:08] Spirit of his spirit and and then the
[54:11] prophet just finalizes it with she is
[54:13] him she she is him can you say man she
[54:17] is Christ on Earth today you believe
[54:20] that amen she is the body a man that
[54:23] Christ uh uh lives in and she is the
[54:27] fullness of him that dwelleth in all in
[54:31] all so now this church is a
[54:33] predestinated church uh which which
[54:36] means that it is a word church uh the
[54:40] origin of this church is the word of God
[54:44] it's in in in anyone that's part of this
[54:47] church
[54:48] um of course you've got to be born into
[54:50] this church by one Spirit you're
[54:52] baptized into one body therefore you are
[54:56] predestinated you are a word individual
[54:59] a man and and so but before it can be
[55:04] word then it has to be a thought that's
[55:06] what brother Branham talked uh told us
[55:09] and and it had to be a thought first
[55:11] before it could become a a word ain't
[55:14] that right and and and we know that all
[55:18] of God's thoughts everybody say all all
[55:20] not one on the tube and all of God's
[55:23] thoughts are Eternal they're Eternal
[55:26] thoughts ain't that right and so it
[55:29] cannot change because God cannot change
[55:32] God his thoughts are God God is his
[55:36] thoughts it's it's one and the same
[55:38] ain't that right God is Holy that's why
[55:41] his thoughts are holy God is pure that's
[55:44] why his thoughts are pure God is
[55:46] righteous his thoughts are righteous and
[55:48] and and so uh he can't have an evil
[55:52] thought he can't have an impure thought
[55:54] because his thoughts are what he is amen
[55:58] and so he is eternal so his thoughts are
[56:02] Eternal well we know that God cannot
[56:04] change because he is eternal well then
[56:07] his thoughts cannot change because he
[56:10] they they are Eternal well then the
[56:13] thoughts of God are expressed in word
[56:15] form and the word cannot change because
[56:19] it is eternal know ain't that right so
[56:23] in the Eternal God were Eternal thoughts
[56:26] that was expressed into
[56:28] Eternal Word and now it's come into
[56:31] Eternal manifestation that's why you
[56:34] cannot be a Christian today and lost
[56:36] tomorrow amen that you you you were an
[56:40] eternal thought you started as an
[56:43] eternal thought in the mind of God ain't
[56:45] that right now you stand here as a
[56:48] manifestation of them Eternal thoughts
[56:50] that's why the devil can't take you out
[56:52] he can't defeat you he can't destroy you
[56:55] there is a word concerning you and that
[56:59] is an eternal thought ain't that right
[57:02] well so this word and and we could go on
[57:05] and on and about these words that that
[57:08] that make up the church but in Matthew
[57:11] 16 Jesus said Upon This Rock I will
[57:15] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[57:18] cannot Prevail against it do you realize
[57:22] that's that's enough scripture right
[57:24] there to defeat the Devil Anytime
[57:26] Anyplace under any circumstance any
[57:30] condition you name the trial that you're
[57:33] going through and that scripture right
[57:35] there is enough to defeat the Devil if
[57:37] you can really believe it amen because
[57:39] Jesus said I'm going to build my church
[57:41] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[57:44] against it so that was the Eternal God
[57:48] speaking through human lips ain't that
[57:50] right amen uh it wasn't a man building
[57:53] the church it was God promising to build
[57:56] that church and that church was born on
[58:00] the day of Pentecost as we said it
[58:03] started as a seed and remember in Luke 8
[58:06] 11 Jesus said the seed is the word of
[58:09] God and the sower is the is uh the is
[58:14] the one that sold ain't that right so
[58:16] the sower sowed good seed and that good
[58:19] seed is the word word of God Amen well
[58:23] now brother Branham and we've read these
[58:25] quotes but last Sunday but brother
[58:28] Branham said God planted a holy ghost
[58:31] seed on the day of Pentecost he called
[58:34] it that little seed of Pentecost the
[58:37] grain another place he said the grain
[58:39] was planted at Pentecost another place
[58:43] there uh in the Masterpiece God started
[58:46] to build another Masterpiece The
[58:49] Original Seed word ain't that right he
[58:52] goes on to tell us how it took him four
[58:55] thousand years it took God 4 000 years
[58:57] to build a masterpiece and and we know
[59:01] what that Masterpiece was that was Jesus
[59:03] Christ amen and and and and and he says
[59:08] he has taken nearly 2 000 years to build
[59:11] this other Masterpiece a man which is a
[59:14] bride for Christ or the Church of the
[59:17] Living God ain't that right so this is
[59:20] what we are a part of we are a part of
[59:24] what God started in the beginning
[59:28] amen that is our genes that's our
[59:31] inheritance that's that's that's our
[59:33] family tree ain't that right remember
[59:35] the mule the mule don't know who his
[59:38] daddy is he don't know his Beginnings
[59:41] but brother Brown said a pure pedigree
[59:43] does he knows where he started from he
[59:46] knows who his daddy is he knows who his
[59:48] mama is he can go and and so is a
[59:51] pedigree Christian we can take it all
[59:53] the way back to to where God started a
[59:57] man on the day of Pentecost and we can
[59:59] say I'm one of them
[1:00:01] I'm one of them can you say amen that's
[1:00:04] right see so the prophet says at the
[1:00:07] beginning it was Pentecost not an
[1:00:10] organization as I said before the word
[1:00:13] Pentecost is is such a scary word to
[1:00:15] people in this message and I don't
[1:00:18] understand why amen uh uh uh because
[1:00:22] when you think of Pinnacle people think
[1:00:24] of Pentecost they automatically go
[1:00:25] organization organization all the
[1:00:28] nonsense and all of that but as as the
[1:00:31] prophet tells us right here it started
[1:00:34] at Pentecost it was Pentecost not an
[1:00:38] organization but a Pentecostal
[1:00:40] experience that brought the seed of God
[1:00:43] down by the Holy Ghost it made men and
[1:00:47] women speak in tongues and stagger like
[1:00:49] drunk men Spirit operating in the church
[1:00:52] showing signs and wonders can you say
[1:00:56] Amen so that church a man that that at
[1:00:59] the day of Pentecost it started down as
[1:01:02] the original
[1:01:03] the original ain't that right amen so we
[1:01:07] find that this was the only original
[1:01:10] Church original is the only one right so
[1:01:13] it was the only church a man at that
[1:01:16] time on the day of Pentecost there was
[1:01:19] no sex uh uh uh sex uh other churches
[1:01:24] and and other uh uh there was only one
[1:01:27] Lord One Faith one baptism one Doctrine
[1:01:31] can you say Amen it started as the
[1:01:34] original Amen on the day of Pentecost
[1:01:37] amen now notice what brother Branham
[1:01:40] said if the vine ever ports puts forth
[1:01:43] another Branch it'll be the same kind of
[1:01:46] branch that acts was wrote on it'll have
[1:01:50] the same Doctrine everybody say the same
[1:01:52] Doctrine it'll have the same power same
[1:01:56] power it'll show the same signs because
[1:02:00] that's the kind of church that they had
[1:02:02] at the beginning can you say man so
[1:02:06] notice what brother Branham said to the
[1:02:08] people amen back then uh uh in in his
[1:02:12] day uh uh and and and and and and and
[1:02:15] you have to understand that brother
[1:02:17] Branham was speaking to people in his
[1:02:20] day as well as he was to us but but
[1:02:23] don't when you come up to quotes like
[1:02:26] this I personally feel that you cannot
[1:02:29] apply it to people that's already been
[1:02:31] called out so here's what he said today
[1:02:34] since the blood of the uh of the Jesus
[1:02:36] Christ has been shed and you've been
[1:02:39] interbred by all different kinds of
[1:02:42] ideas the holy spirit is here this
[1:02:46] morning to breed you back to the
[1:02:49] original brings you back to Pentecost
[1:02:52] breeds you back can you say man well see
[1:02:56] what was he talking about there had been
[1:02:59] so many ideas and indoctrination and all
[1:03:02] of that a man just like it did on at
[1:03:05] when God planted seeds in the very
[1:03:07] beginning amen and then Satan began to
[1:03:11] hybrid them seeds ain't that right and
[1:03:13] anything hybrid a man is a work of the
[1:03:16] devil ain't that right amen but here we
[1:03:19] find that brother Branham is telling the
[1:03:22] people the holy spirit is here today why
[1:03:25] is he here he's here today to bring you
[1:03:27] back bring you back to the original and
[1:03:30] what was the original Pentecost can you
[1:03:32] say man well I believe there's a people
[1:03:35] already been bred back in this day here
[1:03:39] if not amen then somehow I don't know
[1:03:42] what's going on Amen uh uh but it just
[1:03:45] shows just how few this bride is really
[1:03:48] going to be amen because the Holy Spirit
[1:03:50] has been working the prophet's been off
[1:03:52] the scene for 60 some years amen and if
[1:03:55] the Holy Spirit can't breathe a people
[1:03:57] back now if he hasn't already bred that
[1:04:00] people back now amen then what in the
[1:04:02] world are we going to do can you say man
[1:04:04] when the world is signs and of the time
[1:04:07] Russia is finding her position Israel's
[1:04:09] in her place amen America look where
[1:04:12] she's at homosexuals transgender
[1:04:14] everything is falling in place can you
[1:04:16] say Amen if the Holy Ghost can make them
[1:04:19] fall in their place unconverted heathens
[1:04:22] evil that don't even believe in the name
[1:04:25] of Jesus Christ that would accept
[1:04:27] everything that is ungodly then why
[1:04:30] can't God the Holy Ghost take a holy
[1:04:33] people that he's called out for his name
[1:04:35] and read them back to Pentecost can you
[1:04:38] say Amen well I tell you what he's doing
[1:04:41] it and he has done it he's breeding them
[1:04:44] back and he has bred him back can you
[1:04:46] say amen that's right see now brother
[1:04:49] Branham goes on turn back to the
[1:04:52] original turn back to the Bible get away
[1:04:55] from the organization and denomination
[1:04:57] and go back to the first go back to the
[1:05:00] original Pentecost to the original
[1:05:03] feeling of the Holy Ghost to the
[1:05:05] original Power the word testifies that
[1:05:08] it will happen
[1:05:10] do you understand that now he's he's
[1:05:12] speaking from the word go back why is he
[1:05:15] telling us go back because the word said
[1:05:17] it will happen and this word cannot pass
[1:05:20] away it is an eternal word can you say
[1:05:22] man so when God thought of his church he
[1:05:25] thought of a Pentecostal church when God
[1:05:27] thought of his church he thought of a
[1:05:29] church with power amen with gifts amen
[1:05:33] with the in operation with the
[1:05:35] supernatural God living in that body he
[1:05:38] can speak through them he can talk to
[1:05:40] them he can hear through them he can see
[1:05:43] through them he can act through them he
[1:05:45] can live through them can you say amen
[1:05:48] that's what happened on the day of
[1:05:50] Pentecost and that's what's happening in
[1:05:52] this bride today
[1:05:56] praise the Lord
[1:05:58] now
[1:06:00] he is telling the people go back to the
[1:06:04] original
[1:06:05] which fits now notice what he's telling
[1:06:08] us to go back to he's telling us
[1:06:11] because it fits with the ministry of
[1:06:14] Malachi 4.
[1:06:18] brother Brown says notice the first
[1:06:20] Elijah was to turn the hearts of the
[1:06:23] fathers to the children the old Orthodox
[1:06:26] to the new message was going on that he
[1:06:29] was given
[1:06:30] and then and
[1:06:32] is he says is a conjunction to tie the
[1:06:35] verse together the hearts of the
[1:06:37] children back to the fathers then the
[1:06:39] message of John in the last days or the
[1:06:42] message of Elijah the spirit that will
[1:06:45] be in the church will take the hearts of
[1:06:47] the people that's Fallen away from the
[1:06:49] Pentecostal fathers and turned their
[1:06:52] hearts back to the original message of
[1:06:54] Pentecost again as it started
[1:06:57] can you say man so that's what the
[1:07:00] message is to do that's what brother
[1:07:01] Brown was to do so now we can understand
[1:07:04] why he was calling out to the people
[1:07:06] calling out go back go back to the
[1:07:09] original if he didn't tell us to go back
[1:07:11] to the original he wouldn't have fit
[1:07:13] Malachi 4. you understand what I'm
[1:07:15] saying and any preacher any any parent
[1:07:18] any young person that cannot tell the
[1:07:22] world to go back to Pentecost amen don't
[1:07:25] believe this message you understand what
[1:07:26] I'm saying if we believe this message
[1:07:28] and we're speaking this message it'll be
[1:07:31] us to tell the people go back to
[1:07:33] Pentecost go back don't you take
[1:07:35] intellectualism don't you take just some
[1:07:37] little old whatever amen some idea amen
[1:07:41] don't just sit there and say well I
[1:07:42] believe the word so I'm okay you go back
[1:07:45] to Pentecost and make sure you have an
[1:07:48] experience like they did at Pentecost
[1:07:51] praise the Lord and if we're message
[1:07:54] people we'll Echo that
[1:07:59] go back to the original
[1:08:01] now what is in the seed will always be
[1:08:04] do you believe that
[1:08:10] what is in the seed will always be
[1:08:13] the only way it can change
[1:08:16] if it has been hybrid with something
[1:08:18] else
[1:08:19] ain't that right
[1:08:21] so the only way that a branch can bring
[1:08:24] forth something other than what is in
[1:08:27] the seed is for it to be a grafted
[1:08:29] branch
[1:08:31] so that's what brother Brown was talking
[1:08:32] about
[1:08:33] when he saw the orange trees that had I
[1:08:36] think it was orange trees
[1:08:38] that it had tangelos
[1:08:40] grapefruit
[1:08:42] had something else on there and he said
[1:08:44] well I thought this was a orange tree
[1:08:46] said it is but these gr these have been
[1:08:48] grafted and they're living off the vine
[1:08:51] or the life
[1:08:52] they're living off the life of the tree
[1:08:54] so brother Brown said okay so when it's
[1:08:57] fall and everything falls and the winter
[1:08:59] comes through and then they start
[1:09:01] bringing forth again he said then
[1:09:03] they'll all bring orange orange tree
[1:09:05] orange fruit and he said no no the the
[1:09:08] or the the branch that is tangelo will
[1:09:11] bring forth Angelo the the branch that
[1:09:13] is grapefruit will bring forth
[1:09:14] grapefruit but that when when that tree
[1:09:18] brings forth another Branch it'll be
[1:09:20] orange tree can you say Amen so so we
[1:09:23] find that that the only way that it can
[1:09:26] tell be be messed up is by a grafted
[1:09:30] Branch or a a hybrid seed ain't that
[1:09:33] rhyme so we find that the Church of the
[1:09:36] day of Pentecost was a Pentecostal
[1:09:39] church and brother Brandon said it will
[1:09:41] always be a Pentecostal Church it will
[1:09:45] always be a a Pentecostal church now
[1:09:49] brother Branham in another place he says
[1:09:51] if they would have let the Lutheran
[1:09:53] Church go on and not organize it it
[1:09:56] would have been Pentecostal Satan not
[1:09:58] the denomination I mean the real
[1:10:01] Pentecostal can you say man so then we
[1:10:05] find that anyone that studies the
[1:10:07] message amen knows that the Pentecostal
[1:10:10] age is not the seed it was not the seed
[1:10:15] can you say Amen the Pentecostal age is
[1:10:17] a laodicean age as we know that it was
[1:10:20] not the seed that was planted on the day
[1:10:23] of Pentecost when you use again the word
[1:10:26] Pentecost it seems most people get hung
[1:10:30] there hung up there and and they want to
[1:10:32] tell us that we're beyond that we we're
[1:10:35] beyond that and I will agree that we're
[1:10:37] beyond the Pentecostal age but you'll
[1:10:41] never be beyond the Pentecostal
[1:10:43] experience
[1:10:44] totally different can you say man amen
[1:10:47] totally different see so so we find that
[1:10:50] any branch a man cannot go beyond what
[1:10:55] was started as a seed amen you cannot
[1:10:58] the branch cannot go beyond the sea Amen
[1:11:01] in other words what I'm trying to get to
[1:11:03] now uh uh is the seed let's say the seed
[1:11:06] is an apple seed you plant that seed a
[1:11:09] man in the ground and then the tree
[1:11:11] starts coming up and it starts bringing
[1:11:13] forth up branches and and before you
[1:11:15] know it little apples start coming up on
[1:11:17] there but then you find as it gets
[1:11:20] bigger than them big branches say hold
[1:11:22] it now you know we've been in this a
[1:11:24] long time I I just don't think we need
[1:11:27] to be seen anymore we're Beyond seed so
[1:11:29] we're going to start bringing forth
[1:11:31] other things well you can't do that if
[1:11:34] if you're of the original you cannot
[1:11:37] bring forth something else amen because
[1:11:41] you're tied to the seed you're tied to
[1:11:44] what we in the ground you're tied to
[1:11:46] what was started can you say man so I
[1:11:49] don't care how big the tree is I've got
[1:11:51] a big apple tree at home and that that
[1:11:53] tree is huge that I I can always depend
[1:11:57] on it it'll bring forth apples I don't
[1:11:59] have to question about it because it'll
[1:12:01] never outgrow what started it it'll
[1:12:04] never outgrow what it was in the ground
[1:12:07] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:12:10] well that's the same thing yes we are
[1:12:12] beyond that Pentecostal age amen but we
[1:12:15] still have a start and that was the seed
[1:12:17] amen and that was at Pentecost can you
[1:12:20] say Amen you'll never outgrow Pentecost
[1:12:22] you'll never outgrow a Pentecostal
[1:12:25] experience you'll never outgrow what God
[1:12:28] put in that church
[1:12:30] you just won't
[1:12:33] now Jesus said that he is the root and
[1:12:36] The Offspring
[1:12:37] so how are we going to do that one
[1:12:40] he was the roots of it
[1:12:42] he's The Offspring
[1:12:44] can you say man
[1:12:46] he is the alpha
[1:12:48] he is the Omega
[1:12:50] so now I will tell you this
[1:12:53] that what was in Luther's day
[1:12:55] and what was in Wesley's day and what
[1:12:58] was in the Pentecostal age we still have
[1:13:01] sure
[1:13:03] can you say Amen
[1:13:05] we still have
[1:13:08] then notice what brother Brown says Plus
[1:13:11] everybody say Plus
[1:13:13] Plus
[1:13:16] so now I hope to get more into that
[1:13:19] we're going to get more into this
[1:13:21] in in this subject as as we go
[1:13:24] but I want to mention this right fast
[1:13:27] Luther was a carrier of life
[1:13:30] and that life
[1:13:32] produced what little bit Luther had
[1:13:36] do you believe that a lot of nonsense
[1:13:38] went on
[1:13:39] Luther did not did not reflect the the
[1:13:43] the the the the the the the
[1:13:44] full seed
[1:13:47] because he was only a sprout
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:51] and so we find then that that life that
[1:13:55] Luther had went on up
[1:13:58] in into Wesley
[1:14:00] now when when that done that what
[1:14:03] happened Luther died
[1:14:05] and dried up
[1:14:07] and that's where she stands today
[1:14:09] ain't that right she don't even resemble
[1:14:12] what she had back then in Luther's day
[1:14:16] she is so messed up confused and dead it
[1:14:19] ain't even funny
[1:14:20] the lutherans have become a laughing
[1:14:22] stock it's hard to even believe that God
[1:14:25] used them at one time but God did
[1:14:29] but the life has moved on up now into
[1:14:32] Wesley ain't that right amen and what
[1:14:34] did it produce It produced a a a a
[1:14:37] greater part of life amen loser had a a
[1:14:42] portion of Life Wesley had a greater
[1:14:44] part can you say amen and what Luther
[1:14:47] had Wesley had
[1:14:49] Plus
[1:14:52] ain't that right so we find that that uh
[1:14:55] uh then the life moved up into the
[1:14:58] Pentecostal age a man and and Luther was
[1:15:01] a carrier of the life Wesley was the
[1:15:04] carrier of the life none of them both of
[1:15:06] them did not represent the seed at all
[1:15:08] did not even look like the seed
[1:15:12] it's true so we find that the life goes
[1:15:16] up into that Pentecostal age
[1:15:18] and what happens when the life left
[1:15:21] remember it didn't just give life to the
[1:15:24] Pentecostal age amen but the life
[1:15:27] literally left Wesley
[1:15:29] the life literally left it all
[1:15:32] ain't that right Wesley's dead today the
[1:15:36] Methodist sits dead they're even
[1:15:38] allowing homosexuals in
[1:15:41] that they're so messed up in their
[1:15:43] doctrines and their teeth it's even hard
[1:15:45] to believe that God used the Methodist
[1:15:47] that one time
[1:15:49] what is it the life is gone
[1:15:51] he'll never revive again it'll go off
[1:15:54] under into whatever chaos
[1:15:57] that's right and it has can you say amen
[1:16:00] amen but what happened the life moved up
[1:16:02] in that Pentecostal Age and what Luther
[1:16:05] had the Pentecostals had and what Wesley
[1:16:07] had the Pentecostals had plus can you
[1:16:12] say man now and yet now the prophet says
[1:16:15] now we're getting to look like seed
[1:16:16] again the Pentecostals look like the
[1:16:19] seed and everybody said that seed but it
[1:16:22] wasn't seed can you say Amen think of
[1:16:26] that now why because they had the
[1:16:28] restoration of the gifts they had the
[1:16:30] spirit of God moving you know the
[1:16:32] prophet said that the Holy Ghost spake
[1:16:34] in tongues to them people
[1:16:37] a lot of nonsense yes but there was a
[1:16:40] life there in there that there's so much
[1:16:43] life amen that when the people looked at
[1:16:45] it they thought that that was the seed
[1:16:48] that it wasn't the seed
[1:16:51] then you say amen and now we find out
[1:16:55] that all the life that was in that
[1:16:58] Pentecostal age has been gathered up in
[1:17:01] the seed in seed can you say amen amen
[1:17:04] it's there's no life it in the
[1:17:06] Pentecostal age they are dead they're
[1:17:09] dried up and I'm look at the Pentecost
[1:17:12] today I don't care what you call them
[1:17:13] Apostolic uh uh Assemblies of God
[1:17:17] Oneness or or whatever you want to look
[1:17:20] at today it it is hard to believe that
[1:17:23] God would use a Pentecost a man for a
[1:17:27] Revival
[1:17:28] but he did it
[1:17:31] and and Prophet said just give it a
[1:17:33] little bit more time they'll be worse
[1:17:34] off than the Catholic Church
[1:17:37] and they are
[1:17:41] because they're dead
[1:17:43] can you say man so where do we stand
[1:17:46] what Luther had what Wesley had what
[1:17:50] that Pentecostal age had we now have
[1:17:55] Plus
[1:17:56] can you say Amen plus amen I'm so glad
[1:17:59] that God sent a prophet all the life
[1:18:02] that what Luther had that Wesley had in
[1:18:04] the Pentecostals had all that life is
[1:18:06] now gathered in the seed and now they
[1:18:09] want to tell us we can't speak in
[1:18:10] tongues they want to tell us we can't
[1:18:13] run the aisle amen they want to
[1:18:14] criticize us for our worship amen that
[1:18:17] is nonsense
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:20] the life is in the seed brother
[1:18:25] can you say Amen
[1:18:27] that's where we are look at it we're
[1:18:28] back to the original seed
[1:18:31] ain't that right brother Brown said this
[1:18:34] is seed time
[1:18:38] so the Lutheran age was once a carrier
[1:18:41] of the true word
[1:18:42] justification
[1:18:44] sanctification was once a carrier of the
[1:18:47] word
[1:18:48] sanctification Wesley the Pentecostal
[1:18:51] age became the carrier of the true word
[1:18:55] uh uh restoration of gifts
[1:18:58] but what we're not the carrier
[1:19:03] we're not the carrier
[1:19:05] of life
[1:19:08] we are
[1:19:09] we're the seed
[1:19:12] that's why brother Brown called it not
[1:19:13] just a Revival it's a brad Revival we're
[1:19:16] back to see time again
[1:19:19] aren't you glad for that we're back to
[1:19:21] seed time so we are the original seed
[1:19:25] you believe that well I know you do
[1:19:29] we are that Original Seed
[1:19:32] so now brother Brown said now listen now
[1:19:34] it's seed time or bright time now that's
[1:19:37] where we get the bright age it's bright
[1:19:39] age
[1:19:40] now they want to tell us that there's
[1:19:41] always been a bright age that's a lie
[1:19:44] brother Brown never taught that
[1:19:46] this is bright time now this is sea time
[1:19:49] now
[1:19:50] can you say Amen but what's the
[1:19:52] difference it's Harvest Time
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:19:57] so the shuts are dead Pentecostal shucks
[1:20:01] they're dead the Virgin word time not
[1:20:04] touch it's a virgin remember a virgin
[1:20:07] word time there will be no
[1:20:10] denominational manhandling in the Virgin
[1:20:13] birth of the Bride
[1:20:16] can you say Amen now we've got men that
[1:20:19] has come from the Pentecostal ranks and
[1:20:22] they've come into the messenger drinks
[1:20:25] and they want to bring all their
[1:20:27] nonsense Pentecostal ideas Pentecostal
[1:20:30] nonsense into this message and mix this
[1:20:33] message up with it you cannot let it mix
[1:20:37] or you'll die with it
[1:20:39] can you say man you you'll die you'll
[1:20:42] just be a Pentecostal uh uh uh well
[1:20:46] you'll be a hybrid is one but you'll be
[1:20:48] just like the Pentecost of having to
[1:20:50] work everything up
[1:20:53] can you say man that's right but they
[1:20:56] want to try to mix all this amen but
[1:20:58] also we've got church of Christ we've
[1:21:00] got the Presbyterians we've got the
[1:21:01] Baptists we've got Apostolic legalists
[1:21:04] and we got them all that come into this
[1:21:06] message amen saying oh I've come out but
[1:21:09] then they want to mix their ideas
[1:21:12] they want to mix Church Christ Doctrine
[1:21:14] they want to mix up Presbyterian
[1:21:16] Doctrine Methodist Doctrine Baptist
[1:21:19] Doctrine and all of that with this
[1:21:21] message you can't do that
[1:21:24] can you say Amen
[1:21:27] well that that's true
[1:21:29] look at it they want to hold us in
[1:21:32] bondage
[1:21:33] they want to tell us what kind of music
[1:21:35] we can play
[1:21:36] they want to put us on what kind of
[1:21:38] instruments we can play
[1:21:40] in the church
[1:21:41] people will split hairs
[1:21:44] yeah
[1:21:45] over different kinds of instruments in
[1:21:47] the church
[1:21:51] that tell us what songs we can sing they
[1:21:53] want to control our worship so we don't
[1:21:55] get out of hand they want to tell us
[1:21:57] that the gifts are of no importance to
[1:21:59] us anymore
[1:22:01] you understand what I'm saying you know
[1:22:03] what and I'm going to just be as honest
[1:22:05] as I can it's the same demon that has
[1:22:07] been trying to tell us that there ain't
[1:22:09] no miracles in the church anymore either
[1:22:10] I sit there and talk to a preacher last
[1:22:14] year amen uh in in in another state I'll
[1:22:18] just say it that way and he sat there
[1:22:20] and told me that God doesn't work
[1:22:22] miracles anymore
[1:22:25] sat there and told me that
[1:22:29] so sir you're you're you've come too
[1:22:32] late buddy
[1:22:35] what in the world are you talking about
[1:22:37] you really I mean I've heard brother
[1:22:39] random talk tell these things I never I
[1:22:42] never I never had I never run into one
[1:22:44] but he literally told me that Mark 16 is
[1:22:47] no longer inspired
[1:22:51] that's a circle you look at all these
[1:22:52] young people out here playing
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:55] I said I can tell you everyone that has
[1:22:57] had Miracle after Miracle after miracle
[1:23:00] I said what are you going to give them
[1:23:01] young people in the day that is so evil
[1:23:04] and so perverse what are you going to
[1:23:05] give them a god that is just history
[1:23:07] lesson
[1:23:09] can you say Amen
[1:23:10] that's right see but you know what it's
[1:23:13] the same devil that wants to take the
[1:23:14] blood out of the church
[1:23:16] you know what brother Brown says about
[1:23:17] it amen that that they were trying to
[1:23:20] take the blood of Christ or out of the
[1:23:23] church
[1:23:24] we ain't gonna let them do it are we
[1:23:26] we're not gonna let them take Miracles
[1:23:27] and healings and signs and wonders we're
[1:23:30] not going to let them take the
[1:23:31] supernatural out of the church
[1:23:33] we're already back to seed again
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:39] we're seen
[1:23:41] so the bride of Christ will not fall for
[1:23:43] such nonsense
[1:23:45] why because brother Branham say it again
[1:23:47] there will be no denominational
[1:23:49] manhandling in the Virgin birth of the
[1:23:52] Bride
[1:23:54] now listen Church what are we in third
[1:23:56] pool
[1:23:59] third pool
[1:24:00] you know what brother Brandon worked the
[1:24:02] second and third pool or at first pull
[1:24:04] in the third pull
[1:24:06] but what is the third pull
[1:24:08] the opening of the word
[1:24:11] ain't that right third pool opening of
[1:24:13] the word so what does that mean to us we
[1:24:16] see that the blood is in the word
[1:24:20] it's open to us
[1:24:23] see in the word we see that God set the
[1:24:25] nine spiritual gifts in the New
[1:24:27] Testament Church
[1:24:28] in the word we see it in the word of
[1:24:32] them speaking in tongues and
[1:24:33] interpretation of tongues we see it in
[1:24:36] the word of shouting and dancing and
[1:24:38] glorifying God in the word we see that
[1:24:42] there's laying hands on the sick and
[1:24:43] they shall recover
[1:24:46] can you say Amen
[1:24:48] Miracles are in the word casting out
[1:24:50] Devils is in the word and when that
[1:24:53] third pool came open it opened our eyes
[1:24:56] to where we could see it in the word and
[1:24:58] no man can take it or explain it away
[1:25:00] from us
[1:25:01] because it's opening of the word third
[1:25:04] pull
[1:25:06] ain't that right
[1:25:07] and we see that these things are
[1:25:09] supposed to be
[1:25:11] so we we find do you realize that it's
[1:25:14] under the third pool Ministry that we
[1:25:16] find that the only thing the word can
[1:25:18] produce is screaming hollering
[1:25:21] blabbering Acts 2 38 tongue-speaking
[1:25:23] people
[1:25:24] can you say Amen under the word under
[1:25:27] the opening of the word third pull amen
[1:25:30] that's what the prophet was telling us
[1:25:31] now he's letting us know he said there's
[1:25:34] one thing you'll never find in the word
[1:25:35] and that's a painted face
[1:25:38] bobbed hair woman
[1:25:40] can you say man that's right see
[1:25:43] intellectual Church John and Creed going
[1:25:45] amen Bob pair a painted face you'll not
[1:25:48] her find that in the word
[1:25:51] ain't that right
[1:25:54] see but we find that the church natural
[1:25:57] the prophet says things set them
[1:25:58] blabbering hollering scream in Acts 2 38
[1:26:01] tongue talking people she thinks they're
[1:26:03] miserable creatures
[1:26:05] and the prophet said she don't want to
[1:26:07] be impregnated with the word because
[1:26:09] that's the only kind the word can bring
[1:26:10] forth born of the spirit of God it has
[1:26:14] the spirit of God in it can you say Amen
[1:26:19] so we find
[1:26:22] that if the word is truly open to an
[1:26:24] individual they'll see it
[1:26:26] they'll sit in the word
[1:26:28] then they won't talk about and make fun
[1:26:30] of people amen getting a holy ghost
[1:26:32] slobbering
[1:26:33] it's not swinging
[1:26:36] I don't know amen
[1:26:39] can you say Amen
[1:26:40] it's true
[1:26:42] now I realize
[1:26:45] as we said and and we'll talk more about
[1:26:47] it as we go
[1:26:49] we've seen so much fake
[1:26:51] so much impersonations
[1:26:55] ain't that right
[1:26:56] or actually you wonder what is real
[1:27:02] I remember
[1:27:03] we've been in Pentecost we saw a lot of
[1:27:05] nonsense
[1:27:07] that when we come into the message we
[1:27:09] shut it all down
[1:27:10] shut it everything down
[1:27:13] because we had so much nonsense
[1:27:18] that we just shut it down
[1:27:20] but then we realized
[1:27:25] as the prophet began to teach us
[1:27:28] if there's a middle of the road
[1:27:31] and that just because there's
[1:27:33] impersonations don't mean that
[1:27:34] everything's impersonation
[1:27:37] and I want to tell you just because you
[1:27:39] see Hypocrites in a church don't mean
[1:27:40] that there ain't bride
[1:27:42] so don't fall apart
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:45] can you say man
[1:27:47] don't don't fall apart when you see
[1:27:48] troubles in the church and when you see
[1:27:50] just nonsense going on and and you see
[1:27:53] people just so worldly bound and and and
[1:27:55] and this and you see all these
[1:27:56] Hypocrites and all of that amen and and
[1:27:59] believe me there's probably more
[1:28:01] Hypocrites than there are the genuine
[1:28:02] but that doesn't take away genuine
[1:28:05] then you say man
[1:28:08] that's right there's more people going
[1:28:10] in the world Council of churches than
[1:28:12] there are in this Rapture that don't
[1:28:13] mean that there ain't going to be a
[1:28:15] rapture
[1:28:16] didn't you say man there's more people
[1:28:19] that we're looking at that are
[1:28:20] Christians that ain't even got an
[1:28:21] experience with God but that doesn't
[1:28:23] take away that there is a bride on this
[1:28:26] Earth with her genuine experience of the
[1:28:28] Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] can you say man
[1:28:33] that's that's right now notice see so so
[1:28:36] there's going to be a fake in
[1:28:39] impersonations but you know what here's
[1:28:42] the thing and I want to tell you young
[1:28:43] people just the same don't focus on that
[1:28:46] don't focus on impersonations don't
[1:28:49] focus on Hypocrites you're that they'll
[1:28:52] be just a diamond doesn't
[1:28:55] then you say amen and there ain't
[1:28:56] nothing you can do about it
[1:28:58] you make sure you're genuine
[1:29:01] you make sure you've got an experience
[1:29:03] with God
[1:29:05] ain't that right
[1:29:07] so all of these things I'm not here
[1:29:09] focusing on the faith and the
[1:29:10] impersonations and the frauds and and
[1:29:12] all of that if we've done that we'd
[1:29:14] spend all of our time with that but
[1:29:16] there's more message to preach than that
[1:29:18] and I believe I've got a bride I've got
[1:29:21] to believe there's a people here and I'm
[1:29:22] believing all of you are here as the
[1:29:25] Bride of Jesus Christ and that's why I
[1:29:27] can preach the way I preach and you amen
[1:29:29] at the way I eat you a man
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:33] gives me hope
[1:29:36] to study because I know there's a bride
[1:29:38] here
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:43] so we're not focusing on on Fool's goat
[1:29:47] we're focusing on the genuine thing
[1:29:49] right remember Judas followed Jesus all
[1:29:53] the way till Pentecost
[1:29:55] and it was at Pentecost he showed his
[1:29:56] colors
[1:29:58] I'm going to read this it's a little
[1:29:59] lengthy
[1:30:00] when it come to Pentecost for Judas to
[1:30:03] receive the Holy Ghost and so forth he
[1:30:04] showed his color he denied Jesus he
[1:30:07] become a traitor to him and that's just
[1:30:10] exactly what where that Spirit come
[1:30:12] right up through Luther Wesley brought
[1:30:14] that church up to sanctification with
[1:30:17] the Virgin alive Pure Clean holy nights
[1:30:19] finest people you ever met but when it
[1:30:22] came when it go to speaking in tongues
[1:30:24] and receiving the Holy Ghost the
[1:30:25] Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Free Methodist
[1:30:27] then says that's the devil
[1:30:29] and right then is when you blaspheme the
[1:30:32] Holy Ghost and shut yourself off forever
[1:30:34] for whosoever speak a word against the
[1:30:36] son of man shall be forgiven uh but
[1:30:39] whosoever speaks against the Holy Ghost
[1:30:41] shall never be forgiven remember all the
[1:30:44] disciples spoke in tongues Jesus died on
[1:30:46] the cross
[1:30:47] speaking in tongues
[1:30:49] see so if you can't deal with them here
[1:30:52] and be friendly with them here what
[1:30:54] about over there
[1:30:56] if these are devils so was them
[1:30:59] see so you see where there where it
[1:31:02] showed its colors there comes that
[1:31:04] virgin clean the rest as the rest of
[1:31:07] them Pure Life I'll take the
[1:31:09] old-fashioned knit Nazarene Pilgrim
[1:31:11] Holiness churches who really believed in
[1:31:13] sanctification you can't lay a finger on
[1:31:15] their lives clean as they can be it's a
[1:31:17] good thing that we'd all live like that
[1:31:20] see that's right you have to see now he
[1:31:23] said we know we got a lot over in
[1:31:25] Pentecostals as impersonators that's
[1:31:28] true but as long as you see a bogus
[1:31:30] dollar you know that was made off of a
[1:31:33] good one a real one that's right there's
[1:31:36] a real Holy Ghost a real one that speaks
[1:31:39] in tongues and shows signs and wonders
[1:31:41] and it's been since Pentecost down so we
[1:31:45] have to have the impersonators we have
[1:31:47] to have an evil woman that's no good to
[1:31:49] make a real woman shine out we have to
[1:31:52] have a nighttime black darkness to show
[1:31:54] the sunlight is glorious that's right
[1:31:57] you have to be sick in order to enjoy
[1:32:00] good health and it's all see it's a law
[1:32:02] of pro and con it's always been and
[1:32:05] always will be as long as time is can
[1:32:07] you say man another place brother Brown
[1:32:10] said speaking of the rest of the
[1:32:12] disciples you know he was telling about
[1:32:13] Judas showing his colors at Pentecost
[1:32:16] and he he called him a traitor he he
[1:32:19] called Judas a traitor and and he said
[1:32:21] but the rest of the disciples he said
[1:32:23] they went out and had spiritual gifts
[1:32:25] they healed the sick they preached they
[1:32:27] were thrown in jail they were willing to
[1:32:29] suffer for the word sake ain't that
[1:32:31] right and so now then brother Branham
[1:32:33] explains what a traitor is and listen he
[1:32:37] says if you went to another Nation as a
[1:32:41] wishy-washy you wouldn't make a very
[1:32:43] good American if you went over there see
[1:32:46] he said if you was going
[1:32:49] in now to Japan and you slipped around
[1:32:52] behind the line and say listen fellas
[1:32:54] I'm for you
[1:32:56] and you know what I'm for you but I'm
[1:32:59] over on the other side
[1:33:00] he said you traitor you ought to be
[1:33:03] shocked that's right you're a traitor
[1:33:05] sure he said see and then that's the
[1:33:08] same way it is a man that knows the word
[1:33:10] of God and will compromise on it because
[1:33:13] some organization tells him he has to do
[1:33:16] it that way that's a traitor ain't that
[1:33:18] right he said notice what he talks about
[1:33:20] these men at Pentecost but these men
[1:33:23] weren't traitors they didn't care how
[1:33:26] much well How They carried on how their
[1:33:29] Church manners was screaming and crying
[1:33:32] and shouting and jabbering off languages
[1:33:34] that seemed like they was talking to one
[1:33:37] another and couldn't understand them men
[1:33:40] out there in the audience of other
[1:33:42] nations and other tongues begin to hear
[1:33:43] what they were saying now see they
[1:33:46] didn't know what they were saying
[1:33:48] talking about those that were speaking
[1:33:49] it they were jabbering but other people
[1:33:52] out there understood it can you say Amen
[1:33:55] see what was it it was a Pentecostal
[1:33:57] experience the Holy Ghost was speaking
[1:34:00] through the am another language
[1:34:03] that them men didn't even have the idea
[1:34:06] of what they were speaking they didn't
[1:34:08] know how to speak them
[1:34:10] but they were speaking it
[1:34:12] one might have been speaking English
[1:34:16] another an Arabic
[1:34:18] another one Japanese
[1:34:21] you understand what I'm saying and they
[1:34:23] didn't know it
[1:34:24] but it wasn't them speaking it
[1:34:27] these weren't Scholars with seven
[1:34:29] languages
[1:34:31] these were dumb ignorant men unlearned
[1:34:34] the Bible says
[1:34:35] but when the Holy Ghost got hold of him
[1:34:37] he wanted to send a message to them
[1:34:40] people out there
[1:34:47] isn't that wonderful
[1:34:52] so we find that what happened on the day
[1:34:55] of Pentecost was a supernatural act of
[1:34:57] God
[1:34:59] ain't that right now brother Brown spoke
[1:35:02] of Hal the hawk has long ago
[1:35:05] Lots disidentification
[1:35:08] and he said see he goes back goes on and
[1:35:11] keeps on going back
[1:35:13] trying to eat something Manna From
[1:35:15] Another Day it's rotten it's no good
[1:35:18] a genuine Eagle of this day knows that
[1:35:21] was all right but we got that
[1:35:24] Plus
[1:35:27] can you say man until Jesus Christ is
[1:35:30] made and manifest in the fullness
[1:35:34] of his power as he promised to be in
[1:35:38] this last day can you say Amen in other
[1:35:41] places said this Aid this last stage is
[1:35:43] what they were plus this
[1:35:46] the church today is that light plus what
[1:35:50] it has received today
[1:35:52] see another place it's Christ now taking
[1:35:55] the rags of yesterday the Lutheran the
[1:35:57] Methodist Presbyterian and so forth and
[1:36:00] he is putting it through a process what
[1:36:02] kind of process a process of the Holy
[1:36:05] Spirit what they had plus making it feel
[1:36:09] he is pressing his own image think of it
[1:36:13] he had to have Luther in order to make
[1:36:16] his image shine he had to have Wesley in
[1:36:19] order to make his image shine he had to
[1:36:21] have Pentecostal in order for it to
[1:36:24] shine but now we are here with that plus
[1:36:27] to where the fullness of Jesus Christ is
[1:36:31] pressed into the church the full power
[1:36:34] the full the goodness of God's glory is
[1:36:37] in the seed the church today
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:43] you see Jesus was Solomon
[1:36:47] plus David
[1:36:50] plus Elijah
[1:36:52] plus Isaiah
[1:36:55] plus Moses
[1:36:57] you hit it
[1:36:59] he just didn't reflect one part
[1:37:03] he reflected it all
[1:37:06] he was the masterpiece
[1:37:09] he was what they were saying
[1:37:12] David had a little bit of life and look
[1:37:15] what he done perfect he reflected Christ
[1:37:18] Solomon had a little life and he
[1:37:20] reflected Christ amen Moses had a little
[1:37:23] life and he reflected Christ all the way
[1:37:25] down we see portions of God's life but
[1:37:28] then the fullness of God dwelt bodily in
[1:37:31] Jesus Christ and he was all the prophets
[1:37:34] he was all the songs he was all of the
[1:37:38] whole story it was in Christ can you say
[1:37:41] amen and here we are back at the
[1:37:43] Masterpiece again not just a portion but
[1:37:46] we have all of the word and you cannot
[1:37:50] take part of it out and make a
[1:37:52] masterpiece it took it all
[1:37:58] can you say Amen
[1:38:00] he was the fullness of it all God's
[1:38:03] Masterpiece and so were we are the
[1:38:05] fullness of it all another Masterpiece
[1:38:08] but where do the Masterpiece come from
[1:38:11] it come out of Jesus Christ it come out
[1:38:14] of Jesus Christ so that's our hope
[1:38:16] that's our and that's our foundation
[1:38:18] that's our expectation is what he was we
[1:38:21] are what he is we are and we will be can
[1:38:26] you say Amen
[1:38:34] now notice the real article or the real
[1:38:36] genuine article of God was Pentecost
[1:38:38] brother REM said
[1:38:40] it was
[1:38:43] and will always be
[1:38:46] and I believe that brother Brandon
[1:38:47] believed that with all of his heart
[1:38:50] in his prayer he said bring them back to
[1:38:52] original Pentecost
[1:38:54] bring them back to the blessings
[1:38:57] bring them back like the Pentecost that
[1:38:59] fail in A.D 33.
[1:39:01] give them the Pentecostal blessings
[1:39:04] May the power of God come into the
[1:39:06] church May there be Divine Healing gifts
[1:39:09] give to the church May there be speakers
[1:39:12] with tongues interpreter of tongues May
[1:39:16] there be Gifts of Prophecy and all
[1:39:18] different manifestations not make
[1:39:20] believe or try to believe or put on but
[1:39:24] may it be real genuine coming with the
[1:39:28] word
[1:39:29] the word of God made known prophesying
[1:39:32] things that comes to pass can you say
[1:39:35] Amen another place he said that's where
[1:39:37] the church began right here with
[1:39:40] Pentecostal power
[1:39:42] he says down through the stream of time
[1:39:44] the real true children of God held on to
[1:39:48] that Pentecostal blessing
[1:39:50] they spoke in tongues they had
[1:39:53] interpretation of tongues they had signs
[1:39:56] and wonders and they baptized in the
[1:39:59] name of Jesus Christ and everything that
[1:40:01] the apostles did they did too right down
[1:40:05] through there can you say amen that's
[1:40:08] right you realize the reason why brother
[1:40:10] Branham named the men that he did as The
[1:40:12] Messengers of the ages
[1:40:14] was not because of what they were in in
[1:40:18] in the eyes of the public they uh you
[1:40:20] know influential men or whatever
[1:40:22] but it was because of the supernatural
[1:40:26] that was in these men's lives
[1:40:28] the signs and wonders that they had they
[1:40:31] had Supernatural manifestations of God
[1:40:35] many years ago
[1:40:37] a minister
[1:40:41] had a radio program
[1:40:44] and on there he told the people that the
[1:40:47] Pentecostal religion was just a sham
[1:40:53] and he told the told his audience
[1:40:56] not to listen to them because it's
[1:40:58] unstable
[1:41:03] he said any man that spoke in tongues
[1:41:05] and these things and claimed to be
[1:41:06] healed the sick and so forth by prayer
[1:41:09] that the people were to stay away from
[1:41:11] it
[1:41:12] and to pray for those poor decrepit
[1:41:14] people
[1:41:15] because if they were in an illusion
[1:41:18] that there was something wrong with them
[1:41:20] and he told his audience that that was
[1:41:23] only given for the days of the Apostles
[1:41:25] at Pentecost
[1:41:29] but we find that 30 years or so later
[1:41:32] that brother that Paul from the day of
[1:41:35] Pentecost Paul sat in the church the
[1:41:38] gifts nine spiritual gifts
[1:41:40] he sat within there
[1:41:42] speaking of tongues Miracles and all
[1:41:44] these other gifts
[1:41:47] so brother Branham said this he said
[1:41:49] there is a true one
[1:41:52] of real genuine a gift of speaking in
[1:41:56] tongues that's always everybody say
[1:41:59] always supposed to be in the church
[1:42:02] you say Amen
[1:42:04] so has this man you know talking it
[1:42:07] reminded me of of balak
[1:42:12] when he when Israel
[1:42:14] he was the king of Moab and Israel
[1:42:17] had come to uh cross over they were
[1:42:21] going into the promised land and Israel
[1:42:23] thank you buddy uh wanted to go through
[1:42:26] the land of Moab to get there
[1:42:29] and they told they sent a note to the
[1:42:31] king balak and said we would like to
[1:42:34] pass through your land
[1:42:35] he says anything that is taken off your
[1:42:38] land as far as eating
[1:42:41] um water
[1:42:43] food whatever we will pay that we will
[1:42:46] we will give you the money for that if
[1:42:49] you just let us cross over
[1:42:52] and and so now brother Branham says that
[1:42:55] Israel was God's chosen people for that
[1:42:57] day
[1:42:58] and he also said they were the
[1:43:00] Pentecostals of that day
[1:43:03] they had taken Refuge under the blood
[1:43:05] they had all been baptized in the Red
[1:43:06] Sea they came up out of the water
[1:43:09] singing in the spirit dancing under the
[1:43:11] energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam
[1:43:13] the prophetess played her tambourine
[1:43:16] see and so when they came up to this
[1:43:19] brother Branham said King balap got very
[1:43:21] excited about Israel coming across in
[1:43:24] their land he said that head of that
[1:43:26] that head of the nicolaitan bunch was
[1:43:29] not about to let the church come through
[1:43:32] come through with its signs and wonders
[1:43:35] and diverse manifestations of the Holy
[1:43:37] Ghost with their faces shining with the
[1:43:39] glory of God it was too risky as he
[1:43:41] might lose some of his crowd
[1:43:46] brother Brown said that's the same thing
[1:43:48] it is today
[1:43:52] and so there are too many
[1:43:54] that criticize these things and tried to
[1:43:56] explain them away
[1:43:58] and they want to put it all on
[1:44:00] Sensations
[1:44:02] if you dance
[1:44:03] Sensations
[1:44:05] if you speak in tongues that's sensation
[1:44:08] if you if you shake that Sensations if
[1:44:13] you run around the church
[1:44:15] that Sensations if you jump up you're
[1:44:18] working the people
[1:44:19] you know if the young people dancing
[1:44:22] shouting in the spirit see you're
[1:44:24] working them up there's that's sensation
[1:44:26] see they ain't got nothing real they
[1:44:29] better watch what they're saying about
[1:44:30] that
[1:44:32] they better watch what they're saying
[1:44:33] about it and they're criticizing
[1:44:35] because that could be the genuine thing
[1:44:40] it's true if you're crying boohoo that's
[1:44:43] just working them up see and so so many
[1:44:48] have have quoted me on these things
[1:44:50] where brother Brandon mentions about the
[1:44:53] mystery of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:44:55] without sensation
[1:44:57] so they go send no sensation no
[1:45:00] sensation so they get a dead church if
[1:45:02] they have their way they'll have a dead
[1:45:03] Church where they just get up and do a
[1:45:06] little sermonette teach and all that and
[1:45:08] everybody amen
[1:45:10] amen and then they go home but everybody
[1:45:12] you know that believes the words got the
[1:45:14] Holy Ghost you know they just believe
[1:45:16] the word or just do what they say they
[1:45:19] want them to do you know just control
[1:45:22] but see so they they say well it's it's
[1:45:26] receiving the Holy Ghost without
[1:45:27] sensation that's what brother Brandon
[1:45:29] was getting to
[1:45:30] I got to ask you this
[1:45:33] on the day of Pentecost was that
[1:45:35] Sensations that they received
[1:45:38] they spoke in tongues
[1:45:40] they shouted they danced
[1:45:42] they staggered they staggered everybody
[1:45:45] say they staggered you know what
[1:45:47] staggering is we ain't dumb you know
[1:45:49] what staggering is staggering like a
[1:45:52] drunk man have you ever seen a drunk man
[1:45:54] much longer have you ever seen a drunk
[1:45:55] man they just stagger
[1:45:57] just staggering everywhere us you know
[1:46:00] everything looks nice to him but they
[1:46:02] were just staggering you know and some
[1:46:03] of them can be sweet and kind and
[1:46:05] actually loan you some money at that
[1:46:07] time because they're drunk
[1:46:09] they're they're intoxicated they don't
[1:46:11] know what they're doing they're just
[1:46:13] happy
[1:46:14] staggering
[1:46:16] you know the prophet said they staggered
[1:46:19] so much did they stagger that they
[1:46:21] thought they were drunk
[1:46:24] I I can talk to you about the Lord but
[1:46:27] you wouldn't think I'm just drunk
[1:46:29] but these men thought they were drunk
[1:46:32] they staggered you understand what I'm
[1:46:35] saying
[1:46:36] bet it wasn't Sensations
[1:46:39] you know what the Bible promised them
[1:46:41] you shall receive power after that the
[1:46:45] Holy Ghost come upon you
[1:46:48] can you say man did Jesus lie or did he
[1:46:53] was he lying to him did they receive a
[1:46:55] sensation or did they receive power
[1:46:58] they received power and that power that
[1:47:01] they received made them act like that
[1:47:07] that power can make you roll on the
[1:47:09] floor
[1:47:10] it can make you act like a nut it can
[1:47:12] make you sit there amen and just laugh
[1:47:14] in the spirit
[1:47:16] have you ever seen someone just laugh in
[1:47:17] the spirit and just laugh and they laugh
[1:47:20] and they laugh and they're just laughing
[1:47:21] they're just having a ball they're
[1:47:23] caught up in somewhere you say oh that's
[1:47:25] fanaticism you better watch what you're
[1:47:27] saying about it
[1:47:29] hello remember brother Brown talked
[1:47:32] about that John Ryan there with that big
[1:47:34] old long beard and that shaggy hair you
[1:47:36] all remember that and he's sitting there
[1:47:38] at his table
[1:47:40] and asked him to pray over the food and
[1:47:43] he starts praying on food speaking in
[1:47:45] tongues start speaking in tongues and he
[1:47:47] started laughing
[1:47:49] said I didn't have a clue
[1:47:51] I don't know what was going on
[1:47:53] the man just started laughing
[1:47:57] then came over and started prophesying
[1:47:58] over him
[1:48:00] foreign
[1:48:01] at the dinner table
[1:48:05] you see they received power not
[1:48:08] Sensations
[1:48:11] hello
[1:48:14] see so if they done them things by
[1:48:16] sensation then we have to be careful
[1:48:18] about Sensations
[1:48:21] because if they've done that under
[1:48:23] sensation God approved of it
[1:48:25] and said that's my church
[1:48:28] and then he would send the prophet
[1:48:30] zealous go back to the original
[1:48:33] but I'm here to tell you I don't believe
[1:48:35] it was some sensation
[1:48:37] I know there's people that receive
[1:48:39] sensation and they really think they got
[1:48:40] the goods but I'm talking about a
[1:48:43] genuine Pentecostal experience they had
[1:48:46] something more than just a sensation it
[1:48:49] changed Peter's life
[1:48:51] it changed them
[1:48:56] can you say Amen
[1:48:59] so you shall receive power now notice
[1:49:02] Acts 2 and 1 and when the day of
[1:49:04] Pentecost was full to come they were all
[1:49:06] with one Accord in one place and
[1:49:09] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:49:11] as a rushing might of the wind and it
[1:49:13] filled all the house where they were
[1:49:15] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:49:17] clothing tongues like as a fire and it's
[1:49:20] set upon each of them and they were all
[1:49:22] filled with the Holy ghosts and begin to
[1:49:24] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:49:26] gave them utterance can you say Amen now
[1:49:30] notice what the prophet said was the
[1:49:31] Pentecostal Church a noisy church back
[1:49:34] at the beginning when the Holy Ghost
[1:49:36] fell first he said the Virgin Mary like
[1:49:39] she was drunk staggering under the power
[1:49:42] of God and all of them like that and the
[1:49:45] people said they're full of new wine
[1:49:47] that's the way the church was ordained
[1:49:49] that's the way every church was ordained
[1:49:52] and every time God has a church it'll be
[1:49:55] the same kind of church because it ain't
[1:49:58] no got no uncertain sound can you say
[1:50:01] amen he says in another place while they
[1:50:04] were influenced by the Holy Ghost they
[1:50:06] went into action staggering like drunk
[1:50:08] men screaming speaking in tongues out in
[1:50:10] the street they went oh church can you
[1:50:13] say Amen so we we find amen that that's
[1:50:16] what they've done under the Pentecostal
[1:50:19] power of God
[1:50:21] amen bro if we've got the fullness of
[1:50:24] God's power in this day
[1:50:28] don't tell me that you're just going to
[1:50:29] sit there
[1:50:33] be religious
[1:50:37] fighting devils
[1:50:39] no power
[1:50:42] it ain't gonna happen
[1:50:44] I I'm just I'm gonna be frank my name
[1:50:47] ain't Frank but I'm gonna be frank with
[1:50:48] you
[1:50:50] there's stuff about just you know guys
[1:50:52] having a hard time overcoming that
[1:50:54] pornography
[1:50:56] something wrong with that experience
[1:50:59] now don't get me wrong I know there's
[1:51:01] Temptations
[1:51:02] I understand a man will fall you know I
[1:51:05] I don't know how to that extent I'm not
[1:51:07] here can a man go out and get drunk take
[1:51:10] it take a drink and come back you know
[1:51:12] I'm not into all the depths of that at
[1:51:14] this point and today but I'm just
[1:51:18] telling you a man can fall and man makes
[1:51:20] mistakes and I don't know where all that
[1:51:23] borderline is and and so I'm not going
[1:51:25] there today but I'm just telling you
[1:51:27] this
[1:51:28] if he can't get out of the gutter
[1:51:32] you need the power of God
[1:51:35] if you can't be a Christian you need the
[1:51:37] power of God
[1:51:39] can you say Amen now that's what that
[1:51:41] Pentecostal experience was all about was
[1:51:43] the power of God
[1:51:45] do you believe that here's the power of
[1:51:47] God I'm not saying everybody has to
[1:51:49] speak in tongues that's not it but they
[1:51:51] did speak in tongues and then tongues
[1:51:53] are still in this church
[1:51:55] you say well I didn't speak in tongues
[1:51:57] well you know what God God used Israel
[1:52:00] one time to March around the city
[1:52:02] and then the next Generation God used
[1:52:04] him not to March around the city so they
[1:52:06] couldn't say well you know we got to do
[1:52:07] it the way Joshua did it we got to run
[1:52:09] around the city you know we got to March
[1:52:10] around seven days no God had a choir up
[1:52:13] there to sing song and he defeated the
[1:52:16] quiet or defeated the Enemy by that
[1:52:17] choir just singing so you understand
[1:52:19] what I'm saying God works in mysterious
[1:52:22] ways but that generation that sung them
[1:52:25] song couldn't look back and say well God
[1:52:27] won't do that anymore if God wanted them
[1:52:30] to march around the city they'll do it
[1:52:31] if God wants us to do it today we'll do
[1:52:34] it and God can do whatever he wants to
[1:52:36] do
[1:52:38] praise the Lord thank you we don't put
[1:52:41] limits to God
[1:52:43] whatever God wants to do he's going to
[1:52:45] do it
[1:52:46] and we welcome it
[1:52:50] you understand what I'm saying
[1:52:52] there's people that dance
[1:52:54] because they got victory
[1:52:56] they got liberated
[1:52:57] other people get liberated and they cry
[1:53:02] I'll tell you one thing about it when
[1:53:04] when they get to live liberated no
[1:53:06] matter what they do when they get
[1:53:07] liberated they all live like Christians
[1:53:10] you understand what I'm saying
[1:53:13] but see it's a supernatural God so you
[1:53:17] can't put barriers you can't put God in
[1:53:19] a box
[1:53:21] if God is Supernatural in this body this
[1:53:24] church is the body of Christ let God be
[1:53:27] God
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:29] then you say man
[1:53:31] so here
[1:53:32] we find
[1:53:34] the prophet said and when they was
[1:53:36] filled with the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[1:53:39] they went into action right quick out
[1:53:41] into the streets screaming
[1:53:43] dancing acting like drunk people
[1:53:46] speaking with other tongues and what a
[1:53:48] carry on
[1:53:49] notice
[1:53:50] they was in action right quick
[1:53:54] as soon as they humbled themselves
[1:53:57] went in and closed the door and waited
[1:54:00] on the word of God
[1:54:02] oh do you love him
[1:54:05] all right I'm not going to keep you much
[1:54:06] longer
[1:54:07] I've only got one service though
[1:54:12] but we won't keep you much longer
[1:54:16] now we find
[1:54:18] even in the Bible First Corinthians 14
[1:54:22] 35 wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy
[1:54:24] and forbid not
[1:54:26] to speak with tunnels
[1:54:29] is that Bible or not
[1:54:33] so we see
[1:54:35] there's a lot of confusion about tongues
[1:54:39] but there's a truth about speaking in
[1:54:42] tongues
[1:54:43] speaking in tongues are part of the nine
[1:54:45] spiritual gifts that belong in the
[1:54:46] church
[1:54:48] tongues are the least of the gifts
[1:54:52] not everyone speaks in tongues
[1:54:54] they're not the evidence that you have
[1:54:57] the Holy Ghost
[1:54:59] hello
[1:55:00] tongues are not an infallible Act of God
[1:55:04] that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:55:07] is that right
[1:55:08] so that's the truth about tongues
[1:55:12] brother Brown said which is Wizards
[1:55:14] snake handlers Devils everything else
[1:55:16] speak in tongues
[1:55:18] so therefore I say to you that tongues I
[1:55:22] want you to repeat after me tongues
[1:55:24] are not
[1:55:26] to have the preeminence
[1:55:28] in the church
[1:55:31] I'm gonna say that again tongues
[1:55:33] are not
[1:55:35] supposed to have preeminence
[1:55:38] in the church
[1:55:42] it's not to have preeminence
[1:55:44] over the word of God
[1:55:49] can you say Amen
[1:55:52] now the truth about tongues
[1:55:56] the Bible tells us that there are
[1:55:58] tongues of angels
[1:56:00] and there are tons of men
[1:56:03] which tells us there's known and unknown
[1:56:06] tongues
[1:56:09] right
[1:56:11] truth
[1:56:14] when
[1:56:15] the 120 spoken tongues at Pentecost they
[1:56:18] were not speaking in unknown tongues
[1:56:22] they were jabbering they didn't even
[1:56:25] know what they were saying
[1:56:27] hello
[1:56:29] but the others did
[1:56:33] amen
[1:56:35] true
[1:56:38] brother Brown said it wasn't an unknown
[1:56:40] tongue
[1:56:42] it was a language
[1:56:46] ain't that right
[1:56:47] Acts 2 6 verifies that and says every
[1:56:51] man heard them speak in his own language
[1:56:57] it was tongues to the man that was
[1:56:59] saying it
[1:57:00] because he didn't know
[1:57:03] but the man that was hearing it
[1:57:05] was his own language
[1:57:09] is that right remember the man Danny I
[1:57:13] think it was Danny that spoke in tongues
[1:57:16] I wasn't he going to go wasn't he going
[1:57:19] to go Shake brother Brown's hand or meet
[1:57:21] him or something like that when he got
[1:57:22] up there he just started speaking in
[1:57:23] tongues out loud when the church was
[1:57:25] over
[1:57:26] service is over had no idea what he was
[1:57:29] speaking
[1:57:31] wow three three French interpreters
[1:57:37] and all of them said that's French
[1:57:39] the man was speaking in tongues
[1:57:42] he didn't know French
[1:57:44] the Holy Ghost was speaking through him
[1:57:49] but these three people
[1:57:51] said it was French he was speaking in
[1:57:54] and brother Brown said okay don't say a
[1:57:56] word y'all all three write it down and
[1:57:58] it was the same exact thing
[1:58:00] they all heard the same exact thing
[1:58:08] so we we find
[1:58:13] that it is not scriptural
[1:58:17] to say that unknown tongues was at
[1:58:21] Pentecost
[1:58:24] it wasn't in it's not in Scripture
[1:58:26] unknown tongues was not at Pentecost
[1:58:29] can you say Amen
[1:58:31] when the Holy Ghost fell in the house of
[1:58:34] Cornelius
[1:58:35] the Bible says they spoke in tongues
[1:58:38] brother Brown said but the tongues were
[1:58:40] understood by those who heard
[1:58:43] ain't that right
[1:58:46] so for the apostles said the Holy Ghost
[1:58:48] fell on them as it fell on us at the
[1:58:52] beginning
[1:58:53] is that right so Lord willing I want to
[1:58:55] get more into that
[1:58:57] and and and and and and and
[1:58:59] study on these things but I dare not
[1:59:03] stand before you today and tell you that
[1:59:05] them things do not happen today
[1:59:08] because they do happen
[1:59:10] they can happen the more you humble
[1:59:12] yourself the more you yield yourself and
[1:59:15] get your doubt out of the way watch what
[1:59:17] will take place that's the point of the
[1:59:20] message does take us back to the
[1:59:22] original to where we can stand there and
[1:59:24] let God just pour himself into us not
[1:59:27] intellectually
[1:59:30] you can become intellectually about this
[1:59:32] Bible about this message because God God
[1:59:35] ain't glorified in your intellectualism
[1:59:37] God's glorified when he can have his way
[1:59:40] through you and the supernatural takes
[1:59:43] over your human body
[1:59:45] man praise the Lord and you say Amen
[1:59:50] so we find that the Holy Ghost speaks in
[1:59:53] tongues and that's that's where the
[1:59:56] genuine gift comes from
[2:00:00] it's a supernatural working of the Holy
[2:00:02] Ghost
[2:00:03] ain't that right
[2:00:05] so I say to you that tongues are
[2:00:07] important
[2:00:08] when the Holy Ghost is speaking them
[2:00:13] right
[2:00:15] now brother Brandon says modern
[2:00:17] Pentecostals say that they can receive
[2:00:18] the Holy Ghost speaking in unknown or
[2:00:21] Angelic tongues
[2:00:23] that's that's what modern Pentecostals
[2:00:26] say
[2:00:27] brother Brown said they have the cart
[2:00:29] before the horse for in Acts 2 the
[2:00:31] people spoke in a perfect dialect
[2:00:34] which even unbelievers heard and
[2:00:36] understood
[2:00:38] ain't that right
[2:00:40] he goes on I hope there's all right
[2:00:43] brother Brown says tons of angels that's
[2:00:47] the man in private prayer out yonder
[2:00:50] somewhere speaking to God speaking to
[2:00:53] God in Angelic tongues yeah he said I
[2:00:57] could just call you a case right now
[2:01:02] that water is good
[2:01:04] he said you remember when the woman
[2:01:07] come to the auditorium there and where
[2:01:10] Dr Alexander dowey's from Zion said you
[2:01:13] remember me down there and Billy come
[2:01:15] after me down there to get me to go to
[2:01:17] the meeting and I said Billy going back
[2:01:19] he said what you crying about somebody
[2:01:21] been here and I said no sir you go on
[2:01:23] back tell brother Baxter to preach
[2:01:26] tonight
[2:01:27] and I got down on the floor and I said
[2:01:29] Lord what's the matter with me
[2:01:31] and all of a sudden I heard somebody at
[2:01:33] the door speaking in other languages
[2:01:35] and I thought it was German
[2:01:38] and I thought well that fellas come up
[2:01:40] to get him and he said I stopped you
[2:01:44] know praying and I listened at him
[2:01:46] standing there like this
[2:01:48] and I thought well how that guy will
[2:01:50] ever understand that
[2:01:52] because I know the man that run the that
[2:01:54] Motel about five miles out of the city
[2:01:57] you know and I had to get out of out
[2:01:59] there so many people around a small town
[2:02:02] and I said well that's strange and I
[2:02:05] said there but well boy did you ever
[2:02:07] hear that
[2:02:08] he said God don't even get his breath
[2:02:10] hardly see I was thinking that hard as
[2:02:13] he was speaking well I said well
[2:02:16] why it was me
[2:02:20] it was him the one that was speaking in
[2:02:22] tongues
[2:02:24] and I just kept Real Steel
[2:02:26] and he didn't say any just kept Real
[2:02:29] Steel after a while he got through
[2:02:31] speaking he
[2:02:33] got through speaking and when it did it
[2:02:36] felt like I could run through a troop
[2:02:37] and leap over a wall
[2:02:39] foreign
[2:02:40] and I went out and Billy was going out
[2:02:43] the gate and I hollered at him wait a
[2:02:46] minute and he come back he had been
[2:02:48] drinking a soda pop and he said Daddy
[2:02:50] what's the matter and I said just wait
[2:02:52] just a minute I'm going with you he said
[2:02:55] I started washing my face real quick he
[2:02:57] said what's the matter he knows better
[2:02:59] than talk to me see going through the
[2:03:01] meeting and he said what's the matter I
[2:03:03] said nothing nothing not at all just go
[2:03:07] ahead do the meeting we went on to the
[2:03:09] meeting brother Baxter was sitting there
[2:03:11] playing nothing between my soul and the
[2:03:13] savior he come in he said I thought you
[2:03:16] wasn't going to make it you're coming
[2:03:18] and I said
[2:03:20] you know and went on up and started just
[2:03:23] started preaching
[2:03:25] and when I got through about time I got
[2:03:27] through preaching well boy somebody like
[2:03:30] took the back of the building back there
[2:03:32] in that back Auditorium running
[2:03:34] extension mic back there and there was a
[2:03:36] woman back there just walking up and
[2:03:38] down that aisle shouting as hard as she
[2:03:40] could come to find out she had TB and
[2:03:43] they left Twin Cities Saint Paul the
[2:03:46] ambulance wouldn't bring her because
[2:03:47] they was afraid she would burst her
[2:03:49] lungs
[2:03:50] the doctor said anything her lungs was
[2:03:53] like Honeycombs if they ever broke
[2:03:55] should be dead that'd be all and some
[2:03:58] saints took an old 38 Chevy Chevrolet
[2:04:00] car and took the back seat and fixed it
[2:04:03] up and put her in there and was over the
[2:04:06] on the road over and they hit a little
[2:04:08] bump or something another down there and
[2:04:10] she started hemorrhaging and she just
[2:04:12] started spurting the blood right out it
[2:04:14] was going through her nose and
[2:04:15] everything like that and she got weaker
[2:04:17] and weaker finally she didn't want to
[2:04:19] die in that car she told them to stop
[2:04:21] and she put her and put her on the grass
[2:04:24] on the on a grass plat and they picked
[2:04:27] her out and and uh and they was all
[2:04:30] standing over her praying and all of a
[2:04:32] sudden she said something struck her and
[2:04:35] up she got and away she went shouting
[2:04:37] down that road as hard as she could here
[2:04:40] she was at church just walking up and
[2:04:42] down the aisle and I said sister what
[2:04:44] time was that and it was exactly the
[2:04:47] same time the Holy Spirit was speaking
[2:04:49] through me
[2:04:50] what was it gifts
[2:04:53] can you say Amen
[2:04:55] yes sir see that was the Holy Ghost
[2:04:58] making intercession
[2:05:03] Ryan speaking in tongues through brother
[2:05:07] Branham making intercessions for that
[2:05:09] lady
[2:05:11] see said God sent a gift to the earth
[2:05:13] and the Holy Spirit just couldn't wait
[2:05:17] any longer
[2:05:19] so he just come took me over and began
[2:05:22] to speak back himself like that see
[2:05:24] making intercessions himself
[2:05:28] and as we check the time that very same
[2:05:31] minute they put her on that plaque like
[2:05:33] that they wanted to see because they
[2:05:35] know she was dying they'd have to say
[2:05:37] the time she died it was that very
[2:05:39] minute that the Holy Spirit fell upon me
[2:05:42] up there and began to make intercession
[2:05:44] utterance words they can't understand
[2:05:46] them see giving like see giving
[2:05:49] utterance that's the Holy Spirit
[2:05:51] speaking
[2:05:55] and you say man
[2:05:57] but we find out that unknown tongues are
[2:06:00] not
[2:06:00] to be spoken in the church
[2:06:03] unless
[2:06:05] there's an interpreter
[2:06:07] that can give the interpretation to them
[2:06:10] tongues
[2:06:13] ain't that right
[2:06:15] First Corinthians 4 20 14 28 if there be
[2:06:18] no interpreter let him keep silence in
[2:06:21] the church
[2:06:23] someone say well you know they asked
[2:06:25] brother Branham well can can if if I've
[2:06:27] got something to say
[2:06:28] you know and I just got to say it he
[2:06:30] said you can wait
[2:06:33] you can wait remember they all jumped up
[2:06:36] every time I was trying to preach
[2:06:38] he said that's that's out of order it's
[2:06:39] disorder
[2:06:41] he said you can wait
[2:06:43] because the holy spirit's a gentleman
[2:06:46] and he wouldn't be up here on the
[2:06:47] platform anointing the prophet a
[2:06:49] preacher
[2:06:51] and then anoint them to interrupt
[2:06:55] you say well I can't remember what I was
[2:06:56] going to say it ain't you anyways
[2:07:04] you just yelled yourself in the Holy
[2:07:06] Ghost remember he'll know
[2:07:08] him speaking with the infinite mind
[2:07:12] right
[2:07:14] So speaking of unknown tongue does not
[2:07:16] edify the church
[2:07:18] unless it is interpreted can you say man
[2:07:22] but rather it edifies the individual
[2:07:25] that's speaking it
[2:07:28] that's what brother bran was saying that
[2:07:30] there and then you go to First
[2:07:32] Corinthians 14 and 4.
[2:07:34] and I'll close here but he says he that
[2:07:36] speaketh in an unknown tongue edifyth
[2:07:39] himself but he that prophesies edify the
[2:07:42] church the whole point in the church is
[2:07:44] to be edified
[2:07:45] if you sing songs Let It edify If You
[2:07:48] Preach let it edify if you prophesy Let
[2:07:51] It Be edifying
[2:07:53] you hold an office in the church Let It
[2:07:55] Be edifying
[2:07:57] everything that is done in the church it
[2:07:59] has to be for the edification of the
[2:08:01] church
[2:08:02] can you say Amen
[2:08:04] or if if it's not then it's it's not
[2:08:08] profiting
[2:08:12] so he says see I would that you all
[2:08:15] speak with tongues
[2:08:17] but rather that you prophesy
[2:08:21] for greater is he that prophesieth than
[2:08:23] he that speak with tongues
[2:08:25] why would he say that I believe it was
[2:08:27] the prophet that said because he that
[2:08:29] prophesied edify at the church
[2:08:32] it's edification
[2:08:36] so he said see uh except he he said for
[2:08:40] he greater is he that prophesieth than
[2:08:42] he that speak with tongues except he
[2:08:45] interpret that the church may receive
[2:08:48] edifying
[2:08:50] you go to the 13th verse break it in let
[2:08:53] him that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[2:08:55] pray that he may interpret
[2:08:58] for if I pray in an unknown tongue my
[2:09:01] spirit prayeth but my understanding is
[2:09:03] unfruitful
[2:09:07] amen
[2:09:08] amen you love the Lord
[2:09:12] I love him
[2:09:15] so here just to go on for a moment John
[2:09:19] 15 5 Jesus says I am the vine and you
[2:09:21] are the branches
[2:09:23] and he that abideth in me and I in him
[2:09:26] the same brings forth much fruit
[2:09:29] for without me you can't do nothing
[2:09:32] so brother Brown says every church that
[2:09:34] rises out of that vine will be a
[2:09:36] Pentecostal Church
[2:09:38] he said the prophet of God said this
[2:09:39] Pentecost began without an ending
[2:09:43] everybody say Pentecost
[2:09:45] began without an ending
[2:09:48] it's to be to every creature old times
[2:09:51] at all places that Pentecost should
[2:09:54] always remain
[2:09:56] the Pentecostal blessing should be upon
[2:09:59] the people
[2:10:01] and what are what is the Pentecostal
[2:10:04] blessings
[2:10:05] it's the confirmation of Jesus Christ
[2:10:10] and you say Amen or it's the
[2:10:12] confirmation of the Resurrection so the
[2:10:15] Pentecostal blessing is the confirmation
[2:10:18] of the Resurrection
[2:10:20] you see why we want to always keep that
[2:10:22] Pentecostal act uh uh uh experience with
[2:10:26] us keep that Pentecostal blessing with
[2:10:29] us because it's the confirmation of the
[2:10:32] Resurrection
[2:10:33] you can go to church and and just go to
[2:10:35] church and be acting intellectual but
[2:10:37] that has nothing to do with the
[2:10:38] confirmation of Resurrection Jesus
[2:10:41] Christ is risen
[2:10:44] do you believe it this message is a it
[2:10:47] is a message that he has risen from the
[2:10:51] dead
[2:10:52] and this church has the Pentecostal
[2:10:54] blessings to show confirmation to that
[2:10:58] the true church
[2:11:01] and you say man
[2:11:03] so I read this last Sunday the true
[2:11:05] church will always try to be like the
[2:11:06] original at Pentecost
[2:11:08] the true church of today will try to
[2:11:10] approximate that first early that early
[2:11:13] first one and The Messengers to the
[2:11:16] churches have the having the same spirit
[2:11:18] of God in them will try to approximate
[2:11:21] the Apostle Paul
[2:11:22] they won't be exactly like him but the
[2:11:25] true Messengers will be the ones that
[2:11:28] come the closest to Paul who was free of
[2:11:31] all men sowed out to God and gave forth
[2:11:33] the word of God to only and manifested
[2:11:36] the Holy Ghost in power none else would
[2:11:38] do see so you have to work from the
[2:11:41] original as light begets like the true
[2:11:43] church will always be uh the one that
[2:11:46] tries to follow in the steps of her
[2:11:49] Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers
[2:11:52] will follow the Apostle Paul the first
[2:11:55] Messenger to the first church age can
[2:11:59] you say Amen if the musicians will come
[2:12:03] so the way that we can judge what the
[2:12:05] true church was at Pentecost
[2:12:09] and what she was in in the apostolic age
[2:12:12] is by what we see in the word in the
[2:12:15] book of Acts
[2:12:18] and by what we see
[2:12:20] that's what the church today will try to
[2:12:23] approximate
[2:12:25] she will be just like that original
[2:12:28] she will believe in them things
[2:12:30] can you say Amen
[2:12:32] and it's so valuable so valuable today
[2:12:34] to listen to these things and to know
[2:12:36] this
[2:12:38] because here we are 60 years
[2:12:41] you would have never found message
[2:12:43] preachers
[2:12:44] in brother by Adam's age well brother
[2:12:47] Brandon was alive
[2:12:49] or even a little bit after trying to
[2:12:51] convince the people
[2:12:52] that there's no such things as gifts
[2:12:54] anymore there's no such things as
[2:12:56] emotions anymore there's no such thing
[2:12:58] one man told the church in Ohio the
[2:13:00] other day you know
[2:13:02] how how he received it and he talking
[2:13:04] about how that these people on the floor
[2:13:06] that's just emotional that's just show
[2:13:10] I thought buddy you wouldn't have lasted
[2:13:12] along with a prophet on Earth
[2:13:15] but here at 60 years now so these men
[2:13:18] are creeping in
[2:13:20] why
[2:13:23] because they feel like they have enough
[2:13:24] backing now
[2:13:26] to get us away from that original just
[2:13:29] think of it now the Nicolaitans came in
[2:13:31] just shortly after Pentecost
[2:13:33] true hello
[2:13:36] but here we are 60 years or so
[2:13:40] since brother branham's been gone
[2:13:42] close to it
[2:13:46] and now they're trying to pervert our
[2:13:48] young people this Young Generation now
[2:13:50] you don't need that well
[2:13:53] until you can show me
[2:13:55] where brother Brown said you don't need
[2:13:56] that
[2:13:58] I'll believe what brother Branham said
[2:14:00] and he said the birth is messy
[2:14:03] Annie birth is messy
[2:14:05] any birth
[2:14:07] but I will tell you you get a birth
[2:14:12] it'll be a genuine thing
[2:14:15] like it was on the day of Pentecost
[2:14:18] and tell us gifts ain't in operation
[2:14:21] show me verbatim where brother Brian
[2:14:23] said that brother Amos where did he say
[2:14:25] it
[2:14:28] and yet I'll show you ever even in the
[2:14:30] third pool brother Jesus died rejected
[2:14:33] at third pool ministry right it's
[2:14:35] because of his third pool Ministry he's
[2:14:36] hanging on the cross because his third
[2:14:38] book of ministry and yet he's spoke in
[2:14:39] tongues
[2:14:41] unknown tongues
[2:14:47] so the polls have nothing to do with the
[2:14:49] Pentecostal experience
[2:14:52] what I'm talking about is a Pentecostal
[2:14:54] experience
[2:14:56] can you say man
[2:15:00] and if we're in the fullness of the word
[2:15:02] fullness
[2:15:03] we ain't picking and choosing
[2:15:06] Wayne Got A Part here and a part there
[2:15:08] and leaving this out and all that out no
[2:15:10] fullness of the word takes it all
[2:15:13] and that's why brother Brown said well
[2:15:15] Paul preached I preached the same well
[2:15:17] Paul's the one that set the gifts in the
[2:15:18] church
[2:15:19] and I can guarantee you brother Brandon
[2:15:21] preached the same
[2:15:24] then you say Amen
[2:15:25] we got that
[2:15:27] Plus
[2:15:29] you love him isn't he wonderful
[2:15:32] Hallelujah I love the Lord
[2:15:35] brother random says here he says if if
[2:15:37] the holy spirit that you profess to have
[2:15:39] is not making you live like they did in
[2:15:41] the book of Acts and your life could
[2:15:43] write another book you better take
[2:15:45] warning
[2:15:47] if the first Vine brought forth the
[2:15:48] Pentecostal Church the second Vine or
[2:15:50] Branch rather out of the vine will bring
[2:15:52] forth another Pentecostal church with
[2:15:54] the Pentecostal experience bearing the
[2:15:55] same fruits that the first church had
[2:15:57] it'll speak in tongues and have power in
[2:16:00] the signs of the resurrected Christ in
[2:16:02] it if you're going to be a Christian now
[2:16:04] I'm just reading different quotes but he
[2:16:06] said if you're going to be a Christian
[2:16:07] you have to go back
[2:16:09] and the first church that God ever
[2:16:11] ordained was at the day of Pentecost it
[2:16:13] was a Pentecostal believing church with
[2:16:14] the Pentecostal experience the first
[2:16:17] church was a Pentecostal Church filled
[2:16:19] with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders
[2:16:20] and miracles accompanying it and if God
[2:16:22] is an infinite God and set his church in
[2:16:25] order like that on the day of Pentecost
[2:16:27] every time he sets the church in order
[2:16:28] will be the same thing has to be because
[2:16:31] he's infinite and cannot change our
[2:16:33] doctrines and theology has taken us off
[2:16:36] to one side till we're wandering in the
[2:16:38] wilderness
[2:16:40] then another place go back to that
[2:16:42] original Pentecost don't get away from
[2:16:44] there if when you do you're lost
[2:16:47] stay with that blessing
[2:16:49] didn't you see man
[2:16:51] there's an original Pentecost there's an
[2:16:54] original in feeling with the Holy Ghost
[2:16:57] there are original signs and wonders
[2:17:00] there is an original Church
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:03] and that's what we are part of
[2:17:06] is that original seat
[2:17:08] can you say man do you love the Lord I
[2:17:11] trust it was a help to you today
