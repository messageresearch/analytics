on this side but she's won the battle however many more years a month that she would be afflicted but we're praying God that she'll be touched and made well in the name of the Lord Jesus and we pray

brother Walker passed away yesterday morning and a great soldier of the Cross and the world's gotten a little bit more darker and we certainly uh loved and appreciated brother Walker he's definitely ran his race fought the good fight of faith a man and so we want to keep them the family in our prayer you can turn with me first John the fourth chapter amen first John chapter 4 but the viewing and

grave site it's going to be about an hour away uh from uh the uh the funeral home and uh so if you want to go um to that just be prepared that it is about an hour away um so anyways and Carla wanted me to just to thank you all for your prayers and all those that have visited and um the things that you have done for her dad and um uh they they certainly appreciate everything that the church did in different ones from all over uh the money the cards the the visitation and and the things that are deeply appreciative of that amen also uh as it's been said happy birthday to brother Mark and just that trust you have a double blessing amen today birthday and Father's Day and we certainly appreciate brother Mark and very very much and he has kind of like been Brother Sam he's uh his his fingerprints are all over this this building and uh labored very hard for many years um uh for this this assembly and we certainly appreciate him his love for the Lord and his love for for us the people and and just pray the Lord just blesses him and in a way amen Happy Father's Day Amen to all you fathers and and just pray the Lord blesses you um in a great way and just grants the desires of your heart amen and you are deeply appreciated and I want to look at first John the fourth chapter and before we go into reading uh may we just bow our hearts our heads and just talk to our Lord father where your children and we come humbly before you Lord with grateful hearts just thinking of the song that was sung there that the break in the prodigal that way that life the tradition and I'm so glad that you did it for us father we wouldn't be here today if it hadn't been for your grace and your mercy and father our hearts desires that you would continue to draw was closer to you I don't think that we could be drawn close enough father let it be that we get so close in love with you father that the world just loses its hold loses it's it's its pull upon his father that there would be no desire for it Lord that we could be totally in love with you father I pray that you would increase our faith this morning Lord Jesus would you come and speak to our hearts Lord you see what words that we would have to say in the thought Lord but I pray that you would come and you would just Minister Lord do every heart father bless every dad here Lord and I pray Lord that your spirit would just come Among Us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen first John the fourth chapter the fourth verse here and um but it says you are of God little children can you say that with me you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen lest you can be seated here this uh may be a a little odd um scripture reading for of Father's Day but um hopefully uh we can make sense of it and and I believe it would be applicable do what I have to say today and I want to address not only you fathers but every every man whether you are young and single and looking to be married or you might be married but as of yet don't have children or whatever but you know in in such days and times that we live there's there's so many things that I would like to pour my heart out uh and say to you Brothers um for one I I see that the um the the father's role within the family is diminishing manhood is being challenged fatherhood is being challenged in a in a great way or at least the way God designed it to be and um the world has practically done away with God what God has intended uh the family to be and as we've said and and you you all know but fatherhood today is just a figurehead father in the family has just become a figurehead and sad to say that confusion and perversion is becoming more predominant in the home and um you know the parents rights are being taken away uh gradually and um or it's been gradually it's now rapidly it seems to be speeding up and um you know we had our president um make the statement that all all children are our children they're not just anyones in particular they're our children and um there's this meaning behind that there there's a statement behind that and and so but in the beginning and I'm I'm just going to take my time and and these things you already know but I just want to bring to your remembrance but uh in the beginning God is the one who instituted marriage between man and woman and he designed it to where the man and woman wouldn't just live together um and and we the world too has forgotten that and this Young Generation has really forgotten that but God never intended for a man and woman to live together but he wanted them to live as husband and wife and he designed that husband and wife the first husband and wife that they should become one and the way he did that is he took the woman out of man he did not make her a separate entity but he took she is a byproduct of man and so she was Adam uh in feminine form ain't that right so God would take they the the feminist Spirit out of Adam and put that in in the woman and that's what woman is and so the first woman that come from man Adam when he sees her he gets this Revelation she is the Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone ain't that right and then he says they twain shall become one ain't that right and so that's the way God designed the start of any home was that they would become one not separate but one ain't that right and uh and and you know talking about I really enjoyed that song sister Kimberly the grace of God but but I I I say that it is also the grace of God that takes two people that have been separated that have that have maybe one has lived in Alaska and the other one has lived in in Maine or or in in Phoenix Arizona or whatever and and then they they somehow meet and and God agrees with that marriage and he makes them to one both having different backgrounds different upbringings different likings and and all that but in the end God designed it that that man and woman should become one ain't that right and and so God made it so that when a man Embraces a woman and takes her for his wife that she would make an imprint upon his heart and that no other woman can fit that print amen and so and and in our wedding vows we make the promise to love to honor and to cherish one another to support one another in sickness and in health in riches or poverty to cleave only to each other for as we both shall live ain't that right as long as we shall live and so these these men and women running around cheating on their you know their spouse now we know that is nothing but the devil it is nothing it's and and and Satan has got many traps out in this this world today to to draw a man and sadly save in a woman that draws them away from their marriage and their spouse and and before you know it they begin to have eyes for others and and such and such but we're seeing a lot of that in this evil age and one thing that we're we're not seeing is is commitment there is there's hardly any commitment uh uh toward one another now I'm going to say this more people are more men are committed to their jobs than they are their wife they're more committed to for money than they are their wife and their children they're more committed to to their their their Ambitions and and and their retirement than they are to the home and uh uh and we find it's it's the lack of love and and the prophet used the scripture where father would be against mother mother against father and children against the parents and and and and it just on and on and he says the reason why it's a lack of love the commitment love brings commitment it brings loyalty it brings it brings it makes it's sacrificial it it love is the main thing ain't that right but we we find that marriage is not as sacred as it used to be uh to to to many uh it has become just a fantasy uh uh especially those that have never been married and and looking in and it just becomes a fantasy in other words people imagine marriage to be something that it isn't right and and so they consider it a marriage to be a fix-all for all their problems and uh or they have this notion that once they get married it will change the one that they're going to marry for for better and and and but but they don't realize that marriage isn't to fix all marriage does not fix problems ain't that right and so we we find um uh you know I look at it if if dad and mom hasn't been able to change change him or her if the preacher hasn't been able to affect him or her and God hasn't been able to change uh him or her but uh but somehow they themselves feel like once they get married that they're they're able to fix things and you you you can't you you can't start uh with that uh marriage has plenty of disappointments along the road and uh and then the reality sets in and they find out that marriage isn't what they imagined it to be that they conjured it all up to be and and and uh uh and so and then then you find your divorce nurses and you find you know uh well today people don't even want to commit anymore they just shack up and live together and uh you know and and so uh and sad to say but our our nation is promoting them things there's more benefits if you just shack up than there is for the marriage and and so you you we're dealing with so much in this age and and so we're we're living in a time where the Prophet said and he preached the message uncertain sound and he said everything we're living in an age where everything is uncertain everything is uncertain and not only is the church not only his politics not only is is government and all these things uncertain not only is your future uncertain but uh in the future of of whatever but but uh uh also brother Brown said the American home life is uncertain the family is uncertain and he says a man marrying a wife it sure is a problem certainly is or a woman marrying a man it's certainly an uncertain thing they've even got it in the marriage ceremony now I take him for better or worse there's a question question on it see it's uncertain see be good to pray through on it don't you think so that would be better just pray through but it's uncertain homes are broke up remarriage constantly all the time uncertainty of home life and America leads the world in divorce cases and all the rest of the world America leads it and of course he's speaking years and years uh back but but we see it even more prominent in this age now I understand uh and I I you know you have to I guess make the Clause that uh uh there there's some maybe here or listening and in and and and you you your marriage has been messed up and and all these things and and maybe you were out in the world and got got messed all up and now you're back in church or whatever and and so you know that that there that's the grace of God and we understand there's Grace but but at the same time you know we are called to preach uh not the permissive will but we are to preach the perfect will because we got young young men young women that that need to walk in that perfect will of God and and so um uh but but how many men and women run around on their spouse because they've married for other reasons outside of Love they had their head in the clouds and their feelings and emotions got steered up and they didn't consider what God thought about it and I'm I'm gonna say this too but it's becoming more prominent men among these boys that they'll tell the girl that the Lord told me the Lord told me the Lord told me we're meant to be together the Lord said it and the Lord this I think them are cheap words yeah them are pretty cheap words um uh uh for one the Lord will tell her and the Lord will tell you and the Lord will tell I believe the Lord just works it all out it'd be in in both in in in the families and and so uh uh if if you feel like the Lord has told you then just keep your mouth shut and just and and and just continue to date and just let the Lord Do The Guiding and let the Lord do the leading but you don't have to go around making the Lord do something you don't have to put it in someone's head that the Lord said it and this is what it meant and now they're confused because they don't really know what to believe and and all that but I believe when the Lord speaks it is certain and he works on both ends don't you believe that he just works on both ends so uh but but uh young people they get their head in the clouds and their feelings and emotions and and all that and and and they think this is has got to be it and they never consider they never stop to pray they never really really anchor themselves in the word of God and really find out what God has to say about it and so uh brother Branham in talking to the young people he said you better pray a long time and ask God to give you a companion uh prayer is so important in these days and and the problem is young people they get in a hurry and become desperate instead of waiting on God but I believe God has the right one and and God knows what he's doing and and and and and these things but the sad thing is as parents encourage this as well never encouraging them to stop and to pray and and to wait and and and don't get into hurry on things and but it seemed like they want to push it and then they want to encourage it and they want to prod it and they want to go with it and and all of these things but but uh I I believe that that there there is a a a marriage that that that that can last and as long as God is in it ain't that right so God instituted Adam and Eve's marriage as we know but then afterward he told them to replenish and to multiply and and to be fruitful he replenish the Earth be multiply and be fruitful ain't that right in other words Adam was not just to become husband and live with his wife but he was actually to become father now and and and and Eve was to become mother and this was all in God's plans ain't that right now brother Branham really rebuked this age and this generation that they they they wanted to they wanted to get married uh or say or or live together or whatever uh but they wanted to raise a cat instead of a child they they wanted to raise a dog and and they wanted to raise whatever outside of children and and and he rebuked this generation because that's a sin can you say man you don't put your dog before your children you don't you don't baby your your animals before you do your children then you say amen and and and there's more than just providing uh a home or a roof over their head a man but but so they are to become father and mother and and they were to have children so not just to live together as husband and wife Psalms 127 3 says lo children are in Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward now I I looked up here at the Gen and the meaning of this word is possession property inheritance it's it's Heritage Property portion share uh so children are God's portion given to us as as as uh uh husband and wife dad and mom ain't that right I I don't believe that we uh uh should ever tell our children that you were a mistake you know uh it may have happened accidentally and well you may have not been planning to have a child but if God gave it to you that's God's portion to you in your home ain't that right and and so that we've got a generation that looks at children to be a nuisance and I've had them tell me you know oh just wait till your children become teenagers and boy they're going to be your problem I haven't found that yet now when I say that I understand there's troubles I understand teenagers got their issues and and sometimes I'm about to pull my hair out that I don't agree regret one of them I don't regret having my children you understand what I'm saying amen and and so but it goes on to say as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them amen I I say that you know I use it as I got my Quivers got spandex you know because I got seven of them you know and and but my my it's full you know uh someone had talked to me the other day said now you got 12 right and I said no seven oh oh okay she says well I I saw all your your children and your daughter-in-laws I said well they are my children too I can I I consider my my daughters as well and uh uh so yeah you know in that sense but uh anyways happy is the man that have his quiver full of them and they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate and and so uh uh man and his wife hard to have children and and now they become a a I'm going to say a family in in that way and and you know I I understand that uh uh some aren't able to have children and or as of yet here in the church and and uh you know but that that ain't you know I I just believe that's that's just the result of the devil uh that is afflicting the bodies and and we know brother Branham goes into that about the foods and such amen but I believe that you're still able brother Samaya amen and and to to plead God to God and and you to have a child amen I I believe it because it's God's word ain't that right amen and and we've seen it time again where God would uh open up the womb for a for a woman to where she could have children and and you know uh I'm thinking of brother Casto uh their pastoring just uh a few minutes away but uh uh married how many years and uh uh many many years not able to have children but they kept hanging on to a promise now they've got two of them so so God God has his timing ain't that right and and so we we find but but uh God intends for uh a family God wants family before the creation God uh was called Elohim as the prophet tells us which is the self-existent one he existed all alone and and these things but when he made man he made man in such a way not not in in in in in in the way that he would make animals and the trees and all the other creation Angels but he when he made man he said let us make man in our own image and and and and and so God says I am Yahweh uh uh Jehovah see and what did it mean I'm the all-existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine so God wanted a family and so he creates a son ain't that right a man or uh so so something all for myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine Oh Glory he said see Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God no longer itself existing existing alone amen but now he is Father existing with his family ain't that right he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family a man so he says in another place there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existing but now he exists with his family his little ones with him aren't you glad for that but aren't you glad that God is a father not like us and not like the world that is out he here that forgets them and and doesn't want responsibility for them and and wants to do his own thing but everything that God has done has been for his family he created this Earth for his family he graved the mountains and the deserts and the rivers and the The Valleys for his family ain't that right amen all Redemption plan was for his family a man see and so children children uh God considers children to be a blessing amen and and something of value for children are to carry on the family name uh and the lineage of the family and in many cases it's the children that carry on the family business and and and these things but that's on the natural side of it but but let's look on God's side on the other side of this God wants the Next Generation a man to learn of him and his ways so that they can preserve him can you say Amen now now I I want to say it because they're passing laws left and right they are trying to do with you away with the existence of family the way God intended it they're trying to do away with the existence of of healing and the power of God and Holiness standards and and and and and and and they're trying to bring perversion in and and and and infiltrate that in our children's minds and and all of these things how many agree with that you can see it on the news and they're pushing it it's getting in the stores it's now even the Dodgers uh uh baseball uh they had a big thing an hour before the game the other night celebrating uh uh they they had a drag queens dressed as Catholic nuns and and uh they they they had it on the soccer the other day and to wear they were Chan the fans were chanting uh explicit homosexual uh uh things to where the the referees had to cancel the game and close it off amen it's an agenda and they're pushing and there's they're pushing these things not only on their children but they're trying to put it on upon our children can you say amen amen but see God God has a children God wants children a man uh uh so he can he can he can carry on his power amen the testimony of God's uh uh healing power are to continue on how many believe that amen the the the deliverance and the of God's power and and the the experience of the Supernatural are to carry on they are to live out and if every one of us daddies go and US Mama's goal amen and our children remain God wants them to carry on them power we don't want the experience of God God to die with us amen I thought of uh brother Walker amen uh you know uh uh God didn't want just everything to die with him God didn't want it to die with brother praying him but there thank God there are a people still alive and well that are proclaiming and are experiencing the power and the experiences of God can you say Amen see so these experience of God the Supernatural and the divine power and healing and the gifts and all these they're not to die with the older generation they are to keep living and it's the Next Generation that is required to keep him alive I want you to understand that young people amen it's your generation you are responsible God has called you amen you say well I don't know you know you ain't got you you don't understand the problems I'm going through it does not matter God has called you anyways and that's why Satan is fighting you cold that's why Satan fights you all the time amen is because God's got something for you amen and he wants you he don't want you just sitting on a Pew and being raised in a message Church without the experiences but if God ever dealt with you at that tent meeting call and saved your soul it's because God's got a desire to use you in a greater way can you say amen amen see and yes you're going to fight these challenges you're going to fight things it's because the devil knows he's he's wanting you but God says no they're mine they're mine it's up to you generation you young people you're required you're part of this thing don't think that it's just the parents that are and the preacher and all that that's that's part of it you're part of this brother Bradham said each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word now we as the older generation are required to teach them not our government not Hollywood don't set them in front of movies and have them to brainwash our children don't sit there and let Hollywood and Fox News and NBC News and all of these things it brainwash our children and you say Amen don't send them to a library on their own and let them just get any old book there's books that'll teach about homosexuality there there's there's books that'll teach about perversion there there's there's books that'll teach about all kinds of things that our children doesn't need to know and we are responsible as as as parents to teach our children the way of God amen we're required to teach them Deuteronomy 4 7 for what nation is they're so great who have God so nigh unto them listen now he's not talking to any Nation he's talking to Israel a people and I say this I ask that question to us tonight today what people what people is they're so great who has God so nine to them foreign psychologists ain't got the answers for your children these psychologists unconverted on on you say Well they're Christian and they love the Lord if they're not in this message if they're not converted the way they need to be converted and I'm going to tell you only a bride member is gonna is the one that has the true conversion they're the one that has the oil in the lamps can you say man it's you mom and dads that's got the oil in your lamb it ain't Dr Dobson it ain't

to their ideas that may be good for a foolish virgin but it ain't good for you [Applause] for what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for now he's talking to Israel but I I'm I'm using this for you what nation is there so great that half the statues and judgments so righteous is all this law what people has a message so right and so Vindicated than us what nation is there so great that half the statues and judgment and so righteous is all this law which I set before you this day oh yes what a grace and mercy that God would assemble us together not just here in this morning but I'm talking worldwide and set a truth before us that has been clearly Vindicated what people are Israel like us only take heed to thyself and keep thy so diligently you listen now keep thyself and keep thy so diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thine heart all the days of our life don't you let this message become common don't you let it just set on the bookshelf don't you let it the world get a hold of you to where you don't where the world the message doesn't affect you anymore can you say amen God has called you out of this thing God has called you out of the the world and the traditions and denominations Amen to set his truth before you you're different you boys are different you girls are different parents are different preachers were different lest they depart from thine heart all the days of the life but teach them everybody say teach them teach them thy sums and thy son sums teach them don't let television teach them don't let comic books teach them don't let the comedians teach them told my boy the other day you know it's time you get away from all that comedy common ain't going to help you overcome it ain't gonna help you I don't get you say whether it's Christian it's not going to help you overcome the day that you're living in [Music] if comedy was it he would have brought us a comedy comedian but he brought us a prophet to whom the word comes to amen amen but teach them thy sons and thy Sons Sons especially today the day that thou stood us before the Lord thy God in horb when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth that they may teach their children what a responsibility God tells them you're special in my eyes but not only you are your children are and their generation after them amen I've called you amen not just for today I've called you to serve me throughout your Generations [Music] all the feasts all the sacrifices all the Commandments that God instituted in the Old Testament were to be kept and to be preserved by the children and the way they would be taught and preserved is by the Elder the older generation teaching the younger generation and they would be reared in knowing the children would be reared in knowing amen the principles of God the institution of God the way God wanted things to be and then they were required to teach their children you with me of course it was sad that it become a tradition to her when the true Messiah come no one knew him but oh God we're living in an hour this is the age we're not looking for generations to come this is the generation of the Lord coming are you with me now this is a generation this is the generation and God forbid that the Revival die with you God forbid that it dies with me you know I read to you last Wednesday night that brother Brown said historically every Revival only lasted three years he said but this this revival hasn't lasted now or hasn't ended in three this this has gone on and on and it will continue as long as there's people you say well that God will always do it no he's dependent upon you he's dependent upon you do you believe that he already had a predestinated seed before the foundation world but he raised up preachers he raised up parents he raised up somebody to carry that word and to teach it whether it's behind this Pulpit whether it's out on the streets whether it's at your home wherever the word of God is to be taught you cannot let the Revival die [Music] amen as long as the Lord tarries and time continues it will be through our children that God lives this is why we dedicate them to the Lord they are his they were his in the first place and he blessed them us with them he gave them to us and then we in return give them back to him but with that dedication we're dedicating Our Lives to that child we're committing ourselves to that child we're not saying Lord okay here you are you take him and we pray that you just bless him and he'd be a preacher and she be a Sunday school teacher or whatever and then we just go do our own thing and leave it to the Lord no you commit yourself to that child you see I can say it this way our children were not born for the devil's enjoyment you believe that and I'm going to tell you you you you young men you young women whether you have small children or whether you ain't got any yet you better keep that in mind they're not given to you for the devil's enjoyment they are not born to be used as the devil's Pawn you with me God gave them to us they our ours not the devils and then we in return give them to God they are Gods Not the devils can you say amen and I don't want the devil now they're going to have enough influence out in that world Amen and so therefore it's my job as a parent to make sure there's a right atmosphere in that home and the devil ain't got a chance with them they are our family you believe it can you say it with me my children are my family where they build your children are yours amen the prophet Isaiah prophesied in Isaiah 65 19. speaking of the Millennium and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying what a day that'll be eh there shall be no more sense an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall build plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat and the prophet stops there and says in other words his son take it and his son see in other words the father built the home and the son takes it because he's died but he says no the sun will be right there living with him family children for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long and joy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth uh for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring everybody say my Offspring their offspring with them Put The Offspring there can you say Amen yes sir see now if you notice I hope this is all right but if you'll notice the family must have structure the family has to have structure structure in other words it it is to be constructed this word constructed is to make or form by combining or arranging parts or elements so like when a man builds builds a house he is constructing it he puts he puts boards in the place where they belong where they need to go ain't that right now in the Bible the word family is house or house is family it's household Genesis 7 1 and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and all thy house thy family into the ark so so Noah's house was his family and he all went into the ark right Proverbs 14 1 Every Woman every wise woman buildeth her house her family but the foolish plucket that down with her hands Psalms 127 and one except the Lord build the house amen accept the Lord build the family they labor in vain that build it you say man so then the Lord has to have the preeminence in the family the family must be built under his leadership you believe it serve for as as in Zechariah I believe it is where the Lord said not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord the family must be built by his spirit then the building of the family must be sanctioned by him by God you believe it therefore it's not just my prerogative the way just to build my family the way I think they should go run my family the way it should what I think it should be God must sanction this family you see every son and daughter of God is God's family and he's the one that's building them but that does not give us the freedom as parents just to run free and Wild it does not mean that the natural family is left to the devices of carnal thinking carnal man carnal understanding there's a lot of good families and yet them families are not constructed by God it's true good parents that love their children it's not established on biblical principles the way God designed the family to be so therefore the family must be constructed according to God's blueprint Matthew 7 24 Jesus says therefore whosoever heareth thee sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock the rain descended the floods came the winds blew beat up on that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock now I'm going to just tell you right now the floods are here every demon power is pouring in now it's invading the rich the poor educated the dumb the skinny the fact the tall the short The Talented the not so talented it's invading everything right and the rain descended the floods came and blew the winds blew and beat up on that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that here at these things of mine and doeth him not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came the winds blew and beat up on that house and it fell and not only did it fall but great was the fall of it and you say man see so this tells us that a man must build right if his if he wants his work to last ain't that right and the foundation of a man's house must be built on the revelation of Jesus Christ God is Not only to have preeminence in the church but he's to have preeminence in the family the natural family as well as the spiritual family and those who are part of his Spirit spiritual family will build the natural according to God's design and purpose why because they have their spirit in them his spirit is dominating them his spirit is controlling them people want to separate the church from the family separate the church from their own personal you can't do that you come to church don't know how to live as an individual you come to church to know how to live as parents you come to church to know how to live as children to live as a family to live as an employee to live as an employer you come to church I mean the Bible talks about it all yes ain't that right now so let's look at the family structure and this is where it rubs a lot of wrong I don't think it here in in the building but just popular opinion and belief but man is to be the head of the house if you're wanting a right structured family according to God's design man is the head of the home and he's not just to behead of his house but of his entire family ultimately this puts a great responsibility Upon Us daddies Upon Us husbands the shoulders way heavy with responsibility or it should we have great responsibility more than we realize I think as the head of the home we are to be the provider for our family as the head of the home we are to be protector of our family we are to be the breadwinners ain't that right God made man this is the reason why God made man in in a different way than he made woman I don't care what them transgender says I don't care what those homosexuals and our government and our whatever else God made man and woman to be different he gave man a masculine Spirit he gave woman a feminist Spirit women are not they are not to have a masculine disposition woman isn't made to be rough and tough and manly hello amen Prophet said God made her to be dainty and sweet like real Christian sisters are and God didn't make a man to be a pretty boy amen hello the world Hollywood and all these fashion designers want to take our boys and make sissies out of them and make them look like sissies with these tight jeans and these skinny shirts and real tight shirts and these little old hairdos and and and and then the limb their the Risco limp and all that that's nonsense reach Brothers talked about the fashion of the world the woman isn't to be a just he didn't preach just against a woman living like the Fashions the world you meaning to be fashionable either not like the world brother Brown said a woman's supposed to be a woman she's supposed to dress like a woman when God made a man he made him one thing and he made woman something else when God dresses a man he dresses him one way and a woman something else and the Bible says it's an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man can you say Amen brother Brown says man is becoming more sensified every day and women is becoming more masculine every day God forbid that our children raised up that way and see Daddy and Mama being perverted in their ways brother Abraham said you man you dress like a man don't try to be a and wear women's clothes and women don't you try to be masculine and wear men's clothes because God don't want you to do it and the Bible condemns that now how many believes we got the true answers we got the true answer the way we should live [Music] see the family must have structure but it must be built according to God's design brother Branham talk to when Melchizedek came to visit Abraham and he said this he said Sarah being a little Pentecostal sister stayed back in the tent to take care of her business you say what was her business brother Brown said she was in the tent cooking and he says far different from our modern sisters of today he said don't it make you feel bad when you know Men start talking and women come right out and butt right in he said it's kind of rude so a woman has her place in the home but us men have our place in the home you believe it now I I have to tell you for both of us uh men and and sisters and brothers uh men didn't decide to be the head of the home they didn't choose to be the head of the home actually it was God that made them the head of the home and whether a man wants to or not he's going to be responsible before God for his home ain't that right so we didn't design that decide to do it God made us to be that way and and so brother Branham and talking to the husband said you're supposed to be the ruler of the house and God will hold you responsible for what your wife does amen so a man he says is the head of the family he's the head of the house but today the woman's the head of the house head of the factory head of the church and everything else it's because it's become a conglomeration of sin this pastor ain't led by women this church ain't lit by women the nation may be led by women and and other men's homes may be led by women but you're to be the man of the house man it's got to be the right structure so therefore again the responsibility lays with on us and we are to be the provider uh for the needs of our family we are to protect our family at all costs brother Brown said any true real true dad and husband will think of his family first before himself I'm gonna say that again any true real true dad and husband will think of his family be first before himself now having said that we're going to go into some little Rough Waters but I hope you're with me not only are we to be the protector on the natural side that we are to be protector on the spiritual side we are to be we are responsible for the spiritual well-being of our family you with me Hebrews 11 and 7. by faith Noah being warned who was warned Noah he was the head man being warned of God of things not as not seen as of yet but he moved with fear prepared an ark for the saving of his house family you see Noah being the head of the home had a vision of the future of what was coming down the pike the wrath of God was going to be poured out upon the land and the people but God also gave vision and Noah a vision of a way of Escape you're with me I'm gonna stop here for just a moment but do you realize there's a lot of people knowing that judgment's coming but they have no way of Escape they don't know the way of Escape they have rejected the way of Escape right but no one caused him to move with fear and build the ark for his family and it was in mind ain't Iraq so he wasn't one of these modern dads that are carried away with the entertainment of the day he was an all wrapped up in money and retirement job he wasn't a dad that was caught up with all the materialistic things that life had to offer the future mattered to him and his family mattered to him if God gave him a plan for escape why not use it now we are children or fathers and mothers amen a people that have a vision of the wrath of God come and we see it we can tell you what's happening in politics we can tell you what's happening in the church we can tell you what's happening all over in the American home and around the world we're not a people that are confused but we also have a way of Escape ain't that right that's right so therefore God doesn't just call us out and give us this Plan of Redemption of a way of Escape for us used to be oh cared about with everything else you realize the it's Hollywood that's damning this nation it's these preachers that won't preach truth that's bamming these needs this world do you realize it's homes that have rejected the word of God that's damning this generation amen [Music] you remember the Bible says because they had not a love for the truth God sent them strong delusion that they believed a lie and be damned again you say Amen because they had not a love for the knowledge of that truth because they did not honor God God turned them into reprobates God turned their minds and twitched to them in such a way amen and that they and gave them everything to fulfill the lusts but we're not called to be that mm-hmm I pray God will help us to realize that all this entertainment that people are falling in love with what is it doing to them they're forgetting the paths of God they're forgetting the way of God their hearts are becoming so consumed and they're fulfilling what the Bible says Lover's a pleasure more than lovers of God and if you don't love God you will never believe in his provided way you'll never act upon his provided way that he has given for safety amen amen great but Noah was thinking of the future he was thinking of his family their responsibility was upon him therefore he built the ark for the saving of his household can you imagine children imagine children in this age growing up without the right kind of vision in the home imagine children being raised up in church but yet don't have the right kind of vision come on church it's true now can you imagine people growing up children being raised up all they know is the preacher takes too long all they know is the music ain't right I have the time all they know is the church ain't run right half the time all they know is there's there's someone out there better I wish I wish there was something better we could go I wish there was this I wish there was that and that's all the children raise up to know they don't have confidence in the preaching they don't have confidence in the singing they don't have confidence in the musician they don't have confidence in nothing freedom amen but we will give him confidence in movies we give them confidence in the ball game we give them confidence in the world entertainment give them confidence in their retirement that ain't guaranteed you could die tomorrow and all that time you miss church to come amen for your job all that time you miss prayer and all that time you miss the things of God you could be having that amen and meet with God you ain't got no time guaranteed you none of us has got time [Music] I thought it was a little girl brother Andrew was telling me went to he went to a funeral yesterday for a 14 year old girl raised up in a message Church her daddy was a FedEx driver still dancing they were they were just close so I won't go to work with you he said no you can't go work mama says no no she didn't you don't need to go to work today now I want to ride with you so Dad reluctantly gave in to her riding down just riding down doing his job everything right turn the curve and she fell out broke her neck killed her instantly now what I'm saying is life ain't guaranteed us right 14 year old girl what if she was raised up not respecting the preacher not respecting the church not respect to nothing all consumed in the world and entertainment you understand what I'm saying I pray for that that family but her husband said her daddy sat on the front row amen that preacher he was an aide to the pastor he was a help constantly helping supporting whatever he could do that's the way the girl learned you understand what I'm saying honor God now Matthew 6 33 Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you you see seek ye first everybody say seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness teach your family to seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added now now notice brother Brandon after reading that says all material material Necessities everybody say necessities now now the Necessities ain't ones necessity is what you have need of all material Necessities will be added unto us can you say Amen so he says in another place any Christian will think of others before himself every Christian tries to put God first his family second he's number three in another place he says people of God are not Material minded they are christ-minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they are they seek those which are above it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy whether they are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus day it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not true today for the laodicean age is one of vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich the church is in Goods but how important Spirit blessed it be ye poor see for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink it is not Material it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things of course this this this kind of talk is is foreign to the world because of the desire for materialistic wealth and they tend to think that we're not balanced they tend to think we're out of our heads but brother Branham said this we have more wealth than we ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually now I'm going to try to wrap this up the Revelations 2 and 9 says I Know Thy Works God talking to that age I Know Thy works that tribulation and poverty and then brother Branham comments on what the spirit is actually saying all Christ the spirit I see your poverty I see your need you haven't very much if anything to boast of materialistic things see what you did have has been taken from you you gladly gave up your possession in exchange for Eternal ones you are laughed at you are scorned you don't have material resources to fall back on but you are rich in spite of it all for your security lies in him who is your shield and exceeding great reward ain't that right now there's nothing against wealthy people some of God's people are wealthy but it isn't not money with money that God works that's what the prophet says he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word and you say man now if you allow me just a little bit more time as as I get ready to close but being the head of the home it's not all about bossing everyone Brother Brad said man's not measured by muscles that's Beast Brute man's measured by character and if you're a Son of God you're measured by your character now there are two sides to everything one side of it there are men who let anything and everything go within the family he has no vision for the family all he knows he got married and had children but he has no vision for the family he has no true relationship with his wife because he's constantly gone Galley bouting in everything that he wants to do that poor woman stays home with the kid trying to discipline trying to do everything else I want to say this don't you realize men that you're women you're you're women we're not Mormons your wife fights goes through things the devil attacks her in her mind the devil tells her just just a lot of times maybe we feel lousy about life and we feel like we ain't an accomplishment the devil fights her on the same things she ain't a good mother ain't a good wife she ain't doing things right and ain't doing this and while we're all out Galloping around the devil's playing with her mind but see he has no vision for the family he has no true relationship with the wife and he's not involved in his children's life the wife has left to make all the decisions and in many cases the children are left to make their own decisions left to their own devices and and I I'm just going to be true you can take it whatever you want to that's fine but that's the way the devil wants it [Applause] he wants to diminish the role of the father he wants to diminish the role of headship in the home to where we make the weaker vessel the head of the home the Bible calls the woman the weaker vessel is that right so the devil she's easy more easily convinced than a man is she's more easily swayed than a man is great she's more emotional than a man is and the devil knows how to attack the home so many times dad is too busy doing his own things fulfilling his own dreams and today it's become more you know uh uh then just going to work and providing for the family it's become a crave for materialistic things we are to provide for our family but when a spirit gets a hold of a man to where he's got to have more than what he what he want has and it causes him to forsake his role as head of that home something wrong today's success is defined as to having wealth and materialistic things the average family is too busy trying to keep up with the rest of the world if our neighbors or friends have it we want it too we get a new bowl last year we want one today a new one it's it's we're thriving our joy only comes by the things we get things we purchase our money and we've lost the happiness in our children we lose the happiness in our wife and I'm going to be honest with you it's created in an unhappy unsatisfied atmosphere within the home mother is unhappy father is unhappy children are unhappy brother REM said happiness does not consist of how much of this world's Goods you own it's how contented you are with the portion that's allotted to you that's what happiness means find Christ and you've got happiness there's a lot of men make a decent living but they got to have more there's something that drives them it could be that they're driven by their own lusts they could be that the wife is driving them to have more it could be that he is persuaded that him being able to give his family what they want in this world's Goods is all that is required of him well it's not on the other side of the coin there are men who think being the head of the home means that everyone within the home needs to somehow render obesians to them they're the king of the house and demand recognition as that they don't recognize the wife as being the queen of the home they just treat her any old way they don't care what the children do as long as they acknowledge Him as being the head and do what he does and and if he commands them to do this they they they do it they ask how high or jump you know they ask how high wait and yet no spiritual headship whatsoever we make sure our children learn how to work love but never teach them faithfulness to the house of God you understand what I'm saying so they take on this attitude do as I say not as I do they want everything their way because they are the head of the whole you know if you look at the structure of God as I get ready to close but as you look at the structure that God has for the home the structure of the home does not end everybody say it does not end with man being the top dog I know that hurts our pride but it's true God's design for the home is not man being Top Dog First Corinthians 11 3 but I would have you know that the head of every man is who's Top Dog who's the head so who's actually the head of the home Christ is the head of the home can you say Amen but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so then we understand that us brethren we have a headship woman has her headship but we have our headship and as the woman is responsible to to a her husband so are we responsible to our Lord as the woman is to submit to her headship so is the man to surrender to his headship and you say man you love the Lord and as the woman brings confusion in the home because she does not surrender to her to hit you up she's going to do her own thing have her own bank account have her own this and have her on this and have her on that and have her on that and man your husband don't you touch any of this this is my stuff and now whatever you got belongs to me too what a home men trying to bring water in the home as long as well I'm going to do my own thing making our own plans and her own this and her own that the husband's just barely hanging in there that brings confusion to the whole time amen but let's take it to the men You Gonna Do Your Own Thing when the word says not to word says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even the morning but I don't care I'll go hunting I don't give a hoot I'm gonna do my own thing I'll go I can go fishing I'm gonna go work I don't care that's the attitude you play you're bringing the same confusion and then we want peace in the home we we want an atmosphere in the home we want God to fight our battles but we totally ignore the headship we want God to respect our prayers it's true so you you see you you just have to forgive me but a man that doesn't want to take any kind of responsibility of raising and training his children is selfish I don't care if it's in the natural sense or the spiritual sense you are obligated we as fathers and I am talking to this and I'm not saying you're not so so so I'm just I'm I'm encouraging you because Satan is fighting us on tooth and nail he is fighting us on every hand trying to bring our hands down and weaken us that I'm telling you it's not just our responsibility to take care of our family in the natural it is the spiritual side too a man that requires his family to obey him and yet uses his god-given position for his own gain is selfish there are men in this world that are great providers for their family they are great Protectors of their family when it comes to a natural enemy there are great interactors with the family when it comes to sports and hunting and fishing and entertainment and all of that there's there's fathers that are great fathers in all of that sure but when it comes to the spiritual things the family suffers because most men have no interest in spiritual things work and pleasure takes the preeminence over Church attendance entertainment takes the preeminence over prayer life the world has more appeal than does a consecrated life can you say Amen now I know I know that that we are helpless to make our family Christians our children Christians and all that and and each each member of our family has to have an experience with the Lord for themselves we cannot help what our children do when they grow up uh and and leave the house and all these things but but I got to tell you but that does not diminish your responsibility and how important you as a father are in your home even when your children leave you're still important this is all right we learned that by job's action the Bible said job was a man that was perfect and upright and one that feared God and issued evil he knew words he he shunned evil and this is what every young lady should look for in a man the husband job had seven sons and three daughters here's what the Bible says Job 1 and 4 his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone is day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually he didn't do it just one time he did it continually his children was out out of the home that he that was stand before God for his family God just in case just in case they have done something to the sin against you I'm going to offer a sacrifice for them can you say man brother Brown said see his children got married and went off in different ways and as they do like birds from a nest job knowing that there was no other way not a possible way that man could ever approach God and have fellowship with him see only through the sacrificial lamb to the blood see job said per Adventure my children might have sinned I'll offer a lamb for them Something Told job he had better make it ready he'd better be ready see he felt that urgency I've got offer for them church I hope you daddies and mamas feel the urgency of today hey man I hope we feel that urgency and he said and then when he made the offering for the sacrificial lamb for his children one day it happened one day it happened the storms come and killed them all in Fire and so forth and took them but before this happened job made sure that each one was under the blood hey man another place brother Brown said job was mindful of his children to make a preparation for their sin and father and mother if we would quit spending money on our children learning tap dancing and things like that and some kind of how to be an actor and put more time a pleading the blood of Jesus up over them and showing them love and fellowship we'd get along better the child would too teach your child see I believe if every parent would take their child see the first the parent come back to God and take the beer out of the ice box take the cards off the table oh you say it's innocent you see what it hatches out brother I wouldn't let a card light on my ground no sir it's it's the devil's thing keep them away from it you say your old-fashioned brother Branham well it was an old-fashioned gospel that saved me it's an old-fashioned salvation that makes me happy it was an old-fashioned holy ghost that healed me it's the same that's going to take us home to Glory sure teach your child see looky here look what the world can do now this little clean thing this little clean things I suppose I ain't I ain't got nothing do with it but looky here every kid in town could tell you who Davy Crockett was my it's on his teaspoon on his hat on his tie it's everywhere Davy Crockett see the world taught the children see everybody or America buy a fad taught All The Children See About Davy Crockett and they wanted to do it all today with other things too it's just a ad and that and that and see the world taught the children see they could tell you he was from Tennessee when he was born and all about it he wore a skin hat and killed a bear when he was a three you know all these kind of fiction things they they know all about David Crockett see and you're willing and like to tell him about it see well if if they could learn about Davy Crockett and dress like Davy Crockett and act like Davy Crockett surely you could teach them about Jesus Christ and they would act like Jesus Christ and love Jesus Christ as well as they could love David Crockett see Fellowship around the Bible tell them Jesus loves them see Davy Crockett is true but now killing that bear that three years old I doubt that see a lot of those things he believed a lot of fiction a lot of them stories are fiction here when I was a little boy I had such an admiration for William Tell he shot an apple off his boy's head see when I got down in Switzerland there's not a word of a truth it was all fiction see that's right there was a William Tell true see but he never shot no apple off his boy's head nothing about that but it's fiction stories that's told let's get the truth to the people let's not fellowship with that let's fellowship with God and with the Bible and with the Holy Spirit make preparations for our children is this all right brethren we are not miracle workers We Are Men of like passion we are men that fight discouragements we are men that goes through things mind battles Temptations we are men that just common flesh and blood men we fall got to get back up tell you what we're facing an enemy that we in our own selves we we we can't defeat Satan's more than a match for each of us you're God's placed us as the head of our home and yet the enemy is more than a match for us can you imagine what the enemy is to your wife and your children but God made it that way and this is why I would read that scripture in the beginning our opening scripture greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world you are a god little children see our strength is in him our help is in the Lord our answer is in him you may not know what to do but if you just rely upon him how we need men a prayer how we need men of dedication and consecration how we need fathers that'll know what it is to get alone with God and pray you say well I take my family on vacation that's not the answer oh that helps for a little bit maybe it gets you away from your problems but that's just as good as television and books and all that there's guys that I loved reading books and it takes my mind off of things and all that but when the book is done it's I'm back to troubles my mind's back in it you understand what I'm saying you know how the devil does this and we can get into entertainment we can go this we can go to Honolulu every every week your troubles are still there you ain't the answers what's the answers is God the answer says God can you say man and God has called us to be leaders as head of our home God has called us to be leaders and and leaders do not follow behind leaders and leaders don't just say do this do that do this but as the as the prophet told us leaders he described it in the Jeffersonville the fire fire department and and the the Louisville remember there's that big old house fire whatever it was and there's the Jeffersonville Department squirt a little Waters over here boys squirt a little water over here wasn't a thing you know but here comes that Louisville Department of boys barely didn't even get stopped and the chief was on top of that ladder that's it follow me boys and within minutes they got the fire out it shows what a true leader is follow me family follow me you want to know what it is follow me I'll show you as the head of the home as Leaders of our family you want to know where the power of God is follow me I'll show you I ain't gonna direct you over here you ain't gonna follow me out in the world you ain't gonna follow me into all these entertainments you ain't gonna follow me I I ain't gonna lead you into all these other things I'm going to lead you right back to God we're the power of God is we're the angels of God are pleased to come down in our home and sanctify and sanction Our Lives can you say Amen if the musicians will come brother Brown said we have a home life crisis it seems like the home life is running out into shallow water it used to be in a home that father the head of the house would sit down of a morning and would speak with this family and would and they would all take out the family old Family Bible and read just a little bit and all gather around the table and have prayer you don't see that no more and when the day was done and Maul was had the dishes washed they'd all Gather in and read some more of the Bible and pray before going to bed juvenile juvenile delinquency certainly it was a hard thing to find in them days the boys all went to the fields to work the girls helped mom with the washing all down at the creek but today we just push a little button and the dishes are all done and Maul's in the car and gone to the card party or out she's ratting around over the streets the work's done by a tractor we just don't have nothing but a bunch of lazy Idol people and home life is so neglected till the Bible is laid back so they'd have to hunt for an hour to find one in many homes in America you know and this is what we're facing I say to you that Satan has conquered most American families today you hear that phrase The Last of the Mohicans were that last were the last and this explains the Mind battles that you go through this explains the pressures that were fighting let's just explains why Satan wants to get our spirit and so riled up [Music] it's in these times that we got to find a place alone dads husbands get along with God you say well I try I can't feeling how long have you stayed there 10 minutes five minutes what about standing until you hear God Speak till you get the answer God help us all from this preacher all the way to the back door God help us all can you say man you love the Lord you see Ephesians 6 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places so you see as fathers we're realizing we realize in this age that our wife is fighting more than just physical battles our children are fighting more than just natural battles it's it's it's it's it's it's an enemy it's not flesh and blood it's it's an enemy that's trying to come in and and divide the family separate the family destroy us get us in a carnal state can you say man God bless you and again I say Happy Father's Day to you all thank God for you fathers you husbands that are still standing Stan endure to the end don't give up don't make irrational decisions do you pray through because it affects

are growing up so fast time is moving swiftly it's hard to believe that we're in 2023 already it's hard to believe that we're almost done with that year halfway through oh God help us to take it serious how about we just pray unto him father you see every hand that was raised you know every heart some of the things that we've said may have been rough and Lord it wasn't meant to hurt the Lord
