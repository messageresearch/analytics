Well, aren't you glad you have found a refuge? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. What would we do? Amen. If we didn't have him to That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; hide in and protect us. Amen. And so thankful to the Lord for that. Amen. The musicians can be dismissed. And certainly good to be here. Amen. In the house of the Lord. and trust you had a good day today. Praise the Lord. Uh if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to the book of John, the 14th chapter. And um just like to remind you about the fall festival uh coming up there in November 2nd. And um we're going to uh do something different uh this year. We're going to change the time to 10:00 instead of 11. And um I've uh been asked to do that every year and I keep forgetting uh to announce it. And so um anyway, so u we'll be having starting the service this year at at 10 on the fall festival. Also, brother Wayne uh Lawson be with us. the 19th through the 21st of December. And so we want to remember that as well. Amen. Before we go into the word, may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord. Precious Father, we're so thankful that we have a refuge in you, Lord. You made yourself available, Lord, and not driving us away as you did there in the garden when man had sinned, but you've made a way, Lord, that we could come and you're welcoming us to eat of the tree of life. And we're so thankful that we can today, Lord. Just asking that you would move among us tonight. take what simple words we'd have, Lord, to speak. And you know what's on my heart and I pray, Lord, that you would just bless your people, those that are sick and not able to be here. I pray that you would just touch them. Father, we just ask it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. So we want to look at uh John the 14th chapter and uh the first verse it says, "Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. Amen. You can have your seats. And um good to have brother Amos and sister Lisa back with us and heard they had a good service. So we thank the Lord for that over the weekend. And um uh going to use the title again. Uh there is a place prepared for me and um you know I'm so glad that we have a place to go and I'm looking forward to that time. And so in our opening scripture, Jesus is letting the believer know that u that there is life after death. And so but he starts out by saying, "Let not your heart be troubled." &gt;&gt; And I don't think that he wants our heart troubled tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he's then he lets us know that he's going to prepare for our future. Amen. And um he says I go to prepare a place and it wasn't that he went to a place called Texas now that known as Texas or a place now known as Maine or uh or some other continent or whatever uh here in the world uh where he went this place could not be accessed. test by boat or plane or train, automobile or what whatever it would be. But the Bible says that he was taken up. He was taken up and received uh uh and a cloud received him out of their sight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Bible says that the angels appeared to the disciples and said, "Why gaze you into the heavens?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't anything uh that man could make that took him to this place. But yet, he went because it's it's another world. It's a it's another place. The Bible mentions a few times of the world that is to come. Jesus said if a man speaks against the Holy Ghost uh of what has been done in this day as we know that it will not be forgiven him in this world or the world to come. &gt;&gt; Right? In Paul's writings, we see that a man can taste the word of God and the powers of the world to come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's that's what Paul would tell us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so then there's a there's a world that is is different from what we are used to. uh and and so Jesus would say in my father's uh uh kingdom are many palaces and if it were not so then I would not have told you I go to prepare a place for you. So, so in my father's kingdom, it isn't in in the kingdom of man, it's it's the father's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and in that kingdom are many palaces and and these things. So, uh uh where Christ has gone to has nothing to do with this world, right? &gt;&gt; Uh the place that he has prepared for us. uh this place is in the world to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so uh and and the prophet says we enter into this world at the end of the road at at the end of of this life, our journey, then we enter into this world. And so if you of course our opening scripture we read there in John 1 through3 he's talking about uh let not your heart be troubled. I I go to to prepare a place I will come back and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be there also. Then if you go down to the 27th chapter, John 14:27, Jesus says, "Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth." &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and then then he says uh uh not as the world giveth give I unto you, let not your heart be troubled, &gt;&gt; neither let it be afraid. saying the same again. Let not your heart be troubled. I'm I'm going to leave my peace with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. This this peace isn't going to be with what the world gives and and through entertainment and through uh money and materialistic things and uh uh these things and and so brother Brandon would tell us there is no peace to a troubled heart. Amen. So you cannot have peace and have a troubled heart. Amen. So he's telling us don't don't have a troubled heart. I'm going to leave you with my peace. I'm going to give you my peace. Amen. So you won't have a troubled heart. Amen. And and he speaks words of peace. Amen. U and the prophet says this. This is why he tells the disciples, he tells the believers, uh, uh, I'm going to prepare a place and I'm going to come back and receive you unto myself that where I am, you may be there also. He's saying these things. Amen. Because he doesn't want us to think about anything else. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He He doesn't want us to think about anything else. We are to keep our minds on these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't look to the left. Don't look to the right. Don't Don't get your mind bogged down with with the worldly things. Amen. There's a future. And I'm telling you, there's a future. You've got a future. Amen. And it's not in this life. It's it's it's life after death. It's a in another world that is to come. And that's what I want you to think about. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and so this is his comfort to the believer. Now, in in that same chapter, Jesus promised to send the Holy Ghost to be our comforter. Ain't that right? So, he starts out uh don't let your heart be troubled. He tells us what he's going to do. And he just keeps on laying there of of what what he's going to do. Now, I don't want you I'm going to leave you my peace. So, don't let your heart be troubled. Don't let it be afraid. I am going to leave you a comforter. I'm going to send my comforter uh back uh uh unto you. And we know that the Holy Ghost is our comforter. How many believes that it it's our comforter? Amen. See, and and so uh u uh you know, so he sends us the the the best comforter. I if there was any other way to comfort us, if there was any better way of comforing his people, he would have sent it. But he sends us the best that he could and that is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why if you don't have the Holy Ghost, you need him. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you're looking to other things for peace, then you need the Holy Ghost because God God never promised, Amen. that we we should have comfort in the in words of doctors. Amen. Because there's going to be times the doctor's going to be limited. There's going to be time doctors ain't ain't going to know what to do. But but you should never lose comfort. Amen. And and when the doctor says we don't know what to do, you're going to die. You're you're this. You'll always be this. See, and and we're not to to find comfort in in whether we have money or what the president does and and cheap prices and and and quality things or or whatever. See? Amen. If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you need him. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so because Jesus said in John 14:26, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance. See, whatsoever, now listen, what is he going to bring to your remembrance? Whatsoever things I have said unto you. Ain't that right? Amen. So, he's he's he's given them words of peace. He's telling them what the future is to every believer now. Now, it's not just to the disciples. He's he's laying this out to every believer. And then he says, I'm going to send the Holy Ghost to comfort you. And he's going to bring remembrance to your remembrance the things that I have said to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Paul says, "We have not received the spirit of the world, but we have received the spirit which is of God, which which come from God, which is a part of God." We'll say it. Which is God. Amen. That we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Ain't that right? That we might know the things or be reminded of the things that Christ has talked about that the Bible has spoke of. Amen. Of the things that are freely given to us. Now, when this life is over, Amen. Jesus is letting us know that when this life is over, there there is a life that we go to, &gt;&gt; that we enter into. And the prophet said it's a continuing of this same life in another world in in another place. See? Amen. But what is in that place is new. Amen. That place is new. That world, the world in which we live. Amen. Today, now, present tense is is is called the old world. It it's it's the old world. There is an old earth and and an old heaven. Amen. And and the word old uh can mean the length of its existence. You know, uh uh the the the longer I live, I'm the older I'm getting. And and so we could call this world uh it's old. We can look at it by consider it old by the length of ex existence or it can also mean former. Amen. Former. Amen. Something in the past that's no longer continuing. Like you may, you know, uh uh may maybe you you had a old girlfriend before you got married or whatever and and she's a former that that's a former girlfriend. former, you know, or or maybe you once, you know, uh uh my former pastor passed away, you know, and and and he's no longer my pastor or or whatever or a former church or whatever, but it's something that used to be in in in your life, but it's no longer there. Used to be. See? And and so uh uh true believers know what the word old means. Amen. See, you you can be a teenager or an adolescent and know the meaning of the word old if you are a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because 2 Corinthians 5:17, it says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things, everybody say old things. &gt;&gt; Former things are passed away, and behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Romans 6:4. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death. That like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father, even so, we also should walk in newness of life. So, if we're walking in newness, then there's an old life that we have left behind. There's a formal life that that we used to identify with, but now we're walking in newness of life. Ain't that right? So, after John was caught up on the Lord's day and I uh in really this day, he he saw he says, "I I saw a new heaven and a new earth." See, a a new heaven. So, so then that tells us that the old heaven was passed away, &gt;&gt; right? the old earth was passed away. And and he and he he saw that these things were passed away. And and so the the the the prophet said the old heaven, the old earth gives way to the new. Ain't that right? He said if we're to have a new earth, the old earth and the new earth cannot exist at the same time. Now, this is something that should comfort uh comfort our hearts. Amen. the things that that we're we're living in now, Amen. is is part of the old because we know that it's going to pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the old and the new cannot cannot exist at the same time. The new world and the old world cannot exist. There can't be two world orders together at the same time. Now, in order to get the new earth, he says the old one has to die. Now if the old one has to die then it's giving birth painans for a new one right now. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; If you look at John 21 and1 uh it says I saw uh a new heaven and new earth for the first heaven the first earth were passed away. There was no more sea and I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem. Amen. Coming down from God out of heaven. Amen. So the old Jerusalem's got to give way. It's got to crumble. It's it's it's it's giving birth painans to the new. And and and I know they say pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Well, I'll tell you, we're not there ain't no peace for for Jerusalem of this old Jerusalem. It's got to pass away as we know what the Bible says. There's great turmoil and and things that are coming. Yes, God's going to visit Jerusalem. God's going to visit the the 144,000 and and things, but that's during the tribulation and and and and and things like that. But but what we're looking for is a new Jerusalem. Amen. Where the King of Peace reigns and there will be peace on earth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, so new Jerusalem. I He said coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people." Now, notice the condition of this new world. Amen. The tabernacle of God is with men. He will dwell with them. They will be his people. And God himself shall be with them and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that sat upon the throne says, "Behold, I make all things new." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's a world to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we find that we'll have a new body, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe you don't believe that. &gt;&gt; How many believe you're going to have a new body? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we're going to live in a new city. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a new civilization, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; So, it's not going to be a civilization of education and science. It's not going to be anything of a civilization that has politics &gt;&gt; or this type of a world order. It will not be an antichrist system. Amen. Brother Bram says education and wisdom of this world has turned the church into a bunch of ragweeds. It's education and educational system, science and civilization is of the devil. It's the devil's civilization. The Bible said so. And our civilization, everybody say, "Our civilization." Our civilization that's coming on will have nothing to do with this civilization at all. &gt;&gt; It's nothing of it at all. There will be a different civilization. So this would be an old civilization &gt;&gt; and there is a new civilization in that new world that is to come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so we find he says the the more scientific we get, further we go into death things, traps to kill and everything in that new civilization, there will be no death, no sickness, sorrow, no pain. There won't be none in there. So this civilization will have to be destroyed because it's of the devil. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so when that new come comes in, the old has to give way. It's just like winter, amen, has to give way to spring. Amen. Uh uh every season coming in, the old has to give way and die so a new season can come. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and no matter how cold it is and how frozen it gets and and and and all these things, as long as time is ticking, there's going to be a spring and death has to give way to life again. &gt;&gt; It it just has to. Death and life cannot exist. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. At the same time. Amen. See, so every mortal thing, the prophet said, must die so that immortality can take its place. Now, this is why we are at the end of all things. &gt;&gt; I I know that you know everybody keep trying to keep this thing running, keep time going, keep keep America living, keep it all strong. Amen. Let it let it get back renewed again. But there's got to come an end to it all. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, we're about to cross that dividing line between mortality and immortality. &gt;&gt; And and so nations, if you want to know why the havoc and all the troubles and all that, nations are giving away, amen, to the coming kingdom. &gt;&gt; This civilization is giving away to the coming civilization. This old earth is given away, amen, to to that new earth. Amen. The the heavens are given away, amen, to the to the new heavens. Amen. The earthly is given way to the heavenly. &gt;&gt; And and so again, the prophet said, "Now it's a continuation of this same life in another world." In other words, we'll still be human beings. Amen. in that we will have a body like this. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We'll have eyes to see. We'll have legs to walk. We'll we'll have ears to hear. We'll we'll we'll have these things. But there will be no death in it. &gt;&gt; There will be no sorrow there. There will be no heartbreak and and no tears to shed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No pain. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, this body that we're in can be tempted and it makes mistakes even even if you do have the Holy Ghost. And and and there's a warfare that just constantly goes on. Amen. Matthew 22 and 23. Amen. It says the same day uh came to him Jesus the Sadducees would say that there is no resurrection and asked him saying master Moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were with seven brethren, and the first, when he had married a wife, uh, deceased, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother. Likewise the second also, and the third unto the seventh. In other words, all these brethren died, and the wife was passed all the way down, amen, to the seventh. And last of all, the woman died also. Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? For they all had her as a wife. See? And Jesus answered and said unto them, you do heir, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't say they are angels. &gt;&gt; He just said they're as the angels. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said angels don't marry or give in marriage. &gt;&gt; The sex glands will be gone. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, we'll be living in this body. A a a body will be human. We ain't going to be a cloud. We ain't going to be just some ghost. &gt;&gt; We're living in a body. And yet the sex glands will be gone. &gt;&gt; Right now we're living in a in a mortal kingdom, but one of these days we're going to live a in an immortal kingdom. Can you say amen? When brother Brandham had uh went beyond the curtain of time, he he saw the saints that had once lived in this old earth, this this world, and as mortal human beings, but they had crossed over into another world. They they they didn't they they didn't become a cloud like brother Brandham thought. He was kind of scared to die cuz he thought you'd just be a cloud just floating along and you know and and and these things and but when he went over there he realized that that it wasn't a cloud. we just didn't just didn't we we we're as human beings and he says see I when I seen that place and that condition with uh that those people were in and how beyond anything that this world could ever think of. It was glorious. There could not be sin there. No death nor nothing could enter that spot. And there was no different between men and women. only the sex glands was gone from them. So, so he says, "And there could never be no more adultery, no more nothing." But yet the woman was still a woman in the way of figure. &gt;&gt; And the man was still a man in the way of figure. And they'll forever be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If you're a man here, you're going to be a man up there, Brother John. Amen. Glad for that, right? Amen. See, and so then there there can be no more sin over there. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; in that place, &gt;&gt; brother Ram said, "These women were hugging me." And they were women. Now, you know what he says about in this in this world, he says, "Any red-blooded man that would hug a woman, there's sensation there. Don't don't care if you got the Holy Ghost or not. There there's a sensation." And that's why he tells us, "Amen, don't don't hug our sisters and sisters don't hug the brethren and and these things. You don't hug a woman." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and and so uh but but he says here, he says, "But there was no possibility of ever being sin again because the glands of our bodies will be changed there." He says, "See, we're different sex now because that's that's uh uh for reproducing the world and our marriage to bring children, but then there will be no more need of that. There will be no children born. We won't have sex glands in the new world. Not at all. But yet the woman will be woman in stature and men will be men. But there will be no more male and female among them in that way. And them glands won't be in. So there will be no way at all for Satan to ever play another trick on them. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So for you brothers, you know, us brothers, our wives will be no more than just a lovely woman to us. That's what brother Ram said. And for you sisters, your husband will be no more than just a lovely man. Amen. To you. But yet that man's yours. That woman is yours. He said you belong to each other. But yet the filio love part, the filio part won't be there. It'll be all agel. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So there will be no jealousy for there's nothing to be jealous about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You remember me to asking brother Brandham. So I got a question. You know when we get on that other side says you you know you did have hope as a wife. So, who gets you? Basically, you know, and uh he she says, you know, kind of like Hope was a little jealous uh when she was in on the earth. She's jealous of you. So, how's that going to work? And so, Brother Brandon says, "But you you forget that over on that side, there ain't going to be no sex glands in that way." So, so there ain't going to be no jealousy. there there ain't going to be no warfare fighting, you know, over over each other. Ain't that right? Cuz there ain't going to be nothing to be jealous about. &gt;&gt; Talking about a place he's gone to prepare. &gt;&gt; So he says, you you never know such a thing as that. Just lovely young men and young women to live. &gt;&gt; Now, it's amazing how that God foretells of things here in the things that he's made. When God in creation made things, he made it to where it would foretell of the future. You know, uh, of course, we were disconnected from God uh and had no fellowship with him and we thought that this was life. I I remember hearing brother Brandham talking about, you know, the lady girls. They were drinking and things and kept him up and I think he had just he got ready and he was getting ready to go to church and opened the door and come them two young ladies from America or whatever and um they said, "Oh, this is life." He stopped him and says, "No, this ain't life." Says, 'You know, uh, and he began to just talk to him a little bit. But see, we we thought this was life. We thought that this was our only future. &gt;&gt; How many people are living today thinking that this is the only future? &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; And and so we live for this life. We invested our time and our energy into this life. How many people do that yet today? They'll put church on the back burner, the things of God on the back burner &gt;&gt; and they'll pour all their life and their energy, their time and everything into this life. We, you know, we fought for the things of this life. We were proud of the things we possessed in this life. It it it gave us a sense of u uh uh pride and and we couldn't just let go of this world. &gt;&gt; But see, everything that God created in this life speaks of another world. &gt;&gt; And the reason I he could do that is because of his infinite knowledge, knowing what will be. and and God in his wisdom, he he wasn't just making things for the present, but he was looking into the future and and and so and and knowing what will be. I I thought of um Exodus 25 and1. It says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart, you shall take my offering." Then you go to the eighth verse. and let them make a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them, according to all, that I show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall you make it. The 40th verse, and look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed thee in the mount. Then if you go to numbers 8 and4 and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according unto the pattern which the Lord had showed Moses. So he made the candlestick. Then in Hebrews 8 and3, for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law, who serve unto the example and shadow. Everybody say shadow of heavenly things. Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he is about to make the tabernacle. For heh saith he thou that thou make all according to the pattern show to thee in the mount. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 9:21. Moreover, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law pers with blood, and without shedding of blood, there is no remission. It was therefore nec uh necessary that the pattern of things in the heavens should be purified with thieves. The pattern of things. Hello. So he made the pattern after the things in heaven. &gt;&gt; He saw what was the heavenly &gt;&gt; and God required him to pattern the things that he made uh on earth after those things in heaven. &gt;&gt; So God would not let Moses just build any tabernacle &gt;&gt; uh on earth. God just didn't say, "Moses, build me a tabernacle." Okay, I'll I'll I'll take care of that for you. And then God just leave it up to him to make any old tabernacle the way he wanted it. God would require him. This tabernacle is to be made after the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, it's I believe it had to be a continuation of everything else that God made on the earth. And so this word tabernacle means a dwelling place or or or tent. And and God wanted to meet with his people and have fellowship with his people. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the whole goal. God wanted fellowship. God wanted his people to understand him and to know him. Amen. And and he become one of them. So he would take Moses on the top of the mountain and show him what kind of dwelling place that he was after &gt;&gt; and that he desired to dwell in on earth. Can you say amen? So notice God showed Moses what the heavenly tabernacle was like and required that he patterned the earthly tabernacle after it. So the earthly tabernacle was a reflection of a heavenly tabernacle &gt;&gt; from another world. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So it was speaking not of itself. It was speaking of another one. Moses when he made this tabernacle, he made it from sheep skin. He didn't make it like we would make it with boards, lumber, but he made it with skin. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Showing that the heavenly tabernacle isn't made out of wood or stone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. is made out of skin. &gt;&gt; And and this tabernacle that Moses made of skin had three compartmentments in it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The outer court, &gt;&gt; the inner court or the the holy place and the holiest of holy, &gt;&gt; ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and all of these pointed to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Another tabernacle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. What Moses laid out, that outer court, inner court, the holiest of holy, it was the compartments. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it all spoke of Christ. Every bit of the furniture that was used in that tabernacle was a pattern. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of Christ. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It all pointed to Christ. No wonder the Bible says all the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily in Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Even in Acts 7:48, it was said by Stephen that Solomon built God and house. We know that he built an house. But Stephen says, "But how be it, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet, most high does not want to dwell in the temple &gt;&gt; made with hands." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We can make him a house. We can make lumber and and build the stone and build such significance, but that's not what God wanted. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Christ was God made flesh. &gt;&gt; Human skin. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Moses patterned that tabernacle after the heavenly. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't take human skin. He had to take animal skin. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God could create himself a body &gt;&gt; and come and dwell in skin. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said God unfolded himself into a mortal being and it was God dwelling in a three- room house. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Just like Moses. outer court, inner court, holiest of holy. You know, you are a three- room house. &gt;&gt; Body, soul, and spirit. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And and just as the sun can shine and they get cloudy and the rain and all these things on that outer court, so does your your your outward. It's up and down. It's it's like this. And and as the inner cord they light that they it would be lit by candles and yet them candles would go out. It would get smoky and all that. So it is on your spirit trim. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But down in that soul &gt;&gt; is where the mercy seat is. &gt;&gt; Down in that soul is where the shakana glory is. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. So, brother Bram said, "The earthly things only express what the eternal things are. They only express that there's a greater of the same kind because these are a same kind." &gt;&gt; So, this world is testifying of another world. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You are testifying of another. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your body, my body is testifying of a greater body. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. The earthly is only testifying of something greater that's beyond. 2 Corinthians 5:1 Paul says, "For we know that if our earthly house, this old flesh, this old tabernacle, the earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God." &gt;&gt; And house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't just something that that's we're waiting for it to it's already there &gt;&gt; in another world. Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? For in this in this this earthly body, we grown. Everybody say we grown. &gt;&gt; We grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. &gt;&gt; Now, we love this earth that we live in. We we love the scenery. I love just going out and taking drives &gt;&gt; on the back roads and looking at the beauty of the mountains and the the trees. We love to live and breathe the air. &gt;&gt; Love to see the flowers and the mountains and the trees that God created. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But this is only an expression of another world to come. &gt;&gt; For I go to prepare a place. Now that word expression means something that manifests, embodies or symbolizes something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the trees that you see here is just a reflection. It embodies symbolizes something and another world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the things that we love here in this life in the way of God's creation, it has to die. We see trees that die and and that'll never come back. they fall or flowers that die. But the one that's dying is only expressing that there's another one &gt;&gt; that will never die. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Come on. Brother Bram says when you see a tree struggling, pulling, trying to live, that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that. When you see a man here struggling to live, somebody in a hospital or in a sick bed, in an accident struggling, and the death rattle is in their throat pulling and crying and screaming for life. What does that mean? There's a place somewhere. There's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that. It just doesn't do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, the things that God has given us in this life are just temporary gifts &gt;&gt; for you to enjoy while you're here. &gt;&gt; Yes. able to enjoy the mountains and the trees and the the flowers and uh just the the life here. It it's it's it's temporary gifts, but they're expressing a place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where we're going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thought of brother Biscll as he gave his testimony of how um that he was somewhere in Canada way up in the mountains with brother Brandham and they were just sitting or standing there just looking at all the beauty. He says, "Oh, brother Bram, this is just so beautiful." Brother Bram says, "You know what, Eddie? This is the way it's going to be in the millennium, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; All this that you're enjoying, it's going to be there in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Think of that. See, this is only expressing another reflecting another world. &gt;&gt; So, so Jesus has gone to prepare not something that is temporal, but he's gone to prepare an eternal eternal. Never had a beginning and will never have an end. It's it's an eternal world. It's an eternal condition, an eternal civilization, an eternal people, an eternal city. And death cannot take it away from us. Age, it doesn't age with time. For there is no time. That's hard for us to understand being that we're creatures of time. &gt;&gt; It's hard to understand that there was a God that's always existed. He He didn't began. He didn't end. He always is. Always was &gt;&gt; and and that's the place we're going. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, time came by sin. Brother Ram uses the example. He said, "You take a perfect circle. It just keeps going around and around. There's no end to it. But then sin brought in a gap. It it it it caused a a a gap in the and and and he says that this way it put a little hickey or a or a little drop in the chain. So it uh so it comes down. Eternity continues on, but it's not in its perfect condition. And there's a little gap comes down, breaks over this way and goes out this way. See, God had to do that because Satan caused it. And it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost. that God by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hickey or gap back into the perfect circle. &gt;&gt; Then she rose on just the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We know Jesus is was from eternity to eternity. Amen. And and yet the prophet said he stepped into the time space and was made flesh. And he had 33 and a half years of time. But he dropped into that time space made flesh to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again for all eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God dwells in eternity for he is eternal. Time means nothing to God. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I want you to get that now. Time means nothing to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've been praying for a year." Time means nothing to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Psalms 90 and4 for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is passed and as a watch in the night. So if if you were just if you lived a thousand years, it's just as yesterday to God when it's all passed. It it it means nothing. See 2 Peter 3:8, "But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So here, 2,000 years ago, Jesus promised to come back and he says, "I I'll receive you unto myself that where I may be, you may be also." Can you say amen? That's right. &gt;&gt; But listen church, we cannot live with him as creatures of time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said he is taking us creatures of time and making us creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now think of it. This is what's going on now. He's taking us creatures of time and he's making us creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. sons and daughters of his. &gt;&gt; So then there has to be a change over from time to eternity, &gt;&gt; from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Now listen, church, he says, I'm going to prepare a place. &gt;&gt; Not just up there, leave you here, but I'm going to come back and I'm going to take you there. &gt;&gt; That we can live together. But that place is an eternal place. No temporary. So there has to be a makeover, a change. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; So then the first thing, the thing that calls time must be abolished. So therefore, he paid the price of redemption at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And what's the beginning of the change? The soul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Your soul has to be changed from time to eternal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said you're a time being until you're born again and then you're an eternal being. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can get it is to have part of God in you being eternal life. So when we we think of Holy Ghost, you know, the the apostolic Pentecost, they make the Holy Ghost all about emotions, rolling on the floor, jumping up and down, speaking in tongues, prophesying, and all of these things. But the Holy Ghost is a life of God, eternal that comes in you and makes you an eternal being. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, then that has to mean that one thing. If sin calls time and now you become eternal in your soul, then there's no sin held against you. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That little nick or nich or hickey or gap has been taken away. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; You can't be saved today and lost tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That would be something temporary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So there's no sin held against you. That's why the prophet said, "You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God, washed in the blood of Jesus Christ, and believes every word of God, stands as though you never sinned at the first place." You are perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what you are in your soul will never change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's eternal. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let the trials come. &gt;&gt; Let all hell come. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let the floods let the fire let whatever come and your soul will never change. &gt;&gt; It can't change. It's eternal. &gt;&gt; It's it's been transformed. Oh yeah. Your body is still subject to time and it's getting older and weaker. It's still subject to to the the effects of sin and diseases and and and and all of these things. But that's going to change too. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when total complete redemption happens. Happens. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 15:50. Paul says, ' Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. I'll say it again. Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. So this is the mystery, right? He said it's a mystery. Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; We're not all going to go by the way of the grave, but we all going to be changed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. those that have gone by the way of the grave and those that are still alive is going to be changed. &gt;&gt; Not changed in your soul. That that change is happening now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible &gt;&gt; and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That gap has been taken away. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you're back to a circle again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now notice the dead shall be raised. We shall be changed. And when this this happen when he comes to receive us. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4:16. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God. &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; We become completely redeemed and we step into eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When brother Brandham experienced going beyond the curtain of time, he tried his best to describe eternity and what it would be like for us to live in eternity. and he talked how that it was been nearly 2,000 years since Christ had died. But he says that doesn't mean one little dot to eternity. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now think of that here. Here it was even before you know when Jesus says I go away. We look at it in time. It's been 2,000 years. or so. But in eternity, it's just a little dot. It's it's &gt;&gt; He said, "If we were here 10 million years, it still would not be just as it was the old saying, where was the man when he jumped off the bridge? You could not figure it out." Someone say, "Well, in the water, but he hadn't jumped yet." Someone say, "Well, on the bridge." Well, he's still on the bridge. He hasn't jumped. See? So there's no beginning or end to it. He's trying to describe what eternity is. See, we we looking at this big old gap. We're looking at this big old thing, but in eternity, it's just &gt;&gt; it's just a little old. So, Brother Brandham described what it will be like over there in eternity. He said, 'I'll walk up and I'll say, 'Brother Humes, let you and I, brother and brother Beer and some of the brethren, we'll go up to Papa God and say, "Let's take a journey. You boys like mountains." And when you was on Earth, yes, we sure did. Oh, there's a couple million miles of them out yonder in that new world. Go ahead out and roam over them. And you know, I'm walking out through there, all of us walking out there just for about 500 years. Just a little journey, a million don't make any difference. Now, that sounds like crazy, he says, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; See, because there's no time, it's eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I go out there, I walk along down through there, and you know who I meet, he says, well, I say, well, if it ain't Sister Georgie Bruce. Well, Sister Georgie, it's been a long time since I seen you. Looks like, you know, like like she always does. See, she maybe is 10 million years old, but just as young as she ever was. &gt;&gt; She'd be scratching somebody on the back. I look there and it's it's Cheetah the lion. How are you this morning, Cheetah? See, meow like a kitten. Oh, I've been down there talking to some of the sisters around them. Big flowers down there. We've been there about 500 years looking around. Now, that sounds crazy, but it's the truth. That's the way God intended it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another place says, "We'll walk up and down now, and I'll take a trip with you across the mountains for a million years. Just a few days, just a few minutes." See, we'll go across there, sit around over there. When it comes time to eat, first thing you know, Sister Wood, I say, "Sisterwood, where have you been all this time? I haven't seen you for seems like it's been 15 minutes. Oh, that's been 2,000 years ago, Brother Brandham. Well, how are you feeling? Of course, you can't feel nothing but good. See? Hey, come here, boys. I'll show you all something, brethren. My darling brethren, here's the fountain of water, the best you've ever drank, and we'll get a good cold drink. I'll reach up there, get a big bunch of grapes, and we'll all sit down there and eat it. See, that's exactly what it is. Ain't that right? See? So, so there there it's it's an eternity. He says no more long nights of praying. Just enter that youthful age to young joyful age to be there. And and not for just a year or 50 years or a million years. He says when we've been there a hundred billion years, we won't even be started at all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that he has come back to receive us so that we may be with him eternally. And he specifically said who he's coming back to. And if you notice, you start with John 14th chapter. From the first verse, he says, "I go to prepare a place. I'll come back and receive you." and and all the way down in that same chapter from uh 18 to 20, he says, "I'll not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while the world seeth me no more, but you'll see me because I live. You shall live also at that day." And the prophet said, "This day you shall know that I'm in my father, you in me, and I in you." &gt;&gt; What is it? God has once again unfolded himself into human beings. &gt;&gt; He's come to take us with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's not taking us somewhere a million miles away as the prophet would tell us. He said, "See, it's a place, a condition that we move out of this dimension that we live into another dimension." You think of it when Jesus was on Mount Transfiguration. The Bible says that Moses and Elijah appeared and began to talk with him, they had been dead hundreds of years, and yet in an instant time, they were right there. And they're talking to Christ. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and so brother Brown says, "See, we're looking we're looking at some mythical something way off out yonder 100 million years." Another place he says, "I got a revelation the other day standing up there on Mount Palomar at the observatory seeing the time the space over to Mars and to the last continents and so forth and light traveling at so many thousand miles per second." He said if an angel started from the furthest star coming here to earth, it would take him billions times billions times billions of years to get here. If he started from Mars and come here flying at the speed of light space or light speed, it would take him billions of years to get here. He said, "I cannot believe that there is a house way out yonder, but I believe that that house that God was speaking of is right present here now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That that's the place where the mortal beings when we cease to be mortal here, we step into immortality yonder into a place &gt;&gt; and I believe that's where Jesus is today. the resurrected Lord Jesus. Not out yonder somewhere a million miles away. Not not somewhere not somewhere a million miles away but a a right here present with us now. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Sure. &gt;&gt; In the fourth dimension, people can prove that right through this room now is coming through radio activity, radio messages coming right through this building now is coming television pictures, but it's too fast for our eyes. He said, you go millions of miles beyond that dimension and you'll get into a place that's just as real as television pictures is in this room this morning. And there's the Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrected son of God, standing here. And the reason that you can't see him is because our heart hasn't become tuned down to it. Now, think of it. Television can pick up things that we cannot see. Things in this room right now, voices and pictures that we cannot see. But yet something they have found through technology, science can pick it up and make it a reality. &gt;&gt; And yet, brother Brandham is saying that other world is right here too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the place that we're going. Amen. It's just in another dimension. &gt;&gt; So it's not millions of miles away. Ain't that right? So he says now but when our body becomes in tune with God picking a part becoming a part of him then our soul everybody say our soul &gt;&gt; soul &gt;&gt; can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and omnipotence that he has risen from the dead and he lives among us today. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; We can't see it. But when we become born again, that soul of ours can pick it up. &gt;&gt; And we can know he's here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We know that that other world is real. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is real. &gt;&gt; Now, the world ain't groaning for it. Right? &gt;&gt; They're living for this life, &gt;&gt; but there's something in us that is is crying out and letting us know there's something around here. &gt;&gt; It's becoming in tune with that other world. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "The only way you can groan for that other world is because there's new life that speaks of it." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I love him. Since the dawn of time, men have wondered what life is like after death. And there's no way to really fully know since we haven't been there. You take a a baby, and I'll use Zane for example, since he's fixing to be born. You know, you you could take that little child, that little baby in the womb of mama and you know, uh, if he had intelligence right now, if he could know what's going on, if he could think, you know, the prophet says, you know, he said, if that baby could think, it would say, you know what, they tell me that I'm fixing to be born. They're getting prepared for my coming, my arrival. And they're they're they're telling me just any time I'm going to be born into this world, into a world that I know nothing about. And if he could think about this, you know, I'm I'm used to this. I'm used to whatever I'm I've been I I was begotten in here. And and I get my energy from here. I get my food from here. I I I I'm I'm sustaining life in here. I I'm I'm being sustained. Yet they tell me that a sun is bright out in that world. They tell me there's trees and and grass and and and and and people that just walk around &gt;&gt; and and a lot of them. Then he gets scared to death cuz he don't know what that world's like. &gt;&gt; He's never been there. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; See? And so he says, "What would I do out there? What kind of a world is it? I know nothing about this place." See, so how will I survive out there? And and how am I going to eat and breathe and and all of these things? He's that little baby would be scared to death to be born because it's coming into a place he knows nothing about. Yet this place, this world is million times million times supreme than the world that he's in in that mother's womb. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But think of us that have lived, we're living in this world. We know what it's like and we came from that world. We We used to be in our mother's womb, but we would never want to go back. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We'd never want to go back into mama's womb again. You remember when brother Brandham crossed the beyond the curtain of time as he's looking at all these people and talking with them and all these things and he's talking with that angel, he turns around and asks that angel, "Do I have to go back?" Oh my. He was there. He could look at his body laying in the on in the bed and the body that is he was in had had hair. He was young. He didn't want to go back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then tried to come back. He had to come back, the angel said. And he and then he tries to describe what that world was like to us. He said, "If I tried to speak you of the things that would be beyond a human's understanding, if I tried to speak of those things, I couldn't I still couldn't describe the place of the blessed and how peaceful. Never to die, never to be old, never to be sick, always to be young, always to be healthy, never to die, eternal life in the blessed of youth, no sin or nothing else." And yet there's no way to describe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Eyes hath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man those things that God hath prepared for them that love him." See, there's no way to explain it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "We are like that baby when we are dying. You're being born into a place. You've never been there. You can't understand it. how great it is and how it's going to be out there. The only thing that makes me realize or you realize is that little touch of life like the spirit may come into the baby in its mother's womb. It's the only way that we can understand what is that great land out yonder when there's no sickness, sorrow, no death or old age or nothing. Can you say amen? And once we get to that place, we'll never want to come back. That's exactly &gt;&gt; into this condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought of our loved ones that have gone over and they would never want to go back. They'd never want to come back here. when my, you know, my first wife passed away or my wife passed away and you know that that was one of the hardest things is I I'd listen to brother Brandham's testimony and and I just constantly listen to that and and one of those things that was just the hardest thing is to think that she would not want to come back to be with me. She would not want to come back to be in this world and to suffer and all the the things and because she had come into a world millions and millions and million times supreme than what this is. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Very true. &gt;&gt; I thought of hope. Brother Bram talking of hope as she was crossing over into that land. And he says, "If I live to be a hundred years old, I'll never forget what happened. She turned over and those big great big pretty eyes, they looked at me. She smiled and she said, 'Why did you call me back, Billy? I said, 'What do you mean call you back? She said, Bill, you preached about it. You've talked about it, but you don't have no idea what it is. I said, well, what are you talking about? She said, heaven. She said, look, I was being escorted home by some people, men or women or something. They was dressed in white. And she said, "I was at ease and peace of big birds flying from tree to tree." She was describing a world &gt;&gt; that we have no clue about except there's something in our hearts that speak of it &gt;&gt; and let us know that it's real. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to that time. &gt;&gt; What we have seen in this last day is a reality of what he has said. He made the promise, I go away, but I will return. and receive you unto myself. We can't get involved in life to where we lose sight of our future. We can't get so wrapped up in our ministries and our ideas and focus on things that we forget what it really truly is to be a Christian. Why are you a Christian in the first place? Have you ever just thought of that? Not to make you a preacher, Brother Amos. Not to make you big some great name. We shouldn't strive to be some great big name. We shouldn't strive to be known. We shouldn't strive to be whatever. He made you a Christian because he's come to prepare you a place. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's come back for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We should be the most happiest people on the face of the earth &gt;&gt; knowing we're getting ready to go home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we must not forget because if we're looking for things to comfort us, they've got dogs that comfort animals, comfort foods. They got everything to comfort. comfort with money, comforted with nice things, comforted with retirement plans, comforted with everything and not knowing they could lose that in a heartbeat. Or you could be as rich as them billionaires and die tomorrow and be totally lost. So our comfort isn't in this this world, but there is a future. And he left us with words to comfort us, to let us know there is a life after death. And you're going to be with me forever. And the conditions are going to change. Everything's going to change. You suffering now, you'll not suffer then. You you you crying now, you won't cry then. I go to prepare a place. I'm so glad. Can you say amen? Do you love him? Going to rise it. Oh, rise. Rise above it all. Going to spread my wings. Fly away to heaven. Rise above it all. Oh, sing it now. I'm going to rise. Go to rise. Rise above it all. Oh, [Applause] rise above it all.

Oh, change from immortal to immortality in a twinkling of and high. [Music] Oh, it won't be long [Music] till we'll be leaving here. It won't be long. We'll be going home. It won't be long till we'll be leaving here. Do you believe that tonight you won't be long? No, it won't. We'll be going home. So I say, "Count the years as months, [Music] count the months as weeks, [Music] and count the weeks as days. For any day now, [Music] we'll be going home." Oh, sing it like you mean it. Oh, count the years as months. Count the months as weeks and count the weeks as days. Any day now we'll be going home as they just play softly now. God bless you is our prayer. Always keep that in your mind. We're going home. Make sure that you have the ticket in your hand. Make sure that you have your house in order because we're really going home. I know we got to plant the potatoes. I I know we've got to do what we do, but we always live every day as though the Lord could come any second. Amen. That's how close we are. Amen. And so, uh, may you have a good week, the remaining of it, and remember, uh, the children and I in prayer as we be traveling tomorrow to Arkansas. And, uh, Brother Daniel will be ministering this Sunday, the Lord willing. And so, um, I know you'll be blessed and we'll be praying for the service here. and um ask you to do the same for us and that we could be a help to the people there in Arkansas. Amen. So, God bless you. We love you and um till we meet again. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. And um Brother Beiel, do you want to dismiss us in prayer? [Music]
