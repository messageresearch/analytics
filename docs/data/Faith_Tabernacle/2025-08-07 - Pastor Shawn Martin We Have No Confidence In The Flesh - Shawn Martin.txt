Thou lamb of Calary. Saveior divine. Now hear me while I pray. Take all my guilt away. Don't let me from this day be holy thine. Oh, my faith looks unto thee. Calary save your divine. Hear me while I pray. Take all my sins away and oh let me from this day be holy vine. Well, is that your prayer this evening? Amen. Our faith looks up to him. Amen. And um I'm so glad that we can look up to him and have a faith in him, a confidence in him. Praise the Lord. And uh it's certainly good to be here in the house of the Lord with you. Amen. And trust you had a good day today. And uh certainly enjoying the the weather. Amen. And uh um if you have your Bibles, we'll um just turn to the scriptures for just a a few moments. Amen. Um and we want to look maybe uh the book of Philippians. Amen. Uh the third chapter. And you're going to want to remember all those that are sick and not feeling well. Amen. And if you've noticed, we took out a couple pews, a pew on each side of the uh church, and that's to to make room uh more room. Amen. I kind of like it. Um that way u you know we had Sister Py in the back in the hallway all that time for for a long time and Sister Kim was back in the back Sunday with her leg. And so we decided to um to change things and so um uh bring you all closer up this way so you're closer to the back and to the front at the same time. But um uh of course if if when we need it uh u more chairs, we we we're able to do that. So um anyway, so not all is lost. Amen. And um you know, I think as I said before, uh we're going to be changing things as we go uh in here. I'm going to be uh when we get the money and the chance going to change the pews and we're going to put regular chairs in and make make it look a little nicer and um so anyways uh hope that doesn't affect anybody's worship u and your love for the Lord and your love for me. Praise the Lord. Uh but uh uh we just uh thought we'd kind of update things a little bit and um uh just get um refresh. Amen. So uh hope that'll be all right with everybody. Uh but let's look at the book of Philippians for just a few moments and um the third chapter and um we're going to start at the first verse um and read to the 14th. But it says, "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievious, but for you it is safe." Now, think of that. Paul writing words that would be safe for the church. Beware of dogs. Beware of evil workers. Um, beware of the concision, for we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if any other man thinkketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ? Yay doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the re resurrection of the dead, not as though I'd already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, as we have gathered here this evening under a promise that you would be here with us and Lord, we're trusting that tonight. And we just ask that you would help us, that you would anoint both speaker and hearer. I pray, Father, that you would help me to get myself out of the way and that you can use me to speak to someone, to speak to your people today. Father, as you see, Lord, I uh may not have much Lord, but if you could just take the simple words and as you did the the loaves and fish and just multiply it, Lord, I pray, Father, that you would do it tonight. Lord, asking that you would forgive us of all of our sins and our failures. And Father, cover us with your blood this evening. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. You can have your seats this evening. And um I um honestly wasn't um I was uh expecting another minister to come and uh so I have just enjoyed myself all day relaxing, taking it easy. And on our way to church, I found out that I'm preaching. And so, u um I trust that it'll be a help to you tonight. And uh it's just going to be something simple, but um if I would have a title, it would be we have no confidence in the flesh. And um taking from what Paul said there and I I think that was is a powerful statement and how true it is for every believer is to not look at ourselves and have confidence because what what would we have confidence in? Now the things that stand out to me that Paul would say in this uh chapter uh first of all he said we are the circumcision. We are the true circumcision. And we know that uh there were the Jews. God had required them in the Old Testament to every male to be circumcised and it was the cutting away of flesh. And uh it was a natural thing. And so um when God turned to the Gentiles uh well the the Jews, they felt like the Gentiles ought to be circumcised too. and uh that they couldn't be saved without it. And so, of course, uh it became a battle. And and so here is Paul addressing this and he's telling them we are the true circumcision &gt;&gt; because the natural only type the spiritual of of as we have talked about uh uh I think last Sunday a little bit of how that uh the the Holy Ghost is our circumcision uh and it's not dealing with natural flesh but it is dealing with the circumcision of the heart &gt;&gt; that it it it cuts out the desires of the world. It cuts us away from the things uh that would hinder us and and and these things. And so Paul is telling them we have we have no confidence in the flesh. You know, uh the the Jewish, you know, they they they wanted a law. They wanted something that they could do for themselves and and it become a merit system uh to gain God's favor and and um uh these things and and basically to have their own righteousness and and so Paul is telling them, hey, you know, th this ain't this isn't the gospel. We we're we we're not to have confidence in what we do and and these things. And then he goes on, "And what things were gained to me, I counted loss for Christ." Now that that's a big statement in itself because uh everybody you know wants wants more and more and uh uh it it seems to be you know um uh something that keeps a man superior as as we read where Paul says if you want to boast in the flesh all right let's go there and and he begins to give his resume of everything that he was in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And he had quite a resume. And yet he says, "Everything that I've was gained to me, everything that I was, everything that I, you know, in in that in the past, I counted all but done that I may win Christ." And so the the the the works of the flesh faded away uh when Calvary came into view, &gt;&gt; when Christ came. Um and and and that's what it was. And so he goes on and says, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. I'm not here to learn about me. I'm not here to learn about my works and and and what I'm capable of or or all these things. I I want to gain the knowledge of him. &gt;&gt; I want to know who he is. &gt;&gt; I want to know all about him. Ain't that right? And he says, "For whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ. Then another point he says that I may be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but having the righteousness which is of God which comes through faith in Christ. Ain't that right? So nothing that I've done is just simply I've got righteousness, the righteousness of God simply through the works of Christ, believing in in Christ, uh my substitute. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and so he he goes on and and he's talking, you know, I've I my goal is to apprehend that for which I have been apprehended for. If I'm going to spend my life, I'm going to spend it everything to gain Christ. What I've been chosen for, what I have been ordained for, what I have been predestinated for. I'm not I'm not worried about everything else. I'm just here to apprehend Christ. And I'm reaching for those things which are before. Ain't that right? Amen. and I press toward the mark of the the prize of the high calling of Jesus Christ. So Paul is clearly letting us know that there is nothing nothing good in ourselves. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, people think that they have to be good in order to come to Christ. uh you know, if I could just clean up this and if I could just, you know, make this better and if I could quit that, then then, you know, I'll come to church and I'll give my heart to the Lord or uh you know, all these things. But that that's that that's pointless. &gt;&gt; If if we could do anything good, then there's there's no point in Christ dying for us. Ain't that right? as as and we know these things, but you know, I I I pray that we could get so established in the grace of God that that it takes all fear away from us, &gt;&gt; takes all anxiety to where we can just fully rest upon God's promises. Amen. See, and so we we have nothing to bring to God. we uh that will get God to accept us more today than he did yesterday. &gt;&gt; There there's nothing if as the prophet said, you know, if you didn't do nothing, if you didn't tell a lie, if you didn't smoke, drink, if you didn't think a bad thought or whatever, if you didn't do any of those things, you're still lost &gt;&gt; without God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so we we find that that none of us can bring to the table. You couldn't do it as a sinner and you still can't do it today to to gain God's favor towards you. &gt;&gt; You just can't do it. Ain't that right? And so we all deserve to stand at the white throne judgment. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; We all do. Every one of us. We all deserve to go through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; We all deserve to go to hell. There's not there's not one of us here that that that doesn't deserve that. We we all deserve that from from the least to the the uh to the greatest. It it's just that way. But why why aren't we afraid of these things? &gt;&gt; Why why aren't we afraid to have to that that that you know to that to have to stand before the uh uh uh white throne judgment? Why why aren't we um uh full of anxiety and and all that when the world is headed to tribulation? Everything's about to blow any time. I know they're calling peace peace, but the the the Bible already says when they begin to do that, sudden destruction's going to come. &gt;&gt; We we we're we're we're seeing the earthquakes like never before. We're we're seeing warnings of tsunamis and we're we're uh planes falling out of the sky. We're we're we're seeing trouble in the land. It's it's just chaos after chaos and men and women and boys and girls full of hate and bitterness and anger and and and and nobody has the answers and and marriages falling apart and schools falling apart, churches falling apart, people Amen just falling apart. But why are we at peace tonight? Is because God provided a blood to cover us from all of these things. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; The blood is God's provided way to reconcile us back to him. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. To think of that. Amen. That God so long Amen. to to for us to come in company with him and to fellowship with him and it's it's God's pardoning grace to us. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now that's uh that that's important. You know, I um you know, the prophet uh preached the message uh uh uh pardon and and he talks about pardon a lot and that that that should mean something so much to us. A pardon is a release. Everybody say a release from guilt. &gt;&gt; Now, think of that. Amen. In our own mind, we know we've done it. We know we're undeserving. But there is a release from guilt. Amen. And it goes on, pardon is the act of forgiving or releasing someone from the consequences of a fault or crime or the remission of a penalty. It can also be seen as excusing an offense or allowing it to pass without punishment. In in a legal context, a pardon is a release from the legal penalties of an offense, often granted by a government official. Ain't that right? It means to exact neither punishment nor redress. It cannot be brought up again in the court of law. It's a pardon. You're free. It's over. The It silences the accuser. It breaks the power of of the accuser. No matter what anybody thinks, they may think you deserve it. They may say you ought to go to jail. But if there has been a pardon granted, then you're free from all guilt, free from condemnation, free from anything like that. Aren't you glad for that? And so God provided a blood not just to forgive you, but to pardon you. Amen. And and to where you don't have to bear the punishment. You don't have to bear the guilty of a load of condemnation. Why? It's not that God just says, "Well, I'm going to excuse the sin and the wrong and and let him get by." But Christ produced uh took our punishment. Christ bore our sins. Christ became sin. Amen. He became us that we might become him. He came from the the the the top and came all the way to the lowest of bottom that we could come from the lowest of bottom to go all the way up to the top and be just like him. Can you say amen? See, so God would produce, amen, a a remedy, a a substitute. And so Christ would take our punishment that we could go free without any condemnation. Now, as the prophet said, we have to accept that. &gt;&gt; And I think that is the biggest thing is accepting what God has done. &gt;&gt; We know what we've done, but we ought to know what he's done. You could either accept what you are as undeserving, amen, and live that way. Or you could accept his pardoning grace, amen, and live the way he sees you as. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want us living in fear and dread. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God doesn't want us living in condemnation. Now, the only way a Christian should uh well, I say should, uh, the only way a Christian will live in condemnation, if I could say it that way, or however uh Paul would say it, is that if our heart condemn us, if we've done something wrong that's not under the blood, our heart will condemn us. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; There is something that will tell you, now you're wrong. you shouldn't have done that. Now, I want to just say this, you know, because the prophet says that a person can grieve themselves, grieve their soul away, you know, he says just like a child, you know, maybe he got caught in the cookies, you know, he ate the cookie, he ate the last cookie, and he knew he shouldn't have done that. You know, mama told him don't do that, but he did it anyways. And so mama sees that the cookiey's gone and she'll ask him, "Did you did you take that cookie?" Now, now the prophet says, and I'm sure we all experienced it, is there something down inside you that tells you, you know, you did it? Now, you can't, you know, or at least I couldn't have a poker face. As much as I tried to tell him I couldn't do it or didn't do it, I always had a guilty look. And and you know I uh all my children had a guilty look. You could you you could just tell it on written in their face. No matter even if they did say no, they got it on that look. They got that look, you know. Well, the prophet says there's something that tells you. Tell the truth. Tell the truth. You know you did it. And then something will say, "Well, but I'll get in trouble if I do that. you know, I ain't gonna do that. So, you got the the the the little devil over on your shoulder. Then you got the angel over your shoulder, whatever, you know, and and they're tell one's telling you, "Tell the truth." The other one says, "No, no, no, don't do that." You know, you'll get in trouble. And and so there becomes a war. So then the child says, "No, I I didn't do that. It was it was it was Billy Bob, you know, that did that, you know, and and you know, Billy Bob, did you I didn't do that, you know, that that that was that was, you know, goofy and he's the one that done that, you know, and so then he goes back and forth, but but he knows that he's guilty. There's something that tells him he's guilty, but he pushes that aside and he gets away with it. Well, then the prophet says, see, now he knows he got away with telling a lie. So now it becomes starting to get easier to tell lies and it becomes easier to tell lies to where then he starts not feeling guilty about telling those lies. He actually starts believing those lies and and the more he does it, well, the prophet says he's starting to grieve his soul away from him, right? See, and and so yeah, uh then he, you know, maybe he gets older and maybe the the teacher will ask him, you know, did you did you slap did you slap, you know, uh uh you know, uh Joe, you know, no, I didn't slap him. He just he just come to school like that with the handmark on his face, you know. Uh uh but I didn't do that, you know. Okay. Well, I hope you didn't. Oh, I didn't do that at all. And it became easy, you know. And and and then he gets older, he breaks the law with the policeman. You know, policeman says, "Ah, did you do that?" Ain't no way. I'll tell you the truth if I did that. You know, he knows he's lying through his teeth. You know, but it just becomes so much easier. Ain't that right? Easier to lie. And before you know it, he's getting away with murder. and and and and and he's grieved his soul to where there's nothing that condemns him. But a Christian now, a a Christian, when he does something wrong, there's something that just automatically lets him know you done wrong. And and and if he's a Christian, a prophet says there just something the minute he realizes he's wrong, he repents of it. So the prophet said it's not even sin yet because the moment he realizes he's wrong, he repents. Ain't that right? But the prophet said if your heart condemns you, then you're putting yourself right back as a sinner again. You put yourself as a sinner in the sense you're under condemnation. But we know there's a blood there that you don't have to live under condemnation. You don't have to stay that way. God doesn't want Christians, Amen, uh uh staying under condemnation. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want us coming to church and and and people can't lift their hands when they're under condemnation. They can't worship God freely when they're under in condemnation. So God would provide a blood and the prophet said it's always been the way of the blood. blood. The streak of blood runs from Genesis to Revelation. And the pathway of a Christian is the way of the of the blood. A ain't that right. Amen. See, and so Christ, he took our punishment so that we could go free and and and so now we have to accept it. Amen. Our worship should be without any condemnation. Not because our conscience is seared, but because there is a blood and we've been able to put everything under the blood and we're resting in his provision. &gt;&gt; We're not resting in our provision. We're resting in what God has done for us. We ought to be the most joyful people on the face of the earth. It shouldn't be too hard for us to worship him. Even if we're tired, even if we're discouraged, even if we're, you know, fighting our battles, amen, to remember that it's his righteousness. And no matter what I feel, no matter how low I am, amen, I'm on my way to heaven, amen, because he provided a way, amen, of escape. So often people find themselves professing Christianity and yet living under a law and the word becomes law to them. It becomes a thing of dos and don'ts. Churches have made it about dos and don'ts. Preachers have made it dos and don'ts. And I understand, you know, as maybe as as as you young people, you got a Christian dad and a Christian mom. They got dos and don'ts. Can't do this. Can't do that. You got to do this. You got to do that. And at that point, you're living under a law. I don't want to make my bed. Well, you're going to make your bed. You got to make your bed or you're in trouble. You know, you got to clean your room or or you got to go to school. You got to do all of these things, right? Gotta go to church. You got to live right. Got to dress right. Gotta got to act right. Amen. And it may be seem like young people have to play that part. But what we're we're we're hoping and and praying and believing is that God will strike that soul to where it's no longer a law that you're living under, but it's God's grace that comes and circumcises that heart &gt;&gt; to get you away from the world, to get you away from the unbelief, to get you away from desiring the filth and the trash that is out there and all the ungodly things to where your heart and mind and soul is centered upon Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's not fun living under a law. &gt;&gt; It's not fun. Amen. When everything becomes law, Christianity becomes law. Amen. Where's the joy in that? When you're wanting to go out there and do those things and yet you know that if you do it, you go to hell. So, you don't want to do those things. Well, you don't serve God because you're afraid of going to hell. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. That's not why you're serving God. Amen. You serve him because you love him. &gt;&gt; You serve him not because you have confidence in your flesh. Amen. But you have confidence in every work that he has done at Calvary. That's right. &gt;&gt; The people sad to say they live under a law yet claim to be Christians. The word becomes a law to them. Christianity becomes a fleshly thing to them. Thou shalt thou shalt not. Don't touch this. Do this. You know, and so again, it's just like the Jews having the circumcision in the flesh. They thought the Jews or Gentiles ought to come just like they are and and these things, but they didn't realize Calvary had come. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that something greater has come. A greater circumcision. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A greater lamb, a greater blood, a greater high priest. Ain't that right? A greater work. Now, but here the prophet said Jesus Christ was God manifested in the fullness did to himself standing on the earth. &gt;&gt; God in his fullness to die for the sin of the people &gt;&gt; that he might bring his church to his church a sanctified life that he might have the preeminence and fullness in his church. Can you say amen? how different it was for the for uh uh for the Mosak laws and and and the ministry of condemnation. Amen. It was all about their works. Thou shalt not do this. Thou shalt do this. And okay, you know, and and and they were perfecting themselves in their own righteousness by their own works. Can you say amen? But Christ died that we wouldn't have to do that. Christ died that we wouldn't have to try to perfect ourselves because every time you try to perfect yourself in the flesh, condemnation is going to strike you. Can you say amen? Amen. But see, Calvary came not for us to have this up and down experience. He loved me. He loved me not. He loved me. He loved me not. I'm on my way to heaven. Oh no, I just blew it. I don't even know if I'm going to heaven or not. No. Christ settled it all. Having no confidence in the flesh, he died that he might have the preeminence in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring to his church a sanctified life. There's only one life sanctified and that's his life. &gt;&gt; There's only one holy life and that's his holy life. Ain't that right? so that he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church. Watch to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days. Now, that's a promise. Amen. That he that's what God wants to do is to manifest every promise that he made for these last days to manifest them in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And yet, we don't need a struggle to make that happen. We don't have to say, "Oh, man. I've got to do something to make this happen." We ain't got no confidence in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Let him take over. Prophet said, "The more you die to yourself," Amen. the more he has his way in us. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It's just dying out to our flesh. Amen. Now, God, you know, the prophet told us God had the three-fold purpose. The first was that he wanted to express himself, identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ. Secondly, he wanted to live in his bride body to have the preeminence in them. Now, think of it. How's he going to have a preeminence? Now, you know, he knew that man was going to fall. He knew that. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He he if he didn't, then he wouldn't have had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. But he knew man was going to fall. He knew what the condition that man would be in. And yet he chose that man. He chose you and I to have preeminence in. &gt;&gt; He didn't wipe when he saw a man fall. Well, you know, aren't you glad that he didn't just say, "Well, I'm going to wipe them off the face of the earth and I'll make someone else. I can't have the preeminence in someone like that." Amen. But he knew he could have preeminence in you, Brother Tim. Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He knew he would be able to have the preeminence in us because of the work of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have preeminence in a sinful, ungodly people that was born with a vile nature, unholy. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And yet that people he chose for himself. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And the Bible says we are his creation. How many's glad for that? &gt;&gt; We are his creation. And it's not a by a sexual desire of our parents. 2 Corinthians 5:17. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, new creation. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Quit dragging the old things with you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Quit dragging the past with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll never be able to make something because I've always been that way. Quit dragging that with you. &gt;&gt; Hello, church. &gt;&gt; Why? You are a new creation. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You're not just reformed. You are created new, a new creation. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; We did not have a good outlook, &gt;&gt; but now we do have a good outlook. &gt;&gt; We didn't have a promise of a great future, but now we do. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We were bound for hell, but now we're bound for heaven. why he did it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:23, Paul says, "And be renewed in the spirit of your mind, that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." Think of that. You put on the new man not walk after the old, but you're walking after the new. It's a new life, a new thought, a new hope, a new promise. You're putting on that new man which is after God created in righteousness and true holiness. Amen. You know, we've talked about holiness and things and for years people have understood holiness to mean, you know, women wearing long hair and long dresses, long sleeves, men having short hair and long sleeves and and and and a bunch of other rules, no no wearing of jewelry of any kind. And I've even met some, you know, women that didn't believe in shaving their legs. and you know and they have all kinds of rules and and these things and and it's got to the place that people base their whole eternal destination on what they do and what they don't do. Ain't that right? But that's not true holiness because it's not how moral we are that gets us to heaven. Brother Bram said, you know, you could keep all the Ten Commandments and still not be a Christian. See, because God didn't send the Ten Commandments to save his people. He sent his son &gt;&gt; to offer up a blood sacrifice for you and I. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so, here we find, and I I really like what Paul said here in Second Timothy. I was reading it this morning and it just, you know, it it spoke to my heart, but 2 Timothy 1:7 uh through 10, but it says, "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear." For one, if there's ever a time that we need to get rid of fear, it's now. It's in this age. It's in this time to get rid of fear. You know, uh, Brother Brham says that's the biggest thing in the church, uh, is fear. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Afraid that God won't keep his promise. Afraid, you know, of of of of so many things and that God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of sound mind. &gt;&gt; He goes on, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner. But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God, who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But according to his own purpose and grace. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Because if and I know Satan takes us down memory lane sometimes and our memory our that lane isn't good. We can always find our problems and of our past and and then he always brings it. Well, see, it's this is going wrong today because of you've done this and you've done that and and and boy, and if he gets us going down that lane, there's not good things about it cuz he loves to bring up the the past and it's usually pretty bleak. But here Paul is saying God saved us. He called us with an holy calling not according to our works. Whether it's bad works, good works, whatever. &gt;&gt; That had not your calling, your salvation had nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world begun. But now is made manifest by the appearing of our savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death. And I really like this part. And hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. That's powerful. &gt;&gt; What is the gospel? I mean I mean he just showed us what the gospel is. &gt;&gt; It's bringing life and immortality to light &gt;&gt; through the gospel. &gt;&gt; Now Paul in the beginning of that he called it the promise of life. So it's not a sexual life. It's not that old nature that's that's that's not what the gospel's bringing up, &gt;&gt; but it's the promise of life &gt;&gt; that God has given before the foundation of the world. Did you know that you're predestinated to life? &gt;&gt; You're predestinated to eternal life. &gt;&gt; It's a promise of life. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Christ abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. See, Satan has promised to destroy our soul. He set out to destroy us. But God made a promise of life. Ain't that right? And this promise has been brought to light through the gospel. You see, the gospel, it's the gospel of grace. Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to them that believe." Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Think of that now. God would even provide a gospel to declare unto us that there is a promise of life and immortality. &gt;&gt; You may be scarred. You may be wary. You may be going through the the the greatest battle of your life, but there is a promise of life and immortality. &gt;&gt; Satan may be saying, "I'll destroy their soul. I'll take them down." But there is a promise of life and immortality. &gt;&gt; That's what the gospel's all about. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; If you're really declaring the real gospel. I want to declare the real gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring to light this this promise of life and immortality. Church, we're getting ready to go home. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It ain't time to weep. It ain't time to mourn. It's time to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We've heard the gospel. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not ashamed of the gospel, &gt;&gt; church. We shouldn't be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God unto salvation. Do you realize that how simple the gospel is and yet how powerful it is? I've seen it save the drunks. I see to deliver them. I have seen drunks come in drunk and leave sober. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; We've seen the power of God touch people. &gt;&gt; Why? Just simple preaching the gospel, Sister Kim. That's all it is. And and and the people that can just believe it. What changed your life? &gt;&gt; Because of your willpower. No, the gospel was preached &gt;&gt; and you believed it. And there was a power in that gospel that had the power to save you, to to deliver you, to set you free. And I say it's still setting us free. &gt;&gt; It's still making us whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not defeated. We're stronger than ever. &gt;&gt; And we have no confidence in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's ever a desire in our hearts, that's to win Christ. I want to be so full of Christ, so full of his power, so full of his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said Moses, Noah's message was a message of grace to the people. Think of that. Just a simple man preaching the gospel. Amen. And yet, it was a message of grace, not law to them. It was grace. He was warning them. That was the grace of God before judgment ever struck. It was the grace of God to send a message to warn them that judgment was coming. God's wrath was getting ready to be poured upon the earth. But there was a provision. And brother Brandham said, "See God making his way and giving the people his covenant, how they could escape." That's what Noah's message was about. Amen. It wasn't just about uh judgment coming, but it was God making a way, giving the people, Amen. his covenant of how they could escape. It had salvation in it. &gt;&gt; The message of Noah had salvation in it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Salvation was a place to escape. That ark was a place of salvation to them people in that day. That's right. There was no need for them to have confidence in their flesh. &gt;&gt; There was no need for them to try to build their own refuge when God had sent a message to be their refuge. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? They didn't need to do anything. Amen. The prophet said they was over there building their own boats, but they didn't need to build their own boats. God had provided an ark, a way of safety. All they needed to do was act upon what they had heard. The message that Lot re received was a message of grace. They didn't need to refine it. They didn't need to get in a theologian to to interpret for them. God made it so clear to them, get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before destruction ever hit, get out of here and don't turn back and look. It was a message of grace to them &gt;&gt; so they could escape the judgment. Can you say amen? Church, we too have received a message of grace. It ain't nothing about what we do. It's not about us leaning on our own flesh and our own works. It's simply a message of grace for us to believe and act upon it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Brother Brandham said his son, God sent his son to die and became a a propitiation for our sins and that he could forgive our sins, that he could cleanse his tabernacle, and that he could live in us. Oh, wow. What a what a way of escape. Amen. That God didn't build a natural ark. Amen. He didn't produce something natural, but now he's looking into living within us, claiming us as his own to where he's able to have the preeminence. Can you say amen? We talk about having the perfect faith. Brother Bram said only there it it there's going to require more faith today than there ever has in any age. And if you're looking at that, you're thinking, "Oh my god, I've got this fault and I've got that fault. How in the world could I have it?" Amen. How in the world can this happen? But he comes inside of us and he begins to believe his own word. The more the word is preached, that word God inside of us, that Holy Ghost inside of us begins to believe through us. Amen. And I promise you, Amen. There is a faith that is in you that will be expressed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I believe it &gt;&gt; because we're not leaning. We're not having confidence in the flesh. God once lived in man. Then sin drove him away. Then God killed his own son and then let God come back and live in his people again. Another place he says God the father dwelt in him that he might use his blood for sanctification and cleanse his church with that same spirit to live in his church to perform the works and the signs and fulfill the scripture that he promised in the last days. As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. Can you say amen? So, he didn't save us for us to establish go, you know, to establish our own righteousness as Paul said. How how is it? You've begun in the spirit and now you're being made perfect in the flesh. H how how h how did that start? How did that end up that way? Amen. Because someone started steering them into the law and they started depending upon works of c uh the works of their own righteousness instead of just dependent upon the works of God, the grace of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, the word is what separates us in closing. It separates us from our sins and sickness. And we believe unto salvation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It brings to light eternal life and immortality. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; It brings to light the gospel that is preached in this age. It it it's not it's not bringing creed to us. It's not it's it's this message is a pure gospel that is bringing to light eternal life, the promise of life and immortality. And all we do is just accept it. You believe that? &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do is just accept it. Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe under salvation. We've talked about it. You know, brother Bram preached uh a few sermons on it. Uh you know about the waters of separation in the Old Testament. God established the water of separation. And brother Brandham said, "If any man had done wrong or anything, these ashes of this heer was placed upon him. It had to be a red hepher which spoke of Christ. He was separated. The ashes of this hepher was placed upon the worshipper. You had done wrong or whatever and he was separated from his guilt. If he was unclean in this water of separation as a memorial through all their generations to know that this heer, a selected hepher, a special hepher, a and the blood stood between him and the church and that ashes of it made a separation between him and his guilt. When you see that and place it on Christ Jesus, how that when we do guilt, we look at the separation. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He who stood at the judgment there, his blood was dipped from his body, sprinkled across the earth between that and God's holy tabernacle that every believer coming into his presence, breaking through the veil of the flesh, putting away the things of the world knows that the blood makes an atonement the waters of separation. And God through his mercy has washed us and separated us by the washing of the word by the water and separated his church from the things of the world unto a separated consecrated life to live for him walking in this present world without condemnation. Aren't you glad for that? There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but has been separated by the water through the word, has anointed them by the Holy Ghost, and the ashes of separation has been sprinkled upon the individual, and he walks in this present world free from condemnation by the Holy Spirit. Oh, do you love him? If the musicians will come, not our righteousness, it's his righteousness. How could we separate from our sins? &gt;&gt; But God provided a way. &gt;&gt; How could we separate so that we wouldn't have to stand at the white throne judgment? We wouldn't have to go and face God's wrath that is fixing to come upon the earth. that we could believe and stand true with peace in our heart because God provided a way to separate us from the world. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; And all of our past, all of our works, all of our goodness, everything that we thought we just counted all but dunk. That mean we may win him. Amen. I hope it's helped you tonight. I want to I I want to be in found in his righteousness. It's not my perfection. It's his perfection. Aren't you glad for that? You love him. Amen. Amen. What's on? Chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like of love his mercy reign, unending love, amazing grace. Sing it again. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior ransom me. And like a flood his mercy reigns. Unending love. Can we go up a key? Oh, the Lord has promised good to me. His word, my hope it secures. Oh, he will. my shield and portion as long as life. Sing it now. All my chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior, answer me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace. All the earth shall soon dissolve like snow. The sun forbear to shine. But God who called me here below will be forever. Aren't you glad for that? All my chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior, ransom me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns. Unending love. Amazing grace. Sing it now. All my chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior, ransom me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns. Unending love, amazing grace. Oh, unending love, amazing grace. Here's that song. Uh, where would I be? God only knows. I'm glad to see through the eyes of love a hopeless case an empty place if it wasn't for grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. Aren't you glad for grace? I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was a hopeless case. Oh, an empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? Lord, you only know. I'm glad you see through the eyes of love as a hopeless case an empty place if not for grace. last lines. A hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. Oh, what can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can make us whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Sing it now. Oh, precious is the flow that makes us white as snow no other found time. No, it's nothing but the blood of Jesus. All for my cleansing. This I see. Nothing but the blood. Is that all you can say? Hallelujah. All for my pardon. This my plea. It's nothing but the blood of Jesus. Oh, precious is that flow that makes me white as snow. No other found by no nothing but the blood of Jes. The last lines. Oh, nothing but the blood of Jes. One more time I say it's nothing but the blood of Jesus. God bless you is our prayer. Love you. Appreciate each and every one of you. I am so glad that we have a pardoning grace. May that forever be with us and never have any confidence in the flesh. Amen. Amen. We want to remember service 11:00 Sunday and uh several is going to be going to Ohio. So um uh we want to keep them in our prayer. The Lord will be with them as they travel tomorrow and uh the TWWT camp uh true word tabernacle uh starting their camp tomorrow.
