to a higher place there's a mountain I can live upon I have made my choice and I have made my choice oh Jesus is my joy and [Applause] [Laughter] Liberty oh Babylon will never never have it hold on [Music] me oh and I have heard a voice calling me out of Babylon [Music] to [Music] a BL will never never have a hold on me amen aren't you glad you've heard the voice praise the Lord amen well it's uh good to be in the house of the Lord I trust uh everyone is uh doing well amen and um amen fighting your battles and keeping the victory amen praise the Lord uh the musicians can be dismissed amen beautiful day today Amen to serve the Lord and um uh we want to remember uh communion this evening and um also as it was announced uh remembering uh sister py and uh saw her visited with her a little bit this morning and uh doing doing good so we thank the Lord for that and getting her appetite back and um she was able to walk uh just a little bit but um praying that uh as they she starts that rehab um it'll help her out a lot better and um of course got to um um see the doctor about her arteries but just believing that the Lord will just uh unclog them amen and uh but it was good to to see her in good spirits today and um so she wanted me to thank you for your prayers and uh those of you that are able to visit call uh there and um so she's at warm Hearth uh now and uh so close uh close by so we're glad for that but uh she should be in there about two weeks I think the doctor said so um anyway if you can visit with her I know she appreciate that loves the company amen and of course um we want to keep um brother sheman sister Bethany as well as the baby in our prayer and um Lord just uh continue to be with them and um I think they're ready to come home of course uh I would be too but uh anyways um just believing that the Lord's going to just uh take care of that baby amen and um the doctors um they were going to do a spinal well you know I I most of you probably already know but they were going to uh the babies got um urinary tract infection so they were trying to figure out what caused the infection um most usually um uh for the male uh uh if he if if a male gets it then it's usually comes from the blood uh stream or so there's three ways he can get it but uh anyway so they're wanting to make sure that the infection uh if it is in the bloodstream didn't go up into the spine up to the brain and so they were going to do a spinal tap and uh doctor got ready for that and he noticed something in the spine close uh close down to um uh the tailbone there and uh so he halted that and and ordered a um uh an ultrasound so they had the ultrasound done uh but it wasn't it didn't satisfy them um there and so the doctor um is wanted to do a CT scan but in order to do that they'd have to take the baby move him downstairs and the doctor don't want to move the baby at this time and um so um uh he did tell them that he's very glad that he stopped and and did not uh proceed with the spinal tap um so anyways uh I guess you know they're kind of looking for spinal menitis and uh different things and um if if the infection has gotten up into the brain they need to take care of it right away uh the doctor said which will be about 3 weeks of medication uh to clear it up but they do not want their they'd rather not or don't want to give him the medication if they don't know if the infection is in the brain and so anyways uh so right now they're they've got the baby on a um medication to take care of that UTI uh which will be uh believe for 7 days and then at the end of seven days they'll figure out what they need to do uh so we need to just pray um that they won't have to do a spinal tap for one and um that um you know the Lord will just take care of that little child and U of course give uh brother Shmi sister Bethany a um just a real piece and um you know they're keeping their head up and uh but brother shi's about to go steer crazy he's uh you know brother Shmi he's a a people's person and and uh don't like just sitting around and so uh I'm sure he would appreciate the prayers and um uh but sister Bethany seems to be doing good and uh they appreciate all your prayers your visits and the things that you have done uh for them and uh so the Lord is good amen and so uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Revelations the 18th chapter amen good to see brother Matthew amen and working a lot of hours uh here lately but um it's always good to be with God's people amen and um we will um before we go into the word maybe we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord we certainly need him and as the prophet said you know we can by our physical ability we can open the Bible we can read it with our natural eyes but it takes God to reveal it to us father Lord we realize the sacredness of this moment as part of the service Lord our souls are resting upon your INF ible word father we want to know we want to be assured we we want to be ready and Lord It's Your word father that helps us washes us cleanses us prepares us for this great event that's coming father we don't want to take this lightly but we pray Lord that you would just anoint us anoint me Father help me to get myself out of the way and Lord Jesus that you would send your word into the audience here and or whoever might be listening online and may your spirit follow the word and Lord Quicken it to our hearts pray that you would just give me understanding and help me Lord and and uh to say what you would have us to say father for without you we're nothing oh God we commit this into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen uh Revelations the 18th chapter um and we'll just uh go ahead and read the start at the first verse and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a loud or with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and Kings of the Earth have committed fornication with uh her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people they be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues amen you can have your seats this morning and um I'm going to just use the title again uh coming out of Babylon and uh we believe that this is the age the time that God is calling his people out yes of Babylon and U if if he has called us to come out then it behooves us to know uh what we're we're coming out of uh what do we come out of um and uh this this might seem uh little Elementary to uh some of us and and uh yet there may be some here or watching online that uh don't know what it is that we've come out of uh and this isn't something that we should take lightly because our soul is resting upon this for only those that come out and truly delivered uh will be in the Rapture and uh they're the Overcomers of this laysan age right and uh so I uh I ain't I ain't a teacher like brother Terry is uh but we we pray that we can make some sense and and and these things um but if you notice that God is commanding us to come out of her and uh it's a she uh and so uh it's it's a woman that we are to separate ourselves from and have nothing to do with her and and of course uh if we look at where this woman is um uh we we could read there in Revelations the 17th chapter and the second verse it says uh so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns then if you go to the ninth verse uh it's says and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sth and so this actually gives us a um a geographical location as to where uh she is and um and we know that to be wrong right for there is no City uh in the world that has been celebrated as the city of Rome for uh its situation on Seven Hills Pagan poets and this isn't Christian this is just Pagan poets and orators uh have all characterized Rome as the Seven Hill City one writer declared Rome has has both become the most beautiful city in the world and alone has surrounded for herself seven Heights with a wall another spoke of Rome as being the lofty City on Seven Hills which governs the whole world uh one historian uh said uh to call Rome the city of the Seven Hills was by its citizens held to be at as descriptive as to call it by its own proper name uh another writer made reference to Rome by saying the gods who have set their affection on the Seven Hills making reference to Rome yeah uh another made reference to Rome when using the phrase the seven dominating heels uh there uh one Pagan Emperor wrote a letter to another and declared himself to be a citizen of Rome by introducing himself as a man from The Seven Mountains so it's widely widely known that that Rome uh uh is is sets upon uh Seven Mountains seven heels uh whatever so so this woman is in Rome um and and of course uh this woman in the Bible is is not given a good name uh but the Bible calls her the great and and so now there are there are people who will readily agree uh that uh Rome and uh is is the um or this woman the great uh is the Catholic Church uh Rome uh there but uh but the Bible also says that she is the mother of harlots she's not the mother of sons uh but she's the mother of of harlots and so uh of course the Bible saying that she is a the great a is an immoral woman or a prostitute and and she's the mother of prostitutes uh of of daughters that are immoral uh for they are Harlot she she's the mother of harlots and so what it is it's a woman who lives untrue to her marriage vow and uh and so uh now the Bible calls uh and of course Revelation is a book of symbols but uh the Bible calls her a woman uh but we we realize that woman represents uh Church uh Church uh uh Through the Bible uh uh God has used women in in uh the Bible uh to to Bear witness or as a type of of the church and so there are good women uh representing the bride of Christ there are bad immoral women or whatever that represents the the carnal Church Church uh but so so when you you look at uh Eve or you look at Sarah and you you read about Tamar or Ruth or Jezebel or Mary or uh uh they their lives are depicting uh the church and and what what is the these things uh Hagar and and and such and and so uh uh uh uh so the the bride of Christ uh Jesus talks about the wise Virgin uh well we we know that that what he was talking about when he's speaking of the wise virgin he's talking about the Church of Jesus Christ which is the bride of Christ so the Church of Christ is a woman as well and typified Through the Bible as such and and things uh the the Catholic Church by its own declaration claims to be uh the mother Church and the prophet of God says and and they're correct uh they are the mother Church the Catholic Church uh uh uh and and it is the first organization to be established right well I looked up this word organization because we talk about organization we talk about denominations and and such uh but organization is characterized by complete Conformity to the standards and requirements of an organization it's a group of persons formally joined together for some common interest um so so now uh there are other words to to that are used to describe an organization such as a society uh an institution a board or uh a fraternity or Association or or things like that so the Catholic church is is the mother of of harlots or we we could say it another way she's the mother of organizations or denominations uh denomination that is exactly what a denomination is it's an organization uh uh actually it says denomination is a religious organization whose congregation is United in at adherence to its beliefs and practices so so this is if you're going to be a Baptist uh and you join that that uh uh denomination then you are joined there by its adhering to its beliefs and its practices if you're a Jehovah's Witness if you're a Mormon if you're if you're whatever and and and so much are they joined that uh uh you know uh a lot of times you can ask them are you a Christian and they'll actually tell you well I'm I'm Baptist or I'm I'm Methodist or I'm Pentecostal or I'm I'm that and and uh um you know I uh talking to one and I actually asked him are are you are you a Christian and and of course he told me no well I'm I'm and he told me the the the denomination that he belonged to and so that that's the n 19 is is uh uh when you join that religious uh organization denomination and uh by being ad in in adherence to its beliefs and practices now brother brandom says now she is a mother talking of the Catholic church and we'll we'll try to get into it more as we go uh uh but she is a mother and has produced produced daughters so if she is a mother church then she has produced churches uh uh and and and so now he says now a daughter comes out of a woman a woman robed in Scarlet is sitting on the Seven Hills of Rome she is a harlot in other words a a prostitute an immoral woman see and has born daughters and those daughters are the Protestant churches that came out of her and then went right back into organization and nanism so this mother of the daughter churches is called a that is a woman who was untrue to her marriage vow she was married to God and then went off fornicating with the devil and in her fornications she has brought forth daughters that are just like her this mother and daughter combination is anti- word everybody say anti- word this this this this mother and daughter combination is anti- word anti-ir and consequently antir chist for if you're anti- word you're Antichrist see and so now we we know that uh Luther Luther came out of uh of of the woman uh the Catholic church and um and then became the second or uh organization then from him come uh uh uh zwingley I guess and and then Calvin and then come the Anglican church and organization uh all of them into organizations and then come down to the Methodist and out of the Methodist comes Alexander Campbell and out of uh Alexander Campbell Came John Smith and and then the Christian church and then uh out of that they they uh comes uh they broke up into four or five churches and and uh Church of Christ and then just run into all kinds of isms and and and these things and and then from there comes the Baptist uh uh church and you know from it comes a lot of isms fragments and and you've got free wi first and second and and all kinds of um uh uh uh denominations from that and then you've got the methodists and they broke and fragmented and and uh these things then you've got the Nazarene then you've got the pilgrims Holiness and and and they're they're fragmented and and it just keeps breaking off and breaking off and breaking off and then it come down to Pentecost and and and Pentecost um come out was doing great and and then and what did it do it it it organized itself back into a denomination and you've got UPC you've got uh Assemblies of God uh you got oness and you you just got so many uh uh uh uh fragments even in Pentecost and and so uh brother R says what what they done is they done the same thing that their Mammy did and uh the Catholic Church ain't that rhyme they went right back and organized and became a denomination so and and when we're thinking of these things we're not talking about the people there are good people in every denomination uh uh uh but the thing is is they're in a sinking ship amen amen you you you you know when the Titanic if if you were in another safe safe place you know and and you're you're screaming at them people to get off that ship somehow get off the ship you know well you're not mad at them people you you just know you know that that ship is going down and somebody's going to die somebody's going to perish ain't that right and and so uh um well see so the people are united in their adherence of of the beliefs and practices of that denomination and that's why it's so hard for people to understand why their denomination is is wrong uh why it's wrong is because they have built their whole life on these things but each denomination has bylaws well I I looked up bylaws a a rule adopted by an organization chiefly for the government of its members and the regulation of its Affairs and and of course every church has got to have some type of a government and and some type of a standard uh uh to to to live by uh but it's as long as it doesn't disagree with God's word ain't that right and and then every each denomination has a Creed they they live by a Creed they give this Creed to the people and the people uh live and adhere to this Creed well what is a Creed it's an aor authoritative and notice that it's it's an authoritative formula of religious beliefs so so a lot of people don't know if if they're in a Baptist Church or if they're in a in some denomination well they don't know really what the Bible says because they know more about what their Church teaches and what their Church okays and and what their Church agrees with because that's what they have to adhere to more than the word of God ain't that right and and that is the truth and so well there there was a a Creed that that was uh uh uh uh formulated at Nia Council and that was called the nyine Creed and and so I look this up the nyine Creed is a statement of Christian faith that expresses the beliefs of the early Christian Church which uh it was originally written in 3:25 at the First Council of NAIA and and hope hopefully we we can get more into that but you you ought to uh if you have the chance go go study the church ages listen to them and and and these things but but uh uh so this this come this this agree this n Council had come together uh and it it it wasn't a gathering of God remember God called his people together on the day of Pentecost and and gave them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and initiated them in the church you never see them living by a Creed you just saw them living uh and being led by the spirit of God uh but uh it so so this niia Creed uh it was held in uh this Council was held in ancient NAA um and uh the Creed was created to oppose heresies heresies and uh that that were troubling the church at the time now these heresies that was troubling the church they were Christian values that the Apostle had that was troubling and that church was was lukewarm uh or uh so-call Christians that were troubled by the gospel that that uh the the the saints were were the elect was teaching and preaching you understand and and so uh this so it wasn't a Believers that that brought this Council together actually the Believers uh uh protested it but but it was a bunch of of uh make Believers if you want to call it that and and they were bothered and they wanted to change things uh uh you know and and and so uh they formulated this Creed to oppose heresies that were troubling the church at the time uh and and so uh particularly those related to the Trinity and the nature of Christ and so uh uh a Creed also is Set uh is is a a set of fundamental beliefs a guiding principle amen so now the church begins to take it upon themselves to guide the people to direct their minds to direct their belief system to to uh um and and so instead of just the Lord running the church and as as what uh uh God intended the Holy Spirit to run the church now it was a group of uh formulating a Creed amen and this is what was going to happen is that if you join the church if you join that denomination uh so then this is what you have to live by this is going to be your your guiding principle and and how many preachers have turned down the true gospel even though they have seen it to be the truth but their denomination is against it and and and can't preach it and and such because there is a Creed that is established and if they ever go outside that Creed then they're no longer or well they're ex communicated from from that denomination and so uh the N Creed uh also called the Creed of uh uh con constant conop um is is the defining statement of belief of mainstream Christianity now uh uh now think of that so this nying Creed is is um uh the defining statement of belief of mainstream Christianity in those Christian denominations uh that adhere to it and and and so uh uh and and and this is just uh I looked it up uh on internet and just kind of studying on this night looking up what this night seem Creed is and and and if you don't mind I'm going to read this the NY Creed it says I believe and this is where all have to abide by this I believe in one God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God born of the father before all ages God from God light from light true God from true God begotten not made uh consubstantial with the father through him all things were made for us men and for our Salvation he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man for our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate he suffered death and was buried and rose again on the third day in accordance with the scriptures he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his Kingdom will have no end I believe in the Holy Spirit the Lord The Giver of Life who proceeds from the father and the son who with the father and the son is adored and glorified who has spoken through the prophets I believe in one Holy Catholic and Apostolic church I confessing confess one baptism for the Forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come amen so this is the Creed that that all most of your M stream denominations or whatever live by and and so um and if you if you notice uh the Ning Creed is officially uh one writer said accepted by the Catholic Orthodox and major Pro Protestant churches today in addition to the nying Creed there's the Apostles Creed and uh being officially accepted by Catholics and most Protestant uh denomination so then then we find that there is a a uh a um um comparison or a relationship correlation uh with the Catholic church and and the organization churches uh these things you know a a the wildest woman can bring forth a a a a girl and uh that girl be true virgin clean and all that and that girl can go straight if she wants to and and and and and so the prophet says Lutheran the Methodist and Baptist and all of them uh they went straight for a little while when their Founders were there preaching the gospel to them but now they go to shows dances television smoke you know they do everything else and stay home on Sunday you know and and so he says they have become a harlot just like their mother and and and so theyve let down standards they've let down biblical principles and and they've adopted things uh that their Church allows well you know uh how many's turned down this message because their Church doesn't teach it that way and and I I remember a man given uh a lady a Bible uh King James Bible and uh she was Catholic and and a few days later Returns the Bible to him and says I cannot read it says I've showed my priest and the priest says that's that's not right I'm I'm not able to read it and and here you are you know well that would have bothered me if someone telling me I can't read the Bible but but for them they their priest is all they know and their priest is the absolute uh their church is the absolute right can you say amen amen and and so uh the Catholic Church claim CLS to be the bride and wife of Christ uh as as you even see through the nuns how they they shave their their hair off and they pledge all their affections uh to Christ and and these things and they sincere as sincere can be but so blinded uh uh to to what God has called his bride to be now so why would God call this woman a the great uh well we we read it where and and got other scriptures but uh it's because she has committed fornication and and and and and what she has done is she's committed spiritual everybody say spiritual fornications and that is through her nickan Doctrine now the prophet says she's adopted Creeds instead of her husband's word ain't that right instead of becoming a real real true mate to her husband she took another book of Creeds and what was she the mother of harlots that did the same thing now you don't need any more explaining to that see you see where it's at what was it organization getting everybody say getting away from the word getting away from the word that's right another place committing fornication see leading people by denominations with her cup of iniquity of manmade Doctrine and pulling them away from the fountain filled with blood where the power of almighty God flows freely to manifest Jesus Christ another place what made her a well she rejected the word and took the denomination and she become a and what did her children do they were harlots which did the same thing rejected the word took to the denomination her children daughters churches and look at them now ain't that right now now to think of this influence though that this woman has this church uh uh s or uh Revelations 19 and2 tells us that she has corrupted the Earth with her fornication so she isn't just just uh in Rome sitting there corrupting her attendance in Rome but she's corrupted the Earth with her fornication uh Revelations 18:3 All Nations everybody say all nations All Nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth so it didn't just stop with ppers and beggars but it's gone up all the way to the highest ranking of government the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her I think it's strange that every president that we have from I don't know when uh it's been a few years now uh they all go to Rome for some reason uh uh to talk to the pope kind of interesting isn't it and then you've got uh most of our uh Congress and most of our Senate if not all are Catholics yes sir in some fashion or form ain't that right but but we find that all nations have drunk of the wine of her wrath in other words they have taken everybody say they have taken her nickan Doctrine they have taken her nickon Doctrine it's true now for themselves and what they have done they have done just as Cain did when he took wisdom after his mother Church Eve with his reasoning ain't that right he took her wisdom his mother church so to speak her wisdom which was reasoning Abel took Revelation ain't that right see and so the churches are doing the same thing showing what they've come from yeah amen come on yeah now uh this woman church it's also called mystery Babylon and and so when you look at it um uh one writer says it is the chief seat of adultery idolatry under the New Testament this mystery Babylon as the ancient Babylon was the chief seat of idolatry under the Old Testament see and and and so uh uh you you you the city of Rome um uh uh one one writer says that the the walls around that city of Rome was seven miles um all the way around seven miles and and brother brah says when Christianity first came to Rome there were 400 different Pagan temples the gods and goddesses within that seven mile walled City seven miles that's not too far that's right and in that City 400 we think it's rough when you got in Hickory 10 churches and that's not including Baptist and all that and and but in that seven walled City there were temples erected for gods and goddesses that's incredible High number and and so it it shows it was Pagan now uh uh Revelations 17 And1 and there came out uh came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying unto me come hither and I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters now if you go to the 15th verse it it explains what the waters are he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the horse sth are peoples multitudes Nations and tongues and you say Amen so her influence is is going to spread this is what the prophecy is ain't that right and this wh church is sitting upon the waters she's sitting upon peoples multitudes Nations and and tongues showing that she has dominance dominance over them amen she has dominance over people multitudes Nations tongues and you say Amen right just this this little old church yeah with an old pop come on brother Ram says he can stop Wars he can start wars he says you know when when you know our President says something just really for America when you know another President of Russia or president of China or whatever they they just you know but when the pope speaks All Nations adhere to it because she has dominance hello and and so she's sitting upon the waters and and and brother Bram says it shows she has power throughout all nations tongues and people so this isn't just some little guy saying you know it'd be nice if we just do this and do this and do this no no no he's got power he's got power in the White House come on he's got power in in the Senate and Congress and probably ought to be quiet huh but it's true he's got power in Nations and it's a controlling power yeah so brother Ram said she controls the world with her powers a church yeah ain't that right and not only that but she controls churches with her powers see so Revelation 17:2 um with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk right with the one of her fornication both Catholic and Protestant this isn't just her reach isn't just with Catholics it's her reach is in the Protestants and we're finding out as as as time is getting closer it ain't going to matter if you're Catholic or or Protestant they're all coming together it's becoming a big Melting Pot now ain't that right and and so uh uh so they' the kings of the Earth the inhabitants of the Earth have committed spiritual fornication with her taking her doctrines yeah taking her lifestyle true taking her Creeds in other words denying the very word of God yet having a relig religious form saying they are the bride of Christ saying they are one with God and yet committing adultery on him by taking uh a Creed of man instead of the word of God right ain't that right I hope that's all right so he carried me third verse he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored beast beast always represents power so she's sitting there with power ain't that right right and full of names of blasphemy Father Son and Holy Ghost and and such as that names of blasphemy having seven heads and Tin horns and the woman uh was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of a Abominations and filthiness of her fornication fornication is unclean living ain't that right and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wandered with great admiration so this wasn't some evil thing thing that he was looking at in in appearance she was beautiful and he was actually in admiration of her looking at her but yet he saw her with the blood of the Saints amen the origin of Babylon is found in the new in the Book of Genesis and we know the Book of Genesis is the book of Beginnings it's the C chapter every started that of today started all back there in the beginning and and uh so so uh what started there as a seed has matured in in this day reached its full potential uh in the age that we're living in Genesis 10 and 8 and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth talking of nimrod in other words he was a man of influence this Nimrod the word Nimrod it means to take to steal Rebel Tyrant and and so it it it was he who dared uh to challenge the supremacy of of God yeah he was known for his strength and ambition and he sought power and control Beyond human limits he was a mighty Hunter a a mighty warrior before the Lord wherefore it is said the ninth verse uh even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter Hunter before the Lord uh uh now you know I I looked up this and and and it says in the face of Yahweh signifying when it says he's a mighty Hunter before the Lord in the in the face of Yahweh signifying in opposition to the Lord so so he was against God he was a rebel against God and this started as a little seed in in the beginning and and and so uh uh and if you notice the 10th verse and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel Babel which is Babylon and and so uh uh that that's the original name for Babylon was Babel and and and so uh the message tells us you know uh uh that that kush uh nimrod's father actually uh began uh um uh Babel started by Kush the son of ham but it was brought to a kingdom of influence and of magnificence under his son Nimrod and so nimrod set out to accomplish three things and that was to build a strong Nation to propagate his own religion and this this matters uh uh in in this and to make a name for himself now this was the beginning and and and now we're looking at the end and we're seeing what effect that purpose that motive his actions had when he started this and how it has lingered all the way up to this time amen ain't that right uh uh so the three purposes again to build a strong Nation to propagate his own religion and to make a name for himself and he was successful at all three of of doing these things uh one writer says his his accomplishments were so Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold amongst all World governments see and and and now we know that that as he he set out to propagate his own religion it was and it was satanic inspired that's right that that that's what it was and it gained prominence in throughout the world it it just didn't stay in Babel it it spread through the world at that time up till this now and and the scripture itself identifies that with Satan if if you'll look at it Isaiah 14 And1 it says for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob and will choose and will yet choose Israel and set them in their own land and uh the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall clead to the house of Jacob and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors what a prophecy and it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou was made to serve that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the Golden City ceased can you say Amen now if you look at that this ties with Revelations chap 17 and 18 this this prophecy so so God is clearly identifying Babylon as the oppressor of his elect amen hello and God is promising that he's going to deliver them yesen that they will rule over them they're going to rule over their oppressor yes praise the Lord can you say Amen so he is for telling of the demise of Babylon now the fifth verse the Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of rulers Babylon he who smoke the people in Wrath with a continual Str I thought of that how Brother brandham Talks of him that man beating that woman remember that with that stick beating that woman and she's hunkering down and brother brandham commanded him leave her alone what was it it and and and and and he described it as as the bride being stricken beaten oppressed can you say amen he who smoked the people in Wrath with a continual stroke he that rued the nations in Anger is persecuted and none hindereth the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing amen when when is this when when when Trump gets in and stops Wars yeah right this happens when when the city of God comes and settles upon that new Earth that's been renovated Babylon no longer exists its power is broken can you say Amen yay the fur trees Rejoice at thee and The Cedars of Lebanon saying since Thou Art laid down no fell is come up against us hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their Thrones all the Kings of the Nations and all all they shall speak uh uh and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy vows uh uh the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee ain't that right but now if you notice how God goes from using the word Babylon to Lucifer in the 12th verse how art th th fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high so we can understand understand this inspiration that come to Nimrod to propagate his own religion amen uh uh is coming is is inspired from the devil itself yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble think of that church the enemy that you're dealing with is is nothing that's a exactly right little we're going to look at him and and is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did shake the kingdoms ain't that right see so so another scripture that foretells of the destruction of Babylon is in Jeremiah 51 and 52 wherefore behold the days come sayi the Lord that I will do judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded shall groan though Babylon should Mount up to heaven and though she should fortify the height of her strength yet for me shall spoilers come unto her sayith the Lord now you know to think of what purpose Russia has in this age a lot of people don't understand why Russia is existing and how she's come from nothing to become a pre pre prominence in the Earth today well we know what it is don't we that's right see and and so her yet from me shall spoilers come unto her sayth the Lord a sound of a cry Cometh From Babylon and great destruction from the land of the cines because the Lord has spoiled Babylon and destroyed out of her the great voice when her waves do roar like Great Waters a noise of their voice is uttered because the spooler is come upon her even upon Babylon and her mighty men are taken and every one of their bow bows are broken uh uh for the Lord God of recompenses shall surely requite see uh and I will make drunk her princes and her wise men her captains rulers and mighty men and they shall sleep a Perpetual sleep and not waake sayth the king whose name is the Lord of hosts thus say the Lord of hosts the broad walls of Babylon shall utterly be utterly broken and her High Gate shall be burned with fire and the people shall labor in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be weary ain't that right so so this is a prophecy of the demise of Babylon but nimrod's religion that he purposed to uh uh propagate invaded the whole world and and uh it's the basis of every system of idolatry it's it's the theme of Mythology though you know the prophet said though the names of the Gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people but yet it that idolatry started there at Babylon so Nimrod built a super Tower and he built a super religion right ain't that right now now we find that there was at one time uh uh one language in all the Earth Genesis 11:1 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar and they said go too let us build a city and a tower whose top May reach into heaven under heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth now the prophet said the motive behind the building of of the Tower of Babel was to build a man-made Earthly do Dominion right that that was the purpose to have a Dominion not just in a little section but but throughout the world can you say Amen so then uh uh uh you know uh I believe it was the prophet that that would say it and also other historians said that the reason that Nimrod built the Tower of Babel was in defiance of God God had just destroyed uh uh the the Earth with the flood ain't that right amen and and and and uh uh destroyed them and and so he thought in his mind his arrogancy that if I just if we just build a tower if God would ever do that again we would just climb up on the top and and we we'll defeat it we we'll survive you know we don't need an arc we just do it our own way what an arrogance and you say amen and and and so it was a religious Tower built to defy God himself and that's this is the seat of it a't that right and and so that same arrogance toward God has showed itself all through history of Babylon King Nebuchadnezzar for one king Bel chazar and and even in the Roman Kingdom and and now in in mystery Babylon and and so uh if you look here uh uh continue in uh Genesis 11 and 5 and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which which the Lord the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they began to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and their confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city there for it is the name the is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the Earth so again Babel is where confusion started right Bible is where Defiance from God uh uh uh uh toward God started doing something contrary and spread throughout the Earth uh uh you know but not only was there one language there was also one religion before Babel uh come into existence uh one uh historian well historians agree that that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in one God not three one and they believed in one God Supreme Eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving and good and just now that's exactly the way Pentecost started out on the day of Pentecost ain't that right the church started out one Lord one Spirit One Faith one baptism one God ain't that right yes sir and that that was the teaching there was no other teachings in the church and and and they all believe the same thing they all believe that you you know there there was no such thing as shaking a preacher's hand there was no such thing as Creeds that the church had to live by there there was no such thing as as you know uh intercession of saints and and and and confession to a priest and and all of these things but but see just as it was in in in that time uh uh so was it in this time it wasn't long after the day of Pentecost that that the nickan teaching was being taught in the first church age what 33 years or so after the the day of Pentecost and and and so that teaching of nickan ism uh was was started being taught in the first church age which was totally contrary to what God had in mind for the church in the second chur Church age it then become a Doctrine in the Third Church age C Catholicism was established at Nan Council ain't that right and so brother Bram says anyone knows that the Catholic church was brought into existence at the Nan Council see before there it was called nickan by God which means uh nicod to conquered to overcome overthrow the Ley ain't that right yes sir and and so if if you look for just a moment and I I won't keep you much longer but if if you look at it that what God says to that third Church age the Third Church age uh Revelations 2:14 I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum ain't that right the doctrine of balum and what did Bam do he taught Bao to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed under Idols totally against God totally against God what God had told them and commanded them and to commit fornication who did that balam you know historian says that balam come from that area Babel and here he is now coming and trying to entice God's people that's right ain't that right yeah so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate so it's the same thing same same kind of balum spirit that cause the people to fall away from the word of God and go into destruction true can you say Amen balam is the one that taught the Israel to stumble brought idolatry and and sinful uh uh what was that word excesses uh to Israel uh brother Braham said at Bal pure bpure and and you know that he tried to curs them but he couldn't do it he tried to get God to turn against them but he couldn't do that right remember that every time you know when he went out to curse them when he opened his mouth he did nothing but bless them and his prophecy still is is in effect of today and and so because he couldn't curse them he he invited he told BAC what you do is you invite Israel to come over for a feast a festival and and and bring them over to our side yeah and and you know brother Bram says just kind of like this tell them that we're all one it doesn't make any difference you know you you don't have to stand out you don't have to be different you don't have to you know we're all one we we do the same things you do we offer the same sacrifices you do we offer do this and we do that and we do this we're just as fundamental as you are but what Israel had they had the spirit of God with him they had the Vindication of a prophet they had the pillar of fire The Mercy Seat the Brazen altar the the brass serpent they had all of that Israel was or B was just fundamental they they were just formal in their in their religion ain't that right and and so uh um we we find that that you know B balum told B we we can't get rid of them so if you just invite them over you'll swing them your way oh my you you you'll swing all of it your your way and so that was the purpose that's the purpose of that NAIA Council yeah right that was the purpose of this whole thing and look what it has happened the whole world has wandered after her on the kings of the earth and the inhabitants of the Earth have drunken from the wine of her fornication so brother Brown said see bac's teaching come down amongst Israel and they invited the Israel uh all the Israelites up to this big Feast the big blowout that they had see some big party shind dig of thing see uh uh up there they had and when they got up there these Israelite people began to see these pretty sexy dressed moabite women oh yes see it wasn't like they common girls down there can you say Amen can I say it boys don't go after sexy dressed women amen that's right and and I I have to tell you mothers uh girls keep your dresses long don't let your dresses get short and shorter and shorter trying to trying to fit in the church and fit in the world and to where people don't know who you really are God's called you to be separate from the world it's just the facts and and we're finding that in the message church that that it's already hit the Pentecostals and the Baptist and every other religion out there but we're finding it it's starting to creep into the messes churches to where somehow they they feel like they need to raise that standard up the only standard you need to raise is your convictions not your dress hallelujah praise the Lord then you say amen amen so see and and and and if you you you guys got the Holy Ghost you you won't be happy with that out there amen you'll be satisfied with God Godly dressed women Hallelujah yes well see so this is what happened is is bam BAC got these these children of God D their women up dressed them up sexy dressed for you want a lot of them men forgot that they were married maybe them boyfriends forgot that they had a girlfriend come on and see he said see so they weren't they weren't like their common girls down there oh they so pretty and buddy you know when you take the makeup let's you know like country music what do you get when you play country music backwards you get your house back your dog back your wife back you get it all back brother now I don't know what kind of music you need to play to get the woman but you you you you you take the makeup off you take the body jobs off you understand you take the face lift away she would just look very ugly well it's true that's when you say sing baby sing amen amen amen whatever your talent is get it together but beauty is not on the outside brother Brown said yes it is natural for a woman to want and be pretty and and that you should want to be pretty why do you want to be pretty that's right amen for your next door neighbor that's it or for your husband that's right can you say amen amen but then brother Brandon tells us and Paul tells us that the beauty is really in in in inside character that's right that Godly character is what makes you beautiful and any godly man with the Holy Ghost will look at that and see more Beauty than they will outside them doors in the sexy dress that's amen that's right our Our Girls shouldn't feel like they have to be in competition our wives shouldn't feel like they have to be in competition amen amen and amen God help us not to us men to make our wives feel secure yes that they don't feel like they have to be in competition am I don't want my wife dressing like the world I don't want my girls dressing like the world I want them to know that they're holy they're valuable they're more valuable than anything that's right beautiful can you say amen amen so this is what Baum he he he enticed them got them sexy dressed women and all that and oh how they were made and how they could show themselves and they fell for it and began to commit adultery Israel began to intermingle with Moab they were to be a separate nation calling to God all together and they mingled they intermingled and the prophet said God never did forgive them you say amen amen see so they committed whoredom see and they fell for it and began to commit adultery and Bam know if God wouldn't curse him he'd take them over on this denominational side and cause the anger of God to kill them anyhow and let God kill them himself if he could ever get them out of the way of Truth you see what Satan wants to do get you out of the way of Truth and let God do it that's right right well babylon's and her daughters going to be thrown in the bed of worldliness and they're going to be killed with death can you say amen and it's happening spiritual death yes it's true so Satan has been the one that's always caused confusion he's the one he's the one that's always trying to steer up trouble he's the one every time that God sends a Revival Satan is the one to try to get distract the people from revival distract them from what God is doing amen ain't that right but God always has a people who will not go astray did you know the the the prophet says that well he says history Bears it out that those tribe those of the tribe of Shem remember there was ham Shem and japheth ham was cursed of God for what he did to his daddy right and and Nimrod Kush was the son of ham and Nimrod was the son of kush see coming from that hamide but there was a side of Shem and history says that those of the tribe of Shem Shem uh stood with the unchanging truth and were in solid opposition to those of ham who turned away from truth to the devil's LIE there's going to be somebody that stands for this truth that will not bow a knee they just ain't going to do it can you say Amen see so so all the ancient historians agreed that the Babylonia religion was not the original but it was the first to drift away from the original and and and so it was there at Babel that Satan corrupted the minds and hearts of men to where they rejected the truth think of that they rejected the truth and and so as he has set out to do uh from the very beginning he set out uh uh uh he drew worship away from God so that he himself could receive worship as though he were God and the servant uh instead of the servant and creature of God he he he posed himself to be God instead of the creature of God and he done this to be exalted ain't that right and he was able to accomplish what he started out to do do and what he started and and and was doing it spread throughout the whole world look at this we read of this in Romans 1:21 and I I won't keep you much longer uh uh actually if the musicians will come um so when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful now this all started remember this all started at Babel and years and years years and years it's all now is still filtrating when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to unclean to the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever ain't that right see so so being vain in their imaginations this is where the people are today vain in their imaginations coming up with all kinds of things that's right and the Heart being filled with Darkness they accept Ed a corrupted religion till they worship creatures and not the Creator and what is Satan he's a creature he's a creature of God ain't that right the son of the morning amen and notice Paul identifies him there in 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 as the one who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he has God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God see not that he's a creature but that he is God that's can you say Amen so it wasn't just a confusion of languages that started there it was a confusion of religion right confusion you love the Lord we could go on and on about these things and Lord willing we'll continue uh uh on but I I'm so glad that God has called us out of confusion called us out to where we can truly know what we believe amen we can truly know the real God amen amen I love the Lord amen amen thinking of what brother brandham said you know of how that people are worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God that's right and Satan is being put up on the thr by his people by the people because they have gotten so twisted up yes they don't even know God anymore claiming to know him claiming to have him claiming that his name is with him but God says I'll put my name in nowhere I ain't going to put my name there's only one place I'll put my name that's right ain't that right and in that place I'll meet the worshipper any other place any other gate any other thing I ain't
