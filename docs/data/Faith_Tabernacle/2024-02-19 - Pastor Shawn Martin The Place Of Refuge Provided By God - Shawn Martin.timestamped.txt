[19:27] didn't the signs are obvious they are
[19:34] everywhere all that we hear about is the
[19:38] Gloom in

[19:44] the end of it
[19:47] all cuz Mother Earth can't take much
[19:51] more Hammer's going to
[19:53] fall so Nature has its needs that it's a
[19:59] lesson
[20:01] learned but it appears to me there are
[20:05] greater
[20:07] concerns cuz we can save the planet
[20:11] thinking we would somehow
[20:14] survive but father time is calling us
[20:19] save somebody's

[20:48] alive for future
[20:53] generation if we could find a way to

[36:17] just drive that uh every evil spirit
[36:21] away father and may you just feel at
[36:25] home and have Liberty to just work a
[36:29] supernatural work within every one of us
[36:32] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[36:36] amen praise the Lord um Hebrews the 6th
[36:41] chapter and we're going to start at the
[36:43] 13th
[36:44] verse it says for when God made promise
[36:49] to Abraham because he could swear by no
[36:52] greater he swear by
[36:55] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[36:58] Bless thee and multiplying I will
[36:59] multiply thee and so after he had
[37:02] patiently endured he obtained the
[37:05] promise for men verily swear by the
[37:09] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[37:11] to them an end of all Strife wherein God
[37:15] willing more abundantly to show unto The
[37:17] Heirs of Promise the immutability of his
[37:20] counil confirmed it by an oath that by
[37:24] two immutable things in which it is
[37:27] impossible or was impossible for God to
[37:30] lie we might everybody say
[37:34] ween might have a strong consolation who
[37:38] have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon
[37:41] the Hope set before us which hope we
[37:46] have as an anchor of the Soul both sure
[37:49] and steadfast and which entereth into
[37:52] that within the veil whether the
[37:55] Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus
[37:59] made and high priest Forever After the
[38:02] order of
[38:03] MDC amen you can have your seats this
[38:07] evening and um the scripture reading
[38:11] that we uh read there uh there's a lot
[38:14] that can be said uh about it and uh but
[38:20] um I guess what stood out to me for uh
[38:24] tonight is is where Paul mentions the
[38:28] people who have fled for Refuge they
[38:32] have fled for Refuge now thinking of
[38:35] that uh the word
[38:38] fled um it means to run away from danger
[38:43] uh to run away from Evil to hurry toward
[38:47] a place of
[38:49] security so uh there that that's it's an
[38:53] action uh that we have left one place
[38:58] going to another uh getting away from um
[39:03] and and so uh you know there's different
[39:06] places that the Bible talks about
[39:10] fleeing um uh it tells us to flee from
[39:15] idolatry flee
[39:18] fornication flee youthful
[39:21] lusts uh so so uh we are to a people uh
[39:27] that have fled right in second Timothy
[39:30] 3:5 Paul forto of of a people having a
[39:35] form of godliness but denying the power
[39:39] thereof from such turn away
[39:43] flee uh um and and
[39:47] so the the Christian Life uh there there
[39:52] there has to be some
[39:53] fling uh you you got to flee and and so
[39:59] uh the Bible uh tells us in another
[40:02] place shun the very appearance of evil
[40:07] and so you you have to flee from it if
[40:10] you're wanting to be safe ain't that
[40:11] right flee from it uh so so brother
[40:16] brandham when he preached on the
[40:19] greatest battle ever fought he was
[40:21] preaching to the Bride of Jesus
[40:24] Christ uh the destinated those who have
[40:28] had their names written on the Lamb's
[40:30] Book of Life and and and so he's not
[40:34] talking to Sinners he's not talking to
[40:36] make Believers he's he's actually
[40:38] talking to to True Believers and and
[40:42] he's talking about that there's that
[40:43] battle and in that sermon uh brother
[40:46] Brandon mentions a woman um Nelly
[40:50] Sanders um who had got saved uh he he
[40:54] had just been saved I I think he said
[40:57] for a year or so and uh she was just a
[41:00] young young woman and uh but uh uh
[41:04] before she got saved she was a dancer
[41:07] you know they go down to different
[41:09] places and dance with this uh fell by
[41:12] the name of Lee and uh they were the
[41:15] best dancers in the country brother
[41:17] brandham said and I guess pretty good uh
[41:20] but one night she came to the Altar and
[41:23] and and brother Brown said she just
[41:25] stayed there and she cried and she
[41:27] prayed and she told God that she would
[41:29] never listen to the things of the world
[41:32] again and all at once a lovely sweet
[41:35] peace come over her soul and she raised
[41:37] up from there shouting and praising God
[41:40] and glorifying God and so it was a
[41:43] tremendous thing for her to experience
[41:45] and so she was going good doing good uh
[41:49] uh and so 8 months later she had bought
[41:52] some material to make her a dress and so
[41:55] she was walk walking down the street and
[41:58] and I guess with with whatever she had
[42:00] bought and and um uh she happened to
[42:05] pass by a a a a night club or a place
[42:09] dancing where they were out there were
[42:11] all dancing and and uh uh it it it that
[42:15] music caught her and so she stopped and
[42:18] she began to listen to that music and
[42:21] brother Braham said now that's where she
[42:22] made her mistake she stopped for a
[42:25] moment see she just listened just listen
[42:29] see and she said well I'm going to think
[42:32] you know said Lord you know I love you
[42:34] though and you know I love you Lord and
[42:37] but I can sure remember the time when
[42:39] Lee and I used to win all the cups and
[42:42] so forth and trophies see and and my I
[42:45] remember that old music used to attract
[42:47] me but it don't now you know and and he
[42:50] says uh-oh he said see you you just
[42:53] think it don't but it's already got your
[42:56] right there see that's just as good as
[42:58] he wants right there and she said well
[43:01] maybe if I walk up on the steps there
[43:03] and and maybe I'll be able to testify to
[43:06] some of them and he said right there
[43:08] you're right on the devil's grounds and
[43:10] he said stay out of it shun the very
[43:12] appearance of evil flee in other words
[43:15] right and uh but she walked up and the
[43:18] tops of the stairs and stood there a few
[43:20] minutes first thing you know she was in
[43:22] some boy's arms out on the floor and and
[43:25] then she comes to herself so she she she
[43:27] finds where goes to where brother
[43:29] Brandon was living he was standing there
[43:31] with his mom before he got married and
[43:33] so he was standing there with his mom
[43:34] and she was just a balling and and he
[43:37] says what what happened Ellie and and so
[43:40] she began to tell him the story and she
[43:42] says oh I've passed the line of Mercy I
[43:45] there's no hope for me and I'm just lost
[43:48] forever and and and brother Bram says oh
[43:51] I don't think that he said uh he said
[43:54] the Bible says you know uh they shall
[43:56] cast lay hands on the sick they shall
[43:58] recover they shall cast out devils in my
[44:01] name and so um he says well then brother
[44:04] Brandon began to talk to the devil and
[44:06] he said now I devil I don't know who you
[44:08] are but I'm telling you now this is my
[44:11] sister and and and and you ain't got no
[44:14] business withholding her she didn't mean
[44:16] to do that she just stopped for a minute
[44:19] and that's where she made her mistake
[44:20] though and I said but you're going to
[44:22] have to come out of her you hear me and
[44:24] and he said so help me God at the
[44:27] Judgment bar he says you know that
[44:29] screen door be to opening and shutting
[44:32] by itself plump plump there at the door
[44:34] and uh plump K plump K plump you know
[44:37] and she said bill look at their said you
[44:40] know and he he he said I I said yeah I
[44:43] said what is that I don't know he said
[44:45] well never neither do I and the door
[44:47] just Pump It pump you know and shutting
[44:50] like that and I thought what's the
[44:52] matter here what's the matter and he
[44:53] said I looked again and I said Satan
[44:56] leave her in Jesus name come out of her
[44:59] and he said it looked like a great big
[45:01] bat about you know long just long rose
[45:03] up behind her with long hair hanging
[45:06] down out of its wings and off of its
[45:08] feet and was going woo you know and
[45:11] started right towards me just as hard as
[45:13] it could and he said oh Lord God the
[45:16] blood of Jesus Christ protect me from
[45:18] that amen and and and so it it was a
[45:22] refuge for him but but you know she
[45:26] should have fled ain't that right and
[45:28] and so you know people don't think that
[45:30] the devil's real um we we actually have
[45:34] some uh kin folk that that actually
[45:36] believe that is is that he's not real
[45:39] and uh but but he is real and and we are
[45:43] to flee from him in other words every
[45:46] day is going to be a battle every day
[45:50] you you you've you you you've got to you
[45:53] know uh um uh uh you you you can't
[45:57] entertain things see you you you don't
[46:00] want to hang around evil things and and
[46:03] I'm talking to all of us because there
[46:05] there's not one that that can um uh well
[46:10] be a
[46:11] repellent uh uh from things in other
[46:14] words I I don't care who you are you
[46:16] hang around the bar long enough then you
[46:19] you're going to become a drunk it it's
[46:21] just that way and so no matter how
[46:23] secure you feel that you are and and we
[46:27] believe in eternal security but we also
[46:29] believe in shunning the appearances of
[46:31] evil too and and so uh you don't want to
[46:34] hang around those things the old saying
[46:37] you know uh brother Bram said his mom
[46:38] used to tell him quite often said you
[46:40] know you lay down with the dog that's
[46:42] got fleas you'll get up with the fleas
[46:44] too you know so so it it it's just that
[46:47] way and brother Ram said you take a
[46:49] woman that's no good and let a girl uh
[46:51] you said put put her with a decent boy
[46:54] and the first thing you know he he's as
[46:56] he's as honory as a pup you know he said
[47:00] turn it right vice versa you know he
[47:02] said because you're known by your
[47:04] company separate yourself come out from
[47:07] among them and be ye separated so uh I I
[47:10] think that is very important for us to
[47:13] to understand that that Christians are
[47:17] Christians because they have fled amen
[47:20] you you talking about strong Christians
[47:22] the reason why they're strong Christian
[47:24] is because they have fled can you say
[47:27] Amen they they have fled for Refuge see
[47:31] a a a person that don't
[47:34] recognize uh when danger is lurking
[47:37] nearby then he or she uh uh will not
[47:40] feel the need to flee or to run away
[47:43] they they just feel like they're they're
[47:46] everything's going to be okay well the
[47:48] the the deal is is Jesus told us about
[47:51] this age he foretold that that it that
[47:55] that our enemy is going to be so
[47:57] deceptive and and and things till it
[48:00] would deceive the very elect if it were
[48:02] possible ain't that right amen and and
[48:05] and the reason of this deception is
[48:07] because the enemy has disguised himself
[48:10] in such a way uh uh to where that we
[48:14] actually see people running to harm
[48:19] running two things that will destroy
[48:22] them trying to find Refuge is because
[48:26] they don't know which way to go they
[48:27] don't know the enemy from from the
[48:29] friend if you understand so they run to
[48:32] the bottle and drugs trying to find
[48:35] satisfaction they run to entertainment
[48:37] trying to find peace they they they turn
[48:40] to formal religious Traditions uh to
[48:42] find hope they turn to false doctrines
[48:45] and uh run to the unbeliever and the
[48:47] make believer trying to find Refuge they
[48:50] run to the seminaries and run to uh
[48:53] Impostors impersonated and they even run
[48:57] to the gifts uh uh you know even when
[49:01] they are being used contrary to what uh
[49:04] the Bible and the message teaches and
[49:06] and things like that and and it's
[49:09] because they don't discern the the enemy
[49:12] they they're they're in this state of
[49:15] deception and they're trying to run
[49:18] they're trying to uh everybody knows
[49:21] that and and even the world knows the
[49:23] world's falling apart they're trying to
[49:25] fix of course but uh brother Brown says
[49:28] that's why we got our com comedy and
[49:30] joking and Frolic and all that because
[49:32] they know uh that that something's
[49:35] coming and maybe they can't figure it
[49:38] out we know what it is but but they're
[49:41] they're trying to ignore it it's like
[49:43] the boy scared to death running in the
[49:45] graveyard walking through and he's
[49:46] whistling and he's trying to convince
[49:48] himself it's okay I'm not scared but the
[49:51] fact he's whistling he is scared you
[49:53] know and so people are trying to find
[49:56] answers but they're running to the wrong
[49:59] things uh uh to to and they're running
[50:02] actually to things that are destroying
[50:05] them you can't hide in in in movies and
[50:08] entertainment and things like that
[50:11] expecting to uh uh that you're going to
[50:13] find safety it ain't going to work that
[50:15] way and so if you hang around
[50:18] unbelievers you're going to become an
[50:19] unbeliever if you hang around critics
[50:21] you're going to become a a a Critic if
[50:23] you hang around lukewarm Believers
[50:25] you're going to come become uh such as
[50:27] that if you hang around unbelief you're
[50:29] going to be filled with unbelief uh so
[50:32] so you have to understand uh what to run
[50:35] from and what to run to ain't that right
[50:39] Amen brother Brown said if you hang
[50:40] around a thief you're going to be a
[50:42] thief it's just that way you'll be a
[50:44] thief yourself and and so this is why
[50:48] that a a young man should not hang
[50:50] around uh young girls or young men uh uh
[50:54] that don't uh that don't believe the
[50:56] message of the hour you you should not
[50:58] make yourself comfortable around them uh
[51:01] uh I understand you have to work with
[51:03] them you have to you have to uh go to
[51:05] school and and and things like that but
[51:07] you should not make them your your uh
[51:10] friends uh in such a way to where you
[51:12] hang around them I think you ought to be
[51:14] friendly of course and and how do you do
[51:17] and and you know things like that but
[51:19] when they become your running buddy uh
[51:22] uh that's why we don't believe that a a
[51:24] a girl uh should date an unbeliever or a
[51:26] boy should date an unbeliever and
[51:28] Parents Ought to teach their children
[51:30] that too amen but uh because uh uh you
[51:34] you you you shouldn't hang around people
[51:36] that smoke and drink and do drugs and
[51:39] and all of these things it's it's just
[51:41] you you can't get on the devil's grounds
[51:45] and then expect to maintain a Christian
[51:47] Life you you just can't we are a people
[51:50] that you've got to flee if if you're
[51:53] going to be a Christian flee to Refuge
[51:55] ain't that right amen see so uh uh you
[51:59] know uh uh now Paul would tell us that
[52:01] there is a people who have fled for
[52:04] Refuge amen and and and I'm I I I I
[52:08] believe that people have recognized the
[52:11] enemy uh in this day ain't that right so
[52:14] we're constantly we're constantly trying
[52:16] to get away amen and and running for
[52:18] shelter we we understand that I uh I
[52:21] don't care how long you've been serving
[52:24] the lord uh uh always got to keep your
[52:27] guard up at all times because the devil
[52:30] is doing everything he can uh uh to suck
[52:34] you out I mean that's just the facts he
[52:37] just is and he's good at what he does
[52:39] ain't that right but these people have
[52:42] fled which means that they have
[52:44] recognized the enemy they're not running
[52:46] to the enemy amen but they are
[52:49] separating themselves from the very
[52:51] things that would harm them and Destroy
[52:54] them and therefore they are the ones
[52:57] that's are overcoming because that's
[52:59] what the prophet says to overcome means
[53:02] to recognize the devil in everyone in
[53:06] every one of his tricks ain't that right
[53:08] amen recognizing the devil in his tricks
[53:13] every one of his tricks you can
[53:15] recognize the devil in that pinpoint the
[53:18] spirit ain't that right so God has
[53:21] called us to overcome God has not called
[53:24] us Amen to be lukewarm God has not
[53:27] called us to entertain unbelief and and
[53:30] to be weighed in the balance and and
[53:32] whether you know I should go or whether
[53:34] I shouldn't whether God's promise is
[53:36] right or whether he's not and just
[53:37] playing the game he loves me he loves me
[53:39] not I'm going to I'm going to overcome I
[53:41] don't know if I'm going to overcome I'm
[53:42] I'm going to make it I don't know if I'm
[53:44] going to make it he's called me I don't
[53:46] know if he's called me and you're just
[53:48] constantly going back and forth ain't
[53:50] that right God has not called us to do
[53:52] that but God has called us to overcome
[53:55] amen which means that we are not to be
[53:58] the victim but we are to be the Victor
[54:01] we are to
[54:03] obtain Victory ain't that right well
[54:06] there's three words that come together
[54:08] and and and and really associate
[54:11] together that's overcome conquer and
[54:14] victory everybody say overcome conquer
[54:18] and victory they all speak of the same
[54:21] thing see if you if I if you have
[54:23] overcome that means that you have
[54:26] conquered and if you have conquered that
[54:29] means that you have Victory ain't that
[54:32] right how many wants Victory amen no
[54:35] sense in just going through life
[54:37] depressed there's got to be a victory
[54:40] amen there's no sense in in going and
[54:42] just coming to church and can barely
[54:44] lift our hands up there's got to be some
[54:46] victory involved amen Christian life has
[54:50] victory in it and so if if we've
[54:53] overcome and conquer and we now have
[54:56] this Victory and the Victory is not just
[54:59] when we make it to Heaven I believe that
[55:02] Victory is now that's what brother Ram
[55:04] says about dancing when you see someone
[55:06] dancing in the spirit genuine Spirit he
[55:09] said that's a sign they've got Victory
[55:12] we were not going to dance around the
[55:13] throne uh and and then we just sit here
[55:16] and just struggling I believe that we
[55:18] can dance even now I believe we can have
[55:21] Victory now I believe that amen because
[55:24] well brother Ram says conquer and
[55:25] victory is the same to conquer to
[55:28] conquer it means to beat down to
[55:30] override to handcuff to throw into
[55:33] prisons that means that the sin that
[55:35] once ruled you you rule it now can you
[55:38] say amen amen you rule it now it means
[55:41] that you have overcome it you are you
[55:44] have whipped it you're greater than it
[55:47] is you're greater than it is aren't you
[55:50] glad for that so you're not just in the
[55:53] mck in the mire with every everybody
[55:55] else struggling to make it amen not
[55:58] knowing the power of God not knowing the
[56:00] realities of God you realize that 99% of
[56:04] church people don't even know the power
[56:06] of God they don't even know that have
[56:08] never experienced the realities of God
[56:11] well you don't want to be that type of a
[56:12] person amen that just don't know the
[56:15] realities and the powers of God and and
[56:17] and and Satan is just over there just a
[56:19] whipping you and messing you up and and
[56:22] and he's got you where exactly where he
[56:24] wants you to be
[56:25] it's it's it's you've got to flee from
[56:27] him Flee for Refuge can you say amen
[56:30] amen see so the the only way that we can
[56:34] overcome is to flee from the enemy amen
[56:38] and find a refuge a place of safety you
[56:42] know ever since the fall of creation uh
[56:45] uh uh uh man and and even even well all
[56:49] creation I guess or uh um uh well you
[56:54] know man has needed a refuge at some
[56:57] point we've needed a refuge from storms
[57:00] and and uh uh typhoons and tornadoes and
[57:04] we we've needed a refuge from the cold
[57:06] from from the Heat and and and lightning
[57:10] and floods and and need needed a refuge
[57:13] from wind and and fires and needed a
[57:17] refuge from from predators and and all
[57:20] these things so so really Refuge is is
[57:23] our part of life we we need a refuge you
[57:26] know our home is a refuge right amen
[57:28] it's it's nice when you can go home and
[57:30] it's raining outside and and man just
[57:33] sit there and read a nice little book
[57:35] you know or uh listen to some music and
[57:38] hearing the rainfall and you ain't
[57:40] worried about you got a refuge amen
[57:42] flooding may be outside it may be all
[57:44] slopping muddy but you're nice and dry
[57:46] and warm and toasty you know let it's
[57:49] not whatever you know because you you
[57:51] you know what a refuge is ain't that
[57:53] right thinking of a man that was uh he
[57:56] he tells the story of him being out in
[57:58] the woods hunting and and he was walking
[58:01] and and and he stopped just to listen to
[58:04] to Nature and and uh uh just just
[58:07] enjoying it and he felt something at his
[58:10] feet and and so he looked down and there
[58:12] was a rabbit that had had gotten uh
[58:16] right close to his legs and and his feet
[58:18] there and he thought wow that's strange
[58:20] and it just sitting there you know and
[58:22] it was kind of panting hard and and just
[58:25] sitting there he thought well what
[58:26] what's the deal with this one you know
[58:28] and and so he got to looking around and
[58:31] sure enough here come a coyote you know
[58:34] and that coyote is lurking around you
[58:36] know and watching but he wouldn't come
[58:38] closer see cuz he was scared of man but
[58:41] that rabbit that rabbit got so desperate
[58:44] it it was it was scared for its life
[58:46] that that he come to that man for Refuge
[58:50] to find uh uh safety from the Predator
[58:53] ain't that right amen see I thinking of
[58:56] Charles Wesley that was taking a walk
[58:59] one day it was very very windy and and
[59:02] and uh uh as he was walking he had his
[59:05] coat you know his cold and and but he he
[59:08] was he was walking somewhere and and uh
[59:12] he felt a thump between you know on his
[59:14] on his uh in his bosom there and and uh
[59:18] he he looked and opened his coat up a
[59:20] little bit and there was a bird that was
[59:22] that that was there and and it was just
[59:24] hovering it it just stood there you know
[59:27] just staying right there it found it
[59:29] found a a refuge amen from from the wind
[59:33] and and it felt safe even though the man
[59:36] but yet it he he he found a refuge and
[59:40] and and it inspired Charles to start
[59:43] writing the song Oh Rock of Ages a cleff
[59:46] for me let me hide myself and thee you
[59:50] see we we all need a a refuge at at one
[59:55] point or another ain't that right
[59:57] Sinners need a refuge and and oh if if
[1:00:00] we could ever convince them that there
[1:00:02] is a refuge that God has provided a a
[1:00:06] refuge and uh uh see that Refuge it it
[1:00:09] would break the powers of of the the the
[1:00:12] Predator the the power of the enemy uh
[1:00:16] uh in their life amen at Refuge that
[1:00:19] that we know amen can can uh free their
[1:00:23] soul from destroy ruction and but but
[1:00:26] you know uh Holy Ghost filled people uh
[1:00:29] uh need a refuge as well uh you know the
[1:00:32] devil doesn't stop at at trying to get
[1:00:34] at us just because we've got the Holy
[1:00:36] Ghost Amen brother Ram said some people
[1:00:39] think that when they get the Holy Ghost
[1:00:40] it's all over he said it's just
[1:00:42] beginning that's when you need to be
[1:00:45] persevering ain't that right amen that's
[1:00:48] when you need to be perseverant here
[1:00:50] Paul in Ephesians 6:12 he writes and
[1:00:53] he's talking about Holy Ghost filled uh
[1:00:56] uh people and he says we wrestle not
[1:00:59] against flesh and blood but against the
[1:01:02] principalities against Powers against
[1:01:04] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[1:01:07] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:01:10] places ain't that right see and and and
[1:01:13] so now now notice now we're not fighting
[1:01:16] in hopes to win a battle amen that
[1:01:19] that's not what we're fighting for
[1:01:21] because we know we've already won can
[1:01:25] you sayen we already know that we've won
[1:01:28] you know being a Christian is not about
[1:01:31] hoping to make it to Heaven being a
[1:01:33] Christian is not hoping that God loves
[1:01:35] us if you're a Christian you ought to
[1:01:37] know that God loves you if you're a
[1:01:39] Christian amen you're filled with the
[1:01:41] Holy Ghost you ought to you ought to
[1:01:42] know that you're going to make it into
[1:01:44] Rapture amen this isn't all about
[1:01:46] imagination amen receiving the Holy
[1:01:48] Ghost ain't an imagination it's it's
[1:01:50] facts it's real God's Divine Life he his
[1:01:54] Nature has now taken uh it its resting
[1:01:58] place inside of you can you say Amen so
[1:02:02] Christianity it has an assurance with it
[1:02:06] it comes with an assurance I am a
[1:02:08] Christian then I know I'm going to make
[1:02:10] it I know I'm going to overcome I know
[1:02:14] that no no no weapon formed against me
[1:02:17] is going to prosper I know these things
[1:02:20] can you say amen amen see so therefore
[1:02:24] we fight we fight not in hopes we fight
[1:02:28] because we have now received a
[1:02:31] revelation we have a revelation of who
[1:02:33] we are and we are assured as to where we
[1:02:37] are going we know that God is for us can
[1:02:40] you say Amen not always feel that that
[1:02:43] now we we not always feel that God is
[1:02:45] for us amen and and but we know that God
[1:02:48] is for us Revelation amen see we fight
[1:02:51] not because we feel good we fight
[1:02:54] because we know that God is for us it's
[1:02:57] a revelation that has come to our heart
[1:02:59] ain't that right see so then we know
[1:03:02] that the promises of God every promise
[1:03:05] that is written in this Bible is for us
[1:03:08] we know that the Rapture is for us we
[1:03:10] know that the body change is for us we
[1:03:13] know that adoption is for us we know
[1:03:15] that everything that God has promised
[1:03:17] for his church is for us we know that
[1:03:20] we're a part of the church we know we we
[1:03:22] know these things amen see and and
[1:03:26] another thing that we know is that Satan
[1:03:28] is already defeated how many knows that
[1:03:30] Satan is already defeated Satan is
[1:03:32] already defeated can you say that with
[1:03:34] me Satan you're already defeated I think
[1:03:38] sometimes we need to tell the devil that
[1:03:40] Satan you're already defeated say it
[1:03:42] verbally Satan you're already defeated
[1:03:45] that's right see well we know that and
[1:03:47] do you realize he knows that too amen he
[1:03:51] does he already had a battle with the
[1:03:53] Lord had the Keys taken from him ain't
[1:03:56] that right amen he lost the keys to his
[1:03:58] own house he lost the keys over you amen
[1:04:01] so he knows he's defeated ain't that
[1:04:03] right see so so it's good for us to
[1:04:06] remind him amen see and so if he tells
[1:04:10] us that God doesn't love us well then we
[1:04:12] automatically by revelation we know
[1:04:15] that's a lie that's right amen ain't
[1:04:18] that right so we fight we fight off any
[1:04:21] influence that he tries to put all over
[1:04:25] us if he tells us we're not going to
[1:04:27] make it well that we know that's a lie
[1:04:30] see so then we war against him by not
[1:04:35] listening to his
[1:04:36] lies can you say Amen we war against him
[1:04:40] well you're always going to be that way
[1:04:42] well we know by Revelation that we're
[1:04:44] not always going to be this way the
[1:04:46] situation is bound to change sometime
[1:04:48] somewhere it's going to because we have
[1:04:51] a promise and we have fled for Refuge
[1:04:54] can you say Amen so then we know then
[1:04:57] then our battle is not trying to be a
[1:05:00] Christian our battle is we're not going
[1:05:02] to let him influence us any longer it's
[1:05:06] a lie everything he says is a lie he
[1:05:09] tells you your children ain't going to
[1:05:10] make it that's a lie he says well you're
[1:05:13] just defeated that's a lie well you're
[1:05:15] always going to have these habits that's
[1:05:17] a lie can you say Amen so now we're
[1:05:20] fighting a a uh uh uh uh uh an enemy
[1:05:26] that we know is a lie see he's a liar
[1:05:28] the Bible says he's a liar and the
[1:05:30] father of Lies do you believe it see
[1:05:33] when Jesus was on Earth the prophet said
[1:05:35] he conquered every gate of the enemy
[1:05:37] that no other man could conquer amen he
[1:05:40] conquered the Gate of sickness for us
[1:05:42] see that's what he come to do he
[1:05:44] remember sick people he conquered that
[1:05:46] gate you don't have to conquer it he
[1:05:49] conquered it right see the other men had
[1:05:52] to conquer their own gate but you you
[1:05:54] don't have to conquer your own gate he
[1:05:56] conquered it yes sir ain't that right
[1:05:59] you don't have to conquer your own enemy
[1:06:01] he conquered it other men has to conquer
[1:06:04] their own enemies but you
[1:06:06] don't ain't that right he conquered it
[1:06:09] see that but you don't have to conquer
[1:06:12] it's already conquered he conquered the
[1:06:14] gates of sickness what did he do when he
[1:06:16] conquered the gates of sickness saying
[1:06:18] what that that he would do whatsoever
[1:06:21] things you ask on Earth and whatever you
[1:06:24] bind on Earth it will be bound in heaven
[1:06:27] he gave us the keys to that gate yes he
[1:06:31] did amen oh do you love him he conquered
[1:06:35] the Gate of Temptation by the word and
[1:06:38] the keys was resist the enemy and he'll
[1:06:40] flee from you that's right ain't that
[1:06:43] right he conquered it all conquered
[1:06:45] every sickness conquered death conquered
[1:06:47] hell he conquered death and hell he
[1:06:49] conquered what the others couldn't
[1:06:50] conquer because they were of the natural
[1:06:52] seed this is the spiritual seat he
[1:06:55] conquered the Gate of the grave and Rose
[1:06:58] up on the third day for our
[1:07:01] justification so no wonder Paul would
[1:07:03] say in Romans 8:37 we are more than
[1:07:07] conquerors ain't that right see through
[1:07:09] him that loved us for I am persuaded
[1:07:11] that neither death nor life nor
[1:07:15] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:07:18] present nor things to come nor height
[1:07:21] nor depth nor other creature shall be
[1:07:23] able to set separate us from the love of
[1:07:25] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so
[1:07:28] nothing everybody say nothing can get to
[1:07:32] us nothing can defeat us nothing can you
[1:07:37] say Amen so the prophet said now we are
[1:07:40] dealing with a defeated
[1:07:44] enemy sickness is defeated death is
[1:07:47] defeated hell is defeated everything is
[1:07:50] defeated we are disputing with a
[1:07:54] defeated enemy so therefore Satan is
[1:07:57] nothing but a
[1:07:59] bluff he's nothing but a bluff that word
[1:08:02] Bluff is a false threat or claim
[1:08:05] intended to detour or deceive someone to
[1:08:08] deceive or frighten by pretending to
[1:08:10] have strength or confidence that one
[1:08:13] doesn't really have can you say Amen see
[1:08:16] so so he's a bluff that's all he is is a
[1:08:18] bluff now so what does he do amen he
[1:08:22] still Wars he's going to war now we
[1:08:24] already know through the opening of the
[1:08:26] seals he ain't got no Arrow he just got
[1:08:29] a bow he's just a bluff he's an
[1:08:31] impersonator he's whatever ain't that
[1:08:33] right but he Wars against our flesh
[1:08:36] through through afflictions through
[1:08:38] diseases and and sickness and these
[1:08:41] things he Wars against our spirit tries
[1:08:44] to get us depressed tries to to to bring
[1:08:48] us under oppression ain't that right
[1:08:51] amen he he he works through our feelings
[1:08:53] Works through our emotions works works
[1:08:56] through things we'll have a bad day we
[1:08:58] might get up and and tired and just woke
[1:09:00] up wake up as they would say on the
[1:09:02] wrong side of the bed and he tries to
[1:09:04] take advantage of them things amen we
[1:09:06] might feel good today and say oh God
[1:09:09] loves me I'm saved bless the name of the
[1:09:11] Lord wake up tomorrow and not f a thing
[1:09:14] right and he works on them things ain't
[1:09:17] that right see then then we know that
[1:09:20] Satan anoints people to say things to do
[1:09:23] things that's wrong amen as a way to get
[1:09:26] to us he anoints lawmakers even to pass
[1:09:29] laws that restrict amen our our our
[1:09:32] freedom of worship and and and and and
[1:09:36] and if you're not careful you'll start
[1:09:37] looking at all the negatives that are
[1:09:39] around and and seeing the corruption and
[1:09:42] seeing the crime and seeing the economy
[1:09:44] and and seeing all the nations uh uh
[1:09:47] Waring and and everybody bickering and
[1:09:49] everybody fighting and and if you're not
[1:09:51] careful you start looking around and you
[1:09:53] get involved in it and that's exactly
[1:09:56] what the devil wants us to do can you
[1:09:58] say amen he he he's got a reason for all
[1:10:01] these things see amen see so he tries
[1:10:04] the prophet said he tries to Blind us
[1:10:07] from the promises of God see he he's
[1:10:10] good at that right and what does he do
[1:10:13] he whispers negative thoughts to us
[1:10:16] negative to us negative every negative
[1:10:18] thought does not well all negative
[1:10:21] thoughts uh that come to you is not of
[1:10:23] God that's that's facts amen amen he's
[1:10:28] the one who plants the negative thoughts
[1:10:29] in our mind ain't that right anything
[1:10:32] negative is of the devil and and when we
[1:10:34] talk of negative uh uh we I I mean
[1:10:38] anything against God's word anything
[1:10:40] that contradicts God's promises to you
[1:10:43] Amen in this Bible amen is is negative
[1:10:46] it's not coming from God Christianity
[1:10:49] there's nothing but
[1:10:52] positive ain't that right so feelings
[1:10:55] it's good to have feelings it's good to
[1:10:56] feel good it's good to have Sensations
[1:10:59] you know anything that that uh uh what
[1:11:01] doesn't kick is dead and and and so so
[1:11:04] we we understand it's good to feel God
[1:11:07] it's good to feel saved it's good to
[1:11:09] feel all these things but feelings lie
[1:11:11] to us all the time our feelings
[1:11:15] backslide it just does and and so then
[1:11:18] any feeling and Sensation that is
[1:11:20] against the word of God comes from the
[1:11:22] devil he has access to your your
[1:11:25] feelings he has access to your
[1:11:27] Sensations he has access Amen to your
[1:11:29] imagination and to your memory and to
[1:11:32] your affections and and to all of these
[1:11:34] things he has that access the devil does
[1:11:37] ain't that right amen he's got access to
[1:11:39] your body amen see so words that are
[1:11:42] contrary to God's word comes from the
[1:11:45] devil now you know brother Bram said
[1:11:47] well people say well I I'm weak my my
[1:11:50] faith my my faith uh is not very much
[1:11:54] I'm not a very good Christian oh my now
[1:11:57] we all now I think all of us could feel
[1:11:59] that way that we're not very good
[1:12:01] Christians now it's always not when
[1:12:03] we're on the Mountaintop but it's when
[1:12:05] we're in The Valleys it's when Satan
[1:12:07] brings up our past our failures you
[1:12:09] should have known better you shouldn't
[1:12:11] have done this you shouldn't have done
[1:12:12] this and you should have done that but
[1:12:14] you didn't you know and and he brings up
[1:12:16] these things and then we begin to feel
[1:12:18] like well we're not just really good
[1:12:20] Christians things like that well notice
[1:12:22] what he says well you people say I'm
[1:12:25] weak my faith is not very much I'm not a
[1:12:28] very good Christian that's exactly what
[1:12:30] the devil want you to say God help us
[1:12:34] you're just talking his language right
[1:12:37] then see you mustn't never say that
[1:12:41] hello on Amen can you repeat that after
[1:12:45] me I must never say
[1:12:48] that say it out loud now I must never
[1:12:51] say that say what I'm not not a good

[1:12:58] going to make it on don't say that well
[1:13:01] I don't know if my children is ever
[1:13:02] going to get saved don't say that you're
[1:13:04] talking his
[1:13:06] language that's right can you say Amen
[1:13:09] you're you're just talking his language
[1:13:11] right in you must never say that don't
[1:13:14] never let your testimony be negative let
[1:13:18] it be positive part of the time no he
[1:13:22] didn't say that
[1:13:24] sorry let it be positive all the time
[1:13:28] all the time everybody say all the time
[1:13:30] all the time only when I feel good no
[1:13:33] only when I feel safe no only when my
[1:13:36] prayers seem to be getting through
[1:13:37] finally no never or let it be positive
[1:13:42] all the time amen ain't that right got
[1:13:46] to flee from
[1:13:49] him I'm saved I have God in my heart I
[1:13:53] believe believe him with all of my heart
[1:13:55] well do you believe in Divine Healing
[1:13:57] with all of my heart amen can you say
[1:13:59] Amen see let your testimony always and
[1:14:03] your thoughts everything never permit a
[1:14:06] negative thought to come in your mind if
[1:14:08] you can help it and when it starts that
[1:14:11] don't you entertain it well you say I
[1:14:15] can't help the thoughts from coming well
[1:14:17] that that that'll be like the farmer
[1:14:18] that said he couldn't stop the birds
[1:14:20] from flying over his place but he sure
[1:14:22] sure could stop them from roosting ain't
[1:14:25] that right that's that's right you can't
[1:14:27] keep the thoughts from coming in your
[1:14:29] mind but you can sure stop from letting
[1:14:31] imp plant in your mind that's right
[1:14:33] that's right I think we're all guilty of
[1:14:36] it we need to stop it amen amen that's
[1:14:40] right can you say amen amen see so he
[1:14:44] said see that's a good thing you see you
[1:14:46] can't help the thoughts when they come
[1:14:48] but don't entertain them just let it
[1:14:51] pass amen this too shall
[1:14:55] pass you know there's that saying it it
[1:14:59] it didn't come to stay it came to pass

[1:15:28] you may not can help them thoughts amen
[1:15:30] and Satan will show you all the negative
[1:15:31] about everything and then and then he'll
[1:15:33] start Platinum things in your mind and
[1:15:35] if you're not careful you'll start
[1:15:37] believing that stuff

[1:24:40] God has been too good to us we are a
[1:24:42] people that have fled for
[1:24:45] Refuge we've got a
[1:24:48] refuge we were a slave to the devil we
[1:24:51] ain't no no more
[1:24:53] we've actually got every god-given right
[1:24:55] to tell that Old Slew Foot get out of my
[1:25:00] life hallelujah praise the Lord there's
[1:25:03] one thing that Satan cannot do he cannot
[1:25:05] touch the soul
[1:25:08] amen God showed it through a type in the
[1:25:12] first Exodus just before the death angel
[1:25:15] was to strike God required a token which
[1:25:17] was the blood of the lamb and he said to
[1:25:19] the people when I see the blood I'll
[1:25:21] pass over you right so everyone else
[1:25:25] without the blood they had every right
[1:25:27] to fear they had every right to shake
[1:25:30] and quiver and cry and boohoo and sing
[1:25:33] all these sad songs and all these things
[1:25:36] they had every right don't blame them
[1:25:40] but everyone that had the
[1:25:42] blood I think I read it here Maybe not
[1:25:44] maybe it was in Arkansas you know
[1:25:46] brother brand said anyone that went
[1:25:48] under that blood and they started
[1:25:50] fearing he said it was an insult to God
[1:25:53] that was an insult to Jehovah when they
[1:25:56] God says if I see that blood you apply
[1:25:59] that blood and and then you're under
[1:26:01] that blood and then you start doubting
[1:26:04] and you start quivering and you start
[1:26:06] fearing and you start he said that's an
[1:26:09] insult to Jehovah he says don't insult
[1:26:13] God
[1:26:16] Amen true are you with me God said he'd
[1:26:20] provide for you don't insult
[1:26:23] him Amen brother amen we say God's the
[1:26:26] one that's leading us then don't insult
[1:26:28] him by questioning
[1:26:30] it if God's leading you he's going to
[1:26:32] provide for you if he's going if he said
[1:26:34] he's going to provide he's going to
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:37] provide so he says you know when I see
[1:26:39] the blood I'll pass over you every house
[1:26:41] had to have the blood on
[1:26:44] display and when when they had that
[1:26:46] blood then it became a refuge it became
[1:26:50] a refuge they they had ran to a refuge
[1:26:53] because and The Refuge was identified by
[1:26:56] the token amen come on now you say Amen
[1:27:01] see Satan can afflict you in your body
[1:27:04] and he doesn't God now we know that
[1:27:06] God's A Healer so you don't have to
[1:27:08] accept your afflictions but what I am
[1:27:10] saying is God can heal you from a cold
[1:27:12] today and and and Satan will put
[1:27:14] something on you tomorrow so brother BR
[1:27:18] said healing is a minor thing it's it's
[1:27:20] not something we major on even though we
[1:27:23] believe it and I hope everybody don't
[1:27:24] take me wrong on that if you got
[1:27:27] afflictions God will heal you I believe
[1:27:31] that with all my heart right but that
[1:27:34] does not stop Satan from afflicting you
[1:27:36] in some other way right you can be heal
[1:27:39] healed of cancer and die in a car
[1:27:42] wreck break a leg right so Satan can
[1:27:46] afflict your body and he can also
[1:27:48] afflict you mentally see there's a
[1:27:50] physical sickness there's a mental
[1:27:52] sickness and it all comes from Satan
[1:27:54] ain't that right but I want to say this
[1:27:56] it does not mean that you're demon
[1:27:59] possessed a man that a person that is
[1:28:02] suffering in their mind having mental
[1:28:04] issues it does not necessarily mean that
[1:28:07] that uh uh they demon
[1:28:10] possessed and you say Amen now Ephesians
[1:28:13] 1:13 in whom you also trusted after that
[1:28:17] you heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[1:28:18] of your salvation in whom also you after
[1:28:20] that you have believed you were
[1:28:23] what someone know the scripture sealed
[1:28:26] yeah you were sealed with that Holy
[1:28:29] Spirit of Promise Ephesians 4:30 grieve
[1:28:32] not the holy spirit of God Amen whereby
[1:28:35] you are sealed until the your trial
[1:28:39] comes nope until the day of your
[1:28:41] Redemption amen ain't that right sealed
[1:28:44] see second Corinthians 1:21 now he which
[1:28:48] hath which establishe US with you in
[1:28:51] Christ and hath anointed us is God who
[1:28:54] hath also sealed us and given uh the
[1:28:58] earnest of the spirit in our hearts our
[1:29:03] soul can you say Amen so there is one
[1:29:07] place the devil has no Authority no
[1:29:10] power over no nothing and that's in your
[1:29:14] soul if God has if you've got the holy
[1:29:18] ghost that Holy Ghost is a seal
[1:29:22] to your soul so the devil can afflict
[1:29:24] you in your body he can afflict you in
[1:29:26] your mind he can afflict you in any way
[1:29:29] but he can not touch the main thing and
[1:29:32] that's the
[1:29:34] soul amen amen Colossians 3:2 now notice
[1:29:37] we're getting more into the Refuge now
[1:29:39] where we're at you are dead and your
[1:29:42] life everybody say my life is hid amen
[1:29:45] with Christ in
[1:29:48] God the prophet said the devil can't get
[1:29:50] to you he can't do it he has to come
[1:29:53] through the same process you did if he
[1:29:55] did that he'd be your brother so he
[1:29:57] can't get to you can you say that with
[1:29:59] me amen devil you can't get to
[1:30:03] me devil you can't get to me now that's
[1:30:06] that's not positive thinking that's
[1:30:07] reality he can't he can't if you if you
[1:30:10] got the Holy Ghost you're sealed
[1:30:13] in can you sayen he can't come through
[1:30:17] that the prophet said see a seal is a
[1:30:19] security seal means that you are secured
[1:30:22] now you you you don't believe you that
[1:30:25] don't believe in eternal security what a
[1:30:28] refuge
[1:30:31] Eternal eternal security I don't know
[1:30:34] but a seal signifies security to its
[1:30:37] destination who that guy that would try
[1:30:39] to break that seal and the Holy Spirit
[1:30:42] seal cannot be broken you all have heard
[1:30:45] me say that people said well the devil
[1:30:47] made me do that no no no the devil did
[1:30:49] not do that he said you just wasn't
[1:30:51] saved Sanctified filled with the Holy
[1:30:53] Ghost he says or or uh yeah he he uh he
[1:30:57] said you just wasn't sealed in so then
[1:31:00] because when you're sealed in he sealed
[1:31:02] out right amen he sealed out now when
[1:31:04] you you went out to him he couldn't get
[1:31:08] into you because the the only way he'd
[1:31:11] get into you is come through the same
[1:31:13] process that you would have see he'd
[1:31:15] have to be saved Sanctified filled with
[1:31:17] the Holy Ghost then he'd be your brother
[1:31:18] so he didn't do that no you just to the
[1:31:22] borderline come back lusting for the
[1:31:23] things of the world he never went in all
[1:31:26] the way over into Canaan across Jordan
[1:31:30] the death to self can you say Amen so I
[1:31:32] want to say this even to you young
[1:31:34] people if you gave your heart to the
[1:31:35] Lord that's wonderful but don't you stop
[1:31:38] there you need to get baptized in the
[1:31:41] name of Jesus Christ amen and then you
[1:31:43] need to get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:45] don't you stop
[1:31:47] there don't stop at just giving your
[1:31:49] heart to the Lord on can you say amen
[1:31:52] amen that's right don't say well I gave
[1:31:54] my heart to the Lord two years ago and
[1:31:56] then you feel all safe and secure you
[1:31:58] got to know that you are have the Holy
[1:32:00] Ghost and if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:02] there is something about you that you're

[1:32:29] you won't fall brother Bram said we
[1:32:31] backslide every
[1:32:33] day he said you will make mistakes he's
[1:32:37] saying is it's not sin yet because the

[1:32:41] mistake you'll automatically say God I'm
[1:32:43] sorry I didn't mean to do it get back up
[1:32:46] and you go again but the desire for it
[1:32:48] is gone that's
[1:32:50] right talked to people before that still
[1:32:53] have a desire to
[1:32:54] drink claiming to have the Holy Ghost if
[1:32:56] if you got that type of desire you ain't
[1:32:59] got
[1:33:00] it right you can even be
[1:33:03] Sanctified that's right I'm talking
[1:33:06] about fleeing that's right God knows
[1:33:09] what to do take care of it if you're in

[1:41:27] lives the wife should do that too you
[1:41:29] mothers you you you you you
[1:41:34] wives understand and
[1:41:37] and I I think it's amazing how ignorant
[1:41:41] men can be
[1:41:43] sometimes when they're just constantly
[1:41:45] living a selfish life they're constantly
[1:41:47] just away from
[1:41:49] home and they know not even given
[1:41:52] consideration that they are the head of
[1:41:54] that home not just for finances but they
[1:41:57] are the protector and not just by a
[1:42:00] gun but they are the spiritual protector
[1:42:04] of their
[1:42:04] home and while they're out doing their
[1:42:07] thing and I understand you got to work I
[1:42:09] understand these things but you also got
[1:42:11] a wife you also got a home you got
[1:42:14] children that need

[1:42:18] Husband by name that's right you
[1:42:21] shouldn't just be father well look I'm
[1:42:24] father cuz look at my children brother
[1:42:26] Bram says there's many instructors but
[1:42:28] very few
[1:42:29] fathers in the fact that men must be a a
[1:42:34] a uh one your children are going to
[1:42:37] follow after you amen so here we are
[1:42:40] we're Protectors of our home not just
[1:42:42] natural protectors We Are Spiritual
[1:42:44] protectors and we must realize that
[1:42:47] Satan is constantly while you're at work
[1:42:50] she may even be home but Satan's trying
[1:42:52] to put depression on her Satan's trying
[1:42:55] to destroy her Satan's trying to ruin
[1:42:58] her life and then we come home telling
[1:42:59] her how bad of a job she does and and
[1:43:01] what she's this and how she does this
[1:43:03] and how she just never fitting and she
[1:43:04] never done that and here she washes your
[1:43:06] clothes she she she watches your
[1:43:08] children she's the protector she's she's
[1:43:10] doing everything to teach your children
[1:43:11] to raise them right we ought to show
[1:43:13] them a little bit respect we are the
[1:43:15] provider We Are The Protector we are
[1:43:18] seeking a refuge
[1:43:22] right can you say
[1:43:25] Amen so then we want to live in a
[1:43:29] Heavenly
[1:43:30] environment wife and mother husband
[1:43:33] father that's what we want we want to be
[1:43:35] quick to repent and
[1:43:38] forgive can you say Amen what does that
[1:43:41] do it keeps the enemy
[1:43:44] away remember that brother brand said a
[1:43:47] lot of times people don't get healed
[1:43:49] because they got an un unrep repentant
[1:43:51] sin they got an unconfessed sin that
[1:43:54] they have not now this is not all the
[1:43:56] time but there's times that that that
[1:43:59] that remember that woman brother Brown
[1:44:00] uses it for the example the woman that
[1:44:02] cheated on her husband you know he's out
[1:44:04] in war and all that and she's running
[1:44:06] around with the guy and she's become
[1:44:08] demon uh Afflicted with demons remember
[1:44:11] she's losing her mind she was a she was
[1:44:13] she was a I think a Sunday school
[1:44:15] teacher she sung in the choir she was a
[1:44:17] churchgoer she all these things nothing
[1:44:19] could help her doctors couldn't help
[1:44:21] nobody could help finally your pastor
[1:44:24] says you need to go visit brother
[1:44:25] brandham she goes there and brother Bram
[1:44:27] just sitting there and all of a sudden
[1:44:29] come to him you you you you cheated you
[1:44:32] you run around with this man oh no no no
[1:44:35] no no no you
[1:44:37] know I've already covered that up I
[1:44:40] already apologized to godun and what did
[1:44:42] he say he said you didn't do God wrong
[1:44:45] you done your husband wrong now go make
[1:44:47] that
[1:44:49] right oh no I can't do that he'll leave
[1:44:53] he goes well that's up to you but if you
[1:44:55] want to be delivered to this you got to
[1:44:57] go make that right got to repent why
[1:44:59] because unconfessed sins keep the devil
[1:45:02] in charge it gives him a way to get in
[1:45:06] can you say amen amen but one thing that
[1:45:09] helped her out is he said your husband's
[1:45:11] got something to confess to you
[1:45:13] too right she goes confess and he got
[1:45:17] all blowing up she
[1:45:18] go didn't you go run around too on this
[1:45:21] such who told
[1:45:25] you when they made it right God healed
[1:45:28] her she got delivered can you say Amen
[1:45:31] so see unconfessed sins need to be under
[1:45:34] the blood put under the blood that's
[1:45:35] right I don't care what it is if you've
[1:45:36] done wrong if You' done someone wrong if
[1:45:38] youve done your wife your husband your
[1:45:40] children wrong don't sit there and try
[1:45:41] to make it up and don't don't sit there
[1:45:43] and use his
[1:45:45] excuses get it under the blood there's a
[1:45:49] refuge am can you say Amen you love the
[1:45:53] Lord if the musicians will come got more
[1:45:57] to go but we'll stop
[1:46:03] there you know in the Old
[1:46:06] Testament of course under the law if if
[1:46:10] a man done something wrong it was eye
[1:46:12] for an eye tooth for a tooth so even if
[1:46:15] a man accidentally murdered
[1:46:18] somebody then that family of the
[1:46:21] murdered
[1:46:22] man had every right to pursue the killer
[1:46:26] whether he accidentally did it or what
[1:46:29] so God says what I'll do and he moved
[1:46:32] upon I believe it was
[1:46:34] Joshua to
[1:46:37] provide Cities of
[1:46:41] Refuge that if if a man committed such
[1:46:46] an
[1:46:47] act he could run he could run run from
[1:46:51] his pursuer he could
[1:46:54] flee and get to that Refuge now if his
[1:46:56] pursuer got to him before he got to The
[1:46:59] Refuge then he would die but if he get
[1:47:02] to that
[1:47:05] Refuge then he could plead his
[1:47:08] case and the prophet says now if he if
[1:47:12] he if he didn't do it
[1:47:15] willfully he says you know what I I
[1:47:17] didn't mean to I uh this was happened d
[1:47:21] d d du he would be allowed to come into
[1:47:24] that
[1:47:25] refuge and the power of the enemy would
[1:47:27] be broken right then because the enemy
[1:47:30] the pursuer could never come into that
[1:47:32] refuge and snatch him
[1:47:34] out hello everything was provided for
[1:47:39] that man in that Refuge to where he
[1:47:40] could live a Peaceable life didn't have
[1:47:43] to worry can you say
[1:47:47] Amen we've got a greater a a greater
[1:47:51] Refuge than what Joshua could ever
[1:47:54] provide because our enemy is more strong
[1:47:57] our enemy is more
[1:47:59] potent our enemy had more claims on us
[1:48:02] than what you could ever think he had a
[1:48:04] powerful
[1:48:05] claim cuz we were born Sinners by Nature
[1:48:09] by birth we had
[1:48:12] no we had no saying to
[1:48:15] it amen so Satan had lay he he had every
[1:48:19] right to lay claim to
[1:48:21] our our physical being our mental our
[1:48:26] soul he could lay claim to it all and we
[1:48:30] were just his victims he could do
[1:48:32] anything he wanted to do and we just had
[1:48:34] to give into it I thought oh my how the
[1:48:37] world is in such a bondage out
[1:48:40] there and Satan is just doing everything
[1:48:43] he can to
[1:48:45] them mamas killing their own
[1:48:48] babies think what mother and her right
[1:48:50] mind would do that that she's under the
[1:49:00] control but you
[1:49:04] know brother brandom said this he said a
[1:49:06] man has got to want a place of Refuge
[1:49:08] you got to feel your need for
[1:49:11] it but if you want to fight your own
[1:49:13] battles go ahead but you're sure to be
[1:49:15] caught by your
[1:49:17] pursuers can you say amen amen
[1:49:22] what about our refuge well if you read
[1:49:25] the Bible you're studying it one thing
[1:49:27] our refuge must have is
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:31] blood remember when Cain tried to
[1:49:33] worship god without
[1:49:37] blood God rejected him oh
[1:49:43] my but Abel had a bloody
[1:49:48] sacrifice and he was accepted before God
[1:49:50] he could come and talk to God because of
[1:49:55] blood oh I think of so many people
[1:49:58] trying to find the Refuge and think
[1:49:59] they've got it but there's no blood
[1:50:02] [Music]
[1:50:04] there you see only by blood can we be
[1:50:08] accepted only by Blood could our high
[1:50:10] priest that great high priest make
[1:50:14] intercession for our sins that's the
[1:50:18] only way the high priest could make
[1:50:19] intercession is by Blood ain't that
[1:50:22] right do you realize that that's the
[1:50:24] only way we could have mercy is when
[1:50:27] blood is on The Mercy Seat brother Bram
[1:50:30] talks about it when the blood goes off
[1:50:31] The Mercy Seat then it's nothing but
[1:50:33] judgment but there's got to be a refuge
[1:50:36] with
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:41] blood we could go on and on about the
[1:50:44] blood but also our place of Refuge must
[1:50:46] have the word because the word of God
[1:50:49] will def defeat Satan anytime anywhere
[1:50:51] under any
[1:50:54] conditions no matter how weak you may
[1:50:56] feel you might feel like you're the weak
[1:50:58] as Christian but the word of God you can
[1:50:59] defeat the you can defeat the Devil any
[1:51:02] demon of Hell by the word of God brother
[1:51:05] Ram said he had Jesus had power upon
[1:51:07] power but he never used a
[1:51:09] one to defeat the Devil with he took the
[1:51:12] word of God to show that you can defeat
[1:51:15] the word of God too or defeat the Devil
[1:51:17] by the word of God and you say Amen the
[1:51:21] word of God is a
[1:51:23] law and not only does the does the
[1:51:27] accused live by that law but the accuser
[1:51:30] has to live by the
[1:51:33] law think of it how many court cases are
[1:51:37] do we have in in the country that are
[1:51:39] going
[1:51:41] on men that are accused of
[1:51:44] things and the accuser his job is to
[1:51:48] present the case of accusation
[1:51:50] ations present the facts present it
[1:51:54] all I'd hate to being that
[1:51:58] accused sitting there as the accused
[1:52:00] listening to my
[1:52:02] accuser especially when all I can say is
[1:52:05] yeah he's right he's right I did do
[1:52:07] these things
[1:52:11] right but what if that judge could find
[1:52:15] a
[1:52:16] way by the
[1:52:18] law
[1:52:21] to Pardon
[1:52:24] you and then he says but he's not
[1:52:28] guilty oh how free you must feel because
[1:52:32] then it shuts the accuser up why because
[1:52:36] the law has just said there's no guilt
[1:52:39] the law has said no matter what that
[1:52:41] accuser says he's over with his case is
[1:52:43] done he can't accuse no more the law
[1:52:46] says
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:48] it therefore the accused lives by that
[1:52:52] same law I'm not
[1:52:54] guilty and the accuser has to look at
[1:52:57] that at at the the person he's accusing
[1:52:59] and has he got to shut
[1:53:02] up there's no more case he can't put him
[1:53:05] into prison because the law says can you
[1:53:08] say
[1:53:10] Amen so therefore the accusations have
[1:53:14] no value he can recommend the life
[1:53:17] sentence he can recommend the death
[1:53:19] sentence but his recommen recommendation
[1:53:22] has no hold it has no power because the
[1:53:25] law says not guilty can you say Amen so
[1:53:30] therefore God's word has become a refuge
[1:53:33] to the
[1:53:35] accused oh do you love the
[1:53:38] Lord there's no
[1:53:42] claim against us what a
[1:53:45] refuge it's over we're
[1:53:48] free the Bible in so many places talks
[1:53:51] about how God is our
[1:53:53] refuge oh and just in I've got just
[1:53:57] scriptures you know God is our refuge
[1:53:59] and strength of very present help in the
[1:54:01] time of trouble therefore we will not
[1:54:03] fear though the Earth be removed though
[1:54:05] the mountains be carried into the midst
[1:54:06] of the sea though the waters thereof
[1:54:08] Roar and be troubled though the
[1:54:10] mountains shake with the swelling
[1:54:12] thereof we're not going to fear because
[1:54:14] God is our refuge on and on and on it
[1:54:17] talks about the Refuge God I Isaiah 252
[1:54:20] thou has been a strength to the poor a
[1:54:22] strength to the needy in his distress a
[1:54:25] refuge from the storm a shadow from the
[1:54:27] heat when the blast of the terrible ones
[1:54:30] is as a storm against the
[1:54:33] wall so God offers himself as The Refuge
[1:54:37] but I like this Isaiah 32 And1 Behold a
[1:54:40] king shall reign in righteousness and
[1:54:42] princes shall rule in judgment and a man
[1:54:45] shall be as a hiding place a man shall
[1:54:49] be is a
[1:54:51] refuge from the wind and a cover from
[1:54:54] The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry
[1:54:58] place as the shadow of a great rock in a
[1:55:01] weary
[1:55:02] land a man shall
[1:55:05] become I thought of
[1:55:08] that God being our
[1:55:12] refuge how can a man be our refuge
[1:55:15] because God became
[1:55:17] man God our Refuge took on
[1:55:24] flesh and that blood that's there it's
[1:55:27] not a natural blood from a common born
[1:55:31] sex born
[1:55:33] man it's a created blood God would
[1:55:37] create his own
[1:55:39] blood just one drop of
[1:55:42] blood is so powerful to wash away the
[1:55:46] sins of the world one drop of blood
[1:55:51] the Bible says we've been washed by in
[1:55:54] his own blood brother Brown says that
[1:55:56] washed means loosed we've been loosed by
[1:56:00] the blood of God aren't you glad for
[1:56:01] that there's blood
[1:56:04] there but only that he's coming this day
[1:56:08] he's come in flesh
[1:56:11] again the lamb has opened the book that
[1:56:14] has been sealed that's got our
[1:56:16] Redemption claims that's got everything
[1:56:18] about our life
[1:56:20] lives not our not our lives of Sinners
[1:56:23] but our lives of what he had in his
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:28] mind he got our names written down and
[1:56:31] he come to open the
[1:56:33] book Revelations 10:1 says he come down
[1:56:37] from
[1:56:38] heaven and he puts his feet upon land
[1:56:40] and sea and he declares time to be no
[1:56:42] more but he has a book it's open book
[1:56:47] right what did Brother Brown Say he come
[1:56:50] to take that book for Redemption
[1:56:53] claims to claim everything that he has
[1:56:56] redeemed what a
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:02] refuge he's reading from the book He's
[1:57:05] not reading your life story he's not
[1:57:06] reading your history you you we all you
[1:57:09] know people are so interested in their
[1:57:12] history but what if you find out that
[1:57:15] your your family tree comes from thieves
[1:57:20] Robbers no good people drunks brother
[1:57:23] brah said all of his was drunks died
[1:57:26] with their boots on what a
[1:57:28] history but God didn't read that history
[1:57:32] he read another
[1:57:33] history and he says not
[1:57:36] guilty
[1:57:38] Justified as though you never did it in
[1:57:40] the first place
[1:57:43] free you are the sinless Spotless bride
[1:57:47] of Jesus
[1:57:48] Christ
[1:57:50] our
[1:57:52] refuge thank God for the word thank God
[1:57:56] that our refuge has the word that when
[1:57:59] Satan comes and he starts to accuse
[1:58:01] there's that word to say
