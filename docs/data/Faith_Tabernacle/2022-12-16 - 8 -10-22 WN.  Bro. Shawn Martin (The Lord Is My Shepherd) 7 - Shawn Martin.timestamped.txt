[3:08] Pruitt will be ministering there and so
[3:12] uh going to be good time praise the Lord
[3:16] and also an update on on brother Burley
[3:20] Williams uh they're they're saying that
[3:23] he will be able to keep his vision so we
[3:28] thank the Lord for that
[3:30] um their concern is just the infection
[3:33] getting in the eye and so they've been
[3:36] asking for prayer
[3:38] concerning that and also said it it
[3:41] could affect his color the color his
[3:44] color vision and so we want to just keep
[3:48] him in our prayer
[3:50] that the Lord would just
[3:53] just restore everything to him and and I
[3:58] know the Lord can do it amen
[4:01] we prayed for that uh sister Solis
[4:04] Sunday and
[4:07] um
[4:07] Monday morning got a text that the
[4:12] doctors had
[4:16] um
[4:17] said that she was dying and swelling and
[4:22] was wasn't doing good at all and that uh
[4:28] the machine the breathing machine was
[4:30] doing most of the work
[4:33] and so they just gave real Doom and
[4:37] Gloom bad bad news and
[4:41] um
[4:42] so they requested prayer for that and
[4:47] they said if if that was on Monday and
[4:50] said that if she you know her numbers
[4:53] didn't come up they were going to take
[4:55] her off that and they said it would be
[4:57] over and so yesterday morning got a text
[5:01] that she's actually breathing on her own
[5:05] and
[5:06] so she's you know she's still
[5:10] unconscious or whatever but uh that's a
[5:15] good sign of of just just what we need
[5:18] amen I just know that God's able to
[5:22] restore the the sister and so uh today
[5:27] they said everything is the same and
[5:31] just you know asking for continued
[5:34] prayers for her for her husband the
[5:38] whole family and they've also I heard
[5:42] they've got a GoFundMe
[5:46] page I guess for for him and so I don't
[5:52] even know how we would find that but we
[5:55] can find it for you I could ask around
[5:57] but if any of you want to give on on
[6:01] their behalf I know it would be
[6:04] certainly appreciated
[6:07] in this time amen and you can you can
[6:11] always be you know try to prepare for so
[6:14] much but and then the unexpected happens
[6:17] and we just have to leave it all up to
[6:20] God Amen but the Lord is certainly able
[6:23] to and I believe I believe he's moved
[6:26] and I just believe that and and so we
[6:29] thank the Lord for that
[6:31] amen if we could just bow our heads
[6:35] before we read the word and just just
[6:39] invite the Lord to take this part of the
[6:43] service
[6:44] Lord Jesus
[6:48] no doubt many prayers have been offered
[6:50] for this service tonight
[6:54] Lord your Prophet said we can do a lot
[6:56] of things too much
[6:58] that we can never pray too much
[7:01] and we can't to over ask
[7:04] Lord for you to come
[7:08] Lord as we humble ourselves before you
[7:13] asking that you would forgive us of all
[7:16] of our sins our shortcomings
[7:19] if there's anything that would not be
[7:22] pleasing to you this evening we'd pray
[7:25] that you would just forgive us of it
[7:27] Lord
[7:29] and I pray Lord that you would come in a
[7:32] special way this evening and touch your
[7:34] people
[7:35] father we're a needy people
[7:38] as we see the world and the shape that
[7:40] it's in we recognizing more and more
[7:44] just how much we need you and
[7:47] for other helpers just to Humble
[7:49] ourselves before you now
[7:51] and may you just work among his father
[7:55] for we do believe in the Supernatural
[7:59] and Lord wherever you are the
[8:01] Supernatural is for you are Supernatural
[8:05] oh God you work when no one else can
[8:09] father we just commit that into your
[8:11] hands and on myself and on the people is
[8:16] our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[8:19] it and the church says
[8:22] amen and amen
[8:25] Psalms 23
[8:27] the Lord is my shepherd
[8:30] I shall not want.
[8:33] he maketh me to lie down
[8:36] in Green Pastures
[8:39] amen I won't just stop right there you
[8:41] can have your seats
[8:43] and again the title the Lord is my
[8:46] shepherd
[8:48] and I want to
[8:51] to deal
[8:53] with the second verse
[8:56] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[8:59] Pastures
[9:01] and this is just a simple thought but
[9:05] hopefully it'll be something to help you
[9:08] but we we find that first of all Green
[9:12] Pastures and water
[9:14] because he said he leadeth me beside the
[9:17] Steel Waters
[9:18] the Green Pastures is something that the
[9:21] Sheep can't find on their own
[9:24] it takes the shepherd to lead them to it
[9:28] and uh and so what I would call it today
[9:33] tonight is a secret place
[9:37] it's a secret place that only the
[9:39] shepherd knows
[9:42] it's the secret place that the shepherd
[9:44] knows how to get to
[9:47] and we must follow him to get to it
[9:50] right
[9:52] and so we we find that uh uh we we see
[9:57] in the Bible that the Green Pastures
[10:02] is is the Lord's it's it's his
[10:06] in Jeremiah 23 1 God uses the phrase the
[10:11] Sheep of my pasture
[10:14] this ain't borrowed this is his pasture
[10:19] uh Ezekiel 34 31 and ye my flock
[10:23] the flock of my pasture are men and I am
[10:27] your God saith the Lord God
[10:31] Psalms 95 7 breaking in he is our God
[10:34] and we are the people of his pasture and
[10:38] the Sheep of his hand
[10:40] it goes in again in in Psalms 103 we are
[10:46] his people and the Sheep of his pasture
[10:50] so it's his pasture
[10:53] uh and I like that uh it's it's because
[10:58] that it's his pasture he knows all about
[11:02] it and and uh it's it's a place that he
[11:07] has prepared for us to come to
[11:11] he's leads us there it's it's something
[11:14] that that he's brought us to it's like
[11:17] when when Elijah uh the prophet on Earth
[11:22] and God and
[11:24] um uh in the time of drought God had a
[11:29] place prepared for Elijah to go to
[11:33] and so we are his sheep and the green
[11:37] pasture is for his sheep
[11:40] it isn't for nothing else but his sheep
[11:43] ain't that right so once again David
[11:47] shows a a parallel between the natural
[11:51] and the spiritual
[11:53] as we know he was a Woodsman he was a
[11:56] shepherd and he could see God in nature
[11:59] and and God is clearly seen in nature if
[12:05] we would just take the time get out of
[12:08] the cities and just get out in the woods
[12:10] and and uh you you'll find God in nature
[12:15] just take your time and and look around
[12:18] we can see God ain't that right uh
[12:21] brother Branham said his first Bible was
[12:23] nature so we can see God in the Sun the
[12:27] moon the stars we can see God in the
[12:30] trees we can see God in the blade of
[12:33] grass
[12:34] we can we can see God in the in the
[12:37] flowers we we can see him in the rainbow
[12:41] we we can see God in the eagle even in
[12:46] in the way she steers her nest
[12:49] we we can see God everywhere
[12:53] ain't that right God does it make it
[12:56] difficult for us to see him and to know
[12:59] that he exists and to know that he's
[13:02] all-powerful
[13:04] I I I thought of this scripture Romans 1
[13:07] and 18 it says for the wrath of God is
[13:11] revealed from Heaven against all and
[13:14] godliness and unrighteousness of men
[13:17] who hold the truth
[13:20] in unrighteousness you know what
[13:23] thinking of that those who hold the
[13:25] truth you know there's people that study
[13:27] nature they they study the the grass
[13:30] they study the birds they study they
[13:33] study all of these things they they
[13:35] study the atmospheres and know all about
[13:38] it they're very smart in these things
[13:40] and and and they hold the truth
[13:44] can you say man in unrighteousness but
[13:47] they do hold the truth and because in in
[13:51] the 19th verse because that which may be
[13:55] known of God is Manifest in them for God
[13:58] hath showed it unto them see you you
[14:02] can't study nature you you you can't
[14:04] look at these things and not see God
[14:07] ain't that right and and then the 20th
[14:10] verse Paul would say for the invisible
[14:12] things of him from the creation of the
[14:16] world are clearly seen being understood
[14:19] by the things that are made even his
[14:23] eternal power and godhead so that they
[14:27] are without excuse
[14:29] ain't that right because that when they
[14:33] knew God and you can't you you can't
[14:36] study the the the the botany life or or
[14:40] the sun and the universe without without
[14:43] knowing that there had to be an
[14:46] intelligence behind it
[14:48] ain't that right but when they knew God
[14:51] they glorified him not as God neither
[14:54] were thankful but became vain in their
[14:57] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[15:00] darkened ain't that right amen
[15:04] professing themselves to be wise they
[15:07] became fools so they tried to uh uh uh
[15:12] tell us that these things these things
[15:14] just evolved or or or or
[15:17] whatever and and it's just running
[15:21] Evolution and and and all of these
[15:24] things but but if if that you can see
[15:27] God and so David amen he could see God
[15:31] in nature he could see God in the Sheep
[15:34] he he could see God the way things ran
[15:38] ain't that right so David he's comparing
[15:42] uh uh sees this comparison between God
[15:47] and and uh his people and the sheep and
[15:51] the the shepherd so so he's looking at
[15:54] it and he's comparing and he sees this
[15:57] comparison that just as the shepherd is
[16:00] so is God in a greater higher form and
[16:05] just as the chief ours so is God's
[16:08] people and he began to to get a lesson
[16:11] from these things and brother Brandon
[16:14] many times would be out in the mountains
[16:15] and he would tell us and began to give
[16:17] us lessons of of nature ain't that right
[16:21] a lot of his Inspirations come from
[16:23] nature a lot of the great Revelations
[16:25] that we have on tape uh the seat shall
[16:29] not be aired with the shock what does he
[16:31] do he goes to Nature here and tells us
[16:33] all about it tells us about the eagle
[16:35] and and and the eaglets he tells us even
[16:38] about the chipmunk and and that you know
[16:41] and and all of these things uh he can
[16:44] see God in it all in the plan of God so
[16:47] as a Shepherd takes care of his sheep so
[16:51] does God as a Shepherd leads his sheep
[16:54] so does God as as sheep follow the
[16:57] shepherd a man so does God's people and
[17:02] so if you notice David says he he maketh
[17:05] me to lie down in the Green Pastures and
[17:10] elitists mean beside the Still Waters
[17:13] now a couple things that I'd like to uh
[17:16] uh uh talk about in this verse a man
[17:20] first of all David calls it green
[17:22] pasture a man which gives us a picture
[17:25] of freshness
[17:28] not stale and dried up ain't that right
[17:32] time and it's in the Green Pastures that
[17:36] that it's where your experience with God
[17:41] stays fresh
[17:43] ain't that right he could have just said
[17:45] he making me lie down in pastures but
[17:48] but there's a reason that he would say
[17:50] Green Pastures Shepherd just doesn't
[17:53] lead his sheep anywhere
[17:55] a man but he leads them in Green
[17:57] Pastures and where it's fresh everything
[18:00] about God is fresh do you believe that
[18:04] if if your experience is stale that
[18:08] that's not what God called you to be
[18:11] your experience should be fresh
[18:14] fresh on a daily basis can you say amen
[18:17] that's right in the holies of holies the
[18:20] hidden Manna was put in there a man in
[18:24] that holist of holies and and it would
[18:27] stay fresh for every generation it never
[18:31] got old it never got stale it never got
[18:34] maggoty it stayed fresh all the time
[18:37] ain't that right God also Likens us unto
[18:41] Eagles amen and there's a lot about that
[18:44] eagle that we could we could look to and
[18:47] and see but one thing amen that a Prof
[18:50] the prophet brings out about the eagle
[18:52] is that his food is always fresh
[18:57] ain't that right now the buzzer I mean
[18:59] he'll lead off roadkill he just flies
[19:02] and circles around he doesn't care about
[19:04] the maggots it doesn't care about the
[19:06] Decay and the stink and the rot and the
[19:09] buzzards amen that's just what they feed
[19:11] off but you'll never find an eagle a man
[19:14] uh uh eating something that is old dead
[19:18] rotten maggots and and all that he's got
[19:21] to have fresh Keel hey can you say amen
[19:25] and the prophet would tell us that where
[19:27] the carcass is there will the Eagles be
[19:31] gathered together and the prophet said
[19:34] the carcass is the fresh everybody say
[19:37] fresh it's the fresh Keel of the word
[19:41] the word that's raised up and fattened
[19:45] and been made manifest and give out to
[19:48] the children for food he said now the
[19:51] old carcass that's laid there for
[19:53] hundreds of years there it'll be see
[19:55] that same now Lou Luther had a message
[19:58] of repentance but you bunch of Lutheran
[20:00] buzzards see Baptist had a message but
[20:03] you Baptist buzzards the Pentecost had a
[20:06] message coming home now Pentecostal
[20:08] buzzards but where the carcass is that
[20:11] fresh meat there will the Eagles be
[20:15] gathered ain't that right he said
[20:18] remember you couldn't feed a Lutheran
[20:20] back in them days uh you can now but you
[20:23] couldn't feed them Catholic carry-on no
[20:26] sir he had fresh meat and that was that
[20:29] church age ain't that right you couldn't
[20:31] feed Methodist Lutheran message oh no he
[20:35] didn't want that carry-on see it's
[20:37] rotten see the life had done left it and
[20:42] went on into something else that's the
[20:45] old stock that's dead back there the
[20:47] life everybody say the life is moving on
[20:51] the life is moving on neither can you
[20:54] feed the Bride of Jesus Christ
[20:56] Pentecostalism them no indeedy maggot
[21:00] blowed uh uh organizations we don't want
[21:03] nothing to do with it
[21:05] can you say Amen nothing to do with it
[21:08] so here we find that that God leads his
[21:12] sheep in Green Pastures
[21:15] amen what does your green mean it shows
[21:18] that there's life there
[21:21] life is abundance
[21:23] can you say Amen it's a place where life
[21:27] is is is is is is is there and
[21:30] everything is fresh everything is green
[21:33] another thing about the Green Pastures
[21:36] is the rightful position of the believer
[21:42] ain't that right this isn't just a
[21:45] one-time luxury that we have in our
[21:48] experience with God that it's the right
[21:51] position of every child of God
[21:56] amen it's the place where we belong in
[22:00] Green Pastures and besides Still Waters
[22:04] ain't that right David tells of the time
[22:07] that that the bear uh uh come in and and
[22:10] took one of his sheep ain't that right
[22:13] and then he tells of another time when a
[22:16] lion which was a greater power than that
[22:20] of the bear came in and and took the
[22:24] Sheep amen from the fall amen and the
[22:27] prophet said he lets us know where the
[22:29] Sheep was taken from he said the Sheep
[22:32] were taken from Green Pastures
[22:35] ain't that right the Sheep was taken
[22:38] from Green Pastures why that's where
[22:41] they belonged
[22:42] amen but the prophet said David was a
[22:45] Deliverance minister
[22:48] David was a Deliverance minister
[22:52] he wasn't going to just let that power
[22:54] take that sheep away
[22:57] that he would go in the name of the of
[23:00] God he would go in the power of the Lord
[23:03] ain't that right amen see amen and and
[23:07] bring him back Amen to the place where
[23:11] that sheep belongs he didn't belong in
[23:14] the mouth of the lion he didn't belong
[23:16] in the mouth of the bear he belonged in
[23:18] Green Pastures
[23:21] can you say Amen
[23:23] and he didn't lead his sheep and Green
[23:25] Pastures without a purpose ain't that
[23:28] right as I've said before the shepherd
[23:31] doesn't care for a sheep based upon his
[23:34] own needs
[23:35] amen that's right see but he cares for
[23:38] them by supplying their needs
[23:42] so the Green Pastures isn't for Our
[23:45] Shepherd the green pastors was provided
[23:48] to supply your need
[23:50] do you believe that
[23:52] oh it's I just been looking at it it's
[23:55] it's just been interesting for me of
[23:58] what these green pastors and what David
[24:00] is really saying amen about it see so
[24:05] that the green pasture has what the
[24:08] Sheep needs and David went in the power
[24:11] of the Lord and rescued that sheep and
[24:14] put it back in its right place
[24:17] amen as the prophet would say he
[24:19] overcame both powers
[24:21] and you say man both Powers were as it
[24:25] was an enemy to the Sheep
[24:28] ain't that right
[24:30] amen just like we have today we've got
[24:32] Supernatural powers
[24:34] that are out to destroy us
[24:37] to take the sheep from the fold
[24:39] that I think God that there's
[24:41] Deliverance ministers
[24:44] that ain't just interested in preaching
[24:46] a psychology message
[24:48] that ain't just interested in learning
[24:50] about God that they understand the
[24:53] purpose of God and they've been anointed
[24:55] there are parents that are parents that
[24:59] are a Deliverance parents
[25:01] can you say Amen they ain't gonna just
[25:04] let their children go out in the world
[25:05] and meet the uh uh destroyed by the
[25:09] evils of Darkness
[25:12] hello
[25:14] they're going to still hang on to them
[25:15] children
[25:16] they're still going to believe for them
[25:18] children they're going to still apply
[25:20] the token to them children
[25:24] yes sir too many parents are just giving
[25:27] their children up without a fight
[25:32] hello
[25:34] well it's true
[25:36] giving up their children without a fight
[25:38] I'd rather fight for my children I'd
[25:40] rather fight for my family amen you say
[25:43] well how in the world is that amen well
[25:46] I know the devil is trying to get them I
[25:48] know the devil is trying to destroy can
[25:50] you say man and you ought to be aware of
[25:52] that too many of us know that amen and
[25:56] it's easy just to give up and take the
[25:58] take the the easy road instead of
[26:01] praying instead of standing there A lot
[26:03] of times you know why the devil fights
[26:05] you so hard is you're standing between
[26:07] life and death for your very children
[26:13] is true
[26:14] but David was willing to overcome them
[26:18] powers for the Sheep's sake
[26:20] and bring him back
[26:23] ain't that right
[26:24] now notice the Holy Ghost wants to come
[26:27] and bless the people and lead them into
[26:29] deep Rivers and the Green Pastures and
[26:32] things but notice the organization won't
[26:36] let them do it
[26:37] holds them back
[26:39] so you see one of them powers
[26:42] is an organizational power
[26:45] amen the Holy Ghost wants to come and
[26:48] bless you Bless the people and lead them
[26:51] in to the Green Pastures and deep Rivers
[26:54] but the organization won't let them do
[26:56] it it holds them back
[26:58] amen a lot of people don't understand
[27:00] the enemy
[27:02] they don't understand what's going on
[27:05] hello
[27:06] it's true amen they they look at
[27:09] churches all around all God bless their
[27:11] heart they're doing a good job amen and
[27:13] not realizing it's an enemy
[27:17] that's holding many people
[27:21] from the Green Pastures
[27:24] brother Randall said he was delivered
[27:26] from the Baptist mouth
[27:30] I was delivered from a Pentecostal mouth
[27:34] a lot of us was delivered from the mouth
[27:36] of an organization
[27:38] can you say Amen that ain't no pretty
[27:41] thing that ain't a righteous thing amen
[27:45] them churches with their Steeples there
[27:46] ain't nothing righteous about it
[27:48] they're full of poison that keeps God's
[27:51] sheep from coming out into Green
[27:54] Pastures
[27:55] [Music]
[27:57] brother Branham and speaking of the True
[27:59] Vine and false Vine in the sixth uh in
[28:03] this uh in in the sixth Church age
[28:06] said the the True Vine flourished he's
[28:10] talking about the sixth stage the True
[28:12] Vine flourished in this age as in no
[28:15] other when one thinks of numbers at home
[28:18] and abroad this age brought holy men to
[28:22] the Forefront
[28:24] the True Vine spread and the false Vine
[28:26] receded everywhere the True Vine went
[28:29] God gave light and life and happiness
[28:32] the false Vine was shown up for what it
[28:36] was Darkness misery poverty illiteracy
[28:40] and death
[28:42] and as the full spine in its day of
[28:44] power could not kill the the True Vine
[28:47] now you know that this false Vine is
[28:49] religious just as religious it's the
[28:52] spirit of antichrist
[28:54] ain't that right neither could so so the
[28:57] the false find in its day of power could
[28:59] not kill the True Vine and neither could
[29:01] the True Vine now bring back the false
[29:04] Vine to Jesus Christ
[29:06] but the false Vine entrenched itself
[29:09] notice the false Vine entrenched itself
[29:13] waiting for the last part of the last
[29:17] age when it would win all back to itself
[29:25] can you say Amen
[29:27] it'll win all back to itself except that
[29:31] small flock
[29:33] that were the elect True Vine of God
[29:37] can you say man
[29:38] now notice but how sad does this age
[29:41] make us feel as we realize that every
[29:44] great move of God and there were many
[29:47] neglected to throw off the nicolaitan
[29:49] doctrine for the all organized and died
[29:53] then they moved into denominations to
[29:57] hold the spiritually dead in foodless
[30:01] pastures
[30:05] what does this organization's doing
[30:07] holding spiritually dead in foodless
[30:12] pastures
[30:16] they've got their theological sermons
[30:20] but there's no food
[30:24] they're doctors of divinity but it's
[30:28] foodless pastors
[30:29] [Music]
[30:31] hello
[30:33] they're not holding the people in Green
[30:35] Pastures
[30:37] it's foodless pastures
[30:40] and and they're dead spiritually dead
[30:43] the prophet said
[30:47] think of it holding
[30:50] the spiritually dead
[30:52] in Green Pastures
[30:55] or in foodless pastures
[30:59] so that false Vine
[31:01] would love nothing more than to take you
[31:04] away from the Green Pastures
[31:07] they put their own interpretation to it
[31:09] which is fine if that's what they want
[31:11] to do but the problem is they try to
[31:13] make us to believe it as the prophet
[31:15] says
[31:16] it's the enemy that keeps you
[31:20] from Green Pastures
[31:24] you with me
[31:26] now remember there wasn't just one power
[31:29] that David had to deal with
[31:31] there was another Power
[31:34] that he had to overcome
[31:36] ain't that right now if you study it
[31:38] brother Branham talks about the demon
[31:40] power of cancer
[31:42] we're arthritis or whatever the sickness
[31:45] is that is there to take away God's
[31:48] sheep from the Green Pastures
[31:53] amen can you say man often you'll hear
[31:56] Brother Branham say I'm coming with this
[31:58] slingshot of faith
[32:00] to bring God's sheep back
[32:02] to the Green Pastures
[32:04] can you say man
[32:06] amen say so the power wants to destroy
[32:09] you physically and he wants to destroy
[32:12] you spiritually
[32:16] that's right
[32:17] because the Green Pastures is where you
[32:19] belong
[32:21] in Christ
[32:22] Christ is Where We Belong
[32:26] enjoying the blessings
[32:28] and benefits
[32:30] ain't that right
[32:32] now it's in the Green Pastures
[32:35] that the sheep can eat
[32:39] brother Brandon would say sheep food is
[32:41] the word of God
[32:43] Islam's feed
[32:45] in this Shady Green pasture
[32:48] and he also said it's a place where we
[32:51] can eat all our hearts desire
[32:56] aren't you glad for that
[32:58] people say oh don't don't don't get too
[33:00] much in this message don't get to
[33:01] studying too much you'll go wacky
[33:04] wacko
[33:05] you just go loony now you know I I've
[33:08] seen people that way
[33:10] they they get they they just get off the
[33:12] wall in their doctrines
[33:14] and you know when I first come into the
[33:16] messes that's what I was introduced to
[33:17] was them type of people so I was always
[33:20] afraid to to really get into the into
[33:22] the message because you know if it made
[33:25] them wacky then then what about me but
[33:28] then I heard brother Brown say but if
[33:29] you really desire more of God God is
[33:32] obligated to give it to you then I
[33:35] realized that there's two types of
[33:37] people that are hungry there's one that
[33:40] are hungering and they're feeding
[33:41] intellectually
[33:43] and then there's another that's
[33:45] hungering from the soul
[33:48] and they're being fed by revelation
[33:52] ain't that right now you've got to eat
[33:55] you must eat
[33:57] it's important
[33:59] God wouldn't have led you to the Green
[34:01] Pastures if he didn't want you to eat
[34:05] but that's where your diet is
[34:07] can you say man people will do most
[34:10] anything to get something to eat hunger
[34:14] turns people into beggars
[34:17] hunger will turn people into thieves
[34:21] ain't that right
[34:22] it'll cause people to do whatever crazy
[34:25] things
[34:27] because they're hungry
[34:29] you know brother Graham said people when
[34:31] they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere
[34:34] if children and people are starving
[34:36] they'll eat from a garbage can
[34:39] that once ate from a nice table
[34:42] but if they're really hungry they'll eat
[34:45] anywhere
[34:48] but God doesn't want you eating just
[34:50] anywhere
[34:55] God doesn't want his sheep just eating
[34:57] anywhere
[35:01] hello
[35:04] why is it that food is so essential
[35:09] because food gives sustaining strength
[35:14] ain't that right and the word sustain
[35:16] means to give support to
[35:18] to supply to nourish
[35:22] it it it helps you grow
[35:25] it sustains life
[35:28] ain't that right
[35:30] now we know the the prophet says it and
[35:34] I'm sure we we with no in the natural
[35:36] that any good shepherd ain't going to
[35:39] feed his sheep something that's going to
[35:40] kill it
[35:43] that goes back up on the shepherd
[35:46] ain't that right
[35:48] that's right
[35:49] just to think God would save you
[35:53] deliver you from the world
[35:56] only to see you go right back
[35:59] only to see you riding the offense
[36:03] and your teeth are tottering
[36:07] that ain't a shepherd
[36:10] the shepherd's going to give you the
[36:11] right nourishment
[36:13] he's going to give you the right food to
[36:16] sustain you
[36:18] that's why I said he that endured to the
[36:20] end shall the same shall be saved it's
[36:23] not he that starts it it's he that
[36:25] finishes
[36:26] can you say Amen anybody can start
[36:29] anybody could say I love the Lord
[36:30] anybody can come to the altar anybody
[36:33] can start with church
[36:35] that it's he that endureth to the end
[36:38] well if you're going to endure to the
[36:40] end you say well I got the Holy Ghost
[36:42] the Holy Ghost has to eat
[36:46] come on fruit
[36:48] that's what the prophet said the Holy
[36:51] Ghost feeds off the word
[36:54] ain't that right
[36:56] the life in you craves to eat
[36:59] and so does the spiritual life within
[37:02] you
[37:03] so God leads us to Green Pastures
[37:06] so that our strength is sustained
[37:11] our faith is made strong
[37:15] not weak it gets stronger
[37:19] our love
[37:21] is made stronger
[37:23] our patience is made stronger
[37:27] our endurance is made stronger than you
[37:32] say Amen all of these things is made
[37:36] stronger you become a stronger Christian
[37:39] because you have food to sustain you
[37:46] Matthew 4 4
[37:48] says it is written man shall not live by
[37:51] bread alone but by every word that
[37:54] proceedeth thou the mouth of God
[37:57] so we live by the word of God ain't that
[37:59] right
[38:00] well we can look at the word Well
[38:02] everybody's got a Bible That's the word
[38:03] and every preacher's preaching behind
[38:06] the pulpits that's the word surely
[38:07] that's got to be the word
[38:09] but notice the word
[38:11] that we are to feed off is the word
[38:13] that's been Vindicated
[38:15] everybody say Vindicated
[38:18] and that word that we are to eat has to
[38:21] have the correct interpretation to it
[38:25] now the prophet would tell us thank God
[38:27] for a prophet he says we do have today
[38:30] by God's help
[38:32] the perfect interpretation of the word
[38:36] with Divine vindication
[38:43] so there is a green pasture
[38:51] when there's foodless pastures
[38:53] everywhere
[38:54] and spiritually dead people everywhere
[38:58] there is Supply to us a green pasture
[39:04] fresh
[39:09] see this green pasture is full
[39:11] of sheep food
[39:14] the brother Brown says there's no
[39:16] ecclesiastical weeds in it
[39:21] now what a contrast when compared to
[39:23] denominations
[39:26] the prophet said they have vast numbers
[39:28] that keep coming to revivals
[39:31] and answer their altar calls but most of
[39:33] them are emotional in their approach or
[39:36] desirous
[39:37] of something physical
[39:39] rather than Desiring that which is truly
[39:43] spiritual
[39:46] and he likened this day to the day that
[39:49] Noah entered into the ark and the door
[39:52] was shut
[39:54] and he says throughout those seven days
[39:57] God tarried in sending his judgment upon
[40:00] the Earth yet no one was literally
[40:04] turned to God in those silent days
[40:10] think of it
[40:13] these denominations
[40:15] foolish pastures
[40:18] they ain't got nothing there to bring
[40:20] the people to an experience with God
[40:24] they got their science
[40:27] they got their intellect
[40:29] intellectual speeches now they're
[40:31] pushing for psychology
[40:34] which that's already been now they're
[40:36] just trying to push it in the message
[40:39] as if though we need something else
[40:42] besides a good old prophet
[40:45] can you say man
[40:46] as if the perfect interpretation of the
[40:50] word with Divine Vindication isn't
[40:52] enough
[40:55] hello
[40:57] and no one was literally turned to God
[41:00] in those silent days see they're in
[41:03] fruitless pastures
[41:07] nothing to convict them nothing to turn
[41:10] them nothing to make them aware of God
[41:15] nothing in them to to make them aware of
[41:18] the supernatural
[41:21] most people today don't even know if
[41:23] there's a heaven
[41:26] don't even know if there's a hell
[41:29] it's becoming more common that if you
[41:32] die you just die
[41:36] foodless pastors
[41:39] brother Brown said it's not the missiles
[41:41] with the shiny tips on them or whatever
[41:43] he called them
[41:45] that we need to worry about it's the
[41:46] churches
[41:49] that's what he said I heard him today
[41:50] spiritual food and due season I believe
[41:52] it was
[41:54] it's the churches you need to worry
[41:55] about you need to be warned of it
[41:58] can you say man
[42:00] now notice
[42:02] this means
[42:05] brother Branham uh uh uh uh comparing
[42:09] this day to Noah's day it means that
[42:12] judgment is fixing to strike
[42:16] foodless pastors judgment is fixing to
[42:19] strike
[42:20] I hope that's all right
[42:23] remember Elijah
[42:25] he was sent to a nation that had turned
[42:28] away from God from the word of God Ahab
[42:31] was king at the time
[42:33] he was a
[42:35] lukewarm
[42:38] very religious
[42:40] and did you know even though he was very
[42:43] religious he was the worst king of them
[42:46] all
[42:48] Prophet said he was the most evil King
[42:51] now if you go look up up these there
[42:54] there was a lot of wicked evil Kings
[42:57] before Ahab
[43:00] and the prophet says he was the worst of
[43:02] them
[43:03] yet religious
[43:07] again you say Amen
[43:09] why
[43:10] he was a real modernist the prophet said
[43:16] he believed in religion certainly and he
[43:18] had everything in a Modern Trend
[43:21] he had his 400 Hebrew prophets all of
[43:24] them well schooled and trained God sent
[43:27] him one and he wouldn't believe it
[43:30] ain't that right and that was Elijah
[43:33] he said you can imagine on a modern
[43:35] people like that what a real true
[43:37] servant of God would sound like to them
[43:42] you you now listen to this now
[43:45] how strange you would think if someone
[43:47] was giving you food you would be so
[43:51] anxious to get that food
[43:53] that in the spiritual sense people have
[43:56] been sitting in fruitless pastures
[43:59] so long spiritually dead so long
[44:04] they're not used in their sense of faith
[44:08] hello
[44:09] as I said a while back the prophet said
[44:12] if if I shut my eyes and and and and put
[44:15] a blindfold over them refuse to see
[44:18] light then my boy grow up and I put as a
[44:22] boy put a a a blind his eyes with a with
[44:25] the bandage to where he couldn't see and
[44:27] then he would do his boy and his boy he
[44:30] said we'd raise up a whole generation of
[44:31] blind people
[44:34] foodless pastures
[44:37] spiritually dead people
[44:41] and they think that's why religion is
[44:44] they think that's the way to experience
[44:46] God
[44:47] no wonder they get more it's and uh uh
[44:51] uh Thrills at a ball game
[44:54] no wonder they get more peace and more
[44:57] uh fulfillment in sports
[45:00] no wonder they get more uh uh
[45:04] fulfillment on the job than in the money
[45:06] and in materialistic things
[45:11] religious
[45:12] but foodless pastors
[45:16] in a place that the spiritual cannot be
[45:20] contained or sustained
[45:23] hello
[45:25] oh there's plenty to keep your carnal
[45:27] mind sustained
[45:30] keep that carnal nature alive
[45:33] but we're talking about a Green Pastures
[45:36] to keep your spiritual Soul alive
[45:42] you understand
[45:43] so he said you can imagine a modern
[45:46] people like that what a Trill uh real
[45:49] true servant of God would sound like to
[45:51] them
[45:52] a man that could bring food to the
[45:55] people and the people look at it and say
[45:58] no no no no no no
[46:00] that's not the devil
[46:05] why he was crazy out of his mind there
[46:08] couldn't be such a thing
[46:11] oh goodness
[46:13] they were very very religious they had
[46:17] sincere men they had since their people
[46:20] they was very religious
[46:25] now the prophet would tell us that when
[46:28] he sent Elijah he's looking at this
[46:30] nation very modern
[46:34] in the world laodicea
[46:38] more so
[46:41] yes just lukewarm
[46:45] and God looking down at that Nation
[46:48] the prophet said God knew
[46:51] it would take more than just an ordinary
[46:54] man
[46:57] to come in that age
[46:59] he knew it would take more than just
[47:03] ordinary theology or an ordinary message
[47:07] he knew that it would take more than
[47:10] just an ordinary preacher
[47:16] it would take more than just preaching
[47:18] the word to crack their Stony hearts
[47:23] now I know people say well you know you
[47:26] you guys are getting too deep in the
[47:27] message and you're this and you're that
[47:29] just stay simple
[47:30] you know what deal Moody was simple
[47:34] and yet he couldn't crack that he could
[47:35] not crack their Stony hearts
[47:39] now we had good men in the day we had
[47:42] our Billy Sundays right
[47:44] any any he he he had a great ministry we
[47:48] had our D.L Moody's that was a great
[47:50] ministry we we had our Jack coats we we
[47:54] had a lot of ministry down Through the
[47:57] Ages and we even had real intellectual
[48:00] commentaries
[48:02] uh uh aw pink is one of them
[48:07] that that that could just expound upon
[48:09] the word but God knew it would take more
[48:13] than that
[48:17] can you say Amen
[48:22] it'll it it's got to take more
[48:26] and I don't want to just just mention
[48:28] names but we we've got our big
[48:30] evangelist television evangelist today
[48:33] it ain't enough Church
[48:37] good gifts
[48:38] great men that can really really preach
[48:42] that what they're bringing to the people
[48:44] are foodless pastors
[48:46] it's not enough
[48:51] amen
[48:53] so God knew for that Nation it would
[48:56] take more than just preaching the word
[48:58] but it would take the prophet said thus
[49:00] saith the Lord
[49:03] now notice now
[49:04] God's God was tired of that that that
[49:07] Nation he was tired of where Ahab was he
[49:10] was tired of the way he Afflicted the
[49:12] people he was tired of the way he led
[49:15] that Nation
[49:16] God was angry
[49:20] right
[49:21] now he's going to send judgment
[49:24] but he couldn't sin judgment by just
[49:26] some little preacher with some little
[49:28] theology
[49:29] he had to send somebody with the saith
[49:32] the Lord
[49:34] hello
[49:36] in order to be able to send judgment
[49:38] down upon the people
[49:40] are you with me
[49:42] so Elijah went out with the Sith Lord
[49:46] why he was a prophet
[49:49] he was more than just a preacher
[49:51] he was more than just a theologian
[49:54] I know these theologians could do
[49:56] circles around brother random
[49:59] in many ways in the way they talked and
[50:02] the way they stood in the way they
[50:03] handled themselves
[50:06] but God knew it would take more than
[50:08] that
[50:12] and you say man
[50:15] notice
[50:17] he had to send a prophet with thus saith
[50:20] the Lord and then the prophet says and
[50:23] despairing that was judgment
[50:29] to spurned that
[50:31] was judgment
[50:34] now in this day
[50:37] God has sent to us amen
[50:41] who was more than just an ordinary
[50:43] preacher
[50:44] so you cannot judge him by the way he
[50:46] preached
[50:48] and by the way he said pulpit and pulpit
[50:51] you you cannot judge him
[50:54] based upon all these doctors of divinity
[50:57] that were real preachers
[50:59] God didn't send us a real preacher in
[51:02] that way
[51:03] he sent us a prophet that hath thus
[51:07] saith the Lord
[51:12] and the spurned that
[51:16] is judgment
[51:20] so we find that God would send to us
[51:22] more than just an ordinary preacher with
[51:24] an ordinary message
[51:26] he sent to us Malachi 4.
[51:31] only one time for this age that God
[51:35] promised to send a prophet
[51:40] I guess only one time did he promise to
[51:43] send the Gentile dispensation a prophet
[51:50] and it so happened
[51:52] that he comes in our day
[51:56] aren't you glad for that
[51:59] man I'm so glad for that
[52:03] what if he would have come in Martin
[52:04] Luther's day
[52:06] we can't even hear Martin Luther
[52:09] we have to read sermons or books about
[52:11] him
[52:13] but in this day
[52:15] he come when when when there was tapes
[52:18] made
[52:20] he come when even though I didn't get to
[52:23] shake his hand I didn't get to be in the
[52:24] meeting I didn't get to see him
[52:26] he come
[52:28] when I could still hear the voice
[52:31] let's saith the Lord
[52:34] we're blessed
[52:38] and he had more than just an ordinary
[52:40] message
[52:42] I'm talking about Green Pastures now
[52:45] he had more than just an ordinary
[52:47] message
[52:49] yeah it does saith the Lord
[52:51] can you say man
[52:53] and in order for God to judge the sins
[52:55] of this nation
[52:57] he had to send a man with thus said the
[52:59] Lord
[53:01] he he was misunderstood and he still is
[53:04] misunderstood
[53:05] he was despised that he still is
[53:08] despised
[53:10] ain't that right
[53:12] but to reject that message is to spurn
[53:15] judgment
[53:19] or it's to bring on judgment
[53:22] brother Branham says he come with us
[53:24] saith the Lord there's nothing left but
[53:28] judgment when you step over the line of
[53:31] Mercy
[53:32] now I'm just going to say this do you
[53:34] realize these Green Pastures that God
[53:37] leads us in is the line of Mercy
[53:40] it's Mercy to you God coming to us is
[53:44] his grace to us
[53:47] track God said in the prophet is Grace
[53:55] ain't that right
[53:57] now God's in judgment to that Nation
[54:01] what was it it was a drought
[54:04] for three and a half years
[54:08] the dude didn't even fall on the ground
[54:11] as Elijah would say not even do we'll
[54:13] fall on the ground except at my word
[54:16] so God sent that Nation through a
[54:18] natural drought
[54:21] we are fully well aware
[54:29] that we're in a drought today
[54:33] I think we can all agree right
[54:36] we're all agree in in agreement that we
[54:39] are in a drought and it's a spiritual
[54:41] drought
[54:42] now listen to me close
[54:47] I hope that I can really get you to
[54:50] understand what these green pasture is
[54:52] to us
[54:54] we are in a spiritual drought the world
[54:57] yes churches are the nation is
[55:00] everything
[55:02] people are trying to find the answers
[55:04] and they can't
[55:07] can you say man
[55:09] now notice Amos 8 and 11 behold the days
[55:13] come saith the Lord God now you you got
[55:16] to know
[55:17] that this scripture has been laying here
[55:19] for years and years and years
[55:24] and had to wait until a prophet would
[55:26] come with thus saith the Lord
[55:31] right
[55:33] now we've had that prophet
[55:37] now this scripture is fulfilled being
[55:39] fulfilled
[55:40] behold the days come saith the Lord God
[55:43] not come they're here
[55:46] right
[55:47] we're not looking for it to come we're
[55:50] saying it's right now
[55:53] that I will send a famine in the land
[55:55] not a famine of bread nor a thirst for
[55:57] water but of hearing the words of the
[56:02] Lord
[56:04] they shall Wander from sea to Sea from
[56:07] the north even to the east they shall
[56:09] run to and fro to seek the word of the
[56:12] Lord and shall not find it
[56:17] why it's a judgment of God upon the
[56:21] people
[56:25] but it took thus saith the Lord to come
[56:29] to sound out before God could send a
[56:32] judgment
[56:36] now notice
[56:39] I won't keep you much longer
[56:42] but the prophet said sin and unbelief by
[56:45] false teachers and modest modernist in
[56:48] the church had brought the place to this
[56:51] coming oncoming judgment
[56:54] what did it again sin
[56:57] and unbelief
[56:58] by what
[57:00] false teachers
[57:02] and modernists in the church
[57:06] had brought the place to this oncoming
[57:10] judgment
[57:12] then they had turned from God's word and
[57:15] his Prophet to a modern theological term
[57:18] of the word
[57:21] ain't that right
[57:24] and when they done that
[57:26] they bring a famine in the church
[57:30] they bring a famine to this world
[57:37] I think
[57:39] Joel
[57:42] 116 through 20 is applicable for this
[57:45] day and age
[57:48] I'm just going to read it and and you
[57:50] take from whatever you want out of it
[57:52] but it says it's not the meat cut off
[57:54] before our eyes
[57:56] yea joy and gladness from the house of
[57:59] our God
[58:01] the seed is rotten under their clods
[58:04] the Garners are laid desolate
[58:08] the barns are broken down for the corn
[58:11] is withered
[58:13] how do the beasts groan
[58:15] the herds of cattle are perplexed
[58:18] because they have no pasture
[58:21] yea the slots of sheep are made desolate
[58:26] O Lord to thee will I cry for the fire
[58:29] hath devoured the pastures of the of the
[58:33] wilderness
[58:34] the flame hath burned all the trees of
[58:38] the field
[58:39] sounds like a drought
[58:42] um
[58:43] and the Beast of the field cry also unto
[58:46] thee for the rivers of waters are dried
[58:48] up
[58:49] and the fire hath devired the pastures
[58:52] of the wilderness
[58:56] now I believe spiritually speaking this
[58:58] would be a pliable to us
[59:01] yet in this day
[59:05] hello
[59:07] the people are crying out for it
[59:10] and they don't know where to find it
[59:16] I want you to know just how blessed you
[59:17] are to have a shepherd
[59:21] the great Shepherd the Lord your
[59:22] Shepherd
[59:25] how blessed you are to be able to have
[59:27] that nature that sheep like nature
[59:31] that would be willing to be led
[59:35] and to follow his voice
[59:38] can you say man
[59:40] now I believe that that scripture
[59:42] portrays the condition that the nominal
[59:44] church is in
[59:46] the church is dried up
[59:50] spiritually speaking
[59:53] he's got the Baptist dried up
[59:56] the Pentecostals are dried up
[59:59] right
[1:00:03] Presbyterians are dried up
[1:00:09] you go as we come to town from our house
[1:00:12] there's a sign that says at a church
[1:00:15] says don't condemn or don't condone what
[1:00:18] God has condemned
[1:00:20] now that that's a nice saying
[1:00:24] but I told my wife
[1:00:27] I don't mean to sound mean but there
[1:00:29] ain't nothing about them people
[1:00:31] there ain't nothing about that church
[1:00:33] that God condones
[1:00:36] everything that they do God condemns
[1:00:38] they hold the doctrines that God
[1:00:40] condemns they hold to a lifestyle that
[1:00:43] God condemns they hold the things that
[1:00:45] God condemns amen whether they're
[1:00:47] bobbing their hair they're wearing their
[1:00:49] pants
[1:00:50] women are leading the homes instead of
[1:00:52] the men
[1:00:53] holding on to trinitarian baptisms
[1:00:58] reject the spirit of God in the church
[1:01:02] substituted for programs
[1:01:05] can you imagine being in a place where
[1:01:08] God just literally condemns everything
[1:01:10] you do
[1:01:12] that'd be scary wouldn't it
[1:01:15] that'd just be scary
[1:01:18] but there's people all over
[1:01:20] in that shape
[1:01:22] foreign
[1:01:24] not trying to be mean but face it folks
[1:01:28] he's got him out there and you know what
[1:01:30] he's trying to get us
[1:01:35] that's why Wars against this church so
[1:01:37] bad that's why it goes Wars against the
[1:01:39] message so bad
[1:01:43] can you say Amen the church is dried up
[1:01:46] spiritually speaking no power why they
[1:01:51] once had it
[1:01:53] all right but they were in foodless
[1:01:56] pastors
[1:01:58] nothing to sustain it
[1:02:01] no faith anymore to just to believe God
[1:02:07] you know what the prophet said
[1:02:10] prophets are pointing to people to
[1:02:12] doctors more than they are goddess
[1:02:14] especially to psychologists
[1:02:17] churches
[1:02:19] why they've been in foodless pastors so
[1:02:22] long
[1:02:23] that no matter what Revival God gave
[1:02:25] them it wouldn't sustain
[1:02:27] it wouldn't hold
[1:02:31] hello
[1:02:32] no love brother Brown said there would
[1:02:35] be a time that only love will be found
[1:02:37] in the elect
[1:02:39] why great pastures
[1:02:45] no Supernatural no presence of God
[1:02:47] without understanding the revivals that
[1:02:50] they once had is gone because they
[1:02:53] haven't had anything to sustain them
[1:02:59] foreign
[1:03:05] people can start off on fire for God and
[1:03:07] give them 10 20 years
[1:03:09] and they're starting letting things back
[1:03:11] into their home
[1:03:12] start okaying things that they used to
[1:03:14] not okay
[1:03:15] start allowing things to where they're
[1:03:17] so decrepit anymore it's just church is
[1:03:20] just it's just a form they go through
[1:03:23] their song service they go through the
[1:03:24] preaching and the preachings too long
[1:03:26] songs are too long they gripe about this
[1:03:28] they gripe about that they gripe about
[1:03:30] that why there was nothing to sustain
[1:03:33] the experience
[1:03:38] hello
[1:03:40] but notice God had already
[1:03:43] had a place provided for Elijah
[1:03:46] before judgment set in
[1:03:48] and this place was provided to take care
[1:03:51] of Elijah's needs to sustain him and
[1:03:55] brother Bradham said that Elijah in in
[1:03:58] the spiritual food in due season
[1:04:00] he said that Elijah represents the
[1:04:03] Church of today
[1:04:06] the real Church of today
[1:04:09] Elijah he says was cared for in the
[1:04:11] natural his natural food because it
[1:04:14] wasn't going to rain now
[1:04:16] see God knew that the Judgment was going
[1:04:18] to come is this okay
[1:04:20] God knew that the Judgment was going to
[1:04:23] come but he had already had a place
[1:04:26] prepared for Elijah aren't you glad for
[1:04:30] that
[1:04:31] that Elijah wasn't going to be part of
[1:04:33] the drought
[1:04:37] so it wasn't going to rain see but
[1:04:39] according to the word of the Gods see
[1:04:41] now during the time that he was going to
[1:04:45] punish the unbeliever he made way for
[1:04:49] the believer
[1:04:50] the same thing he does each time in the
[1:04:53] days when he was going to destroy the
[1:04:55] world by water he made a way of Escape
[1:04:57] for Noah in the days that he was going
[1:04:59] to drown Egypt he made a way of Escape
[1:05:02] across the sea for his people how God
[1:05:05] makes his way and where there is no way
[1:05:08] he is that way then he repeats it he is
[1:05:13] that way
[1:05:15] ain't that right so now we're realizing
[1:05:18] that we're facing one of the greatest
[1:05:19] hours that history has ever known and it
[1:05:22] isn't exactly the Warhead with the
[1:05:24] bright shiny missile with the head on it
[1:05:26] that we should be afraid of it's the
[1:05:27] churches we should be afraid of it's the
[1:05:30] hour that we're living that we should
[1:05:33] watch now notice but God everybody say
[1:05:36] but God made a way for Elijah to escape
[1:05:41] it and he has made a way for his
[1:05:44] believing children to escape it now to
[1:05:47] escape the wrath and things that are to
[1:05:50] come
[1:05:51] aren't you glad for it
[1:05:54] I thank God for the Green Pastures
[1:05:57] Hallelujah
[1:05:59] and if you notice
[1:06:02] that place that God had led Elijah to
[1:06:06] was a secret place
[1:06:09] and if you notice that place that we've
[1:06:11] been
[1:06:12] led to the Green Pastures
[1:06:15] it's a secret place
[1:06:18] our food the prophet called it is hidden
[1:06:21] food
[1:06:22] ain't that right
[1:06:24] see they shall run to and fro
[1:06:28] running everywhere to try to find the
[1:06:30] word of the Lord and they shall not find
[1:06:32] it it's hidden to them
[1:06:35] it's a hidden place that holds hidden
[1:06:39] food
[1:06:40] for the Sheep of God
[1:06:43] ain't that right
[1:06:44] oh do you love him
[1:06:46] see we're in that secret place you don't
[1:06:49] see the supernatural experience
[1:06:52] do you realize that you have with God as
[1:06:54] a hidden experience
[1:07:00] that a lot of people that go to church
[1:07:02] know nothing about it
[1:07:04] that it's a hidden experience with you
[1:07:06] and God
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:09] can you say Amen yes it's a it's a
[1:07:11] public display for the token has to be
[1:07:13] publicly displayed but they don't know
[1:07:15] how to get it
[1:07:17] ain't that right
[1:07:20] now notice though listen Deuteronomy 29
[1:07:24] 29
[1:07:25] and I'll try not to hold you much longer
[1:07:28] the secret things belong to the Lord
[1:07:33] who is Our Shepherd
[1:07:36] ain't that right
[1:07:38] you don't have to ask for anything
[1:07:41] he don't ask for directions
[1:07:44] for the secret things belong to him
[1:07:48] but those things which are revealed
[1:07:52] what
[1:07:53] belong to us
[1:07:57] and who else
[1:07:58] our children oh
[1:08:02] they belong to us
[1:08:04] and our children
[1:08:05] forever
[1:08:07] isn't that awesome
[1:08:10] and those things which are revealed
[1:08:14] now notice
[1:08:17] the prophet said it's just at that time
[1:08:21] the time of judgment
[1:08:23] that God always raises up something
[1:08:28] because he always does nothing until
[1:08:31] first he reveals it to the people and he
[1:08:35] always reveals it by his servants
[1:08:39] the prophets
[1:08:41] ain't that right
[1:08:43] so here though God is working in one end
[1:08:47] you see the world going the way it is
[1:08:49] God's working there
[1:08:51] do you believe it
[1:08:52] God's given them up to a reprobate mind
[1:08:55] that they should believe a lie and be
[1:08:57] damned
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:08:59] ain't that right
[1:09:01] then go look at Romans where God gave
[1:09:03] them up to uncleanliness to do those
[1:09:06] things which is our unseemingly
[1:09:09] through the lusts of their flesh God is
[1:09:12] at work he's given them over to what
[1:09:14] they want
[1:09:16] ain't that right
[1:09:18] amen but at the same time God had a
[1:09:22] secret place that could only be revealed
[1:09:26] through a prophet
[1:09:33] the hidden place
[1:09:34] the hidden food
[1:09:36] the hidden experience the hidden life
[1:09:40] can you say man
[1:09:42] as we close is it possible
[1:09:48] for something to be made plain
[1:09:51] and yet the people can't see it
[1:09:56] we find in the days of Elisha
[1:09:59] remember he kept me he was over in
[1:10:01] Dothan
[1:10:03] and the king of Syria I believe it was
[1:10:06] trying to go to war with with the king
[1:10:09] of Dothan
[1:10:11] dolphin whatever and
[1:10:15] and every time he'd go to get a surprise
[1:10:18] he got the
[1:10:20] the the king of Dothan
[1:10:22] knew his battle plans and everything
[1:10:25] no matter where he tried no matter of
[1:10:27] sneak attacks or whatever the king knew
[1:10:28] about it
[1:10:30] and he's like okay
[1:10:32] this is crazy
[1:10:34] who is it
[1:10:35] this is a spy in our kingdom
[1:10:39] oh none of us sir
[1:10:41] no then what's going on
[1:10:43] see they got a prophet in the land over
[1:10:45] there
[1:10:47] over there and he knows the very things
[1:10:48] you're thinking in your bed chamber what
[1:10:52] so what does he do he has his guys to go
[1:10:55] get him go get him
[1:10:57] and the Bible says that he sent horses
[1:10:59] he he sent
[1:11:01] masses of men he he sent his whole Army
[1:11:05] and he they incompassed that whole that
[1:11:09] whole city ain't that right
[1:11:12] and the Bible says that Elijah walked
[1:11:16] out in front of them they were after him
[1:11:19] Elisha
[1:11:20] and he smote him blind
[1:11:24] but not blind in the sense that they
[1:11:26] couldn't see nothing
[1:11:28] he walked right out in the middle of
[1:11:29] them and said who are you looking for oh
[1:11:33] but they didn't know it was him
[1:11:36] now you could say well well it's because
[1:11:38] they never seen him before but the Bible
[1:11:40] says it's because he smoothed him blind
[1:11:46] and he says oh I'll lead you to him just
[1:11:49] follow me and he leads them to another
[1:11:51] city to their another total mother and
[1:11:54] he led him in a trap
[1:11:57] ain't that right
[1:11:59] so it's possible that people can see and
[1:12:02] yet not see
[1:12:04] people can see Miracle after Miracle
[1:12:08] after miracle and still not believe it
[1:12:13] ain't that right
[1:12:14] yes sir it's it's just there see
[1:12:18] and so we find the prophet said people
[1:12:20] are so spiritually blind today
[1:12:23] that the Lord God though the Lord God
[1:12:26] come down in the midst of the people and
[1:12:28] do anything and the things that he
[1:12:31] promised they still can't see it
[1:12:34] they are spiritually blind they don't
[1:12:36] know God they don't know his great power
[1:12:38] now we know to see that in the days they
[1:12:40] of Elijah see they still do it today God
[1:12:43] smites them blind and they say today
[1:12:47] there's no Miracles and no such thing
[1:12:49] it's all all this is emotion can you say
[1:12:52] man and they are blinded
[1:12:56] see they they look at our excitement and
[1:12:59] our joy and our enthusiasm about the
[1:13:02] word of God and they call it going off
[1:13:04] the deep end they call it just a bunch
[1:13:06] of emotion and not realizing it's
[1:13:09] fulfilling Revelations 5.
[1:13:15] hello
[1:13:18] when the book was open right
[1:13:21] now as we close Revelations 10 1 7 has
[1:13:24] been fulfilled do you believe that
[1:13:27] it's been fulfilled
[1:13:29] the mighty Angel has descended with the

[1:14:19] a prophet for the word of God to come to
[1:14:22] no Priest No Pope or anything else can
[1:14:25] get it the word don't come to such the
[1:14:29] word of God comes only to a prophet
[1:14:31] always malach Kyle 4 promise such
[1:14:38] that's been fulfilled
[1:14:42] not in secret
[1:14:44] but it's been fulfilled out in the open
[1:14:47] seven times around the world
[1:14:50] can you say man
[1:14:51] and what has happened the world has
[1:14:54] looked upon it and yet blind it
[1:14:57] they can't see it
[1:15:00] but notice
[1:15:01] Revelations 10 8 and the voice which I
[1:15:04] heard from Heaven speaking to me again
[1:15:07] and said go and take the little book
[1:15:10] which is open
[1:15:12] revealed
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:15] in the hands of the Angel which standeth
[1:15:18] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:15:20] went unto the angel and said unto him
[1:15:22] give me the little book
[1:15:24] and he said unto me take it
[1:15:27] and eat it up
[1:15:32] where's your Green Pastures
[1:15:35] eat it up
[1:15:37] ain't that right
[1:15:40] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[1:15:42] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:15:46] and I took the little book out of the
[1:15:48] Angel's hand and ate it up
[1:15:50] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:15:52] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[1:15:54] was bitter
[1:15:55] ain't that right
[1:15:57] then he was told thou must prophesy
[1:16:00] again
[1:16:01] before many peoples Nations and tongues
[1:16:05] and Kings ain't that right
[1:16:08] this
[1:16:09] is being fulfilled
[1:16:12] today
[1:16:13] in the middle of a drought
[1:16:19] Hallelujah
[1:16:21] we're not running to and fro trying to
[1:16:23] find the word of the Lord
[1:16:27] we've been set right into Green Pastures
[1:16:30] with an open book
[1:16:33] eating and eating and eating to our
[1:16:38] hearts desire
[1:16:40] and it's sustaining our joy
[1:16:43] it's sustaining our faith it's
[1:16:46] sustaining everything we have need for
[1:16:48] the journey
[1:16:49] oh aren't you glad for that
[1:16:52] oh I love him do you love him as if the
[1:16:55] musicians will come
[1:16:57] and while we're eating
[1:16:59] the world
[1:17:01] knows nothing about it
[1:17:05] and even people in the message ranks
[1:17:09] know nothing about it
[1:17:13] they don't understand the power that's
[1:17:16] in the food that we're eating
[1:17:19] they they don't understand the things
[1:17:21] that that that that that that is going
[1:17:24] on
[1:17:25] notice
[1:17:27] one last scripture Matthew 13 and 10 and
[1:17:29] the disciples came and said unto him why
[1:17:32] speak a style unto them in parables
[1:17:35] and he answered and said unto them
[1:17:36] because it is given unto you to know the
[1:17:39] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:17:41] to them it is not given
[1:17:44] do you realize the message of the hour
[1:17:48] is food to one
[1:17:52] and Parables to another
[1:17:57] the message of the hour people get
[1:17:59] tripped up on
[1:18:05] that they'll get he's tripped up on his
[1:18:06] human side
[1:18:09] and there's some that that get tripped
[1:18:11] up on the deity side
[1:18:15] and and and and and and and and then
[1:18:18] they get tripped up where you know how
[1:18:19] maybe it seemed like brother Brandon's
[1:18:21] contradicting himself all the time
[1:18:24] it's parables
[1:18:27] and they tried to get us to believe
[1:18:29] there and see where they're at
[1:18:32] see their point of view
[1:18:36] that what they don't know it wasn't
[1:18:38] given to them
[1:18:41] there's an elect that this message came
[1:18:44] for
[1:18:47] when we come into the message I I had no
[1:18:50] I had no problems understanding that the
[1:18:53] prophet was a man
[1:18:56] I didn't
[1:18:57] stumble over the fact that he said 700
[1:19:00] instead of seven thousand that's right
[1:19:03] I didn't understand you know I I I
[1:19:05] didn't argue with all of them things
[1:19:08] I could see clearly that he was a man
[1:19:10] thank God that he was a man thank God
[1:19:13] that he was so transparent that he would
[1:19:15] let us know when he lied
[1:19:17] he let us know when he'd done these
[1:19:19] things and had to repent
[1:19:21] hello
[1:19:24] a lot more than a lot of preachers would
[1:19:25] do and a lot more than what laity would
[1:19:27] do
[1:19:29] but it showed me there was something
[1:19:31] about him that was genuine
[1:19:34] but then I saw a greater than a man
[1:19:39] I saw God
[1:19:42] in that man
[1:19:44] you love the Lord
[1:19:48] so he says see it is not given it is
[1:19:51] given unto you know to know the
[1:19:53] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:19:55] to them it is not given for whosoever
[1:19:58] hath to him shall be given and he shall
[1:20:01] have more abundance
[1:20:03] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:20:06] taken away even that he hath
[1:20:10] see
[1:20:11] that's why you know I'm on clothes but
[1:20:14] that's why I I don't look at these you
[1:20:17] know these denominations as having truth
[1:20:20] that I need
[1:20:23] hello
[1:20:26] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[1:20:29] and he shall have more abundance but
[1:20:31] whosoever hath not
[1:20:33] from him shall be taken away even that
[1:20:36] he have
[1:20:38] therefore speak I to the to The Parables
[1:20:41] because they sing see not in hearing
[1:20:44] they hear not neither do they understand
[1:20:49] but David said
[1:20:51] he calls of me
[1:20:53] he maketh me to lie down
[1:20:56] in Green Pastures
