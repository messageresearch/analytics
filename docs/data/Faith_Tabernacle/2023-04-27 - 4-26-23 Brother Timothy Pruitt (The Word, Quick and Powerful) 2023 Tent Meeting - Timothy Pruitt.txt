need of tonight amen I just believe God can move any mountain touch any situation that you would have and I trust that you've come expecting God to move amen and we were just really honored to to have each and every one of you and um I'm not going to mention names because I'll forget somebody but we're just really good to just welcome you and we're having a little issues with the sound but that's okay we're going to have church anyways and I wanted to maybe just read you a quote uh here but it says uh brother Brown talking he said this morning brother we had one of the nicest times of fellowship with the ministers here of the city and the visiting ministers that came to the breakfast he said one of the nicest little fellowships I ever I believe I ever set in with he said oh everyone with one Accord and they were different denominations the Baptist and different ones that shook my hands as they left the door and that's what I call sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and if the Holy Spirit could meet with us in a hotel room this morning in that manner with that many Christians what should it do with this great host of Christians here it could just do anything and I'm expecting him to do great things are you expecting him Hallelujah God thought of how that the Lord was with brother Branham as he he would give a message to to the church and he was preaching to many people that did not believe in what he was saying did not understand what he was saying then understand the importance of what he was and his ministry and that he's still labored and the angel of the Lord was with him because he was calling people out pulling people out of denomination restoring the faith and bringing us bringing the people back for a bride of Christ and I thought if the angel of God could meet when that situation what will he do tonight we are a people that's been called out where the message is not being introduced to us the angel of the Lord isn't being introduced to us we've had a personal relationship with him can you say Amen we've been called out of all the unbelief we've been called out of all the all the the baggage that that of traditions and denominations and ideology of men a man what a faith should be here tonight amen amen and I believe that we're we've got ministers in this meeting that is preaching the same message under the same inspiration that has caught hold of what brother Branham was trying to tell us and you say amen and I believe that well the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always and I just believe the angel of the Lord is here tonight do you believe that amen and so we're under great great expectation and uh before we have uh brother Timothy to come and um I I do have some announcements uh that I want to share with you um first of all we've got restrooms there right and left here on the right as you're walking out is the men's and the the sisters uh on the left and there's a nursery in that building there and it does have uh even though there's two doors there's six stalls in each in each bathroom uh restroom there so uh there but also the brother uh that that is is over the parking uh he's asked that if you are here throughout the day that is just you want to be here and fellowshipping ask that you do not park uh behind us in this parking over here but just drive up the road up the hill and there's a sign that will point you to the left and it's called on-site parking and so if you want to stay throughout the day you just park over there and then that way uh it will give them Freedom through sometimes if you park over here uh and then they're trying to park people for service then your car might be in the way of what they're trying to do so if you could do that that would be great also uh uh we we got this uh no savings seat policy uh and and we're sorry to do that but as as as the wheat goals uh uh we we're going to just fill up all the seats as the best we can and and so if you want a seat and you want a good seat come early and uh and then that way we'll all be satisfied praise the Lord and so um also asking uh for the children parents not let your children play in the tent during the day running around we've got expensive things here that the sound the music and things so and we also even though it's a tent and we want to keep this as as Reverend as we can and so uh plenty of acres to play uh have a ball we want you the the children to enjoy themselves uh just not in the tent and uh we'll keep that for service amen and so also uh every year we we have a lot of things left over after the meeting a lot of Bibles a lot of blankets a lot of whatever and clothes and so if you are missing something throughout the meeting and if it is found we're going to put it right in the back there uh uh at that table and so if you're you're missing glasses keys or whatever and if we do find it that's exactly where it will be if you can not find it there then maybe ask one of the ushers that you see and hopefully they'll be able to help you locate them there and if you have uh any anything that you're needing let us know we want to make your stay as as comfortable as we can and for we as a Faith Tabernacle really honored that you would take the time out of your busy schedule to come and visit us and and be a part of the meeting and also tomorrow night we're going to have or tomorrow night tomorrow at 12 we're going to have a Minister's luncheon and it will be for the ministers and their wife and uh so at 12 o'clock they're in Blacksburg at Preston's restaurant and so if you'd like to come we would love to have you and to have Fellowship and we always have a great time Fellowship among the ministry amen and I think that's what we need is just good fellowship and and let our hair down so to speak and and have a have a good time amen how he's come to hear the word of God amen I'm I'm just come uh so excited and and expecting God to do great things and many I guess uh of us know brother Timothy Pruett and his family just a wonderful brother in the Lord and appreciate his ministry very much and his love for the message his love for the people of God and if there's ever a time that we need Ministry it's now they're trying to shut us up you know and and which the prophet already warned us that the devil doesn't like ministers that preach in the message stand behind the pulpit amen and and so uh he's doing his best to discourage the ministry but we're here to uh put our shoulder to the wheel and as the prophet told us it's it's not the minister he doesn't have magic in his in his bag he doesn't bring Revival amen you operate the gift God supplied the gift of in the man before the foundation of the world a man but I just believed not only did he ordain brother Timothy to stand behind his Pulpit tonight but he ordained the people that would stand here tonight and pull on that gift because they would need that gift amen and God's going to speak to us in a great way and so as brother Timothy would make his way if we could just stand to our feet and um and we want him just to take his time and preach the gospel to Us Praise the Lord let's just sing only believe all things are possible praise the Lord oh We Believe oh be all Saints are possible all things church if you just believe yes oh holy believe [Music] only believe that all things are possible [Music] hold me can we sing it this way Lord I believe law I believe Lord [Music] I believe Lord I believe all things are possible [Music] it's good to be among believers amen Believers of Life precious Faith let's just bow our hearts right now to him and just ask God to come in this service maybe you just want to slip a hand up to him and say Lord come by my way speak to my heart this weekend move me a step higher Lord whatever it takes Lord I want to draw closer to you father what an honor I want a place to be Lord in this this tent or gathered with these Believers like Precious faith Lord we just sense your spirit even now Lord among us already no doubt touching hearts and lives Ministries and needs and what I believe you're going to do some wonderful things this weekend I believe healings are going to take place deliverances are going to take place families will be restored I want so many things that you want to do for us more you see the hands were lifted all over this place Lord and saying God come by my way speak to my heart touch my life Lord even my hand Lord tonight is lifted Lord I need to touch from

we commit our hearts to you father in this service to you everything to be said and done For Your Glory to give all the honor to you father I love you with all of our hearts we ask these things in Jesus name return your Bibles to Hebrew chapter 4. amen just like to say it's an honor honor to be here with you and be in this place to be able to minister to you and bring you greetings from our home church and my father brother Tim you might as able to travel here with my wife sister Ruth my daughter Katie you know said it before I'll say it again my family's been through a lot of changes in the last year and three of my my three older children are married now and and so things change very quickly and very rapidly and brother Wayne I'm waiting for my grandchildren amen that's a good place to be ain't it that's what I told him I said I'm Gonna Let You Get Married there's a price to pay amen hey you got to have some reason for being this old any man amen so uh but uh sister Katie's with us and she's not available [Music] and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countless was as the sun shineth in its strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death one more scripture Romans 8 and verse 11 it said if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen I'd like to speak to you this evening on the word quick and Powerful amen I believe that's the word that we have in our our day amen we'll let you be seated just looking at this word quick it means to be alive it means to be Lively it means to breathe it means to be among the living it means not to be lifeless and not dead but active blessed and endless in the kingdom of God it's Living Water therefore having vital vital power in itself and exerting the same upon the soul is to be full of vigor to be fresh to be strong to be efficient to be active and to be powerful I believe that's the word that we have in this day that we live in it's not a word that's a dead letter or dead Creed or some dead theolog Theologian or theology somewhere or some psychology but it is alive and it's moving among his people amen and we can read in Ephesians 2 and verse 1 and then this is the same word you hath he Quicken so therefore not only is the word to be alive but if he's quickened you you are to be alive amen you are to be full of the power of almighty God who were once dead in trespasses and sin we're in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh and the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our in our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as other but God who's rich in Mercy amen that's why we're here tonight because God's rich in Mercy it's not because of what I've done or how I I I was you know born in a certain of this and always God rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins so and it wasn't because you was a good person he loved you he loved you even when you was dead in sins but he has now made us alive together in Christ by Grace he are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in other places Colossians 2 and verse 13 it says you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of their flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses amen somebody say all all trespasses blotting out the handwritten of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and has four old principalities and powers and made a show of them openly try open over them in it see the word of God was spoken many many years ago before his coming speaking of Jesus spoke of his crucifixion spoke of his dance spoke of his suffering but it also spoke of his resurrection and brother Brian said of all those things that Jesus did all the healings he did all the Deliverance he did all the Vindication of God's word and what he did to a fulfill it of Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils preaching the gospel to the poor fulfilling every word that God said he would do when he came even suffering for our sins and going to the Cross being a perpetuation for our sins at the cross where no one else could have done it but him but above all of that he said I think the Resurrection on Easter morning sealed the whole thing amen we could talk about a good man long ago and we could talk about what he'd done but we can but we have a different story we're not talking about a man who lived and died and somewhere in a grave somewhere but we're talking about a man who lived he overcomes Satan he defeated him in every place he defeated him in every situation he healed the sick he raised the damn amen but he's not somewhere in a tomb but he's raised amen he said I once was dead but I'm Alive forevermore that is the god that we are speaking about and that is his word that we're talking about hey man we can read about it in Matthew 27 and verse 62. it says the next day that follow the day of preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together and under pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again now you would think if they really believed he was deceiver they wouldn't worry about what he said amen was something on the inside of them was like What if he's telling the truth what if what he said is the truth he said the command therefore that the Sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal them away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last Heir be worse than the first ain't that the way the devil operates he's from the pilate said you have a watch go your way making a sure as you can so they went and made the sepulchers to her sealing the stone and setting a watch but in the end of the Sabbath as it began to draw Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door that is set on and his countenance was like light in his raiment white as snow and the fear of him the keepers did oh the keepers did shake and became as dead man amen and became his dead man and the angel answered and said of the woman fear not she for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified but he's not here he is risen and come see the place where the Lord lay amen now I heard it said like this and I thought it was really good one time Jesus did not roll away the stone so he could get out he rolled away the stone so they could go in and see he wasn't there no more because his body could walk through walls his body could transfigure and go into another place and be found on the on the shore with fish he he could be taken over on the road of Emmaus he didn't need the stone Lord away but God rolled away those songs for us and I think about that how the devil will try to put a watch over our life and he tried to keep us in a group tomb somewhere and he tried to keep the power of God Amen away is sealed away and he sealed it with his seal and he tried to put whatever he tried to put over your life but there was a word spoke for your Resurrection there was a word spoke for your time to rise up out of the Grave out of whatever the devil had you in and there wasn't nothing the devil could do about it when your time come amen the word came and it spoke to you and it brought you out of the grave and all those demons that were that were there to try to keep you they fell as dead men [Applause] come on now hey man we're not talking about now the resurrection power just in one man it's in many men many women it's the same power of God that raised that body that's in this tent tonight it's the same power of God that raised that body that'll heal your body that'll deliver you that'll set you free [Applause] amen is a powerful word and it's a quick word I was just going through it quick you know it's another you do something quick and it's amazing how many times you can go through the scriptures of Jesus and it says and immediately and suddenly amen one day you can be a sinner and then suddenly a saved Son of God listen God's still doing that just had a man come and speak to our pastor brother Tim he said listen I had no no desire to serve God he said I was on my way I thought I had things done and I thought I had my life made and he said I wasn't looking for God he said I used to serve him but I walked away from him and I thought it was all over [Music] and he said he uh he went to his business there and he laid down on the couch and he hears a voice saying hey it's your time to come to me and suddenly he was changed amen I wouldn't give up on children I wouldn't give up on husbands I wouldn't give up on wives amen all of it takes is the voice of God and say it's your time it's your moment it's your time maybe somebody have a time in this tent tonight or this weekend it's our time it's our moment with the King [Applause] oh the resurrection proved who he was amen and has sealed the word of God forever for the True Believer all Gloom and doubt was shattered at that moment that Blissful morning man had been shut up in a prison house even even to religious people before this day but when a man died it seemed to be settled but when this one come and he said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to raise it up again then it didn't go prove what he said amen God purpose is to prove his word to be the truth there's only one man that could do that and that was Jesus and it came and proved to be the truth and it sealed it all and that broke all the seals of glue they have scattered all the superstitions of other religions where great men had raised up and said some things but they died and went down to a grave but in our religion it's the only one with an empty tooth Hallelujah and it proves to me that he is God of the Dead He's god of the living he can raise up the dead and bring him back to life again that's the quickening power of the Holy Ghost foreign [Applause] he proved it by his promise he's still proving it tonight where proofs of his resurrection we're supposed to be resurrected and we're dead I don't think that's the way it works when he proved by his promise this concrete conquering power he had on Easter he proved he could conquer death Hell In The Grave I am he that is dead and is alive again Alive forevermore I have the keys to death Hell In The Grave what a statement for anyone to make and not only did he make it he proved it there's a lot of been a lot of men that made a lot of statements but they never proved nothing but this God not only walk talk to talk but he walked the walk [Applause] amen the world had been shut up and doubt for many ages until then this proved not only what was talked about but it was proven and therefore now Jesus said go ye therefore and teach All Nations prove to them by demonstrating the power of God to them these signs shall follow them that believe them who promise and say they believe he give us a definite understanding of this this these signs will follow them that believe it will be proof of their testimony hey there's a lot of people talking to talk but they ain't walking the walk amen he said but until we have a proven sign that he said that would be upon us then we're just confessing to be Believers and not possession of believers Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world to who Every Creature they'll never they've never received all these signs shall follow them to believe how long all the world to who every creature that commission is still in effect amen and these signs shall follow them amen that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues and they'll take up deadly things serpents drink a deadly thing it'll not harm them and they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said that is his last commission to the church mark 16. is it was different than what poor Paul ordaining these gifts in the church years later said he ordained these same gifts and he said in Galatians 1 if an angel from heaven preached to you any other gospel than this that's already been received let him be accursed direct quote I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it's to Every Creature all times all place that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people he said now what is this Pentecostal blessing it's the confirmation of the Resurrection in other words no wonder the gospel itself means good news good news good news of what he's raised he's alive he has death under his feet death is the greatest enemy that we got and if that enemy has been conquered every enemy under him is conquered therefore every sickness is conquered every disease is conquered every situation you say well what about my family I was born like this if you don't let the word have preeminence in your life it'll conquer it [Applause] amen it'll conquer it if you'll let it work in you it'll conquer it well my daddy was like this and my granddaughter what about that Daddy amen anyhow oh boy that's getting better and better getting gunpowder into Brother Ray oh man it's the confirmation of the Resurrection that's why we got to have we got to have the confirmation that he's not dead he's not back 60 years ago he's not back a hundred years ago thousand two thousand years ago he's present living among us with the same signs the same wonders the same manifestations it's the same word and if it's the same word it has the same manifestation it has the same effect yeah he said because I live you live also ye who wants dead can live are ye who are dead can live amen amen amen praise the Lord anyhow the very essence of this Resurrection is the talent show and to prove Jesus is raised from the dead he's not dead he's alive he's living here he's in us if I be with you even in your little while the world will see me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you into the end of the world notice it's the same spirit that raised him up in the grave that is now dwelling in us how could that be the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead is now dwelling in the people amen it is the spirit that quickens in other words if you ain't got the spirit you got a dead letter you got a dead letter might have a good life might live A good whatever but without the spirit of God it's dead that's the word amen the letter killeth but the spirit-given life it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life it gives it wings to fly it gives it access it's the spirit that does that what he said in second Corinthians is the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so the wheat seed alone is just a wheat seed unless there's something to Quicken it amen but if it then it gives it life and we were once Dead made in the image of God yet dead in sins and trespasses but there had to be some way God could get this quick in life into our mortal bodies he said I'm talking about your body amen amen your body he said as a promised Messiah he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do he healed the sick he raised the dead how he'd be born a virgin how it all come he fulfilled all of those words amen but he wanted more than just one body he wanted many bodies amen with the same power with the same Vindication with the same spirit with the same life with the same everything he said now with that same spirit that was upon him to be the Redeemer in that age that we have accepted now the promise in this last days what would take place if you become part of that word you redeem with him because the same spirit that dwelt in Christ now dwells in you and it quickens your life into this age he said it's also in the end time quickens your mortal body it resurrects you it brings you up again that takes away the Gloom when we look at that Hey listen there's a lot of Gloom in this world I'm gonna deal with that word just a moment there's a lot of Gloom in this world you read the news there's Gloom you look around there's Gloom you know what Gloom is it's partial or total darkness and that's exactly what the devil's trying to put on our services is Gloom bring in the darkness and the worry am I getting too fanatical am I doing it am I getting a he says a darker shadowy place it's a loudness of spirit it's a dejection it's an atmosphere of despondency people can hear the truth of God and sit there like bumps on the law and no response to the word of God listen there has to be something a deep that calls into the deep there has to be a deep to respond [Applause] I read this this evening I said Lord let this be the prayer of this meeting he said May the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ move down and settle down over this audience and may the glooms of fear and doubt and unbelief be moved all away amen he said Lord I believe you'll give that to us just a touch of your presence just a touch if they'll receive it it'll move the Gloom back enough that their spiritual eyes can be opened to see what's standing in our midst it's your presence as Among Us that's who is here amen that's that'll be all right Lord don't let me sit in some atmosphere despondency all right what you need to turn your eyes to he's risen and if he's risen all things are possible your family situation can change just like that your sickness can change immediately or suddenly it don't take but one little touch tonight maybe a cancer has conquered you maybe something else has taken a hold of you some disease even the disease of sin or whatever it may look dark and gloomy to you now it may look like you'll never recover it may look like you can't get over that TB or prostate trouble or lung trouble that tumor that crippled condition the doctors may have said every hope is gone sounds gloomy every hope is gone but standing right by your side Heaven Ain't far away it's right by your side amen right by your side stands the eyes of Faith who can already see the victory oh God let us keep catch that eye tonight that is Catch it that we can already see it's over with it's done it's finished Hallelujah it sees the victory Yonder to the Lord Jesus Christ so Hallelujah away with Satan in his glue it's me tonight away was Satan in his glove away with what he says away with his orders and his dictation and his decrees away with Satan in his glue and up with the faith of the Lord Jesus the faith of almighty God faith that can stand Upon A Rock of Ages and Pierce an Eagle Eye through every stormy cloud [Applause] I'm looking at a people that ought to be singing I'm going to rise rise rise above it all [Applause] I'm gonna rise above depression I'm gonna rise above fear I'm gonna rise above anxiety I'm gonna rise above the sin cursed Earth oh if we can push the Gloom down and Let the Praises go up tonight listen we're not praising a God that's still in a tomb somewhere and we're waiting for him to get on a horse we're waiting for him to ride he's already risen and he's among us even now that's who's touching you that's who you're bumping into is that Supernatural Realm [Applause] you see when you get to that place you can stand there and look beyond the skies because listen the skies are not always going to be Sky uh what we call us uh blue uh there's a word bird blue or something like that then blue you know the beautiful blue bird Skies not a cloud in the sky Sun's shining man you get your cup of coffee it's cool in the morning you want to run out and just do a jig ain't always like that get up some morning thundering and lightning rain is all over the place clowns can sit there for day after day after day I don't care how long they sit there the sun is still there I don't care how long you've been dealing with what you're dealing with tonight the sun is still there [Applause] he's risen he's still Among Us he was there before the clouds were there [Applause] so away with the glue I mean he's happy tonight amen I [Applause] always like you know but John LaFontaine would use that at Camp he said that means happy raise your hand use on Sunday morning where Sunrise Service years ago when I was a kid how many is happy well then notify your face amen he says what you need to do is taste and see give God a chance we do that for me this weekend give God a chance give God a chance see if he will take it see if he'll give you glory for your misery see if he'll give you happiness for your Gloom see if he'll give you health for your sickness see if he'll give you the Holy Ghost bring your theology try it and see why don't we taste and see if the Lord is good let's give him a chance let's give him a chance to move Among Us let's just break down all the barriers let's just go ahead tonight and melt all the ice away say God you're here I know you hear your word says you're here therefore I'm going to give you a chance I'm gonna give you a chance to heal I'm gonna give you a chance to deliver I'm going to give you a chance to set free [Applause] Hallelujah if you give it to him he'll take it [Applause] Hallelujah anyhow [Applause] and deserve it he said that's a horrible thing serious it's an awful thing a shadow of Darkness it always makes you so upset you know everybody keeps saying oh get next to yourself but how how can you when something is haunting you would you say perhaps you're not feeling bound it's all true but you know that Jesus can make you well don't you sure amen God bless you now let's bow our heads for a moment for this little nervous sister oh Father this is some Mother's darling baby perhaps some man's wife maybe some child's mother and she stands here with this Gloom Satan's making her nervous oh he'd make her commit suicide he would he'd put an insane asylum set her against a padded sail against the wall but she's come forward to confess her love and then reaching out just now oh God send down Sovereign Grace and may the Holy Spirit drive away this enemy from her and may right now it leave her and never return and she'd be happy all the rest of her life and free from this disease and affliction in Jesus name he said now sister with your head bowed wouldn't you like to look look away has it left you you feel all right it's gone now you can raise your head now you can go off the platform happy rejoicing and praising God Hallelujah he was saying another place and he said if that little Gloom he caught a little Gloom that little Gloom that little shadow that I look at of darkness in the room if that would only could leave here some way we could get that away from here there wouldn't be a feeble person in the building in one minute from now the word is powerful powerful is a source of power as a source of energy in the Bible there's many references to the power of God's word his his word will get you through anything and everything this world can throw at you we read it the word is like a like a cut through life through confusion and we can help us see the reality of the truth God's word is a discerner therefore it can it can thoroughly examine Our Lives it can do what no other a book can do it's the penetrating power of God's word it can probe into the innermost access of our thinking and let me tell you he's still the discerner I I mean I probably could let me just ask how many has ever come to a service and you you maybe talk to somebody that week or maybe that day and the preacher get up and report but it just repeat exactly your conversation back to you he's still the discerner God knows your address and listen his GPS is always up to date it'll never need updating amen that GPS that the man has made it'll get you off on some dirt road somewhere and lost that's pretty good most of the time but let me tell you it'll leave you some Dark Places sometimes but this word right here it'll bring you out and it'll bring you in it's not going to leave you it's not ever going to forsake you but he's going to be with you we can read about God's word is like a fire it refines it purifies this word is like a hammer in Jeremiah 23 is capable of breaking hard hearts and shaping our character God's word is like a lamp it's it's like food it's like seed it's all this in the scripture this word is like a mirror his word is like gold it's like rain snow and water it cleans and refreshes his word is like an anchor it gives us security there in turbulent times his word is a source of strength that'll never run out it's a power and an energy that you don't ever have to worry does it still have enough is there still enough there it'll always have enough it'll always be enough what man makes and they build power plants and they build energy plants but one day they go away and they fade away but this word will never fade this word will never fail but it will prevail all throughout the world and into the eternities [Applause] the truth is there's nothing more powerful than the word of God it is the answer to every question it contains the power to meet every need it's word promises it will produce health and it will it's the answer to every human that need it will defeat the Devil anytime anywhere any place this power is unlimited it'll pull you through on your hardest days it'll sustain you when you feel all your strength is gone it's the Holy Ghost it's a word it's in the Church of the Living God and it's a sustainer and the energizing Force [Applause] so if you're going to preach the word you got to be anointed to preach the word hey please honey quote okay he says many of you ministers here you wouldn't want to say that you spit out a sermon or just popped it off direct quote you want to say it come from inspiration it has to come from the holy spirit that energizes you to speak that message if it isn't you will never be successful well this one's keeping me from doing this and this one's keep thought you know I get amazed people get to believe in men are bigger than God if God called you the gift will make place for itself so don't get mad at men unless you're getting mad at this man you Hallelujah anyhow he said this is Charles Finney and so forth men who copied their sermons out when I got up there and preached with the inspiration the Holy Ghost the same sermon he preached the night before hundreds brought to the altar there's such a difference it's got to be inspired the holy spirit's got to oceanize that so it is with healing it's got to be something there that takes place through a Divine gift that'll energize the people with the Holy Spirit to believe amen and so that's why we need the spirit of God in our services and we don't want to do anything that clamps down on him or puts him in a box he only does things certain way or he only does it in my way most boxes are our boxes and the way we want things done get some more gunpowder we want God to operate just a certain way so do the Pharisees so do the Sadducees they wanted God to come a certain way and when he come in the way of a Manger born with a woman who supposedly met an angel they called him what they call him illegitimate child we were not born of sin Hallelujah but God's got to oceanize it listen tonight there was a hundred things thousand things that God could preach every service these men of God there's thousands of things but you want the right thing and you know what God wants and listen you you have to learn that sometimes it's hard sometimes you get to learn real hard sometimes what God wants I remember as a young man young Minister and you know I was very dependent on notes and and uh I was overseas one time with brother Danny steaming and we split up one night and we then the next night we were splitting up and going into the opposite churches and the one Church they only had a lady for a translator first night I stayed at the town where he was in and preached there and Lord started putting something he started on tonight I started writing down scriptures and I saw Withers was headed I said God I can't do this so I took my notes got up and preached rub my nose in that concrete that hurt next night I'm on my way with a brother who couldn't speak English was just sitting in the car for two hours and I'm looking at my notes I wasn't started whirling started writing down same scriptures same thought same thing and I thought God here's my thoughts I'll be honest I said God if tonight's a flop it ain't my fault because I'm not doing what I did last night I got up with that little sticky pad of notes through scribbled down and my Bible and I began to preach and the power of God began to move in that place preaching on a little subject called Let My People Go just the subject of Deliverance and I got on suicide and I got to going down that trail on suicide and all of a sudden I don't know how long I was preaching without a translator but I looked over and the lady wasn't translating the more she couldn't she was just a puddle she looks at me and she's like give me a minute so I waited for her to get herself back together and we kept on going and ended up about 20 or 30 in that little service and prayed for the church the pastor everybody God moved in a mighty way got in the car with the pastor and his wife and the sisters translating she looked at me she said brother Timothy she said this was God she said this week I tried to take my life but I want to testify God delivered me right there see God knew me he knew what I was going to do so he drug my face to the mud the night before where it would have to be priests who needed to hear it but he wants to oceanize it now it's only happened a handful couple handfuls of time that that would happen in the back office things will change real quickly amen but I've learned if it happens I'm going to follow what he says we want to be led by the spirit I don't even know how it got there but that's where we're at we want to be auctionized and it ain't just for the preacher to be junctionized we need the spirit of God ocean eyes and hearts amen moving and touching and changing he said the vine he talks about the Divine the branches you know the the many times brother Branham used that well Jesus would say I'm the vine you're the branches he said the branch is energized by the life of the Vine therefore Jesus has no lips tonight on Earth but mine are yours he has no eyes but mine is yours he has no hands but mine is yours and he energizes and bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or seeing visions by eye whether whatever it is laying hands on the sick whatever it is is Christ working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence amen literally electrified by his presence that's what we want amen we want the power of God moving in our midst [Music] we got to have more than just some theology or some psychology or some just this ain't just need to be just a better way to live [Applause] listen we're not interested in a better way to live yes it is a better way to live but that's not what the goal is this message is life-changing it's body changing it's Soul changing [Applause] it has to literally Electrify every part of everybody you say well I don't know about life because you ain't got a hold of it yet get over here and get yourself in that electricity we're talking about limited power it can only handle so much it can only do so much it'll blow a fuse because it's made by man sound like a lot of man-made churches they can only handle so much of the movement of God it can only handle so much of the electrification of the Holy Ghost it can only handle so much of the spirit of God falling and moving it'll blow a fuse but let me tell you if you ever got a hold of it for yourself you'll know it's real you'll know what it done to you you'll know how to change your life and it's not a limited Source it's an unlimited Source it's got unlimited power it's got unlimited abilities but did healing and deliverance [Applause] grab a hold of it if you don't do nothing else a service or this weekend get a hold of that power [Applause] yes oh I gotta go here you know if you get a hold of that power to change your hair awesome well let me tell you if you get a hold of this power to change your hair too it'll change address it'll change everything about you might not be for a little while you can't hardly say number just just wiggle a little bit you know I don't know how it's going but it's going to have a reaction there's going to be something that's going to move [Applause] yeah buddy through you know but even though let me go back again even though we have this unlimited power afforded to us we still have moments of weariness we still have moments of tiredness spirit is willing but the flesh is weak Paul spoke about becoming weary or exhausted is what he said in Galatians 6 and verse 9 he said let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not second Thessalonians 3 again said be ye brother be not weary in well-doing it's the faint or to be utterly spiritless to be wearied out or exhausted LeBron would talk about he said I preached to more tired people than anybody in the world people so tired and so mentally strained where we are now that was in 53 this is 23 that's what 70 years ago so tired and so strained so weird well Timothy I just don't know if I can make it another step I'm tired you'll reap if you faint not you'll reap there's a reaping coming let me read you this when I love this he said awful nervous aren't you lady that's the devil that makes you that way well just my family makeup no it's the devil that makes you that way you think there's many things wrong with nervousness is the main thing that makes you feel that way that everything's wrong it makes you feel like everything's wrong like a Black Bolt comes from you like a cloud something that's waving like a breath moving and you get scared many times in the evening times when sun is sinking low you get weary don't you maybe many times many times you think you're going to lose your mind but you're not and I love these next two words you'll last you'll last fear not you're going to be all right it's going to be okay [Music] Hallelujah I feel like the Lord wanted me to tell somebody tonight you might be down and depressed and all worried and weary but fear not you're going to last you're going to last you're going to last oh hallelujah how long until God comes and either takes you to The Other Side by going to the Grave or he changes his body that's what you need to do is tell the devil I'm going to still be here when there's no more cancer there's no more sugar diabetes there's no more no more I'm looking at a people that's going to last [Applause] hallelujah amen you might feel weird you might feel a down and you might feel like you're about to give up but just put another foot forward keep walking keep possessing keep taking grounds keep moving you were last I've said it many times it says in the Bible in the last days perilous times shall come I want to ask you one thing tonight the last days for who we get all worried when we read that scripture in the last days and we see all the signs but let me tell you something it ain't my last days these ain't your last days we're gonna last we're going to be shouting on the Hills of Glory whenever devil in hell is bound and defeated and buried in the Lake of Fire you'll still be here when Cancer's no more you'll still be here with depressions no more you'll still be here when every devil in hell is bird let me tell you who the last days are for it's the last days for depression it's the last days for fear it's the last days for anxiety it's the last days for nervousness it's the last day for cancer it's the last days for sugar diabetes I'm gonna last [Applause] oh let's just praise him right now we're live we're worshiping a living God a Living Word with living signs and wonders we will remain [Applause] foreign Hallelujah he said how glorious God is don't you want to trust him if you're weary and tossed about it's a shame on you Christians call yourself a Christian go around so weird direct quote well I don't know if I go to church that oh you poor excuse direct quote he said let me tell you lift up your head straighten up your chest use that faith faith is the boss faith has hairs on his chest but I mean it's got big muscles and when it speaks all worries drop to one side of the other and the devil now says you can't make it you can't do this you're ashamed to do that Faith Rises up and says shut up I got the floor right now Faith takes the initial This Is Our Land this is our promise this is our inheritance how dare someone circumcised Felicity was to come up and say you can't have a baptism of the Holy Ghost say you can't have a real move the spirit see you can't have God in your midst I say let's take his head off there's some Davids that's come to this Camp it's I'm taking that God's head off I'm not listening to it more more day this is his last day [Applause] thank you Hallelujah [Applause] oh mercy he says in Isaiah 40 and verse 28 has thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God amen let me tell you your sickness is not Everlasting it might want to tell you it's Everlasting but it's not Everlasting I like this right here and I like to use it as much as I can your sickness has an expiration date just like your milk in your refrigerator you go to it how many is going to go there and look at that milk and it says what is today the 26th of April and it says April the 2nd and you're going to still pour you a big old glass of that milk and drink it not me no some people will but I ain't we had goats you know and uh my mama and papa live next door and my poor memo she had sugar diabetes and so she had lost her taste but she could always taste sweets somehow she never lost tapes for sweets but everything else she said I couldn't taste I walked in the door one day brother Wayne and they would get goat milk from us let me tell you something goat milk's good if it's taken care of Done Right is good stuff it's in the Bible Thou shalt have goat's milk anyway but when it turns bad no if it's got a little bit of bad in it no I walked in that house and I smelt it bad when I walked in the door my Peppa's sitting over there with a with a bowl of cereal he'd fix that evening my mama had and she'd pour that goat milk in it it was Sour it was so bad it was curdled and he's like he seen me he said Timothy come tell me I'm all this milk's bad oh I don't even have to come over and look at it it's bad my own she grabbed her a big old Spoonful up ain't nothing wrong with that milk I said Mama it might not be nothing wrong with it to you but to me and Papa that stuff's bad let me go get him another jug of it was inspired and passed his due date or his good date and then your sickness has the same expiration date it's wrote on it already by the pie hand of almighty God your day comes to end here [Applause] thanks but a Believer has no expiration date there's no end to you amen when you're still millions of years shouting against the Hills of Glory and that cancer so far back you don't even remember it no more and that person's gone you don't even know about it there's no more tears no more sorrow no more partying no more nothing like that for the devil has brought in it's all over why because it expired I pray this weekend some expiration dates will be pulled on some devils this is your last time over that one this is your last time over that one you have come to your end because there is a word here that has jurisdiction has power over that Spirit of hell he's the Everlasting God he's the Lord the creators of the ends of the Earth and he fainteth not neither is weary so when you give up don't mean God gave up there is no searching of his understanding he'd give power to the faint to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall fade hello and I'll tell you right now I'm a stronger I can do all kinds of things I can do 50 chin-ups and push-ups just keep living even the youth shall feign and be weary and young men shall utterly fail but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint my I got so many things here just touch this for a moment the random preaching this in Jeffersonville to see you Church by the world he says where is our power where is our Glory what is it we have went after the wisdom of men instead of the power of God you want to lose power go after the wisdom of men go after psychology go after intellectualism our preachers and things have become so stiff and starchy they've organized as us us to we're so still starchy and stiff neck so you never hear us shout in the church anymore you never hear anybody cry the mourner's benches in the basement there's no more glory in the church all we do is set back just as stiff as we can be we're not free we're bound the devil with his modernistic demons has bound the Church of the Living God there's no more power there's no more freedom there the people are so starchy and still why God can come in the midst of Pentecostal people and show that he's God and prove his signs of his resurrection and it don't even shake them no more it's a disgrace I walk across the country and God working and Performing signs and people sit and say well I guess that's all right oh I know it can be it doesn't move them they're bound with the light of the world they are in Fetters they even got them to where they're Bound in the Confederation the Philistines are upon these Samson what are you going to do about it oh we got denominations we got greater membership but where is the spirit where's the Holy Ghost that's what the devil has done it's wooed into the church and has kept wooing the church come to me I'll give you this big Tabernacle if you do this I'll get you get rid of that fanatic preacher you got and get your doctor Divinity that's got some sense and some nice big classical Church you'll be we'll be like the rest of them shame on you he said I'd rather have a man that didn't know split beans but it's coffee from beans but was filled with the Holy Ghost and he would be uncompromised by the power of almighty God [Applause] but it's God so starchy that some poor Saint can break through in a meeting speak in tongues or shout a little bit and the rest of them will all Gander around say what was that I wonder where that was why must be something that he dropped in here he said you know that's the truth some poor Saints step in and get happy and raise their hands cry praise God somebody will holler a man preaching the gospel to the preaching of the Gospel somehow it's all right if we're singing we can jump and shop and preach and we can't the rest of them turn around and see what he said that's Pentecostal that's what's the matter your pattern out the Methodist and after the Baptist and their pattern after the Catholic and the Catholic are pattern after hell [Applause] Delilah is woojoo find educated ministers a better class what are we going to do what's going to happen and I'm just skipping through here you can go listen to it he said Samson the Philistines is on the Branham Tabernacle worldlyism is creeping it among you direct quote what about it have you exposed your secret have you exposed that secret that God gave you when you're Walling there in the sawdust a few years ago have you let it creep out by some social formal worship what happened to you God can come down and perform Miracles and go right down to the audience and tell people the secrets of their heart and everything and heal the sick The Afflicted do signs of Wonders preach his word as hard as they can by the Holy Ghost and people say well I guess that's all right we enjoyed listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired but we're not too tired at a ball game we're not too tired in the world we're not too tired when we're watching movies late at night or playing games all night we're not too tired but all of a sudden the word of God comes and we're tired I tell you what I'm tired of I'm tired of a formal Social Gospel I'm tired of a man that has to be bound because he can't preach the Holy Ghost he can't believe some Deliverance he can't preach some Miracles he can't preach the signs I'm tired of that spirit that wants to clamp down upon us that's what I'm tired of well you're just working up the people what are you doing working them down [Music] well I bet that gunpowder is pretty good buddy Hallelujah Revival in our day how could it be sounds pretty gloomy brother Timothy story ain't finished the quote ain't finished either direct quote same sermon paragraph 81. God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in demonstration of the spirit Mark 16 can follow that church Acts 2 4 Acts 2 38 and all of it if you follow along with the church signs and wonders accompanying the apostles great signs of his resurrection among them listen to the prophet he says while we're in prison surely God's growing a crop somewhere for that last great kill Hallelujah for that last great kill may it be you my Christian friend may it be our strength has begun to grow I pray this message will go out to the land I trust that this message will bring a spiritual vitamin into your system that'll grow a spiritual power back into your life again [Applause] oh hey man woman oh some spiritual vitamins well we know what those spiritual items would do he talks about that with the two calves one in the barn nice and shiny in one of the barn about to fall down he said but that old man had that shiny bar and he didn't take care he didn't give that calf no vitamins he didn't give him nothing to eat he starred him half to death but in that old Shaggy Barn over there it was that man he'd put up some good hay he put up some good vitamins and all went along he'd been tossing them to it and it comes Springtime and they opened up the gates and here comes that old wobbly calf out God don't do what he used to do he's not the same yesterday today and forever he's we're not in the season the Miracles but there was a young calf the gate opened on him he come dancing out of that stall he said what the difference was what made the difference one had been eaten and one had not been eaten one had vitamins and one didn't of course had a wobbly knee calf saw that old calf over there having himself a good time and jumping and shouting moving snorting and snotting shut up they got fanaticism there such fanaticism fanaticism bubble dancing fanaticism but that fat calf look over that skinny cap and said have you been eating like I've been eating you'd be dancing like I'm dancing if you've been getting what I've been getting if you've been receiving what I've been receiving I've been receiving strength from El shadiah I've been Smitty's receiving strength but the power that'll never run out [Applause] if you only knew like I know what he's done for me how he kept me in my winter times hey kept me when there was nothing around me and I didn't know where the next meal was coming from but God rich and mercy [Applause] if you were to come from the same pit that I came from you would know what it's like to Worship in Freedom and deliverance Hallelujah amen bringing it on down he says in second Samuel 23 God is my strength and power he maketh my way perfect he didn't say it'd make your way easy he didn't say he'd make it without trials or heartaches or Church issues whatever he just said he'd make it perfect all things work together for the good to them that are they called according to his purpose his purpose so he's working it for your perfection it'll be perfect no matter if it's through a valley it's perfect if it's over a heel top it's perfect no matter where it's at amen Psalm 66 3 says say unto God how terrible art thou and thou Works through the greatness of thy power thy enemies shall submit themselves unto thee 68 and 35 said oh God Thou Art terrible terrible out of the holy places the god of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be God 147 5 great is our Lord and of great power and his understanding is infinite acts 1 and verse 7 says and for you to know that it's not for you to know the times of the season but the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon thee Oh you said well I don't know about well acts 4 33 and with great power Gravely gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ Stephen Full of faith and Power First Corinthians 2 1. I brother when I come to you come now with excellent speech or wisdom declaring you the testimony of God for I'm determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and then crucified I was with you in weakness and fear and must trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power the Holy Spirit oceanizing First Corinthians 4 19 so I will come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power second Timothy 1 7 says for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power it's a spirit of power and of love and of sound mind let me finish with this one right here musicians can come he said how can a man today upon the principles of what Jesus promised he sized all the world and these blessings to all the world and the Holy Ghost to fall like it did in the beginning and whatsoever God would call how can a man call himself a Christian and deny that word and say the holy spirit is in him the Holy Spirit Will punctuate every word of God with an amen oh brother our Educational Systems has drawn us away from it oh I think I need to read that again he said the Holy Spirit Will punctuate every word of God with an amen oh brother our Educational Systems has drawn us away from it and our denomination has separated us from one another and from Christ and they'll continue to do that you take a substitute or any other thing it has no more fig leaves again God rejects it he said but when the church comes under the blood of Jesus Christ with the token of the Holy Spirit upon them and then you'll see it see Brotherhood again you're going to see a church full of power you're going to God hates a powerless religion it's got to be power it's a power to save a man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles it's a power God doesn't want a powerless religion God doesn't want that God wants to perform [Applause] God wants to show himself alive our very hope is this Resurrection is that right Our Hope of life is Resurrection the resurrection of Jesus Christ see God wants to work in his church [Music] he wants to work this weekend foreign go out with more degrees to put on your wall no he wants to work in power Deliverance salvation healings [Music] Jesus said I'll be with you always to the end of the world the works that I do so you shall do also the words that I do shall you do also even more than this how you do I go to my father the church tries to deny that and get a way to get more members to be more popular but he said I want to ask you something God is trying to perform in his church God the church is trying to perform with a Creed but the two will never work together you've got to get rid of the Creed and get Christ in and when he sees the blood and the blood's been applied and the Hand laid Upon Jesus Christ and the heart that's true before God and confess him wrong and be born of the Holy Ghost then the works of God will follow he said it would be so your church wants to perform through their Creed see how many members they can get God wants to perform through the power of the blood and get Christians born again he says you got to reject the Holy Spirit and his performing power to accept a Creed you have to see the truth before you can accept the arrow Arrow if you're going to be a Christian you have to walk over God's promises to walk in air because there's a red flashing light before you all the time this is the
